The aim {{of this paper was}} to study the effect of the aqueous feed composition and tri-n-octylamine/ 2 -ethyl- 1 -hexanol concentration on the acetic acid extraction and glycolaldehyde <b>co-extraction</b> performance. In the physical and reactive extractions, glycolaldehyde and acetic acid are extracted independently from each other. In the physical extraction, the feed composition has a slight influence on the distribution coefficients and yields of both acetic acid extraction and glycolaldehyde <b>co-extraction.</b> In the reactive extraction, the acetic acid extraction and glycolaldehyde <b>co-extraction</b> are relatively independent of the feed composition. For a combined one-step acetic acid and glycolaldehyde extraction pure 2 -ethyl- 1 -hexanol solvent provides the highest yields. Although 40 wt. % tri-n-octylamine provides the best acetic acid extraction performance, a solvent containing more than 50 wt. % tri-n-octylamine in 2 -ethyl- 1 -hexanol is preferred for a two-step scenario in which acetic acid is extracted prior to glycolaldehyde, due to the decrease of glycolaldehyde <b>co-extraction</b> with increasing tri-n-octylamine concentratio...|$|E

However, during extraction of the target solute other compounds present in the extraction medium will also react with the ion exchange reagent and are thus co-extracted.

The effect of co-extracting compounds has been included in a new interfacial flux balance, and experimental results reveal that the interfacial concentrations are equal to the final equilibrium conditions of the system. Using this information a simple mass transfer model has been developed from which film mass transfer coefficients may be determined. <b>Co-extraction</b> of other compounds present in the feed was found to reduce the interfacial flux of the target solute by reducing the driving force. <b>Co-extraction</b> did not affect the value of the film mass transfer coefficient, and therefore, <b>co-extraction</b> does not effect the transport properties of the solute to the interface.

40|$|Background: Retrospective {{studies of}} {{archived}} human specimens, with known clinical follow-up, {{are used to}} identify predictive and prognostic molecular markers of disease. Due to biochemical differences, however, formalin-fixed paraffinembedded (FFPE) DNA and RNA have generally been extracted separately from either different tissue sections or from the same section by dividing the digested tissue. The former limits accurate correlation whilst the latter is impractical when utilizing rare or limited archived specimens. Principal Findings: For effective recovery of genomic DNA and total RNA from a single FFPE specimen, without splitting the proteinase-K digested tissue solution, we optimized a <b>co-extraction</b> method by using TRIzol and purifying DNA from the lower aqueous and RNA from the upper organic phases. Using a series of seven different archived specimens, we evaluated the total amounts of genomic DNA and total RNA recovered by our TRIzol-based <b>co-extraction</b> method and compared our results with those from two commercial kits, the Qiagen AllPrep DNA/RNA FFPE kit, for <b>co-extraction,</b> and the Ambion RecoverAll TM Total Nucleic Acid Isolation kit, for separate extraction of FFPE-DNA and-RNA.

40|$|During the {{partitioning}} of trivalent actinides from High Active Raffinate (HAR) solutions most processes have to {{cope with}} an undesirable <b>co-extraction</b> of some of the fission products. Four hydrophilic complexing agents of the group of polyaminocarboxylic acids, namely EDTA, HEDTA, DTPA and CTDA were tested and compared for their ability to complex fission products in a simulated PUREX raffinate solution, thereby preventing their extraction into an organic solvent. Several solvents, based on TODGA and the DIAMEX reference molecule DMDOHEMA, that are commonly known to show quite high Zr and Pd <b>co-extraction</b> were studied. Our investigations ultimately resulted in a substitution of oxalic acid and HEDTA by cyclohexanediaminetetraacetic acid (CDTA). A small addition of this hydrophilic complexing agent to the feed decreased the distribution ratios of Zr from 100 to 90 % of the metal retained in the feed solution. The extraction of trivalent actinides and lanthanides was not negatively affected by the presence of CDTA. Furthermore, experiments with high concentrations of Zr proved the applicability of this new masking agent. The suppression of Zr and Pd extraction was also verified at a high Pu loading which makes CDTA, as a masking agent, attractive for grouped actinide extraction processes (GANEX) as well as DIAMEX-SANEX type separations.

However, to fully optimize the process, the microbial communities involved and their functional roles must be understood. Mixed microbial AD sample analysis requires a robust methodological framework for investigation of community structure and function. The objective of this thesis was, firstly, to develop a successful <b>co-extraction</b> methodology to recover nucleic acids and proteins from AD bioreactors treating grass and food waste for 16 S rRNA analysis and metaproteomics analyses. Methods for sample preparation, cell lysis, protein extraction and separation were investigated. Once a metaproteomic workflow was established, a <b>co-extraction</b> methodology was developed for both grass AD and food waste AD samples. The established <b>co-extraction</b> workflow using the Norgen Biotek kit was employed to analyse DNA, RNA and protein from grass biofilm and leachate fractions of triplicate leach-bed grass anaerobic bioreactors. The combined 16 S rRNA analysis and metaproteomics revealed the microbial structure of the triplicate bioreactors and their microbial functions. Clostridiales, Bacteroidales and Prevotella were involved in grass degradation, the production of methane was mainly attributed to Methanosarcinales, while Prevotella, Megasphaera, Clostridiales, Bacteroides, Azotobacter and Dysogonomas were responsible for VFA production. A metaproteomic approach was also employed {{in the context of}} food AD, where digestate fractions of triplicate bioreactors were sampled as a function of time. Previous 16 S rRNA analysis had revealed community shifts during the reactor trial, and a functional-based approach was employed to investigate the metabolic activities taking place throughout the reactor run (3 time-points). The majority of proteins identified were assigned to Lactobacillales, while Enterobacteriales were mainly responsible for food waste hydrolysis. There was no evidence of methane production, however proteins were identified for the production of acetate, butyrate and propionate, which was in agreement with process observations. Overall, the workflow established and integrated analysis employed in this research uncovered the community structure and function of grass AD and food waste AD. The metabolic activities of the microbial communities supported the observations at the process level. Microorganisms responsible for the degradation of substrates were uncovered, while those involved in the production of end-products were also identified.

40|$|A newly {{developed}} method for advanced reprocessing of used nuclear fuel is the Group ActiNide EXtraction (GANEX) process. It is a liquid-liquid extraction process that aims at extracting all the actinides {{as a group}} from dissolved used nuclear fuel. This extraction can either be performed after a removal of the bulk uranium or directly on the dissolution liquor. At Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden a solvent that utilizes tributyl-phosphate (TBP) and a molecule from the bis-triazine bipyridine (BTBP) class of ligands dissolved in cyclohexanone has been developed for the use in a GANEX process. Previously the system has not been tested {{with the presence of}} technetium {{that is one of the}} major fission products. Technetium is often considered a problem within reprocessing since it has a chemical behaviour that differs from most other elements in the spent fuel. Therefore, a special emphasis was put on the investigation of technetium in the selected GANEX system. It was shown that technetium is readily extracted by the GANEX solvent and that cyclohexanone is the main extractant when no other metals were present in the system. It was also found that the presence of uranium decreased the overall technetium extraction despite a slight <b>co-extraction</b> with TBP, while irradiation of the GANEX solvent to large doses ([> 1 MGy) increased its technetium extraction capability.

40|$|Adequate {{comparisons}} of DNA and cDNA libraries from complex environments require 21 methods for <b>co-extraction</b> of DNA and RNA {{due to the}} inherent heterogeneity of such samples, 22 or risk bias caused by variations in lysis and extraction efficiencies. Still, there are few methods 23 and kits allowing simultaneous extraction of DNA and RNA from the same sample, and the 24 existing ones generally require optimization. The proprietary nature of kit components, 25 however, makes modifications of individual steps in the manufacturer’s recommended 26 procedure difficult. Surprisingly, enzymatic treatments are often performed before purification 27 procedures are complete, which we have identified here as a major problem when seeking 28 efficient genomic DNA removal from RNA extracts. Here, we tested several DNA/RNA co 29 extraction commercial kits on inhibitor-rich soils, and compared them to a commonly used 30 phenol-chloroform <b>co-extraction</b> method. Since none of the kits/methods co-extracted high 31 quality nucleic acid material, we optimized the extraction workflow by introducing small but 32 important improvements. In particular, we illustrate the need for extensive purification prior to 33 all enzymatic procedures, with special focus on the DNase digestion step in RNA extraction. 34 These adjustments led to the removal of enzymatic inhibition in RNA extracts and made it 35 possible to reduce genomic DNA to below detectable levels as determined by quantitative PCR. 36 Notably, we confirmed that DNase digestion may not be uniform in replicate extraction 37 reactions, thus the analysis of “representative samples” is insufficient.

To this end, two types of experiments were carried out: (a) those designed to study arsenic speciation under simulated U-leaching conditions, with the use of model arsenide minerals, namely niccolite (NiAs), rammelsbergite (NiAs$ sb 2 $) and gersdorffite (NiAsS); and (b) statistically designed tests involving actual leaching of samples of the Key Lake ore. Niccolite and rammelsbergite were found to yield H$ sb 3 $AsO$ sb 3 $ in solution as oppossed to gersdorffite, which was found to yield H$ sb 3 $AsO$ sb 4 $. H$ sb 3 $AsO$ sb 3 $ was found to be metastable in the Fe$ sb 2 $(SO$ sb 4) sb 3 $ leaching system, while in the FeCl$ sb 3 $ and pressure (O$ sb 2 $) leaching systems, further oxidation to H$ sb 3 $AsO$ sb 4 $ was observed to take place at relatively slow rates. A mechanism has been advanced to account for the latter slow oxidation of H$ sb 3 $AsO$ sb 3 $ to H$ sb 3 $AsO$ sb 4 $. Finally, it was concluded that the formation of As(III) /As(V) in oxidative acid leaching is independent of the prevailing suspension redox potential which, in turn, renders impractical the possible stabilization of As(III) via potential control. The solubility of RaSO$ sb 4 $ in HCl-MeCl$ sb{ rm x}$ leaching media was quantitatively established by employing the "reduced activity coefficient" method.

Uranium and radium were found to dissolve simultaneously and rapidly (99 % <b>co-extraction</b> in 2 hrs). Effective reduction of radioactivity levels from 10, 000 pCi/g Ra$ sp{ 226 }$ down to 160 pCi/g has been achieved in a single-stage batch process, thus making possible the production of environmentally innocuous tailings...|$|E
40|$|In this work, the {{back-bone}} of the diglycolamide-structure of the TODGA extractant {{was modified}} by add-ing {{one or two}} methyl groups to the central methylene carbon-atoms. The influence of these structural modifica-tions on the extraction behavior of trivalent actinides and lanthanides and other fission products was studied in solvent extraction experiments. The addition of methyl groups to the central meth-ylene carbon atoms leads to reduced distribution ratios, also for Sr(II). This reduced extraction efficiency for Sr(II) is beneficial for process applications, as the <b>co-extraction</b> of Sr(II) can be avoided, resulting in an easier process design. The use of these modified diglycolamides in solvent extraction processes is discussed. Furthermore, the complexation of Cm(III) and Eu(III) to the ligands was studied using Time-Resolved-Laser-Fluorescence-Spectroscopy (TRLFS). The com-plexes were characterized by slope analysis and condi-tional stability constants were determined...|$|E
40|$|In aspect-based {{sentiment}} analysis, extracting aspect terms {{along with}} the opinions being expressed from user-generated content {{is one of the}} most important subtasks. Previous studies have shown that exploiting connections between aspect and opinion terms is promising for this task. In this paper, we propose a novel joint model that integrates recursive neural networks and conditional random fields into a unified framework for explicit aspect and opinion terms <b>co-extraction.</b> The proposed model learns high-level discriminative features and double propagate information between aspect and opinion terms, simultaneously. Moreover, it is flexible to incorporate hand-crafted features into the proposed model to further boost its information extraction performance. Experimental results on the SemEval Challenge 2014 dataset show the superiority of our proposed model over several baseline methods as well as the winning systems of the challenge...|$|E
