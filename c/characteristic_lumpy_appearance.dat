50|$|Symptoms {{caused by}} this {{pathogen}} vary {{based on the}} specific host cultivar; however, {{a majority of the}} symptoms are very similar between the different hosts. Symptoms usually include various degrees of mottling, chlorosis, curling, dwarfing, and distortion of the fruit, leaves, and even whole plants. The symptoms on fruit include: a reduction in size, mottling and color changes, and an obvious distorted and <b>lumpy</b> <b>appearance.</b> Also, many times brown necrotic streaks or splotches can be seen on the leaves and fruit. The symptoms can easily be seen on new growth, and they are far more pronounced if the plant was infected when it was young rather than when it was older.|$|R

5|$|Among the locally {{produced}} yarns for Navajo textile, indiscriminate breeding from 1870-1890 {{caused a}} steady decline in wool quality. Increasing proportions of brittle kemp {{can be found}} in well-preserved examples from the period. In 1903, federal agents attempted to address the problem by introducing Rambouillet rams into the breeding population. The Rambouillet is a French breed that produces good meat and heavy, fine-wool fleeces. The Rambouillet stock were well adapted to the Southwestern climate, but their wool was less suitable to hand spinning. Short-stapled Rambouillet wool has a tight crimp, which makes hand spinning difficult. The higher lanolin content of its wool necessitated significantly more scouring with scarce water before it could be dyed effectively. From 1920 to 1940, when Rambouillet bloodlines dominated the tribe's stock, Navajo rugs have a characteristically curly wool and sometimes a knotted or <b>lumpy</b> <b>appearance.</b>|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND Tracheal {{follicular}} pattern or so-called tracheal cobblestoning is {{a poorly}} described entity {{in the literature}} and is depicted as a nodular or <b>lumpy</b> <b>appearance</b> of the tracheal wall mucosa suggesting tracheal irritation from factors like gastro-esophageal reflux (GERD) or pulmonary infection. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate the prevalence and characteristics of tracheal cobblestones in a large pediatric population. METHODS A large database of rigid tracheoscopies recorded in children (0 - 6 years of age) undergoing general anesthesia with planned tracheal intubation for elective surgical procedures was retrospectively analyzed. Tracheoscopy records were reviewed by five pediatric airway experts (authors 3 - 7). Data were compared using the Mann-Whitney test, chi-square or Fisher exact test as appropriate (P[*]<[*] 0. 05). RESULTS A total of 971 rigid tracheoscopy records were analyzed. The median age of the patients was 3. 3 years (range 0. 4 - 6. 0 yrs). Cobblestones were present in 377 out of 971 patients (38. 8 %) with a male to female prevalence of 254 (40. 6 %) / 123 (35. 5 %). None of the children under four months of age showed the presence of cobblestones. The prevalence of cobblestones was significantly less in patients under 3 years of age compared to over 3 years (P[*]<[*] 0. 01). There was no association between prevalence of cobblestones and GERD, current or recent respiratory infection or concomitant enlarged tonsils. CONCLUSION The prevalence of tracheal cobblestones in otherwise healthy children is high and is not associated with GERD or respiratory infection. The gender and age related differences are novel interesting findings that require further investigations. Pediatr Pulmonol. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|R

40|$|Mice immunized with soluble {{heterologous}} thyroglobulins developed autoantibody that cross-reacted with autologous thyroglobulin. There was {{a direct}} correlation between the temporal appearance and quantity of serum autoantibody and the presumed in situ formation of immune complexes in the interstitium of the thyroid glands. Immediately after the formation of interstitial immune complexes containing antibody of the IgG complement-fixing type, the thyroids were invaded by a transient but intense neutrophil infiltrate which within 1 wk was replaced by chronic mononuclear elements. By the combination of fluorescence microscopy and autoradiography, thyroglobulin was demonstrated to be one, if not the sole, antigen in the interstitial immune complexes. The interstitial immune complexes were granular to <b>lumpy</b> in <b>appearance</b> and formed at the basal area of the follicular cells in intimate association with the follicular basement membrane. Electron microscopy revealed electron dense deposits, presumably immune complexes, between the follicular basement membrane and the plasma membrane. The presumed in situ formation of immune complexes in this model {{is similar to that}} which occurs in the Arthus reaction and is a different mechanism of immune complex injury than that caused by tissue deposition of circulating immune complexes as occurs in serum sickness...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Accurate demand {{forecasting}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} key issues in inventory management of spare parts. The problem of modeling future consumption becomes especially difficult for lumpy patterns, which characterized by intervals in which there is no demand and, periods with actual demand occurrences with large variation in demand levels. However, many of the forecasting methods may perform poorly when demand for an item is lumpy. In this study based on the <b>characteristic</b> of <b>lumpy</b> demand patterns of spare parts a hybrid forecasting approach has been developed, which use a multi-layered perceptron neural network and a traditional recursive method for forecasting future demands. In the described approach the multi-layered perceptron are adapted to forecast occurrences of non-zero demands, and then a conventional recursive method is used to estimate the quantity of non-zero demands. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, their forecasts were compared to those obtained by using Syntetos & Boylan approximation, recently employed multi-layered perceptron neural network, generalized regression neural network and elman recurrent neural network in this area. The models were applied to forecast future demand of spare parts of Arak Petrochemical Company in Iran, using 30 types of real data sets. The results indicate that the forecasts obtained by using our proposed mode are superior to those obtained by using other methods...|$|R
40|$|This {{work was}} {{proposed}} to study pathologic <b>characteristics</b> of <b>lumpy</b> skin disease (LSD) among naturally infected cattle and to demonstrate LSDV antigen within different tissues including the skin nodules, regional lymph nodes, lung and liver using PCR and immunohistochemistry. Among the infected cattle, one dairy cattle and 5 calves were dead (mortality rate is 6. 97 %). The major gross alterations in all investigated cases included numerous 1 - 5 cm well circumscribed, round cutaneous nodules covered {{the whole body}} in most cases with severe enlargement of superficial lymph nodes. The main microscopical changes were severe ballooning degeneration of the epidermis, dermatitis, with severe vasculitis affecting the dermal blood vessels. Multiple intracytoplasmic eosinophilic inclusions were present in degenerated epidermal cells. Several pathological changes were also detected in the liver, lung, kidney, intestine and lymph nodes. Strong positive PCR signals were appeared in skin nodules, lung and lymph node. Additionally, positive immunoperixodiase reaction was demonstrated in the skin, lung, kidney and lymph nodes. Furthermore, LSDV was isolated on chorio-allantoic membrane (CAM) of spf embryonated chicken eggs from skin nodules and regional lymph nodes collected from dead animals. Virion particles were observed on CAM by electron microscope. Finally, it could be concluded that skin lesions is a constant lesion in both young and adult animals together with systemic infection in severely infected animals...|$|R
40|$|Part demand {{forecasting}} methods {{assume that}} the demand for a part over time follows a predictable pattern, and that the patterns observed in historical data provide a reliable indication of future demands. Generally, forecasting studies focus on topics such as: the span of time from which to sample the historical data, an assessment of data {{in order to find}} weekly or annual patterns, and the assignment of probabilities of different demand quantities in any given time period. Using the demand models derived from these forecasting methods, inventory decisions are made [...] decisions which directly impact operating cost and equipment availability. Like most general part demand forecasting methods, aircraft spare part demand forecasting considers historical trends in order to predict future demand. It is a well-known practical observation that aircraft spare part demands are often very erratic (quantity variability), intermittent (variable in timing), and otherwise unpredictable. However, contemporary science does not explain the causes of these variations, and suffers from very poor forecasting accuracy. The objective of this research is to study the likely causes of the variations in demand quantity and from that understanding to develop forecasting methods which are more appropriate for the wearout characteristics and high reliability of many aircraft parts. As a first look at the problem, models of part failure are developed. These models are used to simulate multiple simultaneous parts operating identically. The simulations found that aircraft spare parts demands tend to be lumpy, and that this lumpiness tends to consist of two parts: a random element (called noise), and a cyclic element (called signal). These simulation results are compared to existing aircraft spare parts demand data, and similar <b>lumpy</b> <b>characteristics</b> are identified. The research then more deeply understands these elements of spare part demand lumpiness by developing equations explaining this lumpiness. These equations find that the same factors (quantity of parts operating simultaneously and reliability of those parts) both impact the average demand interval and the demand coefficients of variance, and that they impact these demand characteristics so similarly that demand lumpiness should be expected. Having determined that lumpiness is to be expected, the research proceeds to find forecasting methods that best account for this lumpiness. It is theorized that no one forecasting method would best account for signal lumpiness, noise lumpiness, and smooth demands; thus, the study develops a heuristic to select the best forecasting method based upon key part characteristics (reliability and quantity). The forecasting heuristic development uses Monte Carlo simulations to find ranges of part characteristics for which certain forecasting methods and parameters are most likely to provide the lowest error forecasts. Developing this forecasting method selection heuristic uncovers additional new and unique information, as follows: - The best error in many cases is 100 % error, showing the need to move beyond forecasting for inventory management of many parts. - The forecasting error computation method used by the forecasting professional strongly influences the selection of the best forecasting method. - Certain elementary forecasting methods (e. g. naive or always zero) produce lower errors than any complex methods in some aircraft parts management conditions. - The selection of forecasting method parameters {{is as important as the}} selection of forecasting methods. This dissertation makes an important and unique contribution to the science of aircraft spare parts forecasting in creating a method to develop heuristics to select the lowest error forecasting methods. However, this dissertation makes a simultaneously important contribution in developing the inherent limits of forecasting [...] ...|$|R
