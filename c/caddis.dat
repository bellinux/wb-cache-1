5|$|Hull Creek is a second-order stream {{with some}} {{wetlands}} in its watershed. Its relatively narrow watershed occupies parts of Scott Township, Blakely, Archbald, and Dickson City. Several flooding events have occurred on Hull Creek. The creek is {{designated as a}} Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. In 2013, it received a habitat assessment score of 159 {{on a scale of}} 0 to 200. Macroinvertebrate taxa such as mayflies (Ephemeroptera), stoneflies (Plecoptera), and <b>caddis</b> flies (Trichoptera) inhabit the creek as well.|$|E
5|$|During the {{breeding}} season, the ruff’s diet consists almost exclusively {{of the adults}} and larva of terrestrial and aquatic insects such as beetles and flies. On migration and during the winter, the ruff eats insects (including <b>caddis</b> flies, water-beetles, mayflies and grasshoppers), crustaceans, spiders, molluscs, worms, frogs, small fish, and also the seeds of rice and other cereals, sedges, grasses and aquatic plants. Migrating birds in Italy varied their diet according to what was available at each stopover site. Green aquatic plant material, spilt rice and maize, flies and beetles were found, along with varying amounts of grit. On the main wintering grounds in West Africa, rice is a favoured food during the later part of the season as the ricefields dry out.|$|E
50|$|On 21 February 2014, he was loaned to Championship club Birmingham City {{until the}} end of the season. He made 11 appearances, scored the opening goal from 20 yd in a 3-2 win at Millwall, and was {{involved}} in Paul <b>Caddis's</b> stoppage-time goal on the last day of the season that caused a 2-2 draw at Bolton Wanderers and saved Birmingham from relegation to League One.|$|R
50|$|Howard joined {{yet another}} Championship club, Birmingham City, in January 2014 {{until the end}} of the season. After making his debut in a 2-0 defeat at home to Yeovil Town, Howard's first goal for Birmingham, a 48th-minute flicked header from Paul <b>Caddis's</b> cross, opened the scoring at home to Derby County on 1 February; the match {{finished}} 3-3. He suffered a broken toe and ankle problems, and after just three more appearances, he was released when his contract expired.|$|R
50|$|On 31 January 2014, Mullins joined Notts County on loan {{until the}} end of the 2013-14 season. He made his debut the next day as a second-half {{substitute}} as County lost 2-0 away to Preston North End. With one match of County's season remaining, Mullins was recalled by Birmingham to cover for the injured Tom Thorpe. Playing at centre back, he made a crucial clearance in the final game, away at Bolton Wanderers, that contributed to Birmingham retaining their Championship status via Paul <b>Caddis's</b> stoppage-time equaliser. Birmingham confirmed he would be released when his contract expired at the end of the 2013-14 season. He finished his Birmingham career having scored twice in 39 appearances in all competitions.|$|R
5|$|Some animals {{actively}} seek to hide by decorating {{themselves with}} {{materials such as}} twigs, sand, or pieces of shell from their environment, to break up their outlines, to conceal the features of their bodies, and to match their backgrounds. For example, a <b>caddis</b> fly larva builds a decorated case and lives almost entirely inside it; a decorator crab covers its back with seaweed, sponges and stones. The nymph of the predatory masked bug uses its hind legs and a 'tarsal fan' to decorate its body with sand or dust. There are two layers of bristles (trichomes) over the body. On these, the nymph spreads an inner layer of fine particles and an outer layer of coarser particles. The camouflage may conceal the bug from both predators and prey.|$|E
5|$|Pallid {{sturgeon}} {{are generally}} bottom feeders, skimming the sandy {{reaches of the}} various rivers and streams in their habitat. Though {{little is known about}} the precise eating habits of the species, they are thought to be opportunistic feeders. One study which examined the contents from the stomachs of juvenile pallid sturgeon revealed that their diets were seasonally dependent. Various insects were consumed during some seasons and various fish species during others. These results support the description of the pallid sturgeon's eating habits as opportunistic. Fish is a more important dietary staple for pallid sturgeon than it is for shovelnose sturgeon. In one study comparing dietary tendencies between adult shovelnose sturgeon and immature pallid sturgeon, the pallid sturgeon was found to consume far greater numbers of small fish such as cyprinids (minnows). In another study conducted in the upper Missouri River region, an examination of the stomach contents of hatchery-reared pallid sturgeon showed that 82% of the wet weight was small fish and the balance was mosquito-like insects, mayflies, and <b>caddis</b> flies and small amounts of detritus and plant material.|$|E
5|$|The nymph is the {{dominant}} life history stage of the mayfly. Different insect species vary in their tolerance to water pollution, but in general, the larval stages of mayflies, stoneflies (Plecoptera) and <b>caddis</b> flies (Trichoptera) are susceptible {{to a number of}} pollutants including sewage, pesticides and industrial effluent. In general, mayflies are particularly sensitive to acidification, but tolerances vary, and certain species are exceptionally tolerant to heavy metal contamination and to low pH levels. Ephemerellidae are among the most tolerant groups and Siphlonuridae and Caenidae the least. The adverse effects on the insects of pollution may be either lethal or sub-lethal, in the latter case resulting in altered enzyme function, poor growth, changed behaviour or lack of reproductive success. As important parts of the food chain, pollution can cause knock-on effects to other organisms; a dearth of herbivorous nymphs can cause overgrowth of algae, and a scarcity of predacious nymphs can result in an over-abundance of their prey species. Fish that feed on mayfly nymphs that have bioaccumulated heavy metals are themselves at risk. Adult female mayflies find water by detecting the polarization of reflected light. They are easily fooled by other polished surfaces which can act as traps for swarming mayflies.|$|E
50|$|After conceding {{an early}} goal at {{previously}} unbeaten Charlton Athletic, strong performances from Davis and Reilly in midfield and Arthur in attack brought Birmingham {{back into the}} game. Arthur's goal was disallowed for offside against Donaldson - opinions varied {{as to whether he}} had interfered with play or whether he had indeed been in an offside position at all - but Davis's first goal for the club tied the scores. After a break for international matches, Birmingham lost 1-0 at home to Bolton Wanderers. Randolph was sent off for bringing down an opponent after <b>Caddis's</b> back pass had left him little alternative, and with all three substitutes already used, Lee Novak went in goal to face Craig Davies's penalty; Davies missed.|$|R
5000|$|Away to Burnley, Birmingham twice {{took the}} lead, first when Toral ran on to Donaldson's through ball and {{finished}} with a first-time shot {{from the edge of}} the penalty area, and then via <b>Caddis's</b> penalty, and Cotterill hit the post with a free kick, but with five minutes left, Matt Taylor's powerful free kick earned the hosts a point. Birmingham's penalty caused controversy: there seemed to be little contact by the defender on Donaldson, whose post-match claim that [...] "You get told if you get a slight touch go down" [...] prompted accusations of cheating. The visit to Brentford, scheduled for 18 August, was postponed six days before the scheduled date of 18 August because the hosts needed to re-lay the Griffin Park pitch on an emergency basis. Unusually, they agreed to reimburse supporters for non-refundable travel costs already incurred.|$|R

Yeung completed a takeover, and the team won a second League Cup, defeating favourites Arsenal 2–1 with goals from Nikola Žigić and Obafemi Martins, but league form collapsed, they were relegated, and McLeish resigned. With the club in financial turmoil after Yeung's arrest on charges of money laundering, Chris Hughton's team narrowly failed to reach the knockout rounds of the Europa League and the playoff final before he too quit. Under Lee Clark, Birmingham twice retained their divisional status, albeit needing Paul <b>Caddis's</b> 93rd-minute goal in the last match of 2013–14 to avoid relegation on goal difference.

50|$|Although Spector had {{hinted that}} he had been away from home and wider family long enough, and there was {{reported}} interest from Major League Soccer clubs, he confirmed {{that he and his wife}} felt settled in Birmingham, and signed a new two-year contract. He went through the 2015-16 season injury free. He alternated at starting center-back with the veteran Robinson, and although he enjoyed no more onfield time than in either of the preceding two seasons, he was almost ever-present in the matchday squad. After Rowett decided that Paul <b>Caddis's</b> fitness levels were too low, Spector began the 2016-17 season at right back. He continued in that position until and after Gianfranco Zolawho had managed Spector at West Hamreplaced Rowett in December. By January 2017, Spector had decided he wanted to return to the United States. With the emergence of Josh Dacres-Cogley, who played at right back while Spector served a suspension in November, and the arrival of Emilio Nsue, Zola felt able to accede to his request.|$|R

5|$|Unable {{to avoid}} relegation {{at the end}} of his first part-season, McLeish led the team back to the Premier League at the first attempt in 2009, then guided them to a 12-game unbeaten run, a club record in the top division, and a ninth-place finish, their best since 1959. McLeish led Birmingham to their first major trophy in 48 years, by beating Arsenal in the 2011 League Cup Final, then took them back to the second tier. Amid rumours of his being {{favourite}} for Aston Villa's managerial vacancy, McLeish resigned by email in June 2011. His successor, former Newcastle United manager Chris Hughton, led the club into the Europa League group stage, narrowly failed to qualify for the knockout rounds, and reached the play-off semi-finals. With the club in financial turmoil and under a transfer embargo, Hughton left for Premier League Norwich City. Lee Clark, dismissed by Huddersfield Town earlier in 2012, led Birmingham to a mid-table finish in his first season. They escaped relegation to the third tier on goal difference via Paul <b>Caddis's</b> stoppage-time equaliser at Bolton Wanderers in the last match of 2013–14, but continuing poor form, with only one home league win in more than a year, brought Clark's dismissal in October 2014.|$|R

Killen then started Celtic's following pre-season match against Tottenham Hotspur, and he opened the scoring in this match with a neat headed finish following a pinpoint cross by teammate Paul <b>Caddis.</b> A further goal against Manchester City ensured he finished pre-season with five goals in five games.

5000|$|After {{a weekend}} {{devoted to the}} third round of the FA Cup, league {{competition}} resumed with a Donaldson hat-trick against Wigan Athletic: a second-minute header from Cotterill's cross, a tap-in after Shinnie's shot hit the post, and a claim to the last touch on Gray's goalbound header. The 3-1 win left Birmingham in {{the top half of the}} table for the first time since the 2012-13 season. <b>Caddis's</b> early penalty after Donaldson was brought down looked like it would settle the game at Leeds United, but Marco Silvestri's goalkeeping helped Leeds come back into the match, and Luke Murphy equalised when the defence failed to clear a cross. Neither side coped well with a poor Sheffield Wednesday pitch, and what Rowett described as a [...] "fantastic, gritty performance and a very good clean sheet" [...] yielded a point. After fielding the same starting eleven for the previous seven league matches, there were two changes for the visit of Norwich City. One was enforced, Jonathan Spector replacing Morrison, who injured an ankle against Sheffield Wednesday, while loanee Lloyd Dyer came in for the rested Shinnie. Neither side could gain ascendancy in a tight match, and the Birmingham Mail reported that Gray, the subject of a series of rejected bids from divisional rivals Bournemouth ranging up to £5 million, [...] "struggled to emulate Shinnie's play-making ways".|$|R
5000|$|Having {{gone through}} November unbeaten, Birmingham began December without Shinnie, {{who had an}} ankle problem, and gave Lee Clark's new club, Blackpool, only their second win of the season. Rowett {{suggested}} that [...] "a lot of players were playing against their old manager and I think some of them expended a lot of nervous energy in getting up for the game and I don't think that helped them." [...] In contrast, Gray produced a first-half hat-trick at home to Reading, who were three points above them in the table. Rowett praised his [...] "clinical" [...] finishing and his positive response to teasing about his lack of goals. <b>Caddis's</b> powerful shot from Grounds' free kick opened the scoring, Shinnie added a fifth immediately after the interval with a low shot after a dribble from the right, and Cotterill's free kick from wide left that evaded everybody completed a 6-1 win. Nikola Žigić, who had re-signed for the club the previous week for {{a small fraction of}} his former salary, was a late substitute. A 1-0 win away to Huddersfield Town courtesy of another Cotterill free kick and some desperate stoppage-time defending preceded an [...] "uninspiring" [...] performance in a 4-0 reverse at home to fifth-placed Derby County in heavy Boxing-Day snow. Two days later, a 10-minute spell just before half-time containing two Cotterill free kicks, one touched in by Donaldson, and a defensive mistake gave Birmingham a three-goal lead, effectively securing their double over Nottingham Forest and taking them into the new year 11 points clear of the relegation places.|$|R

The only departure was England goalkeeper Jack Butland, who joined Stoke City for a fee considerably less than had been rejected the previous summer, but Birmingham were able to loan him back {{for the remainder of the}} season. A mid-table finish preceded a narrow escape from relegation to the third tier in 2014. Birmingham extended their winless run at home to a second-tier record of 18 games, and needed at least a point from the last match, away to Bolton Wanderers, and for other results to go in their favour. Two goals down after 76 minutes, a goal from Žigić and Paul <b>Caddis's</b> 93rd-minute headed equaliser combined with Doncaster losing was enough to avoid relegation on goal difference. Continued poor form, with only one home league win in more than a year, brought Clark's dismissal in October 2014. After a brief period of caretaker management, in which Birmingham equalled their club record home defeat by losing 8–0 to AFC Bournemouth, Burton Albion manager and former Birmingham player Gary Rowett took over with the team 23rd in the table, and led them to a tenth-place finish.
