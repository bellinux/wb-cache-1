40|$|Sustainability is {{a growing}} concern in a world where climate change threatens to inflict massive {{environmental}} and human damage in the coming decades. As climate change becomes a global issue, researchers and professionals from many pursuits are beginning to rally around the cause of bringing about an economically and environmentally sustainable future. Computer science and the related fields of human-computer interaction and interaction design have both a moral obligation and profound opportunity to contribute to environmental sustainability. In this thesis, I will examine the efforts of computer scientists and interaction designers in sustainability so far in order to form an understanding of what computer science has contributed to the effort of <b>curbing</b> <b>damage</b> to the environment to date. While the contributions of computer science and related fields to sustainability are significant, there are many ways in which they are deficient. Therefore, I will look to the future possibilities for academic and industrial developments and improvements in sustainable technology from the perspective of computer scientists and practitioners of related disciplines, and make recommendations as to the direction these fields should take in order to best serve the global thrust toward a sustainable human civilization...|$|E
40|$|Concepts for {{thoracic}} organ preservation {{involve a}} number of physical and chemical entities which act individually and in combination on the heart and lungs. This professorial dissertation presents evaluations of different cardioplegic concepts and examines the influence of temperature, hematocrit, calcium {{and the addition of}} L-arginin, as well as the direction and route of delivery of the preservation solution, on the protection of the lungs when organs are harvested for transplantation. It also considers the geometry of the left ventricle and its influence on the contractility of the heart and presents a clinical study comparing two cardioplegic concepts applied in patients suffering from cardiac ischemia with emergency indication for rapid coronary bypass revascularization. A good cardioplegic concept is characterized by precise control of cardiac arrest, reliable re-instigation of the heartbeat and effective cardioprotection of the myocytes and endothelial cells from ischemia and the consequences of reperfusion and reoxygenation subsequent to hypoxemia. Normothermia without ischemia or hypoxemia allows the continuation of cellular metabolism and facilitates metabolic repair mechanisms. Hypothermia reduces the metabolism, decreases the oxygen requirement of cells and can protect the heart against the consequences of ischemia. In an experimental study we were able to demonstrate that continuous coronary perfusion with cold blood results in ongoing cardioplegic arrest and achieves good cardiac protection. The hematocrit is mainly defined by the amount of hemoglobin (except when the blood is altered by oncologically malignant composition). Hemoglobin transports the largest proportion of oxygen in the blood stream {{and is one of the}} pillars of the puffer capacity of the blood. On extracorporeal circulation as little hemodilution as possible is important, with the aim of not decreasing the hematocrit. In our experimental study we demonstrated that a low hematocrit of 20 – 25 % during continuous artificial coronary perfusion nourishes the myocardium and is advantageous for cardioplegic arrest, in opposition to a high hematocrit of 40 – 45 %, which impairs cardiac function and promotes the development of cardiac edema. The cytoplasmatic content of calcium in combination with the other electrolytes enables the undulating contraction and relaxation of the cardiomyocytes. Cytoplasmatic overloading with calcium is the result in the etiology of cellular injury of many causes such as ischemia/reperfusion and reoxygenation after hypoxemia. This can lead to temporary hypercontraction, the development of stunning, or the formation of a stone heart. We demonstrated experimentally that hypocalcemia during reoxygenation following hypoxemia is advantageous in <b>curbing</b> <b>damage</b> to the heart and lungs, resulting in improved cardiac function and reduction of increased vascular resistance in the pulmonary vascular bed. The addition of amino acids to a blood cardioplegic solution augments its protective power. In particular glutamate and aspartate as contents of a blood cardioplegic solution support the metabolic and functional recovery of cardiomyocytes from ischemia/reperfusion. In an experimental study concerning cardiac ischemia, reperfusion and protection by blood cardioplegia we identified a gap in the protection for the endothelium. The addition of L-arginin to blood or to blood cardioplegia during the phase of reperfusion subsequent to ischemia protects cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells and improves their metabolic and functional recovery. Measures for organ preservation mainly determine the success of lung transplantation with regard to initial gas exchange, healing of the bronchus anastomoses and inhibition of the development of bronchiolitis obliterans. In order to achieve good organ preservation, complete perfusion of the lung parenchyma and bronchial tissue with the preservation solution is important. As vascular bed the pulmonary arteries, the pulmonary veins and the bronchial arteries are available. In an experimental study with different routes of delivery we demonstrated that the retrograde route of perfusion via the pulmonary veins leads to better perfusion of the lung and bronchial tissue than the antegrade route via the pulmonary arteries, and that atelectasis impairs perfusion of the lung parenchyma. The geometry of the left ventricle influences its pumping function. Enlargement of the left ventricle due to dilatation or the development of an aneurysm leads to spherical distension. In a further experimental study we demonstrated that spherical distension reduces the elasticity and contractility of the left ventricle, and that the subsequent reversal of the spherical distension and the restoration of an elliptical shape, with physiological diameter of the ventricle, improves the left ventricular elasticity and contractility. In a comparative clinical study the protective power of two different cardioplegic concepts was investigated. Patients with the indication for emergency coronary revascularization due to ischemic jeopardization of the heart were randomly divided into two groups in which different cardioplegic concepts were applied. One group of patients was operated on using crystalloid cardioplegia with Kirsch/HAES solution and the second group with blood cardioplegia following Buckberg’s concept. Both cardioplegic concepts were efficient in making the hearts stop beating and relax. Patients who received Buckberg’s blood cardioplegia performed better postoperatively than those with Kirsch/HAES solution in terms of regional contractility, expression of cardiac enzymes and signals for ischemia on the electrocardiogram. This difference was larger for patients in cardiogenic shock. The choice of cardioplegia did not show a sharp difference in clinical outcome between the two groups of patients: mortality, duration of intensive care unit stay and the number of days on mechanical ventilation were without significant differences between the two groups, but with a tendency towards faster recovery in the group operated on using Buckberg’s blood cardioplegia. Patients of the Buckberg’s blood cardioplegia group without signs of cardiac shock required significantly less hemodynamic support with catecholamines and intraaortic balloon counterpulsation. Also, significantly fewer blood transfusions were administered after Buckberg’s blood cardioplegia...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Literature {{relevant}} to tree root and urban infrastructure conflicts is reviewed. Although tree roots can conflict with many infrastructure elements, sidewalk and curb conflicts {{are the focus}} of this review. Construction protocols, urban soils, root growth, and causal factors (soil conditions, limited planting space, tree size, variation in root architecture, management practices, and construction materials) are discussed. Because costs related to sidewalk and <b>curb</b> <b>damage</b> are substantial, a review of research addressing repair, mitigation, prevention, and litigation costs is included. Finally, future research needs are discussed. Potential for conflicts between trees and sidewalks/curbs is high when {{one or more of these}} factors are present: tree species that are large at maturity, fast growing trees, trees planted in restricted soil volumes, shallow top soil (hard-pan underneath top-soil), shallow foundations underneath the sidewalk (limited or no base materials), shallow irrigation, distances between the tree and sidewalk of less than 2. 0 – 3. 0 m., trees greater than 15 to 20 years old. The results of this survey indicate that cities are spending substantial sums of money to address conflicts between street tree roots and infrastructure. It can be inferred that most of these expenditures are spent dealing with problems that already exist. However, this raises the question: How much is being spent now to ensure that conflicts are minimized in the future...|$|R

To <b>curb</b> further <b>damage</b> to the environment, SUA initiated the Uluguru Mountain Integrated Soil Conservation Project (UMISCP). Farmers from two villages were involved from the beginning in carrying out rehabilitation and land management activities.

However, Gair was regarded as too liberal to gain majority support within the party. The dissidents eventually decided to encourage Brian Talboys, the party's deputy leader, to make a leadership bid (now called the [...] "Colonels' Coup"). Gair was not involved in planning this bid, but was supportive of it, and worked hard to convince Talboys that a challenge was a good idea. In the end, however, Talboys bailed out, and the coup collapsed without a vote ever being taken. Gair continued to advocate a challenge, but Talboys was adamant that preserving party unity was more important than <b>curbing</b> Muldoon's <b>damaging</b> leadership style. Later, after Talboys had retired from politics, Gair supported another Muldoon opponent, Derek Quigley, to replace Talboys as deputy leader.|$|R
40|$|In {{response}} to concerns that jury awards in tort cases are excessive and unpredictable, nearly every state legislature has enacted {{some version of}} tort reform that is intended to <b>curb</b> extravagant <b>damage</b> awards. One {{of the most important}} and controversial reforms involves capping (or limiting) the maximum punitive damage award. We conducted a jury analogue study {{to assess the impact of}} this reform. In particular, we examined the possibility that capping punitive awards would cause jurors to inflate their compensatory awards to satisfy their desires to punish the defendant, particularly in situations where the defendant’s conduct was highly reprehensible. Relative to a condition in which punitive damages were unlimited, caps on punitive damages did not result in inflation of compensatory awards. However, jurors who had no option to award punitive damages assessed compensatory damages at a significantly higher level than did jurors who had the opportunity to do so. We discuss the policy implications of these findings...|$|R
5000|$|Secondary {{prevention}} {{deals with}} latent diseases {{and attempts to}} prevent an asymptomatic disease from progressing to symptomatic disease. Certain diseases can be classified as primary or secondary. This depends on definitions {{of what constitutes a}} disease, though, in general, primary prevention addresses the root cause of a disease or injury whereas secondary prevention aims to detect and treat a disease early on. Secondary prevention consists of [...] "early diagnosis and prompt treatment" [...] to contain the disease and prevent its spread to other individuals, and [...] "disability limitation" [...] to prevent potential future complications and disabilities from the disease. For example, early diagnosis and prompt treatment for a syphilis patient would include a course of antibiotics to destroy the pathogen and screening and treatment of any infants born to syphilitic mothers. Disability limitation for syphilitic patients includes continued check-ups on the heart, cerebrospinal fluid, and central nervous system of patients to <b>curb</b> any <b>damaging</b> effects such as blindness or paralysis.|$|R

40|$|Almost {{thirty years}} ago, Harold Proshansky argued that if {{environmental}} psychology was to survive, {{it needed to}} “strengthen itself as a social institution”. While we can find much {{evidence to suggest that}} environmental psychology has achieved this, in so doing it has tended to concentrate on changes to individual consumption behaviours and lifestyles, rather than focusing on the everyday lives and conditions which frame the actions of individuals and communities. People live, work, and act in cooperation with others and this cooperation is shaped by and shapes individual and collective identities and actions. One of the central places where people act collectively is the workplace. Two case studies are presented. The first employed backcasting scenarios to explore employees’ visions for an alternative, sustainable future and involved scenario development by creating visions for the future, defining strategic pathways to reach them, providing feedback on how policy measures would function in a simulated environment and asking participants to suggest corrections to their initial proposals and the model design. The second case study reports on an international study of the role of trade unions in contributing to environmentally sustainable production and <b>curbing</b> the <b>damaging</b> effects of climate change. It sets this in a global context, because the causes and consequences of climate change have to be seen in such terms. This then leads to the final part of the chapter, which raises important issues about the ‘production’ of environmental psychology and North-South relationships...|$|R
40|$|The {{widespread}} {{acceptance of}} the government 2 ̆ 7 s role in providing environmental information {{is based on a}} presumption that providing this information will lead to an improvement in environmental quality. While some empirical studies and anecdotal evidence have linked information disclosure with improved environmental performance, there have been few theoretical analyses examining this presumption. There has also not been a clear distinction between the impacts of disclosure on environmental performance per unit of output vs. its impact on aggregate environmental quality. The purpose of this dissertation is to address these issues. The objective is to examine the role of information disclosure as a policy tool to <b>curb</b> environmental <b>damage</b> where consumers care for environment. The research presented here enriches the growing literature on information disclosure as regulatory policy by bringing in consumers in the above pool of stakeholders. Drawing on the literature on vertical product differentiation yields an innovative methodology with applications in environmental and regulatory economics. Our findings suggest that government information disclosure programs not only affect the products 2 ̆ 7 environmental features but also consumers 2 ̆ 7 allocation in the market. Together, these two effects may cause pollution to increase even for increasing number of informed consumers. The research presented here also expands the growing intersection between environmental economics and public economics by analyzing the effect of a Performance Management Program on cleaning up of the Charles River. A point is being made on the usefulness of informal policies like EMS and information disclosure in regulating non point sources, when traditional regulatory policies seem ineffective. ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Perspectives {{based on}} race or essentialized notions of {{ethnicity}} have had remarkable resilience {{in the study of}} Malaysia despite their rather dubious use. Undoubtedly, a racialized polity has arisen {{as a result of the}} preferential treatment given to those classified under the nativistic politico-legal category Bumiputera (indigene). Boundaries are nevertheless more permeable than often admitted by politicians. By turning to the case of Indian Malaysians, I explore how the dominance of racialized perspectives in public discourse in Malaysia renders inconsequential if not invisible the rich and complex interaction between different ethnic groups. I show how dominant representations of Indian Malaysians obscure the significant and distinctive efforts of popular musicians. The state, opposition politicians, and nongovernment organizations tend to represent Indians as a singularly disempowered minority. This concurrence of views affirms the racialized political and social order and diminishes the potential alternatives, if not the challenges, posed by transethnic, hybrid, and other forms of cultural politics. The complexity of Indianness and, indeed, ofMalaysian society resists racialized perspectives. This becomes especially clear when we turn to the cultural politics of popular music in Peninsular Malaysia. Young musicians produce work in the genres of rock, hip-hop, reggae, and so forth in Tamil—the most commonly spoken language of Indian origin—as well as in other Malaysian languages. An admixture of rebellion and commercial drive colors their efforts as they capitalize on the enabling aspects of globalization while trying to <b>curb</b> its <b>damaging</b> consequences. As a result of their exposure to—if not familiarity with—different cultures and languages, and through contact, exchange and partnership with musicians of other ethnic backgrounds, Indian Malaysians have forged a distinct musical identity...|$|R
40|$|LL. M. (Banking Law) Abstract: The parol {{evidence}} rule applies to contracts where the {{agreement between the}} parties has been integrated into a single and complete written memorial. The theoretical foundation of the {{parol evidence}} rule lies in the purported fact that the parties have integrated their agreement in a document that is a full and final crystallisation of their consensus. Extrinsic evidence such as evidence of prior negotiations and antecedent contracts is therefore deemed irrelevant and misleading. Admission of prior negotiations and antecedent contracts is, however, an instrumental tool which can assist the courts in determining {{the true nature of}} a commercial transaction between the contracting parties. This dissertation seeks to explore the relationship between contract law and commercial practice and, more specifically, the parol evidence rule in the interpretation of contracts and the utilization of the concept of commercial expectations of the parties to a contract in the interpretation of contracts. The further aim of this dissertation is to explore the reconcilability or irreconcilability of the principles of interpretation utilised by the courts with the expectations of commercial practice. A comparative study will be undertaken between the South African Law of contract and the Canadian Law of contract. The relevant case law in each jurisdiction will be discussed and attempts will be made to analyse the similarities and disparities between the two jurisdictions. Ultimately, this dissertation seeks to answer this question: Does the parol evidence rule hinder or advance the commercial expectations of contracting parties in South Africa and Canada? This dissertation found that efforts have been made by the South African courts to <b>curb</b> the <b>damage</b> that may arise due to strict implementation of the parol evidence rule by moving away from the strict formalistic approach to the interpretation of contracts by adopting a more contextual approach. The Canadian courts have over the years developed and adopted rules which are geared towards mitigating the harm that may result from a strict interpretation and thereby hinder the commercial expectations of contracting parties in Canada...|$|R
5000|$|Denver {{windmill}} {{was built}} in 1835, replacing an earlier post mill which was marked on the 1824 Ordnance Survey map. The mill was built for John Porter and the tower bears a datestone with the legend JMP 1835. A steam mill had been erected at Denver windmill by 1863, powered by a [...] engine. This drove three pairs of millstones, as did the windmill.In 1896, James Gleaves made a Deed of Assignment and the mill was offered for sale by auction at the Crown Hotel, Downham Market but was withdrawn from sale at the auction. The mill was later bought by Thomas Harris, who had previously run the post mill at Southery. On 22 February 1908, the mill was damaged in a gale and put out of action. Thomas Harris died in 1925 and left the mill to his son Thomas, who continued to work it by wind and a diesel engine, which had replaced the earlier steam engine. The mill's centenary was celebrated with a supper on 10 January 1936. In December 1937, Thomas Harris was awarded a certificate by the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings. The mill was struck by lightning in 1939 and a sail was damaged, but this was repaired. In 1941, the <b>curb</b> was <b>damaged,</b> ending the use of wind power. Milling continued by a Blackstone diesel engine until 1969 when Thomas Harris died. The mill passed to his sister, Edith Staines, who offered the mill to Norfolk County Council on condition that they covered the legal fees. In July 1972, a sail was blown off in a gale, damaging the stage as it fell. The opposite sail was removed leaving the mill with {{a single pair of}} sails. The Deed of Gift was signed on 20 August 1973. Restoration work to the cap, gallery, sails and fantail was carried out by millwrights John Lawn and Philip Lennard in the winter of 1974-75.|$|R
40|$|Gamma {{radiation}} {{is widely used}} to sterilize bone allografts but may impair their strength. While radioprotectant use may reduce radiation damage they may compromise sterility by protecting pathogens. We assessed the radioprotective potential of various agents (L-cysteine, N-acetyl-L-cysteine, L-cysteine-ethyl-ester and L-cysteine-methyl-ester) to identify those which do not protect spores of Bacillus subtilis. We hypothesized charge of these agents will affect their ability to radioprotect spores. We also determined ability of these radioprotectants and a radiosensitizer (nitroimidazole-linked phenanthridinium) to selectively sensitize spores to radiation damage by intercalating into the nucleic acid of spores. Spores were treated either directly in solutions of these agents or treated after being embedded and sealed in bone to assess the ability of these agents to diffuse into bone. L-cysteine and L-cysteine-ethyl-ester did not provide radioprotection. Positively charged L-cysteine-methyl-ester protected the spores, whereas positively charged L-cysteine-ethyl-ester did not, indicating charge does not {{determine the extent of}} radioprotection. The spores were sensitized to radiation damage when irradiated in nitroimidazole-linked phenanthridinium solution and sensitization disappeared after rinsing, suggesting nitroimidazole-linked phenanthridinium was unable to intercalate into the nucleic acid of the spores. Some cysteine-derived radioprotectants do not shield bacterial spores against gamma radiation and may be suitable for <b>curbing</b> the radiation <b>damage</b> to bone grafts while achieving sterility...|$|R
