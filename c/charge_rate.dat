This work is a post-mortem study of 18650 -type cells subjected to <b>charge</b> <b>rates</b> of 0. 7 -, 2 -, 4 -, and 6 -C. For cells charged at 0. 7 -C to 4 -C, this performance degradation is primarily related to surface film thickness with no observable change in surface film chemical composition. However, at <b>charge</b> <b>rates</b> of 6 -C, the chemical composition of the surface film changes significantly, suggesting that this change {{is the reason for}} the sharper increase in cell resistance compared to the lower <b>charge</b> <b>rates.</b> In addition, we found that surface film formation was not uniform across the electrode. Surface film was thicker and chemically different along the central band of the electrode “jelly roll”. This result is most likely attributable to an increase in temperature that results from non-uniform electrode wetting during manufacture. This non-uniform change further resulted in active material delamination from the current collector owing to chemical changes to the binder for the cell charged at 6 -C...|$|R

However, even a small temperature differential across cell thickness at the cell level can contribute to significant temperature differential in the thickness direction of stacked-up Li-Ion cells at the module level. Such temperature differential can potentially impact the battery charging control system, especially at high <b>charging</b> <b>rates.</b> Here, the thermal-electrochemical partial differential and algebraic equations for a Li-ion cell are solved via a spatial finite difference method.
