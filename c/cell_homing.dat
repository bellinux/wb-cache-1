The present {{study was conducted in}} order to phenotypically characterize cells in human thoracic duct lymph of patients under non-inflammatory and inflammatory conditions. These data were compared with data from peripheral blood, with special emphasis on those <b>cells</b> <b>homing</b> to the gut. Thoracic duct lymph and peripheral blood contained comparable proportions of B and T lymphocytes and CD 8 + cells. Thoracic duct lymph contained proportionally more CD 4 + cells, more CD 4 +CD 45 RO+ that express alpha 4 beta 7 cells and more CD 8 +CD 45 RO+ that express alpha 4 beta 7, as compared to peripheral blood. These data suggest an equal recirculation rate of B and T lymphocytes; a more active recirculation of CD 4 + cells compared to CD 8 + cells; and a more active recirculation of memory cells to the gut as compared to other extra-lymphoid sites in patients under non-inflammatory conditions. Data were also obtained in patients with the system inflammatory response syndrome and multiple organ failure. Although it is generally assumed that granulocytes and monocytes do not recirculate, lymph of multiple organ failure patients contained significantly more granulocytes than monocytes, indicating that in severe generalized inflammatory states these cells re-enter the circulation through the thoracic duct.

However, the proper functioning of CXCR 4 downstream signaling depends upon consistent optimal expression of both SDF- 1 ligand and its receptor CXCR 4, {{which in turn is}} variable and regulated by several factors. The constitutive active mutants of CXCR 4 (N 119 A and N 119 S) being able to induce autonomous downstream signaling, overcome the limitation of ligand-receptor interaction for induction of CXCR 4 signaling. Therefore, we intended to explore their potential in chemotaxis; a key cellular process which crucially regulates <b>cells</b> <b>homing</b> to bone marrow.

40|$|The {{predominant}} {{approach for}} {{cartilage tissue engineering}} involves cell transplantation with or without cytokine delivery, biomaterial scaffolds, bioreactors, applied mechanical stimulation and altered oxygen tension. Despite its scientific merit, cell delivery faces drawbacks including scarce cell availability, donor site trauma, possible immune rejection and potential tumorigenesis. Tissue regeneration by <b>cell</b> <b>homing</b> is a novel concept and may offer the advantage of accelerated clinical translation. Promising results have been shown using a <b>cell</b> <b>homing</b> approach to engineer a number of tissue types including dental pulp, vascular tissue and bone. Various stem/progenitor cell populations are present in tissues adjacent to an articular cartilage defect including subsets of cells that {{have the ability to}} differentiate into cartilage-like tissue. Furthermore, several factors have been elucidated that stimulate stem/progenitor <b>cell</b> <b>homing</b> and selected cytokines have been discovered to be potent at inducing chondrogenic differentiation of stem/progenitor cells. <b>Cell</b> <b>homing</b> is an exciting area of regenerative medicine but many critical questions remain such as cell origin, homing distance, and effective chemotactic cues. In addition to currently studied <b>cell</b> <b>homing</b> cues, other cytokines present during inflammation that are not typically known for their homing abilities might be helpful in recruiting additional cells to the scaffold and improving the quality of cartilage tissue formation. The effect of concurrently exposing a cell population to multiple cytokine signals, similar to conditions that cells experience in vivo, has not been fully investigated. Determining which cytokine or groups of cytokines that induce high levels of chemotaxis would be critical for designing effective bioactive scaffolds for cell recruitment and chondrogenesis. This thesis develops novel systems to characterize stem/progenitor cell migration and uses the knowledge gained from these systems to develop new methods for inducing chondrogenesis by cytotactic homing. First, the concept of stem/progenitor <b>cell</b> <b>homing</b> for cartilage tissue regeneration is reviewed (Chapter 1). Next, a system was developed for the in vitro recruitment and chondrogenesis of Adipose Stem Cells (ASCs), Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) and Synovium Stem Cells (SSCs), all of which are natively located adjacent to a full-thickness articular cartilage defect (Chapter 2). Using microfluidic principles, novel assay systems were designed and built to characterize the process of stem cell migration in the presence of single and competing cytokine signals (Chapter 3). An in-depth study was conducted investigating the process of stem/progenitor cell migration in the presence of competing cytokine signals (Chapter 4). Lastly, the knowledge gained through extensive chemokine testing using these novel assay systems was used to develop a bioactive scaffold to induce <b>cell</b> <b>homing</b> and chondrogenesis for rhinoplasty augmentation in a rat model (Chapter 5). The novel migration devices developed herein offer a rare opportunity for screening of <b>cell</b> <b>homing</b> efficacy, potentially applicable to any stem cell population including embryonic, iPS, skeletal, muscular, neural, cardiac and adipose. A number of basic biological concepts have been examined by studies using these devices such as cell motility behavior and optimal migratory distances. The competitive cytotactic assay system provided new insight into stem cell behavior in response to gradients of multiple cytotactic cues, thus mimicking native in vivo conditions. By determining combinations of cytokines effective at maximizing <b>cell</b> <b>homing,</b> novel approaches for cartilage tissue engineering without the need for cell delivery, were developed for rhinoplasty augmentation. These systems for inducing chondrogenesis by chemotactic homing were shown to be an effective alternative to cell transplantation for cartilage tissue regeneration therapies...|$|E
40|$|ObjectivesThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the role of plasminogen (Plg) in stem cell–mediated cardiac repair and regeneration after myocardial infarction (MI). BackgroundAn MI induces irreversible tissue damage, eventually leading to heart failure. Bone marrow (BM) –derived stem cells promote tissue repair and regeneration after MI. Thrombolytic treatment with Plg activators significantly improves the clinical outcome in MI by restoring cardiac perfusion. However, the role of Plg in stem cell–mediated cardiac repair remains unclear. MethodsAn MI was induced in Plg-deficient (Plg−/−) and wild-type (Plg+/+) mice by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Stem cells were visualized by in vivo tracking of green fluorescent protein (GFP) -expressing BM cells after BM transplantation. Cardiac function, stem <b>cell</b> <b>homing,</b> and signaling pathways downstream of Plg were examined. ResultsGranulocyte colony-stimulating factor, a stem cell mobilizer, significantly promoted BM-derived stem cell (GFP+c-kit+ cell) recruitment into the infarcted heart and stem cell–mediated cardiac repair in Plg+/+ mice. However, Plg deficiency markedly inhibited stem <b>cell</b> <b>homing</b> and cardiac repair, suggesting that Plg is critical for stem cell–mediated cardiac repair. Moreover, Plg regulated C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR 4) expression in stem cells in vivo and in vitro through matrix metalloproteinase- 9. Lentiviral reconstitution of CXCR 4 expression in BM cells successfully rescued stem <b>cell</b> <b>homing</b> to the infarcted heart in Plg-deficient mice, indicating that CXCR 4 has a critical role in Plg-mediated stem <b>cell</b> <b>homing</b> after MI. ConclusionsThese findings have identified a novel role for Plg in stem cell–mediated cardiac repair after MI. Thus, targeting Plg may offer a new therapeutic strategy for stem cell–mediated cardiac repair after MI...|$|E

OT-I cells accumulated in the draining lymph nodes (LN) of the kidneys and pancreas and in no other LN. They displayed an activated phenotype and a proportion entered cell cycle. Unilateral nephrectomy 7 - 13 d before inoculation of OT-I cells into RIP-mOVA mice allowed the injected T cells to home only to the regional LN of the remaining kidney (and pancreas), but when the operation was performed 4 h before injecting the T <b>cells,</b> <b>homing</b> to the LN of the excised kidney was evident.

In addition, pulp-like tissues could be formed with the apical foramen less than 1 mm, although more studies are needed to determine the appropriate size. Moreover, signaling molecules including stromal cell derived factor (SDF- 1 α), basic Fibroblast Growth Factor (bFGF), Platelet Derived Growth Factor (PDGF), stem cell factor (SCF), and Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor (G-CSF) were used to achieve pulp-like tissue formation via a <b>cell</b> <b>homing</b> strategy.
