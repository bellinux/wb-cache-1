5|$|Strong {{partisan}} disagreement in Congress prevented {{adjustments to}} the Act's provisions. However, at least one change, a proposed repeal of a tax on medical devices, has received bipartisan support. Some <b>Congressional</b> <b>Republicans</b> argued against improvements to the law on the grounds they would weaken the arguments for repeal.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{implemented}} his own form of Presidential Reconstruction– {{a series}} of proclamations directing the seceded states to hold conventions and elections to re-form their civil governments. When Southern states returned many of their old leaders, and passed Black Codes to deprive the freedmen of many civil liberties, <b>Congressional</b> <b>Republicans</b> refused to seat legislators from those states and advanced legislation to overrule the Southern actions. Johnson vetoed their bills, and <b>Congressional</b> <b>Republicans</b> overrode him, setting a pattern {{for the remainder of}} his presidency. Johnson opposed the Fourteenth Amendment, which gave citizenship to former slaves. In 1866, Johnson went on an unprecedented national tour promoting his executive policies, seeking to destroy his Republican opponents. As the conflict between the branches of government grew, Congress passed the Tenure of Office Act, restricting Johnson's ability to fire Cabinet officials. When he persisted in trying to dismiss Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, he was impeached by the House of Representatives, and narrowly avoided conviction in the Senate and removal from office. After failing to win the 1868 Democratic presidential nomination, Johnson left office in 1869.|$|E

5|$|Although <b>congressional</b> <b>Republicans</b> {{had opposed}} Clinton's Deficit Reduction Act of 1993, a key {{aspect of the}} 1994 Contract with America was {{the promise of a}} {{balanced}} federal budget. After the end of the government shutdown, Gingrich and other Republican leaders acknowledged that Congress {{would not be able to}} draft a balanced budget in 1996. Instead, they opted to approve some small reductions that were already approved by the White House and to wait until the next election season.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, {{criticism}} {{over the}} Johnson Administration's {{handling of the}} Vietnam War began to grow, with Ford and <b>Congressional</b> <b>Republicans</b> expressing concern that the United States was not doing what was necessary to win the war. Public sentiment also began to move against Johnson, and the 1966 midterm elections saw a 47-seat swing {{in favor of the}} Republicans. This was not enough to give Republicans a majority in the House, but the victory gave Ford the opportunity to prevent the passage of further Great Society programs.|$|E
5|$|Patton's opponent, Republican Larry Forgy, {{hurt his}} {{campaign}} by aligning {{himself with the}} Christian right, alienating moderates in both parties, particularly in Louisville. He also openly opposed the Kentucky Education Reform Act (KERA), passed in 1990 during the administration of Wallace G. Wilkinson. Republican supporters of education reform deserted his campaign and helped form a bi-partisan coalition supporting KERA. Traditional Democratic voting blocs such as organized labor and African-Americans turned out in force for Patton. To further undermine Forgy, Patton reminded voters of the budget cuts by <b>Congressional</b> <b>Republicans</b> to programs affecting the elderly. These issues ultimately delivered a Patton victory of 500,787votes to 479,227. It was the closest Kentucky gubernatorial election in 32years, and {{marked the first time}} an eastern Kentuckian had won the governorship since Bert T. Combs in 1959.|$|E

5|$|Before the 2006 election, Hastert {{expressed}} his intent to seek reelection as Speaker if the Republicans maintained {{control of the}} House. Hastert was reelected for an eleventh term to his seat in the House with nearly 60 percent of the vote, but that year the Republicans lost control of both the Senate and the House to the Democrats following a wave of voter discontent with the Iraq War, the Federal response to Hurricane Katrina, {{and a series of}} scandals among <b>congressional</b> <b>Republicans.</b> The day after the November election, Hastert announced he would not seek to become minority leader when the 110th Congress convened in January 2007. Later that month, John Boehner of Ohio defeated Mike Pence of Indiana in a 168-27 vote of the House Republican Conference election to become minority leader for the 110th Congress. The House Democratic Caucus unanimously selected House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi to be Speaker (succeeding Hastert) for the 110th Congress.|$|E
5|$|When the 39th Congress {{assembled}} in December 1865, Hayes {{was sworn in}} {{as a part of a}} large Republican majority. Hayes identified with the moderate wing of the party, but was willing to vote with the radicals for the sake of party unity. The major legislative effort of the Congress was the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, for which Hayes voted and which passed both houses of Congress in June 1866. Hayes's beliefs were in line with his fellow Republicans on Reconstruction issues: that the South should be restored to the Union, but not without adequate protections for freedmen and other black southerners. President Andrew Johnson, who succeeded to office following Lincoln's assassination, to the contrary wanted to re-admit the seceded states quickly without first ensuring that they adopted laws protecting the newly freed slaves' civil rights; he also granted pardons to many of the leading former Confederates. Hayes, along with <b>congressional</b> <b>Republicans,</b> disagreed. They worked to reject Johnson's vision of Reconstruction and to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1866.|$|E

25|$|Historically, the {{district}} has been friendly territory for <b>congressional</b> <b>Republicans,</b> though Marilyn Musgrave only narrowly won in 2004 and 2006 due to her Democratic opponents' strength in Fort Collins.

In 2008, Musgrave lost reelection to Betsy Markey, the first Democrat to be elected by the 4th District since the early 1970s.|$|E
25|$|Since 1990, Christopher Shays {{has voted}} with the Republican {{majority}} 76.8% {{of the time}}, voted with the Democratic majority 57.9% {{of the time and}} missed 2.5% of the votes. U.S. News & World Report said that analysis of Shays' voting record reveals that he is a moderate, having voted historically more often with liberals than with conservatives, although it noted he voted with <b>Congressional</b> <b>Republicans</b> 80% of the time in 2002.|$|E

25|$|The GPA {{is funded}} by the federal welfare reform act of 1996. According to Richey, <b>congressional</b> <b>Republicans</b> knew that Clinton would sign the welfare-reform measure; so they {{attached}} a bill to create an abstinence-only education program and authorized its funding with $250 million over five years. The Louisiana program was a national model acclaimed by Focus on the Family and other pro-family organizations. The 36-week program stresses awareness of sexuality, education, behavioral changes, and physical and emotional health.|$|E
25|$|Shortly after Obama's 2012 re-election, <b>Congressional</b> <b>Republicans</b> and Obama again faced {{off over}} the final fate of the Bush tax cuts. Republicans sought to make all tax cuts permanent, while Obama sought to extend the tax cuts only for those making under $250,000. Obama and <b>Congressional</b> <b>Republicans</b> came to an {{agreement}} on the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which made permanent the tax cuts for individuals making less than $400,000 a year (or less than $450,000 for couples). For earnings greater than that amount, the income tax increased from 35% to 39.6%, which was the top rate before {{the passage of the}} Bush tax cuts. The deal also permanently indexed the alternative minimum tax for inflation, limited deductions for individuals making more than $250,000 ($300,000 for couples), permanently set the estate tax exemption at $5.12 million (indexed to inflation), and increased the top estate tax rate from 35% to 40%. Though many Republicans did not like the deal, the bill passed the Republican House in large part {{due to the fact that}} the failure to pass any bill would have resulted in the total expiration of the Bush tax cuts.|$|E
25|$|In {{his second}} term, Obama {{took steps to}} combat climate change, signing a major {{international}} climate agreement and an executive order to limit carbon emissions. Obama also presided over {{the implementation of the}} Affordable Care Act and other legislation passed in his first term, and he negotiated rapprochements with Iran and Cuba. The number of American soldiers in Afghanistan fell dramatically during Obama's second term, though U.S. soldiers remained in Afghanistan throughout Obama's presidency. Republicans took control of the Senate after the 2014 elections, and Obama continued to grapple with <b>Congressional</b> <b>Republicans</b> over government spending, immigration, judicial nominations, and other issues.|$|E

25|$|During Reconstruction, President Johnson {{appointed}} Schofield {{to serve}} as military governor of Virginia and of the First Military District. Thus, he oversaw the elections (in which blacks and whites voted) {{which resulted in the}} Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1868. When Radicals took over that convention and proposed to disenfranchise former Confederates Schoefield voiced concerns about corruption to Congress as well as his commander, General Ulysses Grant. Schofield's position was of high importance and sensitivity, due to the region's proximity to Washington as well as Confederate President Jefferson Davis's incarceration in Norfolk and awaiting trial under Judge John Curtiss Underwood, who chaired the Constitutional Convention and had close links with <b>Congressional</b> <b>Republicans.</b>|$|E
25|$|Obama's first-term actions {{addressed}} {{the global financial}} crisis and included a major stimulus package, a partial extension of the Bush tax cuts, legislation to reform health care, a major financial regulation reform bill, {{and the end of}} a major US military presence in Iraq. Obama also appointed Supreme Court Justices Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor, the latter of whom became the first Hispanic American on the Supreme Court. Democrats controlled both houses of Congress until Republicans won a majority in the House of Representatives in the 2010 elections. Following the elections, Obama and <b>Congressional</b> <b>Republicans</b> engaged in a protracted stand-off over government spending levels and the debt ceiling.|$|E
25|$|In the November 2005 off-year elections, New York City, Republican mayoral {{candidate}} Michael Bloomberg won {{a landslide}} re-election, the fourth straight Republican victory {{in what is}} otherwise a Democratic stronghold. In California, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger failed {{in his effort to}} use the ballot initiative to enact laws the Democrats blocked in the state legislature. Scandals prompted the resignations of <b>Congressional</b> <b>Republicans</b> House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, Duke Cunningham, Mark Foley and Bob Ney. In the 2006 midterm elections, the Republicans lost control of both the House of Representatives and Senate to the Democrats in what was widely interpreted as a repudiation of the administration's war policies. Exit polling suggested that corruption was a key issue for many voters. Soon after the elections, Donald Rumsfeld resigned as secretary of defense to be replaced by Bob Gates.|$|E
