In the organizational world companies plan their annual strategy and they are approved the first of June by the boards of directors. However, competitors do not act according to that proposed schedule or based on that planned strategy, neither do they wait for the board's approval.

50|$|Some {{hard disk}} drives simply fail because of worn out parts, others fail prematurely. Drive {{manufacturers}} typically specify a {{mean time between}} failures (MTBF) or an annualized failure rate (AFR) which are population statistics that <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>predict</b> the behavior of an individual unit. These are calculated by constantly running samples of the drive for a short amount of time, analyzing the resultant wear and tear upon the physical components of the drive, and extrapolating to provide a reasonable estimate of its lifespan. Hard disk drive failures tend to follow the concept of the bathtub curve. Drives typically fail within a short time if there is a defect present from manufacturing. If a drive proves reliable for a period of a few months after installation, the drive has a significantly greater chance of remaining reliable. Therefore, even if a drive is subjected to several years of heavy daily use, it may not show any notable signs of wear unless closely inspected. On the other hand, a drive can fail at any time in many different situations.|$|E
50|$|Carr emphatically {{contended that}} history {{was a social}} science, not an art. Carr argued that history should be {{considered}} a social science because historians like scientists seek generalizations that helped to broaden the understanding of one's subject. Carr used the example of the word revolution, arguing that if the word did not have a specific meaning that it would make no sense for historians to write of revolutions, even though every revolution that occurred in history was in its own way unique. Moreover, Carr claimed that historical generalisations were often related to lessons to be learned from other historical occurrences. Since in Carr's view, lessons can be sought and learned in history, then history was more like a science than any art. Though Carr conceded that historians <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>predict</b> exact events in the future, he argued that historical generalisations can supply information useful to understanding both the present and the future. Carr argued that since scientists are not purely neutral observers, but have a reciprocal relationship with the objects under their study just like historians, that this supported identifying history with the sciences rather than the arts. Likewise, Carr contended that history, like science, has no moral judgments, which in his opinion, supports the identification of history as a science.|$|E
5000|$|The {{foundations}} of the APT tax proposal - a small, uniform tax on all economic transactions - involve simplification, base broadening, reductions in marginal tax rates, the elimination of tax and information returns and the automatic collection of tax revenues at the payment source. The APT approach would extend the tax base from income, consumption and wealth to all transactions. Proponents regard it as a revenue neutral transactions tax, whose tax base is primarily made up of financial transactions. The APT tax extends the tax reform ideas of John Maynard Keynes, James Tobin [...] and Lawrence Summers, [...] to their logical conclusion, namely to tax the broadest possible tax base at the lowest possible tax rate. The goal to significantly improve economic efficiency, enhance stability in financial markets, and reduce to a minimum the costs of tax administration (assessment, collection,and compliance costs). There is disagreement over whether the tax is progressive, with the debate primarily centered on whether the volume of taxed transactions rise disproportionately with a person's income and net worth. Simulations of the Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances [...] demonstrate that high income and wealthy individuals undertake a disproportionate volume of transactions since they own {{a disproportionate share of}} financial assets that have relatively high turnover rates. However, since the APT tax has not yet been adopted, some argue that one <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>predict</b> whether the tax will be progressive or not.|$|E
