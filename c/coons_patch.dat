We have successfully applied this approach in designing photonic crystals where complex geometries have been optimized to maximize the band gaps. Salient features of this approach include the following: 1) Multi-patch Coons representation of design geometry. The design geometry is represented {{as a collection of}} <b>Coons</b> <b>patches</b> where the four boundaries of each patch are represented as NURBS curves. The use of multiple patches is motivated by the need for representing topologically complex geometries. The <b>Coons</b> <b>patches</b> are used as a design representation so that designers do not need to specify interior control points and they provide a mechanism to compute analytical sensitivities for internal nodes in shape optimization. 2) Exact boundary conversion to the analysis geometry with guaranteed mesh injectivity. The analysis geometry is a collection of NURBS patches that are converted from the multi-patch Coons representation with geometric exactness in patch boundaries. The internal NURBS control points are embedded in the parametric domain of the <b>Coons</b> <b>patches</b> with a built-in mesh rectifier to ensure the injectivity of the resulting B-spline geometry, i. e. every point in the physical domain is mapped to one point in the parametric domain. 3) Analytical sensitivities. Sensitivities of objective functions and constraints with respect to design variables are derived through nodal sensitivities. The nodal sensitivities for the boundary control points are directly determined by the design parameters and those for internal nodes are obtained via the corresponding <b>Coons</b> <b>patches...</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{the process}} of CAD/CAM, {{predefined}} parametric surfaces are often subject to the operation of trimming or extending. In such a case, the original iso-parametric curves are no longer boundary-conformed. Consequently, they are not anymore suitable for being used as natural CNC toolpaths. In this paper a method to regenerate boundary-conformed iso-parametric toolpaths on altered free-form surfaces is presented. The main idea of this method is to fit the 2 D parametric domain of the given trimmed surface with a 2 D <b>Coons</b> <b>patch.</b> Then boundary-conformed toolpaths on the altered surface can be regenerated naturally via the iso-parametric curves of the <b>Coons</b> <b>patch</b> via a two-step mapping.

40|$|In surface {{modeling}} a surface frequently encountered is a <b>Coons</b> <b>patch</b> that is defined {{only for a}} boundary composed of four analytical curves. In this paper we extend the range of applicability of a <b>Coons</b> <b>patch</b> by telling how to write it for a boundary composed of an arbitrary number of boundary curves. We partition the curves in a clear and natural way into four groups and then join all the curves in each group into one analytic curve by using representations of the unit step function including one that is fully analytic. Having a well-parameterized surface, we do some calculations on it that are motivated by differential geometry but give a better optimized and possibly more smooth surface. For this, we use an ansatz consisting of the original surface plus a variational parameter multiplying the numerator part of its mean curvature function and minimize with the respect to it the rms mean curvature and decrease {{the area of the}} surface we generate. We do a complete numerical implementation for a boundary composed of five straight lines, that can model a string breaking, and get about 0. 82 percent decrease of the area. Given the demonstrated ability of our optimization algorithm to reduce area by as much as 23 percent for a spanning surface not close of being a minimal surface, this much smaller fractional decrease suggests that the <b>Coons</b> <b>patch</b> {{we have been able to}} write is already close of being a minimal surface...|$|E

40|$|Using a <b>Coons</b> <b>patch</b> mapping to {{generate}} a structured grid in the parametric region of a trimmed surface can avoid the singularity of elliptic PDE methods when only C- 1 continuous boundary is given; the error of converting generic parametric C- 1 boundary curves into a specified representation form is also avoided. However, overlap may happen on some portions of the algebraically generated grid when a linear or native cubic blending function {{is used in the}} mapping; this severely limits its usage in most of engineering and scientific applications where a grid system of non-self-overlapping is strictly required. To solve the problem, non-trivial blending functions in a <b>Coons</b> <b>patch</b> mapping should be determined adaptively by the given boundary so that self-overlapping can be averted. We address the adaptive determination problem by a functional optimization method. The governing equation of the optimization is derived by adding a virtual dimension in the parametric space of the given trimmed surface. Both one- and two-parameter blending functions are studied. To resolve the difficulty of guessing good initial blending functions for the conjugate gradient method used, a progressive optimization algorithm is then proposed which {{has been shown to be}} very effective in a variety of practical examples. Also, an extension is added to the objective function to control the element shape. Finally, experiment results are shown to illustrate the usefulness and effectiveness of the presented method.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to present a finite element methodology, based upon a {{three-dimensional}} extensions of the classical Hermite interpolation and of the <b>Coons</b> <b>Patch,</b> {{for the evaluation of}} the natural modes of vibration of the air inside cavities (interior acoustics) and of elastic structures (structural dynamics). This methodology is thought for acoustic applications within Multidisciplinary Desing and Optimization, where computational effectiveness is a key attribute, especially during iterative optimization. The distinguishing feature of the proposed technique is its high efficiency, with the possibility to capture relatively high spatial frequency modes (essential in acoustics) even using a limited number of degrees of freedom. Also, the element is quite flexible and may be used for modeling any three-dimensional geometry. For instance, thin-wall structures like shells and plates are treated with three-dimensional brick elements with a single element along the thickness. An additional advantage is related to the possibility of applying a quasi-static reduction, which allows one to eliminate those degrees of freedom associated with the derivatives while maintaining a high level of accuracy, so that to further improve the effectiveness of the element. The classical one-dimensional Hermite interpolation is an interpolating technique of order three that uses the function and its derivative at the end points of the element. The classical Hermite technique for one-dimensional domains can be extended to higher orders, by including higher derivatives as nodal unknowns, thereby increasing the class of the element. Then, the three-dimensional extension is obtained combining the Hermite polynomials in each direction. For example, in the three-dimensional third-order interpolation, the unknowns are the nodal values of the function, of its three partial derivatives, of its three mixed second derivatives, and of its third mixed derivative. Similarly to the one-dimensional approach, higher orders are then obtained by including higher derivatives at nodes. The Hermite element, even that of order three, is rarely used because of problems that arise whenever the domain is not topologically hexahedral, that is when the coordinate lines (and so the base vectors) of two adjacent blocks present a discontinuity. Specifically, as far as the first-order derivatives are concerned, the problem has been removed by assuming as unknowns the Cartesian coordinates of the gradient, since they are continuous across block boundaries. The problem remains for the higher-order derivatives: in order to express them in terms of Cartesian components, their set should be complete (in particular, we have only the mixed second derivatives and, hence, incomplete information on the Hessian matrix). The remedies to this issue are key features of the present thesis. In particular, two solutions have been proposed in this thesis: (1) the high-order derivatives relative to different blocks are treated as independent unknowns at the block boundaries; (2) a new 3 -D high-order internal-nodes family of elements based upon the <b>Coons</b> <b>Patch</b> is used: these elements are defined so as to have only the function and the three derivatives as nodal unknowns (thereby, the higher the order of the element the higher the quantity of internal nodes needed for the interpolation). To be specific, the <b>Coons</b> <b>Patch</b> pertain the interpolation over a quadrilateral surface. Given the four edge lines, the <b>Coons</b> <b>Patch</b> is obtained as the sum of the two linear interpolations between opposite boundary lines, minus a bilinear interpolation through the four corner points. From this technique stems the idea of a new family of elements, which edges are generated using the Hermite interpolation. The objective is to extend the use of high-order elements based on a Hermite approach also to generically complicated geometries, so as to take advantage of their effectiveness. These elements will be referred to as Hybrid elements. The validation is based upon the evaluation of the natural eigenvalues (or natural frequencies) and modes of the air vibrating inside hexahedral cavities as well as of those of elastic thin plates (for each of this case exact or accurate solutions are available). Applications to quite complicated structures, such as curved domains (cylindrical cavities) or very simplified wing-boxes are presented. The results are compared with those obtained using commercial softwares (such as Ansys). Comparisons with the literature are also included...|$|E

Our quad meshing scheme is based on discrete <b>Coons</b> <b>patches</b> but with arbitrary boundary input.

40|$|In many {{large-scale}} scientific computations, it {{is necessary}} to use surface models based on information provided at only a finite number of points (rather than determined everywhere via an analytic formula). As an example, an equation of state (EOS) table may provide values of pressure as a function of temperature and density for a particular material. These values, while known quite accurately, are typically known only on a rectangular (but generally quite nonuniform) mesh in (T,d) -space. Thus interpolation methods are necessary to completely determine the EOS surface. The most primitive EOS interpolation scheme is bilinear interpolation. This has the advantages of depending only on local information, so that changes in data remote from a mesh element have no effect on the surface over the element, and of preserving shape information, such as monotonicity. Most scientific calculations, however, require greater smoothness. Standard higher-order interpolation schemes, such as <b>Coons</b> <b>patches</b> or bicubic splines, while providing the requisite smoothness, tend to produce surfaces that are not physically reasonable. This means that the interpolant may have bumps or wiggles that are not supported by the data.

40|$|Purpose - In {{the newly}} {{released}} ASTM standard specification for additive manufacturing file (AMF) format - version 1. 1 - Hermite curve-based interpolation {{is used to}} refine input triangles to generate denser mesh with smoother geometry. This paper aims to study the problems of constructing smooth geometry based on Hermite interpolation on curves and proposes a solution to overcome these problems. Design/methodology/approach - A formulation using triangular Bezier patch is proposed to generate smooth geometry from input polygonal models. Different configurations on the boundary curves in the formulation are analyzed to further enrich this formulation. Findings - The study shows that the formulation given in the AMF format (version 1. 1) {{can lead to the}} problems of inconsistent normals and undefined end-tangents. Research limitations/implications - The scheme has requirements on the input normals of a model, only C 0 interpolation can be generated on those cases with less-proper input. Originality/value - To overcome the problems of smooth geometry generation in the AMF format, the authors propose an enriched scheme for computing smooth geometry by using triangular Bezier patch.

A mannequin was scanned (using a custom, Kinect based scanning system) with one of two breast prostheses attached – 400 g or 600 g. Each scan was assessed by three independent operators: seven anatomical points were identified representing the boundary of the breast region, which was then isolated.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{recent developments}} of a finite–element methodology, {{for the evaluation}} of the natural modes of vibration of the air inside a cavity. In particular, an important variation of the methodology intro-duced in the past by the authors is introduced here (the internal–point Hermite interpolation), which produces an increase in user–friendliness, without any loss in accuracy. Specifically, the finite–element methodology presented here is based upon a combination of three important items: (1) the high–order inner–point Hermite interpolation scheme, (2) the three–dimensional extension of the <b>Coons</b> <b>patch</b> technique, and (3) quasi–static reductions. This combination is very powerful and yields the distinguishing feature of combining high effi-ciency (with the possibility to capture high spacial frequencies, as required in aeroacoustics applications), with user–friendliness. Indeed, the first two items (Hermite and Coons), yield a finite element that is very accurate. One fourth of the unknowns is related to derivatives and they are therefore treatable as slave variables, in the sense that may be eliminated by using a quasi–static reduction. The resulting scheme has the same high–order accuracy, but the unknowns are reduced to only the nodal values. However, the main advantage of the scheme introduced here is that it is more user–friendly than those introduced earlier by the authors, while retaining the high level of accuracy. 1 Motivation an...|$|E
40|$|Shell mapping is a {{technique}} to represent three-dimensional surface details. This is achieved by extruding the triangles of an existing mesh along their normals, and mapping a 3 D function (e. g., a 3 D texture) into the resulting prisms. Unfortunately, such a mapping is nonlinear. Previous approaches perform a piece-wise linear approximation by subdividing the prisms into tetrahedrons. However, such an approximation often leads to severe artifacts. In this paper we present a correct (i. e., smooth) mapping that does not rely on a decomposition into tetrahedrons. We present an efficient GPU ray casting algorithm which provides correct parallax, self-occlusion, and silhouettes, {{at the cost of}} longer rendering times. The new formulation also allows modeling shells with smooth curvatures using <b>Coons</b> <b>patches</b> within the prisms. Tangent continuity between adjacent prisms is guaranteed, while the mapping itself remains local, i. e. every curved prism content is modeled at runtime in the GPU without the need for any precomputation.

40|$|In medical imaging, {{segmentation}} is {{an important}} step for many visualization tasks and image-guided proce-dures. Except for very rare cases, automatic segmentation methods cannot guarantee to provide the correct segmentation. Therefore, for clinical usage, physicians insist on full control over the segmentation result, i. e., to verify and interactively correct the segmentation (if necessary). Display and interaction in 2 D slices (original or multi-planar reformatted) are more precise than in 3 D visualizations and therefore indispensable for segmen-tation, verification and correction. The usage of slices in more than one orientation (multi-planar reformatted slices) helps to avoid inconsistencies between 2 D segmentation results in neighboring slices. For the verification and correction of three-dimensional segmentations as well as for generating a new 3 D segmentation, it is therefore desirable to have a method that constructs a new or improved 3 D segmentation from 2 D segmentation results. The proposed method enables to quickly extend segmentations performed on intersecting slices of arbitrary ori-entation to a three-dimensional surface model by means of interpolation with specialized <b>Coons</b> <b>patches.</b> It {{can be used as a}} segmentation tool of its own as well as for making more sophisticated segmentation methods (that need an initialization close to the boundary to detect) feasible for clinical routine...|$|R

The Hermite based higher order representations, also coupled with <b>Coons</b> <b>patches</b> to avoid the introduction of the mixed derivatives, although achieving a higher rate of convergence than O(h), are limited to a single order. In order to overcome the singleorder limitation of the Hermite based BEM methods we also explored an approach based on Non Uniform Rational Basis Splines (NURBS). By using a global representation of the variables based on NURBS, the order of the basis functions can be improved at runtime when needed by the specific application at hand. This is a consequence of the iterative definition of the NURBS, which makes possible the increase of the NURBS degree simply by changing an input parameter. The use of the NURBS for the representation of curves and surfaces is a common technique in the CAD community for the model- ing of complex geometries with strict requirements of smoothness and continuity between patches. Their use in the numerical solution of BIE is not new, although relatively recent. NURBS have been used to develop boundary element solutions of integral equations in elastostatics, in radiation and diffraction problems, and in potential aerodynamics. The peculiarity of this approach is {{in the use of the}} NURBS for the development of a global isogeometric approach aimed at the mesh- less numerical solution of the BVP. The control points used for the representation of the dependent variables are obtained through the h-refinement of the optimal NURBS representation of the geometry. In the work we outline the underlying theory for the acoustic problem and for the BEM methodology, we illustrate the above said approaches in detail and we show how the high order methods described in this work are an effective tool to the simulation of high accuracy phenomena such as the ones involving the acoustic analysis of phononic crystals...|$|R
40|$|We {{focus on}} the {{programming}} aspect of the treatment of digitized geometries for subsequent use in mesh-free and mesh-based numerical solvers. That perspective includes the description of our C/C++ implementations which use OpenGL for the visualization and MFC classes for the user interface. We report on our experience about implementing with the IGES interface which serves as input for storage of geometric information. For mesh-free numerical solvers, {{it is helpful to}} decompose the boundary of a given solid into a set of four-sided surfaces. Additionally, we will describe the treatment of diffeomorphisms on four-sided domains by using transfinite interpolations. In particular, <b>Coons</b> and Gordon <b>patches</b> are appropriate for dealing with such mappings when the equations of the delineating curves are explicitly known. On the other hand, we show the implementation of the mesh generation algorithms which invoke the Laplace-Beltrami operator. We start from coarse meshes which one refine according to generalized Delaunay techniques. Our software is also featured by its ability of treating assembly of solids in B-Rep scheme...|$|R
