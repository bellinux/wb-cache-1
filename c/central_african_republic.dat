5|$|<b>Central</b> <b>African</b> <b>Republic</b> President David Dacko, Bokassa's cousin, {{took over}} the country in 1960, after winning a power {{struggle}} against Abel Goumba. Bokassa left the French army to join the <b>Central</b> <b>African</b> <b>Republic</b> army in 1962. By 1965, the country was in turmoil—plagued by corruption and slow economic growth, while its borders were breached by rebels from neighboring countries. Dacko obtained financial aid from the People's Republic of China, {{but in spite of}} this support, the country's problems persisted. Bokassa, now commander-in-chief of the army, made plans to take over the government; Dacko became aware of this, and countered by forming a gendarmerie headed by police chief Jean Izamo, who quickly became Dacko's closest adviser.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Central</b> <b>African</b> <b>Republic</b> is {{a former}} French colony of {{approximately}} 5 million people situated {{in the heart of}} Africa. The nation borders the Democratic Republic of the Congo for most of its southern border, the coastal nation of Cameroon to its west, South Sudan to its east, and Chad to its north. The nation declared its independence from France in 1960. Some eight years after its independence at the Mexico City 1968 Summer Olympics, the first Central African delegation debuted in the Olympic games. It sent a single male athlete to participate at those games, and did not send another delegation again for another three Olympics. The nation returned at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, and sent its largest delegations (15 athletes) at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul and the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, and sent its first female athletes to the Barcelona games. In total, the <b>Central</b> <b>African</b> <b>Republic</b> competed at eight games between its 1968 debut and its appearance at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. In its history up to Beijing, the <b>Central</b> <b>African</b> <b>Republic</b> has not sent an athlete that has won a medal.|$|E

It was formerly distributed mainly in the <b>Central</b> <b>African</b> <b>Republic,</b> Ethiopia, northern and northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo and southern Sudan. Fewer than 70,000 individuals are left. Most of the population nowadays is found in Chad in the Salamat region and the Zakouma National Park (Chad), the National Park population benefiting from improved protection and seeing an increase in population since the 1980s; Manovo-Gounda St. Floris National Park and Bamingui-Bangoran National Park and Biosphere Reserve in the <b>Central</b> <b>African</b> <b>Republic,</b> where the populations have been falling; Rumanyika Orugundu Game Reserve and Ibanda Game Reserve in Tanzania; and Murchison Falls National Park in Uganda.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Central</b> <b>African</b> <b>Republic's</b> export routes are seasonal: in {{the rainy}} season Cameroon's roads are too poor to use; and {{during the dry season}} the Democratic Republic of Congo's Oubangui River water levels are too low for river travel.|$|R
5|$|Bangui is the {{transport}} {{hub of the}} <b>Central</b> <b>African</b> <b>Republic.</b> As of 1999, eight roads connected the city to other main towns in the country, Cameroon, Chad and South Sudan; of these, only the toll roads are paved. During the rainy season from July to October, some roads are impassable. The road network in the city emanates from the Palace de la Republique.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{reputation}} as a destabiliser of regimes, Houphouët-Boigny granted refuge to Jean-Bédel Bokassa, after the exiled <b>Central</b> <b>African</b> <b>Republic</b> dictator had been overthrown by French paratroopers in September 1979. This move was met with international criticism, and thus, having become a political and financial burden to Houphouët-Boigny, Bokassa was expelled from Côte d'Ivoire in 1983.|$|E
5|$|In 1958, {{after the}} French Fourth Republic began to {{consider}} granting independence {{to most of}} its African colonies, Boganda met with Prime Minister Charles de Gaulle to discuss terms for the independence of Oubangui-Chari. De Gaulle accepted Boganda's terms, and on 1 December, Boganda declared {{the establishment of the}} <b>Central</b> <b>African</b> <b>Republic.</b> He became the autonomous territory's first Prime Minister and intended to serve as the first President of the independent CAR. He was killed in a mysterious plane crash on 29 March 1959, while en route to Bangui. Experts found a trace of explosives in the plane's wreckage, but revelation of this detail was withheld. Although those responsible for the crash were never identified, people have suspected the French secret service, and even Boganda's wife, of being involved. Slightly more than one year later, Boganda's dream was realized, when the <b>Central</b> <b>African</b> <b>Republic</b> attained formal independence from France.|$|E
