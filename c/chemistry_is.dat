A by-product of nuclear weapon testing is the release of radioactive xenon-133 and xenon-135.

5|$|A {{number of}} {{molecules}} exist in interstellar space, as can tiny 0.1μm dust particles. The tally of molecules discovered through radio astronomy is steadily increasing {{at the rate}} of about four new species per year. Large regions of higher density matter known as molecular clouds allow chemical reactions to occur, including the formation of organic polyatomic species. Much of this <b>chemistry</b> <b>is</b> driven by collisions. Energetic cosmic rays penetrate the cold, dense clouds and ionize hydrogen and helium, resulting, for example, in the trihydrogen cation. An ionized helium atom can then split relatively abundant carbon monoxide to produce ionized carbon, which in turn can lead to organic chemical reactions.|$|E
5|$|Carbon is brittle, and behaves as a {{semiconductor}} in {{a direction}} perpendicular to its planes. Most of its <b>chemistry</b> <b>is</b> nonmetallic; it has a relatively high ionization energy and, compared to most metals, a relatively high electronegativity. Carbon can form anions such as C4− (methanide), C (acetylide) and C (sesquicarbide or allylenide), in compounds with metals of main groups 1–3, and with the lanthanides and actinides. Its oxide CO2 forms carbonic acid H2CO3.|$|E
5|$|Earth is {{estimated}} to have formed 4.54billion years ago from the solar nebula, along with the Sun and other planets. The moon formed roughly 20million years later. Initially molten, the outer layer of the Earth cooled, resulting in the solid crust. Outgassing and volcanic activity produced the primordial atmosphere. Condensing water vapor, {{most or all of}} which came from ice delivered by comets, produced the oceans and other water sources. The highly energetic <b>chemistry</b> <b>is</b> believed to have produced a self-replicating molecule around 4billion years ago.|$|E

5|$|It was {{discovered}} in the debris of the first hydrogen bomb explosion in 1952, and named after Enrico Fermi, {{one of the pioneers}} of nuclear physics. Its <b>chemistry</b> <b>is</b> typical for the late actinides, with a preponderance of the +3 oxidation state but also an accessible +2 oxidation state. Owing to the small amounts of produced fermium and all of its isotopes having relatively short half-lives, there are currently no uses for it outside basic scientific research.|$|E
5|$|Selenium, {{especially}} in the II oxidation state, forms stable bonds to carbon, which are structurally analogous to the corresponding organosulfur compounds. Especially common are selenides (R2Se, analogues of thioethers), diselenides (R2Se2, analogues of disulfides), and selenols (RSeH, analogues of thiols). Representatives of selenides, diselenides, and selenols include respectively selenomethionine, diphenyldiselenide, and benzeneselenol. The sulfoxide in sulfur <b>chemistry</b> <b>is</b> represented in selenium chemistry by the selenoxides (formula RSe(O)R), which are intermediates in organic synthesis, {{as illustrated by the}} selenoxide elimination reaction. Consistent with trends indicated by the double bond rule, selenoketones, R(C=Se)R, and selenaldehydes, R(C=Se)H, are rarely observed.|$|E

5|$|Tetravalent thorium {{compounds}} {{are usually}} colourless or yellow, {{like those of}} silver or lead, as the Th4+ ion has no 5f or 6d electrons. Thorium <b>chemistry</b> <b>is</b> therefore largely that of an electropositive metal forming a single diamagnetic ion with a stable noble-gas configuration, indicating a similarity between thorium and the main group elements of the s-block. Thorium and uranium are the most investigated of the radioactive elements because their radioactivity is low enough not to require special handling in the laboratory.|$|E
5|$|The Aristarchus {{region was}} part of a Hubble Space Telescope study in 2005 that was {{investigating}} the presence of oxygen-rich glassy soils {{in the form of the}} mineral ilmenite.

The Hubble Advanced Camera for Surveys was used to photograph the crater in visual and ultraviolet light. The crater was determined to have especially rich concentrations of ilmenite, a titanium oxide mineral that could potentially be used in the future by a lunar settlement for extracting oxygen.|$|E
5|$|The {{nonmetallic}} {{character of}} selenium {{is shown by}} its brittleness and the low electrical conductivity (~10−9 to 10−12S•cm−1) of its highly purified form. This is comparable to or {{less than that of}} bromine (7.95S•cm−1), a nonmetal. Selenium has the electronic band structure of a semiconductor and retains its semiconducting properties in liquid form. It has a relatively high electronegativity (2.55 revised Pauling scale). Its reaction <b>chemistry</b> <b>is</b> mainly that of its nonmetallic anionic forms Se2−, SeO and SeO.|$|E

5|$|After {{settling}} {{down at the}} landlady's house, Vanaja gets invited {{to play a game}} of ashta chamma (a leisurely game in rural towns of Andhra Pradesh) against the landlady. Knowing that losing isn’t the mistress’s forte, she deliberately gives up her game. This gesture, in turn, eventually secures her the landlady’s mentorship, first in music and then in dance. Vanaja excels at these art forms and seems to be on a steadily ascending path until the arrival of Shekhar (Karan Singh), the landlady's 23-year-old son, from the United States. Shekhar is a handsome, muscular young man who is running for an office in the local government.

5|$|Einsteinium is a soft, silvery, {{paramagnetic}} metal. Its <b>chemistry</b> <b>is</b> {{typical of}} the late actinides, with a preponderance of the +3 oxidation state; the +2 oxidation state is also accessible, especially in solids. The high radioactivity of einsteinium-253 produces a visible glow and rapidly damages its crystalline metal lattice, with released heat of about 1000 watts per gram. Difficulty in studying its properties is due to einsteinium-253's decay to berkelium-249 and then californium-249 {{at a rate of}} about 3% per day. The isotope of einsteinium with the longest half-life, einsteinium-252 (half-life 471.7 days) would be more suitable for investigation of physical properties, but it has proven far more difficult to produce and is available only in minute quantities, and not in bulk. Einsteinium is the element with the highest atomic number which has been observed in macroscopic quantities in its pure form, and this was the common short-lived isotope einsteinium-253.|$|E
