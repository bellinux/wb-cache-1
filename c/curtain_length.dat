40|$|It {{is known}} that the basic nature of the global {{dynamics}} of gravitational (and, therefore, spatially developing) liquid sheet flows, {{in the presence of}} surface tension effects, depends crucially 1, 2 on the inlet Weber number,  2 / We  Uo ho, where  is the liquid density, Uo is the inlet liquid velocity, ho is the initial half thickness of the sheet,  is the surface tension at the air-liquid interface. When We  1, the local Weber number too is greater than unity at each streamwise (i. e., vertical) location, so that the flow can be defined supersonic everywhere, {{in the sense that the}} local flow velocity exceeds the capillary waves velocity  / h, where h is the local sheet thickness. On the other hand, when We  1, there exists an initial region where the sheet flow is subsonic, up to the transonic location, downstream of which the flow becomes supersonic. Since the experimental evidence is that the sheet breaks-up in flow conditions of We  1 only, the analysis of the flow field initially subsonic, and hence including the transonic line, is mandatory to predict the rupture conditions. From the theoretical viewpoint the problem is not straightforward, because the equation governing the evolution of global linear disturbances exhibits a singularity just at the transonic station, as documented also by previous contributions of literature 3, 4, although the solution to the problem is not yet yielded. Thus, the present work is aimed at developing a theoretical/numerical procedure to fill up this lack of information. Within this framework, the flow is assumed inviscid and the problem is arranged in 1 D formulation along the streamwise direction by expressing all the physical quantities through a coordinate-type expansion in terms of powers of the local lateral distance from the centerline position. The interaction with the external environment refers to an air enclosure located on one side of the curtain. The linearized perturbation equations are determined in a standard fashion by superimposing infinitesimal disturbances to the steady solution and the modal global stability is studied by addressing the relevant singular eigenvalues problem. The dimensionless governing equation of sinuous disturbances can be written as:    where U  1  2 x is the classic free-fall Torricelli’s solution, f is the centerline deflection of the sheet, k is a proper compressibility coefficient of the air enclosure and L is the <b>curtain</b> <b>length.</b> It is shown that the transonic location can be classified as a regular singular point and a solution in terms of Frobenius series 5 is introduced in order to provide the local solution around the singularity. The non-linear eigenvalues problem obtained accordingly is faced as a nonlinear two-point boundary problem (in which the searched eigenvalue is considered as an unknown function) that is solved by means of a shooting technique 6. The boundary conditions are of null sheet displacement at inlet and boundedness at the singularity location 3, 4. The numerical results show the spectra pattern obtained when the inlet We number is varied from subsonic to transonic values, with particular attention to their evolution with respect to cases of entirely supersonic flow analyzed with standard spectral methods. The physical relevance of the present findings is discussed as well. a University of Naples Federico II, Dept.

40|$|Abstract. Modern {{operating}} rooms are increasingly turning to contamination control by ventilating {{technology for the}} infectious control. The objective {{of this study is}} to present the strategic approach on performance improvement of the ventilating system for a hospital operating room under limit budget. A physical partition curtain has been proposed and conducted around the high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter of an operating room to validate the improvement of air distribution and contamination control. Numerical simulation of a full-scale operating room has been carried out at a district hospital. The results from computer simulation revealed that the improvement of airflow could be achieved satisfactorily by the application of a physical partition <b>curtain</b> at the <b>length</b> of 1. 2 m. Ventilation performance could be assessed extensively not only by airflow distribution and concentration profile but also by the calculation of contamination concentration decay...|$|R
