25|$|The {{trial began}} on January 24, 1995 and was {{televised}} by Court TV {{and in part}} by other cable and network news outlets for 134 days. Los Angeles County prosecutor <b>Christopher</b> <b>Darden</b> argued that Simpson killed his ex-wife in a jealous rage. The prosecution opened its case by playing a 9-1-1 call from Nicole Brown Simpson on January 1, 1989. She expressed fear that Simpson would physically harm her, and he could be heard yelling {{at her in the}} background. Other material related to domestic violence was presented. The prosecution also presented dozens of expert witnesses to place Simpson {{at the scene of the}} crime, on subjects ranging from DNA profiling to blood and shoeprint analysis.|$|E
2500|$|Deputy District Attorneys Marcia Clark and <b>Christopher</b> <b>Darden</b> {{believed}} they had a strong case against Simpson, but Cochran was able to convince the jurors that there was reasonable doubt about the DNA evidence, which was a relatively new form of evidence in trials at that time. The reasonable doubt theory included evidence that the blood sample had allegedly been mishandled by lab scientists and technicians, and there were questionable circumstances that surrounded other court exhibits. Cochran and the defense team also alleged other misconduct by the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD), related to systemic racism. Simpson's celebrity status, racial issues, and the lengthy televised trial riveted national attention on the so-called [...] "trial of the century". By {{the end of the}} criminal trial, national surveys showed dramatic differences in the assessment of Simpson's guilt or innocence between black and white Americans.|$|E
2500|$|On June 15, 1995, defense {{attorney}} Johnnie Cochran goaded assistant prosecutor <b>Christopher</b> <b>Darden</b> into asking Simpson {{to put on}} the leather glove that was found {{at the scene of the}} crime. The prosecution had earlier decided against asking Simpson to try on the gloves because (according to prosecutors) the glove had been soaked in blood from Simpson, Brown and Goldman, and frozen and unfrozen several times. The leather glove seemed too tight for Simpson to put on easily, especially over the sanitary gloves he wore underneath. Uelmen came up with and Cochran repeated a quip he had used several times in relation to other points in his closing arguments, [...] "If it doesn't fit, you must acquit". On June 22, 1995, Darden told Judge Lance Ito of his concerns that Simpson [...] "has arthritis and we looked at the medication he takes and some of it is anti-inflammatory and we are told he has not taken the stuff for a day and it caused swelling in the joints and inflammation in his hands". The prosecution also stated their belief that the glove shrank from having been soaked in blood and later testing. The prosecution presented a photo during the trial of Simpson earlier wearing the same type of glove that was found at the crime scene.|$|E

5000|$|The Chewbacca {{defense is}} a fictional legal {{strategy}} used in Chef Aid. It {{is a form}} of Red Herring argument, used to deliberately confuse the jury.

50|$|Protagonist Gus Bailey, {{introduced}} in Dunne's earlier novel People Like Us, {{is a successful}} writer who is assigned to cover the Simpson trial for Vanity Fair. He firmly believes Simpson is guilty from the very beginning, and in his monthly column Letter from Los Angeles, he clearly states his position and puts his personal spin on what he observes in the courtroom and beyond. Those involved with the criminal proceedings, including Marcia Clark and <b>Christopher</b> <b>Darden</b> for the prosecution, Johnnie Cochran, F.

50|$|When it {{introduced}} the gloves as evidence at trial, the prosecution called Richard Rubin, {{a former executive}} at Aris Isotoner, the maker of the gloves, as an expert witness, to verify that gloves shown on Simpson's hands in footage of him covering a football game were the same model as those found {{at the crime scene}} and a pair purchased by Nicole a year before the murders, on a trip to New York. While he testified, he and prosecutor <b>Christopher</b> <b>Darden</b> regularly referred to the actual gloves, which were present in the courtroom. During a break, Robert Shapiro, one of Simpson's attorneys, picked them up and tried them on himself. They fit tightly, and he doubted that they would fit Simpson since his client's hands were much larger.|$|E

5000|$|On {{the eve of}} the verdict, {{criminal}} law experts interviewed by CNN agreed that acquittal was likely. <b>Christopher</b> <b>Darden,</b> trial prosecutor in the O.J. Simpson murder case, said the prosecution's case lacked evidence: [...] "Just about everything the prosecution has asserted in this case has been addressed by the defense and refuted. ... You have to wonder if you're a juror sitting on this case, why was this prosecution brought in the first place? ... I mean, there are just huge, huge holes in the prosecution's case." [...] Criminal defense attorney Diana Tennis agreed, saying in part: [...] "We have a rule of law, we have a very high burden in criminal cases for a reason, no matter what the color of any party and in the USA you don't get convicted typically on evidence that is not better than this." ...|$|E
50|$|The show {{centered}} on the adventures of Shore Patrol Force 30 (SPF 30, a pun on the term Sun Protection Factor), led by the pasty, out-of-shape, clueless lifeguard Notch Johnson (Timothy Stack). The rest of his patrol consists of B.J. Cummings (the dumb, Caucasian, big-buff lifeguard in season 3 becomes big chested blonde pregnant woman), Jamaica St. Croix (the dumb, African-American, big-chested lifeguard), Chip Rommel (the dumb, hunky, muscular male lifeguard who is an obvious parody of Arnold Schwarzenegger) and Kimberlee Clark (the smart but flat-chested female lifeguard and straight man of the series).

5000|$|In the book, Bugliosi is {{severely}} critical of prosecutors Marcia Clark and <b>Christopher</b> <b>Darden.</b> Bugliosi {{argued that a}} major mistake in the trial was the District Attorney's assigning Clark and Darden to prosecute it. This was because Bugliosi considered the two to be average prosecutors, who lacked the competence and skill to try such a significant murder case as Simpson's. Bugliosi noted what he thought were glaring mistakes made by the prosecution; for example: he faults prosecutors for not introducing the note Simpson had written before trying to flee, which one friend took to be a suicide note. Bugliosi writes that the note [...] "reeked" [...] of guilt, and the jury should {{have been allowed to}} see it. He also noted that the jury was never told that Simpson was traveling with his friend Cowlings with a change of clothing, a large amount of cash, his passport, and a disguise kit. Bugliosi criticized Clark and Darden for not allowing the jury to hear the tape of Simpson's statement to police about cutting his finger the night of the murders, in which he prevaricates over his story.|$|E
5000|$|Throughout the 18-month {{process from}} {{conception}} to completion, Edelman conducted 72 interviews for the documentary, [...] "including key {{players from the}} prosecution (Marcia Clark, Gil Garcetti and Bill Hodgman), Simpson's defense team (F.

Douglas and Barry Scheck), childhood friends of Simpson, jurors from the criminal trial, former LAPD detectives {{involved in the case}} (Mark Fuhrman and Tom Lange) and African-American civil rights activists", and people who could speak on behalf of Ron Goldman and Nicole Brown Simpson. Edelman also reached out to Simpson through a letter, which was never answered; he had also hoped to include Simpson's first wife, Marguerite, who could not be contacted, and former L.A. County district attorney <b>Christopher</b> <b>Darden,</b> who declined participation. Despite envisioning the project as a five-hour documentary, the final film was screened to ESPN Films executives at 7.5 hours in length, to which Schell said they would figure out the programming end, as they were [...] "going to give Ezra the time he needs to tell this story". The initial plan was to break the film into three parts - [...] "everything leading up to the murder and then the trial and then everything after the trial" [...] - before a five-part format was settled on.|$|E

Xenophobes, obviously, are not offended by slurs, but others are – with some slurs more offensive than others. 1 Calling an Asian businesswoman ‘suit ’ will not rouse the same reaction as calling her ‘chink’. Even co-extensive slurs vary in intensity of contempt. <b>Christopher</b> <b>Darden</b> once branded ‘nigger ’ the “filthiest, dirtiest, nastiest word in the English language ” (quoted in Kennedy, p. 23); we doubt anyone reacts as such to ‘negro’, yet in the recent past it too has become a slur. This raises the question of how words can fluctuate in both their status as slurs and in their power to offend. Indeed, targeted members themselves are not always offended by their confrontations with slurs, for example, so-called appropriated or reclaimed uses (the camaraderie use of ‘nigger’ among African-Americans and ‘queer ’ among homosexuals).

40|$|Increasingly {{philosophers}} (and linguists) {{are turning}} {{their attention to}} slurs— a lexical category not much explored in the past. These are expressions that target groups {{on the basis of}} race (‘nigger’), nationality (‘kraut’), religion (‘kike’), gender (‘bitch’), sexual orientation (‘fag’), immigrant status (‘wetback’) and sundry other demographics. Slurs of a racial and ethnic variety have become particularly important not only for the sake of theorizing about their linguistic distribution adequately but also for the implications their usage has on other well-worn areas of interest. In “Reference, Inference, and The Semantics of Pejoratives, ” Timothy Williamson discusses the merits of Inferentialism by looking at Dummett’s treatment of the slur ‘boche. ’ Mark Richard attempts to show that, contrary to a commitment to minimalism about truth, one is not conceptually confused in holding that slurring statements are not truth-apt discursive discourses, i. e. statements that are neither true nor false, but still represent the world to be a certain way. Others, like David Kaplan, argue that slurs force us to expand our very conception of meaning. Slurs also rub up against various other issues like descriptivism versus expressivism as well as the semantic/pragmatic divide (cf. Potts). Slurs’ effects on these issues make it difficult to ignore them and still give an adequate theory of language. In this paper, we will be particularly interested in the potential slurs carry to offend.
