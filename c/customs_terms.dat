In particular, art practices show the contemporary value and efficacy of traditional forms of social cooperation and can foreground the continuing role of local ethnic communities, as the caretakers of the various elements of tangible and intangible cultural heritage present in their territory. To illustrate why and how, I draw on examples of art practice from public participatory intercultural events held in Bali and Java, Indonesia as well as in other countries. </em...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, as the {{increasingly}} intense {{international trade and}} logistics, the administrative burden of customs has been dramatically raised. In order to reduce repetitive taxing work and promote automatic administration, custom warehouses with electronic declaration systems are introduced and implemented by EU countries. The owner of custom warehouses can postpone the payment of import duties {{under the supervision of}} customs in case these goods are re-exported. The implementation of customwarehouses has significantly simplified custom formality and enhance administrative efficiency. However, its successful management highly depends on the accuracy and reliability of inventory information. Inaccurate inventory records may lead to a variety of undesirable effects, such as troubles in taxing and compliance failure with <b>custom</b> <b>terms.</b> As the common way to address this problem in the past, the traditional physical auditing is always time-consuming and costly, especially when the inventory is various and massive. Moreover, since the multiple stakeholders involvement in custom warehouses, the fault detection and diagnosis processes for inventory record inaccuracy in reality are usually problematic and complicated. Without the effective communication and cooperation between different stakeholders, it is difficult to solve inventory record inaccuracy issues and to guarantee the efficiency and reliability of customwarehousemanagement.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a generic method for randomly generating well-typed expressions.

Our motivation for building these random terms is to more effectively falsify conjectures {{as part of the}} tool-support for semantics models specified in Redex. Accordingly, we evaluate the generator against the other available methods for Redex, as well as the best available <b>custom</b> well-typed <b>term</b> generator. Our results show that our new generator is much more effective than generation techniques that do not explicitly take types into account and is competitive with generation techniques that do, even though they are specialized to particular type-systems and ours is not. ...|$|R

This paper analyses critically the process of interpretation of customs or what {{is referred to as the}} legal discourse on matriliny, from the standpoint of its own assumptions, i. e., the ideas and theory that shaped and governed it. It is argued that a theory of matrilineal law, informed by mid nineteenth century anthropological and comparative legal perspectives, gendered the detail of matrilineal law, emphasising rigidly older male control over property and excluding women, virtually, from all functions of authority. The legal discourse on matriliny then despite or precisely because of the implicit connection between women and matriliny, was not so much about matriliny or women but about what comprised `authentic' custom. colonial law, customary practice, matriliny, gender, property rights...|$|R

Sporting Muslims living in Czechia and active Muslim athletes are chosen as target group for our research. This thesis focuses on level of identification with Islam as their faith. It also focuses on their attitude to sport. It further deals with Muslim <b>customs</b> in <b>terms</b> of its effects on athletes' life. The proper example is the Ramadan fasting. Methods: We chose the semistructured interview as the method to collect data. We took seven interviews with Muslim athletes (four professional and three amateur athletes). We chose the method of open coding as the suitable method for analysing data. Results: We found out that the relationship of Muslim athletes (our respondents) with their faith can be characterized as folk Islam or folk religiosity. Respondents also consider sport as a fully satisfying part of their life, but it is not linked with their faith. However other Muslim practices (represented mainly by Ramadan fasting) do not show as problematic or incompatible with ordinary athletes' life. Key words: Islam, sport, Muslim athletes, Czechi...|$|R
50|$|In 2000, Stanford {{researchers}} published {{results in}} Nature, utilizing expression profiling techniques to stratify DLBCL to two subtypes: germinal center B-like DLBCL and activated B-like DLBCL. The authors developed <b>custom</b> microarrays <b>termed</b> “lymphochips” {{that were used}} to query expression of 17,856 genes preferentially expressed in lymphoid cells and those with roles in cancer or immunology for 96 lymphocyte samples. The hierarchical clustering algorithm identified a subset of tumors that would have been labeled DLBCLs by traditional histological methods; however, the expression profiles of these tumors were heterogeneous. When the tumors were re-clustered based on expression of germinal center B-cell genes, a second group of genes characteristic of activated B-cells emerged and were oppositely regulated compared to the first set of genes. Based on these expression patterns, the heterogeneous DLBCL cluster was subclassified to the germinal center B-like DLBCL and activated B-like DLBCL. The distinction of these groups is significant in terms of patient overall survival: the probability of survival for patients with germinal center B-like DLBCLs over 10 years was about 80% while those with activated B-like DLBCLs was lowered to about 40% over a shorter eight-year period.|$|R
