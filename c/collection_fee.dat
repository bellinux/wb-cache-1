5000|$|The {{toll rate}} on E-470 for {{vehicles}} {{that do not}} have ExpressToll automated toll transponders, roughly , is one of the highest rates of any toll road in the United States. In addition to 17 ramp toll interchanges, there are five mainline toll stations along the 47 mi route and the average non-discounted toll to pass each mainline station is $3.64 based on 2017 rates posted on E-470.com. According to the E-470's 2017 Toll Calculator [...] traveling {{the entire length of the}} road from I-25 in the north to I-25 in the south (or vice versa) costs $14.50 for ExpressToll customers, and $18.20 for those without a transponder. Drivers with ExpressToll accounts, E-470's automated toll collection service, and transponders mounted on their vehicle save 20% on posted toll rates along E-470.The toll stations no longer accept cash; E-470 was one of the first highways in the United States to implement full highway-speed electronic tolling. Regarding License Plate Toll (for vehicles without ExpressToll transponders), cameras at each station photograph the front and rear license plate of each vehicle. A bill is mailed after approximately 30 days to the registered owner of the vehicle in accordance with state law. The License Plate Toll statement must be paid in full by the due date or a second statement with a one-time $5 late fee will be mailed. If payment is still not received, a third statement is sent with no additional fees. If the account remains unpaid for more than 90 days, the account becomes delinquent and all overdue toll transactions will be sent to a collections law firm for up to four months in an attempt to find the customer and collect payment. The unpaid tolls, the $5 late fee, and a one-time $20 <b>collection</b> <b>fee</b> are due at this time. If payment is still not received, a Civil Penalty Assessment Notice will be mailed for the unpaid tolls, the $5 late fee, the $20 <b>collection</b> <b>fee,</b> and a $25 Civil Penalty per notice. Upon receipt of this document, the customer may request a hearing. If the full payment of the Civil Assessment Notice has not been received in 30 days, a Hearing Officer's Final Notice is issued to include the unpaid tolls, the $5 late fee, the $20 <b>collection</b> <b>fee,</b> the $25 Civil Penalty, and a $20 Court Fee, totaling a maximum of $70 of fees and penalties for each unpaid set of tolls.|$|E

This is a bachelor’s thesis with the aim to study how different input variables e. g. the number of collections and the municipality´s costs may form the refuse <b>collection</b> <b>fee.</b> But also other input variables may affect some parts of the refuse <b>collection</b> <b>fee</b> like the democratic influence or the value of the real estate. Especially the relationship between permanent residents and the non-permanent residents fee are studied. The democratic view is considered, as a property owner in a Swedish municipality not automatically is allowed to vote, unless the person is a permanent resident of that particular municipality. If the citizen owns property in many municipalities, it will become impossible to have a full democratic influence in any municipalities but one -The municipality where he or she lives the majority if his time.

40|$|Municipal {{solid waste}} {{management}} is a growing problem in urban areas of Nepal where municipalities are severely constrained by budget to manage it effectively. Collecting fees from the public can aid finance for improving waste management service. This study evaluates willingness to pay (WTP) by 401 households, selected using a stratified sampling method from all 15 wards of Gorkha municipality of Nepal for improved waste collection service and the factors influencing it. We employed a contingent valuation method to elicit households’ WTP, logit regression model to determine factors influencing WTP and tobit regression model to determine factors influencing the maximum amount households {{are willing to pay}} for improved waste collection service. Majority of households (61 %) are willing to pay an average amount of NRs. 73. 38 (0. 72 US$) per month. Factors that significantly influence households’ WTP are monthly household income, education of household head, environmental awareness and waste collection service. Except for education of household head, all these factors significantly influence the maximum amount of money households are willing to pay.

40|$|The Waste Law No. 18 / 2008 Article 22 and 44 {{require the}} {{local governments to}} run {{environmentally}} sound landfill. Due to the widespread poor quality of waste management in Indonesia, this study aimed to identify the current situation by eval-uating three selected landfills based on the ideal conditions of landfill practices, which are used to appraise the capability of local governments {{to adapt to the}} law. The results indicated that the local governments have problems of insufficient budget, inadequate equipment, uncollected waste and unplanned future landfill locations. All of the selected landfills were partially controlled landfills with open dumping practices predominating. In such inferior conditions the implementation of sanitary landfill is not necessarily appropriate. The controlled landfill is a more appropriate solution as it offers lower investment and operational costs, makes the selection of a new landfill site unnecessary and can operate with a minimum standard of infrastructure and equipment. The sustainability of future landfill capacity can be maintained by utilizing the old landfill as a profit-oriented landfill by implementing a landfill gas management or a clean development mechanism project.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of the trend of generation, composition, and management of municipal solid waste, and estimates the carbon emissions arising from municipal solid waste management in Beijing. The correlation analysis conducted shows that the generation of municipal solid waste in Beijing has been growing steadily, showing high correlations (r > 0. 9) to the total GDP, per capita income, and the population. Food waste showed an increasing trend since 1990. Compared with the results of an investigation in 1990, ash and woodchips content in 2003 declined from 56 % to 17 %, while the percentage of paper and plastic increased from 10 % to 29 % over the same period. The calorific value of the municipal waste also increased, from 2, 686 kJ/kg in 1990 to 4, 667 kJ/kg in 2003, indicating that the waste is suitable for incineration. Currently, the source separation ratio of municipal waste is approximately 15 %. About 94 % of all the collected solid waste goes to the landfill while 4 % is composted and 2 % is incinerated. A moderate garbage <b>collection</b> <b>fee</b> is applied to both permanent and temporary residents in Beijing, but the willingness to pay for solid waste collection and treatment is still low. Under current treatment mode, the total amounts of carbon emission from waste disposal sites and incineration increased with the increase of municipal solid waste, from 29. 8 Gg in 1990 to 84. 5 Gg in 2003, including 83. 3 Gg of CH 4 and 22. 0 Gg of CO 2.
