This study examined cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships between indicators of family <b>circumstance</b> and (i) breakfast skipping and (ii) consumption of snack food, fast food, fruits and vegetables among adolescents. Dietary behaviour was assessed using a web-based survey completed by 1884 adolescents from years 7 and 9 of secondary schools in Victoria, Australia, at baseline and 2 years later. Five indicators of family <b>circumstance</b> (parental marital status, maternal education, maternal employment status, number of brothers and number of sisters) were assessed with a questionnaire completed by parents at baseline only.

Individual indicators of family <b>circumstance</b> were differentially associated with adolescent dietary behaviours. Cross-sectional and longitudinal associations differed for adolescent boys and girls highlighting the importance of assessing specific dietary behaviours and food types individually by gender. This study highlights the complexity of the relationships between family <b>circumstance</b> and adolescent dietary behaviours.

40|$|CONTEXT: There {{have been}} many reports {{confirming}} the association between lower childhood socioeconomic <b>circumstance</b> and cardiovascular disease but evidence for links with cerebrovascular disease is contradictory. Hyperintensities on brain magnetic resonance imaging are associated with vascular risk factors, cognitive decline, dementia and death. However, the relationship between childhood socioeconomic <b>circumstance</b> and these lesions is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that childhood socioeconomic <b>circumstance</b> is associated with late life hyperintensity burden and that neither adult socioeconomic <b>circumstance</b> nor change in socioeconomic <b>circumstance</b> during life influence this effect. DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: Community. PARTICIPANTS: 227 community dwelling members of the 1936 Aberdeen Birth Cohort aged 68 years, who were free from dementia. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Relationship between early life socioeconomic <b>circumstance</b> (paternal occupation) and abundance of late life brain hyperintensities. RESULTS: We find significant negative correlations between childhood socioeconomic <b>circumstance</b> and white matter hyperintensities (ρ = - 0. 18, P< 0. 01), and periventricular hyperintensities (ρ = - 0. 15, P< 0. 05), between educational attainment and white matter hyperintensities (ρ = - 0. 15, P< 0. 05) and periventricular hyperintensities (ρ = - 0. 17, P< 0. 05), and between childhood intelligence and periventricular hyperintensities (ρ = - 0. 14, P< 0. 05). The relationship is strongest for childhood socioeconomic <b>circumstance</b> and regional white matter hyperintensities, {{where there is a}} step change in increased burden from paternal occupation grades equivalent to a shift from "white collar" to "blue collar" paternal occupation. Significant correlations were also found between hypertension and hyperintensity burden in all brain regions (ρ =  0. 15 - 0. 24, P< 0. 05). In models that include hypertension, the magnitude of the effect of childhood socioeconomic <b>circumstance</b> is similar to and independent from that of hypertension. CONCLUSIONS: Childhood socioeconomic <b>circumstance</b> predicts the burden of brain white matter hyperintensities aged 68 years. The mechanism underlying this effect is unknown, but may act through fetal and/or early life programming of cerebrovascular disease. Future work to understand this vulnerability will inform strategies to reduce dementia and stroke...|$|R
