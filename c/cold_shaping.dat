40|$|From the {{economic}} reasons many products originally made from austenite stainless steel are nowadays made from ferritic stainless steel. Ferritic steels have relatively {{low yield strength}} and the work hardening is limited. They cannot be hardened by heat treatment and only moderately hardened by cold working. Commercially made stainless steel tubes from ferritic steel, used for industrial plumbing was examined on presence of cracks. The cracking was present {{on the inner side}} of the convoluted tube shape. The tube manufacturing process consisted of continual bending of the sheet to tube shape, weld the tube, then of <b>cold</b> <b>shaping</b> by pulling through rib-forming frames, which is done in several steps. Then thermal treatment applies to the nearly finished product to remove stress remaining in the structure. Prime suspect was deformation beyond the ductility of used material. However the stress-strain tensile testing does not approved this hypothesis. Several samples of failed material were taken together with reference, and were examined by optical microscopy, and X-Ray Diffraction structure analysis. The structure of the cracked tubes does not show the signs of deformation over the limit, except the location near to the crack itself. Interestingly enough the failed material showed more homogenous structure than the original one. Needle like structures were found when the material is “overetched”, on these structures concentration of stress under bending occur. This structure was identified as δ-ferrite, however its presence in α-ferrite matrix is unclear...|$|E

The ability to implement this procedure into the current Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) Turbopropulsion Lab (TPL) design procedure that uses commercial off the shelf software has been documented. The TS stage was tested at multiple clocking positions over the full speed range of the rotor. The best performance was observed at a negative 10 percent clocking position relative to the design configuration. Numerical simulations were conducted of both hot and <b>cold</b> rotor <b>shapes</b> and compared. This study advanced the understanding of simulating the hot shape of a rotor to better match the results of experimental data. The hot shape results closely resembled that of the <b>cold</b> <b>shape</b> results; however, the hot shape achieved a greater mass flow range. The procedure developed is easily implemented, utilizing a fluid-structure interaction. Rotational forces as well as gas loading forces were observed as an influence on blade deformation. Utilizing the procedure to model the hot shape of the rotor will be essential in deriving numerical results for a comparative analysis. Lieutenant, United States Nav...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the two-way shape memory effect (TWSME) induced on a strip of a nearequiatomic NiTi alloy {{by means of the}} shape memory cycling {{training}} method. This procedure is based on the deformation in martensite state to reach the desired <b>cold</b> <b>shape</b> followed by cycling the temperature from above Af to below Mf. To this end, the sample was thermally treated to memorise a bent shape, thermomechanical trained as described and thermally cycled in unloaded conditions in order to study the stability of the induced TWSME. Heating to Af was reached by a hot air stream flow whereas cooling to Mf was achieved through natural convection. The evolution of the curvature with the increasing number of cycles was evaluated. The thermomechanical behaviour of the strip undergoing uniform bending was simulated using a one-dimensional phenomenological model based on stress and the temperature as external control variables. Both martensite and austenite volume fractions were chosen as internal parameters and kinetic laws were used in order to describe their evolution during phase transformations. The experimental findings are compared with the model simulation and a numerical prediction based on the approach proposed in [25]...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedA new, multidisciplinary algorithm for the CFD design optimization of turbomachinery blades is presented. It departs from existing techniques {{in that it}} uses a simple, previously-developed Bezier geometry representation (BLADE- 3 D) {{that can be easily}} manipulated to achieve true 3 -D changes in blade shape. The algorithm incorporates zero and first-order optimization techniques including sensitivity analyses and one-dimensional search methodology. It features an iterative finite element structural analysis as well as a <b>cold</b> <b>shape</b> correction procedure to ensure that the resulting blade meets steady-stress structural requirements. The process was applied to two different transonic fan designs - the Sanger rotor designed for the NPS Turbomachinery Laboratory and NASA Rotor 67, otherwise known as the 'NASA Fan'. The optimization objectives for the two designs were mass flow rate and polytropic efficiency respectively. Results for the Sanger rotor effort yielded an 8. 1 % improvement in mass flow rate, a 5 % improvement in total pressure ratio, and a 0. 9 % increase in adiabatic efficiency. Application to the NASA Fan resulted in a 2. 5 % increase in polytropic efficiency.
