40|$|We {{recently}} developed Kochi Oxydol-Radiation Therapy for Unresectable Carcinomas (KORTUC) {{as a strategy}} to increase intratumoral oxygen concentrations and degrade antioxidant enzymes such as peroxidase and catalase. We then developed KORTUC II, which uses sodium hyaluronate containing hydrogen peroxide as a radiosensitizer. KORTUC II requires twice-weekly administration to sustain its effects, but decreasing the frequency of radiosensitizer injections to once-weekly would reduce {{the burden on the}} patients and the physicians. The goal of this study was thus to develop a new formulation of KORTUC (New KORTUC) that only requires once-weekly administration. We performed experimental studies using a mouse tumor model and biodegradable hydrogel. C 3 H/He mice were allocated to control, KORTUC, or hydrogel groups. At 72 h after injection, each tumor was irradiated with a 6 MeV electron beam to a total dose of 30 Gy. During a 62 -day observation period, changes in tumor volume and survival rates were assessed in each group. Tumor growth rate was slowest in the hydrogel groups. These data suggest that hydrogel could represent a useful adjunct as a long-acting radiosensitizer in place of sodium hyaluronate. New KORTUC, which <b>contains</b> <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> and hydrogel, exerted a radiosensitizing effect that persisted beyond 72 h following injection of the agent.

40|$|We {{recently}} reported that phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) treated with nonthermal dielectric-barrier discharge plasma (plasma) acquires strong antimicrobial properties, but the mechanisms underlying bacterial inactivation were not known. The {{goal of this}} study is to understand the cellular responses of Escherichia coli and to investigate the properties of plasma-activated PBS. The plasma-activated PBS induces severe oxidative stress in E. coli cells and reactive-oxygen species scavengers, α-tocopherol and catalase, protect E. coli from cell death. Here we show that the response of E. coli to plasma-activated PBS is regulated by OxyR and SoxyRS regulons, and mediated predominantly through the expression of katG that deactivates plasma-generated oxidants. During compensation of E. coli in the absence of both katG and katE, sodA and sodB are significantly overexpressed in samples exposed to plasma-treated PBS. Microarray analysis found that up-regulation of genes involved in DNA repair, and E. coli expressing recA::lux fusion was extremely sensitive to the SOS response upon exposure to plasma-treated PBS. The cellular changes include rapid loss of E. coli membrane potential and membrane integrity, lipid peroxidation, accumulation of 8 -hydroxy-deoxyguinosine (8 OHdG), and severe oxidative DNA damage; reveal ultimate DNA disintegration, and cell death. Together, these data suggest that plasma-treated PBS <b>contains</b> <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> and superoxide like reactive species or/and their products which lead to oxidative changes to cell components, and are eventually responsible for cell death...|$|E

Objectives: The present study was carried out with an aim of evaluating in vitro the effects of the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide,</b> carbamide peroxide and sodium bicarbonate contained in dentifrice formulations, on human tooth enamel. Materials and Methods: After darkening process in laboratory, human premolars were brushed using dentifrice containing the two whitening substances (Rembrandt - carbamide peroxide and Mentadent - <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide)</b> and the abrasive product (Colgate - sodium bicarbonate).
