For long, the internal organisations of the party were largely unknown to the general public, the spokeswoman and regular presidential candidate Arlette Laguiller being the only party leader appearing in public. Even to party members, some leaders were known only by cadre names. The party justified such secrecy measures by the possibility that it may have to enter clandestinity, should a highly repressive government take power. For similar reasons, marriages and children were strongly discouraged.|$|R
50|$|John Adams went in {{a company}} in Sir Charles Hobby's {{regiment}} to the capture of Port Royal in 1710, and in Annapolis Adams must have {{established himself as a}} trader with Boston very soon after the capture was effected. In the town, as a person of importance, Governor Philipps found him in 1720, and when Philipps organized the council, he soon appointed him one of this board. On the 28th of April, 1720, Adams took his seat on the council, and henceforth until 1740 there was no more active member of the Nova Scotia government than he. In 1725 he was appointed Deputy Collector of the port, and when Col. Lawrence Armstrong, lieutenant-governor of the province, committed suicide, December 5, 1739, Mr. Adams as senior <b>councillor</b> <b>in</b> residence assumed <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> the government.

Labour claimed the Conservatives ran Wales as a colonial outpost and relied on a 'quango-state' of Tory [...] to maintain control. Ian McCartney (Labour) attacking the Conservative record in Wales said:"The Welsh Secretary appointed Ian Grist, a former Tory Minister, to head the South Glamorgan health authority. He was defeated by his constituents but given a job by the Tories. The secretary to Gwilym Jones, another Welsh Office Minister, was also appointed to the South Glamorgan health authority.

[...] The Labour MP, David Hanson made repeated attacks on Pedley in the Commons: [...] "What does the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Evans) have in common with one of my constituents, Philip Pedley? The hon. Gentleman is a Conservative Member of Parliament; Philip Pedley is a failed Tory candidate. They have both been deputy chairman of Housing for Wales which services my constituents. I could go on. What does the chauffeur to the Secretary of State for Employment in the general election have in common with many of these people? He is on a board and he is a Tory party member.

50|$|This event (held in Manfredonia, his hometown) {{represents}} - as said by Mrs. Billa Consiglio, {{who was at}} {{the time}} a <b>Councillor</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> Cultural Policy in the Province of Foggia - an element in the culture of our land. Thanks to this event, the Province of Foggia celebrates one of his most famous children by producing one of the best events devoted to the music of the past decades. During the press conference before the event, Councillor Billa Consiglio recalled that Pino Rucher was (in the post- war Italian music world) one of the most prolific and in a way one of the more innovative artists. She concluded by saying that Pino Rucher was not only a great guitarist, but also {{one of the first to}} understand and experiment with the technique and the music genres that the dramatic Second World War had brought to Italy. And it is just for this life-time prestigious activity of his that the Municipal Authority of Manfredonia decided to give a street his name and to honor guitarist Pino Rucher with this event which took place in Piazza Giovanni XXIII (Manfredonia’s central square) on October 5, 2008, and saw the participation of such famous singers as Carla Boni, Giorgio Consolini, Aura D’Angelo and Miranda Martino. Among the other artists and famous figures who took part in the event were Silvano Chimenti (RAI guitarist), Franco De Gemini (who played the harmonica in Italian westerns), Giuseppe Mastroianni (sound technician), Elvio Monti (composer and orchestra conductor), Carlo Posio (jazz pianist and RAI entertainer), Dario Salvatori (RAI entertainer and musicologist). Stelvio Cipriani, Nora Orlandi, Teddy Reno and Iva Zanicchi telephoned during the event and spoke about Rucher’s artistic merit as one of the major Italian guitarists, as Aura D’Angelo said while speaking to the audience. Afterwards the Mayor of Manfredonia Mr. Paolo Campo and the Honourable Mr. Antonio Leone, vice President of the Chamber of Deputies, made a brief speech and gave Pino Rucher’s family a memorial from the Town Hall and the Chamber of Deputies. Then Mr. Antonio Pepe and Mrs. Billa Consiglio, President and Councillor of the province of Foggia respectively, also spoke to the audience. The event was shot by the RAI cameraman Pino Ciociola and was later included in a TV cover by Mr. Enzo Del Vecchio, a journalist of RAI 3, the regional television channel.|$|E
5000|$|In January 1593 Magauran had {{travelled}} on to Fermanagh {{where he}} stayed with Hugh Maguire. Sir George Bingham {{wrote to his}} brother Richard from Ballymote on 3 January 1593 as follows- [...] "James O'Crean came lately out of the north from Hugh Roe O'Donnell, where as he saith, he saw seven bishops. Some of them he named unto me. But the chiefest among them was the Bishop M'Gawran, whom the Pope hath made Lord Primate of all Ireland. They were in great Council {{for two or three}} days together, and have some great despatch of certain letters, which shall be sent out of hand (as James O'Crean saith) by Bishop O'Hely to the Pope and the King of Spain. He further learned by the Primate M'Gawran that the King of Spain came into France by Waggon and brought his daughter with him to be married to the Duke of Guise. The Primate himself came in his company, and that the King determined to send two armies this next summer, the one for England, the other for Ireland, and the army that should come for Ireland should come by Scotland and land in the north, but their only want was to have some great man here to be (as it were) their leader or general, and have now thought Hugh Roe O'Donnell to be 'the most fittest' for the same. The Primate himself landed at Drogheda, and staid there two or three days after his landing. All which I have thought good to signify unto you, that you may advertise the Lord Deputy thereof. And if it be his pleasure to lay privy at Drogheda, no doubt the Bishop O'Hely may be apprehended, and with him all their practises will be found out. This Bishop M'Gawran is now in Maguire's country and is most relieved there". More meetings were held with the local chiefs and on 4 April 1593, Archbishop Magauran wrote to King Philip's <b>councillor</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> British matters, Juan de Idiáquez y Olazábal, to inform him that all the Gaelic lords promised to support a Spanish invasion, amongst whom were O'Donnell, the Bourkes and O'Rourke. On 7 April Hugh Roe O'Donnell followed up with another letter to King Philip confirming it was a good idea to invade as it would cost little and would divert the English from Spanish Flanders. On 11 April 1593, Patrick M'Arte Moyle M'Mahon gave evidence at Monaghan [...] "of the assemblies sworn by M'Gawran, the titular Primate, to help the Spaniards, who would arrive before mid-May, 1593". A further letter dated 8 May from Enniskillen Castle requested an army of up to 10,000 men by 8 September and was signed by Edmund Magauran, Hugh Maguire, Brian Ogge O'Rourke, six northern bishops and others. All the aforesaid letters from the Irish leaders were entrusted to the Archbishop of Tuam Seamus Ó hÉilidhe but he did not arrive in Spain until September 1593. In the meantime trouble started in Fermanagh when the English appointed a sheriff there in May 1593. Hugh Maguire threw the sheriff out of Fermanagh and about 1 June 1593 held a council with the other Northern chiefs. On 19 June 1593, Moris O'Skanlon upon examination declared-"that about Thursday was seven night June 1593, Sir Hugh Maguire, Cormock M'Barron Henry Oge, Alexander M'Donnell Oge, Shane Evarry, brother to Maguire, and the supposed Primate called Edmond M'Gawran, met upon a hill in Slight Art's country of Sir Turlough O'Neill's country bounding upon Fermanagh, where the said Edmond held a book, whereupon the said parties took their oath; but what it was this examinate knoweth not, but by hearsay, for that he stood sixty yards off, and as he heard it was that they should faithfully join together in all their doings and actions. The cause of his knowledge is that he was then present and saw every of them take the book from the pretended Primate and put it towards their heads, and heard the report as before; and for a further testimony he saith, that he sent the Seneschal of Monaghan word by his own messenger the same evening that he should be well upon his keeping, for that he feared they would come to prey his country". Hugh Maguire then went to O'Rourke's aid against Sir George Bingham, the President of Connacht by attacking Ballymote in County Sligo. Sir Richard Bingham wrote to Burghley on 6 June 1593 (forwarded by Sir H. Bagenall). [...] "One M'Gawran who terms himself Primate, doth much mischief riding on his chief horse, with his staff and shirt of mail. Tirone's own foster brothers at the burning of Ballymote". A dispute arose amongst the O'Rourkes and Maguires about the division of the spoils from Ballymote and Archbishop Magauran tried to settle it. He wrote to Hugh Oge O'Rourke in Gaelic, which was translated into English as follows - [...] "Magawran, the titular primate of Armagh, hath him commended unto you, Hugh Oge O'Rourke. These are to let you to understand that Maguire appointed me to make as good agreements between you and Brian Oge O'Rourke as possibly I may, which if it may not be effected, to signify unto him which of you hinders it. Therefore I request you to meet a Saturday in some convenient place of appointment, and I with certain gentlemen of Maguires, as Shane M'Hughe's and Brian M'Hughe's children, will meet you. But I request you not to come with any train, and yet not to fail, if ever you will have my favour, to meet for this agreement". On 13 June 1593, Thadie Nolan, one of Her Majesty's pursuivants declared at Dundalk that-"The Earl of Tirone's great hatred to Marshal Bagenall. Assistance to Maguire. The O'Hagans who killed Phelim M'Tirlough are conversant with the Earl of Tirone. 180 Scots landed. M'Sweeny Ne Doe doth join Maguire with 400 galloglas. The North standeth altogether at the pleasure of the Earl and the pretended Primate Magawran". On 15 June 1593, the Lord Deputy and Council were in Dundalk where they examined the aforesaid Patrick M'Arte Moyle M'Mahon who informed them that- [...] "Bishop M'Gawran's promise of forces out of Spain. The messages sent to him by Henry Oge O'Neill not to expose himself to danger." [...] On 18 June 1593, Marshall Bagenall stated that he was informed- [...] "The Earl of Tirone's command for wasting the barony of Cremorne. Confederacy between O'Donnell, Maguire, the titular Primate M'Gawran, and the Earl of Tirone." [...] On 20 June 1593, William Moate declared at Dundalk-"that the Earl of Tirone, O'Donnell, Maguire, and Primate Magawran, received the sacrament together at Strabane". On 25 June 1593, Sir Morish O'Cullen, the Chancellor of Armagh, stated at Dundalk that- [...] "Thurlough O'Boile has got the treasurership of Armagh from the Primate M'Gawran." ...|$|E
