500|$|The fishing {{industry}} on Dal {{is the second}} largest industry {{in the region and}} is central to many of the people's livelihoods who reside on the lake's periphery. Dal's commercial fisheries are particularly reliant on carp fish species, which were introduced into the lake in 1957. As a result, carp constitutes 70% of all the fish caught in the lake while the schizothonax constitutes 20% and other species account for 10%. Fishermen use a locally manufactured <b>cast</b> <b>net</b> which comprises six parts with a diameter of 6 metres. It is operated from a wooden fishing boat made out of deodar, typically 20ftx4ft in size. The gradual decline in quality of the lake water through pollution has resulted in lower fish stocks and the extinction of endemic varieties of fish. The causes for such deterioration have been identified and remedial actions have been initiated.The various fishing nets being used in Dal are <b>cast</b> <b>net</b> (Zaal/Duph), Long line (Walruz), Gill net (Pachi, Shaitan zaal), Rod and line (Bislai), Scoop net (Attha zaal) (Bhat et al., 2008) ...|$|E
2500|$|Sillaginids {{are taken}} {{by a variety of}} fishing methods, with inshore catches {{predominantly}} taken using beach seine nets and cast nets. Due to the alert nature of sillaginids, skill is required on creeping up quietly {{enough to be able to}} net fish with a <b>cast</b> <b>net,</b> with experienced fishers often paddling into the sun toward a school and drifting slowly upon it before casting the net. In deeper waters, commercial trawlers and longliners take the most fish, with a number of sillaginids taken in prawn trawls as bycatch. The fish are normally marketed fresh locally under various names, with [...] "Ashuos" [...] commonly used in many countries for various sillaginids. At least one export fishery exists in Australia whereby S. flindersi is exported to Thailand where the fish are repackaged and sent to Japan frozen.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe key {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to analyze the sampling efficiency of various fish sampling gears for a lentic ecosystem health assessment. A fish survey for the lentic ecosystem health assessment model was sampled twice from 30 reservoirs during 2008 – 2012. During the study, fishes of 81 species comprising 53, 792 individuals were sampled from 30 reservoirs. A comparison of sampling gears showed that <b>casting</b> <b>nets</b> were the best sampling gear with high species richness (69 species), whereas minnow traps were the worst gear with low richness (16 species). Fish sampling efficiency, based on the number of individual catch per unit effort, was best in fyke nets (28, 028 individuals) and worst in minnow traps (352 individuals). When we compared trammel nets and kick nets versus fyke <b>nets</b> and <b>casting</b> <b>nets,</b> the former were useful in terms of the number of fish individuals but not in terms of the number of fish species...|$|R
40|$|This study aims to {{estimate}} the biomass of fish stocks {{in the area of}} the dam formed by tailings of Sossego mine in Canaã dos Carajás, captured with the use of <b>cast</b> <b>nets</b> for fish. The prospecting work was carried out during the period from 29 February to 6 March 2004, 6 months after closing the dam and immediately before the disposal of waste. The average values estimated for the capture per unit area covered by <b>cast</b> <b>nets</b> (CPUA) and biomass were 8. 4 g m-² and 16, 922. 7 kg, respectively. The most representative groups of fish were minnows, with 67. 7 % and discus with 24. 8 % of the total estimated biomass. The species caught were: Moenkhausia cf. sanctaefilomenae (redeye tetra fish), Tetragonopterus cf. argenteus (white tetra fish), Tetragonopterus chalceus (red tetra fish), Aequidens viridis (cichlasoma bimaculatum) Crenicichla cincta (jacunda) Hoplerythrinus unitaeniatus (jeju) Curimata inornata (branquinha) and Hoplias malabaricus (trahira).

50|$|The Kayal {{directly}} {{serves as}} the means of livelihood of thousands of fishermen. The chief catch is grey millets and prawns.

The majority of fish are caught using any one of <b>cast</b> <b>net,</b> gill net, scare net, seine net, dip net, ring net, scoope net or trap. Arattupuzha, a fishing village on the bank of Kayamkulam Kayal, is famous for chakara mud formation resulting from thronging of large amount of fish and prawns.|$|E
