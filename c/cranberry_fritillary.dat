40|$|Population {{viability}} analyses (PVA) {{are central}} tools {{for the management}} of threatened populations. However, the parameterisation of effective PVA models is very demanding in high quality data, which are often impossible to collect on endangered populations. Here we propose the use of a generalisation strategy to bypass this limitation: management measures for an endangered metapopulation of the <b>cranberry</b> <b>fritillary</b> butterfly in the Netherlands are evaluated with RAMAS/GIS by using parameters estimated from a healthier metapopulation in Belgium. The Belgian metapopulation seems viable, with stable abundance and number of local populations, despite their erratic dynamics, whereas the Dutch metapopulation shows a continuous decline in the course of time, with many vacant habitat patches. Simulations of various scenarios indicated that (1) large scale restoration of habitat patches would be necessary to ensure long-term survival of the species in the Netherlands as not enough suitable habitats are currently remaining; and that (2) global warming is expected to put a major threat on both metapopulations by reducing the growth rate of this glacial relict species, aud/or increasing environmental stochasticity (amplified climatic variations) ...|$|E
40|$|The spatial {{structure}} and dynamics of local populations of an endangered specialist butterfly, the <b>cranberry</b> <b>fritillary</b> Boloria aquilonaris living on peat bogs was studied in Southern Belgium. Seventeen populations an the Ardenne uplands (Plateau des Tailles, Hautes-Fagnes, Plateau de Recogne, Plateau de St-Hubert) and one {{population in the}} forested lowlands of Lorraine were monitored in 1996. The population structure and dynamics were investigated on the "Plateau des Tailles", the most important area for B. aquilonaris in Belgium with 12 distinct populations. A. mark-release-recapture survey was carried out on four sites in 1995 and 1996 within an area of 85 km(2). An unexpectedly high degree of interchange was detected between sites. This connectivity, together with the asynchrony of local dynamics suggest that populations act as a single metapopulation within the whole study area. We observed that adult butterflies were less prone {{to move out of}} their natal patch when this patch was small (< 1 ha), isolated and sheltered. Therefore, such patches must also be taken into account when planning the conservation of the species. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The genetic {{population}} {{structure of the}} <b>Cranberry</b> <b>Fritillary</b> Boloria aquilonaris was studied using both RAPDs (random amplified polymorphic DNA) and allozymes. In Belgium, B. aquilonaris has a naturally fragmented distribution that has been accentuated due to human activity during the last century. The genetic {{population structure}} of this butterfly was analysed at the regional (several Ardenne uplands) and at the landscape level (several populations within an Ardenne upland). Both population genetic markers confirmed results from a previous CMR study at the landscape scale. At the regional scale however, important incongruences were observed between RAPDs and allozymes. The average gene diversity for the RAPD data was twice that of the allozyme data. The degree of population subdivision was also much greater for RAPDs than for allozymes. The UPGMA clusters produced by each of these markers differed significantly. We believe that, given the higher rate of mutation of RAPDs and the greater number of loci assayed by this method, RAPDs reveal a more accurate and recent population genetic structure than allozymes...|$|E
40|$|The {{design of}} {{appropriate}} biodiversity conservation actions requires an extensive knowledge of biotope and species distributions. Biodiversity monitoring {{is often a}} time-consuming task; however, it can be optimised by biotope and species distribution models. In the Lifewatch project, a database combining segmentation in homogeneous landscape units (“ecotopes”) and environmental attributes derived from regularly updated remote sensing data (land cover, topography, potential solar energy,…) and other data sources (climate and edaphic factors) has been designed. Our aim {{was to assess the}} usefulness of this database for biotope and species distribution modelling. As a case study, the distributions of a peatbogs (actual and potential) and of a peatbog specialist butterfly (the <b>cranberry</b> <b>fritillary</b> Boloria aquilonaris (Stichel, 1908)) were independently modelled, using the Random Forest algorithm. The agreement between the biotope and species distribution models was assessed. Our map of predictions was compared to a model derived from a more classical grid-based approach. We observed that ecotope segmentation fitted more closely objective limits on the field, thereby improving the efficiency of biodiversity monitoring. The comparison between actual and potential biotopes allowed us to identify potential restoration areas...|$|E
