5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} is {{a product}} of combustion of organic matter under conditions of restricted oxygen supply, which prevents <b>complete</b> <b>oxidation</b> to carbon dioxide (CO2). Sources of carbon monoxide include cigarette smoke, house fires, faulty furnaces, heaters, wood-burning stoves, internal combustion vehicle exhaust, electrical generators, propane-fueled equipment such as portable stoves, and gasoline-powered tools such as leaf blowers, lawn mowers, high-pressure washers, concrete cutting saws, power trowels, and welders. Exposure typically occurs when equipment is used in buildings or semi-enclosed spaces.|$|E
5|$|Triglycerides, {{stored in}} adipose tissue, {{are a major}} form of energy storage both in animals and plants. The adipocyte, or fat cell, is {{designed}} for continuous synthesis and breakdown of triglycerides in animals, with breakdown controlled mainly by the activation of hormone-sensitive enzyme lipase. The <b>complete</b> <b>oxidation</b> of fatty acids provides high caloric content, about 9kcal/g, compared with 4kcal/g for the breakdown of carbohydrates and proteins. Migratory birds that must fly long distances without eating use stored energy of triglycerides to fuel their flights.|$|E
5|$|Silver metal {{is a good}} {{catalyst}} for oxidation reactions; {{in fact it is}} somewhat too good for most purposes, as finely divided silver tends to result in <b>complete</b> <b>oxidation</b> of organic substances to carbon dioxide and water, and hence coarser-grained silver tends to be used instead. For instance, 15% silver supported on α-Al2O3 or silicates is a {{catalyst for}} the oxidation of ethylene to ethylene oxide at 230–270°C. Dehydrogenation of methanol to formaldehyde is conducted at 600–720°C over silver gauze or crystals as the catalyst, as is dehydrogenation of isopropanol to acetone. In the gas phase, glycol yields glyoxal and ethanol yields acetaldehyde, while organic amines are dehydrated to nitriles.|$|E

Oxidation state, size, and dispersion of Au nanoparticles in the Au-catalysts, surface area, crystallinity, phase structure, and redox property of the support are the key aspects for the <b>complete</b> propane <b>oxidation.</b> Among the studied Au-catalysts, the AuHAuCl 4 -Ce catalyst is found to be the most active catalyst...|$|R
30|$|The high {{activity}} and selectivity of the OMS- 2 RS sample for cyclohexene formation at {{low and high}} temperature related to the high surface area allow the available active sites on the catalyst surface. Besides, high average pore diameter ~ 12  nm allows the easy desorption of cyclohexene intermediate before <b>completing</b> the <b>oxidation</b> reaction to oxygenated products. The small average diameter for OMS- 2 RC allows long residence time of the reactant on the active sites of the sample to <b>complete</b> its <b>oxidation</b> cycle to oxygenated products, besides the feasibility of lattice oxygen (as established from TPR results) which facilitates their contribution to the oxidation reaction and shows high selectivity and activity at low temperature.|$|R
25|$|The use of {{chlorites}} {{as terminal}} oxidants {{in conjunction with}} both hypochlorites and TEMPO gives carboxylic acids without chlorination side products. The reaction is usually carried out in two steps in the same pot: partial oxidation is effected with TEMPO and hypochlorite, then chlorite is added to <b>complete</b> the <b>oxidation.</b> Only primary alcohol oxidation is observed. In conjunction with Sharpless dihydroxylation, this method {{can be used to}} generate enantiopure α-hydroxy acids.|$|R
5|$|Beta {{oxidation}} is {{the metabolic}} {{process by which}} fatty acids are broken down in the mitochondria or in peroxisomes to generate acetyl-CoA. For the most part, fatty acids are oxidized by a mechanism that is similar to, but not identical with, {{a reversal of the}} process of fatty acid synthesis. That is, two-carbon fragments are removed sequentially from the carboxyl end of the acid after steps of dehydrogenation, hydration, and oxidation to form a beta-keto acid, which is split by thiolysis. The acetyl-CoA is then ultimately converted into ATP, CO2, and H2O using the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain. Hence the citric acid cycle can start at acetyl-CoA when fat is being broken down for energy if {{there is little or no}} glucose available. The energy yield of the <b>complete</b> <b>oxidation</b> of the fatty acid palmitate is 106 ATP. Unsaturated and odd-chain fatty acids require additional enzymatic steps for degradation.|$|E
25|$|The {{catalyst}} for the reaction is metallic silver deposited on various matrixes, including pumice, silica gel, various silicates and aluminosilicates, alumina and silicon carbide, and activated by certain additives (antimony, bismuth, barium peroxide, etc.). The process temperature was optimized as 220–280°C. Lower temperatures reduce {{the activity of the}} catalyst, and higher temperatures promote the <b>complete</b> <b>oxidation</b> of ethylene thereby reducing the yield of ethylene oxide. Elevated pressure of 1–3 MPa increases the productivity of the catalyst and facilitates absorption of ethylene oxide from the reacting gases.|$|E
25|$|The use {{of carbon}} dioxide overcomes many of the {{problems}} with the original industrial process. Because CO2 is a better flame inhibitor than N2, a CO2 environment allows for the use of pure oxygen directly, instead of air, with reduced flammability hazards. The solubility of molecular oxygen in solution is also enhanced in the CO2 environment. Because more oxygen is available to the system, supercritical carbon dioxide (Tc = 31°C) has more <b>complete</b> <b>oxidation</b> with fewer byproducts, lower carbon monoxide production, less decarboxylation and higher purity than the commercial process.|$|E
