For the late army, about {{one third of the}} army units in the Notitia are cavalry, but in numbers cavalry were a smaller proportion {{of the total}} because cavalry units were on average smaller than infantry units. For example, in the comitatus, cavalry vexillationes were probably half the size of infantry legiones. Overall, the available evidence suggests that the proportion of cavalry was much the same as in the 2nd century. Examples: in 478, a comitatus of 38,000 men <b>contained</b> 8,000 cavalry (21%).

Results illustrated that project construction cost of WWTP <b>containing</b> CAS < EAAS < SBR, operation cost of WWTP <b>containing</b> EAAS < CAS < SBR, maintenance cost of WWTP <b>containing</b> CAS < EAAS < SBR, material cost of WWTP <b>containing</b> CAS < EAAS < SBR, chemical cost of WWTP <b>containing</b> CAS = SBR < CAS, energy cost of WWTP <b>containing</b> CAS < SBR < EAAS and amortization cost of WWTP <b>containing</b> CAS < EAAS < SBR. These results depicted that the WWTP <b>containing</b> CAS process is cost effective. Besides, increase of MLSS does not affect costs of WWTP <b>containing</b> SBR, but increase of this value decreases the total project construction, material and amortization costs of WWTPs <b>containing</b> EAAS and CAS.
