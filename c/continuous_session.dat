In follow-up sessions with a variable number of subperiods, cooperation rates increase nearly linearly as the grid size decreases and, with one-second subperiods, they approach the level seen in <b>continuous</b> <b>sessions.</b> Our data support a strand of theory that explains how the capacity to respond rapidly stabilizes cooperation and destabilizes defection in the prisoner’s dilemma.

Our contributions are threefold. The first contribution is the development of techniques and protocols that improve reliability for time-bounded delivery of large-scale continuous media transmissions in heterogeneous networking environments. The second is an examination of the impact that multicast layering has on fair network transmission. The third is development and evaluation of techniques that can detect whether or not flows share common points of congestion within a network. ...|$|R

In the case of conflicting legislation, a joint sitting of the two houses can be held. However, since the Lok Sabha has twice as many members as the Rajya Sabha, the former would normally hold the greater power. Joint sittings of the Houses of Parliament of India are rare, and {{in the history of the}} Republic, only three such joint-sessions have been held; the latest one for the passage of the 2002 Prevention of Terrorism Act.|$|R

40|$|AbstractLectures, {{particularly}} in Mathematics, worse still in abstract courses such as Linear Algebra, Abstract Algebra and Analysis, often create boredom to some students, {{especially when the}} lectures are delivered in two <b>continuous</b> <b>sessions,</b> or in the afternoon.

We give an illustration of the lectures in Abstract Algebra offered by the author at the School of Mathematical Sciences, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia. Another way of avoiding the students’ boredom is to include some mathematical humours and create a language and terminology corner. This corner can help the students in their research projects and also their theses. This corner might also be helpful to those who wish to submit their papers for publication in the local journals...|$|R
