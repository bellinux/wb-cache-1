A core member of the network is University Health Network, itself a specialized federation of Toronto General Hospital, Princess Margaret <b>Cancer</b> <b>Centre,</b> Toronto Western Hospital, and Toronto Rehabilitation Institute. Physicians in the medical institutes have cross-appointments to faculty and supervisory positions in university departments. The Rotman School of Management developed the discipline and methodology of integrative thinking, upon which the school bases its curriculum. Founded in 1887, the Faculty of Law's emphasis on formal teachings of liberal arts and legal theory was then considered unconventional, but gradually helped shift the country's legal education system away from the apprenticeship model that prevailed until the mid-20th century. The Ontario Institute for Studies in Education is the teachers college of the university, {{affiliated with}} its two laboratory schools, the Institute of Child Study and the University of Toronto Schools. Autonomous institutes at the university include the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics, the Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies and the Fields Institute.|$|E

40|$|Patrice Pinell (2002) has {{analysed}} {{the birth}} of a national policy to fight against cancer in France {{at the beginning of the}} 20 th century and how this policy came to be articulated around a restricted number of hospitals specialised in cancer care. In those times, their characteristics were innovative, since these hospitals should manage research activities and treat patients at the same time while defending a multidisciplinary approach to cancer care. This meant that each medical speciality was to participate in the therapeutic decision process. The defence and promotion of radiotherapy as an emerging technique beside the dominant surgery methods was a major concern for the founders of these <b>cancer</b> <b>centres.</b> From their creation to the 1970 s, these <b>Cancer</b> <b>Centres</b> were the main organisations in charge of cancer patients in France. In 1965, the French government entrusted them with organising consultations for patients in other hospitals in their regions. Until 1972, physicians appointed to the National Commission in charge of advising the government to define a national cancer policy were exclusively drawn from the <b>Cancer</b> <b>Centres,</b> as well. But from then on, things changed. <b>Cancer</b> <b>Centres</b> have faced increasing competition (by Teaching Hospitals and general healthcare organisations) and their legitimacy has bee...|$|R

40|$|Stage at {{diagnosis}} and survival from cancer {{vary according to}} where people live, suggesting some may have delays in diagnosis. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine if time from presentation to treatment was longer for colorectal and breast cancer patients living further from <b>cancer</b> <b>centres,</b> and identify other important factors in delay. Data were collected on 1097 patients with breast and 1223 with colorectal cancer in north and northeast Scotland. Women with breast cancer who lived further from <b>cancer</b> <b>centres</b> were treated more quickly than those living closer to <b>cancer</b> <b>centres</b> (P = 0. 011). Multilevel modelling found that this was largely due to them receiving earlier treatment at hospitals other than <b>cancer</b> <b>centres.</b> Breast lump, change in skin contour, lymphadenopathy, more symptoms and signs, and increasing age predicted faster treatment. Screen detected cancers and private referrals were treated more quickly. For colorectal cancer, time to treatment was similar for people in rural and urban areas. Quicker treatment was associated with palpable rectal or abdominal masses, tenesmus, abdominal pain, frequent GP consultations, age between 50 and 74 years, tumours of the transverse colon, and iron medication at presentation. Delay was associated with past anxiety or depression. There was variation between general practices and treatment appeared quicker at practices with more female general practitioners...|$|R

40|$|There are {{important}} {{gaps in the}} health status of citizens across Europe, as measured by life expectancy, mortality or morbidity data (Report for the European Commission on the health status of the European Union, 2003). Among the main determinants of the major causes of mortality and morbidity, stated in this report, stands recurrently access to quality healthcare. There is a fundamental need to define quality indicators and set minimal levels of performance quality criteria for healthcare. There {{is a need to}} integrate research into healthcare and to provide patients with equity of access to such high quality care. Oncology is a speciality particularly suited to experimenting a first application of accreditation at European level. The Organisation of European Cancer Institutes is a growing network of <b>cancer</b> <b>Centres</b> in Europe. The focus of the OECI is to work with professionals and organisations with regard to prevention, care, research, development, patient’s role and education. In order to fulfil its mission, the OECI initiated in 2002 an accreditation project with three objectives: • to develop a comprehensive accreditation system for oncology care, taking into account prevention, care, research, education and networking. • to set an updated database of <b>cancer</b> <b>centres</b> in Europe, with exhaustive information on their resources and activities (in care, research, education and management) • to develop a global labelling tool dedicated to comprehensive <b>cancer</b> <b>centres</b> in Europe, designating the various types of cancer structures, and the comprehensive <b>cancer</b> <b>centres</b> of reference and Excellence. An accreditation tool has been established, defining standards and criteria for prevention, care, research, education and follow-up activities. A quantitative database of <b>cancer</b> <b>centres</b> is integrated in the tool, with a questionnaire, that provides an overall view of the oncological landscape in OECI <b>cancer</b> <b>centres</b> in Europe. Data on infrastructures, resources and activities have been collected. This OECI accreditation tool will be launched in autumn 2008 for all <b>cancer</b> <b>centres</b> in Europe. It serves as a basis {{for the development of the}} labelling tool for cancer structures in Europe, with a focus on Comprehensiveness and Excellence labels. Quality assessment and improvement is a critical need in Europe and is addressed by the OECI for cancer care in Europe. Accreditation is a well accepted process and is feasible. Standards and criteria as well as an accreditation tool have been developed. The OECI questionnaire gives an accurate vision of cancer institutions throughout Europe, helping assessing the needs and providing standards. The accreditation project is a long-term complete and voluntary process with external and internal added value, an active process of sharing information and experience that should help the whole cancer community reach comprehensiveness and excellence. ...|$|R
