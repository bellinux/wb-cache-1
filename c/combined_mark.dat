This time she joined the expansion Peoria Redwings in 1946 and was back with a last-place team. Lee went 12–23 with a 2.74 ERA as she {{led the league in}} losses. In 1947, pitching sidearm, she began with Peoria and landed with the Grand Rapids Chicks during the midseason. She posted a <b>combined</b> <b>mark</b> of 9–11 with 29 strikeouts and a 2.24 ERA in 24 games. During {{the first round of the}} playoffs, Grand Rapids lost to Rockford in five games.|$|E

50|$|In Maryland's {{season finale}} before an already-secured {{berth in the}} 1952 Sugar Bowl, at halftime Maryland led 35-7. In the second half, coach Tatum fielded mostly reserve players to prevent running up the score. Back Ed Modzelewski had 14 carries for 131 yards and two touchdowns, which outgained the <b>combined</b> <b>mark</b> for the {{opposing}} team for the sixth time of the season. The Maryland defense stifled the West Virginia ground attack, which rushed only eight times for {{a net loss of}} 21 yards. The win preserved Maryland's perfect record, which made it the first undefeated Terrapins team in 57 years.|$|E

50|$|In historical-critical analysis, the L {{source is}} an {{inferred}} oral tradition that Luke used when composing his gospel. It includes the Virgin Birth of Christ {{and many of}} Jesus' best loved parables. Like Matthew's unique source, known as M, the L source has important parables. Two that appear in L are the Good Samaritan and the Prodigal Son.I. Howard Marshall states 'Luke rightly regarded these sources as reliable'.According to the Four Document Hypothesis, Luke <b>combined</b> <b>Mark,</b> the Q source, and L to produce his gospel. The material in L, like that in M, probably comes from the oral tradition. Luke's special material composes nearly half of his gospel.|$|E
50|$|The Maroons {{finished}} fourth with a 5-2-2 record that season, then dropped to 3-3-2 in 1923. Attendance was poor in Toledo, so the franchise moved to Kenosha, Wisconsin, and {{dropped out of}} the league after an 0-4-1 record in 1924. The Maroons ran up a 5-2-2 record in their initial 1922 season. However, the level of competition was suspect. Their opponents' <b>combined</b> <b>mark</b> was only 7-23-2. The Maroons scheduled easy opponents again in 1923 and finished this season at 3-3-2. However, when they were blasted 28-0 in the last game of the season by the Canton Bulldogs, the Toledo squad played its last game.|$|E

Since such facilities display <b>combining</b> <b>marks</b> separately from base characters, it is likely that the precomposed character form of a character will be the more readily recognized of the alternatives.|$|R
