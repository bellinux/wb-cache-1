2500|$|In October 1909, {{the city}} advertised bids for {{lighting}} for the bridge. Four ornamental lampposts, in either bronze or cast iron, were required. Five bids were received in November, R. L. Watmaugh, a Washington architect, received the lighting contract. The lamps were incandescent lights which used a tungsten filament. An armored steel <b>cable,</b> <b>run</b> under the granite curb, provided {{power to the}} lights. Each light gave off 100 watts or 78.48 candela. The lamppost had three globes: [...] A [...] central globe and two [...] side globes. The central globe was [...] above the roadway, and each lamppost was [...] apart.|$|E
2500|$|Divers {{worked to}} tunnel under O-5s bow so lifting cables could be attached. Ajax arrived about midnight, and by early morning, the cable tunnel had been dug, the <b>cable</b> <b>run,</b> and a lift was attempted. [...] Sheppard J. Shreaves, {{supervisor}} of the Panama Canal’s salvage crew and himself a qualified diver, had been working continuously throughout the night to dig the tunnel, snake the cable under the submarine, and hook it to Ajax’s hoist. Now the lift began. As the crane took a strain, the lift cables broke. Shreaves and his crew worked another cable set under the bow and again Ajax pulled. Again, the cable broke. All through the day, the men worked. Shreaves {{had been in his}} diving suit nearly 24 hours. As midnight on [...] the 29th approached, the crane was ready for another lift, this time with buoyancy being added by blowing water out of the flooded Engine Room. Then, just after midnight, the bow of O-5 broke the surface. Men from the salvage force quickly opened the torpedo room hatch, and Breault and Brown emerged into the fresh air.|$|E

50|$|Venues that host {{television}} productions fairly often, such {{as sports}} arenas, will usually have triaxial <b>cables</b> <b>run</b> from {{the location of}} the TV truck to common camera locations throughout the building.

60|$|It would {{obviously}} be useless {{to go back}} with rations that would barely suffice for the march. Vane still had food enough to keep life in one man for a little while, {{and it would not}} be a long run to Comox with a strong northerly wind. If the sloop would face the sea that was running he might return with assistance before his comrade's scanty store was exhausted. Getting out the mildewed chart, he laid off his course, carefully trimmed and lighted the binnacle lamp, and going up on deck hauled in the kedge-anchor. He could not break the main one out, though he worked savagely with a tackle, and deciding to slip it, he managed to lash three reefs in the mainsail and hoist it with the peak left down. Then he stopped to gather breath--for the work had been cruelly heavy--before he let the <b>cable</b> <b>run</b> and hoisted the jib.|$|E

60|$|As they glided slowly on, keeping {{under the}} shore and sneaking in and out among the {{shipping}} by back-alleys of water, in a pilfering way {{that seemed to be}} their boatman's normal manner of progression, all the objects among which they crept were so huge in contrast with their wretched boat, as to threaten to crush it. Not a ship's hull, with its rusty iron links of <b>cable</b> <b>run</b> out of hawse-holes long discoloured with the iron's rusty tears, but seemed to be there with a fell intention. Not a figure-head but had the menacing look of bursting forward to run them down. Not a sluice gate, or a painted scale upon a post or wall, showing the depth of water, but seemed to hint, like the dreadfully facetious Wolf in bed in Grandmamma's cottage, 'That's to drown YOU in, my dears!' Not a lumbering black barge, with its cracked and blistered side impending over them, but seemed to suck at the river with a thirst for sucking them under. And everything so vaunted the spoiling influences of water--discoloured copper, rotten wood, honey-combed stone, green dank deposit--that the after-consequences of being crushed, sucked under, and drawn down, looked as ugly to the imagination as the main event.|$|E

50|$|Compared to {{unbalanced}} circuits, balanced lines {{reduce the}} amount of noise per distance, allowing a longer <b>cable</b> <b>run</b> to be practical. This is because electromagnetic interference will affect both signals the same way. Similarities between the two signals are automatically removed {{at the end of the}} transmission path when one signal is subtracted from the other.|$|E
50|$|Conventional {{systems that}} {{distribute}} the electrical satellite IF signal via a star network of coaxial cable require one relatively short <b>cable</b> <b>run</b> {{from the central}} distribution equipment to each tuner connected to the system, whereas in a fibre system, cables can be very long, and split at successive locations, in a tree structure without detriment to the reception.|$|E
25|$|The Swedish <b>cable</b> <b>ran</b> from Sweden, and the United States cable {{from the}} United States embassy in Denmark. However, neither <b>cable</b> <b>ran</b> {{directly}} to the United States. Both cables passed through a relay station at Porthcurno, near Land's End, the westernmost tip of England. Here the signals were boosted for the long trans-oceanic jump. All traffic through the Porthcurno relay was copied to British intelligence, in particular to the codebreakers and analysts in Room 40 at the Admiralty.|$|R

50|$|The high {{signaling}} {{level of}} 5 VDC {{is used to}} accommodate long cable runs from card readers to the associated access control panel, typically located in a secure closet. Most card reader manufacturers publish a maximum <b>cable</b> <b>run</b> of 500 feet (150m). An advantage of the Wiegand signaling format {{is that it allows}} very long cable runs, far longer than other interface standards of its day allowed.|$|E
50|$|For comparison, while single-line, voice-grade copper systems {{longer than}} a couple of {{kilometers}} require in-line signal repeaters for satisfactory performance; {{it is not unusual for}} optical systems to go over 100 km, with no active or passive processing. Single-mode fiber cables are commonly available in 12 km lengths, minimizing the number of splices required over a long <b>cable</b> <b>run.</b> Multi-mode fiber is available in lengths up to 4 km, although industrial standards only mandate 2 km unbroken runs.|$|E
