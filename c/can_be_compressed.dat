According to the Institute for Traditional Medicine, common methods for the preparation of herbal medicines include decoction, powdering, and extraction with alcohol, in each case yielding a mixture of substances. Decoction involves crushing and then boiling the plant material in water to produce a liquid extract. Powdering involves drying the plant material and then crushing it to yield a powder that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>compressed</b> into tablets. Alcohol extraction involves soaking the plant material in cold wine or distilled spirit to form a tincture.|$|E

25|$|Compressors {{are similar}} to pumps: both {{increase}} the pressure on a fluid and both can transport the fluid through a pipe. As gases are compressible, the compressor also reduces the volume of a gas. Liquids are relatively incompressible; while some <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>compressed,</b> the main action of a pump is to pressurize and transport liquids.|$|E

25|$|Hooke's law {{is only a}} first-order linear {{approximation}} to the real response of springs and other elastic bodies to applied forces.

25|$|The median nerve <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>compressed</b> by a {{decrease}} {{in the size of the}} canal, an increase in the size of the contents (such as the swelling of lubrication tissue around the flexor tendons), or both. Since the carpal tunnel is bordered by carpal bones on one side and a ligament on the other, when the pressure builds up inside the tunnel, there is nowhere for it to escape and thus it ends up pressing up against and damaging the median nerve. Simply flexing the wrist to 90 degrees will decrease the size of the canal.|$|E
25|$|Chemical {{reactions}} yield LiH in {{the form}} of lumped powder, which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>compressed</b> into pellets without a binder. More complex shapes can be produced by casting from the melt. Large single crystals (about 80nbsp&mm long and 16nbsp&mm in diameter) can be then grown from molten LiH powder in hydrogen atmosphere by the Bridgman–Stockbarger technique. They often have bluish color owing to the presence of colloidal Li. This color can be removed by post-growth annealing at lower temperatures (~550nbsp&°C) and lower thermal gradients. Major impurities in these crystals are Na (20–200 parts per million, ppm), O (10–100 ppm), Mg (0.5–6 ppm), Fe (0.5-2 ppm) and Cu (0.5-2 ppm).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the idea of}} naturally encoding three-dimensional (3 D) range data into regular two-dimensional (2 D) images utilizing computer graphics rendering pipeline. The computer graphics pipeline provides a means to sample 3 D geometry data into regular 2 D images, and also to retrieve the depth information for each sampled pixel. The depth information for each pixel is further encoded into red, green, and blue color channels of regular 2 D images. The 2 D images <b>can</b> further <b>be</b> <b>compressed</b> with existing 2 D image compression techniques. By this novel means, 3 D geometry data obtained by 3 D range scanners <b>can</b> <b>be</b> instantaneously <b>compressed</b> into 2 D images, providing a novel way of storing 3 D range data into its 2 D counterparts. We will present experimental results to verify the performance of this proposed technique...|$|R
25|$|The {{shock wave}} {{is one of}} several {{different}} ways in which a gas in a supersonic flow <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>compressed.</b> Some other methods are isentropic compressions, including Prandtl-Meyer compressions. The method of compression of a gas results in different temperatures and densities for a given pressure ratio which can be analytically calculated for a non-reacting gas. A shock wave compression results in a loss of total pressure, meaning that it is a less efficient method of compressing gases for some purposes, for instance in the intake of a scramjet. The appearance of pressure-drag on supersonic aircraft is mostly due to the effect of shock compression on the flow.|$|E
25|$|A {{liquid is}} a nearly {{incompressible}} fluid that {{conforms to the}} shape of its container but retains a (nearly) constant volume independent of pressure. As such, {{it is one of the}} four fundamental states of matter (the others being solid, gas, and plasma), and is the only state with a definite volume but no fixed shape. A liquid is made up of tiny vibrating particles of matter, such as atoms, held together by intermolecular bonds. Water is, by far, the most common liquid on Earth. Like a gas, a liquid is able to flow and take the shape of a container. Most liquids resist compression, although others <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>compressed.</b> Unlike a gas, a liquid does not disperse to fill every space of a container, and maintains a fairly constant density. A distinctive property of the liquid state is surface tension, leading to wetting phenomena.|$|E
25|$|Separators {{have been}} used as part of data {{compression}} algorithms for representing planar graphs and other separable graphs using a small number of bits. The basic principle of these algorithms is to choose a number k and repeatedly subdivide the given planar graph using separators into O(n/k) subgraphs of size at most k, with O(n/√k) vertices in the separators. With an appropriate choice of k (at most proportional to the logarithm of n) the number of non-isomorphic k-vertex planar subgraphs is significantly less than the number of subgraphs in the decomposition, so the graph <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>compressed</b> by constructing a table of all the possible non-isomorphic subgraphs and representing each subgraph in the separator decomposition by its index into the table. The remainder of the graph, formed by the separator vertices, may be represented explicitly or by using a recursive version of the same data structure. Using this method, planar graphs and many more restricted families of planar graphs may be encoded using a number of bits that is information-theoretically optimal: if there are Pn n-vertex graphs in the family of graphs to be represented, then an individual graph in the family can be represented using only (1nbsp&+nbsp&o(n))log2Pn bits. It is also possible to construct representations of this type in which one may test adjacency between vertices, determine the degree of a vertex, and list neighbors of vertices in constant time per query, by augmenting the table of subgraphs with additional tabular information representing the answers to the queries.|$|E

500|$|The pudendal nerve <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>compressed</b> or stretched, {{resulting}} in temporary or permanent neuropathy. Irreversible nerve injury may occur when nerves are stretched by 12% {{or more of}} their normal length. If the pelvic floor is over-stretched, acutely (e.g. prolonged or difficult childbirth) or chronically (e.g. chronic straining during defecation caused by constipation), the pudendal nerve is vulnerable to stretch-induced neuropathy. Pudendal nerve entrapment, also known as Alcock canal syndrome, is very rare and is associated with professional cycling. Systemic diseases such as diabetes and multiple sclerosis can damage the pudendal nerve via demyelination or other mechanisms. [...] A pelvic tumor (most notably a large sacrococcygeal teratoma), or surgery to remove the tumor, can also cause permanent damage.|$|E
500|$|Another {{challenge}} that the studio {{had to face}} was to deliver shots of heavy and deep snow that both interacted believably with characters and had a realistic sticky quality. According to principal software engineer Andrew Selle, [...] "'s not really a fluid. It’s not really a solid. It breaks apart. It <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>compressed</b> into snowballs. All of these different effects {{are very difficult to}} capture simultaneously." [...] In order to achieve this, software engineers used advanced mathematics (the material point method) and physics, with assistance from mathematics researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles to create a snow simulator software application called Matterhorn. The tool was capable of depicting realistic snow in a virtual environment and was used in at least 43 scenes in the film, including several key sequences. Software engineer Alexey Stomakhin referred to snow as [...] "an important character in the film," [...] therefore it attracted special attention from the filmmakers. [...] "When you stretch it, snow will break into chunks. Since snow doesn't have any connections, it doesn't have a mesh, it can break very easily. So that was an important property we took advantage of," [...] explained Selle. [...] "There you see [...] walking through and see his footprints breaking the snow into little pieces and chunk up and you see [...] being pulled out and the snow having packed together and broken into pieces. It's very organic how that happens. You don't see that they're pieces already– you see the snow as one thing and then breaking up." [...] The tool also proved to be particularly useful in scenes involving characters walking through deep snow, as it ensured that the snow reacted naturally to each step.|$|E
