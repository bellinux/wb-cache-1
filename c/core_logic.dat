40|$|Abstract—Manufacturing {{processes}} in the nanoscale era are less reliable leading to lower yields. As memories {{are the most important}} contributor to SoC (System-on-Chip) yield, fault tolerance techniques based on redundancy are generally used to improved memory yield. Conversely, <b>logic</b> <b>cores</b> embedded in SoC usually do not have these important features and manufacturing defects affecting these cores decrease the yield of the entire SoC. Therefore, meaningful techniques for SoC yield improvement must also consider <b>logic</b> <b>cores.</b> In this paper, we propose and investigate the use of TMR (Triple Modular Redundancy) architectures for <b>logic</b> <b>cores</b> to increase the overall SoC yield. We also propose to improve the defect tolerance capabilities of TMR architectures by partitioning <b>logic</b> <b>cores</b> and adding voters on <b>logic</b> <b>core’s</b> cuts. Results show that this improvement of the TMR architecture is very fruitful to improve its tolerance capability with a low overhead in term of silicon area. Results obtained on SoC examples (ISCAS’ 85 and ITC’ 99 benchmark circuits as <b>logic</b> <b>cores</b> merged with memory cores with different rates) demonstrate the interest of using TMR architectures for <b>logic</b> <b>cores</b> for SoC yield enhancement.

40|$|As {{integrated}} circuits {{become more and}} more complex, the ability to make post-fabrication changes will {{become more and more}} attractive. This ability can be realized using programmable <b>logic</b> <b>cores.</b> Currently, such cores are available from vendors {{in the form of a}} "hard" layout. In this paper, we focus on an alternative approach: vendors supply a synthesizable version of their programmable <b>logic</b> <b>core</b> (a "soft" core) and the integrated circuit designer synthesizes the programmable logic fabric using standard cells. Although this technique suffers increased speed, density, and power overhead, the task of integrating such cores is far easier than the task of integrating "hard" cores into an ASIC. For very small amounts of logic, this ease of use may be more important than the increased overhead. This paper presents two synthesizable programmable <b>logic</b> <b>core</b> architectures, describes the associated place and route CAD tools, and compares the two architectures to each other, and to a "hard" programmable <b>logic</b> <b>core.</b> It also shows how these cores can be made more efficient by creating a non-rectangular architecture, an option not available to "hard" core vendors...|$|R

It is now widely accepted that projects and programmes are at the centre of strategy implementation. However, the conditions and underlying assumptions of this dynamic relationship are still unclear.

Building on this 'archetypology' the authors demonstrate how project management, through enactment and sense-making of strategy, enables organizations to face the challenge of complexity and uncertainty. While recognizing that the "traditional" methods of analysis and management remain valid under certain conditions, this paper offers new avenues of reflection concerning the necessary contextualization of the project management approaches in order to ensure coherence between archetypes, enactment, learning and decision-making...|$|R
