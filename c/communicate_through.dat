5|$|According to {{the earlier}} {{official}} version of his identification from a U.S. official, identification of al-Qaeda couriers was an early priority for interrogators at CIA black sites and the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, because bin Laden was believed to <b>communicate</b> <b>through</b> such couriers while concealing his whereabouts from al-Qaeda foot soldiers and top commanders. Bin Laden was known not to use phones after 1998, when the U.S. had launched missile strikes against his bases in Afghanistan in August by tracking an associate's satellite phone.|$|E
5|$|I {{consider}} {{him to be}} {{one of my best friends}} but the real thing is about managers: I think Steinman's manager is the devil and Steinman feels the same way about my manager. So, we had to <b>communicate</b> <b>through</b> managers and he refused to sign some papers that would have allowed for the recording of Bat Out of Hell III without a hitch. So, really, I didn't sue Jim Steinman. I sued his manager.|$|E
5|$|Graham {{travels to}} the first crime scene in Birmingham, Alabama, where he is {{contacted}} by Crawford, who tells him of Lounds' tabloid story on the case. Crawford also patches Graham through to Frederick Chilton, Lecktor's warden, who has found a note in Lecktor's personal effects. Reading it, they realize {{it is from the}} Tooth Fairy, expressing admiration for Lecktor—and an interest in Graham. Crawford brings Graham to the FBI Academy at Quantico, where a missing section of the note is analyzed to determine what Lecktor has removed. It is found to be an instruction to <b>communicate</b> <b>through</b> the personals section of the National Tattler, Lounds' newspaper.|$|E

5|$|In {{a parody}} of The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, Homer begins to {{decorate}} the house for Halloween and is reaching for a decoration in a box. Unfortunately, {{there is a real}} Black Widow spider in the box and when Homer grabs what he thinks is a plastic spider, he is bitten by it. The bite leaves Homer paralyzed and unable to speak. When Lisa reads for him, she discovers that he can <b>communicate</b> <b>through</b> farting. The Simpson family is amazed at the result and Lisa helps Homer tell Marge how he feels about her. When he is again bitten by another spider (a radioactive one this time), he gains the ability to shoot spider webs out of his rear end and have the same abilities as Spider-Man, though he is still unable to move or talk.|$|E
5|$|The group bring Tom back {{to their}} camp. Anne Glass (Moon Bloodgood) and Lourdes (Seychelle Gabriel) operate on Tom. While Tom is in surgery, flashbacks appear, filling in the gaps of his 3 month departure. He is {{apparently}} tortured by the alien “Overlords” while on the spaceship. Later, the Overlords wish to speak with him. They <b>communicate</b> <b>through</b> Karen (Jessy Schram), who was once part of the 2nd Mass. It tells Tom about a “Neutral Zone”, in which survivors can live in peace – detained in a camp run by The Overlords. Tom quickly realizes that negotiation with their invaders {{is out of the}} question, and he immediately refuses. He attacks a nearby Skitter and is knocked unconscious in the process.|$|E
5|$|Most {{termites}} are blind, so communication primarily occurs through chemical, {{mechanical and}} pheromonal cues. These {{methods of communication}} are used {{in a variety of}} activities, including foraging, locating reproductives, construction of nests, recognition of nestmates, nuptial flight, locating and fighting enemies, and defending the nests. The most common way of communicating is through antennation. A number of pheromones are known, including contact pheromones (which are transmitted when workers are engaged in trophallaxis or grooming) and alarm, trail and sex pheromones. The alarm pheromone and other defensive chemicals are secreted from the frontal gland. Trail pheromones are secreted from the sternal gland, and sex pheromones derive from two glandular sources: the sternal and tergal glands. When termites go out to look for food, they forage in columns along the ground through vegetation. A trail can be identified by the faecal deposits or runways that are covered by objects. Workers leave pheromones on these trails, which are detected by other nestmates through olfactory receptors. Termites can also <b>communicate</b> <b>through</b> mechanical cues, vibrations, and physical contact. These signals are frequently used for alarm communication or for evaluating a food source.|$|E

5|$|Sam and {{his high}} school crush Mikaela Banes are rescued from Barricade and Frenzy by the Camaro who {{turns out to be}} Autobot scout Bumblebee, but he is mute and has to <b>communicate</b> <b>through</b> his car radio. Previously sending a beacon to his fellow Autobots, Bumblebee takes Sam and Mikaela to meet the new arrivals – Optimus, Jazz, Ironhide, and Ratchet. Optimus {{explains}} the details of their situation, revealing that if Megatron gained the AllSpark he would transform Earth’s machinery into a new army and exterminate mankind. Sam, Mikaela, and the Autobots travel to Sam’s house to retrieve the glasses, but the teenagers are captured by agents of Sector Seven, a top secret government branch, led by Seymour Simmons. The Autobots stop the agents, but they call for backup, who take Sam, Mikaela, and Bumblebee into custody, while Optimus obtains the glasses, and uses them to locate the Allspark.|$|E

Through the productions of European and Indian plays since 1966, Bisaria presented a wide spectrum of contemporary world drama as director and designer.|$|E
25|$|The {{immune system}} and the brain <b>communicate</b> <b>through</b> {{signaling}} pathways. The brain and the immune system are the two major adaptive systems of the body. Two major pathways {{are involved in this}} cross-talk: the Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA axis), and the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), via the sympathetic-adrenal-medullary axis (SAM axis). The activation of SNS during an immune response might be aimed to localize the inflammatory response.|$|E

25|$|Jefferson {{was not an}} {{outstanding}} orator and preferred to <b>communicate</b> <b>through</b> writing or remain silent if possible. Instead of delivering his State of the Union addresses himself, Jefferson wrote the annual messages and sent a representative to read them aloud in Congress. This started a tradition which continued until 1913, when President Woodrow Wilson (1913–1921) chose to deliver his own State of the Union address.|$|E

25|$|The first Absolutely Incredible Kid Day, a call {{to action}} for all adults to <b>communicate</b> <b>through</b> letters their love and {{commitment}} to children, took place in 1997. In 2003 to further its commitment and inclusiveness, Camp Fire USA began translating its curricula to Spanish. As a way to excite and educate children in Pre-K, the Little Stars program, first developed by Camp Fire Green Country, was introduced nationally in 2005. Designated for ages 3–5 Little Stars builds confidence and a sense of belonging in children.|$|E
25|$|As {{noticed in}} A. pallipes {{foraging}} habits, the eusocial wasps also receive visual stimulus that communicates {{to the individual}} to join the larger group. It was observed through bait stations that those stations with wasp models were better dominated by wasps when ant competition was also present. Furthermore, scientists have proved that even without their olfactory senses, {{the mere presence of}} wasp models was enough for recruitment. Thus it is clear that though A. pallipes <b>communicate</b> <b>through</b> the release of trail pheromones, they can also be recruited through simple visual stimuli.|$|E
25|$|After {{arriving}} at Halifax and completing her work up, Collingwood joined Halifax Force in January 1941. She {{worked with them}} until 23 May when she transferred to Newfoundland Escort Force (NEF). Beginning in June she spent {{the next six months}} escorting convoys from St. John's to Iceland. The first NEF convoy to face battle, HX 113, had three corvettes as part of the escort. However none of them had adequate communications equipment as they were only able to <b>communicate</b> <b>through</b> signals and not radio. This led to six losses and the escorts were only able to stop the attacks due to a reinforcement of Royal Navy escorts out of Iceland.|$|E
