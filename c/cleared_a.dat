5|$|Evolving {{methods of}} {{transportation}} and distribution led to declining business and {{the closing of the}} Union Stock Yards in 1971. National Wrecking Company negotiated a contract whereby National Wrecking <b>cleared</b> <b>a</b> 102-acre site and removed some 50 acres of animal pens, auxiliary buildings and the eight story Exchange Building. It took approximately eight months to complete the job and ready the site for the building of an industrial park.|$|E
5|$|In Hamden, Connecticut, the National Guard {{was called}} in to aid in cleanup and keep order, as some looting was {{reported}} in the devastated area. President George H. W.

In Cairo, Egyptian army tanks <b>cleared</b> <b>a</b> highway overpass from which pro-Mubarak protesters had been hurling rocks and Molotov cocktails onto the anti-Mubarak protesters. On the streets below, hundreds of armed soldiers lined up between the two factions, pushing the pro-Mubarak protesters back and blocking the main hotspots {{in front of the}} Egyptian Museum and at other entrances to the square. Violence was reported to have been perpetrated by police.|$|E

5|$|At 14:30 on 6 November, UB-45 was departing Varna, Bulgaria, under escort by the Bulgarian {{torpedo boat}} Strogi that had <b>cleared</b> <b>a</b> path through Russian mines. At what {{was thought to}} be the edge of the minefield, UB-45 swung around Strogis port side {{directly}} into a second minefield that had been laid by Russian forces the night before. A Hertz horn mine exploded between UB-45s control room and engine room with enough force to break the boat in half. UB-45 sank so rapidly that the only survivors were three men on the conning tower and two on deck, all of whom were injured; the other fifteen men on board perished in the attack. One of the survivors died from the severity of his wounds the following day.|$|E
5|$|Before the war, {{the core}} of St. Louis {{leadership}} had shifted from the Creole and Irish families to a new group, dominated by anti-slavery Germans. Among this new class of leaders was Frank P. Blair, Jr., who led an {{effort to create a}} local militia loyal to the Union after Missouri Governor Claiborne Fox Jackson hinted about secession. This local militia allied itself with the Union army forces at Jefferson Barracks under the leadership of Nathaniel Lyon, which on May 10, 1861 <b>cleared</b> <b>a</b> Confederate encampment outside the city in {{what became known as the}} Camp Jackson Affair. While the Confederates were being marched back into town, a group of citizens attacked the Union and militia forces, costing 28 civilian lives.|$|E
5|$|In {{the mid-1970s}} McClory again {{started working on}} a project to bring a Thunderball {{adaptation}} to production and, with the working title Warhead (a.k.a. James Bond of the Secret Service) he brought writer Len Deighton together with Sean Connery {{to work on a}} script. The script ran into difficulties after accusations from Eon Productions that the project had gone beyond copyright restrictions, which confined McClory to a film based on the Thunderball novel only, and once again the project was deferred. Towards the end of the 1970s developments were reported on the project under the name James Bond of the Secret Service, but then producer Jack Schwartzman became involved and <b>cleared</b> <b>a</b> number of the legal issues that still surrounded the project and licensed the rights from McClory.|$|E

5|$|On 29 August 1942, {{during the}} Battle of Isurava, Kingsbury {{was one of}} the few {{survivors}} of a platoon that had been overrun by the Japanese. He immediately volunteered to join a different platoon, which had been ordered to counter-attack. Rushing forward and firing his Bren gun from the hip, he <b>cleared</b> <b>a</b> path through the enemy and inflicted several casualties. Kingsbury was then seen to fall, shot by a Japanese sniper and killed instantly. His actions, which delayed the Japanese long enough for the Australians to fortify their positions, were instrumental in saving his battalion's headquarters and he was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross as a result.|$|E
5|$|Specialised armour {{arriving}} in the first wave included AVREs, mine flails, and armoured bulldozers. Clearing paths off the beach proved difficult, as the tanks got stuck in the mud or were taken out by mines. A lone mine flail tank finally <b>cleared</b> <b>a</b> path from the beach up toward the Mont Fleury Battery and Ver-Sur-Mer. This route {{was used by the}} Green Howards and tanks of the 4th/7th Dragoon Guards, who cleared the remaining resistance at the Mont Fleury Battery. B Company moved on to attack trench positions and machine gun emplacements at Meuvaines Ridge, while C Company moved to the west of Ver-Sur-Mer to help cover the assault on Crépon, where roads led to the important targets of Bayeux and Caen. The 7th Green Howards attacked the gun battery at Ver-Sur-Mer, where they took 50 prisoners. Colour Sergeant-Major Stanley Hollis earned the only Victoria Cross to be bestowed for actions on D-Day. On the way to the Mont Fleury Battery, Hollis came under machine gun fire while investigating a pillbox, so he shot into the entrance with his Sten gun and dropped a grenade through the roof, killing most of the occupants. He <b>cleared</b> <b>a</b> nearby trench of enemy soldiers, whereupon the occupants of a second pillbox surrendered. Later in the day, he saved the lives of three men during an attempt to take out a field artillery installation at a farm near Crépon.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 1970s {{developments}} {{were reported}} on the project under the name James Bond of the Secret Service, but when producer Jack Schwartzman became involved and <b>cleared</b> <b>a</b> number of the legal issues that still surrounded the project he brought on board scriptwriter Lorenzo Semple, Jr. to work on the screenplay. Connery was unhappy with some aspects of the work and asked Tom Mankiewicz, who had rewritten Diamonds Are Forever, to work on the script; however, Mankiewicz declined as he felt he was under a moral obligation to Cubby Broccoli. Connery then hired British television writers Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais to undertake re-writes, although they went uncredited for their efforts because of a restriction by the Writers Guild of America.|$|E

5000|$|The {{game has}} two main modes. In [...] "Action Mode", the coins rise constantly, while in [...] "Strategy Mode", the coins will only rise when the player <b>clears</b> <b>a</b> group. In the full version only, {{there is also}} a [...] "Puzzle Mode", where the player must <b>clear</b> <b>a</b> certain coin arrangement.|$|R
5|$|Upon {{completion}} of each puzzle, the player's performance is compared on a leaderboard {{based on the}} number of instructions placed in their reactors, the number of cycles it took to meet the quota, and the number of reactors required to meet the solution. The player also has an option to upload videos of their solution to YouTube. The player, once having <b>cleared</b> <b>a</b> puzzle, can return to previous puzzles to try to improve their solution by reducing the number of instructions, cycles taken, or reactors used. SpaceChem supports downloadable content created by the developers themselves, and user-submitted puzzles through its ResearchNet service. A later addition included an open-ended sandbox mode where players could simply explore the game's capabilities.|$|E
5|$|After {{moving through}} torrential rain, the {{battalion}} reached Elephant Point at 16:00, and close-quarters fighting then took place, with flame-throwers being used against several Japanese bunkers guarding the battery. About forty Japanese soldiers and gunners were {{killed during the}} assault, and the battalion also sustained several casualties. After the battery had been secured the battalion dug in around Elephant Point and awaited {{the arrival of the}} relief force, which landed at Thaungang at 15:30, with a supply drop following it several minutes later. As it neared the position of the battalion, the surgical team accompanying the relief force was accidentally fired upon by the Gurkhas, causing four members of the team to be wounded. The battalion remained where it was through the night, although high tides submerged a number of trenches and forced the battalion to higher ground. By the dawn of 2 May, after it had <b>cleared</b> <b>a</b> number of nearby bunkers, the battalion was able to watch as minesweepers cleared the Rangoon river for the columns of landing craft following behind them.|$|E

5|$|Chelsea {{replaced}} midfielder Jiří Jarošík with striker Eiður Guðjohnsen at {{the start}} of the second half, and started the second half in the same manner that they finished the first, with Liverpool withholding the pressure on their penalty area. Cole passed the ball over the Liverpool defence to Drogba in the 54th minute, but defender Jamie Carragher was able to get back and clear the ball. The ball was played back into the penalty area and met by Guðjohnsen, whose header was saved by Dudek, the ball fell to Gallas and Dudek again saved the subsequent shot. Midfielder Antonio Núñez replaced Harry Kewell in the 56th minute. Against the run of play, Liverpool had an attack in the 64th minute. A counter-attack results in a Dietmar Hamann shot, but it was saved by Čech. Liverpool made another substitution following the attack as Igor Bišćan replaced an injured Djimi Traoré. Chelsea continued to push forward and were close to a goal in the 71st minute, but Riise <b>cleared</b> <b>a</b> Gallas after the ball was played to him by Makélélé. Both teams made substitutions in the following minutes. Striker Milan Baroš replaced Morientes for Liverpool while Chelsea substituted Gallas for striker Mateja Kežman.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{was mostly}} done by volunteers; the {{building}} of the stadium required 31,000 man-hours in volunteer work and cost NOK 150,000. After the land was <b>cleared,</b> <b>a</b> layer of mixed sand and earth were laid. The pitch, with the dimensions , was sown in mid-1950. The work also included a grandstand, changing rooms, a watering system and kiosks. The stand could accommodate 2,500 spectators, and the stadium had a total permitted capacity of 6,000 people. The inaugural match was played against Sarpsborg on 7 July 1951 in front of 3,500 spectators. A training pitch beside the stadium pitch opened in 1953. The following year, a new steel entrance was built, following in 1955 with a referees' changing room and administrative offices. In 1959, after eight years of planning, construction of an additional terrace started, which opened in 1960.|$|E
5|$|England {{were placed}} in Group B, {{alongside}} India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. In their first contest, against Sri Lanka, they scored 277 runs, aided by a 95-ball century from Claire Taylor, and a half-century by Caroline Atkins. Sri Lanka batted their full allocation of overs, but lost by 100 runs. Laura Marsh took three wickets, {{and three of the}} Sri Lankan batsmen were run out in their chase. Following the match, Jenny Gunn's bowling action was reported to the International Cricket Council (ICC) as being potentially illegal, but she was <b>cleared</b> <b>a</b> few days later. England faced India in their second match, in a contest billed as the battle for top spot in the group. England won the match easily, bowling India out for 169; with Gunn and Holly Colvin each taking three wickets, and unbeaten half-centuries from both Atkins and Claire Taylor. Another large win, over Pakistan, guaranteed England finished as group winners. Marsh took a career-best five wickets to help bowl Pakistan out for just 78 runs, a total which her side reached in less than half of their allowed overs.|$|E

5|$|James Grayman {{competed in}} the Beijing Olympics as Antigua and Barbuda's sole high jumper, where he participated in the second {{qualifying}} heat on August 17 against athletes that included Brazil's Jesse Lima and the Czech Republic's Tomas Janku. Grayman <b>cleared</b> <b>a</b> 2.20meter height on his second attempt, placing behind tenth-place heat finalist Dmytro Dem'yanyuk of the Ukraine, who made the height on his first try, and eleventh-place heat finalist Linus Thörnblad of Sweden, who also made the height on his second attempt, but had fewer overall misses than Grayman. He finished ahead of the three thirteenth-place heat finalists (Italy's Alessandro Talotti, Spain's Javier Bermejo, and Botswana's Kabelo Kgosiemang) and the sixteenth-place heat finalist (Hup Wei Lee of Malaysia) who achieved the same height, but did so in three tries. Overall, Grayman ranked 28th out of 40 competitors and did not advance to finals on August 19.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{military}} service, Evo {{returned to his}} family, who had escaped the agricultural devastation of 1980's El Niño storm cycle by relocating to the Tropics of Cochabamba in the eastern lowlands. Setting up home {{in the town of}} Villa 14 de Septiembre, El Chapare, using a loan from Evo's maternal uncle, the family <b>cleared</b> <b>a</b> plot of land in the forest to grow rice, oranges, grapefruit, papaya, bananas and later on coca. It was here that Morales learned to speak Quechua, the indigenous local language. The arrival of the Morales family was a part of a much wider migration to the region; in 1981 El Chapare's population was 40,000 but by 1988 it had risen to 215,000. Many Bolivians hoped to set up farms where they could earn a living growing coca, which was experiencing a steady rise in price and which could be cultivated up to four times a year; a traditional medicinal and ritual substance in Andean culture, it was also sold abroad as the key ingredient in cocaine. Evo joined the local soccer team, before founding his own team, New Horizon, which proved victorious at the August 2nd Central Tournament. The El Chapare region remained special to Morales for many years to come; during his presidency he often talked of it in speeches and regularly visited.|$|E
5|$|John Calhoun Johnson of Placerville {{surveyed}} and <b>cleared</b> <b>a</b> shorter, lower (and thus less snow-covered) trail {{east from}} that town in 1852, completing the {{work by the}} summer. Rather than following the ridge to the Sierra's crest as the Mormons had, Johnson headed eastward to the South Fork American River, crossing to its north side near the present Pacific Ranger Station in order to follow Peavine Ridge around a rocky stretch of the river. Returning to the river between Kyburz and Strawberry, he then continued alongside it to the crest at Johnson Pass, where a steep slope descended to Lake Tahoe. Within Nevada, his route generally followed the lake to Glenbrook, where it turned inland and crossed the Carson Range over Spooner Summit into the Carson Valley near Carson City. This trail, known as Johnson's Cut-off, generally followed the present US 50, with notable deviations only just east of Placerville (via Carson Road), over Peavine Ridge (roughly following Peavine Ridge Road, some trails, and Wrights Lake Road), just east of Strawberry (via Slippery Ford Road), over {{the crest of the}} Sierra (via Johnson Pass Road and Meyers Road), south of Lake Tahoe (via Pioneer Trail), east of Lake Tahoe (via Genoa Peak Road), and from Spooner Summit into the Carson Valley (via Kings Canyon Road). By 1854, Bartlett's Bridge had been built at the trail's westernmost crossing of the American River, allowing wagons to follow the cutoff; it was soon washed away by a freshet on March 7, 1855, and replaced by Brockliss Bridge, several miles to the east. Due to an improvement of the road through Carson Canyon on the old Carson Route, most travelers ended up turning southeast from Johnson Pass over Luther Pass (present SR 89) to join the older route northeast of Carson Pass rather than following the cutoff along Lake Tahoe.|$|E
