40|$|An {{object type}} characterizes the domain {{space and the}} {{operations}} that can be invoked on an object of that type. In this paper we introduce a new property for concurrent objects, we call coverability, that aims to provide precise guarantees on the consistent evolution of an object. This new property is suitable {{for a variety of}} distributed objects including concurrent file objects that demand operations to manipulate the latest version of the object. We propose two levels of coverability: (i) strong coverability and (ii) weak coverability. Strong coverability requires that only a single operation can modify the latest version of the object, i. e. "covers" the latest version with a new version, imposing a total order on object modifications. Weak coverability relaxes the strong requirements of strong coverability and allows multiple operations to modify the same version of an object, where each modification leads to a different version. Weak coverability preserves consistent evolution of the object, by demanding any subsequent operation to only modify one of the newly introduced versions. Coverability combined with atomic guarantees yield to <b>coverable</b> atomic read/write registers. We also show that strongly <b>coverable</b> atomic registers are equivalent in power to consensus. Thus, we focus on weakly <b>coverable</b> registers, and we demonstrate their importance by showing that they cannot be implemented using similar types of registers, like ranked-registers. Furthermore we show that weakly <b>coverable</b> registers may be used to implement basic (weak) read-modify-write and file objects. Finally, we implement weakly <b>coverable</b> registers by modifying an existing MWMR atomic register implementation...|$|E

40|$|We study Parametric Petri Nets (PPNs), i. e., Petri nets {{for which}} some arc weights can be {{parameter}}s. In that setting, we {{address a problem}} of parameter synthesis, which consists in computing the exact set of values for the parameters such that a given marking is <b>coverable</b> in the instantiated net. Since the emptiness of that solution set is already undecidable for general PPNs, we address a special case where parameters are used only as input weights (preT-PPNs), and consequently for which the solution set is downward-closed. To this end, we invoke a result for the representation of upward closed set from Valk and Jantzen. To use this procedure, we show we need to decide universal coverability, that is decide if some marking is <b>coverable</b> for every possible values of the parameters. We therefore provide a proof of its EXPSPACE-completeness, thus settling the previously open problem of its decidability. We also propose an adaptation of this reasoning {{to the case of}} parameters used only as output weights (postT-PPNs). In this case, the condition to use this procedure can be reduced to the decidability of the existential coverability, that is decide if there exists values of the parameters making a given marking <b>coverable.</b> This problem is known decidable but we provide here a cleaner proof, providing its EXPSPACE-completeness, by reduction to Omega Petri Nets...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} multi-threaded {{programs with}} an unbounded {{number of threads}} executing a finite-state, non-recursive procedure. Safety properties of such programs can be checked via reduction to the coverability problem for well-structured transition systems (WSTS). In this paper, we present a novel, sound and complete yet empirically much improved solution to this problem. The key idea to achieve a compact search structure is to track uncoverability only for min-imal uncoverable elements, even if these elements {{are not part of}} the original cov-erability query. To this end, our algorithm examines elements in the downward closure of elements backward-reachable from the initial queries. A downside is that the algorithm may unnecessarily explore elements that turn out <b>coverable</b> and thus fail to contribute to the proof minimization. We counter this effect using a forward search engine that simultaneously generates (a subset of all) <b>coverable</b> elements, e. g. a generalized Karp-Miller procedure. We demonstrate in extensive experiments on C programs that our approach targeting minimal uncoverability proofs outperforms existing techniques by orders of magnitude. ...|$|E

In this paper we introduce covers for uniform spaces by expanding the concept of generalized paths of Krasinkiewicz and Minc [20]. One way to do it is by embedding X in a space with good local properties and this is done in Section 6. Another way is by a systematic use of Rips complexes. In the topological category one uses paths in X originating from a base point to construct the universal covering. We use paths in Rips complexes and their homotopy classes possess a natural uniform structure.

40|$|AbstractWe {{introduce}} {{the notion of}} a T-path within Petri nets, and propose to adopt the model of directed hypergraphs in order to determine properties of nets; in particular, we study the relationships between T-paths and firable sequences of transitions. Let us consider a Petri net P=〈P,T,A,M 0 〉 and the set of places with a positive marking in M 0, i. e., P 0 ={p∣M 0 (p) > 0 }. If we regard the net as a directed graph, the existence of a simple path from any place in P 0 to a transition t is, of course, a necessary condition for the potential firability of t. This is sufficient only if the net is a state machine, where |•t|=|t•|= 1 for all t∈T. In this paper we show that the existence of a T-path from any subset of P 0 to a transition t is a more restrictive condition and is, again, a necessary condition for the potential firability of t. But, in this case: (a) if P is a conflict-free Petri net, this is also a sufficient condition, (b) if P is a general Petri net, t is potentially firable by increasing the number of tokens in P 0. For conflict-free nets (CFPN) we consider the following problems: (a) determining the set of firable transitions, (b) determining the set of <b>coverable</b> places, (c) determining the set of live transitions, (d) deciding the boundedness of the net. For all these problems we provide algorithms requiring linear space and time, i. e., O(|P|+|T|+|A|), for a net P=〈P,T,A,M 0 〉. Previous results for this class of networks are given by Howell et al. (1987) [20], providing algorithms for solving problems in conflict-free nets in O(|P|×|T|) time and space. Given a Petri net and a marking M, the well-known coverability problem consists in finding a reachable marking M′ such that M′≥M; this problem is known to be EXPSPACE hard (Rackoff (1978) [33]). For general Petri nets we provide a partial answer to this problem. M is <b>coverable</b> by augmentation if it is <b>coverable</b> from an augmented marking M 0 ′ of the initial marking M 0 : M 0 ′≥M 0 and, for all p∈P, M 0 ′(p) = 0 if M 0 (p) = 0. We solve this problem in linear time. The algorithms for computing T-paths are incremental: it is possible to modify the network (adding new places, transitions, arcs, tokens), and update the set of potentially firable transitions and <b>coverable</b> places without recomputing them from scratch. This feature is meaningful when used during the interactive design of a system...|$|E
