50|$|While {{the term}} SROI exists in Cost-benefit analysis, a {{methodology}} for calculating social {{return on investment}} {{in the context of}} social enterprise was first documented in 2000 by REDF (formerly the Roberts Enterprise Development Fund), a San Francisco-based philanthropic fund that makes long-term grants to organizations that run businesses for social benefit. Since then the approach has evolved to take into account developments in <b>corporate</b> <b>sustainability</b> <b>reporting</b> as well as development in the field of accounting for social and environmental impact. Interest has been fuelled by the increasing recognition of the importance of metrics to manage impacts that are not included in traditional profit and loss accounts, and the need for these metrics to focus on outcomes over outputs. While SROI builds upon the logic of cost-benefit analysis, it is different in that it is explicitly designed to inform the practical decision-making of enterprise managers and investors focused on optimizing their social and environmental impacts. By contrast, cost-benefit analysis is a technique rooted in social science that is most often used by funders outside an organization to determine whether their investment or grant is economically efficient, although economic efficiency also encompasses social and environmental considerations.|$|E
40|$|Purpose of the article: Interest in {{voluntary}} {{environmental and}} social instruments and their communication towards company stakeholders {{has given rise to}} the <b>Corporate</b> <b>Sustainability</b> <b>Reporting.</b> <b>Corporate</b> <b>Sustainability</b> <b>Reporting</b> is a part of a trend incorporating sustainability into companies â€™ management. Methodology/methods: Research methods are adjusted to articleâ€™s aims. To map the situation in the Czech Republic available documents on <b>Corporate</b> <b>Sustainability</b> <b>Reporting</b> were analysed. In order to determine the causes leading to the fact that Czech companies publish Corporate Sustainability Report in a very small scale a case study as a research method is chosen. The research was conducted in three companies. To ensure triangulation, three data collection methods were chosen: interview, questionnaire and archival data (corporate documents). Scientific aim: The aim {{of this paper is to}} map out reporting on sustainable development in the Czech Republic and to find out why Czech companies do not publish Corporate Sustainability Reports more. Findings and conclusions: It was found out that only a very small percentage of companies in the Czech Republic issue a report on sustainable development. The causes of low interest in <b>Corporate</b> <b>Sustainability</b> <b>Reporting</b> are its ignorance, personal and financial demands without short-term returns and the fact that companies do not perceive the potential benefits that <b>Corporate</b> <b>Sustainability</b> <b>Reporting</b> may bring. These benefits are: it can improve negotiations with state and local authorities and other subjects, it can increase positive employee relationship to their company, it can also increase attractiveness to potential investors and international cooperation and thereby achieve significant long-term economic effects and sustainability...|$|E

The results of the survey show the growing trend towards sustainability reporting in Canada.

40|$|The {{topic of}} <b>corporate</b> <b>sustainability</b> <b>reporting</b> has seen {{rapid growth in}} the past couple of years as more firms are placing a greater {{emphasis}} on becoming sustainable. However, the true impact of sustainability reporting on firm value has been widely debated, often due to the nature of the qualitative data in sustainability reports. This thesis uses a normalized sustainability scoring system to examine the effects of sustainability reporting on firm value. In particular, this paper analyzes these effects during the Great Recession to note if there was any change in the effects on a year-by-year basis due to macroeconomic differences. This study finds that not only is superior <b>corporate</b> <b>sustainability</b> <b>reporting</b> positively correlated with increased firm value, but also that the degree of the impact greatly drops during the recession. These findings suggest that sustainability could be an advantageous business tool during stable economic times but not nearly as important in terms of increasing firm value during times of recession. Therefore, the results of this thesis have important practical uses and serve as a basis for analyzing the financial effects of corporate sustainability initiatives as this type of reporting becomes more prevalent in the future...|$|E
