25|$|Dryer {{was traded}} to the New England Patriots in February 1972 for three draft choices (a first, second, and sixth), but refused to report to the Patriots and left New England with only one option thus dealing him to the Los Angeles Rams on draft day of that year for a first round draft pick and backup {{defensive}} end Rick Cash. In his first year with the Rams he backed up left defensive end Jack Youngblood making only four starts but playing in every game despite a broken hand and broken nose. His primary role in 1972 was to <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> likely passing downs and rush the passer. He had 40 tackles (17 solo) and 4½ sacks.|$|E
25|$|Brig. Gen. Joseph Hooker's 2nd Division of the III Corps was {{the lead}} {{infantry}} in the Union Army advance. They assaulted Fort Magruder and a line of rifle pits and smaller fortifications that extended in an arc southwest from the fort, but were repulsed. Confederate counterattacks, directed by Maj. Gen. James Longstreet, threatened to overwhelm Hooker's division, which had contested the ground alone since the early morning {{while waiting for the}} main body of the army to arrive. Hooker had expected Baldy Smith's division of the IV Corps, marching north on the Yorktown Road, to hear the sound of battle and <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> Hooker's right in support. However, Smith had been halted by Sumner more than a mile away from Hooker's position. He had been concerned that the Confederates would leave their fortifications and attack him on the Yorktown Road.|$|E
25|$|A catcher {{nearly always}} throws {{with his right}} hand. Since most hitters are {{right-handed}} and stand {{to the left side}} of the plate when batting, a catcher who throws left-handed is forced to take some time to sidestep (or otherwise avoid) the right-handed hitter when he throws from behind the plate. In addition, a lefty's throw would tend to <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> the shortstop side of the bag, while a righty's throw would be on the second base side of the bag, which is where the runner is coming in. Consequently, players who are left-handed rarely play catcher. Left-handed catchers have only caught eleven big-league games since 1902, and Jack Clements, who played for 17 years at the end of the nineteenth century, is the only man in the history of baseball to play more than three hundred games as a left-handed catcher. However, some observers, including the famed statistician Bill James and ESPN writer Rob Neyer, have suggested that the real reason that there are no left-handed catchers is because left-handed players with strong throwing arms are almost always encouraged, at an early age, to become pitchers. Benny Distefano, the last lefty thrower to catch a big-league game (in 1989), noted that lefty catchers have difficulty on bunts up the third base line and on fielding throws home for plays at the plate.|$|E

500|$|On 28 April at 18:06, three A-37 Dragonflies piloted {{by former}} VNAF pilots, who had {{defected}} to the Vietnamese People's Air Force at {{the fall of}} Danang, dropped six Mk81 250lb bombs on Tan Son Nhut Air Base destroying several aircraft. VNAF F-5s took off in pursuit, but {{they were unable to}} intercept the A-37s. C-130s leaving Tan Son Nhut reported receiving North Vietnamese Army (PAVN) [...]51 cal and 37mm anti-aircraft (AAA) fire, while sporadic PAVN rocket and artillery attacks also started to hit the airport and air base. C-130 flights were stopped temporarily after the air attack but resumed at 20:00 on 28 April. At 21:00 on 28 April Major General Homer D.

Then how I saw how the European Union was developing, it was very obvious that what they had in mind was not democratic. ...

500|$|The album's {{credits include}} Clare Torry, a session singer and songwriter, {{and a regular}} at Abbey Road. [...] She had worked on pop {{material}} and numerous cover albums, and after hearing one of those albums Parsons invited her to the studio to sing on Wright's composition [...] "The Great Gig in the Sky". [...] She declined this invitation as she wanted to watch Chuck Berry perform at the Hammersmith Odeon, but arranged to <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> the following Sunday. [...] The band explained the concept behind the album, but were unable to tell her exactly what she should do. [...] Gilmour {{was in charge of}} the session, and in a few short takes on a Sunday night Torry improvised a wordless melody to accompany Wright's emotive piano solo. She was initially embarrassed by her exuberance in the recording booth, and wanted to apologise to the band – only to find them delighted with her performance. [...] Her takes were then selectively edited to produce the version used on the track. [...] For her contribution she was paid £30, equivalent to about £ in , but in 2004 she sued EMI and Pink Floyd for songwriting royalties, arguing that her contribution to [...] "The Great Gig in the Sky" [...] was substantial enough to be considered co-authorship. [...] The High Court agreed with her, but the terms of the settlement were not disclosed. [...] All post-2005 pressings therefore credit Wright and Torry jointly for the song.|$|E
500|$|Stevenson {{considered}} housing, uniforms, and recruit {{training to}} be her first priorities after taking up her appointment. On arriving at No.1 WAAAF Depot in Malvern, Victoria, she was [...] "shattered at the prison-like atmosphere of the place". She drew on her retail experience to organise the WAAAF and to design its uniform. Stevenson was promoted to wing officer on 1 October 1941, and group officer on 1 April 1942, {{which was to be}} the highest rank attained by a serving WAAAF member. She took an active interest in recruitment, her liberal social outlook evinced by her determination that single women with children should not be barred from entry to the WAAAF. To establish high standards, Stevenson personally interviewed all WAAAF officer trainees and briefed as many of them as possible before they were posted to a new job. She was quoted in the Adelaide Advertiser as saying, [...] "When interviewing applicants, I always point out the hardships of the service, so that no one will <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> a rush of enthusiasm and regret it later." [...] Stevenson also worked to maintain the morale of personnel, encouraging officers to attend group leadership courses and organise leisure and sporting activities for their staff. Colonel Sybil Irving, the head of the Australian Women's Army Service (AWAS), who observed first hand the WAAAF's training methods before large-scale AWAS recruitment commenced, later declared that Stevenson [...] "did the most pertinent pioneering work" [...] in gaining acceptance for women in the armed forces. For her part, Stevenson considered the role of Director [...] "a difficult job and often a lonely one".|$|E

I could <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> the punt-block team and stand behind the line and wave my arms, or something." [...] But on his first drive, Grogan could only lead them to the 37-yard line, and they decided to punt rather than risk a 55-yard field goal attempt. The Bears then marched 72 yards in 11 plays, moving the ball inside the Patriots' 10-yard line. New England kept them out of the end zone, but Butler kicked his third field goal on the last play of the half to give Chicago a 23–3 halftime lead.|$|E

You whack in at your bomber. It {{was never meant to}} be a dogfighter, {{it was meant to be}} a destroyer of bombers... The great problem with it was it did not have dive brakes. For example, if you want to fight and destroy a B-17, you <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> a dive. The 30mm cannon were not so accurate beyond 600 metres. So you normally came in at 600 yards and would open fire on your B-17. And your closing speed was still high and since you had to break away at 200 meters to avoid a collision, you only had two seconds firing time. Now, in two seconds, you can't sight. You can fire randomly and hope for the best. If you want to sight and fire, you need to double that time to four seconds. And with dive brakes, you could have done that." ...|$|E
