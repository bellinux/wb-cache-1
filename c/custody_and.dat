5|$|In {{a divorce}} or child custody case between {{unmarried}} parents, a judge {{will address the}} joint legal custody rights of the parents. In a custody order, it's common for one parent to have physical <b>custody</b> <b>and</b> the other parent {{to have some sort}} of visitation rights, but legal custody is awarded separately. Thus, even when one parent is the primary custodian, joint legal custody may be awarded either to both of the parents or to only one of the parents, depending on state law and the facts of the case.|$|E

For the moment, it appeared that Nikephoros' plan had worked. However, Sviatoslav's brief sojourn into the south awakened in him the desire to conquer these fertile and rich lands. In this intention he was apparently encouraged by the former Byzantine envoy, Kalokyros, who coveted the imperial crown for himself. Thus, after defeating the Pechenegs, he set up viceroys to rule Russia in his absence and turned his sights southward again.|$|E

5|$|A congratulatory {{telegram}} to Kruger from Kaiser Wilhelm II on 3 January {{prompted a}} storm of anti-Boer and anti-German feeling in Britain, with Jameson becoming lionised as a result. Kruger shouted down talk {{of the death penalty}} for the imprisoned Jameson or a campaign of retribution against Johannesburg, challenging his more bellicose commandants to depose him if they disagreed, and accepted Robinson's proposed mediation with alacrity. After confiscating the weapons and munitions the Reform Committee had stockpiled, Kruger handed Jameson and his troops over to British <b>custody</b> <b>and</b> granted amnesty to all the Johannesburg conspirators except for 64 leading members, who were charged with high treason. The four main leaders—Lionel Phillips, John Hays Hammond, George Farrar and Frank Rhodes (brother of Cecil)—pleaded guilty in April 1896 and were sentenced to hang, but Kruger quickly had this commuted to fines of £25,000 each.|$|E
