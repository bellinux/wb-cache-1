Permanent and portable water flow meters were installed on the plant’s plumbing system to collect water flow data from March 2014 to March 2015. A local utility company was hired to meter electricity at antimicrobial interventions using portable data loggers. Metered water flows and temperatures were combined with fundamental thermodynamics principles to estimate natural gas use.

In 1963, he became the first veterinarian to serve on the Ohio State Racing Commission. While on the commission, he helped crack down on prohibited use of stimulants and depressants in race horses by establishing Ohio's race testing laboratory. In 1967, as founder and president of Ohio Feed Lot in South Charleston, Ohio, he focused on environmental cattle feeding operation. In conjunction with Searle Agriculture, Inc., he helped design and operate the first 150,000-ton capacity <b>cattle</b> waste fermenter <b>for</b> <b>processing</b> animal waste.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this experiment was {{to test the hypothesis}} that cleaning cattle hides by removing hair and extraneous matter before hide removal would result in improved microbiological quality of carcasses in commercial beef processing plants. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of chemical dehairing of cattle hides on the prevalence of Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 and the levels of aerobic bacteria and Enterobacteriaceaeon carcasses. Samples from 240 control (conventionally processed) and 240 treated (chemically dehaired before hide removal) hides (immediately after stunning but before treatment) and preevisceration carcasses (immediately after hide removal) were obtained from four visits to a commercial beef processing plant. Total aerobic plate counts (APC) and Enterobacteriaceae counts (EBC) were not (P. 0. 05) different between <b>cattle</b> designated <b>for</b> chemical dehairing (8. 1 and 5. 9 log CFU/ 100 cm 2 for APC and EBC, respectively) and <b>cattle</b> designated <b>for</b> conventional <b>processing</b> (8. 0 and 5. 7 log CFU/ 100 cm 2 for APC and EBC, respectively). However, E. coli O 157 :H 7 hide prevalence was higher (P, 0. 05) for the control group than for the treated group (67 % versus 88 %). In contrast to hides, the bacterial levels were lower (P, 0. 05) on the treated (3. 5 and 1. 4 log CFU/ 100 cm 2 for APC and EBC) than the control (5. 5 and 3. 2 log CFU/ 100 cm 2 for APC and EBC) preevisceration carcasses. Prevalence of E. coli O 157 :H 7 was lower (P. 0. 05) on treated than on control preevisceration carcasses (1 % versus 50 %). These data indicate that chemical dehairing of cattle hides is an effective intervention to reduce the incidence of hide-to-carcass contamination with pathogens. The data als...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the time period that Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 survives on the hides of cattle. Extensive research has been conducted and is ongoing to identify and develop novel preharvest intervention strategies to reduce the presence of E. coli O 157 :H 7 on live cattle and subsequent transfer to processed carcasses. If a reduction of E. coli O 157 :H 7 levels in feces can be achieved through preharvest intervention, it is not known how long it would take for such reductions to be seen on the hide. In the study presented herein, three trials were conducted to follow E. coli O 157 :H 7 hide prevalence over time. For each trial, 36 animals were housed in individual stanchions to minimize or prevent hide contamination events. Through prevalence determination and isolate genotyping with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, survival of E. coli O 157 :H 7 on the hides of live cattle was determined to be short lived, with an approximate duration of 9 days or less. The results of this study suggest that any preharvest interventions that are to be administered at the end of the finishing period will achieve maximum effect in reducing E. coli O 157 :H 7 levels on cattle hides if given 9 days before the <b>cattle</b> are presented <b>for</b> <b>processing.</b> However, it should be noted that interventions reducing pathogen shedding would also contribute to decreasing hide contamination through lowering the contamination load of the processing plant lairage environment, regardless of the time of application...|$|R
