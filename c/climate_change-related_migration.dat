40|$|Climate {{change may}} be a {{relatively}} new phenomenon, but its effects are being felt throughout the world and having {{a significant impact on}} peoples’ lives in many countries. Some of those most keenly feeling the effects live in areas that are particularly vulnerable to destabilizing factors acting in conjunction with existing challenges. The effects of climate change are an exacerbating factor in sometimes already difficult lives. In some areas, the effects of climate change are or may become such that the inhabitants contemplate migration to find a more viable life elsewhere, either in their own country or in another country. It is by no means guaranteed that the effects of climate change will inexorably lead people, such as those in low-lying small island states, to migrate outside their country, particularly if there are adequate measures taken to mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate change. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that the potential for <b>climate</b> <b>change-related</b> <b>migration</b> is drawing near, if it has not already arrived, as a factor for some people’s decisions to migrate internally or externally. Some work currently underway considers approaches to dealing with <b>climate</b> <b>change-related</b> <b>migration</b> and the possible related issues around human rights protections and practical management. Climate change is an amorphous, complex and politically challenging issue for governments and stakeholders to deal with. Its effects on peoples’ lives can be significant, especially in conjunction with existing development, environmental, and economic challenges. It is important to ensure that any approach created is necessary, in light of existing mechanisms and available resources, and that it does not disadvantage any other groups of people through its creation or functioning. This thesis considers the state of the international approach to the potential problem of <b>climate</b> <b>change-related</b> <b>migration.</b> One recently developed approach was a proposed Climate Change Displaced Persons Convention, which has been formulated by Hodgkinson, Burton, Anderson and Young (2010). A range of information was considered to try and find a balance between the attempt to deal with climate change as a public and foreign policy issue and the human reactions and subsequent choices people make in dealing with the effects of climate change. Due to the complications of holding a position as a public servant working in the field of responses to climate change, I decided to use a methodology that would enable me to remain a step removed from the process, to avoid influencing responses. The thesis reviews current literature and experiences on climate change and migration, particularly in the Pacific, identifies key issues, and assesses the potential effectiveness of the Convention in addressing the issues identified. Information sources included drawing on reports of first hand experience of climate change related migration and those living in the front line on the islands, experiences of working in the public and NGO sectors, and academic considerations of how to address climate change and migration...|$|E
40|$|Surging {{interest}} within {{academic and}} policy communities {{has given rise}} to an abundance of literature on the subject of <b>climate</b> <b>change-related</b> <b>migration,</b> which has in turn generated a wide range of views on the anticipated scale and scope of this phenomenon. As a result, diverging conceptualizations of this policy problem have led to markedly different recommendations on how governments, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) and International Organizations (IOs) should address this issue. In recent years, these views have begun to solidify into distinct policy discourses. This paper aims to identify and explore different policy discourses within current policy debates on the issue of <b>climate</b> <b>change-related</b> <b>migration</b> in Bangladesh by examining a collection of policy texts produced by a broad cross-section of NGOs, IOs and Think Tanks. The first chapter examines the relationship between climate change and migration in Bangladesh by presenting a broad overview of how these impacts are expected to affect the lives and livelihoods of Bangladeshis over the coming century. Specifically, this section examines sea level rise, increasing glacial melt in the Himalayas, changing weather patterns, and increasingly frequent and severe extreme weather events. The second chapter identifies and extrapolates key characteristics of the security and adaptation discourses that emerge from the literature examined by focusing on how five distinct themes – climatic drivers of migration; human security; state security; agency and identity; and policy and governance – are viewed within these discursive frameworks. Finally, the third chapter seeks to explain the discursive positions adopted by the organizations authoring these texts by examining, in broad strokes, the unique characteristics of these groups, and the geo-political environments within which they operate. Furthermore, this chapter will also look at the influence of two pre-existing discursive frameworks – illegal migration and climate justice – on the security and adaptation discourses, respectively. As the impacts of climate change are expected to become increasingly severe {{over the course of the}} twenty-first century, identifying and extrapolating the discursive frameworks that are being employed to highlight or marginalize specific policy outcomes will be increasingly important. By examining two key discourses emerging within current policy literature on the subject of climate change and migration, this analysis aims to shed new light on an emerging issue-area in climate change policy...|$|E
40|$|Migration {{is one of}} {{a variety}} of ways by which human populations adapt to {{environmental}} changes. The study of migration in the context of anthropogenic climate change is often approached using the concept of vulnerability and its key functional elements: exposure, system sensitivity and adaptive capacity. This article explores the interaction of climate change and vulnerability through review of case studies of dry-season migration in the West African Sahel, hurricane-related population displacements in the Caribbean basin, winter migration of ‘snowbirds ’ to the US Sun-belt, and 1930 s drought migration on the North American Great Plains. In doing so, general causal, temporal and spatial dimensions of climate migration are identified, followed by a discussion of the potential global scale of future <b>climate</b> <b>change-related</b> <b>migration</b> and implications for gender equity and human security. With the rise of scientific evidence of anthropogenic climate change, increasingly detailed scientific inquiries have been made into future climatic influences on global migration patterns [1 - 8]. Environmental changes, of which climate change represents one example, have long been recognized as having the potential to influence human migration and settlement patterns. Th...|$|E

40|$|It is {{expected}} that by the mid-late century, {{large numbers of people}} facing increased environmental, economic and other pressures associated with climate change will respond by leaving their homes and communities to relocate elsewhere. Low-lying island states in the South Pacific such as Tuvalu and Kiribati are commonly cited as nations expected to be in the vanguard of a wave of climate-related migration. With existing strong cultural and economic ties with other South Pacific nations, it would be natural to expect New Zealand’s support role to flow into proactive planning, and legal and policy provision for responding to the effects of climate change in the Pacific. To an extent, this expectation has been met, however New Zealand’s position on the more contentious aspect of climate change adaptation within the Pacific: whether, and to what extent, New Zealand would be willing to open its borders to climate change-displaced persons in the region less clear. It is concluded that to date, despite rhetorical support for its Pacific neighbours, the New Zealand government has not actively engaged with legal, policy or practical implications of likely significant future flows of <b>climate</b> <b>change-related</b> <b>migration</b> to its shores...|$|E
40|$|Amid rising global {{temperatures}} and a changing physical environment, climate change {{has led to}} the development of a new social group called “Climate Migrants or Climate Refugees. ” In 1995 approximately 25 million people worldwide were considered to be environment or climate refugees; it is anticipated that this number will increase to 200 million by 2050. Over the last decade rising sea levels, tropical cyclones, flash floods, soil salinity, and river erosion have emerged as the environmental or climatic push factors that have forced highly exposed and vulnerable coastal communities to migrate. In most cases people abandoned their settlements in rural and coastal areas and moved to towns and cities. Such push factors lead to chaotic and overwhelming levels of urbanization with attendant congestion, poor housing, and pollution choking urban areas. Planning systems in developing countries like Bangladesh have found it difficult to accommodate <b>climate</b> <b>change-related</b> <b>migration</b> and uncontrolled urbanization. Climate change is a major challenge for most coastal countries and this issue has to be addressed at various levels of planning including national, regional, and urban contexts. Consequently planning policy and practice need to evolve a vertically integrated decision-making framework linking national, regional, and local planning to address climate migration.

40|$|This {{research}} {{is comprised of}} three interrelated stages of a broader study of the <b>climate</b> <b>change-related</b> corporate governance disclosure practices of Australian companies. The first stage of the study investigates the <b>climate</b> <b>change-related</b> corporate governance disclosure practices of five major Australian energy-intensive companies over a 16 -year period (from 1992 to 2007). The five companies are BHP Billiton, Caltex, Origin Energy, Rio Tinto and Santos Limited. A content analysis research method was adopted to investigate disclosures within annual reports and standalone social and environmental (or sustainability) reports. In doing so, a disclosure index has been developed, consisting of 25 specific <b>climate</b> <b>change-related</b> corporate governance issues under eight general categories, to classify <b>climate</b> <b>change-related</b> governance disclosures provided by the respective companies. The result of this stage shows that although there was an increasing disclosure trend over the years, there was minimal reporting by major Australian companies in relation to <b>climate</b> <b>change-related</b> corporate governance practices. Whilst {{the first stage of}} the study focuses on what information companies are disclosing, the second stage investigates what different groups of stakeholders believe companies should disclose. Using an online survey tool called survey-monkey, this stage asked a group of stakeholders (users of information with expertise in relation to what information should be disclosed) including institutional investors, government bodies, environmental NGOs, environmental consultancies, researchers and accounting professionals, to rank the 25 specific <b>climate</b> <b>change-related</b> corporate governance disclosure issues developed in stage one of the study. All 25 issues received mean scores between 3. 5 and 4. 5 showing that the respondents unanimously considered the issues in the index to be at least ‘important’ in assessing organisations’ <b>climate</b> <b>change-related</b> corporate governance practices. Stage two also found six additional issues recommended by the respondents that led to the development a final index of 31 issues under eight general categories. Thus the second stage of the study effectively utilised the disclosure index developed in stage one to build a ‘best practice disclosure index’ by using experts’ opinions. Taken together, the results of the previous two stages indicate that Australian companies’ <b>climate</b> <b>change-related</b> corporate governance disclosure practices fall well short of the best practice disclosures recommended by the sample of expert users. Therefore the aim of the third and final stage of the study is to explain the reasons for the low level of <b>climate</b> <b>change-related</b> corporate governance disclosures by Australian companies. By interviewing senior executives of the sample companies identified in stage one, stage three finds the following issues appear to contribute to the apparent lack of disclosure: the existence of an expectations gap; the costs of providing information outweigh perceived benefits; the cost of providing commercially sensitive information; the limited accountability held by the companies; and a lack of demand for information from powerful stakeholder groups, either singly or in combination. The three research stages together provide us with a comprehensive, but not exhaustive, picture to understand the current disclosure practices of Australian companies in relation to <b>climate</b> <b>change-related</b> corporate governance practices...|$|R

While existing scholarship investigates stakeholder pressures on companies to discharge their broader accountability through general {{social and environmental}} disclosures, {{there is a lack}} of research investigating whether and how stakeholder pressures emerge to influence accountability and disclosure practices related to climate change. We surveyed various stakeholder groups to understand their concerns about <b>climate</b> <b>change-related</b> corporate accountability and disclosure practices. We present three primary findings: first, while NGOs and the media have some influence, institutional investors and government bodies (regulators) are perceived to be the most powerful stakeholders in generating <b>climate</b> <b>change-related</b> concern and coercive pressure on corporations to be accountable. Second, corporate <b>climate</b> <b>change-related</b> disclosures, as documented through the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), are positively associated with such perceived coercive pressures. Lastly, we find a positive correlation between the level of media attention to climate change and Australian corporate responses to the CDP. Our results indicate that corporations will not disclose climate change information until pressured by non-financial stakeholders. This suggests a larger role for non-financial actors than previously theorized, with several policy implications...|$|R
50|$|The Climate Disclosure Standards Board (CDSB) is a {{non-profit}} organization working to provide material information for investors and financial markets through the integration of <b>climate</b> <b>change-related</b> information into mainstream financial reporting.

To this end, CDSB acts as a forum for collaboration on how existing standards and practices can be used to link financial and <b>climate</b> <b>change-related</b> information using its Climate Change Reporting Framework. The Framework is a standards-ready tool for companies to disclose <b>climate</b> <b>change-related</b> information in mainstream financial reports. Launched in September 2010, the Climate Change Reporting Framework adopts and relies on relevant provisions of existing standards and practices, including the Greenhouse Gas Protocol and International Financial Reporting Standards as well as reflecting regulatory and voluntary reporting and carbon trading rules. The distinctiveness of the Framework is that it references standards instead of creating a new one.

40|$|Worldwide, {{climate change}} {{is one of the}} main factors {{exacerbating}} the effects of hazards or generating additional risk. Investigation is required to understand <b>climate</b> <b>change-related</b> risks for all components of human systems, including cultural heritage. Accordingly, this paper aims to present a new risk assessment index for cultural heritage, referred to as the Cultural Heritage Risk Index (CHRI). The paper applies a desk-based review of the existing literature on <b>climate</b> <b>change-related</b> risks for cultural heritage and of multi-level policy and planning documents of cultural heritage management in Australia. The paper then presents the CHRI and describes its attributes based upon the formalisation of risk as a function of hazard, exposure and vulnerability. CHRI is applied to a unique asset of cultural heritage in Newcastle (Australia), the Burwood Beach Wastewater Treatment Works (BBWTW). The paper shows that this asset has a moderate risk related to climate change, and that some interventions can be applied to decrease its vulnerability. The use of a new index such as CHRI allows creating a baseline for the exploration of the relations between <b>climate</b> <b>change-related</b> risks and cultural heritage. It can be an effective part of tools assessing <b>climate</b> <b>change-related</b> risk on cultural heritage in Australia and might aid in prioritising specific interventions...|$|R

Within the application of Environmental Health Impact Assessment (EHIA), there have been few attempts to incorporate <b>climate</b> <b>change-related</b> health risks as an input to the framework. This study used a focus group design to examine the perceptions of government, industry and academic specialists about the suitability of assessing the health consequences of climate change within an EHIA framework. Practitioners expressed concern over a number of factors relating to the current EHIA methodology and the inclusion of <b>climate</b> <b>change-related</b> health risks. These concerns related to the broad scope of issues that would need to be considered, problems with identifying appropriate health indicators, the lack of relevant qualitative information that is currently incorporated in assessment and persistent issues surrounding stakeholder participation. It was suggested that improvements are needed in data collection processes, particularly in terms of adequate communication between environmental and health practitioners. Concerns were raised surrounding data privacy and usage, and how these could impact on the assessment process.

40|$|Based on {{a variant}} of the Elliott-Ackerman-Millian theory that variable, {{potentially}} inconsistent and costly litigation outcomes induce industry to seek federal preemptive legislation to reign in such costs, we collect data on <b>climate</b> <b>change-related</b> litigation to determine whether litigation might motivate major greenhouse gas emitters to accept a preemptive, though possibly carbon-restricting, legislative compromise. We conduct a spectral cluster analysis on 178 initial federal and state judicial filings to reveal the most relevant groupings among <b>climate</b> <b>change-related</b> suits and their underlying pleading patterns. Besides exposing the general content and structure of <b>climate</b> <b>change-related</b> filings, this study identifies major specific pleading trends, such as the low frequency of tort claim pleading and the high level of segregation of state and federal causes of action. These data also allow investigating how generally applicable litigation doctrines have influenced pleading patterns, even subduing the impact of the two major U. S. Supreme Court rulings in this area. These findings lead us to conclude that this type of litigation has not induced and is not likely to induce major emitters to embrace preemptive emissions legislation as a risk-reducing compromise...|$|R
