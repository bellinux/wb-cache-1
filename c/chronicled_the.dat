5|$|Independence and {{partition}} inspired {{literary and}} other artistic creations. Such creations mostly describe the human cost of partition, limiting the holiday {{to a small}} part of their narrative. Salman Rushdie's novel Midnight's Children (1980), which won the Booker Prize and the Booker of Bookers, wove its narrative around children born at midnight of 14–15 August 1947 with magical abilities. Freedom at Midnight (1975) is a non-fiction work by Larry Collins and Dominique Lapierre that <b>chronicled</b> <b>the</b> events surrounding the first Independence Day celebrations in 1947. Few films centre on the moment of independence, instead highlighting the circumstances of partition and its aftermath. On the Internet, Google has commemorated Independence Day since 2003 with a special doodle on its Indian homepage.|$|E
5|$|Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Matilda Joslyn Gage and Ida Husted Harper {{began in}} 1876 {{to write the}} History of Woman Suffrage. They planned for one volume but {{finished}} four before the death of Anthony in 1906, and two more afterward. The first three volumes <b>chronicled</b> <b>the</b> beginnings of the women's rights movement, including the years that Stone was active. Because of differences between Stone and Stanton that had been highlighted in the schism between NWSA and AWSA, Stone's place in history was marginalized in the work. The text {{was used as the}} standard scholarly resource on 19th-century U.S. feminism for much of the 20th century, causing Stone's extensive contribution to be overlooked in many histories of women's causes.|$|E
5|$|According to the Augustan History, Zenobia's {{descendants}} were Roman nobility {{during the}} reign of Emperor Valens (reigned 364–375). Eutropius and Jerome <b>chronicled</b> <b>the</b> queen's descendants in Rome during the fourth and fifth centuries. They may have been the result of a reported marriage to a Roman spouse or offspring who accompanied her from Palmyra; both theories, however, are tentative. Zonaras is the only historian to note that Zenobia had daughters; he wrote that one married Aurelian, who married the queen's other daughters to distinguished Romans. According to Southern, the emperor's marriage to Zenobia's daughter is a fabrication. Another descent claim is the relation of saint Zenobius of Florence with the queen; the Girolami banking family claimed descent from the fifth century saint, and the alleged relation was first noted in 1286. The family also extended their roots to Zenobia by claiming that the saint was a descendant of her.|$|E
