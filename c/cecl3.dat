40|$|Cerium {{is widely}} used in many aspects of modern society, {{including}} agriculture, industry and medicine. It has been demonstrated to enter the ecological environment, is then transferred to humans through food chains, and causes toxic actions in several organs including the brain of animals. However, the neurotoxic molecular mechanisms are not clearly understood. In this study, mice were exposed to 0. 5, 1, and 2 mg/kg BW cerium chloride (<b>CeCl(3))</b> for 90 consecutive days, and their learning and memory ability as well as hippocampal gene expression profile were investigated. Our findings suggested that exposure to <b>CeCl(3)</b> led to hippocampal lesions, apoptosis, oxidative stress and impairment of spatial recognition memory. Furthermore, microarray data showed marked alterations in the expression of 154 genes involved in learning and memory, immunity and inflammation, signal transduction, apoptosis and response to stress in the 2 mg/kg <b>CeCl(3)</b> exposed hippocampi. Specifically, the significant up-regulation of Axud 1, Cdc 37, and Ube 2 v 1 caused severe apoptosis, and great suppression of Adcy 8, Fos, and Slc 5 a 7 expression led to impairment of mouse cognitive ability. Therefore, Axud 1, Cdc 37, Ube 2 v 1, Adcy 8, Fos, and Slc 5 a 7 may be potential biomarkers of hippocampal toxicity caused by CeCl 3 exposure...|$|E

40|$|Hydrogen {{peroxide}} (H₂O₂) {{is a major}} reactive {{oxygen species}} (ROS) and plays diverse roles in plant development and stress responses. However, its localization in large and thick plant organs (e. g., stem, roots, and fruits), other than leaves, {{has proven to be}} challenging due to the difficulties for the commonly used H₂O₂-specific chemicals, such as 3, 3 '-diaminobenzidine (DAB), cerium chloride (<b>CeCl₃),</b> and 2 ', 7 '-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (H₂DCF-DA), to penetrate those organs. Theoretically, the reaction of endogenous H₂O₂ with these chemicals could be facilitated by using thin organ sections. However, the rapid production of wound-induced H₂O₂ associated with this procedure inevitably disturbs the original distribution of H₂O₂ in vivo. Here, by employing tomato seedling stems and fruits as testing materials, we report a novel, simple, and rapid protocol to localize H₂O₂ in those organs using DAB-mediated tissue printing. The rapidity of the protocol (within 15 s) completely avoided the interference of wound-induced H₂O₂ during experimentation. Moreover, the H₂O₂ signal on the printing was stable for at least 1 h with no or little background produced. We conclude that DAB-mediated tissue printing developed here provide a new feasible and reliable method to localize H₂O₂ in large plant organs, hence should have broad applications in studying ROS biology...|$|E
40|$|Chlorinated hydrocarbons, such as {{perchloroethylene}} (PCE) and trichloroethylene (TCE), are persistent environmental hazards, due to improper disposal, affecting groundwater sources {{located near}} {{a variety of}} industrial processes. As many chlorinated hydrocarbons are suspected carcinogens, there is great interest in developing inexpensive and environmentally sound technologies for the remediation of contaminated sites. Current efforts focus {{on the use of}} soil-vapor extraction (SVE) to pass gas phase contaminants through a granular activated carbon bed (GAC), which creates solid toxic waste, and possibly more harmful by-products during GAC regeneration. This research focuses on the use of hydrogen and short-chain alkanes, in combination with oxygen, to promote the conversion of PCE over a Pt/Rh three-way catalyst. The use of both of a hydrocarbon and oxygen creates mixed reducing-oxidizing (redox) conditions. Results indicate that redox conditions result in the complete removal of the target compound and produces primarily CO₂, H₂O and HCl. The process has proven to be most effective near stoichiometric conditions with respect to the reducing and oxidizing agents (2 : 1 for H₂:O₂ and 1 : 5 for propane:O₂). Residence times in the reactor are typically on the order of 0. 1 to 0. 5 seconds and catalyst surface temperatures range from 200 °C to 550 °C, with PCE conversion greater than 99 % starting at 450 °C under slightly reducing (H₂:O₂ > 2) conditions. Laboratory results suggest that the catalytic mechanism is a multiple step surface reaction involving the three reactants (H₂/C₃H₈, O₂ and PCE). A mechanism based on Langmuir- Hinshelwood kinetics has been developed in an attempt to model the process. The role of the cerium oxide present in a three-way catalyst on the direct oxidation of perchloroethylene (PCE) has also been explored. Experiments have shown that {{in the absence of an}} external oxidizing agent, PCE can be converted over an alumina supported Pt/Rh catalyst. This work hypothesizes that the chlorine atoms in the adsorbed PCE interact with oxygen in oxidized cerium, CeO₂, reducing the cerium and replacing the oxygen atoms to create <b>CeCl₃.</b> This process begins at a catalyst surface temperature of 300 °C and reaches 100 % conversion at 400 °C...|$|E
