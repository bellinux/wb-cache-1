The new concept is the unexamined logically and functionally to determine its relevance and practicability. In this context, a new structure of the economic cycle (from which the crisis phase is rejected) is proposed and examined.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{business cycle}} synchronization in the European Monetary Union {{with a special}} focus on the core-periphery pattern {{in the aftermath of}} the crisis. Using a quarterly index for business cycle synchronization by Cerqueira (2013), our panel data estimates suggest that it is countries belonging to the core that are faced with increased synchronization among themselves after 2007 Q 4, whereas peripheral countries decreased synchronization with regards to the core, non-EMU countries and among themselves. Correlation coefficients and nonparametric local polynomial regressions corroborate these findings.

40|$|This paper first reviews {{a number}} of stylised facts {{concerning}} OECD country business cycles {{over the past four}} decades. In general, the amplitude of business cycles has fallen, driven mainly by declining fluctuations of domestic demand. As a result, international divergencies of <b>cyclical</b> <b>positions</b> have diminished but, outside the euro area, there is little evidence of increased synchronisation of cycles. The paper then reviews {{a number of}} influences on business cycles. The evidence suggests that, on balance, features of macroeconomic policies may have tended to reduce cyclical volatility and structural changes, notably the increased share of the service sector in the economies, have also tended to dampen the cycle. More recently, there are signs that financial market prices have increasingly moved in sympathy across countries, and the final section of the paper illustrates how this could affect the international transmission of cyclical shocks and the associated need for policy response...|$|R

40|$|We analyze fiscal rules {{within a}} Monetary Union in the {{presence}} of (i) asymmetric information on member states' potential output and (ii) bail-out among member states. The first-best deficit is contingent on the cycle, that is, on member states' output gap. In the presence of asymmetric information and bailout, the first-best deficit is not implementable. Bail-out lowers the scope for signalling (discrimination) by member states (lenders) and induces overborrowing by member states characterized by a low output gap. The Monetary Union can design a mechanism such that a member state with a smaller negative output gap runs an optimal budget deficit upon receiving a transfer form the Union. We show that, this 'cyclically-contingent' fiscal framework Pareto dominates the 'cyclically-adjusted' fiscal rule currently enforced by the European Monetary Union. Our model can then account for a situation where both asymmetric information over <b>cyclical</b> <b>positions</b> and the presence of bail-out among member states does not induce borrowing distortions...|$|R
40|$|This {{contribution}} outlines {{at first}} different general theories of inflation. It addresses {{the question of}} how inflation differentials between EMU member countries may be explained within these respective frameworks. Within the framework provided by a theory of inflation based on real economic processes, one possible explanatory factor are country-specific differences in capacity utilization caused by different <b>cyclical</b> <b>positions.</b> Inflation differentials caused this way amplify state-specific inflation expectations and trigger pro-cyclical real interest effects; thus they increase asymmetric cyclical fluctuations between EMU member states. A regression analyses of a pooled data set correcting for country-specific fixed effects and using an OLS- as well as a 2 SLS-estimator suggests that the influence of capacity utilization on inflation differentials is statistically significant and economically relevant. Finally, the paper discusses possible political-economic countermeasures. As there are limits to further increases of market integration between EMU members for stabilization purposes, it argues in favour of a reassessment of {{the costs and benefits of}} EMU-wide stabilization funds...|$|R

Among the variables that proved significant are the Canadian terms of trade, measures of long-term borrowing, the relative <b>cyclical</b> <b>position</b> of Canada and the United States, and the market's errors in forecasting the current account balance.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{new evidence}} on inflation differentials in the Euro Area from different perspectives, and extending the sample including the recent financial crisis. First, we give an informal {{analysis of the}} evolution of inflation dispersion and inflation differentials since the start of EMU. Second, we perform formal statistical analyses of the stability properties of inflation differentials in the period 1999 - 2010. Univariate and multivariate tests reject the null of stability of inflation differentials when conducted over the entire sample period. However, when the financial crisis is excluded, the null of stability is not rejected for the large majority of countries. This finding implies {{the beginning of a new}} tendency since the global financial turmoil, and new challenges for the common monetary policy. Finally, we analyze the determinants of inflation differentials, empirically testing a number of theories including price level equalization, productivity differentials, differences in <b>cyclical</b> <b>positions,</b> labor and product market rigidities. We conclude that inflation differentials are not the result of equilibrating, transitory forces, but rather of persistent structural and country-specific factors. This calls for structural reforms in labor and product markets, and countercyclical fiscal policy measures at the individual country level. As inflation differentials pose a serious challenge for the monetary policy of the ECB, we further believe that the ECB should be equipped with additional policy instruments to cope with them in a more direct way.

40|$|Brazil {{before the}} crisis: the asset price boom and {{economic}} upswing Although the subprime crisis {{started in the}} summer of 2007 (in the northern hemisphere), it only reached Brazil, and emerging markets in general, after the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Major central banks {{at the core of the}} crisis responded by aggressively easing policy from mid- 2007, while also introducing measures to help revive interbank funding markets. Thus, capital flows to emerging markets, most of which had deleveraged and strengthened fiscal and monetary policy frameworks in previous years, were initially spared. Emerging economies with rigid exchange rate regimes imported the monetary policy stance prevailing in mature economies, which was ill-suited to their own <b>cyclical</b> <b>positions</b> and, as a result, started to experience faster growth, asset price appreciation and, in several cases, rising inflationary pressures. Even emerging economies, such as Brazil, with flexible foreign exchange regimes, started to see faster asset price appreciation (partly derived from the improvement in the sovereign rating), stronger economic growth, as well as accelerating inflation. Thus, equity prices (the Brazilian stock index – IBOVESPA) rose by 20 % (in local currency) between June 2007 and June 2008 (44 % in USD terms). The local capital market saw R $ 165 billion of issuance, equivalent to around 5. 6 % of GDP (a new activity record), thereby helping to fund Brazilian corporates. At the same time, bank credit rose from 32 % to 36 % of GDP. Not surprisingly, the economy accelerated, with year-on-year GDP growth rising fro...|$|R

40|$|Does the {{gap between}} rich {{countries}} and poor countries gradually narrow and, if so, how much time should the catching-up process be expected to take? These are questions of great social and political relevance, to which there are, however, no general and straightforward answers. Academic research on economic growth, based on cross-country analysis, found that income differentials between comparable countries are reduced by 2 percent per year ("catching-up or ?-coefficient). Still, convergence is not a generally observed phenomenon; it takes place only between countries of similar socio-economic structure, and it proceeds only slowly. At an annual pace of 2 percent it takes almost 35 years to make up half of an original income gap. Carrying further the existing empirical analysis the article presents estimates of country-specific catching-up coefficients for European OECD countries and, {{for the sake of}} comparison, for Japan, using time series for the period 1954 - 1992. The U. S. serve as the reference country. According to these estimates, the catching-up coefficient is actually close to 2 percent for the European Union (EU) as a whole, but country-specific coefficients differ markedly. Moreover, the catching up of western Europe appears to have lost momentum since the 1973 oil price shock. A group of central and northern European OECD countries, which used to be among the less advanced industrialized societies, made the biggest jump forward (with a ?-coefficient of over 3). In the mid-fifties, these countries had been at a per-capita income level less than half (Finland, Italy, Austria) or just half (Germany, France, Norway) that of the U. S. On the other hand, the U. K. and Sweden – which both had attained a per-capita income of two thirds of the U. S. level by the mid-fifties – exhibited catching-up coefficients far below 2. Likewise, the performance of the European periphery was less than strong, with Turkey holding the bottom rank (?-coefficient below 1). Thus, the economically weaker European countries appear to have lost ground vis-à-vis the more dynamic "north", despite substantial transfers and capital inflows (this holds particularly for the period as from 1973). One of the consequences of this development is that within Europe a group of countries has emerged with similar per-capita income, strong internal trade links and homogeneous technology. The rank order in the income "league table" among these countries depends largely on random factors – like discrepancies in statistical assessment, different <b>cyclical</b> <b>positions,</b> etc. – rather than on those relevant for long-term perspectives.

40|$|Following {{a speedy}} {{recovery}} in 1994, western economies have shifted towards a slower growth path in 1995. At present {{there is little}} evidence to suggest that activity may soon reaccelerate. Therefore, inflation should remain at its present low level, while high unemployment in Europe is unlikely to fall substantially. Instead of gaining further momentum according to the usual pattern, demand and output have slowed in the OECD area during the course of 1995. Aggregate GDP may have expanded by 2 1 / 4 percent, following the almost 3 percent annual rate in 1994. Little acceleration is projected until end- 1997; with a growth rate below 3 percent output remains well below potential. Inflationary pressures are thereby kept at bay, an even further weakening seems possible. Employment prospects, on the other hand, are unlikely to become substantially brighter and jobless rates remain too high nearly everywhere. In spite of lackluster activity spreading over most of the OECD area – hardly any of the major countries except Canada is likely to attain a 3 percent annual growth rate before the end of 1997 – and overall growth differentials being small, individual countries are in rather different <b>cyclical</b> <b>positions.</b> In the U. S., the strong recovery passed its peak in 1994 and, as a consequence of preemptive monetary tightening, demand and output have staged a "soft landing". The Japanese economy, on the other hand, has been kept in a recession {{over the last four years}} which even sustained expansionary action by fiscal and monetary policy has not been able to overcome, since it is superseded by problems of structural adjustment concentrated in the financial sector. However, most disappointing has been the early faltering of the recovery in western Europe, reasons which vary from country to country. A common factor were the marked exchange rate shifts – devaluation of the dollar and of several southern European currencies – in spring 1995. These shifts, although being in part corrected subsequently, have undermined competitiveness of hard-currency countries, thereby weakening exports, the major force of expansion; in the weaker-currency countries, at the same time, they gave rise to interest rate hikes – in order to rein in further risks to price and exchange rate stability – which dampen domestic demand. With the prospects for slower growth, continued high price stability and greater resolution of governments to reduce excessive fiscal deficits, interest rates have generally come down in recent months and the trend is unlikely to reverse soon. Low interest rates and the generally good profit situation should strengthen business confidence and the propensity to invest, even if the short-term demand outlook remains fragile. In Europe, simultaneous efforts of fiscal retrenchment undertaken in many countries are likely to lead to shortfalls in demand and output, amplified by multiplier effects. To what extent this restrictive impact will be offset by low interest rates and confidence effects created by the consolidation process itself, remains to be seen.

Nevertheless, strategies fall short in some areas, including committing to long-term debt targets, spelling out adjustment measures in detail, and tackling rising health care costs.

40|$|The paper {{provides}} {{potential output}} and output gap {{estimates for the}} Romanian economy in the period 1998 - 2008. Our approach consists in combining the production function structural method with several statistical de-trending methods. The contribution of our analysis to the scarce literature dealing with the estimation of the <b>cyclical</b> <b>position</b> of the Romanian economy is twofold. First, we identify {{the contribution of the}} production factors to the potential output growth. Second, we aggregate the results obtained through filtering techniques in a consensus estimate, ascribing to each method a weight inversely related to its revision stability. The results suggest for the period 2001 - 2008 an average annual growth rate of the potential output equal to 5. 8 %, but on a descending slope, due to the adverse developments in the macroeconomic context. potential GDP, output gap, NAIRU, business cycle...|$|E
