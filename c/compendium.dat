5|$|In 2015, Soule {{composed}} a Dota 2 music pack, {{along with his}} brother Julian. The soundtrack was available {{as part of the}} <b>Compendium,</b> a pack of digitally-distributed content that funded the prize pool for The International 2015 tournament, which took place in August 2015 and ultimately featured the largest prize-pool in e-sports history, with over $18,000,000 in total.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to recruiting in battle, new demons are acquired through fusion {{at a location}} called the Cathedral of Shadows. Normally only two demons can be fused at once, but under certain conditions more demons can be fused together. Fusions can produce a variety of results based on various circumstances, such as the current phase of Kagutsuchi {{and the addition of}} items called Deathstones. When in the Cathedral of Shadows, the Protagonist can select two demons, viewing a preview of the resultant demon, then initiate a fusion. The resultant demon will both possess its own skills and inherit skills from its two parents: skill inheritance is randomized. Higher-level demons produce more powerful fusions. Demons gained through negotiation or fusion are automatically stored in the Demon <b>Compendium,</b> a record kept within the Cathedral of Shadows. The Protagonist can also pay to summon a demon from the <b>Compendium,</b> returning it to his ranks.|$|E

5|$|Another source from 684 AD, {{during the}} Tang dynasty and {{recorded}} in Li Shizhen's <b>Compendium</b> of Materia Medica, states {{that when the}} leaves are taken internally, they make one incoherent and sleepy, while when used externally they can be effectively used to treat boils, abscesses and itches. Yet another recipe recorded by Li uses the leaves to treat baldness. This formula calls for young leaves of ailanthus, catalpa and peach tree to be crushed together and the resulting liquid applied to the scalp to stimulate hair growth.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the inaugural}} event of The International, several other eSport events began to {{transition}} from Defense of the Ancients to Dota 2, including the Electronic Sports World Cup. DreamHack would also support Dota 2 in 2011, following a year without {{support for the}} original, on account of other MOBA titles such as Heroes of Newerth and League of Legends. By {{the end of its}} first year in its beta phase, Dota 2 was one of the highest-paying eSport titles of 2011, second only to StarCraft II. In 2012, Dota 2 began as an official title for the World Cyber Games annual event at World Cyber Games 2012. The Electronic Sports League (ESL) began a seasonal tournament for Dota 2 called the RaidCall EMS One in 2013, which was the largest independent tournament for Dota 2 by the beginning of 2013. Beginning in September 2013, the Association for Chinese eSports began a league, called the WPC ACE Dota 2 League, which had the largest third-party prize pool in Dota 2 eSports history at the time. At Electronic Entertainment Expo 2013, Nexon announced the investment of two billion South Korean won, (approximately $1.7 million), into amateur and professional leagues in South Korea for 2013, to coincide with the launch of their distribution agreement in the fall of that year. Modeled after the interactive <b>compendium</b> for The International, Valve introduced a <b>compendium</b> third-party tournament organizers could sell, beginning with DreamLeague in February 2014. In February 2015, the Valve-sponsored Dota 2 Asia Championships was held in Shanghai with a prize pool of over $3 million, raised through <b>compendium</b> sales.|$|E
5|$|Frederick Henry Dyer (July 2, 1849 – September 21, 1917) {{served as}} a drummer boy in the Union Army during the American Civil War. After the war, he wrote A <b>Compendium</b> of the War of the Rebellion– a {{complete}} record of every regiment formed under the Union Army, their histories, and the battles they fought in– taking forty years to compile.|$|E
5|$|In the 1630s, {{the texts}} of these annals were {{compiled}} into a single, enormous <b>compendium,</b> known as the Annals of the Four Masters.

However, it is recognised that they saved for posterity material that would otherwise have been lost, and the entry contains the longest annalistic account of the battle.|$|E

5|$|The Crimson Echoes {{project was}} {{launched}} by ZeaLitY in 2004. The development team, dubbed Kajar Laboratories, primarily consisted {{of members of}} the Chrono fansite Chrono <b>Compendium.</b> The team was led by a game director, Agent 12, and two co-directors, ZeaLitY and Chrono'99. To create a story that was compatible with Chrono Trigger and Chrono Cross, the team took full advantage of the Chrono Compendium's encyclopedia and the fandom's knowledge and analysis of the series.|$|E
5|$|The {{instructions}} in <b>Compendium</b> ferculorum are succinct and often vague, lacking such elements of modern culinary recipes as lists of ingredients used, measurements or proportions, and cooking times.

The recipe for stewed meat in saffron sauce, cited below, is typical is this regard.|$|E

5|$|Ācārya Haribhadra (8th century CE) {{was one of}} {{the leading}} proponents of anekāntavāda.

It interacted with the many possible intellectual orientations available to Indian thinkers around the 8th century.|$|E
5|$|As travel became easier, faster, {{and less}} expensive, Germans {{started to see}} unity in factors other than their language. The Brothers Grimm, who {{compiled}} a massive dictionary known as The Grimm, also assembled a <b>compendium</b> of folk tales and fables, which highlighted the story-telling parallels between different regions. Karl Baedeker wrote guidebooks to different cities and regions of Central Europe, indicating places to stay, sites to visit, and giving a short history of castles, battlefields, famous buildings, and famous people. His guides also included distances, roads to avoid, and hiking paths to follow.|$|E
5|$|In 1867, Dyer {{became a}} member of the Grand Army of the Republic (GAR), a {{patriotic}} society of civil war Union veterans. It was around this time that he started to acquire details about Union regiments. His job as a commercial traveller brought him in touch with many veterans and officials, from whom he gathered official figures. The statistics he collected expanded into further areas, from regiments to details of formations, battles, movements, and similar data. He began to research using official records in various state capitals, and continued speaking to ex-soldiers and high-standing officers, such as General Sherman, who expressed interest in a comprehensive <b>compendium</b> and welcomed its future publication.|$|E
