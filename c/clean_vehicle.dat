40|$|Government's {{vision of}} a fossil-free vehicle fleet in 2030 put a high demand on the {{technical}} development and sale of green cars, also named as <b>clean</b> <b>vehicles.</b> The purpose of this thesis is to investigate the trend of the share of <b>clean</b> <b>vehicles</b> into the Swedish market from January 2009 to February 2015. This work will also assess whether there is any economic variable that affects the purchase of <b>clean</b> <b>vehicles</b> as well as regular passenger cars.

The result of a segmented regression analysis showed an increased trend {{in the proportion of}} <b>clean</b> <b>vehicles</b> where time explaining growth. The study cannot explain the underlying factors, because none of the surveyed financial variables could explain the increase in sales of <b>clean</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Therefore the consumer preferences are assumed to be the strongest explanatory variable in the choice of driving a green car. The study could not identify any specific variable that have had a greater impact on the <b>clean</b> <b>vehicles</b> sales due to total sales of passenger cars. For the government to realize the {{vision of a}} fossil-free vehicle fleet more studies about consumer preferences related to the choice of <b>clean</b> <b>vehicles</b> is required. Demand for cars seems to constantly increase and therefore it is doubtful whether the car will ever be substituted off. Therefore the fuel plays the lead role in the evolution towards a more environment-friendly society in order to create opportunities to achieve the vision of a fossil-free fleet...|$|R

Not all plug-in electric vehicles sold in California are captured in the CVRP database because not every PEV owner applies for the rebate. , and without accounting for the 2,300 Volts sold before February 2012, plug-in hybrids represented 42.5% of the 107,855 <b>clean</b> <b>vehicle</b> rebates issued, while BEVs represented 56.9% of all rebates, and fuel cell vehicles represented 0.1% of the rebates issued.
