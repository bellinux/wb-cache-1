5000|$|A self-directed IRA is {{identical}} to an IRA. The term [...] "self-directed" [...] is redundant because all IRAs are self-directed. The difference in terminology is typically attributed to the types of investments which are allowed {{to be held in}} custody by the IRA <b>custodian.</b> A self-directed IRA <b>custodian</b> frequently permits the IRA account owner to make investments into a broader range of alternative investments. Some examples of these alternative investments are: real estate, private mortgages, private company stock, oil and gas limited partnerships, precious metals, horses, and intellectual property. While the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) has placed a few restrictions on what can be invested in, the IRA <b>custodian</b> may impose additional restrictions on what assets they will custody. Self-directed IRA <b>custodians,</b> or IRA <b>custodians</b> who specialize in alternative investments, are better equipped to handle transactions involving alternative investments. When looking to invest IRA assets into alternative investments, it is important to choose the correct self-directed IRA <b>custodian.</b> Most <b>custodians</b> which handle stocks, bonds, and mutual funds are not capable of providing proper custody to alternative investments.|$|R

50|$|The risks {{organizations}} face in e-discovery often correlate {{directly with}} their litigation hold practices. Today, most sanctions result from flawed preservation {{processes that are}} rooted in the failure to identify all <b>custodians,</b> locate all data sources, or monitor compliance with a litigation hold. Some of the most critical yet most challenging steps in these processes are tracking <b>custodians,</b> the litigation hold notices issued, and the responses received from <b>custodians.</b> When <b>custodians</b> number into the hundreds or thousands, {{it can be difficult to}} determine whether they have responded to the initial hold, completed required questionnaires, or reconfirmed their compliance with subsequent hold reminders.

Second, for economic reasons, users require assurance guarantees that the WWA is capable of enforcing their security policies, and so engineering tools must be offered to help them design and verify these policies. This paper describes an approach to these requirements which is based on <b>custodians.</b> A <b>custodian</b> is a software black box which is linked to a WWA server and implements a security policy for objects under the server's control.

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} the current market {{infrastructure}} systemically prevents investors, both shareholders and bondholders, from exercising their rights against issuers.

40|$|In September 1969, Joseph and Lucile Hollis wrote a paper {{entitled}} "Toward Development of Energy Commitment Theory. " In {{this paper}} the authors stated {{that man is}} a dynamic, active, always changing being. As a result of this, man expends considerable energy. Man has the capability of thinking, looking, and planning ahead and does so with the desire of using his energy {{where it will be}} most meaningful to him. He thus, is able to project himself into various alternatives and to consider the possibilities and outcomes. Hollis and Hollis stated the commitment of man's energy determines much of what he will and will' not do. The authors also list a number of propositions underlying the theory. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the feasibility of the energy commitment theory as proposed by Hollis and Hollis. The feasibility of the theory was examined by comparing the energy commitments of two widely different occupational groups, residence hall directors and <b>custodians,</b> both working in residence halls at Ball State University. The comparison was made from the common theoretical framework employing the energy commitment concepts currently being developed by Hollis and Hollis. The basic design of the study included two interviews with each of the subjects in the two occupational groups. The purpose of the first interview was to gather data regarding the direction, thrust (priority, force, and amount), and flexibility of the energy commitments of each subject as he projected them from the time of the interview through the next two months. The purpose of the second interview was to determine if the projected energy commitments which each subject expressed in the first interview had been carried out to fulfillment and if not, the reasons therefore. Two Interview Guides (one for providing structure for all first interviews) and two Interview Recording Sheets (one for recording data for each of the first interviews and one for recording data for each of the second interviews) were designed for the research. Due to the nature of the research and considering the limitations and assumptions of the study, all hypotheses were used as guides for the study. The analysis of the data was descriptive in nature and disclosed the following: 1. Residence Hall Directors commit more energies toward people and ideas while <b>Custodians</b> commit more energies toward objects. 2. Residence Hall Directors place people in a higher priority than do <b>Custodians</b> and <b>custodians</b> place objects and ideas in a higher priority than do directors. 3. Residence Hall Directors spend more time and effort toward people while <b>Custodians</b> spend more time and effort toward objects and ideas. 4. Both groups described. themselves as being somewhat inflexible in their ability to change their commitments. 5. Residence Hall Directors expend more energies toward people and ideas while <b>Custodians</b> expend more energies toward objects. 6. Residence Hall Directors place people in a higher priority than do <b>Custodians</b> but <b>custodians</b> place objects and ideas in a higher priority than do directors. 7. Both Residence Hall Directors and <b>Custodians</b> can project their energy commitments into the future with considerable accuracy. 8. Regarding antecedents of energy commitments, <b>Custodians</b> indicated that they had been controlled by their environment while Directors seemed to have made decisions which changed the direction of their lives. The descriptive analysis of the data collected in the study were applicable to substantiated some of the propositions of the Hollis and Hollis theory. Some propositions are substantiated to a higher degree when analyzing that data collected on Residence Hall Directors than on <b>Custodians.</b> From the findings of this study, it appears that energy commitment theory does have potential but further research must be accomplished.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} research was to bring voice to university <b>custodians</b> as blue-collar workers by exploring {{the manner in which}} four <b>custodians</b> interact with students on a university campus. The following research questions framed this study: 1) In what ways do four campus <b>custodians</b> interact with students during their work day at a large public university? 2) In what ways do those <b>custodians</b> talk about students and their interactions with students? This study adopted a critical philosophical lens that acknowledged the historically-marginalized voice of <b>custodians</b> as campus blue-collar workers. Extant research on blue-collar worker identity theory and college student-staff interactions and mentoring literature, as well as the author 2 ̆ 7 s own blue-collar background, informed and framed the study. Qualitative data sources for this ethnographically-grounded case study were four campus <b>custodians</b> employed in three residence halls during the academic year at a large, public university in the Midwest. A moderate participant observation strategy melded with a semi-structured interview protocol were employed. Data were collected and transcribed during seventy-five hours of observations throughout a six-week time span. Mutual benefits to both college student success and custodial staff occupational esteem were identified in custodial staff-student interactions. More specifically, custodial staff participants were found to indirectly support college student success via formally acknowledged and performed cleaning and maintenance duties of observing, protecting, and promoting the health of college students. Additionally, custodial staff directly supported college student success via informally-performed actions of remembering, comforting, advising, exchanging and keeping gifts, and participating in events with students. Based on these findings, this study advises college and university decision-makers to consider <b>custodians</b> as important mentors for, and allies to, college student success. Suggestions for professional practice include 1) Acknowledging and leveraging <b>custodians</b> 2 ̆ 7 unique assets and contributions, 2) Fostering relationships between students and <b>custodians,</b> 3) Increasing <b>custodian</b> 2 ̆ 7 s opportunities for professional development, 4) Considering <b>custodians</b> 2 ̆ 7 potential to support student success in <b>custodian</b> hiring decisions, and 5) Training Custodial Staff in Basic Crisis Intervention.

40|$|Heritage {{conservation}} {{has long}} been a hot topic all over the world. This is especially true for cosmopolitan cities where population density is high and the land resources are in shortage. Hong Kong, a city located on the southern coast of China at the junction of the Pearl River Estuary and the South China Sea, {{has one of the highest}} population density in the world. Continued existence of historic building is a difficult achievement, but there is a rare case at The Helena May, a private membership clubhouse which has stood for almost a century. Every heritage monument, site, artefact, and object is owned by, occupied by, or is the responsibility of some individuals. They are the site managers – the <b>custodians</b> of the heritage. This research aims at examining the challenges in managing a heritage site from the perspectives of the <b>custodians.</b> As the <b>custodians</b> of the heritage buildings, site managers are playing an increasingly important role in operationally sustaining and maintaining the building. The continuous survival of The Helena May is a very rare case in Hong Kong. The secrets behind the management and conservation of this heritage building would provide guidance for the <b>custodians</b> of other heritage buildings in Hong Kong in their quest to adapting to the ever-changing social and economic environment in the city. Through this research, the importance of intangible considerations in the process of conditional survey will be emphasised. Apart from the external requirements by the government and the existing physical conditions of the building, the significance and values of the building, and the roles of stakeholders also play their important roles in determining the conservation plan of the historic building. The framework of this research is based on the Process of Formulating a Conservation Plan (see Table 1) in the publication: The Conservation Plan. 1 A thorough condition survey of The Helena May will be conducted to demonstrate the challenges faced by the site managers in managing a historic building in Hong Kong. This research will also form the basis for future researches on similar historic buildings in Hong Kong and other World Heritage Site. 1 Kerr, J. S. The Conservation Plan.

40|$|This {{qualitative}} {{study sought to}} understand the ways classism, as it intersects with racism and sexism, affects how low wage-earning women negotiate their work world in the academy {{and the way the}} academy functions to create, maintain, and reproduce the context within which oppression is able to emerge. Field research took place at State University, a pseudonym for a Land Grant, Research Extensive institution located in the Southwest. Through the lenses of critical theory and critical feminist theory the stories of six women employed as custodial workers, nine administrators employed at State University, and two State University employees involved in the community's Living Wage initiative, were analyzed. The lives of women employed as custodial workers are largely unremarked and undocumented, {{and the ways in which}} their work serves to make the academy possible have been unacknowledged. This study found that the job of cleaning in the traditional higher education environment is laced with challenges. The nature of the academy, the ethos and operation of State University, and the interlocking systems of classism, racism and sexism fuse together arrangements of power that simultaneously obliterate and render these women agonizingly visible through systems of oppression. In an environment where honor is conferred upon "the educated," the custodial participants, whose opportunities were limited due to their social locations, exist on the border of the academy. Their marginality is reinforced daily, as they are in constant contact with higher-status individuals who perform raced, classed, and gendered behaviors that are woven into the fabric of our society. The study also found that the custodial participants and the university administrators are locked in a relationship of mutual distrust. State University administrators do not trust the <b>custodians</b> and the <b>custodians</b> do not trust State University administrators. Furthermore, existing at both the literal and metaphorical "bottom" of the organization, <b>custodians</b> are among the first to feel the impact of major institutional shifts, such as increases in student and faculty bodies, and large-scale economic recovery initiatives. Additionally, I reconceptualize the notion of "borrowed power" to name the impermanence of the authority which Black custodial supervisors, and people of color in general, hold in our racialized society. Finally, the data decidedly point to White male students as primary actors and architects of the overtly hostile work environment within which the women work. The custodial participants negotiate these challenges with facility. They find creative ways to resist and to negotiate the obstacles they face. Unfortunately, they also occasionally internalize negative messages and are complicit in their marginality. Administrators who participated in the study were aware of these conditions, but remained silent on the issue of resolution. Through various intentional (if unconscious) State University policies, practices, rules, norms, behaviors, and structures that sometimes act in insidious, hidden ways, the dominant groups? interests continue to be pursued while the interests, needs, and even the very presence of marginal members is ignored. Thus, systems of domination and subordination are produced, reproduced, validated, and institutionalized in the academy. This process is presented in a Conceptual Map of How Systems of Oppression Flourish and are Re/produced in the Academy. The findings of this study contribute to existing bodies of knowledge that discuss racial, gender, and economic inequality. Yet it opens new lines of inquiry into the overlapping conditions of gender, racial, and economic marginality as they impact the lives of women custodial workers in the academy. The findings issue a clarion call for institutions of higher education, one of our nation?s longstanding and respected foci of social change, to tap into its available expertise to end oppression, beginning in its own "backyard. ...|$|R
