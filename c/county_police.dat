5|$|Today, {{the duties}} of the sheriff include law {{enforcement}} services of the two county courthouses and surrounding property, service of court-ordered warrants, writs, protective orders, and other injunctions, and limited patrol responsibility with the <b>County</b> <b>Police.</b> The Domestic Violence Unit has expanded its role in the county to include responding to calls for service that are domestic-related. The creation of the School Resource Deputy division has placed a deputy sheriff at all of the local high schools, replacing the <b>County</b> <b>Police.</b> All other law enforcement services of the county are provided by multiple agencies but mostly left to the separate Prince George's <b>County</b> <b>Police</b> Department (PGPD), though some responsibilities are shared by both agencies. The PGSO, like most other county-level law enforcement agencies in the United States, is a progressive agency with an array of services in tom a Specialized Services Team dealing with high-risk arrest warrants and barricaded situations to community services aiding the county's residents in safety education. Although the agency is not yet nationally accredited, it currently has a unit dedicated to accreditation.|$|E
5|$|In November 1991, the Ministry of the Interior {{redefined the}} {{organisation}} {{of the special}} police force, retaining a few units under direct control of the ministry and assigning others to <b>county</b> <b>police</b> administrations. The move was devised {{in response to the}} advance of the JNA. The scheme included the establishment of an SPU in each of the 20 <b>county</b> <b>police</b> administrations. At the time, there were up to 19 such SPUs. Under the scheme, the Karlovac, Gospić, Osijek, Slavonski Brod and Zagreb SPUs were planned to have 180 troops each. The Rijeka, Sisak, Bjelovar and Šibenik SPUs were scheduled to comprise 150 troops each, while the Split, Zadar, Kutina, Vinkovci, Županja and Vukovar SPUs were planned as 120-strong units. The smallest, 100-strong units were to be based in Pula, Varaždin, Zabok and Dubrovnik. Overall, the scheme called for 2,620 active special police troops in the regionally organised units alone, and defined that each of the units should have a matching number of reserve troops.|$|E
5000|$|In 1839, the <b>County</b> <b>Policing</b> Act passed {{allowing}} <b>counties</b> to form <b>police</b> {{forces on}} top of city police forces, as a result Wiltshire Constabulary was formed in October 1839.|$|R

5|$|A 2006 {{poll shows}} {{a high degree}} of {{satisfaction}} with the work of the local police department. More than half the people surveyed during a 2005–2006 poll declared themselves satisfied (62.3%) or very satisfied (3.3%) with the activity of the <b>county</b> <b>police</b> department. The study found the highest satisfaction with car traffic supervision, the presence of officers in the street, and road education; on the negative side, corruption and public transport safety remain concerns.|$|E
5|$|In mid-May, {{three of}} Bundy's Washington State DES coworkers, {{including}} Carole Ann Boone, {{visited him in}} Salt Lake City and stayed for a week in his apartment. Bundy subsequently spent a week in Seattle with Kloepfer in early June and they discussed getting married the following Christmas. Again, Kloepfer {{made no mention of}} her multiple discussions with the King <b>County</b> <b>Police</b> and Salt Lake County Sheriff's Office, and Bundy disclosed neither his ongoing relationship with Boone nor a concurrent romance with a Utah law student known in various accounts as Kim Andrews or Sharon Auer.|$|E
5|$|King <b>County</b> <b>police,</b> finally {{armed with}} a {{detailed}} description of their suspect as well as his car, posted fliers throughout the Seattle area. A composite sketch was printed in regional newspapers and broadcast on local television stations. Elizabeth Kloepfer, Ann Rule, a DES employee, and a UW psychology professor all recognized the profile, the sketch, and the car, and reported Bundy as a possible suspect; but detectives—who were receiving up to 200 tips per day—thought it unlikely that a clean-cut law student with no adult criminal record could be the perpetrator.|$|E
5000|$|On February 1, 1940, {{the first}} Arlington <b>County</b> <b>policing</b> {{department}} was formed, {{under the name}} of the [...] "Arlington County Division of Police". A few years later, the first ACPD auxiliary force was created.|$|R
50|$|Afterwards, Mr. Flood and the Combined <b>Counties</b> <b>Police</b> Association, {{which he}} led for thirty three years, {{negotiated}} {{a series of}} ground-breaking collective bargaining agreements in Illinois, effectively founding the police union movement of the United States.|$|R

5|$|On June 28, 2008, a 17-year-old South Carolina {{teenager}} was decapitated {{after being}} struck by the Batman roller coaster at Six Flags Over Georgia. The teen, who was {{on a trip to}} the park with his church's youth group, scaled two fences with a friend into a restricted area and walked into the ride's path. Although witnesses stated he was trying to retrieve his hat, a Cobb <b>County</b> <b>police</b> spokesman reported the teens were attempting to take a shortcut into the park.|$|E
5|$|On May 21, 1952, {{large numbers}} of trucks were spotted by Jersey City police {{entering}} {{the city on the}} skyway. Upon pulling over the drivers, they were told that the exit in Newark for the truck route was closed for construction. A call to Newark police confirmed the situation. Hudson <b>County</b> <b>police</b> refused to force trucks to exit before Jersey City, since there was no state law banning trucks from the skyway. Jersey City Police Chief James McNamara gave in, and trucks were temporarily allowed to use the skyway, though only in one direction.|$|E
5|$|Rovers Tye Farm, a pub since 1983, was {{established}} by 1353, and a causeway at this location had been built by 1429, by which point Ipswich Road ran on its current route. The road once contained the County Gaol and <b>County</b> <b>Police</b> Station. The Grade II listed St. John's Church was built in 1864 by Arthur Blomfield in the High Victorian Early Gothic style. The toothpaste tube manufacturer Betts opened a factory at No.505 Ipswich Road in 1953. More recently there have been the development of housing and industrial estates along the road, particularly automobile dealers, at the northern end where it meets the A12.|$|E

5|$|In November, Elizabeth Kloepfer, {{having read}} that young women were now disappearing in towns {{surrounding}} Salt Lake City, called King <b>County</b> <b>police</b> a second time. Detective Randy Hergesheimer of the Major Crimes division interviewed her in detail. By then, Bundy had risen considerably on the King County hierarchy of suspicion, but the Lake Sammamish witness considered most reliable by detectives failed to identify {{him from a}} photo lineup. In December, Kloepfer called the Salt Lake County Sheriff's Office and repeated her suspicions. Bundy's name was added to their list of suspects, {{but at that time}} no credible evidence linked him to the Utah crimes. In January 1975 Bundy returned to Seattle after his final exams and spent a week with Kloepfer, who did not tell him that she had reported him to police on three separate occasions. She made plans to visit him in Salt Lake City in August.|$|E
5|$|Residents of Cove Neck {{immediately}} called emergency services. Jeff Race, a paramedic {{and member of}} New York City's Emergency Medical Service who lived {{half a mile from}} the crash site was the first rescuer on site. He reported that most passengers were still strapped in their seats and the survivors were crying out for help. Survivors later commented that it took about half an hour for rescue teams to arrive. Initial reports to emergency services reported that a much larger Boeing 747 had crashed. Fire Chief Thomas Reardon of Oyster Bay Fire Company No. 1 {{was in charge of the}} initial effort to remove people from the wreckage. In his first call to the Nassau County Fire Commission dispatch, he requested all the help available. Thirty-seven fire and ambulance companies, as well as more than seven hundred Nassau <b>County</b> <b>police</b> officers arrived to help. Other companies that were not called showed up voluntarily to assist. The swell of support created major problems for extricating survivors.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} {{response to}} the strike and riot became a political football between the Republican leadership of Indianapolis, and the Democratic leadership of the state. The refusal by the city police to battle the strikers was met with approval by Mayor of Indianapolis, Republican Samuel Shank. Shank informed Governor Samuel Ralston that the strike was growing beyond what he could control and insisted the Governor should take responsibility {{for dealing with the}} situation. Shank asked Ralston to call a special session of the Indiana General Assembly to end the strike through a compulsory arbitration law, but Ralston refused because he thought it unlikely that the General Assembly could agree to such legislation in a timely manner. Ralston believed Shank was undermining the police effort and told him to order the city police back into action, but Shank refused. Ralston then bypassed the mayor and requested that County Sheriff, Democrat Theodore Porttens, bring in <b>county</b> <b>police</b> to reestablish order.|$|E

25|$|Jefferson County EMS had its {{beginnings}} in the now-defunct Jefferson <b>County</b> <b>Police</b> Department. Beginning with police officer paramedics in 1975 and eventually evolving into non-law enforcement personnel assigned only to providing emergency medical care, the Emergency Medical Squad of the <b>county</b> <b>police</b> became Jefferson County Emergency Medical Services (JCEMS) in 1987.|$|E
