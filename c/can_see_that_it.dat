The Toms River Volunteer Fire Company Number One {{was used to}} provide the [...] "rain" [...] {{during one of the}} exterior scenes. If you look closely, you <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is sunny and not [...] "raining" [...] in the background, the next street over.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike the edicts of Ashoka, {{however, the}} {{majority}} of the inscriptions from this early period in Sri Lanka are found above caves, are only a few words in length and [...] "rarely say anything more than the name of the donor (who paid for the renovation of the cave, presumably); sometimes the donor's profession and village-of-origin are added, and sometimes the reader may be unable to guess if they are looking at the name of a person, profession or village, but <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is a name in any case (and not a philosophical statement)." [...] The language of Sri Lanka Brahmi inscriptions has been mostly been Prakrit though some Tamil-Brahmi inscriptions have also been found, such as the Annaicoddai seal.|$|E
2500|$|Peter Lam, {{chairman}} of Media Asia {{and of the}} Hong Kong Tourism Board, said: [...] "The fact that the film got the prize is a tragedy for Hong Kong's movie industry [...] politics has kidnapped the profession and politicised film-awarding events." [...] Lam added that, from a film investor's perspective: [...] "The movie did not possess the qualities of best film, as you <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was not nominated for best actress or best actor awards, nor was it a blockbuster." [...] Crucindo Hung, former {{chairman of}} the Federation of Motion Film Producers of Hong Kong, criticised the award as [...] "an out-of-your-mind and outrageous decision." [...] Lam further defended his remark from criticism, but earned further rebuke to his statement implying that a wonton noodles shop ought never {{to be able to be}} voted the best restaurant in Hong Kong. Some members of the Chamber of Films said that they would submit a proposal to the Hong Kong Film Awards Association to change the voting mechanism of the awards. [...] Daniel Lam, Chamber of Films member and owner of Universe Films, whose film Little Big Master lost out to Ten Years, said that current voting mechanism [...] "can be easily manipulated to produce an irrational result".|$|E

In this example, we <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> not {{necessary}} to choose symmetrically the key-bouts - {{it depends on the}} goals of the tournament. In this case, managers chose the three last bouts to be key-bouts, giving special attention to the consistent competitors.|$|R

2500|$|Rationalism {{is often}} contrasted with empiricism. Taken very broadly these views are not {{mutually}} exclusive, since a philosopher can be both rationalist and empiricist. Taken to extremes, the empiricist view holds that all ideas come to us a posteriori, that is to say, through experience; either through the external senses or through such inner sensations as pain and gratification. The empiricist essentially believes that knowledge is based on or derived directly from experience. The rationalist believes we come to knowledge a priori– {{through the use of}} logic– and is thus independent of sensory experience. In other words, as Galen Strawson once wrote, [...] "you <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is true just lying on your couch. You don't have to get up off your couch and go outside and examine the way things are in the physical world. You don't have to do any science." [...] Between both philosophies, the issue at hand is the fundamental source of human knowledge and the proper techniques for verifying what we think we know. Whereas both philosophies are under the umbrella of epistemology, their argument lies in the understanding of the warrant, which is under the wider epistemic umbrella of the theory of justification.|$|E

"No doubt," [...] {{said the}} Captain, paying no {{attention}} to the last remark, [...] "I <b>see,</b> and believe, <b>that</b> at some time or other the ice here must have been in a flowin' state.

5|$|What Bethesda had {{originally}} disclosed to us, as an example: In {{that section of}} the game, there is a hanging corpse. What they disclosed to us was a hanging corpse in the dark, pretty far away and without much detail. And yet, when you bring a torch up to the hanging corpse in the actual game, you <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> very mutilated with lots of blood and bones. That {{was a very different}} depiction, far more intense, far more extreme than what had been disclosed to us.|$|R
