2500|$|Hedge funds {{share many}} of the same types of risk as other {{investment}} classes, including liquidity risk and manager risk. Liquidity refers to the degree to which an asset can be bought and sold or converted to cash; similar to private equity funds, hedge funds employ a lock-up period during which an investor cannot remove money. Manager risk refers to those risks which arise from the management of funds. As well as specific risks such as style drift, which refers to a fund manager [...] "drifting" [...] away from an area of specific expertise, manager risk factors include valuation risk, capacity risk, <b>concentration</b> <b>risk</b> and leverage risk. Valuation risk refers to the concern that the net asset value of investments may be inaccurate; capacity risk can arise from placing too much money into one particular strategy, which may lead to fund performance deterioration; and <b>concentration</b> <b>risk</b> may arise if a fund has too much exposure to a particular investment, sector, trading strategy, or group of correlated funds. These risks may be managed through defined controls over conflict of interest, restrictions on allocation of funds, and set exposure limits for strategies.|$|E

50|$|There are {{two types}} of <b>concentration</b> <b>risk.</b> These types are based on the sources of the risk. <b>Concentration</b> <b>risk</b> can arise from uneven {{distribution}} of exposures (or loan) to its borrowers.

It employs a simple model where banks are exposed to both credit and liquidity risk, there is no asymmetric information, no market power, no friction in secondary markets and deposit contracts are fully contingent. We show that (a) the <b>concentration</b> of <b>risks</b> induced by changes in bank market structure makes interbank market breakdowns more likely; (b) welfare monotonically decreases in risk concentration; and (c) <b>risk</b> <b>concentration</b> and a high probability of interbank market breakdowns can be driven by risk control diseconomies of scale and scope and increases in financial firms’ size. As banking systems become more concentrated, improvement of risk control technologies in financial institutions and in regulatory bodies appear as important as other policies considered in the literature to minimize the probability of interbank market breakdowns. bank market structure; systemic risk; interbank markets...|$|R

50|$|Risk of default is an {{important}} factor in <b>concentration</b> <b>risk.</b> The basic issue raised by the concept of default risk is: does the risk of default on a bank's outstanding loans match the overall risk posed by the entire economy or are the bank's loans concentrated in areas of higher or lower than average risk based on their volume, type, amount, and industry.|$|E

The aim {{of this paper is}} to assess and relate <b>risk</b> <b>concentration</b> and joint default probabilities of the group’s legal entities in order to achieve a more comprehensive picture of an insurance group’s <b>risk</b> situation. <b>Risk</b> <b>concentration</b> is measured using the con-cept of economic capital. We further examine the impact of the type of dependence structure on results by comparing linear and nonlinear dependencies using different copula concepts under certain distributional assumptions. Our results show that even if financial groups with different dependence structures do have the same <b>risk</b> <b>concentration</b> factor, joint default probabilities of different sets of subsidiaries can vary tremendously...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Concentration</b> <b>risk</b> is {{a banking}} term {{denoting}} the overall spread of a bank's outstanding accounts over the number or variety of debtors {{to whom the}} bank has lent money. This risk is calculated using a [...] "concentration ratio" [...] which explains {{what percentage of the}} outstanding accounts each bank loan represents. For example, if a bank has 5 outstanding loans of equal value each loan would have a concentration ratio of [...]2; if it had 3, it would be [...]333.|$|E

50|$|Aggregate risk has {{potentially}} large {{implications for}} economic growth. For example, {{in the presence}} of credit rationing, aggregate risk can cause bank failures and hinder capital accumulation. Banks may respond to increases in profitability-threatening aggregate risk by raising standards for quality and quantity credit rationing to reduce monitoring costs; but the practice of lending to small numbers of borrowers reduces the diversification of bank portfolios (<b>concentration</b> <b>risk)</b> while also denying credit to some potentially productive firms or industries. As a result, capital accumulation and the overall productivity level of the economy can decline.|$|E
40|$|By mid 2004, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) is epected {{to launch}} its final {{recommendations}} on minimum capital requirements {{in the banking}} industry. Although there is the intention to arrive at capital charges which concur with economic intuition, the risk weight formulas proposed by the committee will lack an adequate treatment of <b>concentration</b> <b>risks</b> in credit portfolios. The question arises whether this problem can be solved without recourse to fully-fledged portfolio models. Since recent practical experience shows that the risk measure Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) is particularly well suited for detecting concentrations, we develop the semi-asymptotic approach by Emmer and Tasche in the CVaR context and compare it with the capital charges recently suggested by the Basel Committee. Both approaches {{are based on the}} same Vasicek one-factor model. ...|$|R

5000|$|Various {{other factors}} enter into this {{equation}} {{in real world}} applications, where loans are not evenly distributed or are heavily concentrated in certain economic sectors.

Also, loans weighted towards a specific economic sector would create a higher ratio than a set of evenly distributed loans because the evenly spread loans would serve to offset the risk of economic downturn and default in any one specific industry damaging the bank's outstanding accounts.|$|E

[...] "One of the concerns raised by regulatory bodies is the concentration of CDS trading {{in only a few}} dealer institutions in recent years. (Note that the top 10 global banks are involved in 70% of all credit derivatives transactions.) Over time, the use of clearinghouses such as ICE Trust Clear Credit LLC since July 16, 2011 is expected to reduce the volume of settlement payments among members of the clearinghouse and, in theory, reduce counterparty credit risks that arise under CDS. However, trading CDS through clearinghouses may not effectively address <b>concentration</b> <b>risk</b> given that, at least initially, the clearinghouse members will be the major dealers currently involved in most trades. In order to address counterparty risk, members must provide collateral to ICE Trust Clear Credit LLC since July 16, 2011 to cover their obligations under cleared CDS.
