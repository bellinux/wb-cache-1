40|$|The {{electrical}} interference in electrocardiogram (EKG) caused by procedures like electroconvulsive therapy, extracorporeal roller pump, deep brain stimulation, crystalloid administration {{are well known}} in the literature and they varies from mild interference to life threatening arrhythmia. This may create unnecessary panic in operation theaters, cardiac catheterization laboratories or other setups while managing critical patients. We came across a case of 23 -year-old male with rheumatic heart disease who was undergoing cardiac catheterization. He was being monitored simultaneously for ECG and intra-arterial pressure with a monitor (Seimens-elema-AB). The patient was showing normal sinus rhythm in EKG. After that he was put on COM machine for noninvasive cardiac output monitoring. After switching on the COM machine, the EKG waveform changed from normal sinus rhythm to one resembling to life threatening ventricular tachycardia EKG. That lead to panic in catheterization laboratory, but patient remained clinically and hemodynamically stable (as evidenced by no alteration in arterial pressure waveform) throughout this period. EKG waveform returned to normal on switching off the <b>COM</b> <b>device.</b> This finding was consistent and reproducible. The alteration did not occur on using a different EKG and pressure-monitoring device. The alteration in waveform was obviously due to {{electrical interference}} between two monitoring equipments. On closer examination of the waveform, true R-waves can be seen superimposed on an undergoing sinus wave pattern. </span...|$|E

40|$|Background. Increased {{metal ion}} levels {{following}} {{total hip arthroplasty}} (THA) with metal-on-metal bearings are a highly debated topic. Local soft tissue reactions with chronic pain and systemic side effects such as neuropathy are described. The aim {{of the current study}} was to determine the serum metal ion concentrations of Cobalt (Co) and Chrome (Cr) after THA with a ceramic-on-metal (CoM) bearing. Patients and Methods. Between 2008 and 2010, 20 patients underwent THA using a CoM bearing. Clinical function was evaluated by standardized scores systems (Harris Hip Score and WOMAC Score) and radiological examination included X-rays. Patient’s blood samples were obtained for metal ion analysis and correlation analysis was done between these results and implant position. Results. Overall, 13 patients with 14 <b>CoM</b> <b>devices</b> were available for the current series. The mean age at time of surgery was 61 years (range, 41 to 85). The postoperative follow-up ranged from 49 to 68 months (mean, 58). Metal ion determination showed mean concentrations of 3, 1 [*]µg/L (range, 0, 3 – 15, 2 [*]µg/L) for Co and 1, 6 [*]µg/L (range, 0, 1 – 5, 5 [*]µg/L) for Cr, respectively. A correlation between cup anteversion and Co and Cr concentrations was shown. Conclusion. The current series showed increments for Co and Cr following CoM THA. However, these levels are lower compared to metal ion concentrations in patients with metal-on-metal bearings and the international accepted threshold for revision of MoM devices. We recommend routine follow-up including at least one obligatory evaluation of serum metal ion concentrations and an MRI once to exclude local soft tissue reactions...|$|R

40|$|The Author(s) 2013. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. <b>com</b> Abstract Neuro-prosthetic <b>devices</b> aim to restore impaired function through artificial {{stimulation of the}} nervous system. A lingering technological bottleneck in this field is the reali-zation of soft, micron sized electrodes capable of injecting enough charge to evoke localized neuronal activity without causing neither electrode nor tissue damage. Direct stimula-tion with micro electrodes will offer the high efficacy needed in applications such as cochlear and retinal implants. Here we present a new flexible neuronal micro electrode device, based entirely on carbon nanotube technology, where both the conducting traces and the stimulating electrodes consist of conducting carbon nanotube films embedded in a poly-meric support. The use of carbon nanotubes bestows the electrodes flexibility and excellent electrochemical proper-ties. As opposed to contemporary flexible neuronal elec-trodes, the technology presented here is both robust and the resulting stimulating electrodes are nearly purely ca-pacitive. Recording and stimulation tests with chick retinas were used to validate the advantageous properties of the electrodes and demonstrate their suitability for high-efficacy neuronal stimulation applications...|$|R
40|$|The Author(s) 2015. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. <b>com</b> Abstract The <b>devices</b> surrounding us become smarter and can autonomously form a network without requiring our intervention. However, our needs {{can be even}} better ac-commodated when the networked devices cooperate and complement each other’s capa-bilities. One of the initial steps towards achieving a cooperative platform of smart devices is the discovery of resources and capabilities within the network. Today’s operational service discovery protocols carry simple text-based uniform resource identifiers that are not expressive enough. Machines cannot comprehend {{the meaning of a}} new service that is not in their knowledge base. In addition to being more expressive, service discovery protocols must compensate the diversity to improve cooperation between the devices that use dif-ferent application protocols and operate on different communication interfaces. In this paper, we propose the Smart Discovery Protocol (SDP) which outperforms the operational service discovery protocols with three main features: (1) more expressive semantic rep-resentation of the services, (2) operating in the network layer to deal with diversity, and (3) unifying existing service discovery protocols.

Quote of the Day is a quotation article that {{can be found in the}} front page of Koran Sindo. There is only one quotation article each day with different famous people quotation around the world. Koran Sindo, first published on June 30 th 2005, is daily Indonesian newspaper. The theory of translation by Peter Newmark (1981) and theory of cohesion by Halliday and Hasan (1976) were used as the main theories in this research. In his study, the writer used descriptive qualitative approach. He analyzed ten quotation articles of Indonesian from Koran Sindo on 1 st to 10 th February 2009. While the English version were gained from some websites in the internet (thinkexist. com, spacequotation. com and brainyquote. <b>com).</b> Cohesive <b>devices</b> that were used in Indonesian translation in terms of grammatical cohesion were reference, ellipsis, and conjunction and the most frequently used of grammatical cohesion was conjunction by ten occurrences. Moreover, the cohesive devices used in Indonesian in terms of lexical cohesion were repetition, superordinate, general world, synonym, and collocation and the most frequently used of lexical cohesion was repetition by fifteen occurrences. While cohesive devices used in English version in terms of grammatical cohesion were reference, ellipsis, and conjunction and the most frequently used of grammatical cohesion was conjunction by nine occurrences. Moreover, the cohesive devices used in English in terms of lexical cohesion were repetition, superordinate, general word, and collocation and the most frequently used of lexical cohesion were repetition by seventeen occurrences. The similarities between Indonesian and English versions in term of cohesive devices were both Indonesian and English versions used repetition and conjunction more often. Moreover, both of them did not use substitution as the cohesive devices. The differences between Indonesian and English versions were only in terms of choices of cohesive devices in some of the articles. The use of repetition as the cohesive device in Indonesian and English versions indicated that both versions wanted to avoid ambiguity so that the readers could understand the quotation easily. In addition, the use of ellipsis in both versions was to establish cohesive link...|$|R
40|$|Plan B {{paper in}} partial {{fulfillment}} of the Master of Science, Technology, and Environmental Policy degree requirementAn increasingly common strategy for promoting development {{over the past decade}} or more has been that of donating used computers to organizations in developing countries. Some organizations, such as Computer Aid International and World Computer Exchange, do this as a non-profit venture while companies such as Free- <b>Com</b> and <b>Device</b> Global do so on a for-profit basis (Bridges. org, 2004). In either case the fundamental process is the same: people or organizations in the more developed countries donate their used computers after the machines have reached their expected usable lifetime. This lifetime is usually three to four years for computers donated by companies and perhaps more for those donated by individuals. Considering that computers have an overall average lifetime of perhaps eight years, this leaves four or five years of functionality in the machine. Rather than dispose of this functional equipment, the machines are donated to organizations that sort them, do various amounts of refurbishment, and then ship them overseas. Of course those who donate used machines are not doing it solely out of altruism. Development of computer equipment progresses so rapidly that machines that are only four years old possess just a fraction of the capability of new machines and will quickly begin to experience problems with the latest versions of software applications written for newer generations of computers. Rather than expend maintenance energy on computers increasingly unable to handle the latest software, computer owners consider upgrading every three or four years simply part of the cost of ownership. The computers being shipped overseas are by definition obsolete, and yet they are still functional. Considering the financial constraints in developing countries it clearly makes sense from a private economic perspective to purchase obsolete but functional computers at low cost—or even better, to receive the machines free or for the cost of shipping. Since the fundamental principles of personal computer operation have changed little over the last 20 years, older computers still exhibit similar educational potential both for end users and technical staff. The used machines may not run the latest software, but they run some software and that is better than nothing. They may break down at a higher rate than new computers, but to ingenious computer lab managers in developing countries, failing equipment is simply an opportunity to teach hardware maintenance skills. On the face of it, shipping used computers to organizations in developing countries is a win win proposition. Those donating the machines have them taken off their hands—generally at no cost—and get warm recognition for helping to “bridge the digital divide,” while those on the receiving end get usable equipment at low cost. But this private economic perspective is too simplistic and overlooks the possibility of external societal costs. Ultimately the donated computers will be scrapped when no more use can be coaxed out of them. What happens to them at that point? Are they dumped in a landfill and left to leach out toxic material into the ground water? Are they broken down for recyclable materials, exposing local communities and those doing the processing to toxic dust and smoke? What environmental costs may they impose on the society they were intended to assist? And how can these environmental costs be balanced against the societal benefits of the computers? Further inspection of the transportation of used computers reveals that the non-profit scenario described above makes up {{only a small portion of}} the overall trade. The larger portion of the sector is driven by the private economic interests of companies and individuals seeking to profit from the exchange of used computers. Private, profit-seeking companies may be more prone than non-profit organizations to ignore the environmental and societal externalities of the trade. As a report by the Basel Action Network (BAN) says, “[t]he reality is that this burgeoning new trade is not driven by altruism, but rather by the immense profits that can be made through it, and those involved are oblivious to or unconcerned with its adverse consequences. ” (Puckett, 2005, p. 2) Within the for-profit sector there is a division between a few large companies like Freecom and Device Global, which appear to see their mission much as the non-profits do, and innumerable small outfits interested in just shipping computers for profit. Although it may be impossible to quantify the effects of computer end-of-life issues to the degree necessary to compare them with the economic benefits incurred from computer use, it is only reasonable for the donating entities, processors, and recipients to consider these issues when deciding what machines to donate, process, and accept. This paper describes the primary benefits and costs of using refurbished computer equipment for development and places these costs and benefits in the context of the electronic waste issues. The paper does not reach strictly quantifiable conclusions, but frames the issues and indicates what concerns stake-holders should consider when deciding whether and to what extent to utilize refurbished computers. This approach necessarily examines the societal costs and benefits in addition to private concerns, which may hold weight for those interested in using refurbished computers for development and are interested in societal changes, not simply private benefits—particularly government and non-profit agencies...|$|R
