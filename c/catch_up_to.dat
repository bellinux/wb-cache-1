5|$|According to the JNA, the Bosnian Croat TO {{attacked}} {{in the morning}} of 3 April, reached the village of Donji Malovan and blockaded the Kupreška Vrata Tunnel by 7:30a.m. The village was captured by Croats after three hours of combat, and the fighting shifted towards the village of Gornji Malovan and Kupres. By the end of the day, the Bosnian Serb TO force in Gornji Malovan was besieged. The JNA instructed the Yugoslav Air Force to attack after it received reports that 15 HV tanks had appeared on the battlefield. The 30th Partisan Division staff amended the plans formulated the previous day and advanced with elements of the 11th Motorised Brigade towards Kupres via Zlosela, against positions held by the Kupres Battalion at 1:15p.m. The change of plans enabled elements of the 13th Partisan Brigade to <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> them by 6:00p.m. and caused the attack to fail.|$|E

5|$|Development {{began in}} 1970, when NASA {{released}} {{a request for}} proposal for 'Phase B' main engine concept studies, requiring development of a throttleable, staged combustion, de Laval-type engine. The request {{was based on the}} then-current design of the Space Shuttle which featured two reusable stages, the orbiter and a manned fly-back booster, and required one engine which would be able to power both vehicles via two different nozzles (12 booster engines with 550,000lbf sea level thrust each and 3 orbiter engines with 632,000lbf vacuum thrust each). Rocketdyne, P and Aerojet General were selected to receive funding although, given P's already-advanced development (demonstrating a working 350,000lbf concept engine during the year) and Aerojet General's prior experience in developing the 1,500,000lbf M-1 engine, Rocketdyne was forced to put a large amount of private money into the design process to allow the company to <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> its competitors.|$|E

5|$|Dawn of Mana {{opens on}} the fictional island of Illusia, {{a place where}} the giant Mana Tree lies dormant. Much of the story takes place on Fa'Diel, a {{continent}} composed of the five nations of Jadd, Topple, Ishe, Wendell, and Lorimar. At the start of the game Ritzia, a Maiden in charge of tending to the Tree, and Keldric, her knight and the player-controlled character, have left their village to find Ritzia's missing pet. While they are out, Illusia is attacked by King Stroud of Lorimar. The pair rush to the Tree of Mana, thinking that Stroud intends to attack the legendary beast that lies sleeping underneath its roots. While searching for the beast, Keldric finds a seed of the Tree, which attaches to his arm and can transform into a slingshot, a whip, or a sword. They also find Faye, a spirit child, who can cast magic and joins them. When they reach the center of the labyrinth of roots, Stroud's men <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> them; they had been searching for Ritzia, not the beast. Stroud intends to open a portal to Mavolia, a land of darkness sealed away for centuries, and believes Ritzia is part of the key as a Maiden had been a part of opening the portal before. Stroud leaves with Ritzia to find the rest of the key, and Keldric and Faye chase after them.|$|E
5|$|Jet Force Gemini {{revolves}} around the Jet Force Gemini team attempting to defeat the dark insectoid tyrant Mizar and his horde of drones.

Through morphic fields, she connected to Junpei in the future, witnessing several possible realities and directing Junpei to help him survive. Junpei then faces the same sudoku puzzle Akane did, and relays the solution back to Akane in the past, allowing her to escape with Seven and the other children. Junpei realizes that Akane was Zero and, with assistance from Santa, had recreated the game and all the events she had witnessed in order to ensure her survival and avoid a temporal paradox. As Junpei {{and the others}} escape, they discover that the game had taken place in Building Q the entire time, and that Akane and Santa have fled, leaving behind a car with Ace restrained in the trunk. In the game's epilogue, they drive away hoping to <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> them and, shortly after, pick up a hitchhiker whom Junpei recognizes as Alice.|$|E

5|$|Vissi's music rival Despina Vandi {{also became}} less prominent. While the {{supposed}} rivalry {{between the two}} was once a grand topic in the media, with speculation as to who would come out on top, the possible overexposure {{of the story and}} their subsequent absences allowed fellow laïko-pop singer Elena Paparizou, fresh off of the momentum of her 2005 Eurovision win, to ultimately overshadow the two {{during the second half of}} the decade. While reviewing Apagorevmeno, Haris Simvoulidis of Avopolis felt that Vissi appeared to be attempting to <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> her contemporaries, Paparizou and Peggy Zina. Vissi continued to make music and soon managed to fly back to the top as her follow-up album Apagorevmeno becaume the biggest selling album by a female artist for 2009 and her shows continue to be sold out even today. She was also placed 15th in Forbes list of the most powerful and influential Greece celebrities in 2010. Her time on hiatus in the late 2000s was filmed and used for a reality show called Oso Eho Foni in 2011.|$|E
5|$|Luneth chases Arc to Kazus and, upon reuniting with Arc, {{discovers that}} the {{rumors of a}} curse on Kazus are not false. The people there are see-through, and one such person, Cid of Canaan, instructs the two boys to take his airship and look for Refia, the mythril smith Takka's adoptive daughter. They find her on the airship, and {{accompany}} her to Castle Sasune as per her suggestion. There, they meet Ingus, a soldier of Sasune who has somehow escaped the curse. He joins the trio after an audience with the king, who instructs them to find his daughter, Sara. They <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> her in the Sealed Cave, and with her, battle the monster who cast the curse: the Djinn. Just as Sara seals the Djinn away, however, Luneth, Arc, Refia and Ingus all disappear before her eyes. As it transpires, the wind crystal had summoned the four youths in order to grant them a portion of its power. After this, Luneth's party reunites with Sara at Castle Sasune. She completes the process of dispelling the Djinn's curse, but becomes depressed when Luneth reveals {{that he and his}} companions must leave at once. After Sara stops crying long enough to see them off, they go back to Kazus, where Takka drags Refia home. The three boys consult with Cid, and then Takka, who builds a mythril ram on the ship. It should be noted that Refia is not with him when he returns, and when the party once more finds her aboard Cid's airship, the player would be able to piece together why: she had told Takka that she is a Warrior of Light like the boys, and therefore has to leave. The new introductory sequence ends with the airship being used to demolish the boulder in Nelv Valley.|$|E

Wanting the Bloodstone, which was taken by Michelle, Radu attempts to barter the group's lives in exchange for it. Becky throws it over the roof's edge, and when Radu attempts to follow it he is engulfed in the rays of the Sun. Radu's body bursts into flames and falls from the castle wall. Becky and the group make it to their car and drive off.
