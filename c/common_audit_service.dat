It discusses the introduction and implementation of microcomputers in the Naval <b>Audit</b> <b>Service.</b> It also surveys current software from three sources-commercial, government and public domain. During the software survey, it evaluates the usefulness of that software for Naval <b>Audit</b> <b>Service</b> <b>audit</b> applications. A survey of current audit practices using microcomputers was conducted in public accounting firms, audit departments in industry*, the Naval <b>Audit</b> <b>Service</b> and federal government agencies other than the Naval <b>Audit</b> <b>Service.</b> Finally, this thesis makes recommendations for the implementation and efficient use of microcomputers in the Naval <b>Audit</b> <b>Service.</b> [URL] Naval <b>Audit</b> <b>Service</b> Capital RegionLieutenant Commander, United States Nav...|$|R

40|$|The {{current study}} investigates {{the current status}} of {{external}} <b>audit</b> <b>services</b> in Jordan. In particular, the study comes to evaluate the audit quality attributes and the client satisfaction with <b>audit</b> <b>services</b> in various sectors in Jordan. In addition, the study outlines the possible procedures necessary to enhance the quality of <b>audit</b> <b>services.</b> Furthermore, the study tests the relationship between audit quality attributes and client satisfaction. Based on 48 useable questionnaires, clients see that audit firms have the necessary technical competence, experience and expertise to conduct of audit field work effectively. Thus, findings indicate that clients are satisfied with <b>audit</b> <b>services</b> in Jordan to a considerable extent. A significant, positive relationship has been found between “field work conduct and technical competence ” factor and client satisfaction. No significant relationship has been found between the other two factors (i. e. experience and responsiveness and independence and executive involvement) and client satisfaction with <b>audit</b> <b>services</b> in Jordan. A consensus in the perception of clients from different sectors toward the evaluation of audit quality attributes and satisfaction with <b>audit</b> <b>services</b> has been found. The results indicate that more emphasis should be given to some audit quality attributes (i. e. responsiveness, independence and executive involvement) to enhance the overall satisfaction of clients with <b>audit</b> <b>service</b> in Jordan. In addition, the study findings revealed that providing better training for auditors and compliance with corporate governance code for auditing are important procedures to improve audit quality in Jordan...|$|R

Clients {{no longer have}} physical control of data indicates that they are facing a potentially frightening risk for missing or corrupted data. To keep away from the security risks, <b>audit</b> <b>services</b> are significant {{to make sure that}} the integrity and availability of outsourced data. Provable data possession (PDP), which is a cryptographic technique for verifying the integrity of data without retrieving it at an un trusted server, can be used to recognize <b>audit</b> <b>services.</b> In this we introduced the construction of an well-organized <b>audit</b> <b>service</b> for data integrity in clouds. Profiting from the typical interactive verification system, we projected an interactive audit procedure to implement the <b>audit</b> <b>service</b> based on a third party auditor. In this audit examination, the third party auditor can concern a periodic authentication to check the change of outsourced data by providing an optimized to-do list. To understand the audit model, we only need to preserve the security of the third party auditor and organize an insubstantial daemon to execute the verification protocol. We present an capable method for selecting an optimal parameter value to minimize computational expenditure of cloud <b>audit</b> <b>services.</b> Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach...|$|R

We find that in the Australian market for <b>audit</b> <b>services,</b> the fee premium attributed to industry specialist audit firms is concentrated in the audit fees paid by the largest clients in each industry. One reason for higher fees paid by larger clients is the demand for additional <b>audit</b> <b>services.</b> We find higher fees for companies cross-listed on US exchanges. We also find that fee premiums to auditors that are city-industry leaders are strongly related to client size. 24 page(s...|$|R

Motivated by the significance of auditing and perceptions of audit quality in enhancing the reliability and credibility of financial statements, this article investigates the relative importance of audit team and audit firm attributes in perceptions of audit quality by users of <b>audit</b> <b>services.</b> Data are gathered from 81 users of <b>audit</b> <b>services</b> and analysed using adaptive conjoint analysis in order to measure the relative importance of audit team and audit firm attributes in perceptions of audit quality. The results show that, in general, users of <b>audit</b> <b>services</b> perceive <b>audit</b> team attributes as being relatively more important than audit firm attributes in perceptions of audit quality. The findings of the study have implications for regulators and the accounting profession concerned with improving confidence in corporate governance and the effectiveness and integrity of the audit process, and for audit firms in monitoring and promoting the quality of their <b>audit</b> <b>services.</b> 13 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this thesis is, firstly, to {{investigate}} clients’ perspective toward the Big 4 ’s financial <b>audit</b> <b>service</b> quality. Secondly, the gaps between clients’ perceptions and expectations of <b>audit</b> <b>service</b> quality provided by the Big 4 audit firms will be studied. Finally, factors influencing clients’ expectations of <b>audit</b> <b>service</b> quality will be categorised. Method A combination of qualitative and quantitative approach {{is used in the}} form of a web-based self-completion questionnaire. A qualitative approach is used in one section of the questionnaire which is an open-ended question asking about the clients’ perception toward <b>audit</b> <b>service</b> quality. A quantitative approach is used in the rest of the 2 sections of the questionnaire; firstly, asking the respondents to score the level of perception and expectation of <b>audit</b> <b>service</b> quality; secondly, asking for types of clients’ industries. The respondents are 25 clients who have direct experience with the Big 4 audit firms located in Thailand. Finding  Clients strongly expect assurance, reliability, and responsiveness while strongly perceive assurance and reliability of the Big 4 ’s <b>audit</b> <b>service</b> quality. However, it is obvious that clients’ perception of all 5 dimensions is less than those of expectation; assurance, reliability and responsiveness are significantly different at. 05 level. Moreover, eight factors from given expectation score are re-categorised in order from the most important issue to the least important as follows; Factor 1 : Trust & Confidence, Factor 2 : Responsiveness & Accuracy, Factor 3 : Knowledge and skills in clients’ industry, Caring and Independence, Factor 4 : Understanding of Clients, Factor 5 : Timing/Scheduling & Right Service, Factor 6 : Physical Facilities, Factor 7 : Professional appearance & Professional Procedures, and Factor 8 : Information & Communication Channels and Materials. Conclusion  In conclusion, the factors that are not satisfied by the clients; assurance, reliability, responsiveness, should be taken account of by the Big 4. Not only the Big 4 operating in Thailand have to be aware of their service quality, the other audit firms both international brands and local brands should also be aware of their service quality in order to satisfy their clients and to avoid damages of the firms and markets from audit failure. Both the audit firms and the clients together can help in audit quality improvement. Recommendation  To improve <b>audit</b> <b>service</b> quality, it is not only the Big 4 audit firms’ responsibility but also the good cooperation from the clients could be the crucial support, and the ongoing policies are needed because it takes some time to see the consequences. When the quality level of <b>audit</b> <b>service</b> becomes a win-win situation, both audit firms and clients receive mutual benefits. Moreover, the Big 4 are the big actors in the audit industry in Thailand with promptly financial and human resource, they should support non-Big 4 to improve <b>audit</b> <b>service</b> quality. Because it means the overall image of <b>audit</b> <b>service</b> in Thailand would be improve somehow...|$|R
