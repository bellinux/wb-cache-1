50|$|Construction {{depends on}} the {{material}} used. When steel or aluminium is used this involves welding of the plates and profiles after rolling, marking, <b>cutting</b> <b>and</b> <b>bending</b> as per the structural design drawings or models, followed by erection and launching. Other joining techniques are used for other materials like fibre reinforced plastic and glass-reinforced plastic.The process of construction is thought-out cautiously while considering all factors like safety, strength of structure, hydrodynamics, and ship arrangement. Each factor considered presents a new option for materials to consider as well as ship orientation. When {{the strength of the}} structure is considered the acts of ship collision are considered {{in the way that the}} ships structure is altered. Therefore, the properties of materials are considered carefully as applied material on the struck ship has elastic properties, the energy absorbed by the ship being struck is then deflected in the opposite direction, so both ships go through the process of rebounding to prevent further damage.|$|R
