40|$|Inbreeding may impair an individual's immune system, {{render it}} more {{susceptible}} to disease and hence contribute to the extinction risk of small and isolated populations, as often found on islands. So far, surprisingly few studies have assessed the effects of inbreeding on immunocompetence in wild populations. Using 26 microsatellite loci and genetic data from museum specimens and contemporary samples, we calculated short-term and long-term inbreeding in 13 different mockingbird populations covering the range of all 4 species in the Galapagos Islands and compared them with three different measures of innate immunity and ectoparasite load. We found no significant effect of either measure of inbreeding on natural antibody or <b>complement</b> <b>enzyme</b> titres, heterophil-lymphocyte ratio or feather louse abundance. Hence, our results do not support a link between inbreeding and immunocompetence. However, overall statistical power and repeatabilities of antibody and <b>complement</b> <b>enzyme</b> titres were low. Nevertheless, generally, natural antibody titres were high suggesting that the mockingbirds may be equipped with a strong first line of defence, as found in other island species...|$|E
40|$|Addition of {{isolated}} B 3 b to murine lymph node cell cultures induced increased DNA synthesis. The stimulation {{is dependent on}} the dose of C 3 b added and is potentiated by fetal calf serum present in the medium. Isolated C 3 is less stimulatory than C 3 b; C 3 a and C 3 c had no effect on DNA synthesis in these cultures. 10 - 20 % large immunoglobulin containing blastlike cells developed in lymph node cell cultures stimulated by 50 mug C 3 b in the presence of 3 % fetal calf serum. The stimulation by C 3 b was observed in cultures of lymph node and spleen cells of several mouse strains including C 3 H/HeJ and congenitally thymus-deficient (nu/nu) mice. The results suggest that B lymphocytes are the main target of the stimulatory effect of C 3 b. Two mechanisms which may be involved in the stimulation of lymphocytes by C 3 b are discussed: (a) cross-linking of receptors on the cell surface or between cells, and (b) the binding of C 3 b to receptors of B lymphocytes and the formation of the <b>complement</b> <b>enzyme</b> C 3 bB. The results are compatible with the suggestion that activation of C 3 is part of the events triggering the B lymphocytes...|$|E
40|$|Decay-accelerating factor (DAF) is a 70 kD {{membrane}} {{regulatory protein}} that prevents the activation of autologous complement on cell surfaces. Using immunohistochemical methods and a radioimmunometric assay based on mAbs to DAF, we found {{large amounts of}} membrane-associated DAF antigen on the epithelial surface of cornea, conjunctiva, oral and gastrointestinal mucosa, exocrine glands, renal tubules, ureter and bladder, cervical and uterine mucosa, and pleural, pericardial and synovial serosa. Additionally, we detected soluble DAF antigen in plasma, tears, saliva, and urine, {{as well as in}} synovial and cerebrospinal fluids. While plasma, tear, and saliva DAF are larger than erythrocyte (Ehu) membrane DAF by Western blot analysis, urine DAF is slightly smaller (67, 000) in Mr. Unlike purified Ehu DAF, however, urine DAF is unable to incorporate into the membrane of red cells. Although its inhibitory activity on the <b>complement</b> <b>enzyme</b> C 3 -convertase is lower than that of Ehu DAF, it is comparable to that of serum C 4 binding protein (C 4 bp). Biosynthetic studies using cultured foreskin epithelium and Hela cells disclosed DAF levels (approximately 2 X 10 (5) molecules/cell) exceeding those on blood cells. In addition, these studies revealed the synthesis of two DAF species, one with apparent Mr corresponding to that of epithelial cell membrane DAF and the other to urine DAF, suggesting that the urine DAF variant arises from adjacent epithelium. The function of DAF in body fluids is unknown, but the observation that urine DAF has C 4 bp-(or factor H-) like activity shows that it could inhibit the fluid phase activation of the cascade...|$|E

40|$|By using {{synthetic}} oligonucleotides as probes, plasmid clones containing {{portions of}} cDNA coding for human C 4 b-binding protein were isolated from a liver cDNA library. The entire {{amino acid sequence}} of the C 4 b-binding protein can be predicted from this study of the cloned cDNA when allied to a previous sequence study at the protein level [Chung, Gagnon & Reid (1985) Mol. Immunol. 22, 427 - 435], in which over 55 % of the amino acid sequence, including the N-terminal 62 residues, was obtained. The plasmid clones isolated allowed the unambiguous determination of 1717 nucleotides of cDNA sequence between the codon for the 32 nd amino acid in the sequence of C 4 b-binding protein and the 164 th nucleotide in the 3 ' non-translated region. The sequence {{studies show that the}} secreted form of C 4 b-binding protein, found in plasma, is composed of chains of apparent Mr 70 000 that contains 549 amino acid residues. Examination of the protein and cDNA sequence results show that {{there are at least two}} polymorphic sites in the molecule. One is at position 44, which can be glutamine or threonine, and the other is at position 309, which can be tyrosine or histidine. Northern-blot analysis indicated that the mRNA for C 4 b-binding protein is approx. 2. 5 kilobases long. The N-terminal 491 amino acids of C 4 b-binding protein can be divided into eight internal homologous regions, each approx. 60 amino acids long, which can be aligned by the presence in each region of four half-cystine, one tryptophan and several other conserved residues.

40|$|This {{paper will}} discuss the {{development}} of a novel biomedical detection device that will be used to detect microorganisms with the use of infrared fluorochrome polymers attached to antibodies in fluids such as water. The fluorochrome polymers emit light in the near inferred region (NIR), approximately 805 nm, when excited by an NIR laser at 778 nm. The device could remarkably change the way laboratory testing is done today. The testing process is usually performed on a time scale of days while our device will be able to detect microorganisms in minutes. This type of time efficient analysis is ideal for use aboard the International Space Station and the Space Shuttle (ISS/SS) and has many useful commercial applications, for instance at a water treatment plant and food processing plants. With more research and experimentation the testing might also one day be used to detect bacteria and viruses in complex fluids such as blood, which would revolutionize blood analysis as it is performed today. My contribution to the project has been to develop a process which will allow an antibody/fluorescent dye pair to be conjugated to a specific bacteria or virus and than to to be separated from a sample body of water for detection. The antibody being used in this experiment is anti beta galactosidase and its <b>complement</b> <b>enzyme</b> is beta galactosidase, a non harmful derivative of E. Coli. The anti beta galactosidase has been conjugated to the fluorochrome polymer, IRDye 800, which emits at approximately 806 nm. The dye when excited by the NIR laser emits a signal which is detected by a spectrometer and then is read by state of the art computer software. The state-of-the-art process includes incubating the anti beta galactosidase and beta galactosidase in a phosphate buffer solution in a test tube, allowing the antibody to bind to specific sites on the enzyme. After the antibody is bound to the enzyme, it is centrifuged in specific filters that will allow free antibody to wash away and leave the antibody-enzyme complexes on top in solution for testing and analysis. This solution is pipetted into a cuvette, a special plastic test tube, which will then be excited by the laser. The signal read will tell US that an antibody is present and since it is bound to the enzyme, that the bacteria is also present...|$|E

40|$|MASP- 1 is a {{versatile}} serine protease that cleaves {{a number of}} substrates in human blood. In recent years it became evident that besides playing {{a crucial role in}} complement activation MASP- 1 also triggers other cascade systems and even cells to mount a more powerful innate immune response. In this review we summarize the latest discoveries about the diverse functions of this multi-faceted protease. Recent studies revealed that among MBL-associated serine proteases, MASP- 1 is the one responsible for triggering the lectin pathway via its ability to rapidly autoactivate then cleave MASP- 2, and possibly MASP- 3. The crystal structure of MASP- 1 explains its more relaxed substrate specificity compared to the related <b>complement</b> <b>enzymes.</b> Due to the relaxed specificity, MASP- 1 interacts with the coagulation cascade and the kinin generating system, and it can also activate endothelial cells eliciting pro-inflammatory signaling. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

VCP modulates the inflammatory response and protects viral habitat by inhibiting the classical and the alternative pathways of complement activation. The extended structure of VCP, mobility between its sequential domains, charge distribution and type of residues at the binding regions are factors that have been identified to influence its ability to bind to complement proteins. We report that a Lister strain of vaccinia virus encodes a VCP homolog (Lis VCP) that is functional, glycosylated, has two amino acids less than the well-characterized VCP from vaccinia virus WR strain (WR VCP), and the human smallpox inhibitor of <b>complement</b> <b>enzymes</b> (SPICE) from variola virus. The glycosylated VCP of Lister is immunogenic in contrast to the weak immunogenicity of the nonglycosylated VCP. Lis VCP is the only orthopoxviral VCP homolog found to be glycosylated, and we speculate that glycosylation influences its pattern of complement inhibition. We also correlate dimerization of VCP observed only in mammalian and baculovirus expression systems to higher levels of activity than monomers, observed in the yeast expression system.|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} great {{interest}} in understanding the methods by which collagen-based load-bearing tissue is constructed, grown and maintained in vertebrate animals. To date, the responsibility for this process has largely been placed with mesenchymal fibroblastic cells that are thought to fully control the morphology of load-bearing extracellular matrix (ECM). However, given clear limitations {{in the ability of}} fibroblastic cells to precisely place or remove single collagen molecules to sculpt tissue, we have hypothesized that the material itself must {{play a critical role in}} the determination of the form of structural ECM. We here demonstrate directly, using live, dynamic, differential interference contrast imaging, that mechanically strained networks of collagen fibrils, exposed to collagenase (Clostridium histolyticum), degrade preferentially. Specifically, unstrained fibrils are removed ‘quickly’, while strained fibrils persist significantly longer. The demonstration supports the idea that collagen networks are mechanosensitive in that they are stabilized by mechanical strain. Thus, collagen molecules (together with their <b>complement</b> <b>enzymes)</b> may comprise the basis of a smart, load-adaptive, structural material system. This concept has the potential to drastically simplify the assumed role of the fibroblast, which would need only to provide ECM molecules and mechanical force to sculpt collagenous tissue...|$|R

This established that PIIB was an intermediate on the pathway to PIIA. In addition, in vitro studies with cell-free protein preparations demonstrated that the oxidation of PIIB to PIIA is a complex process requiring NADH, riboflavin 5 '-phosphate (FMN), and molecular oxygen. Two enzymes were shown to be necessary to catalyze this reaction. Both were purified to homogeneity from S. pristinaespiralis by a coupled enzyme assay based on the formation of PIIA and by requiring addition of the <b>complementing</b> <b>enzyme.</b> One enzyme was purified about 3, 000 -fold by a procedure including a decisive affinity chromatography step on FMN-agarose.

The latter was purified only 160 -fold and was called PIIA synthase. Our data strongly suggest that this enzyme catalyzes a transient hydroxylation of PIIB by molecular oxygen immediately followed by a dehydration leading to PIIA. The native PIIA synthase consists of two different subunits with Mrs of around 50, 000 and 35, 000, as estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, while the FMN reductase seems to be a monomer with a Mr of around 28, 000 and containing one molecule of tightly bound FMN.

Human MPXV {{infection}} results in a disease {{that is similar to}} smallpox and can also be fatal. Two clades of MPXV have been identified, with viruses of the central African clade displaying more pathogenic properties than those within the west African clade. The monkeypox inhibitor of <b>complement</b> <b>enzymes</b> (MOPICE), which is not expressed by viruses of the west African clade, has been hypothesized to be a main virulence factor responsible for increased pathogenic properties of central African strains of MPXV.

Data presented here demonstrate that infection of RM with MPXV leads to significant viral replication in the peripheral blood and lungs and results in the induction of a robust and sustained adaptive immune response against the virus. More importantly, we show that the loss of MOPICE expression results in enhanced viral replication in vivo, as well as a dampened adaptive immune response against MPXV. Taken together, these findings suggest that MOPICE modulates the anti-MPXV immune response and that this protein is not the sole virulence factor of the central African clade of MPXV...|$|R

Similar to the human pathogen variola virus, ectromelia virus has a limited host range and provides a mouse model where the virus and the host's immune response have coevolved. We previously demonstrated that multiple components (C 3, C 4, and factor B) of the classical and alternative pathways are required to survive ectromelia virus infection. Complement's role in the innate and adaptive immune responses likely drove {{the evolution of a}} virus-encoded virulence factor that regulates complement activation. In this study, we characterized the ectromelia virus inhibitor of <b>complement</b> <b>enzymes</b> (EMICE). Recombinant EMICE regulated complement activation on the surface of CHO cells, and it protected complement-sensitive intracellular mature virions (IMV) from neutralization in vitro. It accomplished this by serving as a cofactor for the inactivation of C 3 b and C 4 b and by dissociating the catalytic domain of the classical pathway C 3 convertase. Infected murine cells initiated synthesis of EMICE within 4 to 6 h postinoculation. The levels were sufficient in the supernatant to protect the IMV, upon release, from complement-mediated neutralization. EMICE on the surface of infected murine cells also reduced complement activation by the alternative pathway. In contrast, classical pathway activation by high-titer antibody overwhelmed EMICE's regulatory capacity. These results suggest that EMICE's role is early during infection when it counteracts the innate immune response. In summary, ectromelia virus produced EMICE within a few hours of an infection, and EMICE in turn decreased complement activation on IMV and infected cells...|$|R

Variola causes the contagious disease smallpox, which has a 30 – 40 % mortality rate. Conversely, the prototype orthopoxvirus, vaccinia, causes no disease in immunocompetent humans and {{was used in the}} global eradication of smallpox, which ended in 1977. However, the threat of smallpox persists because clandestine stockpiles of variola still exist. Although variola and vaccinia share remarkable DNA homology, the strict human tropism of variola suggests that its proteins are better suited than those of vaccinia to overcome the human immune response. Here, we demonstrate the functional advantage of a variola complement regulatory protein over that of its vaccinia homologue. Because authentic variola proteins are not available for study, we molecularly engineered and characterized the smallpox inhibitor of <b>complement</b> <b>enzymes</b> (SPICE), a homologue of a vaccinia virulence factor, vaccinia virus complement control protein (VCP). SPICE is nearly 100 -fold more potent than VCP at inactivating human C 3 b and 6 -fold more potent at inactivating C 4 b. SPICE is also more human complement-specific than is VCP. By inactivating complement components, SPICE serves to inhibit the formation of the C 3 /C 5 convertases necessary for complement-mediated viral clearance. SPICE provides the first evidence that variola proteins are particularly adept at overcoming human immunity, and the decreased function of VCP suggests one reason why the vaccinia virus vaccine was associated with relatively low mortality.

Therefore, we investigated inhibition of two central innate immune pathways, those of complement and CD 14 /Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR 4) /myeloid differentiation protein 2 (MD- 2), in a porcine in vitro model of Escherichia coli-induced inflammation. Porcine whole blood anticoagulated with lepuridin, which did {{not interfere with the}} complement system, was incubated with E. coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or whole bacteria. Inhibitors of complement and CD 14 and thus the LPS CD 14 /TLR 4 /MD- 2 receptor complex were tested to investigate the effect on the inflammatory response. A broad range of inflammatory readouts were used to monitor the effect. Anti-CD 14 was found to saturate the CD 14 molecule on granulocytes and completely inhibited LPS-induced proinflammatory cytokines in a dose-dependent manner. Anti-CD 14 significantly reduced the levels of the E. coli-induced proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL- 1 β, but not IL- 8, in a dose-dependent manner. No effect on bacterial clearance was seen. Vaccinia complement control protein and smallpox inhibitor of <b>complement</b> <b>enzymes,</b> two Orthopoxvirus-encoded <b>complement</b> inhibitors, completely inhibited complement activation. Furthermore, these agents almost completely inhibited the expression of wCD 11 R 3, which is associated with CD 18 as a β 2 integrin, on porcine granulocytes and decreased IL- 8 levels significantly in a dose-dependent manner. As expected, complement inhibition reduced bacterial clearance. We conclude that inhibition of complement and CD 14 attenuates E. coli-induced inflammation and might be used as a therapeutic regimen in gram-negative sepsis along with appropriate treatment with antibiotics...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In {{recent years}} it has become evident that {{functional}} RNAs in living organisms are not just curious remnants from a primoridal RNA world but an ubiquitous phenomenon <b>complementing</b> protein <b>enzyme</b> based activity. Functional RNAs, just like proteins, depend in many cases upon their well-defined and evolutionarily conserved three-dimensional structure. In contrast to protein folds, however, RNA molecules have a biophysically important coarse-grained representation: their secondary structure. At this level of resolution at least, RNA structures can be efficiently predicted given only the sequence information. As a consequence, computational studies of RNA routinely incorporate structural information explicitly. RNA secondary structure prediction has proven useful in diverse fields ranging from theoretical models of sequence evolution and biopolymer folding, to genome analysis and even the design biotechnologically or pharmaceutically useful molecules...|$|R

On the other hand, there is mounting evidence that biochemical aspects, such as similarities among catalyzed reactions and their coupling in pathways influences the evolutionary patterns of the many gene families that encode metabolic enzymes [76, 77].|$|R
50|$|Blood {{proteins}}, also termed plasma proteins or serum proteins, are proteins {{present in}} blood plasma. They serve many different functions, including transport of lipids, hormones, {{vitamins and minerals}} in the circulatory system and the regulation of acellular activity and functioning of the immune system. Other blood proteins act as <b>enzymes,</b> <b>complement</b> components, protease inhibitors or kinin precursors. Contrary to popular belief, hemoglobin is not a blood protein, as it is carried within red blood cells, {{rather than in the}} blood serum.|$|R

Enzymes produced by these bacteria provide nutrients for growth, participate in the pathogenesis of infections involving these bacteria, modify the localenvironmentso that it is suitable for growth, and alter nonnutrients in the im-mediate vicinity of the bacterial cell. Metabolism of compounds in the gastrointestinal tract by enzymes produced by gram-negative anaerobes may haveappreciableeffectson the absorption, distribution, and excretion of these compounds as well as on their biologic properties. Knowledge of the enzymes produced by anaerobes is important for understanding and possibly modulating·interactions between these bacteria and the host. The specific <b>complement</b> of <b>enzymes</b> produced by a microorganism determines its metabolic poten-tial and can be used to differentiate it from other organisms. These enzymes serve a variety of func-tions, including provision of nutrients for metabo...|$|R
40|$|Structural {{reorganisation}} {{of cellulose}} fibrils in hydrothermally deconstructed lignocellulosic biomass and relationships with enzyme digestibility Roger Ibbett *, Sanyasi Gaddipati, Sandra Hill and Greg Tucker Background: The investigation of structural organisation in lignocellulose materials {{is important to}} understand changes in cellulase accessibility and reactivity resulting from hydrothermal deconstruction, to allow development of strategies to maximise bioethanol process efficiencies. To achieve progress, wheat straw lignocellulose and comparative model wood cellulose were characterised following increasing severity of hydrothermal treatment. Powder and fibre wide-angle X-ray diffraction techniques were employed (WAXD), <b>complemented</b> by <b>enzyme</b> kinetic measurements up to high conversion. Results: Evidence from WAXD indicated that cellulose fibrils are not perfectly crystalline. A reduction in fibril crystallinity occurred due to hydrothermal treatment, although dimensional and orientational data showed that fibril coherency and alignment were largely retained. The hypothetical inter-fibril spacing created by hydrotherma...|$|R

To avoid nonspecific hemagglutination, cells were fixed with glutaraldehyde or Formalin directly in whole blood. The lyophilized, CMV-sensitized erythrocytes obtained by this technique were stable up to 9 months at 37 degrees C and retained the same reactivity at fresh, CMV-sensitized cells.
