5|$|The {{adrenal gland}} secretes a basal level of <b>cortisol</b> {{but can also}} produce bursts of the hormone in {{response}} to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from the anterior pituitary. <b>Cortisol</b> is not evenly released during the day – its concentrations in the blood are highest {{in the early morning}} and lowest in the evening {{as a result of the}} circadian rhythm of ACTH secretion. Cortisone is an inactive product of the action of the enzyme 11β-HSD on <b>cortisol.</b> The reaction catalyzed by 11β-HSD is reversible, which means that it can turn administered cortisone into <b>cortisol,</b> the biologically active hormone.|$|E
5|$|Treatment for acute adrenal {{insufficiency}} requires the administration of intravenous saline or dextrose solution; volumes of over two liters may be required in an adult. This {{is followed by the}} administration of hydrocortisone, which is pharmaceutical grade <b>cortisol,</b> intravenously or into a muscle. The drug dexamethasone has similar properties, but its use is not recommended unless it is required to reduce swelling in the brain around the area of hemorrhage. Some are well enough not to require immediate <b>cortisol</b> replacement; in this case, blood levels of <b>cortisol</b> are determined at 9:00AM (as <b>cortisol</b> levels vary over the day). A level below 550nmol/l indicates a need for replacement.|$|E
5|$|Glucocorticoids such as <b>cortisol</b> {{influence}} metabolism {{rates of}} proteins, fats and sugars ("glucose").|$|E
5|$|<b>Cortisol</b> is {{the main}} {{glucocorticoid}} in humans. In species that do not create <b>cortisol,</b> this role is played by corticosterone instead. Glucocorticoids have many effects on metabolism. As their name suggests, they increase the circulating level of glucose. This {{is the result of}} an increase in the mobilization of amino acids from protein and the stimulation of synthesis of glucose from these amino acids in the liver. In addition, they increase the levels of free fatty acids, which cells can use as an alternative to glucose to obtain energy. Glucocorticoids also have effects unrelated to the regulation of blood sugar levels, including the suppression of the immune system and a potent anti-inflammatory effect. <b>Cortisol</b> reduces the capacity of osteoblasts to produce new bone tissue and decreases the absorption of calcium in the gastrointestinal tract.|$|E
5|$|The first {{priority}} in suspected or confirmed pituitary apoplexy is stabilization of the circulatory system. <b>Cortisol</b> deficiency can cause severe low blood pressure. Depending on {{the severity of}} the illness, admission to a high dependency unit (HDU) may be required.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{endocrine}} diseases involve dysfunctions of the adrenal gland. Overproduction of <b>cortisol</b> leads to Cushing's syndrome, whereas insufficient production {{is associated with}} Addison's disease. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia is a genetic disease produced by dysregulation of endocrine control mechanisms. A variety of tumors can arise from adrenal tissue and are commonly found in medical imaging when searching for other diseases.|$|E
5|$|Congenital adrenal {{hyperplasia}} is a congenital {{disease in}} which mutations of enzymes that produce steroid hormones {{result in a}} glucocorticoid deficiency and malfunction of the negative feedback loop of the HPA axis. In the HPA axis, <b>cortisol</b> (a glucocorticoid) inhibits the release of CRH and ACTH, hormones that in turn stimulate corticosteroid synthesis. As <b>cortisol</b> cannot be synthesized, these hormones are released in high quantities and stimulate production of other adrenal steroids instead. The {{most common form of}} congenital adrenal hyperplasia is due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency. 21-hydroxylase is necessary for production of both mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids, but not androgens. Therefore, ACTH stimulation of the adrenal cortex induces the release of excessive amounts of adrenal androgens, which can lead to the development of ambiguous genitalia and secondary sex characteristics.|$|E
5|$|On April 5, 1952, {{biochemist}} Durey Peterson and microbiologist Herbert Murray at Upjohn {{published the}} first report of a fermentation process for the microbial 11α-oxygenation of steroids in a single step (by common molds of the order Mucorales). Their fermentation process could produce 11α-hydroxyprogesterone or 11α-hydroxycortisone from progesterone or Compound S, respectively, which could then by further chemical steps be converted to cortisone or 11β-hydroxycortisone (<b>cortisol).</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{adrenal glands}} (also known as suprarenal glands) are {{endocrine}} glands that produce {{a variety of}} hormones including adrenaline and the steroids aldosterone and <b>cortisol.</b> They are found above the kidneys. Each gland has an outer cortex which produces steroid hormones and an inner medulla. The adrenal cortex itself {{is divided into three}} zones: zona glomerulosa, the zona fasciculata and the zona reticularis.|$|E
5|$|The zona fasciculata is {{situated}} between the zona glomerulosa and zona reticularis. Cells in this layer {{are responsible for}} producing glucocorticoids such as <b>cortisol.</b> It is {{the largest of the}} three layers, accounting for nearly 80% of the volume of the cortex. In the zona fasciculata, cells are arranged in columns radially oriented towards the medulla. Cells contain numerous lipid droplets, abundant mitochondria and a complex smooth endoplasmic reticulum.|$|E
5|$|Adult female rabbit fleas, Spilopsyllus cuniculi, {{can detect}} the {{changing}} levels of <b>cortisol</b> and corticosterone hormones in the rabbit's blood that indicate {{it is getting}} close to giving birth. This triggers sexual maturity in the fleas and they start producing eggs. As soon as the baby rabbits are born, the fleas make their way down to them and once on board they start feeding, mating, and laying eggs. After 12 days, the adult fleas make {{their way back to}} the mother. They complete this mini-migration every time she gives birth.|$|E
5|$|Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) {{deficiency}} {{leads to}} the syndrome of diabetes insipidus (unrelated to diabetes mellitus): inability to concentrate the urine, leading to polyuria (production of large amounts of clear urine) that is low in solutes, dehydration and—in compensation—extreme thirst and constant need to drink (polydipsia), as well as hypernatremia (high sodium levels in the blood). ADH deficiency may be masked if there is ACTH deficiency, with symptoms only appearing when <b>cortisol</b> has been replaced.|$|E
5|$|Certain non-inhibitory serpins {{also use}} the serpin {{conformational}} change {{as part of their}} function. For example, the native (S) form of thyroxine-binding globulin has high affinity for thyroxine, whereas the cleaved (R) form has low affinity. Similarly, transcortin has higher affinity for <b>cortisol</b> when in its native (S) state, than its cleaved (R) state. Thus, in these serpins, RCL cleavage and the S to R transition has been commandeered to allow for ligand release, rather than protease inhibition.|$|E
5|$|Cushing's {{syndrome}} is {{the manifestation of}} glucocorticoid excess. It can {{be the result of}} a prolonged treatment with glucocorticoids or be caused by an underlying disease which produces alterations in the HPA axis or the production of <b>cortisol.</b> Causes can be further classified into ACTH-dependent or ACTH-independent. The most common cause of endogenous Cushing's {{syndrome is}} a pituitary adenoma which causes an excessive production of ACTH. The disease produces a wide variety of signs and symptoms which include obesity, diabetes, increased blood pressure, excessive body hair (hirsutism), osteoporosis, depression and, most distinctively, stretch marks in the skin, caused by its progressive thinning.|$|E
5|$|Hyponatremia, {{an unusually}} {{low level of}} sodium in the blood that may cause {{confusion}} and seizures, is found in 40% of cases. This {{may be caused by}} low <b>cortisol</b> levels or by inappropriate release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) from the posterior pituitary. Several other hormonal deficiencies may develop in the subacute phase. 50% have a deficiency in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), leading to undersecretion of thyroid hormone by the thyroid gland and characteristic symptoms such as fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance. 75% develop a deficiency to gonadotropins (LH and FSH), which control the reproductive hormone glands. This leads to a disrupted menstrual cycle, infertility and decreased libido.|$|E
5|$|If morning <b>cortisol</b> {{levels are}} over 500nmol/l, ACTH {{deficiency}} is unlikely, whereas a level less than 100 is indicative. Levels between 100-500 require a stimulation test. This, too, {{is done with}} the insulin tolerance test. A <b>cortisol</b> level above 500 after achieving a low blood sugar rules out ACTH deficiency, while lower levels confirm the diagnosis. A similar stimulation test using corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) is not sensitive enough {{for the purposes of}} the investigation. If the insulin tolerance test yields an abnormal result, a further test measuring the response of the adrenal glands to synthetic ACTH (the ACTH stimulation test) can be performed to confirm the diagnosis. Stimulation testing with metyrapone is an alternative. Some suggest that an ACTH stimulation test is sufficient as first-line investigation, and that an insulin tolerance test is only needed if the ACTH test is equivocal. The insulin tolerance test is discouraged in children. None of the tests for ACTH deficiency are perfect, and further tests after a period of time may be needed if initial results are not conclusive.|$|E
5|$|Non-inhibitory {{extracellular}} serpins also {{perform a}} wide array of important roles. Thyroxine-binding globulin and transcortin transport the hormones thyroxine and <b>cortisol,</b> respectively. The non-inhibitory serpin ovalbumin is the most abundant protein in egg white. Its exact function is unknown, but it is thought to be a storage protein for the developing foetus. Heat shock serpin 47 is a chaperone, essential for proper folding of collagen. It acts by stabilising collagen's triple helix whilst it is being processed in the endoplasmic reticulum.|$|E
25|$|Cortisone has {{marginally}} reduced glucocorticoid activity {{compared to}} <b>cortisol</b> (80-90%), and thus, cortisone {{can be considered}} an active metabolite of <b>cortisol.</b> However, 11-beta-steroid dehydrogenase can catalyze the reverse reaction as well, and, thus, cortisone is also a precursor molecule of <b>cortisol.</b> Cortisone is activated through hydrogenation of the 11-keto-group, and <b>cortisol</b> is, thus, {{sometimes referred to as}} hydrocortisone.|$|E
25|$|Normal <b>cortisol</b> level can be {{explained}} by the strong negative feedback mechanism of <b>cortisol</b> on hypothalamus-pituitary axis system. That is, in the beginning, 17,20-lyase deficiency will block synthesis of sex steroid hormones, forcing the pathways to produce more <b>cortisol.</b> However, the initial excess of <b>cortisol</b> is rapidly corrected by negative feedback mechanism—high <b>cortisol</b> decreases secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from zona fasciculata of adrenal gland. Thus, there is no mineralocorticoid overproduction. Also, there is no adrenal hyperplasia.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cortisol</b> {{promotes}} sodium absorption {{through the}} small intestine of mammals. Sodium depletion, however, does not affect <b>cortisol</b> levels so <b>cortisol</b> cannot be used to regulate serum sodium. Cortisol's original purpose may have been sodium transport. This hypothesis {{is supported by the}} fact that freshwater fish use <b>cortisol</b> to stimulate sodium inward, while saltwater fish have a cortisol-based system for expelling excess sodium.|$|E
25|$|Elevated {{levels of}} <b>cortisol,</b> if prolonged, {{can lead to}} {{proteolysis}} (breakdown of proteins) and muscle wasting. Several {{studies have shown that}} <b>cortisol</b> can have a lipolytic effect (promote the breakdown of fat). Under some conditions, however, <b>cortisol</b> may somewhat suppress lipolysis.|$|E
25|$|Normally, {{the highest}} <b>cortisol</b> {{secretion}} {{happens in the}} second half of the night with peak <b>cortisol</b> production occurring in the early morning. Following this, <b>cortisol</b> levels decline throughout the day with lowest levels during the ﬁrst half of the night. <b>Cortisol</b> awakening response is independent of this circadian variation in HPA axis activity; it is superimposed upon the daily rhythm of HPA axis activity; and it seems to be linked specifically to the event of awakening.|$|E
25|$|Elevated {{levels of}} total <b>cortisol</b> {{can also be}} due to {{estrogen}} found in oral contraceptive pills that contain a mixture of estrogen and progesterone, leading to Pseudo-Cushing's syndrome. Estrogen can cause an increase of cortisol-binding globulin and thereby cause the total <b>cortisol</b> level to be elevated. However, the total free <b>cortisol,</b> which is the active hormone in the body, as measured by a 24-hour urine collection for urinary free <b>cortisol,</b> is normal.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cortisol</b> {{raises the}} {{free amino acids}} in the serum by {{inhibiting}} collagen formation, decreasing amino acid uptake by muscle, and inhibiting protein synthesis. <b>Cortisol</b> (as opticortinol) may inversely inhibit IgA precursor cells in the intestines of calves. <b>Cortisol</b> also inhibits IgA in serum, as it does IgM; however, it is not shown to inhibit IgE.|$|E
25|$|Cushing's {{syndrome}} (a {{condition in}} which the body contains excess amounts of <b>cortisol)</b> may also influence childhood obesity. Researchers analyzed two isoforms (proteins that have the same purpose as other proteins, but are programmed by different genes) in the cells of 16 adults undergoing abdominal surgery. They discovered that one type of isoform created oxo-reductase activity (the alteration of cortisone to <b>cortisol)</b> and this activity increased 127.5 pmol mg sup when the other type of isoform was treated with <b>cortisol</b> and insulin. The activity of the <b>cortisol</b> and insulin can possibly activate Cushing's syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Glucocorticoids are {{released}} by the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis in response to stress, of which <b>cortisol</b> is the most prominent in humans. Results in adults suggest that reduced levels of <b>cortisol,</b> linked to lower fear or a reduced stress response, {{can be associated with}} more aggression. However, it may be that proactive aggression is associated with low <b>cortisol</b> levels while reactive aggression may be accompanied by elevated levels. Differences in assessments of <b>cortisol</b> may also explain a diversity of results, particularly in children.|$|E
25|$|Shortly after awakening, a sharp 38–75% (average 50%) {{increase}} {{occurs in}} the blood level of <b>cortisol</b> in about 77% of healthy adults, and it occurs in people of all ages. The average level of salivary <b>cortisol</b> upon waking is roughly 15nmol/l; 30minutes later it may be 23nmol/l, though there are wide variations. The <b>cortisol</b> awakening response reaches a maximum approximately 30minutes after awakening though it may still be heightened by 34% an hour after waking. The pattern of this response to waking is relatively stable for any individual. Twin studies show its pattern is largely genetically determined since there is a heritability of 0.40 for the mean <b>cortisol</b> increase after awakening and 0.48 for the area under the <b>cortisol</b> rise curve.|$|E
25|$|The <b>cortisol</b> {{awakening}} response (CAR) is {{an increase}} of about 50% in <b>cortisol</b> levels occurring 20–30minutes after awakening {{in the morning in}} some people. This rise is superimposed upon the late-night rise in <b>cortisol</b> which occurs before awakening. While its purpose is uncertain, it may be linked to the hippocampus' preparation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) in order to face anticipated stress.|$|E
25|$|Both random total <b>cortisol</b> levels, total <b>cortisol</b> levels or {{increment}} after ACTH stimulation tests, free <b>cortisol</b> levels, or {{a combination}} of these have been proposed as diagnostic tests. Other stimulation tests for adrenal insufficiency which are used in non-critical patients, such as the test using metyrapone or a test which employs insulin to induce hypoglycemia, are not preferred for CIRCI. Both a metyrapone-induced decrease in <b>cortisol</b> and hypoglycemia are potentially harmful to intensive care patients. The exact dose of ACTH remains a matter of debate. In the CORTICUS study, ACTH stimulation testing predicted mortality whereas baseline <b>cortisol</b> levels did not. However, possible benefits of corticosteroid therapy {{do not seem to be}} completely predicted by ACTH stimulation testing. For these reasons, guidelines currently do not recommend that ACTH stimulation testing should guide the decision whether or not to administer corticosteroids. <b>Cortisol</b> immunoassays on the other hand have been shown to be prone to both over- and underestimation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cortisol</b> {{counteracts}} insulin, {{contributes to}} hyperglycemia-causing hepatic gluconeogenesis and inhibits the peripheral use of glucose (insulin resistance) by decreasing the translocation of glucose transporters (especially GLUT4) {{to the cell}} membrane. However, <b>cortisol</b> increases glycogen synthesis (glycogenesis) in the liver. The permissive effect of <b>cortisol</b> on insulin action in liver glycogenesis is observed in hepatocyte culture in the laboratory, although the mechanism for this is unknown.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cortisol</b> is {{released}} from the adrenal glands following activation by ACTH release from the pituitary. The ACTH release creating the <b>cortisol</b> awakening response is strongly inhibited after intake of a low-dose dexamethasone. This is a synthetic glucocorticoid and this inhibition allows the detection {{of the presence of}} negative feedback from circulating <b>cortisol</b> that controls to ACTH-secreting cells of the pituitary.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cortisol</b> {{works with}} {{epinephrine}} (adrenaline) to create memories of short-term emotional events; {{this is the}} proposed mechanism for storage of flash-bulb memories, and may originate {{as a means to}} remember what to avoid in the future. However, long-term exposure to <b>cortisol</b> damages cells in the hippocampus; this damage results in impaired learning. Furthermore, <b>cortisol</b> inhibits memory retrieval of already stored information.|$|E
25|$|Strictly, Cushing's {{syndrome}} {{refers to}} excess <b>cortisol</b> of any etiology (as syndrome means {{a group of}} symptoms). One {{of the causes of}} Cushing's syndrome is a cortisol-secreting adenoma in the cortex of the adrenal gland (primary hypercortisolism/hypercorticism). The adenoma causes <b>cortisol</b> levels in the blood to be very high, and negative feedback on the pituitary from the high <b>cortisol</b> levels causes ACTH levels to be very low.|$|E
25|$|Glucocorticoid potency, {{duration}} of effect, and the overlapping mineralocorticoid potency vary. <b>Cortisol</b> {{is the standard}} of comparison for glucocorticoid potency. Hydrocortisone is the name used for pharmaceutical preparations of <b>cortisol.</b>|$|E
25|$|Naps: {{students}} taking a nap {{of one to}} two hours {{in the early evening}} hours (between 6:45–8:30p.m.) had no <b>cortisol</b> awakening response, suggesting <b>cortisol</b> awakening response only occurs after night sleep.|$|E
25|$|Loneliness {{is shown}} to {{increase}} the concentration of <b>cortisol</b> levels in the body. Prolonged, high <b>cortisol</b> levels can cause anxiety, depression, digestive problems, heart disease, sleep problems, and weight gain.|$|E
