5|$|After {{the battle}} on the {{southern}} side of the Shangani was over, Forbes and his column conducted a cursory search for survivors from Wilson's party, but, unable to cross the river, <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>nothing</b> {{to tell them what}} had happened. Guessing (correctly) that all Company men beyond the river had been killed, they turned and trekked back to Bulawayo in miserable fashion, their supplies all but gone and the Matabele impeding their progress at every turn.|$|E
5|$|The men {{inside them}} paddled fast on the treadmills, and the ships glided {{forwards}} {{as though they}} were flying, yet no one was visible on board. The enemy thought that they were made of paper. Then all of a sudden a thunderclap bomb was let off. It was made with paper (carton) and filled with lime and sulphur. (Launched from trebuchets) these thunderclap bombs came dropping down from the air, and upon meeting the water exploded with a noise like thunder, the sulphur bursting into flames. The carton case rebounded and broke, scattering the lime to form a smoky fog, which blinded the eyes of men and horses so that they <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>nothing.</b> Our ships then went forward to attack theirs, and their men and horses were all drowned, so that they were utterly defeated.|$|E
25|$|He {{caught the}} smallpox, {{which made him}} so ill that he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>nothing</b> for nine days and had to spare his eyes for several weeks after his recovery.|$|E
60|$|It was pitch dark in there. He <b>could</b> <b>see</b> {{absolutely}} <b>nothing</b> and was {{oppressed by}} the profound stillness unstirred {{even by the}} sound of breathing.|$|R

60|$|He ran to {{the door}} in {{question}} and pushed upon it. It gave way, and with caution he entered the building. All was so dark he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> absolutely <b>nothing.</b>|$|R
25|$|The next {{hundred miles}} of grade from Reno to Colfax, California were {{by far the}} most {{challenging}} to build and provided the most impressive views of the whole route, although for much of that stretch passengers <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>nothing</b> as trains traveled through miles of tunnels and snowsheds. After passing Verdi, Nevada, the site in November, 1870, of the first train robbery on the Pacific coast, the Overland Route crossed into California and followed the Truckee River up a picturesque canyon to the town of Truckee on Donner Lake where the ill-fated George Donner party had been snowbound in the winter of 1846–7.|$|E
25|$|Bill Cotton, the BBC's Head of Light Entertainment in the mid–1970s, {{said after}} the first series was {{produced}} that the show was {{a prime example of}} the BBC's relaxed attitude to trying new entertainment formats and encouraging new ideas. He said that when he read the first scripts he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>nothing</b> funny in them, but, trusting that Cleese knew what he was doing, he gave the go-ahead. He said the commercial channels, with their emphasis on audience ratings, never would have let the programme get to the production stage {{on the basis of the}} scripts.|$|E
25|$|His father, brother, and a {{neighbour}} {{came out}} to look and Joseph immediately said he too could see the apparition although the adults saw nothing. The mother, Victoire, came out but she too <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>nothing.</b> The boys’ parents could not see what their children were seeing that night and called for Sister Vitaline, the local school teacher. She, like the boys’ parents, could also not see the apparition, and called for two girls, Françoise Richer and Jeanne-Marie Lebosse, aged nine and eleven. Sister Vitaline suggested that perhaps Our Lady was visible only to the children. Without any knowledge of the apparition, these two girls looked {{into the night sky}} and began describing Our Lady in the same exact detail as the Barbedette boys had described.|$|E
60|$|Frank gazed intently ahead, but <b>could</b> <b>see</b> {{absolutely}} <b>nothing,</b> {{though he}} could hear a smashing and crashing which presently died away again on the slope. Then Harry brought down his rifle and turned away.|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>could</b> you <b>see</b> <b>nothing</b> of {{breakers}} ahead, Bob?" [...] demanded Mark, with {{an emphasis}} on the 'you' which pretty plainly implied that the young man was not so much surprised that the captain had not seen them.|$|R
60|$|It was dark, and {{for several}} seconds Dave <b>could</b> <b>see</b> little or <b>nothing.</b> He heard a faint groan.|$|R
500|$|Money {{was very}} tight in Villeneuve's early career. He was a {{professional}} racing driver from his late teens, with no other income. In {{the first few years}} the bulk of his income actually came from snowmobile racing, where he was extremely successful. He could demand appearance money as well as race money, especially after winning the 1974 World Championship Snowmobile Derby. His second season in Formula Atlantic was part-sponsored by his snowmobile manufacturer, Skiroule. He credited some of his success to his snowmobiling days: [...] "Every winter, you would reckon on three or four big spills — and I'm talking about being thrown on to the ice at 100 miles per hour. Those things used to slide a lot, which taught me a great deal about control. And the visibility was terrible! Unless you were leading, you <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>nothing,</b> with all the snow blowing about. Good for the reactions — and it stopped me having any worries about racing in the rain." ...|$|E
500|$|After Richardson {{came out}} on This Morning, Dennis Ayers, writing for gay men's news website AfterElton.com, criticised the revelation, believing it to be for promotional {{purposes}} only. Whilst acknowledging Ste as being a [...] "violent bully, a domestic abuser, and a single father", Ayers <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>nothing</b> in Ste's [...] "dark past hinted {{that he might be}} gay." [...] In spite of his criticism, he praised Richardson for coming out as gay. Anthony D. Langford, also writing for AfterElton, who avidly followed the plot, felt shocked when he witnessed Brendan attacking Ste. He moped there was worse to come and found it compelling viewing. He also did not perceive it as a romantic story stating: [...] "Ste and Brendan's scenes do have an element of sexual allure since the actors have chemistry, but there's too much darkness and manipulation on the edges of every scene to make real romance even possible". He also gave credit to the show for its slow build up over a few months. After Rae became pregnant All About Soap said: [...] "Crikey, at this rate Mr Hay will soon be giving Walford's Jack Branning a run for his money for the Most fertile Man in Soapland award!" ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{subject of}} Gleizes entries at the 1911 Indépendants are {{discernible}} {{to some extent}} and to some viewers, while it was claimed that others <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>nothing.</b> For Gleizes, the subject (the 'figurative support') is used only as an accessory, hidden under other values that are more specifically important. Gleizes writes in his Souvenirs: ...|$|E

60|$|I {{bowed and}} made no answer, after which he and his companions opened the bags of gold to show {{me that it was}} there, {{offering}} to weigh it again against my servant, the dwarf, so that I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>nothing</b> had been taken away.|$|R
60|$|In a {{short time}} the fusillade of musketry broke out far to the left, and showed that the Russians were there attacking the French lines. The noise was tremendous, and all in camp were oppressed by the sound which told of a mighty {{conflict}} raging, but of which they <b>could</b> <b>see</b> absolutely <b>nothing.</b>|$|R
2500|$|One {{event that}} {{affected}} `Abdu'l-Bahá greatly during his childhood was the imprisonment {{of his father}} when `Abdu'l-Bahá was eight years old; the imprisonment led to his family being reduced to poverty and being attacked in the streets by other children. `Abdu'l-Bahá accompanied his mother to visit Bahá'u'lláh who was then imprisoned in the infamous subterranean dungeon the Síyáh-Chál. He described how [...] "I saw a dark, steep place. We entered a small, narrow doorway, and went down two steps, but beyond those one <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>nothing.</b> In {{the middle of the}} stairway, {{all of a sudden we}} heard His …voice: 'Do not bring him in here', and so they took me back".|$|E
2500|$|Darwin {{had avoided}} taking on {{official}} posts which would take valuable time, turning down William Whewell's request that he become Secretary of the Geological Society with excuses including [...] "anything which flurries me completely knocks me up afterwards and brings {{on a bad}} palpitation of the heart", but in January 1838 he accepted the post. On 7 March he read to the Society his longest paper yet, which explained the earthquake he had witnessed at Concepción, Chile, in terms of gradual crustal movements, {{to the delight of}} Lyell. Despite hours of practice, as he later recalled; [...] "I was so nervous at first, I somehow <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>nothing</b> all around me, & felt as if my body was gone, & only my head left".|$|E
2500|$|A convoy {{located on}} 26 February {{did not offer}} a chance of attack, because [...] had first fired on it causing its escorts to chase Balao from the scene. Two days later, Balao sighted smoke on the horizon and {{commenced}} tracking three ships and an escort. Shortly after midnight, Balao went to battle stations and closed for attack. After firing her six bow tubes at the lead ship, the submarine swung her stern toward the wing ships in the formation and fired her stern tubes. Balao heard several explosions at the expected times, as torpedo after torpedo struck home. One of the damaged ships trained a [...] gun on Balao, but a heavy internal explosion silenced the gun before Balao could be hit. The submarine <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>nothing</b> except heavy smoke in the target area, but radar watched as two [...] "pips" [...] disappeared from the screen. Balao lured the escort out of the target area in order to double back {{to look for the}} third freighter. Radar and lookouts failed to locate the merchantman, so Balao returned to patrol the shipping lanes after a very successful attack. Postwar study of Japanese shipping records identified her victims as the 2,723-ton freighter Shoho Maru and the 6,803-ton passenger cargoship Akiuro Maru.|$|E
6000|$|... 'The boat's course {{had been}} a little awry while Mrs. James {{neglected}} her steering to wave her handkerchief to her husband and Mrs. Stephen; but now the light skiff went straight onward again, and they <b>could</b> soon <b>see</b> <b>nothing</b> more of the two figures it contained than Olive's light mantle and Stephen's white shirt sleeves behind.|$|R
60|$|At last {{he began}} to come to himself and after a bit sat up to gaze about him. But all was dark and he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> little or <b>nothing.</b>|$|R
60|$|He <b>could</b> <b>see</b> next to <b>nothing,</b> for {{the cellar}} was dark. His head ached keenly, {{and he could}} not collect his senses. He also felt {{somewhat}} sick at the stomach.|$|R
2500|$|In 1847 Mitchel {{resigned}} {{his position}} as leader writer on The Nation. He later explained {{that he had come}} to regard as [...] "absolutely necessary a more vigorous policy against the English Government than that which William Smith O'Brien, Charles Gavan Duffy and other Young Ireland leaders were willing to pursue". He [...] "had watched the progress of the famine policy of the Government, and <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>nothing</b> in it but a machinery, deliberately devised, and skillfully worked, for the entire subjugation of the island—the slaughter of portion of the people, and the pauperization of the rest," [...] and he had therefore [...] "come {{to the conclusion that the}} whole system ought to be met with resistance at every point, and the means for this would be extremely simple, namely, a combination among the people to obstruct and render impossible the transport and shipment of Irish provisions; to refuse all aid to its removal; to destroy the highways; to prevent everyone, by intimidation, from daring to bid for grain and cattle if brought to auction under 'distress' (a method of obstruction which put an end to Church tithes before); in short, to offer a passive resistance universally; but occasionally, when opportunity served, to try the steel." [...] This revolutionary line conflicted with the stance of The Nation, so Mitchel started his own paper, The United Irishman.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first few}} seconds {{are the most}} crucial and {{controversial}} of the disaster. Survivors insist that a female official immediately stood up and shouted: [...] "Students sit down; don’t move. Let the leaders walk out first (...) [...] " [...] (Note: In Chinese, the order: 让领导先走 has since became a popular internet catch phrase, meaning the government officials have priority over ordinary folks in times of emergency). She has since been identified in online articles as Kuang Li (况丽), who was vice-director of the state petroleum company’s local education centre, though {{there has been no}} official confirmation of this. [...] The teachers obeyed, and the children remain seated. [...] By the time the about 20 Communist Party officials had filed out through the only opened emergency exit, when all the other exits remained locked, it was too late. Teachers hurried the pupils out of their seats to other exits, only to find that the emergency exit doors were locked, and no one seem to care enough to get them opened. [...] Parents and survivors alleged that Kuang took refuge in a ladies’ cloakroom that could have sheltered 30 people and barred the doors behind her. [...] A 10-year-old boy said [...] "My teacher asked me to run out of the theatre, but when I stood up the hall was smothered in smoke and fire. The power then cut out. People <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>nothing.</b> The place was full of crying and shouting." ...|$|E

60|$|The massed pines {{gradually}} {{faded to}} a formless blur {{on the cold}} blue-gray slopes of snow. There was no sound from the valley by {{the roar of the}} river, and by and by a servant turned on the lamps. Lucy <b>could</b> now <b>see</b> <b>nothing</b> outside and shivered as she looked at her watch. She hoped no accident had delayed the tram.|$|R
60|$|At breakfast I {{was able}} to take the news of his {{departure}} without making any sign. I fancy that Lady St. Maurice was watching me when she made the announcement.
