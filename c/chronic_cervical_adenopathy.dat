40|$|Background: Cervical {{lymphadenitis}} is {{the most}} common form of extrapulmonary tuberculosis in children, although its relative contribution as a cause of persistent <b>cervical</b> <b>adenopathy</b> is not well-documented. The aim of this study was to determine the relative contribution of tuberculous lymphadenitis as a cause of persistent <b>cervical</b> <b>adenopathy</b> in a tuberculosis-endemic setting and to document its clinical presentation at the primary health care level. Methods: A prospective descriptive study was conducted from February 2003 through October 200 at 5 primary health care clinics in Cape Town, South Africa. The study included all children younger than 13 years presenting with persistent <b>cervical</b> <b>adenopathy</b> to the local primary health care clinic. Results: A total of 158 children were evaluated of whom 35 (22. 2 %) were diagnosed with tuberculous lymphadenitis. Bacteriologic confirmation was achieved in 27 of 35 (77. 1 %) children; all 35 responded to standard antituberculosis treatment. The majority of those without tuberculous lymphadenitis (105 of 123, 85. 4 %) had a visible superficial lesion in the area drained by the affected nodes. In children with persistent lymphadenopathy ≥ 2 x 2 cm, tuberculosis lymphadenitis was diagnosed in 31 of 33 (93. 9 %); specificity was 98. 4 %, sensitivity was 88. 6 % and the positive predictive value was 93. 4 %. Conclusion: Children commonly present with persistent <b>cervical</b> <b>adenopathy</b> to the primary health care clinic. The use of a simple clinical algorithm provided an accurate diagnosis of tuberculous lymphadenitis in the study setting. Fine needle aspirations provided a rapid and definitive diagnosis in the majority of children and will have added diagnostic value in settings where alternative diagnoses are more likely.

40|$|Background Antibiotic {{prescription}} {{for the management}} of all acute pharyngitis seems to be increasing recently. Streptococcal pharyngitis is the one that has strong indication for antibiotic prescription. It is quiet hard to distinguish the clinical features of streptococcal pharyngitis from non-streptococcal one. Objective To determine specifically clinical features of streptococcal pharyngitis and distinguish them from non-streptococcal one. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study on children with acute pharyngitis at Pediatric Outpatient Department Dr. M. Djamil Hospital, Padang from November 2006 until March 2007. Data on clinical features and pharyngeal swab culture results were analyzed using chi-square test for clinical predictors. All were then reanalyzed using multivariate logistic regression. Results Ninety-five children aged 3 - 13 years were enrolled and pharyngeal swab culture was performed. Group A β -haemolyticus streptococcus was found in 13 children (14 %). Absence of cough, sore throat, tonsillar exudates and tender anterior <b>cervical</b> <b>adenopathy</b> were the clinical predictors for streptococcal pharyngitis and the last two shared highest risk (OR 55. 05; 31. 82). Combination of tonsillar exudates, tender anterior <b>cervical</b> <b>adenopathy</b> and absence of cough contributed 99, 3 % probability. Conclusions Streptococcal pharyngitis includes a small part of all childhood with acute pharyngitis. High grade fever, sore throat, absence of cough, tonsiller excudates and tender anterior <b>cervical</b> <b>adenopathy</b> were considered as clinical predictors for childhood streptococcal pharygitis.

The most important interventions of his first hospitalization were endotracheal intubation because of increasing dyspnoea due to adult respiratory distress syndrome and haemodialysis for renal insufficiency. His admission to our hospital was marked by the echocardiographic discovery of giant coronary aneurysms {{in the first few}} centimeters of both right and left coronary arteries. Coronary angiography confirmed giant aneurysm formation of the right and left coronary arteries. Similarly, medium sized arteries (cerebral, hepatic, mesenteric, iliac) presented abnormalities on angiography.

Since internal jugular vein thrombosis (IJVT) is mostly underdiagnosed, a great attention is needed to diagnose the disease. A 75 -year-old woman with history of dyspnea on exertion (DOE), weight loss and anorexia with the stable vital sign and right-sided <b>cervical</b> <b>adenopathy</b> with suspected thyroid nodule was admitted.

40|$|Background: <b>Cervical</b> <b>adenopathy</b> is {{a common}} problem and the {{differentiation}} of benign and malignant node is of crucial importance for therapy management. Objective: This prospective study aimed to know if Diffusion weighted images (DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) can differentiate benign from malignant cervical lymphadenopathy. Patients and methods: Thirty patients with <b>cervical</b> <b>adenopathy</b> were included in this study. Doppler ultrasound, DWI and ADC maps were automatically reconstructed and used for the measurement of ADC values. Results: The sensitivity and specificity of the RI cut-off value < 0. 69 in differentiation between benign and malignant cervical L. Ns was 88. 8 % and 71. 4 %, respectively. The optimal ADC cut off value for differentiation between benign and malignant lymph nodes was ⩽ 1. 0  ×  10 − 3  mm 2 /s with an accuracy 96. 7 %, a sensitivity 100 %, a specificity 88. 9 %, PPV 95. 4 % and NPV 100 % and statistically significant P-value =  0. 000.

We enrolled 115 unrelated pediatric and adult patients with history of periodic fevers who fulfilled the current diagnostic criteria for PFAPA syndrome in three Italian referral centers and highlighted differences between children and adults. Eighty-five children and 30 adults were evaluated: the frequency of flares was significantly higher in pediatric cases, while febrile attack duration was significantly longer in adults. Clockwork periodicity of fever and recurrent pharyngitis were more frequently observed in childhood, but no differences were identified for aphthosis and <b>cervical</b> <b>adenopathy.</b> Conversely, joint symptoms, myalgia, headache, fatigue, ocular signs, and rashes were more common in adults. The simultaneous occurrence {{of two or three}} cardinal PFAPA signs did not show any statistical difference between the groups, while the occurrence of only one cardinal manifestation was more frequent in adults. Corticosteroids were effective in 98. 82  % of children and 88. 2  % of adults. Tonsillectomy was rarely performed, resulting effective in only two patients. Our data illustrate the clinical overlap between pediatric and adult cases of PFAPA syndrome.
