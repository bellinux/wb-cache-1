40|$|Retrofit {{introduction}} of <b>contour</b> <b>marking</b> for lorries. The Netherlands has an annual number of approximately 300 fatal or serious injury crashes involving lorries (rigid lorries, articulated lorries and trailers). European Commission CARE data indicates that in 2010 around 5000 people died on EU roads in crashes involving Heavy Goods Vehicles (HGVs), and 75 % of these fatalities were occupants of other vehicles. Road traffic crashes involving lorries {{tend to be}} more serious than other crashes because of the great size and mass of these vehicles. Part of these crashes are due to lateral and rear-end collisions at dusk or in the dark. Previous SWOV research has shown that <b>contour</b> <b>marking</b> on lorries can contribute to the prevention of these types of crashes. EU directive 2007 / 35 /EC states that from 10 July 2008, lorries with a minimum weight of 7. 5 tonnes and trailers from a maximum mass of 3. 5 tonnes must be fitted with <b>contour</b> <b>marking</b> that is approved and applied in the correct manner in order to pass the type approval test. From 10 July 2011, retroreflecting <b>contour</b> <b>marking</b> must not only be applied to new vehicle types, but also to older vehicle types that are licensed for the first time (European Union, 2007 a, 2007 b). The <b>contour</b> <b>marking</b> is not compulsory for existing vehicles that are already licensed. 3 M wants to know which substantive arguments can be put forward to plead for {{introduction of}} <b>contour</b> <b>marking</b> for the existing vehicle park in the Netherlands and the European Union, the so-called retrofit, and asked SWOV to investigate the issue. The 3 M request resulted in the following research questions: - What road safety effects can be expected as a result of retrofit application of <b>contour</b> <b>marking</b> on lorries in the Netherlands? - What are the social costs and benefits of this measure and is the measure socially cost-effective? - What are the costs and benefits for transport companies? - What is the effect of retrofit <b>contour</b> <b>marking</b> on the number of fatalities and seriously injured in the EU due to traffic crashes? Dutch and international literature were studied and a cost-benefit analysis was conducted to answer these questions. Based on Dutch and international research, it is estimated that in the present situation in the Netherlands, retrofit <b>contour</b> <b>marking</b> leads to an estimated maximum prevention of 3 fatalities, 16 serious road injuries and 481 crashes per year. This data is only valid for a situation in which none of the vehicles in the Dutch vehicle fleet would be fitted with <b>contour</b> <b>marking</b> and <b>contour</b> <b>marking</b> would be applied to all vehicles at the same time. This is not the actual situation and lorries are replaced when their service life has ended. In addition, due to previous European legislation, <b>contour</b> <b>marking</b> will already be applied to part of the vehicle fleet on 1 January 2015 (commencement date for the measure in our calculations). Statistics Netherlands (CBS) data indicates that the average lifespan of rigid lorries and of articulated lorries is 13 years, and of trailers the average lifespan is 22 years. Gradual implementation of <b>contour</b> <b>marking</b> would imply that the entire fleet of trailers would continue to drive without retrofit for approximately 11 years, and the entire fleet of rigid lorries and articulated lorries for approximately 6, 5 years. This data could be used to calculate the effect of implementing retrofit <b>contour</b> <b>marking</b> for all vehicles at once, if not for the fact that some lorries have already been fitted with <b>contour</b> <b>marking.</b> The fact that adaptations have already taken place, affects both the relevant fleet size (the share without retrofit) and the average lifespan of that share. There are various ways to include fleet changes in the calculation of the effect. The present calculations show that both factors (fleet size and lifespan) influence safety proportionally. Therefore, their effect on safety is the same, irrespective of, for example, fleet size or lifespan being half the size. If the above is taken into account, the total savings over the period during which the measure is being introduced (i. e. from 1 January 2015 until <b>contour</b> <b>marking</b> has been applied to all lorries) amounts to: • 8 fatalities; • 42 serious road injuries; • 1268 crashes. Chapter 2 discusses the reasons for possible over- or underestimates of these numbers. The costs of the retrofit introduction of <b>contour</b> <b>marking</b> for trucks in the Netherlands consist of the costs of the marking itself and the costs of applying the marking. The costs of applying the marking have been calculated for two different scenarios: a ‘maximum’ scenario in which full side contour markings are applied to the sides of all trucks, and a ‘minimum’ scenario in which only the bottom and the upper corners are marked, in accordance with the minimum requirements of the European Union...|$|E
40|$|Retro-reflecting <b>contour</b> <b>marking</b> can {{increase}} the perceptibility of the lorry. These markings can, therefore, contribute towards reducing collisions of vehicles against the side or rear-end of lorries. In this report, {{a number of questions}} are asked, for instance: (1) How many accidents are there involving flank and rear-end collisions with lorries during hours of twilight and darkness; (2) Can a positive effect of <b>contour</b> <b>marking</b> (and advertising) with retro-reflecting materials be expected; and (3) What is the economic efficiency of using retro-reflecting <b>contour</b> <b>marking</b> that can be expected? The problem is relatively small in terms of absolute size. There are approximately 1, 800 accidents a year, as a result of which there are about 9 road deaths and 83 in-patients (estimated numbers). The number of registered accidents are 576. It can be estimated for the Netherlands that, with a large-scale introduction of <b>contour</b> <b>marking</b> on lorries, approximately the following safety increase could be realised: two to three deaths less, twenty to thirty in-patients less, and several hundred accidents less. The total costs {{that will have to be}} made for the introduction of the measure, applied to all lorries, is estimated at 57 million Euros. The result of the benefit-cost analysis made is positive. The estimated benefit-cost ratio is to be regarded as modest: not much greater than 1, which is the critical value for a socially profitable measure. The cost-effectiveness, in comparison with other potential measures, is rather low. At the investment level, seeing the benefi-cost ratio found, the measure is not profitable. With large-scale application, economic efficiency is an important criterion. There is not much support for aiming at large-scale or complete application; neither from the branch and interest organisations, nor from the government...|$|E

40|$|Intonation can convey {{information}} about how lists are structured into groups, as well as about specific item positions within a group. In Bari Italian, this function is expressed by three different tunes a) a rising contour, signalling that the list {{has not yet been}} completed; b) a high-rising <b>contour,</b> <b>marking</b> the penultimate item, i. e. signalling {{that the end of the}} list is approaching; c) a falling <b>contour,</b> <b>marking</b> the last item, i. e. cueing the end of the sequence. In this paper we explore the effects of such intonational information on working memory. In particular, we demonstrate that when listeners are requested to recall spoken nine-digit sequences by strictly following their serial order, their performance is significantly better when lists are characterised by tunes of the type described above, compared to sequences whose items are marked by a neutral, peak accent and/or are grouped by inserting a silent pause. We also observed that recall of items marked by specific contours at positions 3, 6 and 9 is particularly enhanced at these positions, whereas in sequences also containing intonational cues to items in penultimate position (2, 5 and 8) recall of those items is not equally improved. Therefore, it appears that in serial recall of spoken sequences, even when a large number of specific intonational cues to serial positions are available, listeners can use only a selection of them...|$|E

A depth discontinuity is where the observer’s line of sight jumps from the surface of an object to the background (i.e., is tangent to the surface), as occurs at the sides of a cylinder. The same <b>contour</b> might <b>mark</b> both an orientation and depth discontinuity, as with the back edge of a brick.

30|$|Segmentation of SPECT images reconstructed using ASR {{generally}} produces VOIs {{that are}} smaller than the physical extension of the object. This is seen in Fig. 4 where the red <b>contours,</b> <b>marking</b> the <b>contours</b> of the VOIs obtained from the segmentation of the SPECT images, are typically more contracted than the green region, marking the tumours as defined in the phantom. In Tables 1 and 2, the tumour volume is thus systematically underestimated for ASR images, irrespective of the segmentation method used. Even if the relative standard deviation is low for the volume estimation from these images, this systematic deviation yields a relatively high volume-rRMSE. The volume underestimation when using ASR images for segmentation consequently produces an overestimation of the activity concentration, since a contracted VOI in general gives a different (higher) recovery than a VOI that follows the object boundary. Furthermore, a volume underestimation results in a lower RC being used, which also add to the overestimation of the activity concentration. For SPECT images at 24 h p.i. when instead using FS or OM for delineation in AS images, the estimated volume for tumours above approximately 10 cm 3 is relatively accurate, with volume-rRMSEs of approximately 10 %.|$|R

Using fieldwork done in eastern Sri Lanka during a one-year period (1998 - 99) and with follow up study during January-April 2004, this paper foregrounds the material and social spaces, namely networks, within which women exercise their everyday agency. I focus on women's narratives to show how networks are simultaneously supportive and oppressive because of ethno-nationalist practices produced in and through these informal spaces. Since the spatiality of networks perform both a private sphere activity, namely caring work, and yet control and monitor women's behaviour, a marker generally associated with the public sphere, I argue that networks located in a denaturalized and historically specific context may help blur the binary positioning that has been a hallmark of modernist thinking...|$|R
40|$|Segmentation, i. e. the {{labelling}} {{of objects}} in image data, is a crucial step in many medical imaging processing tasks, e. g. operation planning, radio therapy or diagnostics. Seeded region growing is a basic yet effective method for semi-automatic segmentation. Its major drawback is that poor contrast at the organ edges may result in leaks, letting the area grow far beyond the region of interest. We developed a new method to reliably detect the origins of these leak regions and correct the segmentation results. Our approach {{is based on the}} observation that leaks are normally characterized by a narrow bottleneck connection to the seed area. We detect this bottleneck by specifying a single point somewhere within the erroneous area and tracing a path back to the seed point, moving along the skeleton of the segmented region. The point on the skeleton with the minimal distance to the <b>contour</b> <b>marks</b> the bottleneck. To cope with minor deviations from the desired result (not featuring a characteristic bottleneck), we optimized our freehand tool to minimize the necessary user interaction.
