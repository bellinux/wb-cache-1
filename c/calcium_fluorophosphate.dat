50|$|Fluorapatite, {{often with}} the {{alternate}} spelling of fluoroapatite, is a phosphate mineral with the formula Ca5(PO4)3F (<b>calcium</b> <b>fluorophosphate).</b> Fluorapatite is a hard crystalline solid. Although samples can have various color (green, brown, blue, yellow, violet, or colorless), the pure mineral is colorless as expected for a material lacking transition metals. Along with hydroxylapatite, {{it can be a}} component of tooth enamel.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the use of the monofluorophosphate anion to {{synthesise}} a range of materials as potential biomaterials. Here we report the novel synthesis of a monazite structured SrPO_ 3 F, formed from a readily available PO_ 3 F^ 2 - precursor via a precipitation reaction. Subsequently, through modifications to the reaction temperature a novel hydrated phase has also been synthesised. Both structures consist of distorted PO_ 3 F^ 2 - tetrahedron with an apparent ordering of the P-F bond. SrPO^ 3 F is the first example of a monazite system containing divalent cations. To investigate the compositional tolerance of this system, a range of mixed metal systems were explored using Ca^ 2 +, Ba^ 2 +, Eu^ 2 +. The incorporation of trivalent ions (La^ 3 + and PO_ 4 ^ 3 -) into the SrPO_ 3 F phase was pursued as it has been reported previously that low levels of Sr^ 2 + incorporation into LaPO_ 4 produced a proton conducting material. In addition, a successful synthesis of a modified gypsum system, involving inclusion of fluorophosphate (Ca(SO_ 4) x(PO_ 3 F) 1 -xÂ· 2 H_ 2 O, where x = 0 - 1), has been achieved via a precipitation reaction. Initial solubility results suggest that cements formed with <b>calcium</b> <b>fluorophosphates</b> offer greater water stability, a current limiting factor in the wider use of gypsum. This thesis also describes a study into the stabilisation of synthetic amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) using the orthophosphate, fluorophosphate and pyrophosphate species. Results suggest that crystallisation of ACC is inhibited through exposure to appropriate levels of these simple inorganic species orthophosphate, fluorophosphate and pyrophosphate...|$|R
40|$|In dentistry, {{repair and}} {{restoration}} of tooth structure to regain its mechanical properties {{is the ultimate}} aim of caries management. Currently, preventive therapies are preferred to operative interference. New preventive approaches are necessary to treat dental caries. Dentine is composed of an organic matrix, consisting of type 1. Degradation of collagen matrix {{is the main reason}} for breakdown of resin-dentine bonds and development of secondary caries over time. Hence, preservation of collagen fibrils is essential for preventive and reparative procedures in minimum intervention dentistry. Proanthocyanidin (PA) is a natural collagen cross-linker, which can be obtained from grape seeds, pine bark or elm tree. It has a high affinity to proline-rich proteins, like collagen. Cross-linking of the collagen fibrils increases their mechanical properties and their resistance to breakdown by proteolytic enzymes. Thus, {{in the first part of}} the study, with the aim of discovering other possible natural dentine collagen cross-linkers, the effect of two smaller molecular size flavonoids, naringin and quercetin, on the mechanical properties of demineralized dentine was compared to PA. Demineralized dentine treated with PA showed the greatest increase in mechanical properties, followed by quercetin and naringin. The protease inhibitory effect of PA was evaluated by examining its actions on soluble and collagen-bound matrix metalloproteinases and cysteine cathepsins. Proanthocyanidin, even at low concentration of 1 %, exhibited excellent inhibitory effects on soluble and matrix-bound proteases. Secondly, PA was incorporated in a dental adhesive to facilitate its application in clinical situations. The effect of PA incorporation on durability of resin-dentine bond was evaluated. Up to 2 % of PA could be added to dental adhesive with no adverse effects on immediate resin-dentine bond strength. However, the bond strengths of PA-incorporated adhesives dropped significantly following ageing. This could be attributed to the free radical scavenging effect of PA, which might also have interfered with polymerization of dental adhesive. The mechanical properties of PA-incorporated adhesive were evaluated and it was shown that up to 1 % PA could be incorporated into an adhesive resin. With the addition of higher concentration of PA, the mechanical properties of the adhesive resin were reduced with increased solubility. Proanthocyanidin release from the cured resin showed an initial burst for 48 hours and was stabilized after five days. Finally, the remineralization potential of PA on artificial root caries was also compared with quercetin and naringin. All three flavonoids showed remineralization potential; however, their effects were inferior to fluoride. Proanthocyanidin formed a precipitate band on the superficial layer of carious lesion, preventing further mineral deposition. Subsequently, PA was incorporated in a CPP-ACFP (casein phosphoproteins amorphous <b>calcium</b> <b>fluorophosphates)</b> containing-paste to increase the mineral uptake in subsurface layer of caries lesion. Simultaneous application of PA and CPP-ACFP was shown to have a favourable outcome on mineral deposition in root caries lesion. published_or_final_versionDentistryDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
