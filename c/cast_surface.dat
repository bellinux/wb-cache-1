In the case of large-scale casting market within the casting industry, customers demand high quality <b>casting</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The new method of casting termed full mold casting (FMC) could only achieve low quality results compared with existing wooden pattern-based sand mold casting, which had sufficiently high quality in its <b>casting</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Even in that market, however, the casting of metallic molds for automobiles had particular requirements because <b>casting</b> <b>surfaces</b> were later dealt by mold companies. Thus, customers welcomed shorter delivery times even with lower quality <b>casting</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Kimura Chuzosho Co., Ltd. first acquired certain customers who desired shorter delivery times, and then improved <b>casting</b> <b>surface</b> quality and productivity over the course of doing business with them. Eventually, they became successful in capturing more than half the market for automobile metallic mold castings.

50|$|After {{degating}} {{and heat}} treating, sand or other molding media may remain {{adhered to the}} casting. To remove any mold remnants, the surface is cleaned using a blasting process. This means a granular media will be propelled against {{the surface of the}} casting to mechanically knock away the adhering sand. The media may be blown with compressed air, or may be hurled using a shot wheel. The cleaning media strikes the casting surface at high velocity to dislodge the mold remnants (for example, sand, slag) from the casting surface. Numerous materials may be used to clean cast surfaces, including steel, iron, other metal alloys, aluminium oxides, glass beads, walnut shells, baking powder, and many others. The blasting media is selected to develop the color and reflectance of the <b>cast</b> <b>surface.</b> Terms used to describe this process include cleaning, bead blasting, and sand blasting. Shot peening may be used to further work-harden and finish the surface.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{formation}} {{mechanisms of}} horizontal wrinkles and water wave wrinkles on steel <b>casting</b> <b>surface</b> {{have been investigated}} in this study. The horizontal wrinkles, which are the traces of rising steel flow overlapping, are caused by low pouring temperature and slow molten steel flow rising rate. The water wave wrinkles are resulted {{from the use of}} an alcohol-based refractory coating with poor permeability and strong penetration behavior. This coating may penetrate deeply into the pores of sand mold and are not easy to be dried by flame combustion. When pouring the alcohol containing in the coating will volatilize and generate a large amount of gas, forming a gas cushion at steel-mold interface. With the gas escapes gradually, the gas cushion disappears, leaving a gap between the steel and the mold, the solidifying <b>casting</b> <b>surface</b> layer will freely fall down and creep in this gap under gravity itself, resulting in <b>casting</b> <b>surface</b> wrinkling...|$|R

40|$|The DC {{casting process}} {{used for the}} {{production}} of cast aluminium alloy products intended for processing by rolling, extrusion or forging is an economically important process with approximately 10 million tonnes of DC cast product being produced annually world wide [1]. Process productivity, particularly with respect to elimination of casting defects and hence process scrap is an important factor to DC cast product producers. The literature reporting the DC casting process, particularly with respect to the formation of defects on the <b>cast</b> <b>surface,</b> is reviewed and the mechanisms for the formation of such defects examined. A universally understood and accepted explanation was found for only one of the normal surface defects encountered in practice. A number of samples of commercially cast DC products were subject to detailed <b>cast</b> <b>surface</b> examination, particularly surface microstructures. The results of this examination and the literature survey identified molten metal surface tension as a possible contributing factor affecting the molten metal meniscus stability within the DC casting mould. Meniscus instability is linked with the formation of surface defects. The literature on surface tension of aluminium alloys provided only limited information hence the surface tension of a range of binary and ternary alloys, including commercial alloys was determined, producing data hitherto not available. Of the common alloying elements used in commercial aluminium alloys, iron and magnesium were found to significantly reduce the surface tension. Surface fracture also resulted in a reduction in surface tension for the majority of alloys tested. The surface tension data is combined with mould thermal and physical model calculations to propose a mechanism for the formation of the <b>cast</b> <b>surface</b> defects. The model proposes a maximum stable size for the meniscus according to the alloy and mould conditions. Conditions outside these limits result in meniscus instability and the formation of <b>cast</b> <b>surface</b> defects. The model suggests possible operating changes that may reduce the incidence of surface defect formation. The work also identifies a number of areas requiring further investigation before major practical process changes aimed at <b>cast</b> <b>surface</b> defect elimination, may be formulated...|$|E

The various coupling mechanisms between the solid-shell and mold deformation and heat transfer at the mold/solid-shell interface during the early stages of Aluminum solidification on molds with uneven topographies are investigated. The air-gap nucleation time, the stress evolution and the solid-shell growth pattern are examined for different mold topographies to illustrate the potential control of Aluminum <b>cast</b> <b>surface</b> morphologies during the early stages of solidification using proper design of mold topographies. The unstable shell growth pattern in the early solidification stages results mainly from the unevenness of the heat flux between the solid-shell and the mold surface. This heat flux is determined {{by the size of the}} air-gaps formed between the solidifying shell and mold surface or from the value of the contact pressure. Simulation results show that a sinusoidal mold surface with a smaller wavelength leads to nucleation of air-gaps at earlier times. In addition, the unevenness in the solid-shell growth pattern decreases faster for a smaller wavelength.

Solidification of the alloy during precision casting is associated with two processes: (i) {{the growth of the}} [0001]. alpha. oriented columnar grains from the mould wall into the cast interior and (ii) the enrichment of {{the central part of the}} cast with aluminium. The first process results in a fully lamellar microstructure where lamellae are preferentially oriented parallel to the <b>cast</b> <b>surface.</b> The second process contributes to the development of the duplex microstructure in the central part of the cast. It is shown that distinct microstructural types in different regions of the cast result in different creep strengths.

The third type of the creep specimens cut out of the central region of the cast and oriented perpendicular to the cast bar axis showed the intermediate creep strength.

Spontaneous growth of the blister nucleus occurs through creep deformation of the surrounding aluminium due to the blister nucleus’ high internal gas pressure.
