2500|$|The band soon {{obtained}} a London-based management company, 'Ridgepride', formed by Alex Murray (Alex Wharton), {{who had been}} in the A division of Decca Records. [...] Their recording contract was signed in the spring of 1964 with Ridgepride, which then leased their recordings to Decca. They released a single, [...] "Steal Your Heart Away", that year which failed to chart. They also appeared on the cult TV programme Ready Steady Go! singing the uptempo 'B' side [...] "Lose Your Money (But Don't Lose your Mind)". But it was their second single, [...] "Go Now" [...] (released later that year), that launched their career, being promoted on TV with one of the first purpose-made promotional films in the pop era, produced and directed by Alex Wharton. The single became a hit in Britain (where it remains their only Number 1 single) and in the United States, where it reached No. 10. The band encountered management problems after the chart-topping hit and subsequently signed to Decca Records in the UK (London Records in the US) directly as recording artists. A four track extended play release titled: [...] "The Moody Blues" [...] featuring both sides of their first two Decca singles was issued in a <b>colour</b> <b>picture</b> sleeve in early 1965.|$|E
