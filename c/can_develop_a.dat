5|$|A {{dust devil}} (also {{known as a}} whirlwind) resembles a tornado {{in that it is}} a {{vertical}} swirling column of air. However, they form under clear skies and are no stronger than the weakest tornadoes. They form when a strong convective updraft is formed near the ground on a hot day. If there is enough low level wind shear, the column of hot, rising air <b>can</b> <b>develop</b> <b>a</b> small cyclonic motion that can be seen near the ground. They are not considered tornadoes because they form during fair weather and are not associated with any clouds. However, they can, on occasion, result in major damage.|$|E
5|$|Norwegian Forest cats have a {{quiet voice}} but <b>can</b> <b>develop</b> <b>a</b> loud voice if kept {{in a house with}} a dog. They are friendly, intelligent, and {{generally}} good with people. The Norwegian Forest cat has a lot of energy and can be very demanding of attention. Those cats that live primarily outdoors become swift and effective hunters, but the breed can also adapt to indoor life. If bought from a registered breeder in the USA, they tend to cost from $550 to $800. The cats usually live to be 14 to 16 years old. As they are heavy-boned and tall, they require more food than most other domestic breeds. Males are considerably heavier and larger-boned than females.|$|E

Of these, some cause isolated attacks of rhabdomyolysis (e.g., dietary deficiency in vitamin E and selenium, poisoning associated with pasture or agricultural poisons such as organophosphates), while others predispose to exertional rhabdomyolysis (e.g., the hereditary condition equine polysaccharide storage myopathy). 5–10% of thoroughbred horses and some standardbred horses suffer from the condition equine exertional rhabdomyolysis; no specific cause has been identified, but an underlying muscle calcium regulation disorder is suspected.|$|E
5|$|The {{clinical}} {{signs and symptoms}} of AML result from the growth of leukemic clone cells, which tends to displace or interfere with the development of normal blood cells in the bone marrow. This leads to neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. The symptoms of AML are, in turn, often due to the low numbers of these normal blood elements. In rare cases, people with AML <b>can</b> <b>develop</b> <b>a</b> chloroma, or solid tumor of leukemic cells outside the bone marrow, which can cause various symptoms depending on its location.|$|E

5|$|The social {{problems}} arising from alcoholism are serious, {{caused by the}} pathological changes {{in the brain and}} the intoxicating effects of alcohol. Alcohol abuse is associated with an increased risk of committing criminal offences, including child abuse, domestic violence, rape, burglary and assault. Alcoholism is associated with loss of employment, which can lead to financial problems. Drinking at inappropriate times, and behavior caused by reduced judgment, can lead to legal consequences, such as criminal charges for drunk driving or public disorder, or civil penalties for tortious behavior, and may lead to a criminal sentence. An alcoholic's behavior and mental impairment, while drunk, can profoundly affect those surrounding them and lead to isolation from family and friends. This isolation can lead to marital conflict and divorce, or contribute to domestic violence. Alcoholism can also lead to child neglect, with subsequent lasting damage to the emotional development of the alcoholic's children. For this reason, children of alcoholic parents <b>can</b> <b>develop</b> <b>a</b> number of emotional problems. For example, they can become afraid of their parents, because of their unstable mood behaviors. In addition, they can develop considerable amount of shame over their inadequacy to liberate their parents from alcoholism. As a result of this failure, they develop wretched self-images, which can lead to depression.|$|E

25|$|Each {{character}} <b>can</b> <b>develop</b> <b>a</b> {{large number}} of skills, although some can only be learned if the character is of a certain race (Human, Elf, Giant). Skills are divided into nine categories: Life, Combat, Magic, Alchemy, Fighter, Music, Puppeteer, Dual Gunner and Ninja. Life refers to crafting and performing skills, such as fishing, cooking, composing, tailoring, blacksmithing or potion making. Some of the Life skills available are also mini-games. Combat skills refer to melee and ranged attack skills, as well as defensive moves. Magic comprises three kinds of elemental magic (ice, fire and lightning) and non-elemental magic, such as healing and recovery skills. In Generation 9, Alchemy {{was introduced to the}} game world. Alchemy is used with a cylinder and a crystal, and can be used to create temporary walls, summon golems and a number of spells resembling magic (water/ice, fire/fire, wind/lightning and clay/neutral) according to the crystal used. In Generation 16, Fighter was released, introducing martial art techniques. In The Saga: Iria, Dual Gunner was introduced, and its skills regard the use of mana bullets. From The Shadows patch introduced the Ninja talent, which is enhanced by Strength and Will.|$|E
25|$|Z-Link and Kaza both pride {{themselves}} on horizontal integration of their in-house management, where the artists are given full control over all steps of the publication of their product – from creation, to editing, publishing and distribution. Z-Link goes even further, working to foster new talent until it can gain a truly public following: traditional calls for submission are supplemented by scouting of unpublished works on blogs, Facebook pages and other collective platforms used by fan communities online. Aspiring artists are encouraged {{to reach out to}} an audience, so that budding amateurs, who previously created for friends, <b>can</b> <b>develop</b> <b>a</b> wider fanbase and become published artists. Typically, new artists first publish short installments in Z-Link's monthly manga and gaming magazine, Laabstore, before being commissioned to produce a small print run (500–1,000 copies) of an independent volume. This structure permits Z-Link to reconfigure the traditional publishing channels and capitalize on its position between conventional publication and self-production. It provides the infrastructure for autonomous artists to achieve local print runs at a reasonable cost. Since their creation, Z-Link and Kaza have developed an enthusiastic and loyal following. Their catalogs, however, remain limited in number and difficult to procure, as the works are still distributed through a capillary network including a few bookstores in Algiers, Oran and Constantine.|$|E
25|$|Algebraic stacks can {{be further}} {{generalized}} and for many practical questions like deformation theory and intersection theory, this is often the most natural approach. One can extend the Grothendieck site of affine schemes to a higher categorical site of derived affine schemes, by replacing the commutative rings with an infinity category of differential graded commutative algebras, or of simplicial commutative rings or a similar category with an appropriate variant of a Grothendieck topology. One can also replace presheaves of sets by presheaves of simplicial sets (or of infinity groupoids). Then, in presence of an appropriate homotopic machinery one <b>can</b> <b>develop</b> <b>a</b> notion of derived stack as such a presheaf on the infinity category of derived affine schemes, which is satisfying certain infinite categorical version of a sheaf axiom (and to be algebraic, inductively a sequence of representability conditions). Quillen model categories, Segal categories and quasicategories {{are some of the}} most often used tools to formalize this yielding the derived algebraic geometry, introduced by the school of Carlos Simpson, including Andre Hirschowitz, Bertrand Toën, Gabrielle Vezzosi, Michel Vaquié and others; and developed further by Jacob Lurie, Bertrand Toën, and Gabrielle Vezzosi. Another (noncommutative) version of derived algebraic geometry, using A-infinity categories has been developed from early 1990s by Maxim Kontsevich and followers.|$|E

25|$|Crittenden {{proposes that}} {{both kinds of}} {{information}} can be split off from consciousness or behavioural expression as a 'strategy' to maintain the availability of an attachment figure: 'Type A strategies were hypothesized {{to be based on}} reducing perception of threat to reduce the disposition to respond. Type C was hypothesized to be based on heightening perception of threat to increase the disposition to respond' Type A strategies split off emotional information about feeling threatened and type C strategies split off temporally-sequenced knowledge about how and why the attachment figure is available. By contrast, type B strategies effectively use both kinds of information without much distortion. For example: a toddler may have come to depend upon a type C strategy of tantrums in working to maintain the availability of an attachment figure whose inconsistent availability has led the child to distrust or distort causal information about their apparent behaviour. This may lead their attachment figure to get a clearer grasp on their needs and the appropriate response to their attachment behaviours. Experiencing more reliable and predictable information about the availability of their attachment figure, the toddler then no longer needs to use coercive behaviours with the goal of maintaining their caregiver's availability and <b>can</b> <b>develop</b> <b>a</b> secure attachment to their caregiver since they trust that their needs and communications will be heeded.|$|E
