Before the hull loss of Crossair Flight LX498, there had been only four crashes worldwide of the 400 Saab-340 plane types since 1984 and only two of those were hull losses. The two hull losses were a 1994 KLM Cityhopper <b>crash</b> <b>that</b> killed three in the Netherlands and a 1998 Formosa Airlines <b>crash</b> <b>that</b> killed 13 in Taiwan.|$|E

5|$|David {{challenges}} Elijah with {{an incident}} {{from his childhood}} when he almost drowned. Elijah suggests that the incident highlights the common comic trope whereby superheroes often have one weakness; he contends David's might be water. While surveying the stored wreckage of the train <b>crash</b> <b>that</b> he survived, David recalls the car accident that ended his athletics career, remembering that he was unharmed and ripped a door off the car {{in order to save}} Audrey. David used the accident as an excuse to quit football because Audrey did not like the violence of the sport.|$|E

The quintet recorded under the leadership of Rollins in March for Prestige; this was released as Sonny Rollins Plus 4. They also had live national CBS Radio broadcasts from the Basin Street club in April and May. Two years of exposure with the Brown–Roach ensemble meant that Powell was beginning to achieve some recognition in his own right.|$|E

5|$|Along Long Island, {{the high}} storm surge flooded {{hundreds}} of streets and caused heavy beach erosion. High winds downed thousands {{of trees and}} damaged hundreds of homes, causing widespread power outages. About 1.5 {{million people in the}} state lost power, including two-thirds of the Long Island Lighting Company customers, {{making it one of the}} worst power outages in the state. There were four deaths on Long Island, two of whom related to heart attacks and the other two related to fallen trees. There were also 14 injuries in the region, many of them due to downed tree branches. In the New York mainland, heavy rainfall flooded rivers and alleviated drought conditions. Rough waves damaged boats and docks along the Hudson River. Unsettled weather contributed to a traffic fatality and an airplane <b>crash</b> <b>that</b> killed one in the New York mainland.|$|E
5|$|Anita and {{the player}} get drunk {{on a table}} {{while the rest of}} the {{characters}} start dancing and flying across the room. Then the player is taken again to the room where Anita was peeling oranges, and then back to the room where both she and Borges were lying shot. The player is then shown leaving the airport carrying Borges on a luggage cart. They arrive at a small place where the gunfight sequence takes place, followed by the motorcycle ride sequence, which ends with a <b>crash</b> <b>that</b> leads the player into a museum. In this area, there are several plaques showing the game's name and credits. The player leaves the area and goes into a new one where Bernoulli's principle about low and high air pressures is explained. Then, the player is again moved to the motorcycle sequence, where the game ends.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland pursued former Steelers {{coach and}} Browns linebacker Bill Cowher and former Browns scout Scott Pioli {{for the head}} {{coaching}} job. The team, however, hired former New York Jets coach Eric Mangini in January 2009. Before {{the start of the}} season, Mangini and the front office traded Winslow to the Buccaneers after five seasons marked by injuries and a motorcycle <b>crash</b> <b>that</b> threatened to end the tight end's career. The Browns showed little sign of improvement in Mangini's first year, finishing 5–11 in 2009. While Cleveland lost 11 of its first 12 games, the team won the final four games of the season, including a 13–6 victory over the rival Steelers.|$|E

As a result, the couple divorced and now share custody of their son, M.J. (Mason Vale Cotton). Susan engages in a sexual relationship with her house painter, Jackson Braddock (Gale Harold), but keeps their romance a secret from her friends and family. Jackson seeks a more substantial relationship, but Susan is weary of such a commitment following her divorce. Elsewhere, Gabrielle has been raising two overweight daughters, Juanita (Madison De La Garza) and Celia (Daniella Baltodano), and has also lost her own figure as well. Gabrielle tricks Juanita into exercising by driving away and making Juanita chase after her car.|$|E
5|$|For decades afterward, Jennings {{repeatedly}} {{admitted that}} he felt responsible for the <b>crash</b> <b>that</b> killed Buddy Holly. This sense of guilt precipitated bouts of substance abuse through much of Jennings' career. The day of the flight was later known as the Day the Music Died. Jennings sang The Stage, {{a tribute to the}} Day the Music Died. He recreated the concert performers on February 2, 1959, in order at the Surf Ballroom, starting with Eddie Cochran, then Ritchie Valens, the Big Bopper and, finally, Buddy Holly. This was the concert that preceded the infamous plane crash. The Stage {{can be found on the}} Surf Ballroom Winter Dance Party CD.|$|E
5|$|In {{the five}} years that take place between seasons four and five, Susan and Mike are {{involved}} in a car <b>crash</b> <b>that</b> kills a mother and her daughter. Although Susan was driving, Mike takes the blame, as Susan did not have her license with her at the time. Susan feels incredibly guilty for taking the lives of Lila (Marie Caldare) and Paige Dash (Madeleine Michelle Dunn), but Mike insists it was not their fault. The argument over the topic becomes so great that it results in divorce. Giving up on love, Susan engages in a casual relationship with her house painter, Jackson Braddock (Gale Harold).|$|E

5|$|Late in that season, the Calgary Flames dealt all-star forward Theoren Fleury, {{along with}} Chris Dingman, to the Avalanche for Rene Corbet, Wade Belak, a draft pick and {{their choice of}} a {{prospect}} from a list provided by Colorado. Impressed with his defensive potential, the Flames later chose Regehr to complete that trade. His professional career nearly ended before it started, as he was seriously injured {{in an automobile accident}} near Saskatoon, Saskatchewan on July 4, 1999. Regehr, who was driving home from a summer trip with his elder brother Dinho (Ronald) and two female friends, was struck head-on by another vehicle that crossed into his path. He suffered two broken legs in the <b>crash</b> <b>that</b> killed two people in the other vehicle. Doctors initially feared that he would never play hockey again.|$|E

5|$|The NTSB {{report on}} the {{accident}} noted, but did not criticise, the medical operation at the scene. It described how paramedics attended {{to those who were}} conscious with life-threatening injuries, but did not make any attempts to resuscitate victims who appeared drowned or lacked vital signs because they believed that they could not be revived because they had succumbed to the cold salt water. It was estimated by the authorities who attended the scene of the <b>crash</b> <b>that</b> 15 ambulances responded to the accident site, all of which were used to transport the injured to hospitals, and that 40 additional ambulances were available near the site of the crash, but were not needed.|$|E

Djamolidine Abdoujaparov out-sprinted {{the rest of the}} field to win the race's tenth stage. The Giro's twelfth stage featured a few categorized climbs as the race made its way into Slovenia for the stage's finish in Kranj. Despite the climbs, the stage ended with a field sprint that was won by Andrea Ferrigato. Italian Michele Bartoli won the race's undulating thirteenth stage by being a part of the stage's initial breakaway and then attacking later on and soloing to the stage's conclusion in Lienz, Austria.|$|E

5|$|E.P. Arnold Royalton, {{owner of}} {{conglomerate}} Royalton Industries, offers Speed an astoundingly luxurious lifestyle {{in exchange for}} signing to race with him. Speed is tempted but declines due to his father's distrust of power-hungry corporations. Angered, Royalton reveals that for many years the key races have been fixed by corporate interests, including Royalton himself, to gain profits. Royalton takes out his anger on Speed by having his drivers force Speed into a <b>crash</b> <b>that</b> destroys the Mach 6 and suing Racer Motors for intellectual property infringement. Speed gets an opportunity to retaliate through Inspector Detector, head of a corporate crimes division. Racer Taejo Togokahn {{says that he has}} evidence that could indict Royalton but will only offer it up if Speed and the mysterious masked Racer X agree to race on his team in the Casa Cristo 5000. Taejo says that a win could substantially raise the stock price of his family's racing business, blocking a Royalton-arranged buyout. Speed agrees but keeps his decision secret from his family, and Inspector Detector's team makes several defensive modifications to the Mach 5 to assist Speed in the rally.|$|E
