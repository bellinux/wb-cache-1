40|$|Large {{datasets}} such as Cultural Heritage collections require detailed annotations when digitised {{and made}} available on-line. Annotating {{different aspects of}} such collections requires a variety of knowledge and expertise which is not always possessed by the collection <b>curators.</b> <b>Artwork</b> annotation {{is an example of}} a knowledge intensive image annotation task, i. e. a task that demands annotators to have domain-specific knowledge in order to be successfully completed. This pa-per describes the results of a study aimed at investigating the applicability of crowdsourcing techniques to knowledge intensive image annotation tasks. We observed a clear re-lationship between the annotation difficulty of an image, in terms of number of items to identify and annotate, and the performance of the recruited workers...|$|R

40|$|Two {{case studies}} of {{students}} from California School for the Blind studying <b>artworks</b> in <b>museums</b> and on the Web are discussed. The analysis focuses on the traditional understanding that unreachable <b>artworks</b> in the <b>museum</b> are deciphered by non-intellectual elites primarily {{from the perspective of}} visual perception and museums are simple vessels of art, as contended by Ernst Gombrich and Pierre Bourdieu, and that exclusion is either passive or active. It is also argued that there is a bridge between sensing an object and understanding it that is beyond perceptions. The article concludes that the two students featured in the case studies {{were more likely to be}} passively rather than actively excluded from unreachable and two-dimensional artworks, and that they could still develop a symbolic intellectual and emotional connection with these <b>artworks</b> and the <b>museum</b> through verbal descriptions and being in their presence. © The Author(s) 2013...|$|R
