40|$|We {{present an}} {{individual}} based model of cultural evolution, where interacting agents are coded by binary strings standing for strategies for action, blueprints for products or attitudes and beliefs. The model is patterned on an established model of biological evolution, the Tangled Nature Model (TNM), where a `tangle' of interactions between agents determines their reproductive success. In addition, our agents {{also have the}} ability to <b>copy</b> <b>part</b> of each other's strategy, a feature inspired by the Axelrod model of cultural diversity. Unlike the latter, but similarly to the TNM, the model dynamics goes through a series of metastable stages of increasing length, each characterized by mutually enforcing cultural patterns. These patterns are abruptly replaced by other patterns characteristic of the next metastable period. We analyze the time dependence of the population and diversity in the system, show how different cultures are formed and merge, and how their survival probability lacks, in the model, a finite average life-time. Finally, we use historical data on the number of car manufacturers after the introduction of the automobile to the market, to argue that ourmodel can qualitatively reproduce the flurry of cultural activity which follows a disruptive innovation...|$|E
40|$|This paper surveys {{recent work}} on dynamic {{simulation}} of rigid bodies with non-interpenetration constraints. The problems of collision detection and contact force determination are discussed, along with both frictionless and frictional collision and contact. For the collision-detection problem, methods which deal with objects' motion {{as a single}} continuous function of time are compared and contrasted to discretization methods. For the problem of determining interaction forces between contacting objects, both penalty and constraint-based methods are considered. This is an electronic reprint.

Email: baraff@cs. cmu. edu Eurographics ' 93 State of the Art Reports Non-penetrating Rigid Body Simulation 1. 0 Introduction The disparity between what we can model and visualize on a computer versus what we can physically simulate has become quite large. We have become fairly adept at creating high-quality images of complex models, but our ability to perform realistic physical simulation on these models lags far behind our ability to visualize them. In computer graphics and robotics applications, a major concern is modeling systems of objects' motions over time. For the most part, we wish to simulate objects' motions as realistically as is practical for a particular application. In particular, since most physical objects are impenetrable, {{it is important that}} our simulations correctly handle the issues of collision a [...] ...|$|E
