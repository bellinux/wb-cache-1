5|$|On October 7, 1987, Collins {{called a}} special {{legislative}} session {{to close a}} deficit between state contributions to the worker's compensation Special Fund and disbursements. The Special Fund was designated for payments to workers with occupational diseases and workers whose work-related injuries could not be traced to any single employer. A plan proposed by Democratic state senator Ed O'Daniel was expected to {{provide the framework for}} legislation considered in the session. Under O'Daniel's plan, additional revenue for the Special Fund would be raised by increasing assessments on worker's compensation premiums for 30 years. Assessments for coal companies were increased more than those on other businesses because the majority of the <b>claims</b> <b>paid</b> from the Special Fund were for black lung, a breathing disease common among coal miners; consequently, it was opposed by legislators from heavily coal-dependent counties. Nevertheless, after nine days of negotiations, a bill substantially similar to O'Daniel's original plan was approved by the legislature and signed by Collins.|$|E

50|$|Critical Illness insurance, {{also known}} as Trauma Insurance in Australia is characterised by lump sum {{payments}} for listed medical events. Unlike in the United Kingdom, Trauma Insurance conditions are not standardised and market competition is based on both premium and policy definitions.

Around 85% of Trauma Insurance <b>claims</b> <b>paid</b> in Australia are for either Cancer or Heart Disease. It is not uncommon for policies to also offer partial payments, if the condition suffered does not meet the full definition required for a full claim payout.|$|E
5000|$|For example, an auto insurer {{collects}} money {{every month}} from its {{customers in the}} form of a premium. Should a customer have a covered auto accident, the company pays out a claim. In the time between the receipt of each premium payment and the paying of the claim, the money received by the insurer can be invested. Returns from investments are the primary source of profits for an insurance company. If the amount of premiums taken in is greater than the <b>claims</b> <b>paid</b> out, even before taking into account investment returns, the excess additional profit is called [...] "underwriting profit". Another prime example occurs when using Insured Profits.|$|E

This real right in security operates by way of hypothecation, often arises by operation of law (generally statute), and gives a creditor a preferential right to have <b>claims</b> <b>paid</b> out of the hypothecated property as last recourse when the debtor is in default. At common law it is equivalent to an American non-possessory lien or English legal charge.|$|E
