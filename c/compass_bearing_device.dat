50|$|On {{aircraft}} or vessels {{there are}} three types of bearing: true, magnetic, and <b>compass</b> <b>bearing.</b> <b>Compass</b> error {{is divided into two}} parts, namely magnetic variation and magnetic deviation, the latter originating from magnetic properties of the vessel or aircraft. Variation and deviation are signed quantities. As discussed above, positive (easterly) variation indicates that magnetic north is east of geographic north.|$|R

5000|$|A {{grid bearing}} is {{measured}} {{in relation to the}} fixed horizontal reference plane of grid north, that is, using the direction northwards along the grid lines of the map projection as a reference point, while a <b>compass</b> <b>bearing,</b> as in vehicle or marine navigation, {{is measured in}} relation to the magnetic compass of the navigator's vehicle or vessel (if aboard ship). It should be very close to the magnetic bearing. The difference between a magnetic <b>bearing</b> and a <b>compass</b> <b>bearing</b> is the deviation caused to the compass by ferrous metals and local magnetic fields generated by any variety of vehicle or shipboard sources (steel vehicle bodies/frames or vessel hulls, ignition systems, etc.) ...|$|R

The term [...] "metes" [...] {{refers to}} a {{boundary}} defined by the measurement of each straight run, specified by a distance between the terminal points, and an orientation or direction.

50|$|An {{altazimuth}} or alt-azimuth mount is {{a simple}} two-axis mount for supporting and rotating an instrument about two perpendicular axes - one vertical and the other horizontal. Rotation about the vertical axis varies the azimuth (<b>compass</b> <b>bearing)</b> of the pointing direction of the instrument. Rotation about the horizontal axis varies the altitude (angle of elevation) of the pointing direction.|$|R
50|$|Magnetic {{deviation}} is {{the angle}} from a given magnetic bearing to the related bearing {{mark of the}} compass. Deviation is positive if a <b>compass</b> <b>bearing</b> mark (e.g., <b>compass</b> north) is right of the related magnetic bearing (e.g., magnetic north) and vice versa. For example, if the boat is aligned to magnetic north and the compass' north mark points 3° more east, deviation is +3°. Deviation varies for every compass in the same location and depends on such factors as the magnetic field of the vessel, wristwatches, etc. The value also varies depending on {{the orientation of the}} boat. Magnets and/or iron masses can correct for deviation, so that a particular compass accurately displays magnetic bearings. More commonly, however, a correction card lists errors for the compass, which can then be compensated for arithmetically. Deviation must be added to <b>compass</b> <b>bearing</b> to obtain magnetic bearing.|$|R
5|$|The high melting point, {{hardness}} and {{corrosion resistance}} of iridium and its alloys determine {{most of its}} applications. Iridium and especially iridium–platinum alloys or osmium–iridium alloys have a low wear and are used, for example, for multi-pored spinnerets, through which a plastic polymer melt is extruded to form fibers, such as rayon. Osmium–iridium is used for <b>compass</b> <b>bearings</b> and for balances.|$|R
25|$|Concepts can {{be judged}} {{according}} to their use in solving problems, {{as well as for}} their use in building theories. The tension between these two motivations was especially great during the 1950s when category theory was initially developed. Enter Alexander Grothendieck, who used category theory to take <b>compass</b> <b>bearings</b> in other work—in functional analysis, homological algebra and finally algebraic geometry.|$|R

60|$|Then {{came the}} rush of years, filled brimming with projects, achievements, and failures; but Typee was not forgotten, and here I was now, gazing at its misty {{outlines}} till the squall swooped down and the Snark dashed on into the driving smother. Ahead, we caught a glimpse and took the <b>compass</b> <b>bearing</b> of Sentinel Rock, wreathed with pounding surf. Then it, too, was effaced by the rain and darkness. We steered straight for it, trusting to {{hear the sound of}} breakers in time to sheer clear. We had to steer for it. We had naught but a <b>compass</b> <b>bearing</b> with which to orientate ourselves, and if we missed Sentinel Rock, we missed Taiohae Bay, and we would have to throw the Snark up to the wind and lie off and on the whole night--no pleasant prospect for voyagers weary from a sixty days' traverse of the vast Pacific solitude, and land-hungry, and fruit- hungry, and hungry with an appetite of years for the sweet vale of Typee.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the <b>compass</b> <b>bearing,</b> for each leg the total distance will be measured {{as well as the}} height gained or lost and the steepness of the ground. Using this information an estimated time to complete the leg will be calculated usually using Naismith's Rule or one of its variations. These times are then added to estimate the total time needed for the expedition.|$|R

5000|$|Using {{tremendous}} {{skills and}} ingenuity, Gilmore's engineers constructed the [...] "Marsh Battery" [...] in the marsh between James Island and Morris Island. An 8-inch Parrott Rifle, nicknamed the “Swamp Angel,” was {{mounted in the}} battery, and began firing at the city at 1:30 AM, August 22, 1863. At a range of 7,900 yards, the gun was aimed by taking <b>compass</b> <b>bearings</b> off St. Michael’s church’s steeple. The first night, 10 incendiary and 6 explosive shells were fired into the city. The gun was not fired on the 23rd. On August 24, firing its 36th round the Swamp Angel burst. In its short life the Swamp Angel made artillery history {{as it was the}} longest-ranged artillery bombardment up to that date, {{and it was the first}} time artillery had been aimed by <b>compass</b> <b>bearing</b> [...] The Swamp Angel was not replaced in the Marsh Battery, but after the fall of Fort Wagner and Fort Gregg Federal batteries located in and near Fort Gregg (renamed Fort Putnam) resumed fire on the city of Charleston, continuing until the city was evacuated.|$|R
50|$|Orienteering is a {{longtime}} component of Scouting {{programs such as the}} Boy Scouts of America and other Scouting groups. The BSA first class rank requires that scouts complete a one-mile orienteering course by using a map and compass. The Scout must also measure the height of objects, such as trees, using simple trigonometry. Although some troops tend to emphasize the use of <b>compass</b> <b>bearings</b> and pacing, orienteering actually involves a variety of skills, including map reading and route solving.|$|R
5000|$|Legal {{boundaries}} are usually established {{by a professional}} surveyor using a transit and or modern Global Positioning System (GPS) technology. The coordinates of the property line are often described on a drawing called a [...] "plot plan" [...] or [...] "plat" [...] by indicating {{the length of the}} boundary along a specific <b>compass</b> <b>bearing</b> in relation to a verifiable [...] "point of beginning". The metes and bounds method is also used to provide a legal description of a property.|$|R
