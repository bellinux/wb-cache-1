30|$|The book {{on how to}} {{make all}} the colour paints for {{illuminating}} books invites readers to step inside the workshop of a fifteenth century illuminator in Portugal. This illuminator was the <b>carrier</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tradition</b> {{on how to make}} colours with ‘which you can illuminate or paint or capitalize or write’ that dates back, at least, to the thirteenth century. This unique knowledge and know-how was carefully preserved in Portuguese language, in Hebrew characters, in a collection of texts now known as Ms. Parma 1959 (Parma, Italy, Biblioteca Palatina, MS 1959, folios 1 r– 20 r). Its ultimate purpose was possibly to assist on the production of Hebrew Bibles, where the precision of the text would have been illuminated by the colours described in this ‘book of all colour paints’. This medieval treatise describes the main steps and ingredients for producing painting materials, such as mosaic gold, red lead, verdigris, brazilwood lake pigments, lac dye red, vermilion, parchment glue, among others. It also instructs on the binding media that should be used to produce the colour paints. In this paper, we will discuss the technical aspects relevant for the success of the making of the painting materials and of the experimentation of this remarkable text, copied in the fifteenth century.|$|E

Indeed, these cultures are mainly known as <b>a</b> <b>carrier</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> oral <b>tradition.</b> In fact it sits side by side, written as revealing, though less known.

25|$|LaVey {{included}} {{references to}} other esoteric {{and religious groups}} throughout his writings, claiming for instance that the Yezidis and Knight's Templar were <b>carriers</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Satanic <b>tradition</b> that had been passed down to the twentieth-century. Scholar of Satanism Per Faxneld believed that these references were deliberately tongue-in-cheek and ironic, however he noted that many Satanists who had read LaVey's writings had taken them to be literal historical claims about the past. Although he regularly derided older esotericists, LaVey also relied upon their work; for instance making use of John Dee's Enochian system in The Satanic Bible. Faxneld therefore believed {{that there was a}} tension in LaVey's thought between his desire to establish prestigious Satanic predecessors and his desire to be seen as the founder of the first real Satanic society.|$|R
40|$|Please note: {{this article}} is in Greek. Ritsos, and the {{crossing}} borders of femininity: This inter-disciplinary paper seeks to examine the perception of Modern Greek history and the feminine in Ritsos poetry. In many cultures women have been long suspected {{to be the source}} of human miseries, especially in conservative and repressive times. Since the ancient myths women were idealised but mostly mistrusted as seductive and vengeful, manipulative and even malevolent. In modern times, as ideals of purity and dedication to family have been exalted and feminine beauty lauded, women have been viewed as embodying sinister forces of evil. Ritsos lived in <b>an</b> era <b>of</b> tremendous conflicts and changes. Yet he was the <b>carrier</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ancient <b>tradition</b> due to his Greek origin. In grappling with our understanding of {{what it is to be}} “evil” for an ideological poet like Ritsos in eras of international and ethnic totalitarianism, and how women are used to confront or identify with it, the paper aims to shine a spotlight on this dark area of the social and human condition and explore the possible sources of worship, or fear and resentment, of women...|$|R
40|$|By {{examining}} the shifting working {{practices of the}} Sompura community of hereditary temple architects of western India my thesis argues {{that the nature of}} their work culture invested in their architectural and textual production is far more critical, innovative, heterogeneous and fluid than how it is portrayed in post-colonial knowledge located within the disciplinary bounds of architecture and art history. Through unchartered empirical investigation, which uses ‘cultural translation’ as a framework for analysis, the thesis highlights their creative negotiations and struggles with modernity between the late 19 th and early 21 st - century. Whether it is modern historical consciousness, notions of ‘antiquity’, nationalist ideas of hereditary craftsmen and tradition, changing patronage, global economy or technology, the Sompuras in their concrete and ‘present’ practices, translate all these as well as their long architectural lineage in specific inviolable modes. These query notions <b>of</b> <b>a</b> ‘fossilised’ <b>tradition</b> viewed through historical frameworks; the agency of ‘ritual’ untouched by capitalist processes and binary oppositions such as ‘east vs west’ or ‘traditional vs modern’. The publications of Narmadashankar M. Sompura (1883 - 1956) and P. O. Sompura (1896 - 1978), are analysed as transformations of both modern notions of antiquity and history and indigenous practices. The restoration of medieval ruins of Ranakpur and Dilwara temples in the early and mid-twentieth century by master builder Amritlal Mulshankar Trivedi (1910 - 2005) are explored as negotiations with western European ideas of history and conservation. The contingent relations between practice and codified knowledges are explored through oral histories concerning transnational case studies in the UK, whereas <b>a</b> variety <b>of</b> qualities and affects are seen as transforming capitalist processes and relations in modern carving factories, deploying <b>a</b> range <b>of</b> hand intensive, machine and digital technologies for a global dispersal. The thesis uses <b>a</b> variety <b>of</b> extra disciplinary methodologies such as oral history, close reading of family archives, along with <b>a</b> range <b>of</b> architecture and texts by the Sompuras and their medieval ancestors. It demonstrates that the Sompuras, believed to be <b>carriers</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dynamic architectural <b>tradition,</b> have creatively and dynamically negotiated change by translating and transforming both their pre-existing cultures of work, as well as modern and global paradigms...|$|R

40|$|The base {{excision}} repair protein, MUTYH, functionally {{interacts with the}} DNA mismatch repair (MMR) system. As genetic testing moves from testing one gene at a time, to gene panel and whole exome next generation sequencing approaches, understandin g the risk associated with co-existence of germline mutations in these genes will be important for clinical interpretation and management. From the Colon Cancer Family Registry, we identified 10 carriers who had both a MUTYH mutation (6 with c. 1187 G>A p. (Gly 396 Asp), 3 with c. 821 G>A p. (Arg 274 Gln), and 1 with c. 536 A>G p. (Tyr 179 Cys)) and a MMR gene mutation (3 in MLH 1, 6 in MSH 2, and 1 in PMS 2), 375 <b>carriers</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> single (monoallelic) MUTYH mutation alone, and 469 <b>carriers</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> MMR gene mutation alone. <b>Of</b> the 10 <b>carriers</b> <b>of</b> both gene mutations, 8 were diagnosed with colorectal cancer. Using a weighted cohort analysis, we estimated that risk of colorectal cancer for <b>carriers</b> <b>of</b> both <b>a</b> MUTYH and a MMR gene mutation was substantially higher than that for <b>carriers</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> MUTYH mutation alone [hazard ratio (HR) 21. 5, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 9. 19 - 50. 1; p < 0. 001], but not different from that for <b>carriers</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> MMR gene mutation alone (HR 1. 94, 95 % CI 0. 63 - 5. 99; p = 0. 25). Within the limited power of this study, {{there was no evidence}} that a monoallelic MUTYH gene mutation confers additional risk of colorectal cancer for <b>carriers</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> MMR gene mutation alone. Our finding suggests MUTYH mutation testing in MMR gene mutation carriers is not clinically informative. Restricted Access: Metadata Onl...|$|R
