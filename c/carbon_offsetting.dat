Our analysis concentrates on the production and consumption of <b>carbon</b> <b>offsets,</b> drawing on ideas from governmentality and political ecology about how narratives and technologies are used to create particular types of consumer subjectivities and shape consumer choice. We critically examine three narratives that offset producers are using to position <b>carbon</b> <b>offsets</b> and examine how these narratives are shaping circuits of <b>carbon</b> <b>offset</b> production and consumption.

40|$|<b>Carbon</b> <b>offset</b> is {{one type}} of {{flexibility}} mechanism in greenhouse gas emission trading schemes that helps nations meet their emission commitments at lower costs. <b>Carbon</b> <b>offsets</b> take advantage of lower abatement cost opportunities from unregulated sectors and regions, {{which can be used}} to offset the emissions from regulated nations and sectors. <b>Carbon</b> <b>offsets</b> can also meet multiple objectives; for example, the Clean Development Mechanism in the Kyoto Protocol encourages Annex I countries to promote low carbon sustainable projects in developing countries in exchange for <b>carbon</b> <b>offsets.</b> Alternatively, the costs under cap-and-trade policies are subjected to uncertainties due to uncertainties about technology, energy markets, and emissions. There are several cost-containment instruments to address cost uncertainties, such as banking, borrowing, safety valve, and allowance reserves. Although <b>carbon</b> <b>offsets</b> are verified to reduce expected compliance costs by providing a surplus of cheap allowances that can be used by Annex I countries to help meet their commitments, they have yet to be studied as a cost-containment instrument. <b>Carbon</b> <b>offsets</b> could potentially be a cost-containment instrument as purchasing <b>carbon</b> <b>offsets</b> during instances of high carbon price volatility could potentially provide some relief from high prices. This paper analyzes the effect of <b>carbon</b> <b>offsets</b> on <b>carbon</b> prices, specifically under carbon price uncertainty. I use <b>carbon</b> <b>offsets</b> from abatement activities that reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) as a case study example. My results show that <b>carbon</b> <b>offsets</b> reduce upside costs and thus can be an alternative cost-containment instrument, but cost-effectiveness can be limited by supply uncertainties, offset purchasing restrictions, emission target stringency and competition over demand. <b>Carbon</b> <b>offsets,</b> such as REDD, can serve as a flexibility instrument for developed nations, encourage global participation in reducing GHG emissions, and provide sustainable development support to developing nations. by Jieun Kim.

2500|$|Some activists {{disagree}} with the principle of carbon offsets, likening them to Roman Catholic indulgences, {{a way for the}} guilty to pay for absolution rather than changing their behavior. George Monbiot, an English environmentalist and writer, says that carbon offsets are an excuse for business as usual with regard to pollution. Proponents hold that the indulgence analogy is flawed because they claim carbon offsets actually reduce carbon emissions, changing the business as usual, and therefore address the root cause of climate change. Proponents of offsets claim that third-party certified carbon offsets are leading to increased investment in renewable energy, energy efficiency, methane biodigesters and reforestation and avoided deforestation projects, and claim that these alleged effects are the intended goal of carbon offsets. On October 16, 2009 responsibletravel.com, once a strong voice in favour of <b>carbon</b> <b>offsetting,</b> announced that it would stop offering <b>carbon</b> <b>offsetting</b> to its clients, stating that [...] "too often offsets are being used by the tourism industry in developed countries to justify growth plans on the basis that money will be donated to projects in developing countries.

2500|$|<b>Carbon</b> <b>offsetting</b> {{has gained}} some appeal and {{momentum}} mainly among consumers {{in western countries}} who have become aware and concerned about the potentially negative environmental effects of energy-intensive lifestyles and economies. The Kyoto Protocol has sanctioned offsets {{as a way for}} governments and private companies to earn carbon credits that can be traded on a marketplace. The protocol established the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), which validates and measures projects to ensure they produce authentic benefits and are genuinely [...] "additional" [...] activities that would not otherwise have been undertaken.

40|$|From a cost {{standpoint}} and {{as demonstrated}} in this paper, it is beneficial to permit forest-sector <b>carbon</b> <b>offsets</b> in lieu of carbon dioxide emissions reduction. Such offsets {{play a role in}} voluntary markets and Europe’s Emission Trading System. However, problems related to additionality, leakages, duration and impermanence, high transaction costs, and governance raise important questions about the validity of most <b>carbon</b> <b>offset</b> credits from forestry. Using data for a forest estate in south-eastern British Columbia owned by the Natural Conservancy of Canada (NCC), we construct a forest management model to demonstrate that the planned NCC management program yields questionable forest <b>carbon</b> <b>offsets.</b> NCC management results in slightly less annual carbon sequestration than leaving the forest as wilderness, but sustainable commercial management of the site sequesters between 8 and 270 thousand tonnes of CO 2 more per year than NCC management. Because commercial exploitation was the counterfactual used to justify the NCC <b>carbon</b> <b>offsets,</b> offsets were subsequently sold to non-arms-length buyers, and numbers of <b>carbon</b> <b>offsets</b> are highly sensitive to assumptions, one can only conclude that the <b>carbon</b> <b>offsets</b> generated by this (and probably many other) forest conservation projects are simply spurious...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{intended}} to {{develop an understanding of}} producer preference for land-based carbon sequestration in agriculture. We conducted a mail survey to elicit producer choice to provide marketable <b>carbon</b> <b>offsets</b> by participating in different carbon credit programs characterized by varying practices. Based on a quantitative analysis, we found that: 1) the market price for <b>carbon</b> <b>offsets</b> could increase producer participation in carbon sequestration; 2) producers perceived differentially different but correlated private costs for adopting carbon sequestering practices, depending on production attributes; and 3) relatively high carbon prices would be needed to stimulate producer provision of <b>carbon</b> <b>offsets</b> by land-based <b>carbon</b> sequestration activities. A simulation of producer choice with agricultural census data estimated potential <b>carbon</b> <b>offsets</b> supply in the Northern Great Plains region.

40|$|Graduation date: 2011 Policy {{makers in}} the United States (US), {{following}} recommendations {{made by the}} international scientific community, have drafted national emissions reduction legislation in hopes of minimizing {{the harmful effects of}} global climate change. Included in this legislation is a national cap-and-trade system with provisions for <b>carbon</b> <b>offsets.</b> Specific provisions for forest <b>carbon</b> <b>offsets</b> include reduced emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD) as well as other forestry-related offsets both domestically and internationally. Given that the majority of forestland in the US is privately owned and little extant work examines this population in relation to forest <b>carbon</b> <b>offsets,</b> the goal of the current research was to employ survey methodology to measure the intentions of US forestland owners (non-industrial and industrial) to participate in emerging <b>carbon</b> <b>offset</b> markets. Applying the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) (Ajzen 1991) as a theoretical framework, the current research examined the effects of attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control on intentions to participate in carbon sequestration and trading. In addition, the TPB model developed for non-industrial owners was extended to measure effects of innovativeness, environmental orientation, knowledge of <b>carbon</b> <b>offsets,</b> and perceived risk. The TPB model developed for industrial owners was extended to measure effects of perceptions regarding the likelihood of national cap-andtrade legislation implementation, legislation effectiveness, the legitimacy of domestic forest <b>carbon</b> <b>offsets,</b> economic short-termism, and organization (company) size. Overall, few private forestland owners were currently managing forestland for <b>carbon</b> <b>offsets</b> (non-industrial 5...|$|R
