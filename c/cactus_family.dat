500|$|Echinocereus reichenbachii (commonly {{known as}} lace or {{hedgehog}} cactus) is a perennial plant and shrub in the <b>cactus</b> <b>family.</b> The species {{is native to}} the Chihuahuan Desert and parts of northern Mexico and the southern United States, where they grow at elevations up to [...] The scientific name, Echinocereus, comes from the Greek ekinos, meaning hedgehog, and cereus, the Latin term for wax paper. The specific epithet honors German botanist Ludwig Reichenbach. This cactus earned the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.|$|E
500|$|In 1984, it {{was decided}} that the Cactaceae Section of the International Organization for Succulent Plant Study should set up a working party, now called the International Cactaceae Systematics Group (ICSG), to produce {{consensus}} classifications down to the level of genera. Their system has been used as the basis of subsequent classifications. Detailed treatments published in the 21st century have divided the family into around 125–130 genera and 1,400–1,500 species, which are then arranged into a number of tribes and subfamilies. The ICSG classification of the <b>cactus</b> <b>family</b> recognizes four subfamilies, the largest of which is divided into nine tribes. The subfamilies are: ...|$|E

500|$|Pfeiffer had {{published}} the first infrageneric division of Mammillaria in 1837, dividing the genus {{into two groups}} based on distinct spine characteristics. In 1845, Joseph zu Salm-Reifferscheidt-Dyck– based on work by Frederick Scheer– expanded the classification into eight groups. With at least 145 recognized species, {{it is one of}} the largest and most morphologically variable genera in the <b>cactus</b> <b>family.</b> Others estimate there are as many as two hundred species of Mammillaria, including sixty-two cultivated species from India. Though larger, the Opuntia genera is less popular with gardeners and landscapers. Mammillaria was previously thought to be monophyletic, but phylogenic analysis indicates that Mammilloydia is [...] "embedded within a 'core' group of Mammillaria species." [...] A specimen of Mammillaria spinosissima was collected by Botanist David Hunt in September 1971, when he located one in Mexico, near the Morelos Cautla-Cuernavaca toll road in Sierra de Tepoztlan, at an altitude of [...]|$|E
2500|$|During {{the decades}} of the 1950s and 1960s while much of Mulford's time was spent exploring, collecting, writing, cultivating, and {{designing}} yards he also managed to paint. His final painting series was called Synthesis and was completed over the years 1950-1966. He continued to do sketches and smaller works but Palm Family, Orchid Family and <b>Cactus</b> <b>Family</b> were his last serious paintings. It is this last series that prompted the name [...] "passionate plant lover". He ultimately held a showing at the Art Center of Maitland in September 1975 exhibiting all his paintings including all the series from the Photographic to the Synthesis. The Foster estate donated Mulford's last series of paintings to the Harry P. Leu Gardens where {{they are part of}} a permanent art exhibit.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The <b>cacti</b> <b>family</b> is a morphologically {{heterogeneous}} group comprising about 1600 species. DNA {{isolation from}} cacti is notoriously difficult because they contain high amounts of polysaccharides and secondary metabolites, which form insoluble complexes with nucleic acids during extraction. DNA from 53 species of four genera of cacti: Rebutia, Mediolobivia, Aylostera and Sulcorebutia were isolated. The average DNA yield from all genotypes was 106. 40 ng / µl. DNA yields per individual ranged from 33. 80 ng/µl to 441. 40 ng/µl. The genetic variability {{was tested using}} random amplified polymorphic DNA molecular marker, and the determination of genetic diversity was based on 81 bands produced by five primers, and was calculated with Jaccard’s index...|$|R

5000|$|Wildlife {{and native}} flora are mostly {{restricted}} to the southern {{two thirds of the}} borough where the conservation areas are. The vegetation of this conservation area is an important source for oxygenation in the Valley of Mexico. [...] Vegetation varies by altitude. Tree species include oaks, holm oaks and pines. Bushes, brush and other vegetation is mostly deciduous as well as plants from the legume and <b>cactus</b> <b>families.</b> A number of ravines and some of the higher altitudes have species adapted to wetter climes including Alnus jorullensis, Salix bonpladiana, Fraxinus uhdei, Buddlei cordata, Pronus capuli and Taxodium mucronatum. In the pre Hispanic period, fauna was highly varied; however, most of these species such as wildcats, wolves, coyotes, anteaters and many others are no longer found, having been forced out by human settlement and habitat loss. Smaller mammals such as rabbits and squirrels still remain, especially in the higher elevations. Also remaining are various types of birds such as hummingbirds, carpenter birds and more, along with various lizards, snakes and amphibians.|$|R
40|$|<b>Cacti</b> (<b>family</b> Cactaceae) are an {{important}} part of desert ecosystems. These plants are known for their many defensive adaptations, but occasionally, when a cactus becomes damaged or stressed, it becomes prone to invasion by microorganisms, which induce rot within the cactus. Rotting cacti host a diverse assemblage of desert arthropods, particularly beetles (Coleoptera) and flies (Diptera). Detailed research on cactus arthropods has been mostly limited to flies, while cactus beetles remain relatively understudied. This thesis serves as an investigation of the taxonomy, phylogenetics, and host- cactus preferences of the cactophilic species of the beetle genus Carcinops. For this study, five hundred and fifty Carcinops specimens were collected from rotting cacti in the Sonoran Desert. Key morphological differences between species were evaluated and summarized. Detailed photographs were taken of all known cactophilic Carcinops species and were used to construct an interactive identification key. COI sequenced were used to create a gene tree. Based on species distributions among different species of cacti, some species of Carcinops appear to exhibit host-plant specificity, although not to the degree seen in some species of cactus Drosophila. Populations of C. rugula and C. stenocereus showed evidence of genetic isolation from mainland Mexican populations, possibly due the Gulf of California acting as a geographic barrier. One new species of Carcinops was discovered during the course of this research, and is described herei...|$|R
