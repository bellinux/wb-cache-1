40|$|Joko Widodo (Jokowi) is {{a leader}} that is widely {{expected}} to transform Indonesia into a better country. Hopes and wishes were rising {{when he was elected}} as the president of Indonesia. This paper will describe various innovations undertaken before and after his presidential inauguration as well as the assorted innovations made in reforming the administration of his cabinet. As the president of Indonesia, Joko Widodo is required to realize the aspirations of the people in freeing the government from corruption, collusion, and nepotism. The management of ministerial and non-ministerial institutions becomes the very first crucial issue undertaken by Joko Widodo. This led to a polemic in regards to reducing or increasing the number of institutions, as the Jokowi administration actually increased the amount.

40|$|The {{potential}} advantages of pulsatile <b>s.</b> c. <b>administration</b> instead of daily bolus i. m. administration of human urinary gonadotrophin preparations were tested after {{the administration of}} a long-acting gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue within a programme for in-vitro fertilization (IVF) and embryo transfer. First, the pharmacokinetic properties of human urinary gonadotrophins were analysed with immunological and biological methods, both during bolus i. m. injections and during pulsatile <b>s.</b> c. <b>administration.</b> Second, a prospective randomized controlled study was performed in 75 patients undergoing IVF/embryo transfer in whom the effects of pulsatile <b>s.</b> c. <b>administration</b> were compared {{with the effects of}} single daily bolus i. m. injections of the same gonadotrophin preparation. The results showed that neither method of gonadotrophin administration induced measurable changes in the serum concentration of luteinizing hormone (LH). Both oestradiol and andro-stenedione concentrations were slightly lower during pulsatile <b>s.</b> c. gonadotrophin <b>administration,</b> suggesting that this method of gonadotrophin administration results in less LH occupying the ovarian LH receptors. Pulsatile <b>s.</b> c. gonadotrophin <b>administration</b> resembles a continuous infusion of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). Significant fluctuations in the serum concentrations of FSH were observed during single daily bolus i. m. administration of human urinary gonadotrophins, but the pregnancy rate of IVF/embryo transfer per cycle after pulsatile <b>s.</b> c. <b>administration</b> was not significantly better than after the daily bolus i. m. injection of gonadotrophins (42. 1 versus 37. 2 %). It is concluded that pulsatile <b>s.</b> c. <b>administration</b> of gonadotrophins instead of single daily injections does not improve the pregnancy rate in IVF/embryo transfe...|$|R

40|$|Possible {{reasons for}} visits to foreign nations by {{heads of state}} include the {{expansion}} of foreign markets for exports and the attraction of foreign direct investment. These two reasons are investigated in the two chapters that comprise this dissertation. The first chapter explores the role that a head of state may have in promoting exports and how it affects the decision of visiting any given foreign country under the presence of legacy preferences. A theoretical model is proposed and empirically estimated using the data for President Lula 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>administration</b> in Brazil from 2003 to 2006. The choice of this administration for empirical investigation is particularly interesting since it was marked by many presidential foreign visits that appeared to have both an export promotion component and legacy preferences. The {{results indicate that the}} export promotion component was important in explaining the export performance during Lula 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>administration</b> and that there was a strong legacy intent in the probability of having a visit to a foreign nation. The second chapter explores the role that the relevance of a delegation led by a head of state, visiting a foreign nation, may play in signaling the competitiveness of a country interested in attracting foreign direct investment for the export sector. The analysis shows that the signaling effect can be so important that the choice of a delegation may affect the probability of attracting foreign direct investment even if the intrinsic usefulness of delegation members is zero. There is an indication that the predicted correlation between the relevance of delegations and world salaries can be observed for President Lula 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>administration.</b> ...|$|R
