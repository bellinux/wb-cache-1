5|$|In 2000, an {{atmospheric}} feature {{formed in}} the southern hemisphere that is similar in appearance to the Great Red Spot, but smaller. This was created when several smaller, white oval-shaped storms merged to form a single feature—these three smaller white ovals were first observed in 1938. The merged feature was named Oval BA, and has been nicknamed Red Spot Junior. It has since increased in intensity and changed <b>color</b> <b>from</b> white to red.|$|E
5|$|It's a touching, believable, often funny but {{ultimately}} sad tale {{of how one}} class {{can take advantage of}} another, even in the guise of patronizing benevolence. Though sometimes shifting abruptly in time, Vanaja is an arresting story of modern-day hardship and class exploitation, recalling Charles Dickens as well as Western fairy-tale lore. Domalpalli's settings are ultra-real in detail and <b>color,</b> <b>from</b> the crude, almost feudal deprivations of Vanaja's dirt-floor background to the stately rituals and autocratic entitlement of the well-to-do.|$|E
5|$|Novisuccinea chittenangoensis {{has a small}} (an {{average of}} 20.9mm in length in adult individuals), delicate, ovate shell of 3¼ whorls, with deep sutures. The shell is almost translucent, and varies in <b>color</b> <b>from</b> a chalky pale yellow to white, with a glossy surface. Several {{internal}} organs of the animal can be distinguished through the shell's outer surface. The visible soft parts of the animal are of a pale subtranslucent yellow color, with different markings during distinct stages of development.|$|E

5|$|Similar {{to single}} interstitials, divacancies {{do not produce}} photoluminescence. Divacancies, in turn, anneal out at ~900°C {{creating}} multivacancy chains detected by EPR and presumably hexavacancy rings. The latter should be invisible to most spectroscopies, and indeed, {{they have not been}} detected thus far. Annealing of vacancies changes diamond <b>color</b> <b>from</b> green to yellow-brown. Similar mechanism (vacancy aggregation) is also believed to cause brown color of plastically deformed natural diamonds.|$|E
5|$|The inner {{peridium}} {{is a thin}} shiny {{tissue that}} is depressed into areas demarcated by the pyramidal plates. The puffball base, which occupies about a third to {{a quarter of the}} bottom of the fruit body, consists of moderately-sized chambers that persist even after the gleba has matured and the spores have dispersed. The base can assume a purplish hue after weathering. The base is rooted into the soil with rhizomorphs. Initially white, the gleba turns <b>color</b> <b>from</b> yellow to golden brown to dark brown as the spores mature. As the gleba dries, the inner peridium dries and cracks, exposing the spore mass in cracks between the scales. The gleba is supported by a yellowish-brown to light brown subgleba.|$|E
5|$|The {{spore print}} has been {{reported}} as ranging in <b>color</b> <b>from</b> pinkish, to pinkish-brown, to rosy brown, to vinaceous-fawn. The variation in spore print color results in part from differences in moisture content when recorded. Spores are roughly oblong to oval, smooth, hyaline (translucent) to pale brown, and measure 11–17 by 4–5.5µm. They are covered in a gelatinous sheath. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, two- and four-spored, thin-walled, and measure 25–35 by 10–14µm. Pleurocystidia (found on the tube walls) are roughly cylindrical to fuse-shaped with rounded tips, and measure 37–50 by 5–8µm. Cheilocystidia (on the tube edges) are fuse-shaped with a central swelling, thin-walled, and measure 23–40 by 6–8µm. Caulocystidia {{at the top of}} the stipe have various shapes and dimensions of 25–45 by 10–15µm; at the stipe base, the caulocystidia are 30–40 by 7–23µm and are mostly club-shaped to roughly spherical to tear-shaped. The cap cuticle comprises a single layer of tangled hyphae that are 4–6µm thick.|$|E

5|$|The spores are spherical, and ornamented with warts and ridges {{that form}} a partial {{reticulum}} (a net-like pattern of lines) with prominences up to 2µm high. They are hyaline (translucent), amyloid (meaning they will absorb iodine when stained with Melzer's reagent), and measure 7.5–10.0 by 7–9.5µm. The cap cuticle is a trichoderm. The basidia (the spore-bearing cells) are 38–56 by 10–13µm, club-shaped, four-spored, and hyaline when mounted in a dilute solution of potassium hydroxide (KOH). There are abundant cheilocystidia (cystidia {{found on the}} edge of gills), with contents ranging in <b>color</b> <b>from</b> dingy yellow to hyaline in KOH. They measure 32–50 by 3-6µm, and may be shaped somewhat like a spindle (tapered on each end) or a cylinder, or they may be flexuous (winding from side to side). The pleurocystidia (cystidia found on the gill face) are , 2.5–5µm in diameter, and rare to scattered.|$|E
5|$|Unveiled in 1989, the new {{lighting}} arrangement {{required the}} removal of the contour-outlining light bulbs and the installation of 176floodlights in and around the tower's frame. From dusk to midnight, the floodlights illuminate the entire tower. Sodium vapor lamps are used from 2 October to 6 July to cover the tower in an orange <b>color.</b> <b>From</b> 7 July to 1 October, the lights are changed to metal halide lamps to illuminate the tower with a white color. The reasoning behind the change is a seasonal one. Ishii reasoned that orange is a warmer color and helps to offset the cold winter months. Conversely, white is thought a cool color that helps during the hot summer months.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the episode}} was filmed on the Daedalus set. Due to that, visual effects were {{required}} {{to fill in the}} external shots. The episode was reportedly {{one of the most expensive}} VFX budgets in the series, and is the most expensive for the season. The star map behind the captain's chair of the Daedalus is usually lit green. However, the episode's writer and supervising producer, Alan McCullough, deliberately turned the map 90 degrees and changed the <b>color</b> <b>from</b> green to orange, so as to make the ship different from the normal Daedalus. McCullough also stated that the episode is a one-off, but did not rule out a return beyond the fifth season. He also said that he originally planned the team to visit a reality where the Ancients won the war against the Wraith, but this idea was dropped as it would detract from the main storyline. The episode was Jason Momoa's first appearance with his customised wig. After he had his hair cut by the time the fourth season was completed, for the first three episodes he had it sewn back on. However, when SCI FI wouldn't allow his hairstyle to be changed, they switched to the wig after Momoa complained about the pain of having his hair sewn on again.|$|E

5|$|Petter's big-footed mouse is a {{terrestrial}} rodent {{with short}} forelimbs and long hindfeet. With a head and body length of 150mm (5.9in) and body mass of 105g (3.7oz) {{in the only}} known complete specimen, it is much larger than M.bastardi, and its measurements fall {{at or above the}} upper end of the known range of variation in M.ingens. The upperparts are covered with soft and short, brown fur. Most cover hairs (the main part of the fur) are dark brown for the two-thirds closest to the base, then light brown, with a short dark brown tip. The middle of the back appears darker, because the cover hairs there are entirely dark brown. The hairs are 6 to 8mm (0.2 to 0.3in) long on the shoulders and 7 to 9mm (0.3 to 0.4in) on the back. The guard hairs are gray. Because the flanks lack entirely dark cover hairs, they are slightly lighter than the rest of the upperparts. They are sharply separated in <b>color</b> <b>from</b> the underparts, which are entirely white to buffish. The mystacial vibrissae (whiskers above the mouth) are long, up to 60mm (2.4in), and white or black in color. The pinnae (external ears) are dark brown and covered with fine gray hairs, and ear length is 32mm (1.3in).|$|E
