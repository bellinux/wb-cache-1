5|$|Lisa hates {{her role}} as a homemaker, and realizing that her future dreams have been shattered, she loses {{interest}} in being a good student. Bart enjoys spending time with the police, and he even ends up stopping Snake during a car chase. When Principal Skinner discovers Bart's new interest in law enforcement, he enlists him as a hall monitor. Bart starts handing out demerits to his classmates for minor infractions and has order restored to the school. When Lisa secretly steals all of the Teachers' Editions of the schoolbooks and reveals the teachers' lack of education, it is up to Bart to figure out who stole the books. Realizing his sister is the culprit, Bart takes the blame and returns to his life as a bad student and detention regular, while Lisa goes back to being a good student. As Bart spents his time in detention, Lisa plays her saxophone outside his <b>classroom</b> <b>to</b> comfort him.|$|E
5|$|One day, Zhou surprises the {{children}} with a written exam and leaves the <b>classroom</b> <b>to</b> speak with a visitor. Wang's son, Wang Gui (王贵), tricks their maid's son, Yue Fei, into completing their assignment while they go outside to play. After easily finishing the task at hand, Yue writes a heroic poem on a whitewashed wall and signs it with his name. The children then burst into the classroom upon learning of Zhou's forthcoming return and tell Yue to escape {{in order to avoid}} apprehension. The old teacher eventually discovers the ruse and, after marveling at Yue's impromptu ballad, asks Yue to fetch his mother, Lady Yao (姚夫人), for an important meeting. With the entire Wang household assembled in the main hall, Zhou asks the Lady for her blessing to have the boy as his adopted son and student. She consents and Yue takes his seat amongst Zhou's students the following morning. Because Zhou knows Yue is poor, he commands the four students to become sworn brothers. Zhou also begins to teach Yue all of the eighteen weapons of war.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} premiered on MTV Live on May 12, 1998. The clip {{starts with the}} rising of the sun, until it {{progresses}} into the Koyaanisqatsi inspired section, featuring time-lapse images of daily life, from people riding a subway, ordering food, bowling, and children in a <b>classroom</b> <b>to</b> sped-up city-scapes and freeways at night. Interspersed in the scenes is Madonna dancing and singing the track, her image partially merged with {{the backdrop of the}} fast-sped cityscape. During the intermediate verse the high-speed motion stops with the camera focusing on Madonna only against a sunset backdrop but quickly speeds up again. As the clip continues into nightfall, high-speed images of Madonna dancing in a discothèque is shown, with the camera focusing on the revelers, until she is seen falling asleep on the dance floor, and a revolving shot of planet Earth.|$|E

25|$|Research {{has also}} shown a {{correlation}} between goal orientation and the occurrence of academic cheating. Students who perceive their <b>classroom</b> <b>to</b> have high mastery goals {{are less likely to}} engage in cheating than those who perceive their <b>classroom</b> <b>to</b> emphasize performance goals. In other words, students who are encouraged to learn for the sake of learning and who exhibit an intrinsic value of education are less likely to cheat than those who are encouraged primarily by grades and other extrinsic rewards.|$|E

25|$|When Suzuki entered {{school he}} became aware that his family was very poor. Suzuki was {{sensitive}} and kind but prone to quick bursts of anger. The other boys ridiculed him for his shaved head and for being {{the son of a}} priest.

His teacher told him that he should grow up to be a great man, and to do this he needed to leave Kanagawa Prefecture and study hard.|$|E
50|$|But most importantly, {{the school}} needs more <b>classroom</b> space <b>to</b> handle the {{increased}} enrollment.

Once these new classrooms are built, Saturday programs can be added. These would be in computers, arts and crafts, English games, and add special programs introducing career opportunities with talks from successful local businessmen and professionals.|$|R

25|$|A {{call for}} {{additional}} ammunition for {{police officers in}} case of a shootout came at 12:20p.m. The killers had ceased shooting just minutes earlier. Authorities reported pipe bombs by 1:00p.m., and two SWAT teams entered the school at 1:09p.m., moving from <b>classroom</b> <b>to</b> classroom, discovering hidden students and faculty. All students, teachers, and school employees were taken away, questioned, and offered medical care in small holding areas before being bussed to meet with their family members at Leawood Elementary. By 3:00p.m., Dave Sanders had died of his injuries before SWAT officers could take him to get medical care. He was the only teacher to die in the shooting. Officials found the bodies in the library by 3:30p.m.|$|E
25|$|The wedge {{strategy}} details {{a simultaneous}} assault on state boards of education, {{state and federal}} legislatures and on the print and broadcast media. The Discovery Institute has carried out the strategy through {{its role in the}} intelligent design movement, where it aggressively promoted ID and its Teach the Controversy campaign to the public, education officials and public policymakers. Intelligent design proponents, through the Discovery Institute, have employed a number of specific political strategies and tactics in their furtherance of their goals. These range from attempts at the state level to undermine or remove altogether the presence of evolutionary theory from the public school <b>classroom,</b> <b>to</b> having the federal government mandate the teaching of intelligent design, to 'stacking' municipal, county and state school boards with ID proponents.|$|E
25|$|The {{origins of}} amateur radio {{can be traced}} to the late 19th century, but amateur radio as practiced today began in the early 20th century. The First Annual Official Wireless Blue Book of the Wireless Association of America, {{produced}} in 1909, contains a list of amateur radio stations. This radio callbook lists wireless telegraph stations in Canada and the United States, including 89 amateur radio stations. As with radio in general, amateur radio was associated with various amateur experimenters and hobbyists. Amateur radio enthusiasts have significantly contributed to science, engineering, industry, and social services. Research by amateur operators has founded new industries, built economies, empowered nations, and saved lives in times of emergency. Ham radio can also be used in the <b>classroom</b> <b>to</b> teach English, map skills, geography, math, science, and computer skills.|$|E

25|$|Beck also hired {{a talented}} early {{graduate}} of the Academy, Joseph Henry, to return as a science teacher after he finished his studies at Union College in nearby Schenectady in a year. In addition to teaching science, Henry did research at the school {{with the help of}} his assistant and students. In 1827, he began experiments with electromagnetism, a recent discovery. He found ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet, and discovered electrical inductance. Often he would demonstrate these properties to students by using a wire routed around the <b>classroom</b> <b>to</b> make an iron bar ring a small bell. This was not only the prototype of the modern electric doorbell, the stronger electrical signal he was able to send over a wire eventually helped Samuel F.B. Morse develop the first practical telegraph. The same principle continues to make long-distance wired data transmission possible. He would later leave to take a position at Princeton University, and eventually became the Smithsonian Institution's first secretary.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} book, after seeing Harry fly masterfully {{his very first}} time on a broom, she {{recommends}} him to fill the position of Seeker on the Gryffindor Quidditch team and sends him a broom, even though first-year students are normally prohibited from playing the sport or owning brooms. Despite {{the fact that she}} can often be heard to caution Lee Jordan's biased remarks while commenting Hogwart's Quidditch matches, it is often indirectly revealed that McGonagall herself is an avid Quidditch fan, resulting in a few occasions of her dropping her usual demeanour. Furthermore, although a rigorous disciplinarian, she often assists Harry indirectly with activities that are not strictly within the rules of Hogwarts; for example, she allows Harry and his friends to use the Transfiguration <b>classroom</b> <b>to</b> practice for tasks in the Triwizard Tournament. She promises Harry she would do everything in her power to help him to achieve his goal of becoming an auror, and she keeps her promise. Despite her stern front, McGonagall is shown to have good intentions at heart and has been known to display a range of emotions, which can often be a shock to her colleagues and students.|$|E
25|$|As a {{young man}} John Schofield was educated in the public schools, helped his family farm and build their home, and then {{surveyed}} land in northern Wisconsin before spending a year teaching school in Oneco, Illinois not far from Freeport. Then U.S. Rep. Thomas J. Turner secured John Schofield an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point. He sold land for travel expenses and reported on June 1, 1849. In his final year at the Academy, while a teaching assistant in the mathematics section, cadet Schofield was accused of allowing others in his <b>classroom</b> <b>to</b> make offensive jokes and drawings on the blackboard. He was dismissed from West Point, but after meeting with Illinois' U.S. Senator Stephen A. Douglas, appealed the decision to the Secretary of War, who referred the matter back to a Board of Inquiry at the Academy. A majority of the review board voted to rescind the expulsion, {{but one of the}} two officers who voted to sustain it, cavalry and artillery instructor Lt. George H. Thomas, later became a commander of Schofield during the Civil War. Although Schofield's eventual memoirs did not mention Thomas on the review board, his persistent criticism of Thomas's generalship after the war may reflect this incident. Schofield graduated in 1853, ranking seventh in his class, and was commissioned a brevet second lieutenant in the artillery.|$|E
