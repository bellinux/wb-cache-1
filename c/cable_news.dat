5|$|In 2002, Tina Fey, {{then head}} writer of Saturday Night Live (SNL), pitched {{the idea for}} a series about a <b>cable</b> <b>news</b> network to NBC, who {{rejected}} it. Two years later, Fey approached NBC with a similar idea: a behind-the-scenes look at The Girlie Show, a television show similar to SNL. NBC approved the series in May 2006 and production began shortly after. Although the episode received generally positive reviews, it finished third in its timeslot among all viewers and among adults aged 18 to 49. Critics praised the performances of Jack McBrayer and Jane Krakowski, who played Kenneth Parcell and Jenna Maroney, respectively.|$|E
5|$|In its 2007 expose , the {{political}} weekly Tehelka released hidden camera footage of {{several members of}} the Bharatiya Janata Party, Vishwa Hindu Parishad and the Bajrang Dal admitting their role in the riots. While the report was criticised for being politically motivated, some newspapers said the revelations simply reinforced what was common knowledge. Several inaccuracies in the statements cast doubt on the sting operation. Bajrangi and Suresh Richard said that Narendra Modi visited Naroda Patiya a day after the massacre to thank them, but the official record shows that Modi did not visit Naroda Patiya. The Gujarat government blocked <b>cable</b> <b>news</b> channels from broadcasting the expose, an action which was criticised by the Editors Guild of India.|$|E

The media coverage resulted in knowledge of Richard spreading world-wide, with interest in her expressed in Yugoslavia, Croatia, Australia, and Africa. Approximately a thousand people attended anniversary masses there in both 1991 and 1999, with about 400 attending in 2007, and thousands come to her grave each year, including chartered buses from New Orleans.|$|E

As part of the contract, Fey was to develop a prime-time project to be produced by Broadway Video and NBC Universal. The pilot, directed by Adam Bernstein, centered on Liz Lemon, the head writer of a variety show on NBC, and how she managed her relationships with the show's volatile stars and the new head of the network. In October 2006, the pilot aired on NBC as 30 Rock. Although the episode received generally favorable reviews, it finished third in its timeslot.|$|E

Shocked Americans gathered around television sets in homes and shopping centers. Some cited the alleged Curse of Tippecanoe, and others recalled the assassinations of Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr. Newspapers printed extra editions and used gigantic headlines; the United States Senate adjourned, interrupting debate of Reagan's economic proposals; and churches held prayer services.|$|E

According to Condit, there were about a hundred reporters camped out in front of his apartment during the morning of September 11, 2001, but they all left after news spread about that day's terrorist attacks in New York and Washington. Media critics and <b>cable</b> <b>news</b> executives later cited the Levy case, as well as the concurrent sensationalist coverage of a string of shark attacks, as a reflection of the manner of news coverage in the United States before the September 11 attacks had taken priority.|$|E

40|$|Much recent {{debate in}} {{political}} communication {{has centered on}} the influence of ideologically oriented media outlets. Some argue that the current media environment is creating partisan echo chambers, while others contend that today’s political media afford citizens increased contact with a diverse range of opinion. The current study seeks to clarify relationships between political ideology, conservative <b>cable</b> TV <b>news</b> viewing (i. e., FOX News), and liberal <b>cable</b> TV <b>news</b> viewing (i. e., MSNBC), arguing that ideology serves as a suppressor {{of the relationship between the}} two seemingly disparate forms of <b>cable</b> TV <b>news</b> consumption. Analyses of primary 2009 - 2010 statewide survey data (N = 305) reveal the relationship between FOX News and MSNBC consumption to be positive and this association increases substantially once the role of ideology as suppressor is addressed.

40|$|American <b>cable</b> {{television}} <b>news</b> {{has emerged}} as one of the most important and contested media genres in the United States over the past three and a half decades. In this dissertation, I examine <b>cable</b> television <b>news</b> in the 1990 s, a transformative period of industrial and cultural change, and consider how the continuous, 24 -hour coverage of the genre represented, constructed and problematized "history". By packaging history as a programming form that I term "historicizing news programs (HNPs) " at the beginning of the decade, 24 -hour <b>cable</b> television <b>news</b> created a framework that brought cohesion to its continual coverage and brought together viewers, producers, events and time into a coherent whole. By the end of the decade, political and technological pressures lead to fundamental changes in the workings of the <b>cable</b> television <b>news</b> genre and its use of history. My dissertation is one of the first to consider 1990 s television news from a critical humanities/media studies perspective and will help open new avenues for scholars to think about genre and its relationship to history. 	First, I explain how my study of television news is in the tradition of media studies and its views of historiography in contrast to journalism studies, communication studies and other scholarship that focus on television as primarily a technology of instantaneity and presence. Using textual, discourse, and institutional analysis of written and visual texts and other artifacts, I then provide four in-depth case studies for how depictions of history worked industrially and culturally during the 1990 s. The first looks at the rise of HNPs following the 1991 Gulf War on CNN. The second shows the spread of HNPs to sports <b>cable</b> television <b>news</b> and how they provided a point of contrast with the liveness that defined the genre. The last two case studies show the shift in how history was performed by <b>cable</b> television <b>news,</b> with the third explaining the politicization of history due to the political conflict of the Culture Wars and the fourth the outsourcing of history into the "cloud" due to the disruptive force of new media technologies...|$|R
