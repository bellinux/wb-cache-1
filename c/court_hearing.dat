5|$|During the {{petition}} drive, national organizations {{on both the}} gun rights and gun control sides became involved by providing mailings and donations. Once {{the petition}}s were submitted, Morse and Giron challenged the effort in court, but were denied the injunction that they had requested from the court. A further <b>court</b> <b>hearing</b> resulted in the election being conducted in-person rather than by mail, which also led to Giron complaining of voter suppression.|$|E

5|$|On 26 April 2007, {{the pier}} was closed by the {{government}} to enable land reclamation, soon after the adjacent Star Ferry pier was closed. There was fierce opposition by conservationists, who carried over their campaign to preserve the landmark. Police officers evicted some 30 protesters from the site on 1 August 2007; activists filed for a judicial review, and the High <b>Court</b> <b>hearing</b> began on 7 August. On 10 August, the court dismissed the request.|$|E

Having been tipped off {{by the arrival of}} police and helicopters that a bombing suspect was inside, a restless crowd began to gather outside the jail. While McVeigh's requests for a bulletproof vest or transport by helicopter were denied, authorities did use a helicopter to transport him from Perry to Oklahoma City.|$|E

5|$|Blythe's {{defense team}} {{attacked}} {{differences between the}} testimonies the witnesses gave after the incident in 2010 and at the court. Among other things, one of the witnesses originally alleged that Nosek and Blythe shook hands or {{that one of them}} offered hand to another on stage; however, at the <b>court</b> <b>hearing,</b> he testified that there was no prior contact between them. Blythe also argued that video evidence shown in court refuted claims about his aggressive behavior.|$|E
5|$|On 22 June, {{seven of}} the {{defendants}} were sentenced to life imprisonment, four to fifteen years in prison, {{two to five years}} and one to two years. After they protested loudly when the sentence was read, they were forcibly removed from the court. Amnesty International concluded that an appeal session on 6 September had heard no evidence to support charges. The military appeal <b>court</b> <b>hearing</b> on 28 September took a few minutes before the court upheld all the convictions. In November, the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry asked for a retrial in civilian courts, because they were convicted in military courts.|$|E

Pearson, against the company to revoke its contract or to force it into receivership so a receiver could negotiate with the strikers. The first <b>court</b> <b>hearing</b> was held on November 4, but the judge put the case on hold until the strike could be resolved. The case was later annulled on November 7 when the same judge ruled that Pearson had no standing to bring such a suit before the court.|$|E
5|$|While free on bail, Vick tested {{positive}} for marijuana in a random drug test. This {{was a violation of}} the conditions of his release while awaiting sentencing in federal court. Vick's positive urine sample was submitted on September 13, 2007, according to a document filed by a federal probation officer on September 26. As a result, Hudson ordered Vick confined to his Hampton, Virginia home between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. with electronic monitoring until his <b>court</b> <b>hearing</b> date in December. He was ordered to submit to random drug testing.|$|E
5|$|In October 1984, Gardner killed Melvyn John Otterstrom {{during a}} robbery in Salt Lake City.

Convicted of {{two counts of}} murder, Gardner {{was sentenced to life}} imprisonment for the first count and received the death penalty for the second. The state adopted more stringent security measures {{as a result of the}} incident at the courthouse. While held at Utah State Prison, Gardner was charged with another capital crime for stabbing an inmate in 1994. However, that charge was thrown out by the Utah Supreme Court because the victim survived.|$|E

By noon that day, Ike was still drinking and once again armed, {{in violation of the}} city ordinance against carrying firearms in the city. He told others he was looking for Holliday or an Earp. At about 1:00 pm, Virgil and Morgan Earp surprised Ike on 4th Street where Virgil pistol whipped him from behind. Disarming him, the Earps took Ike to appear before Judge Wallace for violating the ordinance. Wyatt waited with Clanton while Virgil went to find Judge Wallace so the <b>court</b> <b>hearing</b> could be held.|$|E
5|$|On March 21, 2016, the Attorney General {{announced}} a partial settlement of its lawsuit, under which DraftKings and FanDuel agreed to cease offering paid {{games in the}} state of New York, and abide by the result of an upcoming appeals <b>court</b> <b>hearing.</b> The hearings, which would determine whether the services would have to pay restitution, were tentatively scheduled for September 2016â€”assuming that legislation legalizing daily fantasy sports was not passed by then. DraftKings and FanDuel spokespersons stated that the companies were working with local officials and supporting legislation to legalize DFS under state law. This settlement does not address the false advertising claims, which are still being pursued. The next day, Yahoo announced that it would voluntarily comply with the settlement and also cease offering paid games {{in the state of}} New York.|$|E
5|$|When {{asked why}} she did not {{immediately}} inform the police of Lucan's presence, Susan Maxwell-Scott said {{she had not seen}} any newspapers or television news, or listened to any radio broadcasts that might have warned her of the importance of his visit. Meanwhile, Lucan's children were taken by their aunt, Lady Sarah Gibbs, to her home in Guilsborough, Northamptonshire, where they would remain for several weeks. On the day Veronica Lucan was discharged from hospital, a High <b>Court</b> <b>hearing</b> confirmed that the children could return to live with her. Repeated press intrusions later forced the family to move to a friend's home in Plymouth.|$|E

5|$|As Lucan's {{bankruptcy}} proceeded, in August 1975 his creditors {{were informed}} that the missing earl had unsecured debts of Â£45,000 and preferential liabilities for Â£1,326. His assets were estimated at Â£22,632. The family silver was sold in March 1976 for around Â£30,000. His remaining debts were repaid by the Lucan family trust {{in the years immediately}} following his disappearance. His family was granted probate over his estate in 1999, but no death certificate was issued, and his heir, George Bingham, Lord Bingham, was refused permission to take his father's title and seat in the House of Lords. Following the passage of the Presumption of Death Act 2013, Bingham began a new attempt to have his father declared dead, which proved successful in a High <b>Court</b> <b>hearing</b> at the Rolls Building on 3 February 2016. He therefore inherited his father's title, becoming the 8th Earl of Lucan.|$|E
5|$|Dusten Brown is {{a member}} of the Cherokee Nation. Brown served in the United States Army at Fort Sill, Oklahoma. Christina Maldonado was a non-Indian single mother of two. Brown and Maldonado became engaged to be married in December 2008, and Maldonado {{informed}} Brown that she was pregnant in January 2009. On learning that Maldonado was pregnant, Brown began to press her to go ahead and marry him, and refused to provide any financial support until after the two had married. In May 2009, Maldonado broke off the engagement by text message and cut all communications with Brown. In June, Maldonado sent Brown a text message asking if he would rather pay child support or relinquish his parental rights. Brown responded via text message that he relinquished his rights. No child support order was in place at this time. Furthermore, while laws vary from state to state, it is generally impossible for any parent, male or female, to surrender their parental rights without a <b>court</b> <b>hearing</b> that determines the best interest of the child. A father cannot terminate his parental rights by contract, much less by more informal means (such as by text message).|$|E

AtlÃ©tico Madrid, Zaragoza, Osasuna and former club Celta Vigo were all rumoured to be interested in signing Mido, with AtlÃ©tico's interest being confirmed by their Technical Director Toni MuÃ±oz. Meanwhile, Mido was caught speeding on the way to Marseille's game against AS Monaco, which resulted in a <b>court</b> <b>hearing.</b> Reports suggested Roma were ready to sign Mido for a fee of â‚¬9million even though Mido would be out injured for the rest of the French football season. Turkish side BeÅŸiktaÅŸ revealed they wanted to sign him, and Mido said he was to have talks with Bobby Robson about a possible move to Newcastle United.|$|E
