60|$|One day, {{during a}} visit to the city of Buenos Ayres, I {{discovered}} in a mean street, {{in the southern part of}} the town, a second-hand bookshop, kept by an old snuffy spectacled German in a long shabby black coat. I remember him well because he was a very important person to me. It was the first shop of the kind I had seen--I doubt if there was another in the town; and to be allowed to rummage by the hour among this mass of old books on the dusty shelves and heaped on the brick floor was a novel and delightful experience. The books were mostly in Spanish, French, and German, but there were some in English, and among them I came upon Thomson's Seasons. I remember the thrill of joy I experienced when I snatched up the small thin octavo in its smooth <b>calf</b> <b>binding.</b> It was the first book in English I ever bought, and to this day when I see a copy of the Seasons on a bookstall, which is often enough, I cannot keep my fingers off it and find it hard to resist the temptation to throw a couple of shillings away and take it home. If shillings had not been wanted for bread and cheese I should have had a roomful of copies by now.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Sanderson {{mentioned}} by {{name a few}} of the great binders such as Le Gascon, and some of the patrons of bookbinding like the Medicis, Grolier, and the wonderful women who so loved books that they lent them some of the perfume and grace of their own strange lives. However, the historical part of the lecture was very inadequate, possibly necessarily so through the limitations of time. The really elaborate part of the lecture was the practical exposition. Mr. Sanderson described and illustrated the various processes of smoothing, pressing, cutting, paring, and the like. He divided bindings into two classes, the useful and the beautiful. Among the former he reckoned paper covers such as the French use, paper boards and cloth boards, and half leather or <b>calf</b> <b>bindings.</b> Cloth he disliked as a poor material, the gold on which soon fades away. As for beautiful bindings, in them 'decoration rises into enthusiasm.' A beautiful binding is 'a homage to genius.' It has its ethical value, its spiritual effect. 'By doing good work we raise life to a higher plane,' said the lecturer, and he dwelt with loving sympathy on the fact that a book is 'sensitive by nature,' that it is made by a human being for a human being, that the design must 'come from the man himself, and express the moods of his imagination, the joy of his soul.' There must, consequently, be no division of labour. 'I make my own paste and enjoy doing it,' said Mr. Sanderson as he spoke of the necessity for the artist doing the whole work with his own hands. But before we have really good bookbinding we must have a social revolution. As things are now, the worker diminished to a machine is the slave of the employer, and the employer bloated into a millionaire is the slave of the public, and the public is the slave of its pet god, cheapness. The bookbinder of the future is to be an educated man who appreciates literature and has freedom for his fancy and leisure for his thought.|$|R
6000|$|J----- and I {{returned}} {{along the}} Champs Elysees, and, crossing the Seine, kept {{on our way}} by the river's brink, looking at the titles of books on the long lines of stalls that extend between the bridges. Novels, fairy-tales, dream books, treatises of behavior and etiquette, collections of bon-mots and of songs, were interspersed with volumes in the old style of <b>calf</b> and gilt <b>binding,</b> {{the works of the}} classics of French literature. A good many persons, of the poor classes, and of those apparently well to do, stopped transitorily to look at these books. On {{the other side of the}} street was a range of tall edifices with shops beneath, and the quick stir of French life hurrying, and babbling, and swarming along the sidewalk. We passed two or three bridges, occurring at short intervals, and at last we recrossed the Seine by a bridge which oversteps the river, from a point near the National Institute, and reaches the other side, not far from the Louvre.

40|$|Chemotherapy {{is one of}} {{the primary}} {{treatment}} mechanisms for treating cancer. Current chemotherapy is systemically delivered and causes significant side effects; therefore the development of new chemotherapeutic agents or enhancing the effectiveness of current chemotherapeutic could prove vital to patients and cancer care. The purpose of this research was to develop a new conjugate composed of doxorubicin (chemotherapeutic) and inulin (polysaccharide chain) and evaluate its potential as a new therapeutic agent for cancer treatment. The synergistic effect of inulin conjugated to doxorubicin has allowed the same cytotoxic response to be maintained or improved at lower doses as compared to doxorubicin. Supporting results include cytotoxicity profiles, <b>calf</b> thymus DNA <b>binding</b> studies, confocal microscopy, and transport studies. Key words: Inulin-Doxorubicin-Drug resistance-Conjugate-Cytotoxicity. Mutations to a healthy cell’s DNA eventually allows them to acquire the hallmarks of cancer: sustained angiogenesis, limitless replication potential, tissue invasion and metastasis, insensitivity to anti-growth signals, self-sufficiency in growth signals, and evading apoptosis [1, 2]. After surgery, adjuvant treatment with chemotherapy is routinely used because it is most effective after surgical removal due to decreased tumor burden, increased blood profusion to the surgical site, and increased number of proliferating cells. Unfortunately, drug resistanc...|$|R
40|$|Bovine Neonatal Pancytopenia is a {{bleeding}} disorder {{occurring in the}} European Union and New Zealand. The disease affects neonatal or very young calves from PregSure® BVD vaccinated dams. Dams produce alloantibodies against impurities from the MDBK cell line on which PregSure® is produced, including MHC 1, present in PregSure® BVD vaccine. Only dams not recognizing the proteins as self produce those alloantibodies. If a calf produced by such a dam inherits paternal antigens resembling those present in PregSure® BVD and it receives colostrum from its own dam, the alloantibodies present in the sera and colostrum of the dam target the leukocytes, thrombocytes and haematopoietic bone marrow cells of the <b>calf.</b> After <b>binding</b> of the alloantibodies to the cells, the cells undergo phagocytosis through macrophages by complement activation. This results in bone marrow aplasia and haemorrhagic diathesis. Most of the affected calves die, but spontaneous recovery is possible and also subclinical Bovine Neonatal Pancytopenia occurs. The disease Bovine Neonatal Pancytopenia is actually a severe adverse reaction to PregSure® BVD vaccine. This research internship report analyses the process of pharmacovigilance of PregSure® BVD vaccine and follows the developments around the vaccine and the disease through the years. Pharmacovigilance is applied to each veterinary medicine {{on the market and}} the process guards the balance between risk and benefits of medicines. Aetiology and pathogenesis of Bovine Neonatal Pancytopenia is investigated thoroughly in the last decade, but still the exact cause of the disease is unknown. It is also not clear which protein or proteins is or are the exact target or targets of the colostrum derived alloantibodies of BNP-dams. Further investigation is necessary because Bovine Neonatal Pancytopenia is the first frequently occurring immunodeficiency caused by a prophylactic measurement like the PregSure® BVD vaccine. Development of the same pathogenesis in the future with other vaccines, human or animal, produced on the same production cell line as the target species can be prevented by extensive knowledge of the pathogenesis and aetiology of Bovine Neonatal Pancytopenia...|$|R
40|$|The 160 - 170 {{sequence}} of {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) - 1 gp 120 mimics a nicotinic receptor-binding motif of rabies virus glycoprotein and snake neurotoxins. This sequence has been proposed {{to be involved in}} the binding of HIV- 1 gp 120 to the acetylcholine binding sites of nicotinic receptors. By using biomolecular interaction analysis (BIA) technology we have found that HIV- 1 gp 120 can bind to detergent-extracted nicotinic receptor from fetal <b>calf</b> muscle. The <b>binding</b> is inhibited by nicotine and by a synthetic peptide reproducing the gp 120 160 - 170 sequence. The molecular mimicry between gp 120 and rabies virus glycoprotein is confirmed by cross-reacting antibodies. We have found that vaccination against rabies can induce the production of anti-HIV- 1 gp 120 antibodies in humans. The cross-reacting antibodies are directed to the gp 120 sequence involved in the mimicry with the rabies virus glycoprotein. The cross-reactivity between the rabies virus and HIV- 1 has important implications in transfusion medicine. Moreover, the presence of cross-reacting antibodies between the nicotinic receptor binding site of rabies virus glycoprotein and a fragment of HIV- 1 gp 120 strengthens the hypothesis about the possible role of nicotinic receptors as potential receptors for HIV- 1 in the central nervous system...|$|R
40|$|The {{exhibition}} {{was held in}} the Rare Books Exhibition space, Sir Louis Matheson Library, Monash University from 16 July - 21 September 1992. Any institution that has serious teaching and research programmes devoted to the eighteenth century in France is likely to acquire for its library original editions illustrated by some of the masters of that time. The reason for this departure from the austerity of plain texts is simple. Taking advantage of the European pre-eminence of Paris in the luxury trades, and not least in engraving, booksellers produced in the decades after 1750 splendid and abundantly decorated sets of standard authors and of reference works. When the Monash University Library was building up its basic collections in the 1960 s and 1970 s, it naturally purchased - on more favourable terms than are available now - a respectable number of these foundation volumes. Thus, beyond information useful to scholars concerned with the history of Enlightenment literature and thought, we have a corpus of working copies that demonstrate nonetheless the attractions of book production in a period attached to elegance and aesthetic quality. The present exhibition is designed to reveal to the Library's users and visitors a substantial and mostly unsuspected resource for the study of eighteenth-century taste. As art historians know, engravings of the kind shown were, along with copies, the only way many drawings and paintings were made accessible to the contemporary public and indeed to that of more than one following generation. However, one {{does not have to be}} a student of late Baroque, Rococo or pre-Romantic art to enjoy the variety of images on display. It should be emphasized that the function of engraved illustrations in eighteenth-century books was far from merely decorative. Even headpieces, tailpieces and initials could be related to the subject matter of the text in hand. Copperplate engraving, which was the dominant medium in Enlightenment Paris despite a revival of wood-engraving, was particularly suitable and much used for technical, scientific and medical works. This aspect is not neglected in the various display cases. Overall the strength of the Paris engraving trade was a tremendous advantage to bookseller-publishers competing with pirates and reprinters in the French provinces and beyond the frontiers of the kingdom. The technical skills at the command of artists, engravers, printers and distributors meant that Paris could take on a role as the principal purveyor before 1789 of fine books. High-quality paper, richly tooled <b>calf</b> or morocco <b>bindings,</b> meticulous typography using new founts designed by innovators like Fournier, Didot and Baskerville and elaborate illustrations; these were competitive advantages that could hardly be matched elsewhere. The Parisians found their market niche, and their work lives on prized by bibliophiles and admired by casual viewers. Some items kindly loaned by private collector...|$|R
