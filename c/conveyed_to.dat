5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 1968 season, the MCC's public position followed the advice of Douglas-Home: it was unknown whether or not South Africa would accept D'Oliveira and it would be better not to press the issue. Even so, three key members of the MCC were aware of the reality of the situation. Vorster had avoided international condemnation as he had not publicly declared D'Oliveira unacceptable, but his stand had been clearly <b>conveyed</b> <b>to</b> London in private.|$|E
5|$|Fish ovaries may be {{of three}} types: gymnovarian, {{secondary}} gymnovarian or cystovarian. In the first type, the oocytes are released directly into the coelomic cavity and then enter the ostium, then through the oviduct and are eliminated. Secondary gymnovarian ovaries shed ova into the coelom from which they go directly into the oviduct. In the third type, the oocytes are <b>conveyed</b> <b>to</b> the exterior through the oviduct. Gymnovaries are the primitive condition found in lungfish, sturgeon, and bowfin. Cystovaries characterize most teleosts, where the ovary lumen has continuity with the oviduct. Secondary gymnovaries are found in salmonids {{and a few other}} teleosts.|$|E

5|$|Kourkouas assailed Edessa {{every year}} from 942 onward and devastated its countryside, {{as he had done}} at Melitene. Finally, its emir agreed to a peace, {{swearing}} not to raise arms against Byzantium and to hand over the Mandylion in exchange for the return of 200 prisoners. The Mandylion was <b>conveyed</b> <b>to</b> Constantinople, where it arrived on August 15, 944, on the feast of the Dormition of the Theotokos. A triumphal entry was staged for the venerated relic, which was then deposited in the Theotokos of the Pharos church, the palatine chapel of the Great Palace. As for Kourkouas, he concluded his campaign by sacking Bithra (modern Birecik) and Germanikeia (modern Kahramanmaraş).|$|E
5|$|Once, Veda {{left his}} ashram (hermitage), entrusting {{all of the}} {{administrative}} duties to Uttanka. Veda's wife was then in her menstrual period. The women of the ashram urged Uttanka to cohabit with her so that her fertility period would not be wasted, but Uttanka refused to oblige as he was duty bound to his guru and he considered the act immoral. When this episode was <b>conveyed</b> <b>to</b> Veda upon {{his return to the}} ashram, he was pleased with his disciple and blessed Uttanka.|$|E
5|$|Probably {{the most}} {{familiar}} form of cellular signaling is synaptic transmission, whereby a nerve impulse that has {{reached the end of}} one neuron is <b>conveyed</b> <b>to</b> an adjacent neuron via the release of neurotransmitters. This transmission is made possible by the action of synaptic vesicles loaded with the neurotransmitters to be released. These vesicles fuse with the cell membrane at the pre-synaptic terminal and release its contents to the exterior of the cell. The contents then diffuse across the synapse to the post-synaptic terminal.|$|E

The king's son, Charles II, later planned for an elaborate royal mausoleum to be erected in Hyde Park, London, but it was never built.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} of what coolant to use attracted more debate. The Metallurgical laboratory's first choice was helium, {{because it could}} be both a coolant and a neutron moderator. The difficulties of its use were not overlooked. Large quantities would be required, {{and it would have}} to be very pure, with no neutron-absorbing impurities. Special blowers would be required to circulate the gas through the reactor, and the problem of leakage of radioactive gases would have to be solved. None of these problems were regarded as insurmountable. The decision to use helium was <b>conveyed</b> <b>to</b> DuPont, the company responsible for building the production reactors, and was initially accepted.|$|E

5|$|Ultimately Hercule {{was forced}} to {{surrender}} after attempts to board Mars failed. Both ships were battered and burnt, with the French suffering at least 290 casualties and the British 90. Hercule was <b>conveyed</b> <b>to</b> Britain in the aftermath and later repaired and served in the Royal Navy until 1810. Both L'Héritier and the deceased Hood were highly praised for their conduct during the battle, which is noted as being a very rare example {{during this period of}} an action between two ships of approximately equal strength without any external influence.|$|E
5|$|After {{reading the}} report, an outraged Hermann Göring demanded 'at the highest level' the {{transfer}} of the airmen to Luftwaffe control. Unknown to all airmen except Lamason, their execution had been scheduled for 26 October, if they remained at Buchenwald. News of the airmen's scheduled execution had been <b>conveyed</b> <b>to</b> Lamason by a German political prisoner, Eugen Kogon, who had a reliable contact within the camp administrative area. Lamason discussed the information at length with Yeo-Thomas, Burney and Robert and they concluded there was little that could be done to avert the mass execution. Lamason decided not to inform the airmen, but to keep this information to himself to keep morale high and in the slight hope the Luftwaffe would intervene in time. On the night of 19 October, seven days before their scheduled execution, 156 of the 168 airmen, including Lamason, were transferred from Buchenwald to Stalag Luft III by the Luftwaffe.|$|E

5|$|As {{part of the}} {{scientific}} exchange, the Maud Committee's findings were <b>conveyed</b> <b>to</b> the United States. One of its members, the Australian physicist Mark Oliphant, flew to the United States in late August 1941 and discovered that data provided by the Maud Committee had not reached key American physicists. Oliphant then {{set out to find}} out why the committee's findings were apparently being ignored. He met with the Uranium Committee and visited Berkeley, California, where he spoke persuasively to Ernest O. Lawrence. Lawrence was sufficiently impressed to commence his own research into uranium. He in turn spoke to James B. Conant, Arthur H. Compton and George B. Pegram. Oliphant's mission was therefore a success; key American physicists were now aware of the potential power of an atomic bomb.|$|E
5|$|De Robeck hoisted his flag {{again in}} Ajax in February 1921 as he voyaged from Malta to Smyrna, Turkey, Constantinople, and Lemnos before the ship {{returned}} to Malta {{before the end}} of the month. During the Chanak Crisis, she was ordered to Smyrna in September 1922, together with much of the rest of the Mediterranean Fleet. After the Armistice of Mudanya ended the crisis, Ajax proceeded to Malta for a refit. When the last Sultan of the Ottoman Empire, Abdulmejid II, was deposed in 1923, he was <b>conveyed</b> <b>to</b> Mecca aboard Ajax. The ship returned to Devonport in April 1924 and was placed in reserve. She was paid off and placed on the disposal list in October 1926 to meet the tonnage limitations of the Washington Naval Treaty. On 10 December, Ajax was sold to the Alloa Shipbreaking Company and arrived at Rosyth four days later to be broken up.|$|E
5|$|Despite Mihardja's {{insistence that}} Atheis {{is meant to}} be realistic, several {{symbolic}} interpretations have been put forward. According to Mihardja, {{one of the most common}} interpretations readers <b>conveyed</b> <b>to</b> him was that Hasan's death symbolised atheism defeating religion, with Hasan's death as the death of theism. According to Maier, Atheis serves as an allegory for the development of the Indonesian nation. Hasan, representing traditionalism, is killed by the Japanese, who changed the status quo when they invaded in 1942. Meanwhile, the anarchistic Anwar finds himself without a place in the modern world. Only the responsible modern character, Rusli, is able to bring the Indonesian nation, as represented by Kartini, to terms with the new world.|$|E
