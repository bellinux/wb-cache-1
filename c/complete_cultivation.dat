Several methods, such as ripping and <b>complete</b> <b>cultivation,</b> {{are available to}} alleviate compaction that may occur {{as a result of}} soil reinstatement. This paper examines the effectiveness of the industry standard industrial ripper and a prototype modern ripper, the Mega-Lift, in comparison with the recommended best practice method of <b>complete</b> <b>cultivation.</b> An investigation of the penetration resistance of the soil at a restored sand and gravel quarry was carried out using a cone penetrometer and a ‘lifting driving tool’ (dropping weight penetrometer) 3 years following cultivation. All the cultivation treatments reduced soil compaction to some degree compared with the untreated control. However, the penetration resistance values suggest that rooting would be restricted at relatively shallow depths in the plots cultivated using the industrial and Mega-Lift ripper; penetration resistance exceeded 2 MPa within the first 0. 33 m. <b>Complete</b> <b>cultivation</b> maintained penetration resistance values of less than 2 MPa within the depth limit of the penetrometer of 0. 42 m. In addition, the results from the ‘lifting driving tool’ indicate that soils treated using <b>complete</b> <b>cultivation</b> remained significantly looser than those treated with the ripper to a depth of at least 0. 80 m. The results demonstrate that <b>complete</b> <b>cultivation</b> remains the most effective method of alleviating soil compaction on restored sites, although it is recognized that its relatively high cost may restrict the uptake of the technique...|$|E

In addition, the paper suggests the proper use of biological measures through artificial infection with Pyrenophora tritici repentis (Ptr) in years not favourable for facultative parasite development. Growing of the varieties not lower than 85 cm with optimal stem growth ratio in regions with 550 - 650 mm precipitation, deep and <b>complete</b> soil <b>cultivation</b> plus nutrition before sowing in late October reduced the risk of facultative parasite appearance on lower and middle leaves by over 15 %, which was considered useful because of the antagonism to obligate parasites. Severity of Puccinia triticina on last two leaves when facultative parasites were absent was increased at 60 - 70 % as maximal level according to suggested SAGR. Nevertheless, we suggest growing of varieties with prolonged latency period resistant to Puccinia triticina. The aim is to avoid overaccumulation of resistance genes consequential through the decrease of wheat grain yielding potential. Genes facilitating toxin from Ptr spreading have to be excluded because of necessary antagonistic effect from the middle leaves. This implies gene for the obligate parasite specific resistance diversity of varieties {{in order to reduce the}} probability of simultaneous overcoming of resistance and avoid insurmountable changes in seed production. The final result of the proposed system should be the last two leaves with mostly minimal parasite appearance and the possibility of economical and efficient single curative treatment application once in ten years when facultative parasites are absent in spring or after the resistance of variety is overcome in standard conditions. The practical aim was also dependent on leaf rust development and green leaf area dissapearence forecasting models as well as balance between the size of the farm and equipment due to short deadlines...|$|R

The aim of this work was to describe the Cd hyperaccumulation kinetics in the different plant organs, throughout the <b>complete</b> <b>cultivation</b> cycle, independently of a possible soil effect. Plants of Noccaea caerulescens were exposed in aeroponics to three constantly low Cd concentrations and harvested at 6 to 11 dates, until siliquae formation. Dry matter allocation between roots and shoots was constant over time and exposure concentrations, as well as Cd allocation. However 86 % of the Cd taken up was allocated to the shoots. Senescent rosette leaves showed similar Cd concentrations to the living ones, suggesting no redistribution from old to young organs. The Cd root influx was proportional to the exposure concentration and constant over time, indicating that plant development had no effect on this. The bio-concentration factor (BCF), i. e. [Cd](plant) /[Cd 2 +](solution) for the whole plant, roots or shoots was independent of the exposure concentration and of the plant stage.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} the {{modeling}} of a real-case problem where a farmer has {{to optimize the}} use of his/her land by selecting the best mix of crops to cultivate. Complexity {{of the problem is}} due to the several factors that have to be considered simultaneously. These include the market prices variability of harvested products, the specific resource requests for each crop, the restrictions caused by limited machines availability, and the timing of operations required to <b>complete</b> each crop <b>cultivation.</b> We provide two different mathematical formulations for the analyzed problem. The first one represents a natural integer programming formulation looking for the crop-mix that maximizes the farmer's expected profit measured as the difference between revenues obtained by selling the harvested products and the production costs. Since the revenue of each crop depends on the price as quoted at the exchange market and the yield per hectare of harvested product, we define it as a random variable. Then, the second model uses the maximization of the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) as objective function and looks for the crop-mix that allows to maximize the average expected profit under a predefined quantile of worst realizations. To test and compare the proposed models with the cultivation choice made by the farmer, we use Italian historical data represented by monthly returns of different crops over a time period of 16 years. Computational results emphasize the advantage of using the CVaR model for a risk-averse farmer and provide interesting insights for farmers involved in similar problems...|$|R

Several distinct mechanisms {{are used to}} transport secreted proteins via bacterial membranes, using various secreted systems. So far, six different bacterial secretion systems were discovered and described. Bacteria can transport proteins to extracellular matrix space via releasing membrane vesicles. Based on this phenomenon, some authors view the process of membrane vesicles release as the secretion system of bacteria. The bacteria membrane releases blebs which can contain various components including proteins, toxins, DNA, antimicrobials, antibiotic resistance determinants and others.

40|$|Knowledge of {{the energy}} saving night {{temperature}} (i. e. a relatively cool night temperature without affecting photosynthetic activity and physiology) and {{a better understanding of}} low night temperature effects on the photosynthetic physiology of Phalaenopsis would improve their production in terms of greenhouse temperature control and energy use. Therefore, Phalaenopsis 'Hercules' was subjected to day temperatures of 27. 5 degrees C and night temperatures of 27. 0 degrees C, 24. 2 degrees C, 21. 2 degrees C, 18. 3 degrees C, 15. 3 degrees C or 12. 3 degrees C in a growth chamber. A new tool for the determination {{of the energy}} saving night temperature range was developed based on temperature response curves of leaf net CO(2) exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence, organic acid content and carbohydrate concentrations. The newly developed method was validated during a <b>complete</b> vegetative <b>cultivation</b> in a greenhouse environment with eight Phalaenopsis hybrids (i. e. 'Boston', 'Bristol', 'Chalk Dust', 'Fire Fly', 'Lennestadt', 'Liverpool', 'Precious', 'Vivaldi') and day/night temperature set points of 28 / 28 degrees C, 29 / 23 degrees C and 29 / 17 degrees C. Temperature response curves revealed an overall energy saving night temperature range for nocturnal CO(2) uptake, carbohydrate metabolism, organic acid accumulation and photosystem II (PSII) photochemistry of 17. 1 degrees C to 19. 9 degrees C for Phalaenopsis 'Hercules'. At the lower end of this energy saving night temperature range, a high malate-to-citrate ratio switched towards a low ratio and this transition seemed to alleviate effects of night chilling induced photoinhibition. At night temperatures of 24 degrees C or higher, the degradation of starch, glucose and fructose indicated an increased respiratory CO(2) production. During the greenhouse validation experiment, the differences between the eight Phalaenopsis hybrids with regard to their response to the warm day/cool night temperature regimes were remarkably large. In general, the day/night temperature of 29 / 17 degrees C led to a significantly lower biomass accumulation and less leaves which were in addition shorter, narrower and smaller in size as compared to the day/night temperature regimes of 28 / 28 degrees C and 29 / 23 degrees C. During week 25 of the cultivation period, plants matured and flower initiation steeply increased for all hybrids and in each day/night temperature regime. Before week 25, early spiking was only sufficiently suppressed in the 29 / 23 degrees C and 29 / 17 degrees C temperature regimes for three hybrids ('Boston', 'Bristol' and 'Lennestadt') but not in the other five hybrids.

40|$|Background: The {{transition}} from a petroleum-based economy towards more sustainable bioprocesses {{for the production of}} fuels and chemicals (circular economy) is necessary to alleviate the impact of anthropic activities on the global ecosystem. Lignocellulosic biomass-derived sugars are suitable alternative feedstocks that can be fermented or biochemically converted to value-added products. An example is lactic acid, which is an essential chemical for the production of polylactic acid, a biodegradable bioplastic. However, lactic acid is still mainly produced by Lactobacillus species via fermentation of starch-containing materials, the use of which competes with the supply of food and feed. Results: A thermophilic and cellulolytic lactic acid producer was isolated from bean processing waste and was identified as a new strain of Bacillus coagulans, named MA- 13. This bacterium fermented lignocellulose-derived sugars to lactic acid at 55 °C and pH 5. 5. Moreover, it was found to be a robust strain able to tolerate high concentrations of hydrolysate obtained from wheat straw pre-treated by acid-catalysed (pre-) hydrolysis and steam explosion, especially when cultivated in controlled bioreactor conditions. Indeed, unlike what was observed in microscale <b>cultivations</b> (<b>complete</b> growth inhibition at hydrolysate concentrations above 50 %), B. coagulans MA- 13 was able to grow and ferment in 95 % hydrolysate-containing bioreactor fermentations. This bacterium was also found to secrete soluble thermophilic cellulases, which could be produced at low temperature (37 °C), still retaining an optimal operational activity at 50 °C. Conclusions: The above-mentioned features make B. coagulans MA- 13 an appealing starting point for future development of a consolidated bioprocess for production of lactic acid from lignocellulosic biomass, after further strain development by genetic and evolutionary engineering. Its optimal temperature and pH of growth match with the operational conditions of fungal enzymes hitherto employed for the depolymerisation of lignocellulosic biomasses to fermentable sugars. Moreover, the robustness of B. coagulans MA- 13 is a desirable trait, given the presence of microbial growth inhibitors in the pre-treated biomass hydrolysate...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the first}} energy crisis in early 1970 ’s {{improving}} the energy {{efficiency of the}} Phalaenopsis greenhouse industry started gaining importance. Today, {{in the context of}} global change and the commitment of Europe to become the most climate friendly region of the world, efficient energy use has never been more crucial. Taking into account that nighttime greenhouse heating is about 80 % of the total heating budget, the main objective of this work was to explore the impact of cool night temperatures on the photosynthetic activity and physiology of Phalaenopsis. To this end, experiments were conducted in growth chambers under controlled environmental conditions as well as in greenhouses in which duration and interaction with external environmental conditions (e. g. light) came close to common cultivation practices. In a first explorative study of this research, the application of chlorophyll fluorescence to assess temperature stress in Phalaenopsis was investigated. Upon exposure to a warm day/cool night temperature of 37 / 18 °C, chlorophyll fluorescence was measured continuously over 48 h and the results revealed a crucial role of the internal malic acid pool in the diel course of PSII operating efficiency (Fq′/Fm′) and non-photochemical quenching (NPQ). Moreover, temperature and PAR evolution closely correlated with the daytime course of Fq′/Fm′ and maximum quantum efficiency of PSII photochemistry (Fv/Fm). Taking these finding into account as well as the impact of temperature and light on the amount of nocturnally accumulated malate and diel photosynthetic activity, it was therefore recommended to carry out chlorophyll fluorescence measurements after the onset of the photoperiod (i. e. far before the potential malic acid depletion), within a reasonable time span (i. e. 40 – 60 min) and at least in combination with CO 2 flux measurements to generate meaningful fluorescence data. In a second part of this doctoral research, a more in depth assessment was made of the impact of cool night temperatures on Phalaenopsis photosynthetic activity and physiology. First, the energy saving night temperature was determined for the key CAM processes in Phalaenopsis: leaf net CO 2 exchange, malate and citrate accumulation, PSII photochemistry and soluble sugar synthesis. Phalaenopsis was subjected to night temperatures of 12 °C to 27 °C. A new approach was suggested to determine the upper and lower energy saving night temperature limits in a precise and objective manner, thereby relying on the temperature response curve of a particular physiological process and its 5 th and 95 th percentile line. The energy saving night temperature range differed with the physiological process, but for the whole of the afore-mentioned physiological processes the temperature range from 17. 1 °C to 19. 9 °C could be defined as being energy saving. To validate our newly developed method, 8 Phalaenopsis hybrids were grown during a <b>complete</b> vegetative <b>cultivation</b> period at a warm day/cool night temperature regime of either 29 / 17 °C or 29 / 23 °C and potential differences in response with plants grown at a constant warm temperature regime (i. e. 28 / 28 °C) were investigated. This survey revealed that a day/night temperature of 29 / 17 °C resulted in a significantly lower biomass growth and less leaves which were in addition shorter, narrower and smaller in size as compared to the day/night temperature regimes of 28 / 28 °C and 29 / 23 °C. More importantly, it was shown that undesired premature flowering could only be sufficiently suppressed in 3 hybrids (i. e. ‘Boston’, ‘Bristol’ and ‘Lennestadt’). As such, the implementation of warm day/cool night temperature regimes for commercial cultivation of Phalaenopsis is acceptable for hybrids like ‘Boston’, ‘Bristol’ and ‘Lennestadt’ but not for hybrids similar to the other 5 (i. e. ‘Chalk Dust’, ‘Fire Fly’, ‘Liverpool’, ‘Precious’ and ‘Vivaldi’). After determination of the energy saving night temperature range, {{the next step was to}} investigate the mechanistic background and to which extent the photosynthetic capacity and metabolic activity of Phalaenopsis is able to acclimate to a suboptimal night temperature. During this survey, the night temperature was gradually reduced from 28 °C to 16 °C over 4 consecutive days and compared to responses of plants subjected to an abrupt night temperature drop. The reduction in leaf net CO 2 uptake, while nocturnal malate content increased, suggested an enhanced refixation of respiratory CO 2. Indeed, the contribution of respiratory CO 2 recycling to nocturnal malate accumulation increased from 23. 5 % to 47. 0 %. The subsequent evolution of CAM photosynthesis towards CAM idling was accompanied by a transition from a malate dominated organic acid metabolism to an organic acid metabolism with comparable levels of malate and citrate. This organic acid modulation suggested a strategy to avoid over-excitation of PSII photochemistry as well as an important carbon recycling mechanism and therefore the diversion of the organic acid metabolism to citrate accumulation could be considered as an essential step in the low night temperature acclimation of Phalaenopsis. In contrast to starch, glucose and fructose, which were shown to act as major carbohydrate sources for PEP generation at high night temperatures (i. e. > 24 °C), sucrose appeared to play a distinct role in the recovery of the membrane stability after a cool night temperature event. After a gradual decrease in night temperature from 28 °C to 16 °C, membrane stability showed a depression at the start of the photoperiod. Consistent with the relatively high PSII electron transport rates and the view that malate decarboxylation was not yet started at that time, these findings indicated the involvement of oxidative stress. Membrane stability recovered however relatively quickly and it was striking to find that this recovery was preceded by a temporarily up-regulation of mainly sucrose and to a lesser extent also glucose and fructose. In this respect, the observed metabolic flexibility in Phalaenopsis could be regarded as an important factor in alleviating the oxidative burden at suboptimal night temperatures. Finally, the photosynthetic performance of Phalaenopsis subjected to a distinctive warm day/cool night temperature regime was evaluated during one month in autumn and spring. A first major outcome of this survey was the characterization of the efficiency of carbon fixation in Phalaenopsis. To the best of our knowledge, efficiency of carbon fixation was quantified for the first time in Phalaenopsis and revealed a considerable seasonality with a carbon fixation efficiency of 1. 06 - 1. 27 % during spring and as half as high in autumn. A second important finding of this study was the involvement of photorespiration in CAM photosynthesis. Photorespiration was evidenced by the decline in the Phase II and Phase IV contribution to the total daily net CO 2 assimilation from 15 % to maximally 7 %. Consistently a slightly lower carbon fixation efficiency upon exposure to the distinctive warm day/cool night temperature was found. In addition, cumulated leaf net CO 2 uptake of the distinctive warm day/cool night temperature regimes declined with 10 - 16 % as compared to the more constant temperature regimes, while the efficiency of carbon fixation revealed no substantial differences in both seasons.

One of the main problems has been that the strawberries ripen successively during a couple of weeks, and that most harvesters are based on the once-over principle. This results in a decrease in yield {{at the same time as}} a relatively large quantity of green strawberries is harvested. It has frequently been considered profitable to hand-pick the first large berries and then harvest mechanically about one week later. Another approach frequently used by growers is to hand-pick several times and then harvest the remaining berries by machine. When a late harvesting of this kind is carried out, there are very few berries left, many of which are over-ripe or have not been picked because they are mouldy. In such a situation there are not only too few berries to pay for the machine-costs, but r also the berries are of such poor quality that extensive sorting is needed before they can be used. This type of mechanical harvesting has been found very unprofitable. The early trials are all centered on harvesting in normal row crops. During he l 960 's, prototype harvesters were developed at several universities in the USA and in Canada. All prototypes worked on the principle of stripping the berries from the plant. Fingers made of plastic or metal, placed at suitable intervals, combed through the plant and removed the strawberries. Tests were made of stripping forwards, backwards, and sideways, etc. Almost all possible approaches have been tested. Similar machines have been constructed also in Holland, Italy, the Soviet Union, and Denmark. The Danish machine is only a couple of years old, and this harvesting method is being tested actively in Denmark. One of the large problems with the stripping strawberry harvesters is their low capacity. Driving speeds are normally only 300 - 400 metres per hour. In order to be able to drive faster, the fingers which strip off the berries must also move faster, and then the number of berries thrown out and lost increases. Another problem is that the runners easily become entangled in the fingers and are pulled off, thus hindering the harvesting. In the late l 960 's, harvesters working on the principle of cutting off the entire plant started to appear. This method was developed simultaneously by the National Institute of Agricultural Engineering (NIAE) in England, and by growers and universities in Oregon, USA. The fundamental principle is as follows: strawberries and leaves are located on different stems, and if the plant is cut off close to the soil, the berries and leaves can be separated by blowing away the leaves and other light material. This harvesting method allows a considerable increase in the driving speed. Similar harvesters are being (or have been) developed also in Canada, Italy, and the Soviet Union. Other methods than the two described above have been tested: vibrating the stems of the plants, causing the ripe strawberries to fall off, for example; or lifting the berries with a net laid out on the ground in the spring. Whatever method is used, it has become apparent that growing technique must be modified if harvesting is to be carried out satisfactorily. There is probably no existing field that can be successfully harvested mechanically without modifications. In some cases, harvest-efficiency has been increased from 50 to 90 %, simply by removing stones etc. and levelling out the beds. It became apparent that one of the largest problems is the lifting of the berries from the soil so they can be harvested. A large number of the berries lie on the outer edge of the row. Also, if the soil between the rows has been compressed by tractor wheels, this worsens matters. Great efforts have been made to breed varieties with an erect growth habit, but with little success. Various solutions have been tried for lifting the berries from the soil, different types of brushes and reels, for example. Fingers which comb through the plant (similar to the crop-lifter on a combine-harvester) are commonly used on the cutting harvesters. Air has also been used, both as a negative pressure (the vacuum cleaner principle) and by blowing compressed air from the sides of the row. Most of these methods have caused undesirable damage to the berries. Another problem with harvesting strawberries cultivated in rows, is the varying degrees of ripeness due to uneven exposure to sunlight. Berries on the outside of the rows ripen 3 - 4 days earlier than those in the middle. It is therefore difficult to find the optimum time of harvesting, with the maximum of ripe berries, but without any being over-ripe. A <b>complete</b> system of <b>cultivation,</b> of which the harvester is an integrated part, has been developed by Michigan State University in the USA. In this system, the strawberries are grown in a field without rows, thus covering the entire field. This solves a number of problems encountered in row-cropping. The increased number of plants (the aim is to have 150 established crowns per square metre in a fully-grown population) results in the straw-berries being raised higher from the soil, since the stems support the fruit. Moreover, the ripening is more uniform when all the berries are shaded beneath the foliage. Another important advantage is that the yield, according to American results, is twice as high as that obtained in the conventional row system. The rows cover only 40 % of the field as opposed to the 100 % coverage with the new system. This also means that the harvester doubles its capacity at the same driving speed and cutting width. Also, in the USA there are fewer problems with diseases as the berries do not lie directly on the soil. The fields are harvested with a machine developed at Michigan State University which cuts off the plant very close to the soil, preferably closer than 2 cm from the ground. To make this possible, it is vital that the field be absolutely level. The harvest is facilitated by crop-lifters which lift up the berries, and a reel which also lifts up the berries in front of the cutter bar, and feeds them into the harvester. Conveyors transport the straw-berries backwards into the machine, where they fall onto a grid conveyor. As they fall, they pass through a powerful current of air which blows away leaves and other light material. The grid conveyor transports the berries over two more fans which blow air from below, and raise the stems while the berries remain on the grid. A double-sickle shortens the stems to 3 - 4 cm. Bunches of berries are thus separated, giving individual berries with short stems. These fall onto a conveyor which transports them sideways out to storage boxes. Under normal conditions, the harvester has a capacity of approximately 2 tonnes per hour, and can harvest one hectare in approximately 6 - 8 hours. The harvesting efficiency is frequently higher than 90 %. This figure can be compared with manual harvesting, where efficiency is often as low as 75 %, ie one fourth of the strawberries are left in the field. Irrespective of whether the harvesting is done by stripping or by cutting, the berries must undergo further treatment before they can be frozen or processed in a factory. The harvester which gives the cleanest product is probably the one developed by Michigan State University. When these strawberries are to be used for making puree, for example, they can simply be tipped from the boxes into a tank of water for washing, after which all mouldy fruit is removed manually from an inspection belt. The remainder is fed into a puree-press. If the berries are to be IQF-frozen, a product which has a higher price, and probably also a wider market, both stem and cap must be removed. This can be done in a decapping machine. There are different types of decappers, one of which uses counter-rotating rubber rollers. When the stem is caught between two rollers, it is pulled off. On most varieties of strawberries the cap remains on the berries and they cannot be used for jam, for example. Another type of decapper has been developed at Michigan State University. This uses a conveyor with a number of smooth plastic-covered, counter-rotating rollers. When the stem is caught between two rollers it is held in place and transported past a band knife (a band saw without teeth) which cuts off the stem and cap. The capped berries can then be IQF-frozen, or used in making, for example, jam...|$|R
