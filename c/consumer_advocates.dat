5|$|The merger {{was opposed}} by <b>consumer</b> <b>advocates,</b> {{such as the}} Consumer Federation of America, due to anti-trust concerns. The two {{companies}} combined would become the largest pet food brand by market-share with a 45 {{percent share of the}} cat food market. The Federal Trade Commission approved the merger after the Meow Mix and Alley Cat brands from Ralston were sold to J.W. Childs Equity Partners, creating the separate Meow Mix Company. Ralston's St. Louis, Missouri location was chosen as the new company's North America headquarters.|$|E

25|$|The decision, {{which had}} begun {{as a class}} action in California, {{was seen as a}} victory for banks and credit-card issuers, who could mostly charge late fees as they pleased. For that same reason <b>consumer</b> <b>advocates</b> were displeased, warning that late fees could rise to {{previously}} unseen levels. They did, and one of the Citibank attorneys has expressed regret for his involvement.|$|E
25|$|On May 24, 2000; US Airways {{announced}} plans to be acquired for $4.3 billion by UAL Corp., {{the parent company of}} United Airlines, the world's largest commercial carrier at the time. The complex deal drew immediate objections from labor unions, <b>consumer</b> <b>advocates</b> and antitrust regulators. Negotiations stalled; with both airlines losing money and the deal all but certain to be blocked by the federal government, UAL withdrew its purchase offer on July 27, 2001, paying US Airways a $50 million penalty for withdrawing from the deal.|$|E
25|$|The {{increased}} use of more freely available credit changed the American economy, but not without creating some backlash. <b>Consumer</b> <b>advocates</b> complained that some issuers were using late fees of $5 or $10, charged if a single month's payment was even one day overdue, to gouge extra profits from customers who might otherwise be borrowing and spending responsibly. Laws in some states limited those fees, yet companies and banks continued to charge above those limits, claiming the late fees were a form of interest and thus {{not subject to the}} laws of those states {{as long as they were}} headquartered elsewhere.|$|E

25|$|In the United States, {{economists and}} <b>consumer</b> <b>advocates</b> {{generally}} consider insurance to be worthwhile for low-probability, catastrophic losses, {{but not for}} high-probability, small losses. Because of this, consumers are advised to select high deductibles and to not insure losses which would not cause a disruption in their life. However, consumers have shown a tendency to prefer low deductibles and to prefer to insure relatively high-probability, small losses over low-probability, perhaps due to not understanding or ignoring the low-probability risk. This is associated with reduced purchasing of insurance against low-probability losses, and may result in increased inefficiencies from moral hazard.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, legislators, {{health experts}} and <b>consumer</b> <b>advocates</b> are {{considering}} levying higher {{taxes on the}} sale of soft drinks and other sweetened beverages to help curb the epidemic of obesity among Americans, and its harmful impact on overall health. Some speculate that higher taxes could help reduce soda consumption. Others say that taxes should help fund education to increase consumer awareness of the unhealthy effects of excessive soft drink consumption, and also help cover costs of caring for conditions resulting from overconsumption. The food and beverage industry holds considerable clout in Washington, DC, as it has contributed more than $50 million to legislators since 2000.|$|E
25|$|Starting in the mid-1980s, the Court {{has greatly}} {{expanded}} {{the reach of}} Prima Paint in later cases. Since some of these have applied to the expanded use of arbitration clauses in contracts of adhesion between companies and consumers, some <b>consumer</b> <b>advocates</b> and legal scholars have criticized the decision as the inadvertent opening wedge of {{an assault on the}} right to litigate, and a weakening of state contract law and the Erie Railroad principle of deference to state common law. Defenders of the decision have responded that it simply began bringing the U.S. more in line with international arbitration practice, helping American companies compete in a global economy. One, Alan Rau, has also argued that it is justified not just by the Arbitration Act but by general principles of contract law.|$|E

25|$|Lenders {{argue that}} the real estate attorney's fee, for example, is a {{pass-through}} cost, not a cost of the lending. In effect, they are arguing that the attorney's fee is a separate transaction and {{not a part of}} the loan. <b>Consumer</b> <b>advocates</b> argue that this would be true if the customer is free to select which attorney is used. If the lender insists, however, on using a specific attorney, the cost should be looked at as a component of the total cost of doing business with that lender. This area is made more complicated by the practice of contingency fees – for example, when the lender receives money from the attorney and other agents to be the one used by the lender. Because of this, U.S. regulators require all lenders to produce an affiliated business disclosure form which shows the amounts paid between the lender and the appraisal firms, attorneys, etc.|$|E

500|$|According to the FDIC, by 2011 {{the uninsured}} depositors of Superior had each {{received}} 81% of their uninsured monies, {{in addition to}} the $100,000 each previously received of their insured amount. Industry experts have criticized the Pritzkers in regard to Superior. <b>Consumer</b> <b>advocates</b> and government investigators asserted Superior [...] "engaged in unsound financial activities and predatory lending practices". Responding to the Wall Street Journal, Pritzker noted she had no ownership in the bank, either direct or indirect, and that the bank's reasons for failure [...] "were complex, including changes in accounting practices, auditing failures, reversals in regulatory positions and general economic conditions". She said the bank complied with [...] "fair lending laws" [...] and ethical business practices. A 2001 Business Week article described the bank's other owner, Alvin Dworman, as the more dominant partner in its operation as a result of agreements made by Jay Pritzker. Quoted in the New York Times, a Pritzker family friend observed Pritzker was trapped in a deal of her uncle's making: [...] "Penny got sucked into this…this was really the legacy of Jay." ...|$|E

In an August 2007 op-ed piece in Financial Times, Frank wrote, [...] "In the debate between those who believe in essentially unregulated markets and others who hold that reasonable regulation diminishes market excesses without inhibiting their basic function, the subprime situation unfortunately provides ammunition for the latter view." [...] Frank was also instrumental in the passage of , the Credit Cardholders' Bill of Rights Act of 2008, a measure that drew praise from editorial boards and <b>consumer</b> <b>advocates.</b> In 2007. Frank co-sponsored legislation to reform the Section 202 refinancing program, which is for affordable housing for the elderly, and Section 811 disabled programs. Frank has been a chief advocate of the National Housing Trust Fund, which was created as part of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 and was the first affordable housing program to be enacted by the Congress since 1990.|$|E

[...] Robo-signing is a term used by <b>consumer</b> <b>advocates</b> to describe the robotic process of the mass production of false and forged execution of mortgage assignments, satisfactions, affidavits and other legal documents related to mortgage foreclosures and legal matters being created by persons without knowledge of the facts being attested to.

2500|$|<b>Consumer</b> <b>advocates</b> {{and other}} experts [...] argue, however, that payday loans appear to exist in a classic market failure. [...] In a perfect market of {{competing}} sellers and buyers seeking to trade in a rational manner, pricing fluctuates based on {{the capacity of the}} market. Payday lenders have no incentive to price their loans competitively since loans are not capable of being patented. Thus, if a lender chooses to innovate and reduce cost to borrowers in order to secure a larger share of the market the competing lenders will instantly do the same, negating the effect. For this reason, among others, all lenders in the payday marketplace charge at or very near the maximum fees and rates allowed by local law.|$|E
