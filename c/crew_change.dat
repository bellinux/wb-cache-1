25|$|After the {{division}} headquarters moved, the depot still carried out railroad functions; the building still {{served as a}} <b>crew</b> <b>change</b> location {{as well as the}} depot for the village of Amboy. The second floor was mostly abandoned after 1894 while the first floor handled the bulk of the day-to-day operations. As cars and buses became more popular Amboy's need for rail service could be served by the station in Dixon; passenger service to Amboy was discontinued in 1939 and the depot underwent an extensive remodeling. Operations were once again moved about the building. The northwest half of the first floor was transformed into a storage area and the second floor renovated into apartments for the station agent and employees of the nearby Green River Ordnance Plant. The station remained the transfer point for all ammunition made at the hastily constructed ammunition plant throughout World War II and the Korean War.|$|E

2500|$|A Commission of Inquiry {{investigated}} the crash. Justice René P. Foisy, Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta, held 56 days of public hearings and received evidence from 150 parties. [...] The inquiry report was published on January 22, 1987. [...] Instead of condemning any one individual, it instead condemned what Foisy {{described as a}} [...] "railroader culture" [...] that prized loyalty and productivity {{at the expense of}} safety. [...] As an example of this disregard of safety, it was noted that the crew of that train had boarded the locomotive at Edson [...] "on the fly". [...] While the locomotive was moving slowly through the yard, the new crew would jump on and the previous crew would jump off. [...] While this method of changing crews saved time and fuel, it was a flagrant violation of safety regulations requiring a stationary brake test after a <b>crew</b> <b>change.</b> [...] Management claimed to be unaware of this practice, even though it was quite common. In regards to engineer Hudson, the Foisy Commission concluded it was a possibility that Hudson had either fallen asleep at the controls or had suffered a heart attack or stroke in light of his extremely poor health, leading to the collision. The commission further criticized CN's ineffective monitoring of Hudson's health condition: ...|$|E
2500|$|The fatal {{accident}} occurred on 5 November 1956. The aircraft, a Handley Page HP.81 Hermes 4A (registration: G-ALDJ), operated an international non-scheduled passenger flight from Blackbushe via Malta and Cyprus to Tripoli and back. The first stop at Malta involved a <b>crew</b> <b>change.</b> Due {{to the flight}} arriving at Tripoli's King Idris Airport five hours late, there was a reduced rest time for the crew that {{had taken over the}} aircraft in Malta. However, this was insufficient to prevent a delayed takeoff from Idris Airport.

Two minutes after the flightdeck crew reported passing the beacon at , the procedure turn was completed at [...] The aircraft was cleared to land after it had passed the Outer Marker, following which the aircraft descended below the ILS glide slope. It hit a beech tree [...] short of the runway threshold, swerved to the left and came to a halt in a group of pine trees [...] further on. The accident destroyed the aircraft and killed seven of the 80 occupants (three out of six crew members and four out of 74 passengers). The subsequent accident investigation established the captain's fatigue while operating in difficult conditions, as well as his misjudgement of the aircraft's height based on his vision of the airport lights, as the probable cause.|$|E
