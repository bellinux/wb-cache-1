25|$|Peach {{trees are}} prone to a disease called leaf curl, which usually does not {{directly}} affect the fruit, but does reduce the crop yield by partially defoliating the tree. Several fungicides {{can be used to}} combat the disease, including Bordeaux mixture and other copper-based products (the University of California considers these organic treatments), ziram, <b>chlorothalonil,</b> and dodine. The fruit is susceptible to brown rot or a dark reddish spot.|$|E

50|$|The main {{breakdown}} product of <b>chlorothalonil</b> is 4-hydroxy-2,5,6-trichloroisophthalonitrile (SDS-3701). It {{has been shown}} to be 30 times more acutely toxic than <b>chlorothalonil</b> and more persistent in the environment. Laboratory experiments have shown it can thin the eggshells of birds, but no evidence supports this happening in the environment.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chlorothalonil</b> can be {{produced}} by the direct chlorination of isophthalonitrile or by dehydration of tetrachloroisophthaloyl amide with phosphoryl chloride. It is a white solid. It breaks down under basic conditions, but is stable in neutral and acidic media. Technical grade <b>chlorothalonil</b> contains traces of dioxins and hexachlorobenzene, a persistent organic pollutant banned under the Stockholm Convention.|$|E

5000|$|The {{primary control}} of purple spot was EBDC {{fungicides}} until processors began {{to reject the}} use of EBDCs. As a result, since 1990 exemptions for <b>chlorothalonil</b> and tebuconazole in Michigan have been granted by the EPA for use on asparagus. The fungicides are applied {{at the end of}} the harvest and <b>chlorothalonil</b> has been shown in experiments to reduce purple spot by 99% and increase yields by 36%. [...] This increase in yield as a result of purple spot control has been shown to translate into a net return of $200-400 per acre for asparagus growers [...]|$|E
50|$|Due to the {{effectiveness}} of fungicide application and it’s relatively minor damage to crops, there are few cultural controls and no resistant peach variants that have been developed for the current market. For prevention of peach scab, proper pruning of leaves to allow adequate sunlight will drastically reduce the risk of infection and propagation. The primary form of regulation for peach scab requires frequent applications of commercial fungicides. There are three main types of fungicides that are effective against peach scab: captan, <b>chlorothalonil,</b> and demethylation inhibitors. Proper use of <b>chlorothalonil</b> requires application starting from shuck split and reapplication every two weeks. Increased temperature and wet weather will necessitate more frequent applications. Applications are necessary until 4-6 weeks until harvest.|$|E
50|$|The least but not {{the less}} {{important}} management is the chemical control that ensure good control of the disease. The chemical control is basically spraying fungicide {{as soon as the}} symptoms are evident. Compounds registered for using are: <b>chlorothalonil,</b> maneb, mancozeb and copper.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chlorothalonil</b> is commercially {{available}} {{in many different}} formulations and delivery methods. It is applied as a dust, dry or water-soluble grains, a wettable powder, a liquid spray, a fog, and a dip. It may be applied by hand, by ground sprayer, or by aircraft.|$|E
50|$|In the United Kingdom, {{there are}} issues {{concerning}} MBC fungicides {{and some of the}} triazole fungicides (e.g. flusilazole andepoxiconazole). To date there are no issues with strobilurin fungicides (QoI fungicides), but the situation is being monitoredclosely. There are currently no issues concerning <b>chlorothalonil,</b> cyprodinil or the morpholines.|$|E
50|$|Typhula blight {{and snow}} molds can be {{controlled}} by fungicide applications. However, {{the timing of the}} application is crucial. This chemical treatment {{needs to be done in}} late fall before the first snow fall. If the application is made too soon a second follow up treatment may be needed. Possible chemical applications include: a demethylation inhibitor, or DMI, with a <b>chlorothalonil</b> product, a DMI with a thiophanate-methyl product, or an Iprodione with a <b>chlorothalonil</b> product. Typhula blight can also be controlled culturally. One method would be to plant a less susceptible turfgrass. Bentgrass and annual bluegrass are the two most susceptible turfgrasses to Typhula blight. Another method is to limit heavy late season fertilizer applications. Finally, cutting the grass until dormancy to keep the grass height down can help.|$|E
50|$|Early {{leaf spot}} of peanut {{can be treated}} {{through the use of}} {{fungicides}} applied at the very early pod stage, and applied every two weeks thereafter. After analyzing the incidence and severity of the disease, strip-tillage techniques have also proven to be effective in delaying an epidemic by reducing the amount of initial infection. Furthermore, the delay in disease caused by the strip-tillage technique proposes that initial application of fungicides for use in disease management may be delayed without having negative effects on the treatment of early leaf spot of peanut. Nevertheless, fungicides, such as the protectant fungicide, <b>chlorothalonil,</b> have been the standard for control leaf spots since the mid-1970s and is still widely used today. Tebuconazole, a systemic ergosterol biosynthesis-inhibiting fungicide, and Pyraclostrobin, a strobilurin-type fungicide have also both proven effective in controlling early leaf spot, even more so than <b>chlorothalonil.</b> Usually, fungicides need to be applied multiple times every few weeks; a typical treatment using <b>chlorothalonil</b> or tebuconazole requires fungicides application around seven times starting just 30-45 days after planting. The use of resistant cultivars is the most successful way to be overcome the pathogen and maintain yields. Sources of resistance have been reported and prolong incubation and latent period by reducing the number of lesions per unit area of leaf surface, defoliation, and sporulation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chlorothalonil</b> {{has been}} {{detected}} in ambient air in Minnesota and Prince Edward Island, {{as well as}} in groundwater in Long Island, New York and Florida. In the first three cases, the contamination is presumed to have come from potato farms. It has also been detected in several fish kills in Prince Edward Island.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{numerous}} fungicides {{on the market}} for controlling early blight. Some of the fungicides on the market are azoxystrobin, pyraclostrobin, Bacillus subtilis, <b>chlorothalonil,</b> copper products, hydrogen dioxide (Hydroperoxyl), mancozeb, potassium bicarbonate, and ziram. [...] Specific spraying regiments are found on the label. Labels for these products should be read carefully before applying.|$|E
50|$|There is a {{wide variety}} of {{chemical}} groups that are labeled for control of Microdochium Patch.

50|$|Fungicides applied {{specifically}} for downy mildew control may be unnecessary. Broad spectrum protectant fungicides such as <b>chlorothalonil,</b> mancozeb, and fixed copper {{are at least}} somewhat effective in protecting against downy mildew infection. Systemic fungicides are labeled for use against cucurbit downy mildew, but are recommended only after diagnosis of this disease has been confirmed.|$|E
50|$|In the US, <b>chlorothalonil</b> is used {{predominantly}} on peanuts (about 34% of usage), potatoes (about 12%), {{and tomatoes}} (about 7%), though the EPA recognizes its use on many other crops. It {{is also used}} on golf courses and lawns (about 10%) and as a preservative additive in some paints (about 13%), resins, emulsions, and coatings.|$|E
50|$|Many {{different}} formulations exist with imazalil, difenoconazole, prochloraz, propiconazole, <b>chlorothalonil,</b> cyprodinil, fludioxonil, azoxystrobin, and copper. In {{wood preservatives}} it {{is mixed with}} didecyldimethylammonium chloride.It is the active ingredient in two foliar fungicides for soybeans in the U.S., Alto X, and mixed with azoxystrobin in Quadris Xtra, both by Syngenta.It is also manufactured by Bayer CropScience and Dow AgroSciences.|$|E
5000|$|When planting, growers should select {{locations}} {{which have}} {{a large amount of}} direct sunlight such as a south facing slope. Proper pruning should also be completed {{to increase the amount of}} sunlight penetration and air circulation through the canopy. Any practice that increases the faster drying of leaves will help reduce the risk of infection. Growers may also consider making an after harvest fungicide application using a combination of Benomyl (50% WP)and Captan (50% WP) at rates of 1/4 Tablespoon and 2 Tablespoons respectively per gallon of water. This will help reduce the rate at which pathogens may develop resistance to Benomyl products. Prior to shuck split, the recommended fungicide for cherry leaf spot is <b>chlorothalonil</b> (Bravo and generics). [...] This fungicide is a multi-site protectant and is excellent for leaf spot control and is not at risk for fungicide resistance development. At least two applications of <b>chlorothalonil</b> should be made before shuck split with the goal to minimize the potential of infection at this early stage.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are many}} {{fungicides}} which control Cercospora melongenae including Oils with no added pesticides, and some with. The most common recommended is a Bordeaux mixture, which only {{needs to be}} applied once every two weeks. [...] Neem oil, Octanoic acid and copper salt solutions, and various concentrations of <b>Chlorothalonil</b> are all recommended fungicides, as well. Carefully read labels, and laws regarding application regiments and practices.|$|E
50|$|Alternaria {{was first}} {{reported}} on green beans in Florida in 1951 after a hundred acres were {{lost to the}} disease in one season. By the 1970s it had spread up the coast to New York. The disease causes lesions on {{the skin of the}} green bean, killing the tissue and giving the plant a moldy appearance. Trials have shown that applications of <b>chlorothalonil</b> can reduce alternaria by up to 85%.|$|E
50|$|Downy mildew left {{uncontrolled}} has {{the ability}} to reduce yields by up to 55% and infest up to 80% of plants. Downy mildew is primarily controlled through the use of several fungicides applied during midseason. The fungicides used include azoxystrobin, copper, <b>chlorothalonil,</b> mancozeb, and maneb. Farmers in Florida who regularly use fungicides have been shown to reduce yield losses due to downy mildew to as low as 2%.|$|E
50|$|Chemical {{means of}} {{controlling}} Botryotinia polyblastis involve {{the use of}} fungicides. There are many varieties of fungicides available to prevent Botryotinia polyblastis infections {{and they should be}} applied twice throughout the season, once in late March and once in late April. Dicarboximide, <b>chlorothalonil,</b> fludioxonil, cyprodinil, pyraclostrobin and mancozeb are all common fungicides used to treat Narcissus fire, however formulations containing dicarboximide {{have been shown to be}} most effective.|$|E

50|$|Web blotch is {{currently}} {{found in all}} major peanut growing states in the south. It can be a highly damaging disease. In ideal conditions web blotch can cause yield loss as high as 50%. The first sign that a plant is infected with web blotch is small tan blotches on plant leaves. The leaf will become brittle and the plant will defoliate. <b>Chlorothalonil</b> and tebuconazole are effective treatments for reducing web blotch incidence.|$|E
50|$|Southern corn leaf blight {{thrives in}} the {{southern}} United States because unlike NCLB it requires warm weather to develop. During favorable conditions the disease has been documented ruining a whole crop within days when left untreated. Treatment is available {{with the use of}} <b>chlorothalonil,</b> mancozeb, and maneb but even this is limited. In one study in Florida even when a regular fungicide plan was followed over 25% of the ears were lost.|$|E
50|$|Applying {{fungicides}} {{that contain}} <b>chlorothalonil,</b> maneb, mancozeb, or metalaxyl {{as the main}} ingredient on a regular schedule will help to eliminate the pathogen. You can also apply fungicides containing mefenoxam to the soil surface under the vines around 4-8 weeks prior to harvest. A third practice to help control the disease is to spray with another fungicide, difolatan, 4 times over a 10-day period. Soil should be fumigated before anything else is planted in previously-infected soil.|$|E
50|$|Alternaria {{leaf spot}} affects the cabbage plant by causing severe {{spotting}} and discoloration {{to the head}} of the plant. It is only a superficial effect to the plant but because of the black color of the leaf spots the marketability of a severely infected cabbage crop is low. Without control leaf spot is estimated to be able to reduce yields by up to 50%. Alternaria leaf spot is controlled using the same treatment as downy mildew: applications of azoxystrobin, copper, <b>chlorothalonil,</b> mancozeb, and maneb beginning midseason.|$|E
