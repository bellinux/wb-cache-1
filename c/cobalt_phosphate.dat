5|$|Before the 19th century, cobalt was {{predominantly}} {{used as a}} pigment. Since the Middle Ages, it {{has been}} used in the production of smalt, a blue colored glass. Smalt is produced by melting a mixture of the roasted mineral smaltite, quartz and potassium carbonate, yielding a dark blue silicate glass which is finely ground after the production. Smalt was widely used for the coloration of glass and as pigment for paintings. In 1780, Sven Rinman discovered cobalt green, and in 1802 Louis Jacques Thénard discovered cobalt blue. Cobalt pigments such as cobalt blue (cobalt aluminate), cerulean blue (cobalt(II) stannate), various hues of cobalt green (a mixture of cobalt(II) oxide and zinc oxide), and cobalt violet (<b>cobalt</b> <b>phosphate)</b> are used as artist's pigments because of their superior chromatic stability.

50|$|The first cobalt violet, the {{intensely}} red-violet cobalt arsenate, {{was highly}} toxic. Although it persisted in some paint lines into the twentieth-century, it was displaced by less toxic cobalt compounds such as <b>cobalt</b> <b>phosphate.</b> Cobalt violet {{appeared in the}} second half of the 19th century, broadening the palette of artists. Cobalt violet was used by Paul Signac (1863-1935), Claude Monet (1840-1926), and Georges Seurat (1859-1891). Today, cobalt ammonium phosphate, cobalt lithium phosphate, and <b>cobalt</b> <b>phosphate</b> are available for use by artists. Cobalt ammonium phosphate is the most reddish of the three. <b>Cobalt</b> <b>phosphate</b> is available in two varieties — a deep less saturated blueish type and a lighter and brighter somewhat more reddish type. Cobalt lithium phosphate is a saturated lighter-valued bluish violet. A color similar to cobalt ammonium phosphate, cobalt magnesium borate, was introduced in the later twentieth-century but was not deemed sufficiently lightfast for artistic use. Cobalt violet is the only truly lightfast violet pigment with relatively strong color saturation. All other light-stable violet pigments are dull by comparison. However, the high price of the pigment and the toxicity of cobalt has limited its use.|$|E

Cells using iron phosphate in the positive have energy density between 80 - 110 Wh/kg and those using lithium titanate oxide in the negative electrode have energy density between 60 - 70 Wh/kg. The power densities can vary over a wide range even for a given chemistry. In general, it is possible to design high power batteries (500 - 1000 W/kg at 90 % efficiency) for all the chemistries if one is willing to sacrifice energy density and likely also cycle life. The data indicate that high power iron phosphate cells can be designed without a significant sacrifice in energy density. When power densities greater than 2000 W/kg for lithium-ion batteries are claimed, it is for low efficiency pulses. For example, for an efficiency of 65 %, the 15 Ah EIG iron phosphate battery has a pulse power of 2330 W/kg rather than the 919 value for a 90 % efficient pulse. Cycle life data were not taken as part of the present study. However, cell cycle life dat...|$|R
5000|$|Since Li-ion {{batteries}} contain less toxic metals {{than other}} types of batteries which may contain lead or cadmium [...] they are generally categorized as non-hazardous waste. Li-ion battery elements including iron, copper, nickel and cobalt are considered safe for incinerators and landfills. These metals can be recycled, but mining generally remains cheaper than recycling. At present, not much is invested into recycling Li-ion batteries due to costs, complexities and low yield. The most expensive metal involved {{in the construction of}} the cell is <b>cobalt.</b> Lithium iron <b>phosphate</b> is cheaper but has other drawbacks. Lithium is less expensive than other metals used, but recycling could prevent a future shortage. The manufacturing processes of nickel and cobalt, and the solvent, present potential environmental and health hazards. Manufacturing a kg of Li-ion battery takes energy equivalent to 1.6 kg of oil.|$|R
40|$|A sodium <b>cobalt</b> {{hydrogen}} <b>phosphate</b> hydrate, Na 4 Co 3 H 2 (PO 4) (4). 8 H(2) O, was synthesized by {{the mild}} hydrothermal method, and the crystal structure {{was characterized by}} the single-crystal X-ray diffraction method. The layered structure possesses a new type with the following data: Mr = 794. 775, monoclinic, mP 106, P 2 (1) /c-e 26 d (No. 14), a = 7. 3547 (9) Angstrom, b = 9. 222 (1) Angstrom, c = 15. 186 (2) Angstrom, beta = 95. 18 (1) degrees, V = 1025. 9 (3) Angstrom(3), Z = 2, Dx = 2. 573 g cm(- 3), lambda = 0. 71073 Angstrom, mu = 29. 0 cm(- 1), F(000) = 790, T = 293 K, R = 0. 0346, wR = 0. 0432 for 198 variables and 2278 contributing unique reflections. The structure is characterized by corner- and edge-sharing deformed CoO 5 trigonal bipyramids with PO 4 tetrahedra forming an infinite ribbon along the [010] direction. The ribbons are connected by bridging CoO 6 octahedra resulting in a novel three-cobalt polymeric coordination unit and a polyhedral sheet. The same sheets are packed along the c-axis by sandwiching Na+ cations and hydrogen-bonded water molecules to construct the whole structure. The temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility of the compound follows the Curie-Weiss law, and the effective magnetic moment of 4. 69 mu(B) corresponds to high-spin Co 2 + ion, confirmed by bond valence sum calculations.
