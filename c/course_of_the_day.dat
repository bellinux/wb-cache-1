5|$|The {{origin of}} Amara {{can be traced}} back to an area of low {{pressure}} embedded within a monsoon trough southeast of Diego Garcia on December13, 2013. Computer models suggested that surrounding atmospheric conditions would later become more conducive for tropical cyclogenesis. Over the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> the localized area of circulation remained sheared, though convection remained persistent. Despite the hindering atmospheric environment, the system organized faster than anticipated, and was classified as a tropical disturbance by Météo-France at 1200UTC on December14. Shortly after development, the disturbance underwent a reformation phase and consequently a new center of circulation developed, allowing the system to reach tropical depression status early on December15. Nonetheless, the storm's overall structure remained ill-defined due to the presence of wind shear and multiple mesovortices.|$|E

5|$|Communications {{between the}} brigade and {{battalion}} headquarters and the forward company positions broke down {{at this stage}} and runners had to be despatched to pass a message asking for artillery support. Meanwhile, the supply situation for the Australians also became desperate as they had consumed all of their rations and {{had run out of}} water. The water situation was solved by digging a well within the perimeter, but it became clear that reinforcements were required. The Australian divisional commander, Bridgeford, subsequently placed a squadron of Matilda tanks under Major Kenneth Arnott from the 2/4th Armoured Regiment at the 7th Brigade commander's disposal, and over the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> these tanks were brought up towards the 25th's position from Toko where they had been put ashore from landing craft.

5|$|In late-May {{an area of}} {{disturbed}} weather {{began to}} persist roughly 650km (400mi) west of Manila, Philippines in the South China Sea. Late on May23, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center(JTWC) began to monitor the area for potential signs of tropical cyclogenesis. Over {{the next few days}} the disturbance began to consolidate towards a common low pressure center, resulting in a burst in convective activity. At 0000UTC on May25, the JTWC classified the resulting system as a tropical depression west of Luzon; six hours later both the Japan Meteorological Agency(JMA) and the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration(PAGASA) began to monitor the newly formed tropical cyclone, though the latter classified it as a tropical storm. During these initial stages of development the tropical cyclone slowly intensified as it slowly tracked in a clockwise loop throughout the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day.</b> At 1800UTC, the JTWC upgraded the depression to tropical storm status while the JMA followed suit six hours later, thus designating the cyclone with the name Linfa.|$|E
5|$|Precautions {{were taken}} to prevent secrets from the season finale being revealed; only certain staff members were {{provided}} with copies of the episode, which were given on watermarked DVDs and distributed to secret hiding places.

The first scene with Michael and Holly discussing their sketch possibilities in a secluded area was filmed with three cameras: one focusing on each side of the two actors, and one from the front of both of them to establish that the picnic was still going on behind them. Due to space limitations, the latter angle was filmed through a mirror (with the actors appearing to be opposite sides) and then the image was reversed and undistorted in post-production.|$|E

5|$|The {{origin of}} Typhoon Krovanh {{can be traced}} back to an area of {{persistent}} convection well east of Chuuk State on August13. Over the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> the disturbance gradually consolidated within favorable atmospheric conditions, and at 1800UTC that day the Japan Meteorological Agency(JMA) assessed the system to have organized sufficiently to be classified as a tropical depression. Shower activity was suppressed by a nearby upper-level low for much of the storm's early existence; however, at 0600UTC on August15, the system was classified by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center(JTWC) as a tropical depression. The depression tracked northwestward under the influence of a nearby ridge. Strengthening and development of the tropical cyclone was very minimal over the next few days, and on August18, both tracking agencies discontinued monitoring the system due to the lack of an identifiable low-level circulation center.|$|E
5|$|Three {{types of}} song have been described: the day song {{is the most}} common, sung by birds alone or in pairs as a chorus or an antiphonal duet, {{generally}} over the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> and while the birds are in flight. It appears to promote bonding and act as communication. The whisper song is sung more commonly in wet or windy weather, the singer sitting in a tree warbling soft and complex harmonies for up to 45 minutes, often mimicking many other bird species as well as dogs barking, lambs bleating or even people whistling. In the breeding season, pied butcherbirds sing the breeding song at night until dawn, when they switch to the day song. This song is longer and {{more complex than the}} day song. In response to threats, pied butcherbirds may chatter or make a harmonic alarm call composed of short, loud descending notes.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{becoming}} a hurricane, Emily was centered roughly 1,000mi (1,600km) {{east of the}} Florida peninsula, passing well south of Bermuda. A ridge of high pressure began to mature to its north, forcing the hurricane westward on August27. Emily's winds vacillated between tropical storm and hurricane force over the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> although the cyclone resumed its strengthening by August28 upon developing favorable upper-level outflow. Traversing warm sea surface temperatures, the hurricane continued to improve in appearance on satellite images, and the barometric pressure within its eye steadily decreased. Emily retraced toward the northwest on August29, when a shortwave trough eroded the southern periphery of the contiguous ridge. The NHC expressed uncertainty in forecasting Emily's track, stating that South Carolina, North Carolina, and Mid-Atlantic states were at risk of a direct hit from the hurricane. As high pressure re-established itself off the North Carolina coast, Emily briefly turned west-northwestward on August30 before initiating a prolonged curve toward the north. By that time, the NHC forecast Emily to remain offshore, though one tropical cyclone forecast model projected that the hurricane would move inland.|$|E

5|$|Work {{continued}} {{throughout the}} night of 15 October and into the following day. It focused on finding survivors and fighting the fire that blocked the entry into some workings of the western returns. The fire caused the roof supports to become unstable, and falls triggered outbursts of methane. Several rescuers were injured by the falls, one fatally. Before descending the mine many of the firefighters wrote what they thought might be their last letters home, and some made their wills. As the water pipe in the shaft was out of operation, fire-fighting continued with hand extinguishers and work was only possible in 20-minute shifts. Despite wearing respirators, several rescuers were overcome by the effects of firedamp. During the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> 56 bodies were raised to the surface and, that evening, a new water supply, connected by three-quarters of a mile (1.2km) of pipes to a nearby reservoir, was installed in the Lancaster shaft.|$|E
5|$|Early on September22, an {{aircraft}} fix located Vera 175km (110mi) north-northeast of Saipan. Throughout the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> periodic reconnaissance flights into the storm indicated that Vera {{had begun to}} rapidly intensify. By 1800UTC later that day, data analysis concluded that the tropical cyclone had reached typhoon intensity. Rapid intensification continued into the following day, as the typhoon's maximum sustained winds and barometric pressure quickly rose and fell, respectively. Concurrently, Vera's size grew to {{a point at which}} it spanned 250km (155mi) across. At 0600UTC the following day, Vera achieved its minimum estimated barometric pressure at 895mbar (hPa; 26.43inHg). This indicated a 75mbar (hPa; 2.22inHg) pressure drop in the preceding 24hours. Upon reaching its minimum pressure, Vera was estimated to have attained winds equivalent to a Category5– the highest classification possible on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. The typhoon's winds continued to increase before peaking at 1200UTC on September23, when reconnaissance aircraft reported maximum sustained winds of 305km/h (190mph). Upon peaking in wind speed, Vera was located 645km (400mi) northeast of Guam. The tropical cyclone's ability to quickly intensify was attributed to conducive atmospheric divergence and highly sustainable sea surface temperatures.|$|E
5|$|This {{time the}} mere {{presence}} of the Theban army was not enough to cow the opposition. Since time was passing and the Mantinean alliance showed no signs of capsizing, Epaminondas decided {{that he would have to}} break the stalemate. Hearing that a large Lacedaemonian force was marching to Mantinea, and that Sparta was practically undefended, he planned an audacious night-time march on Sparta itself. However, the Spartan king Archidamus was alerted to this move by an informant, probably a Cretan runner, and Epaminondas arrived to find the city well-defended.* Stylianou, Diodorus Siculus, 508510 Although he did attack the city, he seems to have drawn off relatively quickly on discovering that he had not, after all, surprised the Spartans. Furthermore, the Lacedaemonian and Mantinean troops which had been stationed at Mantinea had marched to Sparta during the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> and dissuaded Epaminondas from attacking again. Now hoping that his adversaries had left Mantinea defenseless in their haste to protect Sparta, Epaminondas counter marched his troops back to his base at Tegea, and then dispatched his cavalry to Mantinea. However, a clash outside the walls of Mantinea with Athenian cavalry foiled this strategy as well.* Stylianou, Diodorus Siculus, 510512 Realising that the time allotted for the campaign was drawing to a close, and reasoning that if he departed without defeating the enemies of Tegea, Theban influence in the Peloponnesus would be destroyed, he decided to stake everything on a pitched battle.|$|E
