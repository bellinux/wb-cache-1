50|$|IOTs {{have been}} {{described}} as a cross between a klystron and a triode, hence Eimac's trade name for them, Klystrode. They have an electron gun like a klystron, but with a control grid in front of it like a triode, with a very close spacing of around 0.1 mm. The high frequency RF voltage on the grid allows the electrons through in bunches. High voltage DC on a cylindrical anode accelerates the modulated electron beam through a small drift tube like a klystron. This drift tube prevents backflow of electromagnetic radiation. The bunched electron beam passes through the hollow anode into a resonant cavity, similar to the output cavity of a klystron, and strikes a <b>collector</b> <b>electrode.</b> As in a klystron, each bunch passes into the cavity {{at a time when the}} electric field decelerates it, transforming the kinetic energy of the beam into potential energy of the RF field, amplifying the signal. The oscillating electromagnetic energy in the cavity is extracted by a coaxial transmission line. An axial magnetic field prevents space charge spreading of the beam. The <b>collector</b> <b>electrode</b> is at a lower potential than the anode (depressed collector) which recovers some of the energy from the beam, increasing efficiency.|$|E
50|$|Typically such {{vibrators}} {{are employed}} in conjunction with electrostatic precipitators. Precipitators contain sheet metal <b>collector</b> <b>electrode</b> plates. Vertically suspended discharge electrode wires are located between the plates. As a gas stream, often discharged from an industrial process, flows through the precipitator, air particulates are ionized by the electrode wire. The ionized particles then are attracted to the positively grounded plate, creating a layer of caked on dust particles. Rappers are responsible for Transmitting vibrations to the electrodes causing deposited dust particles to break loose and fall into a hopper located below the precipitator.|$|E

50|$|From a {{physical}} electronic viewpoint, thermionic energy conversion is the direct production of electric power from heat by thermionic electron emission. From a thermodynamic viewpoint, {{it is the}} use of electron vapor as the working fluid in a power-producing cycle. A thermionic converter consists of a hot emitter electrode from which electrons are vaporized by thermionic emission and a colder <b>collector</b> <b>electrode</b> into which they are condensed after conduction through the interelectrode plasma. The resulting current, typically several amperes per square centimetre of emitter surface, delivers electrical power to a load at a typical potential difference of 0.5 - 1 volt and thermal efficiency of 5 - 20%, depending on the emitter temperature (1500 - 2000 K) and mode of operation.|$|E
50|$|In the {{gyrotron}} a {{hot filament}} in an electron gun {{at one end}} of the tube emits an annular-shaped (hollow tubular) beam of electrons, which is accelerated by a high-voltage anode and then travels through a large tubular resonant cavity structure in a strong axial magnetic field, usually created by a superconducting magnet around the tube. The field causes the electrons to move helically in tight circles around the magnetic field lines as they travel lengthwise through the tube. At the position in the tube where the magnetic field reaches its maximum the electrons radiate electromagnetic waves in a transverse direction (perpendicular to the axis of the tube) at their cyclotron resonance frequency. The millimeter radiation forms standing waves in the tube, which acts as an open-ended resonant cavity, and is formed into a beam, which radiates through a window in the side of the tube into a waveguide. The spent electron beam is absorbed by a <b>collector</b> <b>electrode</b> at the end of the tube.|$|E
5000|$|Klystrons amplify RF {{signals by}} {{converting}} the kinetic energy in a DC electron beam into radio frequency power. A {{beam of electrons}} is produced by a thermionic cathode (a heated pellet of low work function material), and accelerated by high-voltage electrodes (typically {{in the tens of}} kilovolts). This beam is then passed through an input cavity resonator. RF energy is fed into the input cavity at, or near, its resonant frequency, creating standing waves, which produce an oscillating voltage which acts on the electron beam. The electric field causes the electrons to [...] "bunch": electrons that pass through when the electric field opposes their motion are slowed, while electrons which pass through when the electric field is in the same direction are accelerated, causing the previously continuous electron beam to form bunches at the input frequency. To reinforce the bunching, a klystron may contain additional [...] "buncher" [...] cavities. The beam then passes through a [...] "drift" [...] tube in which the faster electrons catch up to the slower ones, creating the [...] "bunches", then through a [...] "catcher" [...] cavity. In the output [...] "catcher" [...] cavity, each bunch enters the cavity at the time in the cycle when the electric field opposes the electrons' motion, decelerating them. Thus the kinetic energy of the electrons is converted to potential energy of the field, increasing the amplitude of the oscillations. The oscillations excited in the catcher cavity are coupled out through a coaxial cable or waveguide. The spent electron beam, with reduced energy, is captured by a <b>collector</b> <b>electrode.</b>|$|E

40|$|Multistage {{collectors}} {{are commonly}} used in travelling wave tubes (TWTs), klystrons, gyrotrons and inductive output tubes (IOTs). A dc beam transfers some of its energy to the input RF wave during its travel through the interaction circuit. The purpose of a collector is to recover {{most of the remaining}} dc power from the spent beam and thereby increase both the collector and the overall efficiency. Secondary electrons play a detrimental role in collector performance. Use of the asymmetric collector geometries and application of a magnetic field in the collector region have proved to be effective in recapturing the secondaries. A fully three-dimensional simulator LKOBRA (MF) – the mainframe version of Lancaster KOBRA, has been developed at Lancaster University; this is capable of simulating multistage collectors including the effects of secondary electron emission and magnetic field. It is based on KOBRA 3 -INP 1 but has been modified and improved together with the pre- and post-processors of the package. Efficiency is an important parameter in space applications of microwave tubes so it is always desirable to optimise the collector performance to maximise the overall tube efficiency. As a first step the potentials at the <b>collector</b> <b>electrodes</b> are optimised to achieve the maximum possible theoretical efficiency. A computer code based on the well-known enumerative technique has been developed for this purpose. In the next step the geometry of the <b>collector</b> <b>electrodes</b> is optimised using an automated design package that is based on a genetic algorithm. The genetic algorithm creates a new geometry through a search procedure that works from a population of possible geometries. A new set of geometries is generated using three basic operators namely reproduction, crossover and mutation. The collector efficiency is used as the fitness parameter in the genetic algorithm that produces a new population of geometries. This package has been used to optimise the efficiency of a 4 -stage symmetric collector and a 2 -stage asymmetric collector...|$|R

5000|$|In {{a simple}} form, the gaseous {{detection}} device (GDD) employs an electrode with a voltage {{up to several}} hundred volts to collect the secondary electrons in the ESEM. The principle of this SE detector is best described by considering two parallel plates at a distance d apart with a potential difference V generating a uniform electric field E = V/d, and {{is shown in the}} [...] of the GDD. Secondary electrons released from the specimen at the point of beam impingement are driven by the field force towards the anode electrode but the electrons also move radially due to thermal diffusion from collisions with the gas molecules. The variation of electron collection fraction R within anode radius r vs. r/d, for fixed values of anode bias V, at constant product of (pressure·distance) p·d = 1 Pa·m, is given by the accompanying [...] of the GDD. All of the secondary electrons are detected if the parameters of this device are properly designed. This clearly shows that practically 100% efficiency is possible within a small radius of <b>collector</b> <b>electrode</b> with only moderate bias. At these levels of bias, no catastrophic discharge takes place. Instead, a controlled proportional multiplication of electrons is generated as the electrons collide with gas molecules releasing new electrons {{on their way to the}} anode. This principle of avalanche amplification operates similarly to proportional counters used to detect high energy radiation. The signal thus picked up by the anode is further amplified and processed to modulate a display screen and form an image as in SEM. Notably, in this design and the associated gaseous electron amplification, the product p·d is an independent parameter, so that there is a wide range of values of pressure and electrode geometry which can be described by the same characteristics. The consequence of this analysis is that the secondary electrons are possible to detect in a gaseous environment even at high pressures, depending on the engineering efficacy of any given instrument.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{possibility}} {{of building a}} high voltage electrostatic air pump for cooling of microelectronics is investigated. Existing cooling technology no longer provides adequate heat dissipation due to excessive heat generation caused by the growing component density on electronic devices. Heat sink fins are packed more closely to increase the heat exchange surface area, resulting in narrower channels between the fins. Air viscosity in narrow channels reduces the cooling efficiency of the heat sinks. Electrostatic air propulsion methods may improve airflow patterns in narrow channels. Several prototypes of the electrostatic air pump were built. Corona onset voltage was measured, and the current-voltage relationship showed a positive exponential relationship. The performance of the corona pump displayed a nearly linear voltage-air velocity relationship, a logarithmic decrease in air gap impedance between corona and <b>collector</b> <b>electrodes,</b> and a departure from classic air velocity profiles.
