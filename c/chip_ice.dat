Some of the drinks have additives to make the freezing temperature of the mix lower, so that the drink can be much colder than a water slush drink.|$|R

40|$|Summer {{deterioration}} {{of snow and}} ice surfaces due to high solar radiation and near melting temperatures hampers the year-round use of natural ice islands and smooth sea-ice areas in the Arctic Ocean, and permanent snow and ice areas in the Antarctic. Use of snow or <b>chipped</b> <b>ice</b> on ice surfaces in the Antarctic has generally provided sufficient protection to prevent deterioration and ablation, but the warmer environment of the arctic summer often precludes use of these natural materials. Sawdust has been used successfully in the California Sierras for protecting compacted-snow areas during periods of alternating above-and below-freezing temperatures and high solar radiation, but its scarcity and shipping bulk preclude its use in polar areas. Polyurethane foam has proven even more successful than sawdust as a protective covering in laboratory tests during alternating abov,e-and below-freezing temperatures and simulated solar radiation.

40|$|The {{expression}} ‘Like ’ has a {{wide variety}} of uses among English and American speakers. It may describe preference, as in (1) She likes mint <b>chip</b> <b>ice</b> cream. It may be used as a vehicle of comparison, as in (2) Trieste is like Minsk on steroids. Sometimes it is used among American adolescents as quasi-quotational device that reenacts a private or public drama, as in (3) She was like, we {{need to get out of}} here fast. 1 And sometimes it used scattershot by said adolescents (and others) as a hedging discourse particle (cf. Sigel 2002), as in (4) He got, like, eight job offers in his fourth year of grad school. Each of these uses raises distinct theoretical issues: What exactly is the second relatum of the preferential ‘like’? Does the ‘like ’ of comparison express a constant, trivial relation or a contextually variable, restricted one? How do the possible objects of quotational ‘like ’ differ from those for standard quotation? How doe...|$|E
