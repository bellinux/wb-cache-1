Assistance has included the distribution of child survival packages in Uganda; and assistance in training community healthcare workers to provide free diagnoses and treatments to children in Cameroon, resulting in an estimated 40 percent reduction in child mortality. The cruise line additionally provides opportunity for travelers to donate financially and purchase merchandise in their onboard retail shops, with all proceeds going to support Five & Alive.|$|R

50|$|Photobucket is an American image hosting {{and video}} hosting website, web {{services}} suite, and online community. Photobucket hosts more than 10 billion images from 100 million registered members, who upload {{more than four}} million images and videos per day from the Web and connected digital devices. Photobucket's headquarters are in Denver with regional offices in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco. The website was founded in 2003 by Alex Welch and Darren <b>Crystal</b> and received <b>funding</b> from Trinity Ventures. It was acquired by Fox Interactive Media in 2007. In December 2009, Fox's parent company, News Corp, sold Photobucket to Seattle mobile imaging startup Ontela. Ontela then renamed itself Photobucket Inc. and continues to operate as Photobucket.|$|R
5000|$|In 2007, a {{development}} company, Crystal Developers, sought {{to build an}} apartment complex next to the fort's original [...] "footprint". However, the Friends of Upper Fort Garry, a group dedicated to developing an historical interpretive park at the site, was convened to oppose them. The plan called for an interpretive centre just outside the old fort's walls, and a large surface parking lot {{that would have been}} placed closer to the walls than the apartment itself. After a City of Winnipeg-imposed deadline to raise funds to build a park on the site was nearing, Crystal Developers decided to grant the Friends an additional two years to finish raising the needed <b>funds.</b> <b>Crystal</b> ultimately bowed out of its proposed development plans. Two years later the City of Winnipeg approved the construction by Crystal Developers of a 25-storey apartment tower just west of the original location, on Assiniboine Ave.|$|R
40|$|The tetrapyridyl ligand bbpya (bbpya=N,N-bis(2, 2 ′-bipyrid- 6 -yl) amine) and its {{mononuclear}} coordination compound [Fe(bbpya) (NCS) ] (1) were prepared. According to magnetic susceptibility, {{differential scanning calorimetry}} {{fitted to}} Sorai's domain model, and powder X-ray diffraction measurements, 1 is low-spin at room temperature, and it exhibits spin crossover (SCO) at an exceptionally high transition temperature of T= 418 K. Although the SCO of compound 1 spans a temperature range of more than 150 K, it {{is characterized by a}} wide (21 K) and dissymmetric hysteresis cycle, which suggests cooperativity. The crystal structure of the LS phase of compound 1 shows strong N-H⋯S intermolecular H-bonding interactions that explain, at least in part, the cooperative SCO behavior observed for complex 1. DFT and CASPT 2 calculations under vacuum demonstrate that the bbpya ligand generates a stronger ligand field around the iron(II) core than its analogue bapbpy (N,N'-di(pyrid- 2 -yl) - 2, 2 ′-bipyridine- 6, 6 ′-diamine); this stabilizes the LS state and destabilizes the HS state in 1 compared with [Fe(bapbpy) (NCS) ] (2). Periodic DFT calculations suggest that crystal-packing effects are significant for compound 2, in which they destabilize the HS state by about 1500 cm. The much lower transition temperature found for the SCO of 2 compared to 1 appears to be due to the combined effects of the different ligand field strengths and <b>crystal</b> packing. <b>Funded</b> by: COST action.

50|$|Sometime {{after the}} events of the {{previous}} film in Romania, a female anaconda and a male anaconda are being held in a genetic research facility owned by Wexel Hall, for experimentation. The research project is led by Dr. Amanda Hayes (<b>Crystal</b> Allen) and <b>funded</b> by J.D. Murdoch (John Rhys-Davies), a well-known industrialist. While visiting the facility, Murdoch provokes the male anaconda with a large flashlight, and has it gassed to calm it down. However, as Murdoch, his assistant Pinkus (Ryan McCluskey) and Daryl (Alin Constantinescu) are about to leave, the anaconda kills Daryl and breaks through his enclosure's wall. As it escapes, it kills many of the people working in the lab. In looking through the facility, Amanda and Professor Eric Kane (Serban Celea), realize that the male snake freed the Queen anaconda. The male anaconda soon snuck up behind them and crushed Eric to death in its coils and bites his head off. Murdoch calls in a team of animal hunters, led by Hammett (David Hasselhoff), to capture both snakes. Amanda and Pinkus go with them. At a small farm {{in the middle of the}} woods, the owner is eaten alive by one of the snakes.|$|R
