40|$|Abstract. In this work, {{hydroforming}} of X-shape {{pipe connection}} made of copper is investigated by experiment and numerical simulation. The {{length of the}} <b>connection</b> <b>branch</b> is always a concern. The main purpose {{of the work is}} the study of the effect of the branch end boundary condition and the load path on the branch height. An elastic material (called the constraint), such as a spring, is used for controlling the branch to grow to a certain extent. It is shown that the branch end condition, if designed properly, gives rise to the considerable increase in the branch length. The increase, however, depends also on the load path which must be determined by experiment or numerical simulation...|$|E
40|$|The {{analytical}} equations of {{the transfer}} matrix method are further derived for the multi-coupled vibration of flexural and longitudinal waves in a periodic dual-layered beam structure with <b>connection</b> <b>branches,</b> with full consideration given to the flexural and longitudinal motions that are tri-coupled at each connection. Measurements of mobilities at the junctions on the uni-layered beam and the cross-layered beam are made. The numerical results agree well with the experimental results at all frequencies from 10 to 2000 Hz, which verifies the theoretical methodology for the multi-coupled vibration in a finite dual-layered beam. The cross-layer energy transmission is calculated, which reveals that the transmitted longitudinal energy is enhanced {{not only at the}} longitudinal resonant modes but also at the flexural resonant modes of the <b>connection</b> <b>branches</b> due to the structural wave coupling. The flexural energy is excited by wave coupling and becomes stronger at the longitudinal resonant modes and the flexural resonant modes of the <b>connection</b> <b>branches.</b> The cross-layer vibration motions from coupled waves in the branches can be effectively controlled by the attached cantilevers with mass at the resonance modes. This method can be used to control the structure-borne sound transmission in multi-layer beam structures. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|R

50|$|A single bus {{consists}} of a wire pair with 70-85 Ω impedance at 1 MHz. Where a circular connector is used, its center pin {{is used for the}} high (positive) Manchester bi-phase signal.

The bit rate is 1.0 megabit per second (1 bit per μs). The combined accuracy and long-term stability of the bit rate is only specified to be within ±0.1%; the short-term clock stability must be within ±0.01%.

40|$|A {{study of}} the {{structure-borne}} sound power transmission through a finite periodic dual-layer beam structure with <b>connection</b> <b>branches</b> was conducted. The {{results suggest that the}} power transmitted through the beam structure into the supporting structure depends not only on the characteristics of the source and the supporting structure, but also on the attenuation of the periodic beam elements with the coupling branches and the exciting position of the source. The results also reveal the model under the mono-coupling condition to be similar to that under the multi-coupling condition in the relatively low frequency region. The transmitted power was strongly attenuated in a number of frequency regions, and in a few regions the power was even transmitted into the second layer of the supporting structure. The analysis indicated that this study is useful in understanding the structure-borne sound transmission from the first layer into the second layer of the beam structure.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{investigation}} {{on the effect}} of inter-micellar <b>connection</b> (<b>branches)</b> on the rheology of wormlike micelles. The system chosen is made of lecithin, minute amounts of water and organic solvents. Lecithin and water self-assemble into wormlike reverse micelles that can be branched or unbranched depending on the oil composition (and on the water content). In this respect, cyclohexane favours disconnected reverse micelles while isooctane promotes the formation of branches. By using mixtures of cyclohexane and isooctane as oil phase and different water/lecithin ratios, the branch density of the system can be finely tuned. PGSE-NMR experiments allow to distinguish between branches free (unbranched) and branched systems and the response of the very same samples to mechanical stress has been measured by rheology. This allows, for the first time, an experimental correlation between rheological properties and the presence of branches. It turned out that the presence of few inter-micellar connections sensibly decreases the zero-shear viscosity measured in steady state flow curves. Comparison with oscillatory rheology experiments indicates that the main effect of branches is to shorten the terminal relaxation time by speeding-up the reptation...|$|R
40|$|High {{acoustic}} energy {{is known to}} cause vibrations in pipes, and in some severe cases acoustic induced vibration can lead to fatigue failure at <b>branch</b> <b>connections</b> with high stress concentration. Industry guidelines suggest using mitigation measures such as fabricated full wrap-around reinforcement pad (re-pad) or Sweepolet fittings at <b>branch</b> <b>connections.</b> Effectiveness of these mitigation measures is evaluated via a finite element analysis of four types of branch connections; (i) Sockolet, (ii) Sockolet with 2 ” wide partial re-pad, (iii) Sockolet with full wrap-around re-pad, and (iv) Sweepolet. Four distinct acoustic frequency ranges (1 / 3 octave bands) with associated sound pressure levels are used as the excitation source. Maximum stress levels in the main header pipe at the branch tie-in are monitored to assess the potential for vibration damage. Of the four <b>branch</b> <b>connections,</b> Sockolet with full wrap-around re-pad {{is found to be}} least susceptible to damage, followed by the Sweepolet.

Feedback consolidation can be explained with the aid of figure 1. The consolidation operation is required to avoid the feedback implosion problem, where the number of BRM cells received by the source is proportional to the number of leaves in the multicast tree. In addition, the source ACR should not keep fluctuating due to the varying feedback received from different leaves. Consolidation noise can occur when feedback from some branches is not always received at the time when the RM cells need to be returned by the branch point.
