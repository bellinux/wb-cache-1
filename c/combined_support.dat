25|$|UKIP {{received}} 26.6% of {{the vote}} at the European elections in 2014, and though their support in the polls for Westminster never reached this level, it did rise up to over 15% through that year. 2014 was also marked by the Scottish independence referendum. Despite the 'No' vote winning, support for the Scottish National Party rose quickly after the referendum, and had reached 43% in Scotland {{by the end of}} the year, up 23 points from the 2010 general election, largely at the expense of Labour (−16 points in Scotland) and the Liberal Democrats (−13 points). In Wales, where polls were less frequent, the 2012–2014 period saw a smaller decline in Labour's lead over the second-placed Conservative Party, from 28 points to 17. These votes went mainly to UKIP (+8 points) and Plaid Cymru (+2 points). The rise of UKIP and SNP, alongside the smaller increases for Plaid Cymru and the Green Party (from around 2% to 6%) saw the <b>combined</b> <b>support</b> of the Conservative and Labour party fall to a record low of around 65%. Within this the decline came predominantly from Labour, whose lead fell to under 2 points by the end of 2014. Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrat vote, which had held at about 10% since late 2010, declined further to about 8%.|$|E
25|$|An {{executive}} presidency {{has been}} a long-standing proposal of the governing AKP and its founder, the current President of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. In October 2016, the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) announced its co-operation for producing draft proposals with the government, with the <b>combined</b> <b>support</b> of both AKP and MHP MPs being sufficient to put forward the proposals to a referendum following a parliamentary vote in January. Those in favour of a 'Yes' vote argued that the changes were necessary for a strong and stable Turkey, arguing that an executive presidency would bring about an end to unstable coalition governments that had dominated Turkish politics since the 1960s up until 2002. The 'No' campaign {{have argued that the}} proposals would concentrate too much {{power in the hands of}} the President, effectively dismantling the separation of powers and taking legislative authority away from Parliament. Critics argued that the proposed system would resemble an 'elected dictatorship' with no ability to hold the executive to account, leading effectively to a 'democratic suicide' and autocracy. Three days before the referendum, one of Erdoğan's aides called for a federal system should the 'Yes' vote prevail, causing a backlash from the pro-Yes MHP. Both sides of the campaign have been accused of using divisive and extreme rhetoric, with Erdoğan accusing all 'No' voters of being terrorists siding with the plotters of the failed 2016 coup.|$|E
500|$|Mégret and his faction {{left the}} FN in January 1999 and founded the National Republican Movement (MNR), {{effectively}} splitting the FN in half at most levels. Many {{of those who}} joined the new MNR had joined the FN in the mid-1980s, {{in part from the}} Nouvelle Droite, with a vision of building bridges to the parliamentary right. Many had also been particularly influential in intellectualising the FN's policies on immigration, identity and [...] "national preference", and, following the split, Le Pen denounced them as [...] "extremist" [...] and [...] "racist". Support for the parties was almost equal in the 1999 European election, as the FN polled its lowest national score since 1984 with just 5.7%, and the MNR won 3.3%.

However, Bjelke-Petersen insisted he was still premier, and even sought the support of his old Liberal and Labor foes in order to stay in office. Campbell refused to terminate Bjelke-Petersen's commission, even though Bjelke-Petersen would have been short of a majority even with the <b>combined</b> <b>support</b> of the Liberals and Labor. He would have needed a significant number of National floor-crossings to keep his post. However, Campbell had received legal advice that he could dismiss Bjelke-Petersen only if he tried to stay in office after being defeated in the legislature.

2500|$|On 26 December 2004, {{a massive}} {{submerged}} earthquake and ensuing tsunami waves {{swept across the}} Indian Ocean basin, causing widespread devastation and killing over 230,000 people in fourteen countries. The military element of humanitarian and relief effort was designated Operation Unified Assistance {{under the direction of}} <b>Combined</b> <b>Support</b> Force 536 (CSF-536). On 28 December 2004, Carrier Strike Group Nine set sail from Hong Kong and arrived off the coast of Indonesia near Banda Aceh, Sumatra, on 1 January 2005. Rear Admiral William D. Crowder, was designated as commander, <b>Combined</b> <b>Support</b> Group Indonesia, as part of CSF-536. [...] Abraham Lincolns Air Transportation Office coordinated the flow of supplies into the region, and the carrier provided air traffic control for the relief effort. SH-60 helicopters Seahawks from squadrons HSL-47 and HS-2 ferried supplies from collection points in Sumatra for trans-shipment to disaster victims in the vicinity. The intensive nature of the support missions drove the Seahawks to log over 1,000hours, {{more than three times the}} expected wear-and-tear of standard deployments. HSL-47 itself logged over 600hours during the month of January 2005. Strike group ships, such as the destroyer Benfold, served as re-fueling stations for helicopters involved in relief efforts. Benfold provided 155gallons (586.7liters) of fuel a day, accounting for more than 14,500gallons (54,888.47liters) of fuel since this disaster relief operation began. [...] Benfold also served as a mothership for Naval Oceanographic Office team conducting safety of navigation surveys of the altered Indonesian coastlines that had been affected by the tsunami at the request of the Indonesian government. The fast combat support ship Rainier provided underway replenishment support to 32 American, British, and Australian warships involved in Operation Unified Assistance. Also, sailors and Marines from Carrier Strike Group Nine went ashore to provide humanitarian assistance. Sailors from the Abraham Lincolns Engineering Department Repair Division designed a potable water manifold to help bring fresh water to Aceh Province, Sumatra, with the system beginning to ship the much-needed fresh water on 4 January. Also, teams from the strike group, including the destroyer Benfold, flew into Banda Aceh daily to work at the Sultan IskandarMuda Air Force Base to unload humanitarian aid from trucks to waiting helicopters that deliver the aid to survivors in remote locations.|$|E
2500|$|The {{literary}} {{output of}} the Canadian-born author Grant Allen, who {{was brought up in}} Birmingham from the age of 13 and attended King Edward's School, was prodigious and varied even by Victorian standards. The Scottish critic Andrew Lang called him [...] "the most versatile, beyond comparison, of any man in our age". Allen {{is best known for his}} best-selling but controversial 1895 novel The Woman Who Did, whose tragic plot <b>combined</b> <b>support</b> for free love with opposition to the institution of marriage, and whose success scandalised Victorian society. He is also noted for innovations in detective fiction, creating independent-minded female detectives modelled on the feminist ideal of the New Woman in Miss Cayley's Adventures; and for playing with the conventions of the crime genre in An African Millionaire, where the criminal is the hero, and the short story [...] "The Great Ruby Robbery", where the culprit turns out to be the detective investigating the crime. Allen's incorporation of his own scientific preoccupations into novels such as the time travel-based The British Barbarians also made him an important early pioneer of science fiction. H. G. Wells later wrote to him, acknowledging that [...] "this field of scientific romance with a philosophical element that I am trying to cultivate, properly belongs to you." ...|$|E

2500|$|Though ECT {{has become}} a widely {{discouraged}} treatment, many people have recently pushed {{for the return of}} this controversial procedure. The 1975 film One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest has convinced viewers that ECT is a horrific procedure which only results in the patient's complete memory loss. Scientists have since debunked the notion that patients suffer acute memory loss after treatment, but the horrors of ECT present in the movie still remain a setback. In the last decade, patients have returned to using ECT to treat various mental illnesses including depression and bipolar disorder. Overcoming the looming controversy has proven difficult for doctors and scientists, and various campaigns to challenge negative stereotypes have gained popularity in the past few years. In 2014, the American Psychiatric Association launched a petition to reclassify ECT as a low-risk treatment. Though many people still believe ECT to be an inhumane procedure, many pro-ECT patients have publicly come forward with their positive response to the treatment. One patient by the name of Shelley Miller claims that [...] "medications have a success rate of 50-60% of patients getting better, while ECT succeeds at a rate of 70-90%." [...] With the <b>combined</b> <b>support</b> of patients and doctors, ECT is slowly challenging stereotypes and making its way back into the medical community. However, the negative stigma of ECT still maintains the upper hand in society today.|$|E
