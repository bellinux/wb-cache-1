60|$|Then the hateful town {{feeling of}} {{lassitude}} returned {{on me and}} all my vigour was gone, all pleasure in life ended. Thereafter for a fortnight I spent the time moping about the house; {{then there was a}} spell of frosty weather with a bleak cutting wind to tell us that it was winter, which even in those latitudes can be very cold. One day after early dinner my mother and sisters went in the <b>carriage</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> a visit to a neighbouring estancia, and my brothers being out or absent from home I was left alone. The verandah appeared to me the warmest place I could find, as the sun shone on it warm and bright, and there I settled down on a chair placed against the wall at the side of a heap of sacks of meal or something which had been left there, and formed a nice shelter from the wind.|$|E

50|$|In 1829, Jægersborg Allé {{was finally}} opened <b>to</b> the public. <b>Carriages</b> had <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> a fee which was {{collected}} at a boom barrier in Charlottenlund.The area became more accessible {{with the opening}} of the Læampenborg and Ltngby Railways in 1863. The land along the road was gradually built over.|$|R
60|$|Captain Asher {{had seen}} the {{carriage}} stop, and knew that Mrs. Easterfield was talking to Olive, {{but he did not}} think himself called upon to intrude upon them. But now it was necessary for him to go to the tollhouse. Two men in a buggy with a broken spring and a coffee bag laid over the loins of an imperfectly set-up horse had been waiting for nearly a minute behind Mrs. Easterfield's <b>carriage,</b> desiring <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> their toll and pass through. So the captain went out of the garden-gate, collected the toll from the two men, and directed them to go round the carriage and pass on in peace, which they did.|$|R
5000|$|On January 1, 2003, TNT {{launched}} a substitute feed called TNT Plus, {{although it does}} not appear this was ever reflected in the channel's on-air identity. The apparent sole purpose of its establishment was to force renegotiations with cable and satellite providers <b>to</b> increase <b>carriage</b> fees <b>to</b> help <b>pay</b> for TNT's new NBA and NASCAR contracts well before the channel's distribution agreements with providers were scheduled to come up for renewal. In theory, TNT Plus was to have been the sole carrier of Turner's NBA and NASCAR coverage from that point forward, while any providers still carrying the original TNT would have seen replacement programming instead. Although it appears that Comcast did not immediately sign on to carry TNT Plus, {{there is no evidence that}} Turner had actually pulled its sports programming from the [...] "original" [...] TNT.|$|R

50|$|His {{funeral was}} held in St Margarets, after which his coffin was carried on a gun {{carriage}} with a military escort. He was conveyed from St Margarets, across Richmond Bridge, and on arriving outside Richmond Town Hall, the Mayor, Councillors, and a crowd of several thousand had assembled <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> their respects, many of which then followed the gun <b>carriage</b> <b>to</b> Richmond Cemetery.|$|R

6000|$|... "Why, you may {{meet with}} {{accidents}} {{that will cost}} money to repair, or get into difficulties which will require money to get out of. For instance, you may lose your ticket, and so have <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> twice over; or you may get lost yourself, in Paris, and so have to hire {{a man with a}} <b>carriage</b> <b>to</b> bring you home. For all such things, the money is not to come from your purse. Your father will pay." ...|$|R
5000|$|Septimus {{arranges}} for a <b>carriage</b> <b>to</b> fetch Harry {{from his}} school. When Harry arrives, Septimus explains {{that in order}} <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> back the £20,000 plus interest that is owed to Harry, Septimus would have to sell the estate. Septimus convinces Harry that Mr. Carter cared little for the estate, but most desired a school in Cranford. Furthermore, selling the Hanbury estate {{would result in the}} loss of jobs and land tenancies for its many employees and residents. Septimus offers to solve this dilemma by giving Harry £5,000 immediately if he will agree to relinquish his claim to the balance of the money that is owed to him. Harry will then be able <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for the village school, while Septimus will (he claims) retain the estate. Despite the fact that Harry is only fourteen and has had no further advice, they seal the deal by shaking hands in a [...] "gentlemen’s agreement." ...|$|R
