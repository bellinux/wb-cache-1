50|$|Bromeliads are {{plants that}} are adapted to various climates. Foliage takes {{different}} shapes, from needle-thin to broad and flat, symmetrical to irregular, spiky to soft. The foliage, which usually grows in a rosette, is widely patterned and <b>colored.</b> <b>Leaf</b> colors range from maroon, through shades of green, to gold. Varieties may have leaves with red, yellow, white and cream variations. Others may be spotted with purple, red, or cream, while others have different colors on the tops and bottoms of the leaves.|$|E

50|$|The twist-necked turtle now {{represents}} the only species of Platemys {{and can be}} distinguished from close relatives (Acanthochelys) by its doubly flat body plan, both a flattened shell and a flattened head. Also, this turtle displays an unusual dual grooved pattern on the carapace. P. platycephala inhabits a wide range compared to other Acanthochelys turtles. Two subspecies, P. p. platycephala and P. p. melanonota are described based on color pattern. Camouflage is highly useful for the twist-necked turtle because it inhabits shallow pools and creek beds. The orange and brown head pattern {{makes it difficult to}} spot from above because of similarly <b>colored</b> <b>leaf</b> litter along small pools and creek beds. Other distinctions include a hook {{at the base of the}} foot for copulation in males and a specialized opening at the base of the plastron for oviposition (egg deposit).|$|E

40|$|Erythronium dens-canis is an early-flowering {{understory}} lily {{of southern}} Europe with two leaves {{and a single}} flower, although a number of plants have only one leaf and do not flower. The leaves are mottled with silvery flecks and brown patches, that gradually vanish turning to a lively green color. The nature and function of this striking variegation pattern were investigated in differently <b>colored</b> <b>leaf</b> parts following the springtime color change. Tissue organization was examined by light and electron microscopy; photosynthetic pigments were analyzed by spectrophotometry and HPLC; chlorophyll fluorescence parameters were evaluated by MINI-PAM. The results showed that brown patches originated in vacuolar anthocyanins in the subepidermal cell layer while air spaces between the upper epidermis and underlying chlorenchyma resulted in silvery flecks. The two leaf areas {{did not differ in}} photosynthetic pigments, chloroplast organization and photosynthetic parameters (Fv/Fm, NPQ, rETR). Greening of brown patches due to anthocyanin resorption was faster in non-flowering plants than in flowering ones, occurring only when young fruits were developing. Anthocyanin disappearance did not change the structural-functional features of photosynthetic tissues. As a whole the results suggest that the anthocyanin pigmentation of E. dens-canis leaves does not affect the photosynthetic light use and has no photoprotective function. It is proposed that the complex leaf color pattern may act as a camouflage to escape herbivores, while the reflective silvery spots may have a role in attracting pollinators of this earlyflowering species...|$|E
40|$|Five {{sulfonylurea}} {{urea herbicides}} and one PGR {{were applied to}} a Tifgreen bermudagrass putting green to determine their response as spring applied transition aids to enhance the removal of Poa trivialis ovrseed. All sufonyl urea herbicide caused marginal to extreme injury to Poa trivialis by 9 DAT, which lasted at least a minimum of 3 weeks. Manor caused {{the least amount of}} injury and discoloration, but had little effect in promoting the transition back to bermudagrass. Tranxit caused extreme plot injury (leaf bronzing), but forced transition. The injury resulted in unacceptable quality. Embark PGR enhanced transition at 9 DAT only, with acceptable quality. After a second application of Emark, quality was reduced to sub-marginal levels, which was caused by straw <b>colored</b> <b>leaf</b> sheaths. TADS increased Bermuda transition at 9 DAT, but not at 23 DAT, regardless of the addition of fungicides, or not. The addition of fungicides to TADS in general did not affect color, quality or turf transition, with the exception on Jens 7 (38 DAT) when the lower rate (0. 10 ounce/p/M) with fungicide had excellent quality (6. 8) due to readily observed visual density (7. 5). Trifloxysulfuron caused increased transition at 9 DAT only, and developed moderate turf injury, as well as poor turf color at 9 and 23 DAT. All entries produce turfs with good color, quality and density by 31 July. After a standard aerification and topdressing, and fertilization with 1. 5 lbs of additional -N- / M.
