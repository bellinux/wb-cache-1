40|$|We have {{examined}} DNA replication in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii chloroplasts in vivo when chloroplast type II topoisomerases are inactivated with sublethal doses of novobiocin. DNA replication is at first inhibited under these conditions. However, after a delay of several hours, chloroplast chromosomes initiate a novobiocin-insensitive mode of DNA replication. This replication starts preferentially near a hotspot of recombination {{in the large}} inverted repeats, instead of from the normal chloroplast origins, oriA and oriB. It replicates one, but not the other single-copy region of the <b>chloroplast</b> <b>chromosome.</b> We speculate that novobiocin-insensitive DNA replication in chloroplasts requires recombination in this preferred initiation region...|$|E
40|$|Plants are {{increasingly}} becoming attractive bioreactors for production of commercially important proteins. Plastid transformation, {{which has been}} recently developed for this purpose, offers several advantages. (1) Each molecular unit of the chloroplast genome has a relatively small size, ca. 150 kbp, which facilitates homologous recombination and hence permits introduction of DNA modifications such as deletions or insertions at precise locations into the <b>chloroplast</b> <b>chromosome.</b> This is {{in contrast with the}} random insertion of DNA fragments into the nuclear genome obtained using the well-known method of gene transfer using Agrobacterium tumefaciens. (2) The overall organization of the chloroplast genome is of prokaryotic type, and therefore complex phenomenon such as position effects and epigenetic controls encountered in nuclear gene regulation do not exist. (3) The <b>chloroplast</b> <b>chromosome</b> has a large number – up to one hundred – of copies per mature chloroplast. For example, 10 000 chromosome copies per cell are present in mesophyll, which have approximately 100 chloroplasts/cell. Consequently, the amount of heterologous protein corresponding to a given transgene can reach a relative high level, e. g., in some cases up to 45 % of total soluble proteins. 1 (4) Finally, most plant species of agronomic interest do not transmit the chloroplast genome by pollen, as their chloroplasts are maternally inherited. Maternal inheritance avoids gene dispersion and transfer to other, non-transformed, related plant species. Application of plastid transformation technology is limited by the difficulty of obtaining regulated, selective expression of the transgenes. Except for the blue light-inducible psbD promoter, there are no specific inducible endogenous promoters available; hence transgenes are constitutively expressed throughout plant development. As a consequence, plant growth is often heavily disturbed by th...|$|E
40|$|Two adjacent, divergently transcribed, developmentally {{regulated}} {{genes of}} the maize <b>chloroplast</b> <b>chromosome</b> have different superhelical density/transcriptional activation profiles when transcribed in vitro by the homologous DNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Promoter-specific transcription {{of the gene}} for the beta and epsilon subunits of coupling factor 1 (cf 1 BE) increases and plateaus from templates of increasing negative superhelicity, while transcription of the gene for ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase large subunit (rcL) rises and then falls. Maximal transcription from the two promoters occurs at different template negative superhelical densities and transcription of the two genes is stimulated to different degrees. The different superhelicity profiles alter the molar ratios of the two transcripts over an order of magnitude. Changes in DNA conformation represent one possible mechanism for the differential regulation of the genes...|$|E
30|$|The main {{mitochondrial}} and <b>chloroplast</b> <b>chromosomes</b> are circular (also called master circles) and do {{not have}} arms. Locus IDs for genes found on organellar chromosomes will use the symbols ‘Mt’ for mitochondrion and ‘Pt’ for plastid (chloroplast), respectively, instead of the chromosome number designations used for nuclear genes. These letters will be followed by a letter “g” indicating that the locus corresponds to a gene, followed by a seven-digit number (assuming there will be fewer than 10, 000 genes per chromosome) indicating the sequential order of genes along an organellar chromosome, independent of the polarity of the strand, in ascending order from the first base pair of the completely sequenced molecule to the last base pair in the linearized molecule (as submitted by the author of the sequence to any of the reference sequence databases, namely NCBI-GenBank, DDBJ, or EMBL). For example, OsPtg 0000100 indicates the first gene on the rice plastid genome. Looking at the GenBank entries for plastid genomes sequenced from O. sativa cv. Nipponbare, this would refer to the gene, PSBA (82 – 1, 143  bp), as referenced by GenBank entry NC_ 001320.|$|R
40|$|Restriction {{endonuclease}} recognition {{sites and}} genes for rRNAs were first mapped on <b>chloroplast</b> <b>chromosomes</b> in 1975 – 1976. This {{marked the beginning}} of the application of molecular biology tools to photosynthesis research. In the first phase, knowledge about proteins involved in photosynthesis was used to identify plastid and nuclear genes encoding these proteins on cloned segments of DNA. Soon afterwards the DNA sequences of the cloned genes revealed the full primary sequences of the proteins. Knowledge of the primary amino acid sequences provided deeper understanding of the functioning of the protein and interactions among proteins of the photosynthetic apparatus. Later, as chloroplast DNA sequencing proceeded, genes were discovered that encoded proteins that had not been known to be part of the photosynthetic apparatus. This more complete knowledge of the composition of reaction centers and of the primary amino acid sequences of individual proteins comprising the reaction centers opened the way to determining the three-dimensional structures of reaction centers. At present, the availability of cloned genes, knowledge of the gene sequences and systems developed to genetically manipulate photosynthetic organisms is permitting experimental inquiries to be made into crucial details of the photosynthetic process.

40|$|We have mapped all the {{cleavage}} {{sites for}} the restriction endonucleases BstEII, Kpn I, Pst I, Pvu II, Sac I, Sal I, Sma I, and Xho I on the circular <b>chloroplast</b> <b>chromosomes</b> from mung bean and pea. The mung bean chloroplast genome measures 150 kilobase pairs (kb) in length; it includes two identical sequences of 23 kb that contain the ribosomal genes and are arranged as an inverted repeat separated by single-copy regions of 21 and 83 kb. The pea chloroplast genome is only 120 kb in size, has only one set of ribosomal genes, and does not possess any detectable repeated sequences. The mung bean inverted repeat structure is common to all other nonleguminous higher plant chloroplast genomes studied, whereas the pea structure has been found only in the closely related legume Vicia faba. We conclude from these data that loss of one copy of the inverted repeat sequence has occurred only rarely during {{the evolution of the}} Angiosperms, {{and in the case of}} the legumes after the divergence of the mung bean line from the pea-Vicia line. We present hybridization data indicating that rearrangements that change the linear order of homologous sequences within the chloroplast genome have been quite frequent during the course of legume evolution...|$|R
40|$|Prominent polypeptides with {{apparent}} molecular {{masses of}} 180, 120, 85, and 38 kDa {{are found in}} an extensively purified preparation of maize chloroplast DNA-dependent RNA polymerase that retains the capacity to initiate transcription of the cloned chloroplast gene rbcL correctly and the requirement for a supercoiled DNA template for specific and active transcription. Amino-terminal amino acid sequences of the 180 -, 120 -, and 38 -kDa polypeptides have been determined and found to correspond precisely to the sequences deduced from the 5 ' ends of the maize chloroplast rpoC 2, rpoB, and rpoA genes, respectively. These experiments show that these chloroplast rpo genes encode the prominent polypeptides in the highly enriched maize chloroplast RNA polymerase preparation and support the conclusion that these polypeptides are functional components of the enzyme. The rpoB, rpoC 1, and rpoC 2 genes have been mapped on the maize <b>chloroplast</b> <b>chromosome...</b>|$|E
40|$|In the {{presence}} of the S polypeptide, maize chloroplast DNA-dependent RNA polymerase preferentially transcribes sequences within the 2200 -nucleotide-pair-long maize <b>chloroplast</b> <b>chromosome</b> fragment Eco [unk] from a supercoiled chimeric plasmid cloned in Escherichia coli [Jolly, S. O. & Bogorad, L. (1980) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77, 822 - 826]. Eco [unk] contains one gene for tRNAHis and one for a 1. 6 -kilobase RNA that includes an open reading frame. These two genes overlap by at least a few nucleotides and are transcribed divergently from complementary DNA strands. This indicates possible transcriptional regulation of chloroplast DNA at the nucleotide level. The 5 ′ end of tRNAHis (G-U-G) isolated from maize chloroplasts is indistinguishable from that of the transcript produced from Eco [unk] in vitro by maize chloroplast DNA-dependent RNA polymerase. This purified system initiates RNA synthesis faithfully and exhibits preference for some chloroplast genes. Maize chloroplast DNA for tRNAHis lacks the sequence C-C-A at its 3 ′ terminus; it is presumably added post-transcriptionally. Maize tRNAHis has both prokaryotic and eukaryotic features...|$|E
40|$|The single {{chloroplast}} of the alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii contains {{at least}} 100 {{copies of the}} <b>chloroplast</b> <b>chromosome.</b> It is not known how the chloroplast (or cell) becomes homoplasmic for a mutation that arises {{in one of these}} copies. Under suitable selection conditions, clones with chloroplast mutations for streptomycin resistance induced by methyl methanesulfonate can be recovered with direct plating after mutagenesis. Using an adaptation of the Luria-Delbrück fluctuation test, mutagenized cultures grown on nonselective liquid medium for seven to nine doublings show negligible proliferation of cells capable of forming such mutant colonies. In contrast, cells among the same cultures with reduced nuclear mutations conferring streptomycin resistance reveal considerable clonal propagation prior to plating on selection medium. Reconstruction growth-rate experiments show no reduced growth of cells with chloroplast mutations relative to either wild-type cells or to those with nuclear mutations. We propose that newly arising chloroplast mutations and their copies are usually transmitted to only one daughter cell for several cell generations by reductional divisions of the chloroplast genome. In the absence of recombination and mixing, such a reductional partition of chloroplast alleles would readily permit the formation of homoplasmic lines without the need for selection...|$|E
40|$|Cloned {{genes from}} tobacco, spinach, and pea {{were used as}} {{hybridization}} probes to localize 36 protein genes on the <b>chloroplast</b> <b>chromosomes</b> of four legumes — mung bean, common bean, soybean, and pea. The first three chloroplast DNAs (cpDNAs), all of which retain a large inverted repeat, have an identical gene order with but one exception. A 78 kb segment encompassing nearly the entire large single copy region is inverted in mung bean and common bean relative to soybean and non-legumes. The simplest evolutionary explanation for this difference is a 78 kb inversion, with one endpoint between rps 8 and inf A and the second between psb A and rpl 2. However, we can not rule out a two-step re-arrangement (consisting of successive expansion and contraction of the inverted repeat) leading to the relocation of a block of six ribosomal protein genes (rps 19 - rps 8) {{from one end of}} the large single copy region to the other. Analysis of gene locations in pea cpDNA, which lacks the large inverted repeat, combined with cross-hybridization studies using 59 clones covering the mung bean genome, leads to a refined picture of the position and nature of the numerous rearrangements previously described in the pea genome. A minimum of eight large inversions are postulated to account for these rearrangements. None of these inversions disrupt groups of genes that are transcriptionally linked in angiosperm cpDNA. Rather, the end-points of inversions are associated with relatively spacer-rich segments of the genome, many of which contain tRNA genes. All of the pea-specific inversions are shown to be positionally distinct from those recently described in a closely related legume, broad bean...|$|R
40|$|What is {{it about}} {{movement}} in cells that commands our attention? What biologist has not enjoyed turning a microscope on a cell, almost any cell, really, and watching all the commotion? When vesicles, mitochondria, <b>chloroplasts,</b> nuclei, or <b>chromosomes</b> move, we are being treated to an elegant, easily observable manifestation of molecular events. Decades of effort to understand intracellular movement {{have given rise to}} two of the great thrusts of modern cell biology: the study of which things go where, usually referred to as intracellular trafficking; and the identification of the protein machines that generate movement, the molecular motors. But we have an incomplete picture of how the cell’s array of motor proteins gives rise to the variety of journeys that their cargoes make. The kinesin motors that generate movement along microtubule tracks are a case in point (Vale and Fletterick, 1997). As with other motor proteins, the dyneins or myosins, the study of kinesin by the methods of molecular genetics has demonstrated that kinesins are a large family of related motor proteins present across all eukaryotic phyla, and numbering 30 – 40 members in humans and mice (Kim and Endow, 2000...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBackground: The co-chaperone Hop [heat shock protein (HSP) {{organizing}} protein] {{has been}} shown to act as an adaptor for protein folding and maturation, in concert with Hsp 70 and Hsp 90. The hop gene is of eukaryotic origin. Likewise, the chloroplast elongation factor G (cEF-G) catalyzes the translocation step in chloroplast protein synthesis. The chl-fus gene, which encodes the cEF-G protein, is of plastid origin. Both proteins, Hop and cEF-G, derived from domain duplications. It was demonstrated that the nuclear chl-fus gene locates in opposite orientation to a hop gene in Glycine max. We explored 53 available plant genomes from Chlorophyta to higher plants, to determine whether the chl-fus gene was transferred directly downstream of the primordial hop in the proto-eukaryote host cell. Since both genes came from exon/module duplication events, we wanted to explore the involvement of introns in the early origin and the ensuing evolutionary changes in gene structure. Results: We reconstructed the evolutionary history of the two convergent plant genes, {{on the basis of their}} gene structure, microsynteny and microcolinearity, from 53 plant nuclear genomes. Despite a high degree (72 %) of microcolinearity among vascular plants, our results demonstrate that their adjacency was a product of chromosomal rearrangements. Based on predicted exon − intron structures, we inferred the molecular events giving rise to the current form of genes. Therefore, we propose a simple model of exon/module shuffling by intronic recombinations in which phase- 0 introns were essential for domain duplication, and a phase- 1 intron for transit peptide recruiting. Finally, we demonstrate a natural susceptibility of the intergenic region to recombine or delete, seriously threatening the integrity of the chl-fus gene for the future. Conclusions: Our results are consistent with the interpretation that the chl-fus gene was transferred from the <b>chloroplast</b> to a <b>chromosome</b> different from that of hop, in the primitive photosynthetic eukaryote, and much later before the appearance of angiosperms, it was recombined downstream of hop. Exon/module shuffling mediated by symmetric intron phases (i. e., phase- 0 introns) was essential for gene evolution. The intergenic region is prone to recombine, risking the integrity of both genes...|$|R
40|$|Maize {{chloroplast}} DNA sequences representing 94 % of the chromosome {{have been}} surveyed for their activity as autonomously replicating sequences in yeast and as templates for DNA synthesis in vitro by a partially purified chloroplast DNA polymerase. A maize chloroplast DNA region extending over about 9 kilobase pairs is especially active as {{a template for}} the DNA synthesis reaction. Fragments from within this region are much more active than DNA from elsewhere in the chromosome and 50 - to 100 -fold more active than DNA of the cloning vector pBR 322. The smallest of the strongly active subfragments that we have studied, the 1368 -base-pair EcoRI fragment x, has been sequenced and found to contain the coding region of chloroplast ribosomal protein L 16.

(1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84, 194 - 198]. Analysis of replicative intermediates indicates that although the template activity of the recombinant plasmid pZmcBam 17 ' is substantially greater than that of the pZmcEco x, replication in both cases originates from within a 455 bp region which overlaps the two plasmids. The remaining approximately 1500 basepair portion of maize chloroplast BamHI fragment 17 ' is not more active because it contains additional origins for replication. The overlapping region shows sequence homology with a portion of the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii <b>chloroplast</b> <b>chromosome</b> that contains a replication origin. Replication is shown to proceed bidirectionally within the 455 bp origin region. Recombinant plasmid pZmc 427, which is also active in the in vitro DNA synthesis assay, promoted localized replication initiation within a 1 kbp Bg 1 II-Eco RI fragment of the chloroplast DNA insert, a region that includes the 3 ' terminal part of the psbA gene...|$|E

The gene was located by hybridization of cloned chloroplast DNA fragments containing the maize LS gene (Bedbrook, J. R., Coen, D. M., Beaton, A. R., Bogorad, L. & Rich, A. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 905 - 910) to spinach chloroplast DNA cleaved with restriction nucleases. The 11. 2 -kbp BamHI fragment has been inserted into the BamHI site of the plasmid pBR 322. The resulting recombinant plasmid, pSoe 3101, was used to direct the synthesis of a protein, which was immunoprecipitable with antibody to RuP 2 carboxylase, in a partially defined in vitro transcription-translation system derived from Escherichia coli. The product synthesized in vitro has a molecular weight identical to that of authentic spinach LS. By using pSoe 3101 DNA cleaved at various positions with restriction nucleases, and the in vitro transcription-translation system, the LS gene has been mapped to a 1. 5 -kbp region located {{at one end of the}} 11. 2 -kbp BamHI fragment. The direction of transcription of the LS gene on the plasmid as well as on the <b>chloroplast</b> <b>chromosome</b> has also been determined.

Science 240, 1534 - 1538), a nonphotosynthetic, acetate-requiring mutant strain of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii with a 2. 5 -kilobase pair deletion in the chloroplast Bam 10 restriction fragment region that removes the 3 ' {{half of the}} atpB gene and a portion of one inverted repeat can be transformed to photosynthetic competency following bombardment with microprojectiles coated with wild-type Bam 10 DNA. We have found that assorted other circular plasmids, single-strand DNA circles, or linear, duplex DNA molecules containing the wild-type atpB gene can also complement the same mutant. DNA gel blot hybridization analysis of all such transformants indicates that the complementing DNA has integrated into the chromosome at the atpB locus and suggests that a copy-correction mechanism operating between the inverted repeats maintains sequence identity in this region. Sequences from the intact inverted repeat may be recruited to restore the incomplete copy when exogenous DNA with {{only a portion of}} the deleted sequence is introduced. Furthermore, a foreign, unselected-for, chimeric gene flanked by chloroplast DNA sequences can be integrated and maintained stably in the <b>chloroplast</b> <b>chromosome.</b> The bacterial neomycin phosphotransferase structural gene fused to the maize chloroplast promoter for the large subunit gene of ribulose- 1, 5 -biphosphate carboxylase (rbcL) has been integrated into the inverted repeat region of the Bam 10 restriction fragment.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Halophytes such as Salicornia europaea {{have evolved}} to exhibit unique {{mechanisms}} controlled by complex networks and regulated by numerous genes and interactions to adapt to habitats with high salinity. However, these mechanisms remain unknown. METHODS: To investigate the mechanism by which halophytes tolerate salt based on changes in the whole transcriptome, we performed transcriptome sequencing and functional annotation by database search. Using the unigene database, we conducted digital gene expression analysis of S. europaea at various time points after these materials were treated with NaCl. We also quantified ion uptakes. Gene functional enrichment analysis was performed to determine the important pathways involved in this process. RESULTS: A total of 57, 151 unigenes with lengths of > 300 bp were assembled, in which 57. 5 % of these unigenes were functionally annotated. Differentially expressed genes indicated that cell wall metabolism and lignin biosynthetic pathways were significantly enriched in S. europaea to promote {{the development of the}} xylem under saline conditions. This result is consistent with the increase in sodium uptake as ions pass through the xylem. Given that PSII efficiency remained unaltered, salt treatment activated the expression of electron transfer-related genes encoded by the <b>chloroplast</b> <b>chromosome.</b> Chlorophyll biosynthesis was also inhibited, indicating the energy-efficient state of the electron transfer system of S. europaea. CONCLUSIONS: The key function of adjusting important primary metabolic pathways in salt adaption was identified by analyzing the changes in the transcriptome of S. europaea. These pathways could involve unique salt tolerance mechanisms in halophytes. This study also provided information as the basis of future investigations on salt response genes in S. europaea.
