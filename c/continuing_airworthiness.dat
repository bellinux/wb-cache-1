The arrangement of the research project is that all students start with a Group Design Project which is based on the Flying Crane Project provided by AVIC. Individual research projects will address some aspects of the Flying Crane Project during the Group Design Project, and then further developed during the period for individual projects. The aim of this research is to apply the airworthiness requirements and the methodology of the Maintenance Steering Group logic (MSG- 3) in the Flying Crane Project. This is because that maintenance {{is one of the key}} factors of <b>Continuing</b> <b>Airworthiness,</b> and MSG- 3 logic is the most accepted and approved method to develop scheduled maintenance for civil aircrafts. The main objectives of this project include: (1) To investigate current <b>Continuing</b> <b>Airworthiness</b> regulations, including European airworthiness requirements (as the main regulation to comply with) and Chinese airworthiness regulations (as an important reference and supplement to the research); (2) To investigate the main analysis methodology of reliability and maintainability, including Damage Tolerance and Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA); (3) To analyse the data resulted from the Group Design Project using MSG- 3 logic to produce a set of <b>Continuing</b> <b>Airworthiness</b> instructions, for the operator and maintenance organisation of the aircraft, from the design organization’s perspective; (4) To develop <b>Continuing</b> <b>Airworthiness</b> instructions for airline operators to compose maintenance programmes for Flying Crane aircrafts, including maintenance tasks and intervals for the selected airframe systems and structural components; and (5) To identify applicable maintenance organisations in China for Flying Crane aircrafts in accordance with both European and Chinese airworthiness requirements.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{a new approach}} to lightning protection components design by incorporating the use of multiple data sources, aircraft environmental threats models and component characteristics to determine if the component design meets the <b>continued</b> <b>airworthiness</b> requirements. This innovative aircraft lightning protection component design methodology examines critical component characteristics and evaluates these characteristics for long term survivability given known environmental design data. Use of in-service data, test data, material sciences and detailed component construction produces predictive results and provides inputs for the design community. A simple case of non-active lightning protection components was used to validate this methodology, concluding that certain design degradation mitigations are necessary to improve the <b>continued</b> <b>airworthiness</b> performance. Following this validation, the methodology was exercised by several case studies using actual design data from a large transport aircraft. The case studies provide for understanding how the methodology can be applied and showed that value was produced in creating design optimizations for the protection components. The case studies also proved that the methodology could be applied to different lightning protection designs spanning from structural design protection components to systems infrastructure transport elements and wiring. For this work, analysis sheets were designed to provide the necessary design assessments to apply the methodology. Finally, the thesis concludes that application of this design methodology worked well for evaluation and optimization of lightning protection components and may work well for other aircraft system components. Future work associated with this study suggests that the methodology could more effectively deployed by use of an integrated computing system with the ability to share data efficiently between key design groups including electrical wiring design, electrical earthing engineering, electrical standards engineering, structural protection engineering and maintenance engineering departments...|$|R
