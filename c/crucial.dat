5|$|Nevertheless, some Han {{literary}} sources provide <b>crucial</b> information. As {{written by}} Yang Xiong in 15 BCE, the belt drive {{was first used}} for a quilling device which wound silk fibers onto the bobbins of weaver shuttles. The invention of the belt drive was a <b>crucial</b> {{first step in the}} development of later technologies during the Song dynasty, such as the chain drive and spinning wheel.|$|E
5|$|A <b>crucial</b> goal against Espanyol and a brace against Sevilla {{helped him}} reach 16 goals that season and {{would see him}} come sixth in La Liga's top scorer list that season (scoring {{the same amount of}} goals as fellow {{international}} Raúl Tamudo) while he created more assists than anyone.|$|E
5|$|All {{species of}} Cucurbita have 20 pairs of chromosomes. Many North and Central American species are visited by {{specialist}} pollinators in the apid tribe Eucerini, especially the genera Peponapis and Xenoglossa, and these squash bees can be <b>crucial</b> to the flowers producing fruit after pollination.|$|E
5|$|Also seen as <b>crucial</b> {{to giving}} the {{upcoming}} reforms their {{moral and political}} support were Ignacy Krasicki's satires of the Great Sejm era.|$|E

5|$|Author Joan B. Huffman is more cautious, {{noting that}} <b>crucial</b> sources are {{unavailable}} since Frances destroyed all Eustace's letters to her. However, Huffman records {{that she did}} support her husband when his sister Alice repeatedly challenged him over his drinking.|$|E
5|$|Bolesław's expansionist {{policies}} were costly to the Polish state {{and were not}} always successful. He lost, for example, the economically <b>crucial</b> Farther Pomerania in 1005 together with its new bishopric in Kołobrzeg; the region had previously been conquered with great effort by Mieszko.|$|E
5|$|During the American Idiot and 21st Century Breakdown eras of the band, the {{influences}} of David Bowie, The Who, Bruce Springsteen and U2 were <b>crucial</b> {{to the sound of}} the albums.|$|E

5|$|Episodic {{memory is}} the ability to {{remember}} the details of specific events. This sort of memory can last for a lifetime. Much evidence implicates the hippocampus in playing a <b>crucial</b> role: people with severe damage to the hippocampus sometimes show amnesia, that is, inability to form new long-lasting episodic memories.|$|E
5|$|In 2014–15 season {{she played}} for the Greek champions Olympiacos in the European competitions, winning the LEN Euroleague. She was {{instrumental}} in Olympiacos' triumph, scoring 4 <b>crucial</b> goals in the 10–9 win against Sabadell in the Euroleague final.|$|E
5|$|In 694, Abd al-Malik {{appointed}} the trusted and capable al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf {{as the new}} governor of Iraq, a <b>crucial</b> post given the restiveness of the region towards Umayyad rule. In 697, his remit was expanded to cover {{the entirety of the}} eastern Caliphate, including Khurasan and Sistan.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of {{molecular}} studies, the preservation of a specimen that can vouch {{for the source of}} the tissue sample used to gather genetic data has been recommended, as genetic analysis often yields surprising results that make reexamination of the original specimen <b>crucial.</b>|$|E
5|$|Indian naval crews earlier {{trained to}} operate the {{submarine}} near St Petersburg and another group of sailors was expected to arrive in Vladivostok in late 2008 for sea trials. The training of the crew was viewed as <b>crucial</b> to India's own nuclear submarine programme, known as the Arihant class submarine.|$|E
5|$|Japan {{had a new}} codebook, but its {{introduction}} had been delayed, enabling HYPO to read messages for several <b>crucial</b> days. The new code, which would take several days to be cracked, came into use on 24 May, but the important breaks had already been made.|$|E
5|$|Johnson offered Wollstonecraft {{work as a}} translator, {{prompting}} her {{to learn}} French and German. More importantly, Johnson provided encouragement at <b>crucial</b> moments during the writing of her seminal political treatises A Vindication of the Rights of Men (1790) and A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792).|$|E
5|$|Macbeth {{appears as}} a {{character}} in the television series Gargoyles with the Gargoyle Demona playing a <b>crucial</b> role in both his rise and fall as King of Scotland. He was voiced by John Rhys-Davies.|$|E
5|$|Martin {{made his}} {{eleventh}} {{appearance at the}} Brier playing for Alberta, after defeating Kevin Koe in {{the final of the}} provincials. He went through the round robin with a 9–2 win-loss record, and had some trouble during the round robin after losing <b>crucial</b> games to Manitoba and Newfoundland/Labrador in less than 10 ends. After a close win over Glenn Howard in the round robin, Martin dropped a 4–5 decision to Howard after he missed a <b>crucial</b> shot in the 3 vs. 4 game of the playoffs, and he lost the bronze medal game to Brad Gushue 10–5, playing without second Marc Kennedy, because Kennedy and his wife were expecting a child. Martin finished the 2010–11 season by winning his record 7th Players' Championship.|$|E
5|$|Mdina was not {{attacked}} directly {{during the}} Great Siege of Malta, but it nonetheless played a <b>crucial</b> {{role in the}} siege. Ottoman general Lala Mustafa Pasha wanted {{to take over the}} poorly-defended city first, but was overruled by Piali Pasha who wanted to attack Fort Saint Elmo. The fort was taken over after a month of heavy fighting, but the Ottomans had lost <b>crucial</b> time in doing so. On 7 August 1565, the Order's cavalry in Mdina attacked the unprotected Ottoman field hospital, which led in the invaders abandoning a major assault on the main fortifications in Birgu and Senglea. The Ottomans tried to take over the city in September so as to winter there, but abandoned their plans when Mdina fired its cannon, leading them to believe that the city had ammunition to spare.|$|E
5|$|One of the court's most <b>crucial</b> {{decisions}} during Owsley's tenure was in {{the case}} of Commonwealth of Kentucky v. James Morrison, which held that the Bank of the United States did {{not have the right to}} establish branches in Kentucky. The Supreme Court of the United States later overturned this ruling.|$|E
5|$|Place: A {{distribution}} logistics is of <b>crucial</b> importance; {{main focus}} is on ecological packaging. Marketing local and seasonal products e.g. vegetables from regional farms is more easy to be marketed “green” than products imported.|$|E
5|$|Public {{attitudes and}} {{the actions of}} key {{stakeholders}} can play a <b>crucial</b> role in realising the potential of sustainable biofuels. Informed discussion and dialogue, based both on scientific research {{and an understanding of}} public and stakeholder views, is important.|$|E
5|$|Researchers {{recently}} discovered archaeal involvement in ammonia oxidation reactions. These reactions {{are particularly important}} in the oceans. The archaea also appear <b>crucial</b> for ammonia oxidation in soils. They produce nitrite, which other microbes then oxidize to nitrate. Plants and other organisms consume the latter.|$|E
5|$|Sea {{transport}} is <b>crucial</b> and {{a variety}} of ferry services operate to mainland Scotland and between the islands. The Gaelic language remains strong in some areas; the landscapes have inspired a variety of artists; and there is a diversity of wildlife.|$|E
5|$|The 6th Massachusetts {{remained}} in Washington until May 5, {{when they were}} assigned to garrison a key railroad relay station about 15 miles outside of Baltimore at Elkridge. Their presence there helped keep open the <b>crucial</b> rail line from the northeastern states to Washington.|$|E
5|$|The Agaonidae (fig wasps) are {{the only}} pollinators of nearly 1000 species of figs, and thus are <b>crucial</b> to the {{survival}} of their host plants. Since the wasps are equally dependent on their fig trees for survival, the coevolved relationship is fully mutualistic.|$|E
5|$|The British wartime {{participation}} was <b>crucial</b> {{to the success}} of the United Kingdom's independent nuclear weapons program after the war when the McMahon Act of 1946 temporarily ended American nuclear cooperation.|$|E
5|$|The Fall {{also had}} many {{implications}} in Europe: {{the influx of}} Greek science and culture into Europe by those escaping the Ottomans was a <b>crucial</b> factor in catalyzing the European Renaissance.|$|E
5|$|The Trans-Mongolian line, {{connecting}} Ulan-Ude on the Trans-Siberian with China's Erenhot via the Mongolian capital Ulaanbaatar, both {{serves as}} a <b>crucial</b> link {{to the outside world}} for landlocked Mongolia, and the shortest connection between the Trans-Siberian Railway and Beijing. This line's capacity, however, is limited by its being single-track.|$|E
5|$|The {{armament}} of the {{new breed}} of ships was not their only <b>crucial</b> advantage. Dreadnought used steam turbines for propulsion, giving her a top speed of 21 knots, against the 18 knots typical of the pre-dreadnought battleships. Able both to outgun and outmaneuver their opponents, the dreadnought battleships decisively outclassed earlier battleship designs.|$|E
5|$|The chipset {{and drivers}} used to {{implement}} USB and FireWire have a <b>crucial</b> {{impact on how}} much of the bandwidth prescribed by the specification is achieved in the real world, along with compatibility with peripherals.|$|E
5|$|The {{derivation}} {{outlined in}} the previous section contains all the information needed to define general relativity, describe its key properties, and address a question of <b>crucial</b> importance in physics, namely how the theory can be used for model-building.|$|E
5|$|The {{heart is}} the first {{functional}} organ to develop and starts to beat and pump blood at about three weeks into embryogenesis. This early start is <b>crucial</b> for subsequent embryonic and prenatal development.|$|E
5|$|The {{second half}} had fewer incidents. Schwarzer saved a header from Nolan, while Juninho had two {{opportunities}} for Middlesbrough. In the final few minutes, Thome made a <b>crucial</b> block against Mendieta, {{and at the}} other side of the pitch Ugo Ehiogu did the same to thwart Stelios.|$|E
5|$|This <b>crucial</b> {{matter was}} also {{emphasised}} by Beck and defined in very clearly expressed terms {{on the website}} of the artist, Peter Layne Arguimbau.|$|E
