50|$|Ajonpää and Kallanpää {{were bought}} from Denmark during the Continuation War and were {{intended}} for clearing <b>influence</b> <b>mines.</b> Both ships survived the wars, Ajonpää was retired 1960 and Kallanpää on 1962.|$|R
50|$|Modern <b>influence</b> <b>mines</b> are {{designed}} to discriminate against false inputs and are therefore much harder to sweep. They often contain inherent anti-sweeping mechanisms. For example, they may be programmed {{to respond to the}} unique noise of a particular ship-type, its associated magnetic signature and the typical pressure displacement of such a vessel. As a result, a mine-sweeper must accurately guess and mimic the required target signature in order to trigger detonation. The task is {{complicated by the fact that}} an <b>influence</b> <b>mine</b> may have one or more of a hundred different potential target signatures programmed into it.|$|R
50|$|When <b>influence</b> <b>mines</b> {{are laid}} in an ocean minefield, {{they may have}} various {{combinations}} of fuze settings configured. For example, some mines (with the acoustic sensor enabled) may become active within three hours of being laid, others (with the acoustic and magnetic sensors enabled) may become active after two weeks but have the ship-counter mechanism set to ignore the first two trigger events, and still others in the same minefield (with the magnetic and pressure sensors enabled) may not become armed until three weeks have passed. Groups of mines within this mine-field may have different target signatures {{which may or may}} not overlap. The fuzes on <b>influence</b> <b>mines</b> allow many different permutations, which complicates the clearance process.|$|R
50|$|The band’s <b>influences</b> <b>mined</b> {{a richly}} varied canvas: The Beatles, Jethro Tull, Roland Kirk and John Coltrane (J.D. Hughes), Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix and The Beatles (Norman Barratt), and The Beatles again (Les). For Barry Davenport it was jazz drummers Art Blakey, Buddy Rich and Joe Morello.|$|R
50|$|In 1941, Sands {{went to the}} Naval Ordnance Laboratory in Washington, D.C., {{where he}} learned more about {{electronics}} under Joseph F. Keithley. Keithly and Sands developed two <b>influence</b> <b>mines,</b> from which three patents were derived. They performed sea tests of a working prototype, but the program was stopped for unknown reasons.|$|R

The ship is also protected from magnetic <b>influence</b> <b>mines</b> with an active system to compensate for the magnetic fields generated by the ship and transported materials. The central command post and MS-227 device compartments are strengthened with alloy armor.|$|R
40|$|Surface {{coal mining}} may {{disrupts}} the carrying capacity of water, hence {{the sustainability of}} water resources during mining operations and post-mining depends on environmental services of mining void. This research was designed to study the environmental {{costs and benefits of}} mining void water (general term of pit lake in Indonesia) in PT. Adaro Indonesia on site Tanjung, Kabupaten Tabalong, South Borneo, Indonesia to understand the factors <b>influencing</b> <b>mining</b> sustainability through utilization of mining void or mining pit, and to develop a model for water resources sustainability in coal mining. The main factor <b>influencing</b> <b>mining</b> sustainability is the void water quality. pH is the key factor which determines how mining void water may be used. Water utilization is based on the demands of the surrounding community, and includes drinking water, fish farming, and land farming. Calculations on the environmental services provided by mining void water for tourism, drinking water supply, and fish farming in PT. Adaro Indonesia shows an Extended NPV of Rp 7. 124. 884. 062. 739. 430 (± USD 593, 740, 338, 561. 62) and B/C ratio of 8, 25...|$|R
50|$|Another anti-sweeping {{mechanism}} is a ship-counter {{in the mine}} fuze. When enabled, this allows detonation only after the mine fuze has been triggered a pre-set number of times. To further complicate matters, <b>influence</b> <b>mines</b> may be programmed to arm themselves (or disarm automatically—known as self-sterilization) after a pre-set time. During the pre-set arming delay (which could last days or even weeks) the mine would remain dormant and ignore any target stimulus, whether genuine or faked.|$|R
50|$|On 23 August 1966 {{the ship}} was {{transferred}} to the United States Navy to be converted into a Minesweeper, Special by American Shipbuilding of Lorraine, Ohio. The ship's hull was completely gutted and a shock-hardened pilot house was fitted. Intended to sweep <b>influence</b> <b>mines</b> by detonating them with pressure wave or magnetic signature generated by her hull. In late summer of 1969, the ship underwent extensive shock testing off Key West, Florida.|$|R

50|$|The {{mines in}} SPMB {{are stored in}} {{palletized}} containers housed inside the vehicle. A burying mechanism is installed at {{the stern of the}} vehicle. The commander can select the type of mine from a panel and it moves on a conveyor belt. An arming device arms the mines before it is buried in the ground. The system carry around 480 mines and can bury 240 mines in an hour.The SPMB can lay four types of anti-tank mines such as ND MK-1, Indian magnetic <b>influence</b> <b>mine</b> Adrushy mine MK-I, Adrushy mine-II and French electrically fuzed HPD F2. The prototype of the system has been developed and as of 2009 it was in trials.|$|R
50|$|As {{part of the}} LCS Mine Countermeasure (MCM) mission package, {{the boats}} will act as the Unmanned Influence Sweep System (UISS) (formerly {{unmanned}} surface sweep system (USSS)), where they will tow a countermeasure system that emits acoustic and magnetic signals to trigger and detonate <b>influence</b> <b>mines</b> at a safe distance. It is also capable of carrying other counter-mine payloads, including a side scan sonar and minehunting and sweeping unmanned underwater vehicles, as well as non-lethal weapons and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) packages.|$|R
50|$|Increment three {{will involve}} adding the Fleet-class {{unmanned}} surface vessel (USV) with the unmanned surface sweep system (USSS), a cable towed behind the boat. Each LCS will carry two, {{and they will}} be used for both MCM and ASW. It will mimic the acoustic and magnetic signature of a ship to fool magnetic and <b>influence</b> <b>mines</b> into detonating; introduction is expected in 2017. The final increment will be the Knifefish unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) to find and detect buried mines in 2019.|$|R
50|$|On 2 April 1982, Argentina {{invaded the}} Falkland Islands. Intelligence from a {{submarine}} reported the laying of a defensive minefield off the approaches to Port Stanley (the {{capital of the}} islands). Great Britain had supplied Argentina with modern <b>influence</b> <b>mines,</b> both <b>combination</b> magnetic and pressure activated, and had recently actually serviced them for the Argentinian Navy. The Royal Navy's mine warfare capacity was purely coastal with 425 LT s {{with a range of}} around , totally unsuitable for either the distance or the conditions.|$|R

50|$|The Mk 67 {{submarine}} launched {{mobile mine}} {{is based on}} a Mark 37 torpedo body. It entered service in 1983 and is capable of swimming as far as 10 miles through or into a channel, harbor, shallow water area and other zones which would normally be inaccessible to the vessel laying it. After reaching the target area it sinks to the sea bed and acts like a conventionally laid <b>influence</b> <b>mine.</b> The exploder in the Mk 67 warhead is computerised and incorporates magnetic, acoustic and pressure sensors.|$|R
50|$|The Stonefish <b>influence</b> <b>mine</b> is {{manufactured}} by a British company (BAE Systems). Originally, the weapon was supplied to the Royal Navy, {{but it has}} also been exported to friendly countries such as Australia, which has both warstock and training versions of Stonefish. There has been conjecture that South Africa, Chile, Iraq, Libya and possibly other countries may have gained access to either some early Stonefish information or to similar technology. The mine is named after the stonefish, a venomous fish of the same name.|$|R
5000|$|Naval mines were {{deployed}} {{in hundreds of}} thousands, or far greater numbers than in previous wars. Submarines proved surprisingly effective for this purpose. <b>Influence</b> <b>mines</b> were a new development but moored contact mines were the most numerous. They resembled those of the late 19th century, improved so they less often exploded while being laid. The Allies produced enough mines to build the North Sea Mine Barrage to help bottle the Germans into the North Sea, {{but it was too}} late to make much difference.|$|R

50|$|Modern <b>influence</b> <b>mines</b> {{such as the}} BAE Stonefish are computerised, {{with all}} the {{programmability}} that this implies e.g. the ability to quickly load new acoustic signatures into fuzes, or program them to detect a single, highly distinctive target signature. In this way, a mine with a passive acoustic fuze can be programmed to ignore all friendly vessels and small enemy vessels, only detonating when a very large enemy target passes over it. Alternatively, the mine can be programmed specifically to ignore all surface vessels regardless of size and exclusively target submarines.|$|R

Nor did their magnetic detonators work well against the wooden hulls of Soviet barges and patrol boats. The secondary armament of the MTBs also proved too light to seriously threaten Soviet gunboats. German mineboats {{turned out to have}} extremely unreliable engines, keeping them docked in port far longer than they spent on actual operations nor were their <b>influence</b> <b>mines</b> especially useful against mainly wooden hulled Soviet vessels.|$|R
