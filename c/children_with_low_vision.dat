5000|$|<b>Children</b> <b>with</b> <b>low</b> <b>vision</b> {{sometimes}} have reading delays, but do benefit from phonics-based beginning reading instruction methods. Engaging phonics instruction is multisensory, highly motivating, and hands-on. Typically students are first taught {{the most frequent}} sounds of the alphabet letters, especially the so-called short vowel sounds, then taught to blend sounds together with three-letter consonant-vowel-consonant words such as cat, red, sit, hot, sun. Hands-on (or kinesthetically appealing) VERY enlarged print materials such as those found in [...] "The Big Collection of Phonics Flipbooks" [...] by Lynn Gordon (Scholastic, 2010) are helpful for teaching word families and blending skills to beginning readers with low vision. Beginning reading instructional materials should focus primarily on the lower-case letters, not the capital letters (even though they are larger) because reading text requires familiarity (mostly) with lower-case letters. Phonics-based beginning reading should also be supplemented with phonemic awareness lessons, writing opportunities, and lots of read-alouds (literature read to children daily) to stimulate motivation, vocabulary development, concept development, and comprehension skill development. Many <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>low</b> <b>vision</b> can be successfully included in regular education environments. Parents {{may need to be}} vigilant to ensure that the school provides the teacher and students with appropriate low vision resources, for example technology in the classroom, classroom aide time, modified educational materials, and consultation assistance with low vision experts.|$|E
40|$|The main {{question}} of the studies reported in this thesis is how the reading and spelling skills of <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>low</b> <b>vision</b> compare to those of their sighted peers, and which factors determine the variation in reading and spelling ability in <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>low</b> <b>vision.</b> In the study reported in chapter 2, the reading comprehension, decoding and spelling skills of 404 <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>low</b> <b>vision</b> were compared with a norm sample of sighted children. It {{was found that the}} <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>low</b> <b>vision</b> with no additional disabilities, performed less well than the sighted children only on decoding, whereas those with additional disabilities performed less well on all three tests. In chapter 3, it was investigated whether the difficulties with decoding of <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>low</b> <b>vision</b> are a matter of reduced visual input or also a consequence of a lack of orthographic knowledge because of less reading experience. The results indicated that reduced visual input is the only cause of these children's lower reading performance. In chapter 4, text reading was studied. It was found that despite their lower reading speed on reading comprehension task the <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>low</b> <b>vision</b> comprehended texts at least as well as did the sighted children. <b>Children</b> <b>with</b> <b>low</b> <b>vision</b> need more time to read and comprehend a text, but see m to use this time with enough efficiency to process the semantic, as well as the syntactic information. In the final chapter, two aspects of word decoding were investigated in two word naming experiments: the identification of the constituent letters of a word, and the processing of letter order information. <b>Children</b> <b>with</b> <b>low</b> <b>vision</b> were compared with sighted children. Both experiments showed qualitative differences between <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>low</b> <b>vision</b> and sighted children...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: While {{educators}} and optometrists {{are concerned with}} reading efficiency in <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>low</b> <b>vision,</b> in most low vision assessments, children’s reading performance is assessed only by a brief evaluation of reading fluency. We examined the relationships between clinical vision measures and reading performance in <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>low</b> <b>vision.</b> Methods: Subjects were 71 students with low vision, aged seven to 18 years. The vision and reading performance measures were: high contrast distance visual acuity, contrast sensitivity using both the Pelli-Robson and LH symbol charts, near text visual acuity and reading rates {{on a range of}} print sizes. Results: Most children achieved maximum reading rate at print sizes between 2. 5 and seven times larger than threshold print size. Maximum reading rate increased significantly with age and near visual acuity. There was no significant relationship between reading rate and contrast sensitivity. Conclusions: The majority of <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>low</b> <b>vision</b> can achieve near normal reading rates with magnification. Age is the strongest predictor of reading rate in <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>low</b> <b>vision.</b> They need print sizes well above threshold to achieve maximum reading rate. Routine contrast sensitivity testing to visually impaired students is not indicated for reading assessments...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT We {{conducted}} a literature review of tools {{used to evaluate}} functionality in <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>low</b> <b>vision</b> {{with the aim of}} analyzing the applicability, advantages, and disadvantages for children < 6 years of age, an age at which visual development is mostly complete. Publications in Portuguese, English and, Spanish describing functional evaluation tools for children aged 0 - 18 years with low vision in the following databases were included: Web of Science, Virtual Health Library, Cochrane, Scielo, and PubMed. A total of 181 articles were collected, 15 of which were included in this review. Thirteen tools were identified, nine of which evaluated overall functionality and quality of life through questionnaires. The other 4 instruments, using a observational test model, evaluated functionality and they were elected. Observational tests chosen for their accuracy and lower selection bias were used to evaluate visual functionality. Of these, the Functional Vision Assessment up to 6 years seems to be promising.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if teachers of low vision children with concomitant disabilities were influenced by the results of two kinds of functional vision assessments, isolated and contextual. Teachers wrote 72 activities to teach vision use, which were classified by the raters as isolated or contextual and judged by the experts as appropriate or inappropriate for instruction. Six teachers selected were certified to teach <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>low</b> <b>vision,</b> six were certified to teach children in another area of special education. The investigator and two raters reached a 79 % level of agreement for classification of the activities as isolated or contextual. Three of four experts reached a 68 % level of agreement for judgments of appropriate and inappropriate for teacher activities. The judgments of appropriate activities were analyzed to determine if school setting, teacher preference for one kind of assessment, teacher preparation for instructing <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>low</b> <b>vision,</b> teacher preparation for using functional vision assessments and years of teaching experience significantly influenced the judgments of appropriateness for activities written by teachers. Results of the study indicated that teachers with and without certification in vision were rated as writing more isolated than contextual activities regardless of the kind of assessment instrument used. Teachers certified in vision received about the same number of judgments of appropriate for activities written as the result of both assessments. Teachers not certified in vision received more judgments of appropriate for activities written from contextual assessment results.

40|$|Purpose: Cortical visual {{impairment}} (CVI) {{is the most}} common cause of bilateral vision impairment in children in Western countries. Better quantitative tools for measuring vision are needed to assess these children, to allow measurement of their visual deficit, and to monitor their response to treatment and rehabilitation. The author performed a series of experiments to assess the use of the sweep visual evoked potential (VEP) as a quantitative tool for measuring vision in CVI. Methods: The first experiment was a reliability measure (test/retest) of VEP grating acuity thresholds of 23 <b>children</b> <b>with</b> CVI. To validate the VEP procedure, VEP grating acuity was compared to a clinical measure of vision, the Huo scale, and to a psychophysical measure of vision, the Teller Acuity Card procedure. Finally, the sweep VEP was tested as a tool for defining optimal luminance conditions for grating acuity in 13 <b>children</b> <b>with</b> CVI, by measuring grating thresholds under 2 different luminance conditions: 50 and 100 candela per square meter (cd/m 2). Results: Retest thresholds were similar to original thresholds (r 2 = 0. 662; P =. 003, 1 -tailed t test). Grating VEP meas-ures correlate significantly with the clinical index (r 2 = 0. 63; P =. 00004). Teller acuity measurements are also similar to VEP measures in children (r 2 = 0. 64; P =. 0005) but show lower acuities compared to the VEP for <b>children</b> <b>with</b> particu-larly <b>low</b> <b>vision.</b> Finally, 3 of 13 children tested under 2 background luminance conditions showed paradoxical improve-ment in grating threshold with dimmer luminance. Conclusions: The sweep VEP tool is a reliable and valid means for measuring grating acuity in <b>children</b> <b>with</b> CVI. The tool also shows promise as a means of determining the optimal visual environment for <b>children</b> <b>with</b> CVI. Tr Am Ophth Soc 2001; 99 : 253 - 26...|$|R
40|$|Background : Since 1996, vision {{screening}} {{of three to}} six-year-old children is conducted every year in Iran. We present outcomes of project review held in August 2006. Materials and Methods : Kindergarten teachers examined vision by using Snellen&#x 2032;s illiterate &#x 2032;E&#x 2032; chart. They used torchlight to detect strabismus. On a repeat test, if either eye had vision < 20 / 30, the child was referred to the optometrist. A pediatric ophthalmologist examined and managed <b>children</b> <b>with</b> strabismus or amblyopia. Provincial managers supervised the screening program. The evaluator team assessed the coverage, yield, quality and feasibility, and cost-effectiveness of vision screening, as well as magnitude of amblyopia, and its risk factors. Result : In 2005, 1. 4 million (67 &#x 0025;) children were examined in all provinces of Iran. Opticians examined 90, 319 (61 &#x 0025;) <b>children</b> <b>with</b> defective vision that were referred to them. The prevalence of uncorrected refractive error, strabismus and amblyopia was 3. 82 &#x 0025; (95 &#x 0025; CI 3. 79 - 3. 85), 0. 39 &#x 0025; (95 &#x 0025; CI 0. 38 - 0. 40) and 1. 25 &#x 0025; (95 &#x 0025; CI 1. 24 - 1. 26) respectively. Validity test of 7, 768 children had a sensitivity of 74. 5 &#x 0025; (95 &#x 0025; CI 72. 7 - 76. 3) and specificity of 97. 2 &#x 0025; (95 &#x 0025; CI 96. 7 - 97. 7).

Birth of a disabled <b>child</b> <b>with</b> mental or physical disability (especially deaf or blind children), impose an enormous load of stress on their parents especially the mothers. This study compared stress levels of mothers <b>with</b> hearing impaired <b>children</b> and mothers of normal <b>children</b> or <b>with</b> other disabilities. Methods: In this study, cluster random sampling was performed in Karaj city. 120 mothers in four groups of having a <b>child</b> <b>with</b> mental retardation, <b>low</b> <b>vision,</b> hearing impairment and <b>with</b> normal <b>children</b> were included.

40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} {{the causes of}} childhood blindness and severe visual impairment in pupils attending schools for the blind in Burundi in order to assist planning for services in the country. Materials and Methods: All pupils attending three schools for the blind in Burundi were examined. A modified WHO/PBL eye examination record form for <b>children</b> <b>with</b> blindness and <b>low</b> <b>vision</b> was used to record the findings. Data was analyzed for those who became blind or severely visually impaired {{before the age of}} 16 years. Results: Overall, 117 pupils who became visually impaired before 16 years of age were examined. Of these, 109 (93. 2 %) were blind or severely visually impaired. The major anatomical cause of blindness or severe visual impairment was cornea pathology/phthisis (23. 9 %), followed by lens pathology (18. 3 %), uveal lesions (14. 7 %) and optic nerve lesions (11. 9 %). In the majority of pupils with blindness or severe visual impairment, the underlying etiology of visual loss was unknown (74. 3 %). More than half of the pupils with lens related blindness had not had surgery; among those who had surgery, outcomes were generally poor. Conclusion: The causes identified indicate the importance of continuing preventive public health strategies, as well as the development of specialist pediatric ophthalmic services in the management of childhood blindness in Burundi. The geographic distribution of pupils at the schools for the blind indicates a need for community-based programs to identify and refer children in need of services...|$|R
40|$|AIMS—To {{describe}} {{the causes of}} severe visual impairment and blindness in children in schools for the visually handicapped in the Czech Republic in 1998.  METHODS—Pupils attending all 10  primary schools for the visually handicapped were examined. A modified WHO/PBL eye examination record for <b>children</b> <b>with</b> blindness and <b>low</b> <b>vision</b> was used.  RESULTS— 229 children (146  males and 83  females) aged 6 - 15 years {{were included in the}} study: 47  children had severe visual impairment (20. 5 %) (visual acuity in their better eye less than 6 / 60), and 159  were blind (69. 5 %) (visual acuity in their better eye less than 3 / 60). Anatomically, the most affected parts of the eye were the retina (124,  54. 2 %), optic nerve (35,  15. 3 %), whole globe (25,  10. 9 %), lens (20,  8. 7 %), and uvea (12,  5. 2 %). Aetiologically (timing of insult leading to visual loss), the major cause of visual impairment was retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) (96,  41. 9  %), followed by abnormalities of unknown timing of insult (97,  42. 4 %), and hereditary disease (21,  9. 2 %). In 90  children (40 %), additional disabilities were present: mental disability (36,  16 %), physical handicap (16,  7 %), and/or a combination of both (19,  8 %). It was estimated that 127  children (56 %) suffer from visual impairment caused by potentially preventable and/or treatable conditions (for example, ROP, cataract, glaucoma).  CONCLUSIONS—Establishing a study group for comprehensive evaluation of causes of visual handicap in children in the Czech Republic, as well as for detailed analysis of present practice of screening for ROP was recommended. ...|$|R
40|$|AIMS—To {{determine}} the anatomical site and {{underlying causes of}} blindness and severe visual impairment in children under 16  years of age in special education in the People's Republic of China {{with a view to}} determining potentially preventable and treatable causes.  METHODS—A national study of children attending schools for the blind in China was conducted between April and June 1998  using the WHO Prevention of Blindness Programme (WHO/PBL) eye examination record for <b>children</b> <b>with</b> blindness and <b>low</b> <b>vision.</b> Eight Chinese ophthalmologists attended a training workshop before conducting the study. 36  blind schools in 18  provinces of China were included.  RESULTS— 1245 children aged between 5  and 15  years were examined, of whom 1131  (91 %) were blind or severely visually impaired (visual acuity less than 6 / 60 in the better eye). The commonest anatomical sites of visual loss were whole globe (mainly microphthalmos) 25. 5 % and retina (mainly dystrophies) 24. 9 %. Lens was the major site in 18. 8 %, optic nerve in 13. 6 %, and glaucoma in 9 %. Corneal scarring was not a major cause of visual loss. The aetiology was unknown in 52. 9 %, hereditary factors were responsible in 30. 7 %, and childhood causes in 14 %. 15 % of cases were considered potentially preventable and 22. 5 % potentially treatable.  CONCLUSION—The pattern of childhood blindness seen in this study is likely to reflect the improved health and socioeconomic status of China but may partly reflect bias in admission to, and location of, blind schools, with higher socioeconomic groups overrepresented. Nutritional and infective causes of blindness are uncommon, and hereditary and unknown factors are now the predominant causes. ...|$|R

It is necessary to attract approximately 5, 000 new teachers to the field to meet the needs of the ever-increasing population of students with visual impairments requiring specialized training. This study investigated the personality and background experiences of individuals who are attracted to work as educators with students with visual impairments. A sample of 132 teachers who had been trained at either the undergraduate or graduate level and were employed within their first five years as teachers with this specialization completed the Holland Self-Directed Search (Form CP) and a Participant Profile form to ascertain the personality types and experiences of those new to the field. The study considered three variables: (1) gender, (2) race/ethnicity, (3) teacher training level and their association with Holland personality type (RIASEC). All three variables were weak predictors of the personality type of teachers of the visually impaired as indicated by Goodman and Kruskal's tau. Results of the Holland Self-Directed Search was a stronger measure of the personality type associated with becoming a teacher of students with visual impairments.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the {{academic}} experiences of learners <b>with</b> <b>low</b> <b>vision</b> in integrated schools. Based on the findings from the study, recommendations were forwarded to the integrated primary school principal and teachers who are responsible for the support of learners <b>with</b> <b>low</b> <b>vision.</b> Ethical measures were adhered to as participants were told that their interview was voluntary and they were free to withdraw at any time if they felt uncomfortable. The researcher also kept strict confidentiality to protect identity of the participants. The participants in this research work were seven learners <b>with</b> <b>low</b> <b>vision,</b> one principal and three teachers in one of the integrated primary schools. In this study the researcher used qualitative methodology with purposive sampling technique to select respondents and used descriptive design. It was found that in most cases the attitude of teachers and sighted learners towards learners <b>with</b> <b>low</b> <b>vision</b> was negative, social isolation and withdrawal of learners <b>with</b> <b>low</b> <b>vision</b> from sighted group were the main problems. During this research process respondents reported that there was lack of learning resource materials and modification of teaching materials to suit the needs of learners <b>with</b> <b>low</b> <b>vision.</b> Therefore, the study recommends that learners <b>with</b> <b>low</b> <b>vision</b> should be included not only physically, but socially and psychologically. The teachers in the integrated schools should have a close relationship with these learners, give them support and the curriculum as well learning material or resources should be adapted to suit the need of the learners <b>with</b> <b>low</b> <b>vision.</b> The regular inclusive schools should know the importance of early acceptance and benefits of early identification and intervention to encourage social development of learners <b>with</b> <b>low</b> <b>vision.</b> Inclusive EducationM.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this work}} was to {{evaluate}} the role of low vision aids in improving visual performance and response in <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>low</b> <b>vision.</b> Study Design: Prospective clinical case series. Materials and Methods: This study was conducted on 50 patients that met the international criteria for a diagnosis of low vision. Their ages ranged from 5 to 15 years. Assessment of low vision included distance and near visual acuity assessment, color vision and contrast sensitivity function. Low vision aids were prescribed based on initial evaluation and the patient&#x 2032;s visual needs. Patients were followed up for 1 year using the tests done at the initial examination and a visual function assessment questionnaire. Results: The duration of visual impairment ranged from 1 to 10 years, with mean duration &#x 00 B 1; SD being 4. 6 &#x 00 B 1; 2. 3299. The near visual acuities ranged from A 10 to A 20, with mean near acuity &#x 00 B 1; SD being A 13. 632 &#x 00 B 1; 3. 17171. Far visual acuities ranged from 6 / 60 (0. 06) to 6 / 24 (0. 25), with mean far visual acuity &#x 00 B 1; SD being 0. 122 &#x 00 B 1; 0. 1191. All patients had impaired contrast sensitivity function as tested using the vision contrast testing system (VCTS) chart for all spatial frequencies. Distance and near vision aids were prescribed according to the visual acuity and the visual needs of every patient. All patients in the age group 5 - 7 years could be integrated in mainstream schools. The remaining patients that were already integrated in schools demonstrated greater independency regarding reading books and copying from blackboards. Conclusion: Our study confirmed that low vision aids could play an effective role in minimizing the impact of low vision and improving the visual performance of <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>low</b> <b>vision,</b> leading to maximizing their social and educational integration...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} language samples from 12 children, including 4 blind, 4 sighted, and 4 <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>low</b> <b>vision.</b> The samples were generated as the children examined a set of household objects and talked about them with the investi-gator. Analysis of the samples focused on four areas: syntactic structures, pronoun usage, sentence types, and topic/content. With respect to syntactic structures, the mean length of utterance (ML U) and number of syntactic incongruities were examined. These in-dicated slightly greater complexity of utterances by the sighted group as compared to both visually impaired groups. Blind and low vision children also demonstrated a higher frequency of inappropriate pronoun use than the sighted group. Visually im-paired students also used less variation in sentence types, employing a high frequency of repetitive forms, including questions. Finally, there were fewer instances of experiential narrative and imaginative play in the samples obtained from the visually impaired children. The samples suggested that a greater variation {{in the level of}} language matu-rity existed in the samples from these children. Related literature suggests that the al-tered environment of the visually impaired child may influence this outcome...|$|E
40|$|The study {{sought to}} examine the {{inclusion}} of {{children with visual impairments}} within regular school settings from a Zimbabwean perspective. The population of the study included teachers and children with visual impairments, as well as blind and <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>low</b> <b>vision</b> included in the regular primary and secondary schools. A qualitative survey design was employed in which 30 teachers and 40 pupils were interviewed to solicit their views and observations on the progress made in including children with visual impairments in the mainstream. The study concluded that inclusion was not successful due to lack of material and human resources. Classroom teachers in the regular classes lacked training in handling children with visual impairments. The learning needs of children who were blind and those with low vision were not met, hence, these children failed to participate in sport and other school activities. Assistive devices to support inclusion of both blind children and those with low vision were inadequate. Items that broke down could not be repaired owing to lack of repair kits. Inclusive model institutions should be established to promote inclusive education. Repair kits and laboratories should be available to service inclusion units. Equipment and assistive devices for use by children with visual impairments should be stored in abundance and provided whenever they are needed...|$|E

40|$|Freedom of {{movement}} is something many persons <b>with</b> <b>low</b> <b>vision</b> cannot take for granted. When vision impairment occurs, {{the ability to}} walk around independently {{may be one of}} the areas most seriously affected. This national study explored the mobility problems experienced by persons <b>with</b> <b>low</b> <b>vision,</b> through an investigation of their perceptions as well as the perceptions of mobility practitioners. ^ The study examined various mobility situations and effects of different lighting conditions on the difficulty of those situations, as perceived by mobility practitioners and persons <b>with</b> <b>low</b> <b>vision.</b> In addition, relationships between their reported perceptions were explored. Both groups were asked to list and rank the most critical mobility problems experienced by persons <b>with</b> <b>low</b> <b>vision,</b> as well as to rank the difficulty level of a variety of pre-selected mobility situations. ^ A literature review of the fields of Orientation and Mobility and <b>Low</b> <b>Vision</b> was provided, <b>with</b> a parallel look at what lessons could be drawn from the philosophy of science, particularly post-modern science, as it relates to the emerging area of <b>low</b> <b>vision</b> mobility research. Implications for current and future research practice were discussed. ^ Literature review and expert opinion was solicited to formulate the content for two national surveys (1 open-ended and 1 forced-choice) which were administered to mobility practitioners and persons <b>with</b> <b>low</b> <b>vision.</b> Persons <b>with</b> <b>low</b> <b>vision</b> were asked to answer the surveys with only themselves and their specific mobility problems in mind. ^ Mobility practitioners were asked to answer the same questions, about the persons <b>with</b> <b>low</b> <b>vision</b> whom they referred to the study, as well as about the <b>low</b> <b>vision</b> population in general. ^ The research methodology for the study incorporated descriptive survey and correlational designs. An evaluation of the data was conducted using exploratory data analyses, descriptive statistics, and correlational and t-test analyses. ^ Conclusions and implications for the field of mobility and for persons <b>with</b> <b>low</b> <b>vision</b> were discussed. This study was intended to contribute to theory development in <b>low</b> <b>vision</b> mobility, and was to serve as a heuristic tool stimulating further research in this area. ...|$|R
