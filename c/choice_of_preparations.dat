A variety of etiological agents (bacteria, viruses and protozoa) causing infectious diarrhoea, the high frequency of mixed infections, frequent failures and uneven course prove the necessity of search of ways for optimization of diagnostic and therapeutic approaches according to modern scientific data. The principles of clinical and laboratory diagnostics of AEI are considered in the article. Criteria of the assessment of a disease severity, predictive criteria of development of the life-threatening states connected with the exicosis are presented.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{design of}} novel {{biomaterials}} for applications in biological recognition, drug delivery, or diagnostics requires a judicious <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>preparation</b> conditions and methods {{for the production}} of well-characterized 3 -dimensional structures, preferably by benign processes. In this work, the polymerization of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) methacrylates was examined by kinetic gelation modeling and kinetic analysis in order to ascertain the factors affecting the resulting structure. The kinetics of the polymerization and structure of the final polymer network are strongly affected by the length of the PEG graft chain. The propagation of the polymer chains becomes increasingly diffusion limited with the incorporation of longer PEG grafts. In addition, a more heterogeneous network consisting of numerous microgel regions is produced as the length of the PE...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of nanotechnology {{has led to}} the design of cutting-edge nanomaterials with increasing levels of complexity. Although “traditional” solid, uniform nanoparticles are still the most frequently reported structures, new generations of nanoparticles have been constantly emerging over the last several decades. The outcome of this nano-art extends beyond nanomaterials with alternative compositions and/or morphologies. The current state-of-the-art allows for the design of nanostructures composed of different building blocks that exhibit diverse properties. Furthermore, those properties can be a reflection of either individual features, which are characteristic of a particular building block alone, and/or synergistic effects resulting from interactions between building blocks. Therefore, the unique structures as well as the outstanding properties of nanorattles have attracted increasing attention for possible biomedical and industrial applications. Although these nanoparticles resemble core–shell particles, they have a distinctive feature, which is a presence of a void that provides a homogenous environment for the encapsulated core. In this Review, we give a comprehensive insight into the fabrication of nanorattles. A special emphasis is put on the <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> building blocks as well as the <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>preparation</b> method, because those two aspects further influence properties and thus possible future applications, which will also be discussed...|$|R

40|$|We {{report on}} results of nonequilibrium {{transport}} measurements made on thin films of germanium-telluride (Ge_xTe) at cryogenic temperatures. Owing to {{a rather large}} deviation from stoichiometry (app. 10 % of Ge vacancies), these films exhibit p-type conductivity with carrier-concentration N> 10 ^ 20 cm^(- 3) and can be made either in the diffusive or strongly-localized regime by a judicious <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>preparation</b> and post-treatment conditions. In both regimes the system shows persistent photoconductivity following excitation by a brief exposure to infrared radiation. Persistent photoconductivity is also observed in GexTe samples alloyed with Mn. However, in both Ge_xTe and GeMn_xTe_y the effect is much weaker than that observable in GeSb_xTe_y alloys suggesting that antimony {{plays an important role}} in the phenomenon. Structural studies of these films reveal an unusual degree of texture that is rarely realized in strongly-disordered systems with high carrier-concentrations. Anderson-localized samples of Ge_xTe exhibit non-ergodic transport which are characteristic of intrinsic electron-glasses, including a well developed memory-dip and slow relaxation of the excess conductance created in the excited state. These results support the conjecture that electron-glass effects with inherently long relaxation times is a generic property of all Anderson-localized systems with large carrier-concentration...|$|R
40|$|Concerns {{regarding}} poor aqueous solubility, high toxicity {{and lack}} of specificity impede the translation of many hydrophobic anticancer agents into safe and effective anticancer drugs. The application of colloidal drug delivery systems, {{and in particular the}} use of lipid-based nanocarriers, has been identified as a promising means to overcome these issues. PEG-stabilized lipid nanodisks (lipodisks) have lately emerged as a novel type of biocompatible, nontoxic and adaptable drug nanocarrier. In this study we have explored the potential of lipodisks as a platform for formulation and tumour targeted delivery of hydrophobic anticancer agents. Using curcumin as a model compound, we show that lipodisks can be loaded with substantial amounts of hydrophobic drugs (curcumin/lipid molar ratio 0. 15). We demonstrate moreover that by deliberate <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>preparation</b> protocols the lipodisks can be provided with relevant amounts of targeting proteins, such as epidermal growth factor (EGF). Data from in vitro cell studies verify that such EGF-decorated curcumin-loaded lipodisks are capable of EGF-receptor specific targeting of human A- 431 tumour cells, and strongly suggest that the interaction between the lipodisks and the tumour cells results in receptor-mediated internalization of the disks and their cargo...|$|R

The changes in the structural, morphological and textural properties due to the <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>preparation</b> method were characterized by different techniques, such as XRD, N 2 physisorption isotherms and SEM. The XRD results of the solids present the formation of γ-Al 2 O 3 or CuO and β-Al(OH) 3, depending on the preparation method. The average crystallite diameters of the alumina were estimated by the Scherrer's formula with a particle size of 5. 2 nm. N 2 physisorption isotherms analysis shows that the alumina is a mesoporous material with a high specific surface area. An excessive increase in surface area was observed after Cu 2 + insertion by wet impregnation from β-Al(OH) 3 support, which is explained by the redissolution and recrystallization of bayerite to γ-Al 2 O 3 during the impregnation of Cu 2 + and recalcination process, respectively. The SEM images confirmed this phenomenon. Catalytic tests explain that the combination of the two methods improves the activity, selectivity and the stability in the conversion of glycerol to acetol.

Here, we report a marked improvement in the capacity retention of amorphous TiO 2 by the <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>preparation</b> solvent, control <b>of</b> annealing temperature, {{and the presence of}} surface functional groups. Careful heating of the amorphous TiO 2 sample prepared in acetone under vacuum lead to complete removal of all molecular solvent and an improved capacity retention of 220 mAh/g over 50 cycles at a C/ 10 rate. Amorphous TiO 2 when prepared in ethanol and heated under vacuum showed an even better capacity retention of 240 mAh/g. From Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy measurements, the improved capacity is attributed to the complete removal of ethanol and the presence of very small fractions of residual functional groups coordinated to oxygen-deficient surface titanium sites. These displace the more reactive chemisorbed hydroxyl groups, limiting reaction with components from the electrolyte and possibly enhancing the integrity of the solid electrolyte interface.

30|$|A {{number of}} other factors were also {{influential}} in directing test preparation behavior. Participants who reported that the test was not important for them tended to study little for it (P 2, P 5, P 12, P 15), demonstrating how washback is impeded through lack of perceived importance (Cheng 1997, 2005). Test takers’ interests {{also played a role}} in determining their <b>choices</b> <b>of</b> <b>preparation</b> strategies, especially towards learning activities that were not directly related to the test. For example, two participants (P 11, P 14) said that they listened to English not for the test but because they liked listening to particular programs (e.g., TED Talks). Similar findings were reported in Zhan and Andrews (2014) who noted that content <b>of</b> test <b>preparation</b> is partially directed by learners’ interests. Also, factors related to the learning environment, such as the time available and concurrent English classes, played a role. Eight test takers reported having very little time to study, thus impeding potential washback from the test. Finally, participants were concurrently taking classes as part of their undergraduate study within the liberal arts program, which apparently influenced their test preparation strategies as well. For instance, three participants had recently taken courses on reading and writing at university (P 11, P 16, P 6) and two more (P 1, P 8) were taking such courses {{at the time of the}} exam so they did not practice those skills for the test. Therefore, the potential for washback was mediated by participants’ wider learning environment.|$|R

Empirical research has rarely investigated the influence of the integrated skills task on test takers&# 039; preparation strategies. The study presented here set out to investigate {{the extent to which the}} introduction {{of integrated}} skills tasks may change students&# 039; test preparation strategies and the resources that they choose to use. The research focused on two integrated test types developed by PTE Academic: &# 039;repeat-sentence&# 039; and &# 039;re-tell lecture&# 039;, which assess both speaking and listening skills concurrently. Data on test-takers&# 039; strategies and resources were collected by using Oxford&# 039;s (1990) Strategy Inventory for Language Learning (SILL). The findings indicated that the integrated skills test influenced participants in relation to both their <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>preparation</b> strategies and the resources chosen. These choices seemed to vary in line with participants&# 039; awareness of different aspects of the new test.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a study concerning the macroscale deformation of soft stamps for nanoimprint lithography. Composite stamps {{consisting of two}} or three layers were prepared with varying process parameters, and the bow of the stamps was investigated with an optical profilometer. Deflection measurements were compared with results from a mechanical model in order to prove its validity. The composite stamps were prepared from polydimethylsiloxane (S-PDMS) and OrmoStamp layers on different substrate materials (silicon or AF- 32 -glass). The influence <b>of</b> selected <b>preparation</b> parameters on the deformation was investigated, such as layer thickness, curing, and hardbake temperatures, as well as UV-exposure intensities. It is discussed how an appropriate <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>preparation</b> parameters can reduce the deformation, too. By decreasing the curing intensity of a thin OrmoStamp layer, coated on top of a silicon wafer, from 200 mW/cm² to 2 mW/cm², the deformation was reduced from 6 µm to 0. It is shown that the mechanical model is capable of predicting the deformation of composite stamps consisting of OrmoStamp layers on top of a silicon substrate. Further on, deformation results for S-PDMS top layers are presented and discussed. As a promising process option for the reduction of stamp deformations, a new, room temperature curable PDMS recipe is introduced. For composite stamps prepared with this material, the deformation value was reduced below 10 lm, compared to values ranging from 10 µm up to 127 µm for thermally cured S-PDMS (50 °C or 70 °C). Finally, different two-layer stamps were coated with an additional third layer and measured again, in order to investigate the deflection for tri-layered cases. The research is of high relevance for the fabrication and application of substrate conformal imprint lithography stamps with minimized deflection...|$|R
