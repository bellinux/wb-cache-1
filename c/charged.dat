40|$|ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2017. As {{the number}} of Electric Vehicle (EV) increases, the uncoordinated <b>charging</b> {{behaviors}} may cause the <b>charging</b> demand fluctuations and the <b>charging</b> load unbalanced. Besides, the users’ <b>charging</b> behaviors are affected by many factors. For example, the residual energy of battery decides the travel distance of EV and if an EV has more residual energy, the <b>charging</b> willing is lower. Because EV users don’t have much willing to change their <b>charging</b> time and place {{just as in the}} past, the <b>charging</b> habit may also affect the <b>charging</b> decision. In this paper, we propose a smart <b>charging</b> startegy CDF (<b>Charging</b> Decision Function), where three sub-functions related to the residual energy of battery, EV’s <b>charging</b> habit, and the <b>charging</b> efficiency of <b>charging</b> station are all weighted and involved, for improving the balance of <b>charging</b> load and reducing the <b>charging</b> demand fluctuations. The <b>charging</b> decision is resulted from the CDF’s value, and if an EV decides to <b>charge,</b> the <b>charging</b> time as well as <b>charging</b> place is also calculated. Compared with other two related strategies, CDF has the best performance in terms of reducing the <b>charging</b> demand fluctuations.

5|$|The {{presence}} of charge {{gives rise to}} an electrostatic force: charges exert a force on each other, an effect that was known, though not understood, in antiquity. A lightweight ball suspended from a string can be <b>charged</b> by touching it with a glass rod that has itself been <b>charged</b> by rubbing with a cloth. If a similar ball is <b>charged</b> by the same glass rod, it is found to repel the first: the charge acts to force the two balls apart. Two balls that are <b>charged</b> with a rubbed amber rod also repel each other. However, if one ball is <b>charged</b> by the glass rod, and the other by an amber rod, the two balls are found to attract each other. These phenomena were investigated {{in the late eighteenth}} century by Charles-Augustin de Coulomb, who deduced that charge manifests itself in two opposing forms. This discovery led to the well-known axiom: like-charged objects repel and opposite-charged objects attract.|$|E
5|$|The type {{of current}} used plays an {{important}} role in arc welding. Consumable electrode processes such as shielded metal arc welding and gas metal arc welding generally use direct current, but the electrode can be <b>charged</b> either positively or negatively. In welding, the positively <b>charged</b> anode will have a greater heat concentration, and as a result, changing the polarity of the electrode affects weld properties. If the electrode is positively <b>charged,</b> the base metal will be hotter, increasing weld penetration and welding speed. Alternatively, a negatively <b>charged</b> electrode results in more shallow welds. Nonconsumable electrode processes, such as gas tungsten arc welding, can use either type of direct current, as well as alternating current. However, with direct current, because the electrode only creates the arc and does not provide filler material, a positively <b>charged</b> electrode causes shallow welds, while a negatively <b>charged</b> electrode makes deeper welds. Alternating current rapidly moves between these two, resulting in medium-penetration welds. One disadvantage of AC, the fact that the arc must be re-ignited after every zero crossing, has been addressed with the invention of special power units that produce a square wave pattern instead of the normal sine wave, making rapid zero crossings possible and minimizing the effects of the problem.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} image <b>charges,</b> interfacial <b>charge</b> discreteness, and surface roughness on spherical electric double layers in electrolyte solutions with divalent counter-ions {{in the setting of}} the primitive model. By using Monte Carlo simulations and the image <b>charge</b> method, the zeta potential profile and the integrated <b>charge</b> distribution function are computed for varying surface <b>charge</b> strengths and salt concentrations. Systematic comparisons were carried out between three distinct models for interfacial charges: 1) SURF 1 with uniform surface <b>charges,</b> 2) SURF 2 with discrete point <b>charges</b> on the interface, and 3) SURF 3 with discrete interfacial <b>charges</b> and finite excluded volume. By comparing the integrated <b>charge</b> distribution function (ICDF) and potential profile, we argue that the potential at the distance of one ion diameter from the macroion surface is a suitable location to define the zeta potential. In SURF 2 model, we find that image <b>charge</b> effects strongly enhance <b>charge</b> inversion for monovalent interfacial <b>charges,</b> and strongly suppress <b>charge</b> inversion for multivalent interfacial <b>charges.</b> For SURF 3, the image <b>charge</b> effect becomes much smaller. Finally, with image <b>charges</b> in action, we find that excluded volumes (in SURF 3) suppress <b>charge</b> inversion for monovalent interfacial <b>charges</b> and enhance <b>charge</b> inversion for multivalent interfacial <b>charges.</b> Overall, our results demonstrate that all these aspects, i. e., image <b>charges,</b> interfacial <b>charge</b> discreteness, their excluding volumes have significant impacts on the zeta potential, and thus the structure of electric double layers.
