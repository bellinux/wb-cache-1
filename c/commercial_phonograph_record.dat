5000|$|A subsidiary, Tri-Ergon Musik AG of Berlin, made <b>commercial</b> <b>phonograph</b> <b>records</b> for the German, French, Swedish and Danish markets {{from about}} 1928 to 1932. Although {{the product was}} advertised as [...] "Photo-Electro-Records," [...] it is unknown whether the sound-on-film process was {{actually}} used in making them, perhaps for simple cutting of the record.|$|R
50|$|Another of his {{significant}} contributions {{was in the}} technological sphere: {{he was the first}} conductor of note to make <b>commercial</b> <b>phonograph</b> <b>records,</b> all for the French Pathé company. His earliest recordings were issued on wax phonograph cylinders, none of which is known to survive, but a later group of recordings, made circa 1906 and issued on Pathé discs, has been remastered and reissued on CD. The works range from Beethoven to Widor, and announcements by Colonne are included.|$|R
5000|$|Wührer made {{numerous}} <b>commercial</b> <b>phonograph</b> <b>records.</b> While his discography includes 78 rpm records, such releases are {{outnumbered by}} his output {{during the early}} LP era, which was mostly for the American Vox label. Among his LP recordings was the first nominally complete cycle of Schubert's piano sonatas. It omitted a few fragmentary works, but it offered Ernst Krenek's completion of the C Major sonata D. 840 (Reliquie), possibly otherwise represented on records only by Ray Lev's Concert Hall Society account of similar vintage. [...] In recent years, some of Wührer's LP recordings have emerged on compact disc. Vox bypassed his Schubert sonata cycle in favor of one recorded {{a few years later}} in stereo by Walter Klien, but a third party, Bearac Reissues, appears to have issued compact disc editions of the set copied from LPs. Downloads of the Schubert recordings in [...]mp3 format are also available through Amazon.com.|$|R

It performed regularly at the Théatre du Châtelet, and premiered works by Debussy, Franck, Charles Gounod, Fauré, Massenet, and Sant-Saëns. Colonne invited leading European composers, including Richard Strauss, Edvard Grieg, and Piotr Tchaikovsky to conduct their works in Paris. He was also the first conductor of note to make <b>commercial</b> gramophone (<b>phonograph)</b> <b>records,</b> for the Pathé company in 1906.|$|R

5000|$|John A. Lomax {{recorded}} {{this song}} at the Cumins State Prison farm, Gould, Arkansas, in 1934 from its convict composer, Kelly Pace. The Negro singer, Lead Belly, heard it, rearranged {{it in his}} own style, and made <b>commercial</b> <b>phonograph</b> recordings of it in the 1940s. One of these recordings was studied and imitated phrase by phrase, by a young English singer of American folk songs to Lonnie Donegan, who subsequently recorded it for an English company. The record sold in the hundreds of thousands in the U.S. and England, and this Arkansas Negro convict song, as adapted by Leadbelly, was published as a personal copyright, words and music, by someone whose contact with the Rock Island Line was entirely through the grooves of a <b>phonograph</b> <b>record.</b>|$|R

40|$|To {{facilitate}} long-term {{preservation and}} sustain {{the utility of}} <b>phonograph</b> <b>records,</b> an efficient and economical workflow management system for digitization is necessary. We describe in this paper the digitization process for building an online digital collection of <b>phonograph</b> <b>records</b> and our procedure for creating the ground-truth data, which is essential for developing an efficient metadata and content capturing system. We also discuss the challenges of defining metadata for <b>phonograph</b> <b>records</b> and their packaging to enhance access and use across traditional boundaries...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} new metadata design, {{as part of}} a large digitization management system being developed, to assist in the consistent creation of digital libraries of <b>phonograph</b> <b>records.</b> The Metadata provides digital libraries with an effective tool for the description, discovery, management, control, delivery, and sharing of digital objects of <b>phonograph</b> <b>record.</b> The metadata design is the outcome of two pilot projects for the digitization of <b>phonograph</b> <b>records</b> that took place at the Marvin Duchow Music Library at McGill University. The new design offers an approach to maintaining and using digital sound and ensures the long-term viability of digital libraries of <b>phonograph</b> <b>records.</b> The dissertation discusses key areas of preservation and addresses the most common retrieval problems of music in digital libraries. These problems include challenges in the digital context of bibliographic control, cataloging, distribution, and copyright protection. The dissertation revisits traditional cataloging approaches, summarizes historical music cataloging and metadata development, sets up preservation principles and rationales for digitizing <b>phonograph</b> <b>records,</b> and presents state-of-the-art techniques for preserving <b>phonograph</b> <b>records</b> in the digital domain. The dissertation contains three main parts. The first is an introduction to the new metadata design for <b>phonograph</b> <b>records.</b> The second is a metadata dictionary, which assigns precise syntactic and semantic meanings to metadata elements, to guide digitizers working in libraries, archives, museums, and heritage sectors. These will be followed by two case studies of <b>phonograph</b> <b>record</b> digitization projects using the Metadata and the Data Dictionary. The dissertation concludes by examining three challenges that are critical to future development in both the preserving of and access to phonograph records: the issue of interoperability between different metadata standards, the need for usability and quality evaluation of digitization management systems, and the importance of further development in digital library retrieval services and tools...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the first Optical Audio Reconstruction (OAR) approach {{for the long-term}} digital preservation of stereo <b>phonograph</b> <b>records.</b> OAR uses precision metrology and digital image processing to obtain and convert groove contour data into digital audio for access and preservation. This contactless and imaging-based approach has considerable advantages over the traditional mechanical methods, such as being the only optical method {{with the potential to}} restore broken stereo records. Although past efforts on monophonic <b>phonograph</b> <b>records</b> have been successful, no attempts on 33 rpm long-playing stereo records (LPs) have been reported.
