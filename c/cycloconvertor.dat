40|$|Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of {{requirements for the}} degree of BACHELOR OF ENGINEERING In ELECTRICAL. This project presents a new single-phase to three-phase cycloconverter suitable for driving an induction motor. Using discrete variable frequency technique, a single-phase to three-phase modulation strategy is proposed, the output frequency of this <b>cycloconvertor</b> can be {{up to half of}} the input frequency. Only six naturally communicated thyristors are employed, so the resulting cycloconverter-motor drive system is cheap and compact. Software in C and assembly language has been written for real-time control. The simulation based on Matlab/Simulink is used to predict the performance for the cycloconverter and induction motor...|$|E
40|$|The {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with static frequency changers, using solid-state switching devices, capable of directly (i. e. without an intermediate dc link) converting polyphase ac power of a given frequency to single or polyphase power of a chosen frequency. The thesis consists of two parts. The first part, comprising five chapters, {{is devoted to the}} study of ideal frequency changers operated from ac Sources having zero internal impedance. The second part, comprising two chapters, considers sources with finite internal impedances. Chapter 1 introduces the basic concepts of static frequency conversion, outlines the basic mathematical models representing static frequency changers and defines the output and input performance indicators. Chapter 2 presents a detailed investigation of that class of three-pulse frequency changers which will be studied in the thesis. A large portion of the chapter is devoted to the study of output waveform generation. The mathematical tools of the investigation, existence matrices and modulating functions, are introduced and defined. Analytical expressions for output waveforms corresponding to various practical modulating functions are derived and the related performance indicators are computed. Assuming a given desired output performance, criteria for an optimal modulating function are established. It is proved that only one system can generate an output waveform conforming to the postulated prerequisites. This system is termed the "Unrestricted" Frequency Changer. Expressions for the input current waves are also derived in this chapter and the corresponding input performance indicators are determined. The concept of a new frequency changer having the unique property of providing unity input power factor, regardless of the load, is introduced. This system is termed the "Unity Power Factor" Frequency Changer. In Chapter 3 the previous results are extended to systems having pulse numbers which are integral multiples of three. Chapter 4 is devoted to the study of output voltage control. Three basic methods are analysed and detailed quantitative data for output voltage and input current waves, and the related performance indicators, are presented in graphical form. In Chapter 5 special aspects of static frequency changing are investigated. It is shown that the input displacement factor is variable. The concept of the "Controlled Displacement Factor" Frequency Changer is introduced It is proven that the naturally commutated <b>cycloconvertor</b> is theoretically equivalent to a particular "Controlled Displacement Factor" Frequency Changer. Chapter 6 presents a detailed analysis of the "Unrestricted" Frequency Changer, operated from an ac source with finite internal impedance. The basic conditions are defined and an outline is given of the techniques of symmetrical components used for the analysis. The input current, input terminal voltage and output voltage waveforms are expressed in terms of the input terminal impedance and the positive, negative and zero sequence components of the output currents. The equivalent sequence impedances and the output impedance matrix are derived. The output voltage unbalance is computed under various conditions and presented in graphical form. The relationships between the amplitudes of the unwanted components in the output waveform and the resonant frequency of the input terminal circuit are also graphically presented. The results obtained are verified by computer simulations. In Chapter 7 a similar analysis of the "Unity Power Factor" Frequency Changer is carried out. The computed data are also graphically presented. Again, the results are verified by appropriate computer simulations...|$|E
