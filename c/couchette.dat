25|$|Another of {{the more}} {{substantial}} examples of current European sleeping car service is the Train Bleu, an all-sleeping-car train. The train leaves Paris from the Gare d'Austerlitz in mid evening and arrives in Nice about 8 in the morning, providing both first-class rooms and <b>couchette</b> accommodations. The train's principal popularity is with older travelers; it has not won {{the same degree of}} popularity with younger travelers. Recently, the upper class coaches (wagons lits) have been sold to foreign railroad companies, so that only <b>couchette</b> cars (1st and 2nd class) as well as seating coaches remain. The Train Bleu is part of the French night service network called Intercités de Nuit.|$|E
25|$|A {{major portion}} of {{passenger}} cars in India are sleeper/couchette cars. With railways {{as one of the}} primary mode of passenger transport, sleeper cars vary from economical to First Class AC (air conditioned). Most Indian trains come in combinations of first class A/C and non-A/C private sleeper cars with doors, and A/C and non-A/C 3-tier or 2-tier <b>couchette</b> arrangements.|$|E
25|$|A regular daily {{rest period}} may be {{interrupted}} {{no more than}} twice, but the total interruption must not exceed 1 hour in total. This allows for a vehicle to be driven on to a ferry and off again {{at the end of}} the crossing. Where the rest period is interrupted in this way, the total accumulated rest period must still be 11 hours. A bunk or <b>couchette</b> must be available during the rest period.|$|E

25|$|In modern Europe, {{a number}} of {{sleeping}} car services continue to operate, though they face strong competition from high-speed day trains and budget airlines, sometimes leading to the cancellation or consolidation of services. In some cases, trains are split and recombined {{in the dead of}} night, making it possible to offer several connections with {{a relatively small number of}} trains. Generally, the trains consist of sleeping cars with private compartments, <b>couchette</b> cars, and sometimes cars with normal seating.|$|E
25|$|Modern, air {{conditioned}} sleeping cars and <b>couchette</b> cars {{are part of}} Croatian Railways rolling stock. Croatian sleeping coaches include single, double or 4-beds compartments with washbasin and many additional hygienic accessories. Passengers also have catering services on their disposal and are given complementary breakfast {{depending on the type}} of bought ticket. In Croatia, night train with sleeping carriages included operates on route between two largest Croatian towns, Zagreb and Split. Regarding international transport, Croatian sleeping coaches are included on EuroNight lines Zagreb-Munich-Zagreb and Zagreb-Zürich-Zagreb.|$|E
2500|$|An {{example of}} a more basic type of {{sleeping}} car is the European <b>couchette</b> car, which is divided into compartments for four or six people, with bench-configuration seating {{during the day and}} [...] "privacyless" [...] double- or triple-level bunk-beds at night.|$|E
50|$|The TVS2000 {{currently}} has coaches, sleepers, diners, <b>couchettes</b> and generator cars. The {{first to be}} introduced were the coaches in 1992. The diners and sleepers were introduced in 1998 and <b>couchettes</b> were introduced {{a few years later}} along with the generator cars. The State railways have already replaced most of their intercity fleet with the TVS2000s and they should replace all of them in a few years. In 2006 TÜVASAŞ introduced new TVS2000 Conference cars and Parlor cars, however these cars are used only for charters.|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} 1980s PKP offered {{motorail}} services between the following stations: Szczecin Dąbie, Trzebiatów, Gdynia Główna, Warszawa Główna, Poznań Główny, Katowice, Kraków Główny, and Zakopane. Services ran overnight and passengers were carried in sleeping cars and <b>couchettes.</b>|$|R
2500|$|When {{the first}} ICE1 power cars were {{commissioned}} in late 1989, the intermediate cars {{were not yet}} available. Instead, they were coupled to retired <b>couchette</b> cars (type yl) that were homologated for 200km/h. These were fitted with special couplings for compatibility to the power cars. Usually, Class 110 locomotives served as Angstlok {{as well as for}} pulling the train on the return trip. For braking tests, the locos were sometimes coupled between two power cars, with match wagons on both sides. The test runs usually started at the Opladen repair workshop and used lines in the vicinity. Fast runs at up to 200km/h were to Bielefeld and Bremen. Because of time pressure, some power cars ware used for tests that had not yet been accepted by Bundesbahn. For longer test runs, two [...] "dummy trainsets" [...] comprising eleven <b>couchette</b> cars and ten InterCity cars (type Bm235) respectively were used to replace the missing intermediate cars.|$|E
2500|$|Express {{service is}} between major cities and are fast, {{comfortable}} and equipped with modern air conditioned TVS2000 railcars and only stop at important stations. Express trains {{have an average}} operating speed of [...] to [...] The most express service is between İstanbul and Eskişehir with 8 trains daily in each direction. Express service also has overnight trains between major cities far apart (e.g. İstanbul-Kars). These trains have coaches, a dining car and a sleeping car or a <b>couchette</b> car or sometimes both.|$|E
50|$|In some countries, rail pass holders {{can travel}} on sleeper or <b>couchette</b> {{compartment}} freely, while some {{may need to}} pay some extra fee or are totally restricted from taking sleeper or <b>couchette</b> trains.|$|E
50|$|Sleeper {{trains are}} very common {{especially}} in Europe. There are nightly sleeper trains in most countries. Sleeper trains usually consist of single or double-berth compartments {{as well as}} <b>couchettes</b> which have 4 or 6 beds (a bottom, middle and top bunk {{on each side of}} the compartment).|$|R
5000|$|Two-level Type B <b>couchettes</b> {{had four}} beds {{which could be}} {{individually}} enclosed with a curtain. While normally used by individual travelers, there were also [...] "B Compartments", which had a door that could be closed and used as a private room {{for a group of}} four people (or fewer if the travelers wished to pay for the extra bed(s)).|$|R
50|$|Aside {{from the}} Desiro, CFR has also {{bought in the}} past few years 80 new {{sleeping}} cars (WLABmee type), <b>couchettes,</b> InterCity cars, as well as double-decker cars to use on Accelerat and Rapid trains of a high volume of passengers. The new CFR sleepers are some of the most modern in Europe, having air-conditioning, LCD screens and modern showers in each compartment.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>couchette</b> {{and seated}} cars were {{converted}} from existing Deutsche Bundesbahn and Deutsche Reichsbahn coaches. <b>Couchette</b> cars have 4 or 6 berths {{and there are}} three different categories in use, which differ in respect of their additional functions: ...|$|E

5000|$|... {{are high}} quality {{international}} night trains which include sleepers and <b>couchettes.</b> A supplement {{is required for}} a bed or berth. For travel on a domestic EN, as with IC trains, {{it is necessary to}} pay a supplement for a seat in a standard carriage. On certain EN trains which operate across Europe, standard international prices apply together with a reservation fee.|$|R
50|$|The Tren Francés (also spelled El Francés or Especial), {{named after}} the country of origin of the coaches (France), donated by SNCF to FFCC in 2001, is the fastest long-distance service in Cuba. It has the most modern coaches and {{is divided into two}} classes named primera especial (1st) and primera (nominally 1st, idenfitiable as 2nd). There are no {{sleeping}} cars, <b>couchettes</b> or car-carrying wagons.|$|R
50|$|Many {{overnight}} {{trains in}} Europe require reservations with extra costs for sleeping accommodation such as <b>couchettes</b> or in sleeping cars, and some {{may not have}} any non-sleeper cars. However, as mentioned, a direct overnight train leaving after 7pm only requires filling in one line of the pass, for the following day. This rule cannot be used if that day {{would be the first}} one on which the pass is valid.|$|R
50|$|From Nador {{there are}} 4 trains per day calling at Fes {{and the same}} applies to Oujda. One of the daily trains to/from Oujda is a {{so-called}} hoteltrain that offers only <b>couchette</b> places, and with <b>couchette</b> tickets available on all night-trains. Traveltimes from Fes to Nador is approximately 6 hours, and to Oujda approximately 5.5 hours.|$|E

50|$|There {{is another}} express train called Panonija (numbers 437-436) going from Subotica in Serbia to Bar in Montenegro, which stops in Novi Sad, Novi Beograd, Prijepolje and Podgorica. It {{consists}} of ŽS and ŽCG second class coaches, <b>couchette</b> and sleeping cars. In summer, it has through <b>couchette</b> cars from Prague or Bratislava or through sleeping cars from Moscow or Kiev to Bar.|$|E
5000|$|Ngaoundéré is {{the gateway}} to the province, and it is most easily {{accessible}} from southern Cameroon via the [...] "Transcam II" [...] rail line. The trip takes between 12 and 30 hours, but the presence of <b>couchettes</b> makes the journey bearable {{for those who can}} afford them. Other passengers are crammed into all available seats, however, including those in the dining car. Due to the overcrowded conditions, thieves are another hazard.|$|R
5000|$|In 1985, {{thanks to}} his {{political}} connections, he was made {{head of the state}} railways. Three years later he was forced by his own party to resign, charged with fraud for vast sums of money spent on throwaway sheets for <b>couchettes,</b> bought by the railways in a crooked contract for 10 times their real value (known as the [...] "lenzuola d'oro" [...] or [...] "golden sheets" [...] scandal). Subsequently, there were other charges of bribery, corruption and embezzlement.|$|R
50|$|Service was {{interrupted}} during the Second World War but resumed in 1949, {{when the train}} officially took the name Le Train Bleu. Scheduled airline service began between Paris and Nice in 1945, which took away much of the wealthy clientele. In 1962 the rollingstock was replaced by MU coaches and second class coaches were introduced in the Blue Train. In 1971 the CIWL sold its rolling stock to the national railway companies that operated the trains further on. After 1978, the train added cars with <b>couchettes</b> to attract more middle-class passengers.|$|R

50|$|Large {{locomotives}} can {{be substituted}} for small locomotives where more power is needed. Also, different types of passenger cars (such as reclining-seats, compartment cars, <b>couchettes,</b> sleepers, restaurant cars, buffet cars, etc.) can be easily added to or removed from a locomotive-hauled train. This {{is not so easy}} for a multiple unit, since individual cars can be attached or detached only in a maintenance facility. This also allows a loco-hauled train to be flexible in terms of number of cars. Cars can be removed or added one by one, but on multiple units two or more units have to be coupled. This is not so flexible.|$|R
50|$|Rolling {{stock on}} InterRegional trains has {{recently}} been the object of CFR's modernisation plan. Various classes of cars have been refurbished, and fitted with air-conditioning, ecological toilets, etc. However, a small and rapidly declining number of Rapid rolling stock, mainly on lesser-used routes, remains fairly aged and outdated. As of 2004, Siemens Desiro DMUs have been introduced on medium-distance Rapid routes. Most Rapid rolling stock is painted in red, usually with a white horizontal stripe. All cars are compartmented and first class is usually air-conditioned, with 6 seats per compartment both in second class and first class. Sleepers, <b>couchettes</b> and dining-cars are available on most long routes.|$|R
