5|$|The Australian-led INTERFET {{intervention}} into East Timor in September 1999 {{marked the}} closest Australia's F-111s came to combat. F-111s from both No. 1 and No. 6 Squadrons were deployed to RAAF Base Tindal, Northern Territory, on 28 August {{to support the}} international forces, and remained there until 17 December 1999. This was a maximum effort for No. 82 Wing, and up to 10 F-111Cs were available at Tindal; No. 1 Squadron's commitment peaked at six aircraft and about 100 personnel. No. 75 Squadron also maintained 12 F/A-18s at its home base of Tindal to support INTERFET if needed. From 20 September, when INTERFET began to arrive in East Timor, the F-111s were maintained {{at a high level}} of readiness to conduct reconnaissance flights or air strikes if the situation deteriorated. For the latter role two F-111s armed with <b>concrete-filled</b> bombs fitted with precision guidance kits were kept available at all times. INTERFET did not encounter significant resistance, however, and F-111 operations were limited to reconnaissance missions conducted by RF-111Cs from 5 November. Each of these sorties were made after gaining approval from the Indonesian government and normally focused on bridges and communications installations. The last RF-111C flight over East Timor took place on 9 December. War games had the F-111s achieving complete success if a strike was necessary against Indonesian military headquarters near the capital.|$|E
25|$|The {{site was}} {{impacted}} through modern anthropogenic modifications of the landscape. Most noticeable was a <b>concrete-filled</b> posthole for a chain-link fence. The auguring of the posthole {{was the cause}} for discovery of both the Moatfield village and ossuary. Despite the unearthing of human remains, construction continued and the posthole was filled with concrete; an action that impacted the bones immediately adjacent and below the posthole. Electrical wiring and water pipes also transected the site but had no direct effect on the ossuary.|$|E
25|$|Later {{applications}} of continuously supported track include Balfour Beatty's 'embedded slab track', {{which uses a}} rounded rectangular rail profile (BB14072) embedded in a slipformed (or pre-cast) concrete base (development 2000s). The 'embedded rail structure', used in the Netherlands since 1976, initially used a conventional UIC54 rail embedded in concrete, and later developed (late 1990s) to use a 'mushroom' shaped SA42 rail profile; a version for light rail using a rail supported in an asphalt <b>concrete–filled</b> steel trough has also been developed (2002).|$|E
25|$|The Japanese {{attempted}} {{to deny the}} Russians use of Port Arthur. During the night of 13–14 February, the Japanese {{attempted to}} block the entrance to Port Arthur by sinking several <b>concrete-filled</b> steamers in the deep water channel to the port, but they sank too deep to be effective. A similar attempt to block the harbour entrance during the night of 3–4 May also failed. In March, the charismatic Vice Admiral Makarov had taken command of the First Russian Pacific Squadron {{with the intention of}} breaking out of the Port Arthur blockade.|$|E
500|$|The {{company was}} unable to finance the {{building}} of Ordish's design, and in 1870 a new Act of Parliament was passed giving the company permission to build a bridge [...] wide, crossing the river with five spans. Ordish was asked to design a cheaper bridge to the new specifications but refused to change the design, so Julian Tolmé was appointed designer in his place. Tolmé designed a starkly functional lattice truss bridge of wrought iron. It cost £40,000 (about £ in [...] ) to build, and consisted of five identical spans, supported by four pairs of <b>concrete-filled</b> iron piers; each of the cylindrical piers was sunk [...] into the riverbed. The bridge was due to open in early 1873, but the workmen building it went on strike, and a third Act of Parliament was necessary to give the company time to resolve the dispute and complete the project.|$|E
500|$|A {{site was}} chosen for this on {{the western edge of}} the Clinton Engineer Works site where it could draw cold water from the Clinch River and {{discharge}} warm water into Poplar Creek without affecting the inflow. Groves approved this location on 3 May 1943. Surveying began on the power plant site on 31 May 1943, and J. A. Jones started construction work the following day. Because the bedrock was [...] below the surface, the power plant was supported on 40 <b>concrete-filled</b> caissons. Installation of the first boiler commenced in October 1943. [...] Construction work was complete by late September. To prevent sabotage, the power plant was connected to the gaseous diffusion plant by an underground conduit. Despite this, there was one act of sabotage, in which a nail was driven through the electric cable. The culprit was never found, but was considered more likely to be a disgruntled employee than an Axis spy.|$|E

50|$|The centre's {{collection}} includes twelve Second World War-era, RAF ground {{vehicles and}} a <b>concrete-filled,</b> practice Upkeep bomb (bouncing bomb).|$|E
50|$|The piers are {{supported}} on 914 mm <b>concrete-filled</b> tubular steel piles and the abutments {{are supported}} by steel 'H' piles.|$|E
50|$|The nearby UNC {{checkpoint}} (CP No. 3, situated {{next to the}} Bridge of No Return) was {{no longer}} used after the mid-1980s when <b>concrete-filled</b> bollards {{were placed in the}} road to make vehicle passage impossible.|$|E
50|$|The casing - {{through its}} {{flexural}} rigidity - provides the lateral support against flexural buckling of the core. It is typically made of <b>concrete-filled</b> steel tubes. The design criterion for the casing {{is to provide}} adequate lateral restraint (i.e. rigidity) against the steel core buckling.|$|E
50|$|Depending on the {{duration}} {{and the nature}} of the temporary signals, the equipment can be installed in different way. One way is to use the permanent traffic signals mounted temporary poles such as poles in <b>concrete-filled</b> barrels. Another way is to use portable pedestrian crossing signals.|$|E
50|$|After the {{completion}} of removal of the superstructure there remained the problem of removing the <b>concrete-filled</b> columns down to 20 feet below water level {{in the area of}} navigation. Demolition of the masonry approach viaduct too became much delayed; it was eventually dropped by explosives on 10 March 1968.|$|E
50|$|In 1881 a {{wrought iron}} bridge was {{constructed}} with five spans of plate girders supported on <b>concrete-filled</b> iron cylinders.When {{the bridge was}} superseded by the 1906 bridge the tracks were removed.In 2008-2009 the 1881 bridge was dismantled and removed by Carillion Civil Engineering {{to make way for}} the 2009 Tees Bridge.|$|E
50|$|The {{bridge is}} {{constructed}} of two 1200 mm diameter high-strength steel pipes, bent into twin arches that rise 21.3 m above grade, and suspend the deck {{by way of}} 44 stainless-steel hangers, each 50 mm in diameter. The foundation consists of <b>concrete-filled</b> caissons which go down 30 m below grade to the bedrock.|$|E
50|$|The Hurricane-La Verkin Bridge {{spans the}} Virgin River, {{connecting}} {{the towns of}} Hurricane and LaVerkin in Utah. The five-panel steel Warren pony truss spans 75 ft, and is supported by <b>concrete-filled</b> steel cylinder piers. It {{is one of the}} oldest Warren pony truss bridges in Utah, built in 1908 by the Midland Bridge Company.|$|E
50|$|The bridge {{platform}} is 8 ft wide {{with a gentle}} arch. It has simple timber guard rails of the post-and-rail type. The deck was originally constructed of asphalt-coated timber slats. The central pier rests on two connected cylindrical columns of <b>concrete-filled</b> brick. The abutments are built of brick capped with concrete copings; they rest on timber piles. The timberwork is painted white and the ironwork black.|$|E
5000|$|The {{geodesic}} dome {{is actually}} a triacon truss rising to a height of 103 feet and is 274 feet in diameter.289 The dome is built using approximately 65,000 parts, including 13 miles of extruded aluminum tubing and tension rods bolted into hexagons. There are no internal supports and the entire 80-ton weight rests on five <b>concrete-filled</b> pylons driven up to 77 feet into the earth.23910 ...|$|E
50|$|The Old M-94-Au Train River Bridge uses a 60 ft span MSHD {{standard}} through {{girder bridge}} design to carry Wolkoff Road over the Au Train River. The structure {{has a single}} plate girder span, with a steel stringer approach span on each end. The stringers are supported by concrete abutments and <b>concrete-filled</b> steel cylinder piers. The main span consistes of two 60 ft through girders, joined by four I-beams underneath.|$|E
50|$|The Shannon at {{this point}} {{consists}} of two channels divided by Hayes Island, {{the one on the}} County Tipperary side being about 79 m (260 ft) wide, and that on the Galway side being about 73 m (240 ft) wide. Each channel is spanned by three pairs of mild-steel plate girders, either 24 m (80 ft) or 27 m (90 ft) in length, resting on 3 m (9 ft) diameter <b>concrete-filled</b> cast-iron cylinders.|$|E
50|$|The Strauss Heel-trunnion type {{bridge was}} {{designed}} by former Otis Elevator Company Chief Engineer Thomas Ellis Brown of New York and built in 1920 by the J. E. FitzGerald Construction Company of New London, Connecticut, according to its historical marker. Its movable span is 85 ft wide, 218 ft long, weighs 660 ST, and employs two 230 ST <b>concrete-filled</b> counterweights. Until 1928, the bridge carried streetcars of the Groton and Stonington Street Railway.|$|E
50|$|Title was sought, and granted, for the {{construction}} of a new lighthouse, and $5,000 were set aside to cover costs. But it was soon decided that maritime traffic did not really justify the reconstruction of the tower, and the monies reverted to the Department of the Treasury. A privately maintained beacon was located at the same site until 1908, at which point an automated, flashing light on a <b>concrete-filled</b> caisson was erected by the government for $8,000.|$|E

50|$|The pole {{is often}} 10 ft high, {{and can be}} as low as 7 ft high {{depending}} upon {{the height of the}} players. To keep the pole stationary, it is either anchored down by using a <b>concrete-filled</b> tire or a blow molded plastic base filled with sand or water or in some cases concrete, or is embedded in the ground. The rope is generally slender nylon, and is long enough so that the ball hangs about 2 ft above the ground.|$|E

5000|$|Lake View Cemetery is on {{the east}} side of Cleveland, Ohio, along the East Cleveland and Cleveland Heights borders. More than 104,000 people are buried at Lake View, with more than 700 burials each year. There are 70 acre {{remaining}} for future development. Known locally as [...] "Cleveland's Outdoor Museum," [...] Lake View Cemetery is home to the James A. Garfield Memorial, Wade Memorial Chapel, which features an interior designed by Louis Tiffany, as well as an 80000000 gal capacity <b>concrete-filled</b> dam.|$|E
50|$|As of the 2007-2008 winter, the old girder {{works of}} the {{original}} lighthouse were removed and replaced by a single <b>concrete-filled</b> caisson with superstructure tower and light and placards. Note the rip rap of the original light surrounds the new structure, which is right at sea level and sometimes not visible. The lighthouse should not be approached within a 100-foot radius; on Sunday 25 May 2008 a sailboat went aground on these rocks and required USCG and Sea Tow assistance to be towed off.|$|E
5000|$|The {{bridge was}} {{formerly}} {{referred to as}} the [...] "Xylophone Bridge" [...] because of the sound its wooden decking made when traffic traveled over it. This decking was replaced in 1949 with 3 in <b>concrete-filled</b> [...] "I-beam lok" [...] grating topped with a 2.25 in thick bituminous wearing surface. At this time, all bearings were replaced, and the trolley car tracks were removed, as were granite blocks. The trolley car poles were reused for street lights. Ramps between the bridge and the under-construction Storrow Drive were added.|$|E

50|$|The six {{lights were}} similar in form and, {{excepting}} the first, nearly identical in construction. Each consisted of a framework of four steel, <b>concrete-filled</b> piles driven deep into the ocean floor, upon which a square platform was set. This platform contained the living quarters and was assembled from a set of modules. A tower was attached to one corner and housed the light. The roof of the living quarters formed a helipad; a dock was also provided low on the framework. The name of the station was displayed on a large sign {{on each side of}} the light, on the side of or just below the platform.|$|E
5000|$|A kinetic {{projectile}} {{can also}} be dropped from aircraft. This is applied by replacing the explosives of a regular bomb with a non-explosive material (e.g. concrete), for a precision hit with less collateral damage. A typical bomb has a mass of 900 kg and a speed of impact of 800 km/h (220 m/s). It is also applied for training the act of dropping a bomb with explosives. http://www.fas.org/news/iraq/1999/10/991007-iraq.htm This method {{has been used in}} Operation Iraqi Freedom and the subsequent military operations in Iraq by mating <b>concrete-filled</b> training bombs with JDAM GPS guidance kits, to attack vehicles and other relatively [...] "soft" [...] targets located too close to civilian structures for the use of conventional high explosive bombs.|$|E
5000|$|On 17 July 1866 the Cookham Bridge Company {{announced}} that a new iron bridge would be built and requested designs. 37 schemes were submitted and the contract was awarded to Messrs Pease, Hutchinson & Co Ltd of the Skerne Ironworks, Darlington for a bridge of two wrought iron girders supported by eight pairs of <b>concrete-filled</b> iron pillars. The estimated cost was £2,520 (equivalent to £), some £1000 cheaper even than the estimate for the 1840 wooden construction. The remarkably low cost, due to Pease & Hutchinson being major iron manufacturers and prolific bridge builders, led to the new bridge being known as [...] "the cheapest bridge on the River for its size".|$|E
5000|$|Wanxian Bridge, or Wanzhou Bridge (...) , is a {{reinforced}} concrete arch bridge {{built over the}} Yangtze River in 1997. It {{is located in the}} vicinity of the Three Gorges Dam in Wanzhou, Chongqing, China. The arch span is 420 m and the total length of the bridge is 864.12 m. [...] The clearance height to the river below is 133 m however the full clearance is no longer visible as the reservoir created by the construction of the Three Gorges Dam has increased the height of the water. During the bridge construction, a <b>concrete-filled</b> tubular arch truss frame was built to support the weight of the concrete arch and embedded into the concrete arch.|$|E
5000|$|Afterwards, {{the action}} {{moves to a}} junkyard, where the Germans, the boys, the comedians, and President Barack Obama {{overlook}} a massive hole. The boys push a wooden crate onto a platform, where it is encased inside three massive metallic shells and dropped into the large hole, which is filled with concrete. Funnybot then appears, stating that he now knows that comedy {{is meant to be}} performed by humans. A noise is heard from the <b>concrete-filled</b> hole, and it is revealed to be Tyler Perry, buried in the ground. Jimmy admits that he has learned his lesson and promises that {{there will not be a}} comedy awards show next year, and Cartman ends the episode by saying [...] "Or will there be?", breaking the fourth wall.|$|E
5000|$|The Martin Reef Lighthouse {{sits on a}} 65 ft square <b>concrete-filled</b> crib, {{placed in}} 10 ft at the {{southeast}} edge of the reef. The crib is the base for a pier containing cellar storage areas for coal and water. Additional concrete forms an external [...] "wave flare" [...] around the pier, and the resulting pier structure is approximately 25 ft high from its base. The lighthouse itself is a 25 ft square, white, three-story structure made of a skeletal steel frame covered with reinforced concrete and iron and sheathed with steel. The lighthouse is centered on the crib. The {{first floor of the}} lighthouse was designed as an engine room, the second floor as an office, kitchen, and living area, while the third floor contained sleeping rooms.|$|E
