40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the impact of}} high altitude shipments on package integrity. High altitude shipments are encountered when trucks travel over high mountain passes or when cargo and feeder aircraft transport packages in non-pressurized or partially-pressurized cargo holds. Both these types of transport methods will result in severe changes in pressure and temperature conditions as compared to packages being transported close to sea-level The testing of packages under these conditions is critical since package integrity may be compromised. The current shipping tests performed in test labs do not account for pressure changes and vibration together. This study showed that <b>combination</b> <b>packages</b> for dangerous goods and hazardous materials that are tested to existing UN, ICAO and US DOT requirements are limited, and can result in significant number if leaks.

We focus on three large C-RCTs that will start soon and are designed to test the hypothesis that <b>combination</b> prevention <b>packages,</b> including expanded access to antiretroviral therapy, can substantially reduce HIV incidence. Using a general framework to integrate mathematical modelling analysis into the design, conduct, and analysis of C-RCTs will complement traditional statistical analyses and strengthen the {{evaluation of the}} interventions.

40|$|Besides {{contributing}} to the actual sustainability performance of a product-packaging <b>combination,</b> <b>packaging</b> can {{also play a role}} in communicating about sustainability. Such green marketing aspects of packaging may either focus on the sustainability credentials of the packaging itself, or on the credentials of the product contained (or even the company or brand). Communication about sustainability can be explicit (in words or labels) or implicit (through materials, images and/or colours). The implicit form could be described as sustainable aesthetics. The explicit form can be presented either as factual information or in the form of stories. People engage more with stories than with factual information, as it allows for easier connections with previous experiences. Hence, storytelling makes for a compelling marketing tactic. Instead of telling a story yourself as a brand, enabling and encouraging your consumers to tell your story to their peers offers strong marketing potential as well. This paper will explore sustainable storytelling through packaging by reviewing the literature on storytelling within marketing, with a specific focus on sustainability and on packaging. Furthermore, two small empirical studies will be presented, followed by a design case study. Design EngineeringIndustrial Design Engineerin...|$|R
