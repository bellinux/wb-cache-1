In SBML Level 1, mathematical formulas are represented as text strings using a C-like syntax. This representation was chosen because of its simplicity, widespread familiarity and use in applications such as GEPASI and Jarnac, whose authors contributed to the initial design of SBML. In SBML Levels 2 and 3, {{there was a need}} to expand the mathematical vocabulary of Level 1 to include additional functions (both built-in and user-defined), mathematical constants, logical operators, relational operators and a special symbol to represent time. Rather than growing the simple C-like syntax into something more complicated and esoteric in order to support these features, and consequently having to manage two standards in two different formats (XML and text string formulas), SBML Levels 2 and 3 leverage an existing standard for expressing mathematical formulas, namely the <b>content</b> <b>portion</b> of MathML.|$|E

The standard provides the modeling and simulation community a common mechanism for verifying and loading military scenarios, {{the ability to create}} a military scenario that can be shared between simulations and C 4 I devices, a way to improve scenario consistency between federated simulations, and the ability to reuse military scenarios as scenario descriptions are standardized throughout the Army, Joint, and international communities and across simulation domains; e. g., training exercise, analysis, etc. MSDL files are used to initialize data in simulations; however, the current version of the MSDL standard does not include expression of tasks for simulated forces to perform that can be preloaded for execution or scheduling when the simulation starts.

40|$|Background: Teaching Certificate Programs, or Teaching and Learning Curriculums  (TLC), are {{programs}} that offer PGY 1 and PGY 2 pharmacy residents training in teaching skills. TLC programs serve {{to prepare students}} for clinical and academic roles focused on teaching. The Indiana Pharmacy Resident Teaching Certificate Program seeks to improve their current website in content and user-friendliness, and aims to use other TLC websites/programs and existing guidelines to modify their current website. The objective {{of this study is to}} critically evaluate TLC program websites around the United States in order to modify IPTeC 2 ̆ 7 s own website based upon these assessments. Methods: A rubric was designed to evaluate website content as it relates to current American College of Clinical Pharmacy and American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy recommendations, as well as website design based on the US Department of Health and Human Services guidelines for web design. The rubric used a 4 -grade scale for many of the factors evaluated, and a yes/no scale for the remaining factors. Results: Seventy-three total TLC programs were found using a Google web search and the AACP website, of which only twenty-eight were suitable to be evaluated. In the <b>content</b> <b>portion</b> of the evaluation, the median and mode total score were 44 out of a possible 70 points. The webpage design portion had a median score of 25 and a mode score of 24 out of a possible 36. The most common lacking content recommendations were: self-reflective statement, teaching mentors, multiple learning styles, and patient case development. The FAQ page was the most common low-scoring web design recommendation. Conclusion: Most websites related to TLC program information show non-adherence to recommendations in similar areas. These websites score above-average in both content and web design, and this information can be used to modify IPTeC 2 ̆ 7 s current website to improve upon its own model...|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was performed on}} characterisation of automotive shredder residue which resulted in application of its polymeric fraction {{as a substitute for}} coke, as reducing agent, in magnetite iron-ore composite pellets. In Australia aloan, nearly 200, 000 tonnes of automotive shredder residue is landfilled every year. This thesis aims to characterise this waste stream and come up with an idea to apply it in proper way and prevent it to go to the land. On the other hand iron making industry specifically blast furnace and its feed stock consumes a huge amount of worlds energy and resources. It was anticipated that shredder residues could be reused for its energy and composition aspect in iron making process. Samples were collected from an Australian shredder and were analysed for their composition and size distribution. Initial visual inspection confirmed the ASR as a very heterogeneous stream of waste and due to this heterogeneity application based on specific composition seemed to be out of prospect as it needs rigorous and costly separation processes. As result, the simple approach of size distribution, energy value and carbon content was considered as the bases for this study. It was realized that this waste consist of majorly high heat content materials with high carbon and hydrogen, metals and inorganics. The high energy <b>content</b> <b>portion</b> were analysed for their level of calorific value {{to come up with a}} representative range with purpose of nominating an effective re-application process. Charring process for analysis of carbon content was done based on standard ASTM E 1755 - 01. This was followed by burning the carbon content to derive the ash. Composition of ash was studied for oxide and element content using XRF. Calorific value analysis was done to determine the right fraction of ASR for the application of heat recovery and the source of carbon. These characterisations led to the understanding of the heat value and carbon content of each size fraction of ASR. This high heat and carbon content of the ASR were realised to be majorly due to the polymeric content. As result it was selected for further application. It was realised that the palletisation of iron oxide with this polymeric portion of ASR, as the source of carbon and energy, would be an attractive choice due to the versatility of palletisation process. Pellets were then made from concentrated magnetite provided by the OneSteel Whyalla. The source of carbon in the pellet was set to be 100 % metallurgical coke, 50 % ASR, 70 % ASR and 100 % ASR. The concentrated magnetite is the major source of iron-ore used in the OneSteels pellet plants. This magnetite was mixed with metallurgical coke, and flux, which basically is the milled limestone, before formed in to pellets and heat treated. These pellets are then fed into the blast furnace for iron extraction. Flux was not used in this project to minimise the effect of other oxides on the overall process. To make the pellets, the raw were mixed together and formed in to the ball-shape pellets and dried in 1050 C for 24 hrs in the oven. The reduction process was then performed in horizontal tube furnace in 12000 C under argon gas flow for 20 min. Various qualitative and quantitative analyses were performed to determine the level of reduction in pellets. Gas products were captured and in-situ infrared gas analyser was applied to measure the concentration of generated CO, CO 2 and CH 4 gases. The reduction was then calculated based on the weight reduction of the pellets by measuring the weight of pellets before and after process. Oxygen and carbon content of pellets were measured by means of LECO oxygen and carbon analyser to be compare with weight reduction and IR analyses. Analysis of reduced pellets was also performed physically and chemically with help of optical and electron microscopy (SEM-EDS) and XRD analysis. Compressive strength of pellets then was performed on two sets of pellets before and after high temperature reaction. The result for reduced pellets was compared with the standards pellets provided by OneSteel Whyalla blast furnace. This feasibility study has shown that there is possibility for the ASR to be used in the iron reduction process and specially blast furnace process application...|$|E
