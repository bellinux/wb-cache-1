5000|$|Another {{milestone}} {{in the development}} of the modern marshmallow was the extrusion process by the Greek American confectioner Alex Doumak in 1954. In this process, marshmallow mixture is pumped through extrusion heads with numerous ports aligned next to each other which form long continuous [...] "ropes" [...] of marshmallow. This invention allowed marshmallows to be manufactured in a fully automated way, and gives us the familiar cylindrical shape of today's marshmallow. In today's modern marshmallow processing plants, the following process may be used to make marshmallows in large quantities. In large industrial kettles, water, sugar, and corn syrup are heated to a precise temperature and cooked for a precise time. This mixture is then pumped to another kettle to cool. Re-hydrated gelatin is added and blended in, once the mixture has cooled enough to not denature the gelatin. To give the marshmallow its fluffiness, it is pumped through a blender while air is pumped into it. At this point, it still needs to be cooled down further, so it will hold its shape when extruded, it is pumped through a heat exchanger prior to being pumped through the extrusion heads and onto a wide conveyor belt. The conveyor belt is coated in corn starch and more corn starch is dusted onto the top of the marshmallow extrusion as it passes down the conveyor. A large knife the width of the conveyor is located at the end of this <b>conveyor</b> <b>table</b> that will then chop the extrusion into the size marshmallow desired. The pieces will then be tumbled in corn starch in a large drum, in order for the marshmallow to form its familiar skin and to allow pieces that did not get cut all the way to break apart.|$|E
40|$|Coffee {{consumers}} {{request a}} good quality of green coffee {{to get a}} good coffee cup taste. Defective beans e. g. black bean, brown bean and broken bean are associated to low coffee quality which give negative effects to final taste. To meet the standard export requirement, coffee beans have to be graded before being traded. Until now, grading process is generally carried out manually. The method gives better product, so the grading cost is very expensive about 40 % of total processing cost. Meanwhile, shortage of skill workers is a limiting factor of the process. Therefore, improving the manual sorting by providing machine for grading of green coffee is good alternative to reduce the grading cost. Indonesian Coffee and Cocoa Research Institute has designed a table conveyor type grading machine in order to improve the performance of the manual grading productivity and consistent quality and to reduce the grading cost. The conveyor belt has a dimension of 5700 mm of length, 610 mm of width and 6 mm of thickness. The rotating of belt conveyor powered by an electro motor 3 HP, 3 phase and 1420 rpm. The result showed that the optimum capacity of grading machine was 390 kg/hour reached when the speed 16 rpm and 3 kg/m 2 of green beans on belt conveyor with productivity 1870 kg/man-day compared to the productivity full manually process 743 kg/man-day. Percentage of product in outlet 1 was 4. 2 % as broken beans, 0. 26 % as brown beans, 0. 68 % as one hole in beans and 0. 61 % as more than one hole in beans. Percentage of product in outlet 2 was 39. 54 % as broken beans, 4. 23 % as brown beans 7. 19 % as black beans, 4. 47 % as one hole in beans and 4. 43 % as more than one hole in beans.

The present study investigated the diversity of L. monocytogenes in a Swiss sandwich-producing plant over a 12 -months period. L. monocytogenes were detected by culture after enrichment in 70 (3. 5 %) of 2028 environmental swabs and 16 (7. 4 %) of 217 samples from ingredients and sandwiches. Of the 86 L. monocytogenes strains, 93 % belonged to serotype 1 / 2 a and genetic lineage II. Rep PCR and PFGE analysis yielded each six profiles. Sixty-seven (77. 9 %) strains belonged to only one genotype, which was repeatedly found on/in slicers, <b>conveyor</b> belts, <b>tables,</b> a bread-feeding machine, spattles, air blow-guns, salmon, and egg sandwiches. Strains of this genotype persisted for more than 9 months in the processing environment, in particular on slicers and conveyor belts, which probably contributed to the contamination of sandwiches. After revision of the cleaning and disinfection procedures, L. monocytogenes were no longer found on slicers, conveyor belts, or in products. Besides, these results {{emphasize the importance of}} environmental monitoring schemes to identify potential contamination sources and as an early warning system for food business operators...|$|R

40|$|Ninety pig {{carcasses}} {{and twenty}} one food contact surfaces (FCSs) were tested for Salmonella in a slaughterhouse processing ca. 380 pigs/h between 2014 - 2015. Sampling was performed during seven sessions. Four carcass sites of 100 cm 2 each (back, belly, jowl externally, and the diaphragmatic area internally) were swabbed after evisceration. Meat <b>conveyors</b> and dressing <b>tables</b> were tested swabbing areas of 200 to 400 cm 2. After pre-enrichment in buffered peptone water, samples were tested by Salmonella MDS ® assay and the presumptive positives were {{confirmed by the}} ISO 6579 method. Salmonella isolates were serotyped following the Kauffman- White-Le Minor scheme and genotyped by XbaI pulsed field gel electrophoresis. Salmonella was isolated from 16 / 90 [17. 8 %; confidence interval (CI) 95 %= 11. 2 - 26. 9] carcasses and 4 / 21 (19. 0 %; CI 95 %= 7. 7 - 40. 0) FCSs. Four serovars were identified on carcasses. S. enterica 4,[5], 12 :i:- was the most prevalent (43. 75 %), followed by S. Rissen (31. 25 %), S. Derby (12. 5 %) and S. Bovismorbificans (12. 5 %). Two serovars were found on FCSs, namely S. Derby (75 %) and S. Livingstone (25 %). During one sampling session, a failure in carcass dehairing occurred and caused significantly higher prevalence of carcass contamination (60 %) than in the remaining sessions. Moreover, in the same session, Salmonella prevalence was marginally significantly higher on FCSs than in the remaining sampling days, suggesting that dehairing affects contamination not only on carcasses, {{but also on the}} working surfaces...|$|R
