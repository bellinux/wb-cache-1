5|$|Baccarat is a {{game for}} up to 20 players, {{together}} with a banker and croupier; several packs of cards are used, depending {{on the number of}} players. The value of the ace to nine cards are as their pip value, while tens and court cards <b>count</b> <b>as</b> zero. A player is dealt two cards and adds up the combined pips, discounting 10's and court cards, and only using the single digit value as a score - a King and a 6 will equal 16, but their value will be 6; two 8s will equal 16, and their value will also be 6. Two court cards will <b>count</b> <b>as</b> zero, or baccarat. The idea of the game is to get 9 points. A player may ask for one extra card to be added to their hand. Betting is between the player and the bank, with the closest to reach 9 on a hand receiving the stake.|$|E
5|$|Became {{the first}} player in history with more times on base (376) than {{official}} at-bats (373) in 2004. This {{was due to the}} record number of walks, which <b>count</b> <b>as</b> a time on base but not an at-bat. He had 135 hits, 232 walks, and 9 hit-by-pitches for the 376 number.|$|E
5000|$|For a commandment {{with both}} {{positive}} and negative components, the positive component <b>counts</b> <b>as</b> a positive instruction, while the negative component <b>counts</b> <b>as</b> a negative prohibition. For example, the Torah commands to rest on the Sabbath and forbids against doing work on that day. Resting <b>counts</b> <b>as</b> a positive instruction, and working <b>counts</b> <b>as</b> a negative prohibition.|$|R
5000|$|Win% → Every draw <b>counted</b> <b>as</b> a half win. Wins on penalty shootouts are <b>counted</b> <b>as</b> draws.|$|R
5000|$|Take the card's {{face value}} (with aces <b>counting</b> <b>as</b> 1 and royal cards <b>counting</b> <b>as</b> 11, 12 and 13 respectively) ...|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, the Norman nobility {{gathered}} at Le Neubourg to discuss declaring Theobald king, probably following {{the news that}} Stephen was gathering support in England. The Normans argued that the <b>count,</b> <b>as</b> the eldest grandson of William the Conqueror, had the most valid claim over the kingdom and the duchy, and was certainly preferable to Matilda.|$|E
5|$|On September 26, 2017, Twitter {{announced}} it was testing 280-character limit tweets. The 280-character limit went live for all users on November 7. Certain characters, including CJK, emoji and most Unicode symbols, <b>count</b> <b>as</b> two characters under the new limit.|$|E
5|$|Up to 2 hours {{either side}} of a sleeper-berth period while in the {{passenger}} seat will <b>count</b> <b>as</b> off-duty. Drivers inside a parked CMV who are not in the sleeper berth must log it as on-duty.|$|E
25|$|In some formats of the game, {{hitting a}} 'six' <b>counts</b> <b>as</b> 10 runs, and {{striking}} a 'four' <b>counts</b> <b>as</b> six runs.|$|R
50|$|In 1883, {{points were}} {{introduced}} to football, and a touchdown <b>counted</b> <b>as</b> four points. A goal after a touchdown also <b>counted</b> <b>as</b> four points.|$|R
50|$|Any worker {{worked at}} {{flexible}} rest day shall {{be treated as}} overtime, Any overtime under four hours shall be <b>counted</b> <b>as</b> four hours, more than four to eight hours of overtime shall be <b>counted</b> <b>as</b> eight, and more than eight to 12 hours , the maximum, of overtime shall be <b>counted</b> <b>as</b> 12 hours.|$|R
5|$|A. ^ General Motors, {{the owner}} of the Detroit Marriott at the Renaissance Center, {{maintains}} that the building has 73 floors. Hines Interests, the property management firm for the building, gives a floor count of 74, while architect Skidmore, Owings and Merrill gives a floor count of 75. Emporis and other building database sites usually give the floor <b>count</b> <b>as</b> 70, while other sources state 73 stories. This table uses the floor count of 73 as stated officially by the building's owner.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the news}} that Stephen was {{gathering}} support in England, the Norman nobility had gathered at Le Neubourg to discuss declaring his elder brother Theobald king. The Normans argued that the <b>count,</b> <b>as</b> the eldest grandson of William the Conqueror, had the most valid claim over the kingdom and the Duchy, and was certainly preferable to Matilda. Their discussions were interrupted by the sudden news from England that Stephen's coronation was to occur the next day. Theobald's support immediately ebbed away, as the barons were not prepared to support the division of England and Normandy by opposing Stephen.|$|E
5|$|From the league's {{founding}} in 1920 until 1932, {{there was no}} scheduled championship game. From 1920–1923, the championship was awarded to a team {{by a vote of}} team owners at the annual owners' meeting. From 1924–1932, the team having the best winning percentage was awarded the championship. As each team played a different number of games, simply counting wins and losses would have been insufficient. Additionally, tie games were not counted in the standings in figuring winning percentage (under modern rules, ties <b>count</b> <b>as</b> ½ win and ½ loss).|$|E
5000|$|For first- and second-declension nouns, {{the rule}} is more complex. The {{thematic}} vowel ( [...] or [...] ) <b>counts</b> <b>as</b> neither stem nor ending, but alternates between the two depending on which accent is considered. For post-stem accent, it <b>counts</b> <b>as</b> part of the ending; for pre-ending accent, it <b>counts</b> <b>as</b> part of the stem.|$|R
50|$|Per {{statistical}} {{convention in}} football, matches decided in extra time are <b>counted</b> <b>as</b> wins and losses, while matches decided by penalty shoot-out are <b>counted</b> <b>as</b> draws.|$|R
50|$|The {{other three}} symbols {{are used in}} challenges. When the sword is rolled on any die it <b>counts</b> <b>as</b> a point of support. The shield <b>counts</b> <b>as</b> {{opposition}} and the skull <b>counts</b> <b>as</b> damage. In a challenge, if you initiated the challenge, {{you are looking for}} swords, if you are opposing it then you want shields.|$|R
5|$|Hyperuricemia is {{a classic}} feature of gout, but {{nearly half of the}} time gout occurs without hyperuricemia and most people with raised uric acid levels never develop gout. Thus, the {{diagnostic}} utility of measuring uric acid levels is limited. Hyperuricemia is defined as a plasma urate level greater than 420 μmol/l (7.0mg/dl) in males and 360 μmol/l (6.0mg/dl) in females. Other blood tests commonly performed are white blood cell count, electrolytes, kidney function and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). However, both the white blood cells and ESR may be elevated due to gout in the absence of infection. A white blood cell <b>count</b> <b>as</b> high as 40.0×109/l (40,000/mm3) has been documented.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, {{students}} from the Art Institute of Portland used stencils to advertise a concert for the Oregon Food Bank. The students believed they were using spray chalk, but after completion, they learned they were actually using spray paint. The students were told that even temporary markings <b>count</b> <b>as</b> graffiti, and the students offered to remove the paint and apologize to businesses affected. Criminal charges were not filed.|$|E
5|$|In a fatal attack, however, it manifests very quickly. In {{a number}} of cases, death has {{occurred}} within 24 hours of {{the onset of the}} infection, while other cases do not last longer than around five days. The virus attacks endothelial cells, rupturing capillaries and causing blood loss and haemorrhaging; once this reaches the heart, the haemorrhage kills quickly through shock. Symptoms include lethargy and an unwillingness to eat, a rapid heartbeat, and decreased blood-cell <b>count,</b> <b>as</b> well as cyanosis of the tongue, mouth ulcers, and oedema of the head and trunk.|$|E
25|$|As per {{statistical}} {{convention in}} football, matches decided in extra time are <b>counted</b> <b>as</b> wins and losses, while matches decided by penalty shoot-outs are <b>counted</b> <b>as</b> draws.|$|R
50|$|Until and {{including}} the 1988 Summer Olympics, Olympic games <b>counted</b> <b>as</b> regular senior national team matches. Since the 1992 Summer Olympics, Olympic games have <b>counted</b> <b>as</b> under-21 national games.|$|R
50|$|Adopters of NLTC {{should note}} that all {{singleton}}s, except singleton A, are <b>counted</b> <b>as</b> three half-losers (1.5 losers), and all doubletons that are missing both the A and K are <b>counted</b> <b>as</b> five half-losers (2.5 losers). Like basic LTC, no suit contains more than three losers, so with NLTC, three small cards in a suit are <b>counted</b> <b>as</b> six half-losers (3.0 losers).|$|R
5|$|In {{baseball}} statistics tie-breakers <b>count</b> <b>as</b> {{regular season}} games, with all events in them added to regular season statistics. For example, Mike Piazza grounded into his 27th double {{play of the}} season in the 9th inning, adding to his league-leading total. Similarly, Leiter's performance advanced his position on several 1999 statistical leaderboards including shutouts and walks issued. Reese, Ventura, and Ordóñez won Rawlings Gold Glove Awards for the season while Piazza and Alfonzo won Silver Sluggers. Robin Ventura also finished sixth in Most Valuable Player voting, with Chipper Jones taking the award.|$|E
5|$|Numerous senior central {{bankers and}} finance ministers issued public warnings, the first being Alexei Ulyukayev, the first deputy {{chairman}} at Russia's central bank. He was later joined by many others including Park Jae-wan, the finance minister for South Korea, and by Jens Weidmann, {{president of the}} Bundesbank. Weidmann held the view that interventions during the 2009–11 period were not intense enough to <b>count</b> <b>as</b> competitive devaluation, but that a genuine currency war is now a real possibility. Japan's economy minister Akira Amari {{has said that the}} Bank of Japan's bond buying programme is intended to combat deflation, and not to weaken the yen.|$|E
5|$|On U.S. Navy vessels, even-numbered {{compartments}} {{are found}} on the port side, but zero is reserved for compartments that intersect the centerline. That is, the numbers read 6-4-2-0-1-3-5 from port to starboard. In the game of roulette, the number 0 does not <b>count</b> <b>as</b> even or odd, giving the casino an advantage on such bets. Similarly, the parity of zero can affect payoffs in prop bets when the outcome depends on whether some randomized number is odd or even, {{and it turns out}} to be zero.|$|E
50|$|Vertical columns are {{evaluated}} {{in the same}} way. If there is a row of 2n or 2n+1 boxes, it <b>counts</b> <b>as</b> −n. A column of such size <b>counts</b> <b>as</b> +n.|$|R
5000|$|Instead of a catch <b>counting</b> <b>as</b> an out, it is {{sometimes}} <b>counted</b> <b>as</b> a point against the kicking team's score, decreasing the score by however many pop-fly catches are made.|$|R
50|$|In {{the census}} from 1881 to 1960, all Muslims are <b>counted</b> <b>as</b> Turks, only Greek Orthodox are <b>counted</b> <b>as</b> Greeks. There were small populations of Greek-speaking Muslims and Turkish-speaking Greek Orthodox.|$|R
5|$|Rather {{than simply}} quell the mutiny however, Germanicus rallied the mutineers {{and led them}} on a short {{campaign}} across the Rhine into Germanic territory, stating that whatever treasure they could grab would <b>count</b> <b>as</b> their bonus. Germanicus's forces crossed the Rhine and quickly occupied all of the territory between the Rhine and the Elbe. Additionally, Tacitus records the capture of the Teutoburg forest and the reclaiming of Roman standards lost years before by Publius Quinctilius Varus, when three Roman legions and its auxiliary cohorts had been ambushed by Germanic tribes.|$|E
5|$|The Mayo Clinic and the University of Minnesota sued {{in federal}} court to {{overturn}} those regulations. The district courts agreed with them, but upon appeal, the Eighth Circuit consolidated the two cases into one and reversed the judgments, remanding the cases for entry of judgments {{in favor of the}} United States. This decision was at odds with decisions from the Second, Sixth, Seventh, and Eleventh Circuits, which had all previously ruled that residents may <b>count</b> <b>as</b> students for the purpose of FICA taxes. The Eighth Circuit's ruling created a circuit split, and on appeal, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case.|$|E
5|$|Triadic joint {{attention}} {{is the highest}} level of joint attention and involves two individuals looking at an object. Each individual must understand that the other individual is looking at the same object and realize that {{there is an element of}} shared attention. For an instance of social engagement to <b>count</b> <b>as</b> triadic joint attention it requires at least two individuals attending to an object or focusing their attention on each other. Additionally, the individual must display awareness that focus is shared between himself or herself and another individual. Triadic {{attention is}} marked by the individual looking back to the other individual after looking at the object.|$|E
50|$|If all {{ballots are}} <b>counted</b> <b>as</b> cast and cast as intended, then all ballots are <b>counted</b> <b>as</b> intended. Therefore, the {{integrity}} of the election can be proven to a very high probability.|$|R
50|$|On a few {{occasions}} {{the game was}} played {{as part of a}} 'double header', also counting for the East of Scotland Shield. In May 1919 the 2nd leg of the Shield <b>counted</b> <b>as</b> the Wilson Cup final replay. In May 1920 the Shield replay <b>counted</b> <b>as</b> the final of the Wilson Cup and in 1921 it <b>counted</b> <b>as</b> the semi-final of the Shield as well.|$|R
40|$|This paper revisits {{the thesis}} of a 1980 paper that {{suggested}} {{a new approach to}} educational administration based upon the New Sociology of Education. In particular it updates answers to the six key questions asked by that paper: what <b>counts</b> <b>as</b> knowledge; how is what <b>counts</b> <b>as</b> knowledge organised; how is what <b>counts</b> <b>as</b> knowledge transmitted; how is access to what <b>counts</b> <b>as</b> knowledge determined; what are the processes of control; what ideological appeals justify the system. These questions were foundational {{in the development of a}} socially critical perspective and a cultural approach to educational leadership and administration...|$|R
