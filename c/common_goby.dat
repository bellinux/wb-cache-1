40|$|Sediments, mudskippers, and <b>common</b> <b>gobies</b> were {{collected}} from the estuaries of nine rivers {{along the coast of}} the Ariake Sea in the northwestern part of Kyushu. The sediments were analyzed for alkylphenols, organotin compounds, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Then, male mudskippers and <b>common</b> <b>gobies</b> were analyzed for serum vitellogenin concentration. Sediments from the estuary of the Omuta River, which has residential areas in its upper reaches and many large-scale chemical plants in its lower reaches, exhibited higher concentrations of these three types of chemicals than the other rivers, and male mudskippers caught in the Omuta River exhibited higher serum vitellogenin concentrations than mudskippers caught in other rivers. One chemical substance thought to be responsible for these elevated vitellogenin concentrations is nonylphenol, a type of alkylphenol. Male <b>common</b> <b>gobies</b> caught in the Suwa River exhibited higher vitellogenin concentrations than <b>common</b> <b>gobies</b> caught in other rivers. Although the Suwa River had high polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon concentrations, the elevated vitellogenin concentrations of these male <b>common</b> <b>gobies</b> were thought to be attributable to factors such as sewage treatment plants, not polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. However, organotin compounds were detected in all estuarine sediments. This was attributed {{to the fact that the}} Ariake Sea is a good area for fishing and a number of small fishing vessels anchor and operate in the estuaries of all these rivers.

40|$|The brown shrimp Crangon crangon migrates {{into the}} {{brackish}} {{part of the}} Westerschelde estuary (southwest Netherlands) shortly after metamorphosis and uses the tidal marsh habitat as a nursery until reaching a total length of about 15 mm. The importance of the marsh as a nursery was evaluated by estimating foraging activity, predation mortality and residence time. In early postlarval stages, C. crangon utilised the intertidal creeks of an estuarine tidal marsh from (March-April) until late autumn (October-November). Postlarval shrimp leaving the marsh with the ebb tide always had significantly more food in their stomachs than shrimp entering the marsh with the incoming flood water. Predation upon the shrimp population was relatively low during most months, but it increased between August and October when <b>common</b> <b>gobies,</b> Pomatoschistus microps, were present in high densities. There was also predation by the small seabass Dicentrarchus labrax. The marsh creeks function both as foraging areas and as predation refuge. Depending on temperature, postlarval shrimp stayed in the marsh {{for a period of}} two to three weeks. Quantitatively, the value of the marsh as a nursery area had changed drastically during a second year of sampling, illustrating high natural year-to-year variability. However, the seasonal pattern remained. Recruitment to the subtidal adult population represents an export of animals from the marsh to the estuary. This export is negligible in terms of biomass (as compared to the total biomass of the estuarine population) but it may be important in terms of numbers of individuals...|$|R

The density of P. microps and potential hyperbenthic prey {{species in the}} marsh creek, fullness index, evacuation rates and daily ration of <b>common</b> <b>goby</b> were calculated. Mesopodopsis slabberi, Neomysis integer and Corophium volutator were the most dominant prey items in terms of biomass. Numerically, copepods dominated the diet. Migrating fish enter the marsh creek with a relatively empty stomach and leave the marsh with a higher stomach content.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} {{reproductive}} dynamics, behaviour and selection from a female perspective. The {{aim was to}} explore variation in sex roles and potential for selection on females, {{as well as the}} selective forces working on females, within a sexual selection framework. One subject that has received particular interest in this thesis is environmental influence on reproductive behaviour and sex roles and how this affects selection on females. In a field study on <b>common</b> <b>gobies</b> (Pomatoschistus microps) availability of nest sites seemed to affect which sex was courting (Paper I). When nests were abundant males courted and competed over matings, whereas when nests were scarce males competed over nest sites, while females courted and competed over matings. In the two-spotted goby (Gobiusculus flavescens), female reproductive behaviour was influenced by male availability (Paper II). In our population, the change in male availability was caused by a decline in the operational sex ratio (OSR) as the season progressed. Thus, early in the season males were abundant and also the courting sex, whereas late in the season few males were around and females were courting the few males available. The shift in the OSR over the season potentially affects the opportunity for females to be choosy. This could occur because of a reduced number of males available, but also because males may become choosy when the sex ratio is female biased. Females might be expected to adjust their choosiness to fit the current potential for mate choice. As expected, when given a choice between two males varying in size in a laboratory study, female two-spotted gobies preferred large males early in the season but reduced their choosiness for male size later on in the season (Paper III). Selection on females should also be affected by male behaviour, such as male mate choice. Male two-spotted gobies were found to slightly prefer larger females in a two-choice study performed from mid to end of the season (Paper IV). Therefore, male choice should produce only a minor selection pressure on female size in this species. Depending on ecological circumstances females are expected to interact and compete with each other to a lesser or higher degree. To test the effect of female-female interactions on female resource allocation to reproduction and growth, female guppies (Poecilia reticulata) were held in different competitive situations (either alone, with large, or small competitors). There was no effect of treatment on growth, however females in the competitive treatments produced fewer mature eggs than females held alone in spite of ad lib. food levels (Paper V). It therefore seems as if female guppies spend resources on interactions with other females and as if this negatively affects female reproductive success. This thesis illustrates that there are several selection forces working on females within sexual selection. Sex roles and behaviours in relation to reproduction show adaptive plasticity in response to environmental factors. The OSR can be linked to environmental conditions and sex roles, however the usefulness of OSR for predicting sex roles is questioned. Life history aspects are important for reproductive behaviour and fitness and should be taken into account when studying sexual selection. Since sex roles are flexible within a system, the distinction between conventional and reversed sex roles may be misleading. Furthermore, studying selection processes and consequences on both sexes provides a fuller understanding of sexual selection, sex roles and mating patterns. dr. scient. dr. scient...|$|R
40|$|Chaeturichithys hexanema Bleeker {{is widely}} {{distributed}} in Japan, Korea, and Southern China. It {{is one of}} the <b>common</b> sea <b>gobies</b> in Japan throughout. It lives the bottom-life on the sandy mud-bottom of the coastal water of some 5 ～ 50 meters deep. It is caught mainly by the small trawl-net all the year round (Fig. 1). The spawning season seems to extend from February to May in Kyushu and Seto Island Sea. The fertilized egg by artificial insemination is ellipsoid, 2. 9 mm in long axis and 0. 8 mm in short axis; and has adhesive filaments at its basal end. The incubation-period is about 10 * 1 / 2 days at the temperature 14 ～ 17 ℃ (Fig. 2). The number of the ovarian eggs is given in Table 1 (1, 731 ～ 19, 258). The newly hatched larva is 4. 2 mm in total length; and the yolk is absorbed in 7 days. The larvae, 10. 8 ～ 24. 0 mm in total length, live a pelagic life in the coastal water where the adult fish live, feeding on planktonic copepods. The juveniles, over 21 mm in total length, are found to carry the bottom-life. They appear from May to June in Fukuoka Bay, Kyushu (Fig. 3). The goby attains about 135 mm in total length in one year and becomes mature. In two years, it attains the length of 155 mm.

Individuals of each site were genotyped for eight microsatellite loci and levels of genetic diversity and differentiation were correlated to present-day estuarine characteristics and historical events. A general ecological state for each sampling site was obtained from a principal component analysis (PCA) applied to estuarine geomorphologic characteristics and levels of heavy metals and total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons contamination. Genetic diversity was higher than that previously reported for <b>common</b> <b>goby</b> in the Atlantic and Mediterranean. F-ST were generally very low (0. 000 - 0. 049), as well as Nei's genetic distances (0. 000 - 0. 167), although the later were statistically significant. Estuarine geomorphology and heavy metal contamination contributed the most to estuarine ecological differentiation but no trend was detected {{in the relationship between}} these characteristics and samples' genetic diversity.

However the resident assemblages associated with sand and the factors affecting their distribution and abundance are poorly understood. Here we examine spatial co-variation in {{the abundance of}} burrowing goby assemblages and habitat characteristics in the lagoon at Lizard Island (Great Barrier Reef). The aim was to identify which key habitat-variables should be incorporated into models to predict the structure of sand-dwelling fish communities. We focused on 10 <b>common</b> sand <b>goby</b> species from 7 genera: Amblyeleotris, Cryptocentrus, Ctenogobiops and Vanderhorstia (associated with burrows constructed by alpheid shrimps), and Amblygobius, Oplopomus and Valenciennea (free-living, burrowing species). Spatial patterns were examined by stratifying the lagoon into 6 recognizable habitat zones, and conducting visual transects in replicate sites within each zone. The abundance of all goby species encountered and habitat variables (depth, distance from reef, topography, disturbance of different types, sediment composition) were recorded in each transect. Habitat characteristics and fish abundance, diversity and species composition differed markedly among habitat types and sites within habitats. There was a strong association between sites grouped according to habitat characteristics and goby assemblage. These changes reflected species-specific responses to different combinations of habitat variables and their interactions.

An international workshop, held at the Hel Marine Station, Poland, was organized to summarize population features of the round <b>goby.</b> <b>Common</b> fish predators of round gobies in the Great Lakes and in native regions are obligate and facultative benthic fishes and occasionally, pelagic fishes. In contrast, the main predator of the round goby in the Gulf of Gdansk is the Great Cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo). In the Great Lakes, round gobies have lead to the decline of mottled sculpin (Cottus bairdi) and logperch (Percina caprodes) and reduced the hatching success of native fishes by feeding on their eggs. In the Gulf of Gdansk, round gobies have increased in abundance, while three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) have declined. Round gobies have a broad diet throughout their range; larger specimens are molluscivores. There are fewer species of parasites and lower infection rates of round gobies in recently colonized areas than in native areas.

Species Description Round gobies have a soft body and a large round head with thick lips and distinctive frog-like raised eyes. They can reach up to 10 inches in length as adults, but are usually less than seven inches in the Great Lakes. Females and immature males are a solid slate gray mottled with black and brown spots. Spawning males turn almost solid black. Two distinguishing characteristics of round gobies are a single, scallop-shaped pelvic fin and a distinctive black spot located on the dorsal fin. Round gobies closely resemble the native mottled sculpin, but the two species can be easily separated by looking at the pelvic fins. The sculpin has two separated pelvic fins compared to the single, fused pelvic fin found on the round goby. The sculpin also lacks the large black spot found on the dorsal fin of the round goby. Native & Introduced Ranges Round gobies are native to Eurasia in the Black, Caspian, and Azov seas, and tributaries. They were first discovered in the St. Clair River in 1990, presumably released during ballast water exchanges of transoceanic ships.

The Minho estuary (NW Portugal) {{is a relatively}} wellpreserved and productive system. To assess the population structure and production of P. microps in this estuary, monthly samples were undertaken in three different areas along an estuarine gradient in the lower estuary. The density of P. microps varied considerably among seasons and sampling stations, with higher densities occurring in summer and autumn. The lowest densities were found closer to the sea. In general, the density of females was higher than the density of males in all sampling stations, while juveniles were more abundant within a salt marsh area. Compared with other European estuaries, our data showed a remarkable higher density and production values of P. microps. This {{may be related to}} the high freshwater input and the low salinities found in this estuary. In addition, we hypothesize that the lower density of the sympatric species P. minutus and the high availability of bivalve shells observed in the Minho estuary may have also contributed to the present results, once P. minutus and P. microps often display a diet overlap and the bivalve shells are crucial for the <b>common</b> <b>goby</b> reproduction.

Information on the densities and spatial and temporal variations of these stages, as well as on their lengths at the moment of occurrence, can be an important contribution to the knowledge of their dispersion, migrations and to the identification of possible bottlenecks in their recruitment. Therefore the hyperbenthos of the Voordelta, a shallow coastal zone in front of the Dutch Delta, as well as that of the subtidal channels and the intertidal brackish marsh creeks of the Westerschelde Estuary, was sampled monthly during one year by means of a sledge and a stow net.

40|$|Visual {{pigments}} {{of different}} animal species must have evolved at some stage {{to match the}} prevailing light environments, since all visual functions depend {{on their ability to}} absorb available photons and transduce the event into a reliable neural signal. There is a large literature on correlation between the light environment and spectral sensitivity between different fish species. However, little work has been done on evolutionary adaptation between separated populations within species. More generally, {{little is known about the}} rate of evolutionary adaptation to changing spectral environments. The objective of this thesis is to illuminate the constraints under which the evolutionary tuning of visual pigments works as evident in: scope, tempo, available molecular routes, and signal/noise trade-offs. Aquatic environments offer Nature s own laboratories for research on visual pigment properties, as naturally occurring light environments offer an enormous range of variation in both spectral composition and intensity. The present thesis focuses on the visual pigments that serve dim-light vision in two groups of model species, teleost fishes and mysid crustaceans. The geographical emphasis is in the brackish Baltic Sea area with its well-known postglacial isolation history and its aquatic fauna of both marine and fresh-water origin. The absorbance spectrum of the (single) dim-light visual pigment were recorded by microspectrophotometry (MSP) in single rods of 26 fish species and single rhabdoms of 8 opossum shrimp populations of the genus Mysis inhabiting marine, brackish or freshwater environments. Additionally, spectral sensitivity was determined from six Mysis populations by electroretinogram (ERG) recording. The rod opsin gene was sequenced in individuals of four allopatric populations of the sand goby (Pomatoschistus minutus). Rod opsins of two other goby species were investigated as outgroups for comparison. Rod absorbance spectra of the Baltic subspecies or populations of the primarily marine species herring (Clupea harengus membras), sand goby (P. minutus), and flounder (Platichthys flesus) were long-wavelength-shifted compared to their marine populations. The spectral shifts are consistent with adaptation for improved quantum catch (QC) as well as improved signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of vision in the Baltic light environment. Since the chromophore of the pigment was pure A 1 in all cases, this has apparently been achieved by evolutionary tuning of the opsin visual pigment. By contrast, no opsin-based differences were evident between lake and sea populations of species of fresh-water origin, which can tune their pigment by varying chromophore ratios. A more detailed analysis of differences in absorbance spectra and opsin sequence between and within populations was conducted using the sand goby as model species. Four allopatric populations from the Baltic Sea (B), Swedish west coast (S), English Channel (E), and Adriatic Sea (A) were examined. Rod absorbance spectra, characterized by the wavelength of maximum absorbance (λmax), differed between populations and correlated with differences in the spectral light transmission of the respective water bodies. The greatest λmax shift as well as the greatest opsin sequence difference was between the Baltic and the Adriatic populations. The significant within-population variation of the Baltic λmax values (506 - 511 nm) was analyzed on the level of individuals and was shown to correlate well with opsin sequence substitutions. The sequences of individuals with λmax at shorter wavelengths were identical to that of the Swedish population, whereas those with λmax at longer wavelengths additionally had substitution F 261 F/Y in the sixth transmembrane helix of the protein. This substitution (Y 261) was also present in the Baltic <b>common</b> <b>gobies</b> and is known to redshift spectra. The tuning mechanism of the long-wavelength type Baltic sand gobies is assumed to be the co-expression of F 261 and Y 261 in all rods to produce ≈ 5 nm redshift. The polymorphism of the Baltic sand goby population possibly indicates ambiguous selection pressures in the Baltic Sea. The visual pigments of all lake populations of the opossum shrimp (Mysis relicta) were red-shifted by 25 nm compared with all Baltic Sea populations. This is calculated to confer a significant advantage in both QC and SNR in many humus-rich lakes with reddish water. Since only A 2 chromophore was present, the differences obviously reflect evolutionary tuning of the visual protein, the opsin. The changes have occurred within the ca. 9000 years that the lakes have been isolated from the Sea after the most recent glaciation. At present, it seems that the mechanism explaining the spectral differences between lake and sea populations is not an amino acid substitution at any other conventional tuning site, but the mechanism is yet to be found. Viimeisten vuosikymmenten aikana näön ekologista tutkimusta on tehty vertailemalla eri lajeja ja niiden elinympäristöjä. Nyt valmistuneessa tutkimuksessa valoympäristön vaikutusta näköpigmentin evolutiiviseen säätymiseen tarkasteltiin uudella tavalla. Tutkimukseen valittiin saman kala- ja katkalajin erilaisissa valoympäristöissä eläviä populaatioita. Työssä keskityttiin valoympäristön vaikutuksen arviointiin pimeänäön pigmenttimolekyyli, rodopsiinin osalta: sen aminohapporakenteeseen ja spektraaliherkkyyteen eli siihen mitä aallonpituuksia pigmenttimolekyyli vastaanottaa. Samalla arvioitiin evolutiivisten muutosten nopeutta, jos eläimen valoympäristö muuttuu. Tutkimusympäristöksi valittiin Itämeri, jonka jääkausiin liittyvät kehitysvaiheet ja eläinlajiston muuttohistoria tunnetaan tarkasti. Menetelminä käytettiin 1) mikrospektrofotometriaa näköpigmenttien spektraaliherkkyyden mittaamiseksi ja 2) sekvensointia näköpigmentin aminohapporakenteen selvittämiseksi. Tutkimuksen kalamallilajina käytettiin hietatokkoa ja sen neljää Euroopan rannikolla esiintyvää populaatiota. Populaatioiden välillä havaittiin pieniä, mutta merkityksellisiä eroja spektraaliherkkyysarvossa ja rodopsiiniproteiinin aminohapporakenteessa. Tulokset voidaan selittää hyvin valoympäristön erojen perusteella. Lisäksi havaittiin, että Itämeren hietatokkopopulaatio koostui kahdesta pienemmästä alapopulaatiosta, joilla näön spektraaliherkkyys ja proteiinin aminohapporakenne erosivat toisistaan. Ilmeisesti Itämeren vaihtelevat elinolosuhteet ylläpitävät Itämeren hietatokkopopulaation kahtiajakautumista. Toisella mallilajilla, Mysis jäännehalkoisjalkaisella, havaittiin myös valoympäristöön sopeutumista. Mysiksen järvipopulaation spektraaliherkkyys oli selvästi erilaiselle aallonpituusalueelle kuin Itämeressä elävällä populaatiolla vastaten siten paremmin järven valoympäristöä. Tutkimukseen liittyi myös 22 Itämeressä esiintyvän kalalajin spektraaliherkkyysmittaukset. Näiltä lajeilta mitattiin lisäksi niiden järvessä tai meressä elävän populaation spektraaliherkkyysarvo, jotta valoympäristöön sopeutumista voitiin arvioida. Tutkituista lajeista hietatokon, silakan ja kampelan näköpigmentit ovat sopeutuneet Itämeren valaistusolosuhteisiin. Sen sijaan järvien erilaisin valoympäristöihin sopeutumista ei havaittu. Meriympäristöstä kotoisin olevilla lajeilla muutos on todennäköisesti tapahtunut rodopsiiniproteiinin aminohappojärjestyksessä. Muutokset näköpigmenttimolekyylin rakenteessa ovat olleet nopeita. Ne ovat todennäköisesti tapahtuneet viimeisten 9000 vuoden kuluessa, edellisen jääkauden jälkeen...|$|R
40|$|Chaenogobius urotaenia (Hilgendorf) is a {{small and}} {{polymorphic}} <b>goby,</b> <b>common</b> in the rivers or lakes of Japan; and is distributed also in Korea, Manchuria, Siberia, and Sanghalien (Fig. 1). The spawning-season seems to extend from January to May {{in the vicinity of}} Fukuoka city, Kyushu. During this season, a kind of the nuptial coloration appears in the mature female fish on its head, anal fin, and ventral fin. The number of the stones on the river-bed in rapid stream. The male parent fish was obscrved to stay in the room until the eggs hatch, while the female leave there soon after spawning. The spawned eggs were attached, in one layer, to the under surface of the stone. The number of the eggs of one spawn was 1, 219 ～ 1, 421. The spawned egg is ellipsoid in shape, about 3. 0 mm in length, and 1. 0 mm in width, demersal and adhesive with a bundle of adhesive filaments at its basal end (Fig. 2 and Fig. 3). The incubation-period is about 14 days at the tenperature about 15 ℃. The newly hatched larva was 4. 1 mm in total length, with large melanophores on its body-sides; and its yolk was consumed in 7 days. The hatched larva seems to descend into the sea with the flowing water, and spend a few months in the coastal water, carrying a pelagic life. They feed on pelagic copepods and amphipods. The larvae, about 25 mm in total length, were found to ascend the river in shoals. Soon they enter into bottom-life in the river. This goby grows to 55 ～ 73 mm in total length in one year, when some of them become mature. The life-span seems to be over three years. ウキゴリについては富山一郎(1936) が Chaenogobius macrognathus (Bleeker), Aboma urotaenia (Hilgendorf), Chloea dino Schmidt, Chaenogobius isaza Tanaka (和名イサザ) をすべて Gobius urotaenia Hilgendorf の Synonym として, それに Chaenogobius annularis urotaenia (Hilgendorf) という亜種名を考え, ビリンゴ Chaenogobius annularis annularis (Gill) と共に同一種類に属する 2 亜種としている. 高木和徳(1952) はウキゴリ, ビリンゴ及びイサザの形態について詳細な比較研究を行い, これ等がそれぞれ別個の種類である事を明らかにし, Chaenogobius urotaenia (Hilgendorf) に和名のウキゴリを当てている. ここでは富山, 高木両氏の説を参考して種別を定め, 主として九州各地で得た材料によつてウキゴリの生活史の大要を述べる. 本研究に当り懇切な御指導と原稿の御校閲を頂いた内田恵太郎教授に感謝の意を表すると共に, 長野県諏訪湖の標本を頂いた水産庁淡水区水産研究所の白石芳一技官, 琵琶湖の標本を頂いた滋賀県水産試験場の小林茂雄技師に心から御礼申し上げる...|$|R
40|$|Between 2006 and 2012 {{researchers}} of the Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO) performed several fish {{surveys in}} the Lippenbroek. This is a reduced flood controlled tidal area along the River Zeeschelde nearby Hamme. The ten acre {{area has been}} active since March 2006 with water entering and leaving the area daily. The reduction of the tide allowed the development of different habitat types {{and the creation of}} mud flats and marshes. We selected three types of habitats: the reservoir situated at the sluices an adjacent creek and a permanently flooded pool. Fish techniques used were electric fishing and fyke netting. In total 20 fish species were caught. With fykes we captured 16 species in the creek and 17 in the reservoir. With electric fishing 8 species were caught in the creek, 11 in the reservoir and 17 in the pool. Over the years smelt, <b>common</b> <b>goby,</b> flounder and roach dominated in numbers the fyke net catches in the creek. In the reservoir roach, Prussian carp and stone moroko were dominant. With electric fishing the most abundant species were stone moroko and flounder in the creek while in the other habitats threespined stickleback and stone moroko were the most abundant species. Statistical analysis with fyke net data showed that the species composition changed over the years in both the creek and reservoir. However, there was no indication of different fish composition in the two habitats. In addition, no seasonal patterns could be found. The statistical analysis with fish data from the pool revealed again a change in fish composition over the years. Although flounder and <b>common</b> <b>goby</b> disappeared from this habitat, an increase in species and individuals caught was apparent. No seasonal pattern could be seen. The length frequency distribution indicated that Prussian carp, stone moroko and roach spawn in theLippenbroek. Prussian carp larvae occur mainly in the pool while the other larvae are found especially in the creek and reservoir. These species also use the Lippenbroek as a nursery. Perch uses the creek and reservoir as a nursery while larger species are captured in the pool. Diadromous species as flounder and smelt use the area as a nursery. Juvenile smelt occurs especially in the creek. Flounder migrated from the pool to the creek and reservoir. The <b>common</b> <b>goby,</b> a typical estuarine species, also disappeared from the pool and uses now mainly the creek as a nursery and permanent residence. Seabass is a marine species using the Lippenbroek as a nursery ground. The smallest individuals are found in the creek. The larger specimens occur in the reservoir. In the pool we also caught some seabass. Pikeperch is foraging in the reservoir; the smaller individuals are growing up in the creek. This species is not captured in the pool. The habitat diversity influences the fish diversity. E. g. less frequently caught species such as white bream and carp were captured mainly in the creek. Pumpkinseed and rudd were caught especially in the pool. Bream and eel occur mainly in the reservoir while bitterling has no apparent habitat preference as it was captured regularly in all habitat types...|$|E

The haptoral hard parts {{are among the}} smallest described for species of Gyrodactylus. A presumed similarity between the new species and G. harengi Malmberg, 1957 (subgenus Metanephrotus Malmberg, 1964) encouraged a comparative approach. A morphological analysis showed the marginal hook sickles of G. ostendicus to be of quite a different type and {{similar to those of}} G. arcuatus Bychowsky sensu Bychowsky & Poljansky (1953) (subgenus Mesonephrotus Malmberg, 1964). The new species bas a pharynx with short pharyngeal processes. Its protonephridial system bas small bladders, indicating an association with the subgenera Mesonephrotus or Metanephrotus. Molecular phylogenetic analyses, including all of the species of Mesonephrotus and Metanephrotus currently available on the GenBank database, suggested that the new species belongs to Mesonephrotus. Combined morphological and molecular studies of the new species show that G. ostendicus is more closely related to G. arcuatus than to G. harengi...|$|E
40|$|The Culbin Sands lagoon {{ecosystem}} in NE Scotland was studied {{during a}} three-year period (1994 - 1996) to identify the major trophic links from benthic invertebrates to epibenthic predators, and to assess impacts of overwintering fish on their prey communities. Every 2 - 4 weeks, samples of mobile fauna were collected to study their diets. The major trophic links identified between benthic invertebrates and epibenthic predators were from benthic invertebrates to the shrimp Crangon crangon, and to the <b>common</b> <b>goby</b> Pomatoschistus microps and the plaice Pleuronectes platessa. The energy flow from benthic invertebrates to overwintering fish was estimated at 133 kJ m– 2 yr– 1. A flow of 10 kJ m– 2 yr– 1 was also observed from eggs and larval stages of the overwintering shrimp Crangon crangon to the overwintering fish. Nevertheless, manipulative field experiments showed no significant impacts of the most abundant overwintering fish Pomatoschistus microps on prey community densities, despite an overall individual ingestion rate of 89 J day– 1...|$|E
40|$|Many animals heavily {{invest in}} parental care but still reject {{at least some}} of their offspring. Although {{seemingly}} paradoxical, selection can favor parents to neglect offspring of particularly low reproductive value, for example, because of small survival chances. We here assess whether filial cannibalism (FC), where parents routinely eat some of their own young, is selective in response to individual offspring reproductive value. We performed two independent laboratory experiments in the <b>common</b> <b>goby</b> (Pomatoschistus microps) to test whether caring fathers preferentially cannibalize eggs of a given infection history and paternity. While males did not discriminate kin from nonkin eggs, they consumed significantly more eggs previously exposed to water mold compared to uninfected eggs. Our findings clearly show that parents differentiate between eggs based on differences in egg condition, and thus complement the prevailing view that FC arises for energetic reasons. By preventing the spread of microbial infections, the removal of molded eggs can constitute an important component of parental care and may represent a key driver of selective FC in a wide array of parental fish...|$|E
40|$|The {{utilization}} of an estuarine brackish marsh in the Westerschelde estuary (southwest Netherlands) by {{fish and crustaceans}} visiting the intertidal creeks at rising tides was investigated over an 18 mo period. Samples were collected every month over a tidal cycle. A stow net passively fished the nekton migrating {{in and out of}} the marsh habitat. Simultaneous measurements of current speed and waterheight allowed for quantification of the catches. Multivariate clustering and ordination techniques were applied to assess temporal changes in the nekton assemblage. A total of 68 fish and crustacean species were caught but only 38 were regular visitors of the marsh creek. The marsh nekton community proved to have a very stable character. Only 40 % of the observed variance could be explained. The seasonal appearance of juvenile stages of fish and crustaceans was found to differentiate between spring and summer-autumn communities. The environmental variables measured (i. e. temperature, salinity, oxygen concentration and detritus standing stock) did not correlate well with the observed changes in community structure. The mysid shrimp Neomysis integer dominated the community, both in density and biomass, during most of the year. Early postlarval flounder Pleuronectes flesus characterized the spring nekton assemblage. Early postlarval brown shrimp Crangon crangon was abundant from spring through autumn. In late summer juveniles of seabass Dicentrarchus labrax, <b>common</b> <b>goby</b> Pomatoschistus microps and shore crab Carcinus maenas were typical members of the marsh creek nekton. The hyperbenthic fauna of the marsh was comparable to the hyperbenthos found in the adjacent subtidal parts of the Westerschelde estuary while the epifauna of both areas differed substantially. It is argued that the marsh under study is a nursery ground for only a small number of estuarine inhabitants: C. crangon, P. flesus, C. maenas, P. microps, D. labrax and possibly 2 mullet species. Adult flounder, adult and juvenile <b>common</b> <b>goby,</b> juvenile seabass and the early postlarval brown shrimp all use the creeks as feeding ground, mainly preying upon the creek infauna and mysids. Given the high abundance of hyperbenthic mysid shrimp in the marsh and their presumed role in detritus-based food chains, we believe marsh studies should not refrain from considering this component of the nekton. This is the first study reporting on the nekton use of a European marsh. The need for similar research in other European marshes is stressed...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{biomarkers}} {{have been widely}} used for the assessment of effects and/or exposure to environmental contaminants. One of the most frequently used biomarkers is the inhibition of cholinesterases (ChE), which is a useful indicator of organophosphate and carbamate exposure and/or effects. Recent studies indicated that more than one ChE may be present in tissues of fish and that different forms may vary in their sensitivity to anticholinesterase agents. Cholinesterase activity of the juvenile of the <b>common</b> <b>goby</b> (Pomatoschistus microps), a widespread fish in estuaries of the Atlantic coast of northwestern Europe, was characterized using four substrates (acetylthiocholine iodide, acetyl-beta-metylthiocholine iodide, propionylthiocholine iodide, and S-butyrylthiocholine iodide) and three ChE inhibitors (eserine sulfate, BW 284 C 51, and iso-OMPA) in different tissues of the fish head. In addition, the range of ChE activity that may be considered as "normal" for non-exposed P. microps was determined. The results suggest the presence of two types of ChE in the whole-head homogenate. The present study underscores the relevance of ChE characterization before its use as a biomarker in biomonitoring studies. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

40|$|Foraging {{behaviour}} of the <b>common</b> <b>goby,</b> Pomatoschistus microp s {{was investigated}} in both the United Kingdom and Sweden, {{with the aim of}} establishing causes and consequences of prey choice and ontogenetic shifts in diet. Goby life-cycle could be clearly divided into two stages, where prey choice changed abruptly from meio- to macrofauna at a standard length of 30 mm. This diet-shift maximised net energy intake rates, as illustrated by a quantitatively validated optimal foraging model. Intrinsic mechanisms were of greater importance than extrinsic factors in driving this shift. Metabolism, the primary prey choice determinant, revealed canalised and predictable diet shifts in the face of variable prey availability. This was in strong contrast to the more usual determinants such as gape limitation or extrinsic factors, such as habitat shift, prey availability and predation risk. Post diet-shift gobies consumed a range of benthic macrofauna dependent on availability. This plasticity in prey choice suggested that foraging efficiency was at some level below that expected for specialist foragers. Translocation experiments provided support for the general assertion that learning and experience are mechanisms through which generalist foragers could improve their foraging efficiency. Ontogenetic changes in prey choice did not result in a trade-off between foragin...|$|E
