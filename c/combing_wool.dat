50|$|Combing is {{a method}} for {{preparing}} carded fiber for spinning. Combing is divided into linear and circular combing. The Noble comb {{is an example of}} circular combing. The French comb is an example of linear combing. The process of combing is accompanied by gilling, a process of evening out carded or combed top making it suitable for spinning. Combing separates out short fibers by means of a rotating ring or rectilinear row of steel pins. The fibers in the 'top' it produces have been straightened and lie parallel to each other. When <b>combing</b> <b>wool,</b> the discarded short fibers are called noils, and are ground up into shoddy.|$|E

Thus it is the action of transforming the initial data in order to extract useful information and to facilitate reaching the conclusions.

Recently, the clinical uses of Dipsaci radix in the treatments of arthritis like symptoms have been noticed a lot amongst natural and integrative medicine practitioners in US. Dipsacus spp has been mainly used as teasers for <b>combing</b> <b>wools</b> in western world 5, 6, 36, wherein the eastern world, the effects of the herb have been appreciated for hundreds of years as a potent muscle and joint healer and effective blood circulator 3, 18, 39. The purpose of this research is to investigate whether the radix of Dipsacus spp (commonly known as Teasel root) has beneficial medicinal properties, and to identify what properties have been studied and what have not. As many valuable botanicals have been known to be very effective clinically, but also been lacking in actual scientific studies to prove the efficacy, the clarification in the current status of the studies may be helpful in implementing the treatment protocols with more controlled approaches. Knowing what is anecdotal, clinically proven or scientifically proven, may always be a important step for any practitioners. There are many different species of Dipsacus; however, for the purpose of the research, only the common species used for Dipsaci radix will be discussed here to stay in focus for the proper clinical use...|$|R
40|$|Yarn {{diameter}} is {{an important}} property which affects the physical properties of the end products. Variations in yarn diameter cause undesirable effects such as imperfections in the knitted or woven fabric and difficulties in weaving prep-aration stages. Thin places in the yarn cause low breaking strength creating difficulties in the downstream processes such as warping, sizing and weaving. Thick places and neps cause appearance imperfections in the fabric. As is known in winding, yarns on spinning bobbins are assembled into larger yarn packages with different tech-niques of splicing. In splicing, {{it is very important}} to obtain a splice with a diameter that is close to the diameter of the parent yarn for the reasons mentioned above. Many studies have been carried out in order to investigate the effects of splicing parameters on the diameter of the splices in yarns. Cheng and Lam investigated different properties of spliced ring spun yarns such as abrasion, bending rigidity and appearance [1, 2]. 1 They used an overall score to evaluate the data obtained from experiments and found that yarn linear density and the degree of overlapping of yarn ends mostly affect the overall spliced yarn properties [1, 2]. Das et al. studied the parameters of fiber friction, yarn twist and splicing air pressure. They observed that the diameter of the splices in yarn is influenced by yarn twist and splicing air pressure [3]. Drobina and Machnio applied image analysis for the identification of the geometric sizes of spliced zones [4]. Hassen et al. found that increasing the time of water injection and yarn overlapping length improved the appear-ance of splices in yarns in water injection splicing [5].
