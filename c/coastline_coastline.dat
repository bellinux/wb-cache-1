This in turn is impacting negatively on the fishing and the tourism industries, amongst others. Millions of people depend on these sectors for their livelihoods and, unsustainable development can only make the plight of those who rely on these resources worse. The tourism industry in the coastal regions is particularly at risk since the industry relies heavily on coastal ecosystems to attract visitors. This chapter discusses the strong links that exist between coastal development, tourism, marine ecosystems and its wildlife, drawing attention to two well-known species widely used in tourism, namely whales and sea turtles, and discussing their conservation in relation to tourism. The chapter is divided into six sections. The second section examines why it is important {{to strike a balance between}} coastal development and protecting ecosystems. In this section, we discuss the ma. ior identified causes of coastal ecosystem degradation from the published literature, and the third section focuses attention on tourism development in the Asian region, which is one of the major reasons for coastal degradation. A diagrammatic approach is used to illustrate that planning of coastal tourism development which takes into account environmental impacts could result in economic benefits to the areas and regions concerned. The negative impacts on tourism when coastal ecosystems are damaged are discussed in section four.

The model shows that sediment drift parallel to the <b>coastline</b> occurs primarily within the distance of 300 meters from the coast. From 2010 to 2013, the general trend of sediment transport in the area {{is that there is a}} net sediment transport from the west to the east direction in the early months of the year, followed by a shorter period of transport in opposite direction (westward) for a few months.

50|$|After the {{sedimentary}} and {{igneous rocks}} were folded and crushed, {{it resulted in}} the creation of a new continental shelf and <b>coastline.</b> This <b>coastline</b> and continental shelf was located adjacent to the eastern margin of Methow Valley. The Insular Plate continued to subduct under the new continental shelf and <b>coastline</b> about 130 million years ago during the mid Cretaceous period after the formation of the Intermontane Belt, supporting a new continental volcanic arc called the Omineca Arc. Magma rising from the Omineca Arc successfully connected the Intermontane Belt to the mainland of North America, forming a chain of volcanoes from Washington to British Columbia that existed for about 60 million years. The ocean lying offshore during this period is called the Bridge River Ocean. About 115 million years ago, another island arc collided with the Pacific Northwest called the Insular Islands and caused the Bridge River Ocean to close. Like the earlier buildup of the Intermontane Islands, this island arc connected to the Intermontane Belt as magma solidified and rose beneath the arc. The compression of the collision created fractures and folds in the Intermontane Belt.|$|R

The majority of permafrost coastal erosion studies {{are limited to}} time periods from {{a few years to}} decades. Most of these studies emphasize the spatial variability of coastal erosion, but the intensity of inter-annual variations, including intermediate coastal aggradation, remains poorly documented. We used repeat airborne Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) elevation data from 2012 and 2013 with 1 m horizontal resolution to study coastal erosion and accompanying mass-wasting processes in the hinterland. Study sites were selected to include different morphologies along the coast of the Yukon Coastal Plain and on Herschel Island. We studied elevation and volume changes and <b>coastline</b> movement and compared the results between geomorphic units. Results showed simple uniform coastal erosion from low coasts (up to 10 m height) and a highly diverse erosion pattern along coasts with higher backshore elevation. This variability was particularly pronounced in the case of active retrogressive thaw slumps, which can decrease coastal erosion or even cause temporary progradation by sediment release. Most of the extremes were recorded in study sites with active slumping (e. g. 22 m of <b>coastline</b> retreat and 42 m of <b>coastline</b> progradation). <b>Coastline</b> progradation also resulted from the accumulation of slope collapse material. These occasional events can significantly affect the <b>coastline</b> position on a specific date and can affect coastal retreat rates as estimated in long term by <b>coastline</b> digitalisation from air photos and satellite imagery.

25|$|Green {{sea turtles}} move across three habitat types, {{depending}} on their life stage. They lay eggs on beaches. Mature turtles {{spend most of their}} time in shallow, coastal waters with lush seagrass beds. Adults frequent inshore bays, lagoons and shoals with lush seagrass meadows. Entire generations often migrate between one pair of feeding and nesting areas. Green sea turtles, Chelonia mydas, are classified as an aquatic species and are distributed around the globe in warm tropical to subtropical waters. The environmental parameter that limits the distribution of the turtles is ocean temperatures below 7 to 10 degrees Celsius. Within their geographical range, the green sea turtles generally stay near continental and island <b>coastlines.</b> Near the <b>coastlines,</b> the green sea turtles live within shallow bays and protected shores. In these protected shores and bays, the green sea turtle habitats include coral reefs, salt marshes, and nearshore seagrass beds. The coral reefs provide red, brown, and green algae for their diet and gives protection from predators and rough storms within the ocean. The salt marshes and seagrass beds contain seaweed and grass vegetation, allowing ample habitat for the sea turtles.|$|R

Surf-zones are important fish habitats, functioning as nursery, foraging, and spawning grounds. Despite the widely recognized importance of surf-zones for fish, there is no comprehensive published review of surf-zone fish ecology. In addition, coastal urbanisation is arguably one of the principal threats to sandy beaches, yet, the effects of urbanisation on surf-zone fish are poorly understood. Surf-zones are also functionally linked to abutting systems (mainly estuaries and offshore reefs). It is, therefore, likely that seascape connectivity influences surf-zone fish assemblages, however, this has not been examined to date.

40|$|Erosion rates along {{permafrost}} <b>coastlines</b> {{are among}} the fastest in the world, {{despite the fact that}} they are only ice free for 3 - 4 months of the year. Yearly coastal erosion rates of up to 20 m were recorded along ice rich and unconsolidated coasts of the Beaufort and Laptev Sea. Coastal erosion can thus cause rapid land loss and release large amounts sediments, which can alter near-shore ecosystems. Mass-wasting processes such as active-layer detachments, retrogressive thaw slumping and block failures frequently occur along the coasts of Yukon Coastal Plain and Herschel Island. They can significantly impact coastal dynamics and sediment delivery on the shore. In our study we use high resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) to observe short term coastal erosion along Yukon Coast and Herschel Island. DEMs were acquired from LIDAR surveys during the AIRMETH campaigns in 2012 and 2013. The DEMs were processed to obtain a horizontal resolution of 1 meter and compared to identify erosion and accumulation events. Our results show that erosion behaviour is simple and relatively linear at low-elevation coasts (up to 10 m height), where we recorded yearly <b>coastline</b> retreat from 0 to 20 m. Coastal erosion behaviour becomes diverse and slower at higher-elevation coasts, where mass-wasting processes are more active. Among these mass-wasting processes, retrogressive thaw slumping is particularly important. Activated material can be accumulated at the slump outlets or can be transported along the coast by longshore drift. Such material accumulations caused up to 42 m of <b>coastline</b> progradation. Significant accumulation events were identified also due to block failures (up to 20 m of <b>coastline</b> progradation). Although they are generally short-lived features, they can occur frequently and can influence <b>coastline</b> digitalisations. <b>Coastline</b> observations are therefore not indicating the volume loss that is occurring due to mass wasting. We observe discrepancy between planimetric (<b>coastline</b> movement) and volumetric (recorded by DEMs) coastal erosion on Herschel Island. Exploring the relationship between both measures of coastal erosion would enable better estimates of released sediments from the coasts characterised by mass wasting...|$|R
40|$|Ocean and terra are {{the largest}} geomorphologic units on the earth, and there are {{essential}} differences between them. Hence, while we make the geomorphologic relief shading map, {{it is necessary to}} make the ocean/terrestrial geomorphologic relief shading map respectively. Then combining the ocean and terra map, we can get a whole geomorphologic map about the study area. However, the SRTM-DEM(Shuttle Radar Topography Mission-Digital Elevation Model) we get from USGS(United States Geological Survey) is clipped by SWBD(Shorelines and Water Bodies Database) <b>coastline,</b> so the <b>coastline</b> may be not accordance with the <b>coastline</b> we get about the study area. To solve this problem, we had to clip the DEM and patch the void data. Only in this way can we assure the DEM is accordance with the <b>coastline.</b> If the DEM is larger than the <b>coastline,</b> we can cut the spare parts by using the tool - extract by mask. However, if the DEM is smaller than the <b>coastline,</b> we have to patch the void data. This paper tries to find the best interpolating method to patch the void area according to the geomorphologic units. After that, we illustrate the processes of how to make the geomorphologic relief shading map by the software - Global Mapper...|$|R
40|$|The Yellow River is {{the river}} {{with the highest}} {{sediment}} contents of all rivers in the world. Several hundred million tons of sediment are transported to the coast and to the sea nearby annually, so the Yellow River Delta is in a continuous dynamic state due to interactions of river sediments and marine erosion. In this paper, the <b>coastline</b> evolution in the delta from 1976 to 2004 were studied using multi-temporal remote sensing images since the river course of the Yellow River was changed to Qing Shui Gou channel artificially in 1976. Trying to anatomize the spatio-temporal feature of <b>coastline</b> evolution, 21 sheets of Landsat images were used as the data source. The multi-temporal satellite images were rectificated precisely and registered each other, and all the images have the same coordinate system. A mean high water (MHW) model was developed for extracting <b>coastlines,</b> and the <b>coastlines</b> were extracted automatically from remote sensing images after supervised classification. The result shows that a new land of 323 km(2) was formed {{during the period of}} 1976 to 1999 in the present estuary by GIS overlay analysis, but a territory of 31 km(2) was eroded after 1999. Meanwhile, a territory of 153 km(2) was eroded in the Diaokou estuary area {{to the north of the}} Yellow River Delta from 1976 to 2004...|$|R
