Although these cells cannot be considered as renewable as the fuel, hydrogen or carbon monoxide is consumed and not regenerated, the excellent reliability of such a cell can act as a stimulus to innovative development of similar cells with different outcomes. Molten salt electrolytes based upon LiCl - Li 2 O can be used to convert carbon dioxide, either drawn from the output of a <b>conventional</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>power</b> <b>station</b> or from the atmosphere, to carbon monoxide or carbon. Recently, dimensionally stable anodes have been developed for molten salt electrolytes, based upon alkali or alkaline ruthenates which are highly electronically conducting and these may allow the concept of high temperature batteries to be developed in which an alkali or alkaline earth element reacts with air to form oxides when the battery is discharging and the oxide decomposes when the battery is being recharged. Batteries using these concepts may be based upon the Hall-Heroult cell, which is used worldwide for the production of aluminium on an industrial scale, and could be used for load levelling. Lithium ion batteries are, at present, the preferred energy source for cars in 2050 as there are sufficient lithium reserves to satisfy the world’s energy needs for this particular application. Graphite is used in lithium ion batteries as the anode but the capacity is relatively low. Silicon and tin have much higher capacities and the use of these materials, encapsulated in carbon nanotubes and nanoparticles will be described. This paper will review these interesting developments and demonstrate that a combination of carbon and molten salts can offer novel ways of storing energy and converting carbon dioxide into useful products...|$|E

40|$|Energy {{research}} and development are forced to utilize the limited fossil energy sources in an economical manner {{in order to obtain}} higher efficiency rates by energy conversion. To this end, procedures must also be taken into account which, up to now, have beenregarded as uneconomic in view of the low prices of primary energy. While the possibilities of a better energy utilization are largely exhausted in connection with <b>conventional</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>power</b> <b>stations,</b> newly designed technological processes promise to yield further increases in the efficiency rate. This conclusion was reached by more than 220 specialists during a conference at the KFA Jülich on February 4 - 5, 1976. "Technologies for improved energy utilization in power plants" was therefore the subject of a symposium, to which KFA Jülich, being in charge of the project management for energy research, had invited specialists in the fields of {{research and}} industry. It was the purpose of this conference to point out: — the status of power plant engineering and possible development approaches,- today's industrial research activities in the field of power plant engineering, - limits to improved energy utilization from a technical, industrial, and economic point of view, — research objectives aiming at improved utilization of fossil energy sources. This is to summarize some of the important results obtained {{in the course of this}} conference. There still exist at present quite a number of unused possibilities to better utilize the energy in <b>thermal</b> <b>power</b> plants and there is also by no means a lack of technologies: the realization of systems of higher conversion efficiency is rather impeded, even today, by the enormous financial expenditure involved. The aim of new developments in the field of electricity generation from coal is not only an improvement in the efficiency rate, but also an improvement in environmental protection. In presentday power plant engineering, the efficiency rate is governed by the steam process. When adhering to current process techniques, a further improvement in the efficiency rate is only feasible by increasing the temperature of steam conditions. This will, however, only lead to an improvement in the efficiency rate by 1 %, since it implies the use of expensive austenitic material. Improvements in the efficiency rate for electricity generation can therefore only be achieved economically when applying novel process techniques. In this connection, the following methods are being discussed: — direct conversion of chemical energy into electricity using fuel cells, - increase of process temperature by using gas turbines and combined gas/steam turbine processes, - application of conversion processes producing not only electricity, but also other kinds of energy in a third stage, e. g. steam, — processes using nuclear energy in addition to coal and producing electricity as well energy in a third stage. All these processes require the availability of gaseous energy from coal, either as chemical energy or in the form of heat. The status and the problems involved in the development of these techniques are discussed in detail, and two separate contributions deal withpotential improvements in the efficiency rate of steam and gas turbines and with the use of gas/steam turbine blocks. The possibilities of improving the efficiency rate of the combustion process in conventional power plants have been largely exhausted, a fact which is also true for possible improvements in the energy yield of fossil energy sources. Development work is still being carried out in connection with the optimization of individual power plants, which is influenced by boundary conditions such as mode of application and situation on the fuel market, and for the technical improvement of individual components.

40|$|Biomass is classed as a {{renewable}} resource. Depending on {{the means}} of production, it can be sustainable and can provide net benefits regarding CO 2 emissions by displacing fossil fuels as an energy source. A significant biomass energy conversion technology is combustion in <b>conventional</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>power</b> <b>stations.</b> This can be implemented in large scale plants such as those which dominated electricity generation throughout the 20 th century. While these <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> were generally fuelled by the erstwhile ‘King Coal’, the technology is not exclusive to it. Coal consumption can be displaced in these types of plants by either co-firing biomass with coal or full conversion to biomass. Currently, in the UK, {{the vast majority of}} the biomass fuel consumed for power generation is imported pelletized forestry wood. However, sustainability and domestic energy security concerns have created interest in using other resources including energy crops such as short rotation coppice willow and miscanthus, agricultural by-products such as wheat straw and olive residue. The variation in the properties of these fuels presents a number of technical challenges which conventional power plant must overcome to achieve ‘fuel flexibility’. Along with other technical challenges regarding the operation of <b>conventional</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>power</b> plant, these formed the basis of the Research Councils UK funded consortium grant (EPSRC, 2012) entitled Future Conventional Power. As a consortium partner in this project, the University of Leeds led research tasks associated with fuel flexibility. Much of the research presented in this thesis was based on the objectives set out in the Future Conventional Power project and was financially supported though this grant. Two particular challenges provide the incentive for the investigations presented in this thesis and can be summarised as: •	assessing the variability in fuel combustion behaviour and control of burn-out efficiency for different fuels •	understanding the behaviour of potassium during the combustion of biomass fuels to aid in the prediction of ash behaviour, emissions and associated operational problems Both these points were addressed with a series of experimental studies. In addition, a model of the combustion of single particles was developed for validating and interpreting the results. A range of fourteen solid biomass fuels, typical of those likely to be used in large scale power plant, were selected for the experimental studies. The composition and fundamental characteristics of these fuels, obtained by standard analytical techniques, are presented. In the first experimental study, single particles were exposed to a methane flame, simulating biomass combustion in a furnace. Measurements of ignition delay, volatile burning time and char burn-out time were undertaken using high speed image capture. Particle surface temperatures were measured by infra-red thermal imaging. Analysis of the data identified correlations between the biomass fundamental characteristics, particle size, and the observed combustion profiles. Empirical expressions for the duration of each combustion stage are obtained from the data. From these, a “burn-out” index is derived which provides a useful indication of the relative milling requirements of different fuels for achieving effective burn-out efficiency. A similar experimental method was used in the second study in which the gas-phase potassium release patterns from single particles of various biomass fuels were measured by use of flame emission spectroscopy. The observed potassium release patterns for the various fuel samples are presented. The release patterns revealed qualitative differences between different fuel types. Relationships between the initial potassium content, peak rate of release and the fractions of potassium released at each stage of combustion were identified. These were subsequently used for comparing with results of modelled potassium release. A third experimental study investigated the variation in thermal conductivity between different types of solid biomass using a technique and apparatus developed specifically for the study. The results showed variation of thermal conductivity between different types of biomass which had been similarly homogenised and densified. The thermal conductivity of small particles of each fuel was derived. The resulting data provides useful values for thermal modelling of biomass particles and is used subsequently in a combustion model. Elements of each of the experimental studies were used in a detailed model of single particle combustion. In this, the particle was modelled as a series of concentric spherical layers which enabled calculation of internal mass diffusion and heat transfer. Devolatilisation and char oxidation were approximated with single step reaction kinetics. A volatilisation and diffusion mechanism was adopted to simulate the release of gas-phase potassium from the particle. The output from the model was compared and validated using data from the experimental studies. The modelling produced confirming evidence that the assumed mechanisms for gas-phase potassium release were valid and provided a tool for future investigation of the subject. ...|$|R
