5000|$|... #Caption: HP Kittyhawk Microdrive, {{shown with}} a coin and <b>compact</b> <b>flash</b> <b>card</b> for {{comparison}} ...|$|E
5000|$|Stores up to 800 {{patterns}} (each with 16-tracks called parts) in user memory, {{and up to}} 700 more on a <b>Compact</b> <b>Flash</b> <b>card</b> ...|$|E
50|$|It is {{possible}} to replace the stock 4 GB Microdrive with a 4GB <b>Compact</b> <b>Flash</b> <b>card,</b> improving battery life and operating speed due to the lower power consumption of flash memory and relative speed increased compared to hard disks.|$|E
5000|$|Has {{not kept}} up with the {{transfer}} rate, or speed, of other <b>cards,</b> notably <b>Compact</b> <b>Flash</b> and SD, but also the later versions of the Memory Stick. The fastest xD card offers less than 10% {{of the speed of}} current (2009) <b>Compact</b> <b>Flash</b> <b>cards.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Clie PEG-NX73V is a {{personal}} digital assistant (PDA) made by Sony {{in the form of}} a mini tablet computer. The NX73V is essentially the same device as the NX70V but with some minor changes, including accepting <b>Compact</b> <b>Flash</b> <b>cards</b> from other manufacturers.|$|R
5000|$|Expansion: Memory Stick Pro, <b>Compact</b> <b>Flash</b> (Type II), Wireless LAN (In form of <b>Compact</b> <b>Flash</b> {{expansion}} <b>card</b> sold separately by Sony) ...|$|R
50|$|The {{filesystem}} architecture {{combines a}} transparent overlay filesystem (pioneered by Linux Live Distributions) with an on-line backup service. User data is locally cached on <b>Compact</b> <b>Flash</b> <b>Card,</b> then transparently encrypted with 128-bit encryption {{and transferred to}} remote storage servers at Amazon S3.|$|E
5000|$|Disk: All Komodo blades have a local <b>Compact</b> <b>Flash</b> <b>card</b> (usually 32MB in size) {{which is}} {{referred}} to as the maintenance partition or [...] "MP." [...] The MP contains a compact linux install, that can be used (with a restrictive shell) to recover the boot disk(s).|$|E
50|$|The MobilePro P300 was {{released}} in 2002. Unlike {{the rest of the}} MobilePro range, the P300 was a Pocket PC without a keyboard. It had a <b>compact</b> <b>flash</b> <b>card</b> slot and an SD card slot. It had 32 MB of RAM, a 206 MHz Intel StrongARM processor and ran Windows Pocket PC 2002.|$|E
50|$|This legacy {{technology}} {{is used in}} a wide range of products and devices, as a standard for interchanging information, such as <b>compact</b> <b>flash</b> <b>cards</b> used in cameras. VFAT LFN long filenames introduced by Windows 95/98/ME retained compatibility. But the VFAT LFN used on NT-based systems (Windows NT/2K/XP) uses a modified 8.3 shortname.|$|R
25|$|Roxas also {{requested}} the Presidential Electoral Tribunal to order an independent forensic {{examination of the}} 26,000 <b>compact</b> <b>flash</b> <b>cards</b> and the source code of the PCOS machines used in the 2010 elections. As of August 2015, the case remains in pre-trial stage, with the last action taken by the tribunal dating back to December 2012.|$|R
5000|$|Dual <b>Compact</b> <b>Flash</b> UDMA <b>card</b> slots (mirror, overflow, back-up, RAW on 1/JPEG on 2, Stills on 1/Movies on 2, copy) ...|$|R
50|$|An updated version, the RD2204A, {{was sold}} with a 64MB <b>Compact</b> <b>Flash</b> <b>card.</b> This version {{supports}} Compact flash cards up {{to at least}} 2GB. Like the RD2201A, boot times increase {{with the size of}} the card. The RD2204A can also be used with a third party CF reader, provided that the user installs the RCA software on the PC.|$|E
50|$|Another {{downside}} {{is that most of}} these backs have to be used tethered to a computer. One reason is {{that there would be no}} other way to know when critical focus has been achieved, and the second reason is the huge file sizes, measured in hundreds of megabytes or even gigabytes. A 4 GB <b>Compact</b> <b>Flash</b> <b>card</b> can only store a handful of images.|$|E
50|$|A special small {{footprint}} embedded image {{is also available}} (.img, ~150MB).The preferred method is the embedded installation onto a USB stick, <b>Compact</b> <b>Flash</b> <b>card</b> (CF), or hard disc HDD/SSD, for which NAS4Free was designed. The NAS4Free OS will load into system memory, eliminating system writes to a drive. Flash devices are more energy efficient, and the updating process {{can be done by}} WebGUI in the browser, downloading and installing a new firmware image.|$|E
25|$|First Week of May - Smartmatic-TIM {{recalls the}} <b>Compact</b> <b>Flash</b> <b>Cards</b> (CFC) of all Precinct Count Optical Scanner (PCOS) Machines {{due to the}} {{machines}} not counting the votes correctly due to the spacing of the ballot. These were found out after testing. By Election Day, 99% of all CF Cards were already delivered. The remaining 1% was due to some inaccessible precincts.|$|R
5000|$|The Dimâge EX {{features}} a maximum resolution of 1344×1008 pixels and stores files in JPEG format. Though the term [...] "megapixel" [...] was not widely {{used at the}} time of its manufacture, it operates at 1.5 megapixels, a large file-size for non-SLR digital cameras of its time. It utilizes <b>Compact</b> <b>Flash</b> <b>cards</b> and initially shipped with a single 8 MB card.|$|R
50|$|It has dual memory slots. The first {{supports}} xD-Picture Card, {{the other}} supports <b>Compact</b> <b>Flash</b> Type II Microdrives up to 2GB. Some <b>Compact</b> <b>Flash</b> memory <b>cards</b> will not work.|$|R
50|$|The output can be {{recorded}} with an audio recorder as with FD detectors, or with more recent units, the signal can {{be recorded}} directly {{to an internal}} digital memory such as a <b>compact</b> <b>flash</b> <b>card.</b> The whole waveform is recorded with the full call range being preserved, rather than 1/10 of the waveform as in a FD detector. Since both frequency and amplitude information are preserved in the recorded call, more data is available for species analysis.|$|E
50|$|Videoscopes are {{normally}} 10 mm {{or less in}} diameter and come in lengths up to 15 m (50 ft). Several integral features include the insertion probe section, the articulated tip, articulation controls (up down left right) on the control handle, lighting bundle, high intensity external light source and cable interface with outputs to the display (LCD or CRT) and external media recording device such as computer hard disk or <b>compact</b> <b>flash</b> <b>card.</b> The system normally will record either live video or still photos.|$|E
5000|$|JLime {{developers}} [...] "Chazco" [...] and [...] "B_Lizzard" [...] {{created an}} initrd based installation tool which can install JLime onto the Jornada 6xx {{without the need}} of any Linux machine, however development of this method has halted {{and has not been}} applied to any handheld PC other than the jornada 6xx. Most PDA systems use flash memory, but the Jornada handheld computers lack this facility. Therefore, JLime is installed onto a (partitioned) <b>compact</b> <b>flash</b> <b>card.</b> The installer uses a text based dialog orientated interface.|$|E

25|$|In 2000, Lexar {{introduced}} a <b>Compact</b> <b>Flash</b> (CF) <b>card</b> with a USB connection, and a companion card read/writer and USB cable that eliminated {{the need for}} a USB hub.|$|R
50|$|Olympus {{began to}} move away from the xD format with the release of the E-P1 camera, which {{supported}} only Secure Digital memory cards. As of Spring 2010, all new Olympus cameras announced at the 2010 Consumer Electronics Show and Photo Marketing Association International Trade Show can use SD cards. This changeover to the SD card format has never been officially announced by Olympus Corporation. The higher-end DSLR cameras such as the E-3 and E-5 among others continue to use <b>Compact</b> <b>Flash</b> <b>cards</b> as well.|$|R
5000|$|... m0n0wall is an {{embedded}} firewall {{distribution of}} FreeBSD, {{one of the}} BSD operating system descendants. It provides a small image which can be put on Compact Flash cards {{as well as on}} CD-ROMs and hard disks. It runs on a number of embedded platforms and generic PCs. The PC version can be run with just a Live CD and a floppy disk to store configuration data, or on a single <b>Compact</b> <b>Flash</b> <b>card</b> (with an IDE adapter). This eliminates the need for a hard drive, which reduces noise and heat levels.|$|E
5000|$|Hewlett-Packard's Appliances and Calculators Organization (ACO) in Melbourne, Australia, {{also worked}} on the HP Jornada X25 (F1904A) aka [...] "Calypso", a PDA based on a {{customized}} Linux version provided by Lineo Australia and Taiwan. It came with a StrongARM 133 MHz processor, 8 MB of flash, 32 MB of RAM, <b>compact</b> <b>flash</b> <b>card</b> expansion port, infra-red connectivity and USB. Similar to the Windows CE-based HP Xpander, which was cancelled in November 2001, the X25 project was cancelled close to release in early 2002 as well. Between 140 and 200 units were manufactured in a pre-production run.|$|E
50|$|Modern day devices {{include the}} Everdrive 64 and the 64drive. The Everdrive loads ROM images from either USB or from SD card {{inserted}} {{into the top of}} the cartridge. The 64Drive also uses USB but can also load games from either SD card or <b>compact</b> <b>Flash</b> <b>card.</b> Both units require a CIC chip soldering into the board and the plastic casing from a donor cartridge. Neither unit has the ability to backup cartridges. You can however backup cartridges using a device called Retrode, this is USB powered device that installs itself as a mass storage device in windows, allowing the cartridge information to be backed up.|$|E
50|$|The latest Nissan Armada Platinum edition {{features}} a 9.3GB hard drive for storing music, and a CF (<b>Compact</b> <b>Flash)</b> memory <b>card</b> reader. The Platinum edition also {{features a}} power liftgate, and 3rd row seats that fold electronically.|$|R
50|$|On {{the day of}} elections, an {{estimated}} 18,000 voting machines, representing {{a quarter of the}} total 78,000 machines, experienced problems in transmitting the voting results. The Comelec claimed that the problems were caused not by the machines themselves, but by corrupted <b>compact</b> <b>flash</b> <b>cards</b> and issues with the cellular network coverage. Comelec Chairman Sixto Brillantes claimed that the Comelec was aware of problems with cellular network coverage, but deliberately kept it from the public until after the election. The poll watchdog AES Watch issued a statement on May 18, saying that up to 8.6 million votes had been affected, or possibly disenfranchised.|$|R
50|$|Program stream {{exceptions}} are M2TS, {{which is used}} on Blu-ray discs, AVCHD on re-writable DVDs and HDV on <b>compact</b> <b>flash</b> <b>cards</b> all use the unnecessary overhead of a transport stream. While VOB on DVDs and Enhanced VOB on the short lived HD DVD do not waste storage space and just use the program stream. M2TS also adds an incompatible private extension of four network ordered bytes {{to the end of}} every transport stream packet, which is used as a random access timing reference for faster read times over using the Program Clock Reference contained in the adaption section of the primary stream.|$|R
5000|$|GBA Movie Player: The GBA Movie Player is a {{versatile}} gaming cartridge that {{allows users to}} play NES/Famicom games, watch movies, read [...]txt files, listen to sound clips, etc. The GBA Movie Player does not actually play MPEGS or MP3s directly, a freeware conversion software is needed, that converts an array of formats into GBM and GBS formats that are compatible with the GBA Movie Player. There are two forms of the GBA Movie Player with one using a CF (<b>Compact</b> <b>Flash)</b> <b>card</b> and one using an SD (Secure Digital) card, though different companies have made their own devices similar to the GBA Movie Player.|$|E
50|$|ZCA is {{best known}} as an add-on device to the Anabat bat detector. The {{original}} bat calls are digitised and the zero crossing points used to produce a data stream which is recorded on a <b>Compact</b> <b>Flash</b> <b>card.</b> There are sophisticated timing controls and the device can be set to respond to bat calls, so that many hours of recording are available in unmanned situations. The purpose of ZCA is {{to reduce the amount of}} data which must be recorded to the memory and may be considered as a simple form of lossy data compression. Historically, to achieve long recording times, such information reduction has been necessary due to memory capacity limitations and memory cost.|$|E
50|$|The Canon EOS 7D {{offers the}} ability to record audio from an {{external}} source. Both shutter and aperture are available for manual control, and the 7D also provides multiple frame rate options, including three that match the HD television timing specs. Like most DSLR modes, the Canon 7D neglects endless autofocus during video recording, {{which is a great}} concern for advanced amateurs with pros likely to focus manually nonetheless. Separate movie clips that are captured by the Canon EOS 7D are limited to twelve minutes in the high definition 1080p and 720p modes, or 24 minutes in the standard definition VGA mode, depending on what <b>Compact</b> <b>Flash</b> <b>Card</b> is being used. Larger memory cards make for longer video lengths and are available in multiple sizes for the camera.|$|E
5000|$|The Rio Carbon, {{along with}} all of Rio's Microdrive-based players, can be {{modified}} to run on <b>Compact</b> <b>Flash</b> <b>cards</b> instead of hard disk. This requires a partial disassembly of the unit, removing the Microdrive, {{replacing it with a}} compatible CF card, and then formatting the memory and loading the device firmware. Compatible CF cards must be 8GB or less, and must have TrueATA/TrueIDE mode capability. This mod will increase speed and responsiveness of the player, along with making it more durable and increasing battery life. The 8GB limit is due to the 24-bit addressing in the firmware.Some confirmed compatible cards: ...|$|R
50|$|Canon had {{compatibility}} {{problems with}} the Lexar Professional 80x-speed <b>Compact</b> <b>Flash</b> (CF) <b>cards</b> which resulted in either total image loss, or the camera freezing up. In the cases of the camera freezing, the images may still be retrieved using an external CF card reader.|$|R
5000|$|The {{camera is}} marketed by Olympus as the world's {{smallest}} DSLR with built-in image stabilization (IS). It is 130 mm × 94 mm × 60 mm {{in size and}} weighs 475 g, body only (533 g with battery and a <b>Compact</b> <b>Flash</b> memory <b>card).</b>|$|R
