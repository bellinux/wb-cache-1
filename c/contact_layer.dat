25|$|A {{laser diode}} is {{electrically}} a PIN diode. The active {{region of the}} laser diode is in the intrinsic (I) region, and the carriers (electrons and holes) are pumped into that region from the N and P regions respectively. While initial diode laser research was conducted on simple P-N diodes, all modern lasers use the double-hetero-structure implementation, where the carriers and the photons are confined {{in order to maximize}} their chances for recombination and light generation. Unlike a regular diode, the goal for a laser diode is to recombine all carriers in the I region, and produce light. Thus, laser diodes are fabricated using direct band-gap semiconductors. The laser diode epitaxial structure is grown using one of the crystal growth techniques, usually starting from an N doped substrate, and growing the I doped active layer, followed by the P doped cladding, and a <b>contact</b> <b>layer.</b> The active layer most often consists of quantum wells, which provide lower threshold current and higher efficiency.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we address the {{fundamental}} challenge of forming an efficient contact between the p-type a-Si:H layer and n-type TCO's as <b>contact</b> <b>layers</b> in amorphous/crystalline silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells. We point out the capability of Suns-V-oc measurements to give valuable insights into the formation of Schottky barriers and its influence on the solar cell fill factor FF. The influence of the a-Si:H(p) doping on the Schottky characteristic is shown for test structures and on device level. Test structures are used to probe the influence of various <b>contact</b> <b>layers</b> on the effective work function at the a-Si:H/contact layer interface. A very good correlation between the vacuum work function of different <b>contact</b> <b>layers</b> and the open-circuit voltage is observed for test structures. Therefore, we could demonstrate the work function mismatch between a-Si:H and ITO and a-Si:H and various metals as <b>contact</b> <b>layers.</b> For small area n-type silicon solar cells featuring an a-Si:H(p) rear emitter and a diffused front surface field (FSF), it is shown that by improving the carrier transport between the a-Si:H(p) and the <b>contacting</b> <b>layer,</b> ITO(n) or metal, FF above 80 % can be obtained. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a TCO is not mandatory for the rear SHJ emitter, which simplifies the cell structure and allows for proper junction engineering. We obtained high internal rear side reflection with a single metal layer and an efficiency of 22. 8 % for these TCO-less SHJ emitter solar cells. As these solar cells feature FF of up to 81. 5 %, they clearly demonstrate the high FF potential of the silicon heterojunction which {{can be achieved by}} proper junction engineering...|$|R

Together with Jeremy Burroughes he undertook the initial characterisation of the basic properties of poly(p-phenylenevinylene) light emitting diodes, demonstrating that the light emission phenomenon was injection electroluminescence and that the frequency response was sufficiently fast to permit video display applications. Recognizing the importance of their discovery Bradley and Burroughes decided that it should be patented and together with Richard Friend filed a GB patent (PCT/GB90.00584) with first claim:An electroluminescent device comprising a semiconductor layer in the form of a thin dense polymer film comprising at least one conjugated polymer;''''a first <b>contact</b> <b>layer</b> which is selected so that on application of an electric field to said device charge carriers of a first type are injected into the semiconductor layer; and a second <b>contact</b> <b>layer</b> which is selected so that on application of an electric field to said device charge carriers of a second type are injected into the semiconductor layers, wherein the polymer film of the semiconductor layer has sufficiently low concentration of extrinsic charge carriers that on applying an electric field between the first and second contact layers across the semiconductor layer as to render the second <b>contact</b> <b>layer</b> positive relative to the first <b>contact</b> <b>layer</b> charge carriers of said first and second types are injected into the semiconductor layer and combine to form in the conjugated polymer charge carrier pairs which decay radiatively so that radiation is emitted from the conjugated polymer.|$|E

40|$|<b>Contact</b> <b>layers</b> play an {{important}} role in thin film solar cells, but new material development and optimization of its thickness is usually a long and tedious process. A high-throughput experimental approach has been used to accelerate the rate of research in photovoltaic (PV) light absorbers and transparent conductive electrodes, however the combinatorial research on <b>contact</b> <b>layers</b> is less common. Here, we report on the chemical bath deposition (CBD) of CdS thin films by combinatorial dip coating technique and apply these <b>contact</b> <b>layers</b> to Cu(In,Ga) Se- 2 (CIGSe) and Cu 2 ZnSnSe 4 (CZTSe) light absorbers in PV devices. Combinatorial thickness steps of CdS thin films were achieved by removal of the substrate from the chemical bath, at regular intervals of time, and in equal distance increments. The trends in the photoconversion efficiency and in the spectral response of the PV devices as a function of thickness of CdS contacts were explained with the help of optical and morphological characterization of the CdS thin films. The maximum PV efficiency achieved for the combinatorial dip-coating CBD was similar to that for the PV devices processed using conventional CBD. The results of this study lead to the conclusion that combinatorial dip-coating can be used to accelerate the optimization of PV device performance of CdS and other candidate <b>contact</b> <b>layers</b> for a wide range of emerging absorbers...|$|R
