5|$|In 1958, a new {{station in}} the Tomorrowland section was built for the DRR.

5|$|To have {{sufficient}} {{space for the}} planned New Orleans Square section, the Disneyland Railroad's track on {{the western edge of}} its route was expanded outwards again in 1962, Frontierland Station's depot building in that same vicinity was moved across the DRR's track, and a <b>covered</b> <b>platform</b> with no station building was built on the opposite side to serve as the new Frontierland Station. Although the station was no longer in the Frontierland section, its name was not changed to New Orleans Square Station until September 1996.|$|E
5|$|Also during 1956, the Fantasyland Depot, a new {{station with}} a Medieval theme and {{consisting}} of a <b>covered</b> <b>platform</b> with no station building, was created for the DRR in the Fantasyland section. By the time this new station was added, the DRR's system of having one train assigned to a single station and using sidings to pass trains stopped at stations was abandoned and replaced by the current system where each train stops at every station along the railroad's route. Fantasyland Depot was removed by July 1966 when the It's a Small World attraction, originally built for the 1964 New York World's Fair, was installed.|$|E

5|$|From 1982, A, B, C, D, and E {{tickets were}} {{discontinued}} {{in favor of}} a pay-one-price admission system for Disneyland, allowing visitors to experience the park's attractions, including the DRR, as many times as desired. In June 1985, the new Videopolis Station, consisting of a <b>covered</b> <b>platform</b> with no station building, was built in the Fantasyland section for the DRR. That same year, the DRR's track on the northern edge of its route was expanded outwards in order {{to make room for the}} new Videopolis stage. With the Mickey's Toontown expansion of the park, Mickey's Toontown Depot, a cartoon-themed depot building, replaced Videopolis Station in 1993.|$|E

2500|$|Albury {{railway station}} {{is on the}} main Sydney-Melbourne railway line.

2500|$|On 26 September 1855 {{the first}} railway in New South Wales, the Sydney to Granville railway opened. Exactly a year later, a branch was opened {{from what was}} known as Parramatta Junction (the present day Granville) to Liverpool. This line was {{extended}} to Campbelltown in 1858, Picton in 1868, Goulburn in 1869, Yass Junction in 1876, Galong, Harden-Murrumburrah and Cootamundra in 1877 and Junee and Bomen (on the north bank of the Murrumbidgee River) in 1878. The Murrumbidgee River Railway Bridge was completed in 1881 and the line was extended to Wagga Wagga, Uranquinty, The Rock, Henty and Albury in 1881. Victorian Railways' North East [...] gauge line was extended from Wodonga to Albury in 1883. To accommodate the break of gauge, a very long railway platform was built, the <b>covered</b> <b>platform</b> {{being one of the}} longest in Australia.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{identified}} in the Beeching Report for closure, consent was refused and a peak service was run for many years along the Croxley Green branch. In the 1980s, {{attempts were made to}} revive the fortunes of the Croxley Green branch: a special football station, , was built in 1982 for the use of football supporters visiting Watford FC, although it was only used when Watford were playing at home. In 1988, a twice-hourly daytime service was introduced to further revitalise the line, but this was abandoned in the early 1990s and services were reduced to one 6.00am return working from Watford Junction on weekdays — a parliamentary train, run specially to avoid the costly process of officially closing the line. The facilities at the two principal stations along the route, [...] and Watford West were significantly downgraded in the late 1980s and early 1990s. For example, the original <b>covered</b> <b>platform</b> at Croxley Green was removed in 1989 and replaced with a temporary scaffolding platform with no protection from the elements, and at both stations the covered staircases were demolished and replaced with open stairways.|$|E
