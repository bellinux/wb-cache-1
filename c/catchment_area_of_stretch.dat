40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this diploma thesis is {{defining}} the <b>catchment</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> surface waters for suitable land management, which is also reflected on water quality. Besides basic concepts, legal backgrounds in Slovenia, which are related to water areas and water management, are introduced. The thesis presents the existing models <b>of</b> <b>catchment</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> waters in Slovenia and it especially exposes the subsistent methodology <b>of</b> defining <b>catchment</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> surface waters {{on the basis of}} digital elevation models and other geographically defined data in GIS, which stood as a foundation for defining <b>catchment</b> <b>areas</b> at the local level. The analysis of land use inside the predetermined <b>catchment</b> <b>areas</b> delineated in GIS was performed within the study <b>area.</b> The emphasis <b>of</b> this thesis is set on modeling <b>catchment</b> <b>areas</b> and on extracting of the current state and defining the influence of land use on surface waters within their <b>catchment</b> <b>areas.</b> Determination <b>of</b> <b>catchment</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> surface waters and analysis of land use in these areas can significantly support the idea of suitable land management and efficient response in case of different kinds of pollutions, which influences also the water quality...|$|R
50|$|A {{neighborhood}} or district {{of a city}} often has several small convenience shops, each with a <b>catchment</b> <b>area</b> <b>of</b> several streets. Supermarkets, on the other hand, have a much lower density, with <b>catchment</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> several neighborhoods (or several villages in rural areas). This principle, similar to the central place theory, makes <b>catchment</b> <b>areas</b> an important <b>area</b> <b>of</b> study for geographers, economists, and urban planners.|$|R
