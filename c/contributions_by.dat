5|$|A {{sequel to}} Nier, , was {{released}} in February 2017. Its music was again composed by Keiichi Okabe and the Monaca team, with Emi Evans and Nami Nakagawa on vocals, Takanori Goto on guitar, and additional <b>contributions</b> <b>by</b> several artists. A soundtrack album for the game was released worldwide by Square Enix on March 29, 2017. The three-disc, 3:33:43-long album contains all of the music from the game, as well as, like the original game's album, variations on the main theme in multiple languages. Unlike the original Nier, where all of the versions were written and sung by Emi Evans and had the same lyrical meanings, the versions in Automata were written and sung by multiple people: the English version by J'Nique Nicole, one in an invented French-derived language by Evans, and the Japanese written by Yoko Taro and sung by Marina Kawano.|$|E

In 1999, the Caspersens provided a $5 million gift for expanding graduate education programs at Drew. In honor of their service to the university, Drew renamed its graduate school as the Caspersen School of Graduate Studies. The university's Rose Memorial Library houses a collection of books, manuscripts, artifacts and papers of Nebraska-born author Willa Cather (1873–1947) assembled from items given by several donors—including significant <b>contributions</b> <b>by</b> Caspersen and his wife.

5|$|Catch a Fire is a 1973 album by Bob Marley and the Wailers. It {{was their}} first album {{released}} by Island Records. After touring and recording in the United Kingdom with Johnny Nash, Nash's departure to the United States left the band without enough money to return home; they approached producer Chris Blackwell, who agreed to advance the Wailers money for an album and paid their fares back to Jamaica, where they recorded Catch a Fire. The album features nine songs, two of which were written and composed by Peter Tosh and the remaining seven of which were written and composed by Bob Marley. After Marley's return to London to present the tapes to Blackwell, the producer reworked the tracks with <b>contributions</b> <b>by</b> Muscle Shoals session musician Wayne Perkins, who played guitar on two overdubbed tracks.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the scale}} of the cyclone damage, the {{government}} issued an international appeal for assistance. As a result, the United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs provided a grant of $30,000. UNICEF provided about $48,000 to secure drug kits for children impacted by the cyclone. The Red Cross of Seychelles donated about one tonne of clothing and 20tonnes of tuna, and the Red Cross of Réunion sent drugs to Madagascar. The government of France also sent a crew from Réunion to Madagascar to assist in the aftermath, as well as a plane to airdrop the aid. The governments of Germany, Japan, France, the United Kingdom each donated about $100,000 to Madagascar, while the United States provided about $25,000 and 500tons of food. The government of Japan also sent 2,040blankets and 10tents. By February18, the total <b>contributions</b> <b>by</b> the international community reached about $3million.|$|E

5|$|Efforts to {{calculate}} the true economic value of unpaid work, which {{is not included in}} measures such as gross domestic product, have shown that this value is enormous. In the United States, it has been estimated to be between 20–50%, meaning that the true value of unpaid work is trillions of dollars per year. For other countries, the percentage of GDP may be even higher, such as the United Kingdom, where is may be as high as 70%. Because this unpaid work is largely done by women and is unreported in economic indicators, it results in these <b>contributions</b> <b>by</b> women being devalued in a society.|$|E

In 2010, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by Berklee College of Music in Boston, and performed at the Montreux Festival. However, he is known some years to select countries where he doesn't usually perform and played at Arena in Pula, Croatia in 2006 and 2010, and in Turkey, Morocco and Tunisia in 2013. He appeared at the 49th Carthage International Festival on 31 July, playing at the Roman Theatre.|$|E
5|$|Oryzomys couesi and {{at least}} six more {{narrowly}} distributed species with peripheral distributions together form the O.couesi group within the genus Oryzomys. The eighth species of the genus, the marsh rice rat (O.palustris) is {{the only member of}} its own group (unless western populations are classified as a separate species, O.texensis). Oryzomys previously included many other species, which were reclassified in various studies culminating in <b>contributions</b> <b>by</b> Marcelo Weksler and coworkers in 2006 that removed more than forty species from the genus. All are placed in the tribe Oryzomyini ("rice rats"), a diverse assemblage of over a hundred species, and on higher taxonomic levels in the subfamily Sigmodontinae of the family Cricetidae, along with hundreds of other species of mainly small rodents.|$|E

5|$|Plagis was the top-scoring Southern Rhodesian ace of the war, and the highest-scoring ace of Greek origin, with 16 {{confirmed}} aerial victories, including 11 over Malta. Awarded the Distinguished Service Order {{and other}} medals, {{he was also}} one of Rhodesia's most decorated veterans. The Southern Rhodesian capital, Salisbury, honoured his wartime <b>contributions</b> <b>by</b> naming a street in its northern Alexandra Park neighbourhood after him. On his return home after retiring from the RAF with the rank of wing commander in 1948, he set up home at 1John Plagis Avenue, opened a bottle store bearing his name, and was a director of several companies, including Central African Airways in the 1960s. He contested the Salisbury City constituency in the 1962 general election, running for the Rhodesian Front, but failed to win. He died in 1974, reportedly by suicide.|$|E
5|$|Targeted Killings: Law and Morality in an Asymmetrical World is a non-fiction {{compilation}} {{book about}} targeted killing edited by Claire Finkelstein, Jens David Ohlin, and Andrew Altman. It {{was published by}} Oxford University Press in 2012. The book grew out of <b>contributions</b> <b>by</b> the authors to a conference in April 2011 at the University of Pennsylvania Law School. Targeted Killings features eighteen essays in five sections arranged by topic. The work argues that after the 11 September attacks by Al-Qaeda in 2001, the United States and other countries {{began to see the}} tactic of targeted killing differently. The practice of targeted killing had previously been accepted in situations of self-defence in military settings; after 11 September 2001 it was used to kill non-combatants and those not directly involved in a particular armed force.|$|E
5|$|The genus Oryzomys {{currently}} includes {{about eight}} species distributed {{from the eastern}} United States (O.palustris) into northwestern South America (O.gorgasi). O.peninsulae {{is part of the}} O.couesi section, which is centered on the widespread Central American O.couesi and also includes various other species with more limited and peripheral distributions. Many aspects of the systematics of this section remain unclear and {{it is likely that the}} current classification underestimates the group's true diversity. Oryzomys was previously a much larger genus, but most species were progressively removed in various studies, culminating in <b>contributions</b> <b>by</b> Marcelo Weksler and coworkers in 2006 that excluded more than forty species from the genus. Oryzomys and many of the species removed from it are classified in the tribe Oryzomyini ("rice rats"), a diverse assemblage of American rodents of over a hundred species, and on higher taxonomic levels in the subfamily Sigmodontinae of family Cricetidae, along with hundreds of other species of mainly small rodents.|$|E
