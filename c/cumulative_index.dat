40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a new family of <b>cumulative</b> <b>indexes</b> for {{measuring}} scientific performance which can be applied to many metrics, including h index and its variants (here we apply it to the h index, h(2) index and Google Scholar’s i 10 index). These indexes follow the general principle of repeating the index calculation for the same publication set. Using bibliometric data and reviewer scores for accepted and rejected fellowship applicants we examine how valid the cumulative variant is compared to the original variant. These analyses showed that the <b>cumulative</b> <b>indexes</b> result in higher correlations with the reviewer scores than their original variants. Thus, the <b>cumulative</b> <b>indexes</b> better reflect the assessments by peers than the original variants and are useful extensions of the original indexes. In contrast to many other measures of scientific performance proposed up to now, the <b>cumulative</b> <b>indexes</b> seem not only to be effective, but they are also easy to understand and calculate...|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} two decades, {{numerous}} investigators have proposed <b>cumulative</b> vegetation <b>indices</b> (i. e., functions which encode {{the cumulative effect of}} NDVI maximum value composite time-series into a single variable) for net primary productivity (NPP) mapping and monitoring on a regional to continental basis. In this paper, we investigate the relationships among three of the most commonly used <b>cumulative</b> vegetation <b>indices,</b> expanding on the definition of equivalence of remotely sensed vegetation indices for decision making. We consider two <b>cumulative</b> vegetation <b>indices</b> as equivalent, if the value of one index is statistically predictable from the value of the other index. Using an annual time-series of broad-scale AVHRR NDVI monthly maximum value composites of the island of Corsica (France), we show that the pairwise linear association among the analysed <b>cumulative</b> vegetation <b>indices</b> shows coefficients of determination (R 2) higher than 0. 99. That is, knowing the value of one index is statistically equivalent to knowing the value of the other indices for application purposes.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} degree to which the <b>cumulative</b> risk <b>index</b> {{predicted}} school readiness in a Head Start population. In general, the reviewed studies indicated the cumulative risk model was efficacious in predicting adverse developmental outcomes. This study built on this literature by investigating how child, parent, and family risk factors predicted school readiness in Head Start children using two statistical models. Specific aims of this study included identifying 1) to what degree multiple predictors contributed to school readiness and 2) to what degree the <b>cumulative</b> risk <b>index</b> contributed to school readiness. Participants included 176 Head Start children ages 3 to 5 years. Data were analyzed using multivariate regression to determine if the cumulative risk model was a stronger predictor of school readiness than any risk factor in isolation. Hierarchical regression was also utilized to determine if individual risk factors contributed anything above and beyond the sum, the <b>cumulative</b> risk <b>index.</b> Multiple regression analysis revealed that older age and previous enrollment in Head Start predicted higher scores, while low income predicted lower scores, as did taking the test in Spanish. Analysis also revealed that higher scores on the <b>cumulative</b> risk <b>index</b> predicted lower test scores. The analysis revealed that the individual risk factors did not contribute to the model above and beyond the <b>cumulative</b> risk <b>index.</b> Adding the individual risk factors did not account for more variance than using gender, age, and the <b>cumulative</b> risk <b>index</b> as the only predictors. Similarly, the <b>cumulative</b> risk <b>index</b> did not account for more variance than using age and gender as the only predictors. The current study adds empirical support to the continued use of the cumulative risk model in predicting adverse developmental outcomes...|$|R
