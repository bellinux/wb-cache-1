25|$|Throughout the 19th century Delaware {{politics}} {{was characterized by}} a conservative downstate, agrarian and small business majority, in opposition to a Wilmington based industrialist minority. This majority was led into the Whig Party by John M. Clayton, but when that party broke up {{over the issue of}} slavery, generally moved over to a <b>conservative</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party.</b> As the sectional issues intensified with the coming of the Civil War, this majority became impossibly conflicted between its certain loyalty to the Union and its equally certain view that decisions about property, including slaves, belonged with the states. The result was first an effort by many to find a non-existent middle ground, and then, with a much diminished majority, entry into constant and bitter conflict with the Republican minority centered in Wilmington and supported by the Federal government.|$|E

These characterizations do not reflect the truth, and they sadden us." [...] Çelik added, [...] "The AKP is a <b>conservative</b> <b>democratic</b> <b>party.</b> The AKP's conservatism is limited to moral and social issues." [...] Also in a separate speech made in 2005, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan stated, [...] "We are not an Islamic party, and we also refuse labels such as Muslim-democrat."

2500|$|The Sandinistas were victorious in the {{national}} election of November 4, 1984, gathering 67% of the vote. The election was certified as [...] "free and fair" [...] {{by the majority of}} international observers. The Nicaraguan political opposition and the Reagan administration claimed political restrictions were placed on the opposition by the government. The primary opposition candidate was the U.S.-backed Arturo Cruz, who succumbed to pressure from the United States government not {{to take part in the}} 1984 elections; later US officials were quoted as saying, [...] "the (Reagan) Administration never contemplated letting Cruz stay in the race, because then the Sandinistas could justifiably claim that the elections were legitimate." [...] Other opposition parties such as the <b>Conservative</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> and the Independent Liberal party, were both free to denounce the Sandinista government and participate in the elections. Ortega was overwhelmingly elected President in 1984, but the long years of war had decimated Nicaragua's economy.|$|E

2500|$|In 1995, Šešelj and the SRS {{joined in}} a {{technical}} coalition with the centrist Democratic Party (DS) and the <b>conservative</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> of Serbia (DSS). This gave Šešelj a degree of democratic legitimacy, although the coalition withered away {{by the end of}} the same year. When Šešelj beat the SPS candidate for the 1997 presidential election, despite the contest being declared invalid due to low turnout, he was again brought into the Serbian government. In 1998 the SRS and SPO entered the so-called [...] "war" [...] government, and as Deputy Prime Minister, Šešelj passed new information laws and helped launch propaganda offensives against Kosovo Albanians. U.S. officials in turn branded him a [...] "fascist", while the U.S. Department of State declared that they would never deal with him. Following the 1999 NATO occupation of Kosovo, Šešelj resigned from government until his party was enticed to re-enter the administration by the SPS. As the party had held posts under Milošević's regime, it was excluded from the Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS), and suffered a major defeat in the 2000 parliamentary election when Milošević was ousted.|$|E
