30|$|The {{similarity}} {{in the total}} abundance of amino acids between the NASA/JSC <b>cabinet</b> <b>desiccator</b> boxes and our ISAS/JAXA clean chambers indicates that the contamination levels in both facilities were on a similar level. The difference in the common species of amino acids between the two facilities {{may be attributed to}} the origins of the contaminants. Through luminosity analysis, Dworkin et al. (2018) found that the total abundance on the NASA/JSC witness plates could not be explained only by the presence of viable cells on the witness plates. Thus, several other organic materials in the cleanroom could also have been the source of the amino acids.|$|E
30|$|The {{species and}} the {{abundance}} of amino acids on our witness coupons are similar to what was found on those reported by the NASA/JSC OSIRIS-REx team (Dworkin et al. 2018; McLain et al., 2015, Contamination Knowledge Report JSC Curation Cabinets, personal communication). The NASA/JSC OSIRIS-REx team investigated the contamination level of <b>cabinet</b> <b>desiccator</b> boxes located in an ISO 7 cleanroom at Johnson Space Center (JSC) that were reserved for the storage of OSIRIS-REx-returned samples. The desiccator boxes were purged with curation-grade nitrogen gas, and they analysed a set of Al foil witness plates (10  cm 2 each) that {{were placed in the}} <b>cabinet</b> <b>desiccator</b> for 1 – 365  days. Glycine and alanine were found to be the most abundant amino acids on their witness plates, consistent with the findings in our study. Serine was also a common amino acid detected on their witness plates, but it was not found on our witness coupons. Instead, aspartic acid and glutamic acid were major species found on our witness coupons, which were not common on their witness plates. The total abundance of amino acids in weight ranged from 0.05 to 0.8  ng/cm 2 for their witness plates, and ours were also in the same range (0.3 to 1.2  ng/cm 2, blank-corrected). They also reported that the lowest total abundance was on the 365 -day witness plate and the highest abundance was detected on the 120 -day witness plate, and thus, the abundance did not correlate with the exposure time. This observation may correspond to our results that the day 31 witness coupon showed the lowest total concentration. An explanation for this is that any contamination materials may have been blown away by the gases in the chamber when they accumulated beyond a certain amount.|$|E
