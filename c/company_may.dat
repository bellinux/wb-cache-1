5|$|Although the {{majority}} of LMAs involve the outsourcing of one television station's operations to another, occasionally, a <b>company</b> <b>may</b> operate a station under an LMA, JSA or SSA {{even if it does}} not already own a station in that market. One example occurred in December 2013, when the Louisiana Media Company (owned by New Orleans Saints and New Orleans Hornets owner Tom Benson) entered into a shared services agreement with Raycom Media to run the former company's Fox affiliate in New Orleans, Louisiana, WVUE-DT; while Louisiana Media Company retained the station's ownership and license, other assets were assumed by Raycom, which owns stations in markets adjacent to New Orleans (including Baton Rouge, Jackson, Biloxi, Lake Charles and Shreveport) but not within New Orleans itself. Benson had received offers from Raycom and others to buy the station, but was not prepared to sell WVUE outright.|$|E
5|$|Creatures are {{attracted}} via Portals. Which ones come {{depend on the}} dungeon's composition. Each has its own abilities (such as spells they can cast), expertise, and job preferences. Creatures include Bile Demons, Warlocks, and Salamanders. Like the first game, creatures can be slapped with the hand to make them work harder, {{at the cost of}} their health. Certain creatures, such as Vampires and Skeletons cannot be attracted via Portals. They are obtained by their corpse decomposing in a Graveyard, and dying in captivity respectively. Certain sacrifices in the Temple, a room where creatures pray, also yield the acquisition of certain creatures. Creatures frequently enter combat (each follow one of four combat strategies) against creatures belonging to enemy keepers, or heroic forces defending the realm. Heroes enter the level via Hero Gates. The heroics forces are composed of different units to keepers: heroes include Wizards, Giants, and Guards. Most creatures have a heroic counterpart: for example, the Wizard is the counterpart of the Warlock. Heroes and rival keepers' creatures can be converted to the player's cause in the torture chamber after being captured and imprisoned. Creatures dislike their heroic counterparts, and their <b>company</b> <b>may</b> make them angry, which can lead to rebellions. Rebelling creatures either leave the dungeon, or defect to another keeper or the heroes, and may take other creatures too. Other things that can annoy creatures and cause rebellions include lack of food, not getting paid (creatures require payment on a regular basis), and being slapped.|$|E
5|$|Roland {{was born}} on 26 January 1899 and {{initially}} followed {{a career in the}} army. He married Sonia Rosemary Keppel on 16 November 1920 and they had three children: two sons, Henry and Jeremy (1927–1958); and a daughter, Rosalind. Death duties and the Second World War impacted greatly on the estate: staffing was a problem, and maintenance and general repair costs were unsustainable. The Home Guard requisitioned a section of the mansion as its headquarters and based a training school there. Hugh Pollock, husband of the author Enid Blyton, re-ignited his adulterous affair with Ida Crowe after arranging work there for her as a civilian secretary. Roland transformed the buildings that had previously been used as housing for the garden and stable staff into a Regency-style house. Flooring and doors were stripped from the old mansion to be incorporated in the new house, leaving just the basic structure of Cubitt's original mansion, which had been empty since 1947. Furniture was disposed of in a clearance sale at Dorking in mid-July 1952. Cubitt's mansion was within a designated preservation area, causing the local council to refuse any suggestions that were put forward for the old mansion to be used for commercial purposes. Contractors were brought in to demolish the mansion in 1953; the <b>company</b> <b>may</b> have encountered financial problems, as the basement was not fully destroyed and was left filled with rubble from the higher levels.|$|E

25|$|The {{consistently}} revenue-generating {{part of the}} <b>company</b> <b>may</b> have a {{much higher}} credit rating than the company as a whole. For instance, a leasing <b>company</b> <b>may</b> have provided $10m nominal value of leases, and it will receive a cash flow {{over the next five}} years from these. It cannot demand early repayment on the leases and so cannot get its money back early if required. If it could sell the rights to the cash flows from the leases to someone else, it could transform that income stream into a lump sum today (in effect, receiving today the present value of a future cash flow). Where the originator is a bank or other organization that must meet capital adequacy requirements, the structure is usually more complex because a separate company is set up to buy the assets.|$|E

25|$|Capt. John Mott's <b>company</b> <b>may</b> {{have been}} {{involved}} in the Second Battle of Trenton, but it is not clear. It is possible that he and his men were at the battle and remained at Trenton (due to their knowledge of the area), allowing Gen. Washington and the army to march towards Princeton, New Jersey. Capt Mott's <b>company</b> <b>may</b> have then crossed back over the Delaware River. His company was apparently not at the Battle of Princeton since they were on the Pennsylvania side of the Delaware River guarding the baggage wagons and supplies. As part of the foraging war in early 1777, Capt. Mott and his company were in the 1st Hunterdon Regiment under Col. Joseph Phillips. They helped Gen. Dickinson harass the British coming out of New Brunswick, New Jersey foraging for food and supplies.|$|E
