40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the feasibility of}} using datalink communication for convective weather reroutes in the National Airspace System. Flight trajectories from a day in 2006 were surveyed for weather avoidance re-routes, and those route amendments were assessed to determine the proportion that could be satisfied by existing Controller-Pilot Data Link Communication protocols {{and the number of}} datalink messages needed to satisfy the clearance issued. All 753 clearances could be described by a datalink message. The messages were grouped into four categories: deviation, heading, route clearance, and offset. Fifty-two percent of the weather avoidance maneuvers were satisfied by a deviation message. Deviation datalink messages are easy to load, send, and receive for both the controller and pilot. Some form of a heading message satisfied 25 % of the clearances, and 17 % could be described by a route <b>clearance</b> <b>message.</b> The remaining 6 % were satisfied by an offset. The results identify the specific datalink messages that should be considered in the development of weather avoidance automation. I...|$|E
40|$|Results of a piloted {{simulation}} {{study are}} presented in which a simulated aircraft, with no data link equipment, received air traffic control (ATC) <b>clearance</b> <b>messages</b> over the conventional voice radio. The study resulted in pilot acceptance and message transaction times which compare favorably to previously documented simulation-study measurements of data-link message transactions. It is suggested that this concept could {{make it possible for}} air traffic controllers to use a data-link interface for communicating with both data-link equipped and unequipped aircraft...|$|R
40|$|Clearance of {{commercial}} import consignments {{can be arranged}} by an appointed Customs broker (agent) or by the owner. Private importers who wish to clear their own goods should contact the nearest Customs Service offi ce for advice on requirements and operating hours. ISSN 1175 - 396 X Why do I need a Customs clearance for imported goods? All imported goods arriving in New Zealand are {{required by law to}} be cleared through the New Zealand Customs Service. Imported goods are subject to security requirements and the payment of import duty and GST charges. Customs undertakes security screening and collects revenue charges on behalf of the New Zealand Government. What is a Customs clearance? A Customs import clearance refers to the procedure where the importer of the goods is required to lodge an electronic declaration (import entry) covering the particulars of their imported goods, the payment of any revenue charges due and subsequent formal release of those goods by Customs. What is the procedure for clearing commercial import consignments? An electronic entry must be lodged, either over the Internet at www. customsentry. govt. nz, or using EDI (Electronic Data Interchange) software. In some cases, importers may also be asked to provide additional information such as: • An airwaybill or bill of lading. • Invoices. • Other documents, such as packing lists, or insurance certificates. Importers may also need to contact shipping companies, airlines or freight forwarders for advice on their requirements, operating hours and/or location of the goods. How do I lodge a Customs import entry? Import entries may be lodged over the Internet or via EDI. Many importers use their freight forwarder or a Customs broker to lodge import clearances on their behalf, as they generally already have EDI software, and are familiar with Customs legal requirements. Using EDI EDI users are required to: • Develop or purchase EDI software which contains features necessary to transmit <b>clearance</b> <b>messages</b> and receive responses. • Test proper functionality with Customs prior to use. • Pay for the EDI link and associated messaging costs. Thus EDI is generally more suitable for higher-frequency users. For further information on EDI requirements, refer to the Customs website www. customs. govt. nz under Exporters/Customs Requirements/Clearance o...|$|R
40|$|SESAR) {{concepts}} {{require an}} {{increased use of}} trajectory-based operations, including extensive strategic air traffic control clearances. The clearances can be lengthy and complex, which necessitates data link communications to allow for message permanence and integration into the autoflight systems (i. e., “autoload ” capability). This paper examines the use of flight deck data link communications for strategic and tactical clearance usage in the terminal area. A human-in-the-loop simulation was conducted using a high-fidelity flight deck simulator, with ten commercial flight crews as participants. Data were collected from six flight scenarios in the San Francisco terminal airspace. The variables of interest were ATC message modality (voice v. data link), temporal aspect of the message (tactical v. strategic) and message length. Dependent variables were message response times, communication clarifications, communication-related errors, and pilot workload. Response time results were longer in data link compared to voice, a finding that has been consistently revealed {{in a number of}} other simulations [1]. In addition, strategic <b>clearances</b> and longer <b>messages</b> resulted in a greater number of clarifications and errors, suggesting an increase in uncertainty of message interpretation for the flight crews when compared to tactical clearances. The implications for strategic and compound clearance usage in NextGen and SESAR are discussed...|$|R
