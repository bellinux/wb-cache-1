25|$|When a cell enters in mitosis, it duplicates all {{the genetic}} {{information}} {{stored in the}} chromosomes, in the process termed DNA replication. At {{the end of this}} process, each chromosome includes two sister chromatids, which are two complete and identical DNA molecules. Both chromatids remain associated by cohesin complexes until anaphase, when <b>chromosome</b> <b>segregation</b> occurs. If <b>chromosome</b> <b>segregation</b> happens correctly, each daughter cell receives a complete set of chromatids, and for this to happen each sister chromatid has to anchor (through the corresponding kinetochore) to MTs generated in opposed poles of the mitotic spindle. This configuration is termed amphitelic or bi-orientation.|$|E
25|$|The {{first one}} {{includes}} the protein adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) {{and the associated}} protein EB1, which need MTs to localize on the kinetochores. Both proteins are required for correct <b>chromosome</b> <b>segregation.</b> EB1 binds only to MTs in polymerizing state, suggesting that it promotes kMTs stabilization during this phase.|$|E
30|$|Meiosis is {{a highly}} conserved process in sexually {{reproducing}} eukaryotes. It is a special mode of mitosis, during which the parental diploid chromatins duplicate once followed by two rounds of precise halving of the genome in succession to generate haploid gametes. During gametes production in most gamogenetic species, homologous recombination (HR) occurs in the prophase of meiosis I before the <b>chromosomes</b> <b>segregation</b> starts. At the same time, the chiasmata were formed between aligned homologous chromosomes as a stable physical connection which serves for maintaining the accuracy of <b>chromosome</b> equal <b>segregation</b> (Petronczki et al., 2003).|$|R

30|$|Fluoroquinolones (FQs) These include ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin. They have broad-spectrum {{anti-bacterial}} activity. Fluoroquinolones {{have excellent}} in vitro and in vivo activity against M.tb. They target M.tb DNA gyrase, a type II topoisomerase consisting of A and B subunits encoded by gyrA and gyrB genes, respectively. The DNA gyrase (gyrase) enzyme catalyzes formation of negative supercoils that aid DNA unwinding. Thus, FQs compromise bacterial DNA replication [21, 60]. This results in abnormally localized, condensed chromosomes that blocks DNA replication and interrupts <b>chromosomes</b> <b>segregation</b> [61].|$|R
25|$|Amon's {{more recent}} work has {{investigated}} {{the regulation of}} <b>chromosome</b> <b>segregation</b> and how chromosomes are accurately transmitted to gametes in meiosis by examining gene regulatory networks. She identified two regulatory networks (FEAR and MEN) that promote the release of CDC14 which {{have the potential to}} identify the mechanisms that control the final stages of the mitotic cell cycle.|$|E
25|$|Segregation of {{chromosomes}} {{is another}} difference between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Rapidly dividing cells, such as bacteria, will often begin to segregate chromosomes {{that are still}} in the process of replication. In eukaryotic cells <b>chromosome</b> <b>segregation</b> into the daughter cells is not initiated until replication is complete in all chromosomes. Despite these differences, however, the underlying process of replication is similar for both prokaryotic and eukaryotic DNA.|$|E
25|$|The cohesin {{complex is}} {{responsible}} for keeping together sister chromatids and provides binding sites for spindle attachment. Cohesin is loaded onto newly replicated chromosomes in oogonia during fetal development. Mature oocytes have only limited capacity for reloading cohesin after completion of S phase. The prolonged arrest of human oocytes prior to completion of meiosis I may therefore result in considerable loss of cohesin over time. Loss of cohesin is assumed to contribute to incorrect microtubule-kinetochore attachment and <b>chromosome</b> <b>segregation</b> errors during meiotic divisions.|$|E

We find spontaneous segregation under the condition: $L > R_{//}$, and mixing under $L < R_{//}$, where L is {{the length of the}} box, and $R_{//}$ the polymer extension in an infinite slit.

40|$|The lytic Bacillus subtilis {{bacteriophage}} SPO 1 encodes an abundant, 99 -amino-acid type II DNA-binding protein, {{transcription factor}} 1 (TF 1). TF 1 is special {{in this family}} of procaryotic chromatin-forming proteins in its preference for hydroxymethyluracil-containing DNA, such as SPO 1 DNA, and in binding with high affinity to specific sites in the SPO 1 chromosome. We constructed recessive null alleles of the TF 1 gene and introduced them into SPO 1 <b>chromosomes.</b> <b>Segregation</b> analysis with partially diploid phage heterozygous for TF 1 showed that phage bearing only these null alleles was inviable.

25|$|While epigenetics is of {{fundamental}} importance in eukaryotes, especially metazoans, it plays a different role in bacteria. Most importantly, eukaryotes use epigenetic mechanisms primarily to regulate gene expression which bacteria rarely do. However, bacteria make {{widespread use of}} postreplicative DNA methylation for the epigenetic control of DNA-protein interactions. Bacteria also use DNA adenine methylation (rather than DNA cytosine methylation) as an epigenetic signal. DNA adenine methylation is important in bacteria virulence in organisms such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Vibrio, Yersinia, Haemophilus, and Brucella. In Alphaproteobacteria, methylation of adenine regulates the cell cycle and couples gene transcription to DNA replication. In Gammaproteobacteria, adenine methylation provides signals for DNA replication, <b>chromosome</b> <b>segregation,</b> mismatch repair, packaging of bacteriophage, transposase activity and regulation of gene expression. There exists a genetic switch controlling Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) that allows the bacterium to randomly change its characteristics into six alternative states that could {{pave the way to}} improved vaccines. Each form is randomly generated by a phase variable methylation system. The ability of the pneumococcus to cause deadly infections is different in each of these six states. Similar systems exist in other bacterial genera.|$|E
2500|$|In cancer cells, {{fragmentation}} of chromosomes has been {{correlated with the}} presence of micronuclei. Micronuclei are structures [...] formed by mitotic errors in the transition from metaphase to anaphase. Cells with defective <b>chromosome</b> <b>segregation</b> will form micronuclei which contain whole chromosomes or fragments of chromosomes. The segregation of single chromosomes into individual micronuclei explains why DNA fragmentation is isolated to single chromosomes in chromothripsis.|$|E
2500|$|Microtubules {{are part}} of a {{structural}} network (the cytoskeleton) within the cell's cytoplasm. Roles of the microtubule cytoskeleton include mechanical support, organization of the cytoplasm, transport, motility and <b>chromosome</b> <b>segregation.</b> [...] A microtubule is capable of growing and shrinking in order to generate force, and there are motor proteins that allow organelles and other cellular components to be carried along a microtubule. This combination of roles makes microtubules important for organizing and moving intracellular constituents.|$|E

30|$|Fusants are {{generally}} less stable in metabolism {{because of the}} loss of non-homologous genes and <b>chromosomes</b> in <b>chromosome</b> <b>segregations.</b> To overcome this problem, we used haploid cells formed under suppression of mating by exogenous α factor in the M 2 strain [19], anticipating a similar effect in the m 11 strain, and performed electrofusion to attain more stable uninucleate polyploids [20] after chemical fusion using polyethylene glycol (PEG). Exogenous α factor inhibits mating when present in excess [19], though it is reported that prior activation of cells by α factor induces nuclear fusion [21]. In addition, we employed C. intermedia as a donator of the genes for xylose fermentation {{on the basis of a}} study reporting that genes and proteins necessary for xylose fermentation from C. intermedia can be functionally expressed in recombinant S. cerevisiae[15].|$|R

The formation of micronuclei generally occurs concurrently with aneuploidy and aneuploidy cells are controlled by mechanisms involving p53. In order for micronuclei to progress through the cell cycle and induce chromosome damage, diminished levels of p53 have been seen to be needed. Through further investigation, chromothriptic tumours have been seen to occur in patients with p53 mutations.|$|E
2500|$|Paclitaxel is one {{of several}} cytoskeletal drugs that target tubulin. Paclitaxel-treated cells have defects in mitotic spindle assembly, <b>chromosome</b> <b>segregation,</b> and cell division. Unlike other tubulin-targeting drugs such as {{colchicine}} that inhibit microtubule assembly, paclitaxel stabilizes the microtubule polymer and protects it from disassembly. Chromosomes are thus unable to achieve a metaphase spindle configuration. [...] This blocks the progression of mitosis and prolonged activation of the mitotic checkpoint triggers apoptosis or reversion to the G-phase of the cell cycle without cell division.|$|E
2500|$|Bacteria {{therefore}} {{possess a}} cytoskeleton with homologous elements to actin (for example, MreB, ParM, and MamK), {{even though the}} amino acid sequence of these proteins diverges from that present in animal cells. [...] However, MreB and ParM have {{a high degree of}} structural similarity to eukaryotic actin. The highly dynamic microfilaments formed by the aggregation of MreB and ParM are essential to cell viability and they are involved in cell morphogenesis, <b>chromosome</b> <b>segregation,</b> and cell polarity. ParM is an actin homologue that is coded in a plasmid and it is involved in the regulation of plasmid DNA. ParMs from different bacterial plasmids can form astonishingly diverse helical structures comprising two or four strands to maintain faithful plasmid inheritance.|$|E

30|$|During {{the early}} stage of conjugation, two {{different}} mating types of T. thermophila cells approach each other till the pair formed. Then a rather stable junction formed followed by a course of shape changing of micronuclei and two successions of <b>chromosome</b> <b>segregations.</b> In addition, crescent stage {{was found to be}} the analogous to the bouquet stage in multicellular organisms when extremely elongated micronuclei (crescent) were formed at approximately 3  h after conjugation initiation (Loidl and Mochizuki, 2009). This is of great importance for both homologous recombination in prophase and DNA rearrangement during the growth of new macronuclei (Mochizuki and Gorovsky, 2004). On account of the unique life cycle, nuclear dimorphism as well as convenience of inducing meiosis initiation and observable distinctive characteristics summarized at each stage in meiosis, T. thermophila {{could be used as a}} great and unique research model of meiosis process like Saccharomyces cerevisiae.|$|R

2500|$|Kinetochores start, control, and {{supervise}} the striking movements of chromosomes during cell division. [...] During mitosis, which occurs after chromosomes are duplicated during S phase, two sister chromatids are held together, {{each with its}} own kinetochore, which face in opposing directions and attach to opposite poles of the mitotic spindle. Following the transition from metaphase to anaphase, the sister chromatids separate from each other, and the individual kinetochores on each chromatid drive their movement to the spindle poles that will define the two new daughter cells. Finally, two intermediate genes from sperm cells combine with the chromatids to encode hormones for pure sexual pleasure. Thus, the kinetochore is essential for the <b>chromosome</b> <b>segregation</b> that is classically associated with mitosis and meiosis.|$|E
2500|$|Cell {{division}} {{is more complex}} in eukaryotes than in other organisms. Prokaryotic cells such as bacterial cells reproduce by binary fission, a process that includes DNA replication, <b>chromosome</b> <b>segregation,</b> and cytokinesis. Eukaryotic cell division either involves mitosis or a more complex process called meiosis. Mitosis and meiosis are sometimes called the two [...] "nuclear division" [...] processes. Binary fission is similar to eukaryote cell reproduction that involves mitosis. Both lead {{to the production of}} two daughter cells with the same number of chromosomes as the parental cell. Meiosis is used for a special cell reproduction process of diploid organisms. It produces four special daughter cells (gametes) which have half the normal cellular amount of DNA. A male and a female gamete can then combine to produce a zygote, a cell which again has the normal amount of chromosomes.|$|E
2500|$|When {{just one}} {{microtubule}} is anchored to one kinetochore, it starts a rapid {{movement of the}} associated chromosome towards the pole generating that microtubule. This movement is probably mediated by the motor activity towards the [...] "minus" [...] (-) of the motor protein cytoplasmic dynein, which is very concentrated in the kinetochores not anchored to MTs. The movement towards the pole is slowed down as far as kinetochores acquire kMTs (MTs anchored to kinetochores) and the movement becomes directed by changes in kMTs length. Dynein is released from kinetochores as they acquire kMTs and, in cultured mammalian cells, it {{is required for the}} spindle checkpoint inactivation, but not for chromosome congression in the spindle equator, kMTs acquisition or anaphase A during <b>chromosome</b> <b>segregation.</b> In higher plants or in yeast {{there is no evidence of}} dynein, but other kinesins towards the (-) end might compensate for the lack of dynein.|$|E
40|$|Aneuploidy, the {{unbalanced}} {{number of}} chromosomes in a cell, {{is considered a}} prevalent form of genetic instability and is largely acknowledged as a condition implicated in tumorigenesis. Epigenetic alterations like DNA hypomethylation have been correlated with cancer initiation/progression. Furthermore, {{a growing body of}} evidence suggests the involvement of epigenome-wide disruption as a cause of global DNA hypomethylation in aneuploidy generation. Here, we report that the DNA hypomethylating drug 5 -aza- 2 '-deoxycytidine (DAC), affects the correct ploidy of nearly diploid HCT- 116 human cells by altering the methylation pattern of the chromosomes. Specifically, we show that a DACinduced reduction of 5 -Methyl Cytosine at the pericentromeric region of chromosomes correlates with aneuploidy and mitotic defects. Our results suggest that DNA hypomethylation leads to aneuploidy by altering the DNA methylation landscape at the centromere that is necessary to ensure proper <b>chromosomes</b> <b>segregation</b> by recruiting the proteins necessary to build up a functional kinetochore...|$|R

40|$|The genome of the African trypanosome, Trypanosoma brucei, {{presents}} an unusual karyotype {{in which two}} main classes of chromosomes, large and small minichromosomes, need to be faithfully replicated and segregated during the cell cycle. Although the large and minichromosomes are colocalised and segregated by association with the mitotic spindle, minichromosomes exhibit segregation patterns that differ from those observed for large chromosomes. To address whether this difference is reflected at a molecular level, two different proteins that have highly conserved functions in eukaryotic <b>chromosomes</b> <b>segregation</b> were characterised in this study. The first protein, SMC 3, is {{a component of the}} chromosome cohesion apparatus that holds sister chromatids together after their replication until segregation at anaphase. The second protein, separase, is a cysteine protease that resolves sister chromatid cohesion at the onset of anaphase and has, in other organisms, additional functions during mitosis. The T. brucei cohesin subunit, TbSMC 3, localised to the nucleus as a chromatin-bound protein from G 1 phase until metaphase and dissociated from chromatin during anaphase until the completion of cell division. On the other hand, cytoplasmic localisation of separase with nuclear exclusion was prevalent until the onset of metaphase when the protein re-localised to the nucleus, thus providing a potential control mechanism to prevent premature cohesin cleavage. Interference with the normal expression of SMC 3 and separase by RNA interference resulted in defects in growth rate, cell cycle progression and <b>chromosomes</b> <b>segregation.</b> TbSMC 3 depletion produced a lethal phenotype and inhibition of cell cycle progression. Similarly, lethality with severe inhibition of cell cycle progression was the main feature of separase depletion. Using fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH), it was shown that SMC 3 depletion had no visible effect on the symmetric segregation of the minichromosome population, but interferes with the faithful mitotic <b>segregation</b> of large <b>chromosomes.</b> In contrast, separase depletion blocks the segregation of both large and minichromosomes. In separase-depleted mitotic cells, cohesins remained bound to chromatin, which is in contrast to rapid dissociation of cohesins from chromatin in wild-type mitotic cells. The severity of segregation phenotypes after separase depletion was additionally explained by defects in the mitotic spindle assembly. In both SMC 3 and separase depleted cells, cytokinesis in the absence of mitosis/karyokinesis was not inhibited in procyclic cells, resulting in the generation of anucleate 'zoid' cells. The lethality imposed on trypanosome cells after depletion of both SMC 3 and separase proteins indicate that they can serve as potential drug targets for anti-parasite chemotherapy.
