50|$|The {{stiffeners}} of an isogrid {{are generally}} machined {{from a single}} sheet of material with a <b>CNC</b> <b>milling</b> <b>machine,</b> but a thickness less than 0.040 in. (1.0 millimeter) requires chemical milling processes.|$|E

50|$|Hobby {{injection}} molding machines, {{also known as}} benchtop injectors, hold molds on a smaller scale. Benchtop injectors have become more common as inexpensive <b>CNC</b> <b>milling</b> <b>machines</b> have reduced the cost of producing molds in a home workshop.|$|R
50|$|It is {{not known}} when the first hobby {{injection}} molder was constructed. Before the development of inexpensive <b>CNC</b> <b>milling</b> <b>machines,</b> producing a metal mold was prohibitively expensive for most hobbyists.

40|$|Milling is the {{mechanical}} process of removing material from {{a piece of}} stock {{through the use of}} a rapidly spinning circular milling tool in order to form some desired geometric shape. An important problem in computer-aided design and manufacturing is the automated generation of efficient milling plans for computerized numerically controlled (<b>CNC)</b> <b>milling</b> <b>machines.</b> Among the most common milling problems is simple 2 -dimensional pocket milling: cut a given 2 -dimensional region down to some constant depth using a given set of milling tools. Most of the research in this area has focused on generating such milling plans assuming that the machine has a tool of a single size. Since modern <b>CNC</b> <b>milling</b> <b>machines</b> typically have access to a number of milling tools of various sizes and the ability to change tools automatically, this raises the important optimization problem of generating efficient milling plans that take advantage of this capabilit...|$|R

50|$|Freeform {{surface or}} complex {{surfaces}} are widely manufactured nowadays. The industries which most often manufactures free-form surfaces are basically aerospace, automotive, die mold industries, bio medical and power sector for turbine blades manufacturing. Generally 3 or 5 axis <b>CNC</b> <b>milling</b> <b>machine</b> {{is used for}} this purpose. The manufacturing process of free form surface {{is not an easy}} job as the tool path generation in present CAM technology is generally based on geometric computation so tool path are not optimum. The geometry can also be not described explicitly so errors and discontinuities occurrence in the solid structure cannot be avoided. Free-form surfaces are machined with the help of different tool path generation method like adaptive iso-planar tool path generation, constant scallop tool path generation, adaptive iso-parametric method, iso-curvature, isophote and by other methods. The different methods are chosen based on the parameters which is needed to be optimized.|$|E
5000|$|The X-Mag was {{basically}} the same marker as the E-Mag electronically, except it also included the ACE(Anti-Chop Eye). The components included the original introduction of the X-Valve, originally engraved with an XMag symbol, and now just an X. It wasn't always called the X-Mag. It originally was called the Emag Extreem which later became X-Mag for short. The body of the X-Mag was a single piece instead of the body-rail combo that all previous AGD mags used. The main feature of the X-Mag, besides the one-piece body, was the removable breeches, which allowed users to change the feed port from center feed to warpfeed left or warpfeed right. There were some rare colors produced just as in every previous run. Magma and Placenta {{were two of the}} colors that had runs of 3 or less. The original X-Mag was considered somewhat [...] "blocky-looking," [...] so AGD ran the body through a computer controlled <b>CNC</b> <b>milling</b> <b>machine.</b> The result was a lighter, more attractive marker named the C&C X-Mag.|$|E
50|$|Non-IT-assisted {{physical}} guidance was {{the first}} means of providing indexing capability, via purely mechanical means. It allowed the Industrial Revolution to progress into the Machine Age. It is achieved by jigs, fixtures, and machine tool parts and accessories, which control toolpath by {{the very nature of}} their shape, physically limiting the path for motion. Some archetypal examples, developed to perfection before the advent of the IT era, are , the turrets on manual turret lathes, indexing heads for manual milling machines, rotary tables, and various indexing fixtures and blocks that are simpler and less expensive than indexing heads, and serve quite well for most indexing needs in small shops. Although indexing heads of the pre-CNC era are now mostly obsolete in commercial manufacturing, the principle of purely mechanical indexing is still a vital part of current technology, in concert with IT, even as it has been extended to newer uses, such as the indexing of <b>CNC</b> <b>milling</b> <b>machine</b> toolholders or of indexable cutter inserts, whose precisely controlled size and shape allows them to be rotated or replaced quickly and easily without changing overall tool geometry.|$|E

50|$|Most <b>CNC</b> <b>milling</b> <b>machines</b> (also called {{machining}} centers) are {{computer controlled}} vertical mills {{with the ability}} to move the spindle vertically along the Z-axis. This extra degree of freedom permits their use in diesinking, engraving applications, and 2.5D surfaces such as relief sculptures. When combined with the use of conical tools or a ball nose cutter, it also significantly improves milling precision without impacting speed, providing a cost-efficient alternative to most flat-surface hand-engraving work.|$|R
