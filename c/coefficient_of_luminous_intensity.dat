40|$|The last CCPR intercomparison in 1985 showed {{variations}} of #+-# 1 % in the units <b>of</b> <b>luminous</b> <b>intensity</b> (candela) and <b>luminous</b> flux (lumen) maintained by 14 and 10 participating laboratories, respectively. Meanwhile, the BIPM (Bureau International des Poids et Mesures) {{and some of}} the participating laboratories changed their units, as reported by BIPM. Therefore, VNIIOFI and PTB have an interest in the cooperation on important scientific work in photometry, and this also provides the framework for this bilateral intercomparison. Measurements were carried out at both laboratories to compare the values <b>of</b> <b>luminous</b> <b>intensity,</b> photometric responsivity and luminous flux assigned to artifacts. At VNIIOFI the primary standard <b>of</b> <b>luminous</b> <b>intensity</b> is a high-temperature blackbody. Its temperature is determined by help of a non-selective cavity radiometer. A (primary) photometer with a liquid V(#lambda#) -correcting filter transfers the unit to a group <b>of</b> <b>luminous</b> <b>intensity</b> standard lamps, which are used for the maintenance of the unit. At present, <b>luminous</b> <b>intensity</b> and illuminance calibrations at VNIIOFI are carried out as substitution method with groups of standard lamps and V(#lambda#) -corrected (silicon) photometers. The luminous flux calibrations are carried out by means of a group <b>of</b> <b>luminous</b> flux reference standard lamps and a 2 -meter integrating sphere. The value <b>of</b> <b>luminous</b> flux was established during bilateral comparisons with the BIPM, 1990 and the CSIRO (Australia, 1991). At PTB, the photometric base unit <b>of</b> <b>luminous</b> <b>intensity</b> is realised annually based on radiometric power measurements with absolute radiometers. The unit is maintained by groups of incandescent lamps. In any case, the maintained unit was within the uncertainty range of the realisations and no adjustments were carried out within the last decade. The luminous flux unit is derived fundamentally from the <b>luminous</b> <b>intensity</b> unit by goniophotometric methods and maintained by incandescent lamps. The magnitude of all photometric units have remained unchanged at PTB since the CCPR intercomparison in 1985. (orig.)

5000|$|The candela {{per square}} metre (cd/m2) is the derived SI unit of luminance. The unit {{is based on}} the candela, the SI unit <b>of</b> <b>luminous</b> <b>intensity,</b> and the square metre, the SI unit of area.|$|R
50|$|The number 683 is {{connected}} to the modern (1979) definition of the candela, the unit <b>of</b> <b>luminous</b> <b>intensity.</b> This arbitrary number made the new definition give numbers equivalent to those from the old definition of the candela.|$|R
50|$|In photometry, <b>luminous</b> <b>intensity</b> is {{a measure}} of the wavelength-weighted power emitted by a light source in a {{particular}} direction per unit solid angle, based on the luminosity function, a standardized model of the sensitivity of the human eye. The SI unit <b>of</b> <b>luminous</b> <b>intensity</b> is the candela (cd), an SI base unit.|$|R
50|$|The SI unit <b>of</b> <b>luminous</b> flux is the lumen (lm). One lumen {{is defined}} as the <b>luminous</b> flux <b>of</b> light {{produced}} by a light source that emits one candela <b>of</b> <b>luminous</b> <b>intensity</b> over a solid angle of one steradian.

25|$|The candela (cd) is the SI unit <b>of</b> <b>luminous</b> <b>intensity,</b> that {{is power}} per unit solid angle {{in a given}} direction, {{weighted}} according to {{the sensitivity of the}} human eye to various colours of light. A typical candle produces light with about 1 candela <b>of</b> <b>luminous</b> <b>intensity</b> in all directions. A lamp can produce higher <b>luminous</b> <b>intensity</b> either by producing more light, or by focusing it tighter. The <b>luminous</b> <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> a light depends on many factors, including the colour of the light and the eye's sensitivity to that colour, the optics involved, reflector and lens. Despite its complexity, it is a more useful measure than watts, because it defines how much usable light is shed in a given place: a dynamo headlight designed for road use and focused for seeing the road makes more efficient use {{of the power of the}} lamp than lights using rotationally symmetrical optics.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: In vivo {{reflectance}} confocal microscopy (IVCM) is a {{new tool}} for skin microcirculation. However, the measure of quantitative blood cell flow (QBCF) has not been standardized. We studied the inter-investigator and the intra-capillary reproducibility of the manual measure of QBCF on IVCM videos and investigated if a software program might help measure QBCF and be sensitive to vascular occlusion tests. METHODS: The inter-investigator reproducibility of the manual QBCF was evaluated on 107 videos. The intra-capillary reproducibility of QBCF measured manually and by 2 semi-automatic procedures based on Image J software analysis was evaluated on 19 capillaries. One of the semi-automatic methods (peaks <b>of</b> <b>luminous</b> <b>intensity)</b> was also {{used to measure the}} QBCF during vascular occlusion tests. RESULTS: The manual measure did not show a good inter-investigator reproducibility (Pearson's coefficient < 0. 5). The 'peaks <b>of</b> <b>luminous</b> intensity' method was found to have a good intra-capillary reproducibility and to be sensitive to vascular occlusion. CONCLUSION: Differently from the manual count, the count <b>of</b> peaks <b>of</b> <b>luminous</b> <b>intensity</b> by Image J software seems to be promising to measure QBCF. The future is to create software allowing for real-time measure of the QBCF based on the peaks <b>of</b> <b>luminous</b> <b>intensity</b> inside the capillaries recorded by IVCM...|$|R

5|$|Proposed definition: The candela, symbol cd, is the SI unit <b>of</b> <b>luminous</b> <b>intensity</b> {{in a given}} direction.

50|$|If a {{light source}} emits one candela <b>of</b> <b>{{luminous}}</b> <b>intensity</b> uniformly across a solid angle of one steradian, the total luminous flux emitted into that angle is one lumen (1 cd·1 sr = 1 lm).Alternatively, an isotropic one-candela light-source emits a total <b>luminous</b> flux <b>of</b> exactly 4π lumens.

He is largely remembered for the invention of the Hefner lamp, which provided the measure <b>of</b> <b>luminous</b> <b>intensity</b> used in Germany, Austria and Scandinavia from 1890 to 1942.

2500|$|The candela ( [...] or symbol: cd) is {{the base}} unit <b>of</b> <b>{{luminous}}</b> <b>intensity</b> in the International System of Units (SI); that is, luminous power per unit solid angle emitted by a point light source {{in a particular}} direction. <b>Luminous</b> <b>intensity</b> is analogous to radiant intensity, but instead of simply adding up the contributions of every wavelength {{of light in the}} source's spectrum, the contribution of each wavelength is weighted by the standard luminosity function (a model of the sensitivity of the human eye to different wavelengths).

5000|$|Prior to the {{definition}} of the candela, a variety <b>of</b> units for <b>luminous</b> <b>intensity</b> were used in various countries. These were typically based on the brightness of the flame from a [...] "standard candle" [...] of defined composition, or the brightness of an incandescent filament of specific design. One of the best-known of these standards was the English standard: candlepower. One candlepower was the light produced by a pure spermaceti candle weighing one sixth of a pound and burning at a rate of 120 grains per hour. Germany, Austria, and Scandinavia used the Hefnerkerze, a unit based on the output of a Hefner lamp. In 1881, Jules Violle proposed the Violle as a unit <b>of</b> <b>luminous</b> <b>intensity,</b> and it was notable as the first unit of light intensity that did not depend on the properties of a particular lamp.
