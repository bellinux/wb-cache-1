25|$|During {{the recent}} history of the grindadráp, the tools of the catch have modernized. <b>Cellular</b> <b>telephones</b> and radio allow the islands to be alerted to a {{sighting}} within the course of minutes. The use of private motorboats gives the whalers more speed and maneuverability on the water. The dull blowhole hook, adopted in response to concerns over cruelty, had the additional effect of further increasing the effectiveness of Faroese attempting to beach the whales. In spite of how such improvements to the tools could make the grindadráp more effective, the number of pilot whales caught, both overall and per whale drive, is less than in preceding centuries.|$|E
500|$|Selena gave Saldívar her American Express {{card for}} the purpose of {{conducting}} company business. Saldívar, however, instead used it to rent Lincoln Town Cars, entertain associates in upmarket restaurants, and buy two <b>cellular</b> <b>telephones</b> which she carried. Staff at Selena Etc. complained that Saldívar was always [...] "nice" [...] when Selena was around; when she was not Saldívar treated everyone terribly. In December 1994, the boutiques began to suffer. The company's bank accounts lacked sufficient funds to pay bills. Staff levels at both stores had been reduced from thirty-eight to fourteen employees, mainly because Saldívar fired those she did not like. The remaining employees began complaining to Selena about Saldívar, but Selena did not believe her friend would hurt her or her business. The employees then began to take their concerns to Quintanilla, Jr. who warned Selena that Saldívar might be a dangerous person. Selena did not believe Saldívar would turn on her; her father had a habit of distrusting people.|$|E

The landline telephone survey data collection method is similar to previous years. The landline telephone survey core questions were asked of all respondents and standardized optional modules were available for states to include by choice. The same optional modules were available for the <b>cellular</b> <b>telephone</b> survey. The increased cost of collecting a <b>cellular</b> <b>telephone</b> interview as well as the concern for reducing the cost burden on the <b>cellular</b> <b>telephone</b> respondent prompted a few states to add optional modules only to the landline telephone survey.
