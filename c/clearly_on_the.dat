5|$|It then {{occurred}} to me that these causes or their equivalents are continually acting in the case of animals also; and as animals usually breed much more quickly than does mankind, the destruction every year from these causes must be enormous in order to keep down the numbers of each species, since evidently they do not increase regularly from year to year, as otherwise the world would long ago have been crowded with those that breed most quickly. Vaguely thinking over the enormous and constant destruction which this implied, it {{occurred to}} me to ask the question, why do some die and some live? And the answer was <b>clearly,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> whole the best fitted live... and considering the amount of individual variation that my experience as a collector had shown me to exist, then it followed that all the changes necessary for the adaptation of the species to the changing conditions would be brought about... In this way every part of an animals organization could be modified exactly as required, and in the very process of this modification the unmodified would die out, and thus the definite characters and the clear isolation of each new species would be explained.|$|E
25|$|Yeltsin, {{who began}} to lose his hold on power as his health deteriorated, wanted Chernomyrdin back, but the {{legislature}} refused to give its approval. After the Duma rejected Chernomyrdin's candidacy twice, Yeltsin, his power <b>clearly</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wane, backed down. Instead, he nominated Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who on 11 September 1998 {{was approved by the}} State Duma by an overwhelming majority.|$|E
25|$|In England {{there were}} 45 {{counties}} and 296 districts, in Wales there were 8 and 37. Six of the English counties were designated as metropolitan counties. The new English counties were based <b>clearly</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> traditional ones, albeit with several substantial changes. The 13 historic counties of Wales, however, were abandoned entirely for administrative purposes, and 8 new ones instituted.|$|E

25|$|GAP is {{estimated}} to double Turkey's irrigable farmland. The increase of agricultural activity of GAP in its incomplete state is visible <b>clearly</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> USDA graph above. Cotton production increased from 150,000 metric tons to 400,000 metric tons, making the region the top cotton producer. But {{at the same time}} other regions declined, which means that Turkey's overall output stayed relatively steady.|$|E
25|$|The {{conflict}} that arose {{at that point}} of the negotiations ended the possibility of further negotiation. During the reception of former British Prime Minister Edward Heath during his sixth visit to the PRC, Deng Xiaoping commented quite <b>clearly</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> impossibility of exchanging sovereignty for administration, declaring an ultimatum: the British government must modify or give up its position or the PRC will announce its resolution {{of the issue of}} Hong Kong sovereignty unilaterally.|$|E

A pair of identical tables, lamps and chairs are there waiting for them, stage left and stage right. The set is therefore symmetrical. The name Croker is an obvious pun on the euphemism, ‘to croak’ i.e. to die, and a name to which Beckett has shown some attachment.|$|E

25|$|A second {{distinguishing}} {{feature of this}} new era was that flat lead roofs now often replaced the former attics where the servants had slept. However, this lack of space was compensated in the new houses by the entire ground floor being given over to the servants. This floor, usually built of rusticated stone, was beneath the larger and grander piano nobile occupied by the employers. Ornate external staircases were built {{to the front door}} which was now <b>clearly</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first floor. The nobility now had very obvious minimal contact with those living downstairs.|$|E
25|$|Field-work {{is carried}} out using {{a small part of}} the base map fixed to a survey board, covered with a piece of {{draughting}} film, and drawn with pencils. The final map needs to be drawn with sufficient accuracy so that a feature shown on the map can be identified <b>clearly</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground by the competitor, thus, field-workers need to locate features with a high level of accuracy, to ensure consistency between map and terrain. Where the map and terrain are inconsistent, the feature becomes unusable: no control point can be placed there. Periodic corrections to the map may be necessary, typically vegetation changes in forested areas.|$|E
25|$|With {{the team}} <b>clearly</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> verge of missing {{the playoffs for}} the first time in 13 years, Paul Holmgren set his sights on {{rebuilding}} the team and preparing for the future. Forsberg, unwilling to commit to playing next season, was traded to Nashville for Scottie Upshall, Ryan Parent and 2007- first and third-round draft picks at the deadline. Veteran defenseman Alexei Zhitnik was traded to the Atlanta Thrashers for prospect defenseman Braydon Coburn, while disappointing off-season acquisition Kyle Calder was sent to Detroit via Chicago in exchange for defenseman Lasse Kukkonen. The Flyers also acquired goaltender Martin Biron from Buffalo for a 2007 second-round pick. Given wide praise for his efforts, the Flyers gave Holmgren a two-year contract and removed the interim label from his title.|$|E

25|$|Following graduation, Macpherson {{applied for}} a {{teaching}} fellowship at Washington State College in Pullman, Washington. American entry into World War II, which had erupted the previous autumn, was <b>clearly</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> horizon, however. Rather than {{face the prospect of}} entry into the conflict as a 2nd Lieutenant of the infantry, Macpherson instead chose to enlist in the Army Air Corps. He trained as a pilot at the new Vandenberg Air Force Base in Santa Maria, California, but was scrubbed from the pilot program following a rough landing during training. He was instead stationed as a 2nd Lieutenant of the Army Air Corps at Albrook Field, located near Panama City, Panama, where he was placed in charge of the base photo laboratory.|$|E
25|$|Prince Shuysky now enters. Boris insults him, {{accusing him}} of conspiring with Pushkin, an {{ancestor}} of the poet. However, the prince brings grave tidings. A Pretender has appeared in Lithuania. Boris angrily demands to know his identity. Shuysky fears the Pretender might attract a following bearing the name of Tsarevich Dmitriy. Shaken by this revelation, Boris dismisses Fyodor. He orders Shuysky to seal the border with Lithuania, and, <b>clearly</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> edge of madness, asks Shuysky whether he has ever heard of dead children rising from their graves to question Tsars. Boris seeks assurance that the dead child the prince had seen in Uglich was really Dmitriy. He threatens Shuysky, if he dissembles, with a gruesome execution. The Prince describes the ghastly scene of Dmitriy's murder in a brief and beautiful aria ("In Uglich, in the cathedral"). But he gives hints that a miracle (incorruptibility) has occurred. Boris begins choking with guilt and remorse, and gives a sign for Shuysky to depart.|$|E
25|$|The {{observational}} method applied to consciousness {{gives us the}} science of psychology. This is the basis and the only proper basis of ontology or metaphysics, the science of being, and of the philosophy of history. To the observation of consciousness Cousin adds induction as the complement of his method, by which he means inference as to reality necessitated by the data of consciousness, and regulated by certain laws found in consciousness, those of reason. By his method of observation and induction as thus explained, his philosophy will be found to be marked off very <b>clearly,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> one hand from the deductive construction of notions of an absolute system, as represented either by Schelling or Hegel, which Cousin regards as based simply on hypothesis and abstraction, illegitimately obtained; and on the other, from that of Kant, and in a sense, of Sir W. Hamilton, both of which {{in the view of}} Cousin are limited to psychology, and merely relative or phenomenal knowledge, and issue in scepticism so far as the great realities of ontology are concerned. What Cousin finds psychologically in the individual consciousness, he finds also spontaneously expressed in the common sense or universal experience of humanity. In fact, it is with him the function of philosophy to classify and explain universal convictions and beliefs; but common-sense is not with him philosophy, nor is it the instrument of philosophy; it is simply the material on which the philosophical method works, and in harmony with which its results must ultimately be found.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reaction}} to Led Zeppelin II was not positive originally. John Mendelsohn wrote a negative {{review of the}} record for Rolling Stone, in which he mocked the group's heavy sound and white blues, while writing that [...] "until you've listened to the album eight hundred times, as I have, {{it seems as if}} it's just one especially heavy song extended over the space of two whole sides". Robert Christgau jokingly referred to the band as [...] "the best of the wah-wah [...] groups, so dirty they drool on demand", while complaining that [...] "all the songs sound alike". He nonetheless conceded that [...] "Led Zeppelin simply out-heavied everyone" [...] in 1969, [...] "pitting Jimmy Page's repeated low-register fuzz riffs against the untiring freak intensity of Robert Plant's vocal. This trademark has only emerged <b>clearly</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> second album, and more and more I am coming to understand it as an artistic triumph." ...|$|E
500|$|It {{has been}} debated by biographers and band historians just how {{involved}} Clark {{was in the}} recording of The Notorious Byrd Brothers. Clark himself claimed during a 1988 interview for radio station KBSG 97 {{that he was involved}} in the recording of [...] "Goin' Back" [...] and some other songs from the same period, although he didn't specify what his contributions might have been. There is also studio documentation and eyewitness accounts to suggest that Clark contributed backing vocals to [...] "Goin' Back" [...] and [...] "Space Odyssey". One of those eyewitnesses, John Noreen of the L.A. folk rock band The Rose Garden, has stated {{in an interview that he}} clearly remembers being at Columbia Recording Studios during sessions for the album and seeing Clark record his backing vocals. This has been corroborated by The Rose Garden's drummer, Bruce Bowdin, who has claimed that Clark's voice can be heard most <b>clearly</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mono mix of [...] "Goin' Back" [...] that was released as a single. However, if Clark is present on either [...] "Space Odyssey" [...] or [...] "Goin' Back", his contributions are not obvious and must have been buried very low in the mix by producer Gary Usher. The Byrds' lead guitarist, Roger McGuinn, cannot remember whether Clark contributed to the album or not, but he has admitted that it is possible. McGuinn has, however, gone on record as stating that he wrote the song [...] "Get to You" [...] with Clark, and that the writing credits on the album are mistaken; they should have read McGuinn/Clark, rather than McGuinn/Hillman.|$|E

500|$|In early April, the {{new leader}} of the Swedish Social Democrats, Håkan Juholt, visited Finland {{in order to show}} support for the SDP in the election. The party also invited other foreign {{politicians}} and ministers for a campaign rally in the week before the election. Liisa Jaakonsaari, an SDP MEP, justified this by saying that it was a tradition to invite colleagues from other states. The party's main guest was the German chairman of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament Martin Schulz. In the interim, the party also invited Swedish Social Democrat Marita Ulvskog who echoed the view that [...] "investors and banks need to take responsibility." [...] Former Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen was also present; he praised the EU and EMU and said that Finland is in a [...] "psychological and moral slump." [...] Following a recent election of his own, the leader of the Estonian Social Democratic Party Sven Mikser and MEP Ivari Padar traveled to campaign rallies in Helsinki and Espoo on 11 April to show support for their [...] "sister party's field campaign." [...] Mikser said that the [...] "Social Democrats recently garnered a strong vote in Estonia and are <b>clearly</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rise. Now we need the same to happen in Finland." [...] Padar also said that because of the rise of anti-EU parties in both Finland and other countries: [...] "That is why I personally consider it important to explain to the Finnish people that Europe should not be feared. Since Estonia and Finland are the only Nordic countries in the Eurozone, we need to have [...] strong partnership in the region." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Heart" [...] {{received}} {{a wide range}} of opinion from reviewers, though the balance was <b>clearly</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> positive side. Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone, wrote that it was [...] "thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish", and HuffPost TV Crystal Bell called it [...] "a standout episode of the season". Bobby Hankinson of The Houston Chronicle characterized it as [...] "sort of terrible" [...] and [...] "unfunny", and IGN's Robert Canning gave it an [...] "okay" [...] grade of 6.5 out of 10, but Canning also acclaimed [...] "the introduction of Rachel's two dads played by Jeff Goldblum and Broadway vet Brian Stokes Mitchell"; he said they were [...] "fantastic" [...] and their schemes regarding the engagement [...] "delightful". Bell called theirs [...] "the most surprising pleasant performances of the night" [...] and added [...] "I absolutely adored these two". Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal summed up their appearance as [...] "annoyingly perfect", and TV Guide Kate Stanhope devoted an entire article to the pair, wrote, [...] "What's not to like? Seamless chemistry, witty back-and-forth", and noted that their appearance filled out Rachel's backstory. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club was another who pointed out that you could see, from their characterization, [...] "how Rachel got to be the way she was". Billboard Rae Votta approved of the episode as a whole and of the Berry parents: [...] "For a pair that have been noticeably absent from the show {{for two and a half}} seasons, they cram a ton of character moments into a single scene". VanDerWerff wrote that the scheme by the Berry fathers [...] "to get the two to break off their marriage plans by talking earnestly about teenage lovemaking" [...] was [...] "very, very creepy and just a little unsound, but I sort of like that it suggests to me that, yeah, this is who these guys are." [...] He characterized Hiram and LeRoy as [...] "goofy sitcom characters", unlike Burt or Carole.|$|E
