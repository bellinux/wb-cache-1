5|$|This act {{introduced}} the 11+ examination {{to determine if}} a <b>child</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> eligible for a grammar school, secondary modern or technical college, under the Tripartite System, but has since been phased out across the majority of the United Kingdom, with just several boroughs in England and Northern Ireland still using it. League tables published in March 2007 showed grammar schools throughout the country were outperforming comprehensive schools; data published ten years later in 2017 suggested a similar clear division between student attainment in grammar schools compared to comprehensive schools.|$|E
5|$|During the 1840s, {{students}} in Philadelphia schools began {{the day with}} reading the Protestant version of the Bible. On November 10, 1842, Philadelphia's Roman Catholic Bishop, Francis Kenrick, {{wrote a letter to}} the Board of Controllers of public schools, asking that Catholic children be allowed to read the Douay version of the Bible, used by Roman Catholics. He also asked that they be excused from other religious teaching while at school. As a result, the Board of Controllers ordered that no <b>child</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> forced to participate in religious activities and stated that children were allowed to read whichever version of the Bible their parents wished. Nativists further inflamed hostile feelings towards Catholics by reportedly twisting Kenrick's requests to the Board of Controllers as an attack against the Bible used in Protestant devotionals.|$|E
25|$|As Shadow Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families, Gove {{advocated}} {{the introduction of}} a Swedish-style voucher system, whereby parents can choose where their <b>child</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> educated, with the state paying what they would have cost in a state-school. He has also advocated Swedish-style free schools, to be managed by parents and funded by the State, with the possibility that such schools may be allowed to be run on a for-profit model.|$|E

25|$|For the {{traditional}} observance of the day, school children form processions through the hallways {{of the school}} building carrying candles, and hand out lussekatt buns. While rarely observed at home, parents often take time off work to watch these school processions in the morning, and if their <b>child</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> chosen Lucia it is considered a great honor. Later on in the day, the procession usually visits local retirement homes, hospitals, and nursing homes.|$|E
500|$|Assessing the child's {{safety is}} an {{essential}} first step that determines whether future intervention can {{take place in the}} family unit or whether the <b>child</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> removed to a safe situation. Interventions may include psychosocial support services for the family unit (including financial or domestic aid, housing and social work support), psychotherapeutic interventions (including treating parents for mental illness, family therapy, individual therapy), education (including training in basic parenting skills and child development), and monitoring of the child's safety within the family environment ...|$|E

500|$|The {{replacement}} cost method {{also has its}} critics. What types of jobs should be used as substitutes? For example, should childcare activities [...] "be calculated using the wages of daycare workers or child psychiatrists?" [...] This relates {{to the problem of}} depressed wages in female-dominated industries, and whether using such jobs as an equivalent leads to the undervaluing of unpaid work. [...] Some have argued that education levels ought to be comparable, for example, [...] "the value of time that a college-educated parent spends reading aloud to a <b>child</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> ascertained by asking how much it would cost to hire a college-educated worker to do the same, not by an average housekeeper's wage." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} twentieth century, DeLee {{observed}} that obstetric complications and deaths were so common that he [...] "often wondered whether nature did not intend women should be used up {{in the process of}} reproduction, in a manner analogous to that of the salmon, which dies after spawning. Perhaps laceration, prolapse and all the evils are, in fact, natural to labor and in fact normal... If you adopt this view, I have no ground to stand on, but, if you believe that a woman after delivery should be as healthy, as well as anatomically perfect as she was before, and that the <b>child</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> undamaged, then you will have to agree with me that labor is pathogenic, because experience has proved such ideal results exceedingly rare." ...|$|E

El-Sherbini who was wearing an Islamic headscarf, was called [...] "Islamist", [...] "terrorist" [...] and (according to one report) [...] "slut". Other people present tried to intervene, but Wiens vehemently continued the verbal abuse for several minutes, directing epithets in Russian and German at the Russian-speaking bystanders who attempted to reason with him. El-Sherbini called the police on a bystander's mobile phone {{and within a few}} minutes four police officers arrived in two vehicles at the scene. El-Sherbini and Wiens were questioned; El-Sherbini was subsequently driven away in one of the police vehicles.|$|E

500|$|While it is {{possible}} to apply Locke's general principles of education to all children, and contemporaries such as Coste certainly did so, Locke himself, despite statements that may imply the contrary, believed that Some Thoughts applied only to the wealthy and the middle-class (or as they would have been referred to at the time, the [...] "middling sorts"). One of Locke's conclusions in Some Thoughts Concerning Education is that he [...] "think a Prince, a Nobleman, and an ordinary Gentleman's Son, should have different Ways of Breeding." [...] As Peter Gay writes, [...] "t never occurred to him that every <b>child</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> educated or that all those to be educated should be educated alike. Locke believed that until the school system was reformed, a gentleman ought to have his son trained at home by a tutor. As for the poor, they do not appear in Locke's little book at all." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1833 she met Ram Mohan Roy, {{a founder}} of the Brahmo Samaj {{movement}} which reformed social Hinduism, and was influenced by his philosophy during his short stay with Miss Castle and Miss Kiddel at Beech House in Stapleton before Roy died of meningitis in September of that year. Later that year she also met Joseph Tuckerman, an American Unitarian who had founded the Ministry-at-Large to the Poor in Boston, Massachusetts. He is said to have directly inspired her start on the path of social reform, partly by a chance remark made when walking with Carpenter through a slum district of Bristol. A small boy in rags ran across their path and Tuckerman remarked, [...] "That <b>child</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> followed to his home and seen after." [...] He had established a Farm School in Massachusetts, which became the model for later reformatories. [...] Carpenter's later writings are based upon ideas she developed from her correspondence with Tuckerman.|$|E
500|$|Another {{aspect of}} naming was the {{importance}} {{attached to the}} wider meaning contained in a name. In 17th-century England {{it was believed that}} choosing a name for a <b>child</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> done carefully. Children should live according to the message contained in, or the meaning of their names. In 1652 William Jenkyn, an English clergyman, argued that first names should be [...] "as a thread tyed about the finger to make us mindful of the errand we came into the world to do for our Master". In 1623, at a time when Puritan names such as Faith, Fortitude and Grace were appearing for the first time, English historian William Camden wrote that names should be chosen with [...] "good and gracious significations", as they might inspire the bearer to good actions. With the rise of the British Empire the English naming system and English surnames spread across large portions of the globe.|$|E

500|$|The film {{received}} mixed reviews, {{but also}} criticism for {{several aspects of}} the production. The Morning Telegraph stated, [...] "The photography {{at the beginning of}} the film is poor. It seems queer that the <b>child</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> able to escape from the orphan asylum in such an easy manner and that no search be made by the institution. It seemed very theatrical and hardly possible that the child should make the first stop at the house of the father's intended. Why did not the producer have the child make a few more stops or have something happen to her instead of making the first stop at the woman's house?" [...] The Moving Picture World spared little coverage of the actual film in its review, noting that the emotional story might be a plausible. The New York Dramatic Mirror gave a detailed review that found the acting favorable, but found the plot and its resolution to be fantastical by stating, [...] "The manifest absurdity of this plot lies in the adoption. No girl just betrothed would ever adopt a runaway orphan." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1965, the {{benefits}} of the National College of Education partnership were less evident and the Administrative Board purchased Avery Coonley from the NCE. Under Malach's leadership, ACS continued to experiment and innovate. Despite widespread skepticism among contemporary educators that kindergartners were ready to read, ACS launched an early reading program in the early 1960s. Malach's stance was that [...] "we don't believe a <b>child</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> taught because he or she is now 6 years old or in 1st grade. Our children begin to learn to read when the teacher determines the child is ready. Then the teacher works individually with the child at his or her own pace." [...] By this time, however, the once-radical ideas of progressive education had become [...] "conventional wisdom" [...] and kindergarten was a ubiquitous feature of American public schools. As part of Malach's [...] "bid to reforge the leadership role that Avery Coonley School had played during its early years", ACS joined the Independent Schools Association of the Central States (ISACS) in 1961. ISACS was founded in 1908 to promote best practices in independent schools, and instituted a mandatory accreditation program for member schools in 1961. Avery Coonley served as the headquarters of ISACS from 1970 until the central office was dissolved in 2000.|$|E
