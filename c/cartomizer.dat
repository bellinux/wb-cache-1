50|$|They may be {{a single}} unit {{comprising}} a battery, coil and filling saturated with e-juice in a single tube to be used and discarded after the battery or e-liquid is depleted. They {{may also be a}} reusable device with a battery and cartridge called a <b>cartomizer.</b> The <b>cartomizer</b> cartridge can be separated from the battery so the battery can be charged and the empty <b>cartomizer</b> replaced when the e-juice runs out.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>cartomizer</b> {{was invented}} in 2007, {{integrating}} the heating coil into the liquid chamber. A [...] "cartomizer" [...] (a portmanteau of cartridge and atomizer.) or [...] "carto" [...] consists of an atomizer surrounded by a liquid-soaked poly-foam that acts as an e-liquid holder. They can have up to 3 coils and each coil will increase vapor production. The <b>cartomizer</b> is usually discarded when the e-liquid starts to taste burnt, which usually happens when the e-cigarette is activated with a dry coil or when the <b>cartomizer</b> gets consistently flooded (gurgling) because of sedimentation of the wick. Most cartomizers are refillable even if not advertised as such.|$|E
5000|$|Cartomizers {{can be used}} {{on their}} own or in {{conjunction}} with a tank that allows more e-liquid capacity. The portmanteau word [...] "cartotank" [...] has been coined for this. When used in a tank, the <b>cartomizer</b> is inserted in a plastic, glass or metal tube and holes or slots have to be punched {{on the sides of the}} <b>cartomizer</b> so liquid can reach the coil.|$|E
5000|$|Second-generation e-cigarettes {{commonly}} use a tank or a [...] "clearomizer". Clearomizer {{tanks are}} meant to be refilled with e-juice, while <b>cartomizers</b> are not. Because they're refillable and the battery is rechargeable, their cost of operation is lower. Hovever, they can also use <b>cartomizers,</b> which are pre-filled only.|$|R
50|$|Charging is {{commonly}} accomplished with a USB charger that {{attaches to the}} battery. Some manufacturers also have a cigarette pack-shaped portable charging case (PCC), which contains a larger battery capable of recharging the individual e-cigarette batteries. Reusable devices can come in a kit that contains a battery, a charger, {{and at least one}} cartridge. Varying nicotine concentrations are available and nicotine delivery to the user also varies based on different <b>cartomizers,</b> e-juice mixtures, and power supplied by the battery.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Background: Although {{millions}} of people are using electronic cigarettes (ECs) and research on this topic has intensified in recent years, the pattern of EC use has not been systematically studied. Additionally, no comparative measure of exposure and nicotine delivery between EC and tobacco cigarette or nicotine replacement therapy (NRTs) has been established. This is important, especially {{in the context of the}} proposal for a new Tobacco Product Directive issued by the European Commission. Methods: A second generation EC device, consisting of a higher capacity battery and tank atomiser design compared to smaller cigarette-like batteries and <b>cartomizers,</b> and a 9 mg/mL nicotine-concentration liquid were used in this study. Eighty subjects were recruited; 45 experienced EC users and 35 smokers. EC users were video-recorded when using the device (ECIG group), while smokers were recorded when smoking (SM-S group) and when using the EC (SM-E group) in a randomized cross-over design. Puff, inhalation and exhalation duration were measured. Additionally, the amount of EC liquid consumed by experienced EC users was measured at 5 min (similar to the time needed to smoke one tobacco cigarette) and at 20 min (similar to the time needed for a nicotine inhaler to deliver 4 mg nicotine).

5000|$|First-generation e-{{cigarettes}} tend to {{look like}} tobacco cigarettes and so are called [...] "cigalikes". The three parts of a cigalike e-cigarette initially were a cartridge, an atomizer, and a battery. A cigalike e-cigarette currently contains a <b>cartomizer</b> (cartridge atomizer), which is connected to a battery. Most cigalikes look like cigarettes {{but there is some}} variation in size.|$|E
50|$|The {{demand for}} {{customizable}} e-cigarettes prompted some manufacturers to produce devices with interchangeable components {{that could be}} selected by the user. In 2009, Joyetech developed the eGo series which offered {{the power of the}} screwdriver model and a user-activated switch to a wide market. The clearomizer was invented in 2009. Originating from the <b>cartomizer</b> design, it contained the wicking material, an e-liquid chamber, and an atomizer coil within a single clear component. The clearomizer allows the user to monitor the liquid level in the device. Soon after the clearomizer reached the market, replaceable atomizer coils and variable voltage batteries were introduced. Clearomizers and eGo batteries became the best-selling customizable e-cigarette components in early 2012.|$|E

Clearomizers or [...] "clearos", are like cartotanks, in that an atomizer is inserted into the tank. There are different wicking systems used inside clearomizers. Some rely on gravity to bring the e-liquid to the wick and coil assembly (bottom coil clearomizers for example) and others rely on capillary action or to some degree the user agitating the e-liquid while handling the clearomizer (top coil clearomizers). The coil and wicks are typically inside a prefabricated assembly or [...] "head" [...] that is replaceable by the user.|$|E

Additionally, the amount of EC liquid consumed by experienced EC users was measured at 5 min (similar to the time needed to smoke one tobacco cigarette) and at 20 min (similar to the time needed for a nicotine inhaler to deliver 4 mg nicotine). Results: Puff duration was significantly higher in ECIG (4. 2 ± 0. 7 s) compared to SM-S (2. 1 ± 0. 4 s) and SM-E (2. 3 ± 0. 5 s), while inhalation time was lower (1. 3 ± 0. 4, 2. 1 ± 0. 4 and 2. 1 ± 0. 4 respectively). No difference was observed in exhalation duration. EC users took 13 puffs and consumed 62 ± 16 mg liquid in 5 min; they took 43 puffs and consumed 219 ± 56 mg liquid in 20 min. Nicotine delivery was estimated at 0. 46 ± 0. 12 mg after 5 min and 1. 63 ± 0. 41 mg after 20 min of use. Therefore, 20. 8 mg/mL and 23. 8 mg/mL nicotine-containing liquids would deliver 1 mg of nicotine in 5 min and 4 mg nicotine in 20 min, respectively. Since the ISO method significantly underestimates nicotine delivery by tobacco cigarettes, it seems that liquids with even higher than 24 mg/mL nicotine concentration would be comparable to one tobacco cigarette. Conclusions: EC use topography is significantly different compared to smoking. Four-second puffs with 20 – 30 s interpuff interval should be used when assessing EC effects in laboratory experiments, provided that the equipment used does not get overheated. Based on the characteristics of the device used in this study, a 20 mg/mL nicotine concentration liquid would be needed in order to deliver nicotine at amounts similar to the maximum allowable content of one tobacco cigarette (as measured by the ISO 3308 method). The results of this study do not support the statement of the European Commission Tobacco Product Directive that liquids with nicotine concentration of 4 mg/mL are comparable to NRTs in the amount of nicotine delivered to the user...|$|R
5000|$|When e-cigarettes {{entered the}} {{international}} market, some users were {{dissatisfied with their}} performance, and the e-cigarette continued to evolve from the first generation three-part device. In 2007 British entrepreneurs Umer and Tariq Sheikh invented the <b>cartomizer.</b> This is a mechanism that integrates the heating coil into the liquid chamber. They launched this new device in the UK in 2008 under their Gamucci brand, and the design is now widely adopted by most [...] "cigalike" [...] brands. Other users tinkered with various parts to produce more satisfactory homemade devices, and the hobby of [...] "modding" [...] was born. The first mod to replace the e-cigarette's case to accommodate a longer-lasting battery, dubbed the [...] "screwdriver", was developed by Ted and Matt Rogers in 2008. Other enthusiasts built their own mods to improve functionality or aesthetics. When pictures of mods appeared at online vaping forums many people wanted them, so some mod makers produced more for sale.|$|E

All filaments were made of nickel and chromium. Thick wires were copper coated with either tin or silver. Wires were joined to each other by tin solder, brazing, or by brass clamps. High concentrations of tin were detected in the aerosol when tin solder joints were friable. Tin coating on copper wires also contributed to tin in the aerosol. Tin concentrations in EC aerosols varied both within and between brands. Tin in aerosol was reduced by coating the thick wire with silver rather than tin, placing stable tin solder joints outside the atomizing chamber, joining wires with brass clamps or by brazing rather than soldering wires.

40|$|This study {{compared}} {{the performance of}} 12 brands of <b>cartomizer</b> style electronic cigarettes (EC) using different puffing protocols and measured the concentrations of nicotine in each product. Air flow rate, pressure drop, and aerosol absorbance were measured using two different protocols, first 10 puffs and a modified smoke-out protocol. First 10 puff protocol: The air flow rate required to produce aerosol ranged between brands from 4 - 21 mL/s. Pressure drop was relatively stable within a brand but ranged between brands from 14 - 71 mmH 2 O and was {{much lower than the}} earlier classic 3 -piece models. Absorbance, a measure of aerosol density, was relatively consistent between puffs, but varied between brands. With the modified smoke-out protocol, most brands were puffed until 300 puffs. The pressure drop was relatively stable for all brands except three. Absorbance of the aerosol decreased as the number of puffs increased. Although there was some uniformity in performance within some brands, there was large variation between brands. The labeled and measured nicotine concentrations were within 10 % of each other in only 1 out of 10 brands. Over 10 puffs, the cartomizers all perform similarly within a brand but varied between brands. In smoke-out trials, most brands lasted at least 300 puffs, and performed similarly within brands with respect to pressure drop and absorbance. For five brands, products purchased at different times performed differently. These data show some improvement in performance during evolution of these products, but nevertheless indicate problems with quality control in manufacture...|$|E
40|$|Prior {{electronic}} cigarette (EC) topography data {{are based on}} two video analyses with limited parameters. Alternate methods for measuring topography are needed to understand EC use and nicotine intake. This study evaluated EC topography with a CReSS Pocket device and quantified nicotine intake. Validation tests on pressure drop, flow rate, and volume confirmed reliable performance of the CReSS Pocket device. Twenty participants used Blu Cigs and V 2 Cigs for 10 minute intervals with a 10 - 15 minute break between brands. Brand order was reversed and repeated within 7 days Data were analyzed to determine puff duration, puff count, volume, flow rate, peak flow, and inter-puff interval. Nicotine intake was estimated from <b>cartomizer</b> fluid consumption and topography data. Nine patterns of EC use were identified. The average puff count and inter-puff interval were 32 puffs and 17. 9 seconds. All participants, except one, took more than 20 puffs/ 10 minutes. The averages for puff duration (2. 65 seconds/puff), volume/puff (51 ml/puff), total puff volume (1, 579 ml), EC fluid consumption (79. 6 mg), flow rate (20 ml/s), and peak flow rate (27 ml/s) were determined for 10 -minute sessions. All parameters except total puff count were significantly different for Blu versus V 2 EC. Total volume for Blu versus V 2 was four-times higher than for conventional cigarettes. Average nicotine intake for Blu and V 2 across both sessions was 1. 2 ± 0. 5 mg and 1. 4 ± 0. 7 mg, respectively, {{which is similar to}} conventional smokers. EC puffing topography was variable among participants in the study, but often similar within an individual between brands or days. Puff duration, inter-puff interval, and puff volume varied from conventional cigarette standards. Data on total puff volume and nicotine intake are consistent with compensatory usage of EC. These data can {{contribute to the development of}} a standard protocol for laboratory testing of EC products...|$|E
