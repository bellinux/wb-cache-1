5|$|The {{producers}} {{had trouble}} with the censors over several segments in this episode. The opening segment of the episode, which features a Fox <b>censor</b> named Fox <b>Censor</b> (pictured on the left) being stabbed to death, was pitched by David Mirkin and {{had a difficult time}} getting through the real-life censors. They had issues with the size of the knife and the sound effects used. Originally, the TV-rating was supposed to stab <b>Censor</b> with a dagger, but Fox objected because it was too gruesome and was changed to a cutlass. The censors also objected to an unaired scene where Homer does his naked church dance on an altar. The scene was reanimated so that Homer was dancing naked in the front row.|$|E

In this paper, we present two {{interesting}} results which are useful in deriving the Fisher information along with the expected <b>censoring</b> times and expected numbers of failures in hybrid and generalized hybrid <b>censoring</b> schemes. We first interpret the Type-II <b>censoring</b> scheme in terms of a Type-I <b>censoring</b> scheme so that the <b>censoring</b> time in hybrid <b>censoring</b> schemes can be regarded as a mixture of Type-I <b>censoring</b> times. We then exploit this mixture form to derive the Fisher information in hybrid <b>censored</b> schemes. We further establish an addition rule underlying Type-I and Type-II hybrid <b>censoring</b> schemes and derive the Fisher information in the case of generalized hybrid <b>censoring</b> schemes. Finally, we present an example to illustrate the results developed here. ...|$|R

5|$|Every five years, two censors {{were elected}} for an eighteen-month term. Since the {{censorship}} {{was the most}} prestigious of all offices, usually only former consuls were elected to it. Censors were elected by the assembly of Roman Soldiers, the Centuriate Assembly, usually after the new consuls and praetors for the year began their term. After the censors had been elected, the Centuriate Assembly granted the new censors censorial power. Censors did not have imperium powers, {{and they were not}} accompanied by any lictors. In addition, they did not have the power to convene the Roman Senate or Roman assemblies. Technically they outranked all other ordinary magistrates (including consuls and praetors). This ranking, however, was solely a result of their prestige, rather than any real power they had. Since the office could be easily abused (as a result of its power over every ordinary citizen), only former consuls (usually patrician consuls) were elected to the office. This is what gave the office its prestige. Their actions could not be vetoed by any magistrate other than a plebeian tribune, or a fellow <b>censor.</b> No other ordinary magistrate could veto a <b>censor</b> because no ordinary magistrate technically outranked a <b>censor.</b> Tribunes, by virtue of their sacrosanctity as the representatives of the people, could veto anything or anyone. Censors usually did not have to act in unison, but if a <b>censor</b> wanted to reduce the status of a citizen in a census, he had to act in unison with his colleague.|$|E

The censored theatrical version was the only one seen by audiences for fifteen years. The original, unedited cut of the film finally came out in a British release on VHS in 1990.

Parametric methods based on maximum likelihood estimation as well as semiparametric and non-parametric methods have been successfully used in linear regression estimation with <b>censored</b> covariates where <b>censoring</b> is due to a limit of detection. In this paper, we adapt some of these methods to handle randomly <b>censored</b> covariates and compare them under different scenarios to recently-developed semiparametric and nonparametric methods for randomly <b>censored</b> covariates.

40|$|In life tests, the {{progressive}} Type-II <b>censoring</b> methodology {{allows for the}} possibility of <b>censoring</b> a number of units each time a failure is observed. This results in a large number of possible <b>censoring</b> plans, depending on the number of both <b>censoring</b> times and <b>censoring</b> numbers. Employing maximum Fisher Information as an optimality criterion, optimal plans for a variety of lifetime distributions are determined numerically. In particular, exact optimal plans are established for some important lifetime distributions. While for some distributions, Fisher information is invariant with respect to the <b>censoring</b> plan, results for other distributions lead us to hypothesize that the optimal scheme is in fact always a one-step method, restricting <b>censoring</b> to exactly one point in time. Depending on the distribution and its parameters, this optimal point of <b>censoring</b> can be located at the end (right <b>censoring)</b> or after a certain proportion of observations. A variety of distributions is categorized accordingly. If the optimal plan is a one-step <b>censoring</b> scheme, the optimal proportion is determined. Moreover, the Fisher information as well as the expected time till the completion of the experiment for the optimal one-step <b>censoring</b> plan are compared with the respective quantities of both right <b>censoring</b> and simple random sampling. ...|$|R
