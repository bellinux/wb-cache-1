25|$|According to Le Sage's theory, an {{isolated}} body {{is subjected to}} drag {{if it is in}} motion relative to the unique isotropic frame of the ultramundane flux (i.e., the frame in which the speed of the ultramundane corpuscles is the same in all directions). This {{is due to the fact}} that, if a body is in motion, the particles striking the body from the front have a higher speed (relative to the body) than those striking the body from behind - this effect will act to decrease the distance between the sun and the earth. The magnitude of this drag is proportional to vu, where v is the speed of the particles and u is the speed of the body, whereas the characteristic force of gravity is proportional to v2, so the ratio of drag to gravitational force is proportional to u/v. Thus for a given <b>characteristic</b> <b>strength</b> of gravity, the amount of drag for a given speed u can be made arbitrarily small by increasing the speed v of the ultramundane corpuscles. However, in order to reduce the drag to an acceptable level (i.e., consistent with observation) in terms of classical mechanics, the speed v must be many orders of magnitude greater than the speed of light. This makes Le Sage theory fundamentally incompatible with the modern science of mechanics based on special relativity, according to which no particle (or wave) can exceed the speed of light. In addition, even if superluminal particles were possible, the effective temperature of such a flux would be sufficient to incinerate all ordinary matter in a fraction of a second.|$|E

He was of fair height, and wiry build. His weathered face, under sleek, dark hair, had regular, rather small features, and wore an expression of alert resolution, masked by impassivity. Over his inquiring, hazel-grey eyes the lids were almost religiously kept half drawn. He had been born reticent, and great, indeed, was the emotion under which he suffered when the whole of his eyes were visible. His nose was finely chiselled, and had little flesh. His lips, covered by a small, dark moustache, scarcely opened to emit his speeches, which were uttered in a voice singularly muffled, yet unexpectedly quick. The whole personality {{was that of a}} man practical, spirited, guarded, resourceful, with great power of self-control, who looked at life {{as if she were a}} horse under him, to whom he must give way just so far as was necessary to keep mastery of her. A man to whom ideas were of no value, except when wedded to immediate action; essentially neat; demanding to be 'done well,' but capable of stoicism if necessary; urbane, yet always in readiness to thrust; able only to condone the failings and to compassionate the kinds of distress which his own experience had taught him to understand.

We couldn't indicate that the recycled aggregate is not good for using just by comparing these data with the natural aggregate properties. If we use 65% of recycled aggregate or above, each physical properties will drop greatly. However, if we limit the portion of recycled aggregate adds to concrete, it won't affect each property much.

Rani gets married to Rishabh (Karan Grover), the son of an aristocratic family to whom she has been engaged since childhood. However, she is in for a shock: Rishabh and his brothers have lost all their wealth. They live in a rundown house and constantly quarrel with each other. What is worse, Rishabh has no proper education and is indifferent to his wife. With great courage and patience, Rani sets about reforming her new family and restoring order to their home. Encouraged by her, Rishabh takes up a job. Slowly, love blossoms between the couple. Eventually they regain their inheritance and move into their grand ancestral house. However, their happiness is short-lived, as Rishabh and his brothers die in a tragic accident.

40|$|Ultrasonic {{spot welds}} {{have been used}} as a model system to {{investigate}} how to determine the mode-I cohesive parameters associated with interfacial fracture of a spot weld. Numerical analyses indicated that, while multiple combinations of the two cohesive parameters (<b>characteristic</b> <b>strength,,</b> and toughness, Γ I) could result in virtually indistinguishable behaviors for individual geometries, only a single pair of parameters can provide a unique set of behaviors for different test geometries. This provides the basis for determining the cohesive parameters by comparing numerical predictions to experimental observations. In particular, a direct uniaxial tensile test was found to be particularly useful for measuring the <b>characteristic</b> <b>strength</b> of an ultrasonic weld. With the <b>characteristic</b> <b>strength</b> known, the toughness of the weld was determined by fitting numerical predictions to experimental observations of the load–displacement curves obtained from T-peel specimens bonded with the ultrasonic weld.

Disc-shaped specimens were manufactured and divided according to two factors: "grinding" - without grinding (as-sintered, Ctrl), grinding with an extra-fine diamond bur (25 µm Xfine) and coarse diamond bur (181 µm Coarse); and "low-temperature-aging" (absence or presence). Grinding was performed using a contra-angle handpiece under water-cooling. Aging was performed in an autoclave at 134 °C, under 2 bar, {{over a period of}} 20 h. Surface topography analysis showed an increase in roughness based on grit-size (Coarse>Xfine>Ctrl), and aging promoted different effects on roughness (Ctrl Ag Coarse). Grinding and aging promoted an increase in the amount of m-phase, although different susceptibilities to degradation were observed. Weibull analysis showed an increase in <b>characteristic</b> <b>strength</b> after grinding (Coarse=Xfine>Ctrl); however, distinct effects were observed for aging (Ctrl Coarse Ag). Weibull moduli were statistically similar. Grinding promoted an increase in <b>characteristic</b> <b>strength</b> {{as a result of an}} increase in m-phase content; when the Y-TZP surface was ground by coarse diamond burs followed by aging, <b>characteristic</b> <b>strength</b> was reduced, meaning the low-temperature degradation appeared to intensify for rougher Y-TZP surfaces...|$|E
