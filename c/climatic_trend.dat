Maize is a tropical crop first cultivated in Mexico which found its way northward to the United States over thousands of years. Maize agriculture began on the Great Plains by AD 900, initiating the Southern Plains villagers period of western Oklahoma and Texas. It probably came about as an extension westward and northward of the Caddoan cultures of eastern Texas. The Plains Village culture consisted of hamlets and semi-permanent villages along major rivers such as the Red, Washita, and Canadian. Subsistence was a combination of agriculture and hunting. A drying <b>climatic</b> <b>trend</b> beginning AD 1000 or 1100 may have tipped the subsistence scale more toward hunting and less toward a dependence upon agriculture. The Antelope Creek Phase of Plains villagers, dated from AD 1200 to 1450 in the Texas panhandle was influenced by the Southwestern Pueblo people of the Rio Grande valley in New Mexico.The contemporaneous Apishapa culture of southeastern Colorado depended mostly upon hunting.

The selection of an appropriate emission scenario is important to present the appropriate <b>climatic</b> <b>trend</b> suit to the site study. The main objective is to determine appropriate emission scenarios and potential increment of rainfall in the upcoming year Δ 2020 and Δ 2050 for site study. Two climate projection models; SDSM and PRECIS models were used to generate the future rainfall trends using A 2, B 2 and A 1 B scenarios. The result showed the B 2 scenario has potential to produce similar trend to the historical for the Kuala Sala station, in Kedah, followed by the A 2 scenario. Scenario A 1 B is estimated to underestimate/overestimate through a year affected by the coordinate gap selection of site study. Generally, the annual rainfall intensity predicted varies for different SRES scenarios and reflect to the future expectation on development patterns. The highest rainfall increment is predicted by using the B 2 scenario (about 2638 mm/year) until year Δ 2050. A 1 B is predicted to produce the lowest increment.

40|$|The {{projected}} {{influence of}} climate change on the timing and volume of phytomass production is expected to affect a number of ecosystem services. In order to develop coherent and locally effective adaptation and mitigation strategies, spatially explicit information on the observed changes is needed. Long-term variations of the vegetative growing season in different environmental zones of Europe for 1982 - 2006 have been derived by analysing time series of GIMMS NDVI data. The associations of phenologically homogenous spatial clusters to time series of temperature and precipitation data were evaluated. North-East Europe showed a trend to an earlier and longer growing season, particularly in the northern Baltic areas. Despite the earlier greening up large areas of Europe exhibited rather stable season length indicating the shift of the entire growing season to an earlier period. The northern Mediterranean experience a growing season shift towards later dates while some agglomerations of earlier and shorter growing season were also seen. The correlation of phenological time series with climate data shows a cause-effect relationship over the semi natural areas consistent with results in literature. Managed ecosystems however appear to have heterogeneous change pattern with less or no correlation to <b>climatic</b> <b>trends.</b> Over these areas <b>climatic</b> <b>trends</b> seemed to overlap in a complex manner with more pronounced effects of local biophysical conditions and/or land management practices.

The Paleocene–Eocene boundary was placed at the base a of d 13 C negative excursion from the literature that was found virtually coincident with the base of Zone NP 9 b. The base of the Middle Eocene (Lutetian) was placed {{at the base of}} Chron C 21 r. Biostratigraphic events were generally found to be consistent with parallel events in recent time scales; several potentially useful new events are also described. In particular, we detected the earliest specimens of Dictyococcites at the base of Chron C 22 r (NP 12 –NP 13 zonal transition), which is several million years older than previous estimates. Correlation of Possagno data to the oxygen isotope record from the literature allowed us to describe the temporal relationships between climate variability and calcareous nannofossil assemblages. Modifications in the nannofossil assemblage coeval to both the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) and the Early–Middle Eocene long-term <b>climatic</b> <b>trend</b> are recognized. The short-lived PETM was coeval to provisional adaptations (malformations and/or ecophenotypes) in the coccolithophores communities that were reabsorbed upon return to long-term varying climatic conditions.

40|$|Climate is {{a driver}} of biotic systems. It affects {{individual}} fitness, population dynamics, distribution and abundance of species, and ecosystem structure and function. Regional variation in climatic regimes creates selective pressures for {{the evolution of}} locally adapted physiologies, morphological adaptations (e. g., color patterns, surface textures, body shapes and sizes), and behavioral adaptations (e. g., foraging strategies and breeding systems). In the absence of humans, broad-scale, long-term consequences of climatic warming on wild organisms are generally predictable. Evidence from Pleistocene glaciations indicates that most species responded ecologically by shifting their ranges poleward and upward in elevation, rather than evolutionary through local adaptation (e. g., morphological changes). But these broad patterns tell us little about the relative importance of gradual <b>climatic</b> <b>trends</b> as compared to extreme weather events in shaping these processes.

30|$|Desertification is {{a complex}} process. It {{involves}} multiple causes and proceeds at varying rates in different climates. Desertification may intensify a general <b>climatic</b> <b>trend</b> toward greater aridity, or it may initiate a change in local climate. Desertification does not occur in straight-forward, easily predictable patterns that can be rigorously mapped. Deserts advance erratically, forming patches on their borders. Areas far from natural deserts can degrade quickly to barren soil or rock through poor land management. The proximity of a nearby desert has no direct relationship to desertification. Unfortunately, areas subjected {{to the process of}} desertification are brought to professional or public attention only after the process is well underway. This is especially true in regions where little or no data are available to indicate the previous state of the ecosystem or the rate of degradation.

40|$|International audienceAn {{analysis}} of two series of pluviometric observations (1881 - 1910 and 1961 - 90) for stations of western France shows an increasing contrast between seasons: while winter {{is more and}} more rainy, the frequency of drought arises in summer (specially in august). This is particularly obvious for the last period (1946 - 95); if this is a <b>climatic</b> <b>trend,</b> its effects could be a real problem for the years to come in areas of intensive agriculture. At the same time this change is associated to an increase of heavy rains in may, june and september. This paper investigates the possible impact of new agricultural methods that have considerably modified the repartition of bare soils during the vegetative season. Thermographies issued from NOAA-AVHRR satellites show higher temperatures in regions where cereals and re-allocation of land have been generalized.

40|$|Sensitivity {{experiments}} with general circulation models show that uplift of plateau and mountain regions in Southern Asia and the American west {{during the late}} Cenozoic was {{an important factor in}} the evolution of Northern Hemisphere climate. The <b>climatic</b> <b>trends</b> simulated in the uplift experiments agree in direction with most trends observed in the geological record, including the tendencies toward greater regional differentiation of climate, and particularly the fragmentation into wetter and drier climatic patterns at middle latitudes. These <b>climatic</b> <b>trends</b> result from (1) increased orographic diversion of the mid-latitude westerlies, and (2) increased summer heating and winter cooling over the plateaus, which enhances seasonally reversing (monsoonal) changes in wind directions. Most previous hypotheses addressing the physical impact of orography on climate have focused on mountain ranges and have stressed relatively local responses such as upslope precipitation maxima, cooling of mountain crests due to lapse-rate effects on rising terrain, and lee-side rainshadow effects. In contrast, our results emphasise the importance of large-scale plateau orography. By redirecting the basic directions of wind flow both at surface and upper-tropospheric levels, these rising plateaux cause far-reaching climatic changes that extend across the continents as well as over the oceans...|$|R

Climate trends and drought indicators, in relation to different vegetation associations, were analyzed using the zonal statistic tool (ArcGIS). During the investigated period, rainfall showed a uniform decreasing trend, while temperature increased, with an irregular trend. The specialization of climatic data showed a shift towards a thermo-Mediterranean bioclimate.
