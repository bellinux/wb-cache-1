50|$|The {{traditional}} aim {{of plant}} breeding {{is to improve}} the agronomic or nutritional qualities of a crop. Typical goals are improved yield, reduced susceptibility to diseases and pests, homogeneous maturation (to optimize harvest) and increased tolerance to environmental stresses—i.e., drought, acid soil, high or cold temperature, etc. Most of the known wheat species today are polyploid.Whereas <b>common</b> <b>bread</b> <b>wheat</b> is hexaploid, Khorasan wheat is tetraploid. To do further breeding with this tetraploid Khorasan wheat, the genetic pool to use is a little bit limited to the tetraploid subspecies of triticum turgidum such as Durum (subsp. durum), Polish (subsp. polonicum), Persian (subsp. carthlicum), Emmer (subsp. dicoccum) and Poulard (subsp. turgidum) wheat. Especially to develop resistances against common fungi (e.g. Fusarium Head Blight), this genomic pool is interesting. Problematic in this case, is the economic unimportance of most of the tetraploid subspecies of wheat (except Durum), which limits the investment to do intensive breeding, especially compared to the highly important <b>common</b> <b>bread</b> <b>wheat.</b>|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Powdery mildew {{of wheat}} (Triticum spp.) caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (DC) E. O. Speer Em. Marchal {{is one of}} the most {{important}} bread wheat diseases in Egypt. All the Egyptian <b>common</b> <b>bread</b> <b>wheat</b> cultivars are susceptible to that disease at seedling and adult stages. Breeding of resistant cultivars is the most economical and environmentally safe method to eliminate the disease and reduce crop losses. Combinations of two or more effective resistance genes may lead to better, more durable resistance to that disease. Eight Pm genes i. e. Pm 2, Pm 6, Pm 12, Pm 16, Pm 24, Pm 35, Pm 36 and Pm 37 out of 21 powdery mildew monogenic wheat lines (Pm) were resistant to 42 individual isolates of powdery mildew collected from different governorates in the Nile Delta area, Egypt, at seedling and adult stages. Only four DNA specific SSR markers (Xgwm 337, Xcfd 7 linked to Pm 24, Pm 35 and Xgwm 332, Xwmc 790) linked to Pm 37 resistance genes were selected to detect these genes in 13 Egyptian <b>common</b> <b>bread</b> <b>wheat</b> cultivars. This study reveals the absence of Pm 24, Pm 35 and Pm 37 in all the 13 Egyptian bread wheat cultivars. These results gave evidence that the Egyptian cultivars are not having resistance genes and need to further incorporate one, two or more resistant genes in a single genotype as all commercial cultivars defeated by the pathogen...|$|E
50|$|Bread is {{the staple}} food of the Middle East, North Africa, Europe, and in European-derived {{cultures}} {{such as those}} in the Americas, Australia, and Southern Africa, in contrast to East Asia where rice is the staple. Bread is usually made from a wheat-flour dough that is cultured with yeast, allowed to rise, and finally baked in an oven. The addition of yeast to the bread explains the air pockets commonly found in bread. Owing to its high levels of gluten (which give the dough sponginess and elasticity), <b>common</b> or <b>bread</b> <b>wheat</b> is the most common grain used for the preparation of bread, which makes the largest single contribution to the world's food supply of any food.|$|R

Methods: We have evaluated the allergenic IgE hypersensitivity mediated by spelt in wheat allergic patients. Overall, 66 patients who suffered from baker’s asthma or food allergy (45 males and 21 females, mean age 28. 6 ± 12. 9 years) were included.

40|$|Today in China, {{hexaploid}} wheat (Triticum aestivum – <b>common</b> <b>wheat</b> or <b>bread</b> <b>wheat)</b> {{is one of}} the major staple food crops. The other key cereal staples – rice, foxtail millet and broomcorn millet – are widely accepted as Chinese domesticates, but the origins of wheat cultivation in China are the subject of debate. There has long been a belief among Chinese scholars that China was an independent centre of wheat domestication, but recent scholarship suggests that cultivated wheat was introduced to China from its original site of domestication in the Near East. The precise path of entry is unknown. It is argued here that it is most likely to have been introduced at some time around the late 6 th to early 5 th millennium BP. Two hypotheses are presented. One hypothesis, supported primarily by the paleobotanical evidence, postulates that T. aestivum came in from the west, through northern Xinjiang, probably from Afghanistan or the Central Asian oases rather than the Eurasian steppes. The second, supported by the available archaeological evidence, proposes that the route of entry might have been from the north-west, from Eurasia, through southern Siberia and Mongolia. © 2013, Published by Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|In South Australia, {{durum wheat}} yields more than <b>bread</b> <b>wheat</b> under well-watered and fertile conditions, but {{over much of}} the state’s cereal belt the yields of durum <b>wheat,</b> {{relative}} to <b>bread</b> <b>wheat,</b> are low. Three experiments were conducted over 3 years at 2 sites to compare the growth and yield of <b>bread</b> and durum <b>wheat</b> and to investigate some {{of the reasons for the}} differences in the relative yields of the 2 cereals. Durum wheat yielded less than <b>bread</b> <b>wheat</b> when annual rainfall was less than about 450 mm or when the site mean yield for <b>bread</b> <b>wheat</b> was less than 250 g/m². Compared with <b>bread</b> <b>wheat,</b> durum wheat had poorer early vigour, which was associated with fewer tillers/m², and produced fewer kernels/m². Under favourable grain filling conditions, durum wheat produced larger kernels than <b>bread</b> <b>wheat</b> but its kernel weight was more variable across sites and seasons and consequently, the relative yields of the 2 cereals depended largely on kernel weight. For example, in a wet year, durum wheat yielded 20 % more than <b>bread</b> <b>wheat,</b> despite producing 16 % fewer kernels/m², because of its larger kernels (52 v. 36 mg). In 2 drier years, kernel weights of durum and <b>bread</b> <b>wheat</b> were similar (durum and <b>bread</b> <b>wheat</b> mean kernel weights: 40 v. 37 mg; 30 v. 33 mg) and so durum was unable to overcome the limitation of fewer kernels/m² and its yields were similar to or less than <b>bread</b> <b>wheat.</b> Root length densities of durum and <b>bread</b> <b>wheat</b> below 30 cm were low. Durum wheat had an equivalent or lower root length density than <b>bread</b> <b>wheat</b> and lower length per gram of root dry matter, indicating less finely divided roots. This suggests that durum wheat may sometimes be less able than <b>bread</b> <b>wheat</b> to utilise moisture and nutrient reserves in the subsoil because of a smaller root system. This is an undesirable characteristic for a crop that appears to be more reliant than <b>bread</b> <b>wheat</b> on producing large kernels for high yields. Efforts to improve the yield of durum wheat, either through genetic improvement or by agronomic means, should focus on reducing the levels of stress during the post anthesis period so that limitations to kernel growth are minimised. Improving the early vigour of the crop, having cultivars of the appropriate maturity and with adequate levels of resistance to root disease, and improving root growth and function in the subsoil are likely to be desirable characteristics.

Selected bulks were not superior to non-selected bulks. Head number per unit area had the highest correlation with yield and seed weight was the most heritable trait. Synthetic lines combined better with TAM 111 than TAM 112 in high yielding environments. populations across five Texas locations. Similar to crosses with spring wheat, synthetics contributed to yield through an increase in seed weight. Synthetic populations that produced higher grain yield than both TAM 111 and TAM 112 were able to maintain their large seed size and weight while improving their seed per head and head number traits. Poorer performance in environments with harsh winters could be {{due to a lack of}} winter-hardiness in the primary synthetics. This clearly demonstrates that improving yield, through utilization of common wheat by synthetic crosses, could result from selecting for larger seed per head and heads per unit area in lines driven from these populations.

To determine whether primary synthetic wheats could broaden genetic diversity in Australian <b>bread</b> <b>wheats,</b> genetic similarity between and among 44 primary synthetics and nine modern Australian <b>bread</b> <b>wheats</b> was investigated using Diversity Array Technology™ (DArT). Greater dissimilarity was observed between these germplasm groups than within these groups. The A and B genomes of the primary synthetics were most divergent from the genomes of the <b>bread</b> <b>wheats.</b> These primary synthetics therefore could broaden the genetic diversity in Australian <b>bread</b> <b>wheats.</b> To identify primary synthetic wheats that could improve grain yield of an Australian <b>bread</b> <b>wheat</b> in drought, grain yield and its major components (grain weight and grains per m²) were measured in 27 BC₁ synthetic-derived families of lines in five drought stressed environments in southern Australia. Fourteen families included lines with significantly (p< 0. 05) higher grain yield than Yitpi (recurrent <b>bread</b> <b>wheat</b> parent). These lines produced grain yields up to 12. 0 % higher than Yitpi in the highest yielding environments, where improved grain weights were responsible. In the lowest yielding environments, superior synthetic derivatives achieved grain yields up to 43. 8 % higher than Yitpi, with more grains per m² commonly responsible. Therefore, many {{but not all of}} the primary synthetics assessed could improve grain yield of an Australian <b>bread</b> <b>wheat</b> in drought.

Here, we report molecular evolutionary and biochemical analysis of PMM genes in <b>bread</b> <b>wheat</b> and related Triticeae species. Results Two sets of homoeologous PMM genes (TaPMM- 1 and 2) were found in <b>bread</b> <b>wheat,</b> and two corresponding PMM genes were identified in the diploid progenitors of <b>bread</b> <b>wheat</b> and many other diploid Triticeae species. The duplication event yielding PMM- 1 and 2 occurred before the radiation of diploid Triticeae genomes. The PMM gene family in wheat and relatives may evolve largely under purifying selection. Among the six TaPMM genes, the transcript levels of PMM- 1 members were comparatively high and their recombinant proteins were all enzymatically active. However, PMM- 2 homoeologs exhibited lower transcript levels, two of which were also inactive. TaPMM-A 1, B 1 and D 1 were probably the main active isozymes in <b>bread</b> <b>wheat</b> tissues. The three isozymes differed from their counterparts in barley and Brachypodium distachyon in being more tolerant to elevated test temperatures. Conclusion Our work identified the genes encoding PMM isozymes in <b>bread</b> <b>wheat</b> and relatives, uncovered a unique PMM duplication event in diverse Triticeae species, and revealed the main active PMM isozymes in <b>bread</b> <b>wheat</b> tissues. The knowledge obtained here improves the understanding of PMM evolution in eukaryotic organisms, and may facilitate further investigations of PMM function in the temperature adaptability of <b>bread</b> <b>wheat.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{spontaneous}} translocation of {{the short}} arm of chromosome 1 of rye (1 RS) in <b>bread</b> <b>wheat</b> is associated with higher root biomass and grain yield. Recent studies have confirmed the presence of QTL for different root morphological traits on the 1 RS arm in <b>bread</b> <b>wheat.</b> This {{study was conducted to}} address two questions in wheat root genetics. First, does the presence of the 1 RS arm in <b>bread</b> <b>wheat</b> affect its root anatomy? Second, how does root morphology and anatomy of <b>bread</b> <b>wheat</b> respond to different dosages of 1 RS? Near-isogenic plants with a different number (0 to 4 dosages) of 1 RS translocations were studied for root morphology and anatomy. The F 1 hybrid, with single doses of the 1 RS and 1 AS arms, showed heterosis for root and shoot biomass. In other genotypes, with 0, 2, or 4 doses of 1 RS, root biomass was incremental with the increase in the dosage of 1 RS in <b>bread</b> <b>wheat.</b> This study also provided evidence of the presence of gene(s) influencing root xylem vessel number, size, and distribution in <b>bread</b> <b>wheat.</b> It was found that root vasculature follows a specific developmental pattern {{along the length of the}} tap root and 1 RS dosage tends to affect the transitions differentially in different positions. This study indicated that the inherent differences in root morphology and anatomy of different 1 RS lines may be advantageous compared to normal <b>bread</b> <b>wheat</b> to survive under stress conditions...|$|R

40|$|Fifteen genotypes of <b>bread</b> <b>wheat</b> (Triticum aestivum L.) {{and fifteen}} genotypes {{of durum wheat}} (Triticum durum Desf.) were {{evaluated}} in the multi-environment trial during 2010 - 11. and 2011 - 12 vegetation seasons to investigate components of variance, heritability in a broad sense (h 2), expected genetic advance (GA), and stability of phytic acid (PA), inorganic phosphorus (Pi), phytic phosphorus (Pp) /Pi relation, yellow pigment (YP), water soluble phenolics (WSPH) and free protein sulfhydryl groups (PSH) content. The field trials were carried out at three locations in Serbia, as randomized complete block design with four replications. The genetic component of variance (σ 2 g) predominated the genotype × environment interaction (σ 2 ge) component for: Pi in <b>bread</b> <b>wheat</b> (3. 0 times higher), Pp/Pi in <b>bread</b> <b>wheat</b> (2. 1 times higher) and in durum wheat (1. 2 times higher), YP content in <b>bread</b> <b>wheat</b> (2. 2 times higher) and in durum wheat (1. 7 times higher), and WSPH content in <b>bread</b> <b>wheat</b> (1. 4 times higher). The relation σ 2 g/σ 2 ge for Pi content in durum wheat was equal to one. The σ 2 ge prevailed σ 2 g for: PA in <b>bread</b> <b>wheat</b> (1. 7 times higher) and in durum wheat (5. 7 times higher), PSH in durum wheat (3. 7 times higher), and WSPH in durum wheat (5. 2 times higher). High h 2 coupled with high expected genetic advance as percent of mean (GAM) were observed for: Pi (93. 7 % and 26. 1 %, respectively) in <b>bread</b> <b>wheat,</b> Pp/Pi relation in <b>bread</b> <b>wheat</b> (92. 4 % and 20. 7 %, respectively) and in durum wheat (87. 2 % and 20. 8 %, respectively), YP content in <b>bread</b> <b>wheat</b> (92. 6 % and 28. 0 %, respectively) and in durum wheat (90. 7 % and 28. 1 %, respectively), and WSPH content (88. 9 % and 25. 8 %, respectively) in <b>bread</b> <b>wheat.</b> PA content in <b>bread</b> and durum <b>wheat</b> had medium to medium high h 2 (50. 5 % and 77. 9 %, respectively), and low expected GAM (9. 9 % and 3. 7 %, respectively). GGE biplots with average-environment coordination (AEC) indicated less stability of durum wheat for PA, WSPH and PSH content. [Projekat Ministarstva nauke Republike Srbije, br. TR 31092...|$|R

50|$|Gluten is {{the seed}} storage protein in mature wheat seeds (and informally in {{the seeds of}} closely related species). It is the sticky {{substance}} in <b>bread</b> <b>wheat</b> which allows dough to rise and retain its shape during baking. The same, or very similar, proteins are also found in related grasses within the tribe Triticeae. Seed glutens of some non-Triticeae plants have similar properties, but none can perform {{on a par with}} those of the Triticeae taxa, particularly the Triticum species (<b>bread</b> <b>wheat,</b> durum wheat, etc.). What distinguishes <b>bread</b> <b>wheat</b> from these other grass seeds is the quantity of these proteins and the level of subcomponents, with <b>bread</b> <b>wheat</b> having the highest protein content and a complex mixture of proteins derived from 3 grass species (Aegilops speltoides, Aegilops tauschii strangulata, and Triticum monococcum).|$|R
40|$|Hulled wheat species (einkorn, emmer, spelt) are {{presumed to}} be an {{alternative}} to <b>bread</b> <b>wheat</b> in organic agriculture since the yield penalty is less pronounced under organic farming and generally higher prices can be achieved for specialty grains. The present study analyzed differences between wheat species with respect to biomass production, harvest index, grain yield and protein content. Spring hulled wheat genetic resources and <b>bread</b> <b>wheat</b> check cultivars were grown in organic field trials in the Czech Republic and Austria between 2010 and 2012. Generally, hulled wheat species were inferior in grain yield and distribution of assimilates to the grain compared to modern <b>bread</b> <b>wheat.</b> Biomass production of some emmer and spelt landraces was similar to <b>bread</b> <b>wheat.</b> A higher protein content (+ 3 – 6 %) was observed for spelt, however, considering protein yield the differences between spelt and <b>bread</b> <b>wheat</b> became less pronounced.
