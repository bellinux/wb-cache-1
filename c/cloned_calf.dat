40|$|The {{management}} of clone calves {{is different from}} that of other calves only because of their high value and because of their apparent tendency to develop certain conditions with a higher frequency than conventional calves. These conditions include placental abnormalities, persistent fetal circulation, flexural deformities, large umbilical vessels, and tachypnea. Many clone calves are at high risk of persistent fetal circulation and should be closely monitored by measuring arterial blood gasses; treatment should be early and aggressive. Tolazoline infusion and supplemental oxygen therapy resulted in a successful outcome in several sick clone and conventional calves. It could be argued that the neonatal {{management of}} clone calves is really no different than the neonatal management of any other calf. Many times this is true. However, we now know that some of clone calves are very different from other calves and because the investment in, and potential value of, a <b>clone</b> <b>calf</b> is higher than for many conventional calves, we now handle neonatal clone calves quite differently than {{the way in which we}} handle conventional calves. I do not present myself as an expert in the management of clone calves, nor do I have extensive experience in treating a great number of clone calves. What I will do is related our experienc...|$|R

40|$|Animal cloning {{has been}} {{associated}} with developmental abnormalities, with the level of heteroplasmy caused by the procedure being one of its potential limiting factors. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the effect of the fusion of hemicytoplasts or aggregation of hemiembryos, varying the final cytoplasmic volume, on development and cell density of embryos produced by hand-made cloning (HMC), parthenogenesis or by in vitro fertilization (IVF). One or two enucleated hemicytoplasts were paired and fused with one skin somatic cell. Activated clone and zona-free parthenote embryos and hemiembryos were in vitro cultured in the well-of-the-well (WOW) system, being allocated to one of six experimental groups, on a per WOW basis: single clone or parthenote hemiembryos (1 x 50 %); aggregation of two (2 x 50 %), three (3 x 50 %), or four (4 x 50 %) clone or parthenote hemiembryos; single clone or parthenote embryos (1 x 100 %); or aggregation of two clone or parthenote embryos (2 x 100 %). Control zona-intact parthenote or IVF embryos were in vitro cultured in four-well dishes. Results indicated that the increase in the number of aggregated structures within each WOW was followed by a linear increase in cleavage, blastocyst rate, and cell density. The increase in cytoplasmic volume, either by fusion or by aggregation, had a positive effect on embryo development, supporting the establishment of pregnancies and the birth of a viable <b>clone</b> <b>calf</b> after transfer to recipients. However, embryo aggregation did not improve development on a hemicytoplast basis, except for the aggregation of two clone embryos. Capes/Brazil[192058 /Procad II...|$|R

40|$|The {{most widely}} used vaccine against cattle {{babesiosis}} was blood from a carrier animal. The development of a calf passage attenuated strain in Australia was a great improvement in vaccine safety and efficacy. The degree of immunity generated by this vaccine remains a standard against which to compare other vaccines. Vaccines derived from culture super-natants have also been developed. These have considerable value. To date no efficacious recombinant vaccine exists. A variety of antigens will probably be required in any synthetic vaccine. Study of <b>clones</b> derived from <b>calf</b> passage attenuated vaccines indicate that the vaccine contains a variety of parasites of differing virulence. The attenuation process enriches for the less virulent clones. The clones may also vary in their antigenic characteristics. To date no single clone gives immunity equal to the original uncloned preparation. An ideal vaccine {{should not be a}} living agent. It will probably contain a variety of antigens and may induce less strong immunity than the living vaccine but its greater safety, stability and ease of handling will more than compensate for this. © 1989 Oxford University Press...|$|R
50|$|Starbuck II, clone of {{the famous}} CIAQR sire Hanoverhill Starbuck, was born on 7 September 2000 in Saint-Hyacinthe. The clone {{is a result of}} the {{combined}} efforts of CIAQ, L'Alliance Boviteq Inc and the Faculté de médecine vétérinaire de l'Université de Montréal. The <b>cloned</b> <b>calf</b> was born 21 years and 5 months after Starbuck's own birth date and just under 2 years after his death (17 September 1998). The calf weighed 54.2 kg at birth and showed the same vital signs as calves produced from regular AI or ET. Starbuck II is derived from frozen fibroblast cells, recovered one month before the death of Starbuck.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the in vitro and in vivo development of bovine nuclear-transferred embryos. A bovine fetal fibroblast culture was established and used as nucleus donor. Slaughterhouse oocytes were matured in vitro for 18 h before enucleation. Enucleated oocytes were fused with fetal fibroblasts with an electric stimulus and treated with cytochalasin D and cycloheximide for 1 h followed by cycloheximide alone for 4 h. Reconstructed embryos were cultured for 7 - 9 days and those which developed to blastocysts were transferred to recipient cows. Of 191 enucleated oocytes, 83 (43. 5 %) were successfully fused and 24 (28. 9 %) developed to blastocysts. Eighteen freshly cloned blastocysts were transferred to 14 recipients, 5 (27. 8 %) of which were pregnant on day 35 and 3 (16. 7 %) on day 90. Of the three cows that reached the third trimester, one recipient died of hydrallantois 2 months before term, one aborted fetus was recovered at 8 months of gestation, and one delivered by cesarian section a healthy <b>cloned</b> <b>calf.</b> Today, the <b>cloned</b> <b>calf</b> is 15 months old and presents normal body development (378 kg) and sexual behavior (libido and semen characteristics) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{production}} of a healthy <b>cloned</b> <b>calf</b> is dependent on a multitude of successful steps, including reprogramming mediated by the oocyte, {{the development of a}} functional placenta, adequate maternal-fetal interaction, the establishment of a physiological metabolic setting and the formation of a complete set of well-differentiated cells that will eventually result in well-characterised and fully competent tissues and organs. Although the efficiency of nuclear transfer has improved significantly since the first report of a somatic cell nuclear transfer-derived animal, there are many descriptions of anomalies concerning cloned calves leading to high perinatal morbidity and mortality. The present article discusses some our experience regarding perinatal and neonatal procedures for cloned Zebu cattle (B. indicus) that has led to improved survival rates in Nellore cloned calves following the application of such `labour-intensive technology`...|$|E
40|$|Studies were {{conducted}} to explore the possibility of employing dromedary camel (Camelus dromedarius) oocytes as recipient cytoplasts {{for the development of}} interspecies somatic cell nuclear transfer (iSCNT) embryos using skin fibroblast cells of an adult Bactrian camel (Camelus bactrianus) and Llama (Llama glama) as donor nuclei. Also, the embryos reconstructed with Bactrian cells were transferred into the uterus of synchronized dromedary camel recipients to explore the possibility of using them as surrogate mothers. Serum-starved skin fibroblast cells were injected into the perivitelline space of enucleated mature oocytes, collected from super-stimulated dromedary camels, and fused using an Eppendorf electroporator. After activation with 5 μM ionomycin and 6 -dimethylaminopurine, they were cultured at 38. 5 °C in an atmosphere of 5 % CO 2, 5 % O 2, and 90 % N 2 in air. In experiment 1, Day 7 blastocysts were stained with Hoechst to count their cell numbers, while in experiment 2, they were transferred to synchronized dromedary recipients. A lower number (P < 0. 05) of blastocysts were obtained from reconstructs utilizing fibroblast cells from Llama when compared with those reconstructed with dromedary and Bactrian fibroblast cells. However, no difference was observed in their cell numbers. In experiment 2, a higher (P < 0. 05) proportion of blastocysts were obtained from the cleaved embryos reconstructed with Bactrian fibroblast cells when compared to those reconstructed with dromedary cells. Twenty-six Day 7 blastocysts reconstructed with Bactrian cells were transferred to 23 synchronized dromedary recipients with 5 pregnancies established on Day 30, however, only one of the pregnancies developed to term and a healthy calf weighing 33 kgs was born after completing 392 days of gestation. Unfortunately, the calf died on day 7 due to acute septicemia. In conclusion, the present study reports, for the first time, birth of a <b>cloned</b> Bactrian <b>calf</b> by iSCNT using dromedary camel as a source for oocytes as well as a surrogate for carrying the pregnancy to term...|$|R
40|$|Nuclear {{inhibitor}} {{of protein}} phosphatase- 1 (NIPP- 1) {{is one of}} two major regulatory subunits of protein phosphatase- 1 in mammalian nuclei. We report here the cloning and structural characterization of the human NIPP- 1 genes, designated PPP 1 R 8 P and PPP 1 R 8 in human gene nomenclature. PPP 1 R 8 P (1. 2 kb) is a processed pseudogene and was localized by in situ hybridization to chromosome 1 p 33 - 32. PPP 1 R 8 is an authentic NIPP- 1 gene and was localized to chromosome 1 p 35. PPP 1 R 8 (25. 2 kb) is composed of seven exons and encodes four different transcripts, as determined from cDNA library screening, reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) and/or EST (expressed sequence tag) database search analysis. NIPP- 1 alpha mRNA represents the major transcript in human tissues and various cell lines, and encodes a polypeptide of 351 residues that only differs from the previously <b>cloned</b> <b>calf</b> thymus NIPP- 1 by a single residue. The other transcripts, termed NIPP- 1 beta, gamma and delta, are generated by alternative 5 '-splice site usage, by exon skipping and/or by alternative polyadenylation. The NIPP- 1 beta/delta and NIPP- 1 gamma mRNAs are expected to encode fragments of NIPP- 1 alpha that differ from the latter by the absence of the first 142 and 224 residues, respectively. NIPP- 1 gamma corresponds to 'activator of RNA decay- 1 ' (Ard- 1) which, unlike NIPP- 1 alpha, displays in vitro and endoribonuclease activity and lacks an RVXF consensus motif for interaction with protein phosphatase- 1. While the NIPP- 1 alpha/beta/delta-transcripts were found to be present in various human tissues, the NIPP- 1 gamma transcript could only be detected in human transformed B-lymphocytes. status: publishe...|$|E
