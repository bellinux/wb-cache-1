However, the United States and the European Union remain a priority on his agenda.|$|E
50|$|The first Romanian {{known to}} have been to what is now the United States was Samuel Damian (also spelled Domien), a priest. Samuel Damian's name appears as far back as 1748, when he placed an {{advertisement}} in the South Carolina Gazette announcing the electrical demonstrations he planned to give and inviting the public to attend. Letters written in 1753 and 1755 by Benjamin Franklin attest {{to the fact that the}} two had met and had carried on discussions <b>concerning</b> <b>electricity.</b> Damian remained in the States some years living in South Carolina, then travelled on to Jamaica and disappeared from historical record.|$|E
40|$|The energy {{consumption}} issue in distributed computing systems raises various monetary, environmental and system performance <b>concerns.</b> <b>Electricity</b> {{consumption in the}} US doubled from 2000 to 2005. From a financial and environmental standpoint, reducing the consumption of electricity is important, yet these reforms must not lead to performance degradation of the computing systems. These contradicting constraints create a suite of complex problems {{that need to be}} resolved in order to lead to 'greener' distributed computing systems. This book brings together a group of outstanding researchers that investigate the different facets of green and energy efficient distributed computing. Key features. One of the first books of its kind. Features latest research findings on emerging topics by well-known scientists. Valuable research for grad students, postdocs, and researchers.

40|$|Account {{of power}} losses arising by <b>electricity</b> supply <b>concerns</b> <b>electricity</b> {{producers}} and consumers. As {{a result of}} extensive studies, various methods {{to solve this problem}} are known. Here the method based on the increments of power losses is presented. This method requires knowledge of reciprocal current which flows from a supplier to a particular consumer. The increments of power losses are obtained increasing the node currents by a small increment of reciprocal currents. In such a way, the reciprocal losses, caused by power delivered by one supplier to a particular consumer are determined. In transmission lines, the reciprocal losses are determined in a similar way. Balance of currents observed, the sum of all reciprocal losses does not depend on reciprocal currents. However summary losses of a supplier or consumer can be determined by summation of its reciprocal losses but they depend on reciprocal currents. The choice of principle of reciprocal current definition is achieved by agreements between the parties...|$|R
5000|$|Notwithstanding the {{potential}} for innovation, rabbis and Jewish communities differ greatly on how they make changes in halakha. Notably, poskim frequently extend {{the application of a}} law to new situations, but do not consider such applications as constituting a [...] "change" [...] in halakha. For example, many Orthodox rulings <b>concerning</b> <b>electricity</b> are derived from rulings concerning fire, as closing an electrical circuit may case a spark. In contrast, Conservative poskim consider that switching on electrical equipment is physically and chemically more like turning on a water tap (which is permissible by halakha) than lighting a fire (which is not permissible), and therefore permitted on Shabbat. The reformative Judaism in some cases explicitly interprets halakha to take into account its view of contemporary society. For instance, most Conservative rabbis extend the application of certain Jewish obligations and permissible activities to women (see How halakha is viewed today below).|$|E
40|$|Functional linear {{regression}} model linking observations of a functional response variable with measurements of an explanatory functional variable is considered. The slope function is estimated with a tensor product splines. Some computational issues are addressed {{by means of}} a simulation study.

40|$|In 2010, the Czech Republic {{was one of}} {{the states}} of the European Union, which met the {{indicative}} target for the share of renewable energy sources in gross electricity consumption. That year, gross electricity generation from renewable sources amounted to a total volume of 5851 GWh, which corresponds to 8. 24 % of gross electricity consumption in the Czech Republic in the given time period. The largest share of the total came from hydroelectric power plants (47. 7 %) and biomass power plants (25. 8 %), and a smaller share from photovoltaic power plants (10. 5 %), biogas power plants (8. 7 %) and wind farms (5. 7 %). Compared with 2009, the highest year-on-year growth came from photovoltaic power plants (527 GWh, 44. 2 %) and, as far as other renewable sources are <b>concerned,</b> <b>electricity</b> generation at hydroelectric power plants (360 GWh, 30. 2 %) and biogas power plants (184 GWh, 15. 4 %) rose more sharply as well.

40|$|Reducing energy {{consumption}} in buildings {{of all kinds}} is a key challenge for researchers since it can help to notably reduce the waste of energy and its associated costs. However, when dealing with residential environments, {{there is a major}} problem, people comfort should not be altered, so it is necessary to look for smart methods which take into account this circumstance. Traditional techniques have not considered the study of human behavior when providing solutions in this field, but new human-centric paradigms are emerging gradually. We present our research on user behavior <b>concerning</b> <b>electricity</b> consumption in office buildings and residential environments. Our goal consists of inspiring practitioners in this field for developing new human-aware solutions...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a new goodness-of-fit testing scheme for the {{marginal}} distribution of regime-switching models. We consider models with an observable (like threshold autoregressions), as well as, a latent state process (like Markov regime-switching). The test is based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov supremum-distance statistic and the concept of the weighted empirical distribution function. The motivation for this research comes from a recent stream of literature in energy economics <b>concerning</b> <b>electricity</b> spot price models. While the existence of distinct regimes in such data is generally unquestionable (due to the supply stack structure), the actual goodness-of-fit of the models requires statistical validation. We illustrate the proposed scheme by testing whether a commonly used Markov regime-switching model fits deseasonalized electricity prices from the NEPOOL (U. S.) day-ahead market. ...|$|E

I presented the concepts of electricity and electrical current, respectively, and several simple devices that operate on the basis of electricity, sources and the concept of electric energy. 	 In the empirical part I first presented the questionnaire for identification of children's understanding of the concept of electricity. Based on the survey results analysis, obtained with individual interviews, I prepared the set of activities for getting to know the electrical circuit, and presented them to the children via experiments. After that, I’ve checked the children’s perception of electricity again and made the comparison of the results before and after the test. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{compares the}} Greenhouse Gas (GHG) {{emission}} inventories of Madrid and Salvador and discusses some implications for future researches, focusing on citylevel carbon accounting (CLCA) of emissions from urban supply chains (USC) and final consumers. To {{carry out this}} study, secondary {{data were collected from}} official documents of municipal governments of these two cities. According to the results, there are differences in stationary energy GHG emissions due to the big distinction <b>concerning</b> <b>electricity</b> emission factors used by each city. Air transportation GHG emissions are also very different. These two cities share some common figures regarding road transportation and per capita waste sector GHG emissions. In the conclusion section, we discuss opportunities for improvement of the cities’ GHG emission inventories as well as some implications for policy-making and future researches on carbon accounting, with focus on an integrated production-consumption system...|$|E
