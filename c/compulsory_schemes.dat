25|$|The Cornwallis Code, while {{defining}} {{the rights of}} the proprietors, failed to give adequate recognition to {{the rights of the}} under-tenants and the cultivators. This remained a serious problem for the duration of British Rule, as throughout the Bengal Presidency ryots (peasants) found themselves oppressed by rack-renting landlords, who knew that every rupee they could squeeze from their tenants over and above the fixed revenue demanded from the Government represented pure profit. Furthermore, the Permanent Settlement took no account of inflation, meaning that the value of the revenue to Government declined year by year, whilst the heavy burden on the peasantry grew no less. This was compounded in the early 19th century by <b>compulsory</b> <b>schemes</b> for the cultivation of Opium and Indigo, the former by the state, and the latter by British planters (most especially in the district of Tirhut in Bihar). Peasants were forced to grow a certain area of these crops, which were then purchased at below market rates for export. This added greatly to rural poverty.|$|E
40|$|Administration {{is vital}} for health care. Its {{importance}} may increase as health care systems become more complex, but academic attention has remained minimal. We investigated trends in administrative expenditure across OECD countries, cross-country spending differences, spending differences between health care system typologies, and differences in the scale and scope of administrative functions across typologies. We used OECD data, which include health system governance and financing-related administrative activities by regulators, governance bodies, and insurers (macrolevel), but exclude administrative expenditure by health care providers (mesolevel and microlevel). We find that governance and financing-related administrative spending at the macrolevel has remained stable {{over the last decade}} at slightly over 3 % of total health spending. Cross-country differences range from 1. 3 % of health spending in Iceland to 8. 3 % in the United States. Voluntary private health insurance bears much higher administrative costs than <b>compulsory</b> <b>schemes</b> in all countries. Among <b>compulsory</b> <b>schemes,</b> multiple payers exhibit significantly higher administrative spending than single payers. Among single-payer schemes, those where entitlements are based on residency have significantly lower administrative spending than those with single social health insurance, albeit with a small difference. These differences can partially be explained because multi-payer and voluntary private health insurance schemes require additional administrative functions and enjoy less economies of scale. Studies in hospitals and primary care indicate similar differences in administrative costs across health system typologies at the mesolevel and microlevel of health care delivery, which warrants more research on total administrative costs at all the levels of health system...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{developing}} countries, where {{health insurance}} {{is not a}} commonly purchased financial instrument, recent debates have revolved around extend-ing health insurance coverage to {{a wider range of}} the population, primarily via compulsory insurance schemes. However, these debates rarely consider the competing demands placed on the family budget, which will unfluence the acceptability of the program by the populace, and can be used to design the optimal policy. In this paper, we examine treatment effects associated with household insurance status providing a detailed examination of expenditure substitution patterns within a highly unequal developing country. In agree-ment with economic theory, the expansion of health insurance coverage via <b>compulsory</b> <b>schemes</b> creates additional burdens for households, which house-hold accommodate via expenditure substitution. The observed variation in the household’s ability to accomodate increased expenditure can and should be used in future to assess policy options and design an optimal social health insurance program...|$|E

30|$|Regarding health insurance, Liu et al. (2012) report {{significant}} differences in health insurance coverage between Vietnam and China (employing a data set containing observations from two provinces {{at different levels of}} economic development, Shandong and Ningxia) although the two countries share similar systems and socio-economic properties. Through a survey of six counties in China, the authors reported coverage rates ranging from 85 to 91  %, but the rate is much lower in Vietnam, which is about 50  %, including both voluntary and <b>compulsory</b> <b>schemes.</b> Still, while insurance coverage levels may be high in rural China, the benefit package is limited and co-payment ratio is high, disadvantaging the poor. Dang et al. (2006) offered a detailed comparison between the Chinese and Vietnamese. Vietnamese patients with health insurance are significantly more likely than uninsured to utilise in-patient services (Liu et al. 2012 : p. 5). Vietnamese perceive that the insured receive poorer quality of services than non-members, reflecting their complaints that using insurance leads to prescription of only limited types and amounts of medicine and longer waiting time. Thus, it is quite common that insured patients go to private drug sellers for medicines that are ineligible under the public scheme (Liu et al. 2012 : p. 6). With respect to the common practice of using private healthcare providers, a ready explanation is because patients are not seriously ill and therefore do not require complicated process of treatment. However, there are other factors also taken into account in making such decisions: (a) inadequate understanding of the risk of inappropriate treatment; (b) convenience for patients’ relatives; and, (c) trust on ‘rumors’ about reputation and efficacy of treatment methods by some local physicians, especially in rural areas where the use of traditional medicines (including herbal medicines) is common.|$|E
40|$|Retirement {{systems are}} {{generally}} classified into two categories, namely, defined benefit (DB) and defined contribution (DC) plans. These plans {{differ in the}} method {{used to determine the}} benefits, or in the distribution of risk. While reducing the provision of the DB plan and replacing the DB plan with the DC plan are the contemporary trends world-wide, DB and DC plans still constitute the two major types of retirement schemes. Consequently, to choose between the two options is among the decisions faced by individuals and organisations. Alternatively, an individual may also voluntarily set up his or her own supplementary retirement plans through savings. Malaysia, like many other developing countries, continues to face the problem of an ageing population which has become increasingly important to tackle. Consequently, employers, the government and employees need to make tough decisions to formulate the best retirement plan that can satisfy and {{meet the needs of the}} Malaysian workforce. Since there has been no study that has focused on the choice between the DB and DC retirement plans and the satisfaction of the workforce with the existing retirement plans in Malaysia, this is a gap that this research attempts to fill. Moreover, individual employees’ retirement decisions and choice patterns have not been extensively investigated despite the fact that their inputs are vital due to the greater responsibility of employees to set up their own retirement plans in the future. This research aims to study the factors predictors) that influence the type of retirement plans chosen by Malaysian public universities’ employees guided by the Bounded-Rationality-Theory. The factors that influence and help predict the choice of retirement plans include demographic-features, knowledge level, voluntary savings perceptions, extension of working years beyond retirement, health status, peer effects, retirement income sources, preferences for certain plan features, mobility, job aspects and risk-benefit considerations. The research output from this study will provide intelligence and advice on retirement behaviour of Malaysian civil servants who are expected to decide on: (1) choice between DB (PENSION) versus DC (Employee Provident Fund/EPF) schemes; and (2) choice between owning versus not-owning any voluntary retirement scheme. Employing the multidimensional positivist paradigm, the researcher has conducted a questionnaire survey involving 348 Malaysian public university employees with a stratified random sampling method to collect primary data. Questionnaire feedback and responses were analysed applying two main binary models of logistic-regression. Eleven semi-structured interviews were analysed using the content analysis technique to complement the questionnaire results. The results were illuminating. First, they revealed an above-average level of satisfaction perceived by employees. Second, a statistically significant difference in satisfaction between the EPF and PENSION schemes has been found with higher satisfaction being recorded within the PENSION group. As for the voluntary scheme choice, the OWN group were significantly more satisfied compared to the NOT-OWN group. Knowledge, demographics, retirement income sources and plan features were variables found to influence the choice of <b>compulsory</b> <b>schemes.</b> The same variables, together with perceptions on voluntary savings, job related aspects, extension of working years beyond retirement, health status as well as preferences on risk and benefits were found to influence the decision to buy a voluntary scheme. There were no major contradictions between the qualitative findings and the quantitative results. The findings will be beneficial not only to the government in improving the national retirement system, but also to the industrial players in targeting potential customers for their retirement products...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the current debate on health system reform by assessing the impact of insurance market organization {{on the price of}} prescription drugs. In contrast to the classic model à la Rothschild/Stiglitz (1976), a difference exists between the monetary evaluation of the discomfort caused by the illness and the price of medication. We focus on both the adverse effects on access to drugs and the structure of the health insurance system: compulsory versus voluntary, and private versus public. While the prescription drug is always consumed when its price is inferior or equal to the discomfort, only the presence of an insurance market allows its consumption at a higher price. In addition, whatever the market type, the distortion (the difference between the drug price and the perception of price) is greater under a <b>compulsory</b> <b>scheme</b> than under a voluntary scheme. Moreover, we show that with imperfect information the distortion is always higher for the high-risk type than for the low-risk, whereas under a private regime with full information this ranking is reversed. A surprising result is that the distinction between damage and repairs induces potential non-participation of one type despite competition. Under both perfect and imperfect information, the <b>compulsory</b> <b>scheme</b> Pareto-dominates the vol-untary scheme in the private regime whereas this no longer holds in the public regime. ...|$|R

This paper provides an empirical assessment {{of the influence of}} Vietnam's health insurance schemes on both hospital admission and the length of stay (LOS) using the Vietnam National Health Survey 2001 - 2002 and an appropriate count data regression model. Our findings suggest that the influence of health insurance on hospital admission and the LOS varies across insurance <b>schemes.</b> The <b>compulsory</b> insurance <b>scheme</b> and the insurance scheme for the poor increase the expected LOS by factors of 1. 18 and 1. 39, respectively, while the voluntary insurance scheme has minimal effect on the expected LOS. Insurance also increases the likelihood of hospital admission far more for compulsory members than for members of the other two insurance schemes. The positive influence of insurance on hospital admission and the LOS also varies across income quintiles, regions and types of health facilities. While the <b>compulsory</b> and voluntary <b>schemes</b> increase the likelihood of hospital admission more for lower and middle income individuals, the influence of the <b>compulsory</b> <b>scheme</b> on the expected LOS is more pronounced for patients in the middle income groups.
