In the valley of Barcarena, a few kilometres westward from Lisbon, {{it was possible to}} detect the intermittent flow of the <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> drainage during two calm clear nights.

40|$|A {{climatology}} {{of clouds}} within marine <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> outbreaks, primarily using long-term satellite observations, is presented. Cloud properties between <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> outbreaks in different regions in both hemispheres are compared. In all regions marine <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> outbreak clouds {{tend to be}} low level with high cloud fraction and low-to-moderate optical thickness. Stronger <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> outbreaks have clouds that are optically thicker, but not geometrically thicker, than those in weaker <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> outbreaks.

The top-of-the-atmosphere longwave cloud radiative effect in <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> outbreaks is small because the clouds have low tops. However, their surface longwave cloud radiative effect is considerably larger. The rarity of <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> outbreaks in summer limits their shortwave cloud radiative effect. They do not contribute substantially to global shortwave cloud radiative effect and are, therefore, unlikely to be a major source of shortwave cloud radiative effect errors in climate models...|$|R
50|$|The {{effects of}} <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> damming {{east of the}} Cascades in Washington are {{strengthened}} by the bowl or basin-like topography of Eastern Washington. <b>Cold</b> Arctic <b>air</b> flowing south from British Columbia through the Okanogan River valley fills the basin, blocked to the south by the Blue Mountains. <b>Cold</b> <b>air</b> damming causes the <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> to bank up along the eastern Cascade slopes, especially into the lower passes, such as Snoqualmie Pass and Stevens Pass. Milder, Pacific-influenced air moving east over the Cascades is often forced aloft by the <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> in the passes, {{held in place by}} <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> damming east of the Cascades.

40|$|Measurements of climatic {{processes}} such as <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> drainage flows are problematic over mountainous areas. Observation of <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> drainage is {{not available}} in the existing observation network and it requires a special methodology. The main objective {{of this study was}} to characterize the <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> drainage over regions with a slope. A high resolution infrared camera, a meteorological station and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) were used. The specific objective was to derive nocturnal <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> drainage velocity over the slope. To address these objectives, a number of infrared measurement campaigns were conducted during calm and clear sky conditions over an agricultural zone (blackcurrant farm) in Canada. Using thermal infrared images, the nocturnal surface temperature gradient were computed in hourly basis. The largest gradient magnitudes were found between 17 h - 20 h. The cooling rates at basin area were two times higher in comparison to the magnitudes observed within slope area. The image analysis illustrated this considerable temperature gradient of the basin may be partly due to transport of <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> drainage into the basin from the slope. The results show that thermal imagery can be used to characterize and understand the microclimate related to the occurrence of radiation frost in the agricultural field. This study provided the opportunity to track the <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> drainage flow and pooling of <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> in low lying areas.

In order to do this, land-use patterns of the year 1810 and 1910 are reconstructed. Furthermore, potential land-use scenarios are developed, considering both a scenario with beneficial <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> drainage characteristics and a second adverse scenario.

The experiment was performed during a cold event during 27 – 28 April 2013. Blood pressure, catecholamine, angiotensin II (ANG-II), cardiac troponin I (cTnI), muscle myoglobin (Mb) and endothefin- 1 (ET- 1) levels of the subjects were evaluated 1 day before, during the 2 nd day of the cold exposure and 1 day after the <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> exposure. Our results suggest that <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> exposure increases blood pressure in cardiovascular disease patients and healthy subjects via the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) that is activated first and which augments ANG-II levels accelerating the release of the norepinephrine and stimulates the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). The combined effect of these factors leads to a rise in blood pressure. In addition, <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> exposure can cause significant metabolism and secretion of Mb, cTnI and ET- 1 in subjects; taking the patient group as an example, ET- 1 was 202. 7 ng/L during the <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> exposure, increased 58 ng/L compared with before the <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> exposure, Mb and cTnI levels remained relatively high (2, 219. 5 ng/L and 613. 2 ng/L, increased 642. 1 ng/L and 306. 5 ng/L compared with before the <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> exposure, respectively) 1 -day after the cold exposure.

5000|$|With {{all this}} solar radiation, {{the air around}} the tropics begins to warm up. Because hot air is less dense than <b>cold</b> <b>air,</b> the hot air rises into the upper levels of the {{atmosphere}} and as a result, <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> filters down into {{the lower levels of}} the atmosphere. The dynamics that provide the tropics with the rain belt are founded on the principal that warmer air is able to retain more moisture than <b>colder</b> <b>air.</b> When the <b>colder</b> <b>air</b> replaces the warmer air in the lower atmosphere, the abundant moisture from the tropics loses the ability to be stored in the atmosphere.

40|$|The {{aspects of}} nocturnal <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> {{drainage}} flow were investigated in two suburban valleys {{of the city}} of Aachen, Germany, during a two year measurement period – from February 2009 to February 2011. The investigation intended to answer the following questions: 1. What are the characteristics of <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> drainage flow in the suburban valleys {{of the city of}} Aachen? 2. How does vegetation – especially trees and hedges – affect the <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> drainage flow? 3. Can these effects be reproduced by a model, calibrated with the collected data?In 2009 four weather stations were set up, each of them representing different locations within the valleys. One of them collected data of <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> drainage without being influenced by vegetation. The data of this station was used as a reference for a comparative analysis. The other three stations were placed within vegetation stands, one at the lee side of a hedge and two at the lee side of a grove of alders with a height of up to 15 m. Halfway through the measurement period a section of the hedge and several alders were cut down, in order to get two data sets for comparison. This data was complemented by mobile cross valley section and tethered balloon measurements, as well as by air quality measurements and measurements taken from busses carrying GPS equipment and temperature sensors. Data evaluation took account of annual and seasonal variations in regard to changing vegetation structures. In order to improve the input detail for modeling and model calibration further, the vegetation in two larger areas within the valleys was mapped. Modeling was done by the numerical <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> drainage flow model KLAM_ 21 from the DWD (Deutscher Wetterdienst/German Weather Service). The results show that vegetation has a considerable effect on <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> drainage, differing for each location and climatic element measured: The wind speed of <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> is reduced by vegetation structures and influenced by the density and diameter of the vegetation and the vegetated surface. Therefore wind can vary over short distances. A large expanse of vegetation has a large effect on wind speed. Increased surface roughness, e. g. caused by hedges or trees, reduces wind speed. Wind speed can be directly impacted by changing surface roughness, for instance by reducing tree coverage. Additionally wind speed shows annual and seasonal variations. Wind direction as well as wind speed is influenced by the vegetation within the valley. Thus different wind directions were measured at different heights but in the same location. Large expanses of dense vegetation can block and deviate <b>cold</b> <b>air,</b> which can even result in an overflow into surrounding valleys. Vegetation shades the valley surface, influencing surface and soil temperatures and consequently <b>air</b> temperature. Therefore <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> production rates change. This was proved by calculation, mobile measurements and modeling. Air quality has to be considered carefully, taking account of the origin of <b>cold</b> <b>air.</b> In case of clean air, e. g. originated from non-industrialized areas with less traffic, air quality can be improved by <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> drainage. In case of noxious substances polluting the <b>cold</b> <b>air,</b> air quality can be decreased. The area of investigation shows increased amounts of (presumably biogenic) particulate matter within the drainage flow, derived from the valley vegetation. A good match between modeled and measured data was achieved by calibrating the <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> drain-age flow model with high-resolution land use data. This allows the results to be transferred to sur-rounding valleys. Modeled and measured results are presented in a diagram showing <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> drain-age behavior related to obstacles. The investigated area shows, although a severe data filtering process has been carried out, a high frequency of nocturnal <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> drainage flow with <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> at high altitudes. The presence of <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> within urban areas was proved, by setting up, amongst others, a measurement system carried by public transport busses. At a small scale it was proved, that even vegetation with the highest density is permeable to <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> drainage. Vegetation is not able to cause effects like buildings. In order {{to increase the amount of}} <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> drainage considerably, major changes in vegetation structures have to be carried out. A critical review on height and density within suburban valleys can be helpful to city planners, especially in light of rising urban temperatures due to climate change. Nevertheless, suburban valleys cannot be characterized solely by climatological factors, as this single-disciplinary view on their functions would be inadequate. An interdisciplinary assessment in due consideration of all functions, like biodiversity, local recreation, is advisable...|$|R

40|$|A {{case study}} of nocturnal {{drainage}} flow is presented. The flow descends a gentle slope of a few percent extending about one half kilometer down to Roskilde Fjord in northeast Denmark. Opposing larger scale flow initially delays the advance of the drainage flow. After several hours delay, the drainage flow arrives at the coast as a sudden relatively deep surge of <b>cold</b> <b>air.</b> This surge of <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> significantly disturbs the immediate overlying flow. Even though the surge of <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> is characterized by high Richardson number and weak turbulent activity, this drainage front induces low Richardson number and significant turbulent activity in the overlying flow resulting in an “upside down ” structure to the “boundary layer”. The drainage flow following the initial surge is thinner, weaker and nearly stationary except for occasional thicker pulses of <b>cold</b> <b>air.</b> 1...|$|R
