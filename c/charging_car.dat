5000|$|The works was {{situated}} by the dam marking the upper tidal {{limit of the}} river, where Swalwell Juniors F.C. now stands. The CPP which washed and blended the coal prior to the coking process stood at the north-eastern end of the site, along with large storage bunkers. A conveyor fed blended coal from these bunkers into another bunker {{on top of the}} ovens which in turn fed the <b>charging</b> <b>car.</b> The ovens themselves were parallel to the A694, which passes the site, and stood on the area of land now occupied by the two football pitches. There were several railway sidings for both coal and coke between the ovens and the road. The pusher was {{on the opposite side of}} the ovens, and the coke was shoved out on the side nearest the road. The quenching tower was at the north-eastern end of the battery of ovens, near the CPP, and the chimney was at the opposite end. Between the ovens and the river were the power plant with its associated boilers and chimneys, as well as the by-products plant. The latter [...] "scrubbed" [...] the gas produced in the ovens, extracting chemicals such as tar and ammonia, which were piped into storage tanks. The gas was then stored in a tall gas holder to the south-east of the site, near the river.|$|E
5000|$|The {{prepared}} coal {{charge in the}} coal tower is drawn by a <b>charging</b> <b>car</b> {{on the top of}} the batteries and charged into the ovens as per sequence. The charged coal is gradually heated by the heating wall of the oven in the absence of air to attain a temperature of 1000°-1050 °C at the central axis of the coke mass toward the end of coking period. the coking period is generally specified between 16 hrs and 19 hrs depending on oven condition and production requirement. the volatile matter of coal liberated during carbonization is collected in gas collecting mains in the form of raw coke oven gas passing through stand pipes and direct contact cooling with ammonia liquor spray. The gas cooled from 800 °C is drawn to coal chemical plant by exhauster. The residual coke is pushed out of the oven by pusher car through a guide into coke bucket. The red hot coke is taken to coke dry cooling plant for cooling.There are 4 batteries, each having 67 ovens each. Each oven can hold 32 tons of dry coal charge. The volumetric capacity of each oven is 41.6 cum the heat for carbonation is supplied by under firing of coke oven gas having CV of 4200 Kcal/Nm3 of mixture of BF gas & CO gas having 900 Kcal/Nm3. The heating system of batteries is of under jet, compound type having twin-heating flues with re-circulation of waste gases.its ...|$|E

By 2003, Lithia had {{revenues}} of $2.5 billion from its 84 dealerships while employing just over 5,500 people. The company had increased dealerships to 88 by 2005. Lithia was fined $500,000 {{by the state of}} Alaska in 2006 for <b>charging</b> <b>car</b> buyers illegal document preparation fees at their Alaska dealerships. That year, they also settled with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for workplace discrimination. In early 2007, Lithia began plans to build a 60 acre auto mall north of downtown Medford and to build a new corporate headquarters in downtown Medford. The Chrysler Jeep Dodge store moved to the auto mall in September 2007, but the project was put on hold for seven years because the recession hit shortly after. In late 2014, Lithia moved their Honda, Nissan, BMW, and Volkswagen stores to the auto mall. The group's Toyota store, which the group had planned to move to the auto mall, instead went through a $1.5 million renovation in 2013 and stayed on their 5-acre site in downtown Medford. [...] In 2010, it was reported that with the backing of two lenders, “the Commons”, a mixed-use building with Lithia Headquarters as the largest tenant, was a “go” and could proceed with construction. According to an article by The Mail Tribune, “Lithia partnered with the Medford Urban Renewal Agency to create The Commons, a revitalization project that includes the headquarters and another $14 million in infrastructure and three park blocks paid for with MURA dollars. Lithia employees moved into their new headquarters in late 2012. In January, 2014 the Commons building was awarded Silver Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Certification by the U.S. Green Building Council. Lithia has been the recipient of numerous awards, including Sports Illustrated's All-Star Dealer Award in 1990 and Time's Quality Dealer Award in 1997, 2016 Top Workplace-Oregon Award, 2016 Automotive News Best Dealerships to Work For and 2016 Fortune 500-40th Fastest Growing Company.|$|E

40|$|Wireless {{charging}} is {{an important}} issue in wireless sensor networks, since it can provide an emerging and effective solution in the absence of other power supplies. The state-of-the-art methods employ a mobile car and a predefined moving path to charge the sensor nodes in the network. Previous studies only consider a factor of the network (i. e., residual energy of sensor node) as a constraint to design the wireless charging strategy. However, other factors, such as the travelled distance of the mobile car, can also affect the effectiveness of wireless charging strategy. In this work, we study wireless charging strategy based on the analysis of a combination of two factors, including the residual energy of sensor nodes and the travelled distance of the <b>charging</b> <b>car.</b> Firstly, we theoretically analyze the limited size of the sensor network to match the capability of a <b>charging</b> <b>car.</b> Then, the networked factors are selected as the weights of traveling salesman problem (TSP) to design the moving path of the <b>charging</b> <b>car.</b> Thirdly, the charging time of each sensor node is computed based on the linear programming problem for the <b>charging</b> <b>car.</b> Finally, a charging period for the network is studied.

40|$|Contactless Power Transfer (CPT) is {{the process}} of {{transferring}} power between two or more physically unconnected electric circuits or devices by means of magnetic induction. The potential application of CPT can range from power transfer to low power home and office appliances to high power industrial systems. Medical, marine, transportation, battery charging applications where physical connections are either dangerous or impossible or inconvenient are all prospective candidates for use of this technology. This thesis mainly concentrates on development of fundamental theory of CPT and application of CPT technology in achieving driving range extension of Electric Vehicles (EV). The work in this thesis can be divided into three broad categories which are, analysis and development of design criteria of a CPT system, experimental and practical implementation, and range extension studies with on-road charging of EVs using CPT technology. The main component of a CPT system is the specially constructed transformer with a large air gap between the primary and secondary winding. In order to achieve efficient power transfer through this large air gap, the principle of resonance is used. To increase the power transfer capability and to reduce the VA rating of the CPT system, capacitive compensation is used in both primary and secondary winding. In this regard, Series-Series (SS), Series-Parallel (SP), Parallel-Series (PS) and Parallel-Parallel (PP) topologies are analysed and design criteria for efficient and stable operation are presented. Constant current mode and constant voltage mode operation of SS compensated system are discussed and it is concluded that SS compensation topology is the most suitable topology for battery charging application. Power electronic requirements for efficient power transfer are investigated and it is concluded that use of active rectifiers in the output stage provide more controlling options and higher power transfer efficiency. To test the many analytically deduced design considerations and feasibility of a CPT system with respect to the efficiency of power transfer, an experimental setup is built. The efficiency of power transfer was measured to be close to 91 %. But since DC power is required at the output to accomplish battery charging process, full bridge diode rectifier is employed in the output stage causing additional losses in the system which brings down the overall efficiency of system to 83. 2 %. To reduce losses in the rectifier stage, use of active rectifier is recommended. Later, CPT charging process is successfully demonstrated on MagIC (Magnetically Induced <b>Charging)</b> <b>car,</b> which is a radio controlled car with super capacitors acting as the on-board energy storage. Due to the multitude of advantages associated with CPT technology, the use of this technology in EV charging application is considered. In particular, application of CPT technology in on-road charge replenishment of EVs is discussed with the help of two case studies. In the first case study, urban driving scenario is considered in which it is assumed that CPT systems are installed at traffic signals and CPT for charge replenishment would occur whenever the EV stops at a red light. From this case study, it is inferred that, for the various urban driving cycles under consideration, considerable driving range enhancement is achievable i. e., the driving range of the EV would be more than doubled with CPT of 20 kW. In the second case study, highway driving scenario is considered in which charge replenishment occurs when the EV drives over the primary winding buried underneath the highway. From this case study, it is concluded that to attain considerable range extension, large portion of the highway will have to be covered by primary winding of the CPT system. It is therefore recommended that economic and practical feasibility of such on-road charge replenishment systems have to be studied further in detail. A cost estimate of such CPT systems for stationary EV charging application is also presented.
