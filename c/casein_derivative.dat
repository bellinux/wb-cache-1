40|$|This {{contribution}} {{presents an}} inexpensive, simple and fast procedure to purify trypsin from fish viscera based on affinity binding onto magnetic particles of azocasein composite (MAzo). This <b>casein</b> <b>derivative,</b> nonspecific protease substrate, was magnetized by co-precipitation of Fe+ 2 and Fe+ 3 ions. Intestines of fish Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) were homogenized in 0. 01 M Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8. 0 (one gram of tissue/ml). Afterwards, the homogenate was partially purified with ammonium sulfate (20 - 40 % of saturation), dialyzed and then incubated with MAzo. The adsorbed proteins were firstly extensively washed with 0. 01 M Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8. 0, and subsequently with 3 M NaCl by collecting the magnetic azocasein composite under a magnetic field. The fractions collected by these washings {{were used for}} protein and enzyme activity determinations as well as electrophoresis. The specific activity of the protein collected with 3 M NaCl (41. 82 unit/mg) showed to be 220 times higher than that found for the crude extract (0. 19 unit/mg). The SDS-PAGE showed {{that the size of}} the purified protein was approximately 24 kDa, agreeing with the previously reported for the Nile tilapia trypsin molecular weight. This procedure presents the advantages of magnetic azocasein compostite reuse and can be applied for trypsin purification from other sources...|$|E
40|$|The goal {{of modern}} {{dentistry}} is to manage non-cavitated carious lesions non-invasively through remineralization {{in an attempt}} to prevent disease progression, and to improve strength, esthetics, and function of teeth. The emphasis currently is being given to new technologies for enamel remineralization which suggest the changes in the understanding of dental caries. The aim {{of this paper is to}} review the contemporary non-fluoridated systems available for remineralization therapy and ideas for their implementation into clinical practice. A search of articles from "Pubmed" and "Medline" with the keywords Remineralization-demineralization, <b>Casein</b> <b>derivatives,</b> Non-fluoridated remineralizing agents was conducted. A total of 526 abstracts were collected, out of which 172 articles that discussed current technologies of non-fluoridated remineralizing agents were read and 33 most relevant articles were included in this paper. Casein phosphopeptide based technology has been established as a strong non-fluoridated remineralizing agent fulfilling all the criteria of an ideal remineralizing material...|$|R
40|$|Clinical {{trials are}} reviewed, {{involving}} proteins and peptides derived from milk (predominantly bovine), {{with the exception}} of lactoferrin, which will be the subject of another article. The most explored milk fraction is α-lactalbumin (LA), which is often applied with glycomacropeptide (GMP) – a casein degradation product. These milk constituents are used in health-promoting infant and adult formulae as well as in a modified form (HAMLET) to treat cancer. Lactoperoxidase (LCP) is used as an additive to mouth hygiene products and as a salivary substitute. <b>Casein</b> <b>derivatives</b> are applied, in addition, in the dry mouth syndrome. On the other hand, casein hydrolysates, containing active tripeptides, found application in hypertension and in type 2 diabetes. Lysozyme is routinely used for food conservation and in pharmaceutical products. It was successfully used in premature infants with concomitant diseases to improve health parameters. When used as prophylaxis in patients with scheduled surgery, it significantly reduced the incidence of hepatitis resulting from blood transfusion. Lysozyme was also used in infected children as an antimicrobial agent showing synergistic effects in combination with different antibiotics. Proline-rich polypeptide (PRP) was introduced to therapy of Alzheimer’s disease patients. The therapeutic value of PRP was proved in several clinical trials and supported by studies on its mechanism of action. Concentrated immunoglobulin preparations from colostrum and milk of hyperimmunized cows showed efficacy in prevention of infections by bacteria, viruses and protozoa. A nutrition formula with milk-derived TGF-β 2 (Modulen IBD®) found application in treatment of pediatric Crohn’s disease. In conclusion, the preparations containing milk-derived products are safe and effective measures in prevention and treatment of infections as well as autoimmune and neoplastic diseases...|$|R
40|$|Background: Dry mouth (xerostomia) is {{a common}} symptom which is {{connected}} with hypofunction of salivary glands induced by transient physiological conditions, pathology or as {{a side effect of}} drugs or radiation. Xerostomia almost always develops after destruction of salivary glands in connection with the treatment of head and neck cancer with ionizing radiation. Certain autoimmune diseases such as Sjogren's syndrome can also give dry mouth symptoms. The use of anticholinergic drugs and certain antihistamines may also cause a decrease in salivation. Aging is another factor that can induce salivary gland hypofunction due to physiological changes and/or use of medications. The treatment goals for patients with dry mouth is to relieve symptoms, prevent or ameliorate the consequences of salivary dysfunction, and treating the underlying disease. Treatments to improve function include saliva stimulation and saliva substitutes with fluoride. The systemic drugs bromhexine and pilocarpine are tested as saliva stimulants. Pilocarpine (Salagen) is a non-selective muscarinic agonist that increases the secretion of saliva. The purpose of this thesis was to investigate the effect of drug treatments to reduce dry mouth and prevent tooth decay, with the help of scientific articles. Results showed that in patients with some remaining unstimulated salivary flow rate daily treatments with a fluoride concentration of 0. 42 % F was enough to prevent tooth decay to a large extent. Use of 1. 23 % F-gel was not better than the 0. 42 % gel treatment. <b>Casein</b> <b>derivatives</b> complexed with calcium phosphate could be an alternative to fluoride treatment. Salivary secretion increased significantly after mouth rinse with 1 % or 2 % pilocarpine with a plateau between 45 and 75 minutes. 2 % pilocarpine solution also increased the sense of salivary flow. Dry mouth was improved in 12. 1; 63. 6; 69. 7 % of the patients who received Salagen tablets (5 mg pilocarpine hydrochloride), 3 mg or 5 mg pilocarpine lozenge, respectively, compared with 42. 4 % of patients receiving placebo lozenge. Mouth wash with pilocarpine 0. 1 % increased secretion from minor salivary glands and whole unstimulated saliva secretion compared to 0. 9 % saline mouthwash. The effectiveness in relieving subjective dry mouth was not significantly different between the solutions. Conclusions: Patients with unstimulated salivary flow 0. 1 ml / min. Patients with stimulated salivary flow 0. 5 ml / min. Mouthwash with pilocarpine solutions at concentrations of 1 - 2 % pilocarpine induce a significant objective and subjective dose dependent increase in salivary flow. Pilocarpine lozenge produced the better clinical responses and a faster subjective improvement of dry mouth than Salagen tablets...|$|R
40|$|The {{protective}} effects {{of milk and}} milk products against dental caries have been demonstrated in many animal studies. We have shown that this effect was mediated by micellar <b>casein</b> or caseinopeptide <b>derivatives.</b> A reduction in the Streptococcus sobrinus population in the oral microbiota of animals fed diets supplemented with these milk components was consistently observed. A possible explanation for these findings is that milk components are incorporated into the salivary pellicle, thereby reducing the adherence of S. sobrinus. This hypothesis was tested in vitro by the incubation of bovine enamel discs with unstimulated saliva. The resulting pellicle was washed and incubated with caseinoglycomacropeptide (CGMP) and/or caseinophosphopeptide (CPP) labeled with 17 - and 12 -nm gold particles. All samples were prepared for electron microscopy by high-pressure freezing followed by freeze-substitution. It was demonstrated by high-resolution scanning electron microscopy with back-scattered electron imaging, {{as well as by}} transmission electron microscopy, that both peptides were incorporated into the pellicle in exchange for albumin, confirming previous findings. This protein was identified with a mouse anti-human serum albumin followed by goat anti-mouse IgG labeled with 25 -nm gold particles. Incorporation of CGMP and/or CPP into salivary pellicles reduced the adherence of both S. sobrinus and S. mutans significantly. It is suggested that the calcium and phosphate-rich micellar casein or caseinopeptides are incorporated into the pellicle. The resulting ecological shifts, together with the increased remineralization potential of this biofilm, may explain its modified cariogenic potential...|$|R
40|$|Tolypocladium cylindrosporum is an entomopathogenic fungi {{that has}} been studied as a {{biological}} control agent against insects of several orders. The fungus has been isolated from the soil {{as well as from}} insects of the orders Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, Diptera and Hymenoptera. In this study, we analyzed the ability of a strain of T. cylindrosporum, isolated from soil samples taken in Tierra del Fuego, Argentina, to produce hydrolytic enzymes, and to study the relationship of those activities to the fungus pathogenicity against pest aphids. We have made the traditional and molecular characterization of this strain of T. cylindrosporum. The expression of hydrolase activity in the fungal strain was estimated at three incubation temperatures (4 ºC, 12 ºC and 24 ºC), on different agar media supplemented with the following specific substrates: chitin azure, Tween ® 20, casein, and urea for chitinase, lipase, protease, and urease activity, respectively. The hydrolytic-enzyme activity was estimated qualitatively according to the presence of a halo of clarification through hydrolase action, besides was expressed semi-quantitatively as the ratio between the hydrolytic-halo and colony diameters. The pathogenicity of the fungus was tested on adults of the aphid Rhopalosiphum padi at three temperatures of incubation (4 ºC, 12 ºC and 24 ºC). The suspension was adjusted to a concentration of 1 x 10 7 conidia/ml. In pathogenicity assays at seven days post-inoculation, the fungus caused the mortality of adults of Ropalosiphum padi at different temperatures also showed a broad ability to grow on several agar-culture media, supplemented with different carbon sources at the three incubation temperatures tested. Although, the growth was greater with higher incubation temperatures (with maximum levels at 24 °C), the fungus reached similar colony diameters after 15 days of incubation on the medium supplemented with Tween® 20 at the lower two incubation temperatures of 4 °C or 12 °C. In accordance with the results on colony diameters, the fungus revealed an ability to degrade <b>casein,</b> chitin <b>derivatives,</b> Tween® 20, and urea as evidenced by the appearance of a halo around the fungal colony. Because of its origin and temperature tolerance, this Argentine strain has great potential for use as a biocontrol agent for insect pest control in cold and temperate environments. Rev. Biol. Trop. 60 (2) : 833 - 841. Epub 2012 June 01. El hongo entomopatógeno Tolypocladium cylindrosporum ha sido estudiado como un agente de control biológico contra insectos de varios órdenes. Esta especie fue aislada del suelo, así como de insectos de los órdenes Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, Diptera e Hymenoptera. En el presente trabajo hemos analizado la capacidad de una cepa de T. cylindrosporum (LPSC Nº 1065) aislada del suelo en Tierra del Fuego, Argentina, para producir enzimas hidrolíticas y determinar la relación de esta actividad con la patogenicidad del hongo para combatir la plaga de los áfidos en diferentes temperaturas (4 º, 12 º y 24 ºC). En los ensayos de patogenicidad, siete días posteriores a la inoculación, se registró mortalidad en los adultos del áfido Ropalosiphum padi a diferentes temperaturas y también se demostró una amplia capacidad de crecer en varios medios de cultivos complementados con diferentes fuentes de carbono bajo las tres temperaturas de incubación ensayadas. Debido a su origen y a la tolerancia que tiene a bajas temperaturas esta cepa, presenta un gran potencial para su uso como agente de control biológico para las plagas de insectos de ambientes fríos y templados...|$|R
40|$|The {{manufacture}} of casein/caseinates containing whey protein is immediately attractive {{due to its}} potential to enhance product yield. However, some technologies capable of producing these products are ineligible for manufacturing subsidy because of restrictions pertaining to relevant EU regulations. Other emerging technologies require refinement and process design before implementation at industrial level. Furthermore, the implications of incorporating virtually the entire complement of whey protein in what is essentially a caseinate ingredient needs to be investigated carefully {{in terms of the}} versatility of use {{in a wide range of}} food formulations. The development is significant in the context of U. S. market changes - traditionally, an important outlet for Irish casein exports amounting to 20, 000 - 27, 000 t per annum. Ireland accounts for ~ 30 % of EU casein/caseinate production with the greater proportion in Rennet form (27, 000 t) and the remainder (18, 000 t) as Acid casein. In recent years, a new market for a related casein ingredient - milk protein concentrate (MPC) opened up in the US, and accounted for total imports of 40, 000 t in 1998, 10, 000 t of which were exported from Ireland. However, this market is more restricted due to regulatory changes introduced in response to the perceived threat of MPC imports to the US dairy industry. Since <b>casein,</b> or its <b>derivative</b> products such as milk proteinate (EU Annex III compliant), are not perceived to be in competition with local milk supplies and dairy ingredients, it is now hoped that Irish casein manufacturers may be able to reclaim recently lost markets through the introduction of an innovative proteinate ingredient which is expected to command a premium in nutrition applications e. g. in sports, infant formula and nutraceutical products. With a choice of emerging new technologies for the production of novel casein-related ingredients, the dairy industry has an opportunity to decide on what is appropriate for the defence of its market share and at the same time benefit from simultaneous compliance with relevant regulatory supports (EU) and market access rules (USA). Hence the main aims of this project were: * To investigate new technologies for the isolation of casein and casein/whey protein combinations in the course of developing new milk protein ingredients, and * To compare the performance in selected food formulations of novel milk protein ingredients namely milk proteinates, milk protein concentrates, native phosphocasein and classical Annex III casein products.

40|$|Since the {{catabolism}} of {{amino acids}} in cheese {{results in the}} formation of most volatile flavor compounds, a proper intracellular pool of amino acids must be established in order to produce a desirable flavor production in cheese. Generation of this pool of amino acids requires complex interactions among <b>casein</b> and its <b>derivatives,</b> proteolytic enzymes, and transport systems in the associated bacteria, including lactococci. In this project, we hypothesized that casein hydrolysis by the extracellular proteinases of Brevibacterium linens BL 2 modulates the expression profile of proteolytic related genes in Lactococcus lactis spp. lactis IL 1403. In order to monitor the global gene regulation patterns in L. lactis ssp. lactis IL 1403, a high-throughput gene expression tool was needed to study the gene expression profiles on a genomic scale. In this project, we developed a novel oligonucleotide-based filter DNA array protocol for this purpose. The success of this oligonucleotide-based DNA array was dependent on technical innovations including polyI tailing, indirect high density biotin labeling, careful probe design, and integrated computational data analysis. The utility and validity of this protocol were demonstrated by profiling the expression of 375 metabolically related genes in L. lactis ssp. lactis IL 1403 during heat, acid, and osmotic stresses. Subsequently the DNA macroarray was used to profile the gene expression changes of L. lactis spp. lactis IL 1403 growing in a peptide-limited medium, in a casitone-based peptide-rich medium, and in a casein hydrolyte by B. linens BL 2 proteolytic enzymes. L. lactis ssp. lactis IL 1403 experienced nitrogen starvation even with an abundance of peptide resources because of lack of expression of peptide transporter genes. Conversely, a peptide pool generated by B. linens BL 2 proteolytic activities was sufficient to sustain the growth of L. lactis ssp. lactis IL 1403. The repression of the peptide transporter and other peptidase genes of L. lactis ssp. lactis IL 1403 was relieved in this medium. Interestingly, the Opt system, a di-tripeptide transporter, was used as a primary peptide transporter, instead of the Opp system whose genes were not actively transcripted in IL 1403. We also conducted additional experiments to further describe the protease in B. linens BL 2 responsible for the peptide pool generation. This enzyme was secreted as a non-active zymogen and matured into the active protease. Both proteolysis and maturation processes were regulated. Collectively, this work demonstrated that a unique protease of B. linens BL 2 generated a pool of pep tides transportable by L. lactis IL 1403 and induced changes in gene expression in L. lactis IL 1403. Consequently, this body of work demonstrated the hypothesis to be true...|$|R
