5|$|The 2nd Division {{moved to}} France in March 1916. Berryman became a {{temporary}} captain on 1 April 1916, a rank which became substantive on 10 June 1916. In January 1917, he was posted to the 7th Infantry Brigade as a trainee staff captain. During the Second Battle of Bullecourt he served with 2nd Division headquarters. He {{was appointed to}} command the 18th Field Artillery Battery, and became a temporary major on 1 September 1917, which became substantive on 10 September 1917. This {{was as far as}} he <b>could</b> <b>go,</b> <b>for</b> Duntroon graduates could not be promoted above major in the AIF. This policy was aimed at giving them a broad range of experience, which would benefit the Army, while not allowing them to outnumber the available post-war positions.|$|E
25|$|Children's {{societies}} {{were one}} of the features of kibbutz life that most interested outsiders. In the heyday of children's societies, parents would only spend two hours a day, typically in the afternoon, with their children. In Kibbutz Artzi parents were explicitly forbidden to put their children to bed at night. As children got older, parents <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> days on end without seeing their offspring, other than through chance encounters somewhere in the grounds.|$|E
25|$|Abbas gained {{strong support}} from the common people. Sources report him {{spending}} {{much of his time}} among them, personally visiting bazaars and other public places in Isfahan. Short in stature but physically strong until his health declined in his final years, Abbas <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> long periods without needing to sleep or eat and could ride great distances. At the age of 19 Abbas shaved off his beard, keeping only his moustache, thus setting a fashion in Iran.|$|E

25|$|Ivy City began a {{significant}} decline in 1953. American railroads, which until this time had used coal-fueled locomotives, began switching to diesel fuel or using overhead electrical wires for powering engines. By {{the end of}} the year, almost no coal-fed locomotives were using the Ivy City rail yard. Although coal-fueled engines required frequent refueling, a diesel train <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> as many as three days without needing more diesel fuel. Steam-powered locomotives required almost daily tune-up and repair, but diesel-fueled engines rarely did. Significant layoffs at the Ivy City Yard occurred, deeply affecting Ivy City itself were many of these workers lived. The eastern roundhouse and a number of tracks were demolished in early 1954, and by 1956 the coal wharf and ash pits were also gone. As the railroad laid off workers, Ivy City also declined as a neighborhood.|$|E
25|$|The {{overall effect}} of Reichart's {{literary}} techniques indicate Hilde's estrangement of painful memories, her obsession with guilt and self-loathing, {{her inability to}} resolve anxiety, and the inadequacy of words to capture her feelings. With these devices, Reichart allows the reader to see inside the mind of an extremely disturbed woman. For Reichart, Hilde and her siblings embody the war-time generation: Walter, who helped to hack to death the prisoners in the barn; Monika, who was too delicate and fragile to act; Hannes, who refused to kill the prisoner and tried to save him; and Hilde, who was confused {{and did not know}} to whom she <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> help. The father, a violent and bitter man, made his family suffer and was indeed complicit in their suffering; the mother, worked hard but said nothing; the distant sister, Christine, was removed from the chaos. The home was no sanctuary, not for the escaped prisoner, nor for Hilde; Pesendorf betrayed the brother—indeed, the family—and killed the prisoner. The home was as dangerous and bloody as the barn.|$|E
500|$|Rowe's {{illness and}} Blanchflower's arrival {{together}} signalled {{the end of}} Ramsey's playing career. Ramsey missed matches during the 1954–55 season through injury, and in April 1955 suffered what he called [...] "a terrible roasting" [...] {{at the hands of}} the Leicester City winger Derek Hogg. After Tottenham ended the season in 16th place, Rowe retired permanently; his deputy Jimmy Anderson took over and appointed Nicholson to his coaching staff. When Ramsey was omitted from a post-season tour of Hungary, despite still being club captain, he realised that his time at Tottenham had come to an end. He had played a total of 250 competitive games for Tottenham in all competitions, across six seasons. [...] "I was 35 years old and obviously concerned about my future," [...] he later wrote. [...] "I really didn't know what was going to happen to me. I knew my days as a player were numbered, and there was only one way things <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> me in this respect—downhill." ...|$|E

500|$|The 10th Light Horse was reorganised after {{returning}} to Egypt in January 1916, and Robertson assumed command of B Squadron, with the AIF rank of major from May 1916. This {{was as far as}} he <b>could</b> <b>go,</b> <b>for</b> Duntroon graduates could not be promoted above major in the AIF. This was the result of an AIF policy aimed at giving them a broad a range of experience, which would benefit the post-war Army, while not allowing an accumulation of young officers of high rank, for whom the reduced post-War Army would not have sufficient posts. His substantive rank remained that of lieutenant; he would not be promoted to the substantive rank of captain in the PMF until 30 September 1920, and promotion to major would not come until 1 July 1932. At the Battle of Magdhaba, his colonel was wounded and Robertson took over command of the 10th Light Horse. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) for his actions during this battle. His citation read: ...|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} year, Keeping Up {{with the}} Kardashians {{was picked up}} for a third season. In April 2012, E! signed a three-year deal with the Kardashian family that kept the series airing through seasons seven, eight and nine. Keeping up with the Kardashians was later renewed for a tenth season which premiered on March 15, 2015. In February 2015, {{it was announced that}} the show had been renewed for four more years, along with an additional spin-off series, {{making it one of the}} longest-running reality television series in the country. In terms of the show's future, Kim Kardashian has commented that the reality series <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> an indefinite number of seasons saying that she: [...] "hope it goes on for as long as it can." [...] Keeping Up With the Kardashians, including its spin-off series, has become the cable network's flagship show and its most lucrative franchise. [...] "It has changed the face of E!" [...] said Lisa Berger, the network's executive producer. [...] "We were a place to report on celebrity; we weren't a place to break and make celebrity, which is now the whole idea of the E! brand." [...] The show's success contributed significantly towards building the [...] "Kardashian brand", or [...] "Kardashian Inc." [...] as it is called by The Hollywood Reporter. [...] "These shows are a 30-minute commercial," [...] Khloé Kardashian admitted in 2011, in response to a suggestion that the television series is used to promote their retail stores and endorsement deals.|$|E

2500|$|With {{emancipation}} came great social changes. At {{a stroke}} thousands of slave children also became free, for whom {{there was no}} education provided. Knibb did what he could, but was hampered {{by a lack of}} teachers. Upon emancipation, the adult slaves were released into a world without any education or institutions to support them. The church ministers were often the only people to whom the freed slaves <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> legal advice. Knibb remarked that [...] "Often I have had persons come to me for advice who have walked twenty miles to ask for it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ladd's {{performance}} in The Mikado {{was seen by}} a talent scout.

The contract had options which <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> seven years, but they were all in the studio's favor. Ladd appeared unbilled in a film, Once in a Lifetime (1932), but the studio eventually decided Ladd was too blond and too short and dropped him after six months. (All of Ladd's fellow [...] "discoveries" [...] would be dropped, including a young Tyrone Power.) ...|$|E
