MethodsWe investigated patients of 11 randomly selected general practices and 8 hospital units. Each patient meeting the international AGI case definition criteria was interviewed on <b>costs</b> <b>incurred</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the use of health care resources. Follow-up interview with consenting patients was conducted 2 to 4 weeks after the general practitioner (GP) visit or discharge from hospital, collecting information on self-medication costs and indirect costs. Costs were recalculated to US dollars by using the purchasing power parity exchange rate for Poland. ResultsWeighting the inpatient costs by age-specific probability of hospital referral by GPs, the societal cost of a medically attended AGI case {{was estimated to be}} US $ 168. The main cost drivers of direct medical costs were cost of hospital bed days (US $ 28), cost of outpatient pharmacotherapy (US $ 20), and cost of GP consultation (US $ 10). Patients covered only the cost of outpatient pharmacotherapy. Considering the AGI population GP consultation rate, the age-adjusted societal cost of medically attended AGI episodes was estimated at US $ 2222 million, of which 53 % was attributable to indirect costs. ConclusionsEven though AGIs generate a low cost for individuals, they place a high burden on the society, attributed mostly to indirect costs. Higher resources could be allocated to the prevention and control of AGIs...|$|E

40|$|The Polish {{society is}} {{unprepared}} to integrate {{people with disabilities}} into the labor market. This is due to inadequate state promotion of existing legislation in this area, which accounts {{for the lack of}} preparation of entrepreneurs {{in the context of the}} problems of people with disabilities and their knowledge of the hiring. Often unpreparedness leads to violations of basic human and worker rights. Previous attempts to include people with disabilities have been considered as insufficient. In order to prevent the marginalization of people with disabilities in the labor market it is necessary to make further attempts to integrate them into the labor market, despite the many difficulties involved.

5000|$|This {{is because}} {{in the war of}} {{attrition}} any strategy that is unwavering and predictable is unstable, because it will ultimately be displaced by a mutant strategy which relies on the fact that it can best the existing predictable strategy by investing an extra small delta of waiting resource to ensure that it wins. Therefore, only a random unpredictable strategy can maintain itself in a population of Bluffers. The contestants in effect choose an acceptable <b>cost</b> <b>to</b> be <b>incurred</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the value of the resource being sought, effectively making a random bid as part of a mixed strategy (a strategy where a contestant has several, or even many, possible actions in his strategy). This implements a distribution of bids for a resource of specific value V, where the bid for any specific contest is chosen at random from that distribution.

40|$|Many industries, such as shipbuilding, {{concerned}} with the fabrication of fusion-welded plate structures, face increasing challenges to produce lightweight structures. This design requirement is commonly met by using thin-plate, multiply stiffened, welded structures, but severe difficulties and high rectification <b>costs</b> are frequently <b>incurred,</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the evolution of out-of-plane deformations. The overall scope {{of this study is}} to improve the applicability of computational prediction of distortion by providing simple and adaptable methodologies, which can be readily validated through experience of application in the industrial context. These methods are designed to be computationally economic and robust, and they are also generic with respect to material properties, welding processes, and thickness. The aim is to provide design engineers with the tools to explore alternative structural and process parameters and hence to find out if the outcomes will be acceptable, prior to embarking on manufacturing operations typical of large-scale welded structures. The validity of the simulations was investigated via full-scale tests where several fillet-welded 100 mm × 6 mm stiffeners were attached to 4 m × 1. 5 m × 5 mm thick plates, according to different sequences. The computational models were used to optimize the welding scheme with respect to minimum out-of-plane deformation and welding sequence...|$|R
40|$|In {{the recent}} {{last few decades}} the {{changing}} of needs and demands of public administration has been leading to a progressive abandonment and an underutilization of the public real estate. At the same time, local authorities have to manage additional assets because of the divestment process <b>related</b> <b>to</b> {{the implementation of the}} “Federalismo Demaniale” law. The needs <b>to</b> <b>incur</b> <b>costs</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the maintenance and the management of abandoned buildings, as well as to provide new ways to use them, represent some critical issues for the local public administrations. However, many of these public assets could be used as strategic items in the enhancement process of the cities (Manzo, 2005). Indeed, these assets provide significant opportunities for city enhancement thanks to their strategic geographical locations and their architectural and cultural characteristics. The abandonment condition, caused by the long lead times needed for the activation and the development of the enhancement processes, increases the degree of decay of this public real estate and its maintenance costs. Concurrently, it decreases the possibility to make cost-effective maintenance interventions and in general it reduces the possibility to plan, in terms of the enhancement, the re-use of the buildings. The enhancement process has to start off by a knowledge phase of the disused assets. The Preventive and Planned Conservation logic becomes the suitable tool to conduct an analysis of the buildings from different points of view (such as historical, architectural and state of decay) and it prepares the ground for the maintenance interventions planning. The use of this instrument would allow the local authorities to plan economic and technical management of their abandoned assets and {{to lay the groundwork for}} starting an enhancement process...|$|R
40|$|IntroductionEmployers may <b>incur</b> <b>costs</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> {{absenteeism}} among {{employees who}} have chronic diseases or unhealthy behaviors. We examined the association between employee absenteeism and 5 conditions: 3 risk factors (smoking, physical inactivity, and obesity) and 2 chronic diseases (hypertension and diabetes). MethodsWe identified 5 chronic diseases or risk factors from 2 data sources: MarketScan Health Risk Assessment and the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS). Absenteeism was measured {{as the number of}} workdays missed because of sickness or injury. We used zero-inflated Poisson regression to estimate excess absenteeism as the difference in the number of days missed from work by those who reported having a risk factor or chronic disease and those who did not. Covariates included demographics (eg, age, education, sex) and employment variables (eg, industry, union membership). We quantified absenteeism costs in 2011 and adjusted them to reflect growth in employment costs to 2015 dollars. Finally, we estimated absenteeism costs for a hypothetical small employer (100 employees) and a hypothetical large employer (1, 000 employees). ResultsAbsenteeism estimates ranged from 1 to 2 days per individual per year depending on the risk factor or chronic disease. Except for the physical inactivity and obesity estimates, disease- and risk-factor 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 cspecific estimates were similar in MEPS and MarketScan. Absenteeism increased with the number of risk factors or diseases reported. Nationally, each risk factor or disease was associated with annual absenteeism costs greater than 2 billion. Absenteeism costs ranged from 16 to 81 (small employer) and 17 to 286 (large employer) per employee per year. ConclusionAbsenteeism costs associated with chronic diseases and health risk factors can be substantial. Employers may <b>incur</b> these <b>costs</b> through lower productivity, and employees could <b>incur</b> <b>costs</b> through lower wages. 27710764 PMC 505540...|$|R

Total opportunity costs were equal to 25. 5 – 27. 2 million PLN during these 10 years or 1502 – 1605 PLN/ha of nature reserve annually. Annual opportunity costs calculated per unit of forest area were equal to 56 – 60 PLN/ha. The estimated loss in work places was 98. 8 working days annually per 1000 ha of forest area in forest districts. Total expenses <b>incurred</b> by municipalities <b>related</b> <b>to</b> establishment of forest tax concessions in nature reserves reached about 18. 1 thousand PLN in 2011. The research results show that the economic and social costs of nature protection activities are concentrated in their places of their origin. Those costs are felt the most by the owners of the affected forests and local communities. We recommend that possibilities are explored for the introduction of instruments to allow the mitigation of negative effects resulting from restrictions in forest use. Restructuring of forest and nature protection policy, {{to take into account the}} interests of all stakeholders would provide an improved model for the use of these forests...|$|R

40|$|Efforts {{to control}} bank risk address the wrong {{problem in the}} wrong way. They presume that the {{financial}} crisis was caused by CEOs who failed to supervise risk-taking employees. The responses focus on executive pay, believing that executives will bring non-executives into line - using incentives to manage risk-taking - once their own pay is regulated. What they overlook is the effect on non-executive pay of the competition for talent. Even if executive pay is regulated, and executives act in the bank's best interests, they will still be trapped into providing incentives that encourage risk-taking by non-executives due to the negative externality that arises from that competition. Greater risk-taking can increase short-term profits and, in turn, the amount a non-executive receives, potentially {{at the expense of}} long-term bank value. Non-executives, therefore, have an incentive to incur significant risk upfront so long as they can depart for a new employer before any losses materialize. The result is an upward spiral in compensation - reducing an executive's ability to set non-executive pay and the ability of any one bank to adjust compensation to reflect risk-taking and long-term outcomes. New regulation must address the tension between compensation and competition. Regulators should take account of the effect of competition on market-wide levels of pay, including by non-banks who compete for talent. The ability of non-executives to jump from a bank employer to another financial firm should also be limited. In addition, banks should be required to include a long-term equity component in non-executive pay, with subsequent employers being restricted from compensating a new employee for any losses she <b>incurs</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> her prior work...|$|R

The analysis suggests that multiple stakeholders will <b>incur</b> the <b>costs</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> implementation of CPOE with CDS in the LTC setting, but the <b>costs</b> <b>incurred</b> by each may not be aligned with the benefits, which may present a major barrier to broad adoption.
