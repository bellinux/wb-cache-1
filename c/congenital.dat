5|$|In children, {{additional}} causes include measles, echinococcosis, inhalation of {{a foreign}} body, and certain <b>congenital</b> malformations (<b>congenital</b> cystic adenomatoid malformation and <b>congenital</b> lobar emphysema).|$|E
5|$|Cervical {{agenesis}} {{is a rare}} <b>congenital</b> {{condition in}} which the cervix completely fails to develop, often associated with the concurrent failure of the vagina to develop. Other <b>congenital</b> cervical abnormalities exist, often associated with abnormalities of the vagina and uterus. The cervix may be duplicated in situations such as bicornuate uterus and uterine didelphys.|$|E
5|$|<b>Congenital</b> {{disorders}} include cystic fibrosis, pulmonary hypoplasia (an incomplete {{development of}} the lungs)congenital diaphragmatic hernia, and infant respiratory distress syndrome caused by a deficiency in lung surfactant. An azygos lobe is a <b>congenital</b> anatomical variation which though usually without effect can cause problems in thoracoscopic procedures.|$|E
5|$|Infants with {{thyroid hormone}} {{deficiency}} (<b>congenital</b> hypothyroidism) can manifest problems of physical {{growth and development}} as well as brain development, termed cretinism. Children with <b>congenital</b> hypothyroidism are treated supplementally with levothyroxine, which facilitates normal growth and development.|$|E
5|$|Leg-length {{difference}} – Significant bone shortening {{occurs in}} one leg due to <b>congenital</b> deficiency or trauma.|$|E
5|$|Some brain {{disorders}} such as Tay–Sachs {{disease are}} <b>congenital,</b> and linked to genetic and chromosomal mutations. A rare group of <b>congenital</b> cephalic disorders known as lissencephaly is characterised by the lack of, or inadequacy of, cortical folding. Normal development of the brain can be affected during pregnancy by nutritional deficiencies, teratogens, infectious diseases, and {{by the use of}} recreational drugs and alcohol.|$|E
5|$|Aberrations in {{prenatal}} {{development can}} result in various forms of thyroid dysgenesis which can cause <b>congenital</b> hypothyroidism, and if untreated {{this can lead to}} cretinism.|$|E
5|$|Clinical and {{diagnostic}} {{features of}} pulmonary valve endocarditis {{in the setting}} of <b>congenital</b> cardiac malformations, published in the International Journal of Cardiology.|$|E
5|$|<b>Congenital</b> adrenal {{hyperplasia}} is a <b>congenital</b> {{disease in}} which mutations of enzymes that produce steroid hormones {{result in a}} glucocorticoid deficiency and malfunction of the negative feedback loop of the HPA axis. In the HPA axis, cortisol (a glucocorticoid) inhibits the release of CRH and ACTH, hormones that in turn stimulate corticosteroid synthesis. As cortisol cannot be synthesized, these hormones are released in high quantities and stimulate production of other adrenal steroids instead. The {{most common form of}} <b>congenital</b> adrenal hyperplasia is due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency. 21-hydroxylase is necessary for production of both mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids, but not androgens. Therefore, ACTH stimulation of the adrenal cortex induces the release of excessive amounts of adrenal androgens, which can lead to the development of ambiguous genitalia and secondary sex characteristics.|$|E
5|$|<b>Congenital</b> endothelial {{dystrophy}} type 2, a rare form of corneal dystrophy, {{is linked}} to mutations in SLC4A11 gene that encodes a transporter reportedly regulating the intracellular concentration of boron.|$|E
5|$|<b>Congenital</b> {{malformation}} or underdevelopment (hypoplasia) of the cerebellar vermis is {{a characteristic}} of both Dandy–Walker syndrome and Joubert syndrome. In very rare cases, the entire cerebellum may be absent. The inherited neurological disorders Machado–Joseph disease, ataxia telangiectasia, and Friedreich's ataxia cause progressive neurodegeneration linked to cerebellar loss. <b>Congenital</b> brain malformations outside the cerebellum can, in turn, cause herniation of cerebellar tissue, as seen in some forms of Arnold–Chiari malformation.|$|E
5|$|Cutaneous <b>congenital</b> {{anomalies}} are {{a diverse}} group of disorders that result from faulty morphogenesis, the biological process that forms the shape of a human body.|$|E
5|$|Immunodeficiencies {{can also}} be {{inherited}} or 'acquired'. Chronic granulomatous disease, where phagocytes have a reduced ability to destroy pathogens, {{is an example of}} an inherited, or <b>congenital,</b> immunodeficiency. AIDS and some types of cancer cause acquired immunodeficiency.|$|E
5|$|Important {{sexual health}} issues for women include Sexually {{transmitted}} infections (STIs) and {{female genital cutting}} (FGC). STIs are a global health priority because they have serious consequences for women and infants. Mother-to-child transmission of STIs can lead to stillbirths, neonatal death, low-birth-weight and prematurity, sepsis, pneumonia, neonatal conjunctivitis, and <b>congenital</b> deformities. Syphilis in pregnancy results in over 300,000 fetal and neonatal deaths per year, and 215,000 infants with {{an increased risk of}} death from prematurity, low-birth-weight or <b>congenital</b> disease.|$|E
5|$|Loss of limb or limb {{deficiency}} – A total {{or partial}} absence of bones or joints from partial or total loss due to illness, trauma, or <b>congenital</b> limb deficiency (e.g. dysmelia).|$|E
5|$|Pollock {{was born}} on 11 May 1977 in Liverpool, England with spina bifida, a {{developmental}} <b>congenital</b> disorder caused by the incomplete closing of the embryonic neural tube. He currently lives in Wigan, Greater Manchester in north west England.|$|E
5|$|Several <b>congenital</b> {{conditions}} {{may increase the}} risk of leukemia; the most common is probably Down syndrome, which is associated with a 10- to 18-fold increase in the risk of AML.|$|E
5|$|The heart can be {{affected}} by <b>congenital</b> diseases. These include failure of the developmental foramen ovale to close, present in up to 25% of people; ventricular or atrial septal defects, <b>congenital</b> diseases of the heart valves (e.g. <b>congenital</b> aortic stenosis) or disease relating to blood vessels or blood flow from the heart (such as a patent ductus arteriosus or aortic coarctation).; These may cause symptoms {{at a variety of}} ages. If unoxygenated blood travels directly from the right to {{the left side of the}} heart, it may be noticed at birth, as it may cause a baby to become blue (cyanotic) such as Tetralogy of Fallot. A heart problem may impact a child's ability to grow. Some causes rectify with time and are regarded as benign. Other causes may be incidentally detected on a cardiac examination. These disorders are often diagnosed on an echocardiogram.|$|E
5|$|The yellow {{mutation}} in fruit flies is a mutation causing a <b>congenital</b> lack of normal pigment; it {{is a similar}} phenomenon to albinism in other organisms.|$|E
5|$|Accounts {{of their}} {{marriage}} diverge widely. Frances's <b>congenital</b> hip dislocation left her in constant pain, and often irritable. The couple's temperament and interests were opposites, France's enthusiasm for politics and intellectual company contrasting with her husband's lifelong passion for shooting and his later interest in the military.|$|E
5|$|Approximately {{one out of}} one {{thousand}} children suffer some type of <b>congenital</b> deafness related {{to the development of}} the inner ear. Inner ear <b>congenital</b> anomalies are related to sensorineural hearing loss and are generally diagnosed with a computed tomography (CT) scan or a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Hearing loss problems also derive from inner ear anomalies because its development is separate from that of the middle and external ear. Middle ear anomalies can occur because of errors during head and neck development. The first pharyngeal pouch syndrome associates middle ear anomalies to the malleus and incus structures as well as to the non-differentiation of the annular stapedial ligament. Temporal bone and ear canal anomalies are also related to this structure of the ear and are known to be associated with sensorineural hearing loss and conductive hearing loss.|$|E
5|$|As {{many as half}} of all Cavalier King Charles Spaniels {{may have}} a <b>congenital</b> blood {{disorder}} called idiopathic asymptomatic thrombocytopenia, an abnormally low number of platelets in the blood, according to recent studies in Denmark and the United States. Platelets, or thrombocytes, are disk-shaped blood elements which aid in blood clotting. Excessively low numbers {{are the most common}} cause of bleeding disorders in dogs. The platelets in the blood of many Cavalier King Charles Spaniels are a combination of those of normal size for dogs and others that are abnormally oversized, or macrothrombocytes. Macrothrombocytosis also is a <b>congenital</b> abnormality found in at least a third of CKCSs. These large platelets function normally, and the typical Cavalier does not appear to experience any health problems due to either the size or fewer numbers of its platelets.|$|E
5|$|Other {{species that}} are less {{commonly}} affected include cats and horses, {{as well as other}} large domestic animals. In cats, hypothyroidism is usually the result of other medical treatment such as surgery or radiation. In young horses, <b>congenital</b> hypothyroidism has been reported predominantly in Western Canada and has been linked with the mother's diet.|$|E
5|$|Pulmonary, or pulmonic {{stenosis}} is {{an often}} <b>congenital</b> narrowing of the pulmonary valve; {{it can be}} present in nasodigitoacoustic-affected infants. Treatment of this cardiac abnormality can require surgery, or non-surgical procedures like balloon valvuloplasty (widening the valve with a balloon catheter).|$|E
5|$|Study of diaries kept by Eric Marshall, {{medical officer}} to the 190709 expedition, {{suggests}} that Shackleton suffered from an atrial septal defect ("hole in the heart"), a <b>congenital</b> heart defect, {{which may have}} been a cause of his health problems.|$|E
25|$|<b>Congenital</b> asplenia is rare. There are two {{distinct}} types of genetic disorders: heterotaxy syndrome and isolated <b>congenital</b> asplenia.|$|E
25|$|<b>Congenital</b> {{forms of}} hypertrichosis are rare. Only 50 cases of <b>congenital</b> hypertrichosis lanuginosa have been {{recorded}} since the Middle Ages, and fewer than 100 cases of <b>congenital</b> generalized hypertrichosis have been documented in scientific publications and by the media. <b>Congenital</b> generalized hypertrichosis is isolated to one family in Mexico. Acquired hypertrichosis and hirsutism are more common. For example, hirsutism occurs in about 10% of women between ages 18 and 45.|$|E
25|$|<b>Congenital</b> deformities. The unique plastic {{properties}} of the bone, cartilage, and skin of patients' afflicted with <b>congenital</b> defects, and associated anomalies, are considered separately.|$|E
25|$|<b>Congenital</b> {{forms of}} hypertrichosis {{are caused by}} genetic mutations, and are {{extremely}} rare, unlike acquired forms. <b>Congenital</b> hypertrichosis is always present at birth.|$|E
25|$|In {{the absence}} of <b>congenital</b> heart defects, {{individuals}} with situs inversus are phenotypically normal, and can live normal healthy lives, without any complications related to their medical condition. There is a 5–10% prevalence of <b>congenital</b> heart disease in individuals with situs inversus totalis, most commonly transposition of the great vessels. The incidence of <b>congenital</b> heart disease is 95% in situs inversus with levocardia.|$|E
25|$|Much of the {{language}} used for describing <b>congenital</b> conditions predates genomic mapping, and structural conditions are often considered separately from other <b>congenital</b> conditions. It is now known that many metabolic conditions may have subtle structural expression, and structural conditions often have genetic links. Still, <b>congenital</b> conditions are often classified in a structural basis, organized when possible by primary organ system affected.|$|E
25|$|Michigan <b>Congenital</b> Heart Center: International {{referral}} center; {{widely regarded}} as best <b>congenital</b> heart center in the US; conducts 850 heart operations and 600 heart catheterizations per year.|$|E
25|$|Primary <b>congenital</b> alactasia, {{also called}} <b>congenital</b> lactase deficiency, is an {{extremely}} rare, autosomal recessive enzyme defect that prevents lactase expression from birth. People with <b>congenital</b> lactase deficiency cannot digest lactose from birth, so cannot digest breast milk. This genetic defect {{is characterized by a}} complete lack of lactase (alactasia). About 40 cases have been reported worldwide, mainly limited to Finland. Before the 20th century, babies born with <b>congenital</b> lactase deficiency often did not survive, but death rates decreased with soybean-derived infant formulas and manufactured lactose-free dairy products.|$|E
25|$|<b>Congenital</b> {{anomalies}} {{resulted in}} about 632,000 deaths {{per year in}} 2013 down from 751,000 in 1990. The type with the greatest death are <b>congenital</b> heart disease (323,000), followed by neural tube defects (69,000).|$|E
25|$|<b>Congenital</b> diaphragmatic hernia* is {{uncommon}} in dogs. Most diaphragmatic hernias {{are caused by}} trauma. <b>Congenital</b> diaphragmatic hernias are usually communications between the peritoneum and pericardium. They are often incidental findings.|$|E
25|$|Achromatopsia {{has also}} been called rod monochromacy and total <b>congenital</b> color blindness. Individuals with the <b>congenital</b> form of this {{condition}} show complete absence of cone cell activity via electroretinography at high light levels. There are at least four genetic causes of <b>congenital</b> ACHM, two of which involve cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels (ACHM2/ACHM3), a third involves the cone photoreceptor transducin (GNAT2, ACHM4), and the last remains unknown.|$|E
