In this paper, potential entrepreneurs can join in a peer group and voluntarily decide to collect and redistribute their endowments. If the fund is not enough to give everyone the amount of collateral that allows for a separation of types, this paper suggests that the government should intervene with a subsidy on the collateral. This policy produces a unique separating equilibrium and is the optimal intervention in the setup analyzed. mutual <b>credit,</b> <b>redistribution,</b> screening, policy intervention...|$|E

The main result is that the great emphasis put by Italian policy-makers in designing tax credits in the last 15 years has been mostly misplaced if the aim was that of supporting low-income households. On the other hand, child benefits - potentially a more effective tool - have not proven to be a growing source of redistribution in the same period. Overall, the Italian experience shows a rather uncertain path in helping families with children, with comparable results achieved by very complex and much simpler tax/benefit systems. child benefits, tax <b>credits,</b> <b>redistribution,</b> poverty, Italy,...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a theory of}} inequality and the social contract aiming to explain how countries with similar economic and political "fundamentals" can sustain such different systems of social insurance, fiscal redistribution, and education finance as those, of the United States and Western Europe. With imperfect credit and insurance markets some redistributive policies can improve ex ante welfare, and this implies that their political support tends to decrease with inequality. Conversely, with <b>credit</b> constraints, lower <b>redistribution</b> translates into more persistent inequality; hence the potential for multiple steady states, with mutually reinforcing high inequality and low redistribution, or vice versa. ...|$|R

Small, low-income farms form the majority of all farms, and they have access only to high-interest, non-institutional credits. Medium and large farms, on the other hand, have been the main recipients of subsidized government credits. The government funds are more scarce than before {{making it more difficult}} to improve the agricultural sector's performance by increasing the amount of government <b>credits.</b> However, <b>redistribution</b> of the <b>credits</b> between the farm groups may serve the purpose. This article investigates such an improved redistribution and its welfare implications. The results indicate that not only aggregate agricultural output, but also rural income distribution can be improved by increasing the availability of subsidized credit to small farmers. East Java supplies the bulk of the agricultural production in Indonesia. With the exception of sugarcane, crop production in East Java is not directly controlled by the government. However, government credit allocation influences farm decisions which in turn affect he government's growth objective. This hierarchical decision making situation is modeled as a linear/quadratic bilevel program. Although the size of the model was moderate, the solution algorithms available to the authors failed to solve the resulting problem. Therefore, a heuristic approach, which is a combination of quadratic programming and cutting plan...|$|R
40|$|Motivated {{by recent}} {{increases}} in network traffic, we propose a decentralized network edge-based solution to peak-hour broadband congestion that incentivizes users to moderate their bandwidth demands to their actual needs. Our solution {{is centered on}} smart home gateways that allocate bandwidth in a two-level hierarchy: first, a gateway purchases guaranteed bandwidth from the Internet Service Provider (ISP) with virtual credits. It then self-limits its bandwidth usage and distributes the bandwidth among its apps and devices according to their relative priorities. To this end, we design a <b>credit</b> allocation and <b>redistribution</b> mechanism for the first level, and implement our gateways on commodity wireless routers for the second level. We demonstrate our system's effectiveness and practicality with theoretical analysis, simulations and experiments on real traffic. Compared to a baseline equal sharing algorithm, our solution significantly improves users' overall satisfaction and yields a fair allocation of bandwidth across users...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the interaction among inequality, redistribution and economic growth. The literature proposes {{two kinds of}} connection: the so called virtuous circle which sug-gests that redistribution reduces inequality and this accelerates growth which also reduces inequality. According to this view there is no space for permanent redistributive policies. A one-time redistribution is adequate and can guarantee both less income inequality and higher growth. The second type of connection concludes that redistribution reduces inequality and this accelerates growth however economic growth tends to increase inequality. Therefore, {{there is a need}} for permanent redistributive policies that play a countercyclical role against this vicious circle. According to this approach government intervention through taxation and redistributive policies can play an active role by enhancing growth and reducing inequality. Using an Overlapping Generations model with heterogeneous agents, in a two-sector econ-omy we conclude that in the presence of <b>credit</b> market imperfections <b>redistribution</b> affects growth. We also provide econometric evidence on the direction of the exactly opposite effect, of growth on inequality, and finally a response to whether this circle is indeed virtuous or just vicious...|$|R
40|$|We {{compare and}} {{contrast}} the labor market and distributional impact of three common approaches to state and federal health insurance expansion: public insurance expansions, refundable tax credits for low income people, and employer and individual mandates. We draw on existing estimates from the literature and individual-level data on the non-institutionalized population aged 64 and younger from the 2005 Current Population Survey to estimate how each approach affects (1) {{the number of people}} insured; (2) private and public health spending; (3) employment and wages; and (4) the distribution of subsidies across families based on income in relation to the federal poverty level and work status of adult family members. Employer mandates expand coverage to the largest number of previously insured relative to public insurance expansions and individual tax credits, but with potentially negative labor market consequences. Medicaid expansions could achieve moderate reductions in the share of the uninsured with neutral labor market consequences, and by definition, they expand coverage to the poorest groups regardless of work status. Tax credits extend coverage to relatively few uninsured, but with neutral effects on the labor market. Both Medicaid expansions and tax <b>credits</b> offer moderate <b>redistribution</b> to previously insured individuals who are poor or near-poor. None of the three policies significantly expand insurance coverage among poor working families. Our findings suggest that no single approach helps the working poor in exactly the ways policy makers might hope. To the extent that states are motivated to help the uninsured in poor working families, health reforms must find ways to include those unlikely to take up optional policies, and states must address the challenge of the many uninsured likely to be excluded from policies based on part-time work status, firm size, or immigration status. ...|$|R

En primeiro lugar realizouse un estudio teórico onde podemos ver que a actividade financeira pode afectar no curto e medio prazo á desigualdade na renda e riqueza por varios canais: canal da composición de ingresos, da carteira, da segmentación financeira, do fluxo de crédito, da redistribución do aforro e das ganancias heteroxéneas. No largo prazo, a actividade financeira afecta á desigualdade na renda e riqueza directamente á través do desenrolo financeiro e, indirectamente, á través da influencia que a actividade financeira ten no crecemento económico e no acceso á educación. No caso da desigualdade no consumo, repásanse as principais teorías que recollen a relación estudada, onde se pode observar o importante papel que xoga o sistema financeiro na evolución das desigualdades no consumo. En segundo lugar, realizamos un estudio empírico, onde ampliamos o estudio de Beck et al (2007). Estes autores, nun estudio de países de diverso nivel de desenrolo económico, encontraban que o 40 % das reducións na desigualdade da renta eran derivadas do impacto positivo que tiña a actividade financeira directamente, mentres que o 60 % restante, viña derivado da influencia que a actividade financeira exercía no crecemento económico. No caso do noso estudo para os países europeos desenrolados, vemos que a actividade financeira non afecta directamente á desigualdade na renda e riqueza, e só o fai indirectamente á través de factores de crecemento económico, e de xeito asimétrico ante perídos de crecemento e recesión. Adicionalmente, o que se encontra en común nos dous estudos é que o desenrolo financeiro, á marxe do que suceda coa desigualdade, reduce o riesgo de pobreza da xente. Ademais, o presente traballo, complementa a análise da desigualdade co estudio da desigualdade no consumo, onde vemos o importante papel que xoga a actividade financeira nas devantidas desigualdades, o que provoca que as desigualdades no consumo poidan aumentar ou reducirse, independentemente do que pase coas desigualdades na renda e riqueza. [Abstract] The aim of {{this work}} is {{to see how the}} {{financial}} activity affects to inequality in income, wealth and consumption. Firstly, we carried out a theoretical analysis where we can see that financial activity can affect in the short and medium term inequality in income and wealth by several channels: the income composition, the portfolio, financial segmentation, flow of <b>credit,</b> the <b>redistribution</b> of savings and heterogeneous profits. In the long term, the financial activity affects the inequality in income and wealth directly through financial development, and indirectly, through the influence that financial activity has in economic growth and education access. In case of inequality in consumption, it is reviewed the main theories that studied the relationship between the variables studied, where we can see the important role of the financial system in the evolution of inequalities in consumption. Secondly, we conducted an empirical analysis, where we extended the study of Beck et al (2007). These authors, in a study of countries at different levels of economic development, found that 40 % of the reductions in inequality was derived from the positive impact that financial activity has directly, while the remaining 60 % came from the influence that financial activity exercised in economic growth. In the case of our study, where we developed European countries, we see that financial activity does not directly affect the inequality in income and wealth, and only makes indirectly effects through economic growth factors, and with asymmetric effects during periods of growth and recession. The idea that is common in the two studies is that the financial development, regardless of what happens with inequality, reduces the risk of poverty of the people. In addition, this work complements the analysis of the study of inequality in consumption inequality, where we see the important role of financial activity in devantidas inequalities, causing that inequalities in consumption can increase or reduce independently, what happens whith income and wealth inequality.
