5|$|Before 1932, the <b>Cipher</b> Bureau {{had succeeded}} in solving an earlier Enigma machine that functioned without a plugboard, but had been {{unsuccessful}} with the Enigma I, a new standard German <b>cipher</b> machine that was coming into widespread use.

5|$|In cryptography, a Caesar <b>cipher,</b> {{also known}} as Caesar's <b>cipher,</b> the shift <b>cipher,</b> Caesar's code or Caesar shift, {{is one of the}} {{simplest}} and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution <b>cipher</b> in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.|$|E

Since then many <b>ciphers</b> have been developed and used. Many of these old <b>ciphers</b> are much too weak {{to be used in}} applications today, because of the tremendous progress in computer technology. Until 1977 all <b>ciphers</b> were so-called one-key <b>ciphers</b> or conventional <b>ciphers.</b> In these <b>ciphers</b> the keys for encryption and decryption are identical or easily derived from each other. In 1977 Diffle and Hellman introduced two-key <b>ciphers</b> or public-key <b>ciphers,</b> where the knowledge of one key gi [...] ...|$|R

5|$|In mid-1931, the <b>Cipher</b> Bureau {{was formed}} by the merger of {{pre-existing}} agencies. In December 1932, the Bureau began breaking Germany's Enigma ciphers.
