5000|$|Pterostylis flavovirens, {{commonly}} known as the <b>coastal</b> <b>banded</b> greenhood, is a plant in the orchid family Orchidaceae and is endemic to South Australia where it grows in coastal areas of the Eyre Peninsula, Yorke Peninsula, Southern Lofty, Kangaroo Island and South-Eastern botanical regions of South Australia. It was first formally described in 2006 by David Jones who gave it the name Bunochilus flavovirens. The description was published in the journal Australian Orchid Research from a specimen collected near Port Lincoln. In 2008 Robert Bates changed the name to Pterostylis flavovirens. The specific epithet (flavovirens) is derived from the Latin words flavus meaning “golden-yellow” or [...] "yellow" [...] and virens meaning [...] "green".|$|R

50|$|During {{the ancient}} ages, Tarsus was a Mediterranean Sea port. But because of {{alluvial}} deposits from the Berdan River the coastline was continuously moving to south. By the 6th century, the coastline {{had already been}} moved away and a small lagoon named Rhegma had been formed which obstructed the river flow in the rainy seasons and caused floods. Byzantine Emperor Justinian I (reigned 527-565) had a channel constructed at {{the east of the}} city to facilitate easier flow. (present watercourse of the river). After 7th century the lake was partially dried up and turned into marshes. But because of the marshes, the number of malaria cases increased sharply. In 1939, the Turkish government (ministry of forestry) started a project to drain the marshes. Eucalyptus trees were planted on 885 hectare area and the marshes were totally drained.In 1960s the forest was further enlarged by covering the <b>coastal</b> <b>band.</b> Pine was preferred in the <b>coastal</b> <b>band.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{first modern}} tomol was built and {{launched}} in 1976 {{as a result}} of a joint venture between Quabajai Chumash of the <b>Coastal</b> <b>Band</b> of the Chumash Nation and the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History.

The Brotherhood of the Tomol was revived and her crew paddled and circumnavigated around the Santa Barbara Channel Islands on a 10-day journey, stopping on three of the islands. The second tomol, the Elye'wun ("swordfish"), was launched in 1997.|$|E

50|$|In {{many other}} parts of Australia, there are {{dramatic}} climatic transitions over fairly short distances. The Great Dividing Range, which parallels the entire east and south-east coast, is responsible for the typical pattern of a well-watered coastal strip, a fairly narrow band of mountains, and then a vast, inward-draining plain that receives little rainfall. In the Gulf Country, however, there are no mountains to restrict rainfall to the <b>coastal</b> <b>band</b> and the transition from the profuse tropical growth of the seaside areas to the arid scrubs of central Australia is gradual.|$|E

North of Mendocino County, the California slender salamander occurs in a narrower <b>coastal</b> <b>band</b> within ten to forty miles of the ocean.

40|$|Between December 2001 and February 2002, NOAA-AVHRR {{images were}} {{obtained}} {{twice a day}} for the region between 30 - 40 S and 70 - 80 W. Within the cloud free areas, sea surface temperature was calculated according to standard split window algorithms.

All pairs of images were analyzed with respect to advective surface velocity by means of Maximum Cross-Correlation. Maximum Cross-Correlations exceeding the predetermined significance level of cross correlation were accepted. From all pairs of comparison monthly advective velocity maps (and SST maps) were constructed and separated in a <b>coastal</b> and offshore <b>band.</b> <b>Coastal</b> upwelling was observed along the coast of central Chile in all three months via the SST maps.

50|$|Ice {{formation}} {{starts in}} September {{on the north}} and October on the south. It results in a large continuous sheet of ice, with the thickness up to 2 m in the south-eastern {{part of the sea}} as well as near the coast. The coastal sheet ends at the water depth of 20-25 m which occurs at several hundred kilometers from the shore, thus this coastal ice covers some 30% of the sea area. Ice is drifting north to this <b>coastal</b> <b>band,</b> and several polynyas are formed by the warm south winds around there. They have various names, such as the Great Siberian Polynya, and can stretch over many hundreds kilometers. The ice sheet starts melting in late May-early June, creating fragmented ice agglomerates on the north-west and south-east and often revealing remains of the mammoths. The ice formation varies from year to year, with the sea either clear or completely covered with ice.|$|E
