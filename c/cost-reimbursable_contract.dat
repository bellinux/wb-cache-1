5000|$|The {{final cost}} of the project is {{uncertain}} when construction begins because design is not complete. [...] With the traditional design-bid-build process, {{a complete set of}} construction documents and specifications describes what the builder agrees to build and serves as the heart of the contract. On Fast-Track projects, the design, construction documents and specifications are incomplete, so setting the final cost presents problems. To deal with this difficultly, owners typically use a <b>cost-reimbursable</b> <b>contract</b> with the builder (a construction manager or a general contractor). The contract may include a cost estimate with no guarantee or there may be a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP). However, even with a GMP, there can be argument over the scope of work covered by the GMP since the design was incomplete when the contract was executed.|$|E
40|$|MBA Professional ReportThis {{study is}} {{designed}} to support one of three major focus areas in the Naval Supply Systems Command (NAVSUP) Worldwide Husbanding Improvement Process initiative. Existing contracting methodologies were analyzed using the following methods: characteristics of existing contract vehicles within forecasting and simulation frameworks; strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats (SWOT) analysis, and stakeholder analysis. Conclusions are drawn and recommendations are outlined for optimum methods of contracting for husbanding services as requested by the Worldwide Husbanding Process Improvement Action Team. Historical husbanding contract data were reviewed, including constraints and desired performance criteria. Implementation of a flat-rate, low-variability, well-defined and constant set of requirements minimizes risk and price fluctuations. Conversely, adoption of a <b>cost-reimbursable</b> <b>contract</b> type is both undesirable and infeasible. A contracting methodology that represents a best-value trade-off within constraints should be flexible and risk-based while offering performance-based incentives...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} successes and {{failures}} of privatization and other contract reform initiatives within the DOE Weapons Complex {{over the past seven}} years. The paper concludes that the {{successes and failures}} of these project delivery methods depend largely on the risks attendant with the project itself. For example, where the wastes to be remediated defy characterization and the technology is innovative, the Department ordinarily should bear most of the risk, and some specie of <b>cost-reimbursable</b> <b>contracting</b> should be employed. On the other hand, where the risks are readily quantifiable and the technology is proven, more of the risk and responsibility can and should be placed on the contractor. This form of risk transference runs the continuum from lump-sum contracting to design/build, to privatization, depending on the circumstances. The preferred contracting form, however, is not dictated solely by project-related risk. Onto this risk must be overlain a set of risks that derive from the project management capabilities and the institutional biases of the oversight M&O or M&I contractor. Foremost among this additional set of risks is the ability of the oversight contractor to employ a level of contractual interface that is commensurate and proportionate with the selected project delivery method...|$|R

Given the global economic climate {{and the level of}} federal debt, government budget spending is unlikely to recover in the near future to previous levels, where aerospace and defense contractors had enjoyed an abundance of million and billion dollar <b>cost-reimbursable</b> <b>contracts.</b> In current business conditions, company leadership has put a new focus on finding and developing business in adjacent markets, where core competencies can be utilized to generate alternative streams of revenue. In order to provide insight into potential adjacent markets for aerospace technologies and entry strategies that increase chances of success, this thesis analyzes cases of technologies originally developed for an aerospace application that were eventually adopted for use in another (non-aerospace) industry. Analysis of metrics and 35 cases compiled from NASA's Spinoff and Technology Databases reinforce several observations that have been generalized in other literature: 1) a wide variety of industries could be considered adjacent markets, 2) entering established industries may offer the highest technology adoption rate, 3) partnership with an existing firm or organization with knowledge of the adjacent market has {{played a key role in}} the successful adoption of the technology in the adjacent market, and 4) building-block technologies at the subsystem, component and base material level most often traversed market boundaries. However, a handful of cases prove that systems can traverse market boundaries in whole under certain conditions. Most importantly, the role of the aerospace industry as advanced analog lead users is a unique advantage that aerospace firms should leverage. by Jennifer Y. Wang. Thesis: S.

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Lawrence Berkeley) located in Berkeley, California, is a government-owned, contractor-operated Department of Energy (DOE) national laboratory. The University of California manages the lab under a <b>cost-reimbursable</b> <b>contract</b> with DOE. The university is paid a management fee to operate the lab and is reimbursed for all allowable costs charged to the contract. During the fall of 2002, the Federal Bureau of Investigation began investigating two Los Alamos National Laboratory employees for alleged misuse of lab credit cards. Other allegations of theft and misuse of government funds at Los Alamos soon followed. In light of the problems identified at Los Alamos, Congress asked us to review selected procurement and property management practices at two NNSA and two DOE contractor labs, including Lawrence Berkeley. This report summarizes the information provided during our June 14, 2004 briefing to GAO's staff on these issues {{as they relate to}} Lawrence Berkeley. Specifically, we reviewed Lawrence Berkeley's purchase card program and property management practices to determine whether (1) internal controls over the lab's purchase card (Pcard) program provided reasonable assurance that improper purchases would not occur or would be detected in the normal course of business, (2) purchase card expenditures made under the contract properly complied with lab policies and other applicable requirements and were reasonable in nature and amount and thus were allowable costs payable to the contractor under the contract, and (3) property controls over selected asset acquisitions provided reasonable assurance that accountable assets would be properly recorded and tracked. Our review covered selected transactions that occurred during fiscal year 2002 and the first half of fiscal year 2003 (October 1, 2001, through March 31, 2003), which were the most current data available when we requested the data for our review. ...|$|E
