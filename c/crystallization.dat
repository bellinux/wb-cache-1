40|$|Gamma-class_ 4 dim is {{a program}} yielding, from any given list X of <b>crystallizations</b> of 4 -dimensional PL-manifolds, the {{automatic}} partition {{of the elements of}} X into equivalence classes, such that each class contains only <b>crystallizations</b> representing the same PL-manifold. Moreover, the program attempts the identification of the represented 4 -manifolds by means of comparison of the representatives of each class with known catalogues of <b>crystallizations</b> and/or by means of splitting into connected sums. Gamma-class_ 4 dim is based on the existence of elementary combinatorial moves available for <b>crystallizations</b> of PL-manifolds of any dimension (i. e. the well-known "dipole moves", together with the so called "blobs" and "flips", introduced in [S. Lins - M. Mulazzani, Blobs and flips on gems, Journal of Knot Theory and its Ramifications 15 (2006), 1001 - 1035]. The program has already been tested for known catalogues of <b>crystallizations</b> of 4 -manifolds, by making use of a fixed admissible sequence of the above moves; further applications are in progress...|$|R

In dimension 3, we apply the moves to prove an identity among quantum 6 j-symbols, and we propose a new model for a quantum topological invariant.

5|$|Although {{white dwarf}} {{material}} is initially plasma—a fluid composed of nuclei and electrons—it was theoretically predicted in the 1960s {{that at a}} late stage of cooling, it should crystallize, starting at its center. The crystal structure {{is thought to be}} a body-centered cubic lattice. In 1995 it was suggested that asteroseismological observations of pulsating white dwarfs yielded a potential test of the <b>crystallization</b> theory, and in 2004, observations were made that suggested approximately 90% of the mass of BPM 37093 had crystallized. Other work gives a crystallized mass fraction of between 32% and 82%. As a white dwarf core undergoes <b>crystallization</b> into a solid phase, latent heat is released which provides a source of thermal energy that delays its cooling.|$|E

This method has been supplanted by solvent extraction from fluoride-containing solutions of tantalum.|$|E
5|$|If the solvent {{is water}} {{in either the}} {{evaporation}} or precipitation method of formation, {{in many cases the}} ionic crystal formed also includes water of <b>crystallization,</b> so the product is known as a hydrate, and can have very different chemical properties.|$|E

40|$|A simple {{proof of}} orientability in colored group field theory Francesco Caravelli 1, 2, 3 Background: Group field theory is an {{emerging}} {{field at the}} boundary between Quantum Gravity, Statistical Mechanics and Quantum Field Theory and provides a path integral for the gluing of n-simplices. Colored group field theory has been introduced {{in order to improve}} the renormalizability of the theory and associates colors to the faces of the simplices. The theory of <b>crystallizations</b> is instead a field at the boundary between graph theory and combinatorial topology and deals with n-simplices as colored graphs. Several techniques have been introduced in order to study the topology of the pseudo-manifold associated to the colored graph. Although of the similarity between colored group field theory and the theory of <b>crystallizations,</b> the connection between the two fields has never been made explicit. Findings: In this short note we use results from the theory of <b>crystallizations</b> to prove that color in group field theories guarantees orientability of the piecewise linear pseudo-manifolds associated to each graph generated perturbatively. Conclusions: Colored group field theories generate orientable pseudo-manifolds. The origin of orientability is the presence of two interaction vertices in the action of colored group field theories. In order to obtain the result, we made the connection between the theory of <b>crystallizations</b> and colored group field theory...|$|R
5|$|An {{example of}} a low-maintenance {{experiment}} was the protein crystal growth experiment, which had also been flown on previous shuttle missions. The goal was to produce better protein <b>crystallizations</b> than those produced on the Earth, and hence allowing for a more accurate model of protein structures. Of the 23 proteins and viruses attempted during Expedition 1, only four resulted in successful <b>crystallizations,</b> which was a lower success rate than predicted. Of those successful was the low-calorie sweetener Thaumatin, whose crystals diffracted at a higher resolution than Earth-grown crystal, {{which resulted in a}} more accurate protein structure model.|$|R

5|$|It is {{extremely}} difficult to predict good conditions for nucleation or growth of well-ordered crystals. In practice, favorable conditions are identified by screening; a very large batch of the molecules is prepared, and a wide variety of <b>crystallization</b> solutions are tested. Hundreds, even thousands, of solution conditions are generally tried before finding the successful one. The various conditions can use one or more physical mechanisms to lower the solubility of the molecule; for example, some may change the pH, some contain salts of the Hofmeister series or chemicals that lower the dielectric constant of the solution, and still others contain large polymers such as polyethylene glycol that drive the molecule out of solution by entropic effects. It is also common to try several temperatures for encouraging <b>crystallization,</b> or to gradually lower the temperature so that the solution becomes supersaturated. These methods require large amounts of the target molecule, as they use high concentration of the molecule(s) to be crystallized. Due to the difficulty in obtaining such large quantities (milligrams) of crystallization-grade protein, robots have been developed that are capable of accurately dispensing <b>crystallization</b> trial drops that are in the order of 100 nanoliters in volume. This means that 10-fold less protein is used per experiment when compared to <b>crystallization</b> trials set up by hand (in the order of 1 microliter).|$|E

50|$|Research {{tends to}} agree that these {{structures}} exist, and appear to replicate in some way.

50|$|Ginkolides A - C were {{isolated}} {{from a large}} scale methanolic extraction followed by liquid-liquid partitions, column chromatography and repeated <b>crystallizations.</b> The molecular formulas were determined by high resolution mass spectrometry, and the overall structures by IR and NMR spectroscopic analysis and extensive derivitization techniques.|$|R
5|$|Small-molecule and {{macromolecular}} crystallography {{differ in}} the range of possible techniques used to produce diffraction-quality crystals. Small molecules generally have few degrees of conformational freedom, and may be crystallized by a wide range of methods, such as chemical vapor deposition and recrystallization. By contrast, macromolecules generally have many degrees of freedom and their <b>crystallization</b> must be carried out so as to maintain a stable structure. For example, proteins and larger RNA molecules cannot be crystallized if their tertiary structure has been unfolded; therefore, the range of <b>crystallization</b> conditions is restricted to solution conditions in which such molecules remain folded.|$|E
5|$|After production, the fermium must be {{separated}} from other actinides and from lanthanide fission products. This is usually achieved by ion-exchange chromatography, with the standard process using a cation exchanger such as Dowex50 or TEVA eluted with a solution of ammonium α-hydroxyisobutyrate. Smaller cations form more stable complexes with the α-hydroxyisobutyrate anion, and so are preferentially eluted from the column. A rapid fractional <b>crystallization</b> method has also been described.|$|E
5|$|Although {{rubidium}} is {{more abundant}} in Earth's crust than caesium, the limited applications {{and the lack}} of a mineral rich in rubidium limits the production of rubidium compounds to 2 to 4 tonnes per year. Several methods are available for separating potassium, rubidium, and caesium. The fractional <b>crystallization</b> of a rubidium and caesium alum (Cs,Rb)Al(SO4)2·12H2O yields after 30 subsequent steps pure rubidium alum. Two other methods are reported, the chlorostannate process and the ferrocyanide process.|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that every Heegaard diagram canonically induces a (balanced) {{presentation}} of the fundamental group of the represented 3 -manifold. Given a group presentation P, let M(P) denote the class of all 3 -manifolds which admit a Heegaard diagram inducing P; if M(P) is nonvoid, then P {{is said to be a}} geometric group presentation. The present paper makes use of the manifold representation theory by edge-coloured graphs in order to derive a new algorithm, which efficiently tests the geometricity of the presentation P and produces <b>crystallizations</b> of all 3 -manifolds of M(P).
