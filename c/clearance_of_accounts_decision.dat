40|$|Travel {{and tourism}} makes {{up a large}} {{proportion}} of business to customer (B 2 C) e-commerce activity, and e-commerce in this sector is growing rapidly. Users can find vast amounts of travel related information and purchase a wide range of travel related goods and services through the Internet. This presents users with a complex decision-making task when planning a trip or a holiday using on-line facilities. This paper examines a range <b>of</b> <b>accounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>decision</b> making developed both in the context of e-commerce and in travel and tourism. The accounts are compared with data from an investigation using a think-aloud protocol examining a simulated decision task. The results of the investigation suggest that neither the e-commerce models nor the <b>accounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>decision</b> making in travel and tourism, provide completely adequate <b>accounts</b> <b>of</b> user behaviours if used in isolation. Rather elements from both sets of models must be considered relevant. Based on the findings a preliminary framework for the design of new decision-support tools is suggested...|$|R

30|$|Visualizations—visual {{representations}} of information, depicted in graphics—are studied by researchers in numerous ways, {{ranging from the}} study of the basic principles of creating visualizations, to the cognitive processes underlying their use, as well as how visualizations communicate complex information (such as in medical risk or spatial patterns). However, findings from different domains are rarely shared across domains though there may be domain-general principles underlying visualizations and their use. The limited cross-domain communication may be {{due to a lack of}} a unifying cognitive framework. This review aims to address this gap by proposing an integrative model that is grounded in models of visualization comprehension and a dual-process <b>account</b> <b>of</b> <b>decision</b> making. We review empirical studies of decision making with static two-dimensional visualizations motivated by a wide range of research goals and find significant direct and indirect support for a dual-process <b>account</b> <b>of</b> <b>decision</b> making with visualizations. Consistent with a dual-process model, the first type of visualization decision mechanism produces fast, easy, and computationally light decisions with visualizations. The second facilitates slower, more contemplative, and effortful decisions with visualizations. We illustrate the utility <b>of</b> a dual-process <b>account</b> <b>of</b> <b>decision</b> making with visualizations using four cross-domain findings that may constitute universal visualization principles. Further, we offer guidance for future research, including novel areas of exploration and practical recommendations for visualization designers based on cognitive theory and empirical findings.|$|R

40|$|This study {{extends the}} {{accounting}} choice literature by empirically examining {{a set of}} firms {{that do not have}} long-term debt (unlevered) in their capital structure. Currently, evidence on how these firms make <b>accounting</b> choice <b>decisions</b> is scarce. Empirical evidence on this issue is important for two reasons. First, the case of unlevered firms serves as an additional testing ground for the positive theory <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> choice and the findings are likely to enhance our understanding <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> choice <b>decisions</b> per se. Second, it offers light in the area of generalizability of debt/equity and political cost hypotheses, particularly to smaller firms. The results indicate that unlevered firms tend to choose income-increasing accounting methods more than their levered counterparts. This is particularly true in the case of inventory method choice. It appears that even without the presence of long-term debt, leverage, measured as total short-term liabilities over equity, is a significant determinant <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> choice.

30|$|We {{argue that}} for {{visualizations}} {{to be most}} effective, researchers need to integrate decision-making frameworks into visualization cognition research. Reviews of decision making with visual-spatial uncertainty also agree {{there has been a}} general lack of emphasis on mental processes within the visualization decision-making literature (Kinkeldey, MacEachren, Riveiro, & Schiewe, 2017; Kinkeldey, MacEachren, & Schiewe, 2014). The framework that has dominated applied decision-making research for the last 30  years is a dual-process <b>account</b> <b>of</b> <b>decision</b> making. Dual-process theories propose that we have two types of decision processes: one for automatic, easy decisions (Type 1); and another for more contemplative decisions (Type 2) (Kahneman & Frederick, 2002; Stanovich, 1999). 1 Even though many research areas involving higher-level cognition have made significant efforts to incorporate dual-process theories (Evans, 2008), visualization research has yet to directly test the application of current decision-making frameworks or develop an effective cognitive model for decision making with visualizations. The goal of this work is to integrate a dual-process <b>account</b> <b>of</b> <b>decision</b> making with established cognitive frameworks of visualization comprehension.|$|R

40|$|Eptifibatide is a {{glycoprotein}} IIb/IIIainhibitor used {{to inhibit}} platelet ag-gregation and prevent thromboses in pa-tients with acute coronary syndrome. Re-nal <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> eptifibatide <b>accounts</b> for approximately 50 % of total body clear-ance, {{with the majority}} of the drug excret-ed in the urine unchanged or as metabo-lites. 1 In patients with moderate-to-severe renal insufficiency, the <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> the drug is decreased by approximately half. To prevent dangerous drug accumulation, the manufacturer of eptifibatide recom-mends that after the initial bolus, the con-tinuous infusion dose should be adjusted from 2 µg/kg/min to 1 µg/kg/min for all patients with moderate-to-severe renal in-sufficiency. Based on pharmacokinetic studies, this is further defined as a creati-nine clearance (CrCl) less than 50 mL/min as calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault (CG) formula using actual body weight (ABW). 1, 2 Medications that are renally eliminat-ed often require dosing adjustments to protect patients from harmful drug accu-mulation. While the most precise mecha-nism in determining renal function is di-rect measurement of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) using an exogenous marker, this is costly and unfeasible in clinical practice. A common alternative is to use the <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> an endogenous marker, creatinine, as an es-timate of renal function. CrCl can be determined using 24 -hour urine creatinine measurements but is more commonly estimated from serum creatinine (SCr) levels manipulated with an equation that takes several relevant patient parame-ters into consideration.

40|$|In {{their joint}} {{framework}} project, the FASB and the IASB recently proposed dropping stewardship {{as a separate}} objective <b>of</b> financial <b>accounting,</b> because the Boards view stewardship and valuation usefulness as compatible sub-objectives ranking under an overall objective of decision usefulness. This paper puts this conjecture to an empirical test. As it is widely agreed that asymmetric timely earnings increase the contractual efficiency <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> information, I first test whether firms with more asymmetric timely earnings produce more valuation-useful financial accounting information. Second, I test whether firms with more influential non-equity stakeholders provide more valuation-useful financial accounting information. As non-equity stakeholders in general face higher transaction costs when diversifying unsystematic risk compared to equity stakeholders and as stewardship-related risks {{should be at least}} in part unsystematic, I expect the demand for stewardship-related accounting information to increase with the influence of non-equity stakeholders. Using a broad sample of U. S. firms and a set of firm-specific metrics for valuation usefulness based on short-window capital market reactions to quarterly earnings announcements, I document that the valuation usefulness <b>of</b> financial <b>accounting</b> information is consistently negatively related to its stewardshiporientation.
