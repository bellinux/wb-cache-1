40|$|Australia’s {{legislative}} definition <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> <b>residence</b> {{has remained}} unchanged since 1936. New Zealand amended its legislative definition in 1988. This article examines specifically the concept <b>of</b> the <b>tax</b> <b>residence</b> <b>of</b> {{individuals in the}} 21 st century in light of Interpretation Statement IS 16 / 03, a comprehensive guideline issued by New Zealand’s Inland Revenue on 20 September 2016. This interpretation statement demonstrates New Zealand’s increased objectivity in its definition. In addition, this article answers {{the question of whether}} a relatively minor change similar to that in New Zealand would be possible in Australia for the benefit of both the revenue and taxpayers. In New Zealand, the permanent place of abode test was amended in 1988 so that an individual will be resident, despite any other provision, if the individual has “a permanent place of abode in New Zealand, whether or not they have a permanent place of abode outside New Zealand”. This amendment focused the test on the individual’s connections with New Zealand, rather than whether the individual had closer connections with New Zealand or another country. This made it more difficult to lose New Zealand residence. 48 This emphasis was reinforced by extending the number of days test to be a non-resident from 183 to 325 days. Given that the Australian superannuation test should be reviewed, particularly in light of potential discrimination, it would be timely to simplify the Australian definition of residence for individuals using the New Zealand model. The advantage of using the New Zealand model is also that most of the case law applicable in Australia would remain relevant. A changed definition would have less impact than many definitions rewritten as part of the Australian 1997 Income Tax Assessment Act. The New Zealand public service definition provides a simple and modern approach to ensuring that public servants working overseas are treated as residents. The different components of the New Zealand definition, if applied in Australia, would retain the substance and intention of the Australian definition, albeit that in making the rules more objective, they would support the Australian Taxation Office in identifying and acting to prevent tax avoidance. They would modernise the law to suit a world in which individuals are far more mobile. A clearly objective standard, moderated by the opportunity for taxpayers to show that their circumstances support a decision by the Commissioner not to treat them as resident, balances the principles of certainty and fairness. The balance will never be perfect. However, the overall effect would not only make the law simpler, clearer and more efficient but, based on the cases discussed above, fairer for taxpayers...|$|R

40|$|The Swedish {{exit tax}} {{legislation}} in Chapter 22. § 5 p. 4 IL states that businesses who change its <b>tax</b> <b>residence</b> to another Member State within the EES are taxed as having its assets {{sold at the}} time of the change of domicile. This legislation was declared incompatible with the freedom of establishment in case RÅ 2009 ref. 30 due to the fact that businesses who changed <b>tax</b> <b>residence</b> were treated worse than businesses that remained within the Member State of origin. Of importance for the outcome of the case was the fact that ECJ had declared exit tax incompatible with the freedom of establishment in two previous cases. In connection with RÅ 2008 ref. 30 the Commission also addressed requirements for Sweden to abolish the restrictive legislation through a reasoned opinion. In the aftermath of RÅ 2008 ref. 30 the legislator drafted a suggestion for new legislation which aimed to make the exit tag legislation in IL compatible with the freedom of establishment. The legislator made clear that the communication from the Commission on exit taxation was of great significance in formulating the legislation, particularly the requirement from the Commission that exit tax ought not to lead to immediate tax consequences for the businesses. The suggested legislation made businesses able to defer payment <b>of</b> the exit <b>tax</b> by introducing a new chapter in SBL. Thus did not the wording <b>of</b> the exit <b>tax</b> legislation in IL change. The suggested legislation was heavily criticized by the respondents in the preparatory legislation and also in legal doctrine. The legislation was, however, adopted and the deferment legislation in Chapter 17 a SBL came into force 1 January 2010. The question that arises is whether this addition to the exit tax legislation is a sufficient action to achieve the objective of the legislation. It can be concluded that the situation for businesses changing <b>tax</b> <b>residence</b> is not significantly affected by the introduction of the deferment legislation in Chapter 17 a SBL. The fact remains that business changing <b>tax</b> <b>residence</b> still are adversely affected due to the fact that taxation occurs on the exit date, which can have the effect of these businesses being taxed in an earlier phase than resident businesses. Consequently the legislation continue to impose immediate tax consequences in certain cases. The fact that the legislation could be achieved in a less restrictive manner by placing the time of taxation at the real disposal of the assets makes the legislation disproportionate. Furthermore, it is not obvious that the conditions which the deferment is associated with should be seen as proportionate either. Due to the fact that it is ascertain that the conditions in some cases can be costly in terms of valuation costs and that the purpose of the legislation could be achieved in a less restrictive manner by applying directives in the field of mutual assistance and recovery of claims instead of an annual deferment procedure. The conditions could therefore be considered disproportionate in relation to the purpose of the legislation. Nevertheless, the main reason for arguing that the Swedish exit tax legislation should be considered as incompatible with the freedom of establishment is the fact that the legislation does not take full account <b>of</b> the <b>taxed</b> assets potential decrease in value, capable of arising after the businesses transfer <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> <b>residence.</b> Through ECJ-case law it can be noted that decrease in value must be taken into account by either the state of origin or the host state to be considered proportionate. The Swedish exit tax legislation is therefore incompatible with the freedom of establishment in all cases where the host state does not take notice of such decrease in value...|$|R
5000|$|Then, if the {{beneficial}} owner {{would like to}} use the reduced rate under GR-CH double tax treaty (10%), he would have to file a refund claim to the Swiss tax authorities. That claim would have to be accompanied by a certificate <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> <b>residence</b> issued by the Greek tax authorities. When requesting this certificate, {{the beneficial}} owner is effectively signalling to the Greek tax authorities {{the fact that he has}} earned or will earn income from a foreign source. Once he has filed the refund claim to the Swiss authorities, the Greek beneficial owner will be entitled to a refund for the difference between the anticipatory tax (500*0.35=175) and the maximum tax under the double tax treaty (500*0.10=50), which is 175-50=125. So, the actual tax burden in Switzerland after the application of the refund procedure is EUR 50. Now if the Greek domestic tax on the inbound interest income is 10%, it would in principle be levied on a gross basis, i.e. the tax base would be the full amount of interest income received (EUR 500). The Greek tax liability would be 500*0.10=50. However, under Art. 22 of the GR-CH Double tax treaty [...] "Where a resident of Greece derives income which, in accordance with the provisions of this Convention may be taxed in Switzerland, Greece shall allow as a deduction from the tax on the income of that resident an amount equal to the income tax paid in Switzerland. Such deduction shall not, however, exceed that part <b>of</b> the Greek <b>tax,</b> as computed before the deduction is given, which is attributable to the income which may be taxed in Switzerland." [...] The Greek beneficial owner would therefore be entitled to credit the EUR 50 levied in Switzerland against his tax liability in Greece, which is also EUR 50. Therefore, after the application of the credit, the Greek beneficial owner would not owe any Greek tax on that interest income.|$|R

40|$|Fiscal {{residence}} of companies {{is a very}} complex issue, mainly {{due to the fact that}} we have to deal with «persons» that do not exist in nature, but are created by national juridical systems. First of all, national legislators can make very different choices with regard to the connecting factors <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> <b>residence,</b> as it happens with international private law rules. With particular reference to the Italian tax system, the connecting factors are the legal seat, the seat of administration and the main object. These last two elements raise many juridical issues, especially with regard to groups and holding companies. Secondly, the notion of fiscal residence plays a specific role in international taxation that must be distinguished from the roles played by the notion of permanent establishment, by CFC legislation and by the beneficial ownership clause. Again, this is particularly true within group structures, where it is not always easy to draw the line between all those concepts. Thirdly, fiscal residence is a quality of juridical subjects, whose identification represents a preliminary issue to be solved. The Italian perspective on this problem is thus analyzed. Fourthly, domestic rules must be coordinated with international rules, in particular with DTC. This requires to examine the role of fiscal residence in DTC and the impact of DTC on the burden of proof. Fifthly, national legislators can adopt measures in order to contrast fictitious fiscal residence. This is what recently happened in Italy with law decree n. 223 / 06 regarding foreign holding companies owning shares in Italian companies and controlled and/or managed from Italy. According to the new rule, these companies are considered resident for tax purposes in Italy unless they can prove the contrary. This rule is very interesting as it is quite unique in the world. Moreover, it raises a number of technical issues that are dealt within this article as, for instance, its relationship with DTC and with the freedom of establishment principle...|$|R
