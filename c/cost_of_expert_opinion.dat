40|$|Sustainability {{assessment}} of agricultural systems is frequently hampered by data availability. Elicitation <b>of</b> <b>expert</b> <b>opinions</b> combined with multi-criteria assessment (MCA) {{could be a}} useful approach for sustainability assessments in data-scarce situations. To our knowledge, the validity <b>of</b> <b>expert</b> <b>opinion</b> used to score sustainability performance of agricultural systems, however, has not been addressed. Also, robustness of the overall outcome of MCA to uncertainty about scores obtained from expert elicitation and weights used to aggregate scores is generally not addressed. The objectives {{of this study were}} to evaluate the validity <b>of</b> <b>expert</b> <b>opinion,</b> and to evaluate the robustness of the overall MCA outcome to uncertainty about scores and weights. The case study considers three soybean agricultural systems in Latin America: conventional agricultural system, with either genetically modified (GM) or non-genetically modified (non-GM) soybeans, and organic agricultural system. The validation was carried out by comparing the sustainability scores <b>of</b> <b>experts</b> with values from scientific studies. The robustness of the overall outcome of the MCA to uncertainty about scores and weights was assessed using Monte Carlo simulation. The comparison <b>of</b> <b>expert</b> <b>opinion</b> with reviewed studies showed that <b>expert</b> <b>opinions</b> are a potential alternative to extensive data-rich methods. The validity <b>of</b> <b>expert</b> <b>opinions</b> can be increased by considering a larger group <b>of</b> <b>experts,</b> {{with a high level of}} knowledge about agricultural systems and sustainability issues. With regard to robustness, the overall outcome of the MCA showed higher variation for organic soybean agricultural systems compared with GM and non-GM, in both Brazil and Argentina...|$|R

40|$|Background: The use <b>of</b> <b>expert</b> <b>opinion</b> is {{widespread}} in economic studies of healthcare utilisation; however, {{few studies have}} attempted to assess the validity of assumptions derived from such sources. Objective: To examine the use <b>of</b> such <b>expert</b> <b>opinion</b> in determining comorbidities associated with atopic dermatitis/eczema (AD/E), which were assessed {{as part of a}} recent third-party payer cost-of-illness study. Design: To identify the disease-related comorbidities that would represent costs associated with AD/E, physicians on an expert panel were asked individually and then collectively to group all International Classification of Diseases, 9 th Edition-Clinical Modification (ICD- 9 -CM) diagnosis codes as Results: The mean prevalence rate of any diagnosis code in the AD/E population was 0. 65 +- 1. 82 % (SD) with a mean odds ratio of 1. 81 +- 0. 96. Comorbidities considered by the expert panel Conclusions: Comparing the result of consensus panels with actual claims histories validated the use <b>of</b> <b>expert</b> <b>opinion</b> in determining comorbidities associated with AD/E. <b>Expert</b> <b>opinion</b> yielded valid results in terms of identifying comorbidities that manifested frequently and disproportionately in the AD/E population.

40|$|The {{inevitable}} though frequently informal use <b>of</b> <b>expert</b> <b>opinion</b> in modelling, {{the increasing}} number of models that incorporate formally <b>expert</b> <b>opinion</b> from a diverse range of experience and stakeholders, arguments for participatory modelling and analytic-deliberative-adaptive approaches to managing complex environmental problems, and an expanding but uneven literature prompt this critical review and analysis. Aims are to propose common definitions, identify and categorise existing concepts and practice, and provide a frame of reference and guidance for future environmental modelling. The extensive literature review and classification conducted demonstrate that a broad and inclusive definition <b>of</b> <b>experts</b> and <b>expert</b> <b>opinion</b> is both required and part of current practice. Thus an expert can be anyone with relevant and extensive or in-depth experience in relation to a topic of interest. The literature review also exposes informal model assumptions and modeller subjectivity, examines in detail the formal uses <b>of</b> <b>expert</b> <b>opinion</b> and <b>expert</b> systems, and critically analyses the main concepts of, and issues arising in, expert elicitation and the modelling of associated uncertainty. It is noted that model scrutiny and use <b>of</b> <b>expert</b> <b>opinion</b> in modelling will benefit from formal, systematic and transparent procedures that include as wide a range of stakeholders as possible. Enhanced awareness and utilisation <b>of</b> <b>expert</b> <b>opinion</b> is required for modelling that meets the informational needs of deliberative fora. These conclusions in no way diminish the importance of conventional science and scientific opinion but recognise the need for a paradigmatic shift from traditional ideals of unbiased and impartial experts towards unbiased processes <b>of</b> <b>expert</b> contestation and a plurality of expertise and eventually models. Priority must be given {{to the quality of the}} enquiry for those responsible for environmental management and policy formulation, and this review emphasises the role for science to maintain and enhance the rigour and formality of the information that informs decision making...|$|R

Bayesian inference about parameters in deterministic {{simulation models}} can require the pooling <b>of</b> <b>expert</b> <b>opinion.</b> One class <b>of</b> approaches to pooling <b>expert</b> <b>opinion</b> {{in this context is}} supra-Bayesian pooling, in which <b>expert</b> <b>opinion</b> is treated as data for an ultimate decision maker.

The suitability of each approach in the context of deterministic simulation models is assessed based on theoretical properties, performance on examples, and the selection and sensitivity of required hyperparameters. In general, we favor a parameter updating approach because it uses more intuitive hyperparameters, it performs sensibly on examples, and because the alternative event updating approach fails to exhibit a desirable property (relative propensity consistency) in all cases. Inference in deterministic simulation models is an increasingly important statistical and practical problem, and supra-Bayesian methods represent one viable option for achieving a sensible pooling <b>of</b> <b>expert</b> <b>opinion.</b> 1...|$|R
