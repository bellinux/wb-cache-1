40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} how the advances in <b>corpus</b> <b>usage</b> in second language learning {{have implications for}} the education of health professionals. The growing understanding that practitioners in the health care disciplines must also be effective communicators means that education for these practitioners is ripe for innovation in educational practice. To illustrate what may be learned in this way, we describe some of our own investigations into the idiomatic use of a particular term which occurred frequently in one of our corpora, concerned with health enquiries directed at an online agony aunt. Those inquiring were frequently concerned with whether the issue they described was ‘normal’ yet idiomatically this was loaded with considerably more meaning than would be disclosed from a mere dictionary definition of the term. Inspection of the contexts in which it occurred suggest that ‘normal’ is a term drawn upon to mark major life transitions and to aid the identification of aspects of physical or mental health where medical intervention is merited. Normalising practices may be enabling, and part of what {{has been described as a}} process of ‘civilizing’ the body. It is through corpora such as ours that practitioners can understand the concepts employed by actual and potential clients, the medical terms used and what they likely mean, in a fruitful convergence of data driven learning and education for health care practitioners...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT- In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} method for mining the Web in order to extract lexical {{patterns}} that help in discriminating the senses of a given polysemic word. These patters are defined as sets and sequences of words strongly related to each sense of the word. To discover the patterns, the method first determines the different senses of the word from a reference lexical database, and then it uses the set of synonyms from each sense as search patterns on the Web. The purpose {{is to create a}} <b>corpus</b> of <b>usage</b> cases per sense, downloading snippets via fast search engines. Finally, it applies a well-known association discovery data mining technique to select the most relevant lexical patterns for each word sense. The preliminary results indicate that making sense out of the Web is possible and the discovered patters should be of great benefit in tasks such as information retrieval and machine translation. 1...|$|R

Chapter 1 contains an overview {{of some of the most}} relevant corpus analysis tools available today, presenting their most interesting features and some of their drawbacks. Chapter 2 begins with an explanation of the reasons why none of the available tools appear to satisfy the requirements of the user community and then continues with technical overview of the current status of the new system developed as part of this work. This presentation is followed by highlights of features that make the system appealing to users and corpus builders (i. e. scholars willing to make their corpora available to the public). The chapter concludes with an indication of future directions for the projects and information on the current availability of the software. Chapter 3 describes the design of an experiment devised to evaluate the usability of the new system in comparison to another <b>corpus</b> tool. <b>Usage</b> of the tool was tested in the context of a documentation task performed on a real assignment during a translation class in a master's degree course.

Notwithstanding these defects (and the rejection by the House of Lords in 1758 of a habeas corpus bill drafted in order to remedy those faults) the custom of using habeas corpus as an anti-impressment remedy flourished within the navy (and, during the short periods of statutory military conscription, within the army); in the late eighteenth century it was impressed sailors who made up the largest constituency using the writ.

40|$|M. A. (Afrikaans) Language is the {{heartbeat}} of broadcasting, and is regarded {{primarily as a}} means of communication that is used for different purposes in different situations. The register of broadcasting language embodies and perpetuates standard language, and fits the specific situation or circumstance in terms of formal, informal and stylistically neutral language. It could be said that the various forms of Afrikaans cannot be regarded as right or wrong, but should be measured against the norms for the situation in which, and the purpose for which, it is used. All the varieties of Afrikaans are of equal value and each register has its rightful place, measured against the standards of functionality with regard to situation and purpose. The Komitee vir Taaladvies (KTA), as the official normative body for the Afrikaans of the SABC, does not act as a competitive linguistic standardiser, but is definitely in an authoritative position in the speech community when it comes to pronouncements on the standardisation of language. The KTA's approach to the <b>usage</b> <b>corpus</b> is that each item should provoke the least resistance from viewers and listeners.

40|$|While the {{so-called}} “fillers” um and uh share {{a great deal}} in the way of interpretation, association, and usage, they are far from perfect substitutes. Previous corpus research, focusing primarily on British English, has identified a number of social and discursive factors with which filler usage can vary, including pause length and position in an utterance and speaker age, gender, and social class (Rayson et al. 1997, Clark and Fox Tree 2002, Tottie 2011, inter alia). Building on such research, the present paper investigates social variation in the use of um and uh in the United States. In particular, the paper documents the results of two corpus-based investigations of women’s and men’s usage of um and uh demonstrating that, among the speakers represented in the corpora, women on the aggregate had a far higher ratio of um tokens to uh tokens (um/uh ratio) than did men. The first of the two corpora examined is a collection of 992 transcripts from three speed-dating events held for graduate students at an American university in 2005. In this corpus, women’s average um/uh ratio is more than 3. 5 times that of men. An analysis of gendered filler usage in the Switchboard Corpus (SWBC) yields a similar result: women’s average um/uh ratio in the SWBC is more than 2. 5 times that of men. Data from the SWBC likewise suggest that this general trend persists across age groups and major U. S. dialect regions and, furthermore, tends to hold for speakers regardless of the gender of their interlocutors. The SWBC also provides evidence suggesting that um is gaining currency relative to uh; i. e., that there is a linguistic change in progress whereby the use of um relative to uh is on the rise. It is noted that not all {{men and women in the}} <b>corpora</b> exhibit filler <b>usage</b> in line with the aggregate-level trends, and that gendered linguistic differentiation should not be assumed to be a direct reflection of gender per se (Eckert 1989).
