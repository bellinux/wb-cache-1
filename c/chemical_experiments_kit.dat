40|$|The blue bottle {{experiment}} {{was first introduced}} to the chemical education literature as a simple demonstration on kinetics. Its original formulation contains only glucose, NaOH and small amount of methylene blue. The solution turns blue when shaken and fades to colorless upon standing. This bluing/de-bluing cycle may be repeated and may be compared to blood colors in animal's respiratory cycle. Inspired by the blue bottle <b>experiment,</b> the colorful <b>chemical</b> bottle <b>experiment</b> <b>kit</b> was commercially developed in 2006. The kit is a versatile pedagogical tool, not only for physical chemistry but also for analytical, biological and organic chemistry. It also helps teaching concepts in scientific method and laboratory safety. This manuscript contains four parts, brief review on literature relating to the blue bottle experiment, description of the colorful <b>chemical</b> bottle <b>experiment</b> <b>kit,</b> pedagogical discussion of the experiments and preliminary evaluation from students.

Utility is designed to teach chemistry at elementary schools and secondary schools nonchemical focus. The kit secrets of nature provides supplies and chemicals with a guidebook for 100 safe science experiments. Complement is a small set of tools for independent work of pupils. These two sets can be used already at kindergarten and 1 st grade of primary school.
