40|$|Crossbred Hereford × Angus calves (n = 103) {{were used}} to {{determine}} the effect of early weaning on carcass and ribeye (longissimus muscle) characteristics of bulls and steers. Treatments were: 1) early-weaned (117 days of age) bulls, 2) early-weaned steers, 3) normal-weaned (220 days of age) bulls, and 4) normal-weaned steers. Cattle were harvested at 360 and 389 days of age. At 36 hours postmortem, carcass quality and <b>cutability</b> were measured. Ribeye steaks were aged 14 days and scored for color, Warner-Bratzler shear force, and sensory panel evaluations. Carcasses from early-weaned cattle had greater dressing percentages, heavier weights, greater fat thicknesses, and higher numerical USDA Yield Grades (lower <b>cutability).</b> They also had more marbling and greater USDA quality grades, but had similar longissimus color, shear force, and sensory panel scores, compared with those of normal-weaned cattle. Bulls had greater dressing percentages, but had similar carcass weights to steers. Bull carcasses had less fat thickness and greater ribeye areas, resulting in lower numerical USDA Yield Grades (higher <b>cutability)</b> than steers had. They also had less marbling, darker color, and lower USDA quality grades than steers did. Longissimus muscles from bulls were darker, had greater shear forces, and had lower sensory panel tenderness scores than those from steers. For early-maturing British-type cattle, early weaning is a viable management strategy to produce heavier, higher-quality carcasses than those of normal-weaned cattle. Carcasses from early-weaned cattle are fatter and have lower <b>cutability.</b> For a non-implant “natural” market, bulls could be an alternative for producing high-cutability carcasses. Steaks may be less tender, however, and pre-harvest management must be optimized to reduce dark-cutting carcasses...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The use {{of dietary}} fibre in bread {{products}} is increasing because of consumer demand for healthier products. However, {{an increase in}} dietary fibre level changes the rheological properties of the dough and also the quality properties of the final bread product. In this study, effects on dough and bread staling were followed after replacing 3 % of wheat flour by fibre-rich additives (fine durum, oat bran, rye bran and wheat bran). Free-standing and pan-baked loaves were baked to compare the influence of baking method and loaf shape. RESULTS: All additives increased dough stability, with oat bran giving the greatest stability and longest development time. Parameters measured during storage were distribution, migration and loss of water, <b>cutability,</b> crumbliness, firmness and springiness. Furthermore, amylopectin retrogradation and amylase-lipid complex formation were assessed. Oat bran provided similar or better results than the control for all staling parameters, while other additives gave no general improvements. <b>Cutability</b> reached a plateau when crumb firmness was ≥ 4 N. CONCLUSION: Small amounts of fibre-rich additives had a significant influence on staling. However, the baking method (free-standing or pan-baked bread) had {{a greater impact on}} staling than the additives, thus displaying the importance of the baking method. <b>Cutability</b> was found to be related to firmness.

40|$|Research has {{suggested}} that maternal under-nutrition may cause {{the development of a}} thrifty phenotype in the offspring, potentially resulting in greater adiposity and reduced muscle mass. These potential alterations in fat and muscle development could have lasting impacts on offspring growth, carcass characteristics, and meat quality. Thus, the objective of this research was to determine the influence of maternal energy status during mid-gestation on offspring carcass characteristics and meat quality. Results reveal that maternal energy status during mid-gestation may {{play an important role in}} the development of carcass characteristics of offspring. Reduced maternal energy status appears to have the potential to improve carcass <b>cutability</b> and, more importantly, improve the amount of intramuscular fat (marbling) relative to subcutaneous fat (backfat) in carcasses of the resulting offspring. Thus, maternal nutrition during mid-gestation could be a critical management period to maximize both offspring quality and <b>cutability.</b> Still, more research is necessary to evaluate how maternal energy status may impact other production aspects in beef cattle...|$|E

40|$|Concentration in {{the packing}} {{industry}} {{has resulted in}} 5 major packers processing over 75 percent of the cattle on feed. During the last cattle cycle, total cattle numbers declined {{at the same time}} packers were increasing chain speeds and increasing individual plant volumes. From 1987 through 1992 the cow herd did not expand, therefore, supplies of fed cattle were consumed easily by existing packing facilities. All packers participated in the cash market to some extent, but in order to guarantee sufficient supplies of fed cattle in short supply situations, packers fed their own cattle, actively contracted cattle, and created marketing agreements priced on a formula basis. Price discovery of fed cattle became more difficult as more cattle were sold on contract or formula. The cash price is used in determining formula pricing but as the volume of cash cattle traded becomes smaller in relation to the volume of formula cattle, price reporting may become more unreliable. Another trend which has evolved during the last cattle cycle is the practice of buying cattle on averages. Cattle of varying degrees of quality sell at basically one price. Average to below average cattle benefit from this practice, but high grading, high <b>cutability</b> cattle are less likely to receive full value. Consequently, the benefits of good breeding programs are masked by this process of selling on the average. Much research has been done to establish the value differences of <b>cutability.</b> Yield grades have been used for many years to denote muscling. As consumer preferences for more lean and less fat grow, the value of <b>cutability</b> becomes more important. Table 1 was compiled by Texas A 2 ̆ 6 M. This table shows the value of yield grade differences with 1 inch, 1 / 2 inch, and 1 / 4 inch of outside fat trim. As more product is sold on a closely trimmed basis, the value of one full point of yield grade increases. For example, at one inch of trim, the value improvement of a yield grade 2 choice steer is 2. 52 per cwt of carcass over a yield grade 3 choice steer or approximately 20. 00 per head on an 800 pound carcass. When cut to 1 / 4 inch specifications, the value differences is 3. 88 per cwt of carcass or 31. 00 per head...|$|E
40|$|Anti-staling agents with {{different}} mechanisms {{were added to}} a normal white wheat bread to investigate the relation between bread staling, amylopectin retrogradation and water-related properties (i. e. water content and distribution between crumb and crust). Bread was baked both as pan-baked and freestanding loaves. The anti-staling agents maltogenic alpha-amylase, distilled monoglyceride and lipase had a direct influence on starch retrogradation, whereas gluten and waxy wheat flour diluted the amylopectin content or changed the ratio between amylose and amylopectin. The degree of staling was measured as the firmness and springiness, together with two new methods, crumbliness and <b>cutability.</b> In addition, the degrees of amylopectin retrogradation and amylose-lipid complex formation were analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry, and the water content, water loss and water migration were measured. The addition of alpha-amylase improved most staling parameters, although the changes were not as large as expected. Furthermore, monoglyceride and lipase increased the formation of amylose-lipid complexes, but only lipase gave better results regarding the specific volume and firmness. Increased amylose-lipid complex formation was seen to increase water migration from crumb to crust. Adding 10 % waxy wheat flour appeared {{to lead to a}} slight overall improvement i. e. lower water migration and better <b>cutability.</b> Adding gluten or 3 % waxy wheat flour only improved the specific volume. The method of baking the loaves, i. e. freestanding or pan-baked, had a greater influence than the anti-staling agents, which shows that bread quality is not always improved by starch affecting anti-staling agents without process changes.

The yields were measured at two trim levels (. 30 and. 00 in.). Data were evaluated at constant age (426 d), carcass weight (714 lb), and marbling (Small 00) endpoints. At a constant age of 426 d, RP% was greater in carcasses from steers sired by Continental European breeds (Gb, Ch, Sa, Pz; 63. 3 to 65. 5 % at. 00 in. trim) than steers sired by British b reeds (Sh, HA; 60. 1 to 61. 0 %). Carcasses from Pm-sired steers had the highest RP% (69. 7 %) at the age-constant endpoint. Although carcasses were heavier (P<. 05) for Ch-sired than for Pm-sired steers, lean growth rate measured by RP trimmed to. 30 in. fat at 426 d, was similar for Ch- and Pm-sired steers.

40|$|Objective The growth, carcass {{and retail}} cut yield records on 1, 428 Hanwoo steers {{obtained}} through progeny testing were analyzed in this study, and their heritability and genetic {{relationships among the}} traits were estimated using animal models. Methods Two different models were compared in this study. Each model was fitted for different fixed class effects, date of slaughter for carcass traits and batch of progeny test live measurement traits, and a choice of covariates (carcass weight in Model 1 or backfat thickness in Model 2) for carcass traits. Results The differences in body composition among individuals were deemed being unaffected by their age at slaughter, except for carcass weight and backfat thickness. Heritability estimates of body size measurements were 0. 21 to 0. 36. Heritability estimates of retail cut percentage were high (0. 56 from Model 1 and 0. 47 from Model 2). And the heritability estimates for loin muscle percentage were 0. 36 from Model 1 and 0. 42 from Model 2, which were high enough to consider direct selection on carcass <b>cutability</b> traits as effective. The genetic correlations between body size measurements and retail cut ratio (RCR) were close to zero. But, some negative genetic correlations were found with chest girths measured at yearling (Model 1) or at 24 months of age or with chest widths. Loin muscle ratio (LMR) was genetically negatively correlated with body weights or body size measurements, in general in Model 1. These relationships were low close to zero but positive in Model 2. Phenotypic correlation between <b>cutability</b> traits (RCR, LMR) and live body size measurements were moderate and negative in Model 1 while those in Model 2 were all close to zero. Conclusion Therefore, the body weights or linear body measurements {{at an earlier age}} {{may not be the most}} desirable selection traits for exploitation of correlated responses to improve loin muscle or lean meat yield...|$|E

Zilpaterol hydrochloride was supplemented the last 20 d of the finishing period and withdrawn for 3 d before slaughter. Carcasses were selected based on carcass weight as well as predetermined USDA Yield grade categories. For tenderness evaluation, steaks from the strip loin, bottom round, and top round (n = 54 per subprimal) were aged for 14 or 21 d postmortem. Carcasses from ZH-fed steers had more (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) saleable yield than carcasses from control-fed steers. Additionally, ZH-fed steers had greater (P ≤ 0. 01) subprimal yield from the shoulder clod, strip loin, peeled tenderloin, top sirloin butt, bottom sirloin tri-tip, peeled knuckle, inside round, bottom round flat, eye of round, heel, and shank. Furthermore, ZH decreased (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) the total amount and percentage of bone and fat trim from the carcass. Moisture loss was not affected by ZH in LM or inside round steaks (P 3 ̆e 0. 05); however, ZH increased thawing loss (P = 0. 05) but reduced cooking loss (P = 0. 05) in bottom round steaks. Shear force values of LM and inside round steaks increased with ZH inclusion (P 3 ̆c 0. 01), but {{there was no difference in}} bottom round steaks (P 3 ̆e 0. 05). Steaks aged for 21 d had smaller (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) Warner-Bratzler shear force (WBS) values than 14 -d steaks from all 3 subprimals. Trained sensory panelists did not detect any differences (P 3 ̆e 0. 05) in sensory juiciness, tenderness, or flavor variables of LM or inside round steaks, except ZH steaks from the LM received smaller scores for sustained juiciness (P = 0. 01) and overall tenderness (P = 0. 04) than control steaks.

Consequently, the superiority of bulls over steers in performance and carcass <b>cutability</b> have been largely countered by the inferior carcass quality of bulls. Production of beef by bulls, therefore, has not been widely undertaken in the United States. Recent technological advances in meat processing may enhance bull beef quality. A review indicates that electrical stimulation of prerigor carcasses will improve tenderness and enhance lean color and marbling of beef. Improvement in tenderness by electrical stimulation was greatest when control samples had higher shear force requirements. High temperature, early postmortem carcass conditioning may also improve palatability characteristics of meat from bulls. Improvement in visual appeal and palatability of bull beef would certainly {{be in the best}} interest of the beef industry. The objective of this study was to examine postmortem treatments that could lead to improved meat quality of beef obtained from bulls. Methods studied were carcass electrical stimulation and high temperature conditioning...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} two {{different}} initial ages of fattening on the weight gain, feed intake and feed efficiency characteristics as well as carcass and non-carcass components of the native Eastern Anatolian Red cattle raised in Eastern region of Turkey were studied in this research. According to the age {{at the beginning of}} the fattening, 61 EAR male cattle was allocated into two age treatment groups named as group I (9 - 14 months of ages) and group II (17 - 22 months of ages). Total weight gain throughout the fattening was numerically greater in younger group compared with the elderly group, however, the difference was not statistically significant. Total dry alfalfa hay and concentrate intake as dry matter did not differ significantly between age groups. However, feed efficiency ratios were significantly (p< 0. 01) influenced by initial age of the fattening in favour of younger EAR cattle. Carcass <b>cutability</b> and yield grade values of the EAR cattle in group I did not differ significantly from those in group II. Overall results of the study revealed that as initial age of the fattening lowers, fattening performance and feed efficiency ratio of EAR male cattle improved, but, carcass quality traits were not adversely influenced...|$|E
40|$|Differences in carcass composition, <b>cutability,</b> {{economic}} {{value of the}} carcass and distribution of certain muscle groups, between bulls with secondary sexual characteristics (bulls(+)), those without (bulls(-)), and steers were investigated. Two carcass mass groups (250 - 300 and 301 - 350 kg) were compared. Five carcasses of either mass group were studied within each sex condition group. Bulls(+) had a higher meat percentage (P < 0 · 05) than bulls(-) or steers. They also had a lower bone percentage than steers (P < 0 · 05), but non-significant {{differences were found between}} bulls(+) and bulls(-) for bone percentage. Significant differences (P < 0 · 05) between sex condition groups were found for percentages of hindquarter, as well as for distribution of high-priced cuts. Steers had the most favourable distribution and bulls(+) the least favourable. Bulls(-) were intermediate. Masculinity significantly (P < 0 · 05) influenced the distribution of the chuck, neck, brisket and hind shin cuts, whilst mass had a significant effect on the percentage hind shin and percentage thin flank. It was found that the M. rhomboideus was the only muscle of those studied that was significantly affected by masculinity and it was concluded that this muscle could be used as an indicator of the masculinity of the carcass. The {{economic value}}s of the carcasses of steers, bulls without secondary sexual development and bulls with secondary sexual development differed non-significantly. © 1992. Articl...|$|E
40|$|The typical {{processes}} of beef carcass fabrication in Venezuela are anatomically described and the equivalence in cut nomenclature {{with that of}} México and United States is provided. Additionally, 910 carcasses were fabricated to assess yield (kg and percentages of carcass weight) in products (subprimals), subprimal groups of distinct commercial value (High, Medium, Low) and by-products (bone, fat trimmings) using mean values ± standard deviation (DE), coefficient of variation (CV) and range of values. Once the carcass is ribbed at the 5 th intercostal space, subprimals are obtained by deboning and dissecting the muscle masses (saw cutting is seldom used). In terms of yield, the top three (out of 18) individual subprimals were: Solomo Abierto (boneless Chuck Roll, 39. 1 ± 10. 88 kg; 14. 3 ± 2. 84 %), Costilla (bone-in Plate, 22 kg± 4. 15; 8. 12 ± 0. 88 %) and Solomo de Cuerito (boneless Rib and Loin, 21. 6 ± 3. 10 kg; 8. 0 ± 0. 59 %). <b>Cutability</b> values for High-Valued and Medium-Valued subprimal groups were 81. 5 ± 10. 3 kg (30. 2 ± 1. 43 %) and 67. 3 ± 14. 57 kg (24. 8 ± 3. 22 %), respectively; the latter showing the highest CV (13. 0 %). Fat trimmings were the most variable by-product (10. 1 ± 2. 84 %, CV = 28. 0 %).

40|$|We {{evaluated}} the interrelationships among carcass characteristics of steers and heifers selected from commercial feedlots for {{competition in the}} Beef Empire Days live and carcass contests. Because judging criteria are weighted heavily on <b>cutability,</b> the majority of cattle entered were trim and muscular. Within this highly selected group, heifer carcasses had larger ribeye areas, lower hot carcass weights, more ribeye area/ 100 lbs. of hot carcass weight, and {{a higher percentage of}} kidney-pelvic-heart fat than steers. However, steers graded USDA Choice or better 4 % more often than heifers. Ribeye area, ribeye area/ 100 lbs. of hot carcass weight, and percentage of kidneypelvic- heart fat increased as dressing percentage increased; however, 12 th rib fat thickness had no effect on dressing percentage. Percentage of carcasses grading USDA Choice or better tended to decrease with improved dressing percentage. As 12 th rib fat thickness increased, ribeye area and ribeye area/ 100 lbs. of hot carcass weight decreased whereas percentage of kidneypelvic- heart fat and hot carcass weight of steers increased. As 12 th rib fat thickness increased up to 0. 50 - 0. 59 inches, the percentage of cattle that graded low Choice or higher increased, but more finish did not result in further increase in percentage of low Choice or better. This study indicates that ribeye area is more closely related to economically important carcass characteristics in trim, muscular cattle than previously identified...|$|E
40|$|Opportunities {{to export}} high quality pork {{products}} to trade partners like Japan are economically favorable outlets for US pork producers. Domestic consumers also {{rely heavily on}} fresh pork appearance, especially color and marbling, to make initial and repeat purchasing decisions. Two studies were performed to elucidate novel ways to improve pork quality, specifically by altering the lipid profile and increasing intramuscular fat (i. m.). In experiment 1, forty individually reared barrows (100 kg ± 3 kg, PIC C 23 x 337) {{were randomly assigned to}} 1 of 5 treatments containing dried distillers grains with solubles and 3 percent added fat to determine the resulting carcass characteristics and fresh pork quality. The treatments included 1) a positive control containing a corn and soybean meal base with 3 percent choice white grease (PCON), 2) 30 percent high protein dried distillers grain and 3 percent choice white grease (HPDDG), or 30 percent DDGS with 3) no added fat (DDGS), 4) 3 percent choice white grease (DDGS + CWG), or 5) 3 percent butter oil (DDGS + BO). Postmortem carcasses characteristics and quality attributes were not different between diets (P greater than 0. 08) except the semimembranosus muscle from pigs fed HPDDGS had the most basic ultimate pH (P = 0. 01) suggesting pigs fed HPDDGS had less glycolytic potential at the time of slaughter. Including DDGS in the diet decreased (P less than 0. 01) MUFA and increased (P less than 0. 01) PUFA. Butter oil increased (P less than 0. 01) CLA content in fat, but did not increase SFA or iodine value. Although added fat in the diet altered fatty acid composition in multiple fat depots, adding additional saturated fat to the diet in the form of butter oil did not mitigate the unsaturation of DDGS. Skycis® (narasin, NAR) is a swine performance ionophore labeled to increase rate of gain in the last 4 weeks of the finishing phase. The objective of experiment 2 was to evaluate inclusion of NAR in pig diets and determine the source of carcass yield, specifically dressing percentage, improvements observed in previous studies. Barrows (n= 50) and gilts (n= 50) of PIC C 22 x 337 genetics were randomly assigned to a diet containing 0 or 15 ppm NAR initiated at 39. 5 kg of body weight and continued until slaughter. Barrows tended (P = 0. 09) to have heavier viscera, significantly (P less than 0. 01) more fat at the 10 th rib, and a greater (P = 0. 01) percentage of i. m. fat compared to gilts. Gilts were heavier muscled than barrows as evidenced by many gender differences (P less than 0. 05) observed in the <b>cutability</b> phase of the study, specifically larger LM (P less than 0. 01). Heavy muscled, lean animals such as gilts may have increased organ mass from up regulated metabolic activity, but pigs with greater intake will also have heavier intestinal tract compensating for the increased consumption suggesting barrows in this study ate more, especially late in the growth curve. Pigs fed NAR had heavier (P less than 0. 01) hearts, but few treatment differences were observed in carcass quality and <b>cutability.</b> In general, fat content increased and made up a larger percentage of total carcass weight in pigs fed NAR. The current results do not confirm the source of previously observed differences in DP in pigs fed NAR, but could be attributed to the tendency of NAR to increase carcass fatness...|$|E

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Rounds from twenty yield grade 2 and twenty yield grade 3 carcasses were dissected into <b>cutability</b> components of fat, lean, bone, and connective tissue. Subcutaneous fat, M. gluteobiceps, ishiatic head of M. gluteobiceps, and M. semitendinosus differed (P< 0. 05) between yield grades for percentage of initial round weights. M. rectus femoris, M. vastus lateralis, M. semimembranosus, M. adductor, M. gluteobiceps, ishiatic head of M. gluteobiceps, and M. semitendinosus were assigned randomly to one of four treatment groups: control, mechanical blade-tenderization, 2 % injection of the enzyme bromelain, or 10 % injection of salt/phosphate solution. Steaks (2. 54 cm) from each muscle were cooked by dry-heat and moist-heat methods. Warner-Bratzler shear force values differed (P< 0. 05) for M. rectus femoris and M. semimembranosus across treatment groups for both dry-heat and moist-heat cookery methods. These muscles also improved tenderness ranking among individual muscles for both cookery methods. M. semitendinosus displayed significantly lower shear values of moist-heat steaks compared to dry-heat for control and bromelain steaks. Percent moisture for phosphate treated steaks was significantly higher than all other treatments. Purge loss of individual muscles, number of steaks cut per muscle, steak yield, cook loss for both methods, and percent fat displayed no significant differences across treatment groups. These findings suggest individual muscles from the round can improve in tenderness through injection-type strategies. Bromelain and phosphate treatments in combination with moist-heat cookery methods can improve the quality of beef rounds...|$|E
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Animal Sciences and IndustryJohn A. UnruhForty-eight Brahman-cross male calves {{were fed}} to 26 mo {{of age and}} used to {{determine}} carcass <b>cutability</b> and meat quality characteristics of four muscles from intact bulls and steers castrated at 3, 7, or 12 mo of age grown under tropical pasture conditions. Longissimus lumborum (LL), Psoas major (PM), Gluteus medius (GM), and Semitendinosus (ST) steaks were aged for 2, 7, 14, or 28 d for Warner Bratzler shear force (WBSF) analysis. Live weight, carcass traits, and total subprimal yields were not affected by male sex condition. For PM, GM, and ST steaks, WBSF values were similar for steaks from intact bulls and steers castrated at all ages. For both PM and GM muscles, steaks aged for 28 d had the lowest (most tender) WBSF values and steaks aged for 2 d had the highest WBSF values. For the ST, WBSF values were highest for steaks aged 2 d. A treatment × aging interaction was detected for LL WBSF values. At 14 d of aging, LL steaks from steers castrated at 3 mo tended to have lower WBSF values than those from intact bulls. At 28 d of aging, steaks from steers had lower WBSF values than steaks from intact bulls and steaks from steers castrated at 3 mo tended to have lower WBSF values than steaks from steers castrated at 12 mo. For LL steaks from steers castrated at 3, 7 or 12 mo, WBSF values linearly decreased with increased days of aging. Although all sensory panel data collected were not statistically different, LL steaks from steers castrated at 3 mo tended to have higher (more tender) scores for overall tenderness than steaks from intact bull. This study indicates that castration at 3 mo would be the recommended production practice as it provided the greatest improvement of LL tenderness over intact bulls with no differences in carcass traits or subprimal yields. The degree of improvement in tenderness due to aging is muscle dependent...|$|E
