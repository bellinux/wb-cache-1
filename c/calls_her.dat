5|$|The {{scholars}} Pratapaditya Pal, {{an expert}} on South Asian art and H. Bhattacharya, author of Hinduder Debdebi {{on the subject of}} Hindu deities, equate Chhinnamasta with the concepts of sacrifice and the renewal of creation. Chhinnamasta sacrifices herself, and her blood– drunk by her attendants– nourishes the universe. One invocation to her <b>calls</b> <b>her</b> the sacrifice, the sacrificer, and the recipient of the sacrifice, with the severed head treated as an offering. This paradox signifies the entire sacrificial process, and thus the cycle of creation, dissolution, and re-creation.|$|E

5|$|Walter married Emma or Emmelina {{and they}} had three sons– Roger, Hugh and Walter. Roger was the heir to Weobley and Walter became Abbot of Gloucester Abbey. Occasionally the elder Walter is claimed to have married twice– once to Emma and once to an Ermeline, but this is {{probably}} a confusion of the variations of Emma's name. Walter and Emma also had a daughter who became a nun at St Mary's Abbey, Winchester. A niece was married to Ansfrid de Cormeilles. Considerable confusion exists about Sybil, the wife of Pain fitzJohn. C. P. Lewis names her {{as the daughter of}} Walter, but W. E. Wightman <b>calls</b> <b>her</b> the daughter of Hugh, Walter's son. Yet another pedigree has her as the daughter of Agnes, the daughter of Walter. In this rendition, favoured by Bruce Coplestone-Crow, Agnes was married to Geoffrey Talbot.|$|E

5|$|Fearing for Shae's safety, Tyrion {{breaks up}} with her and orders her to leave for Pentos. She refuses until he <b>calls</b> <b>her</b> a whore, and {{declares}} that she cannot have his children. Joffrey is poisoned to death at his wedding feast, and Cersei immediately accuses Tyrion. At his trial, Shae appears to testify against him, falsely claiming that Sansa refused to bed Tyrion unless he killed Joffrey.
