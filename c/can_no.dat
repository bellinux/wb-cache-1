5|$|Hydrogen cyanide is a {{poisonous}} gas that interferes with cellular respiration. Cyanide prevents the cell from producing adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by binding {{to one of}} the proteins involved in the electron transport chain. This protein, cytochrome c oxidase, contains several subunits and has ligands containing iron groups. The cyanide component of Zyklon B can bind at one of these iron groups, heme a3, forming a more stabilized compound through metal-to-ligand pi bonding. As a result of the formation of this new iron-cyanide complex, the electrons that would situate themselves on the heme a3 group <b>can</b> <b>no</b> longer do so. Instead, these electrons destabilize the compound; thus, the heme group no longer accept them. Consequently, electron transport is halted, and cells <b>can</b> <b>no</b> longer produce the energy needed to synthesize ATP. In a human weighing , death occurs within two minutes of inhaling 70mg of hydrogen cyanide.|$|E
