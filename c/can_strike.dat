5|$|The Queen of Somnia {{tells the}} Hero to {{discover}} who he really is. The quest leads {{the party to}} Arkbolt, where a terrible monster is blocking a nearby cave. The reward for defeating the monster is the famed Sunderbolt Blade, but before the party <b>can</b> <b>strike</b> the final blow, a warrior {{by the name of}} Terry kills the monster, winning the sword. After traveling both worlds, the party learns that Murdaw was not the only evil in the world, having fought several other monsters that all seem to be connected.|$|E
5|$|Though tornadoes <b>can</b> <b>strike</b> in an instant, {{there are}} {{precautions}} and preventative measures {{that people can}} take to increase the chances of surviving a tornado. Authorities such as the Storm Prediction Center advise having a pre-determined plan should a tornado warning be issued. When a warning is issued, going to a basement or an interior first-floor room of a sturdy building greatly increases chances of survival. In tornado-prone areas, many buildings have storm cellars on the property. These underground refuges have saved thousands of lives.|$|E

5|$|Evolve was Turtle Rock Studios' {{first major}} project {{after the company}} split from Valve Corporation in 2011. The concept for Evolve existed prior to the {{development}} of their previous game, Left 4 Dead. Inspired by hunting games such as Cabela's Big Game Hunter and Deer Hunter, the idea is to have prey that <b>can</b> <b>strike</b> back at the hunters. The monster design was originally intended to be esoteric but was later toned down. The game is powered by Crytek's CryEngine, as they believed that the engine is capable of creating the dark and dense forests featured in the game. Turtle Rock found difficulty when seeking publishers that could provide funding and marketing for the game. THQ was originally set to serve as the game's publisher, but the rights to the franchise and publishing duties were transferred to Take-Two Interactive after THQ filed for bankruptcy in late 2012.|$|E
5|$|Heat {{waves are}} a common feature of summers in the city. These heat waves place extra demand on {{electricity}} usage, leading to shortages. In extreme cases, these power shortages during heat waves can cause traffic jams and protests, such as the December 2013 heat wave (longest heat wave ever recorded in Buenos Aires) where increased energy demand lead to energy shortages and power cuts, protests against the government over the lack of service, and traffic jams {{as a result of}} these protests. However, most heat waves are of short duration (usually less than a week), and are followed by the passage of the cold, dry Pampero wind, which brings violent and intense thunderstorms with strong gusts and hail followed by cooler temperatures and lower humidity. Occasionally, a tornado can form, which <b>can</b> <b>strike</b> the city although most tornadoes are relatively weak and rarely cause deaths. The greatest risk for tornadoes occurs in the summer season due to the favourable conditions. These severe storms can damage cars, houses and disrupt public services such as transportation and collection and disposal of urban solid waste.|$|E
5|$|Unit {{prices have}} been readjusted and some units renamed, {{as well as new}} ones introduced. New land units include the Bike, a highly mobile {{infantry}} unit that can capture properties; the Flare, an armored vehicle unit that can reveal areas affected by the Fog of War; the Anti-Tank, an indirect-fire unit strong against tanks with the ability to counter-attack during direct attacks; and the War Tank (formerly the Mega Tank), the strongest ground unit in the game. New air units include the Duster, a weaker, lower-cost interceptor that <b>can</b> <b>strike</b> ground units; and the Seaplane, which is produced by Carriers and can attack any unit, but has limited ammo and fuel reserves. Additionally, there is a single new sea unit, the Gunboat, which is armed with a missile salvo that must be resupplied after each use, and can transport one infantry/mech unit. Also, the Battleship was given the ability to move and fire in the same turn, making it the only indirect-combat unit able to do so.|$|E

The court added that the violence done to the cadaver constituted a beginning to execute the murder. This interpretation does not correspond to the classic definition of beginning to execute; in no case <b>can</b> <b>striking</b> a cadaver lead directly or immediately or in the long term for that matter to the death of a human being.|$|R

25|$|Catan: Oil Springs is an {{expansion}} by Erik Assadourian and Ty Hansen introduced in 2011 designed {{to draw attention}} to environmental issues. It is offered as a free download or for purchase from the Mayfair Games website. The scenario adds oil fields {{that can be used to}} make other resources and develop metropolises, but disasters <b>can</b> <b>strike</b> if too much oil is used. Oil can also be taken out of the game, for victory points and to prevent disasters.|$|E
25|$|How far these snakes <b>can</b> <b>strike</b> {{has been}} controversial. Obviously this {{depends on the}} size of the animal, but other factors may also play a role, such as the species, the {{position}} of the body, and the degree of excitement. Additionally, the question of definition exists: from which point on the snake should a strike be measured: from the front, the middle, or the back of the anchor coil on the ground? Even if the length of the specimen is known, once it strikes, it is almost impossible to determine the limiting point reached by its head and the position of its body when the movement started. Therefore, it is not surprising that many conflicting statements can be found in the available literature about how far these snakes <b>can</b> <b>strike.</b> Estimates have been given that range from one-third of the body length, to half, three-quarters or even the full length of the animal. They rarely strike further than half of their body length, and almost never more than three-fourths, but that it is still not wise to trust such values if only because it is not possible to accurately judge the length of a coiled snake.|$|E

40|$|African Studies Seminar series.

Hopefully {{we will be able to}} tease out the strands of relationship between the essential components: between; prices, strikes and labour organisation. We should attempt to answer the following questions: are strikes basically the result of increases in the prices of essential commodities (particularly food); <b>can</b> <b>strikes</b> by African workers be seen as defensive action to re-establish real wages; how far does relative deprivation of Black workers result in trade union organisation and what are the optimum conditions for the formation and growth of African trade unions...|$|R
25|$|Typical of Central Texas, {{severe weather}} in Austin {{is a threat}} that <b>can</b> <b>strike</b> during any season. However, it is most common during the spring. According to most classifications, Austin lies within the extreme {{southern}} periphery of Tornado Alley, although many sources place Austin outside of Tornado Alley altogether. Consequently, tornadoes strike Austin less frequently than areas farther to the north. However, severe weather and/or supercell thunderstorms can occur multiple times per year, bringing damaging winds, lightning, heavy rain, and occasional flash flooding to the city. The deadliest storm to ever strike city limits was the twin tornadoes storm of May 4, 1922, while the deadliest tornado outbreak to ever strike the metro area was the Central Texas tornado outbreak of May 27, 1997.|$|E
