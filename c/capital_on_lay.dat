50|$|In the inscription, {{the author}} is named as Halparuntiyas, King of Gurgam, son of Laramas, {{grandson}} of Halparuntiyas, great-grandson of Muwatalli.... He declares his loyalty to the gods, especially Tarhunzas and Runtija, {{as well as his}} veneration of his ancestors, and then he describes his deeds. From the list of ancestors it is possible to identify the ruler as Halparuntiyas III, king of the Neo-Hittite kingdom of Gurgum, whose <b>capital</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> the location of modern Kahramanmaraş. The depiction of the ruler standing atop a lion probably indicates his posthumous divinisation, suggesting that the statue was made in or after the reign of Halparuntiyas III, {{at the end of the}} 9th century BC.|$|R

40|$|The {{estimation}} {{of the effect of}} local human <b>capital</b> <b>on</b> wages only might not identify properly human capital spillovers. Appropriate identification requires considering the joint effect of local human <b>capital</b> <b>on</b> both wages and rents. Empirically, we study the effects of local human <b>capital</b> <b>on</b> household-level rents and individual-level wages for a sample of Italian local labour markets. Our results show a positive and robust effect of local human <b>capital</b> <b>on</b> rents, supporting the idea that human capital generates positive externalities at the local level.

40|$|Lay {{health workers}} {{are key to}} {{achieving}} universal health-care coverage, therefore measuring worker attrition and identifying its determinants should {{be an integral part}} of any lay health worker programme. Both published and unpublished research <b>on</b> <b>lay</b> health workers has largely focused on the types of interventions they can deliver effectively. This is an imperative since the main objective of these programmes is to improve health outcomes. However, high attrition rates can undermine the effectiveness of these programmes. There is a lack of research <b>on</b> <b>lay</b> health worker attrition. Research that aims to answer the following three key questions would help address this knowledge gap: what is the magnitude of attrition in programmes? What are the determinants of attrition? What are the most successful ways of reducing attrition? With community-based interventions and task shifting high on the United Nations Millennium Development Goals’ policy agenda, research <b>on</b> <b>lay</b> health worker attrition and its determinants requires urgent attention...|$|R
