The subjects in this research were 289 subjects, with five ustaz or ustzah as expert professional judgment for takzim, two subjects of the representation of general people (non santri), four subjects of the representation santri for pre-eliminary try out and 185 subjects {{who participated in the}} fulfilling scale.

The inhabitants of the poverty-stricken region rely on subsistence farming, raising livestock and crops such as wheat and saffron. When the earthquake struck, much of the population was already working in the fields; for the most part, these people survived. Many of those treated for injuries were found to be undernourished.|$|E

While visitors would not have been able to climb the structure, they would have been able to walk through an entrance at its base. Chicago Sun-Times writer Lee Bey believed the bell tower to be the park's most important feature.

As with the other characters of Phineas and Ferb, Ferb's design is <b>constructed</b> <b>of</b> geometric shapes in homage to animator Tex Avery. Ferb's head is based on a rectangle with a wider top than bottom. A square is used for his nose, and an egg-shaped oval is used for his eyes. The eye furthest from the screen is always drawn larger than the other. Povenmire uses a nine-step process to draw Ferb, starting with his head and ending with touch ups.|$|E
5|$|In the König-class ships, each gun turret had {{a working}} chamber beneath it that was {{connected}} to a revolving ammunition hoist leading down to the magazine below. The turrets were electrically controlled, though the guns were elevated hydraulically. In {{an effort to reduce}} the possibility of a fire, everything in the turret was <b>constructed</b> <b>of</b> steel. This layout was also used in the preceding battleships. On the Derfflinger-class battlecruisers, the two forward and the superfiring rear turret used this configuration, although the rearmost gun turret had its magazine and shell room inverted.|$|E

In this example, one of their meanings is which <b>construct</b> <b>of</b> boredom the relationships among the data that fill variables in the statistical model identify. Because an instantiated quality data representation can become a “value” of an instance of the “quality data” slot in the <b>Construct</b> <b>of</b> Academic Boredom in Under-challenging situations or the <b>Construct</b> <b>of</b> Academic Boredom in Over-challenging situations, the quality data slot is originally defined in the “mathematical model” (shown in Fig.  5).

40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} how the Danish Health Authority’s discursive <b>construct</b> <b>of</b> {{obesity and}} health {{can be understood}} through perspectives of power and how this will {{have an effect on}} the understanding of health promotion.

Theories on health and power will also be incorporated in the understanding and analysis <b>of</b> the discursive <b>construct.</b> The thesis concludes that the discursive <b>construct</b> <b>of</b> health and obesity in the publication relies on the position of power science holds in contemporary society.
