40|$|Acid sphingomyelinase (aSMase) {{generates the}} {{bioactive}} lipid ceramide (Cer) from hydrolysis of sphingomyelin (SM). However, its precise roles in regulating specific sphingolipid-mediated biological processes remain ill defined. Interestingly, the aSMase gene {{gives rise to}} two distinct enzymes, lysosomal sphingomyelinase (L-SMase) and secretory sphingomyelinase (S-SMase) via alternative trafficking of a shared protein precursor. Previously, our laboratory identified Ser 508 as a crucial residue for the constitutive and regulated secretion of S-SMase in response to inflammatory cytokines, and demonstrated a role for S-SMase in formation of select cellular Cer species (Jenkins, R. W., Canals, D., Idkowiak-Baldys, J., Simbari, F., Roddy, P., Perry, D. M., Kitatani, K., Luberto, C., and Hannun, Y. A. (2010) J. Biol. Chem. 285, 35706 – 35718). In the present study using a chemokine/cytokine screen, we identified the chemokine CCL 5 (formerly known as RANTES) as a candidate-specific downstream target for aSMase. Regulation of CCL 5 by aSMase was subsequently validated using both loss-of-function and gain-of-function models indicating that aSMase is both necessary and sufficient for CCL 5 production. Interestingly, cells deficient in acid ceramidase (aCDase) also exhibited defects in CCL 5 induction, whereas cells deficient in sphingosine kinase- 1 and - 2 exhibited higher levels of CCL 5, suggesting that sphingosine and not sphingosine 1 -phosphate (S 1 P) {{is responsible for the}} positive signal to CCL 5. Consistent with this, co-expression of aSMase and aCDase was sufficient to strongly induce CCL 5. Taken together, these data identify a novel role for aSMase (particularly S-SMase) in chemokine elaboration by pro-inflammatory cytokines and highlight a novel and shared function for aSMase and aCDase.

40|$|Dormant spores of Bacillus subtilis exhibit two {{prominent}} X-ray scattering peaks. These peaks persisted in spores lacking most /-type small, acid-soluble protein or the CotE protein responsible for assembly of much spore coat protein, {{but they were}} absent from spores of strains lacking the late sporulation-specific transcrip-tion factor GerE. Spores of Bacillus species are formed {{in the process of}} sporu-lation and are metabolically dormant and extremely resistant to a variety of environmental stresses, including heat, radia-tion, toxic chemicals, and mechanical disruption (9, 23). Spore resistance is due to a number of factors, including (i) the protection of spore DNA by its saturation with a group of /-type small, acid-soluble spore proteins (SASP) that mark-edly alter DNA and chromosome structure; (ii) a low level of water in the spore’s central region or core; (iii) a high level of pyridine- 2, 6 -dicarboxylic acid (dipicolinic acid [DPA]) and its chelated divalent cations in the spore core (25 % of <b>core</b> <b>dr...</b>|$|E
40|$|We present high-angular-resolution {{observations}} of the massive star forming <b>core</b> <b>DR</b> 21 (OH) at 880 mum using the Submillimeter Array (SMA). The dense core exhibits an overall velocity gradient in a Keplerian-like pattern, which breaks {{at the center of}} the core where SMA 6 and SMA 7 are located. The dust polarization shows a complex magnetic field, compatible with a toroidal configuration. This is in contrast with the large, parsec-scale filament that surrounds the core, where there is a smooth magnetic field. The total magnetic field strengths in the filament and in the core are 0. 9 and 2. 1 mG, respectively. We found evidence of magnetic field diffusion at the core scales, far beyond the expected value for ambipolar diffusion. It is possible that the diffusion arises from fast magnetic reconnection in the presence of turbulence. The dynamics of the DR 21 (OH) core appear to be controlled energetically in equal parts by the magnetic field, magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence and the angular momentum. The effect of the angular momentum (this is a fast rotating core) is probably causing the observed toroidal field configuration. Yet, gravitation overwhelms all the forces, making this a clear supercritical core with a mass-to-flux ratio of ~ 6 times the critical value. However, simulations show that this is not enough for the high level of fragmentation observed at 1000 AU scales. Thus, rotation and outflow feedback is probably the main cause of the observed fragmentation. Comment: 16 pages, 12 figures, accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journa...|$|E

40|$|Purpose. To examine {{changes in}} health habits (sleep, alcohol, and exercise) {{and the effects}} of an {{educational}} intervention promoting self-care on the emotional and academic adjustment of first-year medical students. Method. Fifty-four medical students completed question-naires that assessed various health habits, alcohol use, de-pression severity, and areas of life satisfaction at the be-ginning of the semester, at mid-term, and at finals. Approximately half of the students received written feed-back or participated in an educational discussion group at mid-term. Results. The students demonstrated significant changes in health habits, with increases in alcohol consumption and decreases in exercise and socialization. The changes in health habits were predictive of both emotional and academic adjustment, with students who decreased in positive health habits, particularly socialization, being more depressed at finals. The feedback and educational interventions influenced some sleep and exercise behav-iors, but the groups did not differ in overall emotional or academic adjustment. Conclusions. First-year medical students show signifi-cant changes in health habits as they adjust to medical school. An educational intervention demonstrated prom-ising effects in changing these patterns, but self-care needs to be further elaborated to address the specific chal-lenges associated with acute adjustment as well as with long-term stressors.

The repertoire was characterized by peptide sequencing using a LTQ ion trap mass spectrometer coupled to a multidimensional liquid chromatography system. After validation of the spectra identification, the definition of the HLA-DR 8 peptide-binding motif was achieved from the analysis of 486 natural ligands, based on serial alignments of all possible HLA-DR-binding <b>cores.</b> The <b>DR</b> 8 motif showed a strong similarity with the peptide-binding motifs of other MHC class II diabetes-associated alleles, HLA-DQ 8 and H- 2 I-A(g 7).

Captain Picard prepares to flood the computer core with gamma radiation to remove the nanites completely, but the android Second Officer Commander Data (Brent Spiner) establishes communication with the nanites and allows them to use his body to speak with Picard. Picard realizes that the nanites are self-aware and conscious and took Dr. Stubbs' actions as hostile, but they want peace. Picard negotiates a deal to send the nanites to Kavis Alpha IV, designating it as their homeworld. The nanites agree and repair the damage to the computer core before they leave it. Dr. Stubbs launches his probe on time and collects numerous volumes of data. Ensign Crusher, who feels responsible for the incident, is counseled by his mother; both of them realizing he is growing up.|$|R
