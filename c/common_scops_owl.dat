40|$|Toxoplasma gondii is a {{zoonotic}} intracellular protozoan parasite {{of worldwide}} distribution that infects {{many species of}} warm-blooded animals, including birds. To date, there is scant information about the seropositivity of T. gondii and the risk factors associated with T. gondii infection in wild bird populations. In the present study, T. gondii infection was evaluated on sera obtained from 1079 wild birds belonging to 56 species (including Falconiformes (n = 610), Strigiformes (n = 260), Ciconiiformes (n = 156), Gruiformes (n = 21), and other orders (n = 32), from different areas of Spain. Antibodies to T. gondii (modified agglutination test, MAT titer $ 1 : 25) were found in 282 (26. 1 %, IC 95 %: 23. 5 – 28. 7) of the 1079 birds. This study constitute the first extensive survey in wild birds species in Spain and reports {{for the first time}} T. gondii antibodies in the griffon vulture (Gyps fulvus), short-toed snake-eagle (Circaetus gallicus), Bonelli’s eagle (Aquila fasciata), golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos), bearded vulture (Gypaetus barbatus), osprey (Pandion haliaetus), Montagu’s harrier (Circus pygargus), Western marsh-harrier (Circus aeruginosus), peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus), long-eared owl (Asio otus), <b>common</b> <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> (Otus scops), Eurasian spoonbill (Platalea leucorodia), white stork (Ciconia ciconia), grey heron (Ardea cinerea), common moorhen (Gallinula chloropus); in the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) ‘‘vulnerable’’ Spanish imperial eagle (Aquila adalberti), lesser kestrel (Falco naumanni) and great bustard (Otis tarda); and in the IUCN ‘‘near threatened’’ red kite (Milvus milvus). The highest seropositivity by species was observed in the Eurasian eagle owl (Bubo bubo) (68. 1 %, 98 of 144). The main risk factors associated with T. gondii seropositivity in wild birds were age and diet, with the highest exposure in older animals and in carnivorous wild birds. The results showed that T. gondii infection is widespread and can be at a high level in many wild birds in Spain, most likely related to their feeding behaviour...|$|E
2500|$|While late-19th-century ornithologists {{knew little}} of the {{variation}} of these birds which often live in far-off places, with every new taxon described a few differences between the Old and New World [...] "scops" [...] owls {{became more and more}} prominent.

50|$|The Socotra <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> was {{previously}} lumped with the African <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> Otus senegalensis but differences in plumage and vocalisations {{have led to}} it being split. Recent genetic research suggests that its closest relatives are the Oriental <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> and the Seychelles <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> Otus insularis. An interesting theory this research has led to is that the oriental <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> is a taxon which evolved from a colonisation of a continent from island ancestors, an event which had previously been thought unlikely because island taxa {{were thought to be}} less competitive than related continental taxa.|$|R

40|$|The {{avifauna}} of Indonesia {{is one of}} {{the richest}} in the World but the taxonomic status of many species remains poorly documented. The sole species of <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> known from Lombok has long been assigned to the widespread Moluccan <b>Scops</b> <b>Owl</b> Otus magicus on the basis of superficial similarities in morphology. Field work in 2003 has shown that the territorial song of the <b>scops</b> <b>owls</b> inhabiting the foothills of Gunung Rinjani differs dramatically from that of O. magicus and is more similar to those of Rufescent <b>Scops</b> <b>Owl</b> O. rufescens and Singapore <b>Scops</b> <b>Owl</b> O. cnephaeus. Detailed comparisons of sound recordings and museum specimens with those of other <b>scops</b> <b>owls</b> in Wallacea and the Indo-Malayan region have confirmed the distinctiveness of the Lombok population. We describe Otus jolandae as a new species, the Rinjani <b>Scops</b> <b>Owl.</b> It is locally common at elevations from 25 - 1350 m and occurs within Gunung Rinjani National Park. The new species is known from seven specimens collected by Alfred Everett in 1896. Otus jolandae represents the first endemic bird species from Lombok...|$|R

30|$|The {{natural enemies}} of Elegant <b>Scops</b> <b>owls</b> include {{various kinds of}} snakes. Because of {{cultural}} taboos, the Tao people do not hunt for, encroach on, or interfere with Elegant Scops owls; therefore, the indigenous people on Orchid Island are {{not a threat to}} the survival of Elegant <b>Scops</b> <b>owls.</b> However, the number of Elegant <b>Scops</b> <b>owls</b> is low, and they are listed as endangered. After an in-depth analysis of the reason for this, it was determined that the low number of Elegant <b>Scops</b> <b>owls</b> is highly associated with tourism activities. The impacts of tourism activities on Elegant <b>Scops</b> <b>owls</b> are derived from four aspects, including habitat destruction, roadkill, light exposure, and the loss of taboo, each of which is described in the following sections.|$|R

50|$|This {{species is}} very similar to the {{slightly}} larger partially migratory collared <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> Otus lettia and the oriental <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> Otus sunia. They can be separated on call and eye colour.|$|R
40|$|Breeding {{timing is}} one of the key life-history traits {{considered}} to be under strong stabilizing selection, such that offspring should be born when food resources are most abundant. Predation, however, may also affect the breeding timing because nest predation is a leading mortality for many species, although this possibility has been less considered. Here, we examined the possible effects of nest predation on breeding timing by comparing sympatric <b>scops</b> <b>owls</b> in a subtropical forest where only reptilian predators are present. The Japanese <b>Scops</b> <b>Owl</b> (Otus semitorques Temminck and Schlegel, 1844), a dietary generalist, bred one month earlier than the specialist Ryukyu <b>Scops</b> <b>Owl</b> (Otus elegans (Cassin, 1852)). The breeding timing of the Ryukyu <b>Scops</b> <b>Owl</b> matched with the emergence of their main prey species, but also matched with predator activity. Accordingly, the predation rate on eggs or nestlings was 7. 5 times higher in the Ryukyu <b>Scops</b> <b>Owl</b> (13. 9 %; 21 out of 150 nests) than in the Japanese <b>Scops</b> <b>Owl</b> (1. 9 %; 1 out of 52 nests). Clutch size, on the other hand, was significantly larger in the Ryukyu <b>Scops</b> <b>Owl</b> than in the Japanese <b>Scops</b> <b>Owl,</b> possibly compensating loss from predation. Although alternative explanations still remain, our results suggest that the food generalist might have adjusted its breeding timing to avoid nest predation, whereas the breeding timing of the specialist might have been constrained by the availability of its main prey items...|$|R
