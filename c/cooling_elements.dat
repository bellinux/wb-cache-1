40|$|Modern furnace designs often {{incorporate}} {{extensive use}} of <b>cooled</b> <b>elements</b> to achieve long campaign lives at high operating intensities. However, contact between water and high temperature fluids can result in powerful Boiling Liquid Expanding Vapour Explosions (BLEVEs). Therefore <b>cooling</b> such <b>elements</b> with water carries inherent risks when used under slag and particularly below molten metal or matte. Alternative cooling media exist that can reduce or eliminate the risk of BLEVEs. These media are analysed and discussed {{in the context of}} deeply <b>cooled</b> furnace <b>elements.</b> Important factors in selecting alternative coolants are explored including: critical heat flux, thermal limits, toxicity, flammability, unit cost, etc. Key cooling system design criteria are reviewed in the context of both traditional and alternative coolants.

50|$|An air handler, or air {{handling}} unit (often abbreviated to AHU), is a device used to regulate and circulate air {{as part of a}} heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) system. An air handler is usually a large metal box containing a blower, heating or <b>cooling</b> <b>elements,</b> filter racks or chambers, sound attenuators, and dampers. Air handlers usually connect to a ductwork ventilation system that distributes the conditioned air through the building and returns it to the AHU. Sometimes AHUs discharge (supply) and admit (return) air directly to and from the space served without ductwork.|$|E

5000|$|Conventional cooling {{techniques}} all attach their “cooling” {{component to}} the outside of the computer chip package. This “attaching” technique will always exhibit some thermal resistance, reducing its effectiveness. The heat can be more efficiently and quickly removed by directly cooling the local hot spots of the chip, within the package. At these locations, power dissipation of over 300 W/cm2 (typical CPU is less than 100 W/cm2) can occur, although future systems are expected to exceed 1000 W/cm2. [...] This form of local cooling is essential to developing high power density chips. This ideology has led to the investigation of integrating <b>cooling</b> <b>elements</b> into the computer chip. Currently there are two techniques: micro-channel heat sinks, and jet impingement cooling.|$|E
50|$|An {{interesting}} {{characteristic of}} commercially made ice cubes {{is that they}} are completely clear, lacking the clouding found in the center of domestically made ice cubes. Cloudy ice cubes result when water is frozen quickly, or when the water is high in dissolved solids. When water is cooled to its freezing point, and ice starts to form, dissolved gases can no longer stay in solution and come out as microscopic bubbles. However, as ice floats in water, once there is enough ice to form a layer on the surface, the ice layer traps all bubbles within the ice cube. Commercial ice-makers use a flowing source of purified water to make ice with <b>cooling</b> <b>elements</b> at the bottom, allowing the bubbles to be washed away from the top as the cube grows.|$|E

Typically, full reserve must be provided within 30 seconds, proportionally to the frequency deviation. Thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs) are a common class of loads studied for offering ancillary services and more specifically PFC. A typical TCL is a load controlled by a thermostat, which keeps temperature within a deadband by switching on or off its heating or <b>cooling</b> <b>element.</b>|$|R

40|$|Semi-closed {{greenhouse}} management {{may increase}} greenhouse productivity. However, {{it relies on}} the application of mechanical cooling. Cooling can be applied from above or below the canopy. The positioning of the cooling affects the vertical climate profile in the canopy. In order to determine how this affects the vertical profile of transpiration and crop temperature, in this work we used the energy balance of different crop layers to develop a modified “big leaf” model for its temperature and transpiration. The model was validated with data from a large greenhouse experiment (tomato) where the position of <b>cooling</b> <b>elements</b> and climate set-points ensured different vertical profiles of air properties. In particular, we had the combination of two positions of <b>cooling</b> <b>elements</b> (above and below the crop) and two temperature set-points; and a control (not cooled and naturally ventilated) compartment. For the validation we used measurements of crop temperature at different heights in the canopy and of transpiration of the whole crop. Finally we used the model to determine and discuss {{the effect of the}} various types of air conditioning on the vertical profile of transpiration within the crop. The compartment with natural ventilation had the highest simulated transpiration (which agreed with the measurements) and the largest uniformity of distribution of transpiration among layers. The least homogeneous distribution was with the <b>cooling</b> <b>elements</b> below, which had also the smallest total transpiration, which was 95 % of the transpiration of the crop cooled from above...|$|E
