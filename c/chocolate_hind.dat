40|$|Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province, China [2011 J 01244]The {{complete}} mitochondrial (mt) genome of the <b>chocolate</b> <b>hind</b> Cephalopholis boenak {{was obtained}} in this study, {{which is the}} first complete mitogenome in the genus Cephalopholis. The circular mtDNA molecule was 16 771 bp in size and the overall nucleotide composition of the H-strand was 29. 58 % A, 27. 36 % T, 15. 84 % G, and 27. 22 % C, with an A + T bias. The complete mitogenome encoded 13 protein-coding genes, 2 rRNAs, 22 tRNAs and 1 control region (D-loop), with the gene arrangement and translation direction basically identical to other typical vertebrate mitogenomes. The control region located between the tRNA(Pro) and tRNA(Phe) genes and the length was 1 064 bp, rich in A + T (70. 11 %); it was composed of 13 complete continuity tandem repeat units, 5 '-TACATATCTATGTACTTAA- 3 ', and one imperfect tandem repeat...|$|E
40|$|The <b>chocolate</b> <b>hind,</b> Cephalopholis boenak, is a {{relatively}} small grouper, attaining a maximum standard length (SL) of 215 mm. The females mature at 80 mm SL and aged one year or less, if increments in sagittal otoliths form annually. Based on gonadal histology, this species {{was determined to be}} a diandric protogynous hermaphrodite with two possible pathways of male development, although all testes were similar in morphology. Crypts of spermatogenic cells may be present at all female developmental stages and sex change from female to male occurs at between 100 and 150 mm SL (ages one to four years). Spawning season for this species, around Hong Kong, is from April to October, as indicated both by the gonadosomatic index (GSI) and histological examination of gonads. Half of all specimens sampled from local municipal markets were small and young, between 112 mm and 142 mm SL (ages two to four years). Sectioned sagittal otoliths suggested that sampled fishes ranged from 0 to 11 years, although most fishes taken in the fishery are below age five years. The von Bertalanffy growth-curve parameters were, provisionally, L∞ = 147. 66 mm SL, K = 0. 49 and t 0 = - 1. 52 years. Fisheries management should be applied to this last remaining commercially important local grouper in the Hong Kong market. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|The <b>chocolate</b> <b>hind,</b> Cephalopholis boenak, is the {{smallest}} and last remaining grouper of any abundance in Hong Kong waters. We investigated its habitat association and social structure to understand its sexual pattern and seek possible approaches to protect this species. Juveniles and adults are distributed in the same habitat and strongly associated with corals, in particular, Pavona decussata when available, for settlement and residence. Social groups of C. boenak are relatively small with a single male, one or two smaller females, and varying numbers of sexually inactive individuals (which are mature but sexually inactive, or juvenile). Males defend their boundaries by chasing neighbouring males and have significantly larger home ranges than females. Males visit females and sexually inactive individuals at one or more specific locations, consistently following similar paths. There was a positive linear correlation between body size and home range in individuals ≥ 90 mm TL. We observed male courtship in the reproductive season, within his home range during the late afternoon. Spawning behaviour is not associated with any particular moon phase and may occur more than once within the reproductive season. Although C. boenak is a diandric, protogynous hermaphrodite, primary and secondary males could not be distinguished by behavioural patterns in the field. Population management of this species should include habitat protection. © Springer 2005. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
