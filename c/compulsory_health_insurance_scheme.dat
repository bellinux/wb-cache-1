40|$|European {{health care}} systems are in process of {{profound}} reconstruction. In many countries, one can notice various attempts to reduce the package of public services and to increase the private contributions of benefi ciaries. This development is often considered as retreat {{of the concept of}} solidarity, which meant both a benevolent attitude toward weaker groups in society and a commitment to fair or even egalitarian distribution of health care ser-vices (Houtepen and ter Meulen, 2000). The concept of solidarity provided for a long time the ideological rationale for the transfer of fi nancial contri-butions by individuals by way of <b>compulsory</b> <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>schemes</b> or national taxation to a universal health care system that should guarantee equal access to health care for those who are in need. The concept of soli-darity was rooted fi rmly in European culture refl ecting a mixture of various philosophical, religious, and cultural traditions, particularly Christian social ethics and social democratic ideology. It meant a strong responsibility of society for the needs of the individual in relation to health and welfare. Since the end of the 1980 s in the last century, solidarity, and the health care system based on it, has come under severe criticism: the rising costs of care made it increasingly diffi cult to maintain universal access to all kinds of medical services for free. From that moment on, various strategies have been devised to limit the collective responsibility of society for the health needs of the individual.

40|$|Securing {{resources}} for {{primary health care}} (PHC) involves consideration of the entire health sector: the higher levels of the health service {{as well as the}} primary level, and the private and/or social security sub-sectors as well as the government service. Reshaping resource distribution is less a redistribution of existing resources than the allocation of new resources in accordance with PHC priorities. In this the planning of future current costs is a crucial element and requires a budgetary system that identifies expenditures by geographical area and level of care. Resources should be allocated geographically to reduce health care inequalities through the provision of an appropriate mix of different levels of care. Central resource planning and local health care programming (with 'dialogue' between the two) should be the basic planning division of labour, which largely resolves the so-called topdown /bottom-up dichotomy. The private medical sub-sector exerts economic, ideological and political influences on the public <b>health</b> service. <b>Compulsory</b> <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>schemes</b> can have some similar effects. Success of a PHC policy requires that governments adopt a holistic approach to the health sector. The allocation of health care resources on the bases of need and equity, as opposed to demand, is a political decision. The establishment of a national PHC policy backed up by adequate resources involves a specific politico-technical exercise with four components: research, planning, policy formulation, and government policy decision-making. The resource planning method, based on social epidemiology, is contrasted with conventional health planning methods, based on epidemiology. The articulation of these two approaches is discussed in terms of WHO's Managerial Process for National Health Development. Examples are quoted from Zimbabwe. ...|$|R

A thesis {{submitted}} to the Masters Program in Family Medicine, Postgraduate Program, Universitas Sebelas Maret, Surakarta. 2008. Payment method may influence the behavior of doctors, as such it may affect efficiency, quality of health services, and population health status. In the UU No 40 / 2004 on National Social Security System (SJSN), the government aims to develop the role of family doctors. Accordingly {{there is a need}} to investigate the most appropriate method of payment to the doctors. This study aimed to investigate the effect of payment method to the family doctors on cost-efficiency and quality of health care. This study was analytic using cross-sectional design. The study was conducted in Surakarta municipality and Sukoharjo district, from October to November 2007. The target population was family doctors and participants of the <b>compulsory</b> <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>scheme</b> of PT Askes. The indepndent variable under study were capitation method for paying doctors’ fee with or without drug cost. The dependent variables included cost per member per month, cost-effectiveness ratio, referal per visit ratio, and the quality of health care. This study collected primary data using a pre-tested questionnaire and secondary data available at the PT Askes office. The data was analyzed by t test and Mann-Whitney, which were run under SPSS v. 15. Results of the study showed that there was no statistically signficant difference between capitation method for paying doctors’ fee with and without drug cost on cost per member per month (p= 0. 940), cost-effectiveness ratio (p= 0. 604), referal per visit ratio (p= 0. 148), and the quality of health care (p= 0. 073). This tsudy concludes that there is no significant difference between capitation method for paying doctors fee with and without drug cost on performance measures such as efficiency and quality of health care. It is suggested that further studies with similar topic be continued using longer time and larger sample size. Key words: payment method, family doctor, cost-efficiency, quality of health care...|$|E

In the context of socio-medical research into working life patterns, the health-related consequences of gainful employment and interruptions in it (research into causes of sickness), the consequences of impaired health on the course of working life, (research into the consequences of sickness) as well as interactions between career progression and poor health are examined. Using a progression perspective makes it possible in these analyses {{to take into account}} the progressions of illnesses and chronicity processes, to recognise selection effects (e. g. so-called healthy and unhealthy worker effects) and to demonstrate risk accumulation as well as processes of weakening, increasing disability and stabilisation, all of which remain invisible in studies based on cross-sectional data. Agood data basis for many issues, especially in socio-medical research into the pattern of working life, is the personal data of insured members and their benefits recorded by the compulsory health insurance companies (<b>compulsory</b> <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>scheme</b> data) which accumulates continuously in the course of the administrative processes. This data not only includes progression- related details concerning periods of incapacity for work, stays in clinics and diagnoses, but over and above that also documents important events in the course of working life for the members of health insurance schemes on a longitudinal basis exact to the day. In this article a number of possibilities are shown for analysing relationships between sickness and the course of working life on the basis of health insurance data and these are illustrated using examples of empirical research results. Furthermore the strengths and weaknesses of the information contained in health insurance scheme data for various questions concerning research into the patterns of working life are discussed. Additionally reference is made to some parallels and differences between health insurance scheme data and the microdata from the employment statistics of the Public Employment Service, in particular of the IAB employment sample, as sources of data for the research into the patterns of working life.

Undoubtedly the dominant issue in the Dutch health care system at present is the fundamental reform that came into effect in 2006. With the introduction of a single <b>compulsory</b> <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>scheme,</b> the dual system of public and private insurance for curative care became history. Managed competition for providers and insurers became a major driver in the health care system. This has meant fundamental changes in the roles of patients, insurers, providers and the government. Insurers now negotiate with providers on price and quality and patients choose the provider they prefer and join a health insurance policy which best fits their situation. To allow patients to make these choices, much effort has been made to make information on price and quality available to the public. The role of the national government has changed from directly steering the system to safeguarding the proper functioning of the health markets. With the introduction of market mechanisms in the health care sector and the privatization of former sickness funds, the Dutch system presents an innovative and unique variant of a social health insurance system. Since the stepwise realization of the blueprint of the system has not yet been completed, the health care system in The Netherlands should be characterized as being in transition. Many measures have been taken to move from the old to the new system as smoothly as possible. Financial measures intended to prevent sudden budgetary shocks and payment mechanisms have been (and are) continuously adjusted and optimized. Organizational measures aimed at creating room for all players to become accustomed to their new role in the regulated market. As the system is still a "work in progress", it is too early to evaluate the effects and the consequences of the new system in terms of accessibility, affordability, efficiency and quality. Dutch primary care, with gatekeeping GPs at its core, is a strong foundation of the health care system. Gatekeeping GPs are a relatively unusual element in social health insurance systems. The strong position of primary care is considered to prevent unnecessary use of more expensive secondary care, and promote consistency and coordination of individual care. It continues to be a policy priority in The Netherlands. The position of the patient in The Netherlands is strongly anchored in several laws concerning their rights, their relation to providers and insurers, access to information, and possibilities to complain in case of maltreatment. In terms of quality and efficiency of the health care system, The Netherlands is, with some notable exceptions (e. g. implementation of innovations such as day surgery and electronic patient records), an average performer when compared to other wealthy countries. It is too early to tell whether efficiency and quality gains will occur as a result of the 2006 reform...|$|E

This paper examines the challenges faced and an acceptable delivery system amid Hong Kong's rapidly ageing population. Challenges: The elderly population {{is expected to increase}} to 'one in four' in 2033. The elderly inpatient ratio is expected to be 62 % in 2029. Aging people highly rely on the public healthcare service, resulting in long waiting queue in popular healthcare service. The healthcare system over-emphasizes curative care. Aging people seek primary care for cure rather than health maintenance. Even though the government provides Elderly Health vouchers, only people aged 70 or above are eligible. Besides, only 16. 1 % claimed to use the subsidies in preventive care. Strategies: Healthcare policy should emphasize disease prevention and active aging. Primary care with multidisciplinary approach should be implemented to address the holistic care. Integrative Elderly Care Centre should be developed to link up all healthcare providers to promote seamless transfer of elders to different levels of care. Public-private partnership combines resources in the public and private sectors. The public sector can purchase from the private sector some elderly healthcare services in high demand, such as dialysis, to shorten the waiting queue. Elderly Health Care Voucher Scheme should offer to the older people aged 65 or above. Elderly Health Care Voucher Scheme specified on preventive care and health screening could promote the preventive care.

40|$|Background: As the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) gears toward full {{regional}} integration by 2015, the cross-border mobility {{of workers and}} citizens at large is expected to further intensify in the coming years. While ASEAN member countries have already signed the Declaration on the Protection and Promotion of the Rights of Migrant Workers, the health rights of migrants {{still need to be}} addressed, especially with ongoing universal health coverage (UHC) reforms in most ASEAN countries. This paper seeks to examine the inclusion of migrants in the UHC systems of five ASEAN countries which exhibit diverse migration profiles and are currently undergoing varying stages of UHC development. Design: A scoping review of current migration trends and policies as well as ongoing UHC developments and migrant inclusion in UHC in Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand was conducted. Results: In general, all five countries, whether receiving or sending, have schemes that cover migrants to varying extents. Thailand even allows undocumented migrants to opt into its <b>Compulsory</b> Migrant <b>Health</b> <b>Insurance</b> <b>scheme,</b> while Malaysia and Singapore are still yet to consider including migrants in their government-run UHC systems. In terms of predominantly sending countries, the Philippines's social <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> provides outbound migrants with portable insurance yet with limited benefits, while Indonesia still needs to strengthen the implementation of its compulsory migrant insurance which has a <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> component. Overall, the five ASEAN countries continue to face implementation challenges, and will need to improve on their UHC design in order to ensure genuine inclusion of migrants, including undocumented migrants. However, such reforms will require strong political decisions from agencies outside the health sector that govern migration and labor policies. Furthermore, countries must engage in multilateral and bilateral dialogue as they redefine UHC beyond the basis of citizenship and reimagine UHC systems that transcend national borders. Conclusions: By enhancing migrant coverage, ASEAN countries can make UHC systems truly ‘universal’. Migrant inclusion in UHC is a human rights imperative, and it is in ASEAN's best interest to protect the health of migrants as it pursues the path toward collective social progress and regional economic prosperity...|$|R
40|$|Australia has a national, <b>compulsory</b> and {{universal}} <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>scheme,</b> called Medicare. In 1996 the Government changed the Medicare Benefit Schedule Book {{in such a}} way as to create different financial incentives for consumers or producers of out-of-hospital private psychiatric services, once an individual consumer had received 50 such services in a 12 -month period. The Australian Government introduced a new Item (319) to cover some special cases that were affected by the policy change. At the same time, the Commonwealth introduced a 2 ̆ 7 fee-freeze 2 ̆ 7 for all medical services. The purpose of this study is two-fold. First, it is necessary to describe the three policy interventions (the constraints on utilization, the operation of the new Item and the general 2 ̆ 7 fee-freeze 2 ̆ 7.) The new Item policy was essentially a mechanism to 2 ̆ 7 dampen 2 ̆ 7 the effect of the 2 ̆ 7 constraint 2 ̆ 7 policy, and these two policy changes will be consequently analysed as a single intervention. The second objective is to evaluate the policy intervention in terms of the (stated) Australian purpose of reducing utilization of psychiatric services, and thus reducing financial outlays. Thus, it is important to separate out the different effects of the three policies that were introduced at much the same time in November 1996 and January 1997. The econometric results indicate that the composite policy change (constraining services and the new 319 Item) had a statistically significant effect. The analysis of the Medicare Benefit (in constant prices) indicates that the 2 ̆ 7 fee-freeze 2 ̆ 7 policy also had a statistically significant effect. This enables separate determination of the several policy changes. In fact, the empirical results indicate that the Commonwealth Government underestimated the 2 ̆ 7 savings 2 ̆ 7 that would arise from the 2 ̆ 7 constraint 2 ̆ 7 policy...|$|R
