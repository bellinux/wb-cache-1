30|$|The use of Pmcf hold is {{restricted}} to mechanically ventilated and sedated patients with a central venous catheter. The procedure of the inspiratory hold maneuvers is not yet automated and requires a direct link between monitor and ventilator, or advanced monitor analytics to detect the inspiratory holds and to perform the instantaneous CO calculations.

This method is not suitable to measure rapid changes in hemodynamic status since it takes {{a couple of minutes}} to perform the multiple end-inspiratory (and end-expiratory) holds. Potentially, this technique is operator-dependent because a proper inspiratory plateau pressure is needed. CVP can be altered due to incorrect catheter placement. An absolute <b>CO</b> <b>value</b> is not necessary for Pmcf hold as the technique extrapolates to zero CO. If the trend measurements are accurate, the RVR slope might change, but the intersection Pmcf point remains constant.

METHODS: CO was determined {{at the end}} of diagnostic or interventional cardiac catheterization for congenital heart defects. Standard ECG surface electrodes were attached in a vertical direction to the patients' left middle and lower neck, and lower thorax {{at the level of the}} heart and xiphoid process. Aesculon CO data were compared with a simultaneously measured CO by the subxiphoidal Doppler flow measurement technique. For each patient, measurements were repeated three times within 5 min.

Group 1 included patients referred to an oral medicine unit, whereas group 2 was recruited from the daily outpatient service. All patients filled in a standardized questionnaire regarding their current and former smoking habits. Additionally, exhaled CO levels were measured using a monitor. A total of 121 patients were included in group 1, and 116 patients were included in group 2. The mean <b>value</b> of exhaled <b>CO</b> was 7. 6 ppm in the first group and 9. 2 ppm in the second group. The mean <b>CO</b> <b>values</b> did not statistically significantly differ between the two groups. The two exhaled CO level measurements taken for each patient exhibited very good correlation (Spearman's coefficient of 0. 9857). Smokers had a mean difference of exhaled <b>CO</b> <b>values</b> of 13. 95 ppm (p < 0. 001) compared to non-smokers adjusted for the first or second group. The consumption of one additional pack year resulted in an increase in <b>CO</b> <b>values</b> of 0. 16 ppm (p = 0. 003). The consumption of one additional cigarette per day elevated the CO measurements by 0. 88 ppm (p < 0. 001).

30|$|Indeed, the CO is a main {{determinant}} of DO 2 and as such, should be monitored in severely ill patients.

In addition, the CO has a few significant limitations. The optimal CO in an individual patient is difficult to determine, a ‘normal’ or even high CO does not preclude the presence of inadequate tissue perfusion, a low <b>CO</b> <b>value</b> does not {{tell us what to}} do (fluids? inotropes?). Finally, in and by itself, the CO does not predict FR [52].

We also evaluated the effect of ventilation (mechanical and spontaneous) on the measurement of CO by the two methods. Forty-six post-OPCAB patients were studied at five predefined time points during controlled ventilation and at five time points when breathing spontaneously. A total of 230 data pairs of CO were obtained. During controlled ventilation, TD <b>CO</b> <b>values</b> ranged from 2. 29 to 6. 74 L/min (mean 4. 45 &# 177; 0. 85 L/min), while TEB <b>CO</b> <b>values</b> ranged from 1. 70 to 6. 90 L/min (mean 4. 43 &# 177; 0. 94 L/min). The average correlation (r) was 0. 548 (P = 0. 0002), accompanied by a bias of 0. 015 L/min and precision of 0. 859 L/min. In spontaneously breathing patients, TD <b>CO</b> <b>values</b> ranged from 2. 66 to 6. 92 L/min (mean 4. 66 &# 177; 0. 76 L/min), while TEB <b>CO</b> <b>values</b> ranged from 3. 08 to 6. 90 L/min (mean 4. 72 &# 177; 0. 82 L/min).

The {{purpose of this study}} was to estimate the magnitude of {{air pollution}} exposure based on environmental carbon monoxide (CO) measures and assessment of 1 -hydroxypyrene (1 -OHP), a metabolite of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), among school-aged HIV-infected and uninfected children in peri urban Kenya and to examine the impacts of these exposures on neurodevelopment. Methods: We conducted a cross sectional study of 49 HIV uninfected unexposed (HUU) and 45 HIV infected children ages 5 - 9 and their caregivers in Nairobi, Kenya. We used a battery of neurodevelopmental tests to assess function in 9 domains. Caregiver 24 -h personal CO exposure was a proxy for child exposure, and measured child urinary 1 -OHP. Results: Mean 24 -h CO exposure was 8. 15 ± 13. 46 ppm and mean urine 1 -OHP was 0. 81 ± 0. 60 µmol/mol creatinine. Overall, 39. 4 % of children had mean CO exposure >WHO recommended levels. Among HIV-infected children, <b>CO</b> <b>value</b> was associated with lower function in 2 of the 9 neurodevelopmental domains (nonverbal intelligence (β= - 0. 28, p= 0. 08) and executive function (β= - 0. 36, p= 0. 10)), and better learning function in HUU children (β= 0. 29, p= 0. 09). Among HUU children, a mean <b>CO</b> <b>value</b> exceeding 6. 11 ppm was associated with better motor function (p= 0. 09). Among HIV-infected children, 1 -OHP value was associated with a lower attention score (β=- 0. 84, p= 0. 03) and having a 1 -OHP value exceeding the median was significantly associated with lower function in the cognitive ability (p= 0. 01), short term memory (p= 0. 06), learning ability (p= 0. 01), delayed memory (p< 0. 01), and attention domains (p< 0. 01). Conclusions: Our results suggest that early life exposure to air pollutants such as PAHs may compromise healthy neurodevelopment, and that HIV-infection may pose added risk.

During the last decade, the single transpulmonary thermodilution (TPTD) technique was implemented in clinical practice. The purpose of this paper was to systematically review and critically assess the existing data concerning the reproducibility of CO measured using TPTD (COTPTD). A total of 16 studies were identified to potentially be included in our study because these studies had the required information that allowed for calculating the reproducibility of COTPTD measurements. 14 adult studies and 2 pediatric studies were analyzed.

30|$|Although the {{relationship}} between CO and PETCO 2 was initially described as linear [14, 22, 24, 25], other authors have suggested that a logarithmic function better defines this association [18, 20, 21]. According to the latter, in low-flow states (as during cardiac arrest or severe hemorrhagic shock), for a given change in CO a larger variation in PETCO 2 should be expected [18, 20, 21]. This marked reduction in PETCO 2 at low <b>CO</b> <b>values</b> might be attributed not only to limited CO 2 elimination, but also to changes in metabolic CO 2 production during oxygen supply dependency [21 – 23]. In contrast, at high <b>CO</b> <b>values,</b> pulmonary blood flow {{would not be the}} limiting factor for PETCO 2, and thus, changes in PETCO 2 would not reflect its variations but mainly the adequacy of alveolar ventilation [18, 20]. Although our study was not designed to address this specific issue, the strong association observed during PLR between fractional changes in CO and PETCO 2 suggests that, under the conditions described by the study protocol, this relationship remains valid over the wide range of studied <b>CO</b> <b>values.</b> Furthermore, the moderate magnitude of transient changes in CO produced by PLR (in contrast with marked and sustained decreases induced in some studies [18 – 21]) and the timing between PETCO 2 and CO measurements [25] may also have contributed to the observed findings in our study. When perturbations in CO were produced over a brief period of time and PETCO 2 measurements were performed within a relatively short time frame, similar results have been observed in previous studies [22, 25].|$|R

As CO is excreted solely by the lung, a simple technique {{for measuring the}} end tidal {{carbon monoxide}} (ETCO) level was assessed as a method for screening for haemolytic disease in children. Methods: Two end expiratory breath samples were collected from normal children and from children with haemolytic disease using a one way valve connector between a mouth piece and an anaesthetic bag. The samples were analysed by gas chromatography for CO and carbon for dioxide (CO 2). The CO 2 value was used to normalise the <b>CO</b> <b>value</b> to an alveolar concentration. Carboxyhaemoglobin (HbCO) also was measured in the patient group for correlation analysis with ETCO. Results: A total of 21 children with β thalassaemia major, 15 children with other haemolytic diseases (hereditary spherocytosis n= 8, haemoglobin H disease n= 3 and thalassaemia intermedia n= 4) and 23 normal children were studied. The mean ETCO concentrations in the three groups were 3. 21 p. p. m., 7. 41 p. p. m. and 0. 69 p. p. m., respectively, which were significantly {{different from each other}} (P< 0. 0001).

DISCUSSION: Large bias for both comparisons indicated that both PCM and ICG underestimate the true <b>CO</b> <b>value.</b> Paired CO values of individual subjects showed a better correlation between methods and a broad bias range, indicating a preponderant role for large between-subjects variability. Repeated COreb determinations in 1 Gz (i. e., when the cardiovascular system is in a steady state) should be used for calibration of the PCM and of ICG data. PCM and ICG can then be used to track CO dynamics during rapid changes of acceleration profiles...|$|E
40|$|Measurement {{of cardiac}} output (CO) {{requires}} use of invasive or minimally invasive devices; {{the use of}} non-invasive and minimally invasive devices has gained popu-larity in recent years. Th e bioreactance technique is a relatively new, continuous, totally non-invasive technique for measuring CO that is easily implemented. Th is new technique involves analyzing phase shifts of a delivered oscillating current that occur when the current traverses the thoracic cavity [1], and diff ers from traditional bio-impedance techniques that rely on analysis of changes in signal amplitude. Most validation studies in critically ill patients have shown good correlation and/or agreement of bio reactance <b>values</b> compared with <b>CO</b> <b>values</b> ob-tained using other devices in patients admitted after cardiac surgery [2 - 4]. However, validation in critically ill patients is lacking. As part of the internal evaluation of a bioreactance device before its implementation in the unit (evaluation of new non-invasive monitoring systems before intro duction in the unit {{does not require the}} approval of the ethics committee in our institution), we compared <b>CO</b> <b>values</b> obtained using the bioreactance technique (NICO...|$|R
40|$|The {{challenging}} {{issue of}} <b>value</b> (<b>co)</b> creation {{has attracted a}} great number of researchers and decision makers to debates on ways to improve the capacity and will of actors to collaborate to produce better solutions and results. Some researchers have analysed <b>value</b> (<b>co)</b> creation {{as the result of the}} individual and collective will to collaborate. Referring to these reflections, this paper proposes to investigate the topic of <b>value</b> (<b>co)</b> creation from a different point of view. It highlights not only how the opportunities for <b>value</b> (<b>co)</b> creation are related to the individual and collective will, but that they are influenced by deep individual and collective psychological and sociological status. Hence, <b>value</b> (<b>co)</b> creation is proposed as the peak of the social pyramid, the last step of a staircase, each level of which represents a specific actor’s need. Therefore, the principal goal is to demonstrate that a win-win logic in the <b>value</b> (<b>co)</b> creation perspective is possible only if all the involved actors are in a condition of well-being...|$|R
40|$|Spectra in the CH ^ 2 Π_ 1 / 2, J= 1 / 2, F= 1 - 1 {{transition}} at 3335 MHz {{were obtained}} in three 5 -point crosses {{centered on the}} Galactic plane at ℓ = 50, 100, and 110. The lines of sight traverse both Giant Molecular Clouds (GMCs) and local, smaller entities. This transition is a good tracer of low-density molecular gas and the line profiles {{are very similar to}} CO(1 - 0) data at nearly the same resolution. In addition, the CH 3335 MHz line can be used to calibrate the CO-H_ 2 conversion factor (X_ CO) in low-density molecular gas. Although this technique underestimates X_ CO in GMCs, our results are within a factor of two of X_ <b>CO</b> <b>values</b> calibrated for GMCs by other techniques. The similarity of CH and CO line profiles, and that of X_ <b>CO</b> <b>values</b> derived from CH and more traditional techniques, implies that most of the molecular gas along the observed lines of sight is at relatively low densities (n < 10 ^ 3 cm^- 3) ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three main investigations. The first of these is {{a study of the}} magnetic properties of Fe nanoparticles embedded in an Al matrix, with different volume fraction. Both Fe nanoparticles, with a diameter of ̴ 2 nm, and the Al matrix were deposited from the gas phase. The atomic Fe moment of the Fe nanoparticles in Al is much less than the bulk Fe value because of considerable alloying at the Fe nanoparticle and Al matrix interface. Two important parameters, the exchange field (Hex) and random anisotropy field (Hᵣ), were investigated using the Random Anisotropy Model (RAM). Fitting the data to this model reveals that with increasing volume filling fraction (VFF) of Fe nanoparticles in Al, both Hex and Hr show an increase, with Hr showing a more significant increase than for Hₑₓ. The second main investigation in this thesis is a study of structure and magnetism in Co nanoparticles embedded in antiferromagnetic Cr. Co K edge and Cr K edge extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) experiments were performed in order to investigate atomic structure in the Cr-embedded Co nanoparticles and Cr matrix respectively, whereas magnetism was investigated using a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). The atomic structure of the Co nanoparticles is same as the host Cr matrix (bcc), although with a degree of disorder, rather than the bulk Co hcp structure. The net Co moment per atom in the Co/Cr nanocomposite films is significantly lower than bulk <b>Co</b> <b>value,</b> and decreases as the proportion of Co nanoparticles in the film is decreased; for the sample with the most dilute concentration of Co nanoparticles (4. 9...|$|E
40|$|The {{observation}} of various flame propagation modes for externally heated tubes {{has led to}} many fundamental studies aimed at understanding flame propagation in microtubes. During these studies, {{it has been observed}} that for moderately low flow velocities, flames with repetitive extinction and ignition (FREI) have been observed to exist in various experimental, theoretical and numerical studies. The formation of these FREI flame modes depends on various parameters such as channel dimensions, wall temperature gradient, flow rates and mixture type. In the present work, an effort has been made to understand the effect of the wall temperature gradient on the FREI phenomenon through a 1 mm diameter circular tube using 2 D numerical studies with detailed GRI Mech 3. 0 for premixed methane/air mixtures. The different wall temperature gradients analyzed are varied from 33. 3 - 1 K mm(- 1), with an upper range corresponding to experimental conditions. Five different phases of flame propagation have been observed during the FREI flame propagation mode. The entire fuel gets consumed during the cycle and a significant amount of unburned CO remains during the weak reaction phase, towards the extinction of FREI mode. The effect of the wall temperature gradient on the FREI ignition phenomenon has been investigated to understand the development of ignition kernels. It is observed that the ignition happens at the axis and not at the wall of the channel. This happens due to a boundary-layer phenomenon discouraging ignition at the wall. It has been observed that a decrease in the temperature gradient results in movement of the ignition point towards the low-temperature region. The peak <b>CO</b> <b>value</b> increases with a decrease in the wall temperature gradient...|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} {{molecular}} cloud properties of N 55 in the Large Magellanic Cloud using ^ 12 CO(1 - 0) and ^ 13 CO(1 - 0) observations obtained with Atacama Large Millimeter Array. We {{have done a}} detailed study of molecular gas properties, {{to understand how the}} cloud properties of N 55 differ from Galactic clouds. Most CO emission appears clumpy in N 55, and molecular cores that have YSOs show larger linewidths and masses. The massive clumps are associated with high and intermediate mass YSOs. The clump masses are determined by local thermodynamic equilibrium and virial analysis of the ^ 12 CO and ^ 13 CO emissions. These mass estimates lead to the conclusion that, (a) the clumps are in self-gravitational virial equilibrium, and (b) the ^ 12 CO(1 - 0) -to-H_ 2 conversion factor, X_ CO, is 6. 5 × 10 ^ 20 cm^- 2 (K km s^- 1) ^- 1. This CO-to-H_ 2 conversion factor for N 55 clumps is measured at a spatial scale of ∼ 0. 67 pc, which is about two times higher than the X_ <b>CO</b> <b>value</b> of Orion cloud at a similar spatial scale. The core mass function of N 55 clearly show a turnover below 200 M_, separating the low-mass end from the high-mass end. The low-mass end of the ^ 12 CO mass spectrum is fitted with a power law of index 0. 5 ± 0. 1, while for ^ 13 CO it is fitted with a power law index 0. 6 ± 0. 2. In the high-mass end, the core mass spectrum is fitted with a power index of 2. 0 ± 0. 3 for ^ 12 CO, and with 2. 5 ± 0. 4 for ^ 13 CO. This power-law behavior of the core mass function in N 55 is consistent with many Galactic clouds. Comment: Accepted to Ap...|$|E

40|$|SummaryBackgroundSmoking is {{associated}} with an accelerated loss of lung function and inhalation accelerates the decline further. Exhaled CO reflects the exposure of smoke to the lungs. AimTo investigate whether self-reported inhalation and type of cigarette influenced the level of exhaled CO and whether CO could provide additional information to usual measures of smoking regarding prediction of present lung function and decline in lung function {{over an extended period}} of time. MethodCigarette smokers from the Copenhagen City Heart Study with valid measures of lung function and exhaled CO; in total 3738 subjects, 2096 women and 1642 men. ResultsSubjects not inhaling had slightly lower exhaled <b>CO</b> <b>values</b> than those inhaling, but substantially higher values than non-smokers (P< 0. 001). Smokers of plain cigarettes had slightly lower <b>CO</b> <b>values</b> than smokers of filter cigarettes (P< 0. 001). Increasing CO levels were correlated to a lower FEV 1 %pred and to an accelerated decline in lung function. However, in multiple linear regression analyses these correlations were not significant. ConclusionInhalation and type of cigarette affects exhaled CO levels. CO measures have no predictive value regarding neither present lung function nor decline in lung function with time in a population survey setting...|$|R
40|$|International audienceVolcanic {{degassing}} produces abundant H 2 O and CO 2, {{as well as}} SO 2, HCl, H 2 S, S 2, H 2, HF, CO, and SiF 4. Volcanic SO 2, HCl, and H 2 S {{have been}} detected from satellites in the past; the remaining species are analyzed in situ or using airborne instruments, with all the consequent limitations in safety and sampling, and at elevated costs. We report identification of high CO concentrations consistent with a volcanic origin (the 2010 Eyjafjallajökull and 2011 Grímsvötn eruptions in Iceland) in data from the Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere instrument (MOPITT) onboard EOS/Terra. The high <b>CO</b> <b>values</b> coincide spatially and temporally with ash plumes emanating from the eruptive centers, with elevated SO 2 and aerosol optical thickness, {{as well as with}} high <b>CO</b> <b>values</b> in data from the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI), onboard MetOp-A. CO has a positive indirect radiative forcing; climate models currently do not account for volcanic CO emissions. Given global volcanic CO 2 emissions between 130 and 440 Tg/year and volcanic CO:CO 2 ratios from the literature, we estimate that average global volcanic CO emissions may be on the order of ∼ 5. 5 Tg/year, equivalent to the CO emissions caused by combined fossil fuel and biofuel combustion in Australia...|$|R
