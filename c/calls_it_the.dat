The first aim of yoga is to become aware and control this vital air, to be equal to or lower than the inner fire within one's body. This inner fire resides in the middle part {{of the body}}, and he <b>calls</b> <b>it</b> <b>the</b> Nabhi (center) and a Chakra. This is the residence of the Jiva, and the vital air nourishes it from below while one is alive. Just above this Nabhi is the kundalini which normally is dormant. Yoga awakens her, by bringing vital air and heat to her.|$|E

25|$|Florus <b>calls</b> <b>it</b> <b>the</b> urbs urbinum, or {{capital of}} Sardinia, and {{represents}} it as taken and severely punished by Gracchus, but {{this statement is}} wholly at variance with Livy's account of the wars of Gracchus, in Sardinia, according to which the cities were faithful to Rome, and the revolt was confined to the mountain tribes. In the Civil War between Caesar and Pompey, the citizens of Caralis {{were the first to}} declare in favor of the former, an example soon followed by the other cities of Sardinia; and Caesar himself touched there with his fleet on his return from Africa. A few years later, when Sardinia fell into the hands of Menas, the lieutenant of Sextus Pompeius, Caralis was the only city which offered any resistance, but was taken after a short siege.|$|E

500|$|Ferdinand {{successfully}} led Fremde Heere West (German {{military intelligence}} for the Western Front, {{also referred to}} as FHW) to expect a landing in Genoa. In late July and early August the buildup of forces in Italy made it clear that a seaborne invasion was imminent, and the deception was successful in creating this as a realistic threat to Genoa. As a result, the Dragoon landings achieved complete tactical surprise. In his history of British wartime intelligence, historian Michael Howard <b>calls</b> <b>it</b> <b>the</b> [...] "most successful of 'A' Force's strategic operations". However, Howard states that the overwhelming force used for Operation Dragoon meant that the element of surprise was less important than on D-Day.|$|E

The section ends with a five-part harmony vocalizing a whole-note chord that is sustained by reverb for a further four beats. Lambert <b>calls</b> <b>it</b> <b>the</b> song's [...] "wake-up chord {{at the end of the}} meditation that transports the concept into a whole new realm: it's an iconic moment among iconic moments.

500|$|Two other {{participants}} were profoundly affected. Firstly, Knicks center Darrall Imhoff was branded as {{the player who}} let Chamberlain score 100 on him, although he only played 20 of 48minutes and {{was not on the}} court when it happened. On the other hand, the game immortalized little-used Warriors reserve player Joe Ruklick as the man who gave Chamberlain the 100-point assist. Decades later, The New York Times interviewed Ruklick and found out that he refers to himself as [...] "a walking footnote" [...] of one of basketball's greatest moments. The game also produced the famous picture of Chamberlain sitting on a bench, holding up a paper with a scribbled [...] "100". The photograph was actually a matter of improvisation: when Warriors PR manager Harvey Pollack entered the Warriors locker room, he took a paper and scribbled the number on it, and Associated Press photographer Paul Vathis who was there at the game (not for professional reasons, but rather because he wanted to give his son a treat) took the now-famous photo.

500|$|The {{highest point}} of the temple (kalasa) has {{the shape of a}} water pot and stands on top of the tower. This portion of the vimana is often lost due to age and has been {{replaced}} with a metallic pinnacle. Below the kalasa is a large, highly- sculptured structure resembling a dome which is made from large stones and looks like a helmet. [...] It may be 2m by 2m in size and follows the shape of the shrine. Below this structure are domed roofs in a square plan, all of them much smaller and crowned with small kalasas. They are mixed with other small roofs of different shapes and are ornately decorated. The tower of the shrine usually has three or four tiers of rows of decorative roofs while the tower on top of the sukanasi has one less tier, making the tower look like an extension of the main tower (Foekema <b>calls</b> <b>it</b> <b>the</b> [...] "nose"). One decorated roof tier runs on top of the wall of a closed mantapa above the heavy eaves of an open mantapa and above the porches.|$|E
