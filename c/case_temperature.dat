50|$|As can be {{seen from}} the {{derating}} curve image for a hypothetical bipolar junction transistor, the device (rated for 100 W at 25 C) cannot be expected to dissipate anything more than about 40 W if the ambient temperature is such that the temperature at which the device's case will stabilise (after heat-sinking) is 65 C. This final <b>case</b> <b>temperature</b> is a function of the thermal resistance between the device's case and the heat-sink; and the heat-sink and the ambient (this includes the heat-sink's temp/watt rating - with lower values implying better cooling characteristics).|$|E

5000|$|A manual {{subjective}} test is implemented {{to determine the}} MRTD. An operator uses a series of 4-bar targets of different spatial frequencies. For each target he/she adjusts the blackbody, (source of Infrared radiation), temperature up and down until the pattern is [...] "just resolvable." [...] The positive and negative temperature differences are stored into a two dimensional array. The corresponding spatial frequencies used in each test are also stored into an array. The MRTD curve is a plot of these arrays (just resolvable temperature difference versus target spatial frequency).

5000|$|The maximum time {{interval}} between refresh operations is standardized by JEDEC for each DRAM technology, and is {{specified in the}} manufacturer's chip specifications. It is usually {{in the range of}} milliseconds for DRAM and microseconds for eDRAM. For current (2012) DDR2 SDRAM chips it is 64 ms. [...] It depends on the ratio of charge stored in the memory cell capacitors to leakage currents. Despite the fact that the geometry of the capacitors has been shrinking with each new generation of memory chips, refresh times for DRAM have been improving; from 8 ms for 1M chips, 32 ms for 16M chips, to 64 ms for 256M chips. This improvement is achieved partly by developing transistors that leak significantly less. Longer refresh time means a smaller fraction of the device's time is occupied with refresh, leaving more time for memory accesses. Although refresh overhead occupied up to 10% of chip time in earlier DRAMs, in modern chips this fraction is less than 1%. Because the leakage currents in semiconductors increase with temperature, refresh times must be decreased at high temperature. The current generation of DDR2 SDRAM chips has a temperature-compensated refresh structure; refresh cycle time must be halved when chip <b>case</b> <b>temperature</b> exceeds 85 C.|$|E

40|$|It is very {{important}} to be able to simulate axial piston pumps in order to under- stand its impact on the velocity, pressure and temperature of the lubricating oil in the pump. These variables have huge impact on the leakage in the lubricating gaps which is strongly related to the amount of power loss in the pump. This thesis main focus have been to further develop a in-house developed FSI (Fluid Structure Interacting model) software called CASPAR, which is developed by MAHA Fluid Power Research Center in order to calculate the velocity, pressure and temperature in an axial piston pump. This software has been further developed in three main research steps. One step was to develop a simplified and fast model that predicts the <b>case</b> <b>temperature</b> in an axial piston pump. The <b>case</b> <b>temperature</b> has previously been proven {{to have an impact on}} the power loss due to thermal deformation of the structure in the lubricating gaps. The calculated <b>case</b> <b>temperature</b> with this model should be used as a mixed boundary condition in the calculation tool CASPAR. The <b>case</b> <b>temperature</b> was previously taken from measurements. Measurements regarding the <b>case</b> <b>temperature</b> in an actual axial piston pump has been taken in order to analyze and validate the developed model for the <b>case</b> <b>temperature.</b> The behavior of the model has shown that the gap height is strongly influenced by the <b>case</b> <b>temperature,</b> hence the simplification to use constant gap heights in the lubricating gaps are not a valid approximation. Instead a further investigation has to be done and a recommendation to integrate the developed model with CASPAR, where both gap heights and leakage are calculated. CASPAR is divided into two parts, the Pressure Module and Gap Flow Module. These have been further developed in this thesis in order to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the calculations of axial piston pumps. This was done by using and merging previous versions of the Pressure Module in to one single version and to develop the possibility to simulate the three lubricating gaps in an axial piston pump simultaneously with the Gap Flow Module. The new single version of the Pressure Module is called the Coupled Pressure Module and it is now possible to run simulations while combining different models considering different physical effects. The simultaneous calculations of the lubri- cating gaps is called the Coupled Gap Flow Module. This has improved the time efficiency compared to independently calculated lubricating gaps. Friction forces are transmitted between the gaps in the way it is meant to be and the Coupled Pressure Module and Coupled Gap Flow Module is a part of the step against the development of the new version of CASPAR. The new version of CASPAR should be one improved version where more physics is included compared to the old versions...|$|E
