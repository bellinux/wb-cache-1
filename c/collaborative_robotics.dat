40|$|Robotics in {{education}} {{has shown the}} potential to positively benefit student learning and attitudes towards learning. However, {{a necessary part of}} robotics instruction is group collaboration. Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} was to determine what collaborative scaffolds, or interventions, produce positive effects for students working on <b>collaborative</b> <b>robotics</b> projects for science process skills, collaborative problem solving, and motivation. In addition, the study examined the impact students’ prior robotics experience had on science process skills, collaborative problem solving, and motivation. The study had two experience levels, Novice and Experienced, and three intervention conditions. The interventions included Assigned Group Roles, Classroom Discussion, and Previous Instructional Practices, which followed practices from prior years without any additional collaborative supports. All the participants experienced problem-based learning during the <b>collaborative</b> <b>robotics</b> project with collaborative scaffolds based upon their intervention conditions. The goal of the study was to identify what collaboration interventions can best support the collaborative nature of robotics instruction and create a beneficial learning environment for students by supporting student collaboration and possibly improving student motivation, collaborative problem solving, and science process skills. Furthermore, the study sought to identify impacts of different robotics experience levels to fully understand <b>collaborative</b> <b>robotics</b> projects for students as they progress through a continuing robotics curriculum. The results of the study indicated experience level and collaboration interventions can have impacts on students. Assigned Group Roles had positive effects on students’ motivation and collaborative problem solving. Experience level also had effects upon student motivation and collaborative problem solving with the Novice level demonstrating higher outcomes. A collaboration intervention was identified that has the potential to produce positive effects for students in <b>collaborative</b> <b>robotics</b> projects as well as assist classroom educators in the purposeful design of <b>collaborative</b> <b>robotics</b> projects with scientifically based strategies to improve the attitudinal outcomes for students of various robotics experience...|$|E

40|$|Total {{shoulder}} arthroplasty (TSA) is {{the third}} most common joint replacement. While robot-assisted hip and knee replacement technologies have enjoyed extensive development, this has been limited in the upper limb. This work focused on quantifying the localization accuracy of a robotic system, and evaluating its efficacy {{in the context of}} TSA. A collaborative robot was fitted with a stylus tip to perform manual surface digitizations using the robot’s encoder output. In the first experiment, two precision-machined master cubes, representing the working volume around a glenoid structure, were used for system validation. Next, cadaveric glenoids were digitized and compared to a ‘gold standard’ laser scanner. Digitization errors were 0. 37 ± 0. 27 mm, showing that <b>collaborative</b> <b>robotics</b> can be used for osseous anatomy digitization.

40|$|Abstract: Collaborative robots {{represent}} a nonlinear system having nonholonomic constraints. Due to nonholonomic constraints, the collaborative robots are not point stabilizable using continuous time-invariant feedback. Therefore, linear control is ineffective so that innovative design techniques are required. One such possible technique is feedback linearization. This paper proposes a kinematically compatible {{framework for the}} development of nonholonomic collaborative robots using feedback control techniques. It presents a comparative assessment of various standard feedback control strategies. The nonholonomic <b>collaborative</b> <b>robotic</b> system is modeled using Simulink and the results are presented confirming the performance of various controllers. From the simulation results, the nonlinear feedback control strategy improves the system performance. Furthermore, the nonlinear control strategy globally-asymptotically stabilizes the system compared to the other feedback strategies. The work presented here is an initial study concerning the applicability of kinematic based control on collaborative robots. Copyright © 2007 IFA...|$|R

40|$|As robots {{become more}} complex and {{versatile}} systems, demands on their collaboration abilities arise. Optimal control for robot manipulators is a widely explored topic in the literature. One bio-inspired approach towards fast motion planning using finite sets of motion primitives has been proposed by Nori and Frezza [1].

As the foundation of the testenvironment, small bionically inspired robots are presented. The robots are small (20 cm x 5 cm x 5 cm) and lightweight (< 200 g). Their design is inspired by the movement of caterpillars. Three cubical segments are connected via special joints, where each of these joints has three independent degrees of translatory freedom. Thus, the robots are able to handle rough terrain with small obstacles. The robots are driven by innovative piezoelectric motors that allow a gearless design without any rotary parts.
