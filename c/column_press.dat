"I propose," [...] he said, [...] "to fell {{some trees}} across the road, {{arranging}} {{them so that}} the guns can fire between them, while the trunks will afford the gunners some shelter. Half the men will be arranged among the trees on either side, so that while the guns sweep the column we shall attack it upon either flank. I will place a hundred of my best men at the barricade to defend the guns should the <b>column</b> <b>press</b> forward in spite of our efforts; but I believe that we shall have an easy victory.

60|$|The Lydian {{army was}} {{superior}} to that of Cyrus in cavalry, and as {{the place where the}} battle was to be fought was a plain, which was the kind of ground most favorable for the operations of that species of force, Cyrus felt some solicitude in respect to the impression which might be made by it on his army. Nothing is more terrible than the onset of a squadron of horse when charging an enemy upon the field of battle. They come in vast bodies, sometimes consisting of many thousands, with the speed of the wind, the men flourishing their sabers and rending the air with the most unearthly cries, those in advance being driven irresistibly on by the weight and impetus of the masses behind. The dreadful torrent bears down and overwhelms every thing that attempts to resist its way. They trample one another and their enemies together promiscuously in the dust; the foremost of the <b>column</b> <b>press</b> on with the utmost fury, afraid quite as much of the headlong torrent of friends coming on behind them, as of the line of fixed and motionless enemies who stand ready to receive them before. These enemies, stationed to withstand the charge, arrange themselves in triple or quadruple rows, with the shafts of their spears planted against the ground, and the points directed forward and upward to receive the advancing horsemen. These spears transfix and kill the foremost horses; but those that come on behind, leaping and plunging over their fallen companions, soon break through the lines and put their enemies to flight, in a scene of indescribable havoc and confusion.|$|E

The project contains a dividing of machines, short description, advantages and disadvantages and using of concrete types of forging hammers and hydraulic presses in practice. Advantages of forging hammers are simple construction, high range of choice from many types and simple maintenance. Disadvantages are big shakes and danger of accident. Forging hammers can be chosen from spring, pneumatic, hydraulic and steam air types with or without acceleration. Hydraulic presses are divided into push -down presses (two and four - <b>column</b> <b>presses)</b> and pull - down presses (two and four - <b>column</b> <b>presses).</b> Advantages consist in simple operating and controlling via computer.

25|$|At dawn on 29 September, {{a column}} under François Sébastien Charles Joseph de Croix, Count of Clerfayt crossed the Sambre at Berlaimont, {{southwest}} of Maubeuge.

To the east of Maubeuge, Austrians under Maximilian Anton Karl, Count Baillet de Latour crossed the Sambre near Marpent and Jeumont. A column under Alexander Friedrich von Seckendorf crossed near Merbes-le-Château farther east. These forces forced Meyer's troops in disorder back within Maubeuge, which was isolated.|$|R

60|$|The battle, however, {{was not yet}} over. The {{artillery}} on {{both sides}} played across the ravine, the French skirmishers swarmed {{down to the river}} bank, and between them and the British infantry a rapid fire was exchanged, while a heavy column marched down to the bridge. With a deep-sounding cheer they advanced upon it, while with answering cheers the British opened fire upon them. The depth of the ravine at first deceived the British marksmen, and the <b>column</b> <b>pressed</b> on until its head was three-quarters across the bridge. Then the shower smote it, and beneath that terrible fire the head of the column melted away. Still it pressed on until across the bridge the corpses lay piled in a mass as high as the parapet, and beyond this heap, this terrible line, there was no living. Then sullenly and slowly the French fell back, while the British cheers rose exultingly along the hillside.|$|R

6000|$|The {{work of the}} 14th, however, {{was less}} severe than was expected. The enemy fought stoutly at the village, {{advancing}} beyond the inclosures to meet our troops. Our superior rifle and artillery fire, however, drove them back, and then they clung stubbornly to the village and inclosures, our advance being retarded by the threatening attitude of large bodies of the enemy's cavalry, who moved upon the flanks and menaced the baggage. The force under Havelock being so weak in cavalry--for the native irregulars had been disarmed and dismounted for their bad conduct--there remained only Warrener's Horse, who were known in the force as the [...] "volunteers." [...] These covered the baggage, and executed several brilliant charges on parties of the enemy's cavalry who came too boldly forward; but the artillery had to be brought from the front, and to open upon the heavy masses of the enemy's cavalry, before they would fall back. Then the <b>column</b> <b>pressed</b> forward again, captured Dong, with two guns placed there, and drove the enemy out in headlong flight.|$|R

The calculation of strength of CFST should be carried out on the basis of nonlinear reinforced concrete deformation model. Three-axis tensely-deformed conditions are assumed for the analytical description of work of the concrete core and the external steel holder. The basic dependencies, which allow to carry out such approximate calculations of the ultimate stress of compressed CFST, are resulted, too...|$|R
