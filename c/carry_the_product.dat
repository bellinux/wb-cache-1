The government, which never questioned the superiority of Western technology, overrode these objections and proceeded to construct the plant and operation started in 1890. However, within 196 days the plant had to be shut down and the government gave up- mainly due to the poor quality of coke made from Japanese coal.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} a single machine scheduling problem. This {{problem has been}} solved for a medical laboratory. It comprises not only chain-structured precedence constraints, but also minimal and maximal times separating successive jobs in the same chain. The criterion to be minimized is the makespan. This problem arises particularly in systems where chemical processes are involved. Consider a chemical plant in which every chemical process is a sequence of chemical reactions the duration of which is upper and lower bounded. Between two successive chemical reactions which are performed in different locations, a transportation system such as robot is used to <b>carry</b> <b>the</b> <b>product</b> from place to place. In this kind of plant, jobs are transportation operations and production processes can be modeled as chains. Therefore the problem studied in this paper is of practical importance.

40|$|In Greek mythology, mariners {{had more}} to worry about than just the wind, waves, and other natural hazards of the sea. If they ventured {{too close to a}} {{particular}} island, they would hear the enchanting songs of sirens. Those who heard the music were unable to resist, following it to their deaths as their boats crashed into the island’s rocky shores. Although few would argue nowadays that music is strong enough to render listeners as helpless as the ill-fated Greek adventurers, studies show that music does have the power to sway people navigating the waters of today’s media-saturated society (Allan, 2008; Bruner, 1990; North & Hargreaves, 2008). Music is used as a means of persuasion in love, political messages, and commercial advertising. Empirical research in media persuasion suggests that music, in conjunction with extra-musical information (e. g., visual images, words, narrative structure), exerts a persuasive infl uence through cog-nitive and affective processes. Alexomanolaki, Loveday, and Kennett (2007) state that ‘Music may play several roles and have many effects in advertising; it may attract atten-tion, <b>carry</b> <b>the</b> <b>product</b> message, act as a mnemonic device, and create excitement or a state of relaxation ’ (p. 51) ...|$|E
40|$|A {{filtered}} data sequence can {{be obtained}} by multiplying the Fourier ordinates of the data by the ordinates of the frequency response of the filter and by applying the inverse Fourier transform to <b>carry</b> <b>the</b> <b>product</b> back to the time domain. Using this technique, it is possible, within the constraints of a finite sample, to design an ideal frequency-selective filter that will preserve all elements within a specified range of frequencies and that will remove all elements outside it. Approximations to ideal filters that are implemented in the time domain are commonly based on truncated versions of the infinite sequences of coefficients derived from the Fourier transforms of rectangular frequency response functions. An alternative to truncating an infinite sequence of coefficients is to wrap it around a circle of a circumference equal in length to the data sequence and to add the overlying coefficients. The coefficients of the wrapped filter can also be obtained by applying a discrete Fourier transform to a set of ordinates sampled from the frequency response function.
