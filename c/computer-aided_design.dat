5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, {{operating}} cost replaced capacity {{as the primary}} factor in airliner purchases. As a result, the 767's design process emphasized fuel efficiency from the outset. Boeing targeted a 20 to 30percent cost saving over earlier aircraft, mainly through new engine and wing technology. As development progressed, engineers used <b>computer-aided</b> <b>design</b> for {{over a third of}} the 767's design drawings, and performed 26,000 hours of wind tunnel tests. Design work occurred concurrently with the 757 twinjet, leading Boeing to treat both as almost one program to reduce risk and cost. Both aircraft would ultimately receive shared design features, including avionics, flight management systems, instruments, and handling characteristics. Combined development costs were estimated at $3.5 to $4billion.|$|E
5|$|Pitt has a {{sustained}} interest in architecture, even taking {{time away from}} film to study <b>computer-aided</b> <b>design</b> at the Los Angeles offices of renowned architect Frank Gehry. He narrated Design e2, a PBS television series focused on worldwide efforts to build environmentally friendly structures through sustainable architecture and design. In 2000, he co-authored an architectural book on the Blacker House with the architects Thomas A. Heinz and Randell Makinson. In 2006, he founded the Make It Right Foundation, organizing housing professionals in New Orleans to finance and construct 150sustainable, affordable new houses in New Orleans's Ninth Ward following the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina. The project involves 13 architectural firms and the environmental organization Global Green USA, with several of the firms donating their services. Pitt and philanthropist Steve Bing have each committed $5million in donations. The first six homes were completed in October 2008, and in September 2009 Pitt received an award {{in recognition of the}} project from the U.S. Green Building Council, a non-profit trade organization that promotes sustainability in how buildings are designed, built and operated. Pitt met with U.S. President Barack Obama and Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi in March 2009 to promote his concept of green housing as a national model and to discuss federal funding possibilities.|$|E

This paper reports an indication of findings from other research studies carried out in contexts beyond general education that have sought evidence relating CAD and creativity. It describes the establishment of a framework for gathering empirical evidence to support the analysis of links between CAD and creativity, via the observation of creative behaviours, which was developed from published literature largely relating to the area of cognitive psychology. It notes some initial research findings concerning the use of this framework in analysing the use of CAD in postgraduate design projects completed at Loughborough University. These results demonstrate the occurrence of creative behaviours in association with the use of CAD when designing. Finally the significance of these results is discussed within the wider context of design modelling. Key words Creativity, <b>computer-aided</b> <b>designing,</b> CAD, empirica...|$|R
