5|$|When {{discussing}} the Eurasian Economic Union, Vladimir Putin said the Eurasian Economic Union would include closer coordination {{of economic and}} monetary policy, {{including the use of}} a <b>common</b> <b>currency</b> in the future. Although the creation of a monetary union was not envisaged in the Eurasian Economic Union Treaty, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev called for the introduction of a <b>common</b> <b>currency</b> for the Eurasian Economic Union. Leonid Slutsky, head of the State Duma's CIS committee, backed Medvedev's proposal to start discussions on the creation of a monetary union. Slutsky said it could be introduced shortly after 2015, when the union's structure becomes clear.|$|E
5|$|A 2009 {{consensus}} {{from the}} studies of {{the introduction of the}} euro concluded that it has increased trade within the eurozone by 5% to 10%, although one study suggested an increase of only 3% while another estimated 9 to 14%. However, a meta-analysis of all available studies suggests that the prevalence of positive estimates is caused by publication bias and that the underlying effect may be negligible. Furthermore, studies accounting for time trend reflecting general cohesion policies in Europe that started before, and continue after implementing the <b>common</b> <b>currency</b> find no effect on trade. These results suggest that other policies aimed at European integration might be the source of observed increase in trade.|$|E

40|$|To {{quantify}} {{the implications of}} <b>common</b> <b>currencies</b> for trade and income, we use data for over 200 countries and dependencies. In our two-stage approach, estimates at the first stage suggest that belonging to a currency union/board triples trade with other currency union members. Moreover, {{there is no evidence}} of trade diversion. Our estimates at the second stage suggest that every 1 percent increase in a country's overall trade (relative to GDP) raises income per capita by at least one-third of a percent. We combine the two estimates to {{quantify the}} effect of <b>common</b> <b>currencies</b> on output.

5|$|In February 1992, European Union {{countries}} {{signed the}} Maastricht Treaty which outlined a three-stage plan to accelerate progress toward an Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). The first stage centered on liberalizing capital mobility and aligning macroeconomic policies between countries. The second stage established the European Monetary Institute which was ultimately dissolved {{in tandem with}} the establishment in 1998 of the European Central Bank (ECB) and European System of Central Banks. Key to the Maastricht Treaty was the outlining of convergence criteria that EU members would need to satisfy before being permitted to proceed. The third and final stage introduced a <b>common</b> <b>currency</b> for circulation known as the Euro, adopted by eleven of then-fifteen members of the European Union in January 1999. In doing so, they disaggregated their sovereignty in matters of monetary policy. These countries continued to circulate their national legal tenders, exchangeable for euros at fixed rates, until 2002 when the ECB began issuing official Euro coins and notes. , the EMU comprises 17 nations which have issued the Euro, and 11 non-Euro states.|$|E
5|$|In March 1948 Rau became {{chairman}} of the German Economic Commission (Deutsche Wirtschaftskommission or DWK), which during this period became the centralised administrative organisation for the Soviet Occupation Zone and the predecessor of the future East German government. The organisation existed {{during a time of}} very difficult challenges coming from different sides. A particularly momentous event during this time was the currency reform of 1948. On 20June 1948 the western German zones introduced a new currency, leaving the eastern zone to use the old <b>common</b> <b>currency.</b> In order to avoid inflation, the DWK under Rau's leadership, was forced to follow quickly with its own reform and issued an own currency too. In doing so, the DWK also exploited the currency reform to redistribute capital by using different exchange rates for private and state-run companies. The disagreement, which of the two new currencies should be used in Berlin, triggered the Berlin Blockade by the USSR and the western airborne supply of West Berlin.|$|E

25|$|The {{political}} situation, however, was not {{favorable for}} maintaining a <b>common</b> <b>currency.</b> Maintaining a <b>common</b> <b>currency</b> requires a strong political consensus {{in respect to}} monetary and fiscal targets, a common institution in charge of implementing these targets, and some minimum of common legislation (concerning the banking and foreign exchange regulations).

40|$|Gravity-based {{cross-sectional}} {{evidence indicates}} that currency unions and currency boards stimulate trade; cross-sectional {{evidence indicates that}} trade stimulates income. This paper estimates the effect that common-currency regimes have, via trade, on income per capita. We use economic and geographic data for over 200 countries to quantify the implications of <b>common</b> <b>currencies</b> for trade and income, pursuing a two-stage approach. Our estimates at the first stage suggest that belonging to a currency union more than triples trade with {{the other members of}} the zone. Moreover, there is no evidence of trade-diversion. Thus currency unions raise overall trade. Currency boards have similar effects. Our estimates at the second stage suggest that every one percent increase in trade (relative to GDP) raises income per capita by at least one third of a percent over twenty years. We combine the two estimates to quantify the effect of <b>common</b> <b>currencies</b> on output. Our results support the hypothesis that the beneficial effects of such regimes on economic performance come through the promotion of trade, rather than through a commitment to non-inflationary monetary policy, or other macroeconomic influences. ...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that the brain assigns values to options and converts these values into a <b>common</b> neural <b>currency.</b> This allows objects of different classes to be compared during decision-making. The concept of a <b>common</b> neural <b>currency</b> is central to neuroeconomics. Yet, there is no conclusive evidence supporting this hypothesis. In this article, an ALE meta-analysis is performed to determine the underlying neural correlated of valuation and choice for primary and secondary reinforcers. Studies included in the meta-analyses employed {{a wide array of}} choice-paradigms and measured different brain signals in order to give a comprehensive overview of neural substrates involved in decision-making. A conjunction map showed an overlapping cluster in the medial orbitofrontal cortex for primary and secondary reinforcers. This finding supports the idea of a <b>common</b> neural <b>currency</b> as a single area of the brain encodes value signals during decision-making regardless of the reinforcer category. However, reinforcer specific brain areas were also found. Activity in the medial prefrontal cortex was specific for primary reinforcers. Insular activity seems to be specific for secondary reinforcer. Significant clusters were found in the caudate for both reinforcer categories. Activity in the caudate seemed to be lateralized, as a cluster in the left caudate was specific for primary reinforcer and a cluster in the right caudate was specific for secondary reinforcers. We conclude that the brain seems to compare values in a <b>common</b> neural <b>currency.</b> However, these value signals are modulated by brain areas that are reinforcer specific...|$|R
