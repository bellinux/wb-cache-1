40|$|The ITER cable-in-conduit {{conductors}} (CICCs) {{are built}} up from sub-cable bundles, wound in different stages, which are twisted to <b>counter</b> <b>coupling</b> loss caused by time-changing external magnet fields. The {{selection of the}} twist pitch lengths has major implications {{for the performance of}} the cable in the case of strain sensitive superconductors, i. e. Nb 3 Sn, as the electromagnetic and thermal contraction loads are large but also for the heat load from the AC coupling loss. Reduction of the transverse load and warm-up cool-down degradation can be reached by applying longer twist pitches in a particular sequence for the sub-stages, offering a large cable transverse stiffness, adequate axial flexibility and maximum allowed lateral strand support. Analysis of short sample (TF conductor) data reveals that increasing the twist pitch can lead to a gain of the effective axial compressive strain of more than 0. 3 % with practically no degradation from bending. For reduction of the coupling loss, specific choices of the cabling twist sequence are needed with the aim to minimize the area of linked strands and bundles that are coupled and form loops with the applied changing magnetic field, instead of simply avoiding longer pitches. In addition we recommend increasing the wrap coverage of the CS conductor from 50 % to at least 70 %. The models predict significant improvement against strain sensitivity and substantial decrease of the AC coupling loss in Nb 3 Sn CICCs, but also for NbTi CICCs minimization of the coupling loss can be achieved. Although the success of long pitches to transverse load degradation was already demonstrated, the prediction of the combination with low coupling loss needs to be validated by a short sample test.

40|$|International audienceFlow {{radioactivity}} <b>counters</b> <b>coupled</b> to {{liquid chromatography}} devices cause a systematic bias to the separation by broadening peaks within the radiochromatogram. Such signal smearing may be evaluated on standardization runs {{with a single}} peak, using the ratio between Fourier transforms of whole chromatographic data for the measured radioactivity time series (radioactivity channel) and for the concentration time series (optical density channel). This ratio constitutes a kernel suitable to perform the deconvolution of any radiochromatogram performed under similar conditions. Through deconvolution, the signal smearing is removed, reverting to peaks with the same geometry as in the concentration chromatogram: same retention time, peak width, and shape. The deconvolution method in processing radiochromatograms allows an easier interpretation and gives more reliable radioactivity quantification (improved linearity of the measured response). Fourier transformation of the radiochromatogram also allows the removal of transitory events (noise) through the correlation procedure. This method may provide substantial gain in sensitivity, depending upon the residence time of the sample in the counting cell...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA {{complementary}} physics to the LHC subjects {{comes from}} the neutrino sector which has already opened a window beyond the standard model. Neutrino oscillations have already proved that neutrinos have non zero masses. But, neutrino nature and absolute mass scale are still major questions which answers could have big effects at the cosmological level. Several neutrinoless double beta decay experiments are underway or planed for the near future trying to address the above questions. These experiments mainly use bolometric techniques or gaseous <b>counters</b> <b>coupled</b> with scintillator detectors. Energy resolution is significantly better in bolometric experiments but experiments coupling tracking with calorimetry have much better background rejection by identifying the two electrons produced by the double beta decay process. Another technique of detecting the electrons with reasonable energy resolution without using electronic detectors is the utilisation of nuclear emulsions. This technique {{has the advantage of}} precise tracking and vertexing even for low energy electrons, allowing a high background rejection. This possibility is presented in this paper.

Initially, important data about the dust, obtained at wavelengths ranging from the infra-red to ultra-violet spectral regions, are discussed in order to establish a useful description of the grains themselves. This is then used to estimate the magnitude and form of the expected x-ray scattering effect which is shown to manifest itself as a diffuse halo accompanying the image of a celestial x-ray source. Two x-ray imaging experiments are then discussed. The first, specifically proposed to look for this effect surrounding a point x-ray source, was the Skylark 1611 project, and comprised an imaging proportional <b>counter</b> <b>coupled</b> to a Wolter type 1 x-ray mirror.

40|$|We {{present a}} single cell {{detection}} device based on magnetic bead assay and micro Coulter counters. This device {{consists of two}} successive micro Coulter <b>counters,</b> <b>coupled</b> with a high gradient magnetic field generated by an external magnet. The device can identify single cells {{in terms of the}} transit time difference of the cell through the two micro Coulter counters. Target cells are conjugated with magnetic beads via specific antibody and antigen binding. A target cell traveling through the two Coulter counters interacts with the magnetic field, and have a longer transit time at the 1 st counter than that at the 2 nd counter. In comparison, a non-target cell has no interaction with the magnetic field, and hence has nearly the same transit times through the two counters. Each cell passing through the two counters generates two consecutive voltage pulses one after the other; the pulse widths and magnitudes indicating the cell's transit times through the counters and the cell's size respectively. Thus, by measuring the pulse widths (transit times) of each cell through the two counters, each single target cell can be differentiated from non-target cells even if they have similar sizes. We experimentally proved that the target human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and non-target rat adipose-derived stem cells (rASCs) have significant different transit time distribution, from which we can determine the recognition regions for both cell groups quantitatively. We further demonstrated that within a mixed cell population of rASCs and HUVECs, HUVECs can be detected in situ and the measured HUVECs ratios agree well with the pre-set ratios. With the simple device structure and easy sample preparation, this method is expected to enable single cell detection in a continuous flow and can be applied to facilitate general cell detection applications such as stem cell identification and enumeration...|$|R
40|$|The {{kinetics}} of cell aggregation in shaking suspension are complex. Consequently most existing {{forms of}} assessment are qualitative or semiquantitative. We {{have used a}} Coulter <b>counter</b> <b>coupled</b> to a particle size discriminator to describe aggregation more precisely. BHK 21 C 13 cells were suspended by light or heavy trypsin/EDTA treatments, and then aggregated at 37 °C. Plots were obtained showing the distribution of cells in 1 - 50 cell aggre-gates, from which were calculated the rates of redistribution of cells between aggregates. About half the cells in the initial suspension were not single. During the first 5 min of aggre-gation single cells and aggregates containing up to 4 cells disappeared into larger aggregates. At later times there was a shift towards {{a net loss of}} slightly larger aggregates. Adhesions between single cells were the most common event throughout aggregation, but they declined relatively rapidly with time as adhesions between aggregates became relatively more prominent. The overall rate of adhesions declined 10 -fold within 12 min and 100 -fold within 90 min. In contrast to normal fibroblasts, nearly all transformed BHK 21 cells in initial suspensions were single, and even by 30 min few single cells had adhered to form aggregates. The initial rate at which adhesions were formed was only about 15 % of that of normal cells. Heavy trypsin/EDTA treatment of normal cells released DNAse-sensitive material which markedly altered the aggregation kinetics. These changes included the disaggregation of small loosely adhering cell clusters coupled with the formation of abnormally large aggregates. It is suggested that careful preparation of suspensions together with assessment of aggregation on the basis of initial adhesion rate will improve the accuracy and information yield in this type of experiment...|$|R

The best proportions of the counting cocktail was found consist of 4. 0 ml of aqueous sample, 3. 0 ml of Triton X- 100 and 3. 0 ml of toluene containing 4. 0 g per litre PRO and 0. 4 g per litre POPOP. The effects of pH, acids, bases, buffers, and salts on the stability of the mixture and on the detection efficiency of the radioisotopes, were investigated and found not to be severe. Pretreatment of the sample was not required. It was found that temperature changes, beyond the operating temperature range, could result severe errors. 1024 channels of aquisition area, for the collection of the spectra, give good conditions for computer analysis. End channel and channel number of maximum count calibration gave a linear relationship to the Em, of standard beta emitters. It was found that the theoretical fitting of the spectra is possible and the normalisation ratio V of the theoretical to the experimental fitting procedure has alinear relationship to the activity of emitter. Kurie plot was applied for checking the Emav value of the emitters used. Application of the Cerenkov counting technique for beta emitters, gives extra data to support the main results.

40|$|This thesis work {{discusses}} {{the design and}} validation of two circuit components used in the electronic readout of positron emission tomography (PET) scanners for biomedical applications: a constant fraction discriminator (CFD) and an integrated CMOS time to digital converter (TDC). The former {{is used in the}} read out of a double-head PET scanner already developed by the group of medical physics at INFN Pisa for non-invasive dose delivery monitoring in hadrontherapy. The goal of the work has been the optimization of the front-end PCB in terms of timing performances so as to reduce the dead time and resolution at system level. A new CFD board has been implemented and experimental results have shown a significant enhancement of the timing characteristics which have enabled performing in-beam PET data acquisition which is fundamental in hadrontherapy treatment. The design of an integrated CMOS TDC to be used for the time of flight measurement in a magnetic field-compatible PET block detector is the second topic of the thesis. The required time resolutions, linear behaviour as well as the communication with other readout elements have been taken into account in the definition of the circuit topology. Cadence and Verilog simulations have shown that a bin size of 100 ps can be obtained with the combination of a submicron technology (UMC 65 nm LLLVT) and a pipeline approach where a 10 bit systolic <b>counter</b> <b>coupled</b> to a 4 stage delay locked loop (DLL) are exploited. This translates into a nominal resolution of 29 ps. In addition, the use of a short DLL leads to a high linearity which is an issue in PET measurements. Despite lower resolutions are obtained in literature with different TDC topologies, achieving good performances in terms of both time resolution and linearity is not straightforward. The converter also features a real-time validation algorithm which is capable to reject noise inputs generated by the photodetector without impairing the acquisition capability of the system. A standard-cell unit has been also designed which is in charge of data buffering and serial communication with external readout boards. A 47 bit output word is provided by the semi-custom stage at a measurement rate which is selectable between 31. 25 MHz and 62. 5 MHz with a double hit resolution of 170 ns.

40|$|There {{has been}} little {{development}} regarding analysis of polonium (Po) in environmental samples since the 1960 ies. This {{is due to the}} straightforward spontaneous deposition of this element on silver (Ag), nickel (Ni) or copper (Cu) without any radiochemical separation. For many years, no radiochemical yield determinant was used and it was generally supposed that the yield was 100 % after two depositions. Counting was often done using ZnS scintillation <b>counter</b> <b>coupled</b> to a photomultiplier tube. However, the use of the yield determinants (208) Po and (209) Po and the development of alpha spectrometry showed that the yield was lower. Furthermore, the tendency of Po to volatilize at low temperatures constrains the sample preparation techniques; dry-ashing cannot be used. But during the wet-ashing procedure, there are still some losses. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the Po losses during wet-ashing by the use of a double-tracer technique. We have found that the losses were about 30 % when open glass beakers were used and about 17 % when the samples were digested in microwave oven. When long-necked bottles (Kjeldahl flasks) were used, a loss of about 20 % was registered. It has also been observed that (210) Pb to some extent is plating out together with its daughter nuclide Po during the electrochemical deposition. This will result in a systematic error since an unknown amount of supported (210) Po will be produced from the (210) Pb decay depending on the fraction of (210) Pb being deposited on the disc and the waiting time between deposition and measurement of the sample. A further consequence of this is that in the assessment of the (210) Pb content in the sample, very often the remaining liquid is stored after deposition for build-up of (210) Po. Since some (210) Pb is lost on the disc, the result for (210) Pb will be too low. Both these systematic errors give rise to a too high (210) Po/(210) Pb ratio. The fraction of (210) Pb which is plating out has been assessed in this study for different matrices and is about 50 - 90 %. During the measurement by solid state Si-detectors, some Po is evaporated in the vacuum conditions contaminating the detectors. Experiments have here been done by heating the discs after deposition which indicate that less Po is evaporated from Ag than from Ni. The losses from Ag are less than that from the other metals probably due to a deeper penetration into the surface of Po. We conclude that in most aspects, Ag is better to use than the other plating metals...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} ergodic [...] non-ergodic {{transition}} in a generalized Dicke model with independent co- and <b>counter</b> rotating light-matter <b>coupling</b> terms. By studying level statistics, the average ratio of consecutive level spacings, and the quantum butterfly effect (out-of-time correlation) as a dynamical probe, {{we show that}} the ergodic [...] non-ergodic transition in the Dicke model {{is a consequence of}} the proximity to the integrable limit of the model when one of the couplings is set to zero. This can be interpreted as a hint for the existence of a quantum analogue of the classical Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser theorem. Besides, we show that there is no intrinsic relation between the ergodic [...] non-ergodic transition and the precursors of the normal [...] superradiant quantum phase transition.

40|$|We propose {{scalable}} architectures for the coherence-preserving qubits {{introduced by}} Bacon, Brown, and Whaley [Phys. Rev. Lett. 87, 247902 (2001) ]. These architectures employ extra qubits providing additional {{degrees of freedom}} to the system. We show that these extra degrees of freedom {{can be used to}} <b>counter</b> errors in <b>coupling</b> strength within the coherence-preserving qubit and to combat interactions with environmental qubits. The presented architectures incorporate experimentally viable methods for inter-logical-qubit coupling and can implement a controlled phase gate via three simultaneous Heisenberg exchange operations. The extra qubits also provide flexibility in the arrangement of the physical qubits. Specifically, all physical qubits of a coherent-preserving qubit lattice can be placed in two spatial dimensions. Such an arrangement allows for universal cluster state computation. Comment: 4 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
40|$|The {{improved}} performance and electrodeposition behaviour of platinum baths containing [Pt(NH 3) 3 (N 02) ](N 02) and [Pt(NH 3) 4](X) (X= 2 CIP, 2 N 03 - and 2 N 02 -) complex species in phosphate buffer onto titanium is described. The cathode efficiency for each bath {{has been determined}} and compared. Structures of the deposited coatings were evaluated and discussed {{with the aid of}} SEM and XRD. The role of <b>counter</b> anions (X) <b>coupled</b> with pH was investigated. The study showed that electrolytes with X=N 02 exhibited higher plating efficiency in the pH range 10. 4 - 10. 6 containing phosphate buffer, demonstrating the selectivity for specific counter anions and pH range.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a time-to-digital converter (TDC) architecture capable of reaching high-precision and high-linearity with moderate area occupation per measurement channel. The architecture {{is based on}} a coarse <b>counter</b> and a <b>couple</b> of two-stage interpolators that exploit the cyclic sliding scale technique in order to improve the conversion linearity. The interpolators are based on a new coarse-fine synchronization circuit and a new single-stage Vernier delay loop fine interpolation. In a standard cost-effective 0. 35 mu m CMOS technology the TDC reaches a dynamic range of 160 ns, 17. 2 ps precision and differential non-linearity better than 0. 9 % LSB rms. The TDC building block was designed in order to be easily assembled in a multi-channel monolithic TDC chip. Coupled with a SPAD photodetector it is aimed for TCSPC applications (like FLIM, FCS, FRET) and direct ToF 3 -D rangin...|$|R
40|$|Secondary {{inorganic}} {{and organic}} aerosol particles are ubiquitous constituents in the atmosphere. They are largely produced through the photo-oxidation of gaseous precursor molecules, such as SO 2, NOx and VOCs, from both anthropogenic and natural sources. Once grown to atmospherically relevant sizes, they {{can act as}} cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and thus affect earth’s climate (IPCC, 2013). However, their chemical composition can vary considerably over their atmospheric lifetime (up to one week) {{as a result of}} which, their physico-chemical properties may change significantly due to chemical transformation processes (Jimenez et al., 2009). One of these properties is hygroscopicity, which largely depends on the chemical composition. Linking both, measured chemical composition and hygroscopicity helps to advance our current understanding of the hygroscopicity parametrisation. In this work we investigated how photochemical aging of the organic aerosol fraction and chemical reactions between inorganic and organic compounds can affect the hygroscopicity parameter κ (Petters and Kreidenweis, 2007). The measurements were conducted at the semi-rural Taunus Observatory/ Germany during summer 2012. An extensive suite of particle phase characterizing instrumentation was applied for the detailed composition analysis of submicron aerosol: We used online atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometry (APCI-MS) (Vogel et al., 2013), aerosol mass spectrometry (AMS), and filter sampling for laboratory based analysis using ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization ultrahigh resolution (OrbitrapTM) mass spectrometry (UHPLC/ESI-UHRMS). The AMS allows quantification of total organics, sulfate and nitrate, whereas the APCI-MS can identify single organic species (organic acids, organosulfates, nitrooxy-organosulfates), both at a high measurement frequencies (< 1 minute). The UHPLC/ESI-UHRMS analysis of filter samples provides vital information helping to understand the complex online spectra of the APCI-MS by the unambiguous determination of the elemental composition of different organic compounds. Furthermore, we used a MARGA (Monitor for Aerosols and Gases in Ambient Air) to measure the concentration of purely inorganic sulfate in PM 10. Finally a CCN <b>counter</b> <b>coupled</b> to a differential mobility analyser (DMA) and to a condensation particle counter (CPC) was used to measure size-resolved CCN efficiency spectra and to derive the hygroscopicity parameter κ. We determined the κ-value of the ambient aerosol from size resolved chemical composition measurements by the AMS and compared it to the measured values of the CCN efficiency spectra. The relative evolution of the aerosol aging was determined by measuring the ratio of two biogenic acids: the aging product 1, 2, 3 -methyl-butane-tricarboxylic acid (MBTCA) and the first generation oxidation product pinic acid by the online APCI-MS. The occurrence of organosulfates and nitrooxy-organosulfates was observed by the ultrahigh resolution MS analysis and the online APCI-MS. Comparison of the total sulfate concentration measured by the AMS with the sulfate measurements by the MARGA allowed for the determination of the fraction of sulfate which is bonded to organic molecules. We observed that photochemical aging and the formation of (hydrophobic) nitrooxy-organosulfates is responsible for the observed bias between the predicted and measured κ-value...|$|R
