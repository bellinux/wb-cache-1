40|$|In {{fiscal year}} 2008 - 9, more than 64, 000 hip and knee {{replacements}} and revisions were performed in Canada, representing almost 9 % of all surgical hospital discharges in that period. 1 The choice of dressing that {{is applied to}} the surgical wounds that result from these procedures may have an important impact on wound healing, through the prevention of blistering, maceration, and infection. 2 Given the large number of hip and knee arthroplasties performed in Canada on an annual basis, the choice of dressing could impact health outcomes as well as healthcare costs. While the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>dressings</b> may vary greatly, these costs should be evaluated in relation to dressing effectiveness as well – if some dressings require less frequent replacement or lead to fewer complications, their use may reduce other healthcare <b>costs.</b> A variety <b>of</b> surgical wound <b>dressings</b> are currently available including gauze, foam, bead, alginate, antimicrobial, semi-permeable films, hydrocolloid, and hydrogel. 3, 4 The present review was undertaken to explore and summarize the evidence for the clinical and cost-effectiveness <b>of</b> surgical wound <b>dressings</b> used in hip or knee arthroplasty, with the aim of informing decisions to optimize clinical practice.

40|$|Aim. To compare efficiency, safety, and <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> {{different}} treatment modalities. Materials and methods. The {{study included}} 40 patients with type 1 and 2 diabetes, foot and lower leg trophic ulcers at granulation stage I-II (Wagners classification) free from wound infection. The patients were randomized {{for the treatment}} during 2 months with a Biatain dressing (Coloplast, Denmark) (group 1) and for conventional treatment {{with the use of}} an atraumatic mesh dressing (group 2). Biatain dressings were changed every 2 - 4 (up to 5) days and conventional dressings once daily. Patients in the two groups were adjusted for age, sex, ulcer type, size and duration, length of antibiotic therapy before and during treatment, blood glucose level, and other characteristics (p> 0. 05). Results. Ulcers healed within 2 months in 70 % of the patients in group 1 and in 53. 3 % in group 2 (insignificant difference, p = 0. 48). Other efficiency (median healing time, survival curves) and safety parameters were not significantly different either. The <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> treatment by the two methods was comparable despite a higher <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> Biatain <b>dressings</b> due to their rarer change and economy of material for secondary dressing. When dressings were changed by medical professionals rather than by the patient or his (her) relatives at home, treatment with the use <b>of</b> Biatain <b>dressings</b> proved 1. 75 times cheaper. Conclusion. Efficiency and safety of high-tech and conventional dressing materials is comparable. The real difference between the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> treatment by either method is significantly smaller than the difference between retail prices of the two materials. <b>Cost</b> effectiveness <b>of</b> high-tech <b>dressings</b> is higher if the treatment is accomplished in a medical facility...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT BACKGROUND: Pressure ulcers, {{also known}} as bedsores, decubitus ulcers and {{pressure}} injuries, are localised areas of injury to the skin or the underlying tissue, or both. Dressings are widely used to treat pressure ulcers {{and there are many}} options to choose from including alginate dressings. A clear and current overview of current evidence is required to facilitate decision-making regarding dressing use for the treatment of pressure ulcers. This review is part of a suite of Cochrane reviews investigating the use <b>of</b> <b>dressings</b> in the treatment of pressure ulcers. Each review will focus on a particular dressing type. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects <b>of</b> alginate <b>dressings</b> for treating pressure ulcers in any care setting. METHODS: Search methods: For this review, in April 2015 we searched the following databases the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register; The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid EMBASE; and EBSCO CINAHL. There were no restrictions based on language or date of publication. Selection criteria: Published or unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effects of alginate with alternative wound dressings or no dressing in the treatment of pressure ulcers (stage II or above). Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction. MAIN RESULTS: We included six studies (336 participants) in this review; all studies had two arms. The included studies compared alginate dressings with six other interventions that included: hydrocolloid dressings, silver containing alginate dressings, and radiant heat therapy. Each of the six comparisons included just one study and these had limited participant numbers and short follow-up times. All the evidence was of low or very low quality. Where data were available {{there was no evidence of}} a difference between alginate dressings and alternative treatments in terms of complete wound healing or adverse events. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The relative effects <b>of</b> alginate <b>dressings</b> compared with alternative treatments are unclear. The existing trials are small, of short duration and at risk of bias. Decision makers may wish to consider aspects such as <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>dressings</b> and the wound management properties offered by each dressing type, for example, exudate management...|$|R
40|$|Background: Foot ulcers {{in people}} with {{diabetes}} mellitus are a common and serious global health issue. Dressings form {{a key part of}} ulcer treatment, with clinicians and patients having many different types to choose from. A clear and current overview of current evidence is required to facilitate decision-making regarding dressing use. Objectives: To summarize data from systematic reviews of randomised controlled trial evidence on the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>dressings</b> for healing foot ulcers {{in people with}} diabetes mellitus (DM). Methods: We searched the following databases for relevant systematic reviews and associated analyses: theCochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; The Cochrane Library 2015, Issue 2); Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE; The Cochrane Library 2015, Issue 1);OvidMEDLINE (In-Process&OtherNon-Indexed Citations, 14 April 2015); Ovid EMBASE (1980 to 14 April 2015). We also handsearched the Cochrane Wounds Group list of reviews. Two review authors independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction. Complete wound healing was the primary outcome assessed; secondary outcomes included health-related quality of life, adverse events, resource use and dressing performance. Main results: We found 13 eligible systematic reviews relevant to this overview that contained a total of 17 relevant RCTs. One review reported the results of a network meta-analysis and so presented information on indirect, as well as direct, treatment effects. Collectively the reviews reported findings for 11 different comparisons supported by direct data and 26 comparisons supported by indirect data only. Only four comparisons informed by direct data found evidence of a difference in wound healing between dressing types, but the evidence was assessed as being of low or very low quality (in one case data could not be located and checked). There was also no robust evidence of a difference between dressing types for any secondary outcomes assessed. Authors’ conclusions: There is currently no robust evidence for differences between wound dressings for any outcome in foot ulcers in people with diabetes (treated in any setting). Practitioners may want to consider the unit <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>dressings,</b> their management properties and patient preference when choosing dressings...|$|R

We {{conducted}} a prospective study {{to identify the}} direct hospitalization <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> managing major acute burns in Lagos, Nigeria, and to determine {{the factors that influence}} the cost. Method. All consecutive and consenting patients seen and managed for major burns at the National Orthopaedic Hospital, Igbobi, Lagos, between 1 June 2007 and 31 May 2008 were recruited for the study. A special form designed for the study was used to collect the necessary data. Results. Fifty-two patients were seen during the study period (27 males and 25 females). The ages ranged from 2 months to 69 yr with a mean of 25. 4 ± 17. 1 yr. The length of hospital stay ranged from 0. 3 - 12 months (mean, 3. 2 ± 3. 1 months). The average daily <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> treating a patient was ₦ (naira) 8, 855 (₦ 1000 = € 4. 44) and the average overall cost was ₦ 209, 303. 70, with the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> wound <b>dressings,</b> hospital admission, and surgery constituting respectively 29. 5 %, 25. 7 %, and 19. 1 % of the total amount spent.

Aims: To undertake {{an evaluation of the}} durability and associated <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> different CVC <b>dressings.</b> Methods: Dressing duration was captured prospectively using a pro forma on four different dressings on five critical care units over a 12 -month period. Staff received training on CVC dressing evidence-based practices and a ‘how to guide’ was implemented. Findings: A total <b>of</b> 1229 CVC <b>dressings</b> were observed from 590 CVCs. One dressing had a median (IQR) duration of 68. 5 h (range, 32 – 105 h) compared to a median duration of 43. 5, 46. 0 and 40. 5 h for the other dressings (P < 0. 001). The mean time to change a CVC dressing was 13. 5 min and the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> a dressing change was in the range of £ 1. 97 – 4. 97. During the 12 -month study period we observed a downward trend in CVC BSIs. Discussion: Despite few dressings remaining adherent for 7 days, the low rates of CVC BSI observed suggests good dressing practices.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this {{evidence-based}} project was to discover {{an effective way to}} decrease central-line associated bloodstream infections in patients within a hospital setting. Background: Central-line associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI) are primary bloodstream infections in patients that had a central line in place within 48 hours before the development of the infection. CLABSI are associated with significant morbidity and mortality and effective methods for their prevention are needed. Method: A search was conducted using CINAHL, Google Scholar, and Ovid Nursing Database for current research experiments and meta-analysis regarding the reduction of central-line infections. Results: The use <b>of</b> Chlorhexidine-impregnated <b>Dressings</b> significantly reduced CLABSI rates. With chlorhexidine-impregnated dressings, there is a significant benefit for prevention of catheter colonization, the adverse effects were also rare and minor. Conclusions: Research has proven chlorhexidine-impregnated dressings to lead prevention measures in the reduction on central line infections. Central-line hospital policies could be enhanced by adding the 3 M Tegaderm CHG dressing to clinical practice. Hospitals also benefit from these special dressings by saving money from the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> buying the <b>dressings</b> and the care it would take to treat a patient with an infection caused by a central line...|$|R
40|$|AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To {{study the}} {{material}} and nursing <b>costs</b> and outcome <b>of</b> wound care at home comparing two dressing groups (occlusive vs. gauze-based) in surgical patients after hospital dismissal. BACKGROUND: The large variety in dressing materials and lack of convincing evidence make the choice for optimum local wound care at home cumbersome. Occlusive wound dressings require a lower change frequency than gauze-based dressings, which appears especially useful for homecare patients and could save costs. METHODS: We investigated a consecutive series of 76 patients with wounds, included in a randomized trial comparing occlusive vs. gauze dressings. Daily dressing change frequency, consumption of dressing materials and need for district nursing visits were recorded until wound closure by means of diaries and at outpatient visits. Costs were expressed as means and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) after calculation using non-parametric bootstrapping. RESULTS: Patient groups were similar regarding age, wound size and aetiology. Dressing change frequency in the occlusive group (median: 0. 6 /day) was significantly (p = 0. 008) lower than in the gauze group (1. 1 /day). Mean daily material <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> modern <b>dressings</b> were euro 5. 31 vs. euro 0. 71 in the gauze group. Mean difference; euro 4. 60 (95 % CI, euro 2. 68 -euro 6. 83) while daily total (material plus nursing) costs showed {{no difference between the}} groups; mean euro 2. 86 (95 % CI, euro- 6. 50 -euro 10. 25). Wound healing in the gauze-treated group tended to be quicker than in the occlusive dressing group (medians: 30 vs. 48 days, respectively; log-rank p = 0. 060). CONCLUSIONS: The use <b>of</b> occlusive <b>dressings</b> does not lead to a reduction in costs and wound healing time as compared with gauze dressings for surgical patients receiving wound care at home. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: District nurses should reconsider using gauze-based dressings, particularly in surgical patients with exudating wound...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Negative-pressure wound {{therapy has}} been widely adopted to reduce the {{complexity}} of treating {{a broad range of}} acute and chronic wounds. However, its cost is high. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the following two different methods of negative-pressure wound therapy in terms of healing time: a low-cost method of negative-pressure wound therapy (a pressure stabilizer device connected to a hospital wall-vacuum system with a gauze-sealed dressing, USP) and the standard of care (vacuum-assisted closure, VAC). METHODS: This is a randomized, controlled, non-inferiority, unblinded trial. Patients admitted with complex injuries to a trauma center in a public referral hospital who were indicated for orthopedic surgery were randomized to a USP or VAC group. The primary outcome was the time required to achieve a “ready for surgery condition”, which was defined as a wound bed with healthy granulation tissue and without necrosis or purulent secretion. Wound bed area contraction, granulation tissue growth and the direct <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> the <b>dressings</b> were secondary outcomes. RESULTS: Variation in area and granulation tissue growth were essentially the same between the systems, and healing time was equal between the groups (p= 0. 379). In both systems, serial debridement increased wound area (p= 0. 934), and granulation tissue was also increased (p= 0. 408). The mean treatment cost was US$ 15. 15 in the USP group and US$ 872. 59 in the VAC group.

The {{aim of this}} retrospective cohort {{study was to determine the}} {{intensive care}} unit costs for burn patients compared with nonburn patients matched for length of stay and severity of illness. The patient record was reviewed to compare costs associated with expendables (medications and fluids), investigations (laboratory and radiological tests), and physiotherapy sessions in 13 burn patients and 13 nonburn controls. Medical and nursing staff costs could not be differentially determined between groups. The <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> wound <b>dressings</b> were estimated for burn patients. The mean daily <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> burn patients was Australian dollars (AUD) 700. 74 and AUD 697. 99 for nonburn controls (P =. 97), with an additional AUD 1411 estimated for nursing and medical staffing. There was no significant difference in the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> expendables or laboratory tests between the groups. The largest drug and laboratory costs in both cases and controls were attributed to the use of meropenem and intravenous antifungals (25 % and 30 %, respectively) and arterial blood gas analysis (31 % and 27 %, respectively). Analgesics, anxiolytics, and sedatives costed AUD 21. 58 more per day in burn patients than in controls (P =. 054). Physiotherapy costs were AUD 18. 62 higher per day in burn patients (P =. 028), whereas radiology costs were AUD 108. 10 higher in the control group (P =. 001). Burn dressings costed AUD 120. 77 per day. The authors found no significant difference in the mean daily intensive care unit <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> burn patients compared with controls matched for length of stay and acuity. However, physiotherapy and dressing costs were higher in burn patients, and there was a trend to increase costs associated with analgesic/anxiolytic/sedative medications.

Pressure ulcers have significant impact on emotional and physical wellbeing, quality of life, and health care <b>costs.</b> The use <b>of</b> wound <b>dressings</b> could be an important and cost-effective strategy in preventing pressure ulcers. The main types <b>of</b> <b>dressings</b> that are examined for this purpose in the literature are foam, hydrocolloid, and films. Some small studies have shown a preventative role for sacral dressings with low-shear backings, though they raise concerns about over-hydration of the skin.

40|$|Ultrasound {{has been}} used for the {{treatment}} of a variety of cutaneous wounds, particularly venous ulcers. Many of the published studies involved application of ultrasound to the surrounding tissue rather than directly over the wound. Insonating the wound itself may enhance the healing process, but the lack of data regarding the transmission characteristics <b>of</b> <b>dressings</b> has limited the use of this option. This study aimed to measure the ultrasound transmissivity <b>of</b> <b>dressings</b> commonly employed for wound management. Forty-eight different dressings and wound care products were tested in vitro using a radiation force balance. Transmissivity was found to vary significantly between dressings, from excellent to zero. These findings may be useful to clinicians in deciding whether to apply ultrasound through a particular dressing. They could also inform future studies of the efficacy of ultrasound in wound management by application directly to wounds rather than to their periphery...|$|R

40|$|BackgroundThe use {{of mineral}} (clay) or {{biologic}} (chitosan) materials has improved the efficacy <b>of</b> <b>dressings</b> {{used in the}} bleeding control of noncompressible areas. A series of novel manufactured products already evaluated in a vascular transection model was further compared in a severe vascular puncture injury model. MethodsTen hemostatic dressings were tested in anesthetized Yorkshire swine hemorrhaged for 45 seconds in a femoral arterial puncture model. Application <b>of</b> these <b>dressings</b> was followed by 5 minutes of compression (about 175 mm Hg), and at 15 minutes, 500 mL resuscitation fluid (Hextand) was infused during a 30 -minute period. The animals were monitored for a 3 -hour experimental observation period. Primary outcomes were incidence of bleeding after dressing application and animal survival. ResultsBlood loss was 18. 8 % ± 5. 2 % estimated blood volume (EBV) after 45 seconds of free bleeding. Relative performance <b>of</b> <b>dressings</b> is characterized as groups <b>of</b> <b>dressings</b> that performed similarly. Recurrence of bleeding after application was observed with most dressings and was lower with Woundstat, Celox, X-Sponge, and ACS+ (35 % ± 49 %) compared with FP- 21, Hemcon, Chitoflex, and Bloodstop (79 % ± 43 %; P <. 01). Blood loss after treatment was 25. 3 % ± 18. 4 % EBV for the top four dressings and 53. 0 % ± 18. 4 % EBV for the bottom four (P <. 05). Survival was higher for top four vs bottom four dressings (78 % ± 12 % vs 25 % ± 0 %, respectively; P <. 01). Overall performance <b>of</b> these <b>dressings</b> according to survival, incidence of bleeding, and post-treatment blood loss, yielded similar ranking as with a previously tested transection injury model. ConclusionsThe findings indicated that the efficacy of Woundstat, Celox, X-Sponge, and ACS+ were similar and superior in improving survival, hemostasis, and maintenance of mean arterial pressure in an actively bleeding wound caused in this severe vascular injury model. Clinical RelevanceMajor improvements {{have been made in}} the development <b>of</b> novel <b>dressings</b> with hemostatic properties to control heavy bleeding in noncompressible areas. Hemostatic dressings offer promise in the military and civilian surgical environment for hemorrhage control in difficult situations. This animal-based study identified dressings with good absorption and good clotting abilities that ranked superior in terms of control of rebleeding. Also, these dressings might be beneficial in well-attended or remote surgical theaters as well as for first aid bandaging in extreme sport...|$|R
