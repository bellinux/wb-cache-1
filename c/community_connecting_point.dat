This in turn impacts up{{on the quality of}} schooling offered to indigenous young people which affects both their academic and social success. Story Writing in Remote Locations (SWIRL) is one program that provides preservice teachers with a range of opportunities to experience and teach in remote indigenous settings. Offered by Victoria University, Melbourne, Australia, the SWIRL program provides preservice teachers, staff, community members and indigenous participants with an alternative approach to dealing with engagement in literacy and ICT learning.
