40|$|Following subarachnoid hemorrhage, a {{considerable}} number of cases develop disturbances of cerebrospinal fluid dynamics. The author studied the criteria of indication of <b>cerebrospinal</b> <b>fluid</b> <b>shunting</b> operation in clinical cases of subarachnoid hemorrhage following the rupture of intracranial aneurysm. The author conducted (169) Yb-DTPA cisternography in 34 patients with ruptured intracranial aneurysm, and 0. 3 - 0. 5 mCi of (169) Yb-DTPA was injected by lumbar puncture. Brain scintigrams were taken in various projections at 1, 2, 6, 24 and 48 hours, {{and at the same time}} blood was withdrawn at regular intervals up to the 6 th hour. Then, the transport of (169) Yb-DTPA from the subarachnoid space to the blood was evaluated. Twenty-six cases out of 34 developed disturbance in cerebrospinal fluid dynamics with reflux of (169) Yb-DTPA to the ventricles. Studying further these cases the blood (169) Yb-DTPA concentration curve within the period of 1 - 2 hours after (169) Yb-DTPA injection by lumbar puncture, is likely to reflect the (169) Yb-DTPA transport from the intrathecal subarachnoid space to the blood, but cases in which (169) Yb-DTPA absorption from the intrathecal space was poor, had the dilatation of the cerebral ventricles, while those with good absorption except one case had no dilatation. Cases with moderate to marked degree of dilatation of the ventricles, were accompanied with mental, gait disturbance and incontinence, and they were taken the <b>cerebrospinal</b> <b>fluid</b> <b>shunting</b> operation. Cases in which complete lack of cerebral convexity filling of (169) Yb-DTPA was seen in 24 -hour scintigram, were clinically benefited, while cases in which both ventricular dilatation and stasis were seen and moreover convexity filling was observed, were not benefited by shunting operation. From these findings, the considerable dilatation of the ventricles, the ventricular stasis and the complete lack of convexity filling of (169) Yb-DTPA at 24 hours in cisternography, and the malabsorption of cerebrospinal fluid in the intracranial as well as intrathecal space are reliable criteria in determining the indication of the <b>cerebrospinal</b> <b>fluid</b> <b>shunting</b> operation for the patients with specific clinical symptoms...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Infection {{is a major}} {{complication}} of <b>cerebrospinal</b> <b>fluid</b> <b>shunting</b> procedures. The present report assesses the efficacy of such catheters in both shunts and external ventricular drains (EVDs) against infection and particularly against Staphylococcus spp. infection. Methods All shunt and EVD procedures performed by means of antibiotic-impregnated catheters (AICs) and non-AICs {{during the period of}} study were registered. In cases of shunt procedures, a minimal follow-up of 90 days was considered, as well as de novo insertion and catheter revisions. Single valve revisions were not included. In cases of EVD procedures, those catheters removed before the fifth post-insertion day were not included. A total of 119 <b>cerebrospinal</b> <b>fluid</b> <b>shunting</b> procedures performed with AICs were studied in comparison with 112 procedures performed by means of non-AICs. Results Antibiotic-impregnated catheters were associated with a significant decrease in both overall and staphylococcal infection (p = 0. 030 and p = 0. 045, respectively). The number needed to treat for AICs was 8 to prevent one infection and 14 to prevent one staphylococcal infection. When comparing with shunts, the use of EVDs was associated with a 37 -fold increased likelihood of infection. Conclusions Antibiotic-impregnated catheters are a safe and helpful tool to reduce CSF shunting device-related infections. </p...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Ventricular shunt-induced {{craniosynostosis}} is {{a widely}} recognised cause of secondary craniosynostosis. We reviewed the management and long-term outcome of the cases of cranial deformity post <b>cerebrospinal</b> <b>fluid</b> <b>shunting</b> in our unit and compared these with previously published series. Methods: The Australian Craniofacial Unit and Department of Neurosurgery database was searched to identify cases of ventricular shunt-induced cranial deformity and a case note review was undertaken. Results: Eight cases were identified, and all were shunted within 6 months of birth. Our patients required shunting with a low pressure valve for hydrocephalus secondary to either aqueduct stenosis or intraventricular haemorrhage. The diagnosis was made following computed tomography (CT) three-dimensional surface reconstruction of the skull. Two cases of confirmed suture fusion were treated with cranial vault remodelling and programmable shunt insertion. In six cases, the sutures were not completely fused on the CT images despite a scaphocephalic head shape. These patients were managed conservatively with close monitoring.

40|$|Normal {{pressure}} hydrocephalus {{consists in}} a clinical presentation of a gait disturbance, incontinence and dementia. Sixty three patients (aged 17 to 82) with diagnosis confirmed by tomodensitometry and isotope cistemography underwent a pre and postoperation neuropsychological evaluation. Behavioral mood and cognitive dysfunction were demonstrated. In most cases, mental deterioration was typical of a frontal syndrome (attention impairment: 98 %; loss of memory: 97 %; writing difficulties: 90 %; dyscalculia 84 %; visuoconstructive apraxia: 79 %; bradypsychy: 78 %; apragmatism: 63 %; anosognosia: 52 %; alexia: 52 %; speech disturbances: 41 %, emotional indifference: 33 %). After <b>cerebrospinal</b> <b>fluid</b> <b>shunting,</b> clinical improvement was observed in 33 patients (52 %). Apart from a reduction in ventricular size, we found a regression of several behavioral, mood and cognitive dysfunctions. The main neuropsychological improvements were referred to functions related to communication, spontaneous activity, initiatives and planning. Even when ventricular enlargement may involve an underlying general brain damage, our results showed a dysfunction in the frontal area where the above mentioned neurobehavioral dysfunctions are mainly localized.

40|$|We {{measured}} {{the volume of}} the supratentorial ventricles in 39 consecutive children with myelomeningocele (MMC) and associated hydrocephalus, using a stereological method based on the Cavalieri theorem of systematic sampling. We distinguished the following groups: newborns before and after <b>cerebrospinal</b> <b>fluid</b> <b>shunting</b> (14), a somewhat larger group of newborns with an untreated MMC-associated hydrocephalus (25) and a group of shunted children at a mean age of 1. 5 years (28). We paid special attention to the shape of the lateral ventricles, looking separately at the anterior and posterior halves. The measurements were compared with a healthy control group (10) and with children with hydrocephalus unrelated to MMC (15). The average volume ratio of the posterior to the anterior half of the lateral ventricles was 1. 05 +/- 0. 39 in non-hydrocephalic children, 1. 11 +/- 0. 55 in untreated hydrocephalic children without MMC, and 2. 15 +/- 0. 65 in MMC-associated hydrocephalus prior to shunting. These ratios did not change significantly after shunting. This confirms our impression that MMC-associated hydrocephalus shows a characteristic shape, with a disproportionate enlargement of the posterior part of the lateral ventricles, in clear contrast to the normal-width frontal horns. This shape is reminiscent of the fetal ventricular shape. It reveals disturbance of brain development in children with MMC, which goes beyond the classic description of the Chiari malformation...|$|E
30|$|A {{thorough}} {{review of}} the preoperative clinical and radiological data for all enrolled patients was performed. Each one of the operated patients had his/her surgery done under general anesthesia in the supine position through a formal frontal (or parietal in two cases) craniotomy {{on the right side}} whenever applicable. A surgical corridor was created through the anterior part of the middle frontal gyrus heading posteromedial with a slight caudal inclination towards the tip of the frontal horn of the ipsilateral ventricular cavity where the tumor was identified and removed with maximum care not to violate any normal neural tissue. In cases of posteriorly located tumors, a posterior parietal approach was used to approach the tumor through the occipital horn of the ipsilateral ventricle. Whenever safe, gross total resection was performed; otherwise, tumor debulking was considered in cases where gross total resection was not applicable. Meticulous hemostasis was always performed and sought for due to the vascular nature of such tumors and high rates of intraoperative and/or postoperative bleeds. In cases where preemptive cerebrospinal fluid diversion was not done, an intraventricular catheter was left behind for at least 72  h postoperatively for temporary cerebrospinal fluid drainage. However, testing for the need for a permanent <b>cerebrospinal</b> <b>fluid</b> <b>shunting</b> was done prior to catheter removal via temporary closure of the catheter with a concomitant close observation of the patient’s status.|$|E

Anesthesia was induced intravenously with propofol 1. 5 mg kg(- 1) and sufentanil 0. 15 - 0. 3 mu g kg(- 1). Tracheal intubation was facilitated with atracurium 0. 5 mg kg(- 1). Anesthesia was maintained with a continuous propofol infusion at an increasing rate from 6 to 12 mg kg(- 1) h(- 1) under controlled ventilation (FiO(2) = 0. 4 in air). In all patients, arterial blood samples were drawn before induction of anesthesia and during surgery for measurement of blood propofol concentration and plasma antioxidant capacity, which was assessed {{as the ability to}} inhibit lipid peroxidation, Lipid peroxidation was induced in vitro by exposing a linoleic acid microemulsion to hemoglobin-generated oxoferryl radicals, and assessed by ultraweak chemiluminescence in the absence (central) and the presence of the plasma samples. The antioxidant capacity of plasma, measured by the inhibition of Light emission and expressed as a percentage of control, increased significantly from 39. 8 +/- 2 % (mean +/- SEM) to 44. 7 +/- 2. 4 % during anesthesia (Wilcoxon test, p < 0. 001), No correlation was observed between this increased resistance to lipid peroxidation and blood propofol concentrations (Spearman test, r = 0. 07, NS).
