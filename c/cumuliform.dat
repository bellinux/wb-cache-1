5|$|A {{waterspout}} is a columnar vortex forming {{over water}} that is, {{in its most}} common form, a non-supercell tornado over water that is connected to a <b>cumuliform</b> cloud. While it is often weaker than most of its land counterparts, stronger versions spawned by mesocyclones do occur.|$|E
5|$|A {{waterspout}} is {{an intense}} columnar vortex (usually appearing as a funnel-shaped cloud) that occurs over {{a body of}} water. Some are connected to a cumulus congestus cloud, some to a <b>cumuliform</b> cloud and some to a cumulonimbus cloud. In the common form, it is a non-supercell tornado over water.|$|E
5|$|Cumulus {{clouds are}} often {{precursors}} of {{other types of}} cloud, such as cumulonimbus, when influenced by weather factors such as instability, moisture, and temperature gradient. Normally, cumulus clouds produce little or no precipitation, but they can grow into the precipitation-bearing congestus or cumulonimbus clouds. Cumulus clouds can be formed from water vapor, supercooled water droplets, or ice crystals, depending upon the ambient temperature. They come in many distinct subforms, and generally cool the earth by reflecting the incoming solar radiation. Cumulus clouds are part of the larger category of free-convective <b>cumuliform</b> clouds, which include cumulonimbus clouds. The latter genus-type is sometimes categorized separately as cumulonimbiform due to its more complex structure that often includes a cirriform or anvil top. There are also <b>cumuliform</b> clouds of limited convection that comprise stratocumulus (low-), altocumulus (middle-étage) and cirrocumulus. (high-étage). These last three genus-types are sometimes classified separately as stratocumuliform.|$|E
5|$|Small-scale, tornado-like circulations {{can occur}} near any intense surface heat source. Those that occur near intense {{wildfires}} are called fire whirls. They {{are not considered}} tornadoes, except in the rare case where they connect to a pyrocumulus or other <b>cumuliform</b> cloud above. Fire whirls usually are {{not as strong as}} tornadoes associated with thunderstorms. They can, however, produce significant damage.|$|E
5|$|There is some {{disagreement}} over {{the definition of}} a funnel cloud and a condensation funnel. According to the Glossary of Meteorology, a funnel cloud is any rotating cloud pendant from a cumulus or cumulonimbus, and thus most tornadoes are included under this definition. Among many meteorologists, the 'funnel cloud' term is strictly defined as a rotating cloud which is not associated with strong winds at the surface, and condensation funnel is a broad term for any rotating cloud below a <b>cumuliform</b> cloud.|$|E
5|$|A {{stratocumulus}} cloud {{is another}} type of a <b>cumuliform</b> or stratocumuliform cloud. Like cumulus clouds, they form at low levels and via convection. However, unlike cumulus clouds, their growth is almost completely retarded by a strong inversion. As a result, they flatten out like stratus clouds, giving them a layered appearance. These clouds are extremely common, covering on average around twenty-three percent of the earth's oceans and twelve percent of the earth's continents. They are less common in tropical areas and commonly form after cold fronts. Additionally, stratocumulus clouds reflect {{a large amount of}} the incoming sunlight, producing a net cooling effect. Stratocumulus clouds can produce drizzle, which stabilizes the cloud by warming it and reducing turbulent mixing. Being a cloud of limited convection, stratocumulus is divided into three species; stratiformis, lenticularis, and castellanus, that are common to the higher stratocumuliform genus-types.|$|E
5|$|Cirrus {{comes in}} four {{distinct}} species; Cirrus castellanus, fibratus, spissatus, and uncinus; which are each {{divided into four}} varieties: intortus, vertebratus, radiatus, and duplicatus. Cirrus castellanus is a species that has <b>cumuliform</b> tops caused by high-altitude convection rising up from the main cloud body. Cirrus fibratus looks striated and {{is the most common}} cirrus species. Cirrus uncinus clouds are hooked and are the form that is usually called mare's tails. Of the varieties, Cirrus intortus has an extremely contorted shape, and cirrus radiatus has large, radial bands of cirrus clouds that stretch across the sky. Kelvin–Helmholtz waves are a form of cirrus intortus that has been twisted into loops by vertical wind shear.|$|E
5|$|Cirrocumulus clouds form in {{patches and}} cannot cast shadows. They {{commonly}} appear in regular, rippling patterns or in rows of clouds with clear areas between. Cirrocumulus are, like {{other members of}} the <b>cumuliform</b> and stratocumuliform categories, formed via convective processes. Significant growth of these patches indicates high-altitude instability and can signal the approach of poorer weather. The ice crystals in the bottoms of cirrocumulus clouds tend to be in the form of hexagonal cylinders. They are not solid, but instead tend to have stepped funnels coming in from the ends. Towards the top of the cloud, these crystals have a tendency to clump together. These clouds do not last long, and they tend to change into cirrus because as the water vapor continues to deposit on the ice crystals, they eventually begin to fall, destroying the upward convection. The cloud then dissipates into cirrus. Cirrocumulus clouds come in four species which are common to all three genus-types that have limited-convective or stratocumuliform characteristics: stratiformis, lenticularis, castellanus, and floccus. They are iridescent when the constituent supercooled water droplets are all about the same size.|$|E
5|$|Cirrocumulus clouds form {{in sheets}} or patches {{and do not}} cast shadows. They {{commonly}} appear in regular, rippling patterns or in rows of clouds with clear areas between.

5|$|Dew {{point is}} the {{temperature}} to which a given parcel of air must be cooled, at constant atmospheric pressure, for water vapor to condense into water. The condensed water is called dew. The dew point is a saturation point. When the dew point temperature falls below freezing {{it is called the}} frost point, as the water vapor no longer creates dew but instead creates frost or hoarfrost by deposition. The dew point is associated with relative humidity. A high relative humidity indicates that the dew point is closer to the current air temperature. If the relative humidity is 100%, the dew point is equal to the current temperature. Given a constant dew point, an increase in temperature will lead to a decrease in relative humidity. At a given barometric pressure, independent of temperature, the dew point determines the specific humidity of the air. The dew point is an important statistic for general aviation pilots, as it is used to calculate the likelihood of carburetor icing and fog. When used with the air temperature, a formula can be used to estimate the height of <b>cumuliform,</b> or convective, clouds.|$|E
25|$|These {{are small}} {{detached}} fair-weather <b>cumuliform</b> clouds that have nearly horizontal bases and flattened tops, {{and do not}} produce rain showers.|$|E
25|$|Clouds of this {{structure}} have both <b>cumuliform</b> and stratiform characteristics {{in the form}} of rolls, ripples, or patches. They generally form as a result of limited convection in an otherwise mostly stable airmass topped by an inversion layer. If the inversion layer is absent or higher in the troposphere, increased convective activity may cause the cloud layers to develop tops {{in the form of}} turrets consisting of embedded <b>cumuliform</b> buildups. The stratocumuliform group is divided into cirrocumulus (high-level), altocumulus (mid-level), and stratocumulus (low-level).|$|E
25|$|The species fractus shows {{variable}} instability {{because it}} can be a subdivision of genus-types of different physical forms that have different stability characteristics. This subtype can be in the form of ragged but mostly stable stratiform sheets (stratus fractus) or small ragged <b>cumuliform</b> heaps with somewhat greater instability (cumulus fractus). When they form at low altitudes, stratiform and <b>cumuliform</b> genus-types can be torn up into shreds by brisk low level winds that create mechanical turbulence against the ground. Fractus clouds can form in precipitation at low altitudes, with or without brisk or gusty winds. They are closely associated with precipitating cloud systems of considerable vertical and sometimes horizontal extent, so they are also classified as accessory clouds under the name pannus (see section on supplementary features).|$|E
25|$|Frontal and {{cyclonic}} lift {{occur when}} stable air is forced aloft at weather fronts and around centers of low pressure. Warm fronts associated with extratropical cyclones tend to generate mostly cirriform and stratiform clouds {{over a wide}} area unless the approaching warm airmass is unstable, in which case cumulus congestus or cumulonimbus clouds will usually be embedded in the main precipitating cloud layer. Cold fronts are usually faster moving and generate a narrower line of clouds which are mostly stratocumuliform, <b>cumuliform,</b> or cumulonimbiform depending on {{the stability of the}} warm air mass just ahead of the front.|$|E
500|$|Cumulus {{clouds are}} a genus of free-convective low-étage cloud {{along with the}} related limited-convective <b>cumuliform</b> or stratocumuliform cloud stratocumulus. These clouds form from ground level to [...] at all latitudes. Stratus clouds are also low-étage. In the middle étage are the alto clouds, which consist of the limiited-convective <b>cumuliform</b> or stratocumuliform cloud {{altocumulus}} and the stratiform cloud altostratus. Middle-étage clouds form from [...] to [...] in polar areas, [...] in temperate areas, and [...] in tropical areas. The high-étage clouds are all cirriform, one of which, cirrocumulus, is also <b>cumuliform</b> of limited convection or stratocumuliform. The other clouds in this étage are cirrus and cirrostratus. High-étage clouds form [...] in high latitudes, [...] in temperate latitudes, and [...] in low, tropical latitudes. Cumulonimbus clouds, like cumulus congestus, extend vertically rather than remaining confined to one étage.|$|E
500|$|A tornado is [...] "a violently {{rotating}} {{column of}} air, {{in contact with}} the ground, either pendant from a <b>cumuliform</b> cloud or underneath a <b>cumuliform</b> cloud, and often (but not always) visible as a funnel cloud". For a vortex to be classified as a tornado, it must be in contact with both the ground and the cloud base. Scientists have not yet created a complete definition of the word; for example, there is disagreement as to whether separate touchdowns of the same funnel constitute separate tornadoes. Tornado refers to the vortex of wind, not the condensation cloud.|$|E
500|$|Some <b>cumuliform</b> clouds {{have been}} {{discovered}} on most other planets in the solar system. On Mars, the Viking Orbiter detected cirrocumulus and stratocumulus clouds forming via convection primarily near the polar icecaps. The Galileo space probe detected massive cumulonimbus clouds near the Great Red Spot on Jupiter. <b>Cumuliform</b> clouds have also been detected on Saturn. In 2008, the Cassini spacecraft determined that cumulus clouds near Saturn's south pole {{were part of a}} cyclone over [...] in diameter. The Keck Observatory detected whitish cumulus clouds on Uranus. Like Uranus, Neptune has methane cumulus clouds. Venus, however, {{does not appear to have}} cumulus clouds.|$|E
500|$|There {{are three}} main genera {{in the family}} of high clouds: cirrus, cirrocumulus, and cirrostratus. Cirrostratus clouds {{commonly}} produce halos because they are composed almost entirely of ice crystals. Cirrocumulus and cirrostratus are sometimes informally referred to as [...] "cirriform clouds" [...] because of their frequent association with cirrus. They are given the prefix [...] "cirro-", but this refers more to their altitude range than their physical structure. Cirrocumulus in its pure form is actually a high <b>cumuliform</b> genus, and cirrostratus is stratiform, like altostratus and lower based sheet clouds.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "edge" [...] of the outflow {{boundary}} {{can often}} be detected by Doppler radar (especially in clear air mode). [...] Convergence occurs along {{the leading edge of}} the [...] downdraft. [...] Convergence of dust, aerosols, and bugs at the leading edge will lead to a higher clear air signature. [...] Insects and arthropods are swept along by the prevailing winds, making them good indicators of the presence of outflow boundaries. [...] The signature of the leading edge is also influenced by the density change between the cooler air from the downdraft and the warmer environmental air. [...] This density boundary will increase the number of echo returns from the leading edge. [...] Clouds and new thunderstorms also develop along the outflow's leading edge. [...] This makes it possible to locate the outflow boundary when using precipitation mode on a weather radar. [...] Also, it makes outflow boundaries findable within visible satellite imagery as a thin line of <b>cumuliform</b> clouds which is known as an arcus, or arc, cloud. [...] The image to the right depicts a particularly strong ouflow boundary ahead of a line of storms. [...] Often, the outflow boundary will bow in the direction it is moving the quickest.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Cumuliform</b> clouds {{generally}} {{appear in}} isolated heaps or tufts. [...] They {{are the product}} of localized but generally free-convective lift where there are no inversion layers in the atmosphere to limit vertical growth. In general, small <b>cumuliform</b> clouds tend to indicate comparatively weak instability. [...] Larger <b>cumuliform</b> types are a sign of moderate to strong atmospheric instability and convective activity. Depending on their vertical size, clouds of the cumulus genus type may be low-level or multi-level with moderate to towering vertical extent.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{agent is}} the {{convective}} upward motion of air caused by daytime solar heating at surface level. [...] Airmass instability {{allows for the}} formation of <b>cumuliform</b> clouds that can produce showers if the air is sufficiently moist. [...] On comparatively rare occasions, convective lift can be powerful enough to penetrate the tropopause and push the cloud top into the stratosphere.|$|E
2500|$|These clouds {{have low}} to middle level bases that form {{anywhere}} from near surface to about [...] and tops that can extend {{into the high}} altitude range. [...] Nimbostratus and some cumulus in this group usually achieve moderate or deep vertical extent, but without towering structure. [...] However, with sufficient airmass instability, upward-growing <b>cumuliform</b> clouds can grow to high towering proportions. [...] Although genus types with vertical extent are often informally considered a single group, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) distinguishes towering vertical clouds more formally as a separate group or sub-group. [...] It is specified that these very large <b>cumuliform</b> and cumulonimbiform types must be identified by their standard names or abbreviations in all aviation observations (METARS) and forecasts (TAFS) to warn pilots of possible severe weather and turbulence. [...] Multi-level clouds are of even larger structure than low clouds, and are therefore identifiable by their forms and genera, (and even species {{in the case of}} cumulus congestus) using satellite photography.|$|E
2500|$|These {{species are}} subdivisions of genus types {{that occur in}} partly {{unstable}} air. The species castellanus appears when a mostly stable stratocumuliform or cirriform layer becomes disturbed by localized areas of airmass instability, usually {{in the morning or}} afternoon. This results in the formation of <b>cumuliform</b> buildups arising from a common stratiform base. Castellanus resembles the turrets of a castle when viewed from the side, and can be found with stratocumuliform genera at any tropospheric altitude level and with limited-convective patches of high-level cirrus. Tufted clouds of the more detached floccus species are subdivisions of genus-types which may be cirriform or stratocumuliform in overall structure. They are sometimes seen with cirrus, and with tufted cirrocumulus, altocumulus, and stratocumulus. [...] Low and mid level castellanus or floccus can resemble cumulo- and cumulonimbogenitus formations (see 'Mother clouds' section). [...] However, the latter genitus types are seen mostly in the evening and are the result of <b>cumuliform</b> and cumulonimbiform clouds dissipating rather than forming or building.|$|E
2500|$|These <b>cumuliform</b> {{clouds of}} free {{convection}} have clear-cut medium-grey flat bases and white domed tops {{in the form}} of small sproutings and generally do not produce precipitation. [...] They usually form in the low level of the troposphere except during conditions of very low relative humidity when the clouds bases can rise into the middle altitude range. [...] Moderate cumulus is officially classified as low-level and more informally characterized as having vertical extent that can involve more than one altitude level.|$|E
2500|$|Cloud cover {{has been}} seen on most other planets in the solar system. Venus's thick clouds are {{composed}} of sulfur dioxide (due to volcanic activity) and appear to be almost entirely stratiform. They are arranged in three main layers at altitudes of 45 to 65km that obscure the planet's surface and can produce virga. No embedded <b>cumuliform</b> types have been identified, but broken stratocumuliform wave formations are sometimes seen in the top layer that reveal more continuous layer clouds underneath. [...] On Mars, noctilucent, cirrus, cirrocumulus and stratocumulus composed of water-ice have been detected mostly near the poles. [...] Water-ice fogs have also been detected on Mars.|$|E
2500|$|A {{group of}} {{accessory}} clouds comprise formations {{that are associated}} mainly with upward-growing <b>cumuliform</b> and cumulonimbiform clouds of free convection. Pileus is a cap cloud that can form over a cumulonimbus or large cumulus cloud, whereas a velum feature is a thin horizontal sheet that sometimes forms like an apron around the middle or {{in front of the}} parent cloud. [...] An accessory cloud recently officially recognized the World meteorological Organization is the flumen, also known more informally as the beaver's tail. It is formed by the warm, humid inflow of a super-cell thunderstorm, and can be mistaken for a tornado. Although the flumen can indicate a tornado risk, it is similar in appearance to pannus or scud clouds and does not rotate.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{two methods}} of naming clouds in their {{respective}} layers of the atmosphere; Latin and common. [...] Cloud types in the troposphere, the atmospheric layer closest to Earth's surface, have Latin names due to the universal adaptation of Luke Howard's nomenclature. Formally proposed in 1802, it became {{the basis of a}} modern international system that divides clouds into five physical forms that appear in any or all of three altitude levels (formerly known as étages). [...] These physical types, in approximate ascending order of convective activity, include stratiform sheets, cirriform wisps and patches, stratocumuliform layers (mainly structured as rolls, ripples, and patches), <b>cumuliform</b> heaps, and very large cumulonimbiform heaps that often show complex structure. [...] The physical forms are divided by altitude level into ten basic genus-types. [...] The Latin names for applicable high-level genera carry a cirro- prefix, and an alto- prefix is added to the names of the mid-level genus-types. [...] Most of the genera can be subdivided into species and further subdivided into varieties.|$|E
2500|$|This is a diffuse dark-grey non-convective {{stratiform}} layer {{with great}} horizontal extent and moderate to deep vertical development. [...] It lacks towering structure and looks feebly illuminated from the inside. Nimbostratus normally forms from mid-level altostratus, and develops at least moderate vertical extent when the base subsides into {{the low level}} during precipitation that can reach moderate to heavy intensity. [...] It commonly achieves deep vertical development when it simultaneously grows upward into the high level due to large scale frontal or cyclonic lift. [...] The nimbo- prefix refers to its ability to produce continuous rain or snow over a wide area, especially ahead of a warm front. This thick cloud layer may be accompanied by embedded towering <b>cumuliform</b> or cumulonimbiform types. [...] Meteorologists affiliated with the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) officially classify nimbostratus as mid-level for synoptic purposes while informally characterizing it as multi-level. [...] Independent meteorologists and educators appear split between those who largely follow the WMO model and those who classify nimbostratus as low-level, despite its considerable vertical extent and its usual initial formation in the middle altitude range.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the local}} {{distribution}} of clouds can be significantly influenced by topography, the global prevalence of cloud cover tends to vary more by latitude. [...] It is most prevalent globally in and along low pressure zones of surface atmospheric convergence which encircle the Earth {{close to the}} equator and near the 50th parallels of latitude in {{the northern and southern}} hemispheres. [...] The adiabatic cooling processes that lead to the creation of clouds by way of lifting agents are all associated with convergence; a process that involves the horizontal inflow and accumulation of air at a given location, as well as the rate at which this happens. [...] Near the equator, increased cloudiness is due to the presence of the low-pressure Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) where very warm and unstable air promotes mostly <b>cumuliform</b> and cumulonimbiform clouds. [...] Clouds of virtually any type can form along the mid-latitude convergence zones depending on the stability and moisture content of the air. [...] These extratropical convergence zones are occupied by the polar fronts where air masses of polar origin meet and clash with those of tropical or subtropical origin. This leads to the formation of weather-making extratropical cyclones composed of cloud systems that may be stable or unstable to varying degrees according to the stability characteristics of the various airmasses that are in conflict.|$|E
2500|$|Weather {{and climate}} model gridboxes have sides of between [...] and [...] [...] A typical cumulus cloud has {{a scale of}} less than , and would require a grid even finer than this to be {{represented}} physically by the equations of fluid motion. [...] Therefore, the processes that such clouds represent are parameterized, by processes of various sophistication. [...] In the earliest models, if a column of air in a model gridbox was unstable (i.e., the bottom warmer than the top) {{then it would be}} overturned, and the air in that vertical column mixed. [...] More sophisticated schemes add enhancements, recognizing that only some portions of the box might convect and that entrainment and other processes occur. [...] Weather models that have gridboxes with sides between [...] and [...] can explicitly represent convective clouds, although they still need to parameterize cloud microphysics. [...] The formation of large-scale (stratus-type) clouds is more physically based, they form when the relative humidity reaches some prescribed value. [...] Still, sub grid scale processes need to be taken into account. [...] Rather than assuming that clouds form at 100% relative humidity, the cloud fraction can be related to a critical relative humidity of 70% for stratus-type clouds, and at or above 80% for <b>cumuliform</b> clouds, reflecting the sub grid scale variation that would occur in the real world.|$|E
