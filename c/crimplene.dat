25|$|At the Calico Printers' Association in Manchester in 1941, John Rex Whinfield and James Tennant Dickson {{discovered}} polyethylene terephthalate, {{known as}} PET, a common polyester compound found in plastic bottles and food, and {{also known as}} Terylene or Dacron. Cheslene and Crepes of Macclesfield discovered <b>crimplene</b> (the fabric that is now referred to as polyester). ICI Dyestuffs at Hexagon House, in Blackley in north Manchester, discovered Procion dyes. At the Winnington Laboratory on 27 March 1933, Eric Fawcett and Reginald Gibson discovered polythene in an ICI laboratory in Northwich, when reacting benzaldehyde with ethene at a pressure of 2,000 atmospheres; the process was improved in 1935 by Sir Michael Perrin.|$|E
2500|$|Peel's avant-garde fashions, {{featuring}} bold accents and high-contrast geometric patterns, emphasize her youthful, contemporary personality. For the 1965 season, some of {{her most}} memorable outfits were designed by John Bates, including graphic black and white Op art mini-coats and accessories, and a silver ensemble comprising a bra bodice, low-slung trousers, and jacket. She represents the modern England of the Sixties– just as Steed, with his vintage style and mannerisms, personifies Edwardian era nostalgia. According to Macnee in his book The Avengers and Me, Rigg disliked wearing leather and insisted on {{a new line of}} fabric athletic wear for the fifth series. Alun Hughes, who had designed clothing for Diana Rigg's personal wardrobe, was suggested by the actress to design Emma Peel's [...] "softer" [...] new wardrobe. Pierre Cardin was brought in to design a new wardrobe for Macnee. In America, TV Guide ran a four-page photospread on Rigg's new [...] "Emmapeeler" [...] outfits (10–16 June 1967). Eight tight-fitting jumpsuits in a variety of bright colours were created using the stretch fabric <b>crimplene.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, <b>Crimplene</b> {{began to fall}} out of fashion. Other, lighter-weight {{polyester}} fabrics like Trevira replaced <b>Crimplene</b> for their ease of movement and ventilation. <b>Crimplene</b> is seldom used today as fashion preferences have drifted towards more natural cottons.|$|E
5000|$|Clive Brittain called <b>Crimplene</b> [...] "one of {{the toughest}} fillies I have trained, and ranks {{alongside}} Pebbles and Sayyedati {{as one of the}} best". In the International Classification for 2000, <b>Crimplene</b> was given a rating of 119, making her the best three-year-old filly in Europe over one mile.|$|E
50|$|<b>Crimplene</b> was {{retired from}} racing {{to become a}} broodmare for the Darley Stud. Her first foal was Crimson Sun, sired by Danzig, who won two minor races and {{finished}} second in the Somerville Tattersall Stakes. In 2005, <b>Crimplene</b> died from complications after giving birth to a foal by Storm Cat.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Crimplene</b> suits were {{regarded}} {{in some countries}} as [...] "working-men's going-out clothes".|$|E
50|$|In late 2010 {{many of the}} {{original}} members of the Noseflutes were performing as The <b>Crimplene</b> Explosion.|$|E
5000|$|The name [...] "Crimplene" [...] {{was chosen}} for two reasons. The first was that ICI had their {{headquarters}} in Harrogate; specifically nearby Crimple Valley. The word [...] "crimp" [...] also means to fold and intertwine. After successful trials, Dennis's wife Margaret had the first <b>Crimplene</b> dress, and the patent rights were sold to ICI. In 1960 an article appeared in the industries journal The Hosiery Times that caused a sensation, and <b>Crimplene</b> clothing was launched at high society fashion shows in London, Paris, New York and Milan.|$|E
50|$|<b>Crimplene</b> {{began her}} racing career by {{finishing}} {{second in a}} maiden race at Pontefract Racecourse on 18 May and then recorded her first success when taking a similar event at Redcar two weeks later. At the end of June, the filly was moved up to Listed class to finish third in the Empress Stakes over six furlongs at Newmarket. Despite her defeat, she was stepped up in class again in August, when she was sent to York Racecourse for the Lowther Stakes. Starting a 40/1 outsider, she pulled hard {{in the early stages}} before weakening to finish seventh of the nine runners behind the locally-trained Jemima. <b>Crimplene</b> was then dropped in class for a minor stakes race at Salisbury Racecourse and won by a head from Forever Midnight. For her final start of the year, <b>Crimplene</b> was moved into the highest class when she contested the Group One Cheveley Park Stakes. Ridden by Frankie Dettori she again pulled hard in the early stages but finished strongly to finish third behind Seazun and Torgau. At the end of the season, representatives of Sheikh Mohammed's Godolphin organisation purchased Brittain's Teggiano, the winner of the Fillies' Mile, but showed no interest in <b>Crimplene.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Crimplene</b> was a dark-coated {{chestnut}} filly {{with a white}} blaze bred in Ireland by her owner Marwan Al-Maktoum. She was one of {{the best}} horses sired by Lion Cavern, an American-bred stallion who won the Horris Hill Stakes and the Greenham Stakes when trained in France. Apart from <b>Crimplene,</b> the best of his offspring was the Australian sprinter Apache Cat. Crimplene's dam, Crimson Conquest, who won one minor race as a two-year-old, was descended from Bayrose, ancestor of the Poule d'Essai des Poulains winners Blue Tom and Fast Topaze.|$|E
50|$|Crimple Valley {{is an area}} {{south of}} Harrogate (North Yorkshire) {{surrounding}} the River Crimple (also known as Crimple Beck). It gave {{its name to the}} synthetic yarn <b>Crimplene,</b> which was developed at the nearby ICI Laboratory.|$|E
50|$|Former {{employers}} {{in the town}} were the Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB), the Milk Marketing Board and ICI who occupied offices and laboratories at Hornbeam Park where <b>Crimplene</b> was invented in the 1950s and named after the nearby Crimple Valley and beck.|$|E
50|$|The fabric enjoyed {{popularity}} {{upon its}} introduction in the 1960s {{in response to}} its convenient 'wash-and-wear' properties. <b>Crimplene</b> was often {{used to make the}} typical A-line dress of 1960s fashion. It was also popular amongst men in British mod culture for use in garish button-down shirts.|$|E
5000|$|The car {{also got}} a {{political}} reputation at the General Election in 1984, when a defeated National Party MP, Pat Hunt, derisively referred to his Social Credit Party opponent, Neil Morrison, who won the seat {{as a member of}} [...] "the <b>Crimplene</b> suit and Škoda brigade".|$|E
50|$|Flagg was {{the first}} person to import {{polyester}} to the United States and popularize it. She discovered a type of polyester called <b>Crimplene</b> which was being produced by Imperial Chemical Industries out of Leeds, England. The material was used for parachutes and military uniforms during World War II, resulting in a post-war surplus. Flagg found the new fabric while vacationing in Switzerland in the 1960s. She signed an exclusive advertising contract with DuPont to import <b>Crimplene</b> from England and popularize under the name polyester. She also imported the synthetic fabric Dacron. Edith Flagg, Inc. expanded from a successful dress manufacturing company in Los Angeles to an international design house with offices and showrooms in New York, Chicago, Atlanta, Cleveland, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Dallas, Charlotte and London, as well as a factory in Hong Kong.|$|E
50|$|On her three-year-old debut Seazun was partnered by Frankie Dettori {{when she}} contested the Nell Gwyn Stakes (a trial {{race for the}} 1000 Guineas) over seven furlongs at Newmarket. Before the race Channon {{admitted}} that the filly had been slower to reach full fitness than he had hoped. After being hampered two furlongs out, she recovered to take second place, but {{was no match for}} Petrushka, who won by four lengths. On 7 May she started at odds of 10/1 in an 18 runner field for the 1000 Guineas and finished fourth behind Lahan, Princess Ellen and Petrushka. In the Irish 1000 Guineas at the Curragh three weeks later she finished fourth of the fourteen runners behind <b>Crimplene,</b> Amethyst and Storm Dream. In the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot she suffered a broken blood vessel and finished eighth of the nine runners behind <b>Crimplene.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Crimplene</b> is a texturised {{continuous}} fibre produced by modifying Terylene. The patent {{was taken out}} by Mario Nava of Chesline and Crepes Ltd of Macclesfield, and sold to ICI Fibres. ICI licensed the product to various throwsters. The largest producer by far was William Tatton of Leek, and the Golbourne factory was at one time capable of taking the entire output of ICI's Wilton production of Terylene.|$|E
50|$|ICI Fibres {{developed}} the <b>Crimplene</b> fibre. It is a thick, polyester yarn {{used to make}} a fabric of the same name. The resulting cloth is heavy, wrinkle-resistant and retains its shape well. Britain's defunct ICI Laboratory {{developed the}} fibre in the early 1950s and named it after the Crimple Valley in which the company was situated.An alternative reason for the name chosen is that is crimped (i.e. bulked up) Terylene.|$|E
50|$|ICI {{developed}} a fabric in the 1950s known as <b>Crimplene,</b> a thick polyester yarn {{used to make}} a fabric of the same name.The resulting cloth is heavy and wrinkle-resistant, and retains its shape well.The California-based fashion designer Edith Flagg was the first to import this fabric from Britain to the USA.During the first two years, ICI gave Flagg a large advertising budget to popularise the fabric across America.|$|E
5000|$|In August, <b>Crimplene</b> {{was moved}} up in {{distance}} and matched against older fillies and mares {{in the ten}} furlong Nassau Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse. Starting the 7/4 favourite, she took the lead at half way and went five lengths clear of her opponents in the straight. She began to tire in the closing stages but held on to win by one and three quarter lengths from the four-year-old Ela Athena. Commenting on the filly's fourth consecutive major victory, Brittain said: [...] "There {{may have been a}} doubt about whether we were right to go a mile and a quarter, but as I said before the race, when you've got an animal of class they can go any distance". Robinson felt that the filly did not truly stay the distance but won on [...] "sheer guts". Eight days later <b>Crimplene</b> was sent to France to contest the Prix Jacques le Marois over 1600 metres at Deauville Racecourse. She led for most of the race, but was overtaken in the last 400 metres and finished fourth behind the five-year-old horse Muhtathir.|$|E
50|$|The {{materials}} used for both clothing and accessories changed during this era. Increasingly used were easy-care synthetic fabrics such as <b>Crimplene,</b> Dacron and Terylene. The benefits of such synthetic fabrics were {{that they were}} crease-resistant, easy to wash, and required little to no ironing. Designers such as Cristóbal Balenciaga embraced these new types of materials, using them in oversized dolman-sleeve jackets. The pattern for this piece was cut in a rectangular shape forming a boxy blousy look.|$|E
50|$|On 23 September Observatory {{started a}} 14/1 {{outsider}} for the Group One Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot. Giant's Causeway started favourite {{in a field}} which also included Medicean, Best of the Bests (Prix Guillaume d'Ornano), Indian Lodge (Prix du Moulin) and <b>Crimplene.</b> After placing the colt just behind the leaders, Kevin Darley produced the colt with a sustained run down {{the centre of the}} straight to take the lead inside the final furlong and win by half a length from Giant's Causeway.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Crimplene</b> (11 January 1997 [...] - [...] 2005) was an Irish-bred, British-trained Thoroughbred racehorse and broodmare. In {{a racing}} career which lasted from May 1999 until November 2000 she competed in seven {{different}} countries and won six of her sixteen races. In {{the summer of}} 2000 she produced her best form, winning the German 1000 Guineas, Irish 1000 Guineas, Coronation Stakes and Nassau Stakes. She was retired to stud {{at the end of}} the year and died in 2005 at the age of eight.|$|E
5000|$|Seazun was off {{the course}} {{for more than four}} months before {{returning}} in the Listed Sirenia Stakes over six furlongs at Kempton Park Racecourse on 8 September. Ridden by Steve Drowne, she finished well to take second place behind Primo Valentino, a colt who {{went on to win the}} Middle Park Stakes. Twenty days later, Quinn was back in the saddle when Seazun was one of fourteen fillies to contest the Group One Cheveley Park Stakes at Newmarket. The French-trained Moon Driver (winner of the Prix d'Arenberg) started favourite ahead of Elaflaak (St Hugh's Stakes), Torgau (Cherry Hinton Stakes) and Mall Queen (Prix Yacowlef), with Seazun next in the betting on 10/1. The other runners included <b>Crimplene,</b> Kalindi (Windsor Castle Stakes) and Jemima (Lowther Stakes). Seazun raced down the centre of the wide Newmarket straight as Torgau set the pace, before moving up to challenge approaching the final furlong. She overtook Torgau in the closing stages and won by a head, with a gap of two and a half lengths back to <b>Crimplene</b> in third place. After the race Channon said [...] "I was expecting a big run from Breslin's filly. She just needed the run last time" [...] and added [...] "This filly is just quality. She has only had four runs now, we haven't been hard on her".|$|E
50|$|On 23 September, <b>Crimplene</b> was {{the only}} female {{in the field of}} twelve for the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot. She raced in second place for much of the way before {{weakening}} in the straight and finishing eighth behind Observatory, who won by half a length from Giant's Causeway. Crimplene's final racecourse appearance came on 4 November, when she was sent to the United States for the Breeders' Cup Distaff over nine furlongs on dirt at Churchill Downs. Starting as a 42/1 outsider, she reached third place in the straight before finishing fourth behind the American filly Spain.|$|E

5000|$|Iftiraas, Seazun, Amethyst and the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches winner Blumamba {{were among}} Crimplene's rivals when she contested the Group One Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot on 23 June. She was made 4/1 joint-favourite with the French-trained Zarkiya, {{the winner of}} the Prix de Sandringham. Robinson sent <b>Crimplene</b> into the lead from the start and went clear of the field in the {{straight}} to win by two and a half lengths from Princess Ellen. After the race Robinson said: [...] "This filly seems to thrive on racing. She'll be going all over the world. She just loves it". Brittain described the winner as [...] "a bit like me... people have underestimated her".|$|E
5000|$|In March, <b>Crimplene</b> {{was sent}} to the United Arab Emirates and was matched against colts in the UAE Derby on dirt at Nad Al Sheba Racecourse. She turned into the {{straight}} in third place but faded in the closing stages to finish sixth of the sixteen runners behind China Visit. On her return to Europe she ran in the Fred Darling Stakes at Newbury Racecourse and finished third to Iftiraas, with the future 1000 Guineas winner Lahan in fourth place. Brittain later explained that the filly had been in season {{at the time of the}} race. She was then sent to Italy for the Premio Regina Elena in Rome where she finished third to the locally trained fillies Xua and Timi, after being roughly treated by the Italian stalls handlers. A week later <b>Crimplene</b> was in Düsseldorf for the Henckel-Rennen, Germany's equivalent of the 1000 Guineas. Drawn on the wide outside of the fifteen runner field, she took the lead after 400 metres, went clear of the field entering the straight, and won by four lengths from the Irish-trained Margay. Racing in her fifth country in a little over two months, Crimplene's next appearance was in the Irish 1000 Guineas at the Curragh Racecourse on 28 May. Starting aa a 16/1 outsider she took the lead soon after the start and was never headed, winning by one and a half lengths from the Aidan O'Brien-trained Amethyst, with Storm Dream third and Seazun fourth. After the race Brittain hugged the filly amid a shower of hailstones and commented [...] "that should have been three Guineas", referring to her treatment in Italy.|$|E

5000|$|Anne Lambert, {{noting the}} ups and downs of Wilde's career, {{concluded}} that Close was [...] "proof that Kim will still be around when her rivals are fighting it out in the bargain bins." [...] Despite expressing hope that the singer would [...] "experiment and take some chances", the reviewer singled out both the [...] "luscious ballad" [...] "Four Letter Word" [...] and the [...] "brilliant funk" [...] of [...] "Hey Mister Heartache". Smash Hits gave a mixed review, expressing dislike for the tracks [...] "Four Letter Word" [...] and [...] "Lucky Guy" [...] but again describing [...] "Hey Mister Heartache" [...] as [...] "brilliant" [...] and [...] "Love in the Natural Way" [...] as [...] "steamy". Caroline Sullivan of Melody Maker gave a mostly positive review but noted the similarities of the production to recent work by SAW and wrote [...] "Many songs here could be Bananarama Wow! tracks with Kim's voice superimposed." [...] Q, while describing Wilde as an institution in British pop (along with Bananarama), wrote that [...] "You Came" [...] sounded [...] "dated" [...] and [...] "like an out-take from Human League's Dare. However, praise was reserved for a [...] "really special moment"; Wilde's faithful version of Todd Rundgren's [...] "Lucky Guy". [...] "Writing for Sounds, Peter Kane compared the [...] "pure pop" [...] album unfavorably to the work of Pet Shop Boys and Belinda Carlisle, specifically citing [...] "Four Letter Words" [...] as [...] "having been discarded by Sheena Easton while clearing her wardrobe of <b>Crimplene</b> jumpsuits." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{weather in}} the early part of 2000 was unusually wet and cold, and Gosden found it {{difficult}} to bring his horses to peak fitness. He took the precaution of moving Lahan, a filly he held in very high regard, to a stable next to the yard's boiler in an attempt to keep her warm and comfortable. Lahan began the 2000 season with a run in the Fred Darling Stakes, a recognised trial for the 1000 Guineas run over seven furlongs on soft ground at Newbury Racecourse. Starting the 9/4 favourite, she took the lead quarter of a mile from the finish and looked to be going well, but weakened in the closing stages to finish fourth behind Iftiraas, Glen Rosie and <b>Crimplene.</b> Gosden later said that he had been [...] "really depressed" [...] after the performance until his fourteen-year-old daughter told him that [...] "it was only a horserace". In the 1000 Guineas, on 7 May, Lahan was ridden by Richard Hills and started at odds of 14/1, with Petrushka being made 6/4 favourite. Lahan pulled hard in the early stages before producing a strong run to take the lead a furlong from the finish. She stayed on to win by one and a quarter lengths from the 66/1 outsider Princess Ellen, with Petrushka three lengths further back in third. The win was a notable one for Unfuwain: as well as siring the first and third horses, he was the damsire of the runner-up. After the race Richard Hills said [...] "I set out to track Bintalreef because I thought she was the quick one in the race, but they were going faster on the stands' side and I had to tack straight across to get the cover I needed and it took a couple of furlongs to get her settled. John Gosden got me to ride Lahan from behind in a gallop on Wednesday and what she did there gave me the confidence I needed for today".|$|E
