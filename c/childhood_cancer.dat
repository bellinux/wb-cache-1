5|$|Most {{long-term}} survivors {{alive today}} had low or intermediate risk disease and milder courses of treatment compared to high-risk disease. The majority of survivors have long-term {{effects from the}} treatment. Survivors of intermediate and high-risk treatment often experience hearing loss. Growth reduction, thyroid function disorders, learning difficulties, and greater risk of secondary cancers affect survivors of high-risk disease. An estimated two of three survivors of <b>childhood</b> <b>cancer</b> will ultimately develop at least one chronic and sometimes life-threatening health problem within 20 to 30 years after the cancer diagnosis.|$|E

Understanding how, with whom and what the research community is doing with <b>childhood</b> <b>cancers</b> is essential for ensuring the evidence-based policies at national and European level to support children, their families and researchers. As part of the European Union funded EUROCANCERCOMS project to study and integrate cancer communications across Europe, we have carried out new research into the state of research in <b>childhood</b> <b>cancers.</b> We are very grateful for all the support we have received from colleagues in the European paediatric oncology community, and in particular from Edel Fitzgerald and Samira Essiaf from the SIOP Europe office.

25|$|It is {{estimated}} that 10% of all birth defects are caused by prenatal exposure to a teratogenic agent. These exposures include, {{but are not limited}} to, medication or drug exposures, maternal infections and diseases, and environmental and occupational exposures. Paternal smoking use has also been linked to an increased risk of birth defects and <b>childhood</b> <b>cancer</b> for the offspring, where the paternal germline undergoes oxidative damage due to cigarette use. Teratogen-caused birth defects are potentially preventable. Studies have shown that nearly 50% of pregnant women have been exposed to at least one medication during gestation. During pregnancy, a female can also be exposed to teratogens from the contaminated clothing or toxins within the seminal fluid of a partner. An additional study found that of 200 individuals referred for genetic counseling for a teratogenic exposure, 52% were exposed to more than one potential teratogen.|$|E
25|$|Jindal {{refused to}} accept federal funds to expand Medicaid {{after the passage of}} the Affordable Care Act, costing his state $1.65 billion in federal health-care {{assistance}} for the poor. He supports increased health insurance portability; laws promoting coverage of pre-existing medical conditions; a cap on malpractice lawsuits; an easing of restrictions on importation of prescription medications; the implementation of a streamlined electronic medical records system; an emphasis on preventative care rather than emergency room care; and tax benefits aimed at making health insurance more affordable for the uninsured and targeted to promote universal access. Since Jindal has taken office, over 11,000 uninsured children {{have been added to the}} State's Children's Health Insurance Program. He opposes a federal government-run, single-payer system, but supports state efforts to reduce the uninsured population. He has also supported expanding services for autistic children, and has promoted a national <b>childhood</b> <b>cancer</b> database. In collaboration with Health Secretary Alan Levine, Jindal has drafted the Louisiana Health First Initiative. This plan focuses on expanding health insurance coverage for the state's indigent population, increasing Medicaid choice, reducing fraud, authorizing funding of a new charity hospital, and increasing transparency in Medicaid by making performance measures available over the internet. Jindal supports co-payments in Medicaid. Due to a congressional reduction in federal Medicaid financing rates, the Jindal administration chose to levy the largest slice of cuts on the network of LSU charity hospitals and clinics, requiring some facilities to close.|$|E
