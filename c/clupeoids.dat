40|$|The <b>clupeoid</b> fishes are {{distributed}} worldwide, with marine, freshwater and euryhaline species living in either tropical or temperate environments. Regional endemism is important at the species and genus levels, {{and the highest}} species diversity {{is found in the}} tropical marine Indo-West Pacific region. The <b>clupeoid</b> distribution follows two general pattern of species richness, the longitudinal and latitudinal gradients. To test historical hypotheses explaining the formation of these two gradients, we have examined the early biogeography of the Clupeoidei in reconstructing the evolution of their habitat preferences along with their ancestral range distributions on a time-calibrated mitogenomic phylogeny. The phylogenetic results support the distinction of nine main lineages within the Clupeoidei, five of them new. We infer several independent transitions from a marine to freshwater environment and from a tropical to temperate environment that occurred after the initial diversification period of the Clupeoidei. These results combined with our ancestral range reconstruction hypothesis suggest that the probable region of origin and diversification of the Clupeoidei during the Cretaceous period was the tropical marine precursor to the present Indo-West Pacific region. Thus, our study favors the hypotheses of "Region of origin" and "Tropical conservatism" to explain the origins of the longitudinal and latitudinal gradients of <b>clupeoid</b> species richness, respectively. Additional geological and paleontological evidence further define the tropical marine paleo-region of origin as the eastern Tethys Sea region. The Cretaceous fossil record of the Clupeoidei is partially incongruent with the results here as it contains taxa found outside this region. We discuss three possible causes of conflict between our biogeographical hypothesis and the distributions of the Cretaceous <b>clupeoid</b> fossils: regional extinction, incomplete taxonomic sampling and incorrect timescale estimation...|$|R

Fish distribution and movements have been described in four dimensions – longitudinal, lateral, vertical, and temporal (seasonal) – that reflect the dynamic spatial and temporal nature of fish movements and habitat requirements in freshwater systems. Much of what is known about the fish fauna of large tropical floodplain systems of the world is the result of work undertaken in the Amazonian, Asian and African wetlands.

40|$|The {{original}} publication can {{be found}} at www. springerlink. comThis article describes the life-history strategy of the blue sprat Spratelloides robustus in South Australia and compares the demographic traits observed with those of other <b>clupeoids.</b> Validation studies that involved marking the sagittae of captive fish with oxy-tetracycline suggested that growth increments are deposited daily. The oldest fish examined was 82 mm caudal fork length and 241 days old, which suggests S. robustus may live for less than 1 year. Growth rates were high during larval stages (0. 34 mm daym 1) and remained high throughout juvenile (0. 33 mm daym 1) and adult stages (0. 19 mm daym 1). S. robustus reached 50 % maturity at approximately 60 mm caudal fork length after approximately 135 days. Spawning occurred from October to February (spring to late summer) and larvae were found mainly in Spencer Gulf, Gulf St Vincent, and Investigator Strait. Females spawned multiple batches of demersal eggs every 1 - 2 days. Batch fecundities were low (mean= 756, SD= 341) and increased linearly with length and weight. The life history of S. robustus is dissimilar to other small to medium-sized temperate <b>clupeoids,</b> but similar to those of many small sub-tropical and tropical <b>clupeoids,</b> including other Spratelloides species. Gulf St Vincent and Spencer Gulf may be considered to be "seasonally subtropical systems" in an otherwise temperate region that support a suite of species, including S. robustus, that have life-history strategies similar to those of sub-topical and tropical taxa.

40|$|Global marine fish catch {{has been}} stable {{over the past}} decade but the <b>clupeoid</b> {{contribution}} has declined from one-half to one-third of the marine fish catch. This decline appears to be caused by changes in recruitment success during heavy fishing pressure. Theoretical population approaches and correlative environmental indices are not yet sufficient for setting catch limits. For some time the direct measurement of current biomass appears to be necessary for setting <b>clupeoid</b> quotas. Precision and cost studies on the estimation of biomass with current methods indicate that a standard error of estimate less than 25 % cannot be justified based on the increased long-term yield of the stock.

From this manipulation it appears that significant decreases in recruitment could originate at any stage but marked increases in recruitment are only likely to arise from lower mortality rates in the embryonic and larval stages.

Sizes were more widely distributed and larger for both E. teres (7 - 41 mm with two modes) and S. melanostictus (7 - 41 mm with two modes) than for E. japonicus (7 - 37 mm with two modes). Age determined by ring increments on otoliths (sagittae) showed multi-modal patterns in all species, i. e. modes were identified around 26 - 30 and 46 - 50 days for E. japonicus, 11 - 15 and 26 - 30 days in E. teres, and 16 - 20 and 51 - 55 days in S. melanostictus. According to relationships between monthly changes in the modes of size, age and hatching date, migrant and resident stocks were present, and all three species tended to be longer residents in the fishery ground during winter. Hatching dates, estimated by daily ring increment of otoliths were distributed all year round in E. japonicus, October to March and May to July in E. teres and October to March in S. melanostictus.
