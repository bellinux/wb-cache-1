40|$|AIMS—To {{report the}} {{appearances}} of <b>cornea</b> <b>guttata</b> and Fuchs' endothelial dystrophy from white light confocal microscopy.  METHODS—Seven eyes of four consecutive patients with <b>cornea</b> <b>guttata</b> were prospectively examined. Of the seven eyes, three also had corneal oedema (Fuchs' dystrophy). In vivo white light tandem scanning confocal microscopy {{was performed in}} all eyes. Results were compared with non-contact specular microscopy.  RESULTS—Specular microscopy was precluded by corneal oedema in one eye. In the remaining six eyes, it demonstrated typical changes including pleomorphism, polymegathism, {{and the presence of}} guttae appearing as dark bodies, some with a central bright reflex. In all seven eyes, confocal microscopy revealed the presence of round hyporeflective images with an occasional central highlight {{at the level of the}} endothelium. Changes in cell morphology and size were readily appreciated.  CONCLUSION—By comparison with specular microscopy, the hyporeflective images with an occasional central highlight seen on confocal microscopy are consistent with the presence of guttae. Confocal microscopy may confirm the diagnosis of <b>cornea</b> <b>guttata</b> and Fuchs' endothelial dystrophy by demonstrating the presence of guttae. This technique is especially valuable in cases of corneal oedema, where specular microscopy may fail to visualise the endothelium. However, specular microscopy should remain the method of choice to evaluate the endothelium, principally because it is easier to use.    Keywords: confocal microscopy; cornea guttata; Fuchs' dystroph...|$|E

DESIGN: Cross-sectional, random, population-based study. PARTICIPANTS: The 774 participants were those participating in the second examination of the Reykjavik Eye Study. At baseline, we had {{a response rate of}} 75. 8 %, and at the 5 -year follow-up, 88 % of the survivors participated. METHODS: We used slit-lamp and non-contact specular microscopy and endothelial specular photography as well as computer-assisted morphometry. We used a standardized grading system for CG. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Diagnosis of primary central CG. RESULTS: The prevalence of CG is 11 % for females and 7 % for males both for right eyes and left eyes. Higher weight and higher body mass index are found to be associated with decreased risk of CG. Having smoked more than 20 pack-years increased the risk of CG more than 2 -fold (P< 0. 02). CONCLUSIONS: <b>Cornea</b> <b>guttata</b> seem to be found more commonly in women than in men. Smoking for more than 20 pack-years increases the risk of developing CG more than 2 -fold...|$|E

40|$|Essential iris atrophy {{represents}} one of the phenotypic expressions of irido-corneal-endothelial syndrome (ICE-S). Despite some typical clinical features, differential diagnosis of the endothelial alteration at early stage of the disease is not easy also with a careful slit lamp examination, with different overlapping clinical aspects. We report differential diagnosis by in vivo confocal microscopy and anterior segment optical coherent tomography, between ICE-syndrome related endotheliopathy in a 62 year male patient and other pathologies involving corneal endothelium with different therapeutic and prognostic implications: Posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy, <b>cornea</b> <b>guttata</b> and Fuch’s endothelial dystrophy. Even if the ICS-Syndrome is generally unilateral and non familial, a bilateral occurrence may be possible. The disease may progress leading to secondary glaucoma and corneal decompensation. In this contest, early diagnosis becomes fundamental to monitor corneal endothelial and stromal changes, IOP variation and pupil distortion in order to establish a correct therapeutic strategy. Differential analysis with posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy, <b>cornea</b> <b>guttata</b> and Fuch’s endothelial dystrophy is necessary, especially in bilateral disease due to different prognosis and management of these pathologies. Indeed in this clinical case, despite the apparent absence of stromal modifications at biomicroscopic examination, in vivo confocal microscopy allowed us to detect the presence of a stromal sub-clinical edema, explaining patients visual fluctuations with a consequent customized therapeutic strategy and prognostic evaluation...|$|E
40|$|Report of a {{study of}} a family with a {{remarkable}} combination of endothelial corneal dystrophy, and anterior chamber dysgenesis classified as Axenfeld-Rieger anomaly. A 56 year-old female had blurred vision complaints. A slit lamp evaluation showed a bilateral posterior embryotoxon and guttata with corneal edema, Descemet membrane's folds, characterizing Fuchs endothelial dystrophy. A 27 year-old daughter was asymptomatic. The biomicroscopic exam disclosed a bilateral nasal and temporal posterior embryotoxon and a central guttata. Gonioscopy showed iridocorneal strands with a prominent Schwalbe´s line. The intraocular pressure was normal. Her sister, a 25 year-old female presented very similar abnormalities along with her brother (22 years old). A 19 year-old female sister presented the iridocorneal angle alterations, without Fuchs endothelial dystrophy, until this moment.

40|$|SUMMARY The histopathological {{findings}} in five post-mortem eyes with anterior chamber and iris fixation intraocular lenses (IOLS) are discussed. The interval between lens insertion and death ranged from 31 / 2 to 52 months. Clinically the lenses were well tolerated and the surgery {{was considered to}} be successful. In one case a vitrectomy was required.

On 29 November 1949 Harold Ridley implanted the first intraocular lens (IOL). ' Thirty-five years later intraocular lens implantation is a generally accepted and apparently highly successful means of improving vision after removal of a cataractous lens. 2 Although examination of surgically enucleated eyes has pro-vided some clues to the potential complications occurring with IOLs, 3 a more valid assessment of their effect on the eye can be obtained by studying necropsy eyes in which an IOL has been used. 4 This report describes the histopathological {{findings in}} IOL-containing eyes obtained post mortem fro...|$|E
40|$|Implantation of a {{negative}} power intraocular lens {{is one of the}} options for surgical correction of high myopia. We studied 36 eyes with a Fechner Worst Claw Lens, implanted in Groningen between March 1987 and November 1991. The preoperative myopia ranged from - 7. 00 to - 30. 00 diopters. Twentyone eyes had a follow up period of more than 12 months. The [OL power was calculated with the van der Heyde method. Correction within 1 diopters of emmetropia has been achieved in 55. 5 % of the cases. Deviation of more than 2 diopters occurred in 25 %. In 24 eyes the best corrected postoperative visual acuity improved. Due to the IOL the retinal image increases in size as compared to spectacle correction. In none of the cases complications were encountered during surgery. In the postoperative period one IOL had to be replaced because of an error made in the calculation of the lens power. In one case endothelial decompensation occurred, probably due to a combination of compulsive eye rubbing and a preexisting <b>cornea</b> <b>guttata.</b> The rim of the IOL optic is the part which is the closest to the endothelium. Our recommendation is that one should avoid indentation of the cornea. No other serious complications occurred in this study...|$|E

40|$|Introduction. Simultaneous Descemet {{stripping}} endothelial keratoplasty, phacoemulsification, and {{intraocular lens}} implantation are indicated in Fuchs’ dystrophy with associated cataract. Compared {{to the standard}} method of the triple procedure which includes penetrating keratoplasty, this new method has the advantages of sutureless surgery, small limbal incision, faster recovery, less surface problems, less astigmatism, stronger tensile strength and more predictable calculation of the intraocular lens power. This is the first report of such a combination of procedures in our literature. Case report. A 76 -year-old woman suffered from a gradual bilateral visual loss. The best corrected visual acuity was 20 / 60 (right eye) and finger counting at 1 m (left eye). Corneal thickness was 590 μm and 603 μm, respectively. A marked <b>cornea</b> <b>guttata</b> and nuclear cataract were present in both eyes. Phacoemulsification, lens implantation, and Descemet stripping were done in the left eye. The posterior lamellar corneal graft, 8. 0 mm in diameter and about 150 μm thick, was bent and inserted through the limbal incision. The air was injected into the anterior chamber to attach the graft to the recipient stroma. The cornea remained clear, and the transplant was attached during a two-year follow-up. Visual acuity was 20 / 40 after two months, and 20 / 25 after one year. Conclusion. The new technique proved itself as {{a good choice for}} the treatment of a mild Fuchs’ dystrophy associated with cataract...|$|E
40|$|AIMS—To {{detect the}} {{presence}} of guttae by means of light microscopy during organ culture and to evaluate the influence of {{the presence of}} guttae in the donor tissue on transplantation outcome.  METHODS—Donor corneas were investigated for the presence of guttae by means of light microscopy at the end of organ culture. Recipient corneal buttons from patients with severe Fuchs' dystrophy and donor corneas with advanced guttae were first studied by light microscopy and subsequently by transmission electron microscopy. Lastly, 168  consecutive donor corneas were evaluated for the presence of guttae and issued for transplantation.  RESULTS—Corneal specimens with Fuchs' dystrophy displayed numerous round highly reflecting guttae {{at the level of the}} corneal endothelium. Donor corneas with advanced guttae showed less numerous guttae. Among 168  organ cultured donor corneas issued for transplantation, low density guttae were found in 43  (25. 6 %) corneas. The endothelial cell density and figure coefficient were significantly lower and organ culture time was significantly higher in the <b>cornea</b> <b>guttata</b> group than in the control group. The presence of grouped guttae significantly decreased the adjusted graft survival. The incidence of postoperative stage 3  cornea guttata was significantly higher when grouped guttae were found (5 / 6) than when no guttae or scattered guttae were found (8 / 101).  CONCLUSION—Cornea guttata can be detected during organ culture by means of light microscopy. It is associated with a decrease in endothelial cell figure coefficient and cell density. The presence of grouped guttae is associated with poorer graft survival and more frequent stage 3  cornea guttata in the graft after transplantation. ...|$|E
40|$|Greg D Rice, 1 Kristin Wright, 1 Steven M Silverstein 2 1 Kansas City University of Medicine and Biosciences, Kansas City, MO, USA; 2 Silverstein Eye Centers, Kansas City, MO, USA Objective: The goal of {{this study}} was to examine a {{possible}} clinical association between Fuchs’ endothelial dystrophy (FED) and glaucoma suspect (GS) /ocular hypertension (OHT) or open angle glaucoma (OAG). Methods: A retrospective chart review was carried out using data from electronic medical records and paper records from a private ophthalmology clinic in Kansas City, MO, USA. The review included 257 patients with FED and 584 randomly selected controls with no history of endothelial dystrophy. Binomial and multinomial regression using generalized estimating equations was used to create models to examine the correlation between FED diagnosis/severity and glaucoma diagnosis/type of glaucoma adjusted for age, sex, presence of diabetes, number of guttae, and intraocular pressure (IOP). Results: No statistically significant increase in prevalence of either OHT or GS/OHT compared to controls was observed (P> 0. 3). There was a statistically significant positive correlation between increasing age and IOP with increased glaucoma prevalence (P 0. 09), and was actually significantly negatively correlated to worsening glaucoma subtype for category 2 FED patients (P< 0. 05). Diabetes was not associated with the prevalence of either glaucoma or its subtypes of GS/OHT or OAG. Conclusion: The correlation between FED and glaucoma has been controversial. This study showed no statistically significant association between FED and glaucoma by prevalence or severity of FED as measured by corneal guttae. Further study is needed to determine if a connection between FED and glaucoma does exist, and if so, whether this relationship may impact earlier the detection and treatment of disease.

To examine the corneal endothelium and establish the 7 -year cumulative incidence of <b>cornea</b> <b>guttata</b> (CG). Population-based prospective cohort study with 573 participants (third wave of the Reykjavik Eye Study (RES) in 2008). Four hundred and thirty-seven subjects had either right or left eyes available for analysis after excluding confounding eye conditions. The baseline for eyes at risk for developing CG is the second wave of the RES in 2001. Participants underwent specular microscopy and a standardized eye examination. The cumulative 7 -year incidence of CG in either eye was estimated as a 95 % confidence interval for the expected value for both genders combined (15 - 23 %), for males (8 - 18 %) and for females (19 - 29 %). In right eye only, the 7 -year cumulative incidence for both genders combined {{was estimated to be}} 6 - 11 %. For genders combined and for males only, the data indicated no correlation between 7 -year cumulated incidence and age at baseline. In women, however, the change of 7 -year incidence for CG in at least one eye appeared to be correlated to age at baseline. Reduction of endothelial cell density for corneas with CG at baseline was found [CI (0. 95) - 132 ± 94]. The cumulative 7 -year incidence of primary central CG for a middle-aged and older Caucasian population without history of potentially confounding eye disease has been established. Women tend to have higher incidence if onset occurs at middle age. If CG is present, the cell density and the cell size variation decrease within a 7 -year period...|$|E
