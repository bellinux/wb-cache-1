50|$|An example: In {{the case}} of a 1500-byte IP packet sent over AAL5/ATM sent with PPPoEoA and RFC2684-LLC, {{neglecting}} final <b>cell</b> <b>padding</b> for the moment, we start with 1500 + 36 + 8 (AAL5 CPCS trailer) = 1544 bytes if the ethernet FCS is present, or else + 32 + 8 = 40 bytes otherwise. To send 1544 bytes over ATM requires 33 48-byte ATM cells since 32 × 48 = 1536 bytes is not quite enough. Compare this to {{the case of}} PPP + PPPoA which at 1500 + 2 (PPP) + 0 (PPPoA: RFC 2364 VC-MUX) + 8 (CPCS trailer) = 1510 bytes fits in 32 cells. So the real cost of choosing PPPoEoA plus RFC2684-LLC for 1500-byte IP packets is one additional ATM cell per packet, a ratio of 33:32.|$|E

Also their field is considerably smaller than most at 75 ft by 40 ft; this is also subject to change. The smaller field was chosen to compensate for the additional fatigue caused by armor usage as well as to place players closer to one another, which CAJA felt was more accurate than the usual playing field. Currently playing skirmishes in Longs, South Carolina (just out of North Myrtle Beach) players ages 14 and up are welcome to come watch or participate as either players or support crew.|$|E
40|$|The use of wrist guards {{has limited}} {{efficacy}} in preventing wrist injuries during falling in many sports activities. The objectives {{of this study}} were to measure the ground reaction force of the hand under simulated impact of the forearm and hand complex with different padding conditions of wrist guards and to analyze their impact force attenuation and maximum energy absorption for improved functional efficiency. A total of 15 subjects, wearing a commercial wrist guard, participated in a cable-released hand impact experiment to test four different conditions on the volar aspect of the hand, which include a wrist guard without a volar splint (bare hand), with a volar splint (normal use), with a volar splint and additional viscoelastic polymeric padding, and a volar splint and additional air <b>cell</b> <b>padding.</b> The ground reaction force and acceleration of the hand were measured using a force platform mounted on an anti-vibration table and a miniature accelerometer, respectively. Additional padding on the bare hand could substantially improve the maximum energy absorption by more than 39 %, with no differences with each other. However, only the air <b>cell</b> <b>padding</b> could simultaneously improve the impact force attenuation by 32 % compared with the bare hand impact without compromising the maximum energy absorption. It is recommended that common wrist guard design should provide more compliant padding in the volar aspect to improve the impact force attenuation through optimal material selection and desig...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Energy-recycling output <b>pad</b> <b>cells</b> {{for driving}} {{adiabatic}} chips are designed, {{which have been}} fabricated with Chartered 0. 35 um process and tested. The proposed energy-recycling output <b>pad</b> <b>cells</b> include mainly bonding pads, electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection circuits, and two stage energy-recycling buffers {{that are used to}} drive the large load capacitances on chip pads. The two stage energy-recycling buffers are realized using CPAL (Complementary Pass-transistor Adiabatic Logic) and PAL- 2 N (pass-transistor adiabatic logic with NMOS pull-down configuration), respectively. For comparison, a conventional output <b>pad</b> <b>cell</b> is also embedded in the test chip. The function verifications and energy loss tests for the three output <b>pad</b> <b>cells</b> are carried out. The energy consumption of the proposed two energy-recycling output <b>pad</b> <b>cells</b> has large savings over a wide range of frequencies, as compared with the conventional CMOS counterparts, since the energy on large load capacitances in the chip pads can be well recycled...|$|R
40|$|For {{performance}} and economic reasons, ATM networks must efficiently support the Internet family of protocols. We calculate the transmission efficiency achieved by {{a range of}} ATM-related protocols when transporting TCP and UDP wide-area traffic. We also compare the efficiency effects of several non-standard compression techniques. To assure an accurate workload characterization, we drive these calculations with millions of wide-area packet lengths measured on the current Internet. We find that networks using standard ATM procedures are dismally inefficient in carrying traditional data traffic - depending on the protocols used, efficiency as seen by an application program ranges between 40 and 53 %. Moreover, due to interaction between TCP-IP datagram lengths and ATM <b>cell</b> <b>padding,</b> efficiency responds abruptly to changes in certain protocol parameters - for example, a 4 -byte increase in ATM cell payload size can yield a 10 % increase in efficiency.

40|$|The ρ-VEX is a runtime {{reconfigurable}} VLIW processor. It is able {{to exploit}} both ILP as well as TLP by running one program in multiple lanes, or several programs concurrently. To accurately quantify its performance compared to other processors, it is implemented as an IC. A fully automatic scripted flow is described, constructing an optimized, error-free ASIC. The design area is limited to 3. 5 um², {{to allow it to}} be manufactured with the cheapest 65 nm prototyping run available at IMEC. In order to achieve this small design area, a new 24 -port register file design has to be devised. In its current state, it is implemented using standard logic cells. Clever optimizations involving <b>cell</b> <b>padding</b> and minimum overhead power routing are necessary to reduce a total routing overcongestion from 7 % to zero. This implementation is expected achieve a clock speed of 141 MHz, only limited by the ρ-VEX reconfiguration logic. By lowering the frequency to 100 MHz, the energy dissipation is reduced by 96 %, to a total of 367 uW/MHz. This is comparable to similar VLIW designs. Using LVDS communication clocked at four times the core frequency, a data bandwidth of 4 Gbit/s is achieved using only 26 external pins. This allows the main data and instruction memory to reside off-chip. To ensure a correct design, it is verified using DRC, LVS, and ERC. For improved reliability, IR-drop is kept within 1 % of the core voltage, using minimal power routing. Furthermore, the effect of electromigration is kept extremely low such that the mean time to failure on nets is 90 years. The scripted flow will aid in prototyping, allowing accurate estimates to be calculated in a mere 7 % of the original time. Proposals for a future design are expected to reduce the register file area and power dissipation by more than 40 %. By improving the pipeline and shortening the critical path, a two to four fold improvement in clock speed can be expected, without adversely affecting power dissipation. <br/...|$|E

40|$|Regulation {{of human}} renal {{adenocarcinoma}} cell growth by retinoic acid and its interactions with epidermal growth factor. Retinoic acid (RA) {{is a natural}} derivative of vitamin A which regulates the growth and differentiation of epithelia. We have previously proposed that RA participates in compensatory kidney growth and reported that RA inhibits rat mesangial cell growth. This paper describes the effects of RA on a human renal adenocarcinoma <b>cell</b> line (<b>PAD)</b> under different growth conditions, and its interactions with epidermal growth factor (EGF). <b>PAD</b> <b>cells</b> were shown to express RA receptors α and β by Northern blot analysis. In serum free cultures, addition of RA (10 - 7 M) markedly increased thymidine incorporation by <b>PAD</b> <b>cells</b> (155 ± 7 % mean ± se vs. control in 6 separate experiments; P < 0. 0001). RA also caused {{a significant increase in}} thymidine incorporation by <b>PAD</b> <b>cells</b> under conditions of rapid growth in serum supplemented medium (115 ± 2 % vs. control; P < 0. 001). RA by itself was unable to reverse contact inhibition of <b>PAD</b> <b>cell</b> growth (NS vs. control), but it synergistically enhanced the mitogenic effect of EGF on confluent monolayers (110 ± 0. 6 % vs. EGF alone; P < 0. 05). Northern blot analysis demonstrated that <b>PAD</b> <b>cells</b> express EGF receptor mRNA, and this was not significantly modified by the addition of RA. Growth arrested (serum starved) <b>PAD</b> <b>cells</b> expressed RAR-α mRNA which was up-regulated eightfold at three hours following the addition of 10 % FCS. Thus, our data show that RA is directly mitogenic for serum starved human renal adenocarcinoma cells and that it exerts complex modulation of cell growth in the presence of EGF and serum components...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to explore the {{presence}} and localization of myocardial citrullination in samples from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients compared to rheumatic and non-rheumatic disease control groups. Archived myocardial samples obtained during autopsy from 1995 to 2009 were assembled into four groups: RA; scleroderma; fatal myocarditis; and non-rheumatic disease controls. Samples were examined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for the presence and localization of citrullination and peptidyl arginine deiminase enzymes (PADs) by a single cardiovascular pathologist blinded to disease group and clinical characteristics. Myocardial samples from seventeen RA patients were compared with those from fourteen controls, five fatal myocarditis patients, and ten scleroderma patients. Strong citrullination staining was detected exclusively in the myocardial interstitium in each of the groups. However, average and peak anti-citrulline staining was 59 % and 44 % higher, respectively, for the RA group compared to the combined non-RA groups (P < 0. 05 for both comparisons). Myocardial fibrosis did not differ between the groups. In contrast to citrullination, PADs 1 to 3 and 6 were detected in cardiomyocytes (primarily PADs 1 and 3), resident inflammatory <b>cells</b> (primarily <b>PADs</b> 2 and 4), and, to a smaller extent, in endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle <b>cells.</b> <b>PAD</b> staining did not co-localize with anti-citrulline staining in the interstitium and did not vary by disease state.
