40|$|Interactions between {{copper and}} {{chlorine}} disinfectants were examined {{from the perspective}} of disinfectant decay and copper pitting corrosion. Sparingly soluble <b>cupric</b> <b>hydroxide</b> catalyzed the rapid decay of free chlorine, which in turn, led to production of less soluble and more crystalline phases of <b>cupric</b> <b>hydroxide.</b> The catalytic activity of the <b>cupric</b> <b>hydroxide</b> was retained over multiple cycles of chlorine dosing. Experiments with chloramine revealed that copper species could also trigger rapid loss of chloramine disinfectant. In copper pipes, loss of free chlorine and chloramine were both rapid during stagnation. Reactivity of the copper to the disinfectants was retained for weeks. Phosphate tended to decrease the reactivity between the copper pipe and chlorine disinfectants. A novel, inexpensive and real-time test to monitor copper pitting corrosion was developed.

Anthropic activities associated with ritual burials do not significantly affect the growth of CM. It is also confirmed that curly malachite is usually not a pseudomorph of formerly organic material. Although the understanding of the formation process is far from complete, this study has shown that CM is expected to be found more often than is currently recognized, due to its relatively simple formation mechanisms and boundary conditions.

40|$|It {{has been}} shown that anodic {{oxidation}} of copper in alkaline solutions leads to a true passivation due to the formation of a protective layer. The properties of this layer depend on various factors such as current density, structure of the metal, electrolyte concentration and temperature. In all cases investigated in this paper, the primary product of anodic oxidation was cuprous oxide. But this cuprous compound is rapidly oxidised to <b>cupric</b> oxide or <b>hydroxide</b> which are the main constituents of the final film.

Populations of syringae-type pseudomonads (STPs) were detected on volunteer bean plants throughout northeastern Colorado. Commercial bean seedlings were free of STPs, suggesting that western-grown, certified seed lots had no, or relatively low, levels of STP contamination. Epiphyte population enumeration by replicate dilution plating was facilitated by {{a modification of}} Harris and Sommers dilution plate frequency method. Populations of STPs increased in experimental plots not sprayed with <b>cupric</b> <b>hydroxide</b> until early flowering.

At low oleate concentrations adsorption is chemisorption and the adsorbed species have been interpreted as, cupric hydroxy mono-oleate and ferric hydroxy di-oleate.

As the concentration is decreased further, this dissociation tends to completion. The nitrosyl of salicylal o-hydroxybenzylamine copper (II) was prepared, and the number of molecules of associated solvent determined by the mole ratio method. * The nitrosyl complexes of cupric iodide, cyanide, thiocyanate and pyridine thiocyanate have been prepared in solution. The nitrosyls of cupric iodide, cyanide and thiocyanate are extremely unstable, with a lifetime of the order of two minutes. The nitrosyl of cupric pyridine thiocyanate is stable in solution for several hours. Spectrophotometric evidence is presented for their existence. Further investigations covered <b>cupric</b> nitrate, <b>hydroxide,</b> iodate, aslicyaldoximate and dithio-oxamide. None of these compounds were observed to form nitrosyls. Consideration of the conditions under which nitrosyls may be formed has led to the suggestion that NO requires to be able to attack the fourth co-planar position. The solid nitrosyls of cupric bromide and chloride have been isolated by precipitation with petroleum ether. On drying, the solid loses associated solvent, and it is suggested that dimerization could be expected to (CuCl 2 NO) 2.

In addition, the effects of these control methods on indigenous leaf and soil bacteria and fungi were assessed. Field plots of bush beans (Phaseolus vulgaris), sprayed with the bacterium Pseudomonas syringae, Pseudomonas fluorescens, or Erwinia herbicola, received the following treatments: (i) control, (ii) tillage, (iii) burning, (iv) burning plus tillage (burn-tillage), (v) Kocide (<b>cupric</b> <b>hydroxide),</b> (vi) Kocide plus tillage, (vii) Agri-Strep (streptomycin sulfate), and (viii) Agri-Strep plus tillage. Leaves and soil from the plots were sampled at 1 day before and at 1, 3, 7, 10, 14, 21, and 30 days after application of the decontamination treatments. The burn and burn-tillage treatments produced the most significant reductions in bacterial populations. The Agri-Strep treatment was more effective than the Kocide treatment in eliminating applied bacteria, but neither biocide produced consistent or persistent control. In contrast, the tillage treatment, alone or in combination with the Agri-Strep or Kocide treatments, had a short-term stimulatory effect and increased populations of applied bacteria and also levels of indigenous fungi and bacteria. Agri-Strep and Kocide treatments caused significant reductions in indigenous bacterial populations up to 14 days after application and in indigenous fungal populations on day 7 after application.

The potassium salt {{was found to be}} an acid salt of composition KH(C 8 H 16 NO 2) 2 where the hydroxamate ligands are equivalent. Voltammetry of a copper electrode in hydroxamate solution exhibited a dependence on hydroxamate concentration with the inhibition of copper oxidation observed for concentrations above 1 mM at potentials greater than - 0. 35 V vs Ag/AgCl. The formation of <b>cupric</b> <b>hydroxide</b> was suppressed and cupric hydroxamate was observed on the copper surface in this potential range by Raman spectroscopy. Atomic absorption spectroscopy was used to determine the copper content of synthesised cupric n-octanohydroxamate. The cupric salt exhibited a 1 : 1 stoichiometry and vibrational spectroscopy demonstrated that the cupric hydroxamate retained neither of the ionizable hydrogen atoms of the hydroxamate. The salt was found to contain a C = N bond and the two singly-bonded O atoms that may coordinate with a cupric ion to form a 5 membered ring. Model cupric salts of hexanoic acid and benzoin oxime were synthesised in order to simplify the identifi cation of the C = N and C = O Raman band locations expected for the cupric n-octanohydroxamate spectra. In contrast, the acid and potassium salt exhibit a structure containing a C-N bond and a C = O functional group.

As well as production bed covers, the fabric was cut into discs and (a) used to cover the tops of plant containers (pot toppers) and (b) inserted to cover {{the holes in the}} bottoms of plant containers (disc inserts). These were all tested as barriers to the passage of infective zoospores of Phytophthora cryptogea in enclosed re-circulating irrigation systems growing test plants of Chamaecyparis lawsoniana. Bed covers and disc inserts significantly reduced disease spread, as indicated by the incidence of symptoms and infection, and by bait and colony-forming unit tests of re-circulating water, both in overhead- and trickle-irrigated systems. Pot toppers were not effective. This may be explained by the mode of spread of Phytophthora in such irrigation systems, which appears to be largely via capillary water and therefore not intercepted by toppers. These results were supported by in vitro studies on the passage of zoospores through fresh and used fabric samples which showed that all Tex-R Pro fabric materials significantly reduced the survival of zoospores and zoospore cysts (to between 0 % and 4. 8 %) compared with untreated fabrics (between 32. 3 % and 42. 8 %). Analysis of Cu 2 + concentrations in re-circulating irrigation water and in matting samples {{at the end of the}} field experiments showed that the majority of the active ingredient stayed bound to the fabric.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Aqueous {{solutions}} of {{a number}} of metal complexes have been found to dissolve cellulose. Recently, a number of new metal complexes have been developed that completely dissolve cellulose by deprotonating and coordinative binding the hydroxyl groups in the C 2 and C 3 position of the anhydro glucose. A detailed comparative light scattering study is given for cellulose in Schweizer’s reagent (cuoxam), Ni-tren, and Cd-tren. Cuoxam is the well-known solution of <b>cupric</b> <b>hydroxide</b> in aqueous ammonia, and the abbreviation tren stands for tris(2 -aminoethyl) amine. Cuoxam and Ni-tren are deep blue solvents. The light scattering measurements were carried out with the blue line of an argon ion laser at wavelength ì 0) 457. 9 nm, and the data from these solvents required an absorption correction according to the Lambert-Beer law. Cd-tren is almost colorless, and the data could be used without correction. Because of traces of colloid particles, possibly originating from the metal hydroxides, a special treatment for optical clarification became necessary. A large number of samples, cotton linters, various pulp celluloses, and bacterial celluloses, were studied. All three solvents exhibited good solution properties, but only Cd-tren was capable of dissolving also the highest degrees of polymerization of cotton linters and bacterial cellulose (DPw) 9700). The limits for the two other solvents were DPw < 6300 for Ni-tren and DPw < 5300 for cuoxam.

40|$|Fungicides are {{commonly}} applied as prophylactic sprays, {{with the expectation}} of increased yield and kernel quality, to control husk spot of macadamia in Australia.

We investigated the effectiveness, efficiency and economic returns of fungicide spray applications for husk spot control using three different spray application volumes and two dose rates of tank mixtures of carbendazim and <b>cupric</b> <b>hydroxide</b> under commercial macadamia orchard conditions. Husk spot incidence and severity were significantly (P < 0. 001) different among the treatments and between the two years. In both years, the rate of fruit abscission was highest in the untreated control followed by low spray application volumes, but reduced with increasing spray volume. The quality and value of nut-in-shell increased when nut abscission was delayed. Poor quality and low nut-in-shell value of $ 2. 85 kg(- 1) in 2010 and $ 2. 12 kg(- 1) in 2011 were obtained in the untreated control trees that abscised early in the harvest period compared with the average nut-in-shell value of $ 2. 95 kg(- 1) in 2010 and $ 2. 46 kg(- 1) in 2011 in the fungicide treated trees. Gross margins for each fungicide treatment schedule compared to the untreated control averaged over both years showed positive contributions of 20 %, 10 % and 6 % for the high, moderate and low dilute rate volume applications, respectively. Our data further indicates that dilute rate applications at higher volume may be more beneficial and cost-effective than concentrate rate applications in husk spot control programs. Overall, harvest yield increased by 11 %- 33 % when husk spot was controlled using fungicide sprays compared to no fungicide spray applications.

40|$|Effluents are {{neutralized}} {{with lime}} forming a voluminous waste sludge which may slowly redissolve in groundwater. This sludge {{may also be}} a significant secondary metal source. The present research aims to develop a concept for metals removal and recovery using stabilized colloidal suspensions of activated silica sol, which acts as a neutralizing agent and an adsorption medium. Silica sol was prepared by firstly acidifying a sodium silicate solution to initiate polymerization, which would ultimately yield a gel. Polymerization was then arrested before gelation by water dilution giving a stabilized, negatively charged sol. Adsorption and precipitation were distinguished by comparing the coloured products from adding silica sol, lime or sodium hydroxide to cobaltous sulphate solution. Studies of dissolved copper/silica sol interactions showed copper adsorption/desorption to be a reversible pH-controlled process, which was monitored 'in-situ' using a cupric specific ion electrode. Dissolved copper values determined by the electrode were identical to those measured by atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) for solutions at below pH 7. At above pH 7, the electrode showed zero dissolved cupric, but AAS reported some dissolved copper, attributed to desorbed colloidal <b>cupric</b> <b>hydroxide.</b> A copper/sol underflow sharply divided from a clear overflow were the adsorption products. Addition of concentrated sulphuric acid to centrifuged underflow produced a concentrated copper solution and regenerated sol. The separation of two metals (cupric and ferric) using pH control was also demonstrated. Adsorption/desorption cycles were used to remove iron from synthetic effluents producing concentrated iron products. Three consecutive cycles were required to produce 30 g/L dissolved iron, suitable for sewage treatment, from 0. 5 g/L iron effluent. Final pH control with lime precipitated desorbed colloidal hydroxides. Good settling characteristics following adsorption/precipitation from synthetic and actual mine effluents were observed. Problems included gypsum build-up, while excess silica addition gave dispersion, high silica losses and no phase separation. Nickel was selectively recovered over iron and magnesium from a tailings pond sludge by acid leaching then solution treatment with activated silica/lime.

40|$|Tannery {{and timber}} {{treatment}} effluents {{are considered to}} be the major source of Copper (Cu), Chromium (Cr) and Arsenic (As) heavy metal contamination into the environment. Chromium is used in tanneries for the treatment of hides and skins whereas, copper, chromium, and arsenic (CCA) solution is used as the timber treatment chemical. Chromium is used as Cr (III) in tannery industry and as Cr (VI) in timber treatment industry. Arsenic and Cr (VI) which are present in the timber treatment effluent are highly toxic and carcinogenic. An initial survey has indicated that some tannery industries in New Zealand have not developed pre-treatment practices to reduce the heavy metal concentration before discharging the effluent into soil or waterways. The heavy metal pollution due to timber treatment industries may occur from the drips, leaks and spills due to poor handling of CCA solution while treating timber. In this project, the potential value of industrial waste materials, such as Pinus radiata bark, fluidised bed boiler ash (FBA), flue gas desulphurisation gypsum (FGDG) and natural resources, such as zeolite, peat soil, and two soils (Tokomaru and Egmont soils) to reduce heavy metal concentration in tannery and timber treatment effluents was examined. The value of these materials in the remediation of soil contaminated with Cr was examined using a growth experiment. The effect of pre-treatment of Pinus bark with acid, alkali of formaldehyde/acid on the retention of Cr was examined. Pre-treatment of Pinus bark increased the heavy metal retention only at low heavy metal concentration and did not significantly improve the heavy metal retention at high concentration. The extent of adsorption increased with an increase in surface area of Pinus bark material. Speciation of Cr indicated that Cr (VI) is reduced to Cr (III) and adsorbed onto the Pinus bark. FBA was found to be most efficient in reducing the Cr (III) concentration from tannery effluent and As and Cu concentrations in the timber treatment effluent. In the case of Cr (VI), the highest retention was shown by the Pinus bark and the peat soil. The increased retention of Cr (III), Cu and As by FBA was due to the precipitation of Cr (III) as chromium hydroxide, Cu as <b>cupric</b> <b>hydroxide</b> and As as calcium arsenate. A combination of FBA + Pinus bark or FBA + peat soil was efficient in reducing all the three heavy metal (Cu, Cr (VI) and As) concentration from the timber treatment effluent. The effluents contaminated with Cu, Cr and As can be passed through a column containing FBA and Pinus bark or peat soil. A growth experiment using sun flower (Helianthus annus) was set-up to examine the effectiveness of FBA, lime and Pinus bark to immobilise Cr in contaminated soil. FBA and lime amended soils were effective in establishing a normal plant growth of sun flower in Cr (III) contaminated soil even at high Cr (III) levels (3200 mg/kg soil). Incorporation of lime or FBA in Cr (III) contaminated soils causes precipitation of Cr (III) and thereby reduces the bioavailabilty of Cr for plants uptake. Only Pinus bark amended soil was found to be effective in remediating Cr (VI) contaminated soil even at 3200 mg/kg soil. Pinus bark material effectively retained the Cr (VI) present in the soil solution and thus reducing the toxicity and bioavailability of Cr (VI) to plants...|$|E
