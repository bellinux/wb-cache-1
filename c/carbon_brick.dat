50|$|Bomb liner {{material}} received from Plant 5 in mobile hoppers was emptied at an unloading station and elevated to a surge hopper. Material as needed was sent from the surge hopper through a jaw crusher {{and into a}} shelf type oxidation furnace. Here the metallic uranium was oxidized to triuranium octoxide (U3O8). The material discharged from the furnace was lifted to a surge hopper and then as needed was sent through a roll mill and ground to -325 mesh size. It was then fed into <b>carbon</b> <b>brick</b> digestion tanks where the uranium was dissolved in hydrochloric acid containing a little sodium chlorate. The undissolved solids were filtered off and dumped into a truck, which hauls the spent material to a scrap dump. Uranium in the filtrate {{was sent to a}} precipitation tank and precipitated with ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH), in presence of phosphoric acid to form UAP (uranyl ammonium phosphate). The resulting slurry was filtered and the uranium bearing cake was introduced to a drying furnace. The dried UAP was sent to the refinery. In addition to the wet system described, several furnaces were installed in the plant for massive metal oxidation, pyrohydrolysis, drying, chip and sludge combustion, etc. Most of the furnaces can be used for more than one of the above operations.|$|E

Eight commercial ceramic materials comprising two red shale, two fire clay, a silica, a five-clay-bonded silicon carbide, a carbon, and a high-alumina brick were evaluated. Samples were exposed for 110 days to 20 wt pct hcl at 50 deg, 70 deg, and 90 deg c and to 30 wt pct hcl at 70 deg c. Statistically {{significant changes in}} cold crushing strength, volume, and weight were generally small or not detected. The leach rates of al, ca, fe, k, mg, na, si, and ti ions were monitored.

The composition and microstructure of the obtained carbon composite were characterized using chemical analysis, XRD and SEM with EDS. The high temperature properties of thermal conductivity, oxidization and corrosion by molten slag and hot metal of the composite were analyzed. Based on these, the type of <b>carbon</b> composite <b>brick</b> worked in a blast furnace hearth for six years was further sampled at different positions.

To support a helpful insight information of mass transfer for the hearth of the No. 2 blast furnace at CSC (China Steel Corporation), a numerical model including the mass transfer of carbon in thermal convective flow from a blast furnace hearth has been developed during the steady tapping process (based on a uninterrupted tapping process assumption). The three dimensional Navier-Stokes equation combined with the transport equations of energy and species with conjugate heat transfer and physical dissolution source is solved by the finite control volume scheme subjected to the segregated iterate under propriety boundary conditions. The results showed the concentration distribution of carbon expressed in terms of mass flux for analyzing the erosion of <b>carbon</b> <b>brick</b> in the blast furnace hearth with the different conditions including the status of dead-man, production of liquid iron, carbon concentration at the inlet, and porosity distribution in coke zone during tapping process at steady state.

40|$|Carbon {{footprint}} is {{broadly defined}} as carbon dioxide (CO 2 center dot) emissions normalized per unit mass {{of a product}} or per unit of an activity. It is considered as an important environmental indicator for comparing various products or activities. Fired solid clay brick is a popular walling material in India. Manufacturing of fired clay bricks involves combustion of fossil fuels during the firing process and during other unit operations and activities. Due to combustion of fossil fuels, dissociation of mineral calcite in the soil during the firing of green bricks and combustion of diesel during transportation of raw materials, the greenhouse gas emissions {{are associated with the}} manufacturing of fired clay bricks. About 250 billion bricks are manufactured annually in India. To fire the green bricks, mainly two types of brick kilns are used in India: Bull's trench kiln and Clamp kilns. The Bull's trench kilns are mainly used in northern and central India whereas the clamps are used in peninsular India. In the present study, <b>carbon</b> footprint of <b>bricks</b> manufactured in the clamps of a major clamp cluster in peninsular India is estimated and is compared with that of bricks manufactured in other types of kilns in India. Karad, District Satara, Maharashtra (India) located in peninsular India has a major cluster of clamp type brick kilns which has more than 300 clamp kiln sites with annual production of approximately 120 million bricks. A field survey of the clamps of Karad is conducted to collect the data about use of soil, fuels and water and its transportation. The CO 2 emissions due to various unit operations and activities in a typical clamp are estimated using guidelines provided by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. These total emissions are normalized per unit mass of fired brick and are presented as carbon footprint of a brick. The statistical mean of the <b>carbon</b> footprints of <b>bricks</b> manufactured in all the surveyed clamps is presented as the <b>carbon</b> footprint of <b>bricks</b> manufactured in the clamps of Karad. The average carbon footprint of the bricks manufactured in the clamps of Karad is estimated as 195 g CO 2 /kg of fired brick and 162 g CO 2 /kg of fired brick respectively, when the CO 2 emissions due to the combustion of biofuels and transportation of raw materials are included or excluded. This is comparable to the carbon footprint of the other popular brick-making technologies, and defies the common notion that clamps are highly inefficient. The <b>carbon</b> footprint of <b>bricks</b> manufactured in the clamps of Karad is lower than that reported for the clay bricks manufactured in tunnel kilns in the United States of America, Canada and the United Kingdom.

40|$|The European Project on "Treatment and Disposal of Irradiated Graphite {{and other}} Carbonaceous Waste (CARBOWASTE) " has been {{launched}} in 2008 under the 7 th EURATOM Framework Programme (FP 7 - 211333), with duration of four years. This project addresses the retrieval, treatment {{and disposal of}} irradiated graphite (i-graphite) including other carbonaceous waste like structural material made of graphite or non-graphitized <b>carbon</b> <b>bricks</b> and fuel coatings (pyrocarbon, silicon carbide). It addresses both existing legacy waste as well as waste from graphite-based nuclear fuel resulting from {{a new generation of}} nuclear reactors (e. g. V/HTR, Fusion). The CARBOWASTE project is of major importance for the deployment of HTR as each HTR module generates about 5, 000 to 10, 000 Mg of contaminated i-graphite containing some Peta-Becquerel of radiocarbon, during a 60 years operational lifetime. Most of this i-graphite is associated with the moderator, which {{is an integral part of}} the HTR fuel element. Significant progress has been achieved with regards to the techniques for separating the coated particles from the moderator graphite of High-Temperature Reactor (HTR) fuel. Pulsed power fragmentation facilities for HTR fuel compacts and HTR pebble fuel have been put into operation and tested with unirradiated dummy fuel. Further separation methods like homogeneous oxidation, use of intercalation compounds, laser techniques, electrochemical deconsolidation, molten-salt methods etc. have also been investigated. Although tests with irradiated fuel are still pending, it can already be stated that head-end facilities for the reprocessing of spent HTR fuel appear to be feasible and that the HTR fuel cycle can be closed. It has been discovered that a significant part of the contamination (including 14 C) can be removed from irradiated graphite by thermal, chemical or even microbiological treatment. The feasibility of the associated processes is experimentally investigated to determine and optimize the decontamination factors. Reuse of the purified material will also be addressed to close the ¿Graphite Cycle¿ for future graphite moderated reactors. The disposal behavior of graphite and carbonaceous wastes and the improvement of suitable waste packages are another focus of the programme. It is strongly recommended to take decommissioning, waste minimization and waste management issues of graphite-moderated reactors already into account when designing new V/HTR concepts. JRC. DDG.

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, a new homogenization-based {{finite element}} model to compute masonry {{structures}} with compressible joints is proposed.

The proposed strain hardening incremental elasto-plastic model is obtained by means of a new step-by-step homogenization method for a running bond masonry structure made of elastic bricks jointed by an elasto-plastic ram. The numerical implicit integration of the model is carried out following an iterative implicit procedure in which the elastic trial stress state is corrected through a return mapping algorithm. The procedure has been implemented in the ABAQUS finite element software and applied to the computation of thermal stresses for the hearths made of small <b>carbon</b> refractory <b>bricks</b> surrounded by very compressible joints.

40|$|The {{properties}} and the vertical {{structure of the}} mixing layer {{as part of the}} planetary boundary layer are of key importance for local air quality. They have a substantial impact on the vertical dispersion of pollutants in the lower atmosphere and thus on their concentrations near the surface. In this study, ceilometer measurements taken {{within the framework of the}} SusKat project (Sustainable Atmosphere for the Kathmandu Valley) are used to investigate the mixing layer height in the Kathmandu Valley, Nepal. The applied method is based on the assumption that the aerosol concentration is nearly constant in the vertical and distinctly higher within the mixing layer than in the air above. Thus, the height with the steepest gradient within the ceilometer backscatter profile marks the top of the mixing layer. Ceilometer and black carbon (BC) measurements conducted from March 2013 through February 2014 provide a unique and important dataset for the analysis of the meteorological and air quality conditions in the Kathmandu Valley. In this study the mean diurnal cycle of the mixing layer height in the Kathmandu Valley for each season (pre- monsoon, monsoon, post-monsoon and winter season) and its dependency on the meteorological situation is in- vestigated. In addition, the impact of the mixing layer height on the BC concentration is analyzed and compared to the relevance of other important processes such as emissions, horizontal advection and deposition. In all seasons the diurnal cycle is typically characterized by low mixing heights during the night, gradually increas- ing after sun rise reaching to maximum values in the afternoon before decreasing again. Seasonal differences can be seen particularly in the height of the mixing layer, e. g. from on average 153 / 1200 m (pre-monsoon) to 241 / 755 m (monsoon season) during the night/day, and the duration of enhanced mixing layer heights during daytime (around 12 hours (pre-monsoon season) to 8 hours (winter)). During the monsoon season, the observed diurnal cycle typ- ically shows the lowest amplitude and the lowest mixing height during the day and the highest in the night and morning hours of all seasons. These characteristics can mainly be explained with frequently present clouds and the associated lack of incoming solar radiation and outgoing longwave radiation. In general there is a clear anti-correlation of the BC concentration and the mixing layer height although this relation is less pronounced in the monsoon season. The shape and magnitude of the BC diurnal cycle differs between the seasons (e. g., daily maximum concentration from around 6 to 50 μg/m 3 depending on the season). This is partly due to the different meteorological conditions including the mixing layer height but also caused by the different (seasonal and diurnal) time profiles of the main emission sources. From late December to April, for instance, brick kilns are major emitters of black <b>carbon.</b> The <b>brick</b> kilns emit continuously throughout the day whereas in the other months sources with more pronounced diurnal cycles, such as traffic and cooking activities, are dominating the total emissions...|$|R
