5|$|The {{majority}} of eukaryotic genes are stored {{on a set}} of large, linear chromosomes. The chromosomes are packed within the nucleus in complex with storage proteins called histones to form a unit called a nucleosome. DNA packaged and condensed in this way is called chromatin. The manner in which DNA is stored on the histones, as well as chemical modifications of the histone itself, regulate whether a particular region of DNA is accessible for gene expression. In addition to genes, eukaryotic chromosomes contain sequences involved in ensuring that the DNA is copied without degradation of end regions and sorted into daughter cells during cell division: replication origins, telomeres and the <b>centromere.</b> Replication origins are the sequence regions where DNA replication is initiated to make two copies of the chromosome. Telomeres are long stretches of repetitive sequence that cap the ends of the linear chromosomes and prevent degradation of coding and regulatory regions during DNA replication. The length of the telomeres decreases each time the genome is replicated and has been implicated in the aging process. The <b>centromere</b> is required for binding spindle fibres to separate sister chromatids into daughter cells during cell division.|$|E
5|$|Components of the RNAi pathway {{are used}} in many eukaryotes in the {{maintenance}} of the organization and structure of their genomes. Modification of histones and associated induction of heterochromatin formation serves to downregulate genes pre-transcriptionally; this process is referred to as RNA-induced transcriptional silencing (RITS), and is carried out by a complex of proteins called the RITS complex. In fission yeast this complex contains argonaute, a chromodomain protein Chp1, and a protein called Tas3 of unknown function. As a consequence, the induction and spread of heterochromatic regions requires the argonaute and RdRP proteins. Indeed, deletion of these genes in the fission yeast S. pombe disrupts histone methylation and <b>centromere</b> formation, causing slow or stalled anaphase during cell division. In some cases, similar processes associated with histone modification have been observed to transcriptionally upregulate genes.|$|E
5|$|The {{karyotype}} generally includes 56chromosomes with a {{total of}} 54major arms (2n=56, FN=54) in specimens from both Bolivia and Brazil; a poorly prepared Paraguayan specimen seems to have a similar karyotype. In this karyotype, all autosomes (non-sex chromosomes) are acrocentric (with one arm so short as to be almost invisible). However, in two specimens from the Brazilian states of Tocantins and São Paulo, one pair of autosomes contains both an acrocentric and a metacentric chromosome (with two equally long arms), yielding an FN of 55. One arm of the metacentric chromosome consists entirely of heterochromatin. Apparently, a whole heterochromatic arm was added to this chromosome; cases of similar variation are known from the rodents Peromyscus, Clyomys, and Thaptomys. Both sex chromosomes are acrocentric, and X is larger than Y. In addition to heterochromatin near the <b>centromere,</b> the Y chromosome contains two large blocks of heterochromatin on its long arm. The karyotype is closely similar to that of Holochilus brasiliensis.|$|E

40|$|SummaryIn {{vertebrate}} cells, <b>centromeres</b> are specified epigenetically {{through the}} deposition of the centromere-specific histone CENP-A. Following CENP-A deposition, additional proteins are assembled on centromeric chromatin. However, it remains unknown whether additional epigenetic features of centromeric chromatin {{are required for}} kinetochore assembly. Here, we used ChIP-seq analysis to examine centromere-specific histone modifications at chicken <b>centromeres,</b> which lack highly repetitive sequences. We found that H 4 K 20 monomethylation (H 4 K 20 me 1) is enriched at <b>centromeres.</b> Immunofluorescence and biochemical analyses revealed that H 4 K 20 me 1 is present at all <b>centromeres</b> in chicken and human cells. Based on immunoprecipitation data, H 4 K 20 me 1 occurs primarily on the histone H 4 that is assembled as part of the CENP-A nucleosome following deposition of CENP-A into <b>centromeres.</b> Targeting the H 4 K 20 me 1 -specific demethylase PHF 8 to <b>centromeres</b> reduces the level of H 4 K 20 me 1 at <b>centromeres</b> and results in kinetochore assembly defects.  We conclude that H 4 K 20 me 1 modification of CENP-A nucleosomes contributes to functional kinetochore assembly...|$|R

From the late 1920s, McClintock studied chromosomes and how they change during reproduction in maize. She developed the technique for visualizing maize chromosomes and used microscopic analysis to demonstrate many fundamental genetic ideas. One of those ideas was the notion of genetic recombination by crossing-over during meiosis—a mechanism by which chromosomes exchange information. She produced the first genetic map for maize, linking regions of the chromosome to physical traits. She demonstrated the role of the telomere and <b>centromere,</b> regions of the chromosome that are important in the conservation of genetic information. She was recognized among the best in the field, awarded prestigious fellowships, and elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1944.|$|E
5|$|The {{karyotype}} in T.talamancae is variable. Samples {{from two}} different localities in Venezuela have 34chromosomes and a fundamental number of 64 chromosomal arms (2n=34, FN=64). Four specimens from another Venezuelan locality each have a different karyotype, {{with the number of}} chromosomes ranging from 40 to 42 and the fundamental number from 66 to perhaps 67. The autosomes (non-sex chromosomes) of the 2n=34 karyotype all have two major arms, but the 2n=40–42 karyotypes include several acrocentric autosomes, which only have one major arm. The 2n=34 karyotype includes two large submetacentric pairs, which have two long arms but one distinctly longer than the other, and one pair of subtelocentric chromosomes, with a long and a much shorter arm, but the 2n=40–42 karyotypes lack the submetacentrics and have another pair of subtelocentrics. Both Robertsonian translocations (fusions of the long arm of one chromosome with the long arm of another and the short arm of the one with the short arm of the other) and pericentric inversions (reversals of part of a chromosome that includes the <b>centromere)</b> are needed to explain {{the difference between the two}} groups. Musser and colleagues, in discussing these karyotypes, assumed that the 2n=40–42 sample was from within a hybrid zone between two karyotypic morphs.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, {{two studies}} further pinpointed the {{responsible}} region to chromosome 11 and a 4.5-Mb covering chromosomal rearrangement. The scientists {{were able to}} show that the first genetic change happened 3.8 million years ago on the resident chromosome, when a part of it broke off and was reintroduced in the wrong direction. This inversion created the faeder allele. About 500,000 years ago another rare recombination event of faeder and resident allele in the very same inverted region lead to the satellite allele. The 4.5 Mb inversion covers 90 genes, {{one of them is the}} <b>centromere</b> coding gene N- CENPN-, which is located exactly at one of the inversion breakpoints. The inactivation of the gene has severe deleterious effects and pedigree data of a captive ruff colony suggests that the inversion is homozygous lethal. Over the course of the past 3.8 million years, further mutations have accumulated within the inversion i.e. three deletions ranging from 3.3 to 17.6 kb. Two of these deletions remove evolutionary highly conserved elements close to two genes- HSD17B2 and SDR42E1-both holding important roles in metabolism of steroid hormones. Hormone measurements around mating time showed that whereas residents have a sharp increase of testosterone, faeders and satellites only experience higher androstenedione levels, a substance which is considered an intermediate in testosterone biosynthesis. The authors conclude that one or more of the deletions act as a cis-acting regulatory mutation which is altering the expression of one or both genes and eventually contributes to the different male phenotypes and behaviour.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two types}} of <b>centromeres.</b> In {{regional}} <b>centromeres,</b> DNA sequences contribute to but do not define function.

In humans, the primary centromeric repeat unit is called α-satellite (or alphoid), although a number of other sequence types are found in this region.|$|R
40|$|A long-standing {{problem in}} {{chromosome}} biology concerns the dynamic nature of <b>centromeres.</b> These chromosomal sites assemble the protein machines called kinetochores that connect chromosomes to the spindle microtubules for segregation to daughter cells during mitosis and meiosis.

40|$|AbstractAccurate {{segregation}} of chromosomes is critical to ensure that each daughter cell receives the full genetic complement. Maintenance of cohesion between sister chromatids, especially at <b>centromeres,</b> is required to segregate chromosomes precisely during mitosis and meiosis. The Drosophila protein MEI-S 332, the founding member of a conserved protein family, is essential in meiosis for maintaining cohesion at <b>centromeres</b> until sister chromatids separate at the metaphase II/anaphase II transition. MEI-S 332 localizes onto <b>centromeres</b> in prometaphase of mitosis or meiosis I, remaining until sister chromatids segregate. We elucidated a mechanism for controlling release of MEI-S 332 from <b>centromeres</b> via phosphorylation by POLO kinase. We demonstrate that POLO antagonizes MEI-S 332 cohesive function and that full POLO activity is needed to remove MEI-S 332 from <b>centromeres,</b> yet this delocalization is not required for sister chromatid separation. POLO phosphorylates MEI-S 332 in vitro, POLO and MEI-S 332 bind each other, and mutation of POLO binding sites prevents MEI-S 332 dissociation from <b>centromeres...</b>|$|R

40|$|Both {{kinetochore}} {{function and}} sister chromatid cohesion can depend upon pericentromere chromatin structure, and {{factors associated with}} heterochromatin have been proposed to have general, conserved roles in distinguishing <b>centromeres</b> and pericentromeres and in conferring pericentromere-intrinsic functions.

A nonphosphorylatable HJURP mutant localizes prematurely to <b>centromeres</b> in S and G 2 phase. This unregulated targeting causes a premature loading of CenH 3 CENP-A at <b>centromeres,</b> and cell-cycle delays ensue. Once recruited to <b>centromeres,</b> HJURP functions to promote CenH 3 CENP-A deposition by a mechanism involving a unique DNA-binding domain.

In normal cell division, each chromosome is copied and then attached to its newly formed copy at the <b>centromere</b> (the center portion of a chromosome). However, in Roberts syndrome cell division, the copies are frequently not attached at the <b>centromere.</b> As a result, the chromosomes do not get lined up properly, which causes the cell to divide very slowly or even to not divide at all.
