40|$|The {{number of}} {{dividend}} paying firms {{has been on}} the decline since the popularity of stock repurchases in the 1980 s, and the recent financial crisis has brought about a wave of dividend reductions and omissions. This dissertation examined the U. S. firms and American <b>Depository</b> <b>Receipts</b> that are listed on the U. S. equity exchanges according to their dividend paying history in the previous twelve quarters. While accounting for {{the state of the economy}}, the firm’s size, profitability, earned equity, and growth opportunities, it determines whether or not the firm will pay a dividend in the next quarter. It also examined the likelihood of a dividend change. Further, returns of firms were examined according to their dividend paying history and the state of the economy using the Fama-French three-factor model. ^ Using forward, backward, and step-wise selection logistic regressions, the results show that firms with a history of regular and uninterrupted dividend payments are likely to continue to pay dividends, while firms that do not have a history of regular dividend payments are not likely to begin to pay dividends or continue to do so. The results of a set of generalized polytomous logistic regressions imply that dividend paying firms are more likely to reduce dividend payments during economic expansions, as opposed to recessions. Also the analysis of returns using the Fama-French three factor model reveals that dividend paying firms are earning significant abnormal positive returns. ^ As a special case, a similar analysis of dividend payment and dividend change was applied to American <b>Depository</b> <b>Receipts</b> that trade on the NYSE, NASDAQ, and AMEX exchanges and are issued by the Bank of New York Mellon. Returns <b>of</b> American <b>Depository</b> <b>Receipts</b> were examined using the Fama-French two-factor model for international firms. The results of the generalized polytomous logistic regression analyses indicate that dividend paying status and economic conditions are also important for dividend level change <b>of</b> American <b>Depository</b> <b>Receipts,</b> and Fama-French two-factor regressions alone do not adequately explain returns for these securities. ...|$|R

In this paper, we extend an ANOVA model by releasing the assumption of independence in time.

We reprise the model with regards to the issue <b>of</b> American <b>Depository</b> <b>Receipts</b> by releasing the time dependence assumption that has been ignored in the literature.

It appears that Chinese firms with the poorest external governance environment stand to benefit the most from cross listing under the ADR programs. Listing in the U.

Dual listing for People's Republic of China (PRC) firms indicates their ability to attract international investors and to become international securities market participants. Using a bivariate generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity model, we examine patterns of information flows related to both pricing and volatility spillover across markets. Results indicate a significant mutual feedback of information between Hong Kong-listed stocks and ADRs. The Hong Kong market appears to play a more important role in influencing the pricing of corresponding companies in the U. S. market, whereas both markets are similarly influential to the volatility spillover. This finding is useful for foreign investment banking and financial services firms operating in China that {{need to understand the}} dual market performance of top PRC stocks. ...|$|R

The findings suggest that US investors in ADRs as a class are exposed to all three forms of risk. Some ADRs exhibit pricing of at least one risk factor and sometimes all three factors.

We find stock prices overweight accruals in general, with accruals overweighting occurring in countries with a common law relative to a code law tradition.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} effect of global {{competition}} for order flows, which arise due to the listing <b>of</b> American <b>Depository</b> <b>Receipts</b> (ADRs) by Indian firms on NYSE, on the local market, especially when there are competing local markets. We find that: (1) Order imbalance can predict stock returns in both order driven (BSE and NSE) and quote driven (NYSE) trading mechanisms. There is no noticeable difference in the magnitude of the order imbalance influence in different trading mechanisms. (2) There has been over all market efficiency for the Indian stocks post-ADRs listing. This confirms that order flow competition and corresponding market fragmentation leads to market efficiency. The results are stronger in the case of BSE market. BSE listed stocks had a dramatic improvement in their market efficiency post-ADRs listing. (3) The global effect in the form of NYSE listing is felt in the local market (NSE), however, vice verse does not hold. (4) We also find evidence of improvement in the local market quality through reduction of spreads. Thus we conclude that competition among markets lead to fragmentized and specialized markets with no single dominant player and competition improves overall efficiency. JEL Classification: G 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this article are to reinvestigate how returns <b>of</b> major American <b>depository</b> <b>receipts</b> (ADRs) from different countries are related to the underlying stock returns and to identify the determinants of ADR risk premiums. We use different types of error-correcting terms in vector error correction models to examine information flows between ADRs and the underlying foreign stocks. General method of moments estimation of conditional international asset pricing model of Dumas and Solnik (1995) is applied to investigate ADR return premiums. We find that stock returns are more affected by disequilibrium between ADR and stock prices in an inefficient way. For US investors, foreign exchange rate risk premiums and world market risk premium (beyond US index) are priced in ADRs returns ex ante. Surprisingly, it is shown that the exchange rate of New Taiwan dollar and the interest rates of Brazil and Taiwan play important roles in determining ADR risk premiums across countries. ...|$|R

The issuer company will make a public offer in India, and residents can bid in exactly the same format and method as they bid for Indian shares. The issue process is exactly the same: the company will file a draft red herring prospectus (DRHP), which will be examined by SEBI. The general body of investors will get a chance to read and review the DRHP as it is a public document, available on the websites of SEBI and the book running lead managers. After SEBI gives its clearance, the company sets the issue dates and files the document with the Registrar of Companies. In the next step, after getting the Registrar’s registration ticket, the company can go ahead with marketing the issue. The issue will be kept open for a fixed number of days, and investors can submit their application forms at the bidding centers. The investors will bid within the price band and the final price will be decided post the closure of the Issue. The receipts will be allotted to the investors in their demat account as is done for equity shares in any public issue.
