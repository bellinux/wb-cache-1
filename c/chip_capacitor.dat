50|$|Niobium {{capacitors}} {{are available}} as SMD <b>chip</b> <b>capacitors</b> and compete with tantalum <b>chip</b> <b>capacitors</b> in certain voltage and capacitance ratings. They {{are available with}} a solid manganese dioxide electrolyte. Niobium capacitors are polarized components by manufacturing principle and may only be operated with DC voltage in correct polarity. Reverse voltage or ripple current higher than specified can destroy the dielectric and thus the capacitor. The destruction of the dielectric may have catastrophic consequences. Manufacturers specify special circuit design rules for the safe operation of niobium capacitors.|$|R

50|$|It is {{simpler to}} {{substitute}} the potentiometer or the SOT part with a trimmable chip resistor or <b>chip</b> <b>capacitor,</b> and the potentiometer adjusting screwdriver {{is replaced by}} the laser trimming.

25|$|Aluminum {{electrolytic}} capacitors form {{the bulk of}} the {{electrolytic capacitors}} used in electronics because of the large diversity of sizes and the inexpensive production. Tantalum electrolytic capacitors, usually used in the SMD version, have a higher specific capacitance than the aluminum electrolytic capacitors and are used in devices with limited space or flat design such as laptops. They are also used in military technology, mostly in axial style, hermetically sealed. Niobium electrolytic <b>chip</b> <b>capacitors</b> are a new development in the market and are intended as a replacement for tantalum electrolytic <b>chip</b> <b>capacitors.</b>|$|R

The lower the ESR the higher the ripple current per volume the better the functionality of the capacitor in the circuit.|$|E

50|$|Passive {{integrated}} transponder (PIT) tags {{consist of}} an integrated circuit <b>chip,</b> <b>capacitor,</b> and antenna coil encased in glass. They have been used since the mid 1980s with scientists studying fish movements. Since then, PIT tags {{have been used to}} study the movement of amphibians, reptiles, birds, and invertebrates. The tags act as a lifetime barcode for an organism and provided they can be scanned, are as reliable as a fingerprint. PIT tags are dormant until activated and therefore do not require any internal source of power throughout their lifespan. To activate the tag, a low-frequency radio signal is emitted by a scanning device that generates a close-range electromagnetic field. The tag then sends a unique alpha-numeric code back to the reader, effectively identifying the individual organism. Internal PIT tags are inserted via large-gauge needles or surgically implanted either subcutaneously or into a body cavity. PIT tagging can be used to answer questions regarding growth rates, survivorship, food webs, and movement patterns. A major advantage over mark-recapture methods is that marked animals {{do not need to be}} recaptured; they just need to pass by an automated reading system antenna.|$|E

50|$|Lowering ESR and ESL {{remains a}} major {{research}} and development objective for all polymer capacitors. Some constructive measures can have also {{a major impact on}} the electrical parameters of capacitors. Smaller ESR values can be achieved for example by parallel connection of several conventional capacitor cells in one case. Three parallel capacitors with an ESR of 60 mΩ each have a resulting ESR of 20 mΩ. This technology is called “multi-anode” construction and will be used at polymer tantalum capacitors. In this construction up to six individual anodes in one case are connected. This design is offered as polymer tantalum <b>chip</b> <b>capacitors</b> as well as lower expensive tantalum <b>chip</b> <b>capacitors</b> with MnO2 electrolyte. Multi-anode polymer tantalum capacitors have ESR values on the single-digit milliohm range.|$|R
