5|$|The {{kitefin shark}} has a {{moderately}} elongated {{body with a}} very short, rounded snout. The eyes and spiracles are large. The lips are thick with pleats or fringes, though are not modified to be suctorial. There are 1621 tooth rows in the upper jaw and 1720 tooth rows in the lower jaw. The upper teeth are small and spike-shaped, curving slightly towards {{the corners of the}} mouth. The lower teeth are very large, knife-shaped, and serrated, with their bases interlocking to form a continuous <b>cutting</b> <b>surface.</b>|$|E
5|$|The upper incisors are opisthodont (with the <b>cutting</b> <b>surface</b> {{oriented}} backwards) {{and have}} orange to yellow enamel. The upper molar rows are either almost parallel or slightly convergent {{with each other}} toward the front. Holochilus and Lundomys are the only other oryzomyines with non-parallel molar rows. The valleys between the cusps of the upper molars extending from {{the inner and outer}} sides overlap slightly across the midlines of the teeth. The molars are high-cusped, almost hypsodont. On M1, the anterocone (the front cusp) is divided into two cuspules on the lingual (inner, towards the tongue) and labial (outer, towards the lips) sides of the teeth. The mesoloph, a crest near the middle of the labial side of the tooth, is long and well developed on each of the three upper molars. On the lower molars (m1 to m3), the cusps on the labial side are located slightly in front of their lingual counterparts. The anteroconid, the front cusp on the m1, is divided in two. The m1, m2, and usually m3 have a mesolophid, a crest corresponding to the mesoloph but located on the lingual side. Each of the lower molars has two roots.|$|E
25|$|The sword {{developed}} from the knife or dagger. A knife is unlike a dagger in that a knife has only one <b>cutting</b> <b>surface,</b> while a dagger has two cutting surfaces. when the construction of longer blades became possible, from the late 3rd millennium BC in the Middle East, first in arsenic copper, then in tin-bronze.|$|E
50|$|Many {{different}} types of cutting tools {{are used in the}} milling process. Milling cutters such as endmills may have <b>cutting</b> <b>surfaces</b> across their entire end surface, {{so that they can be}} drilled into the workpiece (plunging). Milling cutters may also have extended <b>cutting</b> <b>surfaces</b> on their sides to allow for peripheral milling. Tools optimized for face milling tend to have only small cutters at their end corners.|$|R

25|$|Generally, {{the purpose}} of {{altering}} {{the state of the}} ball is to achieve more favourable bowling conditions. Examples of ball tampering would include a fielder applying a substance, such as lip balm or sweetened saliva, to shine one side of the ball or pick the seam of the ball to encourage more swing. Conversely, roughening one side of the ball by use of an abrasive or <b>cutting</b> <b>surface</b> (such as boot spikes or bottle caps) is also ball tampering.|$|E
25|$|An {{advance on}} the basic design was the iron ploughshare, a {{replaceable}} horizontal <b>cutting</b> <b>surface</b> mounted {{on the tip of}} the share. The earliest ploughs with a detachable and replaceable share date from around 1000 BC in the Ancient Near East, and the earliest iron ploughshares from ca. 500 BC in China. Early mouldboards were basically wedges that sat inside the cut formed by the coulter, turning over the soil to the side. The ploughshare spread the cut horizontally below the surface, so when the mouldboard lifted it, a wider area of soil was turned over. Mouldboards are known in Britain from the late 6th century on.|$|E
500|$|The Portuguese dogfish {{typically}} {{reaches a}} length of [...] for males and [...] for females, though specimens up to [...] long have been recorded. Sharks in the Mediterranean are smaller, growing no more than [...] long. This species has a flattened, broadly rounded snout that is shorter than the mouth is wide. The nostrils are preceded by short flaps of skin. The eyes are large and oval in shape, positioned laterally {{on the head and}} equipped with a reflective tapetum lucidum that produces a yellow-green [...] "eye shine". The mouth is wide and slightly arched, with moderately thick, smooth lips and short furrows at the corners extending onto both jaws. The upper teeth are slender and upright with a single cusp, numbering 4368 rows. The lower teeth have a short, strongly angled cusp and number 2941 rows; their bases interlock to form a continuous <b>cutting</b> <b>surface.</b> The five pairs of gill slits are short and nearly vertical.|$|E
50|$|The microsculpture of the protoconch {{consists}} of prismatic crystals. The apical folds are fused. The rachidian and the lateral {{teeth of the}} radula lack <b>cutting</b> <b>surfaces.</b> They have one or several gill leaflets {{on the left side}} of the soft body.|$|R
50|$|Self-tapping screws can {{be divided}} into two classes; those that {{displace}} material (especially plastic and thin metal sheets) without removing it are termed thread-forming self-tapping screws; self-tappers with sharp <b>cutting</b> <b>surfaces</b> that remove the material as they are inserted are termed self-cutting.|$|R

500|$|The {{skull of}} Psittacosaurus is highly {{modified}} {{compared to other}} ornithischian dinosaurs of its time. Extremely tall in height and short in length, the skull has an almost round [...] in some species. The portion {{in front of the}} orbit (eye socket) is only 40% of total skull length, shorter than any other known ornithischian. The lower jaws of psittacosaurs are characterised by a bulbous vertical ridge down the centre of each tooth. Both upper and lower jaws sport a pronounced beak, formed from the rostral and predentary bones, respectively. The bony core of the beak may have been sheathed in keratin to provide a sharp <b>cutting</b> <b>surface</b> for cropping plant material. As the generic name suggests, the short skull and beak superficially resemble those of modern parrots. Psittacosaurus skulls share several adaptations with more derived ceratopsians, such as the unique rostral bone {{at the tip of the}} upper jaw, and the flared jugal (cheek) bones. There is still no sign of the bony neck frill or prominent facial horns which would develop in later ceratopsians. Bony horns protrude from the skull of P. sibiricus, but these are thought to be an example of convergent evolution.|$|E
500|$|The {{distinctive}} claw, on {{the second}} digit of dromaeosaurids, has traditionally been depicted as a slashing weapon; its assumed use being to cut and disembowel prey. In the [...] "Fighting Dinosaurs" [...] specimen, the Velociraptor lies underneath, with one of its sickle claws apparently embedded in the throat of its prey, while the beak of Protoceratops is clamped down upon the right forelimb of its attacker. This suggests Velociraptor may have used its sickle claw to pierce vital organs of the throat, such as the jugular vein, carotid artery, or trachea (windpipe), rather than slashing the abdomen. The inside edge of the claw was rounded and not unusually sharp, which may have precluded any sort of cutting or slashing action, although only the bony core of the claw is known. The thick abdominal wall of skin and muscle of large prey species {{would have been difficult}} to slash without a specialized <b>cutting</b> <b>surface.</b> The slashing hypothesis was tested during a 2005 BBC documentary, The Truth About Killer Dinosaurs. The producers of the program created an artificial Velociraptor leg with a sickle claw and used a pork belly to simulate the dinosaur's prey. Though the sickle claw did penetrate the abdominal wall, it was unable to tear it open, indicating that the claw was not used to disembowel prey.|$|E

5000|$|Apart from manufacturing, in-machine tool {{measurement}} using touch-probe or {{laser technology}} allows cutting tools to be reconditioned. During normal use, cutting edges either wear and/or chip. The geometric features of cutting tools can be automatically measured within the CNC tool grinder and the tool ground to return <b>cutting</b> <b>surfaces</b> to optimal condition.|$|R
50|$|The <b>cutting</b> <b>surfaces</b> of a {{milling cutter}} are {{generally}} made of a hard and temperature-resistant material, so that they wear slowly. A low cost cutter may have surfaces made of high speed steel. More expensive but slower-wearing materials include cemented carbide. Thin film coatings may be applied to decrease friction or further increase hardness.|$|R
5000|$|In milling {{applications}} on hardware {{with five}} or more axes, a separate finishing process called contouring can be performed. Instead of stepping down in fine-grained increments to approximate a surface, the work piece is rotated to make the <b>cutting</b> <b>surfaces</b> of the tool tangent to the ideal part features. This produces an excellent surface finish with high dimensional accuracy.|$|R
2500|$|Part separation: A very {{important}} {{function of the}} medium is to separate parts during the deburring, <b>cutting,</b> <b>surface</b> improving or burnishing operations. [...] The media:parts volume ratio is normally used to control the amount of part-on-part contact which will occur in a vibratory or tumble finishing operation. [...] At low ratios, considerable part-on-part contact occurs, while at higher ratios part-on-part contact is limited.|$|E
2500|$|The {{abrasive}} {{cuts the}} surface of the workpiece in three phases. The first phase is when the abrasive first contacts the workpiece surface: dull grains of the abrasive fracture and fall away leaving a new sharp <b>cutting</b> <b>surface.</b> In the second phase the abrasive [...] "self dresses" [...] while most of the stock is being removed. Finally, the abrasive grains become dull as they work which improves the surface geometry.|$|E
2500|$|Lightly built, {{the smooth}} lanternshark {{has a large}} head with a pointed snout, large oval eyes, and {{nostrils}} with short anterior skin flaps. There are 2231 tooth rows in the upper jaw and 3053 tooth rows in the lower jaw. Each upper tooth has a narrow smooth-edged central cusp flanked by 12 tiny cusplets; mature males over [...] long grow additional pairs of lateral cusplets with age. The lower teeth are smooth, knife-like, and angled, with their bases interlocking to form a continuous <b>cutting</b> <b>surface.</b> The five pairs of gill slits are long.|$|E

The specimens of 5  mm thick, which were cut from tangential section using microtome, were mounted on conductive adhesive tape. Then, the <b>cutting</b> <b>surfaces</b> were sputter-coated gold and scanned in an S 4800 SEM with the magnification of up to 800, 000 ×.|$|R
50|$|Jugulator {{is known}} {{primarily}} from isolated teeth and dentaries. The species is most distinctive {{in regards to}} its large size, being among the largest mammals in the region, some lower molars exceeding 5 mm in length and with an estimated body weight of about 750 g. The medial lower incisor is greatly enlarged, with a mitten-shaped crown that bears sharp <b>cutting</b> <b>surfaces.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Among the {{smallest}} of extant sharks, the smalleye pygmy shark attains a maximum recorded length of [...] It is shaped like a cigar and has a bulbous, pointed snout. The eyes are relatively small, with their diameters measuring 4366% {{as long as the}} snout (compared to 6182% in S. laticaudus). The eyes of this species also differ from S. laticaudus in that the upper rim of the eye socket is chevron-shaped rather than nearly straight. The nostrils lack substantially expanded skin flaps in front. The mouth is nearly transverse and bears thin lips; a pair of papillae (nipple-like structures) is on the upper lip that is absent in S. laticaudus. There are 2027 upper tooth rows and 1823 lower tooth rows. The upper teeth are slender and upright. The larger, broader lower teeth have angled and knife-like cusps, and interlock to form a continuous <b>cutting</b> <b>surface.</b> The five pairs of gill slits are tiny and uniform.|$|E
2500|$|The dwarf lanternshark {{appears to}} reach a maximum length of about [...] (female). It has a long, wide, {{flattened}} head comprising a fourth to a fifth of its total length. The eyes are large, {{twice as long as}} high, with the anterior and posterior corners acute. The nares are large and preceded by poorly developed flaps of skin. There are 2532 tooth rows in the upper jaw and 3034 tooth rows in the lower jaw. The upper teeth of adult males have a single cusp flanked by two pairs of smaller cusplets, while the upper teeth of females are more robust and have only one pair of lateral cusplets flanking the central cusp. The lower teeth each have a single, strongly oblique cusp, and their bases are interlocked to form a continuous <b>cutting</b> <b>surface.</b> Scattered, sparse papillae are inside the mouth and on the edges of the gill arches. The five pairs of gill slits are small.|$|E
