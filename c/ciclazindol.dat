50|$|<b>Ciclazindol</b> (WY-23,409) is an {{antidepressant}} and {{anorectic drug}} of the tetracyclic chemical class {{that was developed}} in the mid to late 1970s, but was never marketed. It acts as a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, {{and to a lesser extent}} as a dopamine reuptake inhibitor. <b>Ciclazindol</b> has no effects on the SERT, 5-HT receptors, mACh receptors, or α-adrenergic receptors, and has only weak affinity for the H1 receptor. As suggested by its local anesthetic properties, <b>ciclazindol</b> may also inhibit sodium channels. It is known to block potassium channels as well.|$|E
40|$|The author {{describes}} a controlled, double-blind, comparative {{trial of a}} new tetracyclic compound, <b>ciclazindol</b> (WY 23409), against amitriptyline {{in the treatment of}} thirty-five patients admitted to hospital with depressive illness. Each patient was randomly allocated to three weeks treatment with either 50 mg b. d. <b>ciclazindol</b> or 50 mg b. d. amitriptyline. In the event of a poor response the dose level was raised to 75 mg b. d. Separation of cases of endogenous depression and severity of depression were assessed by the Levine-Pilowsky Depression Questionnaire, a self-rating technique. Severity of depression was also assessed using the Hamilton Rating Scale. No significant difference was noted between the drugs in either the degree or the rate ofresponse nor when the endogenous cases alone were studied. The interesting observation was made that only one-third of <b>ciclazindol</b> patients gained weight compared to almost three-quarters ofthe amitriptyline group and the mean weight gain of the latter was over double that of the <b>ciclazindol</b> group. The author concludes that <b>ciclazindol</b> offers promise and merits further study using higher dosage levels once its full safety trials have been completed...|$|E
40|$|Two {{electrode}} voltage clamp and single channel recordings {{were used to}} investigate the actions of various ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channel inhibitors on cloned KATP channels, expressed in Xenopus oocytes and HEK 293 cells. Oocytes expressing Kir 6. 2 and SUR 1 gave rise to inwardly rectifying K+ currents following bath application of 3 [*]mM sodium azide. Inside-out recordings from non-azide treated oocytes demonstrated the presence of KATP channels which were activated by direct application of 3 [*]mM azide and 0. 1 [*]mM Mg-ATP. Tolbutamide inhibited azide-induced macroscopic Kir 6. 2 -SUR 1 currents, recorded from Xenopus oocytes, with an IC 50 value similar to native KATP channels. <b>Ciclazindol</b> and englitazone also inhibited these currents in a concentration-dependent manner, but with relative potencies substantially less than for native KATP channels. Single channel currents recorded from inside-out patches excised from oocytes expressing Kir 6. 2 -SUR 1 currents were inhibited by tolbutamide, Mg-ATP, englitazone and <b>ciclazindol,</b> {{in the absence of}} azide, with potencies similar to native KATP channels. In the presence of azide, Kir 6. 2 -SUR 1 currents were inhibited by englitazone and tolbutamide but not <b>ciclazindol.</b> Single channel currents derived from Kir 6. 2 Δ 26, expressed in HEK 293 cells, were inhibited by <b>ciclazindol</b> and englitazone irrespective of the absence or presence of SUR 1. In conclusion, heterologously expressed Kir 6. 2 and SUR 1 recapitulate the pharmacological profile of native pancreatic β-cell KATP channels. However, currents induced by azide exhibit a substantially reduced sensitivity to <b>ciclazindol.</b> It is likely that <b>ciclazindol</b> and englitazone inhibit KATP currents by interaction with the Kir 6. 2 subunit...|$|E
40|$|Twenty-nine healthy volunteers {{participated in}} an {{experiment}} lasting for 8 weeks: Phase I (2 weeks) [...] pre-treatment control period; Phase II (4 weeks) [...] medication with either <b>ciclazindol</b> hydrochloride (50 mg twice daily), or desipramine hydrochloride (50 mg twice daily) or lactose placebo (twice daily) administered in a single-blind fashion; Phase II (2 weeks) [...] recovery. Experimental sessions took place twice weekly for the photographic assessment of resting pupil diameter, and {{for the assessment of}} one of the following pupillary responses: mydriatic response to methoxamine, mydriatic response to tyramine, miotic response to pilocarpine. Resting pupil diameter increased during medication with either <b>ciclazindol</b> or desipramine. Methoxamine-evoked mydriasis and tyramine-evoked mydriasis were antagonized by both <b>ciclazindol</b> and desipramine. Pilocarpine-evoked miosis was potentiated by both <b>ciclazindol</b> and desipramine. The steady-state plasma levels (mean +/- s. e. mean) of the antidepressants were: ciclazindol: 5. 90 +/- 0. 74 microM; desipramine: 0. 60 +/- 0. 17 microM. The antagonism of methoxamine-evoked mydriasis is likely to reflect the blockade of postsynaptic alpha 1 -adrenoceptors in the iris by the antidepressants, whereas the antagonism of tyramine-evoked mydriasis may reflect both the blockade of uptake of tyramine into presynaptic adrenergic terminals and the blockade of postsynaptic alpha-adrenoceptors. There is no immediate explanation for the potentiation of pilocarpine-evoked miosis by the two antidepressants...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} the {{antidiabetic}} agent englitazone and the anorectic drug <b>ciclazindol</b> on ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels activated by diazoxide and leptin were examined in the CRI-G 1 insulin-secreting cell line using whole cell and single channel recording techniques. In whole cell current clamp mode, the hyperglycaemic agent diazoxide (200 [*]μM) and the ob gene product leptin (10 [*]nM) hyperpolarised CRI-G 1 cells by activation of KATP currents. KATP currents activated by either agent were inhibited by tolbutamide, with an IC 50 for leptin-activated currents of 9. 0 [*]μM. Application of englitazone produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of KATP currents activated by diazoxide (200 [*]μM) with an IC 50 value of 7. 7 [*]μM and a Hill coefficient of 0. 87. In inside-out patches englitazone (30 [*]μM) also inhibited KATP channel currents activated by diazoxide by 90. 8 ± 4. 1 %. In contrast, englitazone (1 – 30 [*]μM) failed to inhibit KATP channels activated by leptin, although higher concentrations (> 30 [*]μM) did inhibit leptin actions. The englitazone concentration inhibition curve {{in the presence of}} leptin resulted in an IC 50 value and Hill coefficient of 52 [*]μM and 3. 2, respectively. Similarly, in inside-out patches englitazone (30 [*]μM) failed to inhibit the activity of KATP channels in the presence of leptin. <b>Ciclazindol</b> also inhibited KATP currents activated by diazoxide (200 [*]μM) in a concentration-dependent manner, with an IC 50 and Hill coefficient of 127 [*]nM and 0. 33, respectively. Furthermore, application of <b>ciclazindol</b> (1 [*]μM) to the intracellular surface of inside-out patches inhibited KATP channel currents activated by diazoxide (200 [*]μM) by 86. 6 ± 8. 1 %. However, <b>ciclazindol</b> was much less effective at inhibiting KATP currents activated by leptin (10 [*]nM). <b>Ciclazindol</b> (0. 1 – 10 [*]μM) had no effect on KATP currents activated by leptin, whereas higher concentrations (> 10 [*]μM) did cause inhibition with an IC 50 value of 40 [*]μM and an associated Hill coefficient of 2. 7. Similarly, <b>ciclazindol</b> (1 [*]μM) had no significant effect on KATP channel activity following leptin addition in excised inside-out patches. In conclusion, KATP currents activated by diazoxide and leptin show different sensitivity to englitazone and <b>ciclazindol.</b> This may be due to differences in the mechanism of activation of KATP channels by diazoxide and leptin...|$|E

40|$|In the {{presence}} of NG-nitro-L-arginine (L-NOARG, 0. 3 [*]mM) and indomethacin (10 [*]μM), the relaxations induced by acetylcholine and the calcium (Ca) ionophore A 23187 {{are considered to be}} mediated by endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF) in the guinea-pig basilar artery. Inhibitors of adenosine 5 ′-triphosphate (ATP) -sensitive potassium (K) -channels (KATP; glibenclamide, 10 [*]μM), voltage-sensitive K-channels (KV; dendrotoxin-I, 0. 1 [*]μM or 4 -aminopyridine, 1 [*]mM), small (SKCa; apamin, 0. 1 [*]μM) and large (BKCa; iberiotoxin, 0. 1 [*]μM) conductance Ca-sensitive K-channels did not affect the L-NOARG/indomethacin-resistant relaxation induced by acetylcholine. Synthetic charybdotoxin (0. 1 [*]μM), an inhibitor of BKCa and KV, caused a rightward shift of the concentration-response curve for acetylcholine and reduced the maximal relaxation in {{the presence}} of L-NOARG and indomethacin, whereas the relaxation induced by A 23187 was not significantly inhibited. A combination of charybdotoxin (0. 1 [*]μM) and apamin (0. 1 [*]μM) abolished the L-NOARG/indomethacin-resistant relaxations induced by acetylcholine and A 23187. However, the acetylcholine-induced relaxation was not affected by a combination of iberiotoxin (0. 1 [*]μM) and apamin (0. 1 [*]μM). <b>Ciclazindol</b> (10 [*]μM), an inhibitor of KV in rat portal vein smooth muscle, inhibited the L-NOARG/indomethacin-resistant relaxations induced by acetylcholine and A 23187, and the relaxations were abolished when <b>ciclazindol</b> (10 [*]μM) was combined with apamin (0. 1 [*]μM). Human pial arteries from two out of four patients displayed an L-NOARG/indomethacin-resistant relaxation in response to substance P. This relaxation was abolished in both cases by pretreatment with the combination of charybdotoxin (0. 1 [*]μM) and apamin (0. 1 [*]μM), whereas each toxin had little effect alone. The results suggest that KV, but not KATP and BKCa, is involved in the EDHF-mediated relaxation in the guinea-pig basilar artery. The synergistic action of apamin and charybdotoxin (or <b>ciclazindol)</b> could indicate that both KV and SKCa are activated by EDHF. However, a single type of K-channel, which may be structurally related to KV and allosterically regulated by apamin, could also be the target for EDHF...|$|E
40|$|In the rat hepatic artery, the acetylcholine-induced {{relaxation}} {{mediated by}} endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF) is abolished {{by a combination}} of apamin and charybdotoxin, inhibitors of small (SKCa) and large (BKCa) conductance calcium-sensitive potassium (K) -channels, respectively, but not by each toxin alone. The selective BKCa inhibitor iberiotoxin cannot replace charybdotoxin in this combination. Since delayed rectifier K-channels (KV) represent another target for charybdotoxin, we explored the possible involvement of KV in EDHF-mediated relaxation in this artery. The KV inhibitors, agitoxin- 2 (0. 3 [*]μM), kaliotoxin (0. 3 [*]μM), β-dendrotoxin (0. 3 [*]μM), dofetilide (1 [*]μM) and terikalant (10 [*]μM), each in combination with apamin (0. 3 [*]μM) had no effect on the EDHF-mediated relaxation induced by acetylcholine in the presence of Nω-nitro-L-arginine (0. 3 [*]mM) and indomethacin (10 [*]μM), inhibitors of nitric oxide (NO) synthase and cyclo-oxygenase, respectively (n= 2 – 3). Although the KV inhibitor margatoxin (0. 3 [*]μM) was also without effect (n= 5), the combination of margatoxin and apamin produced a small inhibition of the response (pEC 50 and Emax values were 7. 5 ± 0. 0 and 95 ± 1 % in the absence and 7. 0 ± 0. 1 and 81 ± 6 % in the presence of margatoxin plus apamin, respectively; n= 6; P< 0. 05). <b>Ciclazindol</b> (10 [*]μM) partially inhibited the EDHF-mediated relaxation by shifting the acetylcholine-concentration-response curve 12 fold to the right (n= 6; P< 0. 05) and abolished the response when combined with apamin (0. 3 [*]μM; n= 6). This combination did not inhibit acetylcholine-induced relaxations mediated by endothelium-derived NO (n= 5). A 4 -aminopyridine-sensitive delayed rectifier current (IK(V)) was identified in freshly-isolated single smooth muscle cells from rat hepatic artery. None of the cells displayed a rapidly-activating and -inactivating A-type current. Neither charybdotoxin (0. 3 [*]μM; n= 3) nor <b>ciclazindol</b> (10 [*]μM; n= 5), alone or in combination with apamin (0. 3 [*]μM; n= 4 – 5), had an effect on IK(V). A tenfold higher concentration of <b>ciclazindol</b> (0. 1 [*]mM, n= 4) markedly inhibited IK(V), but this effect was not increased in the additional presence of apamin (0. 3 [*]μM; n= 2). By use of membranes prepared from rat brain cortex, [125 I]-charybdotoxin binding was consistent with an interaction at a single site with a KD of approximately 25 [*]pM. [125 I]-charybdotoxin binding was unaffected by iberiotoxin (0. 1 [*]μM, n= 6), but was increased by apamin in a concentration-dependent manner (Emax 43 ± 10 %, P< 0. 05 and pEC 50 7. 1 ± 0. 2; n= 7 – 8). Agitoxin- 2 (10 [*]nM) displaced [125 I]-charybdotoxin binding by 91 ± 3 % (n= 6) and prevented the effect of apamin (1 [*]μM; n= 6). It is concluded that the EDHF-mediated relaxation in the rat hepatic artery is not mediated by the opening of either KV or BKCa. Instead, the target K-channels for EDHF seem to be structurally related to both KV and BKCa. The possibility that a subtype of SKCa may be the target for EDHF is discussed...|$|E

The IKCa inhibitors clotrimazole (3 [*]μM) and 2 -chlorophenyl-bisphenyl-methanol (3 [*]μM) strongly depressed EDHF relaxations when {{each of them}} was combined with apamin (300 [*]nM). The cytochrome P 450 mono-oxygenase inhibitor ketoconazole (10 [*]μM) had no effect {{in the presence of}} apamin. <b>Ciclazindol</b> (10 [*]μM), which abolishes EDHF relaxations in the presence of apamin, almost completely prevented the calcium ionophore (A 23187) stimulated 86 Rb+ influx via the Gardos channel (IKCa) in human erythrocytes. The Na+/K+ ATPase inhibitor ouabain (500 [*]μM) and the KIR blocker Ba 2 + (30 [*]μM) neither alone nor in combination inhibited EDHF relaxations. Ba 2 + was also without effect in the presence of either apamin or charybdotoxin. In contrast to EDHF, an increase in extracellular [K+] from 4. 6 [*]mM to 9. 6, 14. 6 and 19. 6 [*]mM inconsistently relaxed arteries. In K+-free physiological salt solution, re-admission of K+ always caused complete and sustained relaxations which were abolished by ouabain but unaffected by Ba 2 +.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{englitazone}} sodium, an antidiabetic agent, on ion channel {{activity in the}} CRI-G 1 insulin secreting cell line was examined by use of the patch clamp technique. Application of englitazone {{to the outside of}} CRI-G 1 cells in the whole-cell recording configuration produced concentration-dependent inhibition of KATP currents with an IC 50 value of 8 [*]μM. The inhibition of the K+ current was not affected by the removal of Mg 2 + ions from or the addition of trypsin to the solution bathing the intracellular surface of the cell membrane. Englitazone also inhibited KATP channel activity in recordings from inside out excised membrane patches. The concentration-dependence of inhibition was identical to that observed in whole-cell recordings and was voltage-independent. Single channel recordings confirmed that neither the absence or presence of Mg 2 + ions nor the addition of trypsin at the intracellular surface of the membrane influenced the inhibition of KATP channels by englitazone. Englitazone also inhibited Ca 2 +-activated non-selective cation (NSCa) channels in inside-out patches in a concentration-dependent and voltage-independent manner with an IC 50 value of 10 [*]μM. In comparison, the non-sulphonylurea KATP channel blocker <b>ciclazindol</b> produced a slight voltage-dependent inhibition of the NSCa channel at a concentration of 20 [*]μM. In whole-cell recordings englitazone, at a relatively high concentration (50 [*]μM) in comparison with that required to block KATP and NSCa channels, inhibited voltage-activated Ca 2 + currents by 33 % but did not inhibit voltage-activated K+ and Na+ currents. It is concluded that englitazone is a novel blocker of NSCa and KATP channels. The inhibition of KATP channels occurs following procedures that dissociate sulphonylurea receptor coupling to the channel. The equipotent and voltage-independent inhibition of NSCa and KATP channels by englitazone may indicate a common mechanism of block...|$|E
40|$|Relaxation of the methoxamine-precontracted rat small {{mesenteric}} artery by endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF) {{was compared}} with relaxation to the cannabinoid, anandamide (arachidonylethanolamide). EDHF {{was produced in}} a concentration- and endothelium-dependent fashion {{in the presence of}} NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 100 [*]μM) by either carbachol (pEC 50 [negative logarithm of the EC 50]= 6. 19 ± 0. 01, Rmax [maximum response]= 93. 2 ± 0. 4 %; n= 14) or calcium ionophore A 23187 (pEC 50 = 6. 46 ± 0. 02, Rmax= 83. 6 ± 3. 6 %; n= 8). Anandamide responses were independent of the presence of endothelium or L-NAME (control with endothelium: pEC 50 = 6. 31 ± 0. 06, Rmax= 94. 7 ± 4. 6 %; n= 10; with L-NAME: pEC 50 = 6. 33 ± 0. 04, Rmax= 93. 4 ± 6. 0 %; n= 4). The selective cannabinoid receptor antagonist, SR 141716 A (1 [*]μM) caused rightward shifts of the concentration-response curves to both carbachol (2. 5 fold) and A 23187 (3. 3 fold). It also antagonized anandamide relaxations in {{the presence or absence of}} endothelium giving a 2 fold shift in each case. SR 141716 A (10 [*]μM) greatly reduced the Rmax values for EDHF-mediated relaxations to carbachol (control, 93. 2 ± 0. 4 %; SR 141716 A, 10. 7 ± 2. 5 %; n= 5; P< 0. 001) and A 23187 (control, 84. 8 ± 2. 1 %; SR 141716 A, 3. 5 ± 2. 3 %; n= 6; P< 0. 001) but caused a 10 fold parallel shift in the concentration-relaxation curve for anandamide without affecting Rmax. Precontraction with 60 [*]mM KCl significantly reduced (P< 0. 01; n= 4 for all) relaxations to 1 [*]μM carbachol (control 68. 8 ± 5. 6 % versus 17. 8 ± 7. 1 %), A 23187 (control 71. 4 ± 6. 1 % versus 3. 9 ± 0. 45 %) and anandamide (control 71. 1 ± 7. 0 % versus 5. 2 ± 3. 6 %). Similar effects were seen in the presence of 25 [*]mM K+. Incubation of vessels with pertussis toxin (PTX; 400 [*]ng[*]ml− 1, 2 [*]h) also reduced (P< 0. 01; n= 4 for all) relaxations to 1 [*]μM carbachol (control 63. 5 ± 7. 5 % versus 9. 0 ± 3. 2 %), A 23187 (control 77. 0 ± 5. 8 % versus 16. 2 ± 7. 1 %) and anandamide (control 89. 8 ± 2. 2 % versus 17. 6 ± 8. 7 %). Incubation of vessels with the protease inhibitor phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride (PMSF; 200 [*]μM) significantly potentiated (P< 0. 01), to a similar extent (∼ 2 fold), relaxation to A 23187 (pEC 50 : control, 6. 45 ± 0. 04; PMSF, 6. 74 ± 0. 10; n= 4) and anandamide (pEC 50 : control, 6. 31 ± 0. 02; PMSF, 6. 61 ± 0. 08; n= 8). PMSF also potentiated carbachol responses both in the presence (pEC 50 : control, 6. 25 ± 0. 01; PMSF, 7. 00 ± 0. 01; n= 4; P< 0. 01) and absence (pEC 50 : control, 6. 41 ± 0. 04; PMSF, 6. 88 ± 0. 04; n= 4; P< 0. 001) of L-NAME. Responses to the nitric oxide donor S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) were also potentiated by PMSF (pEC 50 : control, 7. 51 ± 0. 06; PMSF, 8. 00 ± 0. 05, n= 4, P< 0. 001). EDHF-mediated relaxation to carbachol was significantly attenuated by the K+ channel blocker tetraethylammonium (TEA; 1 [*]mM) (pEC 50 : control, 6. 19 ± 0. 01; TEA, 5. 61 ± 0. 01; n= 6; P< 0. 01). In contrast, TEA (1 [*]mM) had no effect on EDHF-mediated relaxation to A 23187 (pEC 50 : control, 6. 47 ± 0. 04; TEA, 6. 41 ± 0. 02, n= 4) or on anandamide (pEC 50 : control, 6. 28 ± 0. 06; TEA, 6. 09 ± 0. 02; n= 5). TEA (10 [*]mM) significantly (P< 0. 01) reduced the Rmax for anandamide (control, 94. 3 ± 4. 0 %; 10 [*]mM TEA, 60. 7 ± 4. 4 %; n= 5) but had no effect on the Rmax to carbachol or A 23187. BaCl 2 (100 [*]μM), considered to be selective for blockade of inward rectifier K+ channels, had no significant effect on relaxations to carbachol or A 23187, but caused a small shift in the anandamide concentration-response curve (pEC 50 : control, 6. 39 ± 0. 01; Ba 2 +, 6. 20 ± 0. 01; n= 4; P< 0. 01). BaCl 2 (1 [*]mM; which causes non-selective block of K+ channels) significantly (P< 0. 01) attenuated relaxations to all three agents (pEC 50 values: carbachol, 5. 65 ± 0. 02; A 23187, 5. 84 ± 0. 04; anandamide, 5. 95 ± 0. 02; n= 4 for each). Apamin (1 [*]μM), a selective blocker of small conductance, Ca 2 +-activated, K+ channels (SKCa), 4 -aminopyridine (1 [*]mM), a blocker of delayed rectifier, voltage-dependent, K+ channels (Kv), and <b>ciclazindol</b> (10 [*]μM), an inhibitor of Kv and adenosine 5 ′-triphosphate (ATP) -sensitive K+ channels (KATP), significantly reduced EDHF-mediated relaxations to carbachol, but had no significant effects on A 23187 or anandamide responses. Glibenclamide (10 [*]μM), a KATP inhibitor and charybdotoxin (100 or 300 [*]nM), a blocker of several K+ channel subtypes, had no significant effect on relaxations to any of the agents. Iberiotoxin (50 [*]nM), an inhibitor of large conductance, Ca 2 +-activated, K+ channels (BKCa), had no significant effect on the relaxation responses, either alone or in combination with apamin (1 [*]μM). Also, a combination of apamin (1 [*]μM) with either glibenclamide (10 [*]μM) or 4 -aminopyridine (1 [*]mM) did not inhibit relaxation to carbachol significantly more than apamin alone. Neither combination had any significant effect on relaxation to A 23187 or anandamide. A combination of apamin (1 [*]μM) with charybdotoxin (100 [*]nM) abolished EDHF-mediated relaxation to carbachol, but had no significant effect on that to A 23187. Apamin (1 [*]μM) and charybdotoxin (300 [*]nM) together consistently inhibited the response to A 23187, while apamin (1 [*]μM) and <b>ciclazindol</b> (10 [*]μM) together inhibited relaxations to both carbachol and A 23187. None of these toxin combinations had any significant effect on relaxation to anandamide. It was concluded that the differential sensitivity to K+ channel blockers of EDHF-mediated responses to carbachol and A 23187 might be due to actions on endothelial generation of EDHF, as well as its actions on the vascular smooth muscle, and suggests care must be taken in choosing the means of generating EDHF when making comparative studies. Also, the relaxations to EDHF and anandamide may involve activation of cannabinoid receptors, coupled via PTX-sensitive G-proteins to activation of K+ conductances. The results support the hypothesis that EDHF is an endocannabinoid but relaxations to EDHF and anandamide show differential sensitivity to K+ channel blockers, therefore it is likely that anandamide is not identical to EDHF in the small rat mesenteric artery...|$|E
