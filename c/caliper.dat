5|$|Hannah Dodd {{was born}} on 27 April 1992, and is from Arcadia, New South Wales. She has sacral {{agenesis}} and spina bifida with upper limb dystonia, and is missing four vertebrae in her back. When she was about a year old, her kidneys started failing. Her entire renal system needed to be reconstructed. She has two older brothers. She can walk with the aide of a <b>caliper,</b> and also uses a wheelchair. , she is a horse riding teacher and student at the University of Western Sydney where she is majoring in sports and exercise science.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{archaeology}} {{has led to}} {{the discovery}} of Han artwork portraying inventions which were otherwise absent in Han literary sources. This includes the crank handle. Han pottery tomb models of farmyards and gristmills possess the first known depictions of crank handles, which were used to operate the fans of winnowing machines. The machine was used to separate chaff from grain, but the Chinese of later dynasties also employed the crank handle for silk-reeling, hemp-spinning, flour-sifting, and drawing water from a well using the windlass. To measure distance traveled, the Han-era Chinese also created the odometer cart. This invention is depicted in Han artwork by the 2nd century CE, yet detailed written descriptions were not offered until the 3rd century CE. The wheels of this device rotated a set of gears which in turn forced mechanical figures to bang gongs and drums that alerted the travelers of the distance traveled (measured in li). From existing specimens found at archaeological sites, it is known that Han-era craftsmen made use of the sliding metal <b>caliper</b> to make minute measurements. Although Han-era calipers bear incised inscriptions of the exact day of the year they were manufactured, they are not mentioned in any Han literary sources.|$|E
25|$|Another type of {{floating}} <b>caliper</b> is a swinging <b>caliper.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... (J6A) Black painted <b>calipers</b> (When ordered with Z07 package, <b>calipers</b> {{change to}} (J6D) Dark Gray <b>calipers).</b>|$|R
50|$|The IS 350 shares larger braking discs and <b>calipers</b> {{borrowed}} from the GS 430; the IS 350's larger <b>calipers</b> are four-piston rather than the two-piston front <b>calipers</b> of the IS 250.|$|R
50|$|There are 6-piston front <b>calipers</b> and 4-piston rear <b>calipers,</b> {{both with}} {{ventilated}} discs and high-friction pads.|$|R
25|$|Generally road-going {{vehicles}} {{have two}} brake pads per <b>caliper,</b> while {{up to six}} are installed on each racing <b>caliper,</b> with varying frictional properties in a staggered pattern for optimum performance.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} <b>caliper</b> design uses a single {{hydraulically}} actuated piston within a cylinder, although high performance brakes use {{as many as}} twelve. Modern cars use different hydraulic circuits to actuate the brakes on each set of wheels as a safety measure. The hydraulic design also helps multiply braking force. The number of pistons in a <b>caliper</b> {{is often referred to}} as the number of 'pots', so if a vehicle has 'six pot' calipers it means that each <b>caliper</b> houses six pistons.|$|E
25|$|British {{calliper}} or caliper; American <b>caliper.</b>|$|E
50|$|The brakes have single <b>calipers</b> on {{the front}} and double <b>calipers</b> on the rear with carbon fiber rotors.|$|R
25|$|<b>Calipers</b> are {{hand tools}} {{designed}} to precisely measure {{the distance between}} two points. Most <b>calipers</b> have two sets of flat, parallel edges used for inner or outer diameter measurements. These <b>calipers</b> can be accurate to within one-thousandth of an inch (25.4 μm). Different types of <b>calipers</b> have different mechanisms for displaying the distance measured. Where larger objects need to be measured with less precision, a tape measure is often used.|$|R
50|$|Models with 3S-GE and 3S-GTE engines had twin-piston {{front brake}} <b>calipers.</b> Models with the 5S-FE engine had only single-piston <b>calipers.</b>|$|R
25|$|Instead {{of a pair}} of {{horizontal}} bolts that allow the <b>caliper</b> to move straight in and out respective to the car body, a swinging <b>caliper</b> utilizes a single, vertical pivot bolt located somewhere behind the axle centerline. When the driver presses the brakes, the brake piston pushes on the inside piston and rotates the whole <b>caliper</b> inward, when viewed from the top. Because the swinging caliper's piston angle changes relative to the disc, this design uses wedge-shaped pads that are narrower in the rear on the outside and narrower on the front on the inside.|$|E
25|$|Calipers are of two types, {{floating}} or fixed. A fixed <b>caliper</b> {{does not}} move relative to the disc and is thus less tolerant of disc imperfections. It uses one or more pairs of opposing pistons to clamp from {{each side of the}} disc, and is more complex and expensive than a floating <b>caliper.</b>|$|E
25|$|In some rear disc calipers, {{the parking}} brake {{activates}} a mechanism inside the <b>caliper</b> that performs {{some of the}} same function.|$|E

25|$|The brake <b>caliper</b> is the {{assembly}} which houses the brake pads and pistons. The pistons are usually made of plastic, aluminium or chrome-plated steel.|$|E
25|$|It {{seems likely}} that before 1775, Arnold's {{earliest}} pocket chronometers, such as those supplied to Phipps and Banks, were plain watches with centre seconds motion, largely resembling Maskelyne's cylinder watch by Ellicott. Certainly, those few surviving examples are of this <b>caliper</b> such as No. 3.|$|E
25|$|By 1772, Arnold had {{finalized}} {{the design}} of his pocket timekeepers and started series production with a standardized movement <b>caliper,</b> this being around 50mm in diameter, larger than a conventional watch of the period, and showing seconds with a pivoted detent escapement and spiral compensation curb. However, the latter appears to have proved ineffective, {{which seems to have}} substantially slowed the rate of production.|$|E
5000|$|The triceps skin fold is {{the width}} of a fold of skin taken over the triceps muscle. It is {{measured}} using skinfold <b>calipers.</b> (See body fat percentage#Skinfold methods for general information on skinfold fat measurements.) The measurement is taken at a standardized position (one of eight standard skinfold measurement points) at the midpoint {{of the back of the}} upper arm. [...] The skinfold <b>calipers</b> are spring-loaded. Holtain skinfold <b>calipers</b> are marked with 0.2 mm gradation, Lange <b>calipers</b> with 0.5 mm gradation.|$|R
5000|$|Brembo {{brake system}} with (355 mm) 14-inch rotors and six-piston <b>calipers</b> {{in front and}} (340 mm) 13.4 inch rotors and four-piston <b>calipers</b> in the rear ...|$|R
50|$|The car is {{fitted with}} 12.9 in brake discs with four-piston AP <b>calipers</b> {{at the front}} and 11.8 in discs with two-piston <b>calipers</b> at the rear.|$|R
25|$|Technical {{improvements}} in the chassis include Tokico radial brake calipers, allowing smaller discs and therefore lower unsprung weight, translating into superior handling. Increased front braking power necessitated a sturdier lower triple clamp. The rear brake <b>caliper</b> {{was moved to the}} top of the disc, giving a cleaner visual appearance. New 17inch wheels were designed, using Bridgestone BT-015 radials taken almost directly from the GSX-R1000.|$|E
25|$|Following the LFA's release at the Tokyo Motor Show, Lexus {{unveiled}} a website with a 'LFA configurator' which allowed users to select {{exterior and interior}} colors, brake <b>caliper</b> colors, seats, steering wheel leather, and other interior designs. In total, there were over 30billion possible configurations. Each LFA was hand-built by a dedicated production team of engineers and specialists at Toyota's Motomatchi plant in Aichi, Japan.|$|E
25|$|The {{braking system}} {{includes}} four-channel ABS, electronic brake distribution, and a creep aid system {{to prevent the}} car from rolling on a hill. A brake booster pressure monitoring system monitors vacuum when the engine is shut off during Idle Stop mode. Traction control and vehicle stability assist are also included. The front brakes are single-piston sliding <b>caliper</b> with a one-piece ventilated rotor. Drum brakes {{are used in the}} rear.|$|E
50|$|In 2002, {{the front}} brake <b>calipers</b> were changed to Brembo Monobloc 4 pad <b>calipers</b> - each piston having a {{separate}} pad gave {{an increase in}} braking performance and feel.|$|R
50|$|The car uses tire sizes 255/40ZR19 {{up front}} and 285/40ZR19 down the back. The car also uses brake <b>calipers</b> and carbon ceramic matrix (CCM) rotors that are {{ventilated}} and cross-drilled. Both the rotors and <b>calipers</b> are from Brembo. The rotors measure 15.5 in {{up front and}} 14 in down the rear. The <b>calipers</b> are six-piston up front and four-piston down rear.|$|R
5000|$|The 2015 BMW 228i Coupé Track Handling Package, which {{includes}} Adaptive M Suspension with 10mm lower height, Michelin Pilot Super Sport tires on unique 18 inch light alloy wheels, BMW Variable Sport Steering with mechanical steering rack, and M Sport Brakes (fixed four piston front <b>calipers,</b> two piston rear <b>calipers,</b> 13.4/13. 6 inch front/rear brake discs, dark blue <b>calipers</b> with M logo).|$|R
25|$|The Nimbus engines were {{produced}} in two main variants, the Mark 103/503 and the Mark 105/502. The Mark 103/503 is generally {{similar to the}} Mark 105/502 except that the former has a double-caliper disc brake incorporated in the output drive shaft to provide adequate braking of the helicopter's rotor in the high winds encountered over {{the deck of a}} fast moving ship, whereas the 105/502 has a single <b>caliper</b> unit.|$|E
25|$|The rotor {{is usually}} made of cast iron, but may {{in some cases}} be made of {{composites}} such as reinforced carbon–carbon or ceramic matrix composites. This {{is connected to the}} wheel and/or the axle. To retard the wheel, friction material in the form of brake pads, mounted on the brake <b>caliper,</b> is forced mechanically, hydraulically, pneumatically, or electromagnetically against both sides of the rotor. Friction causes the rotor and attached wheel to slow or stop.|$|E
25|$|This type of brake pre-dates the direct-pull brake. It is a centre-pull {{cantilever}} {{design with}} an outwardly angled arm protruding on each side, a cable {{stop on the}} frame or fork to terminate the cable housing, and a straddle cable between the arms similar to centre-pull <b>caliper</b> brakes. The cable from the brake lever pulls upwards on the straddle cable, causing the brake arms to rotate up and inward thus squeezing the rim between the brake pads.|$|E
50|$|Standard brakes are 390 mm (front) and 360 mm (rear) {{cast iron}} disc brakes with 6-piston {{aluminium}} (front) and 4-piston (rear) <b>calipers.</b> Optional on the SLS AMG are carbon-ceramic disc brakes. 402 mm discs with 6-piston aluminium <b>calipers</b> (front) and 360 mm discs with 4-piston <b>calipers</b> (rear). These brakes provide increased stopping power with a 40% weight reduction {{compared to the}} standard brake system.|$|R
5000|$|... 2006 Impreza WRX models {{gained some}} chassis and braking system enhancements. On sedan models, {{aluminum}} front suspension lower A-arms reduced unsprung weight. (The rear suspension gained forward aluminum lateral links in the 2005 model year.) The steering rack was updated for improved steering feel and the steering rack ratio {{was changed to}} 15.0:1. On all WRX models, 7-spoke 17 x 7 in aluminum-alloy wheels replaced the previous 5 spoke 16 x 6.5 in wheels. Tires were 215/45ZR17 versus 205/55R16 before. The more powerful brake system employed 11.5 in vented front discs and four-piston <b>calipers</b> instead of the previous versions two-piston <b>calipers.</b> The rear brakes were 11.3 in ventilated discs replacing the previous 10.3 in solid discs, and two-piston <b>calipers</b> replacing single-piston <b>calipers.</b> The <b>calipers</b> are painted red with the SUBARU name in white overlain.|$|R
50|$|Brakes {{were made}} by Alcon. Front discs were on {{aluminium}} bells and were 332 mm in diameter with 4 pot Alcon <b>calipers.</b> Rear discs were 266 mm in diameter with 2 pot Alcon <b>calipers.</b>|$|R
