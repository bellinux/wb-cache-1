5|$|The oldest {{confidently}} identified parasitic flatworm fossils are cestode eggs {{found in}} a Permian shark <b>coprolite,</b> but helminth hooks still attached to Devonian acanthodians and placoderms might also represent parasitic flatworms with simple life cycles. The oldest known free-living platyhelminth specimen is a fossil preserved in Eocene age Baltic amber {{and placed in the}} monotypic species Micropalaeosoma balticus, while the oldest subfossil specimens are schistosome eggs discovered in ancient Egyptian mummies. The Platyhelminthes have very few synapomorphies, distinguishing features that all Platyhelminthes and no other animals have. This makes it difficult to work out both their relationships with other groups of animals and the relationships between different groups that are described as members of the Platyhelminthes.|$|E

The identification of human and animal <b>coprolites,</b> through the study of the shape, size, charactheristics after rehydration, alimentary contents, and the presence of parasites, has proved to be accurate for human <b>coprolites.</b> For non-human ones we compared <b>coprolites</b> with recent faeces of animals collected near the archaeological sites, following the methodology above mentioned.

40|$|The most {{remarkable}} dietary remains recoverable from archaeological contexts are <b>coprolites.</b> <b>Coprolites</b> are desiccated or mineralized feces that are preserved in sheltered and open sites in arid regions, {{primarily in the}} New World. These dietary remains are remarkable from several perspectives. They typically contain a variety of macroscopic and microscopic remains that form interrelated data sets for the reconstruction of diets. Because contexts containing <b>coprolites</b> are typified by excellent preservation, the remains <b>coprolites</b> contain tend to be in better states of preservation than dietary remains recovered from nonfecal deposits. <b>Coprolites</b> also contain the well-preserved remains of intestinal parasites and pathogens which affected prehistoric health. Thus, <b>coprolites</b> provide excellent evidence of diet and disease for arid regions...|$|R
25|$|The {{recognition}} of <b>coprolites</b> is aided by their structural patterns, such as spiral or annular markings, by their content, such as undigested food fragments, and by associated fossil remains. The smallest <b>coprolites</b> are {{often difficult to}} distinguish from inorganic pellets or from eggs. Most <b>coprolites</b> are composed chiefly of calcium phosphate, along with minor quantities of organic matter. By analyzing <b>coprolites,</b> {{it is possible to}} infer the diet of the animal which produced them.|$|R
25|$|From 1976 to 1981, the York Archaeological Trust {{conducted}} a five-year excavation {{in and around}} the street of Coppergate in central York. This demonstrated that, in the 10th century, Jórvík's trading connections reached to the Byzantine Empire and beyond: a cap made of silk survives, and coins from Samarkand were familiar enough and respected enough for a counterfeit to have passed in trade. Both these items, as well as a large human <b>coprolite</b> known as the Lloyds Bank <b>coprolite,</b> were famously recovered in York a millennium later. Amber from the Baltic is often expected at a Viking site and at Jórvík an impractical and presumably symbolic axehead of amber was found. A cowrie shell indicates contact with the Red Sea or the Persian Gulf. Christian and pagan objects have survived side-by-side, usually taken as a sign that Christians were not in positions of authority.|$|E

25|$|The {{integration}} of plant cultivation in El Paraíso occurred slowly {{as there were}} plentiful sources of marine organisms. Due to the evidence of such high marine resources, agriculture mainly acted as an industrial resource. The earliest cultigens {{are found to be}} cotton (Gossypium barbadense) and bottle gourd (Lagenaria siceraria) which date back to 2500B.C. Other cultigens include squash (Cucurbita ficifolia, C. maxima, and C. moschata), chili pepper (Capiscum sp), the common bean (P. vulgaris), achira (Canne edulis) and jicama (Pachyrrhizus tuberosus). There are remnants of guava, Lucuma and pacae which insist on a varied diet as well as management over some crops that were not cultivated. An abundance of Solanum spp., found within <b>coprolite</b> remains indicates there were plants ranging from night shades to potatoes most likely being domesticated as well. Cotton is one of the highest found crops at the site. It was important as an industrial crop to build nets and lines for catching fish and other marine resources. It also doubled as a resource manufactured into textiles to make clothing.|$|E

25|$|<b>Coprolites</b> - fossilised {{droppings}} - give {{a useful}} insight of what animals ate, {{even if the}} animals cannot be identified. <b>Coprolites</b> found in the Rhynie chert are typically between 0.5 and 3mm in size, and contain a variety of contents. Analysis of <b>coprolites</b> allows the identification of different feeding modes, including detritovory and herbivory; some <b>coprolites</b> are so densely packed with spores {{that it is possible}} that these made up a substantial proportion of some organisms' diets.

40|$|AbstractEvidence for {{invertebrate}} {{feeding on}} glossopterid gymnosperms is documented from Middle Permian silicified peats of the Prince Charles Mountains, Antarctica, {{in the form}} of <b>coprolites</b> occurring both free in the peat matrix and clustered within excavations in roots, aerial wood and leaves. Observations of <b>coprolites</b> in thin-sections of the peats and from scanning electron microscopy of examples extracted via bulk maceration reveal nine morphotypes distinguished by size, shape, surface texture and contents. These include <b>coprolites</b> with coarse plant debris, spirally ornamented <b>coprolites,</b> <b>coprolites</b> containing spore/pollen remains and fern sporangia, <b>coprolites</b> within Glossopteris leaves, an ellipsoidal morphotype within a fern sporangium, large isolated <b>coprolites</b> between matted leaves, clustered forms filling galleries inside Vertebraria roots and Australoxylon wood, forms with coarse indeterminate constituents and others with fungal contents. Other faunal evidence is limited to indeterminate arthropod exoskeleton fragments. Collectively, the <b>coprolites</b> within the permineralised peat from the Prince Charles Mountains document the presence of diverse feeding behaviours including stem feeding, sporangial feeding, palynivory, root feeding and mycophagy. The first evidence of invertebrate feeding traces in Vertebraria (glossopterid) roots is identified. These findings indicate that herbivory by invertebrates in the high-latitude Permian forest-mire ecosystems of Antarctica was more intense and diverse than previous studies have reported, and affected all parts of the Glossopteris plant, together with components of associated herbaceous taxa...|$|R

2500|$|In 1842 the Rev John Stevens Henslow, a {{professor}} of Botany at St John's College, Cambridge, discovered coprolites just outside Felixstowe in Suffolk in the villages of Trimley St Martin, Falkenham and Kirton and investigated their composition.

[...] Very soon, coprolites were being mined on an industrial scale for use as fertiliser due to their high phosphate content. The major area of extraction occurred over the east of England, centred on Cambridgeshire and the Isle of Ely with its refining being carried out in Ipswich by the Fison Company. There is a <b>Coprolite</b> Street near Ipswich docks where the Fisons works once stood. The industry declined in the 1880s but was revived briefly during the First World War to provide phosphates for munitions.

2500|$|A <b>coprolite</b> is fossilized feces.

Prior to this they were known as [...] "fossil fir cones" [...] and [...] "bezoar stones". They serve a valuable purpose in paleontology because they provide direct evidence of the predation and diet of extinct organisms.

2500|$|Recent {{radiocarbon}} dating of Clovis sites has yielded ages of 11.1k to 10.7k 14C years BP (13k to 12.6k cal years BP), somewhat later than dates derived from older techniques.

Numerical dating of Clovis sites has allowed comparison of Clovis dates with dates of other archaeosites throughout the Americas, and of the opening of the ice-free corridor.
