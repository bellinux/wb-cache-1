Hiss's retrial for perjury after a July 1949 hung jury was a <b>cloud</b> <b>over</b> Nixon's campaign; if Hiss was acquitted, Nixon's candidacy would be in serious danger. On January 21, 1950, the jury found Hiss guilty, and Nixon received hundreds of congratulatory messages, including one from the only living former President, Herbert Hoover.|$|E
5|$|As the Dorniers passed Sheerness, the {{anti-aircraft}} defences opened fire {{to protect the}} naval yard at Chatham, Kent. Along the south bank of the Thames Estuary 15 gun positions fired six 4.5in of 3.7in heavy shells. The German bombers opened up a little, to spread out. The <b>cloud</b> <b>over</b> the target ruined the German bomb run, and some bombers began the return trip with their loads still on board. While crossing the coast over Deal, Kent, three attacked the Royal Marines barracks there. They continued back across the Channel, having made no contact with enemy fighters.|$|E

The aircraft which reached the Tokyo area struck airfields {{north of the city}} and caused little damage. While the naval base was not attacked, it was overflown by an American fighter and its defenders were readied to respond to attacks. On the night of 17–18July American and British warships bombarded the city of Hitachi.|$|E

5|$|Erprobungsgruppe 210 {{were sent}} further east for an {{operation}} to attack targets near Southend. They took off at 15:15 and were escorted by ZG 76. Unfortunately, they found unbroken <b>cloud</b> <b>over</b> Essex. No. 56 Squadron RAF intercepted, but Erprobungsgruppe 210 dropped their bombs over Canterbury. II./StG 1 {{was sent to}} bomb airfields near Rochester. It failed to find the target and returned without incident. IV./LG 1—also with Ju 87s—was sent after RAF Detling. JG 26 went out on a fighter sweep to clear the skies {{in advance of the}} attack. JG 26 lost one Bf 109 over Folkestone from an unknown cause. The Ju 87s bombed the station and 40 Bf 109s strafed it, killing the commander. The operations block was hit, causing high casualties. The losses were disastrous for No. 53 Squadron RAF, which lost a number of Blenheims on the ground. The commander killed was Group Captain E P Meggs-Davis. One Squadron Leader was killed—a J.H Lowe—and a further two were wounded. One of the wounded men was a First World War ace Robert J. O. Compston. The station's casualties amounted to 24 killed and 42 wounded. However, Detling was not an RAF Fighter Command station and the attack did not affect No. 11 Group RAF in any way.|$|E
5|$|Royal Air Force (RAF) heavy bombers {{conducted}} {{a series of}} unsuccessful raids on Tirpitz shortly after the battleship arrived in Norway from Germany in January 1942. Tirpitz was initially based at Fættenfjord near Trondheim, which lay within range of British bombers flying from Scotland. The first raid took place on 30 January, and involved nine Handley Page Halifax and seven Short Stirling bombers. Due to <b>cloud</b> <b>over</b> the target area, only one of the bombers sighted Tirpitz and none inflicted any damage. One Halifax crashed into the sea on its way back to Scotland, but its crew were rescued. The next raid on Fættenfjord took place on 30 March, with the attacking force comprising 33 Halifaxes. The operation was again frustrated by heavy clouds over the target area. Four of the Halifaxes were shot down, and two others crashed while returning to base. Another attack was mounted by 30 Halifaxes and 11 Avro Lancasters on the night of 27/28 April. Tirpitz was located and attacked by the aircraft of the first wave, but no damage was inflicted and five heavy bombers were lost. The final raid in this series took place the next night, and involved 21 Halifaxes and 12 Lancasters. The attackers found Tirpitz covered in a protective smokescreen, and the battleship again escaped damage; two British aircraft were destroyed.|$|E

The eggs are {{slightly}} lustrous, buffy white in colour and dotted with reddish-brown and grey blotches that often appear in a <b>cloud</b> <b>over</b> the larger end of the eggs. Black honeyeater nests are occasionally parasitised by Horsfield's bronze cuckoo (Chrysococcyx basalis). The female incubates alone, leaving the eggs exposed for short periods during the day to take insects on the wing.

500|$|Mistakenly {{assuming}} {{their ground}} speed to be {{faster than it}} really was, the crew may have deduced that they had already safely crossed the Andes, and so commenced their descent to Santiago, whereas in fact they were still a considerable distance to the east-north-east and were approaching the cloud-shrouded Tupungato Glacier at high speed. Some BSAA pilots, however, have expressed scepticism at this theory; convinced that Cook would not have started his descent without a positive indication that he had crossed the mountains, they have suggested that strong winds may have brought down the craft in some other way.

500|$|The Home Fleet {{initiated}} a further four raids against Tirpitz between April and July 1944, though the battleship was only attacked {{during the last}} of these operations. These attacks were hindered by the transfer {{of many of the}} Home Fleet's airmen to other units following Operation Tungsten, as the replacement aircrew were less experienced. The first raid (Operation Planet) began on 21 April but cancelled three days later when agents stationed near Kaafjord reported bad weather over the target area. The Home Fleet put to sea to attack Tirpitz again in mid-May in what was designated Operation Brawn. A strike force of 27 Barracudas escorted by Vought F4U Corsair and Supermarine Seafire fighters took off from the carriers [...] and Victorious on 15 May, but returned to the ships without attacking after they encountered heavy <b>cloud</b> <b>over</b> Kaafjord. The next raid, Operation Tiger Claw, was initiated in late May but cancelled due to bad weather on the 28th of the month. The subsequent attack (Operation Mascot) was timed for mid-July, before the resumption of the Arctic convoys, which had been suspended since April 1944 to free up ships for the Normandy landings. The strike force of 44 Barracudas and 40 fighters dispatched on 17 July reached the target area, but found Tirpitz cloaked in a protective smokescreen and the attack failed to inflict any damage on the battleship.|$|E
500|$|Three raids against Tirpitz were {{cancelled}} after launch due to unfavourable weather during April and May 1944. The {{first of}} these attacks, Operation Planet, began when the Home Fleet sailed from its base at Scapa Flow in the Orkney Islands on 21 April. This operation involved the same aircraft carriers as had taken part in Operation Tungsten, aside from the substitution of the escort carrier [...] with her sister ship [...] The fleet reached the position where its aircraft were to be flown off three days later, but the raid was cancelled when Allied agents near Kaafjord reported bad weather over the target area. The fleet then sailed south, and attacked a German convoy near Bodø, sinking three merchant ships {{for the loss of}} six aircraft. The Home Fleet put to sea to attack Tirpitz again in mid-May in what was designated Operation Brawn. A strike force of 27 Barracudas escorted by Vought F4U Corsair and Supermarine Seafire fighters took off from the carriers [...] and Victorious on the afternoon of 15 May, but encountered heavy <b>cloud</b> <b>over</b> Kaafjord and returned without attacking. The next raid, Operation Tiger Claw, was launched in late May. The planned attack on Kaafjord—which would have also involved aircraft flying from Furious and Victorious—had to be cancelled due to bad weather on 28 May. Instead, the carriers sailed south in search of German convoys. In a raid conducted on 1 June, the carriers' aircraft sank four merchant vessels near Ålesund. No further attacks were attempted during June as the ships of the Home Fleet were needed to support the Normandy landings that month.|$|E

500|$|Approaching the Floridian coast as an intensifying hurricane, {{the storm}} {{initially}} {{turned away from}} the peninsula {{for a short period of}} time on August7, after nearly making landfall on West Palm Beach. Strong gusts of at least 30mph (50km/h) and squally weather impacted the city, but did not cause any damage. However, telecommunications in the city were temporarily disrupted due to the storm. In Jupiter, stronger gusts reaching 60mph (100km/h) were reported, but did not cause any damage as well. However, the hurricane's recurvature offshore was short lived, and the system eventually made its landfall near Fort Pierce, Florida early on August8. Offshore, the USAHS Algonquin, a cruise ship belonging to the Clyde-Mallory cruise line, was caught in the storm, but managed to reach its destination of New York, New York without any major problems. The Honduran freighter Lempira, which had also recorded the lowest barometric pressure associated with the hurricane, experienced considerable damage due to the strong seas. The ship lost all of its lifeboats, and as a result the United Fruit Company line was sent to accompany the damaged ship. Inland, damage was concentrated in an area extending from Jupiter to the border between Florida and Georgia. The hurricane's landfall on the peninsula was attended by torrential rainfall, which damaged crops, particularly citrus. Rainfall peaked at [...] in St. <b>Cloud</b> <b>over</b> a five-day period from August7–12. There, the nearby East Lake Tohopekaliga began to overflow, threatening property and crops. Losses to the citrus crop were estimated by the Florida Citrus Exchange to be equivalent to 1millionboxes of citrus. However, damage to citrus in the Kissimmee area was comparatively less, and was limited to unripe fruit. Lake Okeechobee's water level rose by [...] as a result of floodwater rushing into the lake. Damage along the lake's shores mostly occurred to the north. To the south, in Clewiston, minor damage was confined to trees and windows. Two deaths occurred in the vicinity of the Indian River; these were the only deaths associated with the hurricane in the state. Numerous highways were also washed out by the rains, especially on Florida's south-central east coast. Portions of State Road 4 were covered in debris strewn by strong winds. Damage to the state's road systems was estimated at $100,000 by the former Florida State Highway Commission. Bridges were also badly damaged, with some needing replacement.|$|E
