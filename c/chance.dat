5|$|On May 27, NOAA {{issued its}} first outlook {{calling for a}} near-normal season with a 70% <b>chance</b> that 10–16 named storms could form, {{including}} 4–8 hurricanes of which 1–4 could reach major hurricane status. NOAA also stated {{that there is a}} 45% <b>chance</b> of a near-normal season, 30% <b>chance</b> of an above-normal season and 25% <b>chance</b> of a below-normal season. Also on May 27, TSR substantially increased their forecast numbers, predicting activity would be about 30% above the average with 17 named storms, 9 hurricanes, 4 major hurricanes and an ACE near 130. The reason for the increased activity forecast was the increased likelihood of La Niña forming during the season in addition to a trend towards a negative North Atlantic Oscillation, which generally favors a warmer tropical Atlantic. TSR predicted that there is a 57% <b>chance</b> that the 2016 Atlantic season would be above-normal, a 33% <b>chance</b> it would be near-normal, and only a 10% <b>chance</b> it would be below-normal.|$|E
