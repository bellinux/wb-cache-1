50|$|The {{composition}} of igneous rocks and minerals {{can be determined}} via {{a variety of methods}} of varying ease, cost, and complexity. The simplest method is observation of hand samples with the naked eye and/or with a hand lens. This can be used to gauge the general mineralogical {{composition of}} the rock, which gives an insight into the composition. A more precise but still relatively inexpensive way to identify minerals (and thereby the bulk chemical composition of the rock) with a petrographic microscope. These microscopes have polarizing plates, filters, and a conoscopic lens that allow the user to measure a large number of <b>crystallographic</b> <b>properties.</b> Another method for determining mineralogy is to use X-ray diffraction, in which a powdered sample is bombarded by X-rays, and the resultant spectrum of crystallographic orientations is compared to a set of standards. One of the most precise ways of determining chemical composition is by the use of an electron microprobe, in which tiny spots of materials are sampled. Electron microprobe analyses can detect both bulk composition and trace element composition.|$|E

50|$|Gibbsite is {{also known}} as hydrargillite, named after the Greek words for water (hydra) and clay (argylles). The first {{compound}} named hydrargillite was thought to be aluminium hydroxide, but was later found to be aluminium phosphate; despite this, both gibbsite and hydrargillite are used to refer to the same polymorphism of aluminium hydroxide, with gibbsite used most commonly in the United States and hydrargillite used more often in Europe. In 1930, it was referred to as α-alumina trihydrate to contrast it with bayerite, which was called β-alumina trihydrate (the alpha and beta designations were used to differentiate the more- and less-common forms respectively). In 1957, a symposium on alumina nomenclature attempted to develop a universal standard, resulting in gibbsite being designated γ-Al(OH)3, bayerite becoming α-Al(OH)3, and nordstrandite being designated Al(OH)3. Based on their <b>crystallographic</b> <b>properties,</b> a suggested nomenclature and designation is for gibbsite to be α-Al(OH)3, bayerite to be designated β-Al(OH)3, and both nordstrandite and doyleite are designated Al(OH)3. Under this designation, the α and β prefixes refer to hexagonal, close-packed structures and altered or dehydrated polymorphisms respectively, with no differentiation between nordstrandite and doyleite.|$|E

40|$|Calcium {{phosphate}} cements (CPCs) {{are significant}} alternatives to autologous bone grafting. CPCs can {{be composed of}} biphasic or multiphase calcium phosphate (CaP) compounds. A common way to process CPCs is by ball milling. Ball milling {{can be used for}} grinding or mechanosynthesis. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the effect of well-defined ball milling grinding parameters, applied via different milling pathways, on the properties of CPCs. Starting CaP compounds used included alpha-tricalcium phosphate, dicalcium phosphate anhydrous and precipitated hydroxyapatite. Scanning electron microscopy showed changes in the powder morphology, which were related to the behavior of the starting CaP materials. Specific surface area (SSA) and particle size (PS) measurements exposed the effect of ball milling on the CaP compounds and CPC powders. X-ray diffraction revealed no effect of ball milling pathways or milling time on the composition of CPCs or the starting materials, but affected their <b>crystallographic</b> <b>properties.</b> No contamination of the milling media or transformation into an amorphous calcium phosphate compound was found. The milling pathways affected setting and cohesion. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) revealed differences on the CPC v-PO(3) bands according to the interaction, created between the CaP compounds by the milling pathways. FTIR confirmed that the milling pathways changed the <b>crystallographic</b> <b>properties.</b> This study demonstrates that the pathways used for milling grinding modify the PS, SSA, and <b>crystallographic</b> <b>properties</b> of the powders, without affecting their composition.
