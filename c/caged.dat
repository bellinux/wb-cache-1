5|$|Educator Daniel Challener, in his 1997 book Stories of Resilience in Childhood, {{analyzed}} {{the events in}} <b>Caged</b> Bird to illustrate resiliency in children. Challener states that Angelou's book provides a useful framework for exploring the obstacles many children like Maya face and how a community helps these children succeed as Angelou did. Psychologist Chris Boyatzis has used <b>Caged</b> Bird to supplement scientific theory and research in the instruction of child development topics such as the development of self-concept and self-esteem, ego resilience, industry versus inferiority, effects of abuse, parenting styles, sibling and friendship relations, gender issues, cognitive development, puberty, and identity formation in adolescence. He has called the book a highly effective tool for providing real-life examples of these psychological concepts.|$|E
40|$|In {{posterior}} lumbar interbody fusion, <b>cage</b> migrations {{and lower}} fusion rates compared to autologous bone graft {{used in the}} anterior lumbar interbody fusion procedure are documented. Anatomical and biomechanical data {{have shown that the}} <b>cage</b> positioning and <b>cage</b> type seem to play an important role. Therefore, the aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the impact of <b>cage</b> positioning and <b>cage</b> type on <b>cage</b> migration and fusion. We created a grid system for the endplates to analyze different <b>cage</b> positions. To analyze the influence of the <b>cage</b> type, we compared “closed” box titanium <b>cages</b> with “open” box titanium <b>cages.</b> This study included 40 patients with 80 implanted <b>cages.</b> After pedicle screw fixation, 23 patients were treated with a “closed box” <b>cage</b> and 17 patients with an “open box” <b>cage.</b> The follow-up period averaged 25  months. Twenty <b>cages</b> (25 %) showed a migration into one vertebral endplate of < 3  mm and four <b>cages</b> (5 %) showed a migration of ≥ 3  mm. <b>Cage</b> migration was highest in the medio-medial position (84. 6 %), followed by the postero-lateral (42. 9 %), and the postero-medial (16 %) <b>cage</b> position. Closed box <b>cages</b> had a significantly higher migration rate than open box <b>cages,</b> but fusion rates did not differ. In conclusion, <b>cage</b> positioning and <b>cage</b> type influence <b>cage</b> migration. The medio-medial <b>cage</b> position showed the highest migration rate. Regarding the <b>cage</b> type, open box <b>cages</b> seem to be associated with lower migration rates compared to closed box <b>cages.</b> However, the <b>cage</b> type did not influence bone fusion...|$|R

40|$|Integrated {{aquaculture}} systems simultaneously culture multiple {{species to}} reduce waste outputs by increasing trophic efficiency and nutrient retention. Using a phosphorus (P) mass balance model, this study assessed {{the efficacy of}} an integrated aquaculture system that used herbivorous fish to reduce waste loading into a freshwater reservoir in Guizhou Province, China. Six modified <b>cages</b> featured {{the addition of a}} 1 m wide outer <b>cage</b> surrounding a 10 m square inner <b>cage</b> stocked with intensively fed channel catfish (Ictalarus punctatus). Outer <b>cages</b> were stocked with filter-feeding herbivorous fish including, bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis), common carp (Cyprinus carpio), and Nile tilapia (Oreochromis nilocticus). These species fed on phytoplankton, particulate waste from the inner <b>cage,</b> and periphyton, thereby retaining nutrients and possibly improving water quality around the <b>cages.</b> This experiment compared phosphorus balances of modified <b>cages</b> with three traditional <b>cages</b> also stocked with channel catfish, but which did not include an outer <b>cage.</b> Additional experiments compared growth rates of fish in outer <b>cages</b> to fish in a control <b>cage</b> distant from any impacts of intensively fed inner <b>cages.</b> Water samples were also taken to measure total phosphorus concentrations inside the <b>cages,</b> 1 m outside <b>cages,</b> and at reference sites 500 - 1000 m away from <b>cages.</b> Outer <b>cage</b> fish retained 0. 08 - 0. 1 kg P ton- 1 harvested fish or 0. 05) between modified <b>cages,</b> traditional <b>cages,</b> and reference sites. Even though I concluded that outer <b>cage</b> fish retained nutrients from inner <b>cages,</b> retention was not substantial enough to improve water quality around modified <b>cages.</b> However, since phosphorus loading from <b>cages</b> had no impact on reservoir water quality, this suggests that phosphorus inputs from aquaculture are rapidly diluted and dispersed in the reservoir...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper digs {{into the}} {{relationship}} between grasps and <b>cages</b> of a rigid body, in particular into the use of <b>cages</b> as waypoints to grasp an object. We introduce the concept of pregrasping <b>cages,</b> <b>caging</b> configurations from which the object can be reached while maintaining the <b>cage</b> on it. In the well understood case of two-fingered manipulators, the squeezing/stretching <b>caging</b> characterization implies that all <b>cages</b> are indeed pregrasping <b>cages</b> and, as a consequence, are useful waypoints to grasp an object. We show in this paper that the same does not hold {{for more than two}} fingers. There are <b>caging</b> configurations from which a grasp of the object cannot be reached without breaking the <b>cage</b> on it. We explore the natural generalization of the squeezing/stretching characterization to the case of n fingers and exploit it to give sufficient conditions for a <b>cage</b> to be a pregrasping <b>cage...</b>|$|R
5|$|Initially {{popular as}} a <b>caged</b> {{bird in the}} 19th century, the {{turquoise}} parrot was rarely seen in captivity between 1928 and 1956, the main problem being {{the high rate of}} infertile eggs. It has become more common since, and has adapted readily to aviculture. A quiet species, it likes to bathe in captivity. There is a possibility of interbreeding {{with other members of the}} genus Neophema if <b>caged</b> together. Specimens with more prominent orange bellies have been bred, sourced from wild birds in New South Wales and not from breeding with scarlet-chested parrots. A yellow form, where the blue pigment is lost and yellow and red pigments are conserved, first appeared in the 1950s in aviculture. It is a recessive mutation. Other colour forms seen are a red-fronted and pied form (both recessive), and jade and olive (dominant).|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} it was aimed to {{determine}} the effects of hen age, <b>cage</b> position and <b>cage</b> density on egg production and quality characteristics in laying hens. One thousand and thirty six 25 wk old Isa Brown layers, at the beginning of laying period, were used in experiment. Two <b>cage</b> bateries which were parallel to the long axis were selected as the study material. <b>Cage</b> densities were four, and five birds per <b>cage,</b> respectively. Different egg production and egg quality parameters were measured for different hen age, <b>cage</b> position and densities for 11 weeks. Egg samples were collected from the <b>cages</b> to define the egg quality characteristics once a week. Indoor environmental conditions such as temperature and humidity were fairly affected by <b>cage</b> density (P< 0. 01). However, they did not differ among <b>cage</b> positions. Hen age had a significant effect on hen-day egg production (HDEP), feed consumption (FCS), feed conversion (FCV), and egg quality characteristics (P< 0. 01). The weekly observations showed that <b>cage</b> position and <b>cage</b> density did not have major influence on HDEP, FCS and FCV. On the other hand, HDEP and FCS were higher for four birds per <b>cage</b> on the window side. No egg quality characteristics were impacted by <b>cage</b> position and <b>cage</b> density. Differences between hen age for mortality were significant (P< 0. 01). Even though the <b>cage</b> position effect on mortality was not significant, the highest mortality was observed on corridor side.

40|$|ABSTRACT The battery <b>cage</b> {{system is}} being {{banned in the}} European Union before or by 2012, and the fur-nished <b>cage</b> system {{will be the only}} <b>cage</b> system allowed after 2012. This study was {{conducted}} to examine the different effects of <b>caging</b> systems, furnished <b>cages</b> vs. battery <b>cages,</b> on bird behaviors. One hundred ninety-two 1 -d-old non-beak-trimmed Hy-Line W- 36 White Leghorn chicks were reared using standard management practices in raised wire <b>cages.</b> At 19 wk of age, the birds were randomly assigned into battery <b>cages</b> or furnished <b>cages.</b> The battery <b>cages</b> were commercial wire <b>cages</b> containing 6 birds per <b>cage,</b> providing 645 cm 2 of floor space per birds. The furnished <b>cages</b> had wire floors and solid metal walls, with perches, a dustbathing area, scratch pads, and a nestbox area with a concealment curtain. Based on the company recommendations, 10 birds were housed per <b>cage,</b> providing a stocking den-sity of 610 cm 2 of floor space per bird. Behavioral ob-servations were conducted using the Noldus Observer software package. The birds were observed at 5 -min intervals for the entire light period. The birds housed in battery <b>cages</b> had higher posture and behavioral transi-tions and increased time spent walking and perform-ing exploratory behavior (P < 0. 05, 0. 01, respective-ly), which may indicate they were stressed, resulting in restlessness, whereas the birds housed in furnished <b>cages</b> had higher levels of preening (P < 0. 05). Preen-ing has been considered as a comfort behavior in birds. These results may suggest that furnished <b>cages</b> may be a favorable alternative system for housing birds by al-lowing them to perform certain natural behaviors.

40|$|In the European Union, {{conventional}} <b>cages</b> for {{laying hens}} will be faded {{out at the}} beginning of 2012. The rationale behind this is a public concern over animal welfare in egg production. As alternatives to conventional <b>cages,</b> the European Union Council Directive 1999 / 74 / EC allows non-cage systems and enriched (furnished) <b>cages.</b> Layer performance, behavior, and welfare in differently sized furnished <b>cages</b> have been investigated quite widely during recent decades, but nutrition of hens in this production system has received less attention. This thesis aims to compare production and feed intake of laying hens in furnished and conventional <b>cages</b> and to study the effects of different dietary treatments in these production systems, thus contributing to the general knowledge of furnished <b>cages</b> as an egg production system. A furnished <b>cage</b> model for 8 hens was compared with a 3 -hen conventional <b>cage.</b> Three consecutive experiments each studied one aspect of layer diet: The first experiment investigated the effects of dietary protein/energy ratio, the second dietary energy levels, and the third the effects of extra limestone supplementation. In addition, a fourth experiment evaluated the effects of perches on feed consumption and behavior of hens in furnished <b>cages.</b> The dietary treatments in experiments 1 – 3 generally had similar effects in the two <b>cage</b> types. Thus, there was no evidence supporting a change in nutrient requirements for laying hens when conventional <b>cages</b> are replaced with small-group furnished <b>cages.</b> Moreover, the results from nutritional experiments conducted in conventional <b>cages</b> can be applied to smallgroup furnished <b>cage</b> systems. These results support the view that production performance comparable with conventional <b>cages</b> can be achieved in furnished <b>cages.</b> All of the advantages of <b>cages</b> for bird welfare are sustained in the smallgroup furnished <b>cages</b> used here. In addition, frequent use of perches and nests implies a wider behavioral repertoire in furnished <b>cages</b> than in conventional <b>cages.</b> The increase observed in bone ash content may improve bird welfare in furnished <b>cages.</b> The presence of perches diminished feed consumption during the prelaying period and enhanced the feed conversion ratio during the early laying period in furnished <b>cages.</b> However, as {{the presence or absence of}} perches in furnished <b>cages</b> had no significant effect on feed consumption after the prelaying period, the lower feed consumption observed in furnished <b>cages</b> than in conventional <b>cages</b> could be attributed to other factors, such as the presence of wood shavings or a nest box. The wider feed trough space per hen in conventional than in furnished <b>cages</b> may partly explain the higher feed consumption observed in conventional <b>cages.</b> ...|$|R
