50|$|Little is {{currently}} {{known about the}} biology of the African giant toad. Breeding probably {{takes place in the}} dry season, January to March. Clutches of eggs are laid in streams in areas of relatively calm water, the female probably depositing long strings of eggs wrapped around underwater vegetation. Juveniles have been seen in January in Nigeria, in March in <b>Cameroon,</b> and young <b>toads</b> less than 40 mm long have been observed in February and the months between May and October {{in other parts of the}} range. Prey is likely to consist of invertebrates caught by the toad amongst the leaf-litter or in the water. This toad is known to consume ants and in captivity has eaten snails, insects, other frogs and tadpoles.|$|R
