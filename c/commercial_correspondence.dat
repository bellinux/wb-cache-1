40|$|This work {{originated}} in my professional worries concerning the highly polished and artificial language utilized {{in the written}} communication of the corporations, mainly, in those I have worked for. I was always {{in search of an}} answer for my questioning in normal working and conflicting situations, in which the correspondence presented an exaggerated, courteous and artificial treatment. Aiming at circumscribing such language we have analyzed these aspects in Manuals of Commercial Letters produced in Brazil – in the São Paulo/Rio de Janeiro regions –in 1950 through 2000 period (one of each decade). We considered the elected theme Study of Manuals of <b>Commercial</b> <b>Correspondences</b> (1950 - 2000) : An interpretation in light of the Linguistic Historiography appropriate {{for the purpose of this}} research at doctorate degree, in view of its originality. We have elected the general objective, as our starting point: to verify up to what extent the Manuals of <b>Commercial</b> <b>correspondences</b> have influenced the professionals and contributed for the elaboration of specific texts within the corporate context, in the period of 1950 - 2000. We have concluded that the analyzed Manuals reproduced the standard-norm of the Portuguese Language, were quite useful for a countless number of professionals belonging to the most different segments of the society, in spite of the lack of methodological procedures and consistent explanations about the introduction of the model, as well as of the bibliography to provide support and transparency to the works. </p...|$|R

6000|$|Such {{measures}} as {{these will be}} worth reams of essays in educational papers and Parents' Reviews, worth thousands of inspiring and suggestive lectures at pedagogic conferences. If, indeed, such essays and such lectures do any good at all. The more one looks into scholastic affairs the more one is struck {{not only by the}} futility but the positive mischievousness of much of what passes for educational liberalism. The schoolmaster is criticised vehemently for teaching the one or two poor useless subjects he can in a sort of way teach, and practically nothing is done to help or equip him to teach anything else. By reason of this uproar, the world is full now of anxious muddled parents, their poor brains buzzing with echoes of Froebel, Tolstoy, Herbert Spencer, Ruskin, Herbart, Colonel Parker, Mr. Harris, Matthew Arnold, and the Morning Post, trying to find something better. They know nothing of what is right, they only know very, very clearly that the ordinary school is extremely wrong. They are quite clear they don't want [...] "cram" [...] (though they haven't the remotest idea what cram is), and they have a pretty general persuasion that failure at examination is a good test of a sound education. And in response to their bleating demand there grows a fine crop of Quack Schools; schools organized on lines of fantastic extravagance, in which bee-keeping takes the place of Latin, and gardening supersedes mathematics, in which boys play tennis naked to be cured of False Shame, and the numerical exercises called bookkeeping and <b>commercial</b> <b>correspondence</b> are taught to the sons of parents (who can pay a hundred guineas a year), as Commercial Science. The subjects of study in these schools come and go like the ravings of a disordered mind; [...] "Greek History" [...] (in an hour or so a week for a term) is followed by [...] "Italian Literature," [...] and this gives place to the production of a Shakesperian play that ultimately overpowers and disorganizes the whole curriculum. Ethical lessons and the school pulpit flourish, of course. A triennial walk to a chalk-pit is Field Geology, and vague half-holiday wanderings are Botany Rambles. [...] "Art" [...] of the copper punching variety replaces any decent attempt to draw, and an extreme expressiveness in music compensates for an almost deliberate slovenliness of technique. Even the ladies' seminaries of the Georgian days could scarcely have produced a parallel to the miscellaneous incapacity of the victim of these [...] "modern" [...] schools, and it becomes daily more necessary for those who have the interests of education at heart to disavow with the most unmistakable emphasis these catch-parent impostures.|$|E

3000|$|Assessing [...] the {{ecological}} status of rivers, creeks, and streams {{is a fundamental}} and increasingly important water management issue worldwide. This study examines the variations in fish community structure along an increasing pollution gradient in a small Niger Delta creek in Nigeria in both time and space. Salinity of the area fluctuated between fresh and mesohaline brackish waters with values ranging from 0.4 to 5.2 PPT and electrical conductivity values ranging between 16.9 and 136.0  µS/cm. The site in the upper creek (Site 1) was relatively free from gross pollution, with significantly high dissolved oxygen levels and low nutrient and salinity levels. Site 3 recorded relatively higher values of 5 -day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD 5) and high nutrient levels, indicating substantial input of organic matter to the creek upstream. Six (6) species, Tilapia guineensis (Cichlidae), Bostrychus africanus (Eleotridae), Hemichromis fasciatus (Cichlidae), Ethmalosa fimbriata (Clupeidae), Gerres melanopterus (Gerreidae), and Clarias macromystax dominated the sample and accounted for about 70  % of the total catch. Tilapia guineensis constituted the major dominant species and accounted numerically for about 20  % of the total catches and 45  % of the total biomass. Multi-species fisheries dominate the coastal zone with Tilapia guineensis, Gerres melanopterus and Ethmalosa fimbriata, Liza falcipinus, Mugil spp., and Chrysichthys nigrodigitatus, the major species in the <b>commercial</b> catches. Canonical <b>correspondence</b> analysis indicated that dissolved oxygen, electrical conductivity, total nitrogen, BOD 5, and temperature were important variables structuring the overall fish assemblages. Overall, salinity was the major environmental variable determining the diversity of fish communities at the various sites. The effect of anthropogenic activities and land use practices around the creek only marginally affected the abundance of the fish species but not the diversity. These findings indicate that the water body is still useful as a good fishing ground for the rural communities and every effort should {{be put in place}} to ensure its protection and conservation for the production of healthy fish.|$|R

40|$|Since {{the first}} kidney {{transplant}} was performed over fifty years ago, it has offered {{the chance of}} life and the freedom from dialysis for thousands of people. However, demand for organs has always exceeded supply. The gap between the two is widening due to increased prevalence of diseases common to a ‘western’ lifestyle such as diabetes and hypertension, leading to more chronic kidney disease and renal failure. Renal transplants differ from most other transplants because living people are able to donate without significant adverse effects on their own health. Donated kidneys, therefore, have a potential to become a commercial asset. They can be harvested from cadavers or from living human donors. Living Related Donation (LRD) has become the organ source of choice and most common method. Supply, however, is still greatly inferior to demand: the United States Department of Health and Human Services 2006 Annual Report recorded over 82, 000 patients on the waiting list for a kidney, up nearly 7 % from the previous year (1). In order to resolve the shortage of donors, some have advocated financial payments being made to donors. Despite being illegal in most countries, the trade appears to be booming in nations such as Turkey, Russia, and South Africa (2). Just as waiting lists and costs motivate some people to travel outside of their country of residence for procedures such as hip replacements and cosmetic surgery- a phenomenon called ‘health tourism’, a similar phenomenon appears to be occurring on a smaller scale for organ transplants (3). The dilemma physicians and health officials are faced with is whether to close their eyes to this trade, disregarding ethical implications and the adverse effects of surgeries done on the black market, or to legalize it and try to establish boundaries to protect organ donors that receive compensation. Currently, the World Health Organisation estimates that of the 660, 000 {{people in the world who}} require any form of transplant, 10 % receive one each year (4).

50|$|In 1885 Gunton {{began an}} annual lecture {{series in the}} church of Rev. Herber Newton in New York City, which he {{continued}} for six years. This series led {{to the opening of}} the Institute of Social Economics, which opened in 1891 at 126 East Twenty-Third Street in New York. The institute was established not as a classical university, but as a venue to spread Gunton's specific message and with the goal of training the general public in becoming wholesome, rational citizens who understand politics, the economy and the responsibilities of being a citizen. It began as a night school and Gunton himself gave a free lecture every Wednesday evening. Soon the Institute expanded to a day school as well, which offered a one-year course. Subjects included accounting, penmanship, arithmetic, rhetoric, business <b>correspondence,</b> <b>commercial</b> law, social economics, English and American literature, civil government and principles of economics and practical statesmanship. Tuition was one hundred and fifty dollars for the year and admission was open to both sexes. By 1882 the Institute had to move to 34 Union Square, a 6-story building that could accommodate the rapidly growing student body. It added a High school in 1894 and began offering classical studies as well, such as languages and law. The popular free Wednesday lectures continued, now with many guest speakers in addition to Gunton. In 1897 the Institute moved yet again to a ten story building at 41 Union Square. At this time it was changed to the Gunton Institute and its vision changed greatly, now with the aim of educating the citizenry of all the United States. It became primarily a correspondence school. The home study plan offered a two-year curriculum, each year independent of the other. Gunton's weekly lecture was printed and mailed to students who had to complete required reading, including Gunton's Magazine, correspond with teachers regarding any questions, and complete a written theses {{at the end of each}} year. By October 1900, the lectures began to be printed monthly instead of weekly, then semi-monthly, then irregular, until the last was published in December 1903. The list of men associated with the Institute included the following: Thomas B. Reed; Dr. Charles DeGarmo, president of Swathmore; Theodore Roosevelt; Dr. Edwin R. A. Seligman; Carroll D Wright, U.S. Commissioner of Labor; Henry Cabot Lodge; David Starr Jordan, president of Leland Stanford jr. University; G.

40|$|The {{presence}} of English diplomats {{at the court}} of archduke Albert and the infanta Isabella {{during the reign of}} king James VI/I was due to the Treaty of London (1604). William Trumbull arrived as senior secretary to Sir Thomas Edmondes, who had been appointed resident ambassador in Brussels, in May 1605 and remained behind as chargé d'affaires in the fall of 1609 when Edmondes was recalled. Soon he was appointed resident agent at the court. His tenure in Brussels was exceptionally long. Trumbull represented the English king until the fall of 1625. Jacobean diplomacy has often been neglected in historiography. The relations between the Southern Low Countries and England have often been limited to its religious dimensions. Trumbull's career and especially his correspondence saved in the National Archives (State Papers Flanders) and the British Library (the Trumbull papers) show that relations between both courts were not limited to discussions about British and Irish Catholics seeking refuge in the Catholic Low Countries. After outlining Trumbull's career as a diplomat the dissertations turns to all possible themes that figure in the diplomatic <b>correspondence.</b> <b>Commercial</b> interests, the British and Irish regiments serving the archdukes, books and pamphlets, international affairs were points of interest besides the Catholic exile community.

5000|$|The Hittites, who {{established}} an extensive empire in the Middle East in the 2nd millennium BCE, {{are by far}} the best known members of the Anatolian group. The history of the Hittite civilization is known mostly from cuneiform texts found in the area of their kingdom, and from diplomatic and <b>commercial</b> <b>correspondence</b> found in various archives in Egypt and the Middle East. Despite the use of Hatti for their core territory, the Hittites should be distinguished from the Hattians, an earlier people who inhabited the same region (until the beginning of the 2nd millennium). The Hittite military made successful use of chariots. Although belonging to the Bronze Age, they were the forerunners of the Iron Age, developing the manufacture of iron artifacts from as early as the 14th century, when letters to foreign rulers reveal the latter's demand for iron goods. The Hittite empire reached its height during the mid-14th century under Suppiluliuma I, when it encompassed an area that included most of Asia Minor as well as parts of the northern Levant and Upper Mesopotamia. After 1180 BCE, amid the Bronze Age Collapse in the Levant associated with the sudden arrival of the Sea Peoples, the kingdom disintegrated into several independent [...] "Neo-Hittite" [...] city-states, some of which survived until as late as the 8th century BCE. The lands of the Anatolian peoples were successively invaded by a number of peoples and empires at high frequency: the Phrygians, Bithynians, the Medes, the Persians, the Greeks, the Galatian Celts, Romans and the Oghuz Turks. Many of these invaders settled in Anatolia, in some cases causing the extinction of the Anatolian languages. By the Middle Ages, all the Anatolian languages (and the cultures accompanying them) were extinct, although there may be lingering influences on the modern inhabitants of Anatolia, most notably Armenians.|$|E
