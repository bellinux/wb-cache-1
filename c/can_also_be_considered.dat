5|$|The {{basic concept}} of Gibanica, a cake or pie {{involving}} {{a combination of}} pastry with cheese in differentiated layers often combined with layers of various other fillings, is common in the cuisines of the Balkans, Anatolia, and the Eastern Mediterranean. For example, a similar dish known as Shabiyat (Sh'abiyat, Shaabiyat) {{is part of the}} cuisine of Syria and Lebanon. Gibanica <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> to resemble a type of cheese strudel, with which it likely shares a common ancestry in the pastry dishes of the region, and the cuisines of the Byzantine and Ottoman empires.|$|E

In the United States, the P90 is in use with over 200 law enforcement agencies, including the U.S. Secret Service. While developed and initially marketed as a PDW, it <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> a submachine gun or compact assault rifle. The standard selective fire P90 is restricted to military and law enforcement customers, but since 2005, a semi-automatic version has been offered to civilian shooters as the PS90.|$|E

40|$|During the {{production}} of hydrogen {{a number of other}} elements <b>are</b> <b>also</b> produced, removing these elements is crucial for {{the production}} of pure hydrogen. Due to their potentially infinite hydrogen selectivity, dense-metal membranes are a very promising method for separating hydrogen; currently the metallic membranes commonly used are based on Pd-Ag alloys. Although palladium possesses a very active surface for hydrogen absorption and desorption, other metals such as the transition metals (e. g vanadium (V), tantalum (Ta) and niobium (Nb)) exhibit greater hydrogen permeability. In addition, these metals are much less costly than palladium, therefore offering considerable improvements in performance at lower cost. Besides being used as the core material for membrane vanadium <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>consider</b> as a candidate for use as an interdiffusion barrier in palladium supported membranes. ...|$|R

50|$|Primary {{stress is}} “marked {{when it is}} non-initial stress”. In addition, “when a pronoun is suffixed by, for {{instance}} a postposition, the pronoun does take primary - and initial - stress.” An example is nɨvía nɨ-pia, which means my mother (my-mother). In the following data where primary stress appears it will be shown as an “acute accent.” Primary stress is found in words or compounds of three, six and five syllables. However, when primary stress is marked in a third syllable it <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>consider</b> as a secondary stress according to Canonge’s but an “exception to this case is when both a proclitic and prefix are used.” An example of a third syllable stress is há.bi+hu.píi.tu which means 'stopped and lay down'. Words with “five syllables have primary stress on the first syllable.” An example is ká.wo+nò.ka.tu which means ‘stress’. Also, words with six syllables have primary stress on the first syllable. An example is kú.ʔi.na.kù.ʔe.tu which means ‘rosts for’.|$|R
