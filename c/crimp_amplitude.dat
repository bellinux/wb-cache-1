This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the evaluation of the parameters of plain weave textile from Kevlar 49 fibers. They were determined following the basic parameters of the textiles e. g. crimp length, <b>crimp</b> <b>amplitude,</b> thickness of the woven fabric, dimensions of the cross-sectional tow (tow width, tow height) and crimp angle. The number of fibers in the warp and tow strands was also determined. The work is also concerned with the analysis of microcracks in the material, that is, microcracks that appeared after the tensile test. Microscopic observation of cracks occurred on the test specimen strip according to DIN EN ISO 14129 for tensile testing. Strips of the material were cut,the metallurgical methods used being kept perpendicular to the thickness of the test specimen. Microcracks occurred in the individual planes located in the chosen reference axis. Microcracks were detected in the entire width of the specimen. The types of microcracks were determined by the length and traits of the microcracks...|$|E
40|$|Woven {{fabric is}} an {{increasingly}} important component of many defense and commercial systems, including deployable structures, restraint systems, numerous forms of protective armor, {{and a variety of}} structural applications where it serves as the reinforcement phase of composite materials. With the prevalence of these systems and the desire to explore new applications, acomprehensive, computationally efficient model for the deformation of woven fabrics is needed. However, modeling woven fabrics is difficult due, inparticular, to the need to simulate the response both at the scale of the entire fabric and at the meso-level, the scale of the yarns that compose the weave. Here, we present finite elements for the simulation of the three- dimensional, high-rated eformation of woven fabric. We employ a continuum- level modeling technique that, through the use of an appropriate unit cell, captures the evolution of the mesostructure of the fabric without explicitly modeling every yarn. Displacement degrees of freedom and degrees of freedom representing the change in <b>crimp</b> <b>amplitude</b> of each yarn family fully determine the deformed geometry of the mesostructure of the fabric, which in turn provides, through the constitutive relations, the internal nodal forces. In order to verify the accuracy of the elements, instrumented ballistic impact experiments with projectile velocities of 22 – 550 m/s were conducted on single layers of Kevlar ® fabric. Simulations of the experiments demonstrate that the finite elements are capable of efficiently simulating large, complex structures...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this study, we {{evaluated}} {{the hypothesis that}} the constituent fibers follow an affine deformation kinematic model for planar collagenous tissues. Results from two experimental datasets were utilized, taken at two scales (nanometer and micrometer), using mitral valve anterior leaflet (MVAL) tissues as the representative tissue. We simulated MVAL collagen fiber network as an ensemble of undulated fibers under a generalized two-dimensional deformation state, by representing the collagen fibrils based on a planar sinusoidally shaped geometric model. The proposed approach accounted for collagen fibril <b>amplitude,</b> <b>crimp</b> period, and rotation with applied macroscopic tissue-level deformation. When compared to the small angle x-ray scattering measurements, the model fit the data well, with an r 2  = 0. 976. This important finding suggests that, at the homogenized tissue-level scale of ∼ 1  mm, the collagen fiber network in the MVAL deforms according to an affine kinematics model. Moreover, with respect to understanding its function, affine kinematics suggests that the constituent fibers are largely noninteracting and deform in accordance with the bulk tissue. It also suggests that the collagen fibrils are tightly bounded and deform as a single fiber-level unit. This greatly simplifies the modeling efforts at the tissue and organ levels, because affine kinematics allows a straightforward connection between the macroscopic and local fiber strains. It also suggests that the collagen and elastin fiber networks act independently of each other, with the collagen and elastin forming long fiber networks that allow for free rotations. Such freedom of rotation can greatly facilitate the observed high degree of mechanical anisotropy in the MVAL and other heart valves, which is essential to heart valve function. These apparently novel findings support modeling efforts directed toward improving our fundamental understanding of tissue biomechanics in healthy and diseased conditions...|$|R
