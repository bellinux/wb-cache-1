40|$|The first {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to test the ability of systems of weighing and classifying bovine carcasses used in commercial abattoirs in Ireland to provide information that can be used for the purposes of genetic evaluation of carcass weight, carcass fatness class, and carcass <b>conformation</b> <b>class.</b> Secondly, the study aimed to test whether genetic and phenotypic variances differed by breed of sire. Variance components for carcass traits were estimated for crosses between dairy cows and 8 breeds of sire commonly found in the Irish cattle population. These 8 breeds were Aberdeen Angus, Belgian Blue, Charolais, Friesian, Hereford, Holstein, Limousin, and Simmental. A multivariate animal model was used to estimate genetic parameters within the Holstein sire breed group. Univariate analyses were used to estimate variance components for the remaining 7 sire breed groups. Multivariate sire models were used to formally test differences in genetic variances in sire breed groups. Field data on 64, 443 animals, which were slaughtered in commercial abattoirs between the ages of 300 and 875 d, were analyzed in 8 analyses. Carcass fat class and carcass <b>conformation</b> <b>class</b> were measured using the European Union beef carcass classification system (EUROP) scale. For all 3 traits, the sire breed group with the greatest genetic variance had a value of more than 8 times the sire breed group with least genetic variance. Heritabilities ranged from zero to moderate for carcass fatness class (0. 00 to 0. 40), from low to moderate for carcass <b>conformation</b> <b>class</b> (0. 04 to 0. 36), and from low to high for carcass weight (0. 06 to 0. 65). Carcass weight was the most heritable (0. 26) of the 3 traits. Carcass <b>conformation</b> <b>class</b> and carcass fatness class were equally heritable (0. 17). Genetic and phenotypic correlations were all positive in the Holstein sire breed group. The genetic correlations varied from 0. 11 for the relationship between carcass weight and carcass fatness class to 0. 44 for the relationship between carcass <b>conformation</b> <b>class</b> and carcass fatness class. Carcass weight and classification data collected in Irish abattoirs are useful for the purposes of genetic evaluation for beef traits of Irish cattle. There were significantly different variance components across the sire breed groups...|$|E

40|$|Crossbreeding of Holstein–Friesian {{dairy cows}} with both early {{maturing}} (e. g. Aberdeen Angus (AA)) and late maturing (e. g. Belgian Blue (BB)) beef breeds is commonly practised. In Ireland, genetic merit for {{growth rate of}} beef sires is expressed as expected progeny difference for carcass weight (EPDCWT). The objective {{of this study was}} to compare the progeny of Holstein–Friesian cows, sired by AA and BB bulls of low (L) and high (H) EPDCWT for performance and carcass traits. A total of 118 spring-born male progeny from 20 (9 AA and 11 BB) sires (8 L and 12 H) were managed together from shortly after birth to about 19 months of age. They were then assigned to one of two mean slaughter weights (560 kg (light) or 620 kg (heavy)). Following slaughter, carcasses were graded for <b>conformation</b> <b>class</b> and fat class, the 6 th to 10 th ribs joint was dissected as an indicator of carcass composition, and samples of subcutaneous fat and musculus longissimus were subjected to Hunterlab colour measurements. A sample of m. longissimus was also chemically analysed. Slaughter and carcass weights per day of age for AAL, AAH, BBL and BBH were 747, 789, 790 and 805 (s. e. 10. 5) g, and 385, 411, 427 and 443 (s. e. 4. 4) g, respectively. Corresponding carcass weight, kill-out proportion, carcass <b>conformation</b> <b>class</b> (scale 1 to 5) and carcass fat class (scale 1 to 5) values were 289, 312, 320 and 333 (s. e. 4. 0) kg, 516, 522, 542 and 553 (s. e. 3. 5) g/kg, 2. 5, 2. 4, 3. 0 and 3. 1 (s. e. 0. 10), and 3. 4, 3. 5, 2. 9 and 2. 8 (s. e. 0. 11). There were few breed type 3 genetic merit interactions. Delaying slaughter date increased slaughter weight, carcass weight and all measures of fatness. It also reduced the proportion of carcass weight in the hind quarter and the proportions of bone and muscle in the ribs joint. None of these effects accompanied the increase in carcass weight due to higher EPDCWT. It is concluded that BB have superior production traits to AA. Selection of sires for higher EPDCWT increases growth rate, kill-out proportion and carcass weight of progeny with little effect on carcass or muscle traits. The extra carcass weight due to higher EPDCWT is more valuable commercially than a comparable carcass weight increment from a delay in slaughter date because it comprises a higher proportion of muscle. peer-reviewe...|$|E

Studies were focused on the two main phases of lamb growth. Firstly, the period from birth to 6 weeks of age which coincides with the critical period of lamb survival and peak lactation in the ewe and, secondly, the finishing stage from 6 weeks until slaughter. Flock size was 230 to 250 ewes sponged in July/August for lambing in January and managed on 12. 6 ha of grass and forage. The results provide options in feeding and management for programmed lamb production in synchrony with early season prices.

40|$|End of Project ReportSummary The main {{objective}} of the beef breed evaluation programme carried out at Grange Beef Research Centre was to compare the productive characteristics of different beef breed crosses out of Holstein-Friesian cows. In {{the course of this}} work much additional information was acquired, particularly on growth patterns of body organs and tissues, and how these affect kill-out proportion and carcass composition. The data were also used to examine relationships between carcass classification variables and carcass composition. Cattle used for beef production in Ireland can be classified into three main biological types: (i) early maturing, (ii) dairy, and (iii) late maturing. Results from an experiment that compared Friesians (dairy), Hereford × Friesians (early maturing) and Charolais × Friesians (late maturing) are used to represent these biological types. The material is organized under the following headings: (i) non carcass parts and kill-out proportion, (ii) carcass composition, (iii) carcass tissue distribution, (iv) muscle chemical composition, (v) gender, (vi) dairy breeds, and (vii) carcass classification and composition. Kill-out proportion increased by about 10 g/kg from Friesians to Hereford × Friesians to Charolais × Friesians. It also increased by about 10 g/kg per 100 kg increase in slaughter weight. Friesians had higher proportions of gastrointestinal tract plus contents than the two beef crosses and also had higher proportions of metabolic organs. Hereford crosses had a higher proportion of hide and offal fats than Charolais crosses. At any carcass weight, early maturing animals had more fat and less bone and muscle than late maturing animals. As carcass weight increased, the proportions of bone and muscle in the carcass decreased, and the proportion of fat increased, but the rates of these changes differed with biological type. Carcass muscle distribution also differed with biological type. Late maturing cattle had a higher proportion of hind quarter and higher value muscle than Friesians and early maturing animals, while Friesians had higher proportions than early maturing animals. Muscle lipid content (marbling) differed with biological type (early maturing > dairy > late maturing) and with carcass joint (highest for flank and ribs, lowest for m. longissimus). Early maturing steers and heifers had similar carcass fat proportions when the heifers were about 60 kg carcass lighter than the steers. Despite having poorer carcass conformation, heifers had a slightly higher proportion of muscle and a considerably higher proportion of higher value muscle than steers. Carcass classification grade was not a reliable indicator of carcass muscle proportion. Carcass fat class was related to both carcass fat and muscle proportions but accounted for less than half the variance in these.

This allows us to measure directly the rate of reaction between active, empty I-Ek and a set of peptides that vary in structure. We find that all peptides studied, despite having highly variable dissociation rates, bind with similar association rate constants. Thus, the rate-limiting step in peptide binding is minimally sensitive to peptide side-chain structure. An interesting complication to this simple model is that a single peptide can sometimes bind to I-Ek in two kinetically distinguishable conformations, with the stable peptide-MHC complex isomer forming much more slowly than the less-stable one. This demonstrates that an additional free-energy barrier limits the formation of certain specific MHC-peptide complex <b>conformations.</b> <b>Class</b> II MHC 1 are heterodimeric membrane glycoproteins expressed on the surface of antigen presenting cells of the immune system. Class II MHC are peptide receptors, bindin...|$|R
40|$|A {{horse and}} pony {{project is a}} great way to learn about the care and {{training}} of horses. Although you don’t need a horse or pony to participate in the project, having access to a horse or pony will allow you to practice what you learn. The horse or pony you practice with may be of any breed or age. If you wish to show a horse or pony, you will be expected to care for the animal. Horses must be identified to an individual 4 -H’er by May 15. An exception to individual identification exists for families that have more 4 -H’ers than horses. If a family includes more 4 -H’ers than horses, more than one 4 -H’er may identify a horse; however, in this situation, a 4 -H’er can’t identify more than one horse. If a 4 -H’er wishes to show in <b>conformation</b> <b>classes,</b> the 4 -H’er must own the horse. Also, stallions of more than 12 months of age may not be exhibited in a 4 -H horse show or used in 4 -H project group activities. Ask your club leader or county 4 -H Youth Development leader for any additional rules that apply to the 4 -H horse project in your county...|$|R
40|$|Genetics of {{production}} traits and appearance in multi-way crossbred Swiss sheep population: preliminary results Genes influencing carcass quality, e. g. the Callipyge locus, {{are known to}} be located on sheep chromosome 18. Goals of this experiment were to asses the potential of the Dorper (D) as a terminal sire breed and to investigate possible relationships of carcass characteristics and other phenotypic traits with DNA markers on chromosome 18. Fifty three ewes, crossbreds of 3 Swiss sheep breeds, mated to 4 D and 3 White Alpine (W) rams, gave birth to 84 lambs in fall 2002, 22 remaining ewes to additional 33 lambs in fall 2003. A total of 108 lambs was visually appraised for conformation and wool traits at the average age of 56 days. Differences in colour patterns were observed between D and W progeny. Data on growth (80 lambs weighted weekly) and carcass traits (77 lambs slaughtered at an average live weight of 41 kg) were analysed by a statistical model that included either breed of sire or presence vs. absence of single allele as fixed effects. No significant effects were found for weights and growth traits. Significant differences (p < 0. 01) between D and W progeny, and between presence and absence of allele 122 of marker CSSM 18 (not present in W rams), however, were observed for some carcass traits. D progeny were superior to W progeny for carcass yield by 3 percent and by 0. 63 <b>conformation</b> <b>classes</b> i...|$|R
40|$|The {{classical}} {{approaches for}} protein structure prediction rely either on homology of the protein sequence with a template structure or on ab initio calculations for energy minimization. These methods suffer from disadvantages {{such as the}} lack of availability of homologous template structures or intractably large conformational search space, respectively. The recently proposed fragment library based approaches first predict the local structures, {{which can be used}} in conjunction with the classical approaches of protein structure prediction. The accuracy of the predictions is dependent {{on the quality of the}} fragment library. In this work, we have constructed a library of local <b>conformation</b> <b>classes</b> purely based on geometric similarity. The local conformations are represented using Geometric Invariants, properties that remain unchanged under transformations such as translation and rotation, followed by dimension reduction via principal component analysis. The local conformations are then modeled as a mixture of Gaussian probability distribution functions (PDF). Each one of the Gaussian PDF's corresponds to a conformational class with the centroid representing the average structure of that class. We find 46 classes when we use an octapeptide as a unit of local conformation. The protein 3 -D structure can now be described as a sequence of local conformational classes. Further, it was of interest to see whether the local conformations can be predicted from the amino acid sequences. To that end, we have analyzed the correlation between sequence features and the conformational classes...|$|R
40|$|A {{monoclonal}} antibody specific for the empty <b>conformation</b> of <b>class</b> II MHC molecules revealed {{the presence of}} abundant empty molecules {{on the surface of}} spleen- and bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (DC) among various types of antigen-presenting cells. The empty class II MHC molecules are developmentally regulated and expressed predominantly on immature DC. They can capture peptide antigens directly from the extracellular medium and present bound peptides to antigen-specific T lymphocytes. The ability of the empty cell-surface class II MHC proteins to bind peptides and present them to T cells without intracellular processing can serve to extend the spectrum of antigens able to be presented by DC, consistent with their role as sentinels in the immune system...|$|R
40|$|Recent crystallographic {{studies on}} two peptide {{complexes}} with the mouse Kb molecule {{have shown that}} peptide binding appears to alter the <b>conformation</b> of the <b>class</b> I alpha-helical regions that flank the antigen binding cleft. Given that this study also showed {{that much of the}} foreign peptide is buried within the class I binding cleft with only a small portion accessible for direct interaction with the components of the T cell receptor, this finding suggests that at least some component of T cell specificity may arise as a consequence of peptide-induced conformational changes in the class I structure. To assess this possibility, we have made systematic substitutions at residues within the Kb-restricted determinant from ovalbumin (OVA 257 - 264) that are thought to be buried on binding to the class I molecule. We have found that changes in this determinant at the completely buried second residue (P 2) can influence T cell recognition without affecting binding to Kb, suggesting that the substitutions may indirectly determine T cell recognition by altering the <b>conformation</b> of the <b>class</b> I molecule or the bound peptide.

Possibly by its preferential binding of the open, peptide-less <b>conformation</b> of MHC <b>class</b> II, HLA-DM then catalyzes peptide exchange, favoring more stable peptide-MHC complexes (which {{are resistant to}} DM action). Thus, HLA-DM is thought {{to play an important}} role in [...] "editing" [...] the peptide repertoire.|$|R
40|$|The {{expression}} of stable, correctly folded {{major histocompatibility complex}} class I molecules conferred susceptibility to murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) in cells which were previously resistant to infection, demonstrating that these molecules interact critically with MCMV to initiate infection. All class I molecules could potentiate MCMV infection but H- 2 Dd and Kb molecules were most efficient. Monoclonal antibodies specific for the alpha 1 and/or alpha 2 domains of Dd and Kb inhibited infection. Infection of L cells transfected with hybrid major histocompatibility complex class I molecules demonstrated that allelic control of susceptibility to MCMV mapped to the alpha 1 domain of Dd when in correct configuration with the alpha 2 and alpha 3 domains. In MCMV-resistant RMA-S cells, an improvement in the <b>conformation</b> of <b>class</b> I molecules introduced susceptibility to infection...|$|R
