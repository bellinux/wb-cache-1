30|$|Another {{possible}} {{extension of}} the products proposed in {{this paper is to}} create methods for automatic transformation <b>of</b> <b>catalogs</b> <b>of</b> NFR requirements into O 4 C-based catalogs.

As stated before, the quality of the results provided by the ObasCId approach depends on the existence <b>of</b> good <b>catalogs</b> <b>of</b> software concerns. However, the cost/effort to create/maintain this catalog may be impeditive. The idea of using well-known and validated <b>catalogs</b> <b>of</b> NFR requirements to create instances of software concerns may help the developers to get a better start point to maintain their own <b>catalogs</b> <b>of</b> software concerns.|$|R

5|$|Also {{attributable}} to Gasparo Cairano, and dated at this stage, is the singular St John the Baptist {{placed in the}} tympanum of the capitol of the eponymous Abbey in Parma. The work, undocumented and traditionally attributed by critics to Antonio Ferrari d'Agrate, was assigned in 2010 to the <b>catalog</b> <b>of</b> the works of Cairano due to obvious correlation with the mature art of the artist. This spread of Gasparo's artistic reach is significant and demonstrates that he could prove a success even outside of Brescia.|$|E

5|$|The English {{astronomer}} John Flamsteed catalogued over 3000 stars. Further discoveries paralleled {{the improvements}} in the size {{and quality of the}} telescope. More extensive star catalogues were produced by Lacaille. The astronomer William Herschel made a detailed <b>catalog</b> <b>of</b> nebulosity and clusters, and in 1781 discovered the planet Uranus, the first new planet found. The distance to a star was first announced in 1838 when the parallax of 61 Cygni was measured by Friedrich Bessel.|$|E
5|$|The first {{confirmed}} {{discovery of}} an extrasolar planet orbiting an ordinary main-sequence star occurred on 6 October 1995, when Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz of the University of Geneva announced {{the detection of}} an exoplanet around 51 Pegasi.

The <b>catalog</b> <b>of</b> Kepler candidate planets consists mostly of planets the size of Neptune and smaller, down to smaller than Mercury.|$|E
5|$|The first star {{catalogue}} in Greek astronomy {{was created by}} Aristillus in approximately 300 BC, {{with the help of}} Timocharis.

Hipparchus is known for the discovery of the first recorded nova (new star). Many of the constellations and star names in use today derive from Greek astronomy.|$|E

We describe an algorithm for the creation <b>of</b> <b>catalogs</b> <b>of</b> regular graphs. Using this algorithm, all of the regular graphs on thirteen or fewer vertices have been created. 1 Introduction Exhaustive <b>catalogs</b> <b>of</b> graphs can be an invaluable tool for research in graph theory. To be able to verify a conjecture quickly for all small graphs gives one extra confidence, and sometimes extra insight, into a problem. Or {{the discovery of a}} counterexample can lead to a necessary change in the hypothesis of a theorem. Additionally, in attempting to prove a result, one can use experiments on catalogs to help suggest or refine elements of a proof. In this report we describe the generation <b>of</b> <b>catalogs</b> <b>of</b> regular graphs on thirteen or fewer vertices. The algorithm used is fairly simple, {{with the exception of the}} need for a routine to determine if two graphs are isomorphic. Basically, [...] ...|$|R
