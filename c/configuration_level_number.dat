40|$|Responses of many {{real-world}} {{problems can}} only be evaluated perturbed by noise. In order to make an efficient optimization of these problems possible, intelligent optimization strategies successfully coping with noisy evaluations are required. In this article, {{a comprehensive review of}} existing kriging-based methods for the optimization of noisy functions is provided. In summary, ten methods for choosing the sequential samples are described using a unified formalism. They are compared on analytical benchmark problems, whereby the usual assumption of homoscedastic Gaussian noise made in the underlying models is meet. Different problem <b>configurations</b> (noise <b>level,</b> maximum <b>number</b> of observations, initial number of observations) and setups (covariance functions, budget, initial sample size) are considered. It is found that the choices of the initial sample size and the covariance function are not critical. The choice of the method, however, can result in significant differences in the performance. In particular, the three most intuitive criteria are found as poor alternatives. Although no criterion is found consistently more efficient than the others, two specialized methods appear more robust on average...|$|R

40|$|Advanced {{high-power}} {{electric propulsion}} systems can significantly enhance piloted Mars missions. An {{increase in the}} science payload delivered to Mars and {{the reduction of the}} total Earth-departure mass are the major system-level benefits of electric propulsion. Other potential benefits are the return of the cargo vehicle to Earth orbit and the availability of high power in Mars orbit for high-power science and communications. Parametric analyses for sizing the cargo mission vehicle for Mars exploration missions are presented. The nuclear-electric propulsion system thruster size, power level, mass, propellant type and payload mass capability are considered in these system-level trade studies. Descriptions of the propulsion system selection issues for both ion and MPD thruster technologies are also discussed. On a manned Mars mission, the total launch mass for an unmanned cargo vehicle in low earth orbit (LEO) can be reduced by up to 50 percent over the baseline oxygen/hydrogen propulsion system. Because the cargo vehicle is sent to Mars prior to the manned mission, the trip time for the vehicle is not a critical factor. By taking advantage of the high specific impulse (I sub sp) of an ion or a Magneto-Plasma-Dynamic (MPD) thruster system, the total LEO mass is reduced from 590, 000 kg for the oxygen/hydrogen propulsion system to 309, 000 kg for the MPD system and 295, 000 kg for the ion system. Many factors must be analyzed in the design of a electric propulsion Mars cargo vehicle. The propellant selection, the number of thrusters, the power level and the specific impulse are among the most important of the parameters. To fully address the electric propulsion system design, trade studies for the differing ion and MPD propulsion system <b>configurations</b> (thruster power <b>levels,</b> <b>number</b> of thrusters, propellants and power systems) must be conducted...|$|R

The application is created using components and binding their interfaces appropriately at the <b>configuration</b> <b>level.</b> This is especially interesting for applications that, for availability reasons, claim for dynamic reconfiguration. This paper describes an approach for dynamic reconfiguration of applications based on CORBA components running in an environment called LuaSpace that is composed by the dynamically typed language Lua and a set of tools based on Lua.
