30|$|The {{choice of}} the {{threshold}} K is somewhat difficult; it can be fixed arbitrarily or by estimating the noise. For this purpose, the authors in [8] proposed to choose it using the <b>cumulated</b> <b>histogram</b> of the gradient. Generally speaking, if K is big, {{the preservation of the}} edge will be better; however, the noise will not be sufficiently removed; but if K is small, the noise will be well removed, but the edges of the image will be blurred.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} an {{improvement}} of the classical image multi-thresholding methods. The goal is to achieve the precise determination of homogeneous zones in numerical images by pixels classification. The thresholds and the modes are obtained by minimization of a new energy of gravitational clustering initialized with the significant peaks of a <b>cumulated</b> <b>histogram.</b> Then, the best modes and the best thresholds are calculated by alternate optimization of an energy of multi-thresholding, leading to a piecewise quadratic potential. This energy is built from a total uniformity criterion which measures the homogeneity of a given map of regions. Finally, an unsupervised classification is performed by use of a supervised variational classification approach which minimizes an adapted energy of transitions of phases. The potential which controls the classification process is built from the previously determined best thresholds and modes. The experimental study shows the efficiency and the robustness of the whole method. 1...|$|E

The tone mapping is essential to electronic image sensors of the digital imaging, and the color-to-grayscale conversion is useful in black-and-white representing devices (printing and displaying). Before giving a detailed account for the proposed methods, we summarize the digital imaging and explain its fundamental topicsoptical system of digital imaging, basic terminology of digital imaging, presented algorithms. In the electronic image sensor, the high dynamic range of natural luminance has to be approximated in the limited dynamic range. This is dynamic range compression, and tone mapping is the operation that approximates the appearance of high dynamic range images to intermediate levels that can be represented by more limited dynamic range devices (display devices or printing devices). Recently, the tone mapping is applied to acquire a high quality digital image using ADCs over 14 -bit with a computational unit in digital cameras. Simple representative curves for the tone mapping are linear, <b>cumulated</b> <b>histogram,</b> and logarithmic curves. This thesis presents a novel tone mapping algorithm incorporating the three simple curves by a projection operation. The proposed tone mapping takes advantage of each tone mapping curve efficiently. The acquired digital image is displayed, stored, or printed through various devices. When the image is printed on a black-and-white device, color images should be converted to black-and-white (grayscale) images. In this thesis, a novel colorto- grayscale conversion is presented, which is converting color images to grayscale images by reducing dimensions. The reducing process takes the projection operation in the imensions. The proposed method has the advantages of preserving chromatic contrasts, maintaining luminance consistency, and having a low computational cost. Furthermore, the proposed method has high resistance to artifacts such as halos that can occur when using local contents...|$|E
30|$|One hundred sixty-two {{patients}} with a newly diagnosed glioma classified according to histologic and molecular genetic properties were evaluated. The biological tumour volume (BTV) was segmented in static 20 – 40  min p.i. 18 F-FET PET images using the established threshold of 1.6 [*]×[*]background activity. For each enclosed voxel, the time-to-peak (TTP), the late slope (Slope 15 – 40), and the tumour-to-background ratios (TBR 5 – 15, TBR 20 – 40) obtained from 5 to 15  min p.i. and 20 to 40  min p.i. images were determined. The percentage portion of these values within the BTV was evaluated with percentage volume fractions (PVFs) and <b>cumulated</b> percentage volume <b>histograms</b> (PVHs). The ability to differentiate histologic and molecular genetic classes was assessed and compared to volume-of-interest (VOI)-based parameters.|$|R
30|$|Voxel-wise {{analysis}} was performed with an in-house developed software (C++ with integration of the ROOT data analysis framework, version 6.09 / 01, Cern, Switzerland; and ITK segmentation and registration toolkit, version 4.11, National Library of Medicine). For each voxel within the BTV, the following kinetic and static parameters were determined: the TTP, the late slope (Slope 15 – 40, 15 – 40  min p.i.), and the tumour-to-background ratios TBR 5 – 15 and TBR 20 – 40 in early 5 – 15  min p.i. and late 20 – 40  min p.i. summation images, with the BG signal derived from the respective time frame. The Slope 15 – 40 was estimated by linear fitting {{of the last three}} time points, and the TTP was estimated as the time corresponding to the maximal TAC value starting from 2.7  min p.i. to avoid influence from early blood signal. Within the BTV, the sub-volume fractions consisting of voxels with a specific parameter value were determined and stored in histograms. For this, the histograms were plotted with the binned parameter values on the x-axis (histogram bin sizes: time frames of dynamic PET images for TTP, 0.6 SUV/h for Slope 15 – 40, and 0.25 for TBR) and the percentage fractions of the total BTV on the y-axis (percentage volume fractions, PVFs). <b>Cumulated</b> percentage volume <b>histograms</b> (PVHs) were obtained by <b>cumulating</b> these PVF <b>histograms</b> up to the specific bin, to improve the robustness of parameter effect quantification [29, 30]. For example PVFTTP 15 – 20 corresponds to the percentage portion of voxels within the BTV with peak value in time frame 14 (15 – 20  min p.i.), and PVHTTP[*]<[*] 20 to the cumulated percentage portion of voxels with TTP <[*] 20  min p.i.. In order to exemplarily illustrate the influence of noise in dynamic PET data onto the estimation of parametric TTP and Slope 15 – 40 images, a simple method for noise reduction, a spatial Gaussian filter with 10  mm full width half maximum (FWHM), was applied to the dynamic PET data prior to the estimation and analysis of alternative TTP and Slope 15 – 40 images.|$|R
