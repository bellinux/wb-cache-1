5000|$|The {{economics}} of breeding and raising Belgian Blue cattle are inconclusive because of complications experienced during parturition and metabolic demand for increased concentrated feeds. The breed's increased {{need to have}} Caesarean sections when calving means increased cost and added work, and can become a welfare issue. However, the <b>carcass</b> <b>value</b> of double-muscled animals may be enhanced due to increased dressing yield, lean carcass content, and upgrading of some cuts leading to {{a higher proportion of}} higher valued cuts. [...] The slower rate of fat deposition causes slaughtering to be delayed in most cases, which means an increase in maintenance costs in those animals. Belgian Blue cattle require more skilled management and do not thrive in harsh environments. [...] For these reasons and others, the breed's overall production efficiency in an economic sense is still unclear.|$|E

DXA measured total body fat and lean content, BIA measurements of resistance (Rs) and reactance (Xc) {{were used to}} calculate total body lean mass and ultrasound measurements of backfat (BF) depth and longissimus muscle area (LMA) were used to calculate total carcass lean mass.

Key words: beef prices, cattle prices, forecast, leading indicators. From a derived demand perspective, beef pric-es may be useful to infer future changes in fed cattle prices. Carcass quotes are no longer sup-ported because of low volume and the in-creased occurrence of formula pricing (Ray). Estimates are that over 90 % of all carcass trades are made by formula (Burke). This has resulted in a "thin " market for beef carcasses (Hayenga and Schrader). A thin market may result from low volume and a small proportion of nego-tiated and publicly reported trades (Hayenga).

40|$|Five hundred thirty-four steers were {{evaluated}} over a 2 -yr period {{to develop and}} validate prediction equations for estimating carcass composition from live animal ultrasound measurements and to compare these equations with those developed from carcass measurements. Within 5 d before slaughter, steers were ultrasonically measured for 12 th-rib fat thickness (UFAT), longissimus area (ULMA), rump fat thickness (URPFAT), and body wall thickness (UBDWALL). Carcasses were fabricated to determine weight (KGRPRD) and percentage (PRPRD) of boneless, totally trimmed retail product. Data from steers born in Year 1 (n = 282) were used to develop prediction equations using stepwise regression. Final models using live animal variables included live weight (FWT), UFAT, ULMA, and URPFAT for KGRPRD (R 2 = 0. 83) and UFAT, URPFAT, ULMA, FWT, and UBDWALL for PRPRD (R 2 = 0. 67). Equations developed from USDA yield grade variables resulted in R 2 values of 0. 87 and 0. 68 for KGRPRD and PRPRD, respectively. When these equations were applied to steers born in Year 2 (n = 252), correlations between values predicted from live animal models and actual <b>carcass</b> <b>values</b> were 0. 92 for KGRPRD, and ranged from 0. 73 to 0. 76 for PRPRD.

40|$|Increased {{movement}} toward alliances and grid pricing in the U. S. {{has led to}} an increase interest in genetic <b>values</b> for <b>carcass</b> traits. The literature suggests that <b>carcass</b> genetic <b>values</b> are an effective tool to enhance selection for carcass traits, and {{that it is possible to}} select sires within a breed that can increase marbling score without adversely affecting external fat thickness or percent retail product relative to the breed mean. Ultrasound has been investigated as a cheaper means of collecting carcass information. The literature indicates that carcass traits measured via ultrasound on yearling seedstock will respond to selection. Although the literature is variable on the subject, there are reported genetic correlation (r g) estimates between live animal ultrasound and actual carcass attributes that are greater than. 70 for all ultrasonically measured carcass traits. When r g between seedstock ultrasound and slaughter cattle carcass measures are > 0. 70, similar or greater genetic progress in finished cattle carcass merit could be achieved by using ultrasound information entirely compared to using typical carcass progeny information; however, the maximum accuracy of prediction using ultrasound information in lieu of finished cattle carcass information would be r g. Therefore both actual and live animal, ultrasonically measured carcass traits should be included in genetic evaluation programs, which will allow for an increase in the accuracy of prediction of <b>carcass</b> genetic <b>values</b> on young seedstock animals due to the inclusion of ultrasound information, and will also allow for the possible production of high accuracy sires based on finished cattle progeny carcass information.

40|$|The radical {{reform of}} the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) in the early 1990 ’s {{impacted}} directly and indirectly {{on most of the}} farm enterprises in Ireland. The direct focus of the reform was largely confined to the cereal and beef enterprises. The reforms consisted of: • A phased reduction in the institutional support prices for cereals and beef of the order of 30 per cent • A phased switch to a direct payment system of farm income support to compensate for the product price reductions. Most farms in Ireland have a cattle enterprise, either alone or in combination with other land using enterprises. Therefore, the reforms of the CAP affected almost all the farms in the country either directly or indirectly. For cattle farmers, the potential consequencee of these changes could be far reaching in terms of their magnitude and their permeation into the details of the husbandry practices of the production system(s) themselves. These changes clearly impact on the economic efficiency of beef systems without necessarily affecting technical efficiency of the systems.
