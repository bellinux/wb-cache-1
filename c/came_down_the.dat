5|$|The first {{bridge to}} be {{constructed}} was a three-arch stone bridge, {{which was built}} in 1746. It was destroyed by a heavy storm which caused the River Taff to flood about two years later. A large amount of debris <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> river, which then become trapped against the two abutments supporting the bridge. The weight and force of the debris ultimately destroyed the bridge, which was then swept away down the river.|$|E
5|$|On 3 April the Joint Chiefs persuaded McNamara and Johnson {{to launch}} a four-week attack on North Vietnam's lines of communications, which would isolate that nation from its {{overland}} sources of supply in the PRC and the Soviet Union. About one-third of the North's imports <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> northeast railroad from the PRC, while the remaining two-thirds came by sea through Haiphong and other ports. For {{the first time in}} the campaign, targets were to be chosen for their military, rather than their psychological, significance. During the four weeks, 26 bridges and seven ferries were destroyed. Other targets included the extensive North Vietnamese radar system, barracks, and ammunition depots.|$|E
5|$|Word of the Gold Rush spread {{slowly at}} first. The {{earliest}} gold-seekers {{were people who}} lived near California or people who heard the news from ships on the fastest sailing routes from California. The first large group of Americans to arrive were several thousand Oregonians who <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Siskiyou Trail. Next came people from the Sandwich Islands, and several thousand Latin Americans, including people from Mexico, from Peru and {{from as far away}} as Chile, both by ship and overland. By the end of 1848, some 6,000 Argonauts had come to California.|$|E

5|$|According to legend, Sherwood's sons put {{her body}} near the fireplace, and a wind <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> chimney. Her body {{disappeared}} amid the embers, {{with the only}} clue being a cloven hoofprint. Sherwood lies in an unmarked grave under some trees in a field near the intersection of Pungo Ferry Road and Princess Anne Road in Virginia Beach. Stories about the Devil taking her body, unnatural storms, and loitering black cats quickly arose after her death, and local men killed every feline they could find; this widespread killing of cats might have caused the infestation of rats and mice recorded in Princess Anne County in 1743. Her home on Muddy Creek stood for over 200 years. After being burned {{several times in the}} 20th century by vandals, all that was left in 2002 were the brick chimneys, which were bulldozed in November 2002. All that remains are a few bricks and part of the foundation, which is overgrown. The property is now owned by the Federal Government as part of Back Bay National Wildlife Refuge.|$|E
5|$|After departing {{the area}} {{he reached the}} west coast, but Braham had loitered for too long. He spotted two Fw 190s {{approaching}} fast from the east. Braham had shot down two of these machines in a Mosquito but he was uncertain of how experienced these pilots had been. There was no cloud cover and the Mosquito could not outrun the faster and more agile single-engine fighters for long. He decided to turn and fight while he still could. In a head-on attack the first Fw 190 pilot missed but the second struck the port wing and engine with cannon fire causing a large fire. The instrument panel and cockpit window was shot through missing both Walsh and Braham by inches. Braham dived to the sea levelling out below 100 feet. He tried to use the fire extinguisher to stop the fire. The German pilot shared Braham's philosophy of ensuring a kill by shooting at an enemy aircraft until it <b>came</b> <b>down.</b> <b>The</b> Mosquito was hit again and Braham crash-landed his aircraft onto a beach at 150 miles per hour.|$|E
5|$|In {{the main}} event, John Cena faced Kurt Angle for the WWE Championship. The match began with Angle and Cena locking up, leading to Angle taking Cena {{down with a}} {{headlock}} takeover. Cena countered many attacks by Angle {{and was able to}} reverse the ankle lock. Cena attempted an FU but Angle delivered an Angle Slam. Eric Bischoff <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> ramp and cheered for Angle, who had the Ankle Lock applied on Cena. Cena rolled out of the move, grabbed the championship belt, which Bischoff had brought with him, and hit Angle with it. The referee saw this and called for the bell. As a result, Cena was disqualified for hitting Angle with the championship, ultimately resulting in him retaining his title. After the match, Angle attacked Cena until Cena delivered an FU through the Spanish announce table on Angle.|$|E

5|$|On Saturday afternoon, Matt Kenseth was fastest in {{the second}} {{practice}} session {{with a time of}} 30.321 seconds, ahead of Clint Bowyer and Earnhardt. Travis Kvapil was fourth-fastest; David Gilliland was fifth and Biffle sixth. Johnson, Newman, Hornish and Edwards followed in the top ten. Kyle Busch scraped the outside wall while driving up the track; he sustained minor damage and did not switch to a back-up car. Later that day, Kahne paced the final practice session with a time of 30.580 seconds; Edwards was second and Paul Menard third. Gordon was fourth-fastest, ahead of Hendrick Motorsports teammates Johnson and Earnhardt. Reutimann was seventh-fastest, Biffle eighth, Bowyer ninth, and Dave Blaney tenth. Bowyer moved to the outside of the track but was unable to steer left and hit the outside wall leaving turn-two and into the backstretch; he <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> track and Kyle Petty hit Bowyer and damaged his front-left fender before Bowyer's car stopped after he made contact with the inside wall. Bowyer was required to use a back-up car but Petty was able to repair his chassis.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 21 April 1916, the 2nd BCS sailed again for the Skagerrak, this time to support efforts to disrupt the {{transport}} of Swedish ore to Germany. The planned destroyer sweep of the Kattegat was cancelled when word came that the High Seas Fleet was mobilising for an operation of their own (later learned to be timed {{to coincide with the}} Irish Easter Rising), and the British ships were ordered to a rendezvous point {{in the middle of the}} North Sea, while the rest of the Grand Fleet made for the south-eastern end of the Long Forties. On the afternoon of 22 April, the Battlecruiser Fleet was patrolling to the north-west of Horn Reefs when heavy fog <b>came</b> <b>down.</b> <b>The</b> ships were zigzagging to avoid submarine attack when Australia collided with sister ship New Zealand twice in three minutes. Australia was damaged badly enough to be put out of action for several months, but New Zealand returned to the fleet on 30 May, a day before the start of the Battle of Jutland, relieving Indefatigable as flagship.|$|E
5|$|North Carolina's first {{possession}} of the second overtime period ended with a turnover, while Kansas missed a long jump shot in theirs. North Carolina's Brennan boxed out Chamberlain who went over Brennan to collect the rebound and was called for over the back. Joe Quigg turned the ball over after traveling, while Chamberlain threw {{the ball out of}} bounds on the subsequent possession. Carolina failed to capitalize on Chamberlain's error when Kearns missed the front end of a one–and–one. Kansas <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> court and passed the ball to Chamberlain who was then fouled hard by Cunningham. This sparked an altercation between the two teams, which resulted in Chamberlain being hit in the stomach with a megaphone and his knee being scarred by a Carolina cheerleader. The referees stopped the commotion and Chamberlain was sent to the line, where he missed his shots, and Carolina got the rebound. The Tar Heels aimed to hold the ball for a final shot but they turned the ball over to Kansas with ten seconds to go and the Jayhawks called a timeout with six seconds left. The ball went to Kansas' Loneski who missed a shot and the game remained tied at 48.|$|E

5|$|The {{main event}} was next, {{featuring}} The Undertaker versus Yokozuna in a casket match with Chuck Norris as the special outside referee. The Undertaker gained the early advantage, but Yokozuna reversed the momentum with a Samoan drop. He {{tried to put}} The Undertaker in the casket, but The Undertaker fought back. Yokozuna next performed a leg drop and placed The Undertaker in the casket. Before Yokozuna could close the lid, however, The Undertaker attacked him and the two wrestlers fought while standing in the casket. The Undertaker performed a clothesline from the top rope and placed Yokozuna in the casket. King Kong Bundy and Bam Bam Bigelow <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> aisle toward the ring, but Chuck Norris blocked their path. While Norris was distracted, however, Irwin R. Schyster entered the ring {{from the other side}} and attacked The Undertaker. He placed The Undertaker in the casket, but The Undertaker recovered before Yokozuna could close the lid. Jeff Jarrett tried to interfere on Yokozuna's behalf, but Norris stopped him with a superkick. The Undertaker performed a DDT and a big boot on Yokozuna. He then rolled his opponent in to the casket and closed the lid to gain the victory.|$|E
5|$|The {{weather was}} fine as Australia started their second innings just after noon. From the second {{ball of the}} innings, bowled by Bedser, Barnes got off the mark to avoid his pair. Coxon took the new ball {{at the other end}} and Barnes and Morris saw it off. In {{contrast}} to their English counterparts, the Australian opening pair took a cautious approach to begin with, avoiding the hook shot and not playing at balls that were not going to hit the stumps and established a solid start for themselves. Yardley then introduced Laker, who induced Morris to hit a ball back down the pitch in the air, but the bowler was slow to react to the possibility of a caught and bowled. According to O'Reilly, most other bowlers {{would have been able to}} reach the ball and attempt a catch. Barnes survived a missed stumping opportunity from Laker in the same over when he was on 18; he <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> pitch and the ball bounced out of the footmarks and narrowly missed leg stump, but Evans fumbled it, and it went away for four byes.|$|E

25|$|At a {{practical}} level, {{word of the}} expedition, and descriptions of the fertile valley land beyond the mountain range, apparently didn't do much in the short-term to open the Shenandoah Valley for development from the east. The mountain range was a formidable barrier. Instead, most of the early settlers <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Valley from the north, many of German and Scottish descent. Groups of Mennonites migrated from Pennsylvania, and settled in the general area of present-day Rockingham County and Harrisonburg, where their descendants may still be found today.|$|E

25|$|Although a {{small number}} of American traders and trappers had lived in California since the early 1830s, the first {{organized}} overland party of American immigrants was the Bartleson–Bidwell Party of 1841.

Also in 1841, an overland exploratory party of the United States Exploring Expedition <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Siskiyou Trail from the Pacific Northwest. In 1844, Caleb Greenwood guided the first settlers to take wagons over the Sierra Nevada. In 1846, the misfortunes of the Donner Party earned notoriety as they struggled to enter California.|$|E
