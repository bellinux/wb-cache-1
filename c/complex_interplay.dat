The biological factors are genetic and hormonal, both of which affect the fetal development of the brain, while environmental factors may be sociological, psychological, or involve the early uterine environment. Scientists generally do not believe that sexual orientation is a matter of choice.|$|E

We also propose that future research explore a wider range of non-mainstream contexts, especially those lacking significant endowments of financial resources.

Because of the <b>complex</b> <b>interplay</b> of the ribbon elements with the ships that would be trapped within it, ILM decided the refugee ships and Enterprise-B should be CG models. To make the switch between computer-generated and motion-control passes of the physical model appear seamless, ILM created a wireframe of the physical model, with the computer-generated model's textures taken from photos of the physical model, shot in flat light with a long lens. The tendril strike that sends Kirk into the Nexus was simulated with the layering of multiple pieces of animation, including CG explosions Knoll rendered on his personal computer and a recycled explosion effect from The Empire Strikes Back.|$|E
25|$|DNA {{methylation}} frequently {{occurs in}} repeated sequences, {{and helps to}} suppress the expression and mobility of 'transposable elements': Because 5-methylcytosine can be spontaneously deaminated (replacing nitrogen by oxygen) to thymidine, CpG sites are frequently mutated and become rare in the genome, except at CpG islands where they remain unmethylated. Epigenetic changes of this type thus {{have the potential to}} direct increased frequencies of permanent genetic mutation. DNA methylation patterns are known to be established and modified in response to environmental factors by a <b>complex</b> <b>interplay</b> of at least three independent DNA methyltransferases, DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B, the loss of any of which is lethal in mice. DNMT1 is the most abundant methyltransferase in somatic cells, localizes to replication foci, has a 10–40-fold preference for hemimethylated DNA and interacts with the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA).|$|E
25|$|Along with {{bisexuality}} and heterosexuality, {{homosexuality is}} one of the three main categories of sexual orientation within the heterosexual–homosexual continuum. Scientists do not know exactly what determines an individual's sexual orientation, but they believe that it is caused by a <b>complex</b> <b>interplay</b> of genetic, hormonal, and environmental influences, These relationships are equivalent to heterosexual relationships in essential psychological respects. Homosexual relationships and acts have been admired, as well as condemned, throughout recorded history, depending on the form they took and the culture in which they occurred. Since the end of the 19th century, there has been a global movement towards increased visibility, recognition, and legal rights for gay people, including the rights to marriage and civil unions, adoption and parenting, employment, military service, equal access to health care, and the introduction of anti-bullying legislation to protect gay minors.|$|E

40|$|Chapter Intro Power is a {{critical}} aspect of child–adult relationships {{and the formation of}} children’s geographies. It is tempting to see the adult world as all powerful and children’s worlds as subjected to control and direction, but the picture is more complex than that. Children do have less power in many respects, but they also have agency, and child–adult relations have <b>complex</b> <b>interplays</b> of power; for example, children’s skilful manipulation of parents and adults. One way in which power flows between adults’ and children’s worlds is through adult constructions of what childhood is and how it should be treated. Jenks (2005) shows that differing ideologies of childhood result in children’s lives being shaped in markedly different ways. One such ideology of childhood is the country childhood idyll...|$|R
25|$|As {{the band}} and its sound matured over thirty years of touring, playing, and recording, each member's stylistic {{contribution}} became more defined, consistent, and identifiable. Lesh, who was originally a classically trained trumpet player with an extensive background in music theory, did not tend to play traditional blues-based bass forms, but opted for more melodic, symphonic and complex lines, often sounding like a second lead guitar. Weir, too, was not a traditional rhythm guitarist, but tended to play jazz-influenced, unique inversions at {{the upper end of}} the Dead's sound. The two drummers, Mickey Hart and Kreutzmann, developed a unique, <b>complex</b> <b>interplay,</b> balancing Kreutzmann's steady beat with Hart's interest in percussion styles outside the rock tradition. Hart incorporated an 11-count measure to his drumming, bringing a new dimension to the band's sound that became an important part of its emerging style. Garcia's lead lines were fluid, supple and spare, owing a great deal of their character to his training in fingerpicking and banjo.|$|E
25|$|Since Metchnikoff, {{advances}} in science have uncovered {{that the process}} of pathogenic inhibition is more complex than simply increasing the acidity in the colon, as the probiotic bacteria produce bacteriocins, bacterial synthesized proteins that inhibit pathogenic bacteria. In the case of L. bulgaricus this bacteriocin is called bulgaricin. Also there is a <b>complex</b> <b>interplay</b> between the probiotic bacteria and the body's immune system in the large intestine, where the good bacteria stimulate the body's own immune system to inhibit the pathogenic bacteria. For example, in a controlled study, 61 elderly volunteers, after 6 months of a daily dose of L. bulgaricus, responded to the intake of probiotic with an increase in the percentage of NK cells, an improvement in the parameters defining the immune risk profile (IRP), and an increase in the T cell subsets that are less differentiated. The probiotic group also showed decreased concentrations of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-8 but increased antimicrobial peptide hBD-2.|$|E
25|$|FI {{is a sign}} or a symptom, not a diagnosis, and {{represents}} an extensive list of causes. Usually, it {{is the result of}} a <b>complex</b> <b>interplay</b> of several coexisting factors, many of which may be simple to correct. Up to 80% of people may have more than one abnormality that is contributing. Deficits of individual functional components of the continence mechanism can be partially compensated for a certain period of time, until the compensating components themselves fail. For example, obstetric injury may precede onset by decades, but postmenopausal changes in the tissue strength reduce in turn the competence of the compensatory mechanisms. The most common factors in the development are thought to be obstetric injury and after effects of anorectal surgery, especially those involving the anal sphincters and hemorrhoidal vascular cushions. The majority of incontinent persons over the age of 18 fall into one of several groups: those with structural anorectal abnormalities (sphincter trauma, sphincter degeneration, perianal fistula, rectal prolapse), neurological disorders (multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, spina bifida, stroke, etc.), constipation/fecal loading (presence of a large amount of feces in the rectum with stool of any consistency), cognitive and/or behavioral dysfunction (dementia, learning disabilities), diarrhea, inflammatory bowel diseases (e.g. ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease), irritable bowel syndrome, disability related (people who are frail, acutely unwell, or have chronic/acute disabilities), and those cases which are idiopathic (of unknown cause). Diabetes mellitus is also known to be a cause, but the mechanism of this relationship is not well understood.|$|E

50|$|Among {{all living}} organisms, flowers, {{which are the}} {{reproductive}} structures of angiosperms, are the most varied physically and show a correspondingly great diversity in methods of reproduction. Plants that are not flowering plants (green algae, mosses, liverworts, hornworts, ferns and gymnosperms such as conifers) also have <b>complex</b> <b>interplays</b> between morphological adaptation and environmental factors in their sexual reproduction.

500|$|Within {{the medical}} and {{scientific}} communities, there is a broad consensus regarding alcoholism as a disease state. For example, the American Medical Association considers alcohol a drug and states that [...] "drug addiction is a chronic, relapsing brain disease characterized by compulsive drug seeking and use despite often devastating consequences. It results from a <b>complex</b> <b>interplay</b> of biological vulnerability, environmental exposure, and developmental factors (e.g., stage of brain maturity)." [...] Alcoholism has a higher prevalence among men, though, in recent decades, the proportion of female alcoholics has increased. Current evidence indicates that in both men and women, alcoholism is 50–60 percent genetically determined, leaving 40–50 percent for environmental influences. Most alcoholics develop alcoholism during adolescence or young adulthood. 31 percent of college students show signs of alcohol abuse, while six percent are dependent on alcohol. Under the DSM's new definition of alcoholics, that means about 37 percent of college students may meet the criteria.|$|E

Novelist Elizabeth Hand criticised that [...] "...the spectacularly <b>complex</b> <b>interplay</b> of {{narrative}} and character often reads as though an entire trilogy's worth of summing-up has been crammed into one volume." [...] In a starred review from Kirkus Reviews, the reviewer said, [...] "Rowling has shown uncommon skill in playing them with and against each other, and also woven them into a darn good bildungsroman, populated by memorable characters and infused with a saving, irrepressible sense of fun". They also praised {{the second half of the}} novel, but criticised the epilogue, calling it [...] "provocatively sketchy". In another review from The Times, reviewer Amanda Craig said that while Rowling was [...] "not an original, high-concept author", she was [...] "right up there with other greats of children's fiction". Craig went on to say that the novel was [...] "beautifully judged, and a triumphant return to form", and that Rowling's imagination changed the perception of an entire generation, which [...] "is more than all but a handful of living authors, in any genre, have achieved in the past half-century".|$|E

30|$|Test {{performance}} and behaviors {{are the result}} of <b>complex</b> <b>interplays</b> between a set of variables that involve the test itself, administration, scoring, and test-takers (Bachman and Palmer 1996), which is no exception for WAF tests, as this review revealed. Researchers thus {{need to be aware of}} those complex interactions and be informed and strategic with their use of WAF tests, particularly when vocabulary depth indexed by the tests is used to predict language skills development (e.g., reading comprehension). Depending on the features of a test, how the test is administered and scored, and who the learners are, the target effect could be either overestimated or underestimated. Overall, the information in the literature about the complex interactions between variables within each level and across levels is very limited, and many issues remain to be explored in the future.|$|R
