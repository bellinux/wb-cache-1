40|$|Groupware toolkits let {{developers}} build {{applications for}} synchronous and distributed <b>computer-based</b> <b>conferencing.</b> This chapter describes four components {{that we believe}} toolkits must provide. A run-time architecture automatically manages the creation, interconnection, and communications of both centralized and distributed processes that comprise conference sessions. A set of groupware programming abstractions allows developers to control the behavior of distributed processes, to take action on state changes, and to share relevant data. Groupware widgets let interface features of value to conference participants be added easily to groupware applications. Session managers let people create and manage their meetings and are built by developers to accommodate the group’s working style. We illustrate the many ways these components can be designed by drawing on our own experiences with GroupKit, and by reviewing approaches taken by other toolkit developers...|$|E
40|$|The usual {{methods of}} {{information}} exchange within a specialty, such as journals and newsletters, have deficiencies {{in terms of}} speed. Adjuncts to them such as the telephone, traditional correspondence, and meetings have other problems with coverage and cost. Advances in computing and tele-communications provide an additional medium for group communication {{that can be a}} complement to the strengths of the other media.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a set of interactive tools for collecting, annotating, and analyzing group communication sessions. These tools {{have been used to}} model group meetings which we have enacted on our <b>computer-based</b> video <b>conferencing</b> system as well as single location meetings. The purpose of this work is to support the analysis of group meetings over <b>computer-based</b> video <b>conferencing</b> systems. The resulting analysis can be used for various purposes including creating meeting summaries, identifying communication patterns, facilitating group communication, and suggesting agendas for follow-on meetings. The current system is used for off-line annotation and analysis of communication sessions which involve various parallel media tracks including the video and audio component for each participant, the text transcription of the meeting, and various documents and media forms referenced during the session. In this paper we review these tools and describe an architecture for employing these techniq [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{availability}} of text reading and editing software for Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) makes it timely {{to consider whether}} PDAs are useful tools for reading learning materials. This paper describes a study that evaluated the use of PDAs for reading by students on a Masters course run by the UK Open University. The evaluation consisted of pre- and post-questionnaires, and follow-up interviews. In addition, students discussed their experiences in a <b>computer-based</b> <b>conference.</b> Findings show that while the portability of the device was welcomed by students, and the electronic format was advantageous, limitations such as the small screen size, navigation difficulties, and slow and error-prone methods for entering text, {{made it difficult to}} read and interact with documents on the PDA. The paper recommends that further research consider the value of PDAs as reading devices in the context of other potential ways that PDAs can be used as learning tools...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} GroupKit, a groupware toolkit that lets developers build applications for synchronous and distributed <b>computer-based</b> <b>conferencing.</b> GroupKit was constructed from our belief that programming groupware should be only slightly harder than building functionally similar single-user systems. We {{have been able to}} significantly reduce the implementation complexity of groupware through the key features that comprise GroupKit. A runtime infrastructure automatically manages the creation, interconnection, and communications of the distributed processes that comprise conference sessions. A set of groupware programming abstractions allows developers to control the behaviour of distributed processes, to take action on state changes, and to share relevant data. Groupware widgets let interface features of value to conference participants to be easily added to groupware applications.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} an empirical study of several policies {{for managing the}} effect of delay jitter on the playout of audio and video in computer-based conferences. The problem addressed is that of managing the fundamental tradeoff between display with low latency and display with few gaps. We describe a particular policy called queue monitoring which observes delay jitter over time and dynamically adjusts display latency {{in order to support}} low-latency conferences with an acceptable gap rate. Queue monitoring is evaluated by comparing it with two policies from the literature in a study based on measurements from a <b>computer-based</b> <b>conferencing</b> system. Our results show that queue monitoring performs as well or better than the other policies over the range of observed network loads. More importantly, we show that queue monitoring performs better on those network loads for which the other policies exhibit poor performance. 1...|$|E
40|$|Five short {{undergraduate}} {{courses were}} run, four using a <b>computer-based</b> <b>conferencing</b> system and one paper-based to support collaborative study practices. The {{seriousness of the}} emphasis on collaborative study was communicated to the students not only {{through the use of}} conferences, but also of students’ own writing as set reading material, and of material from the conference {{as the basis for the}} final examination. Students responded best when the tutor participated in conferences in a similar style to themselves. Even when some computer-based features were lost, as in the course which used a paper file for public writing, students made significant use of this forum. However factors outside the design of the system for supporting collaboration seemed to play the strongest part in determining the value students found in using the it. These included the physical conditions, initial induction process, tutor’s participation style, and assessment practices...|$|E

Accommodating latecomers in {{a system}} for {{synchronous}} collab-oration (Under the direction of Professor Kevin Jeffay) This thesis deals {{with the problem of}} allowing a latecomer to join a <b>computer-based</b> <b>conference</b> that is already in progress. A conference is a synchronous collab-oration session where people at remote locations are cooperating through identical copies of windows generated by applications shared by all conference participants. The shared windows are displayed by window systems residing on the collaborators' workstations according to commands issued by the shared applications. A {{solution to the problem of}} accommodating a latecomer is found by recording the modifi-cations to the window system's state implied in the series of commands generated by the applications, and later imposing these state modifications on a latecomer's window system. An efficient way to record the state modifications is introduced in this thesis. As a future goal, the study suggests that the recording and replaying functions be combined into the window system...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{suggests}} that desktop <b>computer-based</b> video <b>conferencing,</b> with high fidelity sound, and group software support, {{is emerging as}} a major communications option. Briefly addressed are the following critical factors that are propelling the <b>computer-based</b> video <b>conferencing</b> revolution: (I) widespread availability of desktop computers interconnected on local area networks; (2) new domestic and international digital communications options and support; (3) integrated groupware and communications protocols for visual and audio communication; and (4) management's readiness to accept video conferencing {{as a way of}} increasing staff productivity. Products and services available for desktop video conferencing are discussed and problems facing the business communicator when planning, developing, and implementing video conferencing systems in business are examined. There is a significant requirement for education and training to make effective use of this new media for business communication. It is concluded that training and planning take on a new role with business video conferencing. Contains 19 references.

40|$|The Audio Mostly Conference {{has since}} its start in 2006 become {{a venue for}} researchers, {{technicians}} and artists exploring audio in interactive and other <b>computer-based</b> environments. The <b>conference</b> themes varied over the years, from the first focus on "Sound in Games" over to "Interaction with Sound", "Sound and Motion", "Sound and Emotion", "Sound and Design", to this year's (2011) theme "Sound and Context". Through its editions, the Audio Mostly Conference series fostered the thoughtfulness for the unexploited potential of audio in computer-based environments and across many contexts. It aimed to help open up this area of thinking by bringing together game designers, audio experts, content creators, and technology and behavioural researchers. Through this forum, varied experts can discuss developments and new potentials for audio in many areas such as entertainment, health and fitness, education, industrial training, serious gaming, etc. This is also a venue to present sonic solutions to development and design challenges in low resolution scenarios or environments where screens are unavailable. The theme for the sixth Audio Mostly Conference covers ways in which sound and music can be utilized {{as a way to}} create context, in physical and virtual environments, and especially as a way to enhance the experience in interactive applications. Sound is both an expression of an environment and a drive for change in that context. The perception of sound as a context carrier emphasizes the interest in exploring the interpretative value of sound and the way it can affect users in context. By realizing the contextualizing potential of sound, researchers and designers can enhance users' experiences and provide richer sense making contexts. Appreciating sound woven into contexts can also foster holistic approaches that benefit overall design coherence...|$|R

Introduction Our research is concerned with network and operating system support for computerbased conferencing using today's networks based on asynchronous communications (e. g., ethernet, token ring, FDDI, T 3, etc.). In this environment, transmission times vary, and hence audio and video data may occasionally arrive at their destination "late. " When data arrives after the time at which it should be displayed, a "gap" appears in the display which affects the user's [...] ...|$|E
40|$|WebCT {{has been}} {{described}} (Goldberg, 1997) as a suite of <b>computer-based</b> <b>conferencing</b> tools that facilitates the creation of sophisticated World Wide Web-based educational environments. The content of a WebCT course is provided in HTML pages designed by the lecturer. WebCT provides interactivity, structure {{and the potential for}} learning to occur. Figure 1 (from Goldberg, 1997) shows a typical association of tools in WebCT; some global and others page-specific. The Homepage is seen to be the centre of most design and user activities. WebCT and ID The developer of WebCT (Goldberg, 1997) has claimed that WebCT tools can be used by course facilitators without technical knowledge to create sophisticated web-based environments. Mann (1998 a) tested this claim with WebCT developers. He found that the lecturers needed more assistance than the tools and help offered in WebCT. Moreover, the lecturers wanted instructional design advice as well as technical help to create their web-based environments. Even those with some course design background discovered that well-known models of instructional design could not sufficiently prescribe web-based learning situations. Researchers seem to agree; familiar models of instructional design are now deemed too static (Boshier et al, 1997) and simply do not describe the necessary conditions of learning for all learner...|$|E
