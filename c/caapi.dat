25|$|Harmala {{alkaloids}} are MAO-inhibiting beta-carbolines. The {{three most}} studied harmala alkaloids in the B. <b>caapi</b> vine are harmine, harmaline and tetrahydroharmine. Harmine and harmaline are selective and reversible inhibitors of monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A), while tetrahydroharmine is a weak serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI).|$|E
2500|$|Traditional {{ayahuasca}} brews {{are usually}} made with Banisteriopsis <b>caapi</b> as an MAOI, although dimethyltryptamine sources and other admixtures vary from region to region. [...] There are several varieties of <b>caapi,</b> often known as different [...] "colors", with varying effects, potencies, and uses.|$|E
2500|$|Ayahuasca ( [...] ; [...] ), or iowaska, or yagé ( [...] or [...] ), is an entheogenic brew {{made out}} of Banisteriopsis <b>caapi</b> vine and other ingredients. The brew {{is used as a}} {{traditional}} spiritual medicine in ceremonies among the Indigenous peoples of the Amazon basin.|$|E
2500|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that some psychoactive effects can be felt from consuming the ayahuasca vine alone. The hallucinogen DMT will be digested in the stomach and remain inactive without the inclusion of a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) such as Banisteriopsis <b>caapi.</b> Therefore, a combination of both a MAOI-containing plant and DMT-containing substance is necessary for full hallucinogenic effects. [...] The resulting brew is known by a number of different names (see below).|$|E
2500|$|Another {{historical}} milestone is {{the discovery}} of DMT in plants frequently used by Amazonian natives as additive to the vine Banisteriopsis <b>caapi</b> to make ayahuasca decoctions. In 1957, American chemists Francis Hochstein and Anita Paradies identified DMT in an [...] "aqueous extract" [...] of leaves of a plant they named Prestonia amazonicum (sic) and described as [...] "commonly mixed" [...] with B. <b>caapi.</b> The lack of a proper botanical identification of Prestonia amazonica in this study led American ethnobotanist Richard Evans Schultes (1915–2001) and other scientists to raise serious doubts about the claimed plant identity. The mistake likely led William Burroughs to regard the DMT he experimented with in Tangier in 1961 as [...] "Prestonia". Better evidence was produced in 1965 by French pharmacologist Jacques Poisson, who isolated DMT as a sole alkaloid from leaves, provided and used by Aguaruna Indians, identified as having come from the vine Diplopterys cabrerana (then known as Banisteriopsis rusbyana). Published in 1970, the first identification of DMT in the plant Psychotria viridis, another common additive of ayahuasca, was made {{by a team of}} American researchers led by pharmacologist Ara der Marderosian. Not only did they detect DMT in leaves of P. viridis obtained from Cashinahua Indians, but they also were the first to identify it in a sample of an ayahuasca decoction, prepared by the same Indians.|$|E
2500|$|Ayahuasca is the hispanicized style {{spelling}} {{of a word}} in the Quechua languages, {{which are}} spoken in the Andean states of Ecuador, Bolivia, Peru, and Colombia. Speakers of Quechua languages or of the Aymara language may prefer the spelling ayawaska. This word refers both to the liana Banisteriopsis <b>caapi,</b> and to the brew prepared from it. In the Quechua languages, aya means [...] "spirit, soul", [...] "corpse, dead body", and waska means [...] "rope" [...] and [...] "woody vine", [...] "liana". The word ayahuasca has been variously translated as [...] "liana of the soul", [...] "liana of the dead", and [...] "spirit liana".|$|E
2500|$|The name [...] "ayahuasca" [...] {{specifically}} {{refers to}} a botanical decoction that contains Banisteriopsis <b>caapi.</b> A synthetic version, known as pharmahuasca, {{is a combination of}} an appropriate MAOI and typically DMT. In this usage, the DMT is generally considered the main psychoactive active ingredient, while the MAOI merely preserves the psychoactivity of orally ingested DMT, which would otherwise be destroyed in the gut before it could be absorbed in the body. In contrast, traditionally among Amazonian tribes, the B.Caapi vine is considered to be the [...] "spirit" [...] of ayahuasca, the gatekeeper, and guide to the otherworldly realms.|$|E
2500|$|Sections of Banisteriopsis <b>caapi</b> vine are {{macerated}} {{and boiled}} {{alone or with}} leaves from any {{of a number of}} other plants, including Psychotria viridis (chacruna) or Diplopterys cabrerana (also known as chaliponga and chacropanga). The resulting brew may contain the powerful psychedelic drug DMT and MAO inhibiting harmala alkaloids, which are necessary to make the DMT orally active. The traditional making of ayahuasca follows a ritual process that requires the user to pick the lower chacruna leaf at sunrise then say a prayer. The vine must be [...] "cleaned meticulously with wooden spoons" [...] and pounded [...] "with wooden mallets until it's fibre." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ayahuasca {{has also}} stirred debate {{regarding}} intellectual property protection of traditional knowledge. In 1986 the US Patent and Trademarks Office allowed {{the granting of}} a patent on the ayahuasca vine B. <b>Caapi.</b> It allowed this patent {{based on the assumption}} that ayahuasca's properties had not been previously described in writing. Several public interest groups, including the Coordinating Body of Indigenous Organizations of the Amazon Basin (COICA) and the Coalition for Amazonian Peoples and Their Environment (Amazon Coalition) objected. In 1999 they brought a legal challenge to this patent which had granted a private US citizen [...] "ownership" [...] of the knowledge of a plant that is well-known and sacred to many indigenous peoples of the Amazon, and used by them in religious and healing ceremonies.|$|E
2500|$|In the 16th century, Christian missionaries from Spain and Portugal first {{encountered}} indigenous South Americans using ayahuasca; their earliest reports {{described it as}} [...] "the work of the devil". [...] In the 20th century, the active chemical constituent of B. <b>caapi</b> was named telepathine, but it {{was found to be}} identical to a chemical already isolated from Peganum harmala and was given the name harmaline. [...] Beat writer William Burroughs read a paper by Richard Evans Schultes on the subject and while traveling through South America in the early 1950s sought out yagé in the hopes that it could relieve or cure opiate addiction (see The Yage Letters). Ayahuasca became more widely known when the McKenna brothers published their experience in the Amazon in True Hallucinations. [...] Dennis McKenna later studied pharmacology, botany, and chemistry of ayahuasca and oo-koo-he, which became the subject of his master's thesis.|$|E
2500|$|DMT {{is broken}} down by the enzyme monoamine oxidase through a process called deamination, and is quickly inactivated orally unless {{combined}} with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI). The traditional South American beverage ayahuasca, or yage, is derived by boiling the ayahuasca vine (Banisteriopsis <b>caapi)</b> with leaves {{of one or more}} plants containing DMT, such as Psychotria viridis, [...] Psychotria carthagenensis, [...] or Diplopterys cabrerana.

A variety of different recipes are used to make the brew depending on the purpose of the ayahuasca session, or local availability of ingredients. Two common sources of DMT in the western US are reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea) and Harding grass (Phalaris aquatica). These invasive grasses contain low levels of DMT and other alkaloids. In addition, Jurema (Mimosa tenuiflora) shows evidence of DMT content: the pink layer in the inner rootbark of this small tree contains a high concentration of N,N-DMT.|$|E
50|$|Some South American tribes {{have been}} {{documented}} to use various bean preparations along with Banisteriopsis <b>caapi,</b> an herb containing MAOIs. Typically Banisteriopsis <b>caapi</b> is chewed in the mouth while the Anadenanthera beans are snuffed or smoked. Occasionally Banisteriopsis <b>caapi</b> is found {{mixed in with the}} snuff. Moderate amounts of Banisteriopsis <b>caapi</b> will effectively double the potency of the Anadenanthera beans. Larger amounts of Banisteriopsis <b>caapi</b> will not only double the potency of Anadenanthera beans but also alter the quality of the experience, producing a more relaxed dreamy effect, with possible increased nausea. There are no well documented reports of the beans being used as a major component in ingestion of ayahuasca, a therapeutic tea made with Banisteriopsis <b>caapi.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to B. <b>caapi,</b> {{at least three}} members of the Malpighiaceae contain harmine, including two more Banisteriopsis species and the plant Callaeum antifebrile. Callaway, Brito and Neves (2005)found harmine levels of 0.31-8.43% in B. <b>caapi</b> samples.|$|E

50|$|P. harmala and B. <b>caapi</b> {{are both}} {{traditionally}} used for their psychoactive effects. B. <b>caapi</b> has {{a tradition of}} use in conjunction with plants containing the drug DMT. Traditionally, B. <b>caapi</b> is consumed as a drink, with or without the DMT-bearing plants (see Ayahuasca). Ordinarily, DMT is not active when taken orally, but users report very different effects when MAOIs are present in such beverages. Harmine and substances containing it have been used in conjunction with many other drugs by modern experimenters. Many hallucinogens appear to exhibit increased potency when used in this way.|$|E
50|$|According to The CRC World Dictionary of Plant Names by Umberto Quattrocchi, {{the naming}} of B. <b>caapi</b> was {{actually}} dedicated to John Banister, a 17th-century English clergyman and naturalist.

5000|$|Banisteriopsis <b>caapi,</b> {{also known}} as ayahuasca, <b>caapi</b> or yagé, is a South American liana of the family Malpighiaceae. It is used to prepare ayahuasca, a {{decoction}} {{with a long history}} of entheogenic uses as a medicine and [...] "plant teacher" [...] among the indigenous peoples of the Amazon Rainforest. It contains harmine, harmaline, and tetrahydroharmine, all of which are both beta-carboline harmala alkaloids and MAOIs. The MAOIs in B. <b>caapi</b> allow the primary psychoactive compound, DMT (which is introduced from the other primary ingredient in ayahausca, the Psychotria viridis plant), to be orally active. The stems contain 0.11-0.83% beta-carbolines, with harmine and tetrahydroharmine as the major components. Alkaloids are present {{in all parts of the}} plant.|$|E

50|$|The <b>caapi</b> vine {{itself was}} the subject of a dispute between U.S. {{entrepreneur}} Loren Miller and the Coordinating Body of Indigenous Organizations of the Amazon Basin (COICA). In 1986, Miller obtained a U.S. patent on a variety of B. <b>caapi.</b> COICA argued the patent was invalid because Miller's variety had been previously described in the University of Michigan Herbarium, and was therefore neither new nor distinct. The patent was overturned in 1999; however, in 2001, the United States Patent Office reinstated the patent because the law at the time the patent was granted did not allow a third party such as COICA standing to object. The Miller patent expired in 2003. B. <b>caapi</b> is now being cultivated commercially in Hawaii.|$|E
