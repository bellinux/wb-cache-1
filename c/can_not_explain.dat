2500|$|From the {{scattered}} references in the Talmud {{it is impossible}} to determine exactly Mar Samuel's proficiency in astronomy; but he knew how to solve many mathematics problems and how to explain many phenomena. He says himself: [...] "Although I am as familiar with the courses of the stars as with the streets of Nehardea, I <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>explain</b> the nature or the movements of the comets" [...] (Ber. 58b). Samuel devoted himself especially to that branch of applied astronomy that deals with calendric science, which he taught to his colleagues and pupils. His astronomical studies of the revolutions of the moon enabled him to predict the beginning of the month ("Rosh Chodesh") as it was determined in Palestine, and he claimed to be able to remove the necessity of celebrating double holy days in the Diaspora (R. H. 20b; comp. Rashi ad loc.). He also computed a Hebrew calendar for sixty years, which he subsequently sent to R. Johanan, the head of the Palestinian teachers, as a proof of his knowledge (Ḥul. 95b). He was called [...] "Yarḥina'ah" [...] or [...] "Yarhinai" [...] ("yeraḥ" [...] = [...] "month") because of this familiarity with calendric science and this ability to determine independently the beginning of the month (B. M. 85b). According to Krochmal ("He-Ḥaluẓ," [...] i. 76), [...] "Shoḳed," [...] another name given to Samuel, means [...] "astronomer" [...] (Yer. Ket. iv. 28b); but Hoffmann's view that [...] "Shoḳed" [...] (for which Babli has [...] "Shaḳud"; Ket. 43b) means [...] "the watchful, diligent one," [...] is more likely correct. This name {{is said to have been}} given to Samuel because, despite his medical and astronomic studies, he devoted himself to the study of the Law.|$|E

60|$|So {{far as my}} {{body was}} {{concerned}} I grew well with great rapidity, though it was long before I got back my strength. Thus I could not walk far or endure any sustained exertion. With my mind it was otherwise. I <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>explain</b> {{what had happened to}} it; indeed I do not know, but in a sense it seemed to have become detached and to have assumed a kind of personality of its own. At times it felt as though it were no longer an inhabitant of the body, but rather its more or less independent partner. I was perfectly clear-headed and of insanity I experienced no symptoms. Yet my mind, I use that term from lack of a better, was not entirely under my control.

Noises irritated me and little things distracted me. I could no longer bend to my desk for five hours in complete absorption. How my wife endured me during those years I <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>explain.</b> The chirp of my babies' voices, the ring of the telephone, the rattle of the garbage cart, the whistle of the postman--each annoyance chopped into my composition, and as my afternoons and evenings had no value in a literary way, I was often completely defeated for the day. Altogether and inevitably my work as a fictionist sank into an unimportant place. I was on the down-grade, that was evident. Writing was a tiresome habit. I was in a rut and longing to get out--to be forced out.|$|E
60|$|It is thus, for example, {{with the}} theory of the tides. No one doubts that Tidology (as Dr. Whewell proposes to call it) is really a science. As much of the {{phenomena}} as depends on the attraction of the sun and moon is completely understood, and may, in any, even unknown, part of the earth’s surface, be foretold with certainty; and the far greater part of the phenomena depends on those causes. But circumstances of a local or casual nature, such as the configuration of the bottom of the ocean, the degree of confinement from shores, the direction of the wind, etc., influence, in many or in all places, the height and time of the tide; and a portion of these circumstances being either not accurately knowable, not precisely measurable, or not capable of being certainly foreseen, the tide in known places commonly varies from the calculated result of general principles by some difference that we <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>explain,</b> and in unknown ones may vary from it by a difference that we are not able to foresee or conjecture. Nevertheless, not only is it certain that these variations depend on causes, and follow their causes by laws of unerring uniformity; not only, therefore, is tidology a science, like meteorology, but it is, what hitherto at least meteorology is not, a science largely available in practice. General laws may be laid down respecting the tides, predictions may be founded on those laws, and the result will in the main, though often not with complete accuracy, correspond to the predictions.|$|E
