40|$|My windows {{hung with}} lace <b>curtains</b> (Valenciennes, Venice, Bruges, Scotland) {{combined}} {{according to the}} formula: = m (m - 1) (m - 2) … (m – n + 1). ” These are the words of Bourgeois, the fictive character in Le Corbusier’s seminal book The Decorative Art of Today (1925). Le Corbusier’s witty attack on <b>curtains</b> was common in the dominant rhetoric of modern architecture in which drapes and <b>curtains</b> were regarded as superficial, fleeting, and effeminate. This paper deals with <b>curtains</b> in domestic interiors, exploring the correlation that exists between the representation and function of the drapery in modern architecture: display, excess and luxury. It does not set out to offer a history of drapes or <b>curtains,</b> but to explore certain aspects {{and the ways in}} which it has been used in domestic interiors of the early twentieth-century. Why do we have <b>curtains?</b> How did they emerge? What roles do they play? What is the difference between <b>curtains</b> and drapes? How can we define “modern curtains”? Why did modern architects prefer built-in <b>curtains?</b> Tracing the different roles that drapes and <b>curtains</b> played in the domestic interiors of the nineteenth and early twentieth-century, I will show that <b>curtains</b> – as opposed to drapes – reappeared, yet in a different role, namely practical, anonymous, impermanent, and unobtrusive...|$|R

40|$|Objective To {{evaluate}} the residual insecticidal {{activity of the}} PermaNet((R)) <b>curtains</b> on Aedes aegypti after 1 year of use in Thai households and to assess the influence of sun and dust exposure, washing practices and detergent use. Methods We sampled UV-protected PermaNet((R)) <b>curtains</b> made of a long-lasting deltamethrin-[55 mg/m(2) ] treated polyester netting, before (10 <b>curtains)</b> and after 8 (10 <b>curtains)</b> and 12 months (66 <b>curtains)</b> of household use in a field site in Chon Buri, Thailand. We assessed the residual insecticidal activity of the <b>curtains</b> by standard WHO bioassay, using a deltamethrin-susceptible insectarium Aedes aegypti strain. Results Mosquito mortality was 100 % before distribution, 100 % at 8 months and 98. 2 % (95 % CI 97. 9 - 98. 5) at 12 months of use. Sunlight, hand-washing and detergent use {{had no effect on}} the residual insecticidal activity after 12 months. However, the mosquito survival rate increased by a factor of 6. 4 (95 % CI 3. 5 - 11. 8) on machine-washed <b>curtains</b> and by a factor of 2. 0 (95 % CI 1. 4 - 2. 9) on <b>curtains</b> not covered by dust.

40|$|Pyrethroid-impregnated bednets and <b>curtains</b> {{are widely}} {{employed}} {{to reduce the}} risk of malaria transmission, but pyrethroid-resistance is becoming more prevalent among malaria vector Anopheles mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae). As an alternative treatment for <b>curtains,</b> we assessed carbosulfan (a carbamate insecticide) in comparison with permethrin as the standard pyrethroid, against endophilic female mosquitoes of the Anopheles gambiae Giles complex in a village near Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. The main criterion evaluated was the impact of <b>curtains</b> (hung inside windows, eaves and doorways) on the number of An. gambiae s. l. females active indoors at night. Light-traps were operated overnight (21. 00 - 06. 00 hours beside occupied untreated bednets) to sample mosquitoes in houses fitted with net <b>curtains</b> treated with carbosulfan 0. 2 g ai/m 2 or permethrin 1 g ai/m 2 or untreated, compared with houses without <b>curtains.</b> The treated and untreated <b>curtains</b> significantly reduced the numbers of mosquitoes collected indoors, compared with houses without <b>curtains.</b> Carbosulfan-treated <b>curtains</b> had a highly significantly greater effect than permethrin-treated or untreated <b>curtains,</b> the scale of the difference being estimated as three-fold. However, there was no significant difference between the impact of untreated and permethrin-treated <b>curtains</b> on densities of An. gambiae s. l. trapped indoors. Samples of the An. gambiae complex comprised An. arabiensis Patton and both the S- and M-forms of An. gambiae Giles s. s. Susceptibility tests revealed some resistance to DDT and low frequencies of permethrin-resistance, insufficient to explain the poor performance of permethrin on <b>curtains.</b> Among survivors from the diagnostic dosage of permethrin were some specimens of all three members of the An. gambiae complex, but the kdr resistance mechanism was detected only in the S-form of An. gambiae s. s. Questions arising for further investigation include clarification of resistance mechanisms in, and foraging behaviour of, each member of the An. gambiae complex in this situation and the need to decide whether carbosulfan-treated <b>curtains</b> are acceptably safe for use to reduce risks of malaria transmission...|$|R
