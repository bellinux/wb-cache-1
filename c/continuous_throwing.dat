By using cylinder-type {{eccentric}} shaft vibration exciter with consistent amplitude vibrator {{mounted on the}} side panel screen box and V-belt driven by a motor which produced centrifugal force, forcing the screen box vibrate. Screen side plate is made of high quality steel plate with bolt or rivets connection on side panels, beams, ring groove and chassis. Furthermore, the vibrators mounted on panel screen box are rotated by the motor through the coupling, provided a centrifugal inertial force to vibrate sieve. The materials on the inclined surface of sieve screen would be impulse by screen box to produce a <b>continuous</b> <b>throwing</b> motion. Thus, as the materials and screen surface encountered the particles of materials which smaller than sieve will through the sieve to achieve classification of materials.|$|E
30|$|The {{streamlines}} {{inside the}} air and water phases for a superficial liquid velocity of 0.10  m/s and superficial gas velocities of 31.77  m/s 18.03  m/s downstream of the liquid inlet section are presented in Fig.  3 a, b, respectively, to show {{the characteristics of the}} flow field. It can be seen that when the amplitude of the forming wave at the liquid inlet section reaches its maximum value, it starts to move upwards. In Fig.  3 a, the liquid phase travels as thin film and it is carried out of the pipe due to the higher gas velocity (31.77  m/s) resulting in an annular flow pattern. The waves in this flow pattern tend to be flatter. All simulated cases that fall within the annular flow regime show that all the liquid film moves upward out of the pipe. As the superficial gas velocity reduces to 18.03  m/s, the drag force imparted on the liquid film becomes insufficient to carry the liquid phase to the pipe exit section while keeping the typical annular flow pattern. As a result, the liquid film thickens, thus producing a circulatory flow region in the liquid phase causing part of the liquid film to move downward near the pipe wall. This is accompanied by the formation of flooding waves that have higher frequencies and tends to cause the <b>continuous</b> <b>throwing</b> of the liquid phase (water) in the region located above the liquid inlet section. In all the simulated cases that fall under the churn flow regime, part of the liquid film flows downwards periodically. This is considered to be the on-set of film reversal and the accompanied gas velocity is called the critical gas velocity.|$|E

5000|$|As the {{original}} album {{was released in}} 1984 on the traditional two-sided vinyl LP and cassette formats, in keeping with Waters' concept {{there are a few}} seconds missing between sides one and two, allowing the listener to flip the record (or turn the cassette), thus keeping the second half starting at exactly 4:50 am as planned. When the album was released on CD a few years later however, this short gap was lost due to <b>continuous</b> play, <b>throwing</b> the time back several seconds. Also, the times for [...] "4:37 am (Arabs With Knives and West German Skies)" [...] and [...] "4:47 am (The Remains of Our Love)" [...] on the first side are incorrect: the songs begin several seconds earlier than indicated, as they start during the seconds of [...] "4:36 AM" [...] and [...] "4:46 AM", respectively.|$|R
