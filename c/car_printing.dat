Sheffield United announced that the Bramall Lane stand at their Bramall Lane stadium would be renamed The Jessica Ennis Stand. Henderson's Relish produced a special limited edition bottle of the condiment with a gold label instead of the usual orange. The label also made use of the company's slogan in relation to Ennis: [...] "Congratulations Jessica – Strong and Northern".|$|R
50|$|Efforts were revived {{during the}} late 1960s and the 1970s. Mirza Mubarak Ahmad, a {{prominent}} Ahmadi Muslim and later Major Abdul Majeed, a retired soldier and a missionary of the Community was sent by the Third Caliph. During this period, missionary activity was centered in Tokyo. From 1975 to 1983, Ataul Mujeeb Rashed served as a missionary in Japan. Methods adopted by Rashed included flier distribution, such as at the Hachiko exit of the Shibuya Station, and preaching over a loudspeaker, whilst driving a <b>car</b> <b>printed</b> with religious slogans. As advised by the caliph, and recommended by Rashed, the headquarters shifted to Nagoya, when a mission house was bought in the city in 1981. In 1989, a Japanese translation of the Quran was published. The Quran was translated by Atsushi Kobayashi, a 1957 convert, who adopted the name, Muhammad Uwais Kobayashi.|$|R

2500|$|Clarkson {{wanted to}} {{purchase}} the Ford GT after admiring its inspiration, the Ford GT40 race cars of the 1960s. Clarkson was able to secure {{a place on the}} shortlist for the few cars that would be imported to Britain to official customers, only through knowing Ford's head of PR through a previous job. After waiting years and facing an increased price, he found many technical problems with the car. After [...] "the most miserable month's motoring possible," [...] he returned it to Ford for a full refund. After a short period, including asking Top Gear fans for advice over the Internet, he bought back his GT. He called it [...] "the most unreliable car ever made", because he was never able to complete a return journey with it. In 2006, Clarkson ordered a Gallardo Spyder and sold the Ford GT to make way for it. In August 2008, he sold the Gallardo because [...] "idiots in Peugeots kept trying to race [...] in it". In October, he announced that he had sold his Volvo XC90. In January 2009, in a review of the <b>car</b> <b>printed</b> in The Times, he wrote: [...] "I’ve just bought my third Volvo XC90 in a row and the simple fact is this: it takes six children to school in the morning." ...|$|R

40|$|For my Honors project, I {{designed}} a <b>car,</b> three <b>print</b> advertisements, and a website focused at college-aged individuals, the target audience. I first did {{research on the}} three themes I planned {{to use in the}} print advertisements: emotion, sex, and humor. During the research, I organized two focus groups of college-aged individuals in order to discover what they wanted in a vehicle. I then reviewed the input from the focus groups and {{designed a}} car that would satisfy the majority of the target audience. After the vehicle was created, I began creating the print advertisements using the three themes mentioned above. Dr. Tom Baird, my advisor, showed the advertisements to his marketing classes in order to find out whether the ads were effective for the intended target audience. The website was created after everything else in order to incorporate the car, advertisements, and sketches in it. Honors CollegeThesis (B. ?. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{multistage}} manufacturing system (MMS) is {{the normal}} paradigm {{used for the}} final assembly of a consumable good, for example a <b>car</b> or <b>printed</b> circuit board. A simple MMS consists normally of a linear sequence of workstations at which components or value is added to a product, this is essentially an assembly line. When planning the production scheduling, normally only workstation repair, failure, and defective pieces are considered as stochastic events that can affect the production rates for the various workstations. Additionally, {{it is assumed that}} all of the raw materials necessary to assemble the finished product are available, and therefore the supply routing problem of raw materials is not considered.

25|$|A plastic {{print is}} a {{friction}} ridge impression {{left in a}} material that retains {{the shape of the}} ridge detail. Although very few criminals would be careless enough to leave their prints in a lump of wet clay, this would make a perfect plastic print.

Such <b>prints</b> are already visible and need no enhancement, but investigators must not overlook the potential that invisible latent prints deposited by accomplices may also be on such surfaces. After photographically recording such prints, attempts should be made to develop other non-plastic impressions deposited from sweat or other contaminants.|$|R

This study aims to identify the arguments used in advertisements; particularly on its claims, warrants and data to influence the automobile buyers in a diverse international market.

A contrastive analysis of three <b>cars</b> ‟ <b>print</b> advertisements, namely Mercedes Benz, BMW and Volkswagen from the German and Malaysian English dailies was carried out using Toulmin‟s model to identify the arguments and the rhetorical devices used in the advertisements.

The BMW and Mercedes Benz focused on their technological superiority and advancements, while the Volkswagen focused on its affordability.
