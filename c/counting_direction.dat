40|$|Even before formal schooling, {{children}} map numbers onto {{space in}} a directional manner. The origin of this preliterate spatial-numerical association is still debated. We investigated the role of enculturation for shaping the directionality of the association between numbers and space, focusing on counting behavior in 3 - 5 -year-old preliterate children. Two studies provide evidence that, after observing reading from storybooks (left-to-right or right-to-left) children change their <b>counting</b> <b>direction</b> {{in line with the}} direction of observed reading. Just observing visuo-spatial directional movements had no such effect on <b>counting</b> <b>direction.</b> Complementarily, we document that book illustrations, prevalent in children’s cultures, exhibit directionality that conforms to the direction of a culture’s written language. We propose that shared book reading activates spatio-temporal representations of order in young children which in turn affect their spatial representation of numbers...|$|E
40|$|The {{theory and}} {{practice}} of up-only (or downonly) prescaled counters is well understood both in industry and in the academia. Until recently it was not known if the design of a fast and large up/down binary counters would be possible. This paper presents the theory and practical application of the concept in the design of a 64 -bit up/down binary counter for LUT FPGAs. The designs were implemented in Xilinx XC 4000 and Atmel AT 6000. The counter has a cycle time independent of the counter size. The main difference between the up-only (or down-only) counter and the up/down counter is the mechanism to obtain the next state when the <b>counting</b> <b>direction</b> changes. The counter does not have enough time to recompute the state that was valid in the previous state transition. To solve the problem, an extra register is used to store the previous state of the counter in each state transition. When the <b>counting</b> <b>direction</b> changes, the contests of the register is used as the next state. Experimental resul [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{research}} suggests that block adding, subtracting and <b>counting</b> <b>direction</b> are early forms of number-space mapping. In this study, an embodiment perspective on these skills was taken. Embodiment theory assumes that cognition emerges through sensory-motor interaction with the environment. In line with this assumption, it was investigated if counting and adding/subtracting direction in young children {{is related to the}} hand they use during task performance. Forty-eight 3. 5 -year-old children completed a block adding, subtracting and counting task. They had to add and remove a block from a row of three blocks and count a row of five blocks. Adding, subtracting and <b>counting</b> <b>direction</b> were related to the hand the children used for task performance. Most children who used their right hand added, removed and started counting the blocks at {{the right side of the}} row. Most children who used their left hand added, removed and started counting the blocks at the left side of the row. It can be concluded that number-space mapping, as measured by direction of adding, subtracting and counting blocks, in young children is embodied: It is not fixed, but is related to the situation...|$|E

The field inside the magnet had essentially-parallel lines of force, parallel to the axis of the tube. It was a thermionic vacuum tube; inside were a central cathode, ten anodes, and ten [...] "spade" [...] electrodes. The magnetic field and voltages applied to the electrodes made the electrons form a thick sheet (as in a cavity magnetron) that went to only one anode. Applying a pulse with specified width and voltages to the spades made the sheet advance to the next anode, where it stayed until the next advance pulse. <b>Count</b> <b>direction</b> was not reversible.

40|$|A {{structural}} {{representation of}} the hand embedding information about the identity and relative position of fingers is necessary to counting routines. It may also support associations between numbers and allocentric spatial codes that predictably interact with other known numerical spatial representations, such as the mental number line (MNL). In this study, 48 Western participants whose typical counting routine proceeded from thumb-to-little on both hands performed magnitude and parity binary judgments. Response keys were pressed either with the right index and middle fingers or with the left index and middle fingers in separate blocks. 24 participants responded with either hands in prone posture (i. e., palm down) and 24 participants responded with either hands in supine (i. e., palm up) posture. When hands were in prone posture, the <b>counting</b> <b>direction</b> of the left hand conflicted with {{the direction of the}} left–right MNL, whereas the <b>counting</b> <b>direction</b> of the right hand was consistent with it.

40|$|Previous {{work has}} {{suggested}} that an important tool of adult numeric competence is a “mental number line ” that codes increasing numeric magnitudes spatially and with a directional bias. Partly because the direction of this bias (left-to-right versus right-to-left) is culture-specific, it has been assumed that a directionally-biased mental number line is a late development. Our results, in contrast, suggest that {{nearly half of all}} preschoolers possess a directional magnitude bias and that those who possess this bias demonstrate competence in representing large numbers, a competence that is otherwise lacking in same-aged peers.

40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this study}} is to examine if there is a {{relation}} between number-space mapping and visual-spatial working memory and selective attention. The following tasks are completed to investigate these three aspects: The Counting Task, the Six Boxes Task and the Visual Search Task. Independent-sample t-tests and One-way-Analyses of Variance showed no relation between number-space mapping and visual-spatial working memory, except a positive relation between the <b>counting</b> <b>direction</b> and visual-spatial working memory. Visual-spatial working memory is better developed in children counting from left to right than in children counting from right to left. Besides that, a relation between number-space mapping and selective attention is found. Selective attention is better developed in children without signals of number-space mapping at adding and subtracting than in children with these signals. Following research has to be focused on explicit number-space mapping to get a complete vision of the relation between number-space mapping and visual-spatial working memory...|$|E

40|$|The {{spontaneous}} use of finger counting {{has been}} for long recognised as critical to the acquisition of number skills. Recently, the great interest on space-number associations shifted attention {{to the practice of}} finger counting itself, and specifically, to its spatial components. Besides general cross-cultural differences in mapping numbers onto fingers, contrasting results have been reported with regard to the directional features of this mapping. The key issue we address is to what extent directionality is culturally-mediated, i. e., linked to the conventional reading-writing system direction, and/or biologically determined, i. e. linked to hand dominance. Although the preferred starting hand for counting seems to depend on the surveyed population, even within the same population high inter-individual variability minimises the role of cultural factors. Even if so far largely overlooked, handedness represents a sound candidate for shaping finger <b>counting</b> <b>direction.</b> Here we discuss adults and developmental evidence in support of this view and we reconsider the plausibility of multiple and coexistent number-space mapping in physical and representational space...|$|E
30|$|Similar to the {{previous}} schemes, a CORDIC core is used to compute the instantaneous magnitude and phase of the signal. The ‘Peak Detect’ block, which contains some registers and comparators, outputs a ‘ 1 ’ when a magnitude peak is found, {{as shown in the}} second plot in Figure 12. The output of the ‘Peak Detect’ block is connected to the enable ports of the two latches which store the magnitude and phase of the corresponding peak. The ‘Interval Locator’ block generates a ‘ 1 ’ in the middle of two peaks when the interval of these peaks is less than the cancelling-pulse length. The outputs of ‘Interval Locator’ and ‘Peak Detect’ (I) and (II) are combined with an OR gate. A ‘Delay’ block is used to align these two signals as the ‘Interval Locator’ has a fixed delay. The ‘Cancelling Pulse Duration” block produces enable signal (III) for the counter which outputs the address of the ROM. The <b>counting</b> <b>direction</b> of the counter is controlled by a latch output which is reversed when triggered by the output of the OR gate. Operation of these signals can be easily seen from the second and third plots in Figure 12.|$|E

Aim: This study has investigated the group-difference in the dynamic features during sketching of spiral between PD and control subjects {{with the aim of}} developing an accurate method for diagnosing PD patients. Method: Dynamic handwriting features were computed for 206 specimens collected from 62 Subjects (31 Parkinson&# 039;s and 31 Controls). These were analyzed based on the severity of the disease to determine group-difference. Spearman rank correlation coefficient was computed to evaluate the strength of association for the different features.

40|$|Graduation date: 1989 Twenty-four woven Pre-Columbian {{textiles}} in the Apparel, Interiors and Merchandising Department (AIM) of Oregon State University {{were reported}} to be from Ancon, Peru. A methodology was developed to confirm the exact provenance of the AIM textiles. Technical fabrication characteristics were utilized to describe certain known Ancon woven textiles and to analyze the twenty-four AIM textiles; then comparisons were attempted {{between the two groups}} to determine if internal patterns for each were identical. A literature and collection survey identified ten documented reports of known Ancon woven textiles. The previously recorded information of the known Ancon pieces was summarized. Technical fabrication characteristics for each AIM textile were observed and recorded. The technical fabrication characteristics included weave structure, thread <b>count,</b> fiber content, <b>direction</b> of spin, ply, degree of twist, yarn diameter, color and motif. Frequencies and especially developed analysis tools were utilized to identify internal patterns. Hypothesis 1 stated that information about the technical fabrication elements of Ancon woven textiles in certain other collections can be organized into integrated patterns. Hypothesis 1 was not supported because data recorded on Ancon woven textiles was incomplete, and therefore only able to give limited frequencies. Hypothesis 2 was supported: The twenty-four woven Pre-Columbian textiles from the Costume and Textile Collection of the Apparel, Interiors and Merchandising Department of Oregon State University will have similar patterns in technical fabrication elements. An analysis tool was developed to show patterns within technical fabrication elements. Thread <b>count,</b> <b>direction</b> of spin, ply, and degree of twist exhibited internal patterns. Hypothesis 3 stated that the provenance of twenty-four woven Pre-Columbian textiles, from the Costume and Textile Collection of the Apparel, Interiors and Merchandising Department of Oregon State University is Ancon, Peru. This hypothesis could not be tested because technical fabrication patterns for the known Ancon weavings were not complete and could not be statistically analyzed. Even though the two sets of data populations (data from known Ancon textiles and data from the AIM collection) could not be compared statistically, some information was gained by a review and comparison of simple frequencies of internal patterns.
