40|$|A <b>captive</b> is an <b>insurance</b> or {{reinsurance}} company established by a parent group to finance its own risks. Captives mix internal risk pooling between the business {{units of the}} parent group and risk transfer toward the reinsurance market. We analyze captives from an optimal insurance contract perspective. The paper considers the vertical contractual chain that links firstly business units to <b>insurance</b> <b>captives</b> or to "fronters" through insurance contracts, secondly fronters to reinsurance captives through the cession of risks and thirdly <b>insurance</b> or reinsurance <b>captives</b> to reinsurers through cessions or retrocessions. In particular, the risk cession by fronters to a reinsurance captive trades o¤ the benefits derived from recouped premiums and from the risk sharing advantage of an "umbrella reinsurance policy", against the risks that result from the captive liabilities. The optimal captive scheme depends {{on the price of}} coverage in insurance and reinsurance markets and on the parent group's corporate capital. Since these variables fluctuate across time, the analysis developed in this paper corroborates the intertemporal variability of captives activity. self-insurance, captive, reinsurance, risk management...|$|R

While these profits financed an array of generous benefits for the rank-and-file, a thriving balance sheet also increasingly engendered corruption among union leaders.

40|$|This article {{introduces}} {{subject of}} an <b>insurance</b> <b>captive</b> entity, with focus on {{how it could be}} used as insurance formula for risk management. Captive might be the most appropriate insurance formula for risk management. However, the level of achieved success depends on many factors. Insurance captivesare understood as entities which are formed and owned by companies mostly for the purpose of insuring own risks (pure captive or single parent captive). More and more often captives are also formed by a group of companies (group captives) to insure their properties and liabilities towards 3 rd parties. Captives are widely used by many companies nowadays. However, many of them,are used solely for a purpose of a risk cession and premium transfer, with an intention to use captivesmore as a profit center in a low taxation country rather than for the purpose of risk management (i. e. a more appropriate role for captive would be to support their owners in enterprise risk management - ERM). This article touches on why captives are not used to their full potential. It may be toochallenging for many decision makers to embrace on captives as risk management formula and extend captives' roles to utilize all possible advantages resulting from owning a captive. Captive can deliver risk management in a more comprehensive way than most commercial insurers on the market.
