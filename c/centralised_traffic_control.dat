INTRODUCTION In a developed prototype for urban <b>traffic</b> <b>control,</b> the IUTCS, we have researched the possibilities for supporting real time <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> more efficiently by applying techniques {{from the field of}} Artificial Intelligence. The prototype attack the <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> problem of urban areas, and more specifically, dynamically <b>controlled</b> <b>traffic</b> flow by means of <b>controlling</b> <b>traffic</b> lights. The prototype {{has been described as a}} whole on several other occasions ([Irgens 90 - 1], [Ambrosino 91], [Irgens 90 - 2]). This presentation will therefore concentrate on the novel architecture for <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> embedded in the prototype, and the mechanisms for signal plan selection. The latter discussing how traffic engineer empirics may improve an otherwise exponential time algorithm for coordinating signal plan settings in a larger area. For the purpose of completeness, other aspects of the prototype will also receive some attention. 2. THE PROBLEM The two basic ways of <b>controlling</b> <b>traffic</b> by <b>controlling</b> <b>traffic</b> lights are signal plan modification, and signal plan selection, where the former changes the signal plans dynamically according to the traffic in one junction (or a small area), and the latter chooses the best out of a predefi [...] ...|$|R
25|$|Six {{signalling}} {{systems are}} used in New Zealand: automatic signalling rules (ASR), double line automatic (DLA), single line automatic (SLA), <b>centralised</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> (CTC), track warrant control (TWC), and station limits. Signals are of the colour light type and operate on speed signalling principals, i.e. signals tell the driver what speed they should proceed, but not necessarily the route they will take. The Auckland suburban network is also equipped with European Train Control System (ETCS) Level 1 signalling and train protection.|$|E
25|$|In 1955, {{with the}} opening of the Rimutaka Tunnel and deviation, a <b>Centralised</b> <b>Traffic</b> <b>Control</b> system was {{installed}} at Upper Hutt station to control main line points and signals between Trentham and Featherston inclusive. However, only one crossover (18) and four signals (8, 23, 23A and 29) at Trentham could be controlled from Upper Hutt; the remainder, which were typically only used on race days at the adjacent Trentham Racecourse, were controlled by a panel at Trentham itself. The semaphore signals were replaced with three-colour searchlight signals. On 6 February 2007, the Upper Hutt signal box was decommissioned and control of the line from Trentham to Featherston was moved to Train Control in central Wellington.|$|E

40|$|Original {{scientific}} paper This paper {{presents a}} new optimisation method for energy-efficient operation of electric commuter trains. This method assumes {{the application of}} <b>centralised</b> train and <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> with online timetable rescheduling. The method was tested on the interstation distance between Maksimir and Zagreb GK on the Dugo Selo- Zagreb GK railway line. For all potential running times of commuter trains, by usage of SQP-method for the calculation of traction power supply, different running regimes were simulated and best regimes regarding energy consumption were selected. Each regime implies a running time which can deviate up to 20 seconds from the nominal one given by the timetable and this represents a completely new way of defining the energy-optimal running regimes. The results of the simulation show that the new method for energy-optimal commuter trains running profile calculation can sav...|$|R
40|$|In The Netherlands, dynamic traffic {{management}} {{is an important}} approach to minimise {{the negative effects of}} increasing congestion. Measures such as ramp metering and route infor-mation, but also conventional <b>traffic</b> signal <b>control,</b> are used for this. Traditionally, the focus in designing <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> plans has been on local control. There is however a tendency to come to a more <b>centralised</b> way of <b>traffic</b> <b>control.</b> For a <b>centralised</b> approach the interaction with route choice behaviour and other {{traffic management}} measures becomes an important aspect in the design of control strategies. The research described in the thesis shows that integrated anticipatory control can contribute to a better use of the infrastructure in relation with policy objectives. Integrated control means that the network is considered to be one multi-level network, consisting of motorways and urban roads. Anticipatory control means taking into account not only the current, but also fu-ture traffic conditions in relation with route choice behaviour. A framework was developed, which can be used to design and evaluate traffic management strategies. With the use of the framework it was shown for some simple networks that anticipatory control leads to less de-lay, also if more than one road authority is involved. The framework {{can be used as a}} next step towards real network traffic management. Trai...|$|R
