The method locates the controllable part p of the pressure difference across the free surface. It consists in a set of calculus, which leads to the determination of the melt column height (between the horizontal crucible melt level and the shaper top level) in function of the pressure of the gas flow (introduced in the furnace for release the heat) in order to obtain the desired meniscus. The procedure is presented in general and is numerically illustrated for InSb tubes. The novelty is the algorithm for the exact determination of p, which has to be used, the determination of the melt column height, and the evaluation of the effect of shaper radii.

40|$|To {{be part of}} the {{competition}} of becoming the major energy storage choice in the future, the hydrogen storage materials need to be optimized in several ways. One of the problems we have to overcome {{is the fact that the}} materials known today are either too stable or too unstable for mobile energy storage applications. We investigate the substitution of anions into known hydrogen storage materials in order to change the stability. These anions can be flour (rion = 1. 33 Å) substituting for hydrogen (rion = 1. 3 Å) and chloride (rion = 1. 81 Å), bromide (rion = 1. 96 Å) or iodide (rion = 2. 20 Å) substituting for BH 4 ˉ (rion = 2. 03 Å) because of the similar sizes in radius [1]. The small difference in radius may cause a lowering or an increase of the stability depending on the material we are examining. With this strategy, we hope to change the enthalpy of the material to be in the desired range of- 20 to- 30 kJ/(mol H 2). By means of in situ synchrotron radiation powder X-ray diffraction (SR-PXD), the substitution of Cl ˉ into the structure of Ca(BH 4) 2 was investigated by adding CaCl 2 to a sample of Ca(BH 4) 2 (1 : 0. 5) and mechanically mixing by ballmilling for 2 hours effectively. In situ time-resolved SR-PXD data was measured at the MAXII synchrotron beamline I 711 at MAX-lab, Lund, Sweeden (= 1. 09801 Å) with a MAR 165 CCD detector system [2].

5000|$|In 1905-08, the Australian-born {{engineer}} Elfric Wells Chalmers Kearney {{put forward}} a plan to build two <b>tube</b> lines from <b>Crystal</b> Palace to Strand and Cricklewood, known variously as the Cricklewood & Oval and Strand & <b>Crystal</b> Palace <b>Tube</b> Railways, the Kearney High-Speed Tubes or the Kearney High-Speed Railway. The scheme was promoted by the Kearney High-Speed Tube Railway Company Ltd. and proposed {{the construction of an}} underground railway operated on an unusual monorail system patented by Kearney. Trains would run on a single rail with four double-flanged wheels under each carriage; wheels mounted on the roof would run along an upper guide rail above the train. The trains, which were to be designed in a streamlined style similar to the London Underground 1935 Stock, would have a low centre of gravity, which, along with the gyroscopic effect of motion, would stabilise the train on the lower rail and reduce the side-to-side hunting oscillation. The stations were to be located just below the surface, connected by deep-level tube tunnels which would drop down steeply from each station; it was intended that the 1 in 7 track incline would enhance acceleration and deceleration between stations with the effects of gravity, with trains reaching 60 mph before decelerating.
