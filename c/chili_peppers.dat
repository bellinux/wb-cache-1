5|$|At {{the age of}} eighteen, {{he joined}} the Red Hot <b>Chili</b> <b>Peppers,</b> first {{appearing}} on the band's 1989 album, Mother's Milk. The group's follow-up album, Blood Sugar Sex Magik (1991), was a breakthrough success. Frusciante became overwhelmed by the band's new popularity and quit in 1992. He became a recluse and entered {{a long period of}} drug addiction, during which he released his first solo recordings: Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt (1994) and Smile from the Streets You Hold (1997). In 1998, he successfully completed drug rehabilitation and rejoined the Red Hot <b>Chili</b> <b>Peppers.</b> Their next album, Californication (1999) would eventually go on to sell 16 million copies. His album To Record Only Water for Ten Days was released in 2001. A fourth album with the <b>Chili</b> <b>Peppers,</b> By the Way was released in 2002. On a creative spree, Frusciante released six solo albums in 2004; each album explored different recording techniques and genres. 2006 saw the release of his fifth and final album with the <b>Chili</b> <b>Peppers,</b> Stadium Arcadium. In 2009, Frusciante released The Empyrean, which features Flea and Josh Klinghoffer, and announced he had again parted ways with the <b>Chili</b> <b>Peppers.</b>|$|E

40|$|The colored <b>chili</b> <b>pepper</b> (Capsicum annum L.) is {{native to}} Central and South America, and belongs to Solanaceae family and Capsicum genus. Colored <b>chili</b> <b>pepper</b> is unique in the colors {{transition}} from pale green, purple, orange, to red within 15 to 20 days. Our studies indicated that the colors transition of the <b>chili</b> <b>pepper</b> fruits was probably {{not related to the}} pH of fruit sap. The results of the measurements of total anthocyanins and carotenoids contents, and the expression of psy and lcy-b genes indicated that a dramatic shit from anthocyanins metabolism to carotenoids biosynthesis occurred during the purple color transformed into orange color of <b>chili</b> <b>pepper</b> fruit. Changes in the profiles of protein synthesis and the populations of translatable mRNA of <b>chili</b> <b>pepper</b> fruits were also found during colors transition. Our results reveal that the regulation of genes expression was involved during colors transition of <b>chili</b> <b>pepper</b> fruits. 本研究觀察到'PBCl 328 '品系之彩色辣椒其果實轉色之順序為淡白綠色、紫色、橙色、紅色，約在 15 ~ 20 天內完成，並發現該轉色與細胞液之pH值因素無關。分析總花青素及總類胡蘿蔔素含量，及psy與lcy-b(類胡蘿蔔合成相關酵素) 等基因的表現結果顯示在彩色辣椒果實轉色過程中有明顯的花青素合成先增加再減少而按著類胡籮蔔素被誘導大量合成的現象。此種轉變在in vivo放射性蛋白質標記及in vitro translation 的分析都可顯示彩色辣椒果實轉色過程中與合成新蛋白質或/且降解有關，且轉色的過程也牽涉到mRNA層次的調控...|$|R
5|$|Red Hot <b>Chili</b> <b>Peppers</b> is an American funk {{rock band}} formed in Los Angeles, California, in 1983. The band {{was formed by}} vocalist Anthony Kiedis, guitarist Hillel Slovak, bassist Flea, and drummer Jack Irons after they met while {{attending}} Fairfax High School. Since its inception, Red Hot <b>Chili</b> <b>Peppers</b> has maintained a four-member lineup, with fourteen official members overall.|$|E

40|$|Fruits of <b>chili</b> <b>pepper</b> as {{crossing}} population between C 15 and C 2 genotype {{were used}} to study genetic parameter of resistance for anthracnose disease caused by Colletotrichum acutatum. Twenty mature green <b>chili</b> <b>pepper</b> fruits from each plant were inoculated by C. acutatum PYK 04 isolate. The results showed that resistance to anthracnose in <b>chili</b> <b>pepper</b> was controlled by recessive gene. Broad-sence heritability were high for both disease incidence and necrotic diameter. Narrow-sence heritability were high for stem diameter and low for necrotic diameter. Additive-variance ratio were high for disease incidence and medium for necrotic diameter. Development of resistance varieties of <b>chili</b> <b>pepper</b> to anthracnose should be subjected to line varieties. </p...|$|R

5|$|The discography of John Frusciante, who is {{best known}} as the former guitarist of the rock band Red Hot <b>Chili</b> <b>Peppers,</b> {{consists}} of eleven solo albums and four EPs, as well as two albums with collaborators Joe Lally and Josh Klinghoffer under the name Ataxia and one EP and one album under the alias of Trickfinger. After recording Mother's Milk and Blood Sugar Sex Magik, Frusciante left the Red Hot <b>Chili</b> <b>Peppers</b> in 1992 when he got tired of the growing success of the band. He released his first solo album, Niandra LaDes and Usually Just a T-Shirt, in 1994 on American Recordings. His second record, Smile From the Streets You Hold, was released in 1997 and later taken off the market at his request in 1999. After returning to the Red Hot <b>Chili</b> <b>Peppers</b> in 1998, Frusciante recorded Californication with the band and subsequently released his third solo album, To Record Only Water for Ten Days, in February 2001 on Warner Music Group.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background There is no {{dedicated}} database {{available for}} Expressed Sequence Tags (EST) of the <b>chili</b> <b>pepper</b> (Capsicum annuum), although {{the interest in}} a <b>chili</b> <b>pepper</b> EST database is increasing internationally due to the nutritional, economic, and pharmaceutical value of the plant. Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing of the ESTs of <b>chili</b> <b>pepper</b> cv. Bukang have produced {{hundreds of thousands of}} complementary DNA (cDNA) sequences. Therefore, a <b>chili</b> <b>pepper</b> EST database was designed and constructed to enable comprehensive analysis of <b>chili</b> <b>pepper</b> gene expression in response to biotic and abiotic stresses. Results We built the Pepper EST database to mine the complexity of <b>chili</b> <b>pepper</b> ESTs. The database was built on 122, 582 sequenced ESTs and 116, 412 refined ESTs from 21 pepper EST libraries. The ESTs were clustered and assembled into virtual consensus cDNAs and the cDNAs were assigned to metabolic pathway, Gene Ontology (GO), and MIPS Functional Catalogue (FunCat). The Pepper EST database is designed to provide a workbench for (i) identifying unigenes in pepper plants, (ii) analyzing expression patterns in different developmental tissues and under conditions of stress, and (iii) comparing the ESTs with those of other members of the Solanaceae family. The Pepper EST database is freely available at [URL]. Conclusion The Pepper EST database is expected to provide a high-quality resource, which will contribute to gaining a systemic understanding of plant diseases and facilitate genetics-based population studies. The database is also expected to contribute to analysis of gene synteny as part of the <b>chili</b> <b>pepper</b> sequencing project by mapping ESTs to the genome. </p...|$|R

5|$|Following a {{life-threatening}} drug addiction that developed {{after leaving the}} <b>Chili</b> <b>Peppers</b> in 1992, Frusciante made a full recovery after a month of drug rehabilitation during {{the early months of}} 1998. Shortly thereafter he was asked to rejoin the Red Hot <b>Chili</b> <b>Peppers.</b> After several months of writing and recording, the Chili Peppers' next album, Californication was released. The album went on to sell more than 15 million copies worldwide, becoming the Chili Peppers' most successful recording to date. Frusciante's return generated much response from critics, who recognized the album as a commercial revitalization from their previous record, One Hot Minute. A two-year-long, international tour followed, which included several festival appearances, including Woodstock 1999 and Rock in Rio.|$|E
5|$|Frusciante, Kiedis, and Flea {{each had}} their own {{separate}} rooms {{at each end of}} the house. When not recording with the band, Frusciante would spend his time painting, listening to music, reading and recording songs he'd written. Due to the seclusion, Kiedis ended up recording all his vocals in his room, as it was large enough to accommodate the recording equipment. For over thirty days, the <b>Chili</b> <b>Peppers</b> worked inside the house; Kiedis felt it was an accommodating and resourceful environment which allowed him to complete the rest of the lyrics. During production, the band agreed to let Flea's brother-in-law document the creative process on film. When the album's recording was complete, the <b>Chili</b> <b>Peppers</b> released the film, titled Funky Monks.|$|E
