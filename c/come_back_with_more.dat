The prey species of the Atlantic puffin include the sandeel, herring and capelin.

This behaviour is made possible by the unique hinging mechanism of their beak, which allows the upper and lower biting edges to meet at any of a number of angles.|$|E

5000|$|The title {{sequence}} uses closeups of {{the letters}} in the Stranger Things title with a red tint against a black background as they slide into place within the title. The sequence {{was created by the}} studio Imaginary Forces, formerly part of R/GA, led by creative director Michelle Doughtey. Levy introduced the studio to the Duffer Brothers, who explained their vision of the 1980s-inspired show, which helped the studio to fix the concept the producers wanted. Later, but prior to filming, the producers sent Imaginary Forces the pilot script, the synth-heavy background music for the titles, as well as the various book covers from King and other authors that they had used to establish the title and imagery, and were looking for a similar approach for the show's titles, primarily using a typographical sequence. They took inspiration from several title sequences of works from the 1980s that were previously designed by Richard Greenberg under R/GA, such as Altered States and The Dead Zone. They also got input from Dan Perri, who worked on the title credits of several 1980s films. Various iterations included having letters vanish, to reflect the [...] "missing" [...] theme of the show, and having letters cast shadows on others, alluding to the mysteries, before settling into the sliding letters. The studio began working on the title sequence before filming, and took about a month off during the filming process to let the producers get immersed in the show and <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>more</b> input. Initially they had been working with various fonts for the title and used close-ups of the best features of these fonts, but near the end the producers wanted to work with ITC Benguiat, requiring them to rework those shots. The final sequence is fully computer generated, but they took inspiration from testing some practical effects, such as using Kodalith masks as would have been done in the 1980s, to develop the appropriate filters for the rendering software. The individual episode title cards used a [...] "fly through" [...] approach, similar to the film Bullitt, which the producers had suggested to the studio.|$|E

Cleitus had captured and garrisoned the city of Pelion and waited for Glaucias' troops to arrive. However, Alexander arrived on the scene first and blockaded Cleitus within the city walls. Glaucias came to Cleitus' aid, and the Macedonians were forced to retreat.

50|$|Bol {{was very}} active in {{charitable}} causes throughout his career. In fact, he said {{he spent much of}} the money he made during a 10-year NBA career supporting various causes related to the war-ravaged nation of his birth, Sudan. He frequently visited Sudanese refugee camps, where he was treated like royalty. In 2001 Bol was offered a post as minister of sport by the Sudanese government. Bol, who was a Christian, refused because one of the conditions was converting to Islam. Later Bol was hindered from leaving the country by the Sudanese government, who accused him of supporting the Dinka-led Christian rebels, the Sudan People's Liberation Army. The Sudanese government refused to grant him an exit visa unless he <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>more</b> money. Assistance by supporters in the United States, including Connecticut Senator Joseph Lieberman, raised money to provide Bol with plane tickets to Cairo, Egypt. After 6 months of negotiations with U.S. consulate officials regarding refugee status, Bol and his family were finally able to leave Egypt and return to the United States.|$|R

They were even married in a San Diego County park, on mountain bikes. Schulze and Mooney were {{in the early stages of}} a fantastic and improbable project back then. They wanted to travel the world in search of the best mountain-biking trails. They would, of course, film their odyssey and turn it into a documentary. It took three years, a quarter-million dollars and 75 hours of Betacam SP tape footage -- but they completed their quest... Schulze and Mooney <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>more</b> than spectacular scenery, of which there is an abundance here. They manage, too, to convey the joy they experience in getting out on two wheels on an open trail. Theyve created an Endless Summer for the mountain-biking crowd.|$|R

50|$|The {{first day}} of the 2009 Commonwealth Bank Tournament of Champions, started with Group D, with German Sabine Lisicki taking on Aravane Rezaï. The first set was a {{complete}} domination by the German, breaking in the second and sixth games to win the first set. The German also only lost 3 points on serve and did not face a single break point. In the second set Rezaï called for her coach and after that <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>more</b> confidence, and started playing more aggressively in the second set. Her forehand winners and unforced errors from Lisicki helped Rezaï jump out to a 3-0 lead and hold on serve to level the match. A moment of controversy turned the third set. The players traded breaks in the first four games before Rezaï broke again and held to lead 4-3. Lisicki looked distressed late in the set when she insisted a Rezaï shot down the line was out. Hawk-Eye showed otherwise, and Rezaï took a 5-3 lead and won the match 6-4 in the third. Rezaï saved 7 of 8 break points on the deciding set. The German did not hide her unhappiness after the match. Rezaï commented after the match that she found it strange that there was no doubles line.|$|R

Like Mooween, {{his knowledge of the}} woods is wide and accurate. He knows--partly by searching them out, and partly from his mother, who takes him and shows him where they are--every den and hollow tree that will shelter a coon in times of trouble. He has always one den near a corn-field, where he can sleep when too full or too lazy to travel; he has one dry tree for stormy weather, and one cool mossy shell in deep shadow for the hot summer days. He has at least one sunny nook in the top of a hollow stub, where he loves to lie and soak in the fall sunshine; and one favorite giant tree with the deepest and warmest hollow, which he invariably uses for his long winter sleep. And besides all these he has at least one tower of refuge near every path of his, to which he can betake himself when sudden danger threatens from dogs or men.|$|R

In retaliation, Edmund reminds his mother that her own father died of tuberculosis, and then, before exiting, he adds {{how difficult it is to}} have a [...] "dope fiend for a mother." [...] By herself, Mary admits that she needs more morphine and hopes that someday she will “accidentally” overdose, because she knows that if she did so on purpose, the Virgin would never forgive her. When James <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>more</b> alcohol he notes that there was evidence that Jamie had attempted to pick the locks to the whiskey cabinet in the cellar, as he has done before.

When James attempts to console her, Mary again rues having given birth to Edmund, who appears to have been conceived to replace a baby they had lost before Edmund’s birth. When Cathleen announces dinner, Mary indicates that she is not hungry and is going to bed. James goes in to dinner all alone, knowing that Mary is really going upstairs to get more drugs.|$|R
