5|$|Bromine pentafluoride (BrF5) {{was first}} {{synthesised}} in 1930. It is produced {{on a large}} scale by direct reaction of bromine with excess fluorine at temperatures higher than 150°C, and on a small scale by the fluorination of potassium bromide at 25°C. It is a very vigorous fluorinating agent, although <b>chlorine</b> <b>trifluoride</b> is still more violent. Bromine pentafluoride explodes on reaction with water and fluorinates silicates at 450°C.|$|E
5|$|Chalcogens have diverse fluorides: {{unstable}} difluorides {{have been}} reported for oxygen (the only known compound with oxygen in an oxidation state of +2), sulfur, and selenium; tetrafluorides and hexafluorides exist for sulfur, selenium, and tellurium. The latter are stabilized by more fluorine atoms and lighter central atoms, so sulfur hexafluoride is especially inert. Chlorine, bromine, and iodine can each form mono-, tri-, and pentafluorides, but only iodine heptafluoride has been characterized among possible interhalogen heptafluorides. Many of them are powerful sources of fluorine atoms, and industrial applications using <b>chlorine</b> <b>trifluoride</b> require precautions similar to those using fluorine.|$|E
25|$|Sodium {{molybdate}} {{is incompatible}} with alkali metals, most common metals and oxidizing agents. It will explode on contact with molten magnesium. It will violently react with interhalogens (e.g., bromine pentafluoride; <b>chlorine</b> <b>trifluoride).</b> Its reaction with hot sodium, potassium or lithium is incandescent.|$|E
25|$|Large-scale {{productions}} of elemental fluorine began during World War II. Germany used high-temperature electrolysis to produce tons of <b>chlorine</b> <b>trifluoride,</b> a compound {{planned to be}} used as an incendiary. The Manhattan project in the United States produced even more fluorine for use in uranium separation. Gaseous uranium hexafluoride was used to separate uranium-235, an important nuclear explosive, from the heavier uranium-238 in diffusion plants. Because uranium hexafluoride releases small quantities of corrosive fluorine, the separation plants were built with special materials. All pipes were coated with nickel; joints and flexible parts were fabricated from Teflon.|$|E

500|$|Chlorine pentafluoride (ClF5) is {{made on a}} {{large scale}} by direct {{fluorination}} of chlorine with excess fluorine gas at 350°C and 250atm, and on a small scale by reacting metal chlorides with fluorine gas at 100–300°C. It melts at −103°C and boils at −13.1°C. It is a very strong fluorinating agent, although it is still not as effective as <b>chlorine</b> <b>trifluoride.</b> Only a few specific stoichiometric reactions have been characterised.

500|$|Iodine pentafluoride (IF5), a colourless, {{volatile}} liquid, is {{the most}} thermodynamically stable iodine fluoride, and {{can be made by}} reacting iodine with fluorine gas at room temperature. It is a fluorinating agent, but is mild enough to store in glass apparatus. Again, slight electrical conductivity is present in the liquid state because of dissociation to [...] and [...] The pentagonal bipyramidal iodine heptafluoride (IF7) is an extremely powerful fluorinating agent, behind only <b>chlorine</b> <b>trifluoride,</b> chlorine pentafluoride, and bromine pentafluoride among the interhalogens: it reacts with almost all the elements even at low temperatures, fluorinates Pyrex glass to form iodine(VII) oxyfluoride (IOF5), and sets carbon monoxide on fire.|$|E
500|$|<b>Chlorine</b> <b>trifluoride</b> (ClF3) is a {{volatile}} colourless molecular liquid which melts at −76.3°C and boils at 11.8°C. It may be formed by directly fluorinating gaseous chlorine or chlorine monofluoride at 200–300°C. It {{is one of}} the most reactive known chemical compounds, reacting with many substances which in ordinary circumstances would be considered chemically inert, such as asbestos, concrete, and sand. It explodes on contact with water and most organic substances. The list of elements it sets on fire is diverse, containing hydrogen, potassium, phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, sulfur, selenium, tellurium, bromine, iodine, and powdered molybdenum, tungsten, rhodium, iridium, and iron. An impermeable fluoride layer is formed by sodium, magnesium, aluminium, zinc, tin, and silver, which may be removed by heating. When heated, even such noble metals as palladium, platinum, and gold are attacked and even the noble gases xenon and radon do not escape fluorination. Nickel containers are usually used due to that metal's great resistance to attack by <b>chlorine</b> <b>trifluoride,</b> stemming from the formation of an unreactive nickel fluoride layer. Its reaction with hydrazine to form hydrogen fluoride, nitrogen, and chlorine gases was used in experimental rocket motors, but has problems largely stemming from its extreme hypergolicity resulting in ignition without any measurable delay. For these reasons, it was used in bomb attacks during the Second World War by the Nazis. Today, it is mostly used in nuclear fuel processing, to oxidise uranium to uranium hexafluoride for its enriching and to separate it from plutonium. It can act as a fluoride ion donor or acceptor (Lewis base or acid), although it does not dissociate appreciably into [...] and [...] ions.|$|E
500|$|At room temperature, {{bromine trifluoride}} (BrF3) is a straw-coloured liquid. It may be formed by {{directly}} fluorinating bromine {{at room temperature}} and is purified through distillation. It reacts explosively with water and hydrocarbons, but is a less violent fluorinating reagent than <b>chlorine</b> <b>trifluoride.</b> It reacts vigorously with boron, carbon, silicon, arsenic, antimony, iodine, and sulfur to give fluorides, and also reacts with most metals and their oxides: as such, {{it is used to}} oxidise uranium to uranium hexafluoride in the nuclear industry. Refractory oxides tend to be only partially fluorinated, but here the derivatives KBrF4 and BrF2SbF6 remain reactive. Bromine trifluoride is a useful nonaqueous ionising solvent, since it readily dissociates to form [...] and [...] and thus conducts electricity.|$|E
500|$|Chlorine monofluoride (ClF) is {{extremely}} thermally stable, and is sold commercially in 500-gram steel lecture bottles. It is a colourless gas that melts at −155.6°C and boils at −100.1°C. It may {{be produced by}} the direction of its elements at 225°C, though it must then be separated and purified from <b>chlorine</b> <b>trifluoride</b> and its reactants. Its properties are mostly intermediate between those of chlorine and fluorine. It will react with many metals and nonmetals from room temperature and above, fluorinating them and liberating chlorine. It will also act as a chlorofluorinating agent, adding chlorine and fluorine across a multiple bond or by oxidation: for example, it will attack carbon monoxide to form carbonyl chlorofluoride, COFCl. It will react analogously with hexafluoroacetone, (CF3)2CO, with a potassium fluoride catalyst to produce heptafluoroisopropyl hypochlorite, (CF3)2CFOCl; with nitriles RCN to produce RCF2NCl2; and with the sulfur oxides SO2 and SO3 to produce ClOSO2F and ClSO2F respectively. It will also react exothermically and violently with compounds containing –OH and –NH groups, such as water: ...|$|E
500|$|The gaseous {{diffusion}} plant {{was the most}} complicated of all from an engineering point of view. Uranium hexafluoride gas was pumped into a cascade, becoming richer in uranium-235 at each stage as it passed {{through a series of}} membranes. Procuring the nickel powder used by the Manhattan Project was not a problem, as it came from a British firm. Once again, a Royal Ordnance Factory was chosen as the site, in this case ROF Capenhurst at Capenhurst, near Chester, which had the advantage of being only [...] from Risley. One decision was that instead of producing uranium hexafluoride using elemental fluorine, which was difficult and hazardous to transport, it was produced at Springfields from <b>chlorine</b> <b>trifluoride.</b> This process was untried and did not work properly, and when production commenced in February 1952, the hexafluoride plant did not perform adequately. It had to be redesigned at a cost of £250,000. The {{gaseous diffusion}} plant at Capenhurst, which cost £14 million, started production in 1953, but only produced low-enriched uranium, and did not produce highly enriched uranium until 1954. By 1957 it was capable of producing 125kg of highly enriched uranium per annum. British designs at this time used large amounts of enriched uranium; 87kg for Green Bamboo, 117kg for Orange Herald. At the end of 1961, having produced between 3.8 and 4.9 tonnes of highly enriched uranium, it was switched over to low-enriched uranium production for civil nuclear power.|$|E

50|$|ClF3 is a {{very strong}} {{oxidizing}} and fluorinating agent. It is extremely reactive with most inorganic and organic materials, including glass and Teflon, and will initiate the combustion of many otherwise non-flammable materials without any ignition source. These reactions are often violent, and in some cases explosive. Vessels made from steel, copper, or nickel resist the attack of the material due to formation of a thin layer of insoluble metal fluoride, but molybdenum, tungsten, and titanium form volatile fluorides and are consequently unsuitable. Any equipment that comes into contact with <b>chlorine</b> <b>trifluoride</b> must be scrupulously cleaned and then passivated, because any contamination left may burn through the passivation layer faster than it can re-form. <b>Chlorine</b> <b>trifluoride</b> has also been known to corrode otherwise known non-corrodible materials such as iridium.|$|E
5000|$|The {{power to}} surpass the {{oxidizing}} ability of oxygen leads to extreme corrosivity against oxide-containing materials often thought as incombustible. <b>Chlorine</b> <b>trifluoride</b> and gases like {{it have been}} reported to ignite sand, asbestos, and other highly fire-retardant materials. It will also ignite the ashes of materials that have already been burned in oxygen. In an industrial accident, a spill of 900 kg of <b>chlorine</b> <b>trifluoride</b> burned through 30 cm of concrete and 90 cm of gravel beneath. [...] Fire control/suppression is incapable of suppressing this oxidation, so the surrounding area must simply be kept cool until the reaction ceases. [...] The compound reacts violently with water-based suppressors, and oxidizes in the absence of atmospheric oxygen, rendering atmosphere-displacement suppressors such as CO2 and halon completely ineffective. It ignites glass on contact.|$|E
