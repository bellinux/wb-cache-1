5|$|Bree and her husband, Orson (Kyle MacLachlan), find it {{increasingly}} difficult to stage her fake pregnancy. Their hoax is almost revealed at a neighborhood barbecue when a fork stabs her pregnancy stomach pads. Orson suggests coming <b>clean</b> <b>to</b> avoid the humiliation if their lies were to be discovered, but Bree tells him that this child is her second chance at successfully raising a child. Meanwhile, Susan worries that Mike is dissatisfied with their marriage, especially after Adam, her new gynecologist, reveals that she may be entering menopause. However, Adam later informs Susan that his earlier assessment was a mistake and that she is pregnant.|$|E
5|$|Beyond the {{slowness}} {{of making}} a new mass standard and the poor reproducibility, there were other intrinsic shortcomings to the ionaccumulation approach {{that proved to be}} formidable obstacles to ion-accumulation-based techniques becoming a practical realization. The apparatus necessarily required that the deposition chamber have an integral balance system to enable the convenient calibration of a reasonable quantity of transfer standards relative to any single internal ion-deposited prototype. Furthermore, the mass prototypes produced by ion deposition techniques would have been nothing like the freestanding platinum-iridium prototypes currently in use; they would have been deposited onto—and become part of—an electrode imbedded into one pan of a special balance integrated into the device. Moreover, the ion-deposited mass wouldn't have had a hard, highly polished surface that can be vigorously cleaned like those of current prototypes. Gold, while dense and a noble metal (resistant to oxidation and the formation of other compounds), is extremely soft so an internal gold prototype would have to be kept well isolated and scrupulously <b>clean</b> <b>to</b> avoid contamination and the potential of wear from having to remove the contamination. Bismuth, which is an inexpensive metal used in low-temperature solders, slowly oxidizes when exposed to room-temperature air and forms other chemical compounds and so would not have produced stable reference masses unless it was continually maintained in a vacuum or inert atmosphere.|$|E

Their relationship is a mirror foil of George's previous infatuation with the oblivious Meredith. She prioritizes helping George study over taking part in a surgery with Mark Sloan (Eric Dane), but feels betrayed when George doesn't request that she become one of his interns after passing his exam.

Though Franco rescues Carly, Michael still blames Kiki and Franco for the situation. Kiki later moves in with Silas and is shocked when Michael's uncle Luke Spencer (Anthony Geary) starts hitting on her. Instead of confiding in Michael who is grieving {{the loss of his}} {{biological}} father A. J. Quartermaine (Sean Kanan), she confides in Morgan. Kiki eventually comes <b>clean</b> <b>to</b> Michael about Luke which leads to Tracy Quartermaine (Jane Elliot) losing her job as CEO of the family's company ELQ—and Michael being appointed to the position. In the summer of 2014, after her cousin Rafe Kovich, Jr. (Jimmy Deshler) passes away, Kiki reconciles with a pregnant Ava who fears Sonny will kill her once she gives birth because Ava knows Sonny killed A. J. Feeling the need to protect Michael, Morgan and Kiki agree to keep quiet. Kiki is suspicious of Michael's new assistant Rosalie Martinez (Linda Elena Tovar) who has realized they are keeping something from him. Kiki and Morgan lie, claiming they are planning a surprise party for Michael. Kiki later learns that Carly has been cheating on Franco with Sonny and tells him the truth days before Carly and Franco's wedding. On the wedding day, Franco confronts Carly about her cheating and then reveals that Sonny killed A. J. and Carly has been helping him cover it up. Michael is furious to discover both Kiki and Morgan knew about A. J.'s murder and he dumps her. Kiki is furious to learn that Ava tricked Sonny into killing A.
