40|$|Adolescent pregnancies are high-risk obstetric occurrences with {{far-reaching}} {{implications for}} these mothers' education, employment, general wellbeing and health. Adolescent motherhood could imply lifelong poverty. With available <b>contraceptives,</b> pregnancies can be postponed until the adolescents have completed their schooling and can {{care for their}} babies. The {{purpose of the study}} was to identify factors that influenced adolescent mothers' failure to use <b>contraceptives</b> effectively, and to make recommendations to address these factors. A quantitative descriptive research design was adopted, and structured interviews were conducted with 43 adolescent mothers who visited the postnatal or well baby clinics in Marondera district. Factors that contributed to adolescent mothers' non-utilisation of <b>contraceptives</b> included their lack of timely sex education, lack of knowledge about <b>contraceptives,</b> fears of infertility after the utilisation of <b>contraceptives,</b> lack of knowledge about and the inaccessibility of emergency <b>contraceptives</b> and termination of pregnancy services in the Marondera district. Adolescents need more knowledge about accessible <b>contraceptives.</b> The possibility of providing emergency <b>contraceptives</b> to women in Zimbabwe should be investigated. Even in the absence of termination of pregnancy services, the accessibility of <b>contraceptives</b> and emergency <b>contraceptives</b> could help adolescents to delay childbearing, providing adolescents with more power to plan their own futures - and those of their future children.

5|$|By 1938, over 400 <b>contraceptive</b> {{manufacturers}} were in business, over 600 {{brands of}} female contraceptives were available, and industry revenues exceeded $250million per year.

Although condoms had become commonplace in the 1930s, feminists in the movement felt that birth control should be the woman's prerogative, and they continued to push for development of a <b>contraceptive</b> that was under the woman's control, a campaign which ultimately led to the birth control pill decades later. To increase the availability of high-quality contraceptives, birth control advocates established the Holland–Rantos company to manufacture contraceptives– primarily diaphragms, which were Sanger's recommended method. By the 1930s, the diaphragm with spermicidal jelly had become the most commonly prescribed form of contraception; in 1938, female contraceptives accounted for 85 percent of annual <b>contraceptive</b> sales.|$|E

40|$|Combined oral <b>contraceptives</b> show clear {{differences}} in {{effect on the}} tissue factor-initiated coagulation test of activated protein C resistance, which {{is dependent on the}} presence and dosage of levonorgestrel.

A resistance to activated protein C of monophasic COCs with desogestrel, gestodene, or norgestimate close to the value of women heterozygous for factor V Leiden was confirmed. Higher concentrations of levonorgestrel counteract the increase in resistance. Thus, monophasic and multiphasic COCs with levonogestrel were distinguished according to their effects on tissue-factor-initiated resistance to activated protein C. A more detailed comparison of in-vitro coagulation effects and epidemiology will further assess the plausibility and mechanisms of resistance in relation to activated protein C acquired by COC use and venous thromboembolism.

40|$|Addressing {{the issue}} of {{unintended}} pregnancy is a national priority. One proposed strategy to reduce unintended pregnancy is to improve access to oral <b>contraceptives</b> by changing them to over-the-counter (OTC) status.

5|$|Several {{methods of}} {{contraception}} involve the cervix. Cervical diaphragms are reusable, firm-rimmed plastic devices inserted {{by a woman}} prior to intercourse that cover the cervix. Pressure against {{the walls of the}} vagina maintain the position of the diaphragm, and it acts as a physical barrier to prevent the entry of sperm into the uterus, preventing fertilisation. Cervical caps are a similar method, although they are smaller and adhere to the cervix by suction. Diaphragms and caps are often used in conjunction with spermicides. In one year, 12% of women using the diaphragm will undergo an unintended pregnancy, and with optimal use this falls to 6%. Efficacy rates are lower for the cap, with 18% of women undergoing an unintended pregnancy, and 10–13% with optimal use. Most types of progestogen-only pills are effective as a <b>contraceptive</b> because they thicken cervical mucus making it difficult for sperm to pass along the cervical canal. In addition, they may also sometimes prevent ovulation. In contrast, <b>contraceptive</b> pills that contain both oestrogen and progesterone, the combined oral <b>contraceptive</b> pills, work mainly by preventing ovulation. They also thicken cervical mucus and thin the lining of the uterus enhancing their effectiveness.|$|E

40|$|Use of {{combined}} oral <b>contraceptives</b> {{is associated}} with a three- to six-fold increased risk of venous thrombosis. Hormonal <b>contraceptives</b> induce acquired resistance to activated protein C (APC), which predicts the risk of venous thrombosis. The biological basis of the acquired APC resistance is unknown.

Our objective was to assess the effect of both hormonal and non-hormonal <b>contraceptives</b> with different routes of administration on free TFPI and free PS levels. We conducted an observational study in 243 users of different <b>contraceptives</b> and measured APC sensitivity ratios (nAPCsr), free TFPI and free PS levels.
