50|$|Since {{the first}} {{description}} of cryoglobulinemia {{in association with}} the clinical triad of skin purpura, joint pain, and weakness by Meltzer et al in 1967, the percentage of cryoglobulinemic diseases described as essential cryoglobulinemia or idiopathic cryoglobulinemia, that is cryoglobulinemic disease that is unassociated with an underlying disorder, has fallen. Currently most cases of this disease are found to be associated with premalignant, malignant, infectious, or autoimmune disorders that are the known or presumed causes for the production of cryoglobulins. This form of non-essential or non-idiopathic cryoglobulinemic disease is classically grouped into three types according to the Brouet classification. The classification distinguishes three subtypes of cryoglobulinemic diseases based on two factors, the class of immunoglobulins in the <b>cryoglobulin</b> and the association of the cryoglobulinemic disease with other disorder. The following table lists these three types of cryoglobulenmic disease, characterized on the monoclonal immunoglobulin(s) comprising the involved <b>cryoglobulin,</b> percentage of total cryoglobulinemic disease cases, and class of disorders associated for each type.|$|E

50|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} {{due to the}} cryoglobulins of type I disease reflect the hyperviscosity and deposition of cryoglobulins within the blood vessels which reduce or stop blood perfusion to tissues. These events occur particularly in cases where blood <b>cryoglobulin</b> levels of monoclonal IgM are high in patients with IgM MGUS, smoldering Waldenström's macroglobulinemia, or Waldenström's macroglobulinemia and in uncommon cases where the levels of monoclonal IgA, IgG, free κ light chains, or free λ light chains are extremely high in patients with non-IgM MGUS, non-IgM smoldering multiple myeloma, or multiple myeloma. The interruption of blood flow to neurological tissues can cause symptoms of confusion, headache, hearing loss, and peripheral neuropathy. Interruption of blood flow to other tissues in type I disease can cause cutaneous manifestations of purpura, acrocyanosis, necrosis, ulcers, and livedo reticularis; spontaneous nose bleeds, joint pain, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis; and cardiovascular disturbances such as shortness of breath, hypoxemia, and congestive heart failure.|$|E
5000|$|Types II and III (or mixed or variant) cryoglobulinemic {{disease may}} also present with {{symptoms}} {{and signs of}} blood hyperviscosity and intravascular <b>cryoglobulin</b> deposition but also include those attributable to cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. [...] "Meltzer's triad" [...] of palpable purpura, joint pain, and generalized weakness occurs in ~33% of patients presenting with type II or type III disease. One or more skin lesions including palpable purpura, ulcers, digital gangrene, and areas of necrosis occur in 69%-89% of these mixed disease cases (see attached photograph); less common findings include painful peripheral neuropathy (19%-44% of cases), kidney disease (primarily membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (30%), joint pain (28%), and, less commonly, dry eye syndrome, Raynaud phenomenon (i.e. episodic painful reductions in {{blood flow to the}} fingers and toes). While the glomerulonephritis occurring in mixed disease appears to be due to inflammatory vasculitis, the glomerulonephritis occurring in type I disease appears due to the interruption of blood flow. The hematological, infectious, and autoimmune diseases underlying type II cryoglobulinemic disease and the infectious and autoimmune diseases underlying type III cryoglobulinemic disease are also critical parts of the disease's clinical findings.|$|E

After removal of antiglobulin activity by immunoabsorption with heat-aggregated gammaglobulin all serological test results for treponemal infection became negative. Serological tests for syphilis and rheumatoid factor on the supernatant from whole serum (minus <b>cryoglobulin)</b> remained positive though at a lower titre (latex 1 / 1250). <b>Cryoglobulin</b> isolated from whole serum retained rheumatoid and TPHA reactivity but was negative in the FTA-ABS test.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of cryoprecipitation of a monoclonal IgM kappa <b>cryoglobulin</b> (Mou) {{with a cold}} agglutinin activity of Pr 2 specificity has been studied. By immunodiffusion this <b>cryoglobulin</b> reacted (by its Fab' fragment) with micellar GM 3, a ganglioside bearing the Pr 2 antigenic determinant. In contrast to previous reports that indicated a possible temperature dependent self-association of IgM molecules via an immunological interaction leading to cold precipitation, we could not detect any affinity of this <b>cryoglobulin</b> for IgM when we used passive hemagglutination or an {{indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA). However, a GM 3 -like ganglioside could be extracted, by drastic methods, from the <b>cryoglobulin</b> studied at 22 degrees C, whereas no GM 3 was extracted from two control cryoglobulins. Some minor gangliosides (representing less than 25 % of total amount of bound gangliosides) were also extracted from Mou <b>cryoglobulin</b> and these gangliosides were shown to crossreact with GM 3, as they specifically bind to Mou <b>cryoglobulin</b> by ELISA. After cryoprecipitation the serum still contained a monoclonal anti-Pr 2 IgM kappa. A GM 3 -like ganglioside could be extracted from this purified IgM, and cryoprecipitability could be induced by the addition of a minute amount of micellar GM 3. These results suggest that Mou <b>cryoglobulin</b> circulates as an immune complex and that cryoprecipitation may depend on unique IgM-GM 3 (or IgM-GM 3 cross-reacting gangliosides) complexes...|$|E

The objective was to study the prevalence and the clinical and therapeutic impacts of cryofibrinogen in HCV-infected patients. METHODS: A total of 143 consecutive HCV-infected (RNA+) patients (including 57 patients with HCV-related vasculitis) were screened for cryofibrinogen and <b>cryoglobulin</b> (positive if > 0. 05 g/L). The main characteristics and outcome were evaluated according to the cryofibrinogen/cryoglobulin status at baseline. RESULTS: At baseline, 53 of 143 patients (37 %) were cryofibrinogen positive, most of whom (47 / 53 [89 %]) were also <b>cryoglobulin</b> positive. Only 37 of 90 cryofibrinogen-negative patients (41 %) were <b>cryoglobulin</b> positive (P<. 001). In patients with HCV-related vasculitis, 28 of 57 (49 %) were cryofibrinogen positive compared with 25 of 86 patients (29 %) without vasculitis (P=. 03). There was a higher rate of renal involvement in cryofibrinogen-negative/cryoglobulin-positive patients than in cryofibrinogen-positive/cryoglobulin-positive patients (10 / 25 [40 %] vs 3 / 27 [11 %], respectively; P=. 02). After a mean follow-up of 32. 6 months, among patients who were cryofibrinogen positive at baseline, 12 of 26 (46 %) of those who received an HCV treatment were cryofibrinogen negative at the end of follow-up compared with 4 of 16 (25 %) of those who did not receive antiviral drugs.

Forty three patients had <b>cryoglobulins,</b> which were responsible for clinical manifestations in 12.  RESULTS—At the end of interferon treatment, <b>cryoglobulins</b> had disappeared in 39 % of the patients. A clinical improvement (except for neuropathies) was observed in all patients. Six months after interferon treatment was stopped, the same rate of response (normal alanine aminotransferase values and undectable HCV RNA) was observed in patients with or without <b>cryoglobulins.</b> Only 14 % of patients still had undetectable <b>cryoglobulins,</b> and all of them also had undetectable serum HCV RNA. The disappearance of <b>cryoglobulins</b> was found less frequently in patients with clinical symptoms than in asymptomatic ones, but the difference was not significant.

A significant positive correlation was observed between antinuclear antibody (ANA), anti-dsDNA (dsDNA: Double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid), CH 50 (CH 50 : total hemolytic complement assay), and C-reactive protein (CRP) (r = 0. 21, P = 0. 004, r = 0. 65, P = 0. 001, r = 0. 45, P = 0. 023, r = 0. 38, P = 0. 036, respectively). Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection was not detected in any of the SLE patients. Conclusion: Although the presence of <b>cryoglobulins</b> in the SLE patients correlated with positive anti-ds DNA and low CH 50, it could not be predict activity of the disease...|$|R
40|$|Serum globulins that {{precipitate}} on cooling and redissolve on warming {{may occur}} {{in a variety of}} clinically dissimilar disorders. In some cases their presence may be a manifestation of 'Immune-complex disease. " A case of postperfusion syndrome apparently due to cytomegalovirus is presented; <b>cryoglobulins</b> and hemolytic anemia were present as part of the syndrome. This case focuses on the interrelationships of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) virus, autoimmunity, immune complexes, <b>cryoglobulins,</b> and glomerulonephritis. Studies of the composition of <b>cryoglobulins</b> from the serum of patients with essential cryoglobulinemia and from the synovial fluid of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, although providing no definitive answers, do relate DNA-like antigens an...|$|R
40|$|This {{case study}} aimed to {{investigate}} effects of type III <b>cryoglobulins</b> {{isolated from the}} blood of patients with schizophrenia on the production of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin(IL) - 1 β, IL- 6 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), anti-inflammatory cytokine IL- 10, and chemotactic cytokines IL- 8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1 (MCP- 1) by {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMCs). The experiments were performed in vitro using PBMCs healthy subjects and the blood of patients whit schizoprenia. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay were used upon study. The results obtained indicated significant increase (P< 0. 05) in IL- 1 β, IL- 6, TNF-α, IL- 8, and MCP- 1 production by cultured PBMCs when incubating for 24 hours with <b>cryoglobulins,</b> beginning from 0. 4 [*]mg/mL. The gender difference does not affect the cryoglobulins-induced production of these cytokines by PBMCs. No influence of <b>cryoglobulins</b> on production of IL- 10 by PBMCs was observed. Also, it was shown that <b>cryoglobulins</b> in concentration ≤ 4 [*]mg/mL possessed no cytotoxic effect towards cultured PBMCs. Based upon the results obtained, we concluded that type III <b>cryoglobulins</b> are implicated in schizophrenia-associated alterations in the immune response through induction of the expression of proinflammatory and chemotactic cytokines by PBMCs...|$|R
