500|$|The Jones-produced {{sessions}} {{started in}} April 1969 at EMI Studios. After {{the first of}} these sessions, Barrett brought in friends to help out: Humble Pie drummer Jerry Shirley, and Jokers Wild (Gilmour's old band) drummer Willie Wilson. For the sessions, Gilmour played bass. Talking to Barrett wasn't easy, said Jones: [...] "It was a case of following him, not playing with him. They were seeing and then playing so they were always a note behind". A few tracks on the album feature overdubs by members of the band Soft Machine. During this time, Barrett also played guitar on the sessions for Soft Machine founder Kevin Ayers' debut LP Joy of a Toy, although his performance on [...] "Religious Experience" [...] (later titled [...] "Singing a Song in the Morning") was not released until the album was reissued in 2003. One time, Barrett had told his flatmate that he was going off [...] "for an afternoon drive". However, he followed Pink Floyd to Ibiza (according to legend, he skipped check-ins and customs, ran onto the runway and attempted to flag down a jet). One of his friends, J. Ryan Eaves, bass player for the short-lived but influential Manchester band [...] "York's Ensemble", later spotted him on a beach wearing messed-up clothes and with a <b>carrier</b> <b>bag</b> full of money. By this point, during the trip, Barrett had asked Gilmour for his help in the recording sessions.|$|E

[...] The performance began with a screening of This Brick, a short 35mm film of a brick made {{from the ashes of}} the K Foundation's million-pound bonfire. Following an introduction by Factory Records founder Tony Wilson, Drummond and Cauty were then unveiled as pyjama-clad, wheelchair-using pensioners with grey hair and, strapped to their foreheads, prominent horns that had been used regularly in The KLF's promotional videos. [...] Drummond was also seen plucking feathers from a dead swan. [...] According to a press release issued by Mute/Blast First (Acid Brass' and 2K's record label), [...] "Two elderly gentlemen, reeking of Dettol, caused havoc in their motorised wheelchairs. These old reprobates, bearing a grandfatherly resemblance to messrs Cauty and Drummond, claimed to have just been asked along."
