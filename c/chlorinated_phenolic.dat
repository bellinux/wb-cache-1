50|$|TCA {{is usually}} {{produced}} when naturally occurring airborne fungi and bacteria (usually Aspergillus sp., Penicillium sp., Actinomycetes, Botrytis cinerea, Rhizobium sp., or Streptomyces) {{are presented with}} <b>chlorinated</b> <b>phenolic</b> compounds, which they then convert into chlorinated anisole derivatives. The chlorophenols can originate from various contaminants such as those found in some pesticides and wood preservatives. Chlorophenols {{can also be a}} product of the chlorine bleaching process used to sterilize or bleach wood, paper, and other materials; they can be synthesized by reaction of hypochlorites with lignin. They can also migrate from other objects such as shipping pallets treated by chlorophenols.|$|E
5000|$|The air regulations, {{also known}} as [...] "Maximum Achievable Control Technology" [...] (MACT) regulations, apply to mills that use {{chemical}} pulping and call for hazardous air pollutants to be reduced by 59% and for volatile organic carbon and particulate matter to be reduced by 49% and 37%, respectively. The wastewater regulations in the CR apply to mills that combine chlorine bleaching with kraft chemical pulping and aim to reduce dioxins, furan, and chloroform discharges by 96%, 96%, and 99%, respectively. EPA added numeric effluent limitations for 12 <b>chlorinated</b> <b>phenolic</b> pollutants and adsorbable organic halides (AOX).

50|$|The chief {{cause of}} cork taint is the {{presence}} of the chemical compounds 2,4,6-trichloroanisole (TCA) or 2,4,6-tribromoanisole (TBA) in the wine, which in many cases will have been transferred from the cork, but which also can have been transferred through the cork rather than from it. TCA is a compound which does not occur naturally. It is created when some fungi are treated with <b>chlorinated</b> <b>phenolic</b> compounds, which are a type of antimicrobial agent used in the processing of wood. This compound is one of the chief factors responsible for the problem associated with mold liable to be found in cork. Very small amounts of this compound, on the order of nanograms, can be responsible for this defect. Corked wine containing TCA has a characteristic odor, variously described as resembling a moldy newspaper, wet dog, damp cloth, or damp basement. In almost all cases of corked wine the wine's native aromas are reduced significantly, and a very tainted wine is quite unpalatable, although harmless. While the human threshold for detecting TCA is measured in the single-digit parts per trillion, this can vary by several orders of magnitude depending on an individual's sensitivity. Detection is also complicated by the olfactory system's particularly quick habituation to TCA, making the smell less obvious on each subsequent sniff.|$|E
40|$|<b>Chlorinated</b> <b>phenolics</b> {{are formed}} during {{chlorination}} stage of pulp bleaching. These phenolics are dissolved in the alkaline extraction stage. The bleach plant effluent therefore contains these compounds in appreciable amount. As these chlorophenolics are highly toxic in nature, {{efforts have been}} made to reduce their concentration by changing the bleaching parameters. In the present studies experiments were conducted with bamboo pulp employing CEH sequence of bleaching under varying conditions. The effect of changing the chlorination stage parameters like pH, temperature, pulp consistency and distribution of bleaching chemicals between C and H was changed. The effluent parameters and pulp characteristics have also been determined. The results show that the amount of all categories of <b>chlorinated</b> <b>phenolics</b> are reduced by increasing the pH (1. 5 – 4. 0), decreasing temperature (35 - 150 C) and all chlorophenolics are decreased by decreasing the consistency (4 - 2 %) and C:H ratio (65 : 35 to 45 : 55) ...|$|R

The photocatalysis advanced oxidation process was the technology applied to achieve treatment. Chemical behavioural tracking was performed using the chloride dehalogenation sequence dynamics. The study recorded reductive dehalogenation chemical transformation kinetics of multi-substituted <b>chlorinated</b> <b>phenolics</b> in continuous flow reactor systems. This {{was performed by}} manipulation of liquid flow-rates in the photocatalytic oxidations process using suspended and immobilised catalyst applications. A modified Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic model was proposed that explained the oxidation transformational behaviour of the dehalogenation process derived intermediates.

40|$|Systematic {{sub-sampling}} {{of sediment}} cores in sections of uniform thickness {{is necessary in}} order to evaluate historic changes in sediment quality, to determine the vertical extent of contamination, and to measure sedimentation rates. With these objectives in mind, fourteen sediment cores were collected during March 2002 using the Illinois State Water Survey vibracorer. Concentrations of metals and total organic carbon were measured using standard techniques. Concentrations of <b>chlorinated</b> pesticides, <b>phenolic</b> compounds, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were measured by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The concentrations of <b>chlorinated</b> pesticides, <b>phenolic</b> compounds and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were below the method detection limit in all sediment samples analyzed. However, there was a wide range in concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) which were detected in all sediment samples. Also, a wide range of metal concentrations was noted in the sediments evaluated. Lower concentrations of metals were found in the upper 0. 5 m of sediment but concentrations were elevated at depths ranging from 1. 0 m to 1. 5 m. Sedimentation rates were estimated using cesium- 137 radiometric dating on 14 vibracores. Sedimentation rates range from < 0. 1 to 1. 9 cm/yr, with an average of 0. 9 cm/yr.

40|$|Abstract Background Fungal laccases {{are useful}} enzymes for {{industrial}} applications; they exhibit broad substrate specificity {{and thus are}} able to oxidize a variety of xenobiotic compounds including <b>chlorinated</b> <b>phenolics,</b> synthetic dyes, pesticides and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Unfortunately, the biotechnological exploitation of laccases can be hampered by the difficulties concerning the enzyme production by the native hosts. Results In order to obtain a simple and efficient source of laccase, the lcc 1 cDNA isolated from the white-rot fungus Trametes trogii has been successfully expressed in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris {{under the control of}} the methanol induced alcohol oxidase promoter P AOX 1. The recombinant Lcc 1 was produced as a secreted protein with the native N-terminal prepropeptide for signal trafficking, and thus easily recovered from the culture medium. At the 1 -liter scale, as calculated on the basis of the specific activity, the recombinant protein was produced at a yield of 17 mg/l. The highest production level obtained in fed-batch culture was 2520 U/l, corresponding to a specific productivity of 31. 5 U/g biomass. The purified recombinant laccase exhibited a behaviour similar to the main laccase produced by T. trogii. Lcc 1 showed high activity in the presence of organic solvents and a high decolourization capacity towards azo, triarylmethane, indigo carmine and anthraquinonic dyes, that could be significantly enhanced in the presence of the redox mediators 1 -hydroxybenzotriazole and violuric acid. Conclusion Heterologous expression of T. trogii laccase lcc 1 in the methylotrophic yeast P. pastoris was successfully achieved. The biochemical and kinetic characterization of the recombinant protein suggests potential technological applications for this enzyme. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to develop, optimize, and {{evaluate}} new separation methods for removal of hazardous (radionuclides and toxic non-radioactive contaminants) metal ions from either ground water or aqueous waste solutions produced during Decontamination and Decommissioning operations at DOE sites. Separation and concentration of the target ions {{will result in a}} substantial reduction in the volume of material requiring disposal or long-term storage. The target metal ions studied were uranium, thorium, lead, cadmium, and mercury along with chromium (as chromate). The methods tested use membrane ultrafiltration in conjunction with water-soluble polymers or surfactants with added metal-selective chelating agents. Laboratory scale tests showed removal of 99. 0 - 99. 9 % of each metal tested in a single separation stage. The methods developed for selective removal of radionuclides (UO 22 +, Th 4 +) and toxic heavy metals (Pb 2 +, Cd 2 +, Hg 2 +) are applicable to two DOE focus areas; decontamination of sites and equipment, and in remediation of contaminated groundwater. Colloid-enhanced ultrafiltration methods have potential to be substantially less expensive than alternative methods and can result in less waste. Results of studies with varying solution composition (concentration, acidity) and filtration parameters (pressure, flow rate) have increased our understanding of the fundamental processes that control the metal ion separation and colloid recovery steps of the overall process. Further laboratory studies are needed to improve the ligand/colloid recovery step and field demonstration of the technology is needed to prove the applicability of the integrated process. A number of graduate students, post-doctoral associates, and research associates have received training and research experience in the areas of separation science, colloid chemistry, and metal ion coordination chemistry of radionuclides and toxic metals. These scientists, some with positions in industry and academia, have the necessary background to address problems related to environmental remediation and. management. The results of this research show the technical feasibility of this separation technique to concentrate radionuclides and toxic metals. The technology developed during this project has wider applications and has been studied for removal of chromate or <b>chlorinated</b> <b>phenolics</b> from industrial wastewater.

40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to immobilize peroxidase (E. C. 1. 11. 1. 7) on to the rodlike cellulose nanocrystals after activation with cyanogen bromide treatment. The resulted bioactive conjugates were used to remove <b>chlorinated</b> <b>phenolic</b> compounds in aqueous solution. Gas phase Fourier transfer infrared spectroscopy was used for the detection and quantification of ammonia released from the immobilization reactions in situ. Results revealed that cyanogen bromide treatment of cellulose nanocrystals generated cyclic imidocarbonate group and cellulose carbamate. Covalent bonding between the activated nanoparticles and peroxidase generated ammonia as one of byproducts and the ammonia generation at an elevated temperature was more significant. Immobilization of enzyme at room temperature resulted in the bioactive conjugates with enzyme activity of 594 unit g - 1. Increase of immobilization temperature to 50 °C led to thermal deactivation of enzyme although immobilization probably proceeded fast. Comparing to its soluble counterpart, the immobilized peroxidase demonstrated high removal of <b>chlorinated</b> <b>phenolic</b> compounds.

40|$|Concentrations of {{polychlorinated biphenyls}} (PCBs), {{hydroxylated}} metabolites of PCBs (HO-PCBs) and octachlorostyrene (4 -HO-HpCS), and pentachlorophenol (PCP) were determined in umbilical cord plasma samples {{from three different}} regions of Qu 39 bec. The regions studied included two coastal areas where exposure to PCBs is high because of marine-food-based diets [...] Nunavik (Inuit people) and the Lower North Shore of the Gulf of St. Lawrence (subsistence fishermen) [...] and a southern Qu 39 bec urban center where PCB exposure is at background levels (Qu 39 bec City). The main <b>chlorinated</b> <b>phenolic</b> compound in all regions was PCP. Concentrations of PCP {{were not significantly different}} among regions (geometric mean concentration 1, 670 pg/g, range 628 - 7, 680 pg/g wet weight in plasma). The ratio of PCP to polychlorinated biphenyl congener number 153 (CB 153) concentration ranged from 0. 72 to 42. 3. Sum HO-PCB (sigma HO-PCBs) concentrations were different among regions, with geometric mean concentrations of 553 (range 238 - 1, 750), 286 (103 - 788), and 234 (147 - 464) pg/g wet weight plasma for the Lower North Shore, Nunavik, and the southern Qu 39 bec groups, respectively. Lower North Shore samples also had the highest geometric mean concentration of sum PCBs (sum of 49 congeners; sigma PCBs), 2, 710 (525 - 7, 720) pg/g wet weight plasma. sigma PCB concentrations for Nunavik samples and southern samples were 1, 510 (309 - 6, 230) and 843 (290 - 1, 650) pg/g wet weight plasma. Concentrations (log transformed) of sigma HO-PCBs and sigma PCBs were significantly correlated (r = 0. 62, p < 0. 001), as were concentrations of all major individual HO-PCB congeners and individual PCB congeners. In Nunavik and Lower North Shore samples, free thyroxine (T 4) concentrations (log transformed) were negatively correlated with the sum of quantitated <b>chlorinated</b> <b>phenolic</b> compounds (sum PCP and sigma HO-PCBs; r = - 0. 47, p = 0. 01, n = 20) and were not correlated with any PCB congeners or sigma PCBs. This suggests that PCP and HO-PCBs are possibly altering thyroid hormone status in newborns, which could lead to neurodevelopmental effects in infants.

40|$|Three polychlorophenol-degrading Rhodococcus and Mycobacterium strains were {{isolated}} independently from soil contaminated with chlorophenol wood preservative and from sludge of a wastewater treatment facility of a kraft pulp bleaching plant. Rhodococcus sp. strain CG- 1 and Mycobacterium sp. strain CG- 2, isolated from tetrachloroguaiacol enrichment, and Rhodococcus sp. strain CP- 2, isolated from pentachlorophenol enrichment, mineralized pentachlorophenol and degraded several other polychlorinated phenols, guaiacols (2 -methoxyphenols), and syringols (2, 6 -dimethoxyphenols) at micromolar concentrations and were {{sensitive to the}} toxic effects of pentachlorophenol.

40|$|A new compound, 4 -hydroxyheptachlorostyrene (4 -OH-HpCS), was {{identified}} as a major component in the <b>chlorinated</b> <b>phenolic</b> compound fraction of polar bear plasma. The structure was hypothesized to be 4 -OH-HpCS based on mass spectral interpretation, the assumption that it was a metabolite of octachlorostyrene, and the similarity of the structure to hydroxylated polychlorinated biphenyls (OH-PCBs) identified in plasma. High-resolution, electron impact (EI) ionization mass spectrometry of the methylated compound indicated a molecular formula of C 9 H 3 OCl 7 and major fragment ions of [M - 15], [M - 35], and [M - 43], which was a mass spectral pattern identical to a synthesized and methylated 4 -OH-HpCS standard. The identity was further confirmed by matching gas chromatography (GC) retention times on three different GC columns of differing polarity. Levels of 4 -OH-HpCS ranged from 2. 89 to 22. 9 ng/g wet weight in polar bear plasma (N = 30) and constituted between 3. 8 and 24. 8 ␘f the total quantified level of <b>chlorinated</b> <b>phenolic</b> compounds. The mean ratio of 4 -OH-HpCS to CB 153 concentrations in polar bear plasma samples was 0. 712 (± 0. 580 SD), which suggests selective retention of the 4 -OH-HpCS in plasma. The presumed mechanism of retention involves 4 -OH-HpCS binding to transthyretin (TTR). The presence of TTR was confirmed {{for the first time in}} polar bear plasma by binding of 125 I-thyroxine (T 4), the natural ligand of TTR, to separated plasma proteins. The binding affinity of 4 -OH-HpCS to human TTR was tested and found to be 1. 1 relative to T 4. This suggests that 4 -OH-HpCS has the potential to disrupt T 4 and retinol transport, by analogy to OH-PCBs with similar structure. Metabolism of octachlorostyrene (OCS) is the most likely source of 4 -OH-HpCS. OCS was shown to be present at low concentrations in polar bear tissues as well as in plasma of ringed seal, the principal prey species of polar bears. The ratio of 4 -OH-HpCS to OCS and 4 -OH-HpCS to CB 153 concentrations were 150 - and 44 -fold higher in polar bear plasma than in ringed seal plasma. This study indicates that the phenolic metabolites of relatively minor contaminants possess the capacity to bind to circulating proteins, and their significance as potential endocrine-disrupting agents may be underestimated...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} white-rot fungi were {{investigated}} for their efficiency at distillery wastewater remediation {{and the production}} of laccase as a valuable by-product. Distillery wastewaters are high in organic load and low in pH. The presence of phenolic compounds can lead to extremely colour-rich wastewaters and can be toxic to microorganisms. The presence of the inorganic ions may also affect biological treatment. White-rot fungi are unique among eukaryotic or prokaryotic microbes in possessing powerful oxidative enzyme systems that can degrade lignin to carbon dioxide. These ligninolytic enzymes, such as lignin peroxidase, manganese peroxidase and laccase, are capable of degrading a vast range of toxic, recalcitrant environmental pollutants and this makes the white-rot fungi strong candidates for the bioremediation of polluted soils and waters. The laccase enzyme alone has shown remediation potential in wastewaters such as beer production effluent, olive mill wastewater, alcohol distillery wastes, dye-containing wastewaters from the textile industry as well as wastewaters from the paper and pulp industry.

Amniotic fluid collected during amniocentesis is the only medium available to characterize direct fetal exposures early in pregnancy (~ 18 weeks of gestation). As a first step in validating this exposure biomarker, we collected 100 amniotic fluid samples slated for disposal and evaluated analytical methods to measure organophosphate and carbamate pesticides and metabolites, synthetic pyrethroid metabolites, herbicides, and <b>chlorinated</b> <b>phenolic</b> compounds.

After exposure to chlorhexidine, numerous spots of indentation on the cell wall were found in both Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli. The number of indentation spots increased with time of incubation and increasing chlorhexidine concentration. Interestingly, the dented spots found in B. subtilis appeared mainly at the hemispherical caps of the cells, while in E. coli the dented spots were found all over the cells. After being exposed to chlorhexidine for a prolonged period, leakage of cellular contents and subsequent ghost cells were observed, especially from B subtilis. By using 2 -D gel/MS-MS analysis, five proteins related to purine nucleoside interconversion and metabolism were preferentially induced in the cell wall of E. coli, while three proteins related to stress response and four others in amino acid biosynthesis were up-regulated in the cell wall materials of B. subtilis. The localized morphological damages together with the biochemical and protein analysis of the chlorhexidine-treated cells suggest that chlorhexidine may act on the differentially distributed lipids in the cell membranes/wall of B. subtilis and E. coli...|$|E

The regions studied included two coastal areas where exposure to PCBs is high because of marine-food–based diets—Nunavik (Inuit people) and the Lower North Shore of the Gulf of St. Lawrence (subsistence fishermen) —and a southern Québec urban center where PCB exposure is at background levels (Québec City). The main <b>chlorinated</b> <b>phenolic</b> compound in all regions was PCP. Concentrations of PCP {{were not significantly different}} among regions (geometric mean concentration 1, 670 pg/g, range 628 – 7, 680 pg/g wet weight in plasma). The ratio of PCP to polychlorinated biphenyl congener number 153 (CB 153) concentration ranged from 0. 72 to 42. 3. Sum HO-PCB (ΣHO-PCBs) concentrations were different among regions, with geometric mean concentrations of 553 (range 238 – 1, 750), 286 (103 – 788), and 234 (147 – 464) pg/g wet weight plasma for the Lower North Shore, Nunavik, and the southern Québec groups, respectively. Lower North Shore samples also had the highest geometric mean concentration of sum PCBs (sum of 49 congeners; ΣPCBs), 2, 710 (525 – 7, 720) pg/g wet weight plasma.

We also determined concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Total OH-PCB concentrations were variable among the Inuit samples, ranging over 2 orders of magnitude (0. 117 - 11. 6 ng/g whole blood wet weight). These concentradions were equal to and up to 70 times those found for the southern Quebec pooled whole blood sample. Geometric mean concentrations of tota OH-PCBs were 1. 73 and 1. 01 nglg whole blood for Inuit men and women, respectively, and 0. 161 nglg whole blood for the southern population pool. There are limited data available for comparison, but the levels of OH-PCBs in Imuit are higher thn those previously {{reported in the literature}} for other populations. There was a significant correlation (p < 0. 005) between OH-PCBs and PCBs (r = 0. 84) and both correlated significandy (p < 0. 005) with age (r = 0. 68 and 0. 78, respectively). The ratio of OH-PCBs to PCBs was lower in Inuit (0. 11) than in the southern Quebec pool (0. 33). There is no apparent explanation for the difference.

40|$|Female rats {{were exposed}} to 0, 5, 50 or 500 ppm of 2 -chlorophenol (2 -CP) or {{pentachlorophenol}} (PCP). The {{study was designed to}} produce progeny which {{were exposed to}} the chlorophenolic compounds both prenatally and postnatally. Percent conception, litter size, birth weight, and number of stillbirths was determined at parturition. Hematologic parameters and body weights of the progeny were recorded at weaning age (3 weeks). Effects on reproduction were observed in both the 2 -CP and PCP-exposed groups, as indicated by decreased litter sizes and increased number of stillborn. The data indicate that these <b>chlorinated</b> <b>phenolic</b> compounds may be feto- or embryotoxic at high doses. Effects on hematologic parameters were not observed. Further study involving transplacental and chronic exposures to these chlorophenolic compounds appears warranted. The chlorophenols are a group of 19 compounds which differ in degree and position of chlorination (1). These compounds consist of mono-, di-, tri- and tetrachloro isomers and a pentachlorophenol. The chlorinated phenols are effective disinfectants, antiseptics, fungicides, slimicides, bactericides, wood preservatives, herbicides, insecticides, and molluscicides (2 - 9). The widespread use of these chemicals in industry and agriculture has resulted in contamination of food producing animals and the environment. Inadvertent formation of 2 -chlorophenol, 2, 4 -dichlorophenol and 2, 4, 6 -trichlorophenol as byproducts of water chlorination represent significant sources of exposure to these compounds (1). 2 -Chlorophenol is a commercially produced chemical used as an intermediate in the production of higher chlorinated phenols. The generation of waste sources from the commercial production of 2 -chlorophenol, its chemically derived products, and the inadvertent formation of 2 -chlorophenol due to chlorination of organics in drinking and waste waters are potential sources of environmental contamination (1). Pentachlorophenol (PCP) and its salts have been widely used in agriculture and industry since 193...|$|E
40|$|Triclosan (5 -chloro- 2 -(2, 4 -dichlorophenoxy) -phenol) is a <b>chlorinated</b> <b>phenolic</b> {{antibacterial}} compound {{found in}} consumer products. In vitro human pregnane X receptor activation, hepatic phase I enzyme induction, and decreased in vivo total thyroxine (T 4) suggest {{adverse effects on}} thyroid hormone homeostasis. Current research tested the hypothesis that triclosan decreases circulating T 4 via upregulation of hepatic catabolism and transport. Weanling female Long-Evans rats received triclosan (0 – 1000 mg/kg/day) by gavage for 4 days. Whole blood and liver were collected 24 h later. Total serum T 4, triiodothyronine (T 3), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) were measured by radioimmunoassay. Hepatic microsomal assays measured ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase, pentoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (PROD), and uridine diphosphate glucuronyltransferase enzyme activities. The messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of cytochrome P 450 s 1 a 1, 2 b 1 / 2, and 3 a 1 / 23; UGTs 1 a 1, 1 a 6, and 2 b 5; sulfotransferases 1 c 1 and 1 b 1; and hepatic transporters Oatp 1 a 1, Oatp 1 a 4, Mrp 2, and Mdr 1 b was measured by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR. Total T 4 decreased dose responsively, down to 43 % of control at 1000 mg/kg/day. Total T 3 was decreased to 89 and 75 % of control at 300 and 1000 mg/kg/day. TSH did not change. Triclosan dose dependently increased PROD activity up to 900 % of control at 1000 mg/kg/day. T 4 glucuronidation increased nearly twofold at 1000 mg/kg/day. Cyp 2 b 1 / 2 and Cyp 3 a 1 / 23 mRNA expression levels were induced twofold and fourfold at 300 mg/kg/day. Ugt 1 a 1 and Sult 1 c 1 mRNA expression levels increased 2. 2 -fold and 2. 6 -fold at 300 mg/kg/day. Transporter mRNA expression levels were unchanged. These data denote important key events {{in the mode of}} action for triclosan-induced hypothyroxinemia in rats and suggest that this effect may be partially due to upregulation of hepatic catabolism but not due to mRNA expression changes in the tested hepatic transporters...|$|E
40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Civil EngineeringAlok BhandariHuman {{activities}} generate {{large amounts}} of <b>chlorinated</b> <b>phenolic</b> chemicals that are often introduced into the soil environment during pesticide and insecticide application, industrial releases, and accidental spills. For example, 2, 4 -dichlorophenol (DCP), a derivative of the herbicide 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4 -D) can been found in soil within 24 hours of 2, 4 - D application. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) -mediated polymerization has been proposed as an approach to remediate soils and groundwater contaminated by phenolic pollutants. Treatment with HRP results in the transformation of phenols into polyphenolic oligomers that sorb strongly or precipitate on soils surfaces. Although HRP-mediated chlorophenol stabilization has been studied extensively in surface soils, very limited scientific data is available that supports the application of this technology in subsurface materials. Hence, {{the focus of this}} study was to evaluate sorption and binding of DCP and products of HRP-mediated polymerization of DCP to model geosorbents representing subsurface geomaterials. These sorbents included two humin-mineral geomaterials and one mineral geosorbent derived from surface soils. Soil-water phase distribution of total solute in the HRP-amended systems was observed to reach equilibrium within 7 days in woodland humin-mineral soil (WHM), and within 1 day in agricultural humin-mineral (AHM) and model mineral geomaterials. For all the geomaterials used, water extraction data indicated the development of contact time-dependent resistance to extraction/dissolution of soil-associated DCP and DPP. Solute associated with WHM geomaterial was higher at the end of the study than that associated with AHM. Contact time increased DCP stabilization at all initial aqueous DCP concentrations studied. Results of this study suggest that DCP stabilization in organic geosorbents results from a combination of sorption and cross-coupling of DCP and precipitation of DPP; in inorganic soils, precipitation of DPP macromolecules is the dominant process. HRP-mediated stabilization of DCP in soils was effective and independent of the solution ionic concentration. The amount of DCP stabilized in the mineral soil was comparable to that stabilized in humin-mineral geomaterials. The research reported in this dissertation demosntrates the potential of HRP enzyme to stabilize DCP in subsurface geomaterials under variable contaminant and salt concentrations, thereby restricting its transport in the environment...|$|E
40|$|Liquid phase {{catalytic}} hydrodechlorinations {{can provide}} a convenient and environmentally friendly method for treating organic chlorinated compounds in waste streams generated during the manufacturing of agrochemicals. During such treatment hydrochloric acid is generated as a by-product, which can be easily neutralized employing a base to yield an inorganic salt. This work describes the results obtained during the liquid phase hydrodechlorination of 2, 6 -dichlorophenol (2, 6 -DCP) and 2, 4, 6 -trichlorophenol (2, 4, 6 -TCP). The hydrodechlorination of these <b>chlorinated</b> <b>phenolic</b> compounds {{in a mixture of}} methanol and water was investigated using supported and unsupported palladium catalysts to yield lower chlorinated phenols or phenol. Various parameters were investigated such as catalyst concentration, ammonium formate concentration, effect of base addition and effect of temperature. During this study two methods of hydrodechlorination were also investigated such as hydride-transfer hydrogenolysis, using ammonium formate, and hydrogenolysis, using dihydrogen. These methods offer a mild treatment in terms of the reaction temperature with temperatures used below 800 C. A comparison of the palladium catalyst systems using these methods also showed that Pd/C produced the best results in terms of the hydrodechlorination rate and the selectivity towards phenol. When the ammonium formate method was used, complete hydrodechlorination of both substrates was achieved in 1 h of reaction time at a selectivity of 100 percent towards phenol. A comparison of the method using dihydrogen and Pd/C showed that the reaction rate and the selectivity towards phenol during the hydrodechlorination of 2, 6 -DCP were 87. 92 percent and 93. 30 percent. Similarly, the reaction rate and selectivity during 2, 4, 6 - TCP hydrodechlorination were 63. 77 percent and 70. 57 percent. These results were achieved in a reaction time of 3 hours. A high catalyst loading increases the reaction rate at the expense of selectivity, due to the formation of cyclohexanone, formed during further hydrogenation of phenol. The formation of cyclohexanone was limited at high temperatures (ca. 800 C) with none detected during the hydrodechlorination of 2, 6 -DCP and 0. 19 percent during the hydrodechlorination of 2, 4, 6 -TCP. Evaluation of the hydrodechlorination parameters showed that the catalytic efficiency of the Pd/C catalysts was inhibited as the reaction proceeded due to the formation of HCl as by-product. A significant increase in the reaction rate was achieved when the reaction was performed in the presence of an inorganic base, which neutralized HC...|$|E
40|$|Thyroid hormones are {{essential}} for normal development, and for maintenance of normal physiological functions in vertebrates [1, 2]. In fish, thyroid hormones {{are involved in the}} control of osmoregulation, metabolism, somatic growth and post-hatching metamorphosis [1, 3, 4]. The regulation of thyroid hormone bioavailability in tissues and cells represents a very complex and unique web of feedback systems [2]. In fish and other vertebrates the thyroid cascade involves two components. First, thyroxine (T 4) biosynthesis and secretion are largely under central control by the brain–pituitary–thyroid axis [5]. Second, there is the conversion of T 4 to its biologically active form 3, 5, 3 -triiodothyronine (T 3) and its metabolism and receptor-mediated actions that seems largely to be under peripheral control in extra-thyroidal tissues [6]. The accumulation in the aquatic environment of anthropogenic chemicals, among which are endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) that alter normal hormonal regulation, is having dramatic consequences for humans and wildlife. Numerous chemicals disrupt thyroid homeostasis affecting thyroid hormone (TH) synthesis and transport, and cellular uptake and metabolism [7, 8]. Triclosan (TCS) is a synthetic <b>chlorinated</b> <b>phenolic</b> compound with a generalized use as an antimicrobial and preservative in many personal care and household products [9 - 11]. As a result of disposal of TCS through sewage systems and insufficient/variable removal by wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) [9], widespread contamination with TCS has been detected in several countries, particularly in aquatic ecosystems, WWTP influents and effluents; sludges and biosolids; surface or ground water; drinking water; and aquatic sediments [9 - 11]. TCS and its metabolites have been detected in tissues and body fluids of aquatic organisms including fish, revealing they are accumulating in the food chain [9 - 11] and TCS has also been detected in human blood, breast milk and urine [9 - 11]. The structural similarity of TCS with THs [9] suggest it may have adverse effects on the thyroid system. However, {{little is known about the}} mechanisms by which TCS disrupts the thyroid axis. TCS effects on fish thyroid axis have not been investigated. It is possible, that the TCS toxic effects reported in fish embryos, larvae and adults [9 - 11] might be caused, at least in part, through its effect on the thyroid system. We determined how TCS affect ontogenic variations of thyroid hormones in developing sheepshead minnow larvae. Knowing that thyroid hormones are involved in somatic growth and post-hatching metamorphosis, we also tested the hypothesis that TCS alter the development of these larvae. To do this, we used landmark-based geometric morphometric methods. These methods allowed us to analyse the pure shape variations of our developing larvae, regardless orientation, position, and size.
