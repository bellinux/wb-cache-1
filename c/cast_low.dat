5000|$|The {{character}} and Vallejo's casting, alongside the series itself, were first announced in September 2010. Created by Bevan Lee, the show {{focuses on the}} friendship between four females; consisting of Sophie, Frances, Jenny Gross (Melissa Bergland) and Bec Gilbert (Zoe Tuckwell-Smith). The quartet were labelled [...] "losers" [...] while at school and Lee {{said that it would}} explore how society carries their [...] "inner loser". Producers wanted the four characters to have chemistry and forced the actresses to spend time together {{in the early stages of}} production. Vallejo told Colin Vickery from The Daily Telegraph that it resulted in them [...] "really" [...] connecting and developing real friendships. The show's producer Maryanne Carroll told Michael Idato from The Sydney Morning Herald that it was not her team's intention to <b>cast</b> <b>low</b> profile artists in the lead roles. The [...] "crucial" [...] requirement was to have [...] "four girls with the right chemistry together"; and Carroll felt that there was [...] "something really magical" [...] about the dynamic Vallejo and her co-stars shared.|$|E
5000|$|The {{title of}} the song “Hum Dekhenge” or “We will see” is a promise. The promise of the poem is a promise {{that we will see}} a day where [...] "mountains of injustice" [...] are “blown away like cotton.” The poem goes on to {{describe}} that day, where the land rumbles like a heartbeat under the feet of the oppressed and lightning crackles over the heads of those in power. The poem's beginning deals with conventional themes such as injustice and oppression, then gives way to more overtly religious symbolism. Faiz writes that the idols will be lifted from the Kabah - the Kabah being the holiest site in Islam, located in Mecca. The poem goes on to describe a revolutionary inversion of power, where the pure hearted who were outlawed, or cast out, will be honoured and “seated on cushions.” The crowns (of those in power) will be thrown up in the air (alluding to a celebration) and their thrones will be <b>cast</b> <b>low.</b> The final stanza of the poem is the most religious in tone, declaring that the only name (essentially on people’s lips) will that be of Allah and a great revolutionary cry of “I am Truth” will go up and people of faith will rule again.|$|E

40|$|Polymer {{is among}} the {{favorite}} materials used for membrane separation as they are cheap, easily <b>cast,</b> <b>low</b> maintenance cost and commercially easy to get eventhough the material needs to be altered to meet the separation industry specific needs. There are two common issues in membrane preparation which are the produced sheet are too brittle and has no strength to withstand pressure during separation process and the porosity of the sheet sometimes not suitable with the gas kinetic diameter for the separation to occur. PEBAX or Poly ether block amide is the answer for the issues as this elastomer provides good mechanical strength from the hard segment of the crystalline poly amide block while the soft polyether will drive the separation process. This unique material can be casted either by phase inversion of the PEBAX itself with other polymer or by coating them on the other polymer substrate...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{characterize}} metallurgical and tribological events occurring at the articulating surfaces of all metal implants in order to gain understanding of the wear characteristics of Co-Cr-Mo alloys. The surfaces of fifteen implant heads (or balls), made of either <b>cast,</b> <b>low</b> carbon wrought or high carbon wrought Co-Cr-Mo material, were examined using scanning electron and atomic force microscopes. In the fast part of the study, six of the implants were examined prior to simulator testing, three after 3 million cycles of testing at 3 times body weight, and six after 6 million cycles of testing, also at 3 times body weight. In the second part of the study, the six implants that were examined prior to testing in the first part, were progressively wear tested at 5 times body weight and were periodically examined until 2 million cycles of testing.

40|$|Drying is {{a common}} {{pharmaceutical}} process, whose potential to modify the final drug and/or dosage form properties is often underestimated. In the present study, pellets consisting of the matrix former calcium stearate (CaSt) incorporating the active pharmaceutical ingredient ibuprofen were prepared via wet extrusion and spheronization. Subsequent drying was performed by either desiccation, fluid-bed drying, or lyophilization, and the final pellets were compared {{with respect to their}} microstructure. To minimize the effect of solute ibuprofen molecules on the shrinking behavior of the <b>CaSt,</b> <b>low</b> ibuprofen loadings were used, as ibuprofen is soluble in the granulation liquid. Pellet porosity and specific surface area increased during desiccation, fluid-bed drying, and lyophilization. The inlet-air temperature during fluid-bed drying affected the specific surface area, which increased at lower inlet-air temperatures rather than the pellet porosity. The in vitro dissolution profiles were found to be a nonlinear function of the specific surface area. Overall, the microstructure, including porosity, pore size, and specific surface area, of CaSt pellets was a strong function of the drying conditions...|$|E
40|$|The post-weld {{tempered}} microstructure {{of hybrid}} laser-arc welded CA 6 NM, a <b>cast</b> <b>low</b> carbon martensitic stainless steel, was investigated. The microstructural evolutions from the fusion zone {{to the base}} metal were characterized in detail using optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and microhardness techniques. The fusion zone, in its post-weld tempered condition, consisted of tempered lath martensite, residual delta-ferrite with various morphologies, reversed austenite and chromium carbides. The reversed austenite, which can be detected through both EBSD and XRD techniques, {{was found to be}} finely dispersed along the martensite lath boundaries, particularly at triple junctions. Based on the EBSD analysis, the orientation relationship between the reversed austenite and the adjacent martensite laths seemed to follow the Kurdjumov-Sachs (K-S) model. The results also revealed the presence of the reversed austenite in the different regions of the heat affected zone after post-weld tempering. The microindentation hardness distribution was measured, and correlated to the evolution of the corresponding microstructure across the welds. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Atherosclerosis {{preferentially}} develops {{at sites}} of disturbed blood flow. We tested {{the hypothesis that}} transglutaminase activity {{plays a role in}} plaque development at these locations. Methods and results: Exposure of endothelial cells to steady flow (7 dynes/cm(2)) was associated with relatively low transglutaminase activity, whereas under low oscillatory flow (1. 3 +/- 2. 6 dynes/cm(2)) endothelial cells showed a > 4 -fold higher level of transglutaminase activity. Under oscillatory flow, transglutaminase activity increased the expression of the chemokine MCP- 1 (CCL 2). In vivo, oscillatory flowwas induced by placement of a tapered perivascular cast around the carotid artery of type 2 transglutaminase (TGM 2) knockout mice and WT counterparts. After 2 days, significantly less monocytes adhered to the endothelium in TGM 2 knockout mice as compared to WT. In a more chronic setting, ApoE knockoutmice that were equipped with the flow-modifying cast developed lesions proximal to the <b>cast</b> (<b>low</b> shear stress), and distal to the cast (oscillatory shear stress). Inhibition of transglutaminase induced a marked reduction in macrophage and fat content in distal lesions only. In addition, lesion size was increased in this area, which was attributed to an increase in smooth muscle content. Conclusion: Oscillatory shear stress increases endothelial transglutaminase activity. In turn, transglutaminase activity affects the expression of MCP- 1 in vitro and monocyte recruitment in vivo. In a mouse model of atherosclerosis, transglutaminase activity has a major effect on plaque composition under oscillatory shear stress. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserve...|$|E

40|$|Effect of {{electro-magnetic}} stirring on {{soundness of}} continuously cast billets and slabs {{can be assessed}} by many methods like visual inspection of macro-etch & sulphur print evaluation. Ultrasonic assessment provides through thickness information of the test samples, whereas, macro-etching and sulphur print methods provide information in one plane only. An attempt {{has been made to}} evaluate the soundness (inhomogeneities / flaws as well as effect of columnar / equiaxed grains) of continuously <b>cast</b> <b>low</b> carbon and high carbon continuously cast billets by ultrasonic attenuation as well as high gain pulse-echo technique in transverse cut slices. One low carbon grade (Grade – LC) and one high carbon grades (Grade – HC) were selected for this purpose. Assessment of over all flaws / inhomogeneities was done by counting number of high gain internally reflected signals (flaw-echoes) using 6 MHz twin crystal probe. Using 10 MHz probe and attenuation technique (attenuation indicated by back-wall echo drop) was used to evaluate the overall macro-structure (including columnar / equiaxed grains as well as inhomogeneities / flaws). The result revealed no significant improvement in the equiaxed zone in case of low carbon grade billets (i. e. Grade – LC), whereas, there was significant improvement in the equiaxed zone of high carbon grade billets (Grade – HC). The ultrasonic flaws in the inclusion concentration bands in all the billets were found to decrease after electro-magnetic stirring. In low carbon billet, however, the flaws were found to increase in the central region after electro-magnetic stirring...|$|E
40|$|Studies {{the fatigue}} {{behaviour}} of Al- 7 Si- 0. 3 Mg sand cast alloys at varying iron levels and with beryllium and manganese trace additions {{and when the}} alloy is stircast and extruded. From the stress (S) -number of cycles to failure (N) -(S-N) curves {{it is observed that}} the presence of higher amount of iron (0. 76 %) in sand cast alloys leads to a shorter fatigue life. Beryllium and manganese additions to a higher iron containing alloy (0. 76 %) show better fatigue properties than low (0. 29 %) and high (0. 76 %) iron containing sand cast alloys, thus countering the detrimental effect of iron. The better fatigue life of beryllium and manganese added high iron alloy is due to the presence of (Be,Mn) -Fe phases only inside α-Al dendrites. The fatigue life of stircast and extruded low iron (0. 44 %) alloy is superior to sand <b>cast</b> <b>low</b> (0. 29 %) iron alloys. Observation of fractured surfaces reveals that porosity/inclusions is the high stress concentrating point where the crack originates (stage-I) and then propagates (stage-II) depending on the presence of the second phases. In the case of low iron alloys (sand and extruded stircast) a crack propagates along eutectic silicon, while in the high iron alloys a crack propagates through the brittle β-phase. In beryllium and manganese added alloys, even though a crack nucleates on the (Be,Mn) -Fe phase, it will be arrested as it approaches α-Al dendrites and hence, the crack has to propagate along silicon particles. The fractured surface of the stircast and extruded alloys has revealed fine fatigue fracture with striation as compared to sand cast alloys. This aspect of crack nucleation and propagation is explained schematically...|$|E
50|$|The {{stiletto}} hilt was {{die cast}} using zinc aluminium alloy, which exhibited the desirable characteristics of sharp <b>casting,</b> <b>low</b> shrinkage, low cost and above all, minimal use of strategic war-priority metals. However, over {{time it was}} discovered that the zinc ions in this alloy have a tendency to leach out, leaving the casting extremely brittle. As a result, {{more than half of the}} few Raider stilettos still in existence today have very fine hilt cracks or entire portions of the hilt missing with pieces having simply flaked off; many more have replacement handles. This decay can be delayed to some extent by coating the hilt with petroleum jelly.|$|R
