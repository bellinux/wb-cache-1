40|$|Abstract. Deductive {{databases}} need general formulas in rule bodies, {{not only}} <b>conjuctions</b> of literals. This {{is well known}} since the work of Lloyd and Topor about extended logic programming. Of course, formulas must be restricted {{in such a way}} that they can be effectively evaluated in finite time, and produce only a finite number of new tuples (in each iteration of the TP-operator: the fixpoint can still be infinite). It is also necessary to respect binding restrictions of built-in predicates: many of these predicates can be executed only when certain arguments are ground. Whereas for standard logic programming rules, questions of safety, allowedness, and range-restriction are relatively easy and well understood, the situation for general formulas is a bit more complicated. We give a syntactic analysis of formulas that guarantees the necessary properties. ...|$|R

It is found that intermediate-resolution spectroscopy and IUE archive spectra {{can be used to}} build radial-velocity curves which allow us to estimate the epoch of superior conjunction T 0 with an uncertainty of 0. 01 days. We present the data-reduction procedure and the method of analysis, based on fitting a sinusoid to the radial-velocity curve, discussing the accuracy of T 0 -value determinations and the possible sources of errors, notably those related to surface inhomogeneities, such as spots and faculae. The possibility of testing the hypothesis of a light-time effect for the orbital period modulation is also addressed by means of radial-velocity measurements...|$|R

40|$|A new {{paradigm}} {{that may be}} appropriate for uncovering speech perceptual codes is presented. Illusory words (e. g. (bijou, /bi[formula]u/) are detected (Experiments 1 and 2) or spontaneously identified (Experiment 3) by blending two dichotic stimuli (e. g. /bit[formula]-k[formula][formula]u/). According to the logic of illusory <b>conjuctions,</b> the speech property involved in such illusions must be separately registered as an independent entity {{in the course of}} the recognition process. In addition, the design allows comparison of different properties by the manipulation of the distribution of information between the two inputs (e. g. for initial consonant, /ki[formula]u-b[formula]t[formula]/; for first vowel /b[formula][formula]u-kit[formula]/). The results show that illusory word targets are more frequently experienced when the distribution corresponds to syllables than when it corresponds to either the initial consonant (and its phonetic features) of the first vowel. Illusory words are also more frequent when the distribution corresponds to syllables than when it does not correspond to any obvious phonological property (e. g. /b[formula]tu-ki[formula][formula]/). Moreover, in the identification task, illusory percepts only involve syllable combinations. These results extend previous observations of a major role of the syllable as a segmentation unit in French. © 1995 Academic Press. All rights reserved.

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is to {{communicate}} the basic laws of particle physics with Feynman diagrams - visual tools which represent elementary particle processes. They were originally developed as a code {{to be used by}} physicists and are still used today for calculations and elaborations of theoretical nature. The technical and mathematical rules of Feynman diagrams are obviously the exclusive concern of physicists, but on a pictorial level they can help to popularize many concepts, ranging from matter and the antimatter; the creation, destruction and transformation of particles; the role of ‘virtual’ particles in interactions; the conservation laws, symmetries, etc. Unlike the metaphors often used to describe the microcosm, these graphic representations provide an unequivocal translation of the physical content of the underlying quantum theory. As such they are perfect metaphors, not misleading constructions. A brief introduction on Feynman diagrams will be followed by the practical realization of this project, which will be carried out {{with the help of an}} experiment based on three-dimensional manipulable objects. The Feynman rules are expressed in terms of mechanical constraints on the possible <b>conjuctions</b> among the various elements of the experiment.

40|$|International audienceThe Region Connection Calculus (RCC), and {{particularly}} its RCC 8 subset, have been extensively studied {{and used for}} qualitative spatial reasoning. Some sets of computational operations have also been defined for topological relations, as the CM 8 set, that allows to compute the RCC 8 relationships on raster images. In this paper, we propose a reified representation of the RCC 8 spatial relationships and of the CM 8 primitives, within a lattice of concepts, implemented in OWL (Ontology Web Language) {{in order to help}} the interpretation of urban satellite images. Our approach allows for a straightforward representation of concepts corresponding to <b>conjuctions</b> or disjunctions of RCC 8 spatial relationships, and thus offers the advantage to overcome some drawbacks of the existing approaches in OWL, where spatial relations are represented as roles. Indeed, the OWL language does not allow the expression of the disjunction or of the conjunction of roles. We can then implement a reasoning on the RCC 8 relationships, which in particular allows to compute the composition table and its transitive closure. As the reification of roles precludes the use of role's properties, such as symmetry and transitivity, we propose to implement RCC 8 inferences through SWRL rules (Semantic Web Rule Language) ...|$|R
