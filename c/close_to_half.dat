5|$|Clock Tower was commercially successful, selling <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>half</b> {{a million}} copies. Kono {{attributed}} {{some of this}} success to Resident Evil generating interest in horror games {{and the success of}} the PlayStation. Critical reviews of Clock Tower were mixed. The game's horror atmosphere and storyline were praised, although most other aspects were found to be mediocre. Most of the negative critique was directed towards the game's slow pace, which was compared unfavorably to other PlayStation games of the era, particularly the more action-oriented and fast-paced Resident Evil. These factors influenced some critics to recommend Clock Tower purely for point-and-click adventure fans.|$|E
5|$|Human Entertainment {{soon began}} work on a sequel, Clock Tower (1996), also known as Clock Tower 2 in Japan. With a team of about 30 people, it was their first game to utilize a 3D {{graphics}} engine, although team veterans preferred to have used 2D graphics instead. With the announcement of Capcom's Resident Evil (1996) during development, the team was impressed and challenged themselves to create higher quality graphics. ASCII Entertainment marketed Clock Tower in North America {{as one of the}} first true horror games for the PlayStation console. It was released in Japan on 13 December 1996, North America on 1 October 1997, and finally in Europe in February 1998. The game sold <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>half</b> a million copies.

They demanded an 8-hour work day and support for the sick. Some worker demonstrations were joined by the students, who demanded an end to the policy of Russification. Another large strike occurred during the Labor Day on 1 May. It affected <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>half</b> of the city's industry.

From these pots, half (or as <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>half</b> as possible) competed in the first semi-final on 22 May 2012. The other half in that particular pot competed in the second semi-final on 24 May 2012.

For a 30-minute period in the first half the Irish forwards dominated, however the deadlock was broken <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>half</b> time when Bob Deans scored a try under the posts; Wallace converted the try giving the All Blacks a 5–0 half-time lead.

5|$|Amidst {{the flames}} and rubble, Arenberg's and Ferdinand's troops tried to storm the castle, but {{found their way}} blocked by masses of debris created by their own explosives. Furthermore, {{although}} <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>half</b> of the garrison had perished in the explosion and subsequent collapse of the fortifications, those who remained offered staunch resistance by throwing rocks on the approaching attackers, causing {{a large number of}} casualties. In frustration, 40 or 50 of the attackers tied together two ladders and crawled through the sluice-ways of the garderobe (latrines) that emptied on the hillside, thus gaining access to the interior of the castle. There they killed around 20 of the defenders in fierce fighting; the remaining defenders, approximately 70 men, among them Buchner and Sudermann, the garrison commander and his lieutenant, sought refuge in the castle's keep. In this way, Ferdinand's infantry at last gained unopposed access to the fortress. Storming the castle had taken about two hours.|$|E
5|$|Throughout 1943, the 2nd Division {{focused on}} {{rebuilding}} its ranks, having lost <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>half</b> its strength at Dieppe. In April 1943, Major General Guy Simonds assumed {{command of the}} division, taking over from Roberts, before handing over the following month to Major General Eedson Burns. In January 1944, Major General Charles Foulkes—the first officer to command the division who had not served in the Great War—replaced Burns. The following month, all three brigade commanders were replaced {{as part of a}} general move to modernize the Canadian forces' higher echelons; further sweeping changes throughout all levels of command, coupled with the lingering effects of the large influx of new personnel during 1943, lowered morale in the division. However, in March 1944, training again intensified, heralding the coming invasion of Europe. On 9March, the 2nd Division was inspected by King George VI, and by May the division numbered close to 18,000 fully equipped and trained soldiers. When D-Day arrived on 6June 1944, the main Canadian assault was led by the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division, while the 2nd Division was held in reserve. At this time, the division consisted of three brigades—4th, 5th and 6th—each of three infantry battalions, and a brigade ground defence platoon provided by Lorne Scots. In addition, at divisional level there was a machine gun battalion and a reconnaissance regiment provided by the Toronto Scottish Regiment (machine gun) and 8th Reconnaissance Regiment (14th Canadian Hussars), as well as various combat support and service support elements including field, anti-tank and anti-aircraft artillery, field engineers, electrical and mechanical engineers, and signals, medical, ordnance, service corps troops and provosts.|$|E
