40|$|Rationale and Objectives A {{survey was}} {{administered}} to fourth-year radiology residents after receiving their results from the first American Board of Radiology (ABR) Core examination in 2013. The purpose was to gather information regarding resources and study strategies to share with program directors and future resident classes. Materials and Methods An online survey was distributed to examinees nationwide. The survey included free-response and multiple choice questions that covered examination results, perceived value of enumerated study resources, case-based and didactic teaching conferences, board reviews, study materials for noninterpretive skills, multidisciplinary conference attendance, and free-form comments. Results Two hundred sixty-six of 1186 residents who took the Core examination responded to the survey. Some resources demonstrated {{a significant difference in}} perceived value between residents who passed the examination and residents who failed, including internal board reviews (1. 10, P <. 01), daily didactic conferences (1. 51, P <. 01), and daily case conferences (1. 43, P <. 01). Residents who passed reported that conferences and review sessions at their institutions were modified with multiple choice questions, audience response, and integration of <b>clinical</b> <b>physics</b> and patient safety topics compared to residents who failed. Conclusions Radiology residents and residency programs have adapted their preparations for the ABR Core examination in a variety of ways. Certain practices and study tools, including daily conferences and internal board reviews, had greater perceived value by residents who passed the examination than by residents who failed. This survey provides insights {{that can be used to}} assess and modify current preparation strategies for the ABR Core examination...|$|E

(1) (1) XIOS Hogeschool Limburg (2) Radiotherapie, Oncologisch Centrum, Universitair Ziekenhuis Brussel Introduction: Due to a particular method of dose delivery helical tomotherapy introduced some new quality assurance aspects. Traditional methods cannot always be applied in this setting {{and the development of}} new schedules is necessary. Some of the factors, such as machine output, should be checked daily. Unfortunately the IMRT measurements, used to check dose output, take about 50 minutes, which is a lot of time. That 2 ̆ 7 s why at the UZ Brussel a method was developed that uses the MVCT-detector of the machine, as well as the dose chamber output. It compares these values to reference values and takes about 200 seconds. The aim {{of this study was to}} relate these values to the actual IMRT measurements on phantom, making it possible to reduce QA time significantly. Method and materials: Both IMRT and detector measurements were performed during a period of six weeks. The IMRT measurement consists of 4 measurements with an A 1 SL ionization chamber (Standard Imaging, Madison, US) on a planned tomotherapy cheese phantom (Gammex RMI, Middleton, US), which include cylindrical off and on axis targets. Secondly the detector measurement was performed and a linear regression was calculated between the 5 parameters received from the procedure and the date from the IMRT measurements. Results: After 10 datasets were fed to the regression, the model was able to predict future measurements with a precision of 0. 5...|$|E

40|$|Quality {{assurance}} (QA) {{systems for}} intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) have become standard tools in modern <b>clinical</b> medical <b>physics</b> departments. However, because formalized industry standards or recommendations from professional societies {{have yet to}} be defined, methods of IMRT QA analysis vary from institution to institution. Understanding where matters stand today is an important step toward improving the effectiveness of IMRT QA and developing standards. We therefore conducted an IMRT QA survey. This particular survey was limited to users of an electronic two-dimensional diode array device, but we took care to keep the questions as general and useful as possible. The online survey polled institutions (one survey per institution) on a collection of questions about methods of IMRT QA. The topics were general to the IMRT QA analysis methods common to all IMRT systems; none of the questions was vendor- or product-specific. Survey results showed that a significant proportion of responding institutions (32. 8 %) use the single-gantry-angle composite method for IMRT Q...|$|R

50|$|In the United States, {{radiation}} oncologists undergo {{four years}} of residency (in addition to an internship), which is more dedicated oncology training than any other specialty. Currently, radiation oncology is the most competitive specialty for graduating medical students to obtain training in. During the four year post-graduate training, residents learn about <b>clinical</b> oncology, the <b>physics</b> and biology of ionizing radiation, and the treatment of cancer patients with radiation. After completion of this training, a radiation oncologist may undergo certification by either the American Board of Radiology (ABR) or the American Board of Physician Specialties (ABPS) for M.D. degree holders or the American Osteopathic Board of Radiology (AOBR) for D.O. degree holders. Board certification includes a written test and a practical oral exam. Successfully passing these tests leads to the granting of a 10-year, time limited, board certification for ABR diplomates or an 8-year, time limited, board certification for ABPS diplomates. Recertification is obtained via a series of continuing medical education and practice qualifications including a written exam, clinical practice parameter evaluation, continuing medical education credits, and meeting community practice standards.|$|R
40|$|Dose {{planning}} for prostate radiation therapy {{is performed using}} computed tomography (CT) scans that provide the electron density information needed for individual patients’ radiation dose calculations. For visualising the prostate and determining the target volume for radiation treatment, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) gives vastly superior soft-tissue contrast. However, currently, MRI scans cannot be used for dose planning, as they do not provide the electron density information. We aimed to develop an alternative and efficient MRI-only image-based workflow, enabling both organ delineation and dose planning to be performed using MRI, with “pseudo-CT scans” generated from MRI scans supplying the information for dose planning. The feasibility of implementing MRI-based prostate radiation therapy planning is being investigated through collaboration between the <b>clinical</b> and medical <b>physics</b> group at the Calvary Mater Newcastle Hospital/University of Newcastle and the biomedical imaging processing group at the CSIRO (Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation) Australian e-Health Research Centre. Results comparing Hounsfield units calculated from CT scans and from MRI-based pseudo-CT scans for 39 patients showed very similar average values for the prostate, bladder, bones and rectum, confirming that pseudo-CT scans can replace CT scans for accurate radiation dose calculations. MRI-based radiotherapy planning {{can also be used}} for tumours in other locations, such as head and neck, and breast cancers...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: There is {{a general}} inquisition {{regarding}} the monetary value of a research output, as {{a substantial amount of}} funding in modern academia is essentially awarded to good research presented in the form of journal articles, conference papers, performances, compositions, exhibitions, books and book chapters etc., which, eventually leads to another question if the value varies across different disciplines. Answers to these questions will not only assist academics and researchers, but will also help higher education institutions (HEIs) make informed decisions in their administrative and research policies. Design and methodology: To examine both the questions, we applied the United Kingdom’s recently concluded national research assessment exercise known as the Research Excellence Framework (REF) 2014 as a case study. All the data for this study is sourced from the openly available publications which arose from the digital repositories of REF’s results and HEFCE’s funding allocations. Findings: A world leading output earns between £ 7504 and £ 14, 639 per year within the REF cycle, whereas an internationally excellent output earns between £ 1876 and £ 3659, varying according to their area of research. Secondly, an investigation into the impact rating of 25315 journal articles submitted in five areas of research by UK HEIs and their awarded funding revealed a linear relationship between the percentage of quartile-one journal publications and percentage of 4 * outputs in <b>Clinical</b> Medicine, <b>Physics</b> and Psychology/Psychiatry/Neuroscience UoAs, and no relationship was found in the Classics and Anthropology/Development Studies UoAs, {{due to the fact that}} most publications in the latter two disciplines are not journal articles. Practical implications: The findings provide an indication of the monetary value of a research output, from the perspectives of government funding for research, and also what makes a good output, i. e. whether a relationship exists between good quality output and the source of its publication. The findings may also influence future REF submission strategies in HEIs and ascertain that the impact rating of the journals is not necessarily a reflection of the quality of research in every discipline, and this may have a significant influence on the future of scholarly communications in general.

40|$|Purpose. The {{estimated}} new {{cancer patient}} load in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh is 0. 1 – 0. 12 million per year. Approximately {{two thirds of}} these require treatment by a radiation oncologist. Radiation oncologists: cancer patient ratio in this state is 1 [*]:[*] 2000 {{as compared to the}} recommended 1 [*]:[*] 250. This problem is compounded by the poor infrastructure of radiation oncology departments in the state which is suboptimal for teaching, training of resident doctors, and treatment in most barring a few departments. To bridge some gap in the sociodemographics stated above and enhancement of training of residents, we submitted a project for establishment of a telemedicine facility in our department to the Department of Science and Technology, Government of India. We present the design, implementation, and a two-year audit of our tele-education activities. Materials and Methods. After the sanction of the project, we established telemedicine linkage with another medical institute in the city located 25 [*]kms away in 2007. After implementation of the project, academic sessions designed for trainee residents in our department were shared with the remote end. A record of these activities and a feedback of the activities were audited at the end of 2 years of implementation of this project. Results. Regular videoconferencing sessions comprising of lectures on <b>clinical</b> oncology, medical <b>physics,</b> and radiobiology were held.
