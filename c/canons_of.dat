5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} his recovery, Zwingli's opponents remained in the minority. When a vacancy occurred among the <b>canons</b> <b>of</b> the Grossmünster, Zwingli was elected to fulfill that vacancy on 29 April 1521. In becoming a canon, he became a full citizen of Zurich. He also retained his post as the people's priest of the Grossmünster.|$|E
5|$|Stone-carved sarcophagi {{from the}} Crusader period are visible west of Mailla Pool among the tombs of the {{historical}} Mamilla cemetery, probably {{the remains of a}} cemetery of the Augustinian <b>canons</b> <b>of</b> the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.|$|E

50|$|He was a Catholic priest, <b>Canon</b> <b>of</b> Gniezno, Dean of the łęczyca {{province}} and in Łowicz, <b>Canon</b> <b>of</b> Kraków, Auxiliary Bishop of Kraków, from 1578-1586.|$|R
5|$|York {{is noted}} for its {{numerous}} churches and pubs. Most of the remaining churches in York are from the medieval period. St William's College behind the Minster, and Bedern Hall, off Goodramgate, are former dwelling places of the <b>canons</b> <b>of</b> the York Minster.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} of his namesake Nicholas, Bishop of Dunblane (and former Abbot of Arbroath), Nicholas de Balmyle was among the <b>canons</b> <b>of</b> Dunblane with the {{responsibility}} of selecting a successor. Bishop Nicholas had died sometime between 1306 (after his last attestation on 26 January) and late 1307. The election was done by compromissarii (a short-list of canons delegated to perform election), with John, Abbot of Arbroath excluded from the vote, perhaps because of his known pro-English tendencies.|$|E
5|$|In the Middle Ages {{there was}} {{considerable}} variation in the nomination of the archbishop and other bishops. At various times the choice {{was made by the}} <b>canons</b> <b>of</b> Canterbury Cathedral, the king of England, or the Pope. Since the Reformation, the church is explicitly a state church and the choice is legally that of the British crown; today it is made {{in the name of the}} monarch by the Prime Minister, from a shortlist of two selected by an ad hoc committee called the Crown Nominations Commission.|$|E
50|$|John King DD (d. 2 January 1638) was a <b>Canon</b> <b>of</b> Windsor from 1625 to 1638 and a <b>Canon</b> <b>of</b> Westminster from 1613 to 1638.|$|R

50|$|William Pye (died 1557) was Dean of Chichester from 1553 to 1557, a <b>Canon</b> <b>of</b> Westminster from 1554 - 1556, and a <b>Canon</b> <b>of</b> Windsor in 1557.|$|R
5|$|The Alpine Spaniel {{was one of}} {{the direct}} genetic {{progenitors}} to the St. Bernard. Starting in 1830, the monks and <b>canons</b> <b>of</b> the Swiss Alps began crossing the dogs with the Newfoundland, expecting that the resulting offspring would have the longer hair of the Newfoundland and this would protect the dogs better from the cold. Unfortunately ice would form on the longer hair, and seeing that the dogs were no longer effective rescue dogs, the monasteries gave them away to people in the surrounding Swiss valleys.|$|E
5|$|Under John, {{the monks}} of Bath became {{known for their}} scholarship, {{although}} he was not particularly noted for learning. William of Malmsebury claimed he was generous and affable, although the chronicler acknowledged that the bishop treated the <b>canons</b> <b>of</b> Wells abominably. William also recorded that John was a heavy drinker and not given to self-restraint, but that his health was good and he lived to be old. At first he treated the monks at Bath with contempt and confiscated much of the lands of the abbey for his own use, but in 1106 he restored their lands to them. John's <b>canons</b> <b>of</b> Wells disliked him because he reduced their income and destroyed some of their buildings {{as part of the}} movement of the see to Bath. A layman official of the diocese, Hildebert, was probably John's brother; and he held the offices of steward of the diocese and was also the provost of Wells, an inheritable office. John gave much of the revenues of Wells to Hildebert. Another relative, a nephew also named John, was named archdeacon in the diocese.|$|E
5|$|Alpine spaniels {{were kept}} by the <b>canons</b> <b>of</b> the monasteries in the Alps in order to search for {{travellers}} during heavy snow storms, including the Great St. Bernard Hospice in the Great St Bernard Pass between Italy and Switzerland. The dogs would be dispatched in pairs to search for fallen travellers, and were trained so that upon finding them {{would return to the}} canons in order to lead rescuers back to the unfortunate individuals. The Alpine breed was also used as a watchdog to guard sheep and cattle of mountainous regions, including the Himalayas.|$|E
50|$|Jakub Milewski of Jastrzębiec {{coat of arms}} was a Catholic priest, <b>Canon</b> <b>of</b> Gniezno, Dean of the Łęczyca and Łowicz, <b>Canon</b> <b>of</b> Kraków and Auxiliary Bishop of Kraków.|$|R
50|$|Cassone was {{appointed}} <b>canon</b> <b>of</b> Cividale in 1296. When the della Torre {{were able to}} return to Milan in 1302, Cassone {{was appointed}} <b>canon</b> <b>of</b> the Cathedral of Milan.|$|R
50|$|He became Rector of Tarrant Gunville in 1620; <b>Canon</b> <b>of</b> Sarum in 1625; Rector of North Moreton in 1634; Rector of Manston in 1635; and <b>Canon</b> <b>of</b> Winchester in 1660.|$|R
5|$|Although {{there is}} no {{reliable}} documentation of the demographic impact of the Black Death in Scotland, there are some indications of the immediate effects of the plague. Walter Bower recorded that 24, about a third, of the <b>canons</b> <b>of</b> St. Andrews died during the outbreak. There are also anecdotal references to abandoned land in the following decades. If the pattern followed that in England, then the population may have fallen to as low as half a million {{by the end of}} the fifteenth century. Compared with the distribution of population after the later Clearances and the Industrial Revolution, these numbers would have been relatively evenly spread over the kingdom, with roughly half living north of the River Tay.|$|E
5|$|In 1067 Great Bolton was the {{property}} of Roger de Poitou and after 1100, of Roger de Meresheys. It became {{the property}} of the Pilkingtons who forfeited it in the Civil War and after that the Stanleys who became Earls of Derby. Great Bolton and Little Bolton were part of the Marsey fee, in 1212 Little Bolton was held by Roger de Bolton as plough-land, by the service of the twelfth part of a knight's fee to Randle de Marsey. The parish church in Bolton has an early foundation although the exact date is unknown; it was given by the lord of the manor to the Gilbertine <b>canons</b> <b>of</b> Mattersey Priory in Nottinghamshire, founded by Roger de Marsey.|$|E
5|$|In late 1518, {{the post}} of the Leutpriestertum (people's priest) of the Grossmünster at Zurich became vacant. The <b>canons</b> <b>of</b> the {{foundation}} that administered the Grossmünster recognised Zwingli's reputation as a fine preacher and writer. His connection with humanists was a decisive factor as several canons were sympathetic to Erasmian reform. In addition, {{his opposition to the}} French and to mercenary service was welcomed by Zurich politicians. On 11 December 1518, the canons elected Zwingli to become the stipendiary priest and on 27 December he moved permanently to Zurich.|$|E
50|$|In 1906 Barnett {{moved from}} <b>Canon</b> <b>of</b> Bristol Cathedral to <b>Canon</b> <b>of</b> Westminster Abbey. At the {{coronation}} of King George V in 1911, Barnett's {{role was to}} carry the royal orb.|$|R

50|$|He {{was then}} Rector of Pulham at St. Mary Magdalene, 1917-1927, Archdeacon of Norfolk, 1920-1934, Residentiary <b>Canon</b> <b>of</b> Norwich, 1927-1934, and Honorary <b>Canon</b> <b>of</b> Norwich, 1935. He visited China and Japan in 1908.|$|R
5|$|It has {{traditionally}} been held in Osney that the church was founded in the reign of Stephen, but this {{is unlikely to be}} true, as Thomas Becket was not martyred until some fifteen years after Stephen's death. It is known that in the 1180s, the site was granted to the <b>canons</b> <b>of</b> the nearby Osney Abbey, and a chapel was erected on the site around 1190. From the mid-13th century the Osney area was referred to as the parish of St Thomas', but it remained nominally a chapel of the abbey until the dissolution of the Monasteries under Henry VIII, when it was placed under Christ Church, Oxford. Christ Church treated it as a conventional parish church with a curate, and from the mid-19th century the incumbent was styled a vicar.|$|E
5|$|Przemysł II {{was born}} on 14 October 1257 in Poznań as the fifth child and only son of Duke Przemysł I of Greater Poland and his wife Elisabeth, {{daughter}} of Duke Henry II the Pious of Silesia. It is known that {{he was born in}} the morning, because according to the Chronicle of Greater Poland, when Dowager Duchess Elisabeth gave birth to a son, the vicars and <b>canons</b> <b>of</b> the city were singing morning prayers. At the news of the birth, the local clergy chanted the Te Deum laudamus. Shortly after his birth, the prince was baptized by the Bishop of Poznań, Bogufał III.|$|E
5|$|The {{first years}} of the reign of the minor Ladislaus IV were {{characterized}} by armed conflicts between parties of the leading noble families. Although Roland Borsa, voivode in 1282 and between 1284 and 1294, was initially among the nobles assisting the king in consolidating royal power, he himself became the source of new conflicts. First he prevented the <b>canons</b> <b>of</b> the Gyulafehérvár Chapter from collecting their income in 1289. Next he unlawfully compelled noblemen and Saxon landowners in Transylvania to accommodate him and his retinue. Later Borsa fought the bishop of Várad (Oradea) and even resisted King Andrew III who besieged him in the fortress of Adorján (Adrian) at Szalárd (Sălard) for three months in 1294.|$|E
25|$|It {{incorporated}} the change made by John XXIII in 1962, when he {{inserted into the}} <b>canon</b> <b>of</b> the Mass the name of Saint Joseph, the first change for centuries in the <b>canon</b> <b>of</b> the Mass.|$|R
5000|$|He {{became a}} <b>canon</b> <b>of</b> Worms Cathedral in 1609, and was ordained {{as a priest}} in 1610. [...] He became a <b>canon</b> <b>of</b> Mainz Cathedral in 1612. He became the dean of Speyer Cathedral in 1622.|$|R
50|$|In 1487, {{he became}} a <b>canon</b> <b>of</b> the Cathedral of Trier. He began studies in Paris in 1488. In 1503, he was made cantor of the Cathedral of Trier and also became a <b>canon</b> <b>of</b> Mainz Cathedral.|$|R
5|$|Warelwast's {{relations}} with his cathedral chapter were good, and no disputes arose during his episcopate. It {{was not until}} late in his bishopric that the diocese was split into multiple archdeaconries, which appears to have happened in 1133. Warelwast instituted the two offices of treasurer and precentor for the cathedral chapter, {{as well as the}} first sub-archdeacons, who were under the archdeacons. Sub-archdeacons are not attested again at Exeter until the episcopate of Bartholomew Iscanus, who was bishop from 1161–1184. William of Malmesbury felt that during Warelwast's episcopate the cathedral chapter relaxed its communal living, which previously had been strong. It is likely that during Warelwast's episcopate the <b>canons</b> <b>of</b> the cathedral chapter quit living in a communal dormitory.|$|E
5|$|At {{the very}} {{beginning}} of his reign, he deemed it proper to promulgate by law the Church's belief in the Trinity and the Incarnation; and to threaten all heretics with the appropriate penalties; whereas he subsequently declared that he intended to deprive all disturbers of orthodoxy of the opportunity for such offense by due process of law. He made the Nicaeno-Constantinopolitan creed the sole symbol of the Church and accorded legal force to the <b>canons</b> <b>of</b> the four ecumenical councils. The bishops in attendance at the Second Council of Constantinople in 553 recognized that nothing could be done in the Church contrary to the emperor's will and command, while, on his side, the emperor, {{in the case of the}} Patriarch Anthimus, reinforced the ban of the Church with temporal proscription. Justinian protected the purity of the church by suppressing heretics. He neglected no opportunity for securing the rights of the Church and clergy, for protecting and extending monasticism. He granted the monks the right to inherit property from private citizens and the right to receive solemnia or annual gifts from the Imperial treasury or from the taxes of certain provinces and he prohibited lay confiscation of monastic estates.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{probably}} {{spent some}} of his earliest years in his mother's household, and accompanied Matilda to Normandy in the late 1130s. Henry's later childhood, probably {{from the age of}} seven, was spent in Anjou, where he was educated by Peter of Saintes, a noted grammarian of the day. In late 1142, Geoffrey decided to send the nine-year-old to Bristol, the centre of Angevin opposition to Stephen in the south-west of England, accompanied by Robert of Gloucester. Although having children educated in relatives' households was common among noblemen of the period, sending Henry to England also had political benefits, as Geoffrey was coming under criticism for refusing to join the war in England. For about a year, Henry lived alongside Roger of Worcester, one of Robert's sons, and was instructed by a magister, Master Matthew; Robert's household was known for its education and learning. The <b>canons</b> <b>of</b> St Augustine's in Bristol also helped in Henry's education, and he remembered them with affection in later years. Henry returned to Anjou in either 1143 or 1144, resuming his education under William of Conches, another famous academic.|$|E
50|$|On 16 January 2005, Wilkes {{was made}} an Honorary Ecumenical <b>Canon</b> <b>of</b> Ripon Cathedral by John Packer, the Bishop of Ripon and Leeds. He {{was the first}} Methodist {{minister}} to become a <b>canon</b> <b>of</b> that Anglican cathedral.|$|R
50|$|In 1703/4, {{his uncle}} Lothar Franz sent him as envoy for the Archbishopric of Mainz to the {{imperial}} court at Vienna. He became a <b>canon</b> <b>of</b> Würzburg Cathedral in 1704, and a <b>canon</b> <b>of</b> Bamberg Cathedral in 1705.|$|R
