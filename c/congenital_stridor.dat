40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{congenital}} myasthenic syndromes (CMS) are a {{group of}} genetic disorders of neuromuscular transmission causing fatigable weakness. Symptoms may be present from birth, but diagnosis is often delayed for several years, notably in post-synaptic CMS due to mutations in the DOK 7 gene. Recently, we noted a subgroup of children with CMS in whom <b>congenital</b> <b>stridor</b> and bilateral vocal cord palsy predated other symptoms. All had mutations in the DOK 7 gene. The {{purpose of this study}} was to review our population of DOK 7 CMS patients with <b>congenital</b> <b>stridor</b> and assess whether there were other phenotypic features which might raise suspicion of a diagnosis of CMS in the neonatal period, in the absence of limb weakness and ptosis and prompt earlier referral for neurophysiological investigation, genetic diagnosis and appropriate treatment. METHODS: A retrospective case review of 11 DOK 7 CMS patients at a tertiary referral centre. RESULTS: Six patients were identified with DOK 7 mutations and <b>congenital</b> <b>stridor,</b> four requiring intubation soon after birth. Four patients had a diagnosis of bilateral vocal cord palsy and three required tracheostomy, successfully decannulated in one after 3 years. All six patients had difficulty with feeding, with weak suck and swallow necessitating nasogastric feeding in five, two of whom required gastrostomy. Despite all six children having had neonatal symptoms, the mean age at CMS diagnosis was 5 years and 9 months. CONCLUSION: CMS, particularly caused by mutations in the DOK 7 gene, is a rare but treatable cause of <b>congenital</b> <b>stridor</b> in the neonate. A combination of <b>congenital</b> <b>stridor,</b> especially with an apparently idiopathic bilateral vocal cord palsy and weak suck and swallow should alert the clinician to the possibility of CMS and prompt early referral for neurophysiology and genetic investigations. Confirmation of a CMS diagnosis enables treatment to be initiated, informed management of the VCP and anticipation of myasthenic symptoms, particularly life-threatening respiratory decompensation. Treatment may allow early decannulation or possible avoidance of tracheostomy. At least 12 genes are known to cause CMS; the presence of <b>congenital</b> <b>stridor</b> may help target genetic diagnosis...|$|E
40|$|Congenital {{laryngeal}} stridor {{is known}} as a separate disorder for 1, 5 centuries. Its diagnostics presents difficulties because of its absense (over prevalence of mild cases) or very expensive and hard-to-reach diagnostic methods. This article represents the results of investigation and treatment of 369 patients with congenital noisy breathing. High frequency in population is revealed (4 % totally and more than 40 % of all cases of <b>congenital</b> <b>stridor).</b> We offer some new approaches (clinical, lab, X-ray and morphologic) and modified design of diagnostics that appears to be available, inexpensive and effective.

40|$|Any site in {{the upper}} airway can get {{obstructed}} and cause noisy breathing as well as dyspnea. These include nasal causes such as choanal atresia or nasal stenosis; pharyngeal causes including lingual thyroid; laryngeal causes such as laryngomalacia; tracheobronchial causes such as tracheal stenosis; and subglottic stenosis. Lesions in the oropharynx may cause stertor, while lesions in the laryngotracheal tree will cause stridor. Subglottic stenosis is the third leading cause of <b>congenital</b> <b>stridors</b> in the neonate. Subglottic Stenosis presents challenges to the anesthesiologist. Therefore, It is imperative to perform a detailed history, physical examination, and characterization of the extent and severity of stenosis. Rigid endoscopy {{is essential for the}} preoperative planning of any of the surgical procedures {{that can be used for}} correction. Choice of operation is dependent on the surgeon&#x 2032;s comfort, postoperative capabilities, and severity of disease. For high-grade stenosis, single-stage laryngotracheal resection or cricotracheal resection are the best options. It has to be borne in mind that the goal of surgery is to allow for an adequate airway for normal activity without the need for tracheostomy. Anesthesia for airway surgery could be conducted safely with either sevofl uraneor propofol-based total intravenous anesthesia...|$|R
40|$|<b>Congenital</b> {{laryngeal}} <b>stridor</b> (CLS) and laryngomalacia are terms used {{to describe}} a common disorder characterized by onset, at or soon after birth, of a harsh respiratory sound mostly audible during inspiration. Typically, laryngoscopy reveals flaccid supraglottic struc tures which tend to prolapse medially toward the glottis during inspiration. Despite reports of this disorder {{dating back to the}} mid- 19 th century, specific etiolog) - and pathogenesis remain nebulous. Analysis of findings in 30 infants indicate that there are often associated manifestations of delayed development in neuromuscular control. Associated findings include gastroesophageal reflux, obstructive and cen tral apnea, hypotonia, failure to thrive, and pneumonitis. A retrospective review of relevant medical literature along with results of laryngeal dissections and analysis of clinical findings in the 30 cases leads to the conclusion that CLS may be a mild form of localized hypotonia rather than an isolated idiopathic type of anatomic abnormality...|$|R
40|$|Stridor is {{the sound}} caused by {{abnormal}} air passage into the lungs and can exist in different degrees and be caused by obstruction located anywhere in the extra-thoracic (nose, pharynx, larynx, trachea) or intra-thoracic airway (tracheobronchial tree). <b>Stridor</b> may be <b>congenital</b> or acquired, acute, intermittent or chronic. Laryngotracheal inflammation (croup) {{is the most common}} cause of acute stridor. Laryngotracheomalacia is {{the most common cause of}} <b>congenital,</b> chronic <b>stridor.</b> Stridor is a clinical sign and not a diagnosis. The golden standard in the workup of stridor is an upper and lower airway endoscopy under general anaesthesia. Endoscopic examination under general anaesthesia requires a multidisciplinary approach and close cooperation between anaesthesiologist, paediatrician, ENT surgeon and nursing staff. Following this procedure, a place in the intensive care unit should be available for those cases presenting with stridor in which a definite diagnosis could not yet be established. Although important, pre-endoscopy assessment including history, physical examination and radiological examination, is only a guide to the type and degree of pathology found during endoscopy. About 1 out of 10 infants are found to have lesions in more than one anatomical site of the upper aerodigestive tract. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{clinical}} {{relevance of}} posterior laryngeal clefts (PLCs) of type 1 {{has only recently}} been highlighted in the medical literature. We present {{a review of the}} literature and a report of a contributive series of 31 type 1 PLC patients. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed a MEDLINE search of studies published between 1966 and September 2005 and a retrospective cohort study in children aged 0 to 16 years. RESULTS: In the reviewed articles as well as in the presented study, a high degree of comorbidity in patients with PLC type 1 is reported. The majority of patients (90 %) with severe problems with oral feedings were treated conservatively by means of nasogastric tube feeding. CONCLUSIONS: Increased awareness improves the chances of an accurate diagnosis of type 1 PLC in patients with <b>congenital</b> <b>stridor.</b> Type 1 PLC may be present in all patients with <b>congenital</b> <b>stridor</b> and laryngomalacia, particularly when stridor is accompanied by symptoms such as feeding difficulties and choking...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Vallecular cysts are {{an unusual}} cause of <b>congenital</b> <b>stridor.</b> OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} the imaging findings in five patients, {{with emphasis on}} the usefulness of sonographic studies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 1990 and 2007, five patients with a cystic lesion situated in the anterior neck, at the vallecular space, were seen in our institution. Clinical records and imaging findings were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: All patients presented with persistent inspiratory stridor that was present from {{the first week of}} life. Neck US was performed as part of the investigations in four and showed a vallecular cyst. The diagnosis was confirmed with flexible bronchoscopy in four infants and CT in one; all were resected. Pathology showed a multilayered epithelial border with normal thickness and differentiation; there were no signs of malignancy. CONCLUSION: Although vallecular cysts are very rare, they should be considered in the differential diagnosis of <b>congenital</b> <b>stridor.</b> When the commonest causes have been ruled out, neck US may be diagnostic. The diagnosis can be confirmed with flexible bronchoscopy or further imaging such as CT or MRI. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|BackgroundCongenital vocal cord {{paralysis}} (VCP) is {{a common}} cause of <b>congenital</b> <b>stridor.</b> Before the widespread application of flexible bronchoscopy (FB) by pediatricians, <b>congenital</b> <b>stridor</b> in infants was usually attributed to laryngomalacia. Prompt recognition and careful follow-up is crucial {{for the management of}} congenital VCP. MethodsWe performed a retrospective chart review of newborn infants with congenital VCP diagnosed by FB over a 12 -year period. ResultsDuring the 12 -year period, FB was performed on a total of 356 infants. Fifteen (4 %) infants were diagnosed with congenital VCP. There were eight males and seven females and the mean age at diagnosis was 76. 6 days. Stridor with respiratory distress was the most prominent presenting symptom. The majority (93 %, 14 / 15) demonstrated bilateral VCP, while one patient (7 %) had unilateral VCP. Seven of the 15 (46 %) patients had idiopathic VCP, while eight (54 %) had VCP associated with neuromuscular disorders. Tracheotomy was necessary in four patients (26 %). None of them underwent further surgical interventions. Spontaneous recovery occurred in 10 patients (71 %), and of these, 90 % (9 / 10) were treated without tracheotomy. ConclusionIn order to allow prompt diagnosis of congenital VCP, FB should be performed in every newborn infant with stridor. Patients with congenital VCP should undergo additional imaging studies to detect any associated neurological abnormalities and intrathoracic comorbidities. The majority of patients can be managed conservatively and monitored carefully using serial FB. Corrective surgery should be reserved for those with a lack of resolution at prolonged follow-up, and those with significant comorbidities...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION Turbulent flow due to partial {{obstruction}} of the airway {{gives rise to}} abnormal or unwanted noise. Noise originating in the larynx or trachea is typically high-pitched and termed ‘stridor’. Laryngomalacia {{is the most common}} <b>congenital</b> cause of <b>stridor</b> in infants. In this study, we have analysed the cases of stridor and abnormal cry in infants that have presented to our institute over a span of one year. AIM To identify the causes of stridor and abnormal cry in infants presenting to our institute. MATERIALS AND METHODS This is a retrospective study of 50 cases of stridor and abnormal cry in infants that presented at a Tertiary Care ENT Hospital in South India from Jan 2015 to Dec 2015. Children below the age of 12 months that presented to our department with stridor and abnormal cry were included in our study. RESULTS The cases were evaluated in terms of Age, Sex ratio, Aetiology and Presenting features and statistically analysed. CONCLUSION The sheer volume of paediatric cases presenting with airway problems and other disease entities necessitates the need for establishment of a dedicated Paediatric ENT wing in every Tertiary Care Hospital...|$|R
40|$|AbstractLaryngomalacia is {{the most}} {{frequent}} congenital abnormality of the larynx, accounting for approximately 60 - 75 % of <b>congenital</b> <b>stridor</b> cases. Despite its benign and self-limited aspects, 10 % of cases require intervention. Currently, supraglottoplasty is considered the standard treatment of severe laryngomalacia. ObjectiveTo describe {{the experience of the}} authors in the surgical treatment of patients with severe laryngomalacia. Methodology: A retrospective study. MethodThe medical records of 11 consecutive cases of severe laryngomalacia who underwent surgical treatment between 2003 and 2012 were analyzed for age, gender, symptoms, associated diseases, surgical technique employed, extubation time, surgical complications, length of hospital stay and clinical outcome. ResultsOf the 11 cases of severe laryngomalacia, six patients (54. 5 %) were operated with the use of CO 2 laser and five patients (45. 5 %) were submitted to the cold technique. Only 1 patient (9. 1 %) required surgical reintervention. There were no cases of surgical complications. All patients had clinical improvement.

40|$|Laryngomalacia is {{the most}} common cause of stridor in newborns, {{affecting}} 45 – 75 % of all infants with <b>congenital</b> <b>stridor.</b> The spectrum of disease presentation, progression, and outcomes is varied. Identifying symptoms and patient factors that influence disease severity helps predict outcomes. Findings. Infants with stridor who do not have significant feeding-related symptoms can be managed expectantly without intervention. Infants with stridor and feeding-related symptoms benefit from acid suppression treatment. Those with additional symptoms of aspiration, failure to thrive, and consequences of airway obstruction and hypoxia require surgical intervention. The presence of an additional level of airway obstruction worsens symptoms and has a 4. 5 x risk of requiring surgical intervention, usually supraglottoplasty. The presence of medical comorbidities predicts worse symptoms. Summary. Most with laryngomalacia will have mild-to-moderate symptoms and not require surgical intervention. Those with gastroesophageal reflux and/or laryngopharyngeal reflux have symptom improvement from acid suppression therapy. Those with severe enough disease to require supraglottoplasty will have minimal complications and good outcomes if multiple medical comorbidities are not present.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundLaryngomalacia is {{the term}} most widely used to {{describe}} the “inward collapse of supraglottic structures of the larynx during inspiration”. It is considered to be {{the most common cause of}} <b>congenital</b> <b>stridor.</b> Laryngomalacia usually presents by high pitched inspiratory stridor which is often present at birth and is usually noticed by 2 weeks of age. Stridor in laryngomalacia is usually positionally dependent and is worse at times of increased work of breathing. Diagnosis depends mainly on visualization of the larynx during respiration. Spontaneous resolution of symptoms is the rule, it usually occurs by the age of 2 – 5 years. Surgical intervention is indicated only in severe cases of laryngomalacia. AimThe aim of this study was to assess clinical presentation, management and prognosis of infants and children suffering from laryngomalacia presented to our department in the period of 5 years. MethodsThe medical sheath records of newborns and infants suffering of laryngomalacia were reviewed regarding demographic data, clinical presentation, diagnosis and management. ResultsFifty eight infant and child were included in the study. They were 33 males (57 %) and 25 females (43 %). Their age at presentation ranged from 2 to 13 months with mean age of 6. 3 months. Diagnosis was done using laryngoscopy under general anesthesia with spontaneous breathing in 49 patients (85 %) and by using flexible nasopharyngolaryngoscopy under topical anesthesia in 9 patients (15 %). Conservative treatment was given for all cases in the form of diet modification, lansoprazole (7. 5 mg once daily) and Domperidone (1 mg/kg/day). For mild cases, gradual improvement occurred within 1 to 3 months. For severe cases, surgical intervention was planned. Indications for surgical intervention were severe airway obstruction with attacks of cyanosis, feeding difficulties and aspiration, weight loss and failure to thrive. ConclusionLaryngomalacia is the most common congenital anomaly of the larynx. It usually presents within 2 weeks after birth. Diagnosis depends on visualization of the larynx during respiration. Conservative treatment is the rule. Surgical treatment is only indicated in 10 % of cases...|$|E
