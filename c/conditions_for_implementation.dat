40|$|We {{come close}} to characterizing the class of social choice correspondences that are {{implementable}} in rationalizable strategies.

In the PropeR-project we determine the requirements for a generic interface between both these systems and evaluate its potential impact on patient care. This article reports results from the first year {{in one of the}} domains under study. It also provides background information about the project, including design considerations and experimental approach of forthcoming years. PURPOSE: The objectives of the first year were to determine bottlenecks of the current situation and to determine expected improvements and <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> <b>implementation</b> of a future situation with computer support. METHODS: These topics were investigated in general by literature review and in the local situation by a requirements analysis. For the analysis we used a {{combination of}} observation, interviews, and patient record study. For the literature survey we searched for reviews, meta-analyses and original studies concerning experiences with computer-based patient records and DSSs in conventional settings and in integrated care. RESULTS: Main bottleneck was the poor use of shared patient record and paper guidelines. Expected improvements were better protocol adherence and communication. <b>Conditions</b> <b>for</b> <b>implementation</b> of computer support were a proper system interface and adoption by the user.
