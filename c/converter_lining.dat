During the laboratory-industrial working-out of the proposed technology it was established that, depending on the level of the slag-metallic emulsion, two main post-combustion modes can be distinguished.

40|$|<b>Line</b> <b>converters</b> {{have become}} an {{attractive}} AC/DC power conversion solution in industrial applications. <b>Line</b> <b>converters</b> are based on controllable semiconductor switches, typically insulated gate bipolar transistors. Compared to the traditional diode bridge-based power <b>converters</b> <b>line</b> <b>converters</b> have many advantageous characteristics, including bidirectional power flow, controllable de-link voltage and power factor and sinusoidal line current. This thesis considers {{the control of the}} lineconverter and its application to power quality improving. The <b>line</b> <b>converter</b> control system studied is based on the virtual flux linkage orientation and the direct torque control (DTC) principle. A new DTC-based current control scheme is introduced and analyzed. The overmodulation characteristics of the DTC converter are considered and an analytical equation for the maximum modulation index is derived. The integration of the active filtering features to the <b>line</b> <b>converter</b> isconsidered. Three different active filtering methods are implemented. A frequency-domain method, which is based on selective harmonic sequence elimination, anda time-domain method, which is effective in a wider frequency band, are used inharmonic current compensation. Also, a voltage feedback active filtering method, which mitigates harmonic sequences of the grid voltage, is implemented. The frequency-domain and the voltage feedback active filtering control systems are analyzed and controllers are designed. The designs are verified with practical measurements. The performance and the characteristics of the implemented active filtering methods are compared and the effect of the L- and the LCL-type line filteris discussed. The importance of the correct grid impedance estimate in the voltage feedback active filter control system is discussed and a new measurement-based method to obtain it is proposed.

40|$|Three-phase voltage-source {{converters}} {{are used}} as utility interfaces. In such a case, the <b>converter</b> <b>line</b> currents are required to track sinusoidal references synchronized with the utility grid without a steady-state error. In this paper a current control method based on a sinusoidal internal model is employed. The method uses a sine transfer function with a specified resonant frequency, which is called an S regulator. The combination of a conventional proportional-integral (PI) regulator and an S regulator is called a PIS regulator. The PIS regulator ensures that the steady-state error in response to any step changes in a reference signal at the resonant frequency and 0 Hz reduces to zero. An experiment was carried out using a 1 -kVA prototype of three utility-interface converters, a voltage-source rectifier, an active power filter, and static synchronous compensator.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The thesis begins with a review of presently available analogue and digital control schemes for high frequency PWM converters. Advantages and disadvantages of each scheme are identified, to determine which features would be desirable in a new digital control scheme. An extensive examination of peak and average current mode control is undertaken, using state-space/sampled data modelling, to gain more detailed information on the properties of current mode control. On {{the basis of this}} information, a new digital current mode control scheme is put forward. This uses samples of the inductor current, line voltage and output voltage to implement a control strategy in software. Average inductor current is calculated each switching cycle and compared to the current program level, providing true current mode control. This has some advantages over traditional methods. Accurate inductor current tracking of the current program level is achieved and no slope compensation is required for stable operation over the full range of duty ratios. Line voltage feed-forward is possible in buck derived topologies, which provides an effective null in the audio susceptibility transfer function, independent of compensation parameters. Current loop stability is independent of line voltage or load current in the buck topology, allowing operation with optimum loop compensation under all normal operating conditions. Practical implementation of a digital current mode controlled current-fed converter is described. This includes a modular architecture for the hardware and documentation for the software. Effects of component selection on the achievable converter switching frequency and dynamic performance are discussed. A method is put forward for the direct digital measurement of loop gain and phase in digital control systems. This is used to obtain actual loop responses from a test bed digital current mode controlled current-fed <b>converter.</b> <b>Line</b> and load transient response tests are presented which demonstrate the dynamic characteristics of digital current mode control...|$|R
