40|$|The U. S. Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s June 2003 {{decision}} in Lawrence v. Texas {{may prove to}} be one of the most important civil rights cases of the twenty-first century. It may do for gay and lesbian people what Brown v. Board of Education did for African-Americans and Roe v. Wade did for women. While I <b>certainly</b> <b>hope</b> <b>so,</b> my enthusiasm is tempered by the fact that discrimination on the basis of race or gender has not disappeared. Will Lawrence signal meaningful change, or will its revolutionary possibilities be stifled by endless cycles of excuse and redefinition? The case is important, but I worry that it may not go far enough. In this Essay, I explore the unique problems of gay civil rights, the limits of legal formalist discourse, and the importance of making the private public. I end with my own story of where I was when I heard the news of Lawrence because I believe strongly that making public our private stories is necessary to ensure that the experiences of law become the logic of law...|$|E
40|$|Does health {{promotion}} in industry really lead to heightened employee health awareness, shorter periods of absenteeism, en-hanced corporate images, improved employee health, reduced health insurance premiums, and decreased employer-financed health care expenditures? 1 - 4 <b>Certainly</b> we <b>hope</b> <b>so.</b> Many justi-fications for {{health promotion}} programs in industry {{have been built}} on such expectations. The question is whether these ex-pectations have been fulfilled. Or, in other words, {{has there been a}} cause-and-effect relationship confirmed between the ini-tiation of health promotion programs in industry and the pre-viously purported benefits? After {{a review of the literature}} and a careful analysis of the requirements for demonstrating cause-and-effect relationships, I believe that the answer is equivocal. In this article I shall examine the reported evidences for the effects or outcomes of all the health promotion programs i...|$|R

40|$|Are {{you willing}} to reflect on your own practice? Do you take a strong {{interest}} in your coachees ’ learning? In sum, are you a purposeful reader? If so, this book may be for you. Askew and Carnell <b>certainly</b> <b>hope</b> <b>so.</b> They have set out to write a concise book that provokes fresh thinking for coaches, based on their own previously published work, and their experience of running the coaching service at the London-based Institute of Education. The overall message is encouragement for coaches to find ways of helping people to learn, using a non-hierarchical collaborative relationship. The authors define a coach as a ‘facilitator of learning’, and think that the word ‘coach ’ does not fully capture what they are driving at. Other terms include calling coaching sessions ‘meetings’, and goals ‘actions for change. This attention to terminology and clarity of argument is a very positive feature of the book, with discussion ranging from very detailed coaching behaviours through to abstract conceptual analysis. The book favours a learner-centred, rather than goal-centred approach to coaching. Askew and Carnell define learning as ‘change – to behaviour or change to thinking, or our perception of something’. Much of the argument draws upon Mezirow’s theory of transformational learning, encouraging critical reflection on a person’s underlying beliefs and assumptions. This constitute...|$|E
