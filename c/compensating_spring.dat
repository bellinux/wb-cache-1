Their coupling rods extended from crank-pin to crank-pin, with no knuckle joints. The 5 ft wheelbase bogie had a lateral traverse of 1+1/4 in to each side, which was restrained by two cylindrically-shaped rubber cushion pads, each 5+5/8 in in diameter and 5 in deep. Two inverted laminated springs carried the vertical load.|$|R

40|$|Climate change models predict an {{increase}} in the amount and intensity of winter rainfall in the UK. A series of experiments using both container grown plants and field trials was undertaken, to investigate the effect of winter waterlogging on the growth, development and yield of current varieties of winter wheat. The interaction of waterlogging with other factors such as summer drought, seed rate, and sowing date was also investigated. In the field, waterlogging decreased plant population, and uptake of nitrogen over winter from 50 kg/ha to 25 kg/ha. Plants formed new porous nodal roots, which were able to penetrate below the water level. All the varieties tested had a good ability to recover from damage by waterlogging. Plant dry weights per area of waterlogged plots were 50 % of controls at the end of treatment in March, 75 % at anthesis and 85 - 90 % at harvest. In all varieties except Xi- 19, recovery was due to increased number of tillers per plant, a higher proportion of which survived to form an ear. Xi- 19 increased the number of grains per ear and the weight of individual grains. Waterlogging early in the season (autumn and early winter) killed more plants, but allowed longer for surviving plants to recover and <b>compensate.</b> <b>Spring</b> waterlogging caused the greatest decrease in grain yield. Sowing in September allowed autumn and spring tillering, thus two chances for compensatory growth. November sown plants did not tiller until spring, and if waterlogging occurred at this time yields were especially poor. Waterlogging did not make crops more vulnerable to subsequent drought or lodging, but the incidence of take-all and stem-base disease did appear to increase. Despite the lack of disparity in tolerance, varieties did appear to have different responses to waterlogging. Varieties with a higher growth rate and demand on resources due to weaker winter dormancy (Xi- 19) appeared to suffer more leaf chlorosis than those with a stronger dormancy (Claire). Deben had good ability to recover due to its high tillering rate in spring, and had the largest yield. Hereward showed the smallest decrease in yield, but had the lowest yield under control and waterlogged conditions. It was hoped that {{it would be possible to}} find a simple screening method to identify tolerant varieties at an early stage. Unfortunately plant appearance during waterlogging was not predictive of final yield. Research into stress tolerance has tended to concentrate on identifying `stress genes' but in this case it appears that multi-gene traits are more important in determining crop yield.

40|$|This {{research}} measures the overall acoustic properties of spring and winter, and their difference is investigated {{from the perspective}} of environmental change. Forest in winter is very calm with occasional sound of birds and is devoid of insect sounds. The frequency components of winter forests are shifted towards the lower frequencies however, unique sounds caused by walking on snow <b>compensates</b> for this. <b>Spring</b> forests gives off a sense of gradually increasing vitality moving away from the calm of winter. Especially, as both the variety of bird species that cry and the frequency of those cries are increased significantly in the spring, the ratio of middle to high tone energies of the sound was about three times that of the 10 % measured during winter. In all environments volume was louder than winter...|$|R
50|$|The crucial {{problem was}} to find a {{resonator}} that remained unaffected by the changing conditions met by a ship at sea. The balance wheel, harnessed to a spring, solved most of the problems associated with the ship's motion. Unfortunately, the elasticity of most balance spring materials changes relative to temperature. To <b>compensate</b> for ever-changing <b>spring</b> strength, the majority of chronometer balances used bi-metallic strips to move small weights toward and away from the centre of oscillation, thus altering the period of the balance to match the changing force of the spring. The balance spring problem was solved with a nickel-steel alloy named Elinvar for its invariable elasticity at normal temperatures. The inventor was Charles Édouard Guillaume, who won the 1920 Nobel Prize for physics in recognition for his metallurgical work.|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{predictions}} of net ecosystem productivity (NEP c) of forest ecosystems {{are essential for}} climate change decisions and requirements {{in the context of}} national forest growth and greenhouse gas inventories. However, drivers and underlying mechanisms determining NEP c (e. g., climate and nutrients) are not entirely understood yet, particularly when considering the influence of past periods. Here we explored the explanatory power of the compensation day (cDOY) —defined as the day of year when winter net carbon losses are <b>compensated</b> by <b>spring</b> assimilation—for NEP c in 26 forests in Europe, North America, and Australia, using different NEP c integration methods. We found cDOY to be a particularly powerful predictor for NEP c of temperate evergreen needleleaf forests (R 2 = 0. 58) and deciduous broadleaf forests (R 2 = 0. 68). In general, the latest cDOY correlated with the lowest NEP c. The explanatory power of cDOY depended on the integration method for NEP c, forest type, and whether the site had a distinct winter net respiratory carbon loss or not. The integration methods starting in autumn led to better {{predictions of}} NEP c from cDOY then the classical calendar method starting 1 January. Limited explanatory power of cDOY for NEP c was found for warmer sites with no distinct winter respiratory loss period. Our findings highlight the importance of the influence of winter processes and the delayed responses of previous seasons' climatic conditions on current year's NEP c. Such carry-over effects may contain information from climatic conditions, carbon storage levels, and hydraulic traits of several years back in time. </p...|$|R
40|$|Environmental {{conditions}} {{at one point}} of the annual cycle of migratory species may lead to cross-seasonal effects affecting fitness in subsequent seasons. Based on a long-term mark-resighting dataset and scoring of body condition in an arctic breeding goose species, we demonstrate a substantial effect of winter harshness on post-winter body condition. However, this effect was <b>compensated</b> along the <b>spring</b> migration corridor, and did not persist long enough to influence future reproduction. This {{highlights the importance of}} temporal scale when assessing impacts of environmental effects, and suggests a state-dependent physiological mechanism adjusting energy accumulation according to internal energy stores carried into spring. In support of these findings, the development of body condition was unaffected by whether geese used supplementary feeding sites or not. While there was no effect of winter harshness on the average population pre-breeding body condition, individual variations in early spring body condition (probably related to different life-histories) were partly traceable throughout spring. This strongly indicates a carry-over effect on the individual level, possibly related to differences in dominance, site use, disturbance or migration strategy, which may potentially affect future reproduction...|$|R
40|$|In {{the design}} of Vibration {{isolator}} is often required ensure a reduction (or increase) the value of frequency ηr, that is connected {{with the ability to}} calculate the stiffness characteristics of elastomeric Vibration isolator in the low final and medium final deformations.

In this case, the stiffness characteristic of “force – settlement” P = P (Δ), even for small final deformations, will be non-linear (or piecewise linear).

40|$|Rubber forming is {{a common}} process for the {{fabrication}} of flanged metallic parts in the aerospace industry. The process enables cheap tooling, which is important since the product series are limited. In the process a rigid and a soft tool are combined to form a metal blank into the required shape. Most components made in this way are “flanged parts”, i. e. parts with a rather flat web plate and curved flanges at {{the periphery of the}} web plate. For flanged parts the determination of spring back of the flanges, straight or curved, is important, since the forming dies <b>compensated</b> with the <b>spring</b> back, should result in accurate products. Like all metal forming processes elastic and plastic deformations are combined in the same process cycle. The elastic deformations result in spring back and residual stresses, the ratio between these two depends on the shape of the product and the distribution of the plastic and elastic deformations. In this research an aluminium alloy was used. The low Young’s modulus of this alloy results in rather high elastic responses upon deformation. Other aspects that have been evaluated are the effect of processing parameters like friction and distribution of strains. For stretch flanges the strain is distributed evenly along the flange, but not for shrink flanges, where buckling plays a role. Experimental research shows that the spring back of the flanges depend on a number of variables like the thickness, flange geometry, and material parameters. The spring back of a flange is also a mixture of different contributions: spring back due to the bending over the bend line, spring back due to the curvature of the flange, and spring back due to in-plane deformations. The research performed focused on the different components of the spring back and their interaction. Analysis of the data resulted in a new parameter by which a number of variables could be captured. This improves the understanding of the spring back phenomena and a generalization of the results...|$|R
