5|$|The liger is a {{cross between}} a male lion and a tigress. Because the lion sire passes on a growth-promoting gene, but the {{corresponding}} growth-inhibiting gene from the female tiger is absent, ligers grow far larger than either parent species. They share physical and behavioural qualities of both parent species (spots and stripes on a sandy background). Male ligers are sterile, but female ligers are often fertile. Males have about a 50% <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> a mane, but, even if they do, their manes will be only around half the size of that of a pure lion. Ligers are typically between 10 and 12feet in length, and can weigh between 800 and 1,000pounds or more.|$|E
5|$|An {{association}} with the folliculin (FLCN) gene was first reported in 2002. This 14-exon gene {{is located on the}} short arm of chromosome 17 (17p11.2) and has a cytosine-rich region in exon 11 particularly susceptible to mutation. The most common mutation in this region is the insertion or deletion of a cytosine residue, found in 53% of Birt–Hogg–Dubé families. There is {{no significant difference in the}} symptoms experienced by families with an insertion at that location compared to those who have a deletion. However, mutations in FLCN associated with Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome are heterogeneous, and are often nonsense mutations or frameshift mutations that cause early truncation of the protein product at the carboxy-terminus. Very rarely, missense mutations are observed. Mutations are often passed from one generation to the next in an autosomal dominant fashion but can occur as a new mutation in an individual with no prior family history (a de novo mutation). The children of an affected parent each have a 50% <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> the disease. Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome has very high penetrance. A correlation between different FLCN genotypes and phenotypes has not been discovered.|$|E

A 50% chance is given to any female who is a carrier to transmit the HPRT1 mutation in each pregnancy. Sons who inherit the mutation will be affected while daughters who inherit the mutation are carriers. Therefore, with each pregnancy, a carrier female has a 25% <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> a male that is affected, a 25% <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> a female that is a carrier, and a 50% <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> a normal male or female.|$|E

25|$|In {{the case}} of {{families}} at risk for X-linked diseases, patients are provided with a single PGD assay of gender identification. Gender selection offers a solution to individuals with X-linked diseases {{who are in the}} process of getting pregnant. The selection of a female embryo offspring is used in order to prevent the transmission of X-linked Mendelian recessive diseases. Such X-linked Mendelian diseases include Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), and hemophilia A and B, which are rarely seen in females because the offspring is unlikely to inherit two copies of the recessive allele. Since two copies of the mutant X allele are required for the disease to be passed on to the female offspring, females will at worst be carriers for the disease but may not necessarily have a dominant gene for the disease. Males on the other hand only require one copy of the mutant X allele for the disease to occur in one's phenotype and therefore, the male offspring of a carrier mother has a 50% <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> the disease. Reasons may include the rarity of the condition or because affected males are reproductively disadvantaged. Therefore, medical uses of PGD for selection of a female offspring to prevent the transmission of X-linked Mendelian recessive disorders are often applied. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis applied for gender selection can be used for non-Mendelian disorders that are significantly more prevalent in one sex. Three assessments are made prior to the initiation of the PGD process for the prevention of these inherited disorders. In order to validate the use of PGD, gender selection is based on the seriousness of the inherited condition, the risk ratio in either sex, or the options for disease treatment.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{identify}} {{the association between}} both, body mass index and aerobic fitness, with cardiovascular disease risk factors in children. MethodsCross-sectional study, carried out in Itaúna-MG, in 2010, with 290 school children ranging from 6 to 10 years-old of both sexes, randomly selected. Children from schools located in the countryside and those with medical restrctions for physical activity were not included. Blood sample was collected after a 12 -hour fasting period. Blood pressure, stature and weight were evaluated in accordance with international standards. The following were considered as cardiovascular risk factors: high blood pressure, high total cholesterol, LDL, triglycerides and insulin levels, and low HDL. The statistical analysis included the Spearman's coefficient and the logistic regression, with cardiovascular risk factors as dependent variables. ResultsSignificant correlations were found, in both sexes, among body mass index and aerobic fitness {{with most of the}} cardiovascular risk factors. Children of both sexes with body mass index in the fourth quartile demonstrated increased <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> high blood insulin and clustering cardiovascular risk factors. Moreover, girls with aerobic fitness in the first quartile also demonstrated increased <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> high blood insulin and clustering cardiovascular risk factors.

40|$|Introduction: During the menstrual period, {{pregnancy}} and menopause breast is constantly affected physically and physiologically. The importance of breast diseases increase {{with the growing}} number of breast cancers. Given the high prevalence of breast disorders, this study was conducted to investigate the factors influencing breast lumps in women referring to health centers in 1390 in Aran and Bidgol. Materials & methods: This case-control study was conducted on 198 women without breast lump and 198 with breast lump that referred to health centers of Aran and Bidgol. Data was collected through a questionnaire containing demographic, fertility and its diagnosis. Findings: The results showed that the <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> a mass in patients with benign cysts compared to those without, is equal to OR = 0. 76. <b>Chances</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> a mass in people with a record of fibrocystic to those without cysts is OR = 5, and the <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> a mass in patients with fibro adenoma to those without, is equal to OR = 33. Only the result for <b>having</b> a record <b>of</b> fibro adenomas was significant. Discussion & conclusions: Benign breast lumps in the majority of cases occur in women of reproductive age. Although most common in lumps <b>of</b> reproductive age <b>have</b> been fibrocystic and fibroadenomas, because of significant associations the incidence of mass with history of lumps is recommended to paying more attention to early detection, screening studies and check in younger women than to western country women...|$|R
