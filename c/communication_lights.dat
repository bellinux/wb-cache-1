Orthogonal frequency division multi-plexing (OFDM) waveforms transmitted in a VLC system will have high peak-to-average power ratios (PAPRs).

Brightness control is an essential feature for the illumination function. In this paper, we will analyze the performance of dynamic range constrained visible light OFDM systems with biasing adjustment and pulse width modulation (PWM) methods.
