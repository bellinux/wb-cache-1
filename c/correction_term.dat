40|$|We derive {{a closed}} formula for the Heegaard Floer <b>correction</b> <b>terms</b> of lens spaces {{in terms of}} the {{classical}} Dedekind sum and its generalization, the Dedekind-Rademacher sum. Our proof relies on a reciprocity formula for the <b>correction</b> <b>terms</b> established by Ozsvath and Szabo. A consequence of our result is that the Casson-Walker invariant of a lens space equals the average of its Heegaard-Floer <b>correction</b> <b>terms.</b> Additionally, we find an obstruction for the equality and equality with opposite sign, of two <b>correction</b> <b>terms</b> of the same lens space. Using this obstruction we are able to derive an optimal upper bound on the number of vanishing <b>correction</b> <b>terms</b> of lens spaces with square order second cohomology.

40|$|The {{effects of}} local flow, upwash, and {{sidewash}} on {{angle of attack}} and sideslip (measured with boom-mounted vanes) were determined for subsonic, transonic, and supersonic flight using a maximum likelihood estimator.

40|$|We present general {{relativistic}} <b>correction</b> <b>terms</b> {{appearing in}} Newton's gravity to the second-order perturbations of cosmological fluids. In our previous work {{we have shown}} that to the second-order perturbations, the density and velocity perturbation equations of general relativistic zero-pressure, irrotational, single-component fluid in a flat background coincide exactly with the ones known in Newton's theory. Here, we present the general relativistic second-order <b>correction</b> <b>terms</b> arising due to (i) pressure, (ii) multi-component, (iii) background curvature, and (iv) rotation. In case of multi-component zero-pressure, irrotational fluids under the flat background, we effectively do not have relativistic <b>correction</b> <b>terms,</b> thus the relativistic result again coincides with the Newtonian ones. In the other three cases we generally have pure general relativistic <b>correction</b> <b>terms.</b> In case of pressure, the relativistic corrections appear even {{in the level of}} background and linear perturbation equations. In the presence of background curvature, or rotation, pure relativistic <b>correction</b> <b>terms</b> directly appear in the Newtonian equations of motion of density and velocity perturbations to the second order. In the small-scale limit (far inside the horizon), relativistic equations including the rotation coincide with the ones in Newton's gravity. Comment: 41 pages, no figur...|$|R

2500|$|If we {{consider}} mathematics as a progression from finite processes of algebra to considerations of the infinite, {{then the first}} steps towards this transition typically come with infinite series expansions. [...] It is this transition to the infinite series that is attributed to Madhava. [...] In Europe, the first such series were developed by James Gregory in 1667. [...] Madhava's work is notable for the series, but what is truly remarkable is his estimate of an error term (or <b>correction</b> <b>term).</b> [...] This implies that the limit nature of the infinite series was quite well understood by him. [...] Thus, Madhava may have invented the ideas underlying infinite series expansions of functions, power series, trigonometric series, and rational approximations of infinite series.|$|E
