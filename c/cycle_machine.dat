25|$|The {{first known}} {{mention of a}} Stirling <b>cycle</b> <b>machine</b> using freely moving {{components}} is a British patent disclosure in 1876. This machine was envisaged as a refrigerator (i.e., the reversed Stirling cycle). The first consumer product to utilize a free piston Stirling device was a portable refrigerator manufactured by Twinbird Corporation of Japan and offered in the US by Coleman in 2004.|$|E
25|$|When {{used for}} cabin pressurization, the bleed {{air from the}} engine must first be cooled (as it exits the {{compressor}} stage at temperatures as high as 250°C) by passing it through an air-to-air heat exchanger cooled by cold outside air. It is then fed to an air <b>cycle</b> <b>machine</b> unit that regulates the temperature and flow of air into the cabin, keeping the environment comfortable.|$|E
25|$|Other {{methods of}} {{refrigeration}} include the air <b>cycle</b> <b>machine</b> used in aircraft; the vortex tube used for spot cooling, when compressed air is available; and thermoacoustic refrigeration using sound waves in a pressurized gas to drive heat transfer and heat exchange; steam jet cooling {{popular in the}} early 1930s for air conditioning large buildings; thermoelastic cooling using a smart metal alloy stretching and relaxing. Many Stirling cycle heat engines can be run backwards {{to act as a}} refrigerator, and therefore these engines have a niche use in cryogenics. In addition there are other types of cryocoolers such as Gifford-McMahon coolers, Joule-Thomson coolers, pulse-tube refrigerators and, for temperatures between 2 mK and 500 mK, dilution refrigerators.|$|E
40|$|HFAST is a {{general-purpose}} third-order {{harmonic analysis}} and design program for predicting the cyclic-steady state thermodynamic performance of Stirling cycles. It represents the state-of-the-art results {{of years of}} research efforts at Mechanical Technology Inc. (MTI) {{in the development of}} Stirling <b>cycle</b> <b>machines.</b> The code has been extensively used at MTI to support the development of both free-piston and kinematic Stirling <b>cycle</b> <b>machines.</b> Lately, HFAST has undergone many major improvements, both in the analysis method and in the user's interface.

50|$|Program steps execute in one <b>machine</b> <b>cycle,</b> {{except for}} steps {{performing}} multiplication or division which take as many <b>machine</b> <b>cycles</b> as {{needed for the}} operation.

50|$|Modern 8051 cores are {{faster than}} earlier {{packaged}} versions. Design improvements have increased 8051 performance while retaining compatibility {{with the original}} MCS 51 instruction set. The original Intel 8051 ran at 12 clock <b>cycles</b> per <b>machine</b> <b>cycle,</b> and most instructions executed {{in one or two}} <b>machine</b> <b>cycles.</b> A typical maximum clock frequency of 12 MHz meant these old 8051s could execute one million single-cycle instructions, or 500,000 two-cycle instructions, per second. In contrast, enhanced 8051 silicon IP cores now run at one clock <b>cycle</b> per <b>machine</b> <b>cycle,</b> and have clock frequencies of up to 450 MHz. That means an 8051-compatible processor can now execute 450 million instructions per second.|$|R
25|$|The APU (auxiliary power unit) {{does not}} need to supply bleed air when the main engines are not operating. Aerodynamics are {{improved}} {{due to the lack of}} bleed air vent holes on the wings. By driving cabin air supply compressors at the minimum required speed, no energy wasting modulating valves are required. High-temperature, high-pressure air <b>cycle</b> <b>machine</b> (ACM) packs can be replaced with low temperature, low-pressure packs to increase efficiency. At cruise altitude, where most aircraft spend the majority of their time and burn the majority of their fuel, the ACM packs can be bypassed entirely, saving even more energy. Since no bleed air is taken from the engines for the cabin, the potential of engine oil contamination of the cabin air supply is eliminated.|$|E
2500|$|Because {{of their}} lower {{efficiency}} and larger bulk, air cycle coolers are not often used nowadays in terrestrial cooling devices. [...] However, the air <b>cycle</b> <b>machine</b> {{is very common}} on gas turbine-powered jet aircraft as cooling and ventilation units, because compressed air is readily available from the engines' compressor sections. [...] Such units also serve the purpose of pressurizing the aircraft.|$|E

50|$|Automatic {{lubrication}} {{system is designed}} to apply lubricant in small, measured amounts over short, frequent time intervals. Time and human resource constraints and sometimes the physical location on machine often makes it impractical to manually lubricate the points. As a result, production <b>cycles,</b> <b>machine</b> availability, and manpower availability dictate the intervals at which machinery is lubricated which is not optimal for the point requiring lubrication. Auto lube systems are installed on machinery to address this problem.|$|R

50|$|The part of {{the bleed}} air that is {{directed}} to the ECS is then expanded and cooled to a suitable temperature by passing it through a heat exchanger and air <b>cycle</b> <b>machine</b> known as the packs system.

50|$|A simple cycle {{combustion}} turbine {{has a lower}} thermal efficiency than a combined <b>cycle</b> <b>machine.</b> Although, they may be less expensive to build simple cycle {{combustion turbine}}s, due to their low efficiency, cost more to run than most other plants. This results in increased cost per kWh during peak electricity times. Since compared to other NG fuel using turbines, such Combined Cycle Turbines, the lack of efficiency causes the need {{to increase the amount}} of NG fuel consumed to produce the same amount of electricity.|$|E

50|$|An air <b>cycle</b> <b>machine</b> (ACM) is the {{refrigeration}} {{unit of the}} environmental control system (ECS) used in pressurized gas turbine-powered aircraft. Normally an aircraft has {{two or three of}} these ACM. Each ACM and its components are often referred as an air conditioning pack. The air cycle cooling process uses air instead of a phase changing material such as Freon in the gas cycle. No condensation or evaporation of a refrigerant is involved, and the cooled air output from the process is used directly for cabin ventilation or for cooling electronic equipment.|$|E
50|$|Foil {{bearings}} {{were first}} {{developed in the}} late 1950s by AiResearch Mfg. Co. of the Garrett Corporation using independent R&D funds to serve military and space applications. They were first tested for commercial use in United Airlines Boeing 727 and Boeing 737 cooling turbines in the early- and mid-1960s. Garrett AiResearch air <b>cycle</b> <b>machine</b> foil bearings were first installed as original equipment in 1969 in the DC-10's environmental control systems. Garrett AiResearch foil bearings were installed on all US military aircraft to replace existing oil-lubricated rolling-contact bearings. The ability to operate at cryogenic gas temperatures {{as well as at}} very high temperatures gave foil bearings many other potential applications.|$|E

50|$|For given extreme temperatures, a gas cycle {{may be less}} {{efficient}} than a vapor compression cycle because the gas cycle works on the reverse Brayton cycle instead of the reverse Rankine cycle. As such, the working fluid never receives or rejects heat at constant temperature. In the gas cycle, the refrigeration effect {{is equal to the}} product of the specific heat of the gas and the rise in temperature of the gas in the low temperature side. Therefore, for the same cooling load, gas refrigeration <b>cycle</b> <b>machines</b> require a larger mass flow rate, which in turn increases their size.|$|R

This paper investigates the key technological developments that have characterized foil bearing advances. It is expected that a better understanding of foil gas bearing development path will aid in future development and progress towards more advanced applications...|$|R
