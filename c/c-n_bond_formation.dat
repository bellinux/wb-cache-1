The reaction's synthetic utility stems primarily from the shortcomings of typical methods (nucleophilic substitution, reductive amination, etc.) for the synthesis of aromatic C-N bonds, with most methods suffering from limited substrate scope and functional group tolerance.

40|$|The {{synthesis}} of carbon-nitrogen (C-N) bonds {{is an area}} of research that has garnered significant interest due to the ubiquity of C-N bonds in pharmaceuticals and natural products. Various methods exist for forming C-N bonds, most recognizably Buchwald-Hartwig amination, but these reactions typically require functionalization of either the C-H or N-H bond resulting in the formation of harmful byproducts. As a result, the need to explore alternative means for synthesizing C-N bonds merits consideration. An alternative means for achieving <b>C-N</b> <b>bond</b> <b>formation</b> lies in the oxidative cross coupling of carbon-hydrogen (C-H) and nitrogen-hydrogen (N-H) bonds. While this approach eliminates the necessity for the prefunctionalization of C-H and N-H bonds, reactions employing oxidative cross coupling can be plagued with poor regioselectivity. As a result, the use of directing groups and transition metal catalysis is typically employed to circumvent this issue. ^ The primary focus of this dissertation is the discussion of newly developed methodologies that enhance the regioselective control of oxidative <b>C-N</b> <b>bond</b> <b>formation.</b> In each instance hypervalent iodine is used in conjunction with a transition metal catalyst to help govern the site of amination on various electron-rich, and moderately deactivated, arene systems. ^ The first manuscript entitled 2 ̆ 2 Regioselective Gold Catalyzed Oxidative <b>C-N</b> <b>Bond</b> <b>Formation</b> 2 ̆ 2 discusses the effects of a gold (I) catalyst when oxidatively coupling phthalimide to simple arenes in the presence of hypervalent iodine.

Why not <b>C-N</b> <b>bond</b> <b>formation?</b> We investigated new oxidative amination reactions by cross-dehydrogenative-coupling.

The combination of large scale use, high water solubility and only minor biodegradability has now resulted in a significant gasoline oxygenate contamination occurring in surface, ground, and drinking water systems. Combination of hydroxyl radical formation and the pyrolytic environment generated by ultrasonic irradiation (665 kHz) leads to the rapid degradation of MTBE and other gasoline oxygenates in aqueous media. ^ The presence of oxygen promotes the degradation processes by rapid reaction with carbon centered radicals indicating radical processes involving O 2 are significant pathways. A number of the oxidation products were identified.

40|$|Fumonisins are a {{group of}} polyketide-derived mycotoxins {{produced}} by Fusarium Verticillioides, a filamentous fungus infecting corn and contaminating food and feeds. Fumonisins contain two tricarballylic esters that are critical for toxicity. Here, we present genetic and biochemical data for the esterification mechanism. FUM 14 in F.

Two new metabolites, HFB 3 and HFB 4, which are biosynthetic precursors of fumonisins lacking the tricarballylic esters, were detected in the mutant. The results suggest that FUM 14 is required for the esterification of fumonisins. FUM 14 was predicted to encode a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) containing two domains, peptidyl carrier protein and condensation domain. Both the intact Fum 14 p and the condensation domain have been expressed in Escherichia coli and purified for activity assays.
