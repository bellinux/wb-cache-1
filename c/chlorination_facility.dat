5000|$|A new {{pump station}} {{with an initial}} {{capacity}} of [...] per day, and an ultimate capacity of [...] per day, commenced operations in March 2014. The existing two pump stations, a substation and <b>chlorination</b> <b>facility</b> were decommissioned. New treatment facilities included pre-treatment, filtration, chlorination, stabilisation and fluoridation. The old facilities {{were not able to}} sustain increasing water demands and current Australian drinking water guidelines. Aesthetic water qualities such as colour, taste and odour had deteriorated over the years.|$|E
50|$|Most {{developed}} countries saw declining rates of typhoid fever throughout {{the first half}} of the 20th century due to vaccinations and advances in public sanitation and hygiene. In 1908, the chlorination of public drinking water was a significant step in the US in the control of typhoid fever. The first permanent disinfection of drinking water in the U.S. was made to the Jersey City, New Jersey, water supply. Credit for the decision to build the chlorination system has been given to John L. Leal. The <b>chlorination</b> <b>facility</b> was designed by George W. Fuller. In 1942 doctors introduced antibiotics in clinical practice, greatly reducing mortality. Today, the incidence of typhoid fever in {{developed countries}} is around five cases per million people per year.|$|E
5000|$|On June 19, 1908, Fuller {{was hired}} by John L. Leal to design and build a {{chlorination}} system for the Jersey City, New Jersey water supply at Boonton Reservoir on the Rockaway River. Given an impossible deadline {{as a result of}} a New Jersey Chancery Court order, Fuller successfully completed the chlorination system in 99 days. John L. Leal developed the basic concept of applying chlorine in the form of a dilute solution of chloride of lime (calcium hypochlorite) at fractions of a ppm. [...] Fuller modeled his chloride of lime feed system on the aluminum sulfate feed system that he designed for the Little Falls Water Treatment Plant. The <b>chlorination</b> <b>facility</b> fed 0.2 to 0.35 ppm of chlorine to an average water flow of 40 million gallons per day from Boonton Reservoir.|$|E
50|$|The {{waters of}} Six Springs Creek {{indirectly}} feed into the Nesbitt Reservoir, an unfiltered reservoir {{owned by the}} Pennsylvania Gas and Water Company. However, the officials of the company made plans to improve the <b>chlorination</b> <b>facilities</b> of the pipelines carrying water from the reservoir.|$|R
500|$|Rescue {{and relief}} work was impeded by {{overloaded}} telephone communications, and consequentially, Telecom ceased telephone service between Townsville and Ingham. Nearly [...] of rainfall was measured at Cardstone along the Tully River, and flooding was noted along {{the boundaries of}} both the Tully and Herbert rivers, of which the prior had receded from its peak level to [...] by the afternoon of 3February. The city of Cairns and its outskirts experienced power outages, and high tides nearby compelled ship owners to seek refuge at ports. Blackouts rendered <b>chlorination</b> <b>facilities</b> and water treatment plants useless, and residents were subsequently advised to boil water. Damage to three roofs was reported at Bingal Beach north of Cairns, and in Cairns proper, damaged ten houses, with five of them unroofed, toppled trees, and knocked down power lines. The storm delivered similarly severe damage along Marlin Beach within the vicinity of Cairns, washing away stretches of its coastline, unroofing two residences, damaging 13other structures, and overturning power lines. The loss of electricity at one building in the Cairns Base Hospital complex, which was also unroofed, left it running on emergency power.|$|R
50|$|Some wastes contain {{chemicals}} {{capable of}} suppressing microbiological growth or activity. Potential sources include industrial wastes, antibiotics in pharmaceutical or medical wastes, sanitizers in food processing or commercial cleaning <b>facilities,</b> <b>chlorination</b> disinfection used following conventional sewage treatment, and odor-control formulations used in sanitary waste holding tanks in passenger vehicles or portable toilets. Suppression of the microbial community oxidizing the waste will lower the test result.|$|R
40|$|A {{chlorination}} {{pilot plant}} having capacity to produce 5 - 10 kg/hr of titanium tetrachloride is in operation at the <b>chlorination</b> <b>facility</b> in Mintek. The bubbling fluid bed chlorination plant can be operated in batch and or continuous process {{to study the}} chlorination kinetics of various feedstocks. The chlorination of titaniferrous ores to produce titanium tetrachloride (TiCl 4) was carried out during the commissioning of the pilot plant and also {{as part of the}} Titanium programme carried out at Mintek. TiCl 4 is a basic raw material for producing commercial titanium dioxide pigment and titanium metal. This paper discusses the challenges faced during the commissioning and operation of the chlorination pilot plant. It also discusses the effect on the auxiliary facilities and instrumentation {{as a result of the}} harsh operating conditions of + 1000 Â°C and use of corrosive gases like chlorine & titanium tetrachloride. It discusses the effect of physico-chemical properties of the titanium tetrachloride and iron chlorides. Effect on the chlorinator refractory lining due to heating and cooling of the chlorinator is also discussed. Besides the special provisions made during the design of the chlorinator, this paper also discusses the operational experience and possible solutions to be implemented in future. 1. ...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1977 Presentation date: 1976 - 07 - 09 This study {{traces the}} {{evolution}} of federal legislation to control water pollution in the period between 1935 and 1965. In this legislative history, the function of interest groups, the actions of congressmen and congressional committees, {{and the role of}} the President and the Executive Branch are reviewed. The water pollution control program as developed under this law provided financial and technical aid to state and interstate agencies for the development of state programs and financial aid to municipalities for the construction of sewage treatment facilities. The federal government also sponsored research on improved methods of waste treatment, and cooperated with state agencies in the collection of basic data on water quality. The most controversial elements of the federal program in the period between 1948 and 1965 were the attempts to control pollution through: 1) holding enforcement conferences between the particular states involved and the federal administering agency; and 2) setting water quality standards to reduce the amount of wastes discharged into interstate waters. The administering agencies played an important part in this program. The criticisms of these agencies and the numerous administrative reorganizations are emphasized. The overall effect of the federal water pollution control law is evaluated as having mixed results. The impact of the federal water pollution control legislation from 1948 through 1965 on water quality of the Lower Columbia River is examined. This impact took the following forms: 1) Financial aid was given to municipalities for the construction of waste treatment facilities which reduced the load of bacterial pollution and some of the organic pollution. 2) Grants were made to the state water pollution control agencies of Oregon and Washington which enabled these agencies to improve their programs. 3) An enforcement conference was initiated by the states of Oregon and Washington with the Public Health Service regarding the municipal and industrial pollution interferring with legitimate uses of the Lower Columbia River. Little was accomplished by this conference to affect the discharge of wastes from the pulp and paper mills, but other industries and most municipalities did meet the requirements of an Action Program devised by the conferees. In addition, the conference was at least partially responsible for making the city of Portland increase its treatment capacity and install <b>chlorination</b> <b>facilities</b> to rid the river downstream of serious levels of coliform bacteria. 4) The setting of water quality standards had a positive impact on the approach to water pollution control by requiring the states to catalog the waste sources and develop treatment requirements and time schedules for their abatement. Standards also gave state agencies one more weapon against recalcitrant polluters. In summary, the Water Pollution Control Act provided stimuli for the states of Oregon and Washington to improve the water quality of the Lower Columbia River...|$|R
5000|$|The Catskill-Delaware Water Ultraviolet Disinfection Facility is an 160000 sq ft UV water {{disinfection}} plant built in Westchester County, New York to disinfect {{water for the}} New York City water supply system. The compound is set {{to be the largest}} Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation plant in the world. [...] It has 56 energy efficient UV reactors at a total cost to the city tax payers of $1,600,000,000. Mayor Michael Bloomberg created research groups between 2004-2006 to decide the best, cost effective ways to modernize NYC's water filtration process. To become secondary to the existing <b>chlorination</b> and fluoridation <b>facilities.</b> They had discovered that the cheapest alternatives would cost over $3 billion, other than UV. In response to this, Bloomberg decided to set up a public competitive contract auction. Ontario based Trojan Technologies won the contract. The facility will treat 2.2 billion US gallons (8,300,000 m3) per day. The new facility was set to be in operation by the end of 2012. The facility opened on October 8, 2013.|$|R
