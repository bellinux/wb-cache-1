5|$|<b>College</b> <b>students</b> <b>are</b> {{at risk of}} {{engaging}} in poor sleep hygiene and also of being unaware of the resulting effects of sleep deprivation. Because of irregular weekly schedules and the campus environment, college students may be likely to have variable sleep-wake schedules across the week, take naps, drink caffeine or alcohol near bedtime, and sleep in disruptive sleeping environments. Because of this, {{it is important to}} have sleep hygiene education on college campuses.|$|E

African American and Latino <b>college</b> <b>students</b> <b>are</b> food insecure to greater extent than Asian and White college students. Three-fourths of college students who are food insecure receive some form of financial aid and the majority of these students are employed. It has been found that food insecurity at the community college level is far higher for students concentrated in mathematics, developmental writing, and reading. Food insecure students are {{more likely to}} consider dropping out of college and are less likely to stay on track toward obtaining their academic goals than those who are food secure.|$|E

25|$|Most {{educational}} {{institutions in the}} U.S. are non-profit; for-profit {{colleges and universities are}} usually more expensive and academically inferior, with many cases of scams. Colleges and universities in the U.S. vary in terms of goals: some may emphasize a vocational, business, engineering or technical curriculum while others may emphasize a liberal arts curriculum. Many combine {{some or all of the}} above. Another consideration is the male-female ratio; overall, 56% of enrolled <b>college</b> <b>students</b> <b>are</b> women, but the male-female ratio varies by college and year and program. Admissions guidance counselors can offer views about whether a public or private school is best, and give a sense of the tradeoffs.|$|E
