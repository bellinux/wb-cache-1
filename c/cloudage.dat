6000|$|Reason is not {{the faculty}} of the finite. But here I must premise the following. The faculty of the finite is that which reduces the {{confused}} impressions of sense to their essential forms,--quantity, quality, relation, and in these action and reaction, cause and effect, and the like; thus raises the materials furnished by the senses and sensations into objects of reflection, and so makes experience possible. Without it, man's representative powers would be a delirium, a chaos, a scudding <b>cloudage</b> of shapes; and it is therefore most appropriately called the understanding, or substantiative faculty. Our elder metaphysicians, down to Hobbes inclusively, called this likewise discourse, 'discursus, discursio,' from its mode of action as not staying at any one object, but running as it were to and fro to abstract, generalize, and classify. Now when this faculty is employed {{in the service of the}} pure reason, it brings out the necessary and universal truths contained in the infinite into distinct contemplation by the pure act of the sensuous imagination, that is, in the production of the forms of space and time abstracted from all corporeity, and likewise of the inherent forms of the understanding itself abstractedly from the consideration of particulars, as in the case of geometry, numeral mathematics, universal logic, and pure metaphysics. The discursive faculty then becomes what our Shakspeare with happy precision calls [...] "discourse of reason." ...|$|E
50|$|Cloud cover (also {{known as}} cloudiness, <b>cloudage,</b> or cloud amount) {{refers to the}} {{fraction}} of the sky obscured by clouds when observed from a particular location. Okta is the usual unit of measurement of the cloud cover. The cloud cover is correlated to the sunshine duration as the least cloudy locales are the sunniest ones while the cloudiest areas are the least sunny places.|$|E
40|$|Plant {{temperature}} (Tp) and {{its relations}} to the microclimate of rice colony and irrigation water were studied using a thermo-sensitive genic male sterile (TGMS) rice line, Pei'ai 64 S. Significant {{differences in the}} daily change of temperature were detected between Tpand air temperature {{at the height of}} 150 cm (TA). From 8 : 00 to 20 : 00, Tp was lower than TA, but they were similar during 21 : 00 to next 7 : 00. The maximum Tp occurred one hour earlier than the maximum TA, though they both reached the minimum at 6 : 00. Tp fluctuated less than TA. At the same height, during 6 : 00 – 13 : 00, Tp was higher than air temperature (Ta), and Tp reached the maximum one hour earlier than Ta. During the rest time on sunny day, Tpwas close to or even a little lower than Ta. On overcast day, Tpwas higher than Ta in the whole day, and both maximized at the same time. In addition, Tpwas regulated by solar radiation, <b>cloudage</b> and wind speed in daytime, and by irrigation water at night. The present study indicated that a TA of 29. 6 °C was the critical point, at which Tpwas increased or decreased by irrigation water. Tp and the difference between water and air temperatures showed a conic relation. Tp fluctuation was also regulated by the absorption or reflection of solar radiation by leaves during daytime and release of heat energy during nighttime. By analysis on correlation and regression simulation, two models of Tp were established...|$|E
