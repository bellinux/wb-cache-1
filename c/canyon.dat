5|$|A {{number of}} feeder canyons {{running into the}} Black <b>Canyon</b> slope in the wrong {{direction}} for water to flow into the <b>canyon.</b> It is believed that less-entrenched streams in the region shifted to a more north-flowing drainage pattern in response to a change in the tilt of the surrounding terrain. The west-flowing Gunnison, however, was essentially trapped in the hard Precambrian rock of the Black <b>Canyon</b> and could not change its course.|$|E

Most <b>canyons</b> are cut into limestone, sandstone, granite or basalt, though other rock types are found. <b>Canyons</b> can be very easy or extremely difficult, though emphasis in the sport is usually on aesthetics and fun rather than pure difficulty.

5|$|Geologically, the <b>canyon</b> likely {{originated}} {{millions of}} years ago as the result of San Diego Creek cutting through the San Joaquin Hills.

5|$|Grand <b>Canyon</b> {{lies on the}} {{southern}} end of the Intermountain West seismic belt. At least 35 earthquakes larger than 3.0 on the Richter Scale occurred in the Grand <b>Canyon</b> region in the 20th century. Of these, five registered over 5.0 on the Richter Scale and the largest was a 6.2 quake that occurred in January 1906. Major roughly north—south trending faults that cross the <b>canyon</b> are (from west to east), the Grand Wash, Hurricane and Toroweap. Major northeast-trending fracture systems of normal faults that intersect the <b>canyon</b> include the West Kaibab and Bright Angel while northwest-trending systems include the Grandview—Phantom. Most earthquakes in the region occur in a narrow northwest-trending band between the Mesa Butte and West Kaibab fracture systems. These events are probably the result of eastward-migrating crustal stretching that may eventually move past the Grand <b>Canyon</b> area.|$|E
5|$|Heeding Bryant's advice, Palmer {{decided to}} route the {{railroad}} {{south of the}} <b>canyon</b> and in March 1883, it completed its connection to Salt Lake City and {{for a brief period}} the <b>canyon</b> was on the main line of a transcontinental railroad system. While the railroad and early visitors used the <b>canyon</b> as a path to Utah and mines to the southwest, later visitors came to see the <b>canyon</b> as an opportunity for recreation and personal enjoyment.|$|E
30|$|Harris and Whiteway (2011) also {{reported}} that <b>canyons</b> exhibit {{an impressive array of}} statistics from their length and spacing to their slope, depth range, dendricity, and sinuosity. Active continental margins contain 44.2 % of all <b>canyons</b> (2586 / 5849) and passive margins contain 38.4 % (2244 / 5849). <b>Canyons</b> are steeper, shorter, more dendritic, and more closely spaced on active than on passive continental margins. River-associated, shelf incising <b>canyons</b> are more numerous on active continental margins than on passive margins. They are most common on the western margins of South and North America where they comprise 11.7 % and 8.6 % of <b>canyons,</b> respectively. In the Mediterranean Sea, where 518 large submarine <b>canyons</b> have been identified (Harris and Whiteway 2011), all three types of <b>canyons</b> are present.

Powell led a second expedition in 1871, this time with financial backing from the U.S. government. The explorers named many features along the Colorado and Green rivers, including Glen <b>Canyon,</b> the Dirty Devil River, Flaming Gorge, and the Gates of Lodore.

40|$|Most {{submarine}} <b>canyons</b> {{are documented}} as erosive features that deeply {{cut into the}} shelf margin, and are considered as important conduits for the transfer of sediment to the lower slope and abyssal plain. In this study we investigate a series of submarine <b>canyons</b> developed on the shelf margin in the Pearl River Mouth Basin. High-resolution 2 D seismic and borehole data {{have been used to}} investigate the morphology and stacking pattern of these submarine <b>canyons.</b> Seventeen <b>canyons</b> oriented NNW-SSE, approximately perpendicular to the regional slope, have been distinguished. They evolve from V-shaped in the upslope part to U-shaped morphology downslope. Numerous buried channels can be distinguished below the modern <b>canyons</b> showing an auto-cyclic progression in the scouring-filling and vertical stacking, indicating that <b>canyons</b> experienced a cyclic evolution with several cutting and filling phases of varying magnitude. Infilling evolved from high to low energy deposits. The low energy deposits form asymmetric, eastward prograding bodies developed on the western flank of the buried channel. The remarkable asymmetry between the two flanks of <b>canyons</b> may result from the interaction between turbiditic current within <b>canyons</b> and along slope bottom currents that flow northeast-ward along the margin...|$|R
