The theme of ‘Beyond Personalized Medicine: From Womb to Heaven’ will be in-depth presentation on Precision Medicine, including <b>customized</b> <b>medicine</b> and stem cell therapy.At this conference, world’s top class personnel in precision medicine and cell therapy will participate as speakers to present a global vision. Some of the speakers include Dr. Harrier, the co-founder of IPMC and the icon of the global bio industry, and Dr. Andrew, the head of the US Food and Drug Administration(FDA).|$|E
40|$|The {{recognizable}} {{proof of}} ordinary and carcinogenic stem cell {{and the latest}} developments made in seclusion and principles of stem cells have quickly picked up consideration {{in the field of}} medicine discovery and regenerative prescriptions. The possibility of performing screens pointed at burgeoning, controlled separation, and toxicity and adequacy studies utilizing stem cells offers a solid stage for the medication finding process. Progresses made in the era of incited pluripotent stem cells from typical or unhealthy tissue serves as a stage to perform medicine screens pointed at creating cell-based treatments against disorders like Parkinson's ailment and diabetes. This review talks about the provision of stem cells and cancer stem cell in medicine screening and their part in supplementing, decreasing, and reinstating animal testing. Notwithstanding this, target distinguishing proof and real developments in the field of <b>customized</b> <b>Medicine</b> utilizing affected pluripotent cells are additionally examined. *Email Id...|$|E
40|$|Genomics {{has brought}} about in its wake a true {{biological}} revolution and {{can be applied to}} all areas of life sciences. Having sequenced the genomes of several different species, genomics techniques now allow us to study polymorphisms and the gene expression of proteins, enhancing our understanding of the biological functions of genes. The combined know-how of physicists and computer scientists, as well as of geneticists and physiologists is required to identify how genes control the dynamics of cell functions. Naturally enough, it is in the sphere of human medicine that the applications of genomics look most promising. Preventive and <b>customized</b> <b>medicine,</b> adapted to the genetic potential and to the way of life of each individual, will in all probability see the light of clay in the foreseeable future. in farm animals, {{there is no doubt that}} sequencing the bovine genome will give rise to new concepts and new molecular tools which will accelerate studies in bovine genomics. Comparing the bovine genome with that of other species, including humans, is also a potential source of huge progress for both human health and ruminant husbandry in general...|$|E
40|$|Dr. Radhakrishnan, a {{researcher}} at the NASA Glenn Research Center, in collaboration with biomedical researchers at the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine and Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital, is developing computational models of human physiology that quantitate metabolism and its regulation, in both healthy and pathological states. These models can help predict the effects of stresses or interventions, such as drug therapies, and {{contribute to the development of}} <b>customized</b> <b>medicine.</b> Customized medical treatment protocols can give more comprehensive evaluations and lead to more specific and effective treatments for patients, reducing treatment time and cost. Commercial applications of this research may help the pharmaceutical industry identify therapeutic needs and predict drug-drug interactions. Researchers will be able to study human metabolic reactions to particular treatments while in different environments as well as establish more definite blood metabolite concentration ranges in normal and pathological states. These computational models may help NASA provide the background for developing strategies to monitor and safeguard the health of astronauts and civilians in space stations and colonies. They may also help to develop countermeasures that ameliorate the effects of both acute and chronic space exposure...|$|E
40|$|Quorum sensing (QS) is the {{chemical}} communication processes between bacteria, {{which may be}} inter-genus or intra-genus. In general, several physiological functions, such as nutrient uptake, competence development, biofilm formation, sporulation, and toxin secretion, are accomplished through QS process. The QS (cell density-dependent process) circuit in Gram-positive bacteria consists mainly of two parts: an inducer molecule and a receptor protein. The binding of inducer molecule to receptor activates the target gene, which then performs the necessary function in bacteria. In the past few years, several investigations have been conducted to explore the QS circuit in various bacteria, but still this information is insufficient to fully understand the bacterial gene expression cascade. In the present review, we summarize the QS architecture and their associated gene regulation in four Gram-positive bacteria, such as Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. It is well established that S. aureus, B. cereus, and S. pneumoniae are potent human pathogen. A detailed understanding of QS circuit in these bacteria would be useful in preparation of <b>customized</b> <b>medicine</b> in future. Whereas, B. subtilis is an industrially important candidate and {{has been used in}} several biotechnology sectors. Understanding of QS circuit in B. subtilis will definitely enrich the antibiotics and enzyme industries...|$|E
40|$|The Sasang Constitutional Medicine is a {{traditional}} Korean <b>customized</b> <b>medicine</b> that classifies people into four types: Tae-eumin (TE), Soyangin (SY), Soeumin (SE), and Taeyangin. The {{aim of this study}} was to show whether the Sasang Constitution (SC) could be an independent risk factor for the metabolic syndrome (MS). Totally, 3, 334 subjects from 24 Korean medicine clinics participated in this study. A one-way ANOVA for the continuous variables and a chi-square test for the prevalence of MS were conducted. A logistic regression was conducted to calculate the propensity score and the odds ratios (ORs). The prevalence for MS in TE, SY, and SE was 50. 6 %, 30. 9 %, and 17. 7 % (P< 0. 001) before matching, and 36. 7 %, 28. 6 % and 28. 2 % (P= 0. 042) after matching, respectively. The TE was associated with an increased OR for MS compared with the SE and SY in both crude (OR 4. 773, 95 % CI 3. 889 – 5. 859, and OR 2. 292, 95 % CI 1. 942 – 2. 704, resp.) and matched groups (OR 1. 476, 95 % CI 1. 043 – 2. 089, and OR 1. 452, 95 % CI 1. 026 – 2. 053, resp.). This study reveals that the SC, especially the TE type, could be considered as a risk element for MS even in people with otherwise similar physical characteristics...|$|E
