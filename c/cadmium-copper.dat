40|$|During 1983, 287 dust {{samples were}} {{collected}} from urban areas in Hong Kong Island and Kowloon for the determination of lead, zinc, copper and cadmium by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The mean concentrations of all elements {{are found to be}} higher in Kowloon, with two well-defined anomalous areas in zinc and cadmium present at San Po Kong and Cheung Sha Wan. The strongest positive correlations are found to exist between <b>cadmium-copper</b> and cadmium-zinc. Vehicle exhaust is identified to be the main contributor of lead, while discharges from industrial activity and incineration are probable sources of zinc, copper and cadmium as well as for lead. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|For {{ecological}} risk assessment, the {{additive model}} {{may be used}} to empirically predict toxic mixture effects. Detailed toxicity tests were performed to determine whether effects of mixtures of copper-cadmium and copper-carbendazim on Caenorhabditis elegans were similar to the effects of the individual compounds. Effects on the course of reproduction, the length of the juvenile period, the length of the reproductive period, and body length were analyzed. Dose-response data were compared to the additive model and tested for four deviation patterns from additivity: No deviation, synergistic/antagonistic deviation, dose ratio-dependent deviation, dose level-dependent deviation. During the exposure, the <b>cadmium-copper</b> effect on reproduction changed from a synergistic, to a dose ratio-dependent deviation from additivity. More cadmium in the mixture decreased the toxicity and more copper increased the toxicity. The effect of copper-carbendazim on reproduction was synergistic at low dose levels and antagonistic at high dose levels and independent of time. Mixture effects on the juvenile and reproductive period were similar to single component effects. It was concluded that the observed time-dependence of toxic interactions was small and that interactions on the timing of reproduction were not found. The additive model underestimated mixture effects on reproduction and body length...|$|E
40|$|Preliminary {{data are}} {{reported}} {{from a study}} of 269 cadmium-nickel battery factory workers and 94 <b>cadmium-copper</b> alloy factory workers. The target group comprises all workers with more than 5 years exposure to cadmium {{at any time since}} the factories started production. An internal reference group of 328 alloy factory workers without cadmium exposure was also studied. The expected number of deaths and cancers was calculated with the "life-table " method by using national average incidence rates for men in different age groups and at different calendar years. It was found that among the workers in the battery factory who started work before 1948 there was an increased general mortality in the 1950 's mainly due to respiratory disease. The same group had an increased renal disease mortality. There was no increase in general cancer mortality or in general cancer incidence. The risk ratio for nasopharyngeal cancer incidence was 10 (two cases), which was statistically significant. For some other sites like prostate, lung and colon-rectum the risk ratios were also greater than 1 but not statistically significant. In the alloy factory there was a tendency for an increased mortality in prostatic cancer (four cases). After correction for the "healthy worker effect " using the reference group, the risk ratio for prostatic cancer deaths was calculated as 2. 4, but this was not statistically significant. The findings in this study support the earlier reports of an association between human cadmium exposure and increased risk for prostatic cancer...|$|E
40|$|In {{polluted}} areas {{organisms are}} generally exposed to mixtures {{of toxic chemicals}} rather than a single toxicant only. Since the number of mixture toxicity studies with regard to soil systems is limited, the research in this thesis was focused on investigating ecotoxicological consequences of combined exposure for soil invertebrates. Two topics were studied: i) population-level consequences of chronic combined exposure of individual organisms, and ii) the influence of interactions between the toxic compounds in the soil matrix on their joint toxicity. The soil dwelling, free living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans was chosen as test species. A quantitative description procedure was proposed for interpreting the joint toxicity of chemical mixtures, compared to the toxicity of the individual components. It enabled the identification of four biologically relevant deviation patterns from either the additive or the independent reference model, by means of likelihood analysis: i) no deviation, ii) synergism/antagonism, iii) toxicant ratio- and iiii) effect level dependent deviation. Using these models, sublethal effects of chronic stress of binary mixtures of copper and cadmium, and copper and carbendazim on life cycle events of the nematode C. elegans were studied. The <b>cadmium-copper</b> effect on reproduction was transient: it changed from synergistic, to a toxicant ratio dependent deviation from additivity. The effect of copper-carbendazim was synergistic at low effect levels and antagonistic at high effect levels. The juvenile period was a relatively non-sensitive parameter, whereas {{the length of the}} reproductive period was relatively more sensitive. In conclusion, it should be realised that mixture toxicity may be transient and that interactions may differ among life history traits. It was discussed that the effect translation of combined effects to the population level depended on three factors: i) the sensitivity of each life history trait to each of the toxicants, ii) the combination effect of the toxicants on each life history trait, iii) the sensitivity of to changes in each life history trait. A detailed analysis of mixture effects on the life history of nematode Caenorhabditis elegans showed that synergistic effects on reproduction were transferred to the population level, despite the low sensitivity of λ to changes in this trait. Subsequently single and combined toxicity of copper-zinc, copper-cadmium, cadmium-lead, copper-carbendazim and copper-carbendazim-iprodione to the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans were studied in LUFA 2. 2 soil, and the one-week population increase was estimated as toxicity endpoint. Metals with the highest partition coefficient affected the sorption of metals with the lowest partition coefficient when both were combined. However, comparing soil sorption characteristics with joint toxicity patterns did not give general results. Nevertheless, it was discussed that for identifying fundamental principles of joint toxicity in ecotoxicology, and for developing predictive models, ecological "mechanisms" should be investigated...|$|E
