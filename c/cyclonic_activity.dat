5|$|Only six {{tropical}} cyclones {{were observed}} in the Eastern Pacific during this season, which is well below the 1949–2006 average of 13 per year. Of the six tropical cyclones, two only attained hurricane status. In addition, none of the tropical cyclones became a major hurricane, which is Category 3 or greater on Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. Although it is an oddity for no major hurricanes to occur during a season since the satellite era began, nearly all hurricane seasons during this time period lacked a major hurricane. However, {{it is likely that}} other tropical cyclones in the Eastern Pacific basin in 1949 went operationally unnoticed, due to lack of modern technology such as satellite imagery. In addition to the six tropical cyclones, another tropical cyclone developed in the Eastern Pacific basin, but was included in the Atlantic basin hurricane database, rather than the Eastern Pacific. Most of the seven tropical cyclones did not differentiate in intensity during the duration, with the exception of Hurricane Six. The first two tropical cyclones of the season formed in quick succession in during mid-June, however, the months of July and August went dormant in terms of tropical cyclogenesis. The last five tropical cyclones, including the additional storm, also developed in a quick sequence, all of which forming from in a span of 17 days.

5|$|In general, La Niña {{events are}} {{associated}} with lower temperatures (particularly colder winters) in the Pampas. During winter, frosts are more common during La Niña events compared to El Niño events. This {{is due to a}} stronger southerly flow during La Niña events caused by a higher concentration of high pressure systems in the South Pacific and an increase in <b>cyclonic</b> <b>activity</b> (more low pressure systems) in the South Atlantic. This creates conditions that are favourable for bringing cold air from the south, particularly when there is a formation of a high pressure system over Patagonia (associated with the passage of a front) that is responsible for bringing cold air from the south. Thus, invasions of cold air from the south are more common during La Niña events. In contrast, warm spells in the Pampas and northern parts of the country are more intense and frequent during El Niño events. This is due to stronger westerly winds south of 40oS, leading to less frequent incursions of cold air from the south while enhancing winds from the north that bring in warm air. Although La Niña events lead to colder winters with more frequent incursions of cold air in both the north and central parts of the country, it leads to more frequent and intense warm spells in the last months of the year. In other regions, El Niño events lead to more frequent and intense warm spells in Northwest Argentina (during autumn), northeast Argentina (during spring) and central Argentina (during summer). Cold air anomalies arising from El Niño events are observed during spring and are the result of an increase in rainfall that lead to reductions in insolation. For the southern parts of the country, El Niño events {{are associated with}} more intense and frequent cold spells during the coldest months. In summer, El Niño events are associated with warmer summer temperatures in the southern parts of the country.|$|E

40|$|Ensemble {{simulations}} {{of a regional}} climate model (RegCM 3) forced by aerosol radiative forcing suggest that biomass burning aerosols can work against the seasonal monsoon circulation transition, thus re-enforce the dry season rainfall pattern for Southern Amazonia. Strongly absorbing smoke aerosols warm and stabilize the lower troposphere within the smoke center in southern Amazonia (where aerosol optical depth > 0. 3). These changes increase the surface pressure in the smoke center, weaken the southward surface pressure gradient between northern and southern Amazonia, and consequently induce an anomalous moisture divergence in the smoke center and an anomalous convergence in northwestern Amazonia (5 degrees S- 5 degrees N, 60 degrees W- 70 degrees W). The increased atmospheric thermodynamic stability, surface pressure, and divergent flow in Southern Amazonia may inhibit synoptic <b>cyclonic</b> <b>activities</b> propagated from extratropical South America, and re-enforce winter-like synoptic <b>cyclonic</b> <b>activities</b> and rainfall in southeastern Brazil, Paraguay and northeastern Argentina.

40|$|Ensemble {{simulations}} of smoke aerosol radiative effects with a regional climate {{model in the}} Amazon has been conducted to investigate the radiative effects of aerosols on clouds, rainfall, and circulation from dry to wet season. The results of the ensemble simulations suggest that the radiative effect of the smoke aerosols can reduce daytime surface radiative and sensible fluxes, the depth and instability of the planetary boundary layer (PBL), consequently the clouds in the lower troposphere in early afternoon in the smoke center, where the aerosols optical depth, AOD, exceeds 0. 3. The aerosol radiative forcing also appears to weaken moisture transport into the smoke center and increase moisture transport and cloudiness in the region upwind to the smoke center, namely, the northern Amazon. Anomalous wind convergence over the equatorial western Amazon occurs to compensate the anomalous wind divergence in the southern Amazon, leading to an increase of both clouds and rainfall in that region. The increased atmospheric thermodynamic stability in Southern Amazonia also appears to block synoptic <b>cyclonic</b> <b>activities</b> propagated from extratropical South America, leading to an increased synoptic <b>cyclonic</b> <b>activities</b> and rainfall in southern Brazil, Paraguay and northern Argentina.

Afterwards, there were studies on the impact of La Nina (cold phase of ENSO) and the overall impact of three ENSO phases (warm, cold and neutral phase) on cyclone activities and tropical depression.

ENSO has a considerable impact on <b>cyclonic</b> <b>activities</b> on a global scale at different levels and on different aspects in terms of the characteristics of the storm. 1 Any changes in ENSO such as climate changes will affect the frequency and orbital motions of tropical storms. Research shows that in El Niño conditions, for example, the frequency of cyclones often decreases on an annual basis in Atlantic, western Pacific and Australian waters, but increases in the Central and Eastern Pacific Ocean. Therefore, it can be noted that the number of tropical storms in some areas reduced can be offset by the increase in cyclones elsewhere due to the global connections of atmospheric circulations in tropical regions.|$|R

Due to the harsh weather conditions in Antarctica, climate and ocean models appear as suitable tools to complement the scarcity of observations and to study the Antarctic climate. Nonetheless, only few models are able to represent typical processes found at high latitudes such as katabatic winds, drifting snow for the atmosphere or sea ice formation, accretion and deformation for oceans. Furthermore, due to their high non-linearity, those processes are difficult to model as they occur at different spatial and temporal scales. Current models are often forced by outputs: atmospheric conditions are provided to ocean models and ocean models outputs are used as surface conditions in atmospheric models meaning air feedbacks on ocean (or inversely) are muted. One can think models should be coupled at each time steps to take into account instantaneous interactions. Nonetheless, this method involves (too) high computational costs. The main challenge of this coupling is to take into account air-ice-ocean interactions and the temporal scale of associated processes in order to define an appropriate coupling time step.

The legendary storm that saved Japan from invasion about a millennia ago is one such example. Recent cyclones, such as Typhoon Tip in 1979 and Cyclone Tracy in 1974, have been responsible for causing billions of dollars? worth damage and killing a significant number of people. The maximum gust speed recorded to date, over 200 mph, is capable of destroying a building. Various building codes and regulations are based on international research that covers the design of buildings for high winds. At higher wind speeds, as seen in cases of cyclones and tornedoes, the external pressure on the buildings shell increases as the square of the wind speed. One of the failure modes for buildings is a catastrophic failure of the window elements in a high-pressure windstorm. The failure creates a resonance, named after Herrmann von Helmholtz, that overloads the roof and walls from the wind pressure and the mass movement of air. A new device was developed in this research to smoothen the transition from a closed to open state for a buildings opening. The device has a controlled failure of a plug element. The purpose of the research was to develop a test arrangement to generate cyclonic wind pressures inside a box container to test failure load for the plug. The results show that a plug with a friction joint between the pipe could be used to control the flow of air from the exterior to the interior of a room at a pre-determined pressure inside the box. The system was found to work and able to create a low level of damping to model the Helmholtz resonator. Further research is recommended using different plug samples...|$|R

The largest changes are observed in the terrestrial aerosol proxy non-sea salt calcium, only moderate changes occur in the marine sea salt indicator sodium, while ammonium, a proxy for marine bioproductivity, remains rather constant. In agreement with previous studies, we find that only considerable glacial–interglacial changes at both, the terrestrial and the marine sea salt aerosol source can explain the observed pronounced changes. The unprecedented high-resolution of our data allows for the first time the examination of decadal variability back to the penultimate glacial period. On the one hand, we find occasional fast shifts occurring within a few years; here we present such an event in the calcium record from the penultimate glacial period. On the other hand, we examine variation coefficients and pairwise correlation coefficients, both determined in 200 -year windows. They generally reveal only moderate changes. During glacial periods, slightly lower variation coefficients are found, concurrent with slightly higher correlation coefficients, which points to a more uniform and stronger coupled atmospheric long-range transport of the different aerosol species to the East Antarctic Plateau and less influence of <b>cyclonic</b> <b>activities</b> during cold periods. The opposite is observed for interglacial periods with probably even reinforced importance of cyclonic influences during the Last Interglacial period, the Marine Isotope Stage 5. 5. This period reveals no evidence for abrupt climatic changes in any of the species, however, the marine sea salt aerosol indicator sodium shows a distinct minimum followed by a pronounced increase. This pattern is explained by significantly reduced sea ice production in the Indian Southern Ocean sector, which is believed to be the dominant source of sodium deposited in Dome C during warm periods...|$|R
40|$|Seasonal {{mean values}} of heights and {{temperatures}} at the selected pressure surfaces are computed, using the aerological data obtained during the 4 th (1960) and the 5 th (1961) wintering observations at the Syowa Base, Antarctica. Main {{characteristics of the}} seasonal and yearly variations both in the antarctic troposphere and the stratosphere are investigated by means of these limited data. Four vertical time sections (from the surface to 30 mb) of Feb. May. Aug. Oct. -Nov., representing each season respectively, are made based on these data, and some notable features of seasonal circulation patterns in 1961 over the Syowa Base are briefly described. In addition, in supplementing this single station data analysis, IAAC 2 ̆ 7 s synoptic weather charts in microfilm are used to locate relative pressure systems, {{and at the same}} time, for rough estimation of circulation intensity, meridional temperature gradients between the Syowa Base and Marion Island in the middle latitude, together with difference in their annual variations, are utilized. Characteristics of the seasonal circulations in 1961 are summarized as follows : Summer : In the troposphere, weak anticyclonic systems predominate over the east continent and weak circulations of E-ly with slightly N and S components are seen. However, in the location and movement of these systems, W-ly wind circulation is also seen. <b>Cyclonic</b> <b>activities</b> are such that most of lows move on toward the east within the low pressure belt off the base, and, except at the surface, N or NE-ly winds by these systems are very weak in the upper layer, so there was little influence to the air over the base. For the layer from the lower to middle stratosphere, weak W-ly wind generally prevails but variation of the wind direction is also seen upon appearance of anabatic and katabatic fields. In the upper stratosphere, weak E-ly wind with N component can be seen. Autumn : For the layer from the middle troposphere to the lower stratosphere, S or SW-ly strong jets come to be observed due to the sharp southward extension of the middle latitude ridge which brings about a temperature rise in the air over the base. At the same time, in the lower layer near the surface, a shallow cold film of the polar anticyclone is formed and weak surface inversion develops up to about 500 m; subsequently weak anticyclonic circulation at the surface is maintained. On the other hand, <b>cyclonic</b> <b>activities</b> are intensified from the middle autumn and replacement of the air masses becomes more active. In case a moderate cyclone approaches, a strong NE-ly wind circulation is observed throughout the troposphere. In the upper stratosphere, with advancement of cooling process, a strong W-ly jet predominates following the formation of the polar vortex. Winter : Near the surface, weak SE-ly circulation predominates due to the control of the polar cold anticyclone with moderate surface inversion. In the polar night period, weak circulation of nearly E-ly wind prevails generally for the most part of the troposphere, but even in this period, the base region is attacked by an intensive cyclone of winter. Cyclone activities with strong NE-ly wind are further intensified especially in early and late winter. In some cases this NE-ly wind may persist for several days afterward, with a gradual decrease in its speed only, due to stagnation and filling of the low in the north of the base. There is also found a much more intensified influence of sharp ridge extension southward from the middle latitude anticyclone than autumn, and stronger SW-ly with circulation with a temperature rise is observed. Such an alternative appearance of the NE-ly and SW-ly wind circulation verifies that the antarctic atmosphere is markedly baroclinic in winter time. In the stratosphere, as the polar night cold vortex {{is in the midst of}} maximum development, strong W-ly jet more than 100 knots prevails continuously. Spring : Rapid spring-time stratospheric warming which begins with the uppermost layer is found for the period from late October to early November, followed by weakening of the circulation. The NE-ly wind by various-scaled cyclonic turbulence of short period nature is seen in the troposphere. On the other hand, strong SW-ly wind caused by the pressure pattern similar to those in autumn and winter also appears in both the troposphere and the stratosphere. Active replacement of the air masses takes place throughout the whole atmosphere, which is in process of a rapid transition into summer season...|$|R
