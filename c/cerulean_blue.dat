Before he can leave, Modell is {{surrounded}} and arrested by FBI agents led by Frank Burst (Vic Polizos). While being escorted away in a police car, he repeatedly talks about the color <b>cerulean</b> <b>blue.</b> Modell's talking seemingly causes the driver to not see an approaching big rig of that color, causing a collision. Modell escapes after the driver unlocks his handcuffs before dying.|$|E

The agents learn from Modell's physical therapist that the Little Sisters of Charity, {{who try to}} visit all the hospitalized inmates, have been seeing Modell. Modell calls the prison and talks to Mulder, who refuses to listen. The call is traced to a sports shop in Occoquan, Virginia where a Carbo-Bar wrapper is left on the counter. Later, Modell is holding {{a picture of a}} young woman in a house where a man is covered in <b>Cerulean</b> <b>Blue</b> paint.|$|E
5|$|Before the 19th century, cobalt was {{predominantly}} {{used as a}} pigment. Since the Middle Ages, it {{has been}} used in the production of smalt, a blue colored glass. Smalt is produced by melting a mixture of the roasted mineral smaltite, quartz and potassium carbonate, yielding a dark blue silicate glass which is finely ground after the production. Smalt was widely used for the coloration of glass and as pigment for paintings. In 1780, Sven Rinman discovered cobalt green, and in 1802 Louis Jacques Thénard discovered cobalt blue. Cobalt pigments such as cobalt blue (cobalt aluminate), <b>cerulean</b> <b>blue</b> (cobalt(II) stannate), various hues of cobalt green (a mixture of cobalt(II) oxide and zinc oxide), and cobalt violet (cobalt phosphate) are used as artist's pigments because of their superior chromatic stability. Aureolin (cobalt yellow) is now largely replaced by more lightfast yellow pigments.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first major}} change was the {{replacement}} of eight colors that had long {{been part of the}} Crayola lineup. These were: Orange-Red (first produced in 1958), Maize (formerly Gold Ochre, produced since 1903), Orange-Yellow (1958), Lemon Yellow (formerly Light Yellow, produced since 1903), Green-Blue (1958), Violet-Blue (produced as Blue-Violet from 1930 to 1958), Raw Umber (1903), and Blue-Gray (1958). With the loss of Orange-Red, Orange-Yellow, Green-Blue, and Violet-Blue, the Crayola color wheel was reduced from eighteen to fourteen colors, with six [...] "principal hues" [...] and eight [...] "intermediate" [...] hues. The eight new colors were: Vivid Tangerine, Dandelion, Jungle Green, Teal <b>Blue,</b> <b>Cerulean,</b> Royal Purple, Fuchsia, and Wild Strawberry.|$|R

500|$|John Keegan from Critical Myth {{gave the}} episode a largely {{negative}} review and awarded it a 4 out of 10. He wrote, [...] "Overall, this episode was a disappointing sequel {{to one of}} the most popular episodes of the series. Bringing back Modell for this story was an ill-advised attempt to capitalize on impressions of continuity, especially since the character aspects of 'Pusher' were completely absent this time around. It's hard to believe that Vince and Tim, both strong writers on their own, were responsible for this material." [...] Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four. She called the entry [...] "tame" [...] compared to its original, although she understood the show's desire to write a sequel. Vitaris also criticized the fact that Modell never murdered anyone and called the episode's basic plot [...] "cheesy". She did, however, compliment several of the episode's set pieces, such as [...] "Nathan Bowman covered in <b>cerulean</b> <b>blue</b> paint"—which she called [...] "striking"—and the scene wherein [...] "Linda stops the heart of the suffering Modell", calling the latter [...] "sensately performed." ...|$|E

2500|$|Monet and the impressionists {{were among}} the first to observe that shadows were full of colour. In his La Gare Saint-Lazare, the grey smoke, vapour and dark shadows are {{actually}} composed of mixtures of bright pigment, including cobalt blue, <b>cerulean</b> <b>blue,</b> synthetic ultramarine, emerald green, Guillet green, chrome yellow, vermilion and ecarlate red. Blue was a favourite colour of the impressionist painters, who used it not just to depict nature but to create moods, feelings and atmospheres. Cobalt blue, a pigment of cobalt oxide-aluminium oxide, was a favourite of Auguste Renoir and Vincent van Gogh. It was similar to smalt, a pigment used for centuries to make blue glass, but it was much improved by the French chemist Louis Jacques Thénard, who introduced it in 1802. [...] It was very stable but extremely expensive. Van Gogh wrote to his brother Theo, [...] "'Cobalt [...] is a divine colour and there is nothing so beautiful for putting atmosphere around things..." ...|$|E
6000|$|Now, the {{kingfisher}} is blue, and I am puzzled to know why, on {{this one}} occasion, it appeared green. I have, in a former work, Argentine Ornithology, described a contrary effect in a small and beautiful tyrant-bird, Cyanotis azarae, variously called, in the vernacular, [...] "All-colored or Many-colored Kinglet." [...] It has a little blue on its head, but its entire back, from the nape to the tail, is deep green. It lives in beds of bulrushes, and when seen flying from the spectator in a very strong light, {{at a distance of}} twenty or thirty yards, its colour in appearance is bright <b>cerulean</b> <b>blue.</b> It is a sunlight effect, but how produced is a mystery to me. In the case of the two green kingfishers, I am inclined to think that the yellow of that shining field of buttercups in some way produced the illusion.|$|E
60|$|Raoul lay on {{the summit}} of the islet, where his eye could range over the mild waters that washed the rock, and his ear listen to the murmurings of his own element. The Tramontana, as usual, had driven all {{perceptible}} vapor from the atmosphere, and the vault of heaven, in its <b>cerulean</b> <b>blue,</b> and spangled with thousands of stars, stretched itself above him, a glorious harbinger for the future to one who died in hope. The care of Ghita and the attendants had collected around the spot so many little comforts, as to give it the air of a room suddenly divested of sides and ceiling, but habitable and useful. Winchester, fatigued with his day's work, and mindful of the wish that Raoul might so naturally feel to be alone with Ghita, had lain down on a mattress, leaving orders to be called should anything occur; while the surgeon, conscious that he could do no more, had imitated his example, making a similar request. As for Carlo Giuntotardi, he seldom slept, he was at this prayers in the ruins. Andrea and the podestà paced the rock to keep themselves warm, slightly regretting the sudden burst of humanity which had induced them to remain.|$|E
60|$|It {{was on a}} {{cloudless}} day of {{the autumn}} of last year, that I found myself {{in a city that}} seemed almost visibly rising beneath my eye. The street in which I stood was of noble dimensions, and lined on each side with palaces or buildings evidently devoted to public purposes. Few were completely finished: the sculptor was working at the statues that adorned their fronts; the painter was still touching the external frescoes; and the scaffold of the architect was not in every instance withdrawn. Everywhere was the hum of art and artists. The Byzantine style of many of these buildings was novel to me in its modern adaptation, yet very effective. The delicate detail of ornament contrasted admirably with the broad fronts and noble façades which they adorned. A church with two very lofty towers of white marble, with their fretted cones relieved with <b>cerulean</b> <b>blue,</b> gleamed in the sun; and near it was a pile not dissimilar to the ducal palace at Venice, but of nobler and more beautiful proportions, with its portal approached by a lofty flight of steps, and guarded by the colossal statues of poets and philosophers--suitably guarded, for it was the National Library.|$|E
6000|$|She awoke {{more than}} once in the night to recall mingled and gloomy dreams of cells and of castles, of {{funerals}} and of bridals, of coronets and of racks and gibbets; but towards morning she fell into sleep more sound than she had hitherto enjoyed, and her visions partook of its soothing character. The Lady of the Garde Doloureuse seemed to smile on her amid her dreams, and to promise her votaress protection. The shade of her father was there also; and with the boldness of a dreamer, she saw the paternal resemblance with awe, but without fear: his lips moved, and she heard words-their import she did not fully comprehend, save that they spoke of hope, consolation, and approaching happiness. There also glided in, with bright blue eyes fixed upon hers, dressed in a tunic of saffron-coloured silk, with a mantle of <b>cerulean</b> <b>blue</b> of antique fashion, the form of a female, resplendent in that delicate species of beauty which attends the fairest complexion. It was, she thought, the Britoness Vanda; but her countenance was no longer resentful--her long yellow hair flew not loose on her shoulders, but was mysteriously braided with oak and mistletoe; above all, her right hand was gracefully disposed of under her mantle; and it was an unmutilated, unspotted, and beautifully formed hand which crossed the brow of Eveline. Yet, under these assurances of favour, a thrill of fear passed over her as the vision seemed to repeat, or chant, ...|$|E
