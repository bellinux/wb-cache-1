Currently, India's reactors are almost exclusively pressurized heavy water reactors similar to Canadian Deuterium-Uranium CANDU reactors. While the CANDU design has the distinct advantage {{of being able to}} be refueled online, it has several drawbacks because of increased system complexity. Due to the significant possibility for cost reduction using a low-pressure design, the Heavy Water Organic Cooled Reactor is again being studied as an alternative.

40|$|When {{dealing with}} {{activities}} related to the design and optimisation of the Helium Cooled Lithium Lead (HCLL) blanket, doubts arose in the past about the technical feasibility of the tritium processing system. The questionable feasibility {{was due to the}} heavy performance requirements for different tritium processing subsystems, mainly consequence of the high tritium permeation rate from the breeding blanket into the main cooling circuit, which was claimed as an intrinsic characteristic of such a blanket concept. This was directly related to the supposed very low tritium solubility in the liquid lead lithium in eutectic composition. Recent data on the hydrogen-PbLi Sieverts' constant achieved at ENEA CR Brasimone are one order of magnitude higher than those so far assumed as reference. Because of the consequent much lower tritium permeation rate from the liquid metal into the primary cooling circuit, the performance requirements for the main tritium processing subsystems/technologies in HCLL blanket for PPCS reactor are significantly relaxed. Nevertheless, further efforts have to be focused in lowering the required <b>Coolant</b> <b>Purification</b> System (CPS) feed flow-rate which still remains the most critical tritium processing subsystem...|$|E

40|$|In {{view of the}} ITER {{conceptual}} design review, {{the design of the}} ancillary systems of the European test blanket systems presented in [1] has been updated and made consistent with the ITER requirements for the present design phase. Europe is developing two concepts of TBM, the helium cooled lithium lead (HCLL) and the helium cooled pebble bed (HCPB) one, having in common the cooling media, pressurized helium at 8 MPa [2]. TBS, namely helium cooling system (HCS), <b>coolant</b> <b>purification</b> system (CPS), lead lithium loop and tritium extraction/removal system (TES–TRS) have the purpose to cool down the TBM and to remove tritium to be driven to TEP from breeder and coolant.

40|$|In a high {{temperature}} reactor, tritium {{is produced by}} a number of mechanisms. Due to its high mobility, some of this tritium ends up in the primary helium cooling circuit from where it can be extracted by the <b>coolant</b> <b>purification</b> system to keep the partial pressure of tritiated compounds low. The remaining partial pressure of tritium in the coolant is the driving force for permeation across the heat exchanger from the primary cooling system into the secondary cooling system. From there the contamination may further propagate and ultimately escape into the environment. This paper summarizes a study on the different tritium control options capable of meeting possible future safety requirements. Our results indicate that compliance with plausible tritium control requirements can indeed be achieved with reasonable effort both for electricity generation using a closed steam cycle and for process steam generation with an open steam cycle. However, for new-build HTR, definite country-specific licensing requirements (e. g. chronic and accidental tritium release) are yet to be determined and will shape the required tritium control strategy.

Karbonmonoksida adalah spesi yang sulit dipisahkan dari helium pendingin reaktor karena mempunyai ukuran molekul relatif kecil sehingga diperlukan proses konversi menjadi karbondioksida. Laju konversi karbonmonoksida dalam sistem purifikasi dipengaruhi oleh beberapa {{parameter}} diantaranya konsentrasi, temperatur dan laju alir massa. Dalam penelitian ini dilakukan optimasi laju alir massa dalam purifikasi pendingin RGTT 200 K untuk proses konversi karbonmonoksida. Optimasi dilakukan melalui simulasi proses konversi karbonmonoksida menggunakan perangkat lunak Super Pro Designer. Laju pengurangan spesi reaktan, laju pertumbuhan spesi antara dan spesi produk dalam kesetimbangan reaksi konversi dianalisis untuk memperoleh optimasi laju alir massa purifikasi terhadap proses konversi karbonmonoksida. Tujuan penelitian ini adalah menyediakan data laju alir massa purifikasi untuk pembuatan dasar desain sistem purifikasi helium pendingin RGTT 200 K. Hasil analisis menunjukkan bahwa pada laju alir massa 0, 6 kg/detik proses konversi belum optimal, pada laju alir massa 1, 2 kg/detik mencapai optimal dan pada laju alir 3, 6 kg/detik s/d 12, 0 kg/detik tidak efektif. Untuk memdukung dasar desain sistem purifikasi helium pendingin RGTT 200 K maka laju alir massa purifikasi untuk proses konversi karbonmonoksida digunakan laju alir massa 1, 2 kg/detik.

Carbonmonoxide is {{a species}} {{that is difficult to}} be separated from the reactor coolant helium because it has a relatively small molecular size.   So it needs a process of conversion from carbonmonoxide to carbondioxide. The rate of conversion of carbonmonoxide in the purification system is influenced by several parameters including concentration, temperature and mass flow rate. In this research, optimization of the mass flow rate in <b>coolant</b> <b>purification</b> of RGTT 200 K for carbonmonoxide conversion process was done. Optimization is carried out by using software Super Pro Designer. The rate of reduction of reactant species, the growth rate between the species and the species products in the conversion reactions equilibrium were analyzed to derive the mass flow rate optimization of purification for carbonmonoxide conversion process. The {{purpose of this study is}} to find  the mass flow rate of purification for the preparation of the basic design of the RGTT 200 K coolant helium purification system. The analysis showed that the helium mass flow rate of 0. 6 kg/second resulted in an unoptimal conversion process. The optimal conversion process was reached at a mass flow rate of 1. 2 kg/second. A flow rate of 3. 6 kg/second – 12 kg/second resulted in an ineffective process. For supporting the basic design of the  RGTT 200 K helium purification system, the mass flow rate for carbonmonoxide conversion process is suggested to be 1. 2 kg/second.

40|$|Recently, {{attention}} has been drawn to the viability of using S-CO(2) as a working fluid in modern reactor designs. Near the critical point, CO 2 has a rapid rise in density allowing {{a significant reduction in}} the compressor work of a closed Brayton Cycle. Therefore, 45 % efficiency can be achieved at much more moderate temperatures than is optimal for the helium Brayton cycles. An additional benefit of the S-CO 2 system is its universal applicability as an indirect secondary Power Conversion System (PCS) coupled to most GEN-IV concept reactors, as well as fusion reactors. The United States DOE's GNEP is now focusing on the liquid Na cooled primary as an alternative to conventional Rankine steam cycles. This primary would also benefit from being coupled to an S-CO 2 PCS. Despite current progress on designing the S-CO 2 PCS, little work has focused on the principal supporting systems required. Many of the required auxiliary systems are similar to those used in other nuclear or fossil-fired units; others have specialized requirements when CO 2 is used as the working fluid, and are therefore given attention in this thesis.

We have done this {{on the basis of the}} Chinese HTR-PM reactor. For this purpose, a conceptual steam generator lay-out based on the Fort Saint Vrain design (helical coil tube bundle type with Incoloy 800 as the tube material) was assumed, both for the rather conservative HTR-PM temperatures and for higher temperatures. Using the obtained steam generator characteristics in combination with a tritium balance sheet and reasonable assumptions on operating conditions and safety requirements, we described the individual and combined effect of several operating parameters on tritium control. Our results indicate that compliance with plausible tritium control requirements can indeed be achieved with reasonable effort both for electricity generation using a closed steam cycle and for process steam generation with an open steam cycle.
