Data of several <b>climate</b> <b>components</b> from 2000 - 2010 were collected from weather stations that located separately. The land covers were dominated with cropland and little forest on eastern site, and settlements (urban) on western site. This study confirmed that the decrease in 13. 1 % of paddy field {{and the increase in}} 12. 4 % of barren land had significantly resulted in low daily actual vapor pressure (ea) during dry months with low rainfalls. The eastern areas that were originally occupied by croplands and trees, responded to the decrease of paddy fields by the increasing of air temperatures.

Two periods in the geological past are explored; the Middle Miocene and the mid-Pliocene. For both periods, foraminiferal oxygen-isotope records from deep-sea sediment cores as well as stratigraphical data, suggest a global sea-level lowering. The magnitude of these reductions in sea level indicate large-scale ice-sheet build-up. However, the origin of these events and even the geographic locations of the ice sheets, are still under discussion. The ice sheet-climate model developed in this study provides a tool to test some of the hypotheses brought forward to explain the ice-sheet expansion events. It describes the Antarctic ice sheet and is forced by a <b>climate</b> <b>component</b> based on energy and mass balances. Further more, the model computes the oxygen-isotopic composition of the ice-sheet, thereby providing the possibility to compare numerical results directly to deep-sea sediment records.

40|$|A new {{mechanism}} is proposed in which climate, carbon cycle and icesheets {{interact with each}} other to produce a feedback that can produce quasi- 100 &nbsp;ky glacial-interglacial cycles. A key process is the burial and preservation of organic carbon by icesheets. The switch from glacial maximum to deglaciation is triggered by the ejection of glacial burial carbon when icesheets grow to sufficiently large size and subglacial transport becomes significant. Glacial inception is initiated by CO 2 drawdown due to a ''rebound'' from a high but transient interglacial CO 2 value as the land-originated CO 2 invades into deep ocean via thermohaline circulation and CaCO 3 compensation. Also important for glacial inception is the CO 2 uptake by vegetation regrowth in the previously ice-covered boreal regions. When tested using a fully coupled Earth system model with comprehensive carbon cycle components and semi-empirical physical <b>climate</b> <b>components,</b> it produced self-sustaining glacial-interglacial cycles of duration about 93 &nbsp;ky, CO 2 change of 90 ppmv, temperature change of 6 &deg;C under certain parameter regimes.
