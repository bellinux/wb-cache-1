50|$|Near end {{crosstalk}} (NEXT): NEXT is {{a measure}} of the ability of cabling to reject <b>crosstalk.</b> <b>Interference</b> between two pairs in a cable is measured at the same end of the cable as the interfering transmitter. Crosstalk is undesirable. In crosstalk, the signals traveling through adjacent pairs of wire in twisted-pair cabling interfere with each other. The pair causing the interference is called the “disturbing pair,” while the pair experiencing the interference is the “disturbed pair.” Channel NEXT is the NEXT value measured between one wire pair and another in the same cable; NEXT is measured at both ends of the wire. The NEXT value for a given cable type is generally expressed in decibels per feet or decibels per 1000 feet. NEXT value varies with the frequency of transmission. The higher the NEXT value, the greater the cable’s ability to reject crosstalk at its local connection. Generally specifications for cabling (such as CAT 5) include the minimum NEXT values.|$|E

30|$|This {{problem is}} known to be NP-complete [25], even with one channel and without {{considering}} the CR constraint in Equation (3). The main problem is the interference among users. As shown in [26], if the <b>crosstalk</b> <b>interference</b> is larger than some value (see [26]), the optimal RRA is an FDMA type allocation. In fact, if the crosstalk exists but is very small (e.g., imagine very far apart set of transceivers), then the optimal solution could even be obtained using distributed approach (e.g., iterative waterfilling) to converge to a unique Nash equilibrium (NE). If the crosstalk is not negligible, multiple NE points can exist, which can be far from the social optimum.|$|E

It significantly suppresses the crosstalk degradation and ensures the quality of service (QoS) on the SDSL transmission throughput. Moreover, the enhancement of the SDSL receiver can benefit on the extension of the SDSL deployment coverage range and also guarantees its promising data rates on increasing numbers of customer subscribers. 1...|$|E
