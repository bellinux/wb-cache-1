Although this bypass flow may reduce the overall sonic boom signature of the vehicle, the engine gearbox and protuberances create a highly complex 3 -D flow in the annular bypass region. To better understand the 3 -D flow features, an approximately 1 / 6 th engine model was tested in a newly constructed 11. 1 inch diameter axisymmetric test section of a subsonic wind tunnel at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign. By rotating the test section, pressure measurements were obtained over a range of circumferential angles and radial positions.
