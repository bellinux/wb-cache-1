40|$|This paper {{presents}} the interim {{findings of a}} series of listening tests designed i) to test {{the extent to which the}} relative positions of sounds inhabiting a simple three dimensional <b>co-ordinate</b> <b>space,</b> whose axes are formant centre frequencies, are reflected in perceptual distances between those sounds, and how this varies through the space, ii) to establish the perceptual granularity of the space – how the maximum distance between two sounds in the space where no difference can be heard varies throughout the <b>co-ordinate</b> <b>space,</b> and iii) the extent to which the results of i) and ii) corelate. The paper concludes that, firstly, subjects are in general, able to perceive relative distances in this <b>co-ordinate</b> <b>space,</b> and that ability varies throughout the space, and that secondly, the ability to discriminate timbral shifts varies quite considerably in the space. In both cases, the shift in the second formant centre frequency seems to be salient; some errors in test data, however, prevent any firm conclusion on the extent to which the results of i) and ii) corelate. The purpose of this study is to provide empirical data to inform the development of more intuitive user interfaces for timbre specification...|$|R

Elastic partial scattering cross sections for proton scattering in inverse kinematics have been calculated using the theoretically obtained densities for some of the nuclei and compared with available experimental data.

Namely, {{that plane}} sections normal to the neutral axis remain plane but that their displacements and rotations can be arbitrarily large. The strains {{are assumed to}} be small enough to neglect material nonlinearity, which means that each section is a rigid body. The nonlinear analysis of such a system can lead to a complex formulation when second Piola-Kirchoff stress and Green-Lagrange strain tensors are used. Alternatively, Lie groups and algebras offer a efficient formulation by considering the space of mechanical system transformations (the SE 3 group) instead of the generalised <b>co-ordinates</b> <b>space</b> (R 3). The intrinsic nonlinearities due to the curvature of the group SE 3 (geometric nonlinearities) are correctly handled and this leads to a compact and exact form of the nonlinear equilibrium equations from which further models can easily be derived.

The success of such an algorithm clearly depends on establishing suitable mapping between its quantifiable features and its perceptual features. We therefore present here, firstly, some of the findings of a series of listening tests aimed at establishing the perceptual topography and granularity of a simple, predefined timbre space, and secondly, the results of preliminary tests of two search strategies designed to navigate this space. The behaviour of these strategies in a circumscribed space of this kind, together with the corresponding user experience is intended to provide a baseline to applications in a more complex space...|$|R

40|$|Effective map {{generalisation}} involves {{careful examination}} of the interactions between all map symbols. These interactions may give rise to obvious graphic conflicts of proximity and overlap. They may also determine whether important messages, regarding the structure and form of the mapped features, are effectively communicated (for example, in the alignment of buildings, parallelism between neighbouring rivers and roads, and the clustering of woods and lakes). Graphic conflict can be addressed {{by a combination of}} possible actions such as elimination, displacement, amalgamation and boundary simplification, combined with appropriate techniques for evaluating the quality of the result. However, the application of an individual operator may have an effect on a map symbol that was not previously in conflict, resulting in propagation of conflict within the map space. A partial solution to this problem is for objects to be moved after scaling so that they remain distinct, visual entities. The research presented here, which is related to previous work [1] [2], describes a procedure that makes use of the displacement of multiple map objects in order to resolve graphic conflict.

40|$|Neutron rich Ca and Ni nuclei {{have been}} studied in spherical Relativistic Mean Field {{formalism}} in <b>co-ordinate</b> <b>space.</b> A delta interaction has been has been adopted to treat the pairing correlations for the neutrons. Odd nuclei have been treated in the blocking approximation. The effect of the positive energy continuum {{and the role of}} pairing in the stability of nuclei have been investigated using the resonant-BCS (rBCS) approach. In Ca isotopes, N= 50 is no longer a magic number while in Ni nuclei, a new magic number emerges at N= 70. There is a remarkable difference in the relative positions of the drip lines for odd and even isotopes. In Ca isotopes, the last bound even and odd nuclei are found to be $^{ 72 }$Ca and $^{ 59 }$Ca, respectively. In Ni isotopes, the corresponding nuclei are $^{ 98 }$Ni and $^{ 97 }$Ni, respectively. The origin of this difference in relative positions of the dripline in even and odd isotopes in the two chain is traced to the difference in the single particle level structures and consequent modification in the magic numbers in the two elements. Pairing interaction is seen to play a major role. The effect of the width of the resonance states on pairing has also been investigated. Comment: To appear in Physical Review...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{advances}} {{in the treatment of}} scattering of charged composite particles are reviewed. In a first part I report on developments of the theory. Specifically I describe the recent completion of the derivation of the <b>co-ordinate</b> <b>space</b> asymptotic behaviour of the wave function for three charged particles in the continuum. This knowledge is increasingly being made use of in attempts to `derive' three-Coulomb particle wave functions to be used in all of configuration space which are solutions of the Schroedinger equation, though not everywhere but at least in one or preferably all of the asymptotic regions. Their practical application in approximate calculations of ionisation and breakup processes is pointed out. The asymptotic three-charged particle wave functions find further use in investigations of asymptotic and analytic properties of matrix elements of the three-body Coulomb resolvent. An important example is the nonperturbative derivation, valid for all energies, of the large-distance behaviour of the optical potential. In the second part I describe renewed attempts to establish the few-body approach as a valuable tool for calculating (energetic) atomic collision processes. At the end I briefly touch upon the recent successful above-breakup-threshold calculation of proton-deuteron elastic scattering for a realistic potential.

40|$|As both {{simulations}} {{and observations}} reach {{the resolution of}} the star-forming molecular clouds, it becomes important to clarify if these two techniques are discussing the same objects in galaxies. We compare clouds formed in a high resolution galaxy simulation identified as continuous structures within a contour, in the simulator's position-position-position (PPP) <b>co-ordinate</b> <b>space</b> and the observer's position-position-velocity space (PPV). Results indicate that the properties of the cloud populations are similar in both methods and up to 70 % of clouds have a single counterpart in the opposite data structure. Comparing individual clouds in a one-to-one match reveals a scatter in properties mostly within a factor of two. However, the small variations in mass, radius and velocity dispersion produce significant differences in derived quantities such as the virial parameter. This makes it difficult to determine if a structure is truely gravitationally bound. The three cloud types originally found in the simulation in Fujimoto et al. (2014) are identified in both data sets, with around 80 % of the clouds retaining their type between identification methods. We also compared our results when using a peak decomposition method to identify clouds in both PPP and PPV space. The number of clouds increased with this technique, but the overall cloud properties remained similar. However, the more crowded environment lowered the ability to match clouds between techniques to 40 %. The three cloud types also became harder to separate, especially in the PPV data set. The method used for cloud identification therefore plays a critical role in determining cloud properties, but both PPP and PPV can potentially identify the same structures.
