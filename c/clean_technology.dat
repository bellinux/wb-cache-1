5|$|Pernick and Wilder {{highlight}} eight major <b>clean</b> <b>technology</b> sectors: solar power, wind power, biofuels, green buildings, personal transportation, {{the smart}} grid, mobile applications, and water filtration. Six major forces, which {{they call the}} six C’s, are pushing <b>clean</b> <b>technology</b> into the mainstream: costs, capital, competition, China, consumers, and climate. Very large corporations such as GE, Toyota and Sharp, and investment firms such as Goldman Sachs are making multibillion-dollar investments in <b>clean</b> <b>technology.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{pollution}} problems resulting from industrial production activities {{result in the}} deterioration of our natural environment. That is why {{something needs to be}} done in order to preserve our environment. Conservation alone is not enough. Development is needed. Waste minimisation through applying <b>Cleaner</b> <b>Technologies</b> can help the country in the reduction of waste production and improve industry's environmental management processes. This study was based on an investigation into the adoption of <b>Cleaner</b> <b>Technology.</b> The study argues that elements of <b>Cleaner</b> <b>Technology</b> and the application of tools and strategies to practice <b>Cleaner</b> <b>Technology</b> are very useful for any industry.

5|$|Several {{financial}} institutions and banks have headquarters in Copenhagen, including Alm. Brand, Danske Bank, Nykredit and Nordea Bank Danmark. The Copenhagen Stock Exchange (CSE) was founded in 1620 and is now owned by Nasdaq, Inc.. Copenhagen {{is also home to}} a number of international companies including A.P. Møller-Mærsk, Novo Nordisk, Carlsberg and Novozymes. City authorities have encouraged the development of business clusters in several innovative sectors, which include information technology, biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, <b>clean</b> <b>technology</b> and smart city solutions.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the turn}} of the 21st century, Copenhagen has seen strong urban and {{cultural}} development, facilitated by investment in its institutions and infrastructure. The city is the cultural, economic and governmental centre of Denmark; {{it is one of the}} major financial centres of Northern Europe with the Copenhagen Stock Exchange. Copenhagen's economy has seen rapid developments in the service sector, especially through initiatives in information technology, pharmaceuticals and <b>clean</b> <b>technology.</b> Since the completion of the Øresund Bridge, Copenhagen has become increasingly integrated with the Swedish province of Scania and its largest city, Malmö, forming the Øresund Region. With a number of bridges connecting the various districts, the cityscape is characterised by parks, promenades and waterfronts. Copenhagen's landmarks such as Tivoli Gardens, The Little Mermaid statue, the Amalienborg and Christiansborg palaces, Rosenborg Castle Gardens, Frederik's Church, and many museums, restaurants and nightclubs are significant tourist attractions.|$|E
5|$|With the {{development}} of the rail network in the 19th century, Roskilde became an important hub for traffic with Copenhagen, {{and by the end of}} the century, there were tobacco factories, iron foundries and machine shops. Among the largest private sector employers today are the IT firm BEC (Bankernes EDB Central) and GPI (Glim Plastic Industri), specializing in plastics. The Risø research facility is also becoming a major employer, extending interest in sustainable energy to the <b>clean</b> <b>technology</b> sphere. The local university, founded in 1972, the historic Cathedral School, and the Danish Meat Trade College, established in 1964, are educational institutions of note. Roskilde has a large local hospital which has been expanded and modernized since it was opened in 1855. It is now increasingly active in the research sphere. The Sankt Hans psychiatric hospital serves the Capital Region with specialized facilities for forensic psychiatry.|$|E

5000|$|The 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen, Denmark was {{expected}} to create a framework whereby limits would eventually be placed on greenhouse gas emissions. Many proponents of the cleantech industry hoped for an agreement to be established there to replace the Kyoto Protocol. As this treaty {{was expected}}, scholars had suggested a profound and inevitable shift from [...] "business as usual." [...] However, the participating States failed to provide a global framework for <b>clean</b> <b>technologies.</b> The outburst of the 2008 economic crisis then hampered private investments in <b>clean</b> <b>technologies,</b> which were back at their 2007 level only in 2014.

40|$|How {{much should}} governments subsidize the {{development}} of new <b>clean</b> <b>technologies?</b> We use patent citation data to investigate the relative intensity of knowledge spillovers in <b>clean</b> and dirty <b>technologies</b> in two technological fields: energy production and transportation. We introduce a new methodology that takes into account the whole history of patent citations to capture the indirect knowledge spillovers generated by patents. We find that conditional {{on a wide range of}} potential confounding factors clean patents receive on average 43 % more citations than dirty patents. Knowledge spillovers from <b>clean</b> <b>technologies</b> are comparable in scale to those observed in the IT sector. The radical novelty of <b>clean</b> <b>technologies</b> relative to more incremental dirty inventions seems to account for their superiority. Our results can support public support for clean R&D. They also suggest that green policies might be able to boost economic growth through induced knowledge spillovers...|$|R

We present empirical evidence for the impact of various policies on the development of <b>clean</b> <b>technologies</b> and use this to identify what the appropriate policy mix should look like. We present an overview of policies currently in place to support the development of <b>clean</b> <b>technologies</b> across Europe and compare the current policy landscape to the appropriate policy portfolio.

40|$|The {{construction}} industry has great opportunities to significantly reduce CO 2 emissions by improving the energy efficiency of residential buildings. However, in this industry, diffusion of cost-effective <b>clean</b> <b>technologies</b> has been notoriously slow and below potential. This paper {{sheds light on}} factors that explain why construction companies {{have been reluctant to}} adopt energy-efficient technologies. It questions why some companies have intensified their investments in <b>clean</b> <b>technologies,</b> while others are lagging behind. Based on a multiple case study of four Dutch building contractors, the paper shows that contractors that actively gather information and build internal technical capacity are keener on adopting energy-efficient technologies. Findings also reveal {{that it will be a}} major challenge for the {{construction industry}} to communicate the advantages of <b>clean</b> <b>technologies</b> to (potential) home buyers and create market demand...|$|R
