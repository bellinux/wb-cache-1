5|$|There {{were three}} {{telephones}} {{at the farm}} on the night, {{all on the same}} landline. There was usually a <b>cordless</b> <b>phone</b> with a memory-recall feature in the kitchen; a beige digital phone, also kept in the kitchen; and a cream rotary phone in the main bedroom. (There was normally a fourth phone too, a blue digital phone in the first-floor office, but it had been sent for repairs on 5 August.) The rotary phone had at some point been moved out of the bedroom and into the kitchen, where the police found it after the murders with its receiver off the hook. They found the beige digital phone under a pile of magazines in the kitchen.|$|E
25|$|On 21 March 2007, the Telecommunications Industry Association {{issued the}} TIA-1083 standard, which gives {{manufacturers}} of cordless telephones {{the ability to}} test their products for compatibility with most hearing aids that have a T-Coil magnetic coupling mode.

25|$|An 18-hour {{standoff}} ensued {{during which}} time the police talked over the phone to Bryant, still calling himself Jamie. He requested a helicopter, saying {{that he wanted to}} be flown to a plane and then on to Adelaide, South Australia. He said that if the helicopter arrived, he would release Pears and only keep Noelene Martin. Bryant could see the movements of SOG officers, and continually demanded their retreat each time they began to approach the house. As he appeared to have excellent awareness of the events unfurling around him, despite the pitch black of night, the police believed he had some kind of visual aid device; none was ever found, however. A man was spotted on the roof of an adjacent building at one point, believed to be Bryant. Later in the night, the <b>cordless</b> <b>phone</b> Bryant was using began to run low on batteries. Police tried unsuccessfully to get him to return the phone to the charger, but it went dead and there were no further communications.|$|E

500|$|A {{study on}} the non-thermal effects of radio {{frequency}} (RF) on honey bees (Apis mellifera carnica) reported there were no changes in behavior due to RF exposure from DECT <b>cordless</b> <b>phone</b> base stations operating at 1,880â€“1,900MHz [...] however, a later study established that close-range electromagnetic field (EMF) may reduce the ability of bees {{to return to their}} hive. In the course of their study, one half of their colonies broke down, including some control hives that did not have embedded DECT base stations. In April 2007, news of this study appeared in various media outlets, beginning with an article in The Independent, which stated that the subject of the study included mobile phones and had related them to CCD. Though cellular phones were implicated by other media reports at the time, they were not covered in the study. Researchers involved have since stated that their research did not include findings on cell phones, or their relationship to CCD, and indicated that the Independent article had misinterpreted their results and created [...] "a horror story".|$|E

50|$|Many <b>cordless</b> <b>phones</b> in {{the early}} 21st century are digital. Digital {{technology}} has helped provide clear sound and limit eavesdropping. Many <b>cordless</b> <b>phones</b> have one main base station and {{can add up to}} three or four additional bases. This allows for multiple voice channels that allow three-way conference calls between the bases. This technology also allows multiple handsets to be used at the same time, and up to two handsets can have separate conversations with outside parties.|$|R

50|$|DECT was {{originally}} intended for fast roaming between networked base stations {{and the first}} DECT product was Net3 wireless LAN. However its most popular application is single-cell <b>cordless</b> <b>phones</b> connected to traditional analog telephone, primarily in home and small office systems, though gateways with multi-cell DECT and/or DECT repeaters are also available in many private branch exchange (PBX) systems for medium and large businesses. DECT {{can also be used}} for purposes other than <b>cordless</b> <b>phones,</b> such as baby monitors and industrial sensors. DECT ULE is a variant tailored for home security and automation.|$|R
50|$|However, {{the higher}} {{frequency}} often brings advantages. The 900 MHz and 2.4 GHz band {{are increasingly being}} used {{for a host of}} other devices, including baby monitor, microwave oven, Bluetooth, and wireless LAN; thus, it is likely that a <b>cordless</b> <b>phone</b> will suffer interference from signals broadcast by those devices, and also may itself generate interference. It is also possible for a <b>cordless</b> <b>phone</b> to interfere with the 802.11a wireless standard, as the 802.11a standard can be configured to operate in the 5.8 GHz range. However, this can easily be fixed by reconfiguring the wireless LAN device to work in the 5.180 GHz to 5.320 GHz band.|$|E
50|$|GIP is a DECT profile, {{meaning a}} set of {{protocols}} that runs over the base DECT system. The most popular profile for DECT is GAP, {{which is used to}} provide <b>cordless</b> <b>phone</b> service, but this is not used for GIP.|$|E
50|$|A {{forerunner of}} these types of network was the CT2 <b>cordless</b> <b>phone</b> system, which {{provided}} access to a looser network (without handover), again with base stations deployed in areas where large numbers of people might need to make calls. CT2's limitations ensured the concept never took off. CT2's successor, DECT, was provided with an interworking profile, GIP so that GSM networks could make use of it for microcellular access, but in practice the success of GSM within Europe, and the ability of GSM to support microcells without using alternative technologies, meant GIP was rarely used, and DECT's use in general was limited to non-GSM private networks, including use as <b>cordless</b> <b>phone</b> systems.|$|E

50|$|While DECT <b>cordless</b> <b>phones</b> and Mobile WiMAX {{standards}} formally also {{fulfill the}} IMT-2000 requirements, {{they are not}} usually considered due to their rarity and unsuitability for usage with mobile phones.|$|R
