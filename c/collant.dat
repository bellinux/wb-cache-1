Eur.Port. aterragem). Brazilian Portuguese (BP) also tends to adopt culture-bound concepts from French, {{but when it comes to}} technology, the major influence is from English, while European Portuguese (EP) tends to adopt technological terms from French. That is the difference between BP estação (station) and EP gare (train station) (Portugal also uses Estação). BP. trem from English train but ultimately from French and EP comboio from Fr. [...] "convoi". An evident example of the dichotomy between English and French influences can be noted in the use of the expressions know-how, used in a technical context, and savoir-faire in a social context. Portugal uses the expression hora de ponta from French [...] "lheure de pointe" [...] to refer to the rush hour while Brazil has the usage of horário de pico, horário de pique (rush hours/period) and hora do rush. And both bilhar from French [...] "billard" [...] and Lusitanate sinuca are interchangeably used for snooker.|$|E

The first of these, common {{to many of the}} Carmen films, is the fear of women’s increasing independence, linked {{to the development of the}} post-war consumer culture. The second is a converging concern with the Algerian War, hidden deep in the films, but emerging symptomatically through, amongst other features, the choice of star in one of the films (Jacques Charrier), the fear of the ‘foreign’, and the dilution of Carmen as a nineteenth-century French heritage icon...|$|R

The goal of {{the present}} paper is to {{calculate}} the limit spectrum of the Hodge-de Rham operator under the perturbation of collapsing {{one part of a}} manifold obtained by gluing together two manifolds with the same boundary. It appears to take place in the general problem of blowing-up conical singularities as introduced in Mazzeo [Ma 06] and Rowlett [Ro 06, Ro 08]. Résumé. Nous calculons la limite du spectre de l’opérateur de Hodge-de Rham sur les formes différentielles dans le cas d’éffondrement d’une partie d’une variété obtenue en <b>collant</b> deux variétés de même bord. Ce résultat apporte un nouvel éclairage aux questions de blowing up conical singularities introduites par Mazzeo [Ma 06] et Rowlett [Ro 06, Ro 08]. 1. Introduction. This work takes place in the general context of the spectral studies of singular perturbations of the metrics, as a manner to know what are the topological or metrical meanings carried by the spectrum of geometric operators. We can mention in this direction, without exhaustivity, studies on the adiabatic limits ([MM 90]...|$|E

During the experiments, the overall propellant mixture ratio was varied from 4. 4 to 6. 6, while the mixture ratios in the core and outer zone were varied from 5. 7 to 8. 8 and from 3. 7 to 7. 2, respectively. A nominal 10 {{percent of the total}} fuel flow was used as boundary layer <b>collant</b> in a majority of the firings. Nominal chamber pressure was either 225 or 250 psia, with nozzle expansion ratios of either 25 : 1 or 4 : 1. Measurements of the axial chamber pressure and wall heat flux profiles, together with samples of the exhaust gas, were obtained. The corrected experimental specific impulse and characteristic exhaust velocity efficiencies were approximately 97. 5 and 98. 5 percent, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Most liquid {{insulators}} or dielectrics {{used all}} over the world today are mineral oil *Surya, 2008 +. These substances are non-renewable and pose environmental challenges, hence a need for alternative sources. In this work, attempts have been made in other to evaluate some dielectric properties of olive oil so as to replace the existing dielectric substances by which environment stand at risk when spills occur. Thus we were able to calculate the dielectric constant, pH value, electrical conductivity, refractive index and viscocity of the olive sample. The results of the analysed parameters indicated that olive oil has a dielectric constant of 3. 065, pH value of 6. 8, electrical conductivity of zero micro-siemen (0 µS), refractive index of 1. 4656 at 30. 2 oC and 1. 4657 at 29. 9 oC, viscocity of 83. 89 cP at 20 oC. From the results it shows that olive oil is a bad conductor of electric charge and can be used in the fabrication of capacitors for effective capacitance, used as <b>collant</b> in transformers, used as insulators etc and its pose less enviromental danger when spill. Therfore olive oi...|$|E
40|$|Rocket engines using {{liquid oxygen}} (LOX) and {{hydrocarbon}} fuel as the propellants are being given serious consideration for future launch vehicle propulsion. Normally, the fuel {{is used to}} regeneratively cool the combustion chamber. However, hydrocarbons such as RP- 1 are limited in their cooling capability. Another possibility for the coolant is the liquid oxygen. Combustion chambers previously tested with LOX and RP- 1 as propellants and LOX as the <b>collant</b> demonstrated the feasibility of using liquid oxygen as a coolant up to a chamber pressure of 13. 8 MPa (2000 psia). However, there was concern as to {{the effect on the}} integrity of the chamber liner if oxygen leaks into the combustion zone through fatigue cracks that may develop between the cooling passages and the hot gas side wall. In order to study this effect, chambers were fabricated with slots machined upstream of the throat between the cooling passage wall and the hot gas side wall to simulate cracks. The chambers were tested at a nominal chamber pressure of 8. 6 MPa (1247 psia) over a range of mixture ratios from 1. 9 to 3. 1 using liquid oxygen as the coolant. The results of the testing showed that the leaking LOX did not have a deleterious effect on the chambers in the region of the slots. However, there was unexplained melting in the throat region of both chambers, but not in line with the slots...|$|E
40|$|The Westinghouse AP 1000 is a {{new design}} nuclear power plant which has {{implemented}} the concept of passive system. Even though a passive system may be more reliable than an active one, {{the possibility of the}} passive system to fail still exists. In line with this possibility, generic database have been used to study the reliability of the AP 1000 passive safety system. However, since the used data are not specific to the AP 1000, the results of the analysis will not show its real performance. This study proposes a fuzzy reliability approach to overcome this problem. The proposed fuzzy reliability approach utilizes the concept of failure possibility to qualitatively describe basic event likely occurences and membership functions of triangular fuzzy numbers to quantitatively represent qualitative failure possibilities. A case-based experiment on reliability study of the AP 1000 passive safety system involved to mitigate a large break loss of <b>collant</b> accident is used to validate the feasibility of the proposed approach. By comparisons, probabilities of basic events generated by the proposed approach are very close to the ones which have been used by previous reliability studies. This can be observed from the small numbers of relative errors, i. e. between 0. 004125 and 0. 079635. These results confirm that the fuzzy reliability approach offers a more realistic technique to study the reliability of the AP 1000 passive safety system without the need to engage to precise probability distributions of its components which are currently unavailable.
