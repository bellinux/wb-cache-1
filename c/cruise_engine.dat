50|$|There are two {{distinctive}} versions, 1-10 and 11-13. The former {{could be}} distinguished {{by having a}} higher superstructure. All were equipped with three Soviet-made V-12 diesel engines. There was no separate <b>cruise</b> <b>engine,</b> except from a small auxiliary engine that produced electricity. The vessels were first equipped with large screws, but later changed to smaller, albeit equally effective screws, manufactured by Finnscrew.|$|E

500|$|In {{an effort}} to extend her range, Rossia was built with an unusual {{machinery}} arrangement. One large vertical triple expansion (VTE) steam engine drove each of the outer propeller shafts while a small <b>cruising</b> VTE <b>engine</b> drove the center shaft. At full speed the center propeller had to be uncoupled as {{there was not enough}} steam to drive all three engines simultaneously; the outer propellers were uncoupled when cruising. The two main engines were designed for a total of , but they developed [...] on trials and drove the ship to a maximum speed of [...] The <b>cruising</b> <b>engine</b> developed [...] Thirty-two Belleville water-tube boilers provided steam for the engines.|$|R

The ship sailed to the United Kingdom where she was joined by a mobile repair team which replaced the engine.|$|E
50|$|The VAK 191B {{was similar}} in concept to the British Harrier, but was {{designed}} for a supersonic dash capability (Mach number 1.2-1.4) at medium to high altitudes. It was judged that having a single engine would create too much drag, but the two lift engines were dead weight in cruise, and the small <b>cruise</b> <b>engine</b> gave a poor thrust to weight ratio. It also had very small highly loaded wings. By contrast, the Harrier had a much higher thrust-to-weight ratio, it was effective as a dogfighter, and had larger wings which were {{put to good use}} in rolling short takeoffs.|$|E
50|$|The Short SC.1 was a single-seat {{low wing}} {{tailless}} delta wing aircraft of approximately 8,000 lb all-up weight (max. 7,700 lb for vertical flight). It was {{powered by a}} total of four vertically mounted, lightweight Rolls-Royce RB108 lift engines that provided a total vertical thrust of 8,600 lb, along with a single RB.108 <b>cruise</b> <b>engine</b> {{in the rear of the}} aircraft to provide thrust for forward flight. The lift engines were mounted vertically in side-by-side pairs in a central bay so that their resultant thrust line passed close to the centre of gravity of the aircraft. These pairs of engines could be swivelled about transverse axes; they were therefore able to produce vectored thrust for acceleration/deceleration along the aircraft's longitudinal axis.|$|E

50|$|When {{a second}} wave of Grupo 5 Skyhawks attacked, Brilliants Sea Wolf failed and the jets each {{released}} three bombs. One bomb from Skyhawk (C-248) piloted by Lt Gavazzi, damaged Glasgow, although it did not explode, passing clean through the aft engine room, damaging fuel systems and disabling the two Tyne <b>cruise</b> <b>engines.</b> On his returning flight, Lt Gavazzi was shot down by friendly fire over Goose Green and killed.|$|R

Thirty-two Belleville water-tube boilers provided steam for the engines. She could carry a maximum of 2400 LT of coal. This gave her a radius of action of [...] at 10 kn.|$|R
50|$|During {{conventional}} flight, {{the lift}} engines would be inactive; shortly prior to entering vertical flight, compressed air {{provided by the}} single <b>cruise</b> <b>engine</b> {{would be used to}} accelerate the startup of the lift engines. Considerable attention was paid during development to the design of the air intake for the engines, while involved a set of 7 variable hinged grills which open in a forward-facing position to increase airflow to the lift engines; flow into the engines had to be relatively consistent and stable to avoid issues such as engine surges and vibration. Initially, the series of scuttles were fitted to the exit nozzles of the lift engines to maintain a low-pressure environment beneath the engines and ensure that that the turbine blades rotated in the correct direction; due to the effectiveness of the intake and engine refinements, the scuttles became unnecessary.|$|E
5000|$|Sea Dart is a two-stage, 4.4 m long missile {{weighing}} 550 kg. It is launched using a drop-off Chow solid-fuel booster that accelerates {{it to the}} {{supersonic speed}} necessary for {{the operation of the}} cruise motor, a Rolls-Royce Siddeley kerosene-fuelled Odin ramjet. This gives a cruise speed of over Mach 2.5, and unlike many rocket-powered designs the <b>cruise</b> <b>engine</b> burns for the entire flight, giving excellent terminal manoeuvrability at extreme range. It is capable of engaging targets out to at least [...] over a wide range of altitudes. It has a secondary capability against small surface vessels, tested against a , although in surface mode the warhead safety arming unit does not arm and thus damage inflicted is restricted to the physical impact of the half-ton missile body and the unspent proportion of the 46 L of kerosene fuel.|$|E
50|$|In {{the summer}} of 1943, a brand-new La-5 made a forced landing on a German {{airfield}} providing the Luftwaffe {{with an opportunity to}} test-fly the newest Soviet fighter. Test pilot Hans-Werner Lerche wrote a detailed report of his experience. He particularly noted that the La-5FN excelled at altitudes below 3,000 m (9,843 ft) but suffered from short range and flight time of only 40 minutes at <b>cruise</b> <b>engine</b> power. All of the engine controls (throttle, mixture, propeller pitch, radiator and cowl flaps, and supercharger gearbox) had separate levers which forced the pilot to make constant adjustments during combat or risk suboptimal performance. For example, rapid acceleration required moving no less than six levers. In contrast, contemporary German aircraft, especially the BMW 801 radial-engined variants of the Focke-Wulf Fw 190 front line fighter, had largely automatic engine controls with the pilot operating a single lever and electromechanical devices, like the Kommandogerät pioneering engine computer on the radial-engined Fw 190s, making the appropriate adjustments. Due to airflow limitations, the engine boost system (Forsazh) could not be used above 2,000 m (6,562 ft). Stability in all axes was generally good. The authority of the ailerons was deemed exceptional but the rudder was insufficiently powerful at lower speeds. At speeds in excess of 600 km/h (370 mph), the forces on control surfaces became excessive. Horizontal turn time at 1,000 m (3,281 ft) and maximum engine power was 25 seconds.|$|E
50|$|The turbines, {{supplied}} by Parsons, drove four shafts, with two propellers per shaft. The outer shafts were driven by high-pressure turbines {{and the inner}} shafts by low-pressure turbines, while the inner pair also was fitted with separate turbines for running astern. No <b>cruising</b> <b>engines</b> were fitted. Four Yarrow boilers fed the turbines, the uptakes from which were routed to three funnels. The ship had a contract speed of 31 kn, although Parsons expected the ship to reach speeds of at least 34 kn.|$|R
5000|$|The {{ship was}} powered by two Brown-Curtis steam turbines, each driving one {{propeller}} shaft using steam supplied by 3 Yarrow boilers. Designed for a maximum output of [...] and {{a speed of}} 30 kn, Audace handily exceeded this, reaching a speed of 34.5 kn during her sea trials while lightly loaded. Her intended German-built diesel <b>cruising</b> <b>engines</b> were not delivered because of the war. She had a cruising range of [...] at a speed of 15 kn and [...] at a speed of 30 kn.|$|R
50|$|Normal {{operating}} speed was 28,600 rpm. Maximum thrust was , 700 for <b>cruise.</b> The <b>engine</b> was 15.75 in in diameter, 79 inches long, and weighed only 300 lb dry.|$|R
50|$|Instead of lift engines {{or using}} a {{direct lift engine}} like the Rolls-Royce Pegasus in the Harrier Jump Jet, the X-35B was powered by the F119-PW-611 which used an {{innovative}} shaft-driven lift fan, patented by Lockheed Martin employee Paul Bevilaqua, and developed by Rolls-Royce. In normal wing-borne flight, the F119-PW-611 was configured as a normal reheated turbofan. Somewhat like a turboprop embedded into the fuselage, engine shaft power was diverted forward via a clutch-and-bevel gearbox to a vertically mounted, contra-rotating lift fan located forward of the main engine {{in the center of}} the aircraft. Bypass air from the <b>cruise</b> <b>engine</b> turbofan exhausted through a pair of roll-post nozzles in the wings on either side of the fuselage, while the thrust from the lift fan balanced the thrust of the core stream exhausting through vectored cruise nozzle at the tail. The X-35B powerplant effectively acted as a flow multiplier, much as a turbofan achieves efficiencies by moving unburned air at a lower velocity, and getting the same effect as the Harrier's huge, but supersonically impractical main fan. Like lift engines, this added machinery was dead weight during flight, but the increased lift thrust enhanced take-off payload by even more. The cool fan also reduced the harmful effects of hot, high-velocity air which could harm runway pavement or an aircraft carrier deck. Though risky and complicated, it was made to work to the satisfaction of DoD officials..|$|E

25|$|The {{suggested}} minimum noise take-off {{technique for}} the HS.141 {{was to use}} full power from the lift engines in a vertical climb to 250ft(76m) then reducing power to 83% to continue this climb to 1,000ft (300m). At this height the aircraft would transition into forward flight using vectored thrust from the lift engines and then accelerate and climb to 2,000ft (600m) using increasing thrust from the <b>cruise</b> <b>engines.</b> By this stage the aircraft would have reached an airspeed of 168knots (310km/h) and would be fully supported by its wings alone, the lift engines being shut down and covered by hinged doors.|$|R
