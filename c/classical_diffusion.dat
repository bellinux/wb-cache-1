40|$|We study {{an analog}} of the <b>classical</b> Arnol'd <b>diffusion</b> in a quantum system of two coupled {{non-linear}} oscillators {{one of which}} is governed by an external periodic force with two frequencies. In the classical model this very weak diffusion happens in a narrow stochastic layer along the coupling resonance, and leads to an increase of total energy of the system. We show that the quantum dynamics of wave packets mimics, up to some extent, global properties of the <b>classical</b> Arnol'd <b>diffusion.</b> This specific diffusion represents a new type of quantum dynamics, and may be observed, for example, in 2 D semiconductor structures (quantum billiards) perturbed by time-periodic external fields.

5000|$|How {{the plasma}} {{transport}} {{is reduced by}} {{the strength of the}} external magnetic field is of great concern in studying magnetic confinement of fusion plasma. The plasma diffusion may be classified by the <b>classical</b> <b>diffusion</b> of B−2 scaling, the Bohm diffusion conjectured to follow the B−1 [...] scaling, and the Hsu diffusion of B−3/2 scaling. Here, B is the external magnetic field.|$|E
5000|$|In {{light of}} the {{calculation}} above, {{it is tempting to}} think of Bohm diffusion as <b>classical</b> <b>diffusion</b> with an anomalous collision rate that maximizes the transport, but the physical picture is different. Anomalous diffusion is the result of turbulence. Regions of higher or lower electric potential result in eddies because the plasma moves around them with the E-cross-B drift velocity equal to E/B. These eddies play a similar role to the gyro-orbits in <b>classical</b> <b>diffusion,</b> except that the physics of the turbulence can be such that the decorrelation time is approximately equal to the turn-over time, resulting in Bohm scaling. Another {{way of looking at it}} is that the turbulent electric field is approximately equal to the potential perturbation divided by the scale length , and the potential perturbation can be expected to be a sizeable fraction of the kBT/e. The turbulent diffusion constant [...] is then independent of the scale length and is approximately equal to the Bohm value.|$|E

50|$|In a 3D plasma, the {{parallel}} decoherence (the decoherence along the field line) is significant enough {{to reduce the}} transport of ExB drifts to only the <b>classical</b> <b>diffusion.</b> There are, however, cyclotron harmonics that can cause resonance diffusion in the velocity space leading to an unbounded Larmor radius enlargement and particle diffusion. Hsu, Wu, Agarwal, and Ryu in 2013 proposed this effective diffusion mechanism by the combined effects from the ExB drift and the cyclotron resonance.|$|E
50|$|The plasma {{diffusion}} {{across the}} magnetic field is an important topic in magnetic confinement of fusion plasma. It is especially concerning how the plasma transport is reduced by {{the strength of the}} external magnetic field. The <b>classical</b> <b>diffusion</b> gives the 1/B2 scaling, while the Bohm diffusion, borne out of experimental observations from the early confinement machines, was conjectured to follow the 1/B scaling. The Hsu diffusion predicts the 1/B3/2 scaling, that is presumably the best confinement scenario in magnetized plasma.|$|E
5000|$|In a {{magnetized}} plasma, {{the collision}} frequency is usually {{small compared to}} the gyrofrequency, so that the step size is the gyroradius [...] and the step time is the collision time, , which {{is related to the}} collision frequency through , leading to [...] If the collision frequency is larger than the gyrofrequency, then the particles can be considered to move freely with the thermal velocity vth between collisions, and the diffusion coefficient takes the form [...] Evidently the classical (collisional) diffusion is maximum when the collision frequency is equal to the gyrofrequency, in which case D = ρ²ωc = vth²/ωc. Substituting ρ = vth/ωc, vth = (kBT/m)1/2, and ωc = eB/m, we arrive at D = kBT/eB, which is the Bohm scaling. Considering the approximate nature of this derivation, the missing 1/16 in front is no cause for concern. Therefore, at least within a factor of order unity, Bohm diffusion is always greater than <b>classical</b> <b>diffusion.</b>|$|E

40|$|For the {{rendering}} of multiple scattering effects in participating media, methods {{based on the}} diffusion approximation are an extremely efficient alternative to Monte Carlo path tracing. However, in sufficiently transparent regions, <b>classical</b> <b>diffusion</b> approximation suffers from non-physical radiative fluxes {{which leads to a}} poor match to correct light transport. In particular, this prevents the application of <b>classical</b> <b>diffusion</b> approximation to heterogeneous media, where opaque material is embedded within transparent regions. To address this limitation, we introduce flux-limited diffusion, a technique from the astrophysics domain. This method provides a better approximation to light transport than <b>classical</b> <b>diffusion</b> approximation, particularly when applied to heterogeneous media, and hence broadens the applicability of diffusion-based techniques. We provide an algorithm for flux-limited diffusion, which is validated using the transport theory for a point light source in an infinite homogeneous medium. We further demonstrate that our implementation of flux-limited diffusion produces more accurate renderings of multiple scattering in various heterogeneous datasets than <b>classical</b> <b>diffusion</b> approximation, by comparing both methods to ground truth renderings obtained via volumetric path tracing.
