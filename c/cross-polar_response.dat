50|$|The {{standard}} symmetrical, parabolic, Cassegrain reflector {{system is}} very popular in practice because it allows minimum feeder length to the terminal equipment. The major disadvantage of this configuration is blockage by the hyperbolic sub-reflector and its supporting struts (usually 3-4 are used). The blockage becomes very significant when {{the size of the}} parabolic reflector is small compared to the diameter of the sub-reflector.To avoid blockage from the sub-reflector asymmetric designs such as the open Cassegrain can be employed. Note however that the asymmetry can have deleterious effects on some aspects of the antenna's performance - for example, inferior side-lobe levels, beam squint, poor <b>cross-polar</b> <b>response,</b> etc.|$|E
40|$|A chipless RFID tag that {{exhibits}} a variable <b>cross-polar</b> <b>response</b> depending on its orientation {{with respect to}} the probing wave is investigated as a potential candidate for realizing an angular rotation sensor. The chipless sensor can be employed in harsh environments due to the absence of any silicon chip...|$|E
40|$|A chipless RFID sensor {{exploiting}} the depolarizing {{effect of a}} finite period surface is proposed for rotation monitoring. The information is encoded in the <b>cross-polar</b> <b>response</b> of the scatterer, which, in turns, depends on {{the orientation of the}} chipless RFID tag with respect to the probing wave. Preliminary assessment is illustrated and critical issues are analyzed for future developments...|$|E
40|$|The {{use of a}} low-profile, lightweight, and easy-to-fabricate transpolarizing surface {{placed on}} one side of a {{trihedral}} corner reflector (TCR) as a polarimetric calibrator is presented in this letter. The transpolarizing TCR presents a high backscattered <b>cross-polar</b> <b>response</b> contrary to standard TCRs.

40|$|Corrugated feed horns offer {{excellent}} beam symmetry, {{main beam}} efficiency, and <b>cross-polar</b> <b>response</b> over wide bandwidths, {{but can be}} challenging to fabricate. An easier-to-manufacture smooth-walled feed is explored that approximates these properties over a finite bandwidth. The design, optimization and measurement of a monotonically-profiled, smooth-walled scalar feedhorn with a diffraction-limited approx. 14 deg FWHM beam is presented. The feed was demonstrated to have low cross polarization (<- 30 dB) across the frequency range 33 - 45 GHz (30 % fractional bandwidth). A power reflection below - 28 dB was measured across the band...|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} design and {{performance}} of a non-imaging concentrator for use in broad-band polarimetry at millimeter through submillimeter wavelengths. A rectangular geometry preserves the input polarization state as the concentrator couples f/ 2 incident optics to a 2 pi sr detector. Measurements of the co-polar and cross-polar beams in both the few-mode and highly over-moded limits agree with a simple model based on mode truncation. The measured co-polar beam pattern is nearly independent of frequency in both linear polarizations. The cross-polar beam pattern is dominated by a uniform term corresponding to polarization efficiency 94 %. After correcting for efficiency, the remaining <b>cross-polar</b> <b>response</b> is - 18 dB. Comment: 9 pages including 8 figures.

40|$|Upcoming {{experiments}} aim {{to produce}} high fidelity polarization {{maps of the}} cosmic microwave background. To achieve the required sensitivity, we are developing monolithic, feedhorn-coupled transition edge sensor polarimeter arrays operating at 150 GHz. We describe this focal plane architecture and {{the current status of}} this technology, focusing on single-pixel polarimeters being deployed on the Atacama B-mode Search (ABS) and an 84 -pixel demonstration feedhorn array backed by four 10 -pixel polarimeter arrays. The feedhorn array exhibits symmetric beams, <b>cross-polar</b> <b>response</b> less than - 23 dB and excellent uniformity across the array. Monolithic polarimeter arrays, including arrays of silicon feedhorns, will be used in the Atacama Cosmology Telescope Polarimeter (ACTPol) and the South Pole Telescope Polarimeter (SPTpol) and have been proposed for upcoming balloon-borne instruments...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} {{the development of}} two circularly symmetric antennas with high polarization purity and low spill-over. Both were designed {{to be used in}} an all-sky polarization and intensity survey at 5 GHz (the C-Band All-Sky Survey, C-BASS). The survey requirements call for very low cross-polar signal levels and far-out sidelobes. Two different existing antennas, with 6. 1 -m and 7. 6 -m diameter primaries, were adapted by replacing the feed and secondary optics, resulting in identical beam performances of 0. 73 ° FWHM, cross-polarization better than - 50 dB, and far-out sidelobes below - 70 dB. The polarization purity was realized by using a symmetric low-loss dielectric foam support structure for the secondary mirror, avoiding the need for secondary support struts. Ground spill-over was largely reduced by using absorbing baffles around the primary and secondary mirrors, and by the use of a low-sidelobe profiled corrugated feedhorn. The 6. 1 -m antenna and receiver have been completed and tested. Results show that the co-polar beam matches the design simulations very closely in the main beam and down to levels of - 80 dB in the backlobes. With the absorbing baffles in place the far-out (>; 100 °) sidelobe response is reduced below - 90 dB. <b>Cross-polar</b> <b>response</b> could only be measured down to a noise floor of - 20 dB but is also consistent with the design simulations. Temperature loading and groundspill due to the secondary support were measured at less than 1 K...|$|E
