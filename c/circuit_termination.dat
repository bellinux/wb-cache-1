40|$|Complications of {{spinal cord}} injury in males include losing {{brainstem}} control of pudendal nerve–innervated perineal muscles involved in erection and ejaculation. We previously described, in adult male rats, a bulbospinal pathway originating in a discrete area within the medullary gigantocellularis (GiA/Gi), and lateral paragigantocellularis (LPGi) nuclei, which when electrically microstimulated unilaterally, produces a bilateral inhibition of pudendal motoneuron reflex circuitry after crossing to the contralateral spinal cord below T 8. Microstimulation following a long-term lateral hemisection, however, revealed reflex inhibition {{from both sides of}} the medulla, suggesting the development or unmasking of an injury-induced bulbospinal pathway crossing the midline cranial to the spinal lesion. In the present study, we investigated this pathway anatomically using the transsynaptic neuronal tracer pseudorabies virus (PRV) injected unilaterally into the bulbospongiosus muscle in uninjured controls, and ipsilateral to a chronic (1 – 2 months) unilateral lesion of the lateral funiculus. At 4. 75 days post-injection, PRV-labeled cells were found bilaterally in the GiA/Gi/LPGi with equal side-to-side labeling in uninjured controls, and with significantly greater labeling contralateral to the lesion/injection in lesioned animals. The finding of PRV-labeled neurons on both sides of the medulla after removing the mid-thoracic spinal pathway on one side provides anatomical evidence for the bilaterality in both the brainstem origin and the lumbosacral pudendal <b>circuit</b> <b>termination</b> of the spared lateral funicular bulbospinal pathway.

5000|$|A Lecher {{line is a}} pair of {{parallel}} uninsulated wires or rods held a precise distance apart. The separation is not critical but should be {{a small fraction of the}} wavelength; it ranges from less than a centimeter to over 10 cm. The length of the wires depends on the wavelength involved; lines used for measurement are generally several wavelengths long. The uniform spacing of the wires makes them a transmission line, conducting radio waves at a constant speed very close to the speed of light. One end of the rods is connected to the source of RF power, such as the output of a radio transmitter. At the other end the rods are connected together with a conductive bar between them. This short <b>circuiting</b> <b>termination</b> reflects the waves. The waves reflected from the short-circuited end interfere with the outgoing waves, creating a sinusoidal standing wave of voltage and current on the line. The voltage goes to zero at nodes located at multiples of half a wavelength from the end, with maxima called antinodes located midway between the nodes. [...] Therefore, the wavelength λ can be determined by finding the location of two successive nodes (or antinodes) and measuring the distance between them, and multiplying by two. The frequency f of the waves can be calculated from the wavelength and the speed of the waves, which is the speed of light c:The nodes are much sharper than the antinodes, because the change of voltage with distance along the line is maximum at the nodes, so they are used.|$|R
40|$|Potential {{instability}} of power amplifiers (PAs) under mismatch effects is analyzed, {{with emphasis on}} the ease and generality of application of the stability criteria. The methodology {{is based on the}} evaluation of a large-signal version of the μ factor, considering mismatch effects in the fundamental frequency and three relevant sidebands: the baseband, the lower sideband and the upper sideband. This requires an outer-tier scattering-type conversion matrix of order 3 × 3 to be obtained, with the rest of sideband equations acting as an inner tier. It is taken into account that the circuit behaves nonlinearly with respect to the termination at the fundamental frequency. The consideration of three sidebands will enable the prediction of the two major forms of large-signal instability: incommensurable oscillations and frequency divisions by two. The analysis is preceded by an evaluation of the circuit own stability properties (proviso) under open and short <b>circuit</b> <b>terminations</b> at the sidebands, for all possible values of the termination at the fundamental frequency. Three different μ factors can be defined between any two ports of the scattering matrix. The analysis of the relationships between these factors and their continuity properties will allow the derivation of a single number able to characterize the PA potential instability for each fundamental-frequency termination. Results have been exhaustively validated with independent circuit-level simulations based on pole-zero identification and with measurements, using a variable output load and loading the PA with an antenna.

50|$|In both {{ring and}} radial circuits, the circuit wiring starts at a {{consumer}} unit or distribution board, traverses in turn {{a number of}} sockets or devices (point-to-point style), before terminating. The difference is that a radial circuit simply ends upon reaching the last connected device, while in a ring <b>circuit</b> the <b>termination</b> is made by rejoining {{the end of the}} circuit from the last device back to its starting point. A ring circuit therefore forms a continuous ring. This means that there are two independent paths from the supply to every device. Ideally, the ring acts like two radial circuits proceeding in opposite directions around the ring, the dividing point between them dependent on the distribution of load in the ring. If the load is evenly split across the two directions, the current in each direction is half of the total, allowing the use of wire with half the current-carrying capacity. (Because heating effects are proportional to the square of the current, this means the cable theoretically only needs to be quarter of the usual cross section area, for the same current carrying capacity). In practice, the load does not always split evenly, so thicker wire is used.|$|R

40|$|Data {{transmission}} on high-speed channels may {{be affected}} by several undesired effects, including coupling from nearby interconnects, dispersion, losses, signal reflections from terminations and from internal discontinuities, and nonlinear/dynamic effects of drivers and receivers. The latter are often neglected, leading to very fast solvers, whose results may however be questionable when driver/receiver nonlinearities are important. This paper presents a framework for the transient analysis of complex high-speed channels with arbitrary nonlinear <b>termination</b> <b>circuits.</b> The approach is based on decoupling channel and terminations through a scattering-based Waveform Relaxation (WR) formulation. The channels are here cast as delay-rational macromodels, which are solved in discrete time domain through fast delayed recursive convolutions.

In order to overcome the known convergence issues of standard WR methods, we apply here more general iterative solution schemes, such as GMRES and BiCGSTAB, integrated into inexact Newton iterations, obtaining a set of numerical schemes with guaranteed convergence.

Partial wraparound SMD resistors in a 0402  size have low parasitics making them applicable up to K-band.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Myotonic {{dystrophy}} type 1 (DM 1) is {{a common}} adulthood muscular dystrophy, characterized by muscle wasting, myotonia, and multisystemic manifestations. The phenomenon of involuntary muscle contraction during myotonia offers a unique possibility of investigating brain motor functions. This study explores cortical involvement during grip myotonia in DM 1. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixteen DM 1 patients {{were enrolled in the}} study. Eight patients had apparent grip myotonia, while eight patients did not (control subjects). All patients underwent functional MRI grip task examination twice: prior a warm-up procedure (myotonia was elicited in patients with apparent grip myotonia) and after a warm-up procedure (myotonia was attenuated in patients with apparent grip myotonia). No myotonia was elicited during either examination in patients without apparent grip myotonia. Cerebral blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals were compared both between groups with and without apparent myotonia, and between pre- and post-warm-up sessions. RESULTS: Significantly higher BOLD signal was found during myotonia phase in patients with apparent grip myotonia compared to corresponding non-myotonia phase of patients without apparent grip myotonia in the supplementary motor area and in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. Significant differences in BOLD signal levels of very similar pattern were detected between prewarm-up session myotonia phase and post-warm-up session myotonia absent phase in the group of patients with apparent grip myotonia.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. We {{sought to}} {{demonstrate}} {{mechanisms by which}} rapid pacing can cause conduction block without terminating reentry. Background. Rapid pacing can fail to terminate or can accelerate tachycardias in patients. Mechanisms for these responses are poorly understood. Methods. We studied reentry in the canine atrial tricuspid ring and a left ventricular ring in vitro in 12 preparations. Activations were recorded from 10 sites around the ring, and monophasic action potentials were recorded from critical sites of block. Rapid pacing at cycle lengths that intermittently caused conduction block was performed at multiple sites. Results. Action potential alternans contributed to block of an orthodromic impulse during rapid pacing. When pacing continued for two stimuli after orthodromic block, a second episode of block could reverse the direction of tachycardia. Continued pacing at this site was likely to produce block of an antidromic impulse, which may initiate double-wave reentry. Double-wave reentry could be sustained or nonsustained. Its cycle length was 56 % to 77 % of the single-wave cycle length. The ratio of double-wave cycle length to single-wave cycle length was inversely correlated with the relative excitable gap (p < 0. 01). Double-wave reentry can be a mechanism for persistent cycle length alteration during tachycardia. Conclusions. Successful termination of reentry by rapid pacing required block of an orthodromic impulse and stopping pacing within one stimulus after orthodromic block. Reversal of reentry makes the <b>circuit</b> resistant to <b>termination</b> from this site of pacing. Antidromic block can cause acceleration due to double-wave re...|$|R
40|$|Accelerated {{vascular}} calcification {{and increased}} risk of calciphylaxis can be a reason to restrict the use of vitamin K antagonists in dialysis patients. We describe the use of fondaparinux, a prototype indirect factor Xa inhibitor, as an alternative anticoagulant to coumarin derivatives in dialysis patients. In this case series, we included six chronic haemodialysis patients treated with vitamin K antagonists. Low-molecular-weight heparin given as anticoagulant during dialysis was replaced by fondaparinux. Anti-Xa activity was regularly measured pre- and postdialysis to adapt the dose of fondaparinux. Adequate continuous anticoagulation and circuit patency were registered by evaluating clotting in the bubble trap and dialyser membrane {{at the end of}} dialysis. Anticoagulation with fondaparinux at a starting dose of 2. 5 mg resulted in an effective anticoagulation in the majority of dialysis sessions. Although median predialysis anti-Xa levels were significantly lower [0. 36 IU/mL (0. 300. 42 IU/mL) (P 0. 0001) ] than postdialysis levels [0. 75 IU/mL (0. 650. 80 IU/mL) ], predialysis anti-Xa levels were sufficient to limit the risk of thromboembolism. After an initial period of gradually increasing anti-Xa levels due to accumulation of fondaparinux, stable levels were achieved. Haemodialysis without clotting problems was possible in 96 of the sessions (clotting score 1), whereas two episodes (2 / 459 dialysis sessions) of major clotting were observed, defined as clotting of the extracorporeal <b>circuit</b> necessitating premature <b>termination</b> of the procedure.

40|$|Recently, {{there have}} been a great {{interest}} in the millimeter-wave (mmW) and terahertz (THz) bands due to the unique features they provide for various applications. For example, the mmW is not significantly affected by the atmospheric constraints and it can penetrate through clothing and other dielectric materials. Therefore, it is suitable for a vast range of imaging applications such as vision, safety, health, environmental studies, security and non-destructive testing. Millimeter-wave imaging systems have been conventionally used for high end applications implementing sophisticated and expensive technologies. Recent advancements in the silicon integrated and low loss material passive technologies have created a great opportunity to study the feasibility of low cost mmW imaging systems. However, there are several challenges to be addressed first. Examples are modeling of active and passive devices and their low performance, highly attenuated channel and poor signal to noise ratio in the mmW. The main objective of this thesis is to investigate and develop new technologies enabling cost-effective implementation of mmW and sub-mmW imaging systems. To achieve this goal, an integrated active Rotman lens architecture is proposed as an ultimate solution to combine the unique properties of a Rotman lens with the superiority of CMOS technology for fabrication of cost effective integrated mmW systems. However, due to the limited sensitivity of on-chip detectors in the mmW, a large number of high gain, wide-band and miniaturized mmW Low Noise Amplifiers (LNA) are required to implement the proposed integrated Rotman lens architecture. A unique solution presented in this thesis is the novel Band Pass Distributed Amplifier (BPDA) topology. In this new topology, by short <b>circuiting</b> the line <b>terminations</b> in a Conventional Distributed Amplifier (CDA), standing waves are created in its artificial transmission lines. Conventionally, standing waves are strongly avoided by carefully matching these lines to 50 Ω in order to prevent instability of the amplifier. This causes that {{a large portion of the}} signal be absorbed in these resistive terminations. In this thesis, it is shown that due to presence of highly lossy parasitics of CMOS transistor at the mmW the amplifier stability is inherently achieved. Moreover, by eliminating these lossy and noise terminations in the CDA, the amplifier gain is boosted and its noise figure is reduced. In addition, a considerable decrease in the number of elements enables low power realization of many amplifiers in a small chip area. Using the lumped element model of the transistor, the transfer function of a single stage BPDAs is derived and compared to its conventional counter part. A methodology to design a single stage BPDA to achieve all the design goals is presented. Using the presented design guidelines, amplifiers for different mmW frequencies have been designed, fabricated and tested. Using only 4 transistors, a 60 GHz amplifier is fabricated on a very small chip area of 0. 105 mm 2 by a low-cost 130 nm CMOS technology. A peak gain of 14. 7 dB and a noise figure of 6 dB are measured for this fabricated amplifier. oreover, it is shown that by further circuit optimization, high gain amplification can be realized at frequencies above the cut-off frequency of the transistor. Simulations show 32 and 28 dB gain can be obtained by implementing only 6 transistors using this CMOS technology at 60 and 77 GHz. A 4 -stage 85 GHz amplifier is also designed and fabricated and a measured gain of 10 dB at 82 GHz is achieved with a 3 dB bandwidth of 11 GHz from 80 to 91 GHz. A good agreement between the simulated and measured results verifies the accuracy of the design procedure. In addition, a multi-stage wide-band BPDA has been designed to show the ability of the proposed topology for design of wide band mmW amplifiers using the CMOS technology. Simulated gain of 20. 5 dB with a considerable 3 dB bandwidth of 38 GHz from 30 to 68 GHz is achieved while the noise figure is less than 6 dB in the whole bandwidth. An amplifier figure of merit is defined in terms of gain, noise figure, chip area, band width and power consumption. The results are compared to those of the state of the art to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed circuit topology and presented design techniques. Finally, a Rotman lens is designed and optimized by choosing a very small Focal Lens Ratio (FL), and a high measured efficiency of greater than 30 % is achieved while the lens dimensions are less than 6 mm. The lens is designed and implemented using a low cost Alumina substrate and conventional microstrip lines to ease its integration with the active parts of the system. 1 yea...|$|R
