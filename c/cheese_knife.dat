[...] "It puts me in mind of a fog I onct struck off the coast o' Lower Californy. We was in it fer four days an' it was so thick ye could cut it with a <b>cheese</b> <b>knife.</b> Why, sir, one day it got so thick the sailors went to the bow an' caught it in their hands, jess like that!" [...] He made a grab at the air. [...] "The captain had his little {{daughter}} aboard an' the gal went out on deck an' got lost an' we had to feel around in that fog nearly an hour afore we found her, an' then, sure as I'm a standin' here, she was next to drowned an' had to be treated jess like she had been under water." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{blades of}} <b>cheese</b> <b>knives</b> are usually {{made of a}} {{material}} such as stainless steel, which is resistant to the stickiness of cheese. Another design feature often found {{is the presence of}} holes in the blade to help to prevent the cheese from sticking to it. Some soft <b>cheese</b> <b>knives</b> also include a ridge, which runs vertically {{near the top of the}} blade. This helps separate the cheese as it is being sliced. Some <b>cheese</b> <b>knives</b> have a forked end and is used for serving slices of cheese.|$|R
50|$|Soft <b>cheese</b> <b>knives</b> are {{specially}} designed for slicing soft cheese. They generally have {{holes in the}} blade to prevent the cheese from sticking. Wire cheese cutters are also used.|$|R
5000|$|Cheese is {{varied and}} often {{challenging}} to cut. Accordingly, various styles of <b>cheese</b> <b>knives</b> and [...] have been developed. A wire, {{rather than a}} knife, {{is often used to}} cut cheese.|$|R

50|$|Soft cheeses {{require a}} sharp knife. As these cheeses are often sticky, a <b>cheese</b> <b>knife</b> will be {{serrated}} and often have holes to prevent sticking.|$|E
50|$|Hard <b>cheese</b> <b>knives</b> are {{specially}} designed for slicing hard cheese. They are sharp, {{so they can}} cut exact slices, and often have a forked tip, allowing them {{to be used as}} a serving utensil as well. Cheese slicers are also used.|$|R
50|$|Soft <b>cheese</b> <b>knives</b> are {{designed}} {{to deal with the}} stickiness of soft cheese. When the cheese does not stick to the blade, it allows for pieces of cheese to be presented more attractively, with crisper shapes compared to cheese cut with standard knives.|$|R
50|$|In 2008 {{an entry}} level brand Arthur Price Kitchen (APK) was launched, the range {{included}} 30 piece cutlery sets that included an additional 6 teaspoons {{based on research}} that these items {{have a tendency to}} go missing. As well as cutlery sets APK also features accessories such as <b>cheese</b> <b>knives</b> and a collection of ceramic pieces.|$|R
50|$|The non-sticky {{characteristics}} of a <b>cheese</b> <b>knife</b> also makes them useful for cutting other sticky foods, such as cakes, eggs, and pies; compare also egg slicer.|$|E
50|$|Hard cheeses instead {{require a}} tough blade, {{which will not}} be damaged by the hard cheese. Exemplary is the {{distinctive}} Parmesan <b>cheese</b> <b>knife,</b> which is short, thick, and stubby, like an oyster knife.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>cheese</b> <b>knife</b> {{is a type}} {{of kitchen}} knife {{specialized}} for the cutting of cheese. Different cheeses require different knives, according primarily to hardness; most often [...] "cheese knife" [...] refers to a knife designed for soft cheese.|$|E
5000|$|Parmesan <b>cheese</b> <b>knives</b> are {{specially}} designed for portioning very hard cheeses. They have very short, thick blades that are {{forced into the}} cheese and then used as a lever to break off smaller portions. (Slicing hard cheese is considered improper by connoisseurs, since the cheese - when broken apart - has more surface area, and thus more air contact, which strengthens the apparent scent and taste of the cheese.) ...|$|R
50|$|The {{traditional}} {{range of}} production of the company is constituted by professional knives and other food preparation tools. It includes 0.4 to 3.5-kg cleavers, knives for butchering, knives and spatulas for kitchens and bakeries, <b>cheese</b> <b>knives,</b> carving forks and bonding knives. The company has implemented various innovations as it relates with food safety and hygiene in the recent years, such as switching the production of wood handles to PP (polypropylene) or POM (polyoxymethylene). The blades are made using molybdenum/vanadium stainless steel which has a high carbon content.|$|R
50|$|Double boiler, cheese-cloth or strainer, <b>knife,</b> <b>cheese</b> {{press or}} slotted {{container}} with weights. Almost all cheesemaking tools can be improvised.|$|R
50|$|Furthermore, {{the shape}} is unusual. Most knives have a blade that is wide {{at the base}} and tapers to the tip. A <b>cheese</b> <b>knife,</b> on the other hand, {{is similar to a}} cleaver in that it starts out thinner at the handle and then gets wider away from the base. Some cheese knives have angled handles to make an easier cut.|$|E
50|$|When more {{courses are}} being served, place {{settings}} {{may become more}} elaborate and cutlery more specialised. Examples include fruit spoon or fruit knife, <b>cheese</b> <b>knife,</b> and pastry fork. Other types of cutlery, such as boning forks, were used when formal meals included dishes that have since become less common. Carving knives and forks are used to carve roasts at the table.|$|E
5000|$|Cheese cutters are {{designed}} to cut soft, sticky cheeses (moist and oily), and accordingly {{does not have a}} large sharp-edged blade; compare to a <b>cheese</b> <b>knife</b> with holes in the blade. The cutting edge of cheese cutters are typically a fine gauge stainless steel or aluminium wire (a [...] "cheesewire") stretched across a supporting frame. The thin wire cuts through a cheese block with hand pressure.|$|E
50|$|The shop selling local {{products}} {{offers a}} variety of local products. It was founded by thirty farmers, craftsmen and artists of the lower valley of the Verdon. They display their products: olive oil, jams, honey, biscuits, pâtés, wines, goat <b>cheese,</b> jewelry, <b>knives,</b> clothing, leather goods, stoneware, faïence, glazed pastries, Figurines, lavender oil, etc.|$|R

At this point he became aware that he was monopolising the conversation, and turned to George, just as the latter was taking a piece of <b>cheese</b> from his <b>knife</b> with his teeth, asking: ...|$|R
50|$|A loaf {{of bread}} on a napkin, a glass of wine, {{and a piece of}} <b>cheese</b> with a <b>knife</b> stuck into it give Velázquez the {{opportunity}} to study the different textures. An interesting feature of The Three Musicians is the variety of issues raised, such as whether it is a genre representation or whether behind the supposedly everyday scene there are hidden layers of meaning, which can make the picture readable as an allegory, giving it a different interpretation.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{incident}} {{took place}} with Felix Larkin, the financial backer of the [...] "Irish Giant" [...] Ned Baldwin, when he accused Hill and William E. Harding of {{causing him to}} lose a horse race. He and several thugs entered at Hill's resort {{with the intention of}} killing Harding. The two men did draw their pistols, however no gunfight took place. Both Harding and Larkin were arrested but later discharged. Soon after leaving the precinct, Larkin and his party attacked another saloonkeeper who stabbed him to death with a <b>cheese</b> <b>knife.</b>|$|E
50|$|While {{visiting his}} {{grandmother}} Martha (Geraldine Fitzgerald), Arthur shares his feelings for Linda, but is warned {{again that he}} will be disowned if he does not marry Susan. Hobson, who has been more like a father to him than Arthur's real father, realizes that Arthur is beginning to grow up and secretly encourages Linda to attend Arthur's engagement party. Hobson confides in Linda that he senses Arthur loves her. Linda crashes the party, held at the estate of Arthur's father, and she and Arthur eventually spend time alone together - which was noticed by both families. Hobson is later hospitalized and Arthur rushes to his side, vowing to care for the person who has long cared for him. After several weeks, Hobson dies and then Arthur, who has been sober the entire time, goes on a drinking binge. On his wedding day, he visits the diner where Linda works at and then proposes to her. At the church, he jilts Susan, resulting in her abusive father, Burt Johnson (Stephen Elliott), attempting to stab Arthur with a <b>cheese</b> <b>knife,</b> though he is prevented by Martha.|$|E
50|$|The {{officers}} have been quartered in the chateau for several weeks, and as they are {{far away from the}} fighting and do not want to go out due to the endless rain, the officers are desperately bored. They have been spending their days drinking, gambling, and destroying the chateau's paintings, furniture and other fine objects. After a boring lunch, the aristocratic captain suggest a dinner party, and sends an army transport wagon to the local town to bring back some prostitutes to keep the officers company. In the evening, the party begins, and soon the officers and prostitutes are drunk and in high spirits. The officer known as Fifi, who has taken a Jewish prostitute called Rachel, starts smashing things and making violent sexual advances on Rachel. The party-goers start telling dirty jokes in bad French and the officers make a variety of slurred speeches praising German military prowess, which makes Rachel increasingly angry. When Fifi makes a speech proclaiming that France is crushed and that all of France, including all French women, are now Prussian property, Rachel rebukes him. At this Fifi slaps Rachel, who becomes enraged and stabs Fifi with a <b>cheese</b> <b>knife</b> and jumps out the window. Fifi soon dies, and the major orders a search for Rachel but she is never found. The German officers become curious that the next day, the church bell in the village, which has been silent as a sign of national mourning, is suddenly ringing again. It continues to ring until the day the armistice is signed, when the German officers finally leave the chateau. At the end of the story, it is revealed that Rachel herself has been hiding in the bell tower, ringing the bell as a sign of her personal triumph over the Germans.|$|E
25|$|Serving {{pieces were}} often elaborately {{decorated}} and pierced and embellished with ivory, and could include {{any or all}} of the following: carving knife and fork, salad knife and fork, cold meat fork, punch ladle, soup ladle, gravy ladle, casserole-serving spoon, berry spoon, lasagna server, macaroni server, asparagus server, cucumber server, tomato server, olive spoon, <b>cheese</b> scoop, fish <b>knife</b> and fork, pastry server, petit four server, cake knife, bon bon spoon, salt spoon, sugar sifter or caster and crumb remover with brush.|$|R
50|$|Linby was {{the scene}} of a murder in its early days. One of the storekeepers at Linby accused the barber of {{stealing}} kerosene from his store. The barber became angry at this accusation. He armed himself with a gun and went to the store to confront the storekeeper. The storekeeper was cutting a <b>cheese</b> with a <b>knife</b> and the storekeeper and the barber approached each other. The barber fired his gun injuring the storekeeper. The storekeeper stabbed the barber with the knife he had been using to cut the cheese. The barber died almost immediately. The storekeeper recovered from his wounds and was acquitted on the grounds of self-defense.|$|R
40|$|The current {{research}} effort consisted on design, building {{and testing of}} a customized apparatus – a closed cylindrical, double-jacketed cheese vat, with a 50 L-capacity, aimed at manufacturing Serra da Estrela cheese (or similar ewe’s milk <b>cheeses),</b> provided with <b>knives</b> that play a double role – stirring and cutting, a combined device for draining and pre-moulding, and a cleaning-in-place system. This novel apparatus {{makes it possible to}} semi-automate cheesemaking in small scale – including a continuous cycle of hands-free sequential coagulation, cutting, syneresis and moulding of cheeses. It was successfully applied to ewe’s milk cheese manufacture, and was able to reduce duration of the overall cycle – with concomitant standardization of the process, and a significant (P> 0. 05) increase in cheese yield and fat recovery...|$|R
30|$|We {{are also}} {{working in a}} novel {{approach}} to address the challenge of automatic extraction of relations described within NCs and ANs using Open IE paradigm [36]. Etzione et al. [7] indicate that learning relationships that are not expressed by verbs is a key gap in current Open IE state-of-the-art methods. Since verbs {{are not the only}} way to express relations between nouns in a text, it is important to create alternatives to learn those relations. For example, the noun compounds <b>cheese</b> <b>knife</b> and kitchen knife inform the relations (knife, for cutting, cheese) and (knife, used in, kitchen), respectively. Until this point, we are not aware of any other work beyond ours that perform this task.|$|E
