30|$|From the <b>convergence</b> <b>diagram</b> of ILWCA algorithm, we {{can know}} that {{as the number of}} {{iterations}} increases, the value of functions presents monotonically increasing trend and approaches the global optimal solution. In order to further observe the convergence behaviour of the algorithm, we also drew the search history track of the first search agent in the first search dimension. From the first dimension of the first dimension of the above seven functions, we can learn that the trend of the first dimension of the first dimension of the wolf is very large in the early period of the search, but the search trajectory tends to be stable in the later period of the iteration. This behaviour guarantees that a SI algorithm will eventually converge to the point in search space. This gives a good indication of the stability of the ILWCA algorithm. For Fig.  8 F 12, to the later stage, the change trend graph is also unstable, because the function is a process overlap, and the point of the function image is stereoscopic {{in the vicinity of the}} global best advantage. The optimal prey searched by ILWCA algorithm is generally better than other algorithms.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Robust and {{efficient}} solution techniques are developed for high-dimensional parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs). Presented is a solver {{based on the}} Krylov subspace method Bi-CGSTAB preconditioned with d-multigrid. Developing the perfect multigrid method, as a stand-alone solver for a single problem discretized on a particular grid, often {{requires a lot of}} optimal tuning and expert insight; on the other hand Krylov-subspace based methods are robust but much less efficient unless used in combination with a very suitable preconditioner. The preconditioner that we employ is d-multigrid. We aim for a robust combination of the two so that it results in a solver that converges well for a wide class of discrete problems arising from discretization on various anisotropic grids. This is exactly what we encounter during the sparse grid solution of a high-dimensional problem. Different multigrid components are discussed and presented with operator construction formulae (in abstract d dimensions). We also present <b>convergence</b> <b>diagrams</b> for various multigrid (solvers and preconditioners) that we develop in this work, and explain their applicability...|$|R

40|$|An exact {{closed form}} {{solution}} is derived for the mechanical behaviour of a linear viscoelastic Burgers rock around an axisymmetric tunnel, {{supported by a}} linear elastic ring. Analytical formulae are provided for the displacement of the rock/lining interface and for the pressure exerted by the rock on the lining, {{taking into account the}} stiffness and its installation time. Results calculated from these formulae do validate the corresponding numerical results of a 2 D finite differences code. Further, comparison to previous existing solutions for the same viscoelastic model indicates similarities and differences. Aparametric study is performed to investigate the effect of the viscoelastic constants, the stiffness and installation time of the support. The derived closed form solution is used to construct the time-dependent Supported Ground Reaction Curves of the viscoelastic rock, i. e. the time contour plots on the <b>convergence</b> confinement <b>diagram.</b> The importance of the effect of the support on the restrained rock creep and the exerted pressure on the lining, during the design life of a structure, is examined. © Springer-Verlag 2011...|$|R

In the spatially inhomogeneous case, we derive the macroscopic models associated to the stable equilibria and classify their hyperbolicity according to the same function. 1...|$|R
40|$|This article reviews {{some recent}} {{work on a}} version of the {{standard}} model (the Lee-Wick standard model) that contains higher derivative kinetic terms that improve the <b>convergence</b> of loop <b>diagrams</b> removing the quadratic divergence in the Higgs boson mass. Naively higher derivative theories of this type are not acceptable since the higher derivative terms either cause instabilities (from negative energies) or a loss of unitarity (from negative norm states). Lee and Wick provided an interpretation for such theories arguing that theories with higher derivative kinetic terms can be unitary and stable if the states associated with the massive propagator poles, that arise from the higher derivatives, have widths and hence decay and are not in the spectrum of the theory.

40|$|We {{construct}} a simple physical {{model of a}} particle moving on the infinite noncommutative 2 -plane. The model consists {{of a pair of}} opposite charges moving in a strong magnetic field. In addition, the charges are connected by a spring. In the limit of large magnetic field, the charges are frozen into the lowest Landau level. Interaction of such particles include Moyal bracket phases characteristics of field theory on noncommutative space. The simple system arises in lightcone quantization of open strings attached to D-branes in a. s. tensor background. We use the model to work out the general form of lightcone vertices from string splitting. We then consider Feynman diagrams in uncompactified NC YM theories and find that for all planar diagrams the comm. and noncomm. theories are the same. This means large N theories are equivalent in the 't Hooft limit. Non planar <b>diagrams</b> <b>convergence</b> is improved.

40|$|The {{results of}} the {{mathematical}} theory of asymptotic operation developed in [1] are applied to problems of immediate physical interest. First, the problem of UV renormalization is analyzed {{from the viewpoint of}} asymptotic behaviour of integrands in momentum representation. A new prescription for UV renormalization in momentum space representation is presented (generalized minimal subtraction scheme); it ensures UV <b>convergence</b> of renormalized <b>diagrams</b> by construction, makes no use of special (e. g. dimensional) regularizations, and comprizes massless renormalization schemes (including the MS scheme). Then we present formal regularization-independent proofs of general formulae for Euclidean asymptotic expansions of renormalized Feynman diagrams (inlcuding short-distance OPE, heavy mass expansions and mixed asymptotic regimes etc.) derived earlier in the context of dimensional regularization [9], [10], [11]. This result, together with the new variant of UV renormalization, demonstrates the power of the new techniques based on a systematic use of the theory of distributions and establishes the method of As-operation as a comprehensive full-fledged—and inherently more powerful—alternative to the BPHZ approach. 1 INTRODUCTION 2 1...|$|R
40|$|Shape skeletons are {{powerful}} geometric abstractions that provide useful intermediate representations {{for a number}} of geometric operations on solid models includingfeature recognition, shape decomposition, finite element mesh generation, and shape design. As a result there has been significant interest in the development of effectivemethods for skeleton generation of general free-form solids. In this paper we describe a method that combines Delaunay triangulation with local numerical optimizationschemes for the generation of accurate skeletons of 3 D implicit solid models. The proposed method accelerates the slow <b>convergence</b> of Voronoi <b>diagrams</b> to theskeleton, which, without optimization, would require impractically large sample point sets and resulting messhes to attain acceptable accuracy. The Delaunaytriangulation forms the basis for generating the topological structure of the skeleton. The optimization step of the process generates the geometry of the skeleton patchesby moving the vertices of Delaunay tetrahedra and relocating their centres to form maximally inscribed spheres. The computational advantage of the optimization schemeis that it involves the solution of one small optimization problem per tetrahedron and its complexity is therefore only linear (O(n)) in the number of points used for theskeleton approximation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method on a number of representative solid models...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{simulation results}} for a sliding-IF SiGe E-band transmitter circuit for the 81 - 86 GHz E-band. The circuit was designed in a SiGe process with fT = 200 GHz {{and uses a}} supply of 1. 5 V. The low supply voltage {{eliminates the need for}} a dedicated transmitter voltage regulator. The carrier generation is based on a 28 GHz quadrature voltage oscillator (QVCO). Upconversion to 84 GHz is performed by first mixing with the QVCO signals, converting the signal from baseband to 28 GHz, and then mixing it with the 56 GHz QVCO second harmonic, present at the emitter nodes of the QVCO core devices. The second mixer is connected to a three-stage power amplifier utilizing capacitive cross-coupling to increase the gain, providing a saturated output power of + 14 dBm with a 1 dB output compression point of + 11 dBm. E-band radio links using higher order modulation, e. g. 64 QAM, are sensitive to I/Q phase errors. The presented design is based on a 28 GHz QVCO, the lower frequency reducing the phase error due to mismatch in active and passive devices. The I/Q mismatch can be further reduced by adjusting varactors connected to each QVCO output. The analog performance of the transmitter is based on ADS Momentum models of all inductors and transformers, and layout parasitic extracted views of the active parts. For the simulations with a 16 QAM modulated baseband input signal, however, the Momentum models were replaced with lumped equivalent models to ease simulator <b>convergence.</b> Constellation <b>diagrams</b> and error vector magnitude (EVM) were calculated in MATLAB using data from transient simulations. The EVM dependency on QVCO phase noise, I/Q imbalance and PA compression has been analyzed. For an average output power of 7. 5 dBm, the design achieves 7. 2 % EVM for a 16 QAM signal with 1 GHz bandwidth. The current consumption of the transmitter, including the PA, equals 131 mA from a 1. 5 V supply...|$|R

However, the systems faced a lot of challenges such as delay in the propagation of signals due to time-varying channel and effect of high speed transmission over Rayleigh fading which result into Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI) distortion. Least Mean Square (LMS) and Normalized Least Mean Square (NLMS) have been previously used to adapt the system using the step size, and Eigen value. In this paper, the adaptive Algorithms over a time-varying channel were compared using convergence level, Bit Error Rate (BER), and Mean Square Error (MSE). The system model consists of bits to symbol converter, 16 -QAM modulator and Raised Cosine transmit filter, all at the transmitter, time-varying Rayleigh fading with Additive White Gaussian Noise added, and at the receiver are Raised Cosine Receive filter, 16 -QAM demodulator, then each of the Adaptive LMS and NLMS filters which received delay from the Random integer generator, and the integer/symbol to bit converter at the output.
