25|$|The first desktop {{programmable}} calculators {{were produced}} in the mid-1960s by Mathatronics and Casio (AL-1000). These machines were very heavy and costly. The first programmable pocket calculator was the HP-65, in 1974; it had a capacity of 100 instructions, and could store and retrieve programs with a built-in magnetic card reader. Two years later the HP-25C introduced continuous memory, i.e., programs and data were retained in CMOS memory during power-off. In 1979, HP released the first alphanumeric, programmable, expandable calculator, the HP-41C. It could be expanded with random access memory (RAM, for memory) and read-only memory (ROM, for software) modules, and peripherals like bar code readers, microcassette and floppy disk drives, paper-roll thermal printers, and miscellaneous <b>communication</b> <b>interfaces</b> (RS-232, HP-IL, HP-IB).|$|E
2500|$|The {{deployment}} of ATS-A involved upgrading signals to be compatible for future CBTC retrofitting, {{as well as}} consolidating operations from 23 different master towers into the Power Control Center. Parsons Corporation helped the MTA install the system on the [...] of A Division track, as well as did some preliminary planning for ATS on the B Division. The project, valued at $450 million, cost $200 million. The project's completion was delayed by five years, and it ultimately took 14 years to implement ATS-A. The long duration of ATS-A's deployment was attributed to bad communication between workers and contractors; because of {{the uniqueness of the}} New York City Subway's interlocking equipment, which necessitated extra workarounds; because of the MTA's use of its own workers rather than of contractors' workers; because of the poor training that contractors had; and because of bad <b>communication</b> <b>interfaces.</b> In addition, the MTA kept missing deadlines for testing ATS. The single biggest issue during the project, however, was that MTA and the contractors did not cooperate well.|$|E
