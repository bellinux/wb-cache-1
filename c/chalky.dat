5|$|In 1989, a Kakapo Recovery {{programme}} {{was developed}} and a Kakapo Recovery Group established to implement it. The New Zealand Department of Conservation replaced the Wildlife Service for this task. The first action of {{the plan was to}} relocate all the remaining kakapo to suitable islands for them to breed. None of the New Zealand islands were ideal to establish kakapo without rehabilitation by extensive re-vegetation and the eradication of introduced mammalian predators and competitors. Four islands were finally chosen: Maud, Hauturu/Little Barrier, Codfish and Mana. Sixty-five kakapo (43 males, 22 females) were successfully transferred onto the four islands in five translocations. Some islands had to be rehabilitated several times when feral cats, stoats and weka kept appearing. Little Barrier Island was eventually viewed as unsuitable due to the rugged landscape, the thick forest and the continued presence of rats, and its birds were evacuated in 1998. Along with Mana Island, it was replaced with two new kakapo sanctuaries, <b>Chalky</b> Island (Te Kakahu) and Anchor Island. The entire kakapo population of Codfish Island was temporarily relocated in 1999 to Pearl Island in Port Pegasus while rats were being eliminated from Codfish. All kakapo on Pearl and <b>Chalky</b> Islands were moved to Anchor Island in 2005.|$|E

5|$|Sufficient habitat {{complexity}} is {{a crucial}} requirement {{for the presence of}} this species, in order to support its various behaviours-basking, foraging, and hibernation—as well as to offer some protection from predators and human harassment. It is found in a variety of habitats, including: <b>chalky</b> downs, rocky hillsides, moors, sandy heaths, meadows, rough commons, edges of woods, sunny glades and clearings, bushy slopes and hedgerows, dumps, coastal dunes, and stone quarries. It will venture into wetlands if dry ground is available nearby and thus may be found on the banks of streams, lakes, and ponds.|$|E
5|$|Suillus bovinus {{is found}} in conifer woods and {{plantations}} across Europe, including subalpine regions in the Alps, up to altitudes of 800m (2500ft). It is common in Lithuania, where it associates with Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), the only naturally occurring pine in that country. Preferred soils of S.bovinus are often acidic, sand-based, or sometimes calcareous (<b>chalky)</b> and moraine. In Asia, it has been recorded in Taiwan, and in Japan, where it associates with Japanese red pine (Pinus densiflora). In China, it has been recorded from provinces Anhui, Fujian, Guangdong, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang.|$|E
5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} E.sinuatum grow solitarily or in groups, {{and have been}} found forming fairy rings. Fruit bodies appear mainly in autumn, and also in summer in North America, while in Europe the season is {{reported}} as late summer and autumn. They are found in deciduous woodlands under oak, beech, and less commonly birch, often on clay or calcareous (<b>chalky)</b> soils, but they may spread to in parks, fields and grassy areas nearby. Most members of the genus are saprotrophic, although this species has been recorded as forming an ectomycorrhizal relationship with willow (Salix).|$|E
50|$|Just {{before the}} Paleogene, which {{included}} the mass-extinction event of the non-avian dinosaurs, sea levels dropped, exposing Sussex and Kent, and the marine Upnor Beds were deposited in Surrey. In the Paleogene, Southern England rose slightly, and the seas retreated, and the reddish and mottled clays of the Reading Beds were deposited by a large river sand delta system. Later, a rise in sea level, around 50 million years ago, caused widespread deposition, until 2 million years ago, of the London Clay across the County. The London Clay is a bluish-grey marine clay with isolated pockets of fossils especially where <b>chalkier.</b> The youngest part of the London Clay {{is known as the}} Claygate Beds and occurs widely in Surrey. This even sandier material represents a transition between the deeper water London Clay and the succeeding shallower water, possibly estuarine, Bagshot Sand.|$|R

The scene between Ganesan and Parthiban was later featured in the 2016 film Jackson Durai, which was titled after Parthiban's character. M. Sasikumar's Balle Vellaiyathevaa, released in the same year, was named after a dialogue uttered by Ganesan's character.|$|R
5|$|It also tolerates {{a variety}} of soil conditions. Although young {{specimens}} perform best when planted {{in a mixture of}} peat and either sand or perlite, P.atriplicifolia can thrive in sandy, <b>chalky,</b> or loamy soil, or heavy clay soil with sufficient drainage. It can endure a wide range of soil pH, as well as exposure to salty conditions near oceans. Its deep-feeding taproot makes it especially drought tolerant; for this reason it has seen wide use for xeriscaping in the Intermountain West. Overwatering and over-fertilization can damage its roots and lead to a rapid decline in health. P.atriplicifolia is otherwise generally free from plant pathogens. In cultivation, it is also rarely selected as forage by grazing animals, and so is considered both a deer-resistant and rabbit-resistant plant.|$|E
5|$|Also {{found on}} {{calcareous}} (<b>chalky)</b> soils, Rubroboletus satanas is larger {{and has a}} pale cap, and its upper stem lacks the reticulations characteristic of S.luridus. Its flesh does not turn blue so markedly on bruising or cutting. It has a more globular overall shape, and young mushrooms carry a smell of decay. The edible Neoboletus luridiformis can be distinguished from S.luridus by its dark brown cap; it also grows on sandy soils associated with conifers. In North America, it can {{be confused with the}} poisonous Rubroboletus pulcherrimus, which has a fatter stalk and deeper red pores. Initially collected in Michigan under oak, Boletus vinaceobasis resembles S.luridus but has shorter spores and its cystidia are dark brown in Melzer's reagent. Boletus species that share a similar appearance with S.luridus but lack reticulation in their stems include B.subvelutipes (found in North America and Asia) and B.hypocarycinus (United States).|$|E
5|$|An ectomycorrhizal species, Caloboletus calopus {{grows in}} {{coniferous}} and deciduous woodland, often at higher altitudes, especially under beech and oak. Fruit bodies occur singly or in large groups. The species grows on <b>chalky</b> ground from July to December, in Northern Europe, and North America's Pacific Northwest and Michigan. In North America, its range extends south to Mexico. Variety frustosus is known from California and the Rocky Mountains of Idaho. In 1968, after comparing European and North American collections, Miller and Watling {{suggested that the}} typical form of C.calopus does not occur in the United States. Similar comparisons by other authors have {{led them to the}} opposite conclusion, and the species has since been included in several North American field guides. The bolete has been recorded from the Black Sea region in Turkey, from under Populus ciliata and Abies pindrow in Rawalpindi and Nathia Gali in Pakistan, Yunnan Province in China, Korea, and Taiwan.|$|E
2500|$|Then deep seas, Gault Clay and the Upper Greensand {{deposits}} {{form the}} deep soil, more evident where erosion {{has taken place}} on steeper hillslopes in the civil parish. The Gault Clay contains phosphate-rich nodules in discrete bands and has a rich marine fauna with abundant ammonites, bivalves and gastropods. The Upper Greensand comprises a variety of sediments with fine silts at the base giving way upwards into sandstones. Just before the paleogene which included the mass-extinction event of the non-avian dinosaurs sea levels dropped, exposing Sussex and Kent, marine Upnor Beds were deposited in Surrey. In the paleogene, Southern England slightly rose and the seas retreated and reddish and mottled clays of the Reading Beds were deposited by a large river sand delta system including {{across much of the}} Weald (which covers much of Sussex and Kent as well). [...] Later, a rise in sea level, around 50 million years ago caused widespread deposition, until 2 million years ago, of the London Clay across the county. The London Clay is a bluish-grey marine clay with isolated pockets of fossils especially where <b>chalkier.</b> The youngest part of the London Clay is known as the Claygate Beds and sand and soft sandstone of the Bagshot Formation, though in many areas such as this generally eroded, followed in most cases by a variable thickness of organic humus.|$|R
40|$|The Niobrara Formation, Denver-Julesburg (DJ) and Piceance basins, Colorado, {{is one of}} {{the most}} active {{unconventional}} petroleum plays in the United States. This study characterizes those pore systems in one well in the DJ Basin and two wells in the Piceance Basin in order to isolate the impact of lithologic variability on pore characteristics. This objective is accomplished through the combination of scanning electron microscopy of Ar-milled rock surfaces, image analysis with Avizio 9 software, and mineralogical characterization by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and electron microprobe mapping. The twenty-one imaged samples span the chalk to marly shale lithologies of the Niobrara Interval. This study focuses on the pre-hydrocarbon migration pore systems in order to minimize the influences of differential hydrocarbon saturations, surface wettability, and post-migration thermal maturation. The goal of this project is to understand the basic lithologic controls on the pore systems. Data on size, shape, and orientation of individual pores were collected and compared to lithology (weight percent calcium) and grouped by fabric element to establish trends that can be related to well-scale observations. Total pre-migration porosity positively correlates to lithology (r = 0. 93) with a range of 3. 4 % to 11. 7 %, with the <b>chalkiest</b> samples showing the greatest porosity. Median pore size, width, anisotropy, and degree of horizontal orientation also all correlate, to varying degrees, with lithology. Overall, pores associated with peloids (always calcitic) and calcitic matrices (chalk and marly chalk) consistently display the largest sizes (medians of ~ 175 nm), most equant shapes, and smallest horizontal preference. In contrast, pores in clay-rich, calcite-poor matrices (marl and shaley marl) are the smallest (medians of ~ 150 nm), most elongate, and most horizontal. Petroleum explorationists should guide drilling toward zones of the highest calcite and peloid concentrations in order to find the largest and best connected pore systems. Pairing this information with an understanding of the thermal maturity and hydrocarbon saturations will help identify the most favorable petroleum resources in the Niobrara Formation...|$|R
40|$|Birnaviruses have a bi-segmented {{double-stranded}} RNA genome residing {{within a}} single-shelled non-enveloped icosahedral particle. There are economic reasons to study birnaviruses and prevent their propagation {{as many of}} the birnaviruses are pathogenic to species that are consumed by humans (salmon, yellowtail fish, chicken, and clam) and some are commercially farmed. Protease VP 4 cleaves the polyprotein (NH 2 -pVP 2 -VP 4 -VP 3 -COOH) of birnavirus into components required for virion assembly. It utilizes a serine-lysine (Ser/Lys) catalytic dyad that is less characterized than the Ser/His/Asp classical catalytic triad; thus, there are also scientific interests in studying its mechanism. The crystal structure of Infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) revealed acyl-enzyme complexes suggesting that VP 4 proteases could be used to trap different stages of the reaction mechanism. Here, I present the results of the crystallography analysis on VP 4 proteases from Tellina virus 1 (TV- 1), and Yellowtail ascites virus (YAV). These structures provided insights on how VP 4 proteases interact with the substrates and how the polyprotein is cleaved; thus, will aid in the design of anti- birnavirus compounds. TV- 1 was first isolated from the sand dwelling marine bivalve mollusk Tellina tenuis (clam). Manifestations of the disease include a thinner and <b>chalkier</b> shell as well as a pale yellow digestive gland. The structure of TV- 1 VP 4 was solved to 2. 1 Å resolution revealing an intramolecular (cis) acyl-enzyme complex which demonstrates how the enzyme recognizes its own carboxy-terminus during the VP 4 /VP 3 cleavage event. To our knowledge, {{this is the first time}} that an intramolecular acyl-enzyme has been observed within a protease crystal structure. YAV infection leads to ascites in yellowtail fish (Seriola quinqueradiata), which is popular in sushi. The existence of a previously proposed internal cleavage site within VP 4 was confirmed using protein and fluorometric peptide cleavage assays as well as capturing it in two acyl-enzyme structures. The native active site structure (2. 5 Å resolution) revealed both the acyl-enzyme and product bound states. The lysine mutant structure (2. 3 Å resolution) revealed the acyl-enzyme and empty binding site states of VP 4, which allows for the observation of structural changes upon substrate or product binding...|$|R
5|$|Inocybe maculata is an ectomycorrhizal species, {{with a wide}} {{ecological}} range. It can {{be found}} in all biomes from low-lying deciduous woodland to arctic-alpine areas. It typically grows on the ground in deciduous (or mixed) woodland, favouring beech. It grows best on <b>chalky</b> soil, among leaf litter. In North America, it favours sandy soil, clay or moss. It is also encountered on pathsides. As well as beech, the species has been recorded growing in association with hornbeam, hazel, oak and lime. Inocybe maculata f. fulva favours birch, spruce, pine, Populus, willow, (as well as Dryas and Polygonum in alpine regions). Mushrooms grow individually or in scattered groups. Though widespread in the areas it is found, it is not a common species. It can be found from western Europe to eastern Asia; and in North America, from where it was first collected in the 1960s. Inocybe maculata f. fulva was first identified in France, and has since been found elsewhere in Europe.|$|E
5|$|The {{interiors}} of most Norfolk churches contain much pre-Reformation graffiti, {{unless they have}} been heavily limewashed or resurfaced. The churches of the Glaven ports in general, and Blakeney in particular, conform to this pattern. St Nicholas has an extensive array of prayers, merchant's marks and other symbols, but is notable for {{the large number of}} depictions of ships, at least 30, heavily concentrated in the nave towards the eastern end of the south aisle. There is a side altar there of unknown dedication, and an empty niche that would have once held the image of a saint. The pillars were painted red in the Middle Ages, and ship images scratched into the soft, <b>chalky</b> stone would have been much more conspicuous than they are now. It is likely that the images, mostly of smaller ships, were created as votive offerings by the seafaring inhabitants of the port. The carving of ship graffiti in religious buildings is a tradition in ports going back to the Bronze Age, and has been found across Europe.|$|E
5|$|Before commencing laying, {{the female}} spends much time near the nest and is entirely {{provisioned}} by the male. Meanwhile, the male roosts nearby and may cache any prey that is surplus to their requirements. When the female has reached peak weight, the male provides a ritual presentation {{of food and}} copulation occurs at the nest. The female lays eggs on alternate days and the clutch size averages about five eggs (range two to nine). The eggs are <b>chalky</b> white, somewhat elliptical and {{about the size of}} bantam's eggs, and incubation begins as soon as the first egg is laid. While she is sitting on the nest, the male is constantly bringing more provisions and they may pile up beside the female. The incubation period is about thirty days, hatching takes place over a prolonged period and the youngest chick may be several weeks younger than its oldest sibling. In years with plentiful supplies of food, there may be a hatching success rate of about 75%. The male continues to copulate with the female when he brings food which makes the newly hatched chicks vulnerable to injury.|$|E
5|$|Highly abundant, {{the brown}} roll-rim is found across the Northern Hemisphere, Europe and Asia, with records from India, China, Japan, Iran, and Turkey's eastern Anatolia. It is equally widely {{distributed}} across northern North America, extending north to Alaska, {{where it has}} been collected from tundra near Coldfoot in the interior of the state. In southwestern Greenland, P. involutus has been recorded under the birch species Betula nana, B. pubescens and B. glandulosa. The mushroom is more common in coniferous woods in Europe, but is also closely associated with birch (Betula pendula). Within woodland, it prefers wet places or boggy ground, and avoids calcareous (<b>chalky)</b> soils. It has been noted to grow alongside Boletus badius in Europe, and Leccinum scabrum and Lactarius plumbeus in the Pacific Northwest region of North America. There it is found in both deciduous and coniferous woodland, commonly under plantings of white birch (Betula papyrifera) in urban areas. It is one of a small number of fungal species which thrive in Pinus radiata plantations planted outside their natural range. A study of polluted Scots pine forest around Oulu in northern Finland found that P.involutus became more abundant in more polluted areas while other species declined. Emissions from pulp mills, fertiliser, heating and traffic were responsible for the pollution, which was measured by sulfur levels in the pine needles.|$|E
5|$|Like all Tylopilus species, T.felleus is mycorrhizal. It {{is found}} in {{deciduous}} and coniferous woodland, often under beech and oak in well-drained acid soils, which can be sandy, gravelly or peaty. If encountered on calcareous (<b>chalky)</b> soil, {{it will be in}} moist areas that have become waterlogged and have ample leaf litter. Fruit bodies grow singly or in small groups, and occasionally in small clusters with two or three joined {{at the base of the}} stem. Fruit bodies have also been growing in the cavities of old trees, on old conifer stumps, or on buried rotten wood. The fungus obtains most of its nitrogen requirements from amino acids derived from the breakdown of proteins, although a lesser amount is obtained from the amino sugar glucosamine (a breakdown product of chitin, a major component of fungal cell walls). The mycorrhizal plant partner benefits from the fungus's ability to use these forms of nitrogen, which are often abundant in the forest floor. Fruit bodies appear over summer and autumn, anytime from June to October or even November, in many of the northern temperate zones. Large numbers may appear in some years, and none in others, generally proportional to the amount of rainfall. Variety uliginosus, known from Michigan, grows among lichens and mosses under pines.|$|E
