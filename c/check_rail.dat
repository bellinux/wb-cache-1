50|$|The viaduct was {{the most}} {{substantial}} single structure on the line. It is sharply curved, necessitating the provision of a <b>check</b> <b>rail</b> in its active railway days. In 1953 extensive repair work was undertaken in which the opportunity was taken to raise the parapet and add metal railings on top.|$|E
50|$|Railway {{trackage}} has guard <b>rails</b> (aka <b>check</b> <b>rails)</b> {{to guide}} wheels through possible catch points on turnouts or diamonds. Similarly, guard rails may be installed inside the innermost running rails on very sharp curves. The other most common usage {{is to prevent}} damage to other structures, especially bridges, in a derailment.|$|R

50|$|In {{railroad}} use, guard <b>rails</b> or <b>check</b> <b>rails</b> {{are placed}} parallel to regular running rail along areas of restricted clearance, {{such as a}} bridge, trestle, or tunnel.

50|$|The frog {{end of the}} {{switched}} crossing, despite {{still having}} a gap in one rail, is less problematic in this regard. The outer rail is still continuous, the wing rail (the part that turns out, after the frog gap) provides a gradual transition, and the <b>check</b> <b>rail</b> avoids the possibility of points splitting. This {{can be seen in}} how, under examination, the wing rail has a wider polished section, showing how the wheel load is transferred across the gap.|$|E
5000|$|... {{there is}} only one platform, but there is space for a second which would make {{possible}} a more intensive service on the Sunshine Coast Line. To the east of the station, Colne Junction is the western extremity of a triangle which gives access towards Colchester station to the west and Hythe station to the east. The curve to the north from Colne Junction to East Gates Junction is sharp, with a continuous <b>check</b> <b>rail</b> which necessitates slow passage.|$|E
25|$|Turnouts, {{also known}} as points and switches, are the means of {{directing}} a train onto a diverging section of track. Laid similar to normal track, a point typically consists of a frog (common crossing), <b>check</b> <b>rails</b> and two switch rails. The switch rails may be moved left or right, {{under the control of}} the signalling system, to determine which path the train will follow.|$|R
50|$|Derailers are {{electrically}} powered. They {{have traditionally}} been regarded as the ultimate safeguard in preventing vehicle access and are fitted to tracks approaching the depot. However, derailers do have drawbacks - they can result in significant damage to infrastructure and Traction and Rolling Stock {{in the event of}} a derailment (which can be costly and extremely disruptive to operations) and in some cases, can be innefective or restrictive (they cannot be fitted in close vicinity to <b>check</b> <b>rails,</b> for example).|$|R

Due to the engines flangeless centre driving wheels and the worry that the raised <b>check</b> <b>rails</b> on modern pointwork may cause a derailment the class alongside other 2-10-0 locomotives are presently banned from operating on the mainline including the Esk Valley Line from Battersby to Whitby which is used by the North Yorkshire Moors Railway on their Grosmont to Whitby trains alongside the regular passenger services on the route.|$|R
5000|$|A {{guard rail}} (<b>check</b> <b>rail)</b> {{is a short}} piece of rail placed {{alongside}} the main (stock) rail opposite the frog. These exist {{to ensure that the}} wheels follow the appropriate flangeway through the frog and that the train does not derail. Generally, there are two of these for each frog, one by each outer rail. Guard rails are not required with a [...] "self-guarding cast manganese" [...] frog, as the raised parts of the casting serve the same purpose. These frogs are for low-speed use and are common in rail yards.|$|E
50|$|After the {{war years}} the Balloons were {{neglected}} slightly {{in place of the}} new Coronation Cars, as they were considered old fashioned and too slow to load. Blackpool Corporation soon changed its mind after experiencing the temperamental nature of the Coronations and the Balloons began to make a comeback in the late 1950s. In 1958 <b>check</b> <b>rail</b> was installed through to Fleetwood, a requirement to allow the Balloons to operate to Fleetwood and the Balloons increasingly began to appear on market-day specials, as they were useful for moving the large crowds travelling north. The Balloons continued to run their normal Squires Gate service until its closure in 1961 and following this the entire class solely worked on the promenade service.|$|E
50|$|A {{derailment}} {{occurred on}} 23 January 1894: the 6 p.m. passenger train from Weymouth to Abbotsbury hauled by Armstrong standard good locomotive no 52 running tender first was negotiating the sharp curve between Upwey Junction and Upwey stations. The leading (in {{the direction of}} travel) coupled wheels derailed to the right, by the flange climbing the high rail. The Parliamentary plans showed the curve to be 12 chains radius, {{but there was a}} short section at 8Â½ chains. The locomotive class had a relatively long rigid wheelbase, at 15ft 8ins and there was no <b>check</b> <b>rail.</b> The driver was found to be working regular shifts of 14 hours 5 minutes on six days a week, although this was not contributory to the accident.|$|E

During conversion a third rail {{was provided to}} enable the narrow gauge trains to continue operation until conversion was complete. Narrow gauge operation ceased on 5 September 1883. In some cases the third rail was removed and in others it was moved along sleepers to serve as <b>check</b> <b>rails</b> on curves. The formal standard gauge opening was on 10 September 1883, at which time the physical Festiniog and Blaenau Railway ceased to exist.|$|R

50|$|Between a large, tiered modern {{cutting of}} {{shotcrete}} (known as Moggill's Wall {{and not of}} cultural heritage significance) and the entrance to Tunnel 3 (144.5 km), a steep, high and long rock face incorporates a number of features. The rock face runs parallel to a large section of <b>check</b> <b>railed</b> curving track. The face begins with a wall of pick-faced, cut and dressed stone extending approximately seven metres high and wide. As the face increases in height, large sections of concrete rendering surround numerous areas of pick-faced exposed rock. Set in among eroded sandstone at various heights are sections of cut and dressed and mortared stone work. Small tufts of vegetation are scattered along the face. Directly outside the entrance to Tunnel 3, a high cutting of steep rock has extensive pick facing and a section of stone walling along its base.|$|R
40|$|Track {{stiffness}} in railway turnouts is variable due {{to differences}} in structural composition along the longitudinal direction, which will lead to severe dynamic interaction between train and turnout. In this paper, a transient analysis model is presented to investigate the stiffness characteristics of high-speed railway turnouts based on the finite element method and is applied to optimise the stiffness of railway turnouts. Furthermore, the effect of the stiffness variations on the dynamic train-turnout interaction is analysed. The calculation results show that the track stiffness characteristics are similar in the main and diverging line of railway turnout, except for the <b>check</b> <b>rail</b> sections. Due to the existence of shared baseplates and spacer blocks between different rails, the stiffness variations in the crossing panel are most severe in high-speed railway turnouts. The stiffness differences (calculated as the ratio of the maximum and minimum stiffness) of the longitudinal and lateral direction for Chinese number 18 ballasted turnout are 216 % and 229 %, respectively. The graded stiffness of the tie pads has been redesigned to optimise the stiffness of railway turnout based on the transient analysis model and the stiffness differences of the turnout are decreased. Altogether, the dynamic train-turnout interaction is enhanced remarkably by considering the turnoutâs stiffness characteristics...|$|E
40|$|Dynamic trainâtrack {{interaction}} {{is more complex}} in railway turnouts (switches & crossings) than on ordinary tangent or curved tracks. Multiple contacts between wheel and rail are common, and severe impact loads with broad frequency contents are induced when the nominal wheelârail contact conditions are disturbed due to the continuous variation in rail profiles and the discontinuities in the crossing panel. The absence of transition curves at the entry and exit of the turnout, and the cant deficiency, lead to large wheelârail contact forces and passenger discomfort when the train is switching into the turnout track. Two alternative multibody system (MBS) models of dynamic interaction between the train and a standard turnout design are developed. The first model is derived using a commercial MBS software. The second model {{is based on a}} multibody dynamics formulation that may account for the structural flexibility of train and track components (based on finite element models and coordinate reduction methods). The variation in rail profile is accounted for by sampling the cross-section of each rail at several positions along the turnout. Contact between the back of the wheel flange and the <b>check</b> <b>rail,</b> when the wheelset is steered through the crossing, is considered. Good agreement between the results from the two models is observed when the track model is taken as rigid...|$|E
40|$|Two {{models for}} {{simulation}} of dynamic interaction between train and turnout are developed. The {{first one is}} derived using a commercial software for dynamics of multi-body systems. The second {{is based on a}} detailed model of track dynamics and a multi-body dynamics formulation that accounts for excitation in an extended frequency range (up to several hundred Hz). Using a finite element model of a standard turnout design, a complex-valued modal superposition of track dynamics is applied to account for the structural receptance of the track components. The variations in rail profile, track stiffness and track inertia along the turnout, and contact between the back of the wheel flange and the <b>check</b> <b>rail,</b> are considered. Hertzian theory and FASTSIM are used for the normal and tangential wheelârail rolling contact. Stochastic analysis methods are integrated with the dynamic simulation model. For one given nominal layout of the turnout, the influence of several parameters on wear and rolling contact fatigue is investigated. Four parameters (axle load, wheelârail friction coefficient, and wheel and rail profiles) are identified to be the most significant. Random distributions of the transverse wheel profile and of a set of transverse rail profiles along the switch panel are accounted for by use of the KarhunenâLoÃ¨ve expansion technique. To determine input data for the turnout model (rail pad stiffness, ballast stiffness and modal damping), impact load testing for measurement of track receptance was performed in the field. Lateral and vertical wheelârail contact forces were measured by an instrumented wheelset to validate the mathematical models. Good agreement between measured and calculated contact forces is observed. The influence of train speed, moving direction and route on the measured wheelârail contact forces is quantified...|$|E
50|$|Gelli Felen Halt {{was opened}} by the LMS on 6 September 1933. It was {{situated}} {{to the west}} of the twin-bore Gelli Felen Tunnel (Down 386 yd; Up 352 yd) from which the station was reached on a sharp left-hand curve where flangeless 0-8-4T locomotives had in the past derailed. At this point the line ran along the sheer rock face of the cutting side which was reinforced with engineering brick. Gelli Felen railway halt was in an isolated location on a 1 in 38 gradient on a sharp curve requiring <b>check</b> <b>rails</b> to prevent derailment. Short staggered platforms were provided with a barrack-like brick huts as passenger shelters. To the west of the station there had been a signal box, crossover and siding but these had gone by 1931; the signal box was opened on the Up side in 1898 and was known as Gellavalln.|$|R
50|$|The Main Range Railway {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{challenging}} sections of line for enginemen during the steam era on the Queensland Railways. Despite the advent of more powerful locomotives during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the combination of sharp curves, steep grades and tunnels created difficult conditions for crews. Railway workers needed to ensure adequate supplies of coal and water to negotiate the crossing and banking engines were employed between Murphy's Creek and Toowoomba to assist ascending trains. On curved sections of track inner <b>check</b> <b>rails</b> were laid to minimise the possibility of derailment after 1897. Sandboxes were placed along the line to assist wheel traction. Despite being a difficult stretch of railway to work, the Main Range line has been relatively free of major disasters. Of the fatal incidents that have occurred, the worst was the Murphy's Creek collision (1913) when six men were killed.|$|R

50|$|Between the 148 km and 149 km posts {{a number}} of {{stabilising}} features are set in {{to the base of}} low sections of bank opposite the railway. Running parallel to a section of <b>check</b> <b>railed</b> curving track is a stone retaining wall. The wall is rubble coursed, and is set into the base of a steep low bank. Much of the higher portion of the wall is rendered and there is evidence of collapse. The wall continues for approximately 15 metres, adjoining a low squared section of rock face close to the base, marked by a painted 7 within a white square. After passing a high tiered face of lightly coloured and loosely packed rock, a small low bank running parallel to a short, straight section of rail between two curves incorporates {{a number of}} features. Parallel to where the rail straightens is a steeply sloping retaining wall of brick. The bricks range in colour from orange to brown and are labelled: Campbells Redbank. The brickwork adjoins a low vertical section of pick-faced rock that extends until the next curve. The face contains a small section of cut and dressed stone and brickwork set in underneath the rock face to the base. Above the bank set into the hillside a section of stone walling is largely obscured by vegetation.|$|R
