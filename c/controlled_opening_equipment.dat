While the tubes break into pieces when treated {{with water and}} ethanol, they unzip through longitudinal cutting along the axes to yield nanoribbons when treated with long chain thiols, 1 -octanethiol and 1 -dodecanethiol.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} effects of capital {{openness}} on financial crises and contagion. In the model, we analyze four channels of contagion {{involved in the process}} of financial crisis: monsoon effects, spillovers, self-fulfilling expectations and new information. We empirically test the data from China, an economy with capital account controls, and find that the fundamentals of China (PRC) are now in a vulnerable area which yields multiple equilibria. Consequently, the Chinese economy is easily affected via the channels discussed in this paper. Finally we suggest that the capital account of China should be opened gradually.

Leaflets also open without illumination, but such opening starts later and is slower and less complete. Opening in the dark is accompanied by lower potassium efflux from dorsal pulvinule motor cells but equal or greater potassium movement into ventral motor cells than occurs during opening in the light. Far red-absorbing phytochrome inhibits opening in the dark, indicating that its action is similar during endogenously <b>controlled</b> <b>opening</b> and nyctinastic closure; i. e., a high far redabsorbing phytochrome level is associated with low potassium content in ventral motor cells, high potassium content in dorsal motor cells, and a small angle between leaflets...|$|R
