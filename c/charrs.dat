40|$|ABSTRACT. Three arctic <b>charr</b> (Salvelinus alpinus) morphs coexist {{within the}} Dieset {{watercourse}} (79 ˚ 10 'N, 11 ˚ 20 'E) on Spitsbergen, Svalbard. Small freshwater resident <b>charr</b> exhibited {{a very slow}} growth rate, while large freshwater resident <b>charr</b> grew at a rate comparable to that reported for cannibalistic <b>charr</b> elsewhere. First-time sea migrants of the anadromous <b>charr</b> were similar in size to their more southern-living Norwegian conspecifics, but on average two years older. The average number of sea runs before first-time spawning was 3. 6 for males and 4. 4 for females. Veteran migrants displayed growth {{comparable to that of}} anadromous <b>charr</b> from more southern populations. In all three morphs, sex ratio did not differ from unity. The short-lived small residents matured from an age of 4 years, 3 to 4 years earlier than did large residents and anadromous <b>charr.</b> The majority of small resident and anadromous <b>charr</b> spawn a maximum of three times, while large resident <b>charr</b> may spawn up to seven times. Although 69 % of large resident <b>charr</b> were older than 15 years, only 5. 7 % of reproductive anadromous <b>charr</b> exceeded this age. This divergence may indicate different reproductive strategies between the two morphs. There was no evidence of reproductive isolation between these High Arctic <b>charr</b> morphs...|$|R
40|$|Biological {{characteristics}} and population dynamics of northern Labrador anadromous Arctic <b>charr</b> (Salvelinus alpinus) were investigated. Univariate and multivariate statistical {{analyses were performed}} on nine meristic and thirteen morphometric characters of <b>charr</b> samples from various northern Labrador areas. Variation in meristic characters was slight, although significant differences between samples indicated the discrete nature of the stocks. Differences in growth rate, age at maturity, and movement patterns of tagged fish corroborated results of morphological analyses. [...] Biological characteristics including age, growth, movement patterns and aspects of reproduction were examined in Fraser River Arctic <b>charr.</b> No consistent differences in growth rate were found between male and female <b>charr.</b> Upstream migration from the sea began in mid-July with a tendency for larger fish to enter the river first. Average size and age of upstream migrants were 45. 1 cm and 8. 3 years respectively. [...] Biological characteristics of commercially exploited and unexploited Labrador <b>charr</b> populations were examined. Mean age of <b>charr</b> increased with latitude. Commercial exploitation has reduced the proportion of <b>charr</b> greater than 2. 3 kg (gutted head-on weight) in commercial catches. Mean length of catches, however, has remained relatively constant in several areas. Total instantaneous mortality rates varied from 0. 48 to 0. 83 in exploited areas to 0. 28 and 0. 29 in unexploited populations. [...] Comparisons between northern Labrador Arctic <b>charr</b> and <b>charr</b> from other regions are discussed with respect to movement patterns, size, age and reproductive characteristics. Labrador· <b>charr</b> migrated to sea {{for the first time at}} smaller sizes (7. 8 - 19. 1 cm) but comparable ages (3 - 7 years) with Arctic <b>charr</b> from other regions. Egg production in Fraser River <b>charr</b> was intermediate between <b>charr</b> from eastern and central Arctic regions, and those from the Western Arctic.

Female brook <b>charr</b> from neutral lakes initiated exogenous vitellogenesis in July. <b>Charr</b> from acidic lakes began exogenous vitellogenesis approximately one month later than neutral lake <b>charr.</b> <b>Charr</b> from acidic lakes had fewer yolky oocytes and more oil droplet oocytes than those from neutral lakes in July and August. However, oocyte development was accelerated from September onwards and the abundance of all oocyte stages was the same in <b>charr</b> from acidic and neutral lakes by October. <b>Charr</b> from the acidic lakes produced significantly more mature ova than <b>charr</b> from neutral lakes, but the average weight and diameter of the ova were decreased. Plasma estrogen and vitellogenin levels did not differ among <b>charr</b> from acidic and neutral lakes. Male brook <b>charr</b> from neutral lakes initiated rapid spermatogenesis in June, as measured by the increase in spermatocyte and spermatozoa cyst diameter and percent of testis area. <b>Charr</b> from acidic lakes initiated rapid spermatogenesis and spermiogenesis in July, one month later than <b>charr</b> from the neutral lakes. The rate of spermatogenesis increased in <b>charr</b> from acidic lakes in September, so by October, the quantity of spermatozoa in their testes was the same as in <b>charr</b> from neutral lakes. Histological evidence indicates that <b>charr</b> from acidic lakes did not spawn in October and November, as did those in neutral lakes.

Listening to {{underwater sound}} {{is a simple}} way of studying the activity and behaviour of aquatic fauna. The material used in the Institute of Limnology (Thonon-les-Bains) for recording and analysing sounds is described (figure 2). Experiments have been performed on the spawning sites of coregonids (Coregonus lavaretus) in Lake Aiguebelette and of <b>charrs</b> (Salvelinus alpinus) in Lake Annecy. This paper refers mainly to observations made in December 1987 {{on the site of}} "Roc de Chère" in Lake Annecy; this is where the <b>charrs</b> spawn and the site is easy to survey (figure 1). Most of the work consisted in continuous visual and acoustical observations, {{in order to determine the}} origin of the sounds recorded. A great part of the period was noisy because of water disturbance (wind-induced waves). The most interesting aspect is the study of sounds produced by fish (figure 3). We could not record the activity of the <b>charrs,</b> because of the inconvenient area studied : the observation field was limited to 1 sq. metre, which is very small in comparison to the spawning zone (figure 1). The presence of burbot (Lota lota) in the field of the video camera suggested that these fish came and ate the charr eggs which had been deposited on the bottom. This hypothesis was confirmed by the continuous digging activity (which was heard and recorded) due to the burbot feeding and by an analysis of the stomacal content of specimens, caught white SCUBA diving, which contained fertile eggs. Though acoustically evident, burbot activity was not analysed. The coregonids found in Lake Annecy (1987) (C. species) have the same behaviour as those found in Lake Aiguebelette (1986) (C. lavaretus, a different species). Typical, short (0. 5 - 2 s) stridulating noises are produced during courtship, when the male and the female rub against each other; these noises, nearly always the same, have been analysed (figure 4). The loudest sounds emitted are in the 100 - 300 Hz range. Another aspect of fish activity has been studied : the noise made by coregonids swimming (figure 4). During courtship, fish is very active and swims energetically. The low frequency of the sound has been recorded by using a special electronic device. All these observations are in accordance with the results presented in the literature. Acoustical observation is an interesting method which should be developed...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Radiotelemetry {{was used}} to {{determine}} whether Lake Hazen arctic <b>charr</b> (Salvelinus alpinus) were anadromous and to determine movements of the <b>charr</b> within the lake. In 1995 and 1996, 62 and 55 <b>charr,</b> respectively, were captured, radio-tagged, and released back into the lake. A fixed data acquisition system recorded limited movements of radio-tagged <b>charr</b> in {{the upper reaches of the}} Ruggles River, the only outlet from the lake to the sea, in 1995. When movements of radio-tagged <b>charr</b> within Lake Hazen were monitored opportunistically in 1995, most of the relocated <b>charr</b> were found in warmer, more productive waters associated with inflowing streams. No movements of radio-tagged <b>charr</b> in the Ruggles River were recorded in 1996 when the data acquisition system was operated in the lower reaches of the river. These observations supported the conclusions of a study of Lake Hazen <b>charr</b> otolith strontium distribution that Lake Hazen <b>charr</b> were non-anadromous. The Ruggles River may be a detriment to anadromous behaviour because of its length (ca. 29 km), velocity (up to 2. 25 m·s- 1), and the year-round presence of aufeis (layered ice buildup).

40|$|Abstract. The {{demand for}} {{and costs of}} {{producing}} land-based animal protein continues to escalate as the world population increases. Fish is an excellent protein, but the catch-fishery is stagnant or in decline. Intensive cage culture of fish is a viable option especially in countries with lakes/rivers and/or a long coast-line; however, disease outbreaks will likely occur more frequently with cage culture. Hence protective strate-gies are needed, and one approach is to exploit the piscine immune system. This discussion highlights immunity (innate/natural and adaptive/acquired) in fish against three pathogenic protozoa (Amyloodinium ocellatum, Ichthyophthirius multifiliis and Cryptobia salmositica). Histone-like proteins in the mucus and skin of naturally resistant fish kill trophonts of A. ocellatum, and also may cause abnormal development of tomonts. Breeding of Cryptobia-resistant brook <b>charrs</b> is possible as resistance is controlled by a dominant Mendelian locus, and the parasite is lysed via the Alternative Pathway of Complement Activation. Production of transgenic Cryptobia-tolerant salmon is an option. Recovered fish are protected from the three diseases (acquired immunity). Live I. multifiliis theronts injected intraperitoneally into fish elicit protection. Also, a recombinant immoblizing-antigen vaccine against ichthyophthirosis has been developed but further evalu-ations are necessary. The live Cryptobia vaccine protects salmonids from infections while the DNA-vaccine stimulates production of antibodies to neutralize the disease causing factor (metalloprotease) in cryptobio...|$|E

40|$|Under {{experimental}} conditions, I {{have studied}} and compared the thermal performance of several geographically separated wild Arctic <b>charr</b> populations. In addition, I {{have studied the}} preferred temperatures of <b>charr</b> and brown trout. Fish were reared both singly and in groups. The data were analysed and fitted to baseline models in order to estimate the growth efficiency {{as well as the}} lower, the upper and the optimum temperatures for growth and feeding of <b>charr.</b> Overall, the optimum temperature for feeding and growth of <b>charr</b> was found in the range 14 - 17 °C and only slight differences was found between populations. The lower and upper limit for feeding and growth were estimated at about 2 - 3 °C and 21 - 22 °C, respectively. The upper limits and the optimum temperatures for growth and feeding are clearly higher than suggested in previous studies. The unexpected high lower limit may result from fish being acclimatised to summer conditions and the rather short (14 days) experimental periods. <b>Charr</b> had remarkably high growth efficiency that varied between 40 - 60 %. The growth efficiency was only moderately affected by temperature. The preferred temperature of <b>charr</b> was found to be 11. 4 °C, which is about 3. 5 °C lower than the temperature for maximum growth. This was significantly lower than for trout, which selected a temperature of 16. 0 °C. Thus, <b>charr</b> thermoregulation strongly contradicts the general rule of coincidence of preferred temperature and optimum temperature for growth of fish, while brown trout obeys it. This finding might partly explain why <b>charr</b> and trout are niche segregated, when they exists in sympatry. The summer temperature in the littoral of lakes containing sympatric <b>charr</b> and trout generally exceeds the preferred temperature of <b>charr,</b> which then will move to cooler and deeper areas. Today, the Arctic <b>charr</b> in Scandinavia appears to be on the southern edge of its distribution.

40|$|Two {{reproductive}} isolated morphs of Arctic <b>charr</b> (Salvelinus alpinus), termed profundal and littoral <b>charr</b> {{according to}} their different spawning habitats, co-occur in the postglacial lake Fjellfrøsvatn in North Norway. All profundal <b>charr</b> live in deep water their entire life and have a maximum size of 14  cm, while the littoral <b>charr</b> grow to 40  cm. Some small and young littoral <b>charr</b> move to the profundal zone in an ontogenetic habitat shift in the ice-free season {{and the rest of}} the population remains in epilimnic waters. The two morphs had different diet niches in the profundal zone: the profundal <b>charr</b> ate typical soft-bottom prey (chironomid larvae, pea mussels and benthic copepods), while the young littoral <b>charr</b> mainly consumed crustacean zooplankton. In four other lakes without a profundal morph (i. e. monomorphic populations), young <b>charr</b> also performed ontogenetic habitat shifts to the profundal zone and fed on zooplankton. The profundal morph of Fjellfrøsvatn therefore utilize a food resource niche that neither the littoral morph nor comparable monomorphic populations exploit. This suggests that intraspecific resource competition has driven incipient ecological speciation of the profundal <b>charr</b> of Fjellfrøsvatn. The exploitation of the soft-bottom resources by the profundal <b>charr</b> supports earlier experimental findings that the profundal morph is genetically different in trophic behaviour and morphology. The sympatric ecological divergence within the profundal habitat is possible because unexploited food resources (soft-bottom profundal prey) are available. Apparently, this represents a case of incipient segregation by expansion to new resource types (niche invasion), and not by subdivision of one broad ancestral niche...|$|R
40|$|Morphological {{integration}} {{can respond}} to environmental conditions, a response that may be dynamic through ontogeny. Among fishes, brook <b>charrs</b> (Salvelinus fontinalis) display a trophic polymorphism {{that makes it a}} good species for analyzing the ontogeny of morphological integration. To better understand the processes regulating variation and integration, we assess the ontogenetic dynamics of covariances and developmental progress for populations of S. fontinalis from two habitats that differ in water velocity; lake and stream. Geometric morphometrics and developmental progress were evaluated on 751 and 198 specimens, respectively. In both habitats, most ossification events occur before the transition from alevin to juvenile. This threshold defines two distinct periods. During the first period representing free-embryos and alevins, there are important shape changes and rapid ossification, integration tends to be relatively low and decreasing and the variance of shape drastically decreases. During the juvenile period, the rate of shape change decreases and the onset of ossification is nearly complete, plus integration increases and shape variance stabilizes. While we find two distinct developmental periods, we nonetheless find a notable stability underlying the ontogenetic dynamics of variability as well as gradual change in the structure of covariation within each habitat. Our results imply that the variability of juvenile body shape does not seem to retain signals of variability determined early in ontogeny and warrants caution in using juvenile as guides to the earlier causes of variability. Overall, this study highlights the difficulty of inferring causes of integration from studies of static covariance...|$|E

Growth and stress-related quantitative trait loci (QTL) have been already identified in several salmonid species, but little {{effort has been}} devoted to <b>charrs</b> (genus Salvelinus).

Here, our objective was to identify QTL for 27 phenotypes related to growth and stress responses in brook charr (Salvelinus fontinalis), {{which is one of the}} most economically important freshwater aquaculture species in Canada. Phenotypes included 12 growth parameters, six blood and plasma variables, three hepatic variables, and one plasma hormone level as well as the relative expression measurements of five genes of interest linked to growth regulation. QTL analysis relied on a linkage map recently built from S. fontinalis consisting of both single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP, n = 266) and microsatellite (n = 81) markers in an F 2 interstrain hybrid population (n = 171). We identified 63 growth-related QTL and four stress-related QTL across 18 of the 40 linkage groups of the brook charr linkage map. Percent variance explained, confidence interval, and allelic QTL effects also were investigated to provide insight into the genetic architecture of growth- and stress-related QTL. QTL related to growth {{performance and}} stress response that were identified could be classified into two groups: (1) a group composed of the numerous, small-effect QTL associated with some traits related to growth (i. e., weight) that may be under the control of a large number of genes or pleiotropic genes, and (2) a group of less numerous QTL associated with growth (i. e., gene expression) and with stress-related QTL that display a larger effect, suggesting that these QTL are under the control of a limited number of genes of major effect.

40|$|English: Urbanization is {{a serious}} threat to stream ecosystems. Culverts {{fragment}} habitats, and can function as migration barriers. If migratory individuals are prevented to move between important habitats, this could potentially result in spatial variation in lifehistory traits. Brook charr (Salvelinus fontinalis) is an introduced salmonid species of North- American origin. It has shown to be mobile within systems, and its life history patterns to be phenotypic plastic. Despite being an unwanted species in the Norwegian fauna, it has received little attention as it has been considered to be a competition-weak species. In this study I tested the hypothesis that; a the degree of local-scale connectivity, including both natural- and man-made barriers, influences migration probability, and bowing to local-scale influence on within- stream section environmental conditions there are among-section differences in brook charr life history traits like growth, survival, and maturation. The hypothesis was tested in Oslo’s most urban stream, Hovinbekken. The study stream was divided into four spatially separated sections, where individuals of brook charr were caught using electroshocking, tagged with PIT-tags, and recaptured, during an eighteen months period (2010 - 2012). Over five sampling occasions, in total 528 brook charr individuals were caught, of which 452 were tagged. Out of 143 recaptured individuals, 8 moved between stations. 6 of them moved between the two stations without natural or man-made barriers, a pattern attributed to spawning and winter-migration. 2 individuals moved in a downstream direction through culverts, none the opposite way. Upstream migration through natural and artificial fragmented landscape seems therefore to be absent, probably impossible. Growth, survival, and length at maturation varied at a temporal and spatial scale; the southernmost and most urban stations had highest growth rate for 0 +, longer growth before stagnation, and matured at longer lengths, probably due to favorable temperature conditions. Survival probability seemed in general to be lowest over winter. Additionally, winter survival was size-dependent, i. e. larger fish having the highest survival. In contrast, and over summer, survival was negatively sizedependent. Spatial variation in size-dependent seasonal survival was found, and attributed to pool characteristics. Because of the inconsistence in size-independent spatial variation in survival, and the impossibility to determine age at sexual maturation, {{further research is needed to}} gain more knowledge of brook <b>charrs</b> life history traits in Hovinbekken.

Phenotypes included 12 growth parameters, six blood and plasma variables, three hepatic variables, and one plasma hormone level as well as the relative expression measurements of five genes of interest linked to growth regulation. QTL analysis relied on a linkage map recently built from S. fontinalis consisting of both single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP, n = 266) and microsatellite (n = 81) markers in an F 2 interstrain hybrid population (n = 171). We identified 63 growth-related QTL and four stress-related QTL across 18 of the 40 linkage groups of the brook charr linkage map. Percent variance explained, confidence interval, and allelic QTL effects also were investigated to provide insight into the genetic architecture of growth-and stress-related QTL. QTL related to growth {{performance and}} stress response that were identified could be classified into two groups: (1) a group composed of the numerous, small-effect QTL associated with some traits related to growth (i. e., weight) that may be under the control of a large number of genes or pleiotropic genes, and (2) a group of less numerous QTL associated with growth (i. e., gene expression) and with stress-related QTL that display a larger effect, suggesting that these QTL are under the control of a limited number of genes of major effect. This study represents a first step toward the identification of genes potentially linked to phenotypic variation of growth and stress response in brook charr. The ultimate goal is to provide new tools for developing Molecular Assisted Selection for this species. KEYWORDS linkage mapping QTL detection single-nucleotide polymorphism growth stress response Salvelinus fontinalis Quantitative trait loci (QTL), the portions of a species' genome that affect the variation of heritable phenotypic traits, are revealed by the association of phenotypes with molecular markers. They provide insight into the number of loci affecting a trait and on the distribution of the QTL effects of each locus (Lynch and Walsh 1998). QTL analysis has become a popular method for studying the genetic basis of continuous variation in a variety of systems and is now an integral tool in medical genetics, livestock production, plant breeding, and population genetics of model organisms (Slate 2005). Thus, this approach is of great interest when studying experimental populations obtained from livestock species. Knowledge gained from these analyses can be used to improve traits of economic importance such as growth, resistance to pathogens, sexual maturation, or stress response through the clarification of their underlying genetic basis. Such information helps the development of selection programs aiming to improve efficiency...|$|E
40|$|Understanding the {{processes}} underlying diversification can aid in formulating appropriate conservation management plans that help maintain the evolutionary potential of taxa, particularly under human-induced activities and climate change. Here we assessed the microsatellite genetic diversity {{and structure of}} three salmonid species, two native (Arctic <b>charr,</b> Salvelinus alpinus and brown trout, Salmo trutta) and one introduced (brook <b>charr,</b> Salvelinus fontinalis), from an alpine lake in sub-arctic Sweden, Lake Ann. The genetic diversity of the three species was similar and sufficiently high from a conservation genetics perspective: corrected total heterozygosity, H'(T) = 0. 54, 0. 66, 0. 60 and allelic richness, A(R) = 4. 93, 5. 53 and 5. 26 for Arctic <b>charr,</b> brown trout and brook <b>charr,</b> respectively. There were indications of elevated inbreeding coefficients in brown trout (G(IS) = 0. 144) and brook <b>charr</b> (G(IS) = 0. 129) although sibling relationships were likely a confounding factor, as {{a high proportion of}} siblings were observed in all species within and among sampling locations. Overall genetic structure differed between species, Fst = 0. 01, 0. 02 and 0. 04 in Arctic <b>charr,</b> brown trout and brook <b>charr</b> respectively, and there was differentiation at only a few specific locations. There was clear evidence of hybridisation between the native Arctic <b>charr</b> and the introduced brook <b>charr,</b> with 6 % of individuals being hybrids, all of which were sampled in tributary streams. The ecological and evolutionary consequences of the observed hybridisation are priorities for further research and the conservation of the evolutionary potential of native salmonid species...|$|R
40|$|In {{the complex}} fish {{community}} of Lake Skasen, southeastern Norway, the relative population density, habitat use and diet of Arctic <b>charr,</b> perch, roach and burbot was studied by a gill net survey during June-September 2010. A marked segregation in habitat use was observed, with Arctic <b>charr</b> and burbot {{captured in the}} profundal and deepest part of the pelagic habitat, and perch and roach captured in the littoral and {{upper part of the}} pelagic. Perch dominated the total catches, followed by roach. Arctic <b>charr</b> occurred in low numbers in the catches, and also had a low annual growth rate. Even in June, at low water temperatures, Arctic <b>charr</b> were confined to the profundal. Both Arctic <b>charr,</b> roach and perch fed on the same cladocerans, but all size groups of perch had fish as {{an important part of the}} diet. Analysis of stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes revealed a narrow trophic niche of Arctic <b>charr,</b> positioned at the extreme pelagic end of the carbon gradient relative to the other fish species. These had a wider span of δ 13 C signatures, but more positioned towards the littoral end of the carbon gradient. The low growth rate of Arctic <b>charr,</b> despite a low population density, indicates that food is a limiting resource for <b>charr</b> in this lake, probably due to a confinement to the profundal habitat as a result of competition and predator avoidance. Since all age-classes of Arctic <b>charr</b> seem to be enclosed in the profundal habitat, intraspecific competition and predation may be supplementary stressors resulting in low annual recruitment and low population density, as well as low individual growth rate, i. e. the population is squeezed. The narrow trophic niche of Arctic <b>charr</b> compared to perch, roach and burbot, revealed by stable isostope analysis, supports this conclusion...|$|R
40|$|The Arctic <b>charr</b> (Salvelinus alpinus L.) is a holarctic salmonid {{fish species}} with both {{landlocked}} and anadromous populations. In Scandinavia it is mainly {{found in the}} mountain area, but it also appears in deep and large lake further south, i. e. in the Alps. It is the northernmost freshwater fish and A. <b>charr</b> is generally regarded as the most cold-adapted freshwater fish. A. <b>charr</b> has been commercially farmed since the early 90 ths and today, the total production is 3000, 2300 and 700 tonnes/year in Iceland, Sweden and Norway, respectively. Both in Sweden and Iceland, there are selective breeding programs in effect and {{the bulk of the}} farming production is conducted using offspring from the national breeding programs in each country. A. <b>charr</b> is renowned for its ability of high growth rate at low temperature and is therefore especially suitable for farming at high latitudes and altitudes. Moreover, due {{to the success of the}} breeding programs, the <b>charr</b> used in farms today grow faster and mature at a larger size and age than the original wild <b>charr.</b> Hence, although being a fairly small industry at present, A. <b>charr</b> farming is predicted to grow in all three countries. This booklet summarises up-to-date knowledge on A. <b>charr</b> farming production cycle, from brood stock to juvenile on-growing stage (Fig. 1). It is intended to be useful for people taking their first steps in A. <b>charr</b> culture but also to serve as a farming manual for more experienced farm staff. Therefore, the booklet is divided in to two chapters. The first chapter (Arctic <b>charr</b> farming in practice) provides a straight forward introduction to each production step from brood stock to juveniles.

40|$|Size-selective {{mortality}} {{caused by}} fishing can impose strong selection on harvested fish populations, causing evolution in important life-history traits. Understanding and predicting harvest-induced evolutionary change can help maintain sustainable fisheries. We investigate the evolutionary sustainability of alternative management regimes for lacustrine brook <b>charr</b> (Salvelinus fontinalis) fisheries in southern Canada and aim to optimize these regimes {{with respect to}} the competing objectives of maximizing mean annual yield and minimizing evolutionary change in maturation schedules. Using a stochastic simulation model of brook <b>charr</b> populations consuming a dynamic resource, we investigate how harvesting affects brook <b>charr</b> maturation schedules. We show that when approximately 5 % to 15 % of the brook <b>charr</b> biomass is harvested, yields are high, and harvest- induced evolutionary changes remain small. Intensive harvesting (at approximately > 15 % of brook <b>charr</b> biomass) results in high average yields and little evolutionary change only when harvesting is restricted to brook <b>charr</b> larger than the size at 50 % maturation probability at the age of 2 years. Otherwise, intensive harvesting lowers average yield and causes evolutionary change in the maturation schedule of brook <b>charr.</b> Our results indicate that intermediate harvesting efforts offer a acceptable compromise between avoiding harvest-induced evolutionary change and securing high average yields...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This {{comparative}} study explores how low temperatures affect the mortality {{and growth of}} first generation hatchery-reared progeny of subarctic populations of Arctic <b>charr</b> (Salvelinus alpinus L.) and European whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus L.). Replicate fish groups where held under simulated natural light regimes (70 N) at three constant temperatures (1, 3 and 6 C). The mortality of Arctic <b>charr</b> was low (B 1. 4 %) at all temperature treatments, whereas the mortality of whitefish increased with decreasing temperature from 6 % at 6 C to 33 % at 1 C. The Arctic <b>charr</b> exhibited higher growth rates than whitefish at all three temperature regimes. All groups of Arctic <b>charr</b> increased in weight, whereas whitefish held at 1 C did not gain weight throughout the experimental period of 133 days. Arctic <b>charr</b> exhibited a large intraspecific variability in growth leading to large variations in size-structure, whereas whitefish in contrast showed very homogenous growth and size-structure patterns; a dissimilarity probably related to species-specific differences in antagonistic behaviour. Evidently, Arctic <b>charr</b> are more cold water adapted than whitefish {{and are able to}} maintain growth at extremely low temperatures. Arctic <b>charr</b> thus appear to be the most suitable species for aquaculture at low water temperatures...|$|R
40|$|The trophic niches of Arctic <b>charr</b> {{and brown}} trout differ when the species occur in sympatry. Their trophically {{transmitted}} parasit es {{are expected to}} reflect these differences. Here, we investigate how the infections of Diphyllobothrium dendriticum and Diphyllobothrium ditremum differ between <b>charr</b> and trout. These tapeworms use copepods as their first intermediate hos ts and fish can become infected as second intermediate hosts by consuming either infected copepods or infected fish. We examined 767 <b>charr</b> and 368 trout for Diphyllobothrium plerocercoids in a subarctic lake. The prevalence of D. ditremum was higher in <b>charr</b> (61. 5 %) than in trout, (39. 5 %), but the prevalence of D. dendriticum was higher in trout (31. 2 %) than in <b>charr</b> (19. 3 %). Diphyllobothrium spp. intensities were elevated in trout compared to <b>charr,</b> particularly for D. dendriticum. Large fish with massive parasite bur dens {{were responsible for the}} high Diphyllobothrium spp. loads in trout. We hypothesize that fish prey {{may be the most important}} source for the Diphyllobothrium spp. infection s in trout, whereas <b>charr</b> predominantly acquire Diphyllobothrium spp. by feeding on copepods. Our findings support previous suggestions, that the ability to establish in a second piscine host is greater for D. dendriticum than for D. ditremum...|$|R

The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the effects of toxaphene exposure on Arctic <b>charr</b> growth, nutritional quality, physiology, and susceptibility to infections of D. dendriticum. A preliminary experiment found no effect of toxaphene on <b>charr</b> visceral organ and fat weights, plasma Vitamin A and E and plasma cortisol, although dominance hierarchies within groups may have masked treatment effects. For the main experiment, hatchery-reared Arctic <b>charr</b> were subjected to one of four treatments: (i) a single oral dose of corn oil (control); (ii) a single oral dose of 10 mug/g wet weight toxaphene dissolved in corn oil; (iii) exposure to 15 larval D. dendriticum; and (iv) a combination of both.

40|$|Brook <b>charr,</b> Salvelinus fontinafis, shifts its diet from zoobenthos to pelagic prey when living sympatrically {{with white}} sucker, Catostomus commersoni, in lakes of the Laurentian Shield. We tested the {{hypothesis}} that this diet difference {{would have a significant}} impact on their pyloric caecal morphology in 5 lakes containing allopatric brook <b>charr</b> populations and 6 other lakes containing both brook <b>charr</b> and white sucker. We observed that the mean length of the most posterior caecum of <b>charr</b> was significantly greater in sympatry than in allopatry (8 f 1 SD: 9. 91 + 1. 12 mm versus 8. 44 f 0. 67 mm).

40|$|Abstract Background Salmonids are {{regarded}} as 4 R derivative species, having experienced 4 whole genome duplication events in their ancestry. Many duplicated chromosome regions still share extensive homology with one another which is maintained primarily through male-based homeologous chromosome pairings during meiosis. The formation of quadrivalents during meiosis leads to pseudolinkage. This phenomenon is more prevalent within 5 of the 12 ancestral teleost linkage groups in salmonids. Results We constructed a genetic linkage map for brook <b>charr</b> and used this {{in combination with the}} genetic map from Arctic <b>charr,</b> to make comparisons with the genetic map of rainbow trout. Although not all chromosome arms are currently mapped, some homologous chromosome rearrangements were evident between Arctic <b>charr</b> and brook <b>charr.</b> Notably, 10 chromosome arms in brook <b>charr</b> representing 5 metacentric chromosomes in Arctic <b>charr</b> have undergone rearrangements. Three metacentrics have one arm translocated and fused with another chromosome arm in brook <b>charr</b> to a make a new metacentrics while two metacentrics are represented by 4 acrocentric pairs in brook <b>charr.</b> In two cases (i. e., BC- 4 and BC- 16), an apparent polymorphism was observed with the identification of both a putative metacentric structure (similar to metacentric AC- 4 = BC- 4 and a joining of acrocentric AC- 16 + one arm of AC- 28 = BC- 16), as well as two separate acrocentric linkage groups evident in the mapping parents. Forty-six of the expected 50 karyotypic arms could be inter-generically assigned. SEX in brook <b>charr</b> (BC- 4) was localized to the same homologous linkage group region as in Arctic <b>charr</b> (AC- 4). The homeologous affinities detected in the two <b>charr</b> species facilitated the identification of 20 (expected number = 25) shared syntenic regions with rainbow trout, although it is likely that some of these regions were partial or overlapping arm regions. Conclusions Inter-generic comparisons among 2 species of <b>charr</b> (genus Salvelinus) and a trout (genus Oncorhynchus) have identified that linkage group arm arrangements are largely retained among these species. Previous studies have revealed that up to 7 regions of high duplicate marker retention occur between Salmo species (i. e., Atlantic salmon and brown trout) and rainbow trout, with 5 of these regions exhibiting higher levels of pseudolinkage. Pseudolinkage was detected in the <b>charr</b> species (i. e., BC- 1 / 21, AC- 12 / 27, AC- 6 / 23, = RT- 2 p/ 29 q, RT- 12 p/ 16 p, and RT- 27 p/ 31 p, respectively) consistent with three of the five 'salmonid-specific' pseudolinkage regions. Chromosome arms with the highest number of duplicated markers in rainbow trout are the linkage group arms with the highest retention of duplicated markers in both <b>charr</b> species. </p...|$|R
40|$|<b>Charr</b> (Salvelinus spp.) {{exhibit a}} variety of {{migration}} strategies, whereby some individuals venture to sea (anadromous) while others spend the entirety {{of their lives in}} freshwater (residents). The anadromous individuals are of particular interest as their behaviours may shape life history and affect population dynamics through increased exposure to fishery exploitation. Here, I explore the migratory behaviour at sea of brook <b>charr</b> (S. fontinalis) from two distinct populations in Gros Morne National Park (GMNP), Newfoundland; one where the river enters a protected fjord and the other, open ocean. An interdisciplinary approach is used, integrating acoustic telemetry, otolith microchemistry, and fishermen surveys to quantify and contrast migratory behaviours, and to characterize the recreational fishery. Acoustic telemetry of 17 brook <b>charr</b> from one population (in the Bonne Bay fjord), and otolith microchemistry from two populations (Bonne Bay fjord, where N= 23, and Western Brook, where N= 82) show age and habitat specific movements of brook <b>charr.</b> Brook <b>charr</b> make their first seaward migration at age 2 +, often with previous movements to brackish environment between ages 1 - 2. At sea, <b>charr</b> frequent areas close to river mouths during {{the beginning and end of}} migratory period, venturing further away during the mid period of their marine residency. Results indicate that estuarine habitat may be important to anadromous individuals. After first seaward migration at 2 +, there was no significant age-specific pattern for subsequent migrations. Fishermen surveys from two <b>charr</b> fisheries in western Newfoundland (the brook <b>charr</b> fishery of GMNP, and the Arctic <b>charr</b> [S. alpinus]) fishery of Pistolet Bay) provided some evidence that sea-run <b>charr</b> are at increased risk of fisheries interactions. Surveys revealed the usefulness of fishermen’s knowledge to managers, especially to rural communities where local fishermen are the primary resource user and have historical knowledge of the fishery. In both cases, fishermen identified decreases in stock health, but where fishermen were more engaged, in Pistolet Bay, resource users supported increased management efforts to improve stock health. By comparing the GMNP fishery with the Pistolet Bay fishery, I emphasized the effectiveness of fishermen engagement in management regimes and highlight opportunities for comanagement in recreational fisheries to protect stock health where necessary. My results provide insight into the complexity of migratory strategies exhibited by <b>charr</b> species and the opportunities in management of <b>charr</b> recreational fisheries...|$|R
40|$|Species and populations with {{parallel}} evolution of specific traits can help illuminate how predictable adaptations and divergence {{are at the}} molecular and developmental level. Following the last glacial period, dwarfism and specialized bottom feeding morphology evolved rapidly in several landlocked Arctic <b>charr</b> Salvelinus alpinus populations in Iceland.   To study the genetic divergence between small benthic morphs and limnetic morphs, we conducted RNA-sequencing <b>charr</b> embryos at four stages in early development. We studied two stocks with contrasting morphologies: the small benthic (SB) <b>charr</b> from Lake Thingvallavatn and Holar aquaculture (AC) <b>charr.</b> The data reveal significant differences in expression of several biological pathways during <b>charr</b> development. There was also an expression difference between SB- and AC-charr in genes involved in energy metabolism and blood coagulation genes. We confirmed differing expression of five genes in whole embryos with qPCR, including lysozyme and natterin-like which was previously identified as a fish-toxin of a lectin family {{that may be a}} putative immunopeptide.  We also verified differential expression of 7 genes in the developing head that associated consistently with benthic v. s. limnetic morphology (studied in 4 morphs). Comparison of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) frequencies reveals extensive genetic differentiation between the SB and AC-charr (~ 1300 with more than 50 % frequency difference). Curiously, three derived alleles in the otherwise conserved 12 s and 16 s mitochondrial ribosomal RNA genes are found in benthic <b>charr.</b> The data implicate multiple genes and molecular pathways in divergence of small benthic <b>charr</b> and/or the response of aquaculture <b>charr</b> to domestication.
