To avoid this, parts of the antibody can be replaced with human amino acid sequences, or pure human antibodies can be engineered. If the constant region is replaced with the human form, the antibody is termed chimeric and the substem used was -xi-. Part of the variable regions may also be substituted, in which case it is called humanized and -zu- was used; typically, everything is replaced except the complementarity determining regions (CDRs), the three loops of amino acid sequences at the outside of each variable region that bind to the target structure, although some other residues may have to remain non-human {{in order to achieve}} good binding. Partly chimeric and partly humanized antibodies used -xizu-. These three substems did not indicate the foreign species used for production.

40|$|While {{monoclonal}} antibodies show {{promise for}} use in the treatment of a variety of disease states, including cancer, autoimmune disease, and allograft rejection, generation of anti-antibody responses still remains a problem. For example, 50 % of the patients who receive OKT 3 produce blocking antibodies that interfere with its binding to T cells, thus decreasing the therapeutic effect (51). HAMA responses have also interfered with tumor imaging (39, 40) and radioimmunotherapy (56). The generation of an anti-antibody response is dependent on many factors. These include the dose of antibody, the number of injections of antibody, the immunogenicity of the antibody, the form of the antibody, and the immunocompetence of the recipient. Predictably, both the number of injections of antibody and the dosage are influential in the generation of an anti-antibody response. It is apparent that human <b>antibodies,</b> <b>chimeric</b> <b>antibodies,</b> and mouse Fab fragments are much less likely to induce anti-antibody responses than intact mouse monoclonal antibodies or mouse F(ab') 2 fragments when one injection is administered. Injections of human or <b>chimeric</b> <b>antibodies</b> appears to reduce immunogenicity, but the probability that anti-antibody responses can still be induced on multiple injections must be considered and appropriately evaluated. Several areas demand extensive investigation to enhance the clinical utility of monoclonal antibodies. First, results of thorough clinical trials with human or <b>chimeric</b> <b>antibodies</b> need to be evaluated for the induction of anti-antibodies after multiple injections of antibodies. Second, less immunogenic forms of antibodies (Fab, Fv) need to be studied for their clinical efficacies and for their abilities to induce anti-antibody responses...|$|R

40|$|Background Ferrets {{have long}} {{been used as a}} disease model for the study of {{influenza}} vaccines, but a more recent use has been for the study of human monoclonal antibodies directed against influenza viruses. Published data suggest that human antibodies are cleared unusually quickly from the ferret and that immune responses may be partially responsible. This immunogenicity increases variability within groups and may present an obstacle to long-term studies. Objective Our aim was to identify an antibody design with reduced immunogenicity and longer circulating half-life in ferrets. Methods The constant region coding sequences for ferret immunoglobulin G were cloned, and <b>chimeric</b> human/ferret <b>antibodies</b> were expressed and purified. Some of the <b>chimeric</b> <b>antibodies</b> included substitutions that have been shown to extend the half-life of human IgG <b>antibodies.</b> These <b>chimeric</b> <b>antibodies</b> were tested for binding to recombinant ferret FcRn receptor and then evaluated in pharmacokinetic studies in ferrets. Results A one-residue substitution in the ferret Fc domain, S 252 Y, was identified that increased binding affinity to the ferret neonatal receptor by 24 -fold and extended half-life from 65 27 to 206 28 hours or ~ 9 days. Ferrets dosed twice with this surrogate antibody showed no indications of an immune response. Conclusion Expressing the variable region of a candidate human therapeutic antibody with ferret constant regions containing the S 252 Y substitution can offer long half-life and limit immunogenicity...|$|R

A detailed comparison of the properties of the human Ig classes and subclasses is not only of interest for relating the functions of antibodies to their structures but is also of great importance for the implementation of therapy based upon immunological intervention. Indeed, this second aspect has become particularly significant as the development of techniques for the production of <b>chimeric</b> <b>antibodies</b> (1 - 3) should ensure that immunological intervention is now likely to make use of mAbs that have human effector functions; several cell lines have already been established that secrete <b>chimeric</b> <b>antibodies</b> directed against human cancer cells (4 - 6).
