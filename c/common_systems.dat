The three most <b>common</b> <b>systems</b> are the FDI World Dental Federation notation, the universal numbering system, and Palmer notation method.

25|$|Railway {{electrification}} in Great Britain began {{during the}} late 19th century. A range of voltages has been used, employing both overhead lines and conductor rails; the two most <b>common</b> <b>systems</b> are 25 kV AC using overhead lines and the 750VDC third rail system used in southeast England and on Merseyrail. In 2006, 40%— of the British rail network was electrified, and 60% of all rail journeys were by electric traction (both by locomotives and multiple units).|$|E
25|$|Stadtbahn, {{literally}} city railway in the German language, is {{the term}} for light rail in Germany and is the predecessor of the North American light rail. Most German light rail systems were started in the 1960s and 1970s {{with the intention of}} establishing full-scale underground/subway structures, or U-Bahn (short for Untergrundbahn) systems. By the 1980s virtually all cities had abandoned these plans due to the high costs of converting tramways, and the most <b>common</b> <b>systems</b> now are a mixture of tramway-like operations in suburban areas, and a U-Bahn like mode of operation, featuring underground stations, in the city centres.|$|E

25|$|Improvements in {{computing}} technology keep {{increasing the}} rate at which guessed passwords can be tested. For example, in 2010, the Georgia Tech Research Institute developed a method of using GPGPU to crack passwords much faster. Elcomsoft invented the usage of common graphic cards for quicker password recovery in August 2007 and soon filed a corresponding patent in the US. As of 2011, commercial products are available that claim the ability to test up to 112,000 passwords per second on a standard desktop computer using a high-end graphics processor. Such a device will crack a 6 letter single-case password in one day. Note that the work can be distributed over many computers for an additional speedup proportional to the number of available computers with comparable GPUs. Special key stretching hashes are available that take a relatively long time to compute, reducing {{the rate at}} which guessing can take place. Although it is considered best practice to use key stretching, many <b>common</b> <b>systems</b> do not.|$|E

40|$|The {{value added}} tax has been adapted by various legal {{instruments}} of the European community (regulations, directives, decisions etc.) {{which are used}} to harmonise this tax. Together these documents establish "the <b>common</b> <b>system</b> of VAT". The time definition of this system is not simple, because of newly ratified legal instruments that are reacting to both Community requirements and the current economical situation. At the present time, combating tax evasion is the fastest developing part of the <b>common</b> <b>system.</b> Tax evasion is significantly reducing revenues of the whole Community by reducing the revenues of single member states. Even if the European Union always places emphasis on the equal conditions for all member states {{in all areas of}} interest including claiming VAT, there are some exceptions from the <b>common</b> <b>system</b> granted for member states. The main objective of these exceptions is to take into consideration the specific conditions in each member country through special instruments added to the <b>common</b> VAT <b>system.</b> These exceptions should simplify the acceptance of the <b>common</b> <b>system</b> by all member states...|$|R
