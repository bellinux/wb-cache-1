40|$|In {{recent years}} {{electric}} mobility {{has gained a}} great deal of attention, leading to electric vehicles on the market and development of necessary charging infrastructure. Charging infrastructure is mostly enabled through subsidies by local or national governments to overcome the chicken and egg problem, while the business <b>case</b> <b>for</b> <b>charge</b> stations in this early stage of development is not yet sufficient. The municipality of Amsterdam is a forerunner in the development of charge infrastructure, with over 500 public charge points available. The municipality and service providers struggle how to optimize the roll out of further charge points and how to optimize the use of the charge points. This paper gives a detailed analysis of the actual usage patterns of the public charging infrastructure in the city of Amsterdam, based on more than 109. 000 charge sessions collected at the existing local charge points in 2012 / 2013. The conclusions from this analysis can be used to gain insight in the actual usage patterns of public charging infrastructure and may lead to recommendations concerning further roll out of charge stations, increasing effectiveness and improving the business <b>case</b> <b>for</b> <b>charge</b> points. The conclusions and recommendations may have implications for, and may support municipalities in the effective development of charging infrastructure...|$|R

5000|$|Unlike most tank weapons which fire {{a single}} fixed round, the {{projectile}} and propellant are loaded separately. The propellant {{is in the}} form of a combustible [...] "bag" [...] charge (or later, a <b>combustible</b> <b>charge</b> <b>case</b> <b>for</b> armour-piercing rounds). This required the obturation to be provided by the breech rather than the cartridge case, as is the case in fixed rounds. When first introduced, APDS (armour-piercing discarding sabot) rounds were fired using a cylindrical charge. High explosive squash head (HESH), smoke and other rounds used a hemi-cylindrical (i.e. a cylinder sliced in two lengthways) charge (the L3). Two HE charges could therefore be stowed in the same space as one AP charge. In the Chieftain and Challenger tanks, the charges were stored in 36 recesses surrounded by water jackets, so that a hit which penetrated the fighting compartment would rupture the jacket and drench the propellant, preventing a catastrophic ammunition fire (known colloquially as a [...] "brew-up").|$|R

40|$|International audienceElectric vehicle {{charging}} stations (EVCS) {{come along with}} great challenges for the power grid due to their highly uncertain load characteristic. This is particularly the <b>case</b> <b>for</b> <b>charging</b> stations located in non-residential areas such as commercial centers, company sites or car-rental stations. For a safe and sustainable operation of the power grid, distribution system operators (DSO) require reliable load forecasts of such charging stations. In this paper a robust EVCS management strategy is proposed which provides a day-ahead upper limit profile of the EVCS’s power consumption. In real-time this upper limit profile is strictly respected while guaranteeing – at a configurable probability – the QoS (Quality of Service). The strategy is based on randomized algorithms and relies on a statistic occupancy model of the EVCS while not requiring any online forecasts of each EVs’ arrival- and departure schedules. In a case-study based on statistic data which has been provided by the Euref Campus in Berlin, the feasibility and relevance of the proposed approach is demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|The {{spontaneous}} {{appearance of}} nematicity, {{a state of}} matter that breaks rotation but not translation symmetry, {{is one of the}} most intriguing property of the iron based superconductors (Fe SC), and has relevance for the cuprates as well. Establishing the critical electronic modes behind nematicity remains however a challenge, because their associated susceptibilities are not easily accessible by conventional probes. Here using FeSe as a model system, and symmetry resolved electronic Raman scattering as a probe, we unravel the presence of critical charge nematic fluctuations near the structural / nematic transition temperature, T_S∼ 90 K. The diverging behavior of the associated nematic susceptibility foretells the presence of a Pomeranchuk instability of the Fermi surface with d-wave symmetry. The excellent scaling between the observed nematic susceptibility and elastic modulus data demonstrates that the structural distortion is driven by this d-wave Pomeranchuk transition. Our results make a strong <b>case</b> <b>for</b> <b>charge</b> induced nematicity in FeSe. Comment: 5 pages, 5 figures + S...|$|R

40|$|When {{a public}} good is {{excludable}} {{it is possible}} to <b>charge</b> individuals <b>for</b> using the good. We study the role of prices for publicly provided excludable public goods within an extension of the Stern-Stiglitz version of the Mirrlees optimal income tax model. We show that for a public consumer good there is a range of circumstances in which <b>charging</b> a price <b>for</b> the public good decreases welfare. We find that a necessary condition for a positive price to be desirable is that the marginal valuation of the public good is increasing in leisure. However, even under this condition, welfare is initially decreasing in the price, implying that charging a lower than optimal price may be less efficient than setting a zero price. Thus, even when there is a <b>case</b> <b>for</b> <b>charging</b> a price <b>for</b> the public good, an attempt to implement the optimum in practice may be risky, as even setting a modest price to avoid overshooting the optimum may be Pareto inferior to charging no price at all.

Currently the total number of installed charging points keeps growing due to both public and private investments. Often charging services are offered as free service extensions.
