50|$|In the <b>computer</b> <b>generation</b> of a {{pseudorandom}} number sequence, the aim may be {{to generate}} random numbers having a normal distribution: these {{can be obtained from}} standard normal deviates (themselves the output of a pseudorandom number sequence) by multiplying by the scale parameter and adding the location parameter. More generally, the generation of pseudorandom number sequence having other marginal distributions may involve manipulating sequences of standard normal deviates: an example here is the chi-squared distribution, random values of which can be obtained by adding the squares of standard normal deviates (although this would seldom be the fastest method of generating such values).|$|E

50|$|VFDA {{is based}} on the unique aspect of every piece being created by the artist. Materials used to {{emphasize}} the projections include wooden palates measured to the frame, various forms of corkboard, balsa wood and other materials that are hand-cut or machined by the artist to help raise the projections to the level desired. The use of preformed shapes, three-dimensional printing and advanced <b>computer</b> <b>generation</b> of any kind used to map the work or create the projections is not considered {{to be part of this}} art form because the work can be saved, duplicated and even mass-produced.|$|E
50|$|While {{the exact}} origins of VFDA are unknown, the first artwork of its nature {{began to appear}} around 2010 in the street art of various cities in Europe, {{including}} Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam. This {{appears to have been}} a response to the expanding use of <b>computer</b> <b>generation</b> in art to both design and create mixed-media collage works that could be essentially pre-designed and mass-produced. Since that time, various artists have produced series of works-known as ensembles—that are individually unique and limited in scope. Common themes of these ensembles range widely from ideological ideas like bohemianism, libertine and socially relevant matters to historical perspective, such as the interpretation of various time periods and eras.|$|E
50|$|Intec {{was started}} in the UK in 1997 to sell {{interconnect}} billing systems. From this point the company expanded both organically and through acquisition. Intec became a public company in 2000, following its IPO on the London Stock Exchange. The following year it completed its first acquisition, with the purchase of <b>Computer</b> <b>Generation</b> Inc (CGI) and Dataphone UK Ltd. In 2002 Intec further consolidated the interconnect billing market with acquisitions from ICL and Ericsson. In 2003 Intec entered the IP services mediation and charging market with the acquisition of Digiquant (the assets of which were subsequently sold to Volubill). The Digiquant acquisition was followed in 2004 with the acquisition of the Singl.eView product line from ADC. In 2006 Intec acquired EUR systems, a USA based provider of bureau services, which has been integrated with Intec’s other managed services and outsourcing facilities.|$|E

The Third Reich and a world war had intervened, {{and after the war}} musical tastes changed also. Though he worked tirelessly, his later songs could not attain the popularity of his earlier [...] "evergreens". During these years, as he had in America, he worked on the serious side of his lifelong writings, creating a long near-epic poem about his wanderings entitled The Organ-Grinder's Odyssey, which some critics, like Hannah Arendt, considered his best work. Toward the poem's end the narrator describes the Berlin he had returned to in 1949: bombed-out buildings still covered with ashes and dust, bleak in winter's cold, the actual city not unlike the one he had envisioned in New York City in 1940. Gilbert's Odyssey ends with an account of the returning dynamism of Germany's Economic Miracle with its author painfully aware that the rising <b>computer</b> <b>generation</b> was leaving him and his peers behind.|$|E
5000|$|Another area of {{innovation}} for Tony Jr. {{has been the}} pick imprinting processes. From the very beginning, simple hot stamping {{had been used to}} identify the picks, first with a D'Andrea logo and then simple block letter dies for a player name. These were originally imprinted in one shot, foot pedal operated machines. One of the first to make the player imprint popular was Nick Lucas. In the 1930s, using the old round top #351 pick Luigi developed for him, each pick was imprinted with his logo and sold as a [...] "Nick Lucas" [...] pick. The 1950s saw the advent of mass-producing private labeled picks for guitar companies, requiring sophisticated automated printing and packaging. The 1960s was the heyday of rock and every player and store wanted their pick personalized. Tony developed some of the fastest multi-shot equipment for punching, imprinting and bagging. In the 1990s he revolutionized the imprint process with the introduction of pad printing. It overcame some of the speed and design limitations of hot stamping. Now very intricate logos can be produced by <b>computer</b> <b>generation</b> and they can be multicolored. By 1996, even a photograph could be imprinted on a pick! ...|$|E
