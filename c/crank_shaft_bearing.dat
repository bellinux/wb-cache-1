40|$|Improving engine {{warm up time}} is {{of great}} {{interest}} because cold start engines suffer from increased fuel consumption. This study comprises of two phases: the first looking at global benefits from a novel engine cooling system incorporating coolant flow control valves and dual EGR setup. The new cooling system showed promising signs of influencing energy flows during warm up, however only limited analysis was possible. The second phase used an instrumented engine to show new ways of quantifying performance enhancements through combustion chamber heat transfer, local bearing oil film temperatures and bearing heat transfer. 1 dimensional heat transfer analysis demonstrated the significant energy required to warm up the engine structure and 25 - 50 kJ heat loss per main <b>crank</b> <b>shaft</b> <b>bearing...</b>|$|E

40|$|The most {{important}} design parameters for hermetically sealed compressors used in domestic refrigerators are the Coefficient of Performance (COP); low manufacturing and operating costs; long operating life, low {{noise and vibration}} levels and to achieve environmentally friendly constructions. Positive displacement piston type compressors are used in refrigerators today due to their high capacity/volume ratios. Hence, the bearings of the hermetic compressors must also satisfy these design conditions. Investigation and optimization of <b>crank</b> <b>shaft</b> <b>bearings</b> in hermetic compressor applications are the main objectives of this study. The effect of <b>crank</b> <b>shaft</b> geometry, <b>bearing</b> clearance, lubricant viscosity, surface roughness and bearing location along the shaft on the friction losses were investigated and the new journal bearing designs were developed. Detailed parametric numerical simulations were performed using commercial software. According {{to the results of}} the simulations number of compressors were assembled with the selected design parameters and performance measurements were carried out. The results of the numerical analysis have shown that the numerically calculated mechanical loss level is similar to the performance results measured in a calorimeter test system. Results of the simulations and experiments were evaluated with six sigma (6 ?) techniques. Measurement of the efficiency of the compressor with the improved bearing design showed 1. 3 % increase in the coefficient of performance (COP) with respect to the compressor with previous bearing design. This study shows that the mechanical loss characteristics are significantly influenced by the length of the bearings, clearance between the crankshaft journal and its bearing, kinematic viscosity and operating conditions. Bearing analysis results help to characterize the optimum journal bearing parameters which lead to improved mechanical efficiency of the compressor...|$|R
5000|$|On May 1, 2002, Camilla {{was laid}} {{up in the}} port of Mariehamn, Finland. According to the Finnish {{investigation}} report, maintenance work on the ship {{was intended to be}} carried out during the lay-up, but did not actually take place. On Dec 31st, 2002 the ship departed Mariehamn for Canada in ballast for a cargo of paper. During the sailing, it was noticed that the ship's fuel had been contaminated with water, requiring a transition to burning light oil, and that engine lubrication oil required continuous filtering. The exhaust valves of the main engine also saw attention many times during the trip. After loading her cargo in Dalhousie, New Brunswick, Canada, the ship left for England on Jan 19th, 2003. On Jan 23rd 05.40z the main engine stopped at sea, causing a black out. The engine failed with alarms and was restarted several times each time with some increasingly worrying signs of disrepair. At 09.36z it was discovered that one of the <b>crank</b> <b>shaft</b> <b>bearings</b> was overheating with mechanical noise emerging from several of the cylinders. At 10.45z the engine was declared inoperative. The engineers initially set out to repair the engine, but the master's decision at 13.48z that the ship would be evacuated halted the work. A hurricane was closing in, the repairs would take up to 36 hours, and even in the best case the ship's propulsion would be limited. The ship was then at 46° 54,7’ N, 46° 50,9’ W, and rolling 30-40 degrees. The crew ate dinner, closed all the hatches and valves and prepared to leave the ship. The ship's Stork-Werkspoor engine type was deemed in the Finnish investigation report to be very sensitive to the quality of its lubrication oil owing to a design feature, and the type had also received a general design revision to the crank rod bearings and the connecting rods. The engine type was also known to collect sticky oily residue in the general crankshaft area even when carefully maintained. The engine on board the [...] "Camilla" [...] had both unrevised and revised parts installed, but the parts to fail were all of the unrevised design. The investigation board concluded that the most probable cause for the engine break down was imperfect lubrication of the main engine. The imperfect lubrication was a result of several factors, as detailed in the full report.|$|R
40|$|International audienceGaseous {{nitriding}} is {{a well-established}} thermochemical treatment of carbon iron-based alloys that considerably enhances corrosion, wear and fatigue resistances of critical mechanical parts such as <b>crank</b> <b>shafts</b> and <b>bearings.</b> It {{is based on}} the diffusion of nitrogen atoms from the catalytic decomposition of ammonia at the outer surface. The process has generally been relying on the fast development of a compound layer that mainly serves as a nitrogen reserve during the treatment. The growth of the compound layer directly depends on the adsorption of nitrogen atoms at the surface of treated parts. Any barriers to the nitrogen adsorption may induce detrimental kinetics of nitriding, and so a lack of mechanical properties. So-called surface preparations prior to nitriding thus fundamentally assist with (i) nitriding of superior quality (i. e. with the required properties such as the effective depth and mechanical properties), (ii) uniform nitriding of the whole treated part (i. e. no mechanical heterogeneities induced by the process) and (iii) repeatable nitriding from batch to batch. The present work deals with three in-situ surface activation solutions prior to nitriding that are oxidation, urea and ammonium chloride. Pre-treatments are compared based on their efficiency on uncleaned samples, defined by different degrees of residues of water dissolved machining oil, to be nitrided. The first few hours of nitriding are reported on a 3 wt. %Cr carbon iron-base alloy...|$|R
