40|$|An {{ion engine}} {{subsystem}} intended for satellite stationkeeping tasks is described. Ion thrusters are chosen {{to perform the}} task because the specific impulse is at least {{an order of magnitude}} higher than the commonly used reaction control jets. The higher the value of specific impulse, the greater the total impulse that can be attained for a given weight of propellant, hence cost benefits result. The integration, subsystem testing, and the operating plans for the ion engine experiment to be flown in 1975 on the <b>Canadian</b> <b>Communications</b> <b>Technology</b> <b>Satellite</b> (CTS) are described. The subsystem is designed to demonstrate north-south stationkeeping, attitude control by means of thrust vectoring, long-term space storage and restart capability, and compatibility with a high powered communications transponder...|$|E
