5|$|For years, Europeans in Africa {{had heard}} of an animal that they <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> the 'African unicorn'. In his travelogue of {{exploring}} the Congo, Henry Morton Stanley mentioned a kind of donkey that the natives called the atti, which scholars later identified as the okapi. Explorers may have seen the fleeting view of the striped backside as the animal fled through the bushes, leading to speculation that the okapi {{was some sort of}} rainforest zebra.|$|E

The Spanish flu also spread through Ireland, carried there by returning Irish soldiers. The Allies of World War I <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> it the Spanish flu, primarily because the pandemic received greater press attention after it moved from France to Spain in November 1918. Spain {{was not involved in}} the war and had not imposed wartime censorship.|$|E

5|$|The castle {{was built}} between 1220 and 1223, during {{the rule of}} the Prince of Achaea Geoffrey I of Villehardouin, {{as a result of a}} dispute between the Prince and the clergy of the Principality. Geoffrey had asked the clergy, which owned almost a third of the Principality's lands but was not obliged to render {{military}} service, for additional donations to help defend the realm. When the clergy refused, claiming that they owed allegiance only to the Pope, Geoffrey confiscated Church property, and began construction of Chlemoutsi with the new funds. The fortress was set on a new foundation, with no previous structure identifiable on this site. Its French name, Clairmont or Clermont, most probably gave rise to the Greek form of Chlomoutsi, which more recently became Chlemoutsi, although various theories have been proposed as to the name's origin, with suggestions of Greek, Albanian or Slavic roots pre-dating the Frankish fortress. From the 15th century, Italian sources <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> it Castel Tornese, apparently through a confusion with the seat of the Principality's mint in nearby Glarentza, which until the middle of the 14th century minted silver tornese coins.|$|E

25|$|A large {{influx of}} foreigners of many {{religions}} came to 17th-century Amsterdam, in particular Sefardic Jews from Spain and Portugal, Huguenots from France, and Protestants from the Southern Netherlands. This {{led to the}} establishment of many non-Dutch-speaking religious churches. In 1603, the first notification was made of Jewish religious service. In 1639, the first synagogue was consecrated. The Jews <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> the town Jerusalem of the West, a reference to their sense of belonging there.|$|E

25|$|Following the Brundtland Commission's report, one of {{the first}} {{initiatives}} to bring scientific principles to the assessment of sustainability was by Swedish cancer scientist Karl-Henrik Robèrt. Robèrt coordinated a consensus process to define and operationalize sustainability. At the core of the process lies a consensus on what Robèrt <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> the natural step framework. The framework is based on a definition of sustainability, described as the system conditions of sustainability (as derived from System theory). In the natural step framework, a sustainable society does not systematically increase concentrations of substances extracted from the Earth's crust, or substances produced by society; that does not degrade the environment and in which people have the capacity to meet their needs worldwide.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, {{after being}} accused of assaulting his former wife Petra Mollath, Gustl Mollath was tried at the District Court of Nürnberg-Fürth for aggravated assault and {{wrongful}} deprivation of personal liberty of his ex-wife as well as damage to property. The court considered the charges proven but acquitted Mollath {{on the basis of}} finding him criminally insane. A pivotal argument for Mollath's insanity, besides the general impression he made, was that he insisted his wife was involved in a complex system of tax evasion; the court <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> it a paranoid belief system Mollath had developed, which led him to accuse many people of being part of a conspiracy and act irrationally and aggressively, namely puncturing car tires of people in a way that could lead to accidents.|$|E
25|$|The first Filipino {{known by}} name in Texas was Francisco Flores, {{who came to}} Texas by way of Cuba {{in the nineteenth century}} began to reside in Port Isabel and would later call Rockport home. Following the {{annexation}} of the Philippines, Filipinos began to migrate to Texas due primarily as employees of American officers who served in the Philippines, with many settling around San Antonio; others would resettle in Texas after initially residing elsewhere in the United States. In 1910, there were six Filipinos living in Texas, by 1920 this number increased to 30, and by 1930, the Filipino population continued to grow to 288. With the disbandment of the Philippine Scouts, many who remained in the military <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> Fort Sam Houston home, along with Filipina War brides. After World War II, many Filipino professionals began to immigrate to Texas, with 2,000 Filipino nurses calling Houston home. In 1950, about 4,000 Filipino Americans were in Texas, with their number increasing to 75,226 by 2000.|$|E

500|$|Poulenc {{made his}} début as a {{composer}} in 1917 with his Rapsodie nègre, a ten-minute, five-movement piece for baritone and chamber group; it {{was dedicated to}} Satie and premiered at {{one of a series}} of concerts of new music run by the singer Jane Bathori. There was a fashion for African arts in Paris at the time, and Poulenc was delighted to run across some published verses purportedly Liberian, but full of Parisian boulevard slang. He used one of the poems in two sections of the rhapsody. The baritone engaged for the first performance lost his nerve on the platform, and the composer, though no singer, jumped in. This jeu d'esprit was the first of many examples of what Anglophone critics <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> [...] "leg-Poulenc". Ravel was amused by the piece and commented on Poulenc's ability to invent his own folklore. Stravinsky was impressed enough to use his influence to secure Poulenc a contract with a publisher, a kindness that Poulenc never forgot.|$|E

We thought the Muppets were quintessentially American, and it turns out they're the most international characters ever created". [...] She hired former CBS executive Mike Dann, who left commercial television to become her assistant, as a CTW vice-president.
