40|$|Microcontaminations of <b>copper</b> and <b>silver</b> on n-type {{silicon wafer}} {{surfaces}} were investigated by performing {{a series of}} electrochemical polarization measurements in 5 % hydrofluoric acids and ethanol solutions in the absence and presence of various concentrations of <b>copper</b> and/or <b>silver.</b> The metallically contaminated wafer surfaces were characterized by scanning electron microscopy. It was revealed that the open-circuit potentials shifted to a more anodic direction and the corrosion current densities increased significantly when either <b>copper</b> or <b>silver</b> was present in solutions, and these became more pronounced when both <b>copper</b> and <b>silver</b> were introduced simultaneously into solutions. The polarization resistance showed a sensitive linear decrease with an increase of <b>copper</b> or <b>silver</b> concentrations, a strong indication of an accelerated electrochemical reaction. The contaminated wafer surfaces were covered by metallic nanocrystallites due to <b>copper</b> and <b>silver</b> deposition from solutions. When both <b>copper</b> and <b>silver</b> were present, the nanocrystallites coagulated {{with each other and}} various clusters were formed by combination with metallic atoms. As the concentration of <b>copper</b> and/or <b>silver</b> increased, the amounts of metallic nanocrystallites also increased, this, in turn, further promoted metallic microcontaminations and ultimately led to rougher wafer surfaces.
