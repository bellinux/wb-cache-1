30|$|The use of <b>contracts</b> differs across {{commodities}}. Some commodities use primarily production <b>contracts,</b> {{some use}} marketing <b>contracts</b> {{and others have}} little use of <b>contracts</b> of any type. 1 With the exception of dairy production, for which <b>contracts</b> are mostly marketing <b>contracts,</b> the majority of <b>contracts</b> in livestock production are production <b>contracts.</b> A smaller share of crops are under <b>contract,</b> and most <b>contracts</b> are marketing <b>contracts</b> (O’Donoghue et al. 2011). The use of <b>contracts</b> also varies by farm size; large commercial farms {{are more likely to}} use production and/or marketing <b>contracts</b> and to use <b>contracts</b> for a larger share of their production (MacDonald and Korb 2011; MacDonald et al. 2004).|$|R
50|$|In <b>contract</b> law the <b>contract</b> {{price is}} a {{material}} term. The <b>contract</b> price {{is the price}} for the goods or services to be received in the <b>contract.</b> The <b>contract</b> price helps {{to determine whether a}} <b>contract</b> may exist. If the <b>contract</b> price is not included in the written <b>contract,</b> then upon litigation the court may hold that a <b>contract</b> did not exist.|$|R

5|$|The ICSID {{does not}} conduct {{arbitration}} or conciliation proceedings itself, but offers institutional and procedural support to conciliation commissions, tribunals, and other committees which conduct such matters. The center has {{two sets of}} rules that determine how cases will be initiated and conducted, either under the ICSID's Convention, Regulations and Rules or the ICSID's Additional Facility Rules. To be processed {{in accordance with the}} ICSID Convention, a legal dispute has to exist between one of the center's <b>contracting</b> member states and a national of another <b>contracting</b> member state. It must also be of a legal nature and relate directly to an investment. A case can be processed under the ICSID Additional Facility Rules if one of the parties to the dispute is either not a <b>contracting</b> member state or a national of a <b>contracting</b> member state. However, most cases are arbitrated under the ICSID Convention. Recourse to ICSID conciliation and arbitration is entirely voluntary. However, once the parties have consented to arbitration under the ICSID Convention, neither party can unilaterally withdraw its consent.|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} a composite (CP) <b>contract</b> for a two-stage supply chain by organically combining two component contracts: a buy back (BB) <b>contract</b> and a quantity flexibility (QF) <b>contract.</b> The CP <b>contract</b> {{is shown to}} have advantages over both component <b>contracts</b> in terms of supply chain coordination, profit allocation, and risk allocation. In particular, we obtain the following results: (a) {{as long as one}} of the component <b>contracts</b> is able to coordinate the supply chain, so is the CP <b>contract.</b> Moreover, when <b>contract</b> parameters are constrained, we find situations where the CP <b>contract</b> coordinates the supply chain when neither of the component <b>contracts</b> coordinates. (b) When <b>contract</b> parameters are constrained, the CP <b>contract</b> is more flexible in terms of profit allocation among supply chain members than the component <b>contracts.</b> (c) The CP <b>contract</b> is more flexible in terms of risk allocation than the component <b>contracts.</b> Supply chain management <b>Contract</b> design Coordination Profit allocation Risk allocation...|$|R
50|$|Some <b>contracts,</b> {{known as}} {{executory}} <b>contracts,</b> may be rejected if canceling {{them would be}} financially favorable to {{the company and its}} creditors. Such <b>contracts</b> may include labor union <b>contracts,</b> supply or operating <b>contracts</b> (with both vendors and customers), and real estate leases. The standard feature of executory <b>contracts</b> is that each party to the <b>contract</b> has duties remaining under the <b>contract.</b> In the event of a rejection, the remaining parties to the <b>contract</b> become unsecured creditors of the debtor. For example, in some districts a <b>contract</b> for deed is an executory <b>contract,</b> while in others it is not.|$|R
50|$|A <b>contract</b> can be {{broadly defined}} as an {{agreement}} that is enforceable at law. Gaius classified <b>contracts</b> into four categories which are: <b>contracts</b> consensu, verbal <b>contracts,</b> <b>contracts</b> re, and <b>contracts</b> litteris. But this classification cannot cover all the <b>contracts,</b> such as pacts and innominate contracts; thus, {{it is no longer}} used.|$|R

5|$|Bat {{caregivers}} are {{not only}} specially trained in techniques to rescue and rehabilitate bats, {{but they are also}} vaccinated against rabies.

Pulsating variable stars vary in radius and luminosity over time, expanding and <b>contracting</b> with periods ranging from minutes to years, {{depending on the size}} of the star. This category includes Cepheid and Cepheid-like stars, and long-period variables such as Mira.|$|E

50|$|A {{collateral}} <b>contract</b> {{is usually}} a single term <b>contract,</b> made in consideration of the party for whose benefit the <b>contract</b> operates agreeing {{to enter into the}} principal or main <b>contract,</b> which sets out additional terms relating to the same subject matter as the main <b>contract.</b> The collateral <b>contract</b> co-exists {{side by side with the}} main <b>contract.</b> For example, a collateral <b>contract</b> is formed when one party pays the other party a certain sum for entry into another <b>contract.</b> A collateral <b>contract</b> may be between one of the parties and a third party.|$|R
50|$|The <b>contract</b> of interim {{insurance}} is separate from and {{independent of the}} final <b>contract</b> of insurance following on the conclusion of an interim <b>contract,</b> although it may share some {{or most of the}} terms of the final <b>contract.</b> If a claim arises during the currency of the interim <b>contract,</b> it must be considered in terms of the interim <b>contract</b> itself, not in terms of the final <b>contract.</b> This may be of importance where only the final <b>contract,</b> not the interim <b>contract,</b> is voidable because of a misrepresentation or other unlawful conduct, and also where the terms of the two <b>contracts</b> differ.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} current (conceptual) {{issues in the}} field of <b>contract</b> management.

In our investigation of <b>contract</b> content, we identify core <b>contract</b> objects, usage-specific extension objects and their relationships. On the basis of various usage scenarios for digital <b>contracts,</b> we proceed to introduce an approach for scenario-specific <b>contract</b> composition (Phases 1 and 2 of the <b>contract</b> life cycle) ...|$|R

5|$|On 20 December 2010, {{the mayor}} of Shanghai, Han Zheng, said that the city would crack down on unfair {{practices}} of construction companies and <b>contracting</b> firms. Han said {{that there is little}} regulation of the construction industry and that certain companies have had advantages over other companies when being awarded contracts. On 11 January 2011, Shanghai authorities placed into effect a new set of regulations aimed at better official supervision of construction companies. The city will also require that such companies will not be permitted to have any non-official relationship with local government offices after one year.

50|$|The {{idea of a}} default rule in <b>contract</b> law is {{sometimes}} connected {{to the notion of}} a complete <b>contract.</b> In <b>contract</b> theory, a complete <b>contract</b> fully specifies the rights and duties of the parties to the <b>contract</b> for all possible future states of the world. An incomplete <b>contract,</b> therefore, contains gaps. Most <b>contract</b> theorists find that default rules fill in the gaps in what would otherwise be incomplete <b>contracts.</b> This is often stated pragmatically as whether a court will imply terms so as to save a <b>contract</b> from uncertainty.|$|R
