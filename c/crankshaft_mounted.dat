5000|$|The {{description}} of the orientation of V-twin and flat-twin motorcycle engines sometimes differs from the convention as stated above. Motorcycles with a V-twin engine mounted with its <b>crankshaft</b> <b>mounted</b> {{in line with the}} frame, e.g. the AJS S3 V-twin, Indian 841, Victoria Bergmeister, Honda CX series and several Moto Guzzis since the 1960s, are said to have [...] "transverse" [...] engines, while motorcycles with a V-twin mounted with its <b>crankshaft</b> <b>mounted</b> perpendicular to the frame, e.g. most Ducatis since the 1970s and most Harley-Davidsons, are said to have [...] "longitudinal" [...] engines. This convention uses the longest horizontal dimension (length or width) of the engine as its axis instead of the line of the crankshaft.|$|E
50|$|A {{disadvantage}} of this layout {{is that it}} exposes the cylinders and valve covers to the danger of collision damage. Longitudinal <b>crankshaft</b> <b>mounting</b> is also associated with a torque reaction that tends to twist the motorcycle to one side on sharp acceleration or when opening the throttle in neutral and {{in the opposite direction}} on sharp deceleration. Many modern motorcycle manufacturers correct for this effect by rotating flywheels or alternators in the opposite direction to that of the crankshaft.|$|R
50|$|The {{longitudinal}} crankshaft two-cylinder V as seen on Moto-Guzzis {{and some}} Hondas is less common. This orientation is suited to shaft drive, {{eliminating the need}} for a 90° bevel gear at the transmission end of the shaft.

50|$|Christian von Koenigsegg {{invented the}} Koenigsegg Direct Drive System (KDD) {{and it was}} {{developed}} for the Regera by the Koenigsegg Advanced Engineering Team. The KDD system effectively {{eliminates the need for}} a transmission and allows for pure EV (electric vehicle) mode. The Regera doesn't have a traditional multi-gear transmission but instead features a single-speed fixed-gear transmission, often called a direct drive, with a 2.73:1 reduction ratio, meaning the <b>crankshaft</b> <b>mounted</b> on the ICE will rotate 2.73 times for every 1 time that the output shaft of the direct drive mechanism will rotate. At speeds below 30 mph, mostly the wheel shaft electric motors propel the car {{through the use of a}} hydraulic coupling that lets the ICE and the <b>crankshaft</b> <b>mounted</b> electric motor slip. In reverse, only the wheel shaft electric motors propel the car. Above 30 mph, the RPM of the <b>crankshaft</b> <b>mounted</b> electric motor and internal combustion engine are proportional to wheel speed through locking of the hydraulic coupling. However, in the first driving footage from the Regera through Koenigseggs official YouTube channel, Christian von Koenigsegg described and demonstrated how the Regera features a steering wheel mounted paddle that simulates a traditional downshift by initiating slip of the hydraulic coupling connecting the crankshaft to the output shaft. This results in higher RPM of the ICE and the cranskshaft mounted electric motor and therefore higher power at lower speeds than what would have been possible if the coupling would have been locked at all times. Koenigsegg reported that the omission of a gearbox and addition of electric motors and battery only added 88 kg (194 lb) compared to what the Regera would have weighed with the same combustion engine but a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission (DCT) and no electric motors or batteries.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} an experimental procedure for comparing different families of IC Engine lubricating pumps {{in terms of}} total consumed energy in a NEDC driving cycle. Measures are performed on a test rig able to reproduce the oil temperature profile, the lubrication circuit permeability and its variation during the engine warm-up. The pump under test is driven by a variable speed electric motor supplying the engine velocity profile of the driving cycle. The load on the pump is generated {{by means of a}} variable restrictor controlled in a closed loop by a proper combination of speed, temperature, flow rate and pressure signals in order to replicate the typical permeability of the lubricating circuit. The method has been applied to a 15 cc/rev <b>crankshaft</b> <b>mounted</b> gerotor pump for a medium displacement Diesel engine; the flow-pressure characteristics of the lubricating circuit at different temperatures and the oil heating rate measured on the engine have been supplied to the test rig control system. The reference pump has been contrasted with a <b>crankshaft</b> <b>mounted</b> variable displacement vane pump with absolute pressure limiter device and an off-axis external gear pump with the same displacement and pressure setting. Experimental tests bring to evidence the advantage of the variable displacement pump during short trips with cold start, while the external gear pump prevails at the end of NEDC cycle where highest engine speeds and oil temperatures are reached...|$|E
40|$|A {{closed loop}} spark advance control system was {{evaluated}} on a Volvo V 70 5 -cylinder spark ignited engine. The system utilises a <b>crankshaft</b> <b>mounted</b> torque sensor for combustion monitoring which provides individual cylinder combustion phasing information and enables individual cylinder spark advance control. The spark advance control system can compensate {{for changes in}} combustion operating conditions and hence limit the need for calibration. The spark advance control system was used in a mode of cylinder balancing where the control target {{is to keep the}} combustion phasing in all cylinders at a defined setpoint. This control law was evaluated in vehicle tests in an emission test chamber, running pre-defined driving cycles FTP 72 and Highway Fuel Economy Test. Analysis shows that the combustion phasing was kept close to the selected setpoint during both tests and, hence, robustness in that sense was demonstrated. The torque ratio concept is used for combustion phasing monitoring based on crankshaft torque measurements. Analysis of the 50 % torque ratio as a measure for combustion phasing shows that it is equivalent to 50 % burned mass fraction...|$|E

50|$|It was {{not until}} about 1839 that the truly {{portable}} engine appeared, allowing the application of steam power {{beyond the confines of}} the farmyard. William Tuxford of Boston, Lincolnshire started manufacture of an engine built around a locomotive-style boiler with horizontal smoke tubes. A single cylinder and the <b>crankshaft</b> were <b>mounted</b> on top of the boiler, and the whole assembly was mounted on four wheels: the front pair being steerable and fitted with shafts for horse-haulage between jobs. A large flywheel was <b>mounted</b> on the <b>crankshaft,</b> and a stout leather belt was used to transfer the drive to the equipment being driven. Several Tuxford engines were displayed at the Royal Agricultural Society's Show at Bristol in 1842, and other manufacturers soon joined in, using the basic design of the Tuxford engine as a pattern for the majority of portable engines produced thereafter.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The present paper {{describes}} an extensive study of trochoidal-gear pumps. As described in part 1 {{of the current}} paper, geometry and kinematics of trochoidal profiles and volumetric characteristics were considered to different extents. The bond graph technique was applied to model a trochoidal-gear pump based upon an ideal representation in order to simulate the instantaneous flow where the intricate aspects of leakage had been deliberately left aside. Nevertheless, leakage and interaction of the flow inside the pump are now presented in Part 2. The bond graph technique is applied to model a trochoidal-gear pump based upon a real representation in order to simulate the instantaneous flow, {{taking into account the}} different types of leakage by modelling them. Results from simulation of both models are compared and significant conclusions are obtained. The paper also examines the experimental determination of the flow ripple. A convenient method of experimentally measuring the so-called ‘secondary source ’ method is applied, as described in part 1. Results are verified by using two different test rigs to predict the flow ripple of a <b>crankshaft</b> <b>mounted</b> gerotor pump for the lubrication of IC engines. Results show good qualitative agreement with bond graph models. Correlation is shown to be good under certain parameters. There are two ultimate goals: to validate the bond graph model with the experimental results for the determination of the instantaneous flow and to compare and contrast the source flow ripple results processed by two different mathematical algorithms by using two test rigs. In this way, this new investi-gation of the flow characteristics through simulation and experiment is a step to reach the dynamic properties of trochoidal-gear pumps under realistic conditions for use in further studies for modelling more complex hydraulic components...|$|E
