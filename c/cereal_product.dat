40|$|International audienceThe {{fragmentation}} behaviour of brittle airy <b>cereal</b> <b>product</b> is studied both numerically and experimentally. A cereal food item is {{subjected to}} severe compression up to the densification stage. Experimental evidence of typical airy food behaviour is pointed out including elasticity, cell collapse and densification regimes. In order to better explain the observed behaviour, especially the resulting fragmentation, a numerical approach is proposed based on the discrete element method. Predicted results show good agreement with experimental mechanical responses. In particular, the maximum force values for fragmentation {{and the size of}} resulting fragments are in good accordance with experiments. Our numerical results show that the observed fragment size distribution is the consequence of a small number of rupture events of cell walls. This result highlights the role of the airy structure associated with a particular tendency to form a bimodal size distribution of fragments...|$|E

Assuming no further change in contaminant levels during cereal processing and during the preparation of foodstuffs, conservative intakes are estimated for the consumers of <b>cereal</b> based <b>products</b> such as flour, bread, breakfast cereals, dough and pastry. The results show that for the consumer of organic foodstuffs, estimated daily intakes are 0. 56 µg deoxynivalenol (DON), 0. 03 µg zearalenone (ZEA), 0. 19 µg Cd, 0. 28 µg Pb and 0. 0006 µg Hg kg- 1 body weight, {{taking into account the}} average contaminant levels in unprocessed grains and the average <b>cereal</b> <b>products</b> consumptions in Belgium.

We hypothesized that glycemic index, glycemic load (GL), carbohydrate intake, grains, and <b>cereal</b> <b>product</b> consumption would be associated with nutrient adequacy. Eighty-two women with GDM (61 % of Asian background, 34 % whites) completed a 3 -day food record following their routine group nutrition education session. Nutrient intakes were compared to Nutrient Reference Values (NRV) for Australia and New Zealand. Nutrient intake across energy-adjusted tertiles of glycemic index, GL, carbohydrate intake, and intake of grains and cereal products were assessed. The majority of women (66 %- 99 %) did not meet the NRV for fiber, folate, vitamin D, iodine, and iron, and exceeded NRV for saturated fat and sodium. Higher dietary GL was associated with lower intakes of total, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fat; vitamin E; and potassium (all P <. 001). Higher grain intake was not significantly associated with intake of any micronutrients. In Australian women with GDM, high dietary GL predicts greater risk of poor nutrition. © 2013 Elsevier Inc [...] Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
