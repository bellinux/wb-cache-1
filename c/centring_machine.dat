40|$|The Afternoon House {{series is}} an ongoing {{research}} project leveraging belated or obsolete architectural techniques and ideas to explore the way that architecture makes world-order perceptible. It is a revision of Palladio's Villa for a world he could not imagine. It consists of a black shell of layered in-situ concrete, enclosed, partitioned, and furnished in light timber and fine steel joinery. The shell is formed by linear rhythms of solid and void. Complexity develops as simple rhythms slip {{in and out of}} phase with each other, converge and interfere. Although each pattern is rigorous and repetitive, no two of the resulting spaces are identical. Although the plan is not sensed directly in the way that heat, darkness, or solidity are sensed, it is nonetheless perceived. It {{is not a matter of}} the mind against the senses: it is incorrect to oppose cognitive order and sensory experience. Experience is also cognitive and order sensory. Rather than a <b>centring</b> <b>machine</b> like the Villa Rotonda, Afternoon House II is carved by orders that originate at a distance, and are only passing through on the way to somewhere else...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} a robot <b>machining</b> <b>centre</b> for rapid prototyping (RP) applications. Given a three-dimensional model of an object, surface features of the model were extracted and analysed. Cutter paths for both rough and finish cutting were then generated {{on the basis of the}} extracted surface features. In order to detect collision between the robot arm and its environment, an accurate model was built using a computer aided design (CAD) system and the Denavit-Hartenberg (D-H) notation was used to represent the robot arm transformation matrix. When collision was detected for a given contact point, both cutter location and robot arm positions were modified.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} shopfloor scheduling {{techniques for}} a highly automated metal cutting <b>machining</b> <b>centre.</b> The <b>machining</b> <b>centre</b> is modelled as a generalized f 1 owshop. i. e. {{a set of}} workstations where each workstation may contain several parallel machines. Parts visit all workstations {{in the same order}} and are processed by at most one machine in each workstation (a part may skip a workstation). Constraints on the scheduling problem are imposed by release and due dates for each job. The objective is to minimize maximal lateness. The approach presented in this paper, is based on a decomposition of the generalized flowshop and uses a parallel machine scheduling algorithm as its key building block. The main contribution of this paper is on the latter subject: the development of schedules with the objective to minimize maximal lateness in a parallel machine system with release and due dates...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} improve the {{availability}} and productivity of manufacturing systems, process monitoring has become an important matter in modern automated plants. The traditional monitoring technologies are based on single sensors and are insufficient, especially for manufacturing processes of highly complicated and automated systems. Instead, multi-sensor based technologies are developing rapidly and are widely used for such monitoring tasks. This paper introduces a multi-sensor based process monitoring system for an existing <b>machining</b> <b>centre.</b> The system can monitor the major manufacturing process faults or abnormalities of the <b>machining</b> <b>centre</b> and provide maintenance planning through measuring and analysing multiple sensor parameters such as power, vibration, temperature and pressure of spindle, feed axes, and hydraulic and pneumatic systems of the <b>machining</b> <b>centre.</b> The general structure of the monitoring system and {{the implementation of the}} main steps of the monitoring system development are presented in detail...|$|R

40|$|International audienceKey {{performances}} of industrial {{systems can be}} characterised by performances both related to the system itself but also the product/service it is delivering. It can be particularised in the manufacturing domain, by the performances related to the part manufactured (e. g. dimensional deviation, surface roughness) and to the <b>machining</b> <b>centre</b> (e. g. productivity, availability). The mastering of {{these two types of}} performances is nowadays mostly considerate separately, in the sense that current approaches lead to control product or machine performances mainly in an isolated way. Only few approaches try to take them into account jointly to permit to control {{performances of}} one thanks to the control of performances of the other and this all along the time. Thus a challenge in manufacturing {{is to be able to}} control part deviations from the mastering of the <b>machining</b> <b>centre</b> degradation. In that way, this paper is first proposing a review on current approaches able to support these two performance considerations and then to investigate scientifically, in the frame of automotive sector, a specific approach able to control part performances directly from <b>machining</b> <b>centre</b> performance...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: With {{shortening}} {{product life}} cycle, modern production facilities require rapid adaptation to new requirements. In addition, easier maintainability {{is called for}} {{in order to achieve}} a higher availability. This can be accomplished by means of modular and reconfigurable machines and facilities. For this purpose, machine modules with new system boundaries have to be designed as mechatronic and self-sustaining units to achieve reconfigurable machining systems. Thus new generations of machine configurations must be created. In this article, the analysis of interfaces for new mechatronic autonomous modules is developed, which will result in new modular machine concepts which are firstly applied on a transfer line where the machines represent the modules and secondly on <b>machining</b> <b>centre</b> where <b>machine</b> components are defined as modules. Thereby it is proven that by integration of functions and by setting new system boundaries, mechatronic autonomous modules are developable...|$|R
