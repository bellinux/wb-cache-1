40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the relative}} merits of an automated versus an open outcry trading system for a derivatives contract which is traded simultaneously at two <b>competing</b> <b>exchanges.</b> The only characterizing difference between these exchanges is the mode of operation. The domestic exchange (listing the underlying asset) operates by automated trading, the foreign exchange uses open outcry. Investigations are made to determine whether this operational competition supports a trading system segmentation hypothesis. First, quote setting is investigated {{to determine whether or not}} it is related to the transparency of the trading system. Second, analysis is carried out to determine whether the transparency of the trading system influences the lead/lag relationship in returns and volatility between the two markets.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a theory of}} the opening and dynamic development of a futures market with <b>competing</b> <b>exchanges.</b> The optimal contract design involves a trade-o¤ between the hedging potential of a contract and it's degree of substitution with competing contracts. As design costs go down slowly, more exchanges enter, but if costs go down fast or reach zero, markets consolidate (fewer number of exchanges). I develop implications for how the hedging potential and cross-correlation between contracts develop over time. I extend the model to a case where demand is uncertain before trade has been observed, and perform comparative statics on the social e¢ ciency of market opening. For markets with equivalent expected surplus, the propensity of markets to open are negatively related to the probability of further entry and the ex ante uncertainty, and positively related to the time lag between innovations...|$|R

40|$|This paper applies an {{econometric model}} of {{imperfect}} competition to equity trading with <b>competing</b> <b>exchanges.</b> Stock {{of the same}} company is traded on multiple venues today. This development was driven by regulations, aimed at benefiting investors by fostering competition among exchanges. However, the welfare consequences of increased exchange competition are theoretically ambiguous. While competition does place down- ward pressure on the bid-ask spread, this force may be outweighed by increased adverse selection that stems from additional arbitrage opportunities. We investigate this ambi- guity empirically by estimating key parameters of the model using detailed trading data from Australia. The benefits of increased competition are outweighed by the costs of multi-venue arbitrage. Compared to the prevailing duopoly, we predict that the coun- terfactual spread under a monopoly would be 23 percent lower. Further, market design variations on the continuous limit order book would eliminate profits from cross-venue ar- bitrage strategies and reduce the spread by 51 percent. Finally, eliminating off-exchange trades, so-called dark trading, would reduce the spread by 11 percent...|$|R

Following this insight we then suggest that changing these <b>competing</b> inter-chain <b>exchanges</b> from the previously considered antiferromagnetic to the ferromagnetic ones eliminates the issue of the marginal interactions altogether and dramatically expands the region of stability of the columnar dimer phase.

Using data from virtually the entire universe of global equity activity, we present two sets of complete rankings for up to forty-five separate locations for the 1990 - 2006 period. The first phase of our analysis evaluates international stock exchanges based on their ability to attract global initial public offerings (IPOs). The second phase compares the capacity of these exchanges to provide an efficient trading platform for cross-listed companies. U. S. exchanges are effectively the unique hosts for cross-border equity activity originating from many other locations. Moreover, they are the destination of choice for most companies coming from locations with highly prestigious exchanges. We find that, despite a diminished ability to attract cross-border IPOs, U.
