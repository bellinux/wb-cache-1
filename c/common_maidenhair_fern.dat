40|$|Background and objectives: <b>Maidenhair</b> <b>fern</b> is an herbal {{medicine}} {{belonging to the}} family Pteridaceae which is extensively found in Atlantic coast as far as Ireland, America and Iran. The fronds of Adiantum capillus-veneris are prescribed for treatment of different diseases. Different phytochemical compositions such as flavonoids, alkaloids, tannins, terpenoids, etc. {{have been found in}} this species. Due to the various phyto-compositions, the plant has been investigated for its pharmacological properties. Methods: Databases were searched for “Adiantum capillus-veneris”, “Maidenhair fern” without limitation up to 2016. Data on the herb were collected via electronic databases including Web of science, PubMed, Scopus, SID (for Persian papers), Science direct and Cochrane Library. Results: <b>Maidenhair</b> <b>fern</b> revealed to possess numerous pharmacological effects such as anti-diabetic, analgesic, hypocholesterolemic, goitrogenic, anti-thyroidal, antibacterial effects, etc. in modern medicine. Conclusion: <b>Maidenhair</b> <b>fern</b> grows in many places. Because of different phytoconstituents of the species, many pharmacological effects are ascribed to the plant. So, the herb can be a good choice for clinical studies...|$|R

5|$|Until 1991, A.viridimontanum was grouped {{with the}} western <b>maidenhair</b> <b>fern,</b> A.aleuticum, which grows both in western North America and as a disjunct on {{serpentine}} outcrops in eastern North America. At one time, A.aleuticum itself was classified as a variety (A.pedatum var. aleuticum) of the northern <b>maidenhair</b> <b>fern,</b> A.pedatum. However, {{after several years of}} study, botanist Cathy Paris recognized that A.aleuticum was a distinct species, and that some of the specimens that had been attributed to that taxon (group of organisms) were a third, hybrid species intermediate between A.pedatum and A.aleuticum. She named the new species A.viridimontanum for the site of its discovery in the Green Mountains in Vermont; it has since been located in Quebec and in one site on serpentine in coastal Maine.|$|R
50|$|The {{vascular}} flora {{is dominated}} by obligate epipetric plants, that is, plants that grow only on the surfaces of rocks. Typical species growing {{on the walls of}} sinkholes include brittle <b>maidenhair</b> <b>fern</b> (Adiantum tenerum), broad halberd fern (Tectaria heracleifolia), creeping fern (Thelypteris reptans), least halberd fern, and slender spleenwort. Ferns with limited distributions include delicate spleenwort (Asplenium verecundum), fragrant <b>maidenhair</b> <b>fern</b> (Adiantum melanoleucum), holly fern (Lomariopsis kunzeana), and Kraus' filmy fern (Trichomanes krausii)--all with South Florida distributions limited to the Miami Rock Ridge. On the edges of sinkholes, other species such as Costa Rican ladies-tresses (Spiranthes costaricensis) can be found. When conditions are appropriate, wetland trees, such as pond-apple and coco-plum, may be found growing out of the bottom or walls of sinkholes.|$|R
