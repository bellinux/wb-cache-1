5|$|Similarly, Susumu Tonegawa {{demonstrated}} in 1996 that the CA1 {{area of the}} hippocampus {{is crucial to the}} formation of spatial memories in living mice. So-called place cells located in this region become active only when the rat is in a particular location — called a place field — in the environment. Since these place fields are distributed throughout the environment, one interpretation is that groups of place cells form maps in the hippocampus. The accuracy of these maps determines how well a rat learns about its environment and thus how well it can navigate it. Tonegawa found that by impairing the NMDA receptor, specifically by genetically removing the NR1 subunit in the CA1 region, the place fields generated were substantially less specific than those of controls. That is, mice produced faulty spatial maps when their NMDA receptors were impaired. As expected, these mice performed very poorly on spatial tasks <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>controls,</b> further supporting the role of LTP in spatial learning.|$|E

2500|$|NCRP Report No. 153 [...] notes that: “Denisova et al. exposed rats to 1.5 Gy of 1 GeV/u56Feions {{and tested}} their spatial memory in an eight-arm radial maze. Radiation {{exposure}} impaired the rats’ cognitive behavior, since they committed more errors than control rats in the radial maze and {{were unable to}} adopt a spatial strategy to solve the maze. To determine whether these findings related to brain-region specific alterations in sensitivity to oxidative stress, inflammation or neuronal plasticity, three regions of the brain, the striatum, hippocampus and frontal cortex that are linked to behavior, were isolated and <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>controls.</b> Those that were irradiated were adversely affected as reflected through the levels of dichlorofluorescein, heat shock, and synaptic proteins (for example, synaptobrevin and synaptophysin). Changes in these factors consequently altered cellular signaling (for example, calciumdependent protein kinase C and protein kinase A). These changes in brain responses significantly correlated with working memory errors in the radial maze. The results show differential brain-region-specific sensitivity induced by 56Fe irradiation (...) [...] These findings {{are similar to those}} seen in aged rats, suggesting that increased oxidative stress and inflammation may be responsible for the induction of both radiation and age-related cognitive deficits.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1979, the EPA {{announced}} {{the result of}} blood tests which showed high white blood cell counts, a precursor to leukemia, and chromosome damage in Love Canal residents. 33% of the residents had undergone chromosomal damage. In a typical population, chromosomal damage affects 1% of people. Other studies were unable to find harm. The United States National Research Council (NRC) surveyed Love Canal health studies in 1991. The NRC noted the major exposure of concern was the groundwater rather than drinking water; the groundwater [...] "seeped into basements" [...] and then led to exposure through air and soil noted several studies {{reported higher levels of}} low-birth weight babies and birth defects among the exposed residents with some evidence the effect subsided after the exposure was eliminated. The National Research Council also noted a study which found exposed children were found to have an [...] "excess of seizures, learning problems, hyperactivity, eye irritation, skin rashes, abdominal pain, and incontinence" [...] and stunted growth. Voles in the area were found to have significantly increased mortality <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>controls</b> (mean life expectancy in exposed animals [...] "23.6 and 29.2 days, respectively, compared to 48.8 days" [...] for control animals). New York State also has an ongoing health study of Love Canal residents. In that year, the Albert Elia Building Co., Inc., now Sevenson Environmental Services, Inc., was selected as the principal contractor to safely re-bury the toxic waste at the Love Canal Site.|$|E
5000|$|A 2002 study {{explored}} {{the relationship between}} allergies and salivary immunoglobulin levels in eighty subjects. Researchers demonstrated an association between development of allergies and disturbances in saliva allergen-specific IgA levels (elevated <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>controls)</b> and total secretory IgA (reduced <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>controls).</b> In 2011 Peeters, et al., identified characteristic aberrations in certain salivary metabolites that were associated with peanut-allergic individuals when compared to peanut-tolerant controls. In 2003 Vojdani, et al., found that individuals exposed to various allergenic molds and mycotoxins showed “significantly higher levels of salivary IgA antibodies against one or more mold species.” ...|$|E
30|$|Higher {{electric}} field led into {{a higher level}} of moisture removal, rehydration ratio and content of Vitamin C of Chinese wolfberry fruits, <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>control.</b> Also, the remaining moisture content, rehydration ratio and content of Vitamin C increased with an increase of applied voltage. But, no significant difference on shrinkage of dried Chinese wolfberry fruits was found <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>control.</b>|$|R
30|$|Groups {{treated with}} rhBMP- 2 {{demonstrated}} improved bone mineral density at both 4 and 8  weeks <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> saline groups, {{in addition to}} strong trends towards improvement of intrinsic and extrinsic biomechanical properties when <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> groups. Data revealed trends toward dose-dependent increases in peak torque, torsional rigidity, shear stress, and shear modulus 4  weeks after rhBMP- 2 treatment.|$|R
40|$|International audienceBoron nitride (BN) {{is known}} for high hardness, thermal stability, thermal conductivity, and {{catalytic}} action. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the effect of biofield treatment on physical, structural and spectral properties of BN powder. The control and treated sample of BN powder were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), surface area analysis and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). XRD results indicated that biofield treatment had substantially changed the crystallinity of BN powder as <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>control.</b> Apart from the crystallinity, significant changes were also observed in lattice parameter, density and molecular weight of the treated BN powder as <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> sample. The XRD data confirmed 33. 30 % increase crystallite size in treated BN powder as <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>control.</b> The surface area data showed 10. 33 % increment in surface area of treated BN as <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>control.</b> Furthermore, FT-IR spectra revealed that some part of BN may be transformed from hexagonal BN (h-BN) to rhombohedral boron nitride (r-BN), which was corroborated by emergence of new prominent peaks at 1388 cm- 1 in treated BN as <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> sample. These findings suggest that biofield treatment has substantially altered the structural properties and surface area of treated BN powder...|$|R
