He warned against the illiberal approach of seeking new powers to intercept communications, or banning non-violent groups, and asserted that liberalism will kill totalitarianism softly, not by mimicking it. He advocates a civil society push back against extremism, just like it was done against racism and homophobia, by seeding grass-roots initiatives and making extremist narratives a taboo. In Nawaz's view, society is moving from an era of Nation-States and Globalisation, where identity is defined by national allegiances and citizenship, to an [...] "Age of Behaviour" [...] where behaviour is shaped by transnational ideas, narratives and allegiances.|$|E
2500|$|In {{an article}} for the Financial Times, Nawaz argues that Jihadism is no longer {{dependent}} on organisations because {{it has become a}} brand, and brands generate followers without the need for leadership. He argues that just like Britain invests in early intervention campaigns in areas like drug abuse and sexual health, extremism should be challenged at a stage before it morphs into terrorism.

40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} role played by comparative and non comparative advertising formats on recall inhibition of <b>competing</b> <b>brands</b> in a product category. Category characteristics of open (awareness of multiple brands) and closed categories (dominated by an unchallenged leading brand and relatively low salience of <b>competing</b> <b>brands)</b> are taken into account. An experiment in which a total of 156 Norwegian business students participated was conducted. The results show that contrary to previous belief, comparative advertising, relative to non-comparative advertising, is not as potent in inducing recall inhibition of <b>competing</b> <b>brands</b> in a product category. Moreover, the results indicate that if a category possesses a brand which has reached maximum salience, regardless of which brand a subject is cued with, no significant recall inhibition takes place...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we attempt}} to {{integrate}} research on consumer information processing and the consumer choice process {{with the goal of}} proposing a general framework for modeling consumer behavior in monopolistically competitive industries. Following a pattern of inductive reasoning, we posit a set of consumer behavior propositions that is consistent with observed results from context effects experiments and the phased decision-making literature. We propose that, faced with many <b>competing</b> <b>brands</b> in a monopolistically competitive environment, consumers can be said to construct consideration sets on the basis of non-compensatory rules and subsequently choose from among <b>competing</b> <b>brands</b> within a consideration set on the basis of compensatory rules. We identify five product-market characteristics that consumers use as heuristics to maximize the probability of making the optimal brand choice while minimizing the cost of acquiring and processing information about <b>competing</b> <b>brands.</b> We propose that consumers use memory and stimuli based information to evolve their unique perceptions of these product-market characteristics. As a follow-up to our inductive approach, we show that the empirically documented context effects are consistent with our behavioral propositions. Finally, we use the propositions to explain several classic cases of consumer behavior observed in the beer, ice...|$|R

40|$|Competitive {{advertising}} interference {{arises when}} viewers of advertising for a focal brand are also exposed to advertising messages for <b>competing</b> <b>brands</b> {{within a short}} time period, say one week for TV advertising. Although competitive advertising interference has been shown to reduce ad recall and recognition and brand evaluation measures, no studies have examined the impact on sales. In this research we use a market response model of sales for two grocery categories in the Chicago area to investigate possible advertising interference effects. The results show that competitive interference effects are strong. When one or more <b>competing</b> <b>brands</b> advertise in the same week as the focal brand, the advertising elasticity diminishes for the focal brand. The rate of decrease depends on the number of <b>competing</b> <b>brands</b> advertising in a particular week and their total GRPs broadcast. We are able to derive optimal advertising levels for the brands within a category so that they all have the maximum sales response from advertising. It transpires that the current level of television advertising within the two categories is much higher than this optimum level, indicating that these grocery brands are likely to be over advertising at present. Curtailing advertising for all the brands would increase the response to advertising for each of them...|$|R
