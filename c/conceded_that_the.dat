5|$|Sam Jones III was {{the last}} of the season one series regulars to be cast–being hired just four days before filming for the pilot episode began. Jones, who is African American, was also cast against the Superman mythology where Pete Ross is Caucasian. Jones has stated that he would have {{understood}} if the producers had simply created a black character for him to portray, but the fact that they chose to go with him, even though the character has always been white, gave him more honor {{to be a part of}} the show. During the first season, Jones felt like he should have more screen time, but later <b>conceded</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> show was about Clark's journey and that the other characters are there to help his story move along.|$|E
5|$|The ACCC <b>conceded</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{state governments}} were not {{carrying}} on businesses in procuring the medical products. This {{meant that the}} governments were immune from Sections46 and 47 of the TPA. Baxter argued that this immunity extended to itself, by claiming derivative governmental immunity. On 16 May 2005, The Federal Court of Australia (Allsop J presiding) found in Baxter's favour at first instance. While {{the court held that}} Baxter would have breached the TPA, governmental immunity under Section2B extended to Baxter Healthcare. Allsop J's judgment was upheld unanimously on appeal to the full bench of the Federal Court (Justices Mansfield, Dowsett and Gyles presiding). The full bench expressed unease about its own judgment, stating that the question of derivative governmental immunity should be left to the High Court for reconsideration of Bradken.|$|E
5|$|Wallace {{had to make}} a choice: {{he could}} launch an attack and fight through the Confederate rear to reach Grant's forces closer to Pittsburg Landing, or reverse his {{direction}} and march toward Pittsburg Landing via a crossroads to the River Road. Wallace chose the second option. (After the war, Wallace claimed that his division might have attacked and defeated the Confederates if his advance had not been interrupted, but later <b>conceded</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> move would not have been successful.) Rather than realign his troops so the rear guard would be in the front, Wallace made a controversial decision to countermarch his troops to maintain the original order, only facing in the other direction. The move further delayed Wallace's troops as they marched north along the Shunpike road, then took a crossover to reach the River Road to the east, and headed south toward the battlefield.|$|E
50|$|Two {{weeks after}} the disappearance, Detective Superintendent Roger Nicklin had to <b>concede</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> police still had “absolutely no idea about Mark’s disappearance”.|$|R

50|$|Perhaps <b>conceding</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{physical}} {{connection to the}} Caledonian Railway had not been achieved, the Company's publicity at the time referred to The Dumbartonshire Railway.|$|R
5|$|Following {{the issue}} of the papal bull Clericis laicos in 1296, forbidding the payment of taxes to a secular power, Winchelsey urged his clergy in 1297 to refuse {{payments}} to Edward. However, the clergy of the province of York paid a tax of a fifth of their revenues. Edward then declared clerics who refused to pay outlaws, and ordered their property to be seized. He <b>conceded</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> clergy could return to his protection if they paid a fine of a fifth of their revenues, exactly what the northern clergy had offered in the way of taxation. The royal clerks and many other clergy paid the fines, and in March, the southern clergy met again, and after a long debate, Winchelsey instructed each clerk to decide for himself whether or not to pay the fine. It appears that most chose to pay, but the archbishop still refused to make any contribution, and so Edward seized his lands. They were returned to him in July 1297, when the king and prelate were reconciled at Westminster. Winchelsey then tried to mediate between Edward and the earls, who also objected to Edward's tax demands.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Williamson and Carr {{described}} a dome (specimen NMMNH P-33983 in the New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science) from the San Juan Basin, New Mexico, which they considered a juvenile pachycephalosaur of uncertain species (though perhaps Sphaerotholus goodwini). In 2006, Sullivan and Spencer G. Lucas {{considered it a}} juvenile S. validum, which would expand {{the range of the}} species considerably. In 2011, Steven E. Jasinski and Sullivan considered the specimen an adult, and made it the holotype of the new species Stegoceras novomexicanum, with two other specimens (SMP VP-2555 and SMP VP-2790) as paratypes. A 2011 phylogenetic analysis by Watabe and colleagues did not place the two Stegoceras species close to each other. In 2016, Williamson and Stephen L. Brusatte restudied the holotype of S. novomexicanum and found that the paratypes did not belong to the same taxon as the holotype, and that all the involved specimens were juveniles. Furthermore, they were unable to determine whether the holotype specimen represented the distinct species S. novomexicanum, or if it was a juvenile of either S. validum or Sphaerotholus goodwini, or another previously known pachycephalosaur. In 2016, Jasinski and Sullivan defended the validity of S. novomexicanum; they agreed that some features used to diagnose the species were indicative of a sub-adult stage, but presented additional diagnostic features in the holotype that distinguish the species. They also pointed out some adult features, which may indicate heterochrony (difference in timing of ontogenetic changes between related taxa) in the species. They <b>conceded</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> paratypes and other assigned specimens differed from the holotype in having more highly domed skulls, instead referring to them as cf. S. novomexicanum (difficult to identify), but found it likely they all belonged to the same taxon (with the assigned specimens being adults), due to the restricted stratigraphic interval and geographic range.|$|E
25|$|The {{painting}} {{itself was}} not insured; then-Arts Minister Race Mathews <b>conceded</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> price of insurance was prohibitive for major works of art.|$|E
50|$|In the Middle Ages Christian {{ideology}} taught <b>that</b> <b>the</b> distress, {{and death}} itself, were punishments for Adam's fall, while <b>conceding</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> tribulations of {{life could be}} vehicles of divine correction.|$|R
50|$|Those {{who argue}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{world is not}} {{simulated}} must <b>concede</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> mind—at least the sleeping mind—is not itself an entirely reliable mechanism for attempting to differentiate reality from illusion.|$|R
50|$|It {{took four}} years for California's Supreme Court to <b>concede</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> law was unconstitutional, in State of California v. Fujii (1952). Finally, in 1956, California voters {{repealed}} the law.|$|R
25|$|After the 2013 election, {{the former}} {{communications}} minister Stephen Conroy <b>conceded</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> initial rollout plans were 'too ambitious' {{and that there}} were delays in implementation.|$|E

25|$|At a media {{conference of}} {{government}} officials convened immediately after the book's release, the Chief Executive of the New Zealand Ministry for the Environment, Barry Carbon, <b>conceded</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> book was largely accurate but disputed {{the interpretation of the}} material.|$|E
25|$|However it was <b>conceded</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ERU {{team on the}} day {{had no way of}} {{guessing}} {{what his}} intentions were, and could not have let him exit the outer perimeter with a loaded shotgun that he had been discharging frequently for two days.|$|E
25|$|ODI {{conclusions}} {{were that}} the IMF's very nature of promoting market-oriented approaches attracted unavoidable criticism. On the other hand, the IMF {{could serve as a}} scapegoat while allowing governments to blame international bankers. The ODI <b>conceded</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> IMF was insensitive to political aspirations of LDCs, while its policy conditions were inflexible.|$|E
50|$|At the end {{of season}} three, Avon is convicted of parole {{violations}} (and possibly a conspiracy charge). Marlo and Chris attend his sentencing hearing. Avon acknowledges Marlo, thus <b>conceding</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> crown has been passed.|$|R

5000|$|On its release, The New York Times {{called it}} a [...] "glorious victory" [...] for Fields and comedy, while <b>conceding</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> scenes without Fields were [...] "painfully frail" [...] and would provoke some squirming and eye-rolling.|$|R
25|$|In that case's {{majority}} opinion, Harry Blackmun <b>conceded</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> facts {{no longer}} supported the exemption and that baseball was indeed interstate commerce, but echoed Clark in {{suggesting that the}} consequences of overturning the previous decisions would be worse than letting it stand. Chief Justice Warren Burger agreed in a short concurrence that also indicated his acceptance of Douglas's regret.|$|E

25|$|On November 15, 2016, it was {{reported}} that New Jersey's Attorney General Christopher Porrino had <b>conceded</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> state's 1985 ban on stun guns is unconstitutional. On April 26, 2017 the lawsuit was settled by agreeing that the ban was unconstitutional and to promulgate regulations to allow for the possession of stun guns. The regulations allow for people over 18 to purchase stun guns, effective October 20, 2017.|$|E

25|$|By early March 1988, {{the band}} had {{finished}} recording Spirit of Eden and {{had sent a}} cassette of the album to EMI. After listening to the cassette, EMI representatives doubted {{that it could be}} commercially successful. They asked Hollis to re-record a song or replace material, but he refused to do so. By the time the masters were delivered later in the month, however, the label <b>conceded</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> album had been satisfactorily completed.|$|E
25|$|Canada {{had claimed}} Hans Island was clearly in their territory, as {{topographic}} maps originally used in 1967 {{to determine the}} island's coordinates clearly showed the entire island on Canada's side of the delimitation line. However, federal officials reviewed the latest satellite imagery in July 2007, and <b>conceded</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> line went roughly {{through the middle of}} the island. This presently leaves ownership of the island disputed, with claims over fishing grounds and future access to the Northwest Passage possibly at stake as well.|$|E
25|$|As {{to whether}} the Deakins line or Michler line was the correct meridan, Justice Day <b>conceded</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Michler line more truly {{reflected}} {{the intent of the}} land grant to Lord Baltimore. But Day also noted that maps in that era were inaccurate at best, and little surveying of the land had been done. The location of the Fairfax Stone, however, was known and clearly had been referred to as a boundary marker by both states. Indeed, the constitution of Maryland even referred to it as such.|$|E
5000|$|Analysts {{suggest that}} this was a Russian {{reaction}} to dissuade Georgia from making further moves towards joining NATO.
