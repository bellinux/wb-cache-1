5|$|Sharp <b>condemnation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{military}} {{came not}} just from the international community, but from within parts of the Indonesian elite.|$|E
5|$|This outcry led to <b>condemnation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{plans and}} {{heritage}} {{listing of the}} property by the National Trust, and forced the Commonwealth Bank to ask the Federal Government to take the property off its hands.|$|E
5|$|There {{was a lot}} {{of tension}} between Duyet and Minh Mạng. Although Gia Long had enlisted European support to claim the throne and allowed missionaries to {{function}} in Vietnam in gratitude to Pigneau, he ran a classical Confucian administration. He also expressed dismay at the Catholic <b>condemnation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> traditional ancestral worship, a basic tenet of Vietnamese culture; Crown Prince Cảnh had been converted by Pigneau and subsequently refused to bow down to his ancestors, instead desecrating a shrine with feces.|$|E
25|$|Several {{nations and}} U.S. states, have passed formal {{legislative}} <b>condemnations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Armenian Genocide, despite intense Turkish diplomatic and economic pressure. Switzerland has adopted laws that punish genocide denial.|$|R
50|$|Government {{officials}} for several states issued <b>condemnations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> attacks and condolences to those affected. These included the Czech Republic, France, Iran, Italy, Jordan, Kuwait, Pakistan, Qatar, and the United States.|$|R
2500|$|The next day, Iran joined {{international}} <b>condemnations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kidnap, with {{a foreign}} ministry spokesman, Mohammad Ali Hosseini, saying that kidnapping was not acceptable to Iran, and that Iran rejected kidnapping as a [...] "matter of principle." ...|$|R
5|$|After the Japanese {{surrender}} {{and towards}} the end of the Indonesian National Revolution, a second series was published under the same title by Alisjabahna with new contributors, including Chairil Anwar, Achdiat Karta Mihardja, and Asrul Sani. The first edition of this new series, dated March 1948 but released in May, included a heated <b>condemnation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Indonesian leadership for perceived unwillingness to deal with the suffering which occurred during the occupation. This new publication, which Jassin described as unoriginal, ceased in 1954. It was later replaced by Konfrontasi, led by Alisjahbana, which published bi-monthly from 1954 until 1962.|$|E
5|$|Eddie Barlow, {{one of the}} South African {{members of}} the Rest of the World team, {{suggested}} to Sobers {{towards the end of}} the English series that the West Indian might like to take part in a friendly double-wicket competition in the Rhodesian capital Salisbury on 12 September, the local Pioneers' Day holiday. Barlow was one of several prominent South African cricketers already booked to play. Sobers was initially noncommittal, but decided to go following assurances that Rhodesia did not practise apartheid and there would be no racial discrimination regarding team selection. Sobers' intended participation became public on 7 September when a London newspaper reported on it; widespread <b>condemnation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> West Indian captain followed, but he still travelled, landing in Salisbury early on the day of the event.|$|E
5|$|Gia Long tolerated the Catholic {{faith of}} his French allies and {{permitted}} unimpeded missionary activities {{out of respect}} to his benefactors. The missionary activity was dominated by the Spanish in Tonkin and French in the central and southern regions. At {{the time of his}} death, there were six European bishops in Vietnam. The population of Christians was estimated at 300,000 in Tonkin and 60,000 in Cochinchina. However, he expressed dismay at the Catholic <b>condemnation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> traditional ancestor worship, a basic tenet of Vietnamese culture. Gia Long was also known for his disdain for Buddhism, the religion practiced by the majority of the population. Despite its popularity among ladies of the court, Gia Long often restricted the activities of Buddhists.|$|E
25|$|Unlike <b>the</b> {{declaration}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1969 meeting, the Berlin conference document did {{not contain}} any <b>condemnation</b> <b>of</b> China. <b>The</b> Soviets had pushed for a <b>condemnation</b> <b>of</b> China ahead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conference, but the Yugoslavs, the French and the Italians resisted these moves.|$|R
50|$|Hank Morgan's {{opinions}} are also strongly denunciatory towards <b>the</b> Catholic Church <b>of</b> <b>the</b> medieval period; the Church {{is seen by}} the Yankee as an oppressive institution that stifles science and teaches peasants meekness only as a means <b>of</b> preventing <b>the</b> overthrow <b>of</b> Church rule and taxation. The book also contains many depictions and <b>condemnations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dangers <b>of</b> superstition and <b>the</b> horrors <b>of</b> medieval slavery.|$|R
2500|$|While {{there are}} no reports {{relating}} to homosexuality in the best known hadith collections of Bukhari and Muslim, other canonical collections record a number <b>of</b> <b>condemnations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> [...] "act <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people <b>of</b> Lot" [...] (male-to-male anal intercourse). For example, Abu `Isa Muhammad ibn `Isa at-Tirmidhi (compiling the Sunan al-Tirmidhi around C.E.884) wrote that Muhammad had indeed prescribed {{the death penalty for}} both the active and also the passive partner: ...|$|R
5|$|Her {{more radical}} {{positions}} included acceptance of interracial marriage. Despite her opposition to giving African American men {{the right to}} vote without enfranchising all women and the derogatory language she had resorted to in expressing this opposition, Stanton had no objection to interracial marriage and wrote a congratulatory letter to Frederick Douglass upon his marriage to Helen Pitts, a white woman, in 1884. Anthony, fearing public <b>condemnation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA) and wanting to keep the demand for female suffrage foremost, pleaded with Stanton not to make her letter to Douglass or support for his marriage publicly known.|$|E
5|$|The French media {{reported}} {{little on}} the event as it happened, and relatively little mention of the nationalist struggle was mentioned in Les Temps Modernes, the leftist publication that would become considered the leading anti-colonial advocate after {{the launch of the}} French offensive in Indochina. Other private publications served as forums for the Francophone intelligentsia to express their <b>condemnation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French government's response to the Uprising. The most commentary appeared in the left-leaning Catholic monthly L'Esprit, with criticisms also published in other leftist publications like Humanité, Combat, Franc-tireur and Témoignage Chrétien. Albert Camus penned a seething rebuke of the French colonial administration that was published on 10 May 1947 in Combat. Very few details of the rising and subsequent repression were reported at the time outside France.|$|E
5|$|The infamous Australian bushranger, Ned Kelly, made {{possibly}} {{his most}} daring raid in the Riverina, at Jerilderie in 1879. After riding overland from north east Victoria, Kelly {{and his gang}} in a brazen move captured two local policemen and stole their uniforms. Impersonating the police, they then proceeded to rob the Bank of New South Wales and held the town captive for several days. While in Jerilderie, he sought to have his manifesto published, the famous Jerilderie letter, a rambling 8,000 word <b>condemnation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> colonial administration in Victoria and specifically {{the treatment of the}} Irish. Being unable to find the local newspaper editor, he left the letter with a member of the bank staff and returned to Victoria £2,000 richer.|$|E
25|$|One view, first propounded by Enlightenment philosophers, {{asserts that}} the Church's doctrines are entirely superstitious and have {{hindered}} <b>the</b> progress <b>of</b> civilization. Communist states have made similar arguments in their education in order to inculcate a negative view of Catholicism (and religion in general) in their citizens. The most famous incidents cited by such critics are <b>the</b> Church's <b>condemnations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> teachings <b>of</b> Copernicus, Galileo Galilei and Johannes Kepler.|$|R
2500|$|This fiction was {{supported}} by <b>the</b> radio broadcasts <b>of</b> SOG's [...] "Voice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SSPL", leaflet drops, and gift kits containing pre-tuned radios which could only receive broadcasts from the unit's transmitters. SOG also broadcast [...] "Radio Red Flag," [...] programming purportedly directed {{by a group of}} dissident communist military officers also within the north. Both stations were equally adamant in their <b>condemnations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> PRC, the South and North Vietnamese regimes, and the U.S. and called for a return to traditional Vietnamese values. Straight news, without propaganda embellishment, was broadcast from South Vietnam via <b>the</b> Voice <b>of</b> Freedom, another SOG creation.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Condemnations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Irgun's 'bestialities' {{came from}} all {{sections}} of British society and media. Under the headline 'Murder in Palestine' The Times commented that: 'it is difficult to estimate the damage that will be done to the Jewish cause not only in this country but throughout the world by <b>the</b> cold-blooded murder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two British soldiers.... The Manchester Guardian, while urging the government that it was 'time to go' from Palestine, similarly noted that the hangings were 'a greater blow to the Jewish nation than to the British government.' ...|$|R
5|$|This notice was {{published}} in the Bechuanaland News and Malmani Chronicle on 2 February 1889. A grand indaba of the izinDuna and the whites of Bulawayo was soon convened, but because Helm and Thompson were not present, the start of the investigation was delayed until 11 March. As in the negotiations with Rudd and Thompson in October, Lobengula did not himself attend, remaining close by but not interfering. The izinDuna questioned Helm and Thompson at great length, and various white men gave their opinions on the concession. A group of missionaries acted as mediators. <b>Condemnation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> concession was led not by the izinDuna, but by the other whites, particularly Tainton.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, the Conference of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) {{was held}} in Havana, where Castro was {{selected}} as NAM president, a position he held till 1982. In his capacity as both President of the NAM and of Cuba he appeared at the United Nations General Assembly in October 1979 and gave a speech on the disparity between the world's rich and poor. His speech was greeted with much applause from other world leaders, though his standing in NAM was damaged by Cuba's abstinence from the U.N.'s General Assembly <b>condemnation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soviet war in Afghanistan. Cuba's relations across North America improved under Mexican President Luis Echeverría, Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, and U.S. President Jimmy Carter. Carter continued criticizing Cuba's human rights abuses, but adopted a respectful approach which gained Castro's attention. Considering Carter well-meaning and sincere, Castro freed certain political prisoners and allowed some Cuban exiles to visit relatives on the island, hoping that in turn Carter would abolish the economic embargo and stop CIA support for militant dissidents. Conversely, his relationship with China declined, as he accused Deng Xiaoping's Chinese government of betraying their revolutionary principles by initiating trade links with the U.S. and attacking Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|Once again, the British {{government}} {{did not wish to}} entrust its interests in Japan to a foreign officer, so the British Chiefs of Staff appointed Air Vice Marshal Cecil Bouchier as their representative at MacArthur's headquarters. His brief {{made it clear that he}} had no responsibility or authority over the BCOF or Commonwealth forces in Korea. After rashly ordering the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade to Pusan without transport or heavy equipment, much to Robertson's annoyance, Bouchier did attempt to confine himself to acting solely as a liaison officer. Following the dismissal of General Douglas MacArthur, Robertson held a press conference in which he defended the general and his conduct of the war. This constituted an implicit <b>condemnation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British government's policy. Soon after, during the Battle of the Imjin River, Robertson was consulted by the Americans about the possible consequences of the loss of the 1st Battalion, the Gloucestershire Regiment, and he advised them not to endanger the rest of the I Corps line with a rescue attempt. For his services in the Korean War, he was awarded the American Legion of Merit, and the South Korean Order of Military Merit.|$|E
2500|$|Returning to London, Foote's {{financial}} situation was still quite poor. After renting the Haymarket theatre and revising The Minor into a three-act version (up from the two-act version presented in Dublin), the play opened in London. Doran remarks that while [...] "The Minor failed in Dublin, {{very much to}} <b>the</b> credit <b>of</b> an Irish audience, [...] they condemned it on <b>the</b> ground <b>of</b> its grossness and immorality" [...] English society, nevertheless, while hearing <b>condemnations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> play, filled the theatres. The play played for full houses for 38 nights.|$|R
50|$|Her {{published}} works, the Moyen Court and the Règles des associées à l'Enfance de Jésus, {{were both}} {{placed on the}} Index Librorum Prohibitorum in 1688. Fénelon's Maximes des saints was also branded with <b>the</b> <b>condemnation</b> <b>of</b> both <b>the</b> Pope and <b>the</b> bishops <b>of</b> France.|$|R
50|$|During <b>the</b> years <b>of</b> Nikita Khrushchev’s leadership, frustrations {{had been}} {{mounting}} in the Kremlin over <b>the</b> difficulty <b>of</b> suppressing <b>the</b> Samizdat literary movement. In 1965, the Soviets arrested Yuri Daniel and Andrei Sinyavsky, two prominent samizdat writers. The trial {{was made a}} media spectacle, with Pravda issuing passionate <b>condemnations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> defendants. The trial did not, however, discourage the underground literary movement. Instead, it provoked the first spontaneous political demonstration {{to occur in the}} Soviet Union in 30 years, which Galanskov helped organize. Yuri Galanskov and Alexander Ginzburg also compiled detailed notes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trial and released their observations in a four-hundred page report known as The White Book. This work was widely circulated among the dissident writers and was eventually smuggled out to the West.|$|R
5|$|Public <b>condemnation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> use of breaker boys was so {{widespread}} that in 1885 Pennsylvania enacted a law forbidding {{the employment of}} anyone {{under the age of}} 12 from working in a coal breaker, but the law was poorly enforced; many employers forged proof-of-age documentation, and many families forged birth certificates or other documents so their children could support the family. Estimates of the number of breaker boys at work in the anthracite coal fields of Pennsylvania vary widely, and official statistics are generally considered by historians to undercount the numbers significantly. One estimate had 20,000 breaker boys working in the state in 1880, 18,000 working in 1900, 13,133 working in 1902, and 24,000 working in 1907. Technological innovations in the 1890s and 1900s (such as mechanical and water separators designed to remove impurities from coal) dramatically lowered the need for breaker boys, but adoption of the new technology was slow.|$|E
5|$|This new-found unity between East and West did not, however, {{solve the}} ongoing {{disputes}} in the east. Justinian's policies switched between attempts to force Monophysites {{to accept the}} Chalcedonian creed by persecuting their bishops and monks – thereby embittering their sympathizers in Egypt and other provinces – and attempts at a compromise that would win over the Monophysites without surrendering the Chalcedonian faith. Such an approach {{was supported by the}} Empress Theodora, who favoured the Monophysites unreservedly. In the <b>condemnation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Three Chapters, three theologians that had opposed Monophysitism before and after the Council of Chalcedon, Justinian tried to win over the opposition. At the Fifth Ecumenical Council, most of the Eastern church yielded to the Emperor's demands, and Pope Vigilius, who was forcibly brought to Constantinople and besieged at a champel, finally also gave his assent. However, the condemnation was received unfavourably in the west, where it led to new (albeit temporal) schism, and failed to reach its goal in the east, as the Monophysites, remained unsatisfied; all the more bitter for him because during his last years he took an even greater interest in theological matters.|$|E
5|$|As UN {{air raids}} against the North Koreans intensified, Dean {{was moved to}} Sunan, north of P'yongyang, to a hut where he lived with several guards. They began daily interrogations {{primarily}} aimed at forcing military intelligence from him or making him sign a written <b>condemnation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> UN intervention in Korea, but Dean adamantly refused to do so. Senior North Korean military leaders continued such interrogations through October 1950 but eventually gave up when Dean would not cooperate and was not intimidated by their threats. Dean continued to suffer from illness related to poor food {{but he was not}} given another interpreter and was not interrogated after October 1950. North Korean leaders had threatened to harm Dean if he did not cooperate but he was never actually tortured. Dean took to playing chess with his guards often and he was allowed to exercise daily. He was kept alone, however, and was never with other American prisoners for the remainder of his confinement. Dean later wrote extensively of his capture and imprisonment in his 1973 autobiography, General Dean's Story. He claimed the North Koreans considered him a war criminal and had many discussions with him about the problems with capitalism in the United States.|$|E
25|$|Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world's {{foremost}} HIV experts {{had written}} to courts and the Libyan government on the medics' behalf, blaming the epidemic on poor hygiene practices in the hospital. The epidemic is the largest documented outbreak of HIV within a hospital in history, {{and it was the}} first time HIV/AIDS became a public issue in Libya. Two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world's foremost HIV experts, Luc Montagnier and Vittorio Colizzi, supported the medics' case, and reaction to their convictions was swift, with a number of appeals from scientific and human rights organizations, and various official <b>condemnations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> verdict along with diplomatic initiatives.|$|R
50|$|Alfredo's Fire (2014) is a {{documentary}} film, directed by Andy Abrahams Wilson, about self-immolation victim Alfredo Ormando, who {{set fire to}} himself in January 1998 outside St. Peter's Basilica to protest <b>the</b> Catholic Church's <b>condemnation</b> <b>of</b> homosexuality. <b>The</b> film had its world premiere on February 2, 2014 at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival.|$|R
50|$|However, the Balochistan High Court {{restored}} the provincial assembly amid public <b>condemnation</b> <b>of</b> Governor's move. <b>The</b> step towards dissolving the assembly {{was believed to}} have been taken with <b>the</b> consent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> President and Prime Minister.|$|R

2500|$|Iran {{does not}} {{recognize}} <b>the</b> state <b>of</b> Israel and instead regards it as 'Palestine under occupation'. During <b>the</b> era <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Iranian Monarchy (1948–1979) under the Pahlavi Dynasty, Iran enjoyed cordial relations with Israel. Israel regarded Iran, a non-Arab power on <b>the</b> periphery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Arab world, as a natural ally and counterweight to Arab ambitions as part of David Ben-Gurion's alliance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> periphery. Even after the Iranian Revolution and Ayatollah Khomeini's public <b>condemnations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> [...] "Zionist entity". Iran suggests that all Israeli 'occupied territory' is either given back to their respective countries (ex. Golan Heights back to Syria) or is replaced with a Palestinian state. Iran also feels that Jerusalem should given to the Palestinians.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Condemnations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{violence}} {{were made}} by Ontario premier Dalton McGuinty and Toronto Mayor David Miller. In a press conference, Miller said, [...] "All Torontonians should be outraged. They’re criminals who came to Toronto deliberately to break the law. They are not welcome in this city." [...] Referring to damage caused by black bloc protesters downtown, he claimed that calling the attackers protesters was [...] "not fair {{to the people who}} came to [...] protest," [...] and that they were in fact [...] "criminals." [...] In a statement, Dimitri Soudas, spokesperson for Prime Minister Stephen Harper, proclaimed, [...] "Free speech is a principle of our democracy, but the thugs that prompted violence earlier today represent in no way, shape or form <b>the</b> Canadian way <b>of</b> life." ...|$|R
