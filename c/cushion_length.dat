40|$|This {{series of}} sled tests {{examined}} {{the effect of}} using real vehicle seats on child ATD performance. <b>Cushion</b> <b>length</b> was varied from production length of 450 mm to a shorter length of 350 mm. Lap belt geometry was set to rear, mid, and forward anchorage locations that span the range of allowable lap belt angles found in real vehicles. Six tests each were performed with the standard Hybrid III 6 YO and 10 YO ATDs. One additional test was performed using a booster seat with the 6 YO. An updated version of the UMTRI seating procedure was used to position the ATDs that positions the ATD hips further forward with longer seat cushions to reflect the effect of <b>cushion</b> <b>length</b> on posture that has been measured with child volunteers. ATD kinematics were evaluated using peak head excursion, peak knee excursion, the difference between peak head and peak knee excursion, and the minimum torso angle. Shortening the seat cushion improved kinematic outcomes, particularly for the 10 YO. Lap belt geometry had a greater effect on kinematics with the longer <b>cushion</b> <b>length,</b> with mid and forward belt geometries producing better kinematics than the rearward belt geometry. The worst kinematics for both ATDs occurred with the long <b>cushion</b> <b>length</b> and rearward lap belt geometry.

40|$|Final, April 2011 ‐May 2012 In a {{previous}} study, a computational model of child occupants 6 to 10 years old (YO) was validated {{using data from}} a sled test series with the 6 YO and 10 YO Hybrid‐III ATDs. Simulations using this model were used to identify characteristics of a vehicle seat and belt geometry that would improve occupant protection for older children not using booster seats. The current report presents a series of sled tests {{to examine the effects}} for other occupants using vehicle seats optimized for 6 ‐ to 10 ‐year‐old children. Tests were conducted with a 12 MO CRABI seated in a Graco SnugRide rear‐facing infant restraint and a Hybrid III 50 th male ATD. Seat <b>cushion</b> <b>length</b> was set to 450 mm, 400 mm, and 350 mm. Lap belt conditions included one representing the mid‐range of FMVSS No. 210, “Seat belt assembly anchorages,” allowable seat belt anchorage conditions as well as one more forward but closer to the vehicle seat H‐point. Shoulder belt conditions included the standard FMVSS No. 213 shoulder belt anchorage as well as one positioned closer to the adult male shoulder. Vehicle seats from a 2008 Dodge Town and Country were used, and some tests included modifications to make the front support structure of the seat cushion stiffer. The tests with the midsize adult male ATD showed no negative consequences from design changes intended to improve protection for children. Kinematics were similar among all conditions tested. For the rear‐facing infant restraint, none of the tests exceeded the 70 ° rotation angle requirement of FMVSS No. 213, although shorter <b>cushion</b> <b>length</b> and more forward belt locations produced larger rotations. The three tests with the more forward lap belt geometry slightly exceeded the 3 ‐ms‐chest clip acceleration limit of 60 g, but a review of all chest acceleration curves suggests that the vehicle seat may produce higher chest accelerations than the FMVSS No. 213 test bench. In tests with the shortest seat <b>cushion</b> <b>length,</b> the infant seat showed acceptable kinematics even though less than 80 percent of the child restraint base was initially supported on the vehicle seat. These preliminary tests with rear vehicle seat configurations selected to optimize protection for older child occupants produced good restraint kinematics for infants in a rear‐facing only child restraint and for adult mid‐size males. Additional research to identify possible negative consequences for other types of child restraints should be conducted. If shorter cushion lengths are chosen as a safety countermeasure for older children, the current child restraint installation requirement to have at least 80 percent of the base contacting the vehicle seat will need to be addressed...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAn ergonomically {{designed}} driver's seat {{is crucial in}} ensuring quality, comfort and safe driving. The increase in road accidents every year is mostly linked to drivers’ fatigue. Therefore, posture comfort is an important aspect in driver's seat design. The {{aim of this study}} is to design a driver's seat which is suitable for Malaysians. There are three main objectives in this study; firstly, to investigates the comfort level and safety system of the existing driver's seat, secondly, to identify and determine parameters which may affect comfort and the driver's seat safety system, and lastly, to develop and design an ergonomic driver's seat. Anthropometric data of drivers should be used during the driver's seat design stage. Critical dimensions of the driver's seat and anthropometric data must be taken into consideration in order to optimize the comfort level and safety of the seat. Previous studies showed that the evaluation of driver's seat discomfort should include both objective and subjective evaluations. The seat discomfort will negatively affect the driver's performance. All information pertaining to the driver's seat design was obtained through research on the related subjects. In the data collection phase, the objective evaluation method was used in determining the seat's dimension while subjective evaluation was used to gather information on the drivers’ experience. Anthropometric data from 1405 male and female subjects were collected and stored in a database. Meanwhile, subjective evaluation on driver's seat discomfort was conducted on 100 male and female respondents. The SPSS software was used to analyse the data. Every parameter that affects the safety and comfort of the driver's seat were then used to design a new driver's seat. The parameters that were taken into account are backrest height, cushion width, <b>cushion</b> <b>length</b> and adjustability. These parameters were then matched with the Malaysian drivers’ anthropometric data. Finally, the dimensions of the new driver's seat were determined: 520 mm cushion width; 380 mm <b>cushion</b> <b>length,</b> 480 mm backrest width, 407. 5 mm backrest height and 180 mm adjustability...|$|E

The NASS-CDS database was first used to identify rear-row occupant seating patterns. In the second row, adults tend {{to sit on the}} right side, but this is not true for children. Vans are the only vehicle type with substantial numbers of 3 rd row seating. The ages of rear seat occupant vary substantially with driver age. Drivers aged 16 - 25 most likely have other 16 - 25 YO or 0 - 4 YO occupants in the rear seat. For drivers aged 26 - 50, 85 % of their rear seat occupants are under aged 16. Drivers over age 50 have the greatest proportion of passengers over age 50 in the rear seat. From the injury analysis, seating in the rear seat is protective in terms of fatality and injury reduction, regardless of restraint use, except for rear impacts. The back of the front seat is a common injury contact point for rear-seat occupants. Studies of belt restraints have seldom found a difference in effectiveness between the front and rear seat. Most common injury contact points in side impact for belted children are on the lower rear quarter of the rear window. The presence of other occupants in the rear seat provides some benefit in injury reduction for children involved in side impacts, possibly by limiting lateral movement. Pediatric abdominal injury patterns indicate that the rear seats of minivans provide an environment with lower risk of abdomen injury compared to the back seats of passenger cars and SUVs. Pediatric injury rates are similar for children riding in SUVs and passenger cars, as potential benefits of a heavier vehicle are offset by a greater tendency to be in rollovers. Presence of a three-point belt rather than a lap-only belt reduces pediatric risk of AIS 2 + injury by 81 %. The presence of a shoulder belt in the center rear seating position usually only affects seating practices when there is a single child occupant in the rear seat...|$|R

40|$|A {{laboratory}} {{study was conducted}} to quantify the effects of belt-positioning boosters on lap and shoulder belt fit. Postures and belt fit were measured for forty-four boys and girls ages 5 to 12 in four highback boosters, one backless booster, and on a vehicle seat without a booster. Belt anchorage locations were varied over a wide range. Seat cushion angle, seat back angle, and seat <b>cushion</b> <b>length</b> were varied in the no-booster conditions. All boosters produced better mean lap belt fit than was observed in the no-booster condition, but the differences among boosters were relatively large. With one midrange belt configuration, the lap belt was not fully below the anterior-superior iliac spine (ASIS) landmark {{on the front of the}} pelvis for 89 % of children in one booster, and 75 % of children failed to achieve that level of belt fit in another. In contrast, the lap belt was fully below the ASIS for all but two children in the best-performing booster. Child body size had a statistically significant but relatively small effect on lap belt fit. The largest children sitting without a booster had approximately the same lap belt fit as the smallest children experienced in the worst-performing booster. Increasing lap belt angle relative to horizontal produced significantly better lap belt fit in the no-booster condition, but the boosters isolated the children from the effects of lap belt angles. Reducing seat <b>cushion</b> <b>length</b> in the no-booster condition improved lap belt fit but changing cushion angle did not. Belt upper anchorage (D-ring) location had a strong effect on shoulder belt fit in conditions without shoulder belt routing from the booster. Unexpectedly, the worst average shoulder belt fit was observed in one highback booster with a poorly positioned shoulder belt routing clip. The shoulder belt was routed more outboard, on average, with a backless booster than without a booster, but raising the child also amplified the effect of D-ring location, such that children were more likely to experience poor shoulder belt fit due to outboard and forward D-ring locations when sitting on the booster. Taller children experienced more-outboard shoulder belt fit in conditions without shoulder belt routing by the booster and in the one booster with poor shoulder belt routing. Adjustable shoulder belt routing on three of the highback boosters effectively eliminated stature effects, providing approximately the same shoulder belt fit for all children. Seat back angle did not have a significant effect on shoulder belt fit. The belt fit was measured in each test condition using the 6 YO and 10 YO Hybrid-III ATDs. ATD belt fit was strongly correlated with child belt fit across test conditions, but offsets between the ATD and child belt fit scores were observed due to anatomical and postural differences between the ATDs and children. The results of this study have broad applicability toward the improvement of occupant restraints for children. The data show substantial effects of booster design on belt fit, particularly the effects of alternative lap and torso belt routing approaches. Regression analyses quantify the critical importance of belt anchorage location for child belt fit, providing an important foundation for efforts to optimize belt geometry for children. The strong correlation between ATD and child belt fit scores means that ATD-based measurements can reliably be used to assess booster and vehicle designs with respect to child belt fit...|$|E

It contains Pottsville and Llewellyn sediments and is of Middle Pennsylvanian age. ^ An abandoned strip mine in the basin contains {{the remains of a}}n in place Paleozoic swamp forest. The basal unit in the swamp sequence is the old soil horizon, a medium gray, unfossiliferous, intensely rooted siltstone. Its top 10 centimeters are well bedded and contain the remains of a litter layer produced by the lycopodpteridosperm dominated forest which stood on this site before it was suffocated by flood waters. The forest 2 ̆ 7 s trunks are well preserved in the overlying black shale which grades into 150 centimeters of allochthonous banded coal. ^ Logs of Lepidodendron rimosum and L. dichotomum dominate this assemblage. In these two species, juvenile trunks are obconical, because the growth of secondary tissues did not keep pace with the increasing diameter of the apical meristem. During this stage, the cushion 2 ̆ 7 s length and width increased with trunk height. After the meristem matured, the trunk continued growing upward in an unbranched state, and the cushions produced at this time were of constant dimensions. In both species, unfavorable environmental conditions affected cushion size. ^ Lepidodendron rimosum accomodated growth of the secondary tissues by expanding the inter-area between cushions. Lepidodendron dichotomum lacked this potential and shed its cushions more quickly. ^ <b>Cushion</b> <b>length</b> decreased drastically in Lepidodendron rimosum just before branching, but not in L. dichotomum.
