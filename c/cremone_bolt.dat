5000|$|An {{espagnolette}} is a locking device, normally {{mounted on}} the vertical frame of a French door or casement window. A handle or knob is connected to a metal rod mounted {{to the surface of}} the frame, at about three or four feet above the floor. Operating the handle rotates the rod, which has hooks at each end that fit into sockets at the head and sill of the opening. This type of lock is often used on a semi-trailer truck to fasten the rear doors. It can be identified by the use of a round bar, instead of a half-round bar used on a <b>crémone</b> <b>bolt.</b>|$|E
