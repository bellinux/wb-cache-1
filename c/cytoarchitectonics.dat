40|$|A {{fundamental}} hypothesis in neuroscience {{proposes that}} underlying cellular architecture (cytoarchitecture) {{contributes to the}} functionality of a brain area. However, this hypothesis has not been tested in human ventral temporal cortex (VTC) that contains domain-specific regions causally involved in perception. To fill this gap in knowledge, we used cortex-based alignment to register functional regions from living participants to <b>cytoarchitectonic</b> areas in ex vivo brains. This novel approach reveals 3 findings. First, there is a consistent relationship between domain-specific regions and <b>cytoarchitectonic</b> areas: each functional region is largely restricted to 1 <b>cytoarchitectonic</b> area. Second, extracting <b>cytoarchitectonic</b> profiles from face- and place-selective regions after back-projecting each region to 20 -μm thick histological sections indicates that <b>cytoarchitectonic</b> properties distinguish these regions from each other. Third, some <b>cytoarchitectonic</b> areas contain more than 1 domain-specific region. For example, face-, body-, and character-selective regions are located within the same <b>cytoarchitectonic</b> area. We summarize these findings with a parsimonious hypothesis incorporating how cellular properties may contribute to functional specialization in human VTC. Specifically, we link computational principles to correlated axes of functional and <b>cytoarchitectonic</b> segregation in human VTC, in which parallel processing across domains occurs along a lateral–medial axis while transformations of information within domain occur along an anterior–posterior axis...|$|R

40|$|The human ventral visual stream {{consists}} of several areas considered processing stages essential for perception and recognition. A fundamental microanatomical feature differentiating areas is cytoarchitecture, {{which refers to}} the distribution, size, and density of cells across cortical layers. Because <b>cytoarchitectonic</b> structure is measured in 20 -micron-thick histological slices of postmortem tissue, {{it is difficult to}} assess (a) how anatomically consistent these areas are across brains and (b) how they relate to brain parcellations obtained with prevalent neuroimaging methods, acquired at the millimeter and centimeter scale. Therefore, the goal {{of this study was to}} (a) generate a cross-validated <b>cytoarchitectonic</b> atlas of the human ventral visual stream on a whole brain template that is commonly used in neuroimaging studies and (b) to compare this atlas to a recently published retinotopic parcellation of visual cortex (Wang, 2014). To achieve this goal, we generated an atlas of eight <b>cytoarchitectonic</b> areas: four areas in the occipital lobe (hOc 1 -hOc 4 v) and four in the fusiform gyrus (FG 1 -FG 4) and tested how alignment technique affects the accuracy of the atlas. Results show that both cortex-based alignment (CBA) and nonlinear volumetric alignment (NVA) generate an atlas with better cross-validation performance than affine volumetric alignment (AVA). Additionally, CBA outperformed NVA in 6 / 8 of the <b>cytoarchitectonic</b> areas. Finally, the comparison of the <b>cytoarchitectonic</b> atlas to a retinotopic atlas shows a clear correspondence between <b>cytoarchitectonic</b> and retinotopic areas in the ventral visual stream. The successful performance of CBA suggests a coupling between <b>cytoarchitectonic</b> areas and macroanatomical landmarks in the human ventral visual stream, and furthermore that this coupling can be utilized towards generating an accurate group atlas. In addition, the coupling between cytoarchitecture and retinotopy highlights the potential use of this atlas in understanding how anatomical features contribute to brain function. We make this <b>cytoarchitectonic</b> atlas freely available in both BrainVoyager and FreeSurfer formats. The availability of this atlas will enable future studies to link between the <b>cytoarchitectonic</b> organization and other parcellations of the human ventral visual stream with potential to advance the understanding of this pathway in typical and atypical populations...|$|R

40|$|Information {{processing}} in {{the brain}} is strongly constrained by anatomical connectivity. However, the principles governing the organization of corticocortical connections remain elusive. Here, we tested three models of relationships between the organization of cortical structure and features of connections linking 49 areas of the cat cerebral cortex. Factors taken into account were relative <b>cytoarchitectonic</b> differentiation (‘structural model’), relative spatial position (‘distance model’), or relative hierarchical position (‘hierarchical model’) of the areas. <b>Cytoarchitectonic</b> differentiation and spatial distance (themselves uncorrelated) correlated strongly with the existence of inter-areal connections, whereas no correlation was found with relative hierarchical position. Moreover, a strong correlation was observed between patterns of laminar projection origin or termination and <b>cytoarchitectonic</b> differentiation. Additionally, <b>cytoarchitectonic</b> differentiation correlated with the absolute number of corticocortical connections formed by areas, and varied characteristically between different cortical subnetworks, including a ‘richclub’ module of hub areas. Thus, connections between areas of the cat cerebral cortex can, to a large part, {{be explained by the}} two independent factors of relative <b>cytoarchitectonic</b> differentiation and spatial distance of brain regions. As both the structural and distance model were originally formulated in the macaque monkey, their applicability in another mammalian species suggests a general principle of global cortical organization...|$|R

50|$|The {{prefrontal cortex}} {{has been defined}} based on <b>cytoarchitectonics</b> by the {{presence}} of a cortical granular layer IV. It is not entirely clear who first used this criterion.

E. Smith, 1907; Brodmann, 1909; von Economo and Koskinas, 1925). In 1935, however, Jacobsen used the term prefrontal to distinguish granular prefrontal areas from agranular motor and premotor areas.

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{describe}} the localization of the <b>cytoarchitectonic</b> subdivisions of the human parietal operculum in stereotaxic space and relate these anatomically defined cortical areas {{to the location of}} the functionally defined secondary somatosensory cortex (SII cortex) using a meta-analysis of functional imaging results. The human parietal operculum consists of four distinct <b>cytoarchitectonic</b> areas (OP 1 - 4) as shown in the preceding publication. The 10 cytoarchitectonically examined brains were 3 -D-reconstructed and spatially normalized to the T 1 -weighted single-subject template of the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI). A probabilistic map was calculated for each area in this standard stereotaxic space. A <b>cytoarchitectonic</b> summary map of the four cortical areas on the human parietal operculum which combines these probabilistic maps was subsequently computed for the comparison with a meta-analysis of functional locations of SII. The meta-analysis used the results from 57 fMRI and PET studies and allowed the comparison of the functionally defined SII region to the <b>cytoarchitectonic</b> map of the parietal operculum. The functional localization of SII showed a good match to the cytoarchitectonically defined region. Therefore the <b>cytoarchitectonic</b> maps of OP 1 - 4 of the human parietal operculum can be interpreted as an anatomical correlate of the (functionally defined) human SII region.

We here analyzed three methods for the definition of ROIs based on probabilistic <b>cytoarchitectonic</b> maps.

The quality with which the thus defined ROIs represented the respective <b>cytoarchitectonic</b> areas as well as their sensitivity for detecting functional activations was subsequently statistically evaluated. Our data showed that the MPM method yields ROIs, which reflect most adequately the underlying anatomical hypotheses. These maps also show a high degree of sensitivity in the statistical analysis. We thus propose the use of MPMs for the definition of ROIs.

40|$|The {{inferior}} {{parietal cortex}} (IPC) integrates information from different sensory modalities and {{plays an important}} role in a variety of higher cognitive functions. Brodmann (Brodmann, K., 1909. Vergleichende Lokalisationslehre der Grosshirnrinde.

Although his scheme was repeatedly challenged by other observers, it is still used for the anatomical localization of functional imaging data. The apparent differences between all these cyto- and myeloarchitectonic maps may be caused partly by the observer-dependent procedure of defining <b>cytoarchitectonic</b> borders by pure visual inspection of histological sections and partly by the interindividual variability of cytoarchitecture. The present observations and the resulting cortical map of the IPC are based on quantitative, observer-independent definitions of <b>cytoarchitectonic</b> borders and take into account each area's topographical variability across brains. Ten human postmortem brains were scanned using an MRI 3 -D FLASH sequence prior to histological processing. After embedding in paraffin, serial sections through whole brains were prepared, and the sections were stained for cell bodies. Following high-resolution digitization of sections containing the IPC, we defined the cytoarchitecture and borders of each cortical area of this brain region using a multivariate statistical analysis of laminar cell density profiles. In contrast to previous observations, we found seven <b>cytoarchitectonic</b> areas in the IPC: five in the rostral (covering the region of BA 40) and two in the caudal part (covering the region of BA 39).

Here, we quantified the morphological features of the MFS in 69 subjects (ages 7 – 40), and investigated its relationship to both <b>cytoarchitectonic</b> and functional divisions of VTC with four main findings.

In the fMRI experiment, verbal fluency was investigated in 11 healthy volunteers, who covertly produced words from predefined categories. A factorial design was used with factors verbal class (semantic vs. overlearned fluency) and switching between categories (no vs. yes). fMRI data analysis employed SPM 99 (Statistical Parametric Mapping). <b>Cytoarchitectonic</b> maps of areas 44 and 45 were derived from histologic sections of 10 postmortem brains. Both the in vivo fMRI and postmortem MR data were warped to a common reference brain using a new elastic warping tool. <b>Cytoarchitectonic</b> probability maps with stereotaxic information about intersubject variability were calculated for both areas and superimposed on the functional data, which showed the involvement of left hemisphere areas with verbal fluency relative to the baseline. Semantic relative to overlearned fluency showed greater involvement of left area 45 than of 44. Thus, although both areas participate in verbal fluency, they do so differentially. Left area 45 is more involved in semantic aspects of language processing, while area 44 is probably involved in high-level aspects of programming speech production per se. The combination of functional data analysis with a new elastic warping tool and <b>cytoarchitectonic</b> maps opens new perspectives for analyzing the cortical networks involved in language...|$|R
