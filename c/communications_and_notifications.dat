The Generalitat uses Catalan in its <b>communications</b> <b>and</b> <b>notifications</b> addressed to the general population, but citizens can also receive information from the Generalitat in Spanish if they so desire. Debates in the Catalan Parliament take place almost exclusively in Catalan and the Catalan public television broadcasts programs only in Catalan.|$|E
50|$|Today, Catalan is the {{language}} of the Catalan autonomous government and the other public institutions that fall under its jurisdiction. Following Catalan Government rules, businesses are required to display all information (e.g. menus, posters) in Catalan under penalty of legal fines; following Spanish Government rules, there's the same obligation to display this information in Spanish; there is no obligation to display this information in Aranese, although there is no restriction on doing so in these or other languages. The use of fines was introduced in a 1997 linguistic law that aims to increase the use of Catalan. According to the law, both Catalan and Spanish - being official languages - can be used by the citizens without prejudice in all public and private activities even though the Generalitat usually uses only Catalan in its <b>communications</b> <b>and</b> <b>notifications</b> addressed to the general population. The citizens can also receive information from the Generalitat in Spanish if they so request. The various media belonging to Catalan government public broadcasting are monolingual in Catalan. However, except for a few hours in Catalan on La 2 and on some radio station, all the media belonging to the Spanish government are Spanish monolingual in Catalonia, as in the rest of Spain. The language policy favouring Catalan consistently implemented by the successive governments ruling the regional government of Catalonia since the 1980s has become increasingly contentious and controversial during the 2000s, especially in public education.|$|E
40|$|Homes are a much discussed, {{but little}} empirically {{examined}} resource for action. Material stuff at home offer resources for social, organisational and individual activities that we routinely encounter and use on an everyday basis. Yet their purposes, storing and sharing practices {{of use and}} roles in social and organisational actions are hardly touched upon within Human Computer Interaction (HCI) and Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) academic literature. As a consequence of this, there are critical gaps in understanding home organisation and management methods {{as a means of}} informing the design of novel technologies. This thesis is an examination of everyday routines in home, paying particular attention to tidying, storing, retrieving and sharing practices. To examine these practices at home, this thesis presents a combination of two qualitative studies using ethnographically oriented methods. Study one (Home’s Tidying up, Storing and Retrieving) concerns the topic of home storage in practice; investigating how householders create and use domestic storage practices and the methods used to manage their storage at home. Study two (Social Interaction around Shared Resources) concerns social interaction around shared resources, and the methods used to manage sharing practices at home. Semi-structured interviews, fieldwork observation, tour around a home, and a photo diary were undertaken to produce a ‘rich’ description of how householders collaborate in storing and sharing set of practices to manage their everyday routines. Several key finding emerged from the research, that are used to identify important implications for design of home organisational technologies, for example to support effective lightweight interactions, providing user controlled mechanism to make different levels of privacy protection for family members, offering effective awareness of family <b>communications</b> <b>and</b> <b>notifications</b> of the activities of other people around these organisation systems, and making available a range of flexible options for family members to access a shared resource. The thesis make the case that flexible systems should be designed allowing people to categorise things in different ways, and have the values of home asserted in technologies, considering factors such as emotion around the use of space in home organisation to make homes become the unique places that they are understood to be.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} an innovating on-line {{monitoring}} {{system that has}} been developed by applying new advances in biosensors, mobile devices and wireless technologies. The aim {{of the system is}} to monitor people that suffer from heart arrhythmias without having to be hospitalized; and therefore, living a normal life while feeling safe at the same time. On the one hand, the architecture of the system is presented; and, on the other hand, some performance results and implementation details are explained showing how the previous solution can be effectively implemented and deployed into a system that makes use of PDAs, and wireless communications: Bluetooth and GPRS. Moreover, special attention is paid to two aspects: cost of the wireless <b>communications</b> <b>and</b> <b>notification</b> latency for the detected serious heart anomalies...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to provide an {{overview}} of the rights and obligations of mobile virtual network operators in the Czech Republic and the corresponding rights and obligations of mobile network operators. The first part of the paper looks at electronic communications in general. It begins with a description of the development of European Union electronic communications legislation, the currently valid Electronic <b>Communications</b> Act <b>and</b> its relation to the Code of Administrative Procedure. The paper then presents the legal regulation of administrative supervision, competition law, public consultation procedure, <b>notification</b> procedure <b>and</b> the procedural regulation of adopting a measure of general nature. The authority and the organization of the Czech Telecommunication Office (CTO) and a classification of the business models used by mobile virtual network operators is then detailed. The second part of the text addresses legal rules directly governing mobile virtual operators, commencing with the legal prerequisites for the provision of electronic <b>communications</b> services <b>and</b> a <b>notification</b> of intention to commence the provision of these services. A thorough exploration of the legal regulation of the access and interconnection and reference offers based upon this regulation is then included. The paper [...] ...|$|R
