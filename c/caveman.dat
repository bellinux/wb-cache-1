5|$|In 1980, {{while on}} the set of the film <b>Caveman,</b> Starr met actress Barbara Bach; they were married on 27 April 1981. In 1985, he {{was the first of the}} Beatles to become a {{grandfather}} upon the birth of Zak's daughter, Tatia Jayne Starkey. Zak Starkey is also a drummer, and during his father's regular absences, he spent time with The Who's Keith Moon. Zak has performed with his father during some All-Starr Band tours. In total, Ringo Starr has seven grandchildren – one from Zak, three from Jason and three from Lee. In 2016, he was the first Beatle to become a great-grandfather.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, it was {{announced}} that Lemmings would be ported to the iOS operating system by developer Mobile 1UP. On 29 June 2010, Mobile 1UP reported that Sony Computer Entertainment Europe had presented them with a cease-and-desist letter, forcing them to halt development of the port. In April 2011, Mobile 1UP has released a re-worked version of the work done in 2010 with a prehistoric setting (new artwork, sfx, music, levels) under the name <b>Caveman,</b> available for the iOS and webOS platforms. Brutal Deluxe, the developer who did the porting of the Apple IIgs version of Lemmings, has released the games' source code.|$|E
5|$|The Blood Beast alien costume {{was also}} {{previously}} {{used in the}} Roger Corman film Teenage <b>Caveman</b> (1958), which was filmed just two weeks earlier. Art director Daniel Haller, who built the rocket-ship and other props, slept at the sound stage between work sessions. Following dissatisfaction with his treatment by the Cormans, Varno pursued two successful arbitration cases, {{one of which was}} for underpayment. The other was in response to Gene Corman's original story writing credit, even though Varno claimed to have written the entire story himself.|$|E
50|$|Stereotypical <b>cavemen</b> {{are also}} often {{featured}} in advertising, including advertisements for Minute Maid. More recently, in early 2004, GEICO launched {{a series of}} television commercials and attempts at viral marketing, collectively known as the GEICO <b>Cavemen</b> advertising campaign, where GEICO announcers are repeatedly denounced by modern <b>cavemen</b> for perpetuating a stereotype of unintelligent, backward <b>cavemen.</b> The GEICO advertisements spawned a short-lived TV series called <b>Cavemen.</b>|$|R

5|$|The goal in each cavern is {{to locate}} both {{the end of}} level door and the special pillar which unlocks it. When stepped on, the pillar {{activates}} a countdown timer, during which the door is open. Once the timer is active, the player must get to the door before the timer ends and the door re-closes. There are multiple bonus games in between levels where the player can amass more treasure. Later levels include <b>caveman</b> villages where the player can purchase new tools with collected treasure as a currency.|$|E
5|$|The older {{route through}} {{downtown}} is a one-way pair on Sixth (southbound) and Seventh (northbound) Streets, entirely overlapping OR 99 to I-5 exit 58, where OR 99 continues with I-5 to the north. The <b>Caveman</b> Bridge, a concrete through arch bridge built in 1927, carries Sixth Street over the Rogue River, while the parallel Seventh Street Bridge is a utilitarian bridge from 1960. The Grants Pass Parkway (Redwood Spur) also crosses the river on a four-lane bridge built in 1990; before that bypass was completed, the spur began downtown on E (southbound) and F (northbound) Streets. Soon after {{the old and}} new routes join, the spur ends at a trumpet interchange with I-5 (exit 55).|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{released}} in North America on June 7, 2011, in Europe on June 8, 2011, in Australia on June 9, 2011, in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Germany on June 10, 2011, and in Japan on July 7, 2011. On February 18, 2011, before the game's release, Special Edition and Hero Edition versions of Infamous 2 were announced for pre-order. The Special Edition included an Original Cole skin, a Golden Amp skin, and the Electrocution Grenade power. The Hero Edition included everything from the Special Edition but also included: a Cole MacGrath statue, a sportable sling pack modeled after Cole’s, a Kessler skin, the Lightning Hook power, a Reaper skin, a Sly Cooper's cane skin, a samurai sword skin, a <b>caveman</b> club skin, the Infamous #1 comic, and Infamous 2 The Red Soundtrack.

50|$|The Stooges hope {{to collect}} a reward by proving to museum curator B. Bopper (Emil Sitka) that <b>cavemen</b> indeed still exist. They embark on an {{expedition}} with 16mm camera in hand, ready to film whatever they find. Eventually, the Stooges return to Bopper with a film showing three <b>cavemen</b> living in the prehistoric age. The film illustrates the three tending to their daily chores, consisting of mixing milk, hunting fish, and gathering eggs. The film also shows the three <b>cavemen</b> defending their women from other fellow <b>cavemen.</b> Bopper is ecstatic, and is preparing to cut the Stooges a check. However, Bopper overhears the sneaky Stooges talking about how the film was a hoax, as they played the <b>cavemen</b> themselves. The curator is furious, and promptly shoots the three frauds in their derrieres, before shooting himself in the foot.|$|R
25|$|In 1960, {{after the}} {{expiration}} of his exclusive contract with Warner Bros., Blanc continued working for WB, but also began providing voices for the TV cartoons produced by Hanna-Barbera; {{his most famous}} roles during this time were Barney Rubble of The Flintstones and Cosmo Spacely of The Jetsons.

25|$|Scooby-Doo {{itself would}} be an {{influence}} on many other Saturday morning cartoons of the 1970s. During that decade, Hanna-Barbera and its competitors produced several animated programs also featuring teenage detectives solving mysteries with a pet or mascot of some sort, including Josie and the Pussycats (1970–71), The Funky Phantom (1971–72), The Amazing Chan and the Chan Clan (1972–73), Speed Buggy (1973–74), Goober and the Ghost Chasers (1973–74), Jabberjaw (1976–78), Captain <b>Caveman</b> and the Teen Angels (1977–80), among others.|$|E
25|$|The Paleolithic diet (also {{called the}} paleo diet, <b>caveman</b> diet or stone-age diet) {{is a modern}} fad diet {{requiring}} the sole or predominant consumption of foods presumed {{to have been the}} only foods either available or consumed by humans during the Paleolithic era. The digestive abilities of anatomically modern humans, however, are different from those of Paleolithic humans, which undermines the diet's core premise. During the 2.6-million-year-long Paleolithic era, the highly variable climate and worldwide spread of human population meant that humans were, by necessity, nutritionally adaptable; in contrast, supporters of the diet presuppose, against the scientific consensus, that human digestion has remained essentially unchanged over time.|$|E

5000|$|In the series, <b>cavemen</b> {{were never}} really fully supplanted by modern humans, but {{integrated}} into Homo sapiens civilization {{as a separate}} species sub-group. <b>Cavemen</b> are a small but widespread minority group that have been present in every global civilization {{since the dawn of}} recorded history (a montage scene in the opening credits shows <b>Cavemen</b> in Egyptian hieroglyphs, when George Washington crossed the Delaware River, standing with Abraham Lincoln, participating in the space program, etc.). Effectively, <b>Cavemen</b> form another ethnic minority in the modern world, which faces several prejudices from Homo sapiens (sometimes referring to humans by the derogatory term [...] "Smoothies" [...] in reference to their relative lack of hair, or [...] "Sapes" [...] in reference to their species). Although these <b>cavemen</b> self-identify as Cro-Magnon, their facial appearance and physical anatomy is reminiscent of the Neanderthal. (In reality, Cro-Magnon were Homo Sapiens.) The writer and producers clearly intended to portray the protagonists as (or like) Homo neanderthalensis, which is anatomically different from modern humans, but sufficiently closely related that they are not always classed as a separate species.|$|R
