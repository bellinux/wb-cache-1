5|$|Around the {{beginning}} of the mating season, adult females move from the periphery towards the central male territories where they become part of short-term ‘harems’ that consist of a male and an unstable group of up to five females. Centrally located males are polygamous, while males on the periphery are monogamous or single. The mating system of the grey-headed flying fox is best described as a lek because males do not provide any essential resources to females and are chosen {{on the basis of their}} physical location within the roost, which <b>correlates</b> <b>with</b> male quality.|$|E

5|$|Expression of Hsp90A also <b>correlates</b> <b>with</b> disease prognosis. Increased {{levels of}} Hsp90A {{are found in}} leukemia, breast and {{pancreatic}} cancers {{as well as in}} patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In human T-cells, HSP90AA1 expression is increased by the cytokines IL-2, IL-4 and IL-13. HSP90, alongside other conserved chaperones and co-chaperones that interact to safeguard proteostasis, is repressed in aging human brains. This repression was found to be further exacerbated in the brains of patients with age-onset neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's or Huntington's disease.|$|E
5|$|Fear {{response}} in women during two {{different points in}} the menstrual cycle has been examined. When estrogen is highest in the preovulatory stage, women are significantly better at identifying expressions of fear than women who were menstruating, which is when estrogen levels are lowest. The women were equally able to identify happy faces, demonstrating that the fear response was a more powerful response. To summarize, menstrual cycle phase and the estrogen levels <b>correlates</b> <b>with</b> women’s fear processing.|$|E

40|$|AbstractPurpose of {{this study}} was to examine the {{relationship}} between personality dimensions and coping styles with stress. Method was correlation study in which 300 students (150 girls, 150 boys) were selected from Malayer University. An extensive analysis was performed to assess the kind of association exist among five personality factors personality (neuroticism, extraversion, openness, agreeableness and conscientiousness) and three coping strategies (problem-focused, positive emotional-focused and negative emotional-focused). All participants were asked to complete the NEO-FFI personality inventory and the Tehran Coping Styles Scale (TCSS). Results indicated that Neuroticism was negatively <b>correlated</b> <b>with</b> positive emotional-focused coping style and was positively <b>correlated</b> <b>with</b> negative emotional-focused coping style in female students, while it was positively <b>correlated</b> <b>with</b> negative emotional-focused coping styles in male students.

40|$|Possible {{involvement}} of an endogenous digitalislike substance (EDLS) {{in blood pressure}} regulation was investigated using a Japanese population. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) significantly <b>correlated</b> <b>with</b> urinary excretion of the EDLS, age, and the obesity index. The plasma EDLS <b>correlated</b> <b>with</b> urinary EDLS. Urinary EDLS excretion well <b>correlated</b> <b>with</b> the inhibitory activity on Na+,K+-ATPase, and also with the urinary excretion of NaCl.

5|$|During early {{childhood}} androgen synthesis and secretion remain low, but {{several years before}} puberty (from 6–8 years of age) changes occur in both anatomical and functional aspects of cortical androgen production that lead to increased secretion of the steroids DHEA and DHEA-S. These changes {{are part of a}} process called adrenarche, which has only been described in humans and some other primates. Adrenarche is independent of ACTH or gonadotropins and <b>correlates</b> <b>with</b> a progressive thickening of the zona reticularis layer of the cortex. Functionally, adrenarche provides a source of androgens for the development of axillary and pubic hair before the beginning of puberty.|$|E
5|$|In 1975 American mycologist Martina S.

A threshold of rainfall is required to elicit a spore discharge response and the duration of peak spore discharge <b>correlates</b> <b>with</b> the amount of rainfall, rather than its duration. Furthermore, Gilliam noted that spore prints were more readily obtained if the stem ends were placed in water, suggesting that water must enter through the fruit body for discharge to occur.|$|E

Wade then covers the origins of the British; contrary to popular belief, he writes, neither the Anglo-Saxons nor the Vikings eradicated the indigenous population, as the Y chromosomes common to Celtic speakers are carried by {{a large percentage of the}} male population of Britain. Markers in these Y chromosomes can be linked to the Basques, and he suggests that the British and Irish descend from a refuge in Spain they shared during the Last Glacial Maximum.|$|E

5|$|Respiration {{involves}} drawing {{water into}} the mantle cavity through an aperture, passing it through the gills, and expelling it through the siphon. The ingress of water is achieved by contraction of radial muscles in the mantle wall, and flapper valves shut when strong circular muscles force the water out through the siphon. Extensive connective tissue lattices support the respiratory muscles {{and allow them to}} expand the respiratory chamber. The lamella structure of the gills allows for a high oxygen uptake; up to 65% in water at 20⁰C.

5|$|There {{are some}} {{exceptions}} to this general rule. Gallium and germanium have higher electronegativities than aluminium and silicon respectively because of the d-block contraction. Elements of the fourth period immediately after the first row of the transition metals have unusually small atomic radii because the 3d-electrons are not effective at shielding the increased nuclear charge, and smaller atomic size <b>correlates</b> <b>with</b> higher electronegativity.
