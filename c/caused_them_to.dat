5|$|After World War II, {{there was}} a {{worldwide}} disbandment of British forts as advances in air defence systems <b>caused</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> become obsolete. Today, the ruins of coastal fortifications are still visible at Labrador Battery, Mount Faber, Fort Siloso and Fort Canning that serve as a lasting reminder of their wartime legacy in Fortress Singapore.|$|E
5|$|In 2010 the Crusaders had a {{very good}} start to the season before a poor finish with three losses in four games <b>caused</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> have to travel to Orlando Stadium, Soweto to face the Bulls. They lost the semi-final 39–24.|$|E
5|$|They {{remained}} {{de facto}} senior officers, but the change <b>caused</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> accelerate {{their plans to}} invade Rwanda. They joined an organisation called the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), a refugee association which had been operating under various names since 1979. Rwigyema became the RPF leader shortly after joining and, while still working for the Ugandan army, he and Kagame completed their invasion plans.|$|E

5|$|A {{hurricane}} in 1844 {{is said to}} have {{wiped out}} the population of Cuban macaws from Pinar del Río. Subsequent hurricanes in 1846 and 1856 further destroyed their habitat in western Cuba and scattered the remaining population. In addition, a tropical storm hit the Zapata Swamp in 1851. With a healthy macaw population, such events could have been beneficial by creating suitable habitat. However, given the species' precarious position, it may have resulted in fragmented habitat and <b>caused</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> seek food in areas where they were more vulnerable to hunting.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of Fort Donelson to Grant's army on February 16, the Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers, two major water routes in the Confederate west, became Union {{waterways}} for movement of troops and material. As Grant suspected, the Union capture of the two forts and the rivers flanked the Confederate forces at Columbus, and soon <b>caused</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> withdraw from that city and from western Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|Alert to {{the danger}} {{presented}} to his scattered ranks, Richard, prudent as ever, halted and regrouped his forces once more after a further pursuit. The Ayyubid cavalry turned once again, showing they still had stomach to renew the fight. However, a third and final charge <b>caused</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> scatter into the woodland where they dispersed into the hills in all directions, showing no inclination to continue the conflict. Richard led his cavalry back to Arsuf where the infantry had pitched camp. During the night the Saracen dead were looted.|$|E

5|$|As {{the game}} proceeds, flashbacks occur showing events in Harris and Klebold's lives {{which may have}} <b>caused</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> commit murder; real life events are {{compressed}} into the game's timeframe for narrative purposes. Much of the plot is constructed around the events precisely as they {{are believed to have}} occurred; lines of the gunmen's dialogue are often lifted verbatim from their writings or from their own home videos of each other. In contrast to the 16-bit graphics are digitized photographs from the shooting or full voice samples from news reports; photos of the school are used as backdrops during battle scenes.|$|E
5|$|But on {{the wings}} the {{situation}} was different. Qanatir, commanding the Byzantine left flank which consisted of mainly Slavs, attacked in force, and the Muslim infantry on the right flank had to retreat. Amr, the Muslim right wing commander ordered his cavalry regiment to counterattack, which neutralized the Byzantine advance and stabilized the battle line on the right for some time, but the Byzantine numerical superiority <b>caused</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> retreat towards the Muslim base camp.|$|E
5|$|CGW {{said the}} in-game combat became a {{confusing}} mess once allies became involved, {{in part due}} to poor Artificial Intelligence (AI) that <b>caused</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> use powers liberally and become low on blood as a result. The AI was considered to be insufficient for the game; pathfinding failures meant allies would become stuck on environmental objects or each other during combat, use up their costliest abilities on enemies regardless of their threat, and were poor at staying alive in battle. Enemies were similarly dismissed for either not noticing the playable character in obvious circumstances or failing to respond to attacks on themselves.|$|E

5|$|Deprived of {{his left}} wing (still {{in pursuit of the}} Norman right), Alexios was exposed in the centre. Guiscard sent his heavy cavalry against the Byzantine centre. They first routed the Byzantine skirmishers before {{breaking}} into small detachments and smashing into various points of the Byzantine line. This charge broke the Byzantine lines and <b>caused</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> rout. The imperial camp, which had been left unguarded, fell to the Normans.|$|E
5|$|Ferrari's team orders <b>caused</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> {{be fined}} $100,000 by the race {{stewards}} but avoided further punishment from the FIA World Motor Sport Council in September 2010. The result meant Alonso reduced the points deficit to be 13 behind Vettel in the Drivers' Championship, while leader Lewis Hamilton extended his advantage over teammate Jenson Button by two points. Red Bull slightly reduced the deficit to McLaren in the Constructors' Championship, while Ferrari moved further ahead of Mercedes, with eight races {{left in the}} season.|$|E
5|$|Lody {{was unaware}} that his latest letters had {{galvanised}} the British authorities into action. They had hitherto been content with merely monitoring his communications but the militarily significant content {{of his most}} recent letters <b>caused</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> consider him now {{to be a serious}} threat. It did not take them long to catch up with him. His lack of even basic security precautions had left the authorities with a trail of clues that enabled them to track him down in less than a day.|$|E

5|$|Ministers of {{the church}} {{reported}} that {{the site of a}} newly constructed temple in Silao was subject to harassment of its members, vandalism, and physical threats because of religious intolerance, which <b>caused</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> request increased police protection. In February 2012, seventy ministers of La Luz del Mundo from different nations appeared before Mexican authorities in Guadalajara to denounce the lack of police protection for the church's residents in the city after a series of attacks left several members hospitalized.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the advent}} of {{industrial}} whaling, great whales {{may have been the}} major food source for killer whales. The introduction of modern whaling techniques may have aided killer whales by the sound of exploding harpoons indicating availability of prey to scavenge, and compressed air inflation of whale carcasses causing them to float, thus exposing them to scavenging. However, the toll on great whale populations by unfettered whaling had possibly reduced their availability as prey for killer whales, and <b>caused</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> expand their consumption of smaller marine mammals, thus contributing to their decline as well.|$|E
5|$|The Behar {{survivors}} were maltreated {{by members}} of Tones crew. Japanese sailors forced the survivors to hand over all their personal belongings of any value, and then used ropes to tie the survivors in painful positions which <b>caused</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> have difficultly breathing. The merchant ship's chief officer was beaten after he complained that treating civilians {{in such a way}} violated the Geneva Convention. However, the female survivors later had their ropes removed. When the survivors were taken below decks to be imprisoned they were badly beaten by Japanese sailors.|$|E

50|$|Traditional {{methods of}} {{removing}} creases and flattening parchment through humidifying have been {{detrimental to the}} state of any pigments, <b>causing</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> come off the parchment slightly. This is because the parchment and pigments take on and give off moisture at different rates, <b>causing</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> expand and contract at varying rates and thus loosening the pigment from the surface. This results in flaking, cupping, and cracking.|$|R
5|$|The Shasekishū, {{a book of}} Buddhist parables {{from the}} Kamakura period, {{makes a point of}} {{distinguishing}} between good and bad tengu. The book explains that the former are in command of the latter and are the protectors, not opponents, of Buddhism– although the flaw of pride or ambition has <b>caused</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> fall onto the demon road, they remain the same basically good, dharma-abiding persons they were in life.|$|E
5|$|The West Side Boys were unstable, {{possibly}} due to prolonged use of cannabis and cocaine, {{and their}} behaviour {{during the crisis}} was erratic. After their release, the five soldiers described an incident in which Kallay, dissatisfied with their explanation, conducted a mock execution in which he threatened to shoot the soldiers unless they told him why they had entered the West Side Boys' territory. The gang's drug habits also posed {{a problem for the}} British negotiators as the cannabis <b>caused</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> forget previous discussions and the cocaine made them distrustful.|$|E
