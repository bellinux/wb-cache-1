Convection finally increased once the wave entered the Caribbean Sea on August27; however, it was not until August30 when interaction with a Kelvin wave spurred organization. An area of low pressure consolidated within the system as it crossed the Yucatán Peninsula on August31. Formation of a banding feature along the southeastern portion of the circulation on September1 marked the system's transition into {{a tropical}} depression by 18:00UTC while over the Bay of Campeche. Although situated over warm waters of , strong wind shear created an unfavorable environment and hindered intensification. During this formative stage, the depression tracked northward as its center relocated before turning to the northwest and later west. It was uncertain if a closed circulation truly existed due to <b>conflicting</b> <b>data</b> and the depression could have remained a trough until the afternoon of September2.|$|E

50|$|Lack of robust <b>conflict</b> <b>data</b> {{remains a}} major problem with all {{attempts}} to track conflict numbers and fatality trends. The Uppsala <b>Conflict</b> <b>Data</b> Program's has an acknowledged tendency to undercount fatalities. But the tendency to undercount does not obscure trends, and both researchers and policymakers who focus on the causes {{of war and peace}} are more concerned with trends--are the number of wars/battle deaths increasing or decreasing?--than in absolute numbers. For truth and reconciliation commissions, the reverse is true. There are various methodologies {{that can be used to}} estimate war deaths--incident-based reporting like that undertaken by the Uppsala <b>Conflict</b> <b>Data</b> Program, nationwide retrospective mortality surveys like those undertaken in Iraq and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and censuses. Each has strengths and weaknesses. Uppsala's methodology is, however, the only one that permits timely annual updates for all conflict-affected countries. There are ongoing debates on the validity of data compiling and counting methodology. Part III of the Human Security Report 2009/2010 contains a discussion of these debates.|$|R

According to data quoted by UNICEF, 23% of pumps in rural areas are out of service {{because of a lack of}} maintenance. According to data quoted by the World Bank, of the more than 50,000 water points in rural areas 33,000 (8,000 “modern wells” and 25,000 boreholes equipped with handpumps) are functioning, i.e. more than one third of wells are out of service. Of 570 small piped systems in rural areas, 400 are functioning, i.e. also almost one third are not functioning.|$|E
25|$|Accepting {{that the}} <b>conflicting</b> <b>data</b> in the typed report's flight times indeed require both northward and southward ground speeds {{greater than the}} flight's eighty-five mph airspeed, a Byrd defender posits a westerly-moving {{anti-cyclone}} that tailwind-boosted Byrd's ground speed on both outward and inward legs, allowing the distance claimed to be covered in the time claimed (the theory is based on rejecting handwritten sextant data in favor of typewritten alleged dead-reckoning data). This suggestion has been challenged by Dennis Rawlins who adds that the sextant data in the long unavailable original official typewritten report are all expressed to 1", a precision not possible on Navy sextants of 1926 and not the precision of the sextant data in Byrd's diary for 1925 or the 1926 flight, which was normal (half or quarter of a minute of arc).|$|E

500|$|Interaction {{with land}} caused slight weakening; however, Dennis soon emerged over the Gulf of Guacanayabo and the region's shallow, warm waters fueled an abrupt reorganization. The {{hurricane}} traveled {{along the western}} spine of the Jardines de la Reina archipelago, subjecting the islands to Category3 and 4 strength winds.

[...] The PAST data placed it in section B, while the D-loop data placed it in section C. [...] The relationship between the small-toothed sportive lemur, an eastern Malagasy species, and a group of species from the west coast of Madagascar suggests that the ancestral population of the small-toothed sportive lemur dispersed to its current range from western Madagascar using river corridors.

2500|$|Yellowfin whiting reach sexual {{maturity}} at {{a length of}} 200 mm in males and 230mm in females, {{with the majority of}} both sexes reaching this length by the end of their second year of life. The timing of spawning varies over the species range, a trait found {{in a number of other}} sillaginids. In the northernmost part of its range in Shark Bay, spawning occurs between August and December, while further south off southern Western Australia, spawning occurs between December and February. The South Australian population also spawns between December and February, with this event preceded by the movement of fish into shallow tidal and estuarine regions where spawning occurs. Ripe fish then break off the main schooling body to form smaller spawning schools, where the eggs are shed. There is <b>conflicting</b> <b>data</b> concerning the pattern of spawning in yellowfin whiting, with an earlier Shark Bay study finding the species to be a single spawner, [...] whilst recent studies in the south indicate they are multiple spawners. In South Australia, once spawning has occurred the fish disperse and move further offshore once again.|$|E
40|$|We {{develop a}} three-step {{computing}} approach {{to explore a}} hierarchical ranking network for a society of captive rhesus macaques. The computed network is sufficiently informative to address the question: Is the ranking network for a rhesus macaque society more like a kingdom or a corporation? Our computations {{are based on a}} three-step approach. These steps are devised to deal with the tremendous challenges stemming from the transitivity of dominance as a necessary constraint on the ranking relations among all individual macaques, and the very high sampling heterogeneity in the behavioral <b>conflict</b> <b>data.</b> The first step simultaneously infers the ranking potentials among all network members, which requires accommodation of heterogeneous measurement error inherent in behavioral data.
