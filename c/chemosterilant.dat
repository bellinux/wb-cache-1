40|$|The sterile-male {{technique}} {{has been considered}} to be a promising tool for the control of mosquito populations. Many <b>chemosterilants</b> are known to sterilize insects effectively {{in the same way as}} ionizing radiations. The sterilizing activity of 8 alkylating aziridinyl compounds has been assessed on the tropical house-mosquito, Culex pipiens fatigans Wiedemann. The <b>chemosterilants</b> employed for larval and pupal treatments were apholate, metepa, tepa and 5 diaziridinyl alkoxyphosphine oxides. In general, metepa was least toxic to the various life stages of C. p. fatigans during the treatment. Apholate was toxic only in pupal treatments while tepa was less toxic in pupal treatments and more toxic in larval treatments. Diaziridinyl compounds were moderately toxic in both larval and pupal treatments. The tepa and apholate treatments caused certain structural and moulting abnormalities in pupae and adults and also induced abnormalities in eggs and larvae...|$|R

50|$|A <b>chemosterilant</b> is any {{chemical}} compound {{used to control}} economically destructive or disease-causing pests (usually insects) by causing temporary or permanent sterility of {{one or both of}} the sexes or preventing maturation of the young to a sexually functional adult stage. The mating of sterilized insects with fertile insects produces no offspring, and if the number of sterile insects is kept constant, the percentage of sterile insects will increase, and fewer young will be produced in each successive generation. Chemosterilants should be applied in the larval or pupal stage of the insect to give rise to sterile adults or in the newly emerged adults before they become sexually mature.|$|E

40|$|The {{results of}} a search for {{chemicals}} affecting the reproduction of the two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch are recorded. The arrhenotokous type of reproduction of the spider mites has meant that male sterilization does not hold any great advantage over female sterilization. The present investigation was therefore concentrated on chemicals suppressing reproduction in the females. Contiguous to this study is {{a review of the}} literature with particular reference to the range of chemicals which can act as <b>chemosterilants,</b> the processes of chemical induction of sterility, and the biology and habits of T. urticae. An understanding of the latter is of fundamental importance before any application of <b>chemosterilants</b> can be contemplated. Preliminary tests with candidate <b>chemosterilants</b> were carried out and of those chemicals showing activity, the trialkyl phosphate group was selected for further study owing to the relatively low toxicity, ease of synthesis and sterilizing properties of some chemicals in this group. Trimethyl phosphate, triethyl phosphate, dimethyl methylphosphonate and diethyl cyanomethylphosphonate reduced egg lay and egg hatch while trimethyl thiophosphate reduced egg lay alone. Experiments indicated that trimethyl phosphate was a more active reproduction suppressant than trimethyl phosphate but showed a degree of chemical instability. Triethyl phosphate was therefore used for comparison with diethyl cyanomethylphosphonate for residual effects and the permanency of sterility induced by the chemicals. Diethyl cyanomethylphosphonate had greater residual properties and the sterility was more permanent suggesting that diethyl cyanomethylphosphonate would have greater effects than triethyl phosphate on the mite populations if these chemicals were used for population suppression...|$|R
40|$|Interest in {{sterilization}} as {{a possible}} method for controlling insects of public health importance {{can be said to}} have arisen first in the mid-fifties, when the screw-worm fly was successfully eradicated from the island of Curaçao by the release over the entire island of large numbers of male flies sterilized by gamma-radiation. Since then, many studies on the sterilization of various insect vectors of disease have been carried out. This paper reviews these studies and discusses the present position regarding vector control by sterilization procedures, with special reference to the use of <b>chemosterilants.</b> These compounds have certain advantages over radiation since they can be used not only as a substitute for X-rays or gamma-rays in the sterilization of insects specially reared for release in large numbers, but also as a means of inducing sterility in natural populations of insects. The author emphasizes that <b>chemosterilants</b> cannot at present be recommended as a practical control or eradication procedure for any vector species of insect, but considers that this extension of the sterilization method holds great promise and merits intensive investigation...|$|R

40|$|Red-winged Blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) {{are one of}} {{the primary}} species of birds {{contributing}} to agricultural damage throughout the United States. Methods have been developed for reducing the damage they cause to ripening corn (De Grazio et al. 1971; 1972), sprouting corn (Stickley and Guarino, 1972), ripening rice (DeHaven et al. 1971), and windrowed peanuts (Mott et al. 1972). These methods frighten or repel Redwings from crops; however, in some situations, techniques are also needed to manage specific problem-bird populations by reducing their numbers. At present, the primary methods for reducing large numbers of problem birds involve the use of chemical toxicants and wetting agents. These methods are often only temporary and, in this age of environmental awareness, generally are not accepted by the public. The proper use of avian <b>chemosterilants</b> for population reduction should be safer, more specific, and more acceptable; it could, in fact, be more effective. For example, Knipling (1959) showed mathematically that it was more efficient to control insect populations by sterilizing males than by killing them. Further, in territorial birds, if a sterilized individual continues to occupy and defend its territory, the breeding habitat is made less productive. With these advantages in mind, personnel of the Section of Bird Damage Control at the Denver Wildlife Research Center began to investigate the possibilities of reducing Red-winged Blackbird populations by <b>chemosterilants</b> in 1969...|$|R

Some emphasis is currently being placed on the development of <b>chemosterilant</b> techniques. Many of the studies have been concerned with the screening of potentially active chemicals, whereas other research has dealt with the efficacy of field application. The more basic work has been accomplished through the participation of several disciplines. The {{purpose of this study was}} to characterize the effects and mode of action of a particular <b>chemosterilant,</b> metepa (tris [1 -(2 methyl) aziridinyl] phosphine oxide) on the large milkweed bug, Oncopeltus fasciatus (Dallas).

40|$|Despite {{more than}} 4 decades of effort, {{development}} of effective wildlife damage control programs based on sterilization of target species {{has met with}} limited success. This {{is partly due to}} the fact that investigators have assumed, rather than empirically tested, whether the reproductive strategies of the target populations were vulnerable to the planned treatment. Equally important, methods selected to induce sterility usually involve a chemical agent that can affect sociosexual behaviors of the nuisance population. In this report, we illustrate how surgically induced sterility circumvents both problems-how it enables one to assess the feasibility and applicability of the concept without the potentially confounding secondary effects of a chemical. We assessed the merits of initiating research to develop a male <b>chemosterilant</b> for Norway rats, red-winged blackbirds, beaver, and Canada geese by inducing sterility surgically. The infidelity of many red-winged females to their polygnous territorial male was surprising and argued against searching for a male sterilant. On the other hand, beaver and Canada goose studies confirmed previous reports that both form pair-bonds and are monogamous. Both should be vulnerable to a male <b>chemosterilant</b> approach, and research toward this goal is justified...|$|E
40|$|Domestic rodents, {{particularly}} {{those living in}} urban populations, represent a serious public health problem, and effective control measures are required {{to deal with this}} threat to human health. Because of the characteristic interactions between individual animals, certain behaviour patterns occur in rodent populations that are of particular concern to control biologists. The genus Rattus is an extremely diverse group whose ecological requirements are variable and flexible, while the genus Mus, on account of its small size, limited range, and modest requirements in terms of food and water, is also very difficult to control. For any control operation a knowledge of the growth dynamics of domestic rodent populations is needed; after a period of logarithmic growth, population increases cease when the habitat is fully exploited. Consequently, control operations that merely remove some animals lead only to renewed population growth. Trapping, poisoning, and predation are traditional control measures of this kind. Environmental modification is a more certain, but more difficult, approach. The use of <b>chemosterilants</b> offers some hope of radical control in the future, but at present, although some field trials have been made, these substances are not available for general use, one reason being their lack of specificity. Another problem connected with the use of <b>chemosterilants</b> is that, on account of the sexual behaviour and physiology of domestic rodents, it would be necessary to reach nearly 100 % of the population to obtain effective control...|$|R
40|$|Many aziridinyl {{compounds}} {{are known}} to induce high sterility in Culex pipiens fatigans Wiedemann, but as the practical application of these <b>chemosterilants</b> is quite hazardous, compounds such as phosphoramides and s-triazines have been tried against this species.

40|$|The <b>chemosterilant</b> ornitrol {{was tested}} {{as a means}} of {{reducing}} egg production in feral pigeons on the central campus of Bowling Green State University. Ornitrol (0. 1 % by weight), coated on whole-kernel corn, was baited on building rooftops for 1 O-day periods in 1982 and 1983. Weekly post-treatment nest monitoring indicated that ornitrol does not inhibit egg-laying, but 16 - 29 % of all eggs laid were infertile. This increase in egg infertility over the pre-treatment period was significant. However, because pigeons breed throughout the year on campus, it is estimated that this reduction in productivity would have no major impact on the population. A limited laboratory trial indicated that pigeons feeding on untreated corn ate significantly more food than did treated birds. Egg-laying was inhibited in two of three pairs treated for 10 days and was nearly complete in three pairs treated for 20 days. However, pigeons in the 20 -day group became lethargic, and one bird died after treatment. It appears that the chemical, at an average dosage of 0. 3 g <b>chemosterilant</b> per bird, acted more as a debilitating agent than as a sterilant.

40|$|Summary. U- 5897 (3 -chloro- 1, 2 -propanediol) is an {{effective}} male rat <b>chemosterilant.</b> Sterility results from a lesion in the initial segment of the caput epididymidis. Minimal amounts required to develop lesions consistently are daily oral doses of 35 mg/kg body weight or one 45 mg/kg dose. The immediate consequences of the lesion are sperm blockage in ductuli efferentes and testicular swelling. Fluid accumulation in the testis causes pressure degeneration of the germinal epithelium. Testicular damage does not include morphological or functional (coitus, vaginal plugs, limited spermatogenesis) impairment of Leydig cells. U- 5897 is thought to cause local ischaemia, with resultant epithelial desquamation which blocks the caput epididymidis. This {{is followed by the}} formation of spermatocoeles, sperm granulomata, and fibrosis. Males made sterile with such a lesion had normal libido with seventy-one matings out of seventy-seven opportunities (92 %) over a 64 -day period. Adult rats given a single oral dose of 90 to 100 mg/kg of U- 5897 still had lesions blocking sperm passage when killed at 3 -month intervals over at least 12 months. Although sterile, they continued to mateand enjoyed good general health. Testes were small due to many non-functional seminiferous tubules but spermatogenesis continued in a few tubules. Compound acceptance and potency, route and length of administration, and biological effec-tiveness make U- 5897 and the concept of a male <b>chemosterilant</b> worthy of practical consideration...|$|E

These have little immediate pharmacological action, but are notable for their selective action against haematopoietic and some other proliferating tissues. A number of alkylating agents {{have been shown to}} be mutagens in insects, bacteria, fungi, and higher plants; carcinogens in mammals; and teratogens in insects, birds, and mammals.

40|$|Among {{several factors}} that {{influence}} silk yield, insect and non-insect pests form an important component. Of the insects that attack silkworm, the most important are the tachinid parasites which {{are commonly known as}} ujiflies. There are at least four species of ujifly that attack silkworms viz., Japanese ujifly, Crossocosmia sericariae (Rondani); Hime ujifly, Ctenophorocera pavida (Meigen); Tasar ujifly, Blepharipa zebina (Walker) and the Indian ujifly, Exorista bombycis (Louis). This review discusses distribution and history, taxonomy and bio-ecology of the ujifly. Among the different management practices used, cultural methods such as exclusion, i. e. fitting fly-proof wire mesh screens to the windows, ventilators and doors of rearing rooms and securing fly proof nylon net to individual trays, are found to be the most eco-friendly and economical.
