This study aims to understand the origin of such diversity in surface water, which is a key aspect for the wetland services and biodiversity in the region. Both soil observations and water samples were collected at the regional or local scale and supplemented by previously published data sets.

Despite great differences in chemical composition, all surface waters in the region belong to the same chemical family, corresponding to several concentration stages of the Taquari River water that supplies the region.

40|$|The {{ultrafiltration}} (UF) with diafiltration is the state-of-the-art {{process in}} the bulk pharmaceutical industry to separate solutions containing high and low molecular weight solutes. By applying UF with diafiltration, a feed stream can be separated into a concentrate with {{a high concentration of}} high molecular weight solutes and a permeate, which is nearly 100 % free of high molecular weight solutes. The UF with diafiltration process commonly consists of three stages that include a preconcentration stage achieving similar concentrations of low molecular weight components in retentate and permeate, a diafiltration stage to purify retentate by addition of a diafiltration liquid, and a final <b>concentration</b> <b>stage</b> to maximize the concentration of high molecular weight solutes in retentate. UF combined with diafiltration is used after the fermentation to separate the citric acid from the biomass. The UF permeate can then be further purified by using reverse osmosis (RO) /nanofiltration (NF) to remove any remaining impurities such as biomass, salts, and sucrose and thus minimizing the posttreatment. The purified citric acid is then mixed with calcium carbonate resulting in calcium citrate containing approximately 75 % of citric acid.

40|$|A dynamic {{equilibrium}} {{model has}} been proposed to describe the coalbed methane concentration-dissipation evolution process in coal. including its generation, storage and migration. The model, developed with a computational program, {{has been applied to}} the Qinshui basin, China, which allows to evaluate features of coal seam of the basin including coal quality and burial, palaeo-geothermal field, and coal organic material maturation evolution history. The simulation study was focused on coalbed methane concentration-dissipation evolution history of the upper and lower main coal seams in the basin. The results indicate that the whole evolution process can be divided into three stages. At the first stage, i. e. the primary <b>concentration</b> <b>stage,</b> gas generation quantity and gas content were lower and only weak diffusion took place. The second stage can be called the active concentration-dissipation stage. During this period, coal organic material was matured at a higher rate, generating a large amount of gas because of abnormal high palaeo-geothermal field in the Middle and Late Yanshan Epoch. As a result, gas content in coal reservoir was higher and gas could be lost in different ways including diffusion, cap outburst and permeation. The third stage can be defined as the absolute dissipation stage at which coal organic material no longer generates gas. Meanwhile much gas was lost mainly by diffusion and partly by permeation. Simulation results further show that, although the high gas generation led to active dissipation in the coal reservoir, there still remains comparatively high gas content on the south and north ends of the Qinshui basin due to the preserving geological conditions. This suggests that these regions are favorable for coalbed methane exploitation which has been confirmed by recent geological exploitations in Qinshui basin. (c) 2007 Published by Elsevier B.

Material and Method: A total of 106 patients with SCLC, between 2005 and 2008, were retrospectively analyzed. Results: The median age of patients at diagnosis was 59. 3 and 89. 6 % of patients were male; 33. 1 % of patients were older than 65 years and 73 patients were younger than 65 years of age. 54 out of 106 patients had limited stage disease (LSD) (52. 9 %), and 48 had extended stage disease (ESD) (47. 1 %). The ratio of PS 0 - 1 and 2 patients were 77. 3 % and 22. 7 % respectively. 36 % of them had high serum LDH level and 29. 3 % had low hemoglobin level. In our study, clinical response was achieved in 71. 2 % of patients. Overall median survival was 14. 2 months.

40|$|In recent years, the Knelson Concentrator {{has become}} the {{predominant}} unit used for primary gold recovery by gravity. However, its application potential as a cleaner in the final gravity <b>concentration</b> <b>stage</b> and its separation mechanisms have not been well studied. In most Canadian gold mills, rougher gravity concentrates produced by the Knelson (operating at 60 gravity acceleration or 'g') are further upgraded with shaking tables, non-centrifuge units operating at one 'g'. As a result, tabling results in significant gold losses (mainly fines). It is also labour intensive and represents a security risk {{because of the high}} gold content of the material being processed. The main objectives of this research, therefore, are to study the separation mechanisms of the Knelson Concentrator and to explore its potential application as a cleaner to supplement, or even to replace, tabling. A methodology based on the use of synthetic feeds (tungsten, silica and magnetite) was designed to study the performance and mechanisms of a 7. 5 cm Knelson. Four types of gangue were used, both fine and coarse silica and magnetite. The fluidization water flowrate was optimized for each gangue type, and the Knelson was then overloaded by feeding a high-grade feed. The extent of overload was found to be highly dependent on the size distribution and density of the gangue processed, from severe and immediate with coarse magnetite to non-existent with fine silica. A two-parameter model to describe the overload was derived, which showed a good fit with the experimental data. Two separable bowls were designed to analyze the nature of the material recovered in the five grooves of the Knelson bowl. It was found that the densest minerals, such as tungsten and gold, were mainly recovered in the inner groove sections, closest to the rotating axis. The outer sections packed {{at the beginning of the}} recovery cycle and served mostly to distribute fluidization water evenly. Three modified Knelson bowls, a cleaner bowl equipped with a filter at the bottom of each groove, the other two with different groove depth and fluidization water flowrate distribution, were tested using the synthetic feed methodology. Results generally confirmed the soundness of the basic designs of the conventional and cleaning bowls. The importance of superficial fluidization water velocity was also demonstrated. Recovery of gold with the 7. 5 cm Knelson from seven samples of gold table tails from different Canadian gold mills was tested. Recovery significantly increased when the coarser, largely barren fraction was removed prior to processing. Concentrate grade significantly increased, up to 60 % Au, by feeding a magnetite "filler" prior to the recovery cycle, and removing it magnetically at the end of the test, to mimic the effect of the cleaner bowl...|$|E
