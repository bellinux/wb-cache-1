While other systems were popping {{up with more}} horse-drawn carriages or cable cars, Lowry pushed forward with electrification of the lines. Starting in the late-1880s, electric streetcars began moving in both Minneapolis and St. Paul. Cable cars quickly lost favor as they struggled through snowy Minnesota winters and the public quickly grew weary of slow horsecars.|$|E

Although planned for a service introduction in 1938, the Ju 88 finally entered squadron service (with only 12 aircraft) {{on the first}} day of the invasion of Poland in 1939. Production was painfully slow, with only one Ju 88 manufactured per week, as problems continually kept <b>cropping</b> <b>up.</b> The Ju 88C series of heavy fighter was also designed very early in 1940, but kept secret from Göring, as he only wanted bombers.|$|E
25|$|Fleming {{was the son}} of John Fleming, {{a general}} trader and mercer of Newport on the Isle of Wight, and his wife Dorothy Harris.

The Fleming family line had strong historical connections to the Isle of Wight, with several mentions of the name <b>cropping</b> <b>up</b> in previous historical documents and books.

25|$|The {{concept of}} movable type was not {{new in the}} 15th century; movable type {{printing}} had been invented in China during the Song dynasty, and was later used in Korea during the Goryeo Dynasty, where metal movable-type printing technology was developed in 1234. In Europe, sporadic evidence that the typographical principle, {{the idea of creating}} a text by reusing individual characters, was well understood and employed in pre-Gutenberg Europe had been <b>cropping</b> <b>up</b> since the 12th century and possibly before. The known examples range from Germany (Prüfening inscription) to England (letter tiles) to Italy. However, the various techniques employed (imprinting, punching and assembling individual letters) did not have the refinement and efficiency needed to become widely accepted.|$|E
25|$|In 2000s, {{the video}} game {{industry}} is a juggernaut of development; profit still drives technological advancement which is then used by other industry sectors. Technologies such as Smartphones, virtual reality and augmented reality are major drivers for game hardware and gameplay development. Though maturing, {{the video game}} industry was still very volatile, with third-party video game developers quickly <b>cropping</b> <b>up,</b> and just as quickly, going out of business. Nevertheless, many casual games and indie games were developed and become popular and successful, such as Braid and Limbo. Game development for mobile phones (such as iOS and Android devices) and social networking sites emerged. For example, a Facebook game developer, Zynga, has raised in excess of $300 million.|$|E
25|$|Bayonetta is {{voiced by}} Hellena Taylor in English and Atsuko Tanaka in Japanese. For the {{original}} game, despite production being based in Japan, Kamiya was particular {{to insist that}} the character have an English voice actor, and had no Japanese voice actor assigned due to his belief that speaking Japanese would not suit the character. Tanaka first voiced the character in the anime , an adaptation of the original Bayonetta, and subsequently assumed the role in Bayonetta 2 and the re-release of the original title on Wii U. Tanaka also voiced the character in commercials for the original game in 2009. She was chosen {{due to the fact that}} her name kept <b>cropping</b> <b>up</b> when the team asked who could best portray the character in Japanese.|$|E

25|$|The {{present state}} of Chhattisgarh was carved out of Madhya Pradesh on 1 November 2000. The demand for a {{separate}} state was first raised in the 1920s. Similar demands kept <b>cropping</b> <b>up</b> at regular intervals; however, a well-organised movement was never launched. Several all-party platforms were formed and they usually resolved around petitions, public meetings, seminars, rallies and strikes. A demand for separate Chhattisgarh was raised in 1924 by the Raipur Congress unit and also discussed in the Annual Session of the Indian Congress at Tripuri. A discussion also took place of forming a Regional Congress organisation for Chhattisgarh. When the State Reorganisation Commission {{was set up in}} 1954, the demand for a separate Chhattisgarh was put forward, but was not accepted. In 1955, a demand for a separate state was raised in the Nagpur assembly of the then state of Madhya Bharat.|$|E
25|$|Just {{how long}} the {{trajectory}} could continue, however, remained unclear. According to the 11th five-year plan, China needed to sustain an annual growth rate of 8% for the foreseeable future. Only with such levels of growth, the leadership argued, could China continue to develop its industrial prowess, raise its citizen's standard of living, and redress the inequalities that were <b>cropping</b> <b>up</b> across the country. Yet no country had ever before maintained the kind of growth that China was predicting. Moreover, China had to some extent already undergone the easier parts of development. In the 1980s, it had transformed its vast and inefficient agricultural sector, freeing its peasants from the confines of central planning and winning them {{to the cause of}} reform. In the 1990s, it had likewise started to restructure its stagnant industrial sector, wooing foreign investors for the first time. These policies had catalysed the country's phenomenal growth. Instead, China had to take what many regarded as the final step toward the market, liberalizing the banking sector and launching the beginnings of a real capital market. According to an article in Journal of the Asia Pacific Economy by Mete Feridun of University of Greenwich Business School and Abdul Jalil from Wuhan University in China, financial development leads to a reduction in the income inequality in China. This process, however, would not be easy. As of 2004, China's state-owned enterprises were still only partially reorganized, and its banks were dealing with the burden of over $205 billion (1.7 trillion RMB) in non-performing loans, monies that had little chance of ever being repaid. The country had a floating exchange rate, and strict controls on both the current and capital accounts.|$|E

500|$|Dave Marsh was {{the first}} music critic to employ the term punk rock: In the May 1971 issue of Creem, he {{described}} ? and the Mysterians, {{one of the most}} popular 1960s garage rock acts, as giving a [...] "landmark exposition of punk rock". Later in 1971, in his fanzine Who Put the Bomp, Greg Shaw wrote about [...] "what I have chosen to call [...] "punkrock" [...] bands—white teenage hard rock of '64–66 (Standells, Kingsmen, Shadows of Knight, etc.)". Lester Bangs used the term [...] "punk rock" [...] in several articles written in the early 1970s to refer to mid-1960s garage acts. In his June 1971 piece in Creem, [...] "Psychotic Reactions and Carburetor Dung," [...] he wrote, [...] "then punk bands started <b>cropping</b> <b>up</b> who were writing their own songs but taking the Yardbirds' sound and reducing it to this kind of goony fuzztone clatter. ... oh, it was beautiful, it was pure folklore, Old America, and sometimes I think those were the best days ever." ...|$|E
500|$|In the 1960s, garage rock had no {{name and}} was not {{thought of as a}} genre, but as typical {{elemental}} rock of the period. [...] When it began to be recognised in the early 1970s, [...] "garage rock" [...] was not the name initially prescribed. [...] Between 1971-1973 certain rock critics began to speak nostalgically of mid-1960s garage bands (and artists perceived to be in their tradition) as a genre and for several years used the term [...] "punk rock" [...] to characterize it, making it the first musical form to bear the description. [...] Conjuring up the mid-1960s, Lester Bangs in 1971 wrote: [...] "...then punk bands started <b>cropping</b> <b>up</b> who were writing their own songs but taking the Yardbirds' sound and reducing it to this kind of goony fuzztone clatter... oh, it was beautiful, it was pure folklore, Old America, and sometimes I think those were the best days ever".|$|E

[...] Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times especially praised Pinza's performance: [...] "Mr. Pinza's bass voice is the most beautiful that has been heard on a Broadway stage for an eon or two.
