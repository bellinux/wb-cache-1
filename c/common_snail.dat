40|$|The cation of methyl green carries two {{positive}} charges, that of {{malachite green}} only one; {{but the two}} dyes behave towards tissue-constituents in {{almost exactly the same}} way. These dyes are not specific for chromatin. They colour certain objects that are devoid of DNA, even when they are used in very dilute solution. The granules of cells called Kornchenzellen in the connective tissue of the <b>common</b> <b>snail,</b> Helix aspersa, are strongly coloured by both dyes from very dilute solutions, and thus provide a striking instance of the unspecificity of these dyes. Malachite green, which is stable and free from contamination by metachromatic impurities, can advantageously replace the methyl green commonly used in mixtures with pyronine. It is suggested that pyronine may have a greater capacity for penetrating into close-textured objects, such as nucleoli and ribosomes, than methyl and malachite greens...|$|E
30|$|Shells of 30 {{species were}} {{occupied}} by hermit crabs at Sepangar shore; however, C. batillariaeformis {{being the most}} <b>common</b> <b>snail</b> comprised the majority (75.6 %) of the occupied shells. The availability of gastropod shells {{is an important factor}} in determining the shell selection pattern of hermit crabs (Bertness [1982]). In a Brazilian inlet, hermit crabs Clibanarius antillensis and Calcinus tibicen were observed to frequently use shells of Tegula viridula which was the most abundant gastropod in the area (Floeter et al [2000]). In this study, the number of shell species occupied by hermit crabs was high, considering the small sampling area covered (about 1  ha in total). In comparison, Nakin and Somers ([2007]) recorded 21 species of gastropod shells used by C. virescens at three separate sites of a South African coast, while Benvenuto and Gherardi ([2001]) recorded 20 species of gastropod shells occupied by C. erythropus in a rocky Mediterranean shore.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In the Msambweni {{area of the}} Kwale District in Kenya, an area endemic for Schistosoma haematobium, {{potential}} intermediate-host snails were systematically {{surveyed in}} water bodies associated with human contact that were previously surveyed in the 1980 s. Bulinus (africanus) nasutus, which accounted for 67 % of the snails collected, was the only snail shedding S. haematobium cercariae. Lanistes purpureus was the second most <b>common</b> <b>snail</b> (25 %); lower numbers of Bulinus forskalii and Melanoides tuberculata were also recovered. Infection with non-S. haematobium trematodes was found among all snail species. Rainfall {{was significantly associated with}} the temporal distribution of all snail species: high numbers of Bulinus nasutus developed after extensive rainfall, followed, in turn, by increased S. haematobium shedding. Spatial distribution of snails was significantly clustered over a range of up to 1 km, with peak clustering observed at a distance of 400 meters. Water lily (Nymphaea spp.) and several aquatic grass species appeared necessary for local colonization by B. nasutus or L. purpureus...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Batillaria zonalis is a <b>common</b> <b>snail</b> on Hong Kong sandy shores, {{occupying the}} low-mid shore. Shells of B. zonalis (basibiont) are often fouled with the rock oyster Saccostrea cucullata and the {{barnacle}} Balanus reticulatus (epibiont). This epibiotic interaction {{has a negative}} impact on the fitness of B. zonalis in terms of impairing fecundity, mobility and metabolism of fouled individuals. During the reproductive season, fouled snails had lower Gonadosomatic Index and fewer egg-bearing individuals than non-fouled snails. Fouled snails crawled in a more tortuous pathway and with lower speed when compared with non-fouled snails. Reduction in oxygen consumption and metabolic rate in fouled snails further suggested the restriction in mobility of B. zonalis by the epibionts. Glycogen content in the foot muscle tissues and hepatopancreas of fouled and non-fouled snails was, however, similar, revealing epibiosis does not influence the energy storage of B. zonalis. Mortality of fouled and non-fouled snails was similar under laboratory conditions, suggesting epibiosis does not influence the survivorship of B. zonalis in Hong Kong. Impairment in the fitness of fouled B. zonalis indicates that epibiosis can influence the population dynamics of B. zonalis in Hong Kong...|$|E
40|$|In „Nachrichtsblatt der Deutschen Malakozool. Gesellsch. 1910, p. 134 ” Mr. V. Franz (Helgoland) gives {{a note on}} the {{occurrence}} of Helix aspersa in Holland at Vlissingen. He suggests that the animals have been transported fortuitously to that locality. Now I will not discuss the possibility this having been the case here, in the neighborhood of the harbour, where the snails can have been brought with ships from England or Belgium. But {{the occurrence}} of Helix aspersa at Vlissingen is not at all curious, as it is considered since many years as belonging to the Dutch fauna. In his list of Dutch molluscs, published in 1858, Mr. Maitland ¹) cites already Helix aspersa, and gives various localities in Holland, including also the isle of Walcheren, where Vlissingen is situated. Herklots ²) calls Helix aspersa a very <b>common</b> <b>snail</b> in Holland. The Leyden Museum possesses specimens from the neighborhood of Leyden and of the Hague, and from Zeist in the province of Utrecht. It needs not wonder this snail, whose moving forward from the North of France to England and Belgium has been observed, having also transgressed our frontier. Certainly a careful looking for this species will supply more localities in our country...|$|E
40|$|Littoraria flava is a <b>common</b> <b>snail</b> on rocky shores {{and stems}} of {{mangrove}} {{trees along the}} southeastern coast of Brazil. However, studies on this species are absent. Our previous observation indicated a distance distribution pattern among shell size classes of this snail, depending on distance from the shore and occurrence in aggregation. We hypothesized that (1) snails with large shells would occur on tree stems far from the shore and (2) snails occurring in aggregation on rocky shores would be smaller than those occurring in isolation. We evaluated the effect of desiccation on the mortality of different size classes of snails experimentally submitted to a temperature of 40 °C. We measured snail shells on 14 tree stems occurring in two mangrove strips (near and far from shore). Snails on tree stems of mangrove strips far from shore presented larger shells than snails near the shore. Snails in aggregations on rocky shores were smaller than isolated ones. The desiccation experiment showed that small snails (1. 55 cm) and the mortality of small snails was above 70 %. The distribution pattern of L. flava is probably related to differential shell size class tolerance to prolonged periods of emersion. Also, aggregation may be a behavioral mechanism to avoid water loss, as small snails are frequently found in aggregation and lose water at a faster rate...|$|E
