2500|$|In 1821, {{soon after}} the Danish {{physicist}} and chemist Hans Christian Ørsted discovered the phenomenon of electromagnetism, Davy and British scientist William Hyde Wollaston tried, but failed, to design an electric motor. Faraday, having discussed {{the problem with the}} two men, went on to build two devices to produce what he called [...] "electromagnetic rotation". One of these, now known as the homopolar motor, caused a continuous circular motion that was engendered by the circular magnetic force around a wire that extended into a pool of mercury wherein was placed a magnet; the wire would then rotate around the magnet if supplied with current from a <b>chemical</b> <b>battery.</b> These experiments and inventions formed the foundation of modern electromagnetic technology. In his excitement, Faraday published results without acknowledging his work with either Wollaston or Davy. The resulting controversy within the Royal Society strained his mentor relationship with Davy and may well have contributed to Faraday's assignment to other activities, which consequently prevented his involvement in electromagnetic research for several years.|$|E

40|$|Abstract–A novel {{high-speed}} flywheel-based DC {{voltage source}} (FDCS) {{has recently been}} developed as a direct and improved energy storage substitute for <b>chemical</b> <b>batteries</b> in uninterruptible power supply (UPS) applications. Like <b>chemical</b> <b>batteries,</b> the FDCS requires only a DC connection to a UPS with no other interconnections; however, the FDCS offers many advantages over <b>chemical</b> <b>batteries,</b> including reduced life cycle costs due to elimination of the periodic replacement of <b>chemical</b> <b>batteries,</b> increased power density, known state of charge, {{and the absence of}} environmentally harmful materials. The FDCS also incorporates a novel soft handover feature which was developed to provide a gradual load transfer from the backup energy source of the UPS to a backup engine-generator set (genset). In the absence of the soft handover feature, the genset fails due to its inability to slew its output power in the time required to continue to supply the critical load. This paper details the performance of the FDCS during operational events and shows the benefits of the soft handover feature for a combined genset-UPS ride-thru application...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Active Magnetic Bearings (AMBs) {{offer an}} {{alternative}} to conventional ball bearings. Their main advantages stem {{from the lack of}} physical contact between the rotor and the stator, and their potential for active disturbance rejection. AMBs are indispensable for high-speed electromechanical flywheel batteries, which have been proposed recently as a replacement of <b>chemical</b> <b>batteries</b> on-board orbiting satellites. In order to be competitive with <b>chemical</b> <b>batteries,</b> these flywheel batteries must operate at very high speeds and have low dissipative losses. Low-losses imply AMB operation in low flux or current bias. In this paper we analyze the disturbance rejection properties of a recently proposed low-bias AMB controller subject to an imbalance force. We use describing functions to analyze and predict the magnitude of position oscillations of the AMB under the imbalance force. I...|$|R

50|$|The {{basic idea}} of {{chemical}} {{generation of electricity}} was old, tracing back to the epic discovery by Italian scientist Alessandro Volta in 1795, who found that when two dissimilar metals are placed in an electrically conductive fluid an electromotive force is set up and electricity generated.

5000|$|The {{principles}} of flight and guidance were interesting. The first oddity was the delay between snapping the trigger and the ignition of the launch motor.

This usually led to the operator tensing up {{in anticipation of the}} sudden explosion from the launcher that he knew was coming. The missile was discharged from the launcher tube by a [...] "launch motor", which was a rocket motor that completely expended itself within the tube so as not to injure the operator with exhaust gas. The missile coasted away from the operator and a burning infrared flare was ignited {{at the rear of the}} missile.|$|E

That film was ejected and recovered over the Pacific Ocean during the descending portion of the 33rd orbit, after which only down-linked data were available.
