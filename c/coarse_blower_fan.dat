40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 113 - 115). This dissertation {{covers the}} commissioning {{and testing of}} an aircraft's constant frequency alternator as the power supply for the Blue Parrot radar. The Blue Parrot is an X-band radar which forms part of the navigation and weapon-aiming system onboard the Buccaneer S- 50 SAAF aircraft. The radar set uses a source of three-phase power at 400 Hz, which the constant frequency alternator can supply {{with the aid of}} certain auxiliary systems. The auxiliary systems include a prime mover, <b>blower</b> <b>fan</b> and a telemetering system. The prime mover has high starting currents which were reduced significantly by the use of a soft-starter. During testing, the constant frequency alternator started overheating and a <b>blower</b> <b>fan</b> was selected based on its thermal requirements. Significant cooling of the constant frequency alternator's case temperature was achieved by the use of a <b>blower</b> <b>fan</b> and shroud. The generator control unit monitors and regulates all parameters on the unit except for case temperature and <b>blower</b> <b>fan</b> pressure. A telemetering system was designed and built to monitor and display these parameters...|$|R

50|$|The Class 25 was {{a complex}} {{locomotive}} which required high maintenance, {{especially on the}} turbine <b>blower</b> <b>fans</b> in the smokebox, of which the blades needed to be replaced frequently due to damage by solid particles in the exhaust.

50|$|An {{air door}} or air curtain is a device {{used to prevent}} air or {{contaminants}} from moving from one open space to another. The most common use is a downward-facing <b>blower</b> <b>fan</b> mounted over an entrance to a building, or an opening between two spaces conditioned at different temperatures.|$|R
2500|$|Depending on what {{is being}} controlled, a forced-air air {{conditioning}} thermostat generally has an external switch for heat/off/cool, and another on/auto to turn the <b>blower</b> <b>fan</b> on constantly or only when heating and cooling are running. [...] Four wires come to the centrally-located thermostat from the main heating/cooling unit (usually located in a closet, basement, or occasionally in the attic): One wire, usually red, supplies 24 volts AC power to the thermostat, while the other three supply control signals from the thermostat, usually white for heat, yellow for cooling, and green {{to turn on the}} <b>blower</b> <b>fan.</b> [...] The power is supplied by a transformer, and when the thermostat makes contact between the 24 volt power and {{one or two of the}} other wires, a relay back at the heating/cooling unit activates the corresponding heat/fan/cool function of the unit(s).|$|R

5000|$|A {{machinery}} compartment {{behind each}} cab housed auxiliary gear such as two motor generator sets, one of [...] {{and the other}} of , each coupled to a <b>blower</b> <b>fan</b> on its shaft for ventilating the main motors. In addition it contained a motor-driven rotary vacuum exhauster, air compressor, air reservoirs for the brakes, low-tension control contactors and resistances for the auxiliaries and battery, together with contactor gear for controlling the field of the larger motor generator.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Enterprise" [...] {{had several}} {{features}} which were innovative by contemporary standards. The engine was suspended on leaf springs {{along with the}} body of the vehicle, and the axle located with swinging arms as is still done today in the Ford Explorer, with power being transmitted to the axle using chain drive. The rear axle was also used to drive a centrifugal <b>blower</b> <b>fan</b> which was used to force air into the firebox.|$|R
50|$|A {{system of}} valves or baffles, or both, is usually {{incorporated}} to simultaneously operate a small radiator inside the vehicle. This small radiator, {{and the associated}} <b>blower</b> <b>fan,</b> is called the heater core, and serves to warm the cabin interior. Like the radiator, the heater core acts by removing heat from the engine. For this reason, automotive technicians often advise operators {{to turn on the}} heater and set it to high if the engine is overheating, to assist the main radiator.|$|R
50|$|Another {{variation}} is the permanent-split capacitor (or PSC) motor. Also {{known as a}} capacitor-run motor, this type of motor uses a non-polarized capacitor with a high voltage rating to generate an electrical phase shift between the run and start windings. PSC motors are the dominant type of split-phase motor in Europe {{and much of the}} world, but in North America, they are most frequently used in variable torque applications (like <b>blowers,</b> <b>fans,</b> and pumps) and other cases where variable speeds are desired.|$|R
50|$|A cheaper {{alternative}} to hot water or steam heat is forced hot air. A furnace burns fuel oil, which heats {{air in a}} heat exchanger, and <b>blower</b> <b>fans</b> circulate the warmed air through a network of ducts to the rooms in the building. This system is cheaper because the air moves {{through a series of}} ducts instead of pipes, and does not require a pipe fitter to install. The space between floor joists can be boxed in and used as some of the ductwork, further lowering costs.|$|R

The tunnel consists of a single bore, 895 meters (2,909 feet) in length, with a six-percent roadway grade outward from the center towards each exit. Forced transverse ventilation is potentially provided by three automatic high-speed Westinghouse Sturtevant <b>blower</b> <b>fans</b> located in a tower at the north entrance. These fans are designed to keep the air free from high-levels of carbon monoxide.|$|R
50|$|The Multimonica II {{featured}} no microphone input, {{and only}} one loudspeaker, but provided more types of harmonics filtering, and the electromechanic vibrato was changed to a tube based and more sophisticated design. The front panel controls of the Multimonica II {{from left to right}} are: power switch and overall volume knob; six selector switches for different preset sounds of the synthesizer; tuning knob; two selector switches for different harmonics filtering; three switches for the vibrato speed and amplitude; power switch for the <b>blower</b> <b>fan.</b>|$|R
50|$|A valve {{arrangement}} {{within the}} water chiller opens a direct path between the condenser and the evaporator. The relatively warm fluid in the chiller loop vaporizes the refrigerant, {{and the energy}} is carried directly to the condenser, where it is cooled and condensed by {{the water from the}} cooling tower. This method is driven by the idea that the refrigerant tends to move towards the coldest point in a refrigeration circuit. The cost savings associated with this method are due to the compressorâ€™s inactivity, since the <b>blower,</b> <b>fans</b> and pumps are all operational.|$|R

50|$|Because {{the heater}} core cools the heated coolant {{from the engine}} by {{transfering}} its heat to the cabin air, it can also act as an auxiliary radiator for the engine. If the radiator is working improperly, the operator may turn the heat on (together with the cabin <b>blower</b> <b>fan</b> placed on full speed, and with the windows opened) in the passenger cabin, resulting in a certain cooling effect on the overheated engine coolant. This idea only works to a certain degree, as the heater core is not large enough nor does it have enough cold air going though it to cool large amounts of coolant significantly.|$|R

A column of HEPA filtered, sterile air is also blown downward, over products and processes to prevent contamination. Air is also exhausted through a HEPA filter, and depending on the Type of Class II BSC, the air is either recirculated back into the laboratory or pulled by an exhaust fan, through ductwork where it is expelled from the building.|$|R
50|$|The Class 25 was {{a complex}} {{locomotive}} which required high maintenance, {{especially on the}} turbine <b>blower</b> <b>fans</b> in the smokebox whose blades needed to be replaced frequently due to damage by solid particles in the exhaust.

Between 1973 and 1980, after serving for twenty years and partially accelerated {{by the introduction of}} electric and diesel-electric traction over routes which were previously served exclusively by the Class 25, all but three of the condensing locomotives, numbers 3451, 3511 and 3540, were converted to free exhausting and non-condensing locomotives as they went through the workshops for major overhauls. The converted locomotives were reclassified to Class 25NC.|$|R
50|$|The {{body of the}} {{locomotive}} was divided into a high tension chamber and a low tension auxiliary machine and equipment compartment with a side corridor along {{the right side of}} {{the locomotive}} when looking towards Cab 1. In the high tension chamber, 43 contactors were arranged along one side with the motor-generator set in the middle of the chamber. The motor-generator was a four-machine unit comprising a high tension motor, two DC exciters, one for each motor, and the 110 V generator for the auxiliary equipment. The machines were flexibly coupled with a <b>blower</b> <b>fan</b> directly coupled at each end of the four-unit set, each fan supplying air to two of the main motors.|$|R

[...] The simplest and lowest cost open-cycle cooling systems, known as swamp coolers in the south-west United States, do not even need power for a compressor, merely a <b>blower</b> <b>fan,</b> so humidified cooled air is simply vented into the living space.

50|$|The <b>blower</b> door <b>fan</b> {{is used to}} blow {{air into}} {{or out of the}} building, {{creating}} either a positive or negative pressure differential between inside and outside. This pressure difference forces air through all holes and penetrations in the building enclosure. The tighter the building (e.g. fewer holes), the less air is needed from the <b>blower</b> door <b>fan</b> to create a change in building pressure. Typically, only depressurization testing is performed, but both depressurization and pressurization are preferable. Different values for blower door metrics are to be expected for pressurizing and depressurizing, due to the building envelope's response to directional airflow. The smallest fan ring that allows the fan to reach the maximum target indoor/outdoor pressure differential should be used. A multi-point test can be performed either manually or using data acquisition and fan control software products. The manual test consists of adjusting the fan to maintain a series of indoor/outdoor pressure differentials and recording the resulting average fan and indoor/outdoor pressures. Alternatively, a single-point test can be performed, where the <b>blower</b> door <b>fan</b> is ramped up to a reference indoor/outdoor pressure differential and the fan pressure is recorded. Often the blower door hardware converts fan pressure measurements directly to fan airflow values.|$|R

In the process their condensing tenders were also rebuilt to ordinary coal-and-water tenders by removing the condensing radiators and roof fans {{and replacing it with}} a massive round-topped water tank. Since the tenders were built on single cast-steel main frames, it was impractical to attempt to shorten them.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [80]- 82) Acoustic noise problems {{become more}} and more evident as increased numbers of large industrial equipment such as engines, <b>blowers,</b> <b>fans,</b> transformers, and compressors are being employed. Active noise control (ANC), in which additional secondary sources are used to cancel noise from the original primary source, has drawn considerable attention and shown significant promise. However, the performance of narrowband ANC systems is limited by out-of-band overshoot (one kind of the passband disturbance), which was first addressed in a 1991 study by Dennis Morgan. Although several methods for alleviating the out-of-band overshoot were presented in his study, practical limitations still remain. In this thesis, the out-of-band overshoot problem in narrowband ANC is comprehensively studied. One characteristic of the out-of-band overshoot, asymmetry, is analyzed from both mathematics and zero-pole placement theory points of view. An effective technique to eliminate the out-of-band overshoot, phase compensation, is presented. Computer simulations for verifying the theoretical results are also provided. M. S.

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. January 2014. Major: Mechanical Engineering. Advisors: Terrence W. Simon, Tianhong Cui. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xiii, 161 pages. With continuously {{increasing number of}} chips and smaller and smaller CPU sizes, heat fluxes {{that need to be}} dissipated from computers are on a rapid increase. CPU cooling being critical to the performance of electronic devices, this field demands considerable research focus. Researchers have been pushing existing computer cooling technologies to their limits and also developing new cooling techniques. Forced convection, spray jet cooling, boiling heat transfer are a few to name. Different technologies have their respective merits and limits in terms of their cooling capability, reliability, ease of manufacturing and durability. Forced convection using air has always been preferred due to its cost effectiveness and reliability. The traditional way of employing this technique has been by using a <b>blower</b> <b>fan</b> that cools the heat sink that dissipates heat from the chips. However, the current heat removal demands better performance than that can be provided by a <b>blower</b> <b>fan</b> alone. Agitation is a strong mixing mechanism that can disturb the near-wall flow, thin the thermal boundary layer and enhance the convective heat transfer. This thesis study carries a detailed study of agitation alone through a Large Scale Mock Up (LSMU) unit which is dynamically similar to a single channel of a heat sink. The LSMU has a translationally oscillating plate (agitator) inside the channel cavity. Time averaged heat transfer coefficients and time resolved velocity measurements have been made along different regions of the channel to characterize the convective cooling performance of the agitator. The ensemble-averaged mean velocity variations show periods of acceleration, deceleration and flow reversal during a cycle as a result of agitator movement. Turbulence is found to increase {{toward the end of the}} acceleration phase and persist through the deceleration phase. A parametric study has been done to explore the effects of agitator frequency (f), amplitude (A) and agitation velocity (2 &# 960;Af) on heat transfer and flow mechanism. The heat transfer coefficient increases with the increase in frequency and amplitude. At a fixed agitation velocity, heat transfer coefficient is mainly governed by the agitation velocity irrespective of the value of amplitude or frequency...|$|R
