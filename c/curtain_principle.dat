50|$|<b>Curtain</b> <b>principle</b> - {{one does}} not need to go behind the Certificate of Title as it {{contains}} all the information about the title. This means that ownership need not be proved by long complicated documents that are kept by the owner, as in the Private Conveyancing system. All of the necessary information regarding ownership is on the Certificate of Title.|$|E
40|$|This thesis explores {{whether the}} {{doctrine}} of indefeasibility of title and its three associated principles – the mirror principle, the <b>curtain</b> <b>principle,</b> and the insurance principle – are mythical constructs, and not legal facts as they are portrayed in the dominant legal discourse and in traditional legal research sources. It is commonly understood that indefeasibility of title {{is the hallmark of}} land titles systems of registration, especially those based on the Torrens model, and Saskatchewan is a jurisdiction which operates such a system. When one examines the genesis of land titles systems and indefeasibility of title, Saskatchewan’s land titles statutes and recent court decisions, one discovers that there is a dichotomy between indefeasibility of title in practice and how it is portrayed in theory. Given that land titles systems of registration are statutory creations, it is more appropriate to utilize the language in the legislation and therefore to avoid reliance upon these constructs...|$|E
5000|$|The {{most popular}} {{explanation}} {{given for the}} shower-curtain effect is Bernoulli's principle. [...] Bernoulli's principle states that an increase in velocity results in a decrease in pressure. This theory presumes that the water flowing out of a shower head causes the air through which the water moves to start flowing {{in the same direction}} as the water. This movement would be parallel to the plane of the shower curtain. If air is moving across the inside surface of the shower <b>curtain,</b> Bernoulli's <b>principle</b> says the air pressure there will drop. This would result in a pressure differential between the inside and outside, causing the curtain to move inward. It would be strongest when the gap between the bather and the curtain is smallest - resulting in the curtain attaching to the bather.|$|R
