40|$|Even {{though most}} archaeologists {{are aware of}} the <b>crop</b> <b>mark</b> {{phenomenon}} and its possible archaeological nature, the information on its occurrence and specific character is, in most cases, obtained by imaging in the visible spectrum. After the Second World War, the occasional use of near-infrared (NIR) sensitive emulsions attributed this kind of invisible imaging with a great potential. However, archaeological NIR imaging always remained restricted due to several reasons not, at least, its complicated workflow and uncertain results. This article wants to delve deeper into the subject, looking at the conventional film-based approach of NIR aerial reconnaissance and its historical use in archaeological <b>crop</b> <b>mark</b> research, after which a current straightforward digital approach will be outlined. By explaining the spectral properties of plants and using examples of recently acquired NIR imagery in comparison with visible frames, it should become clear why the detection and interpretation of crop marks can benefit from low-cost digital NIR imaging in certain situations...|$|E
40|$|A small hilltop {{enclosure}} at Carrog, Llanbadrig, Anglesey, {{that had}} been identified from a <b>crop</b> <b>mark</b> on an aerial photograph was investigated by geophysical survey and subsequently evaluated by excavation. The enclosure was interpreted on typological grounds as a possible Late Bronze Age or Early Iron Age defended site. The enclosure ditch was substantial, {{but there was no}} trace remaining of any accompanying bank. Within the enclosure were numerous post-holes and pits. Some of the latter proved to be hearths of Early Neolithic date and these have produced radiocarbon dates in the fourth millennium cal BC. The post-holes appeared to belong to structures from occupation of the enclosure, and dates from these and from the ditch showed that it was probably constructed about 800 cal BC and occupied until about 400 cal BC confirming the original interpretation. Late in its existence the ditch had been partially backfilled and a small building constructed within it, radiocarbon-dated to the eighth–ninth century cal AD...|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of Anglian and Anglo-Scandinavian settlements at Cottam, East Yorkshire, was first indicated in 1987 by numerous finds of copper alloy coins, dress pins and strap ends by metal detector users. This report {{presents the results}} of fieldwork carried out on behalf of the Department of Archaeology, University of York, between 1993 - 5, including field walking, geophysical survey, and excavation. This revealed an enclosure of the eighth-ninth centuries, containing traces of a small number of post-built halls. In the late ninth century this settlement was then abandoned, a process which led to the incorporation of a human female skull in a domestic rubbish pit. A new enclosed settlement was laid out nearby, which was occupied briefly in the early tenth century. It is argued that the Anglian settlement may have been part of a royal multiple estate but {{that as a result of}} estate reorganisation after the Scandinavian settlement it developed into an independent manor. Cottam is the first so-called "productive site" in the environs of York to be the subject of archaeological investigations. The results suggest that it was a prosperous but not exceptional site, and that the primary activity was farming, with limited evidence for trade or manufacture. This work also prompts a reassessment of the typology of <b>crop</b> <b>mark</b> enclosures and the re-examination of the large number of undated enclosures in the area...|$|E

40|$|Satellite {{images have}} been {{systematically}} explored by archaeologists to detect crop marks, which are {{considered as a}} proxy for the identification of buried archaeological remains. Even though several existing algorithms are frequently applied, such as histogram enhancements and vegetation indices, the detection of crop marks still remains a difficult task, while the final interpretation results can be very poor. This paper aims to present some of the current difficulties of “remote sensing archaeology” in terms of detection and interpretation of crop marks due to the crops’ phenological variations. At the same time, the presented work seeks to evaluate the recently proposed linear equations for the enhancement of crop marks, initially developed for the eastern Mediterranean region. These linear equations re-project the initial n-space spectral into a new 3 D orthogonal space determined by three components: a <b>crop</b> <b>mark</b> component, a vegetation component, and a soil component. For the aims of this study, the Lucera archaeological site (southern Italy), where several Neolithic trenches have been identified, was selected. QuickBird and GeoEye high-resolution satellite images were analysed, indicating that vegetation indices may mismatch some crop marks depending on the phenological stage of the vegetation cultivated {{in the area of the}} archaeological site. On the contrary, ratios from linear equations were able to spot these crop marks even in shadow areas, indicating that improvements and developments of novel methodologies and equations based on remote sensing datasets can further assist archaeological research...|$|E
40|$|An archaeological {{evaluation}} {{was undertaken}} by Cotswold Archaeology in January 2015 for CgMs Consulting Limited {{on behalf of}} Eagle One Limited at the 45. 12 hectare site of Mosshayne Farm, Tithebarn Lane, Pinhoe, Devon. A total of 12 trial trenches were excavated on the location of known geophysical anomalies and aerial photographic evidence as a first phase of archaeological evaluation of the site. The evaluation has established {{that there is a}} generally good correlation between recorded archaeological features and both geophysical anomalies and aerial photographic evidence from earlier investigations of the site. Two curvilinear features, one located in Trench 5 and the other in Trench 6 are, based on their morphology, of possible Neolithic/Bronze Age date. That recorded in Trench 6 is quite possibly the remains of a barrow ditch. were recorded, one of which did not correlate with a very distinctive <b>crop</b> <b>mark</b> from aerial photographs (Trench 5). A substantially ditched, sub-square Roman farmstead/enclosure or settlement was recorded in the northwest of the site (Trenches 1 and 3), within the limits of which, at least one roundhouse structure (Trench 2), as illustrated by curvilinear gullies was recorded. A field system of regular, small bounded fields was recorded in the west of the site (Trenches 7, 9, 10, 11). Though undated, the morphology and orientation of the system might suggest a later prehistoric or Roman date. This more regularised exploitation of the land would also fit with wider patterns of evidence of the Iron Age and Roman periods recorded in a number of archaeological investigations in the area in the recent past. Investigations of field boundary ditches noted on earlier mapping and in the geophysical survey were proven during the evaluation and dated to the 16 th - 18 th centuries, though some may be medieval in origin...|$|E
