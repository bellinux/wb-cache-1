25|$|The {{main study}} volume unit is study subject (or module), which {{includes}} {{various forms of}} studies: lectures, laboratory work, training, seminars, student’s individual work, projects etc. The unit of subject volume is credit. The duration and extent of studies are expressed in ECTS <b>credit</b> <b>points.</b> One credit point refers to 26,7 hours. A student admitted on to a degree programme is eligible to receive the Diploma upon successful completion of corresponding number of credits and after successful defence of final degree work. Compulsory parts of doctoral studies are studies, research and dissertation.|$|E
25|$|All the IITs {{follow the}} credits system of {{performance}} evaluation, with proportional weighting of courses {{based on their}} importance. The total marks (usually out of 100) {{form the basis of}} grades, with a grade value (out of 10) assigned to a range of marks. Sometimes, relative grading is done considering the overall performance of the whole class. For each semester, the students are graded on a scale of 0 to 10 based on their performance, by taking a weighted average of the grade points from all the courses, with their respective <b>credit</b> <b>points.</b> Each semester evaluation is done independently and then the weighted average over all semesters is used to calculate the cumulative grade point average (known as CGPA or CPI—Cumulative Performance Index).|$|E
500|$|A {{work unit}} is the protein data {{that the client}} is asked to process. Work units are a {{fraction}} of the simulation between the states in a Markov state model. After the work unit has been downloaded and completely processed by a volunteer's computer, it is returned to Folding@home servers, which then award the volunteer the <b>credit</b> <b>points.</b> [...] This cycle repeats automatically. All work units have associated deadlines, and if this deadline is exceeded, the user may not get credit and the unit will be automatically reissued to another participant. As protein folding occurs serially, and many work units are generated from their predecessors, this allows the overall simulation process to proceed normally if a work unit is not returned after a reasonable period of time. Due to these deadlines, the minimum system requirement for Folding@home is a Pentium3 450MHz CPU with Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE). However, work units for high-performance clients have a much shorter deadline than those for the uniprocessor client, as {{a major part of the}} scientific benefit is dependent on rapidly completing simulations.|$|E

2500|$|The CMP has a {{point system}} that {{competitors}} use {{to work their way}} towards [...] "distinguished status." [...] Starting in 2015, the CMP began awarding achievement pins based on the score one earns at a given match. [...] For example, to earn a bronze, silver, or gold CMP [...]22 Rimfire Pistol Achievement Pin, one must achieve a score of 235-249, 250-264, or 265+ respectively in the authorized excellence category of competition. [...] Also in 2015, the CMP established minimum cut scores that must be achieved for a given weapon in the authorized excellence category of competition before one can earn <b>credit</b> <b>points</b> (also referred to as [...] "leg points") towards a distinguished marksmanship badge. [...] Once the minimum cut score has been achieved or exceeded (260-300 for [...]22 rimfire pistol, 250-300 for service pistol, and 455-500 for service rifle), the shooter becomes eligible to earn leg points. [...] The number of leg points that can be earned are {{based on the number of}} competitors, one's score, one's ranking, and you must fall within the top 10% of all match shooters regardless of your minimum cut score. [...] Typically, the highest one-sixth of the top 10% earn ten leg points, the next highest two-sixths earn eight, and the remaining three-sixths earn six. [...] Depending on the awarding organization, competitors must earn between one and six leg points to be awarded their first excellence-in-competition badge. [...] Everyone must earn at least 30 leg points to reach [...] "distinguished status" [...] and be awarded one of the distinguished marksmanship badges. [...] Leg points accumulate throughout a competitor's lifetime until [...] "distinguished status" [...] is attained. [...] Thus, leg points earned as a member of the U.S. armed forces will transfer toward [...] "distinguished status" [...] as a civilian, and vice versa.|$|E

40|$|We {{developed}} a <b>credit</b> <b>point</b> system to assess “wildlife-friendliness” {{at the farm}} scale. Farmers can choose and gain points from 32 habitat management options, most of which account for quantity, quality and spatial distribution of ecological compensation areas (options of the Swiss agri-environment scheme). Additionally, points can be scored by specific arable and grassland measures. Farmers are free to decide which measures to implement. We evaluated the <b>credit</b> <b>point</b> system on 133 farms (2009 – 2011) in the Swiss Lowland Plateau. Occurrence and density of plants, grasshoppers, butterflies and farmland birds were recorded on these farms as biodiversity indicators. The scored points were positively correlated {{with the majority of}} biodiversity indicators. IP-Suisse, the Swiss organisation of integrated agricultural production, incorporated the <b>credit</b> <b>point</b> system into their production guidelines in 2009. All its producers have to reach a defined point score until 2013. As a consequence, two thirds of the involved farmers had to increase their ecological performance. This initiative also put pressure on their organic farming colleagues to reform their guidelines in order to fully exploit their high potential of biodiversity. The products from the farms are labelled by a major retailer as wildlife-friendly and are well-received by consumers. Farmers benefit from bonus payments from the retailer and an enhanced public image. Therefore, the <b>credit</b> <b>point</b> system helps to substantially improve farmland biodiversity. Our results provide evidence that wildlife-friendly farming can create a “win/win situation” for farmers and nature, even in intensively managed regions in the Swiss Lowland Plateau...|$|R

40|$|In 2002 the Faculty of Information Communication Technologies (FICT) at Swinburne University of Technology made a {{commitment}} to student transition to higher education by mandating that incoming undergraduates complete a transition subject (HIT 0103 IT Transition) as part of their degree. This paper describes how this zero <b>credit</b> <b>point</b> transition subject has evolved over four years.

As a result of systematic evaluations, and the burden to the faculty of self-funding, a one-week intensive program will replace HIT 0103 in 2006. Some of the main curriculum components from HIT 0103 will be embedded in core subjects, in particular a continuing focus on the group work process, presentation skills and reflective writing. The authors discuss HIT 0103 ’s implementation through the design, development, review and evaluation phases drawing on the reactions of students to this compulsory pass requirement of a zero <b>credit</b> <b>point</b> subject in their undergraduate degree course...|$|R
