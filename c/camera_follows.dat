5|$|Persona 2: Eternal Punishment is a {{role-playing}} {{game where}} the player takes {{control of a}} group of characters exploring the fictional city of Sumaru. The <b>camera</b> <b>follows</b> the party from an adjustable angled overhead perspective. The city in general is navigated using an overworld map. A key element to the story and gameplay is the Rumor system: after the characters hear a rumor, they can spread that rumor around the city using certain characters, and those rumors can grant the characters special items or other positive or negative effects.|$|E
5|$|In New York City, a {{man with}} a <b>camera</b> <b>follows</b> a woman from an {{elevator}} through a corridor to another elevator, where all the people appear to be gray. He gets off on a floor before the woman and runs down the stairs. Lights flicker and the elevator cable snaps. As the man reaches the basement, the cab crashes and its door spills open to reveal the woman's wrist, covered with blood. The man begins to snap photos. Later, in Washington, D.C., FBI Assistant Director Alvin Kersh (James Pickens, Jr.) assigns Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), along with Agent Peyton Ritter from New York, to the case. Scully's partner Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) looks at the material on Scully's desk and points out that the case looks like an X-file—and that Kersh is obviously splitting them up.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Andy {{shows up}} at Ann's house wearing a fancy suit. He tells her he has matured, gotten an office job {{and would like to}} get back together, but Ann declines. The <b>camera</b> <b>follows</b> Andy as he leaves, {{revealing}} he is actually living in a tent inside the pit. During the Pawnee Today show, Leslie and Marcia argue fiercely. Leslie insists she has not taken a political position, even after Marcia brings up the recent party at the Bulge. They take several callers, all of whom agree that Leslie should resign. Fed up, Leslie adamantly insists she will not resign, nor will she annul the penguin wedding. Later, she visits Ann and insists that Ann go on a date with Mark. The episode ends with Leslie driving the penguins from the Pawnee Zoo to a zoo in Iowa, where same-sex marriage is legal.|$|E
25|$|In a 1999 {{episode of}} The Tom Green Show, Glenn Humplik, Green's co-host, {{is unable to}} urinate because Green insists on filming him while he does so.

25|$|Graphic {{adventure}}s are adventure {{games that}} use graphics {{to convey the}} environment to the player. Games under the graphic adventure banner may {{have a variety of}} input types, from text parsers to touch screen interfaces. Graphic adventure games will vary in how they present the avatar. Some games will utilize a first-person or third-person perspective where the <b>camera</b> <b>follows</b> the player's movements, whereas many adventure games use drawn or pre-rendered backgrounds, or a context-sensitive camera that is positioned to show off each location to the best effect.|$|E

25|$|The {{next morning}} during roll call, Miklós finds Saul {{and tells him}} that he needs a {{replacement}} body, {{similar to the one}} Saul has taken. The prisoners are then summoned into the crematorium to get back to work, where they discover that Biedermann and his unit have been gassed by the SS. Abraham starts a riot with the other prisoners and they attack the SS guards, starting the rebellion. After managing to escape from the crematorium, Saul retrieves the boy's body and escapes to the woods with Braun and few other prisoners. When they reach a river, Saul finds a chance to bury the body, only to discover that Braun is a fraud when he can't recite the Kaddish. When he hears the guards approaching, Saul tries to carry the body across the river. Unable to manage the current with the added weight, he loses his grasp on the sack and is pulled out of the river by Rabbi Frankel as the body floats away. When the prisoners arrive at a shed in the forest, they start to discuss a plan to join the Polish resistance. Saul notices a young peasant boy peeking into the shed and smiles at him, the only time he is shown with a smile. As the boy runs away, guards run past {{in the direction of the}} shed. Gunfire echoes as the <b>camera</b> <b>follows</b> the boy into the woods.|$|E
500|$|Disney's Hollywood Studios (then [...] "Disney-MGM Studios"), part of Walt Disney World Resort in Florida, debuted a 12-minute {{attraction}} in 1999 titled Sounds Dangerous!. In the show, a <b>camera</b> <b>follows</b> Carey through {{a day as}} an undercover detective. When his video camera fails, the audience is left in complete darkness, wearing earphones, following his adventure through sound cues. The attraction is now closed.|$|E
500|$|Tales of Rebirth is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} game with player characters rendered as two-dimensional sprites on three-dimensional backgrounds. Unlike previous Tales games, the <b>camera</b> <b>follows</b> the characters from a side-long view, zooming {{in or out}} depending on their relative position, and instead of a navigable overworld, players fast-travel to different locations using a standard map of the game world. Side conversations between characters called Skits (called [...] in Japanese) feature both story-relevant information and added details not essential to the story.|$|E

500|$|The video {{begins with}} a journey through a dark {{environment}} wrought with cables and a faint pulsating light. The sequence {{has been described as}} [...] "womb-like, voyeuristic, as if the black box of technology is about to open up". The <b>camera</b> <b>follows</b> these cables to an ethereal, white room where a robot with Björk's features lies in a fetal position. As the room lightens up, two mechanical arms begin to assemble the robot, which opens its eyes and begins to sing the song. Pistons pumping white fluids, as well as drilling and penetrative motions are seen, featuring a [...] "clear" [...] sexual subtext.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to Ligeti, Kubrick also enjoyed a collaboration with composer Wendy Carlos, whose 1968 album Switched-On Bach—which re-interpreted baroque music {{through the use}} of a Moog synthesizer—caught the filmmaker's attention. In 1971, Carlos composed and recorded music for the soundtrack of A Clockwork Orange. Additional music not used in the film was released in 1972 as Wendy Carlos's Clockwork Orange. Kubrick later collaborated with Carlos on The Shining (1980). The opening of the film—in which the <b>camera</b> <b>follows</b> Jack Torrance's yellow VW beetle through the mountains to the Overlook Hotel—employs Carlos' eerie rendering of [...] "Dies Irae" [...] (Day of Wrath) from Hector Berlioz's Symphonie Fantastique.|$|E
500|$|... {{continually}} draw {{our attention}} to the key props of the gun and the teacups. The <b>camera</b> <b>follows</b> Squires' gun to his desk drawer and we're kept aware of its presence thanks to Nina and Squires' [...] "If I’d shot you, here in the dark/With an empty gun? Good luck" [...] exchange. Nina is shown drinking from the poisoned cup one of two times she admiringly calls Squires [...] "devious" [...] (a hint at her true feelings about him) and once again when she emphasises the word [...] "plan". While Squires is telling the story of the Sphinx and she seems to be gazing at the statue of it, she's actually looking at the photograph of her brother on display directly below.|$|E

50|$|Humberside Police {{recently}} {{participated in}} a documentary serious named The Lock Up, where <b>cameras</b> <b>followed</b> Police and Custody officers in their work at the Custody Suite at Humberside Police Headquarters on Priory Road, Cottingham, East Riding of Yorkshire.|$|R
500|$|Film critic Glenn Kenny {{has said}} that the [...] "calm precision" [...] of the mise en scène in the opening dream {{sequence}} [...] "put [...] under such a powerful spell" [...] that [...] "it reconfirmed ... Rivette's standing as an ultimately unquantifiable master". Throughout the film, everyday sounds are amplified by a lack of music, and the film uses sweeping long shots, and several incidental scenes of Julien working, talking with his cat, and of the characters sleeping. Slant Magazine commented that the cat is the film's most interesting character, and Philippa Hawker of The Age notes that the film [...] "has one of the best sequences involving a cat on film." [...] The <b>camera</b> <b>follows</b> the cat and films it looking directly at the camera, giving a sense of artistic freedom and spontaneity.|$|E
500|$|As {{the name}} says, a {{tracking}} <b>camera</b> <b>follows</b> the characters from behind. The player does {{not control the}} camera in any way - he/she cannot for example rotate it or move it to a different position. This type of camera system was very common in early 3D games such as Crash Bandicoot or Tomb Raider since it is very simple to implement. However, {{there are a number}} of issues with it. In particular, if the current view is not suitable (either because it is occluded by an object, or because it is not showing what the player is interested in), it cannot be changed since the player does not control the camera. Sometimes this viewpoint causes [...] difficulty when a character turns or stands face out against a wall. The camera may jerk or end up in awkward positions.|$|E
500|$|... "Coming Home" [...] {{starts with}} scenes {{of a black}} {{helicopter}} flying over the desert. In some of the shots, Diddy can be seen looking out on to the horizon. As the song progresses into its main verses, the <b>camera</b> <b>follows</b> Diddy walking through the desert. In the background and foreground, the fire-damaged remnants of a home such as a TV set, fur coats and a stereo system are scattered across the landscape. During the chorus Dawn Richard and Kalenna Harper take place {{in front of the}} camera, walking behind Diddy miming Grey's words. Later in the clip, during the second verse, Diddy sits in a burned out building singing to himself. Outside, a burned out vehicle is parked. Then during the song's bridge, red smoke surrounds Diddy as the helicopter, from the opening scene, comes to land. However, this time Richard and Harper are seated inside waiting for Diddy. As the song fades, the helicopter flies over the desert toward the horizon.|$|E
50|$|In 2007 Humberside Fire and Rescue Service {{featured}} on a BBC One show entitled Women on Fire. <b>Cameras</b> <b>followed</b> two female firefighters during a 16-day intensive training course {{to allow them}} to become retained firefighters for Humberside Fire and Rescue Service.|$|R

5000|$|Rey {{incorporated}} such {{aspects of}} Russian Expressionism into his film as attention to shadow, camera [...] "walk-throughs" [...] (actors walk towards a <b>camera</b> <b>followed</b> by {{a shot of}} them moving away, as if they moved through it), and closeups on peasant faces.|$|R
500|$|Mizoguchi {{told his}} cinematographer Kazuo Miyagawa {{that he wanted}} the film [...] "to unroll {{seamlessly}} like a scroll-painting". The Southern School of Chinese painting was particularly an inspiration the filmmakers aspired to. The film has been praised for its cinematography, such as the opening shot and the scene where Genjurō and Lady Wakasa have sex by a stream and the <b>camera</b> <b>follows</b> {{the flow of the}} water instead of lingering on the two lovers. Mizoguchi never personally handled the camera and did not participate in planning the lighting of his film. To achieve the appearance the filmmakers wanted, Miyagawa kept lighting low and filmed as near to sunset as circumstances would allow. Many of the shots were taken from cranes, with Miyagawa claiming in 1992 that these shots made up 70% of the film. Miyagawa also stated that this film was the only occasion in which Mizoguchi complimented him for his camera work.|$|E
500|$|In Major League Baseball, {{the pitcher}} {{is unable to}} move around the pitcher's mound and many are also able to perform the feat of [...] pitches. The ball's physics have been called into question, with the ball {{stopping}} on a dime after three or less bounces. The game's camera system does not function properly and, when a ball is hit, the outfield <b>camera</b> <b>follows</b> the ball looking upwards, {{making it impossible for}} the game player to see where their fielders are. The ball can also be thrown and get stuck in the well between the stands and the field on an overthrow of a baseman and cause inside the park home runs, which would not happen within a real game (in that case a ground rule double and/or error would be scored instead). Another bug allows players to go into the stands past the wall with the ball if they enter at certain points in foul territory. Each baseman is also controlled individually, allowing for user error in certain situations where a running baseman will be called out if the baseman ahead of them remains at their last base if the player fails to advance them.|$|E
500|$|The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is {{a fantasy}} action-adventure game with {{role-playing}} and puzzle elements {{set in a}} large open-world environment. The player controls series protagonist Link from a third-person perspective, in a three-dimensional world. Link primarily fights with a sword and shield, but he can also use other weapons such as projectiles, bombs, and magic spells. The control scheme introduced techniques such as context-sensitive actions and a targeting system called [...] "Z-targeting". In combat, Z-targeting allows the player to have Link focus and latch onto an enemy or other objects. When using this technique, the <b>camera</b> <b>follows</b> the target and Link constantly faces it. Projectile attacks are automatically directed at the target and do not require manual aiming. Context-sensitive actions allow multiple tasks to be assigned to one button, simplifying the control scheme. The on-screen display shows {{what will happen when}} the button is pushed and changes depending on what the character is doing. For example, the same button that causes Link to push a box if he is standing next to it will have him climb on the box if the analog stick is pushed toward it.|$|E
50|$|In 2015, Red {{announced}} a new camera body called DSMC2. The Weapon 8K VV and Weapon 6K were the first two cameras announced within this line of <b>cameras</b> <b>followed</b> by Red Raven 4.5K and Scarlet-W 5K. All of these cameras leveraged Red Dragon sensor technology.|$|R

Slim Whittle {{from the}} Whittle Family [...] ) as a Senate candidate in Western Australia. Mitchell used the show to make policy speeches and a <b>camera</b> <b>followed</b> him on the hustings.|$|R
5000|$|Harris was {{credited}} as {{the inspiration for}} The Fast Show character, Louis Balfour, whose catchphrase [...] "nice!"
