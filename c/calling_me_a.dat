25|$|The {{statement}} “I’m {{a believer}} in social Darwinism,” {{did not come from}} me. In fact, I had to look up the expression to learn what was being referred to. This attack appears to be <b>calling</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> Nazi, nothing less. I demand that Mr. Storr refer me to the original sources to which we assume he has referred. Until then, I’ll only say that he has carefully selected phrases and statements out of context, not the sort of referencing that I would have expected from him.|$|E
500|$|Agnew was {{involved}} in a minor controversy regarding an appearance by Lily Allen on Test Match Special in 2009. The Daily Telegraph reported that [...] "the cricket-loving Allen struck up an instant rapport with Agnew, and the BBC received largely positive feedback for the 30-minute interview", but Will Buckley, writing for The Observer, described Agnew's [...] "amorous ambitions" [...] as [...] "positioned... firmly on the pervy side of things". Agnew was furious, noting he [...] "gave... Will Buckley 24hrs to apologise for <b>calling</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> pervert, and he has declined... As you can imagine, I have taken being called a pervert quite badly." [...] Allen herself supported Agnew: [...] " [...] really think this Will Buckley guy should apologise to... he was nothing but kind and gentlemanly to me during our interview. I don't know 1 person that agrees with The Observer on this one." [...] Buckley eventually apologised.|$|E
2500|$|Meili {{took the}} stand during the trial and said afterwards: [...] "I'll tell you what—I didn't feel {{wonderful}} about the boys' defense attorneys, especially the one who cross-examined me. He was {{right in front of}} my face and, in essence, <b>calling</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> slut by asking questions like 'When's the last time you had sex with your boyfriend?'" [...] Wise's lawyer had also asked her whether she had been assaulted by men in her life, suggested that a man she knew may have attacked her, and implied her injuries were not as severe as they had been made out to be.|$|E

2500|$|In 2005, Freeman {{criticized the}} celebration of Black History Month , saying, [...] "I don't want a black history month. Black history is American history." [...] He says {{the only way to}} end racism is to stop talking about it, and he notes that there is no [...] "white history month." [...] Freeman once said in an {{interview}} with 60 Minutess Mike Wallace, [...] "I am going to stop calling you a white man and I'm going to ask you to stop <b>calling</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> black man." [...] Freeman supported the defeated proposal to change the Mississippi state flag, which contains the Confederate battle flag. Freeman sparked controversy in 2011 when, on CNN's Piers Morgan Tonight, he accused the Tea Party movement of racism.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2005, Tate {{appeared}} as Lauren {{in a special}} sketch for the BBC's annual Children in Need telethon. The segment is posed as a crossover with EastEnders, featuring Barbara Windsor as Peggy Mitchell, Kacey Ainsworth as Little Mo and Lacey Turner as Stacey Slater. The sketch sees Lauren arrive in Walford in search of revenge on Stacey, who has apparently stolen her boyfriend. When she makes an appearance in the Queen Vic, Peggy finds herself getting increasingly frustrated with Lauren, who asks, [...] "Are you a Cockney? Are you a Cockney sparrow?" [...] (pronounced 'Cock-er-ney') and [...] "Do you know Chas & Dave? Are you their mum?" [...] repeatedly. Peggy also unintentionally uses some of Lauren's catchphrases, such as [...] "Are you disrespecting my family?" [...] and [...] "Are you <b>calling</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> ?" [...] Lauren eventually leaves the pub after mixing some famous lines from the soap, including [...] "Hello princess" [...] and [...] "Rickaay!" [...] with her usual catchphrase, [...] "Bovvered?".|$|E
2500|$|In their {{penultimate}} {{debate on}} August 28 of that year, the two disagreed over {{the actions of}} the Chicago Police Department and the protesters at the ongoing convention. In reference to the response of the police involved in supposedly taking down a Viet Cong flag, moderator Howard K. Smith asked whether raising a Nazi flag during the Second World War would have elicited a similar response. Vidal responded that people were free to state their political views as they saw fit, whereupon Buckley interrupted and noted that people were free to speak their views but others were also free to ostracize them for holding those views, noting that in the U.S. during the Second World War [...] "some people were pro-Nazi and they were well treated by those who ostracized them—and I'm for ostracizing people who egg on other people to shoot American Marines and American soldiers. I know you [...] don't care because you have no sense of identification with—". Vidal then interjected that [...] "the only sort of pro- or crypto-Nazi I can think of is yourself," [...] whereupon Smith interjected, [...] "Now let's not call names." [...] Buckley, visibly angered, rose several inches from his seat and replied, [...] "Now listen, you queer, stop <b>calling</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> crypto-Nazi or I'll sock you in your goddamn face, and you'll stay plastered." [...] Buckley later apologized in print for having called Vidal a [...] "queer" [...] in a burst of anger rather than in a clinical context, but also reiterated his distaste for Vidal as an [...] "evangelist for bisexuality": [...] "The man who in his essays proclaims the normalcy of his affliction, and in his art the desirability of it, is {{not to be confused with}} the man who bears his sorrow quietly. The addict is to be pitied and even respected, not the pusher." [...] The debates are chronicled in the 2015 documentary Best of Enemies.|$|E

The alleged {{exchange}} occurred {{late in the game}} when the Patriots retook the lead with 44 seconds remaining. Several penalties occurred in the closing minutes, including an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty when Raven Linebacker Bart Scott picked up a penalty flag and threw it into the stands in frustration of hearing the banter of Rolle and McKinnely. After the game, Rolle vented in the locker room to the reporters, [...] "The refs <b>called</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> boy. No. 110 <b>called</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> boy, I will be calling my agent in the morning and sending my complaint. I have a wife and three kids. Don't <b>call</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> boy. Don't <b>call</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> boy on the field during a game because I said, 'You've never played football before." [...] The NFL investigated the accusation.|$|R
