The last named was re-introduced to Rùm in 1975 and has successfully spread to various neighbouring islands, including Mull. There is a small population of red-billed chough concentrated on the islands of Islay and Colonsay.|$|E
5|$|The <b>corncrake</b> {{can be seen}} at {{the bridge}} of Banagher in the summer. Once a common summer visitor to Ireland, corncrakes have {{suffered}} drastic population declines over the last few decades and are threatened with global extinction. Conservation efforts have focused on changing harvesting times to avoid the nesting season, May to August. The hay meadows of the callows support large numbers of these birds – {{one of the few places}} in the world where this globally threatened species is still common.|$|E
5|$|Nationally {{important}} {{populations of}} breeding waders {{are present in}} the Outer Hebrides, including common redshank, dunlin, lapwing and ringed plover. The islands also provide a habitat for other important species such as <b>corncrake,</b> hen harrier, golden eagle and otter. Offshore, basking shark and various species of whale and dolphin can often be seen, and the remoter islands' seabird populations are of international significance. St Kilda has 60,000northern gannets, amounting to 24% of the world population; 49,000breeding pairs of Leach's petrel, up to 90% of the European population; and 136,000pairs of puffin and 67,000northern fulmar pairs, about 30% and 13% of the respective UK totals. Mingulay is an important breeding ground for razorbills, with 9,514pairs, 6.3% of the European population.|$|E

40|$|At {{the end of}} the 1980 s, {{the former}} USSR went through major {{economic}} and political changes. Sweeping reorganisation of the Russian agriculture resulted in widespread land abandonment and development of secondary forest. Here we report on this old field succession in northern European Russia where the majority of <b>Corncrakes</b> breed. After selecting sites through remote sensing, we ground-truthed 96 sites by collecting data on vegetation cover and composition. Combined with our knowledge of the local economy, we identified five stages of old field devel-opment from early abandonment to young forest. We recorded 22 calling <b>Corncrakes</b> in these abandoned fields, where total area under cultivation dropped below 50 % and number of cattle dropped below 25 % of their original 1990 levels. In contrast to early concerns about intensifi-cation of Russian agriculture and their negative effects on <b>Corncrakes,</b> our research discloses the opposite. Downscaling of agriculture and land abandonment lead to development of more abandoned fields which resulted in more potential habitat for breeding <b>Corncrakes.</b> We advise to address abandoned field succession in the breeding area when designing new bird surveys in Russia and other East European countries...|$|R
5|$|The corn crake, <b>corncrake</b> or landrail (Crex crex) is {{a bird in}} {{the rail}} family. It breeds in Europe and Asia as far east as western China, and migrates to Africa for the {{northern}} hemisphere's winter. It is a medium-sized crake with buff- or grey-streaked brownish-black upperparts, chestnut markings on the wings, and blue-grey underparts with rust-coloured and white bars on the flanks and undertail. The strong bill is flesh-toned, the iris is pale brown, and the legs and feet are pale grey. Juveniles are similar in plumage to adults, and downy chicks are black, as with all rails. There are no subspecies, although individuals from {{the east of the}} breeding range tend to be slightly paler than their western counterparts. The male's call is a loud krek krek, from which the scientific name is derived. The corn crake is larger than its closest relative, the African crake, which shares its wintering range; that species is also darker-plumaged, and has a plainer face.|$|E
25|$|In 1997 Irish bird {{illustrations}} {{were used}} for the new issues that spanned the changes of currency from the Irish pound, through dual currency, to the introduction of the euro. Lithographically printed on unwatermarked paper by a number of different printers, the stamps were designed by Killian Mullarney. These were the first definitives where all values were printed in full colour. The initial birds illustrated are: magpie, gannet, <b>corncrake,</b> wood pigeon, kingfisher, lapwing, blue tit, blackbird, robin, stonechat, ringed plover, puffin, song thrush, sparrowhawk, barn owl, white-fronted goose, grey head pintail and shelduck.|$|E
25|$|John Harold Hewitt (28 October 1907 – 22 June 1987), who {{was born}} in Belfast, Northern Ireland, was the most {{significant}} Belfast poet to emerge before the 1960s generation of Northern Irish poets that included Seamus Heaney, Derek Mahon and Michael Longley. He was appointed the first writer-in-residence at Queen's University Belfast in 1976. His collections include The Day of the <b>Corncrake</b> (1969) and Out of My Time: Poems 1969 to 1974 (1974). He was also made a Freeman of the City of Belfast in 1983, and was awarded honorary doctorates the University of Ulster and Queen's University Belfast.|$|E

25|$|The {{beaches of}} Luskentyre and Scarista are amongst the most spectacular. From the former {{the island of}} Taransay, where the BBC Television series Castaway 2000 was recorded, is seen most clearly from Harris. At Scarista the beach is a venue for surfing and kite buggying. Nearby the Harris Golf Club offers well kept greens and views of the hills, {{but there is no}} play on Sundays. Scarista is the birthplace of the author Finlay J. MacDonald, who wrote about growing up on Harris in the 1930s. His books: Crowdie and Cream, Crotal and White and The <b>Corncrake</b> and the Lysander paint a vivid and humorous picture of Hebridean life.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{the county}} pheasant, wood pigeon and feral pigeons are widespread. Swans, wild duck, kingfisher, and owls (the long-eared owl, the short-eared owl, and the barn owl) are less common - but plentiful. Red grouse, once common, are now {{extremely}} scarce. The species {{has been in}} decline for some decades. Threats include habitat degradation, disease, predation and over-hunting. Red grouse in Ireland are now considered threatened. The <b>corncrake,</b> also once very common, is now almost never seen. Smaller birds—such as crows, swallows, robins, wrens and so on—are very common. The first magpies in Ireland were recorded by Robert Leigh, of Rosegarland, County Wexford, as having appeared in the County of Wexford about 1676.|$|E

500|$|The proverbial use of {{the corn}} crake's call to {{describe}} someone with a grating or unmelodious voice is illustrated in the quotation [...] "thanks to a wee woman with a voice like a <b>corncrake</b> who believed she was an apprentice angel".

500|$|In {{some respects}} the Hebrides lack {{biodiversity}} {{in comparison to}} mainland Britain; for example, there are only half as many mammalian species. However, these islands provide breeding grounds for many important seabird species including the world's largest colony of northern gannets. Avian life includes the <b>corncrake,</b> red-throated diver, rock dove, kittiwake, tystie, Atlantic puffin, goldeneye, golden eagle and white-tailed sea eagle.

The eggs of the last breeding pair of [...] white-tailed sea eagle in the UK were taken by an egg collector on Skye in 1916 but the species has recently been re-introduced. The chough last bred on the island in 1900. Mountain hare (apparently absent in the 18th century) and rabbit are now abundant and preyed upon by wild cat and pine marten. The rich fresh water streams contain brown trout, Atlantic salmon and water shrew. Offshore the edible crab and edible oyster are also found, the latter especially in the Sound of Scalpay. There are nationally important horse mussel and brittlestar beds in the sea lochs and in 2012 a bed of 100 million flame shells was found during a survey of Loch Alsh. Grey Seals can be seen off the Southern coast.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to examine the use of space and habitat by <b>corncrakes,</b> so as to obtain {{information}} about the characteristics of potential breeding habitats.
