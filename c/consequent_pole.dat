40|$|Surface mounted {{permanent}} magnet synchronous machines are nowadays {{used in a}} wide range of applications and power ratings, thanks to their high efficiency and ease of control. However, when used in high-speed applications, the need of some feature retaining the magnets increases the effective magnetic air gap, thus lowering the performance of the motor. This paper proposes a rather unconventional rotor structure based on the <b>consequent</b> <b>pole</b> arrangement. Different rotor topologies are discussed and compared...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, the {{end effects}} of a {{partitioned}} stator flux reversal permanent magnet (PM) machine with a surface-mounted PM (SPM) inner stator and a <b>consequent</b> <b>pole</b> PM (CPM) inner stator are comparatively analyzed. It is found that due to higher saturated inner stator steel in a CPM machine, it suffers from larger end effect than the SPM machine. Influence of armature reaction on end effect is investigated by a finite-element (FE) analysis, together with that of aspect ratio, i. e., axial stack length to stator outer diameter. Furthermore, {{it is found that}} in the CPM machine, the optimal PM arcs for the highest average electromagnetic torque predicted by 2 -D and 3 -D FE are different due to the variation of end effect with PM arc. Prototypes with both SPM and CPM inner stators are built and tested to verify the FE analysis. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} an {{investigation}} into the unbalanced magnetic pull in brushless PM motors due to either magnetic asymmetry or rotor eccentricity. Several machines are investigated. These have different slot and pole number combinations. Some of the windings contain sub-harmonics and these are found to be more susceptible to UMP when there is rotor eccentricity and also to produce vibrating UMP. <b>Consequent</b> rotor <b>poles</b> are also found to produce high UMP under rotor eccentricity condition...|$|R
40|$|A novel dual-stator bidirectional-flux {{modulated}} {{permanent magnet}} (PM) machine {{is presented in}} this paper. The key of the design is to locate <b>consequent</b> PM <b>poles</b> in both stator and rotor sides and the merit is that the magnetic flux produced by either the rotating or stationary PMs and dual-stator windings can be modulated by the stator teeth and rotor iron segments. It is shown that with this flux modulation effect and improved reluctance torque effect, the torque density of the machine can be increased. The bidirectional flux modulation theory and operation principle of the machine are explained and analyzed using time-stepping finite element method. Department of Electrical Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|We present 1 {{resolution}} fast ultraviolet spectroscopy of YY Dra, coordinated U, B, V, R, and I photometry, and Hα spectroscopy. The UV continuum {{is strongly}} pulsed: we found 16 % semiamplitude pulses with period 264. 7 (1) s; {{there was no}} evidence for power at twice this period. The UBV pulses are in phase with the UV continuum pulsation. A color temperature of 105 K was found for the pulse spectrum, with a corresponding area 0. 5 % of the white dwarf surface. We refine the white dwarf spin period, obtaining Pspin = 529. 31 ± 0. 02 s. Optical pulses at 273 (1) s were also detected; we attribute these to reprocessing in structures fixed in the orbital frame. Variations in the C iv line profile are apparent when the data are folded on Pspin. Faint, broad line wings extending to ± 3000 km s− 1 appear simultaneously with the continuum pulsation maxima. This implies that accretion was occurring onto both magnetic <b>poles.</b> <b>Consequent</b> constraints on the accretion geometry and white dwarf mass are derived, and a minimum white dwarf mass of 0. 62 M is obtained. A color temperature T 30, 000 K is derived for the unpulsed emission...|$|R
40|$|The {{sedimentary}} sequence deposited {{during the}} deglaciation phase following the last glacial maximum in the Storfjorden trough, on the northwestern Barents Sea south of Svalbard, was sampled with 10 piston and gravity cores during the SVAIS and EGLACOM cruises. Three cores (SV- 02, SV- 03 and SV- 05) {{collected on the}} upper continental slope are characterized by a thin (20 – 40 cm) Holocene interval and a thick (up to 4. 5 m in core SV- 03) late Pleistocene sequence of finely laminated fine-grained sediments that have been interpreted as plumites deposited during the Melt Water Pulse 1 a (MWP- 1 a). Radiocarbon ages obtained {{at the top and}} bottom of this stratigraphic interval revealed that deposition occurred during less than two centuries at around 15 ka ago, with a very high sedimentary rate exceeding 3 cm a− 1. We studied the palaeomagnetic and rock magnetic properties of this interval, by taking magnetic measurements at 1 cm spacing on u-channel samples collected from the three cores. The data show that this sequence is characterized by good palaeomagnetic properties and the palaeomagnetic and rock magnetic trends may be correlated at high resolution from core to core. The obtained palaeomagnetic data therefore offer the unique opportunity to investigate in detail the rate of geomagnetic palaeosecular variation (PSV) in the high northern latitudes at a decadal scale. Notwithstanding the palaeomagnetic trends of the three cores may be closely matched, the amplitude of directional PSV and the <b>consequent</b> virtual geomagnetic <b>pole</b> (VGP) scatter (S) is distinctly higher in one core (SV- 05) than in the other two cores (SV- 02 andSV- 03). This might result from a variable proportion of two distinct populations of magnetic minerals in core SV- 05, as suggested by the variable tendency to acquire a gyromagnetic remanent magnetization at high fields during the AF demagnetization treatment. For the plumite interval of cores SV- 02 and SV- 03, where the magnetic mineralogy is uniform and magnetite is the main magnetic carrier, a S value of about 9 ◦ is obtained. We consider this value as a reliable approximation of palaeomagnetic secular variation at a latitude of 75 ◦N over a time interval spanning a couple of centuries around 15 ka ago...|$|R
