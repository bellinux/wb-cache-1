The spectral response of a plasmonic lens to a local, broadband excitation {{has rarely been}} studied despite its central importance in future applications. Here we use the unique combination of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and angle-resolved optical spectroscopy to probe the spectral response of a plasmonic lens. Such a lens consists {{of a series of}} concentric <b>circular</b> <b>slits</b> etched in a thick gold film. Spectrally broad, circular surface plasmon polariton (SPP) waves are electrically launched from the STM tip at the plasmonic lens center, and these waves scatter at the slits into a narrow, out-of-plane, light beam.

We then propose simple design rules for optimized light beaming with the smallest possible footprint. The spectral distribution of the emitted light depends not only on the SPP nanosource, but on the local density of electromagnetic states (EM-LDOS) at the nanosource position, which in turn depends on the cavity modes of the plasmonic microstructure. The key parameters for tailoring the spectral response of the plasmonic lens are the period of the slits forming the lens, the number of slits, and the lens inner diameter...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Surface {{parameterization}} is {{a fundamental}} tool in geometric modeling and processing. Most existing methods deal with simply connected disks. This work introduces a novel method to handle multiply connected surfaces based on holomorphic one-forms. The method maps genus zero surfaces with arbitrary number of boundaries to an annulus with concentric <b>circular</b> <b>slits.</b> Any two boundaries can be chosen to map to the inner circle and the outer circle, the other boundaries to slits. Equivalently, the surfaces can be mapped to a rectangle with horizontal slits. Compared to existing linear methods that require surface partition, this method is more intrinsic and automatic. Compared to the existing holomorphic one-form method that requires double covering, it is more efficient and has better control over singularities. Compared to the existing Ricci flow method, this one is linear and simpler. The proposed method has many merits. The images of boundaries are parallel line segments. This regularity not only helps improve the accuracy for surface matching with boundaries, but also makes quad-remeshing or mesh-spline conversion conversion convenient. The whole rectangle in texture domain is fully occupied without any gap or overlapping; this improves the packing efficiency for texture mapping. The positions of the slits are completely determined by the surface geometry, {{which can be treated}} as the finger print of the surface to classify surfaces by conformal equivalence. The algorithm is thoroughly explained in detail. Experimental results are demonstrated to show the usefulness of the algorithm for multiply connected domains.

40|$|The stack {{represents}} {{the core of}} standing wave engines since inside it the thermal energy is converted into mechanical energy. Commonly stacks are realized with straight pores whose sections have regular shapes (e. g. circular, rectangular). In these cases the viscous and thermal interactions are described by well-known spatially averaged thermal and viscous functions. Instead, for a materials having tortuous pore, {{there is a lack}} in theoretical description of the thermoacoustic phenomenon. This paper deals with the performance of a thermoacoustic engine in which a tortuous porous material is used as stack. The spatially averaged thermal and viscous functions are obtained by classical models used to describe the sound propagation inside a porous material. In particular the Johnson–Champoux–Allard model is considered. It requires the knowledge of five parameters instead of the only hydraulic radius used to describe the standard stack having straight pores (e. g. <b>circular,</b> <b>slit</b> or square pores). The physical meaning of these parameters is explained starting from a straight circular pore and modifying, step by step, the shape of the pore until it becomes tortuous. The proposed functions have been included in the Rott theory and implemented in a numerical procedure. The achieved results are useful to analyse the thermoacoustic performance of a standing wave engine and to understand how the gain factor as well as the viscous and thermal losses inside the stack are affected by the tortuosity. A validation of this procedure is given by comparing the obtained results with ones given by DeltaEC software. This work can be useful to understand the applicability of tortuous porous materials, such as fibrous material as well as open-cell material, for standing wave thermoacoustic engines...|$|R
