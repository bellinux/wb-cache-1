5000|$|... “Turning {{away from}} coke” and {{replacing}} {{it in the first}} phase with natural gas became one of the main directions of the modernisation of production. The localisation of the factory in the territory through which the south main gas conduit east - west ran made such decision obvious. Azoty, located nearest to the natural gas deposits among all largest recipients, had good conditions to exploit this material. The program of intensification of the production of ammonia and fertilisers, also named “Tarnów I”, was performed in steps. The initial aim was the reconstruction of the ammonia plant to reach the capacity of 480 tons per day by further development of two new gas generators for ammonia synthesis out of coke and two generators producing gas for ammonia synthesis on the basis of natural gas, <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>installations</b> for natural gas conversion, modernisation of gas purification for ammonia synthesis out of carbon oxide by implementation of a so-called copper washing method. In the scope of expansion of productive capacities of nitric acid, five new units for technological nitric acid with pressure method designed in cooperation with T. Hobler (so-called Hydro-Nitro-Hobler) were commissioned, the second unit for nitric acid with non-pressure method was built, and, then, the installation for nitric acid condensed to 110 tons per day and nitrous vitriols to 180 tons per day was intensified.|$|E
40|$|The solar light {{radiation}} intercepted by the earth represents an energy flow {{more than four}} orders of magnitude larger than the present global energy demand. On the earth's surface, one third of this flow is available for the energy supply of man, mainly {{in the form of}} light, but also in substantial quantities as wind-energy, wave-energy, hydroenergy and biomass. The utilization of this energy-income requires the development and <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>installations</b> ranging from simple domestic hot water systems and small photovoltaic generators to huge solar power towers and ocean thermal energy converters. Additionally, the social, economic, financial and legal structures associated with the supply and con-sumption of energy will have to be revised...|$|E
40|$|The {{greatest}} {{potential for}} the future development of renewable energy in the region lies in biomass. It is comprised of materials {{of plant and animal}} origin, fit for an energy utilisation. Slovakia is considered to have ideal natural conditions for developing the biomass energy, it is definitely among countries that are rich in biomass. But the environmental awareness in Slovakia is still low and many people consider biomass as a fuel used by nature enthusiasts and environmentalists. A successful project implementation, in which people can see in practice that pellets are a competitive and a cost-effective heating fuel, might be a “first step” overcoming the people’s mistrustfulness. A real development of renewables will only be possible on the assumption of effective supportive legislative and economic measures such as: incentive purchase prices, soft investment credits in the <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>installations,</b> country-wide support schemes, promotion of domestic manufacture of equipment, tax reliefs and strong research support...|$|E

40|$|To prevent catastrophic {{results of}} climate change, the {{stabilization}} of atmospheric concentrations of CO 2 below 450 or even 350 {{parts per million}} is necessary. The large-scale electricity generation from renewable energy sources is one of possible options to satisfy the world's growing energy demand and to reduce green house gas emissions from electricity generation. Several studies show technical viability of large-scale deployment of concentrated solar power in North African countries and its further transmission to Europe. Political will exists {{from the side of}} European Union and North African countries to develop renewable energy sources in the Mediterranean region. The Mediterranean Solar Plan, launched by the French presidency, foresees deployment of 20 GW of new solar facilities in the Mediterranean region by 2020. The European Union has a goal to increase the share of renewable energy sources in final energy consumption by 20 % by 2020. Besides, within the EU framework there will be an opportunity for trading renewable energy Guarantees of Origin (GOs), which stimulates import of renewable electricity to Europe. The North African countries introduced ambitious goals of development of renewable energy sources. Based on the Desertec concept, the European industrial enterprises formed a consortium with ambitious goal to develop renewable energy sources in North Africa. The socio-economic development, however, is one of a major concern within the North African countries and international development organizations. In this paper, we present the preliminary results from research conducted {{in the second half of}} the year 2009 and the first half of year 2010, as part of the Addressing North African Questions in the Context of Renewable Energy Development (ANORAQ) project, supported by the European Climate Foundation. The project investigates barriers for deployment of renewable energy sources from the perspective of North African policymakers and concerns. Among other issues like security of supply and technical constraints such as water usage, we focus on socio-economic aspects of large-scale deployment of renewable energy sources. What are the likely employment effects of concentrated solar power development? Will it lead to creation of additional work-places? In which areas direct jobs will be created? Will they be created just in operation and management of plants? What will be the ration of local and international jobs in <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>installations</b> and manufacturing of components? What will be a multiplier effect on creation of indirect jobs? Will the jobs created in new sectors compensate for losses of jobs in other sectors? While our subject will be the North African region as a whole, we will particularly focus on two countries, Egypt and Morocco. There are reasons to assume that influence of large scale deployment of renewables will be different on economies of these two countries as their local economic and resource conditions are different. Egypt is characterized by large non-renewable energies reserves as Morocco covers almost all of its energy needs of imports...|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY: The Natural Gas Act (NGA) {{requires}} {{that prior to}} the <b>construction</b> or extension <b>of</b> any natural gas facilities, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) must issue a certificate that authorizes a natural gas company to undertake the proposed activity. However, under the Commission’s regulations, the <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> auxiliary <b>installations</b> or replacement facilities, while subject to the Commission’s NGA jurisdiction, are not treated as the <b>construction</b> or extension <b>of</b> facilities, and thus do not require certificate authorization. The Commission proposes to revise its regulations to clarify that all activities related to the <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> auxiliary <b>installations</b> and replacement facilities must take place within a company’s certificated right-of-way using previously approved work spaces. In addition, the Commission proposes to add landowner notification requirements for auxiliary installations, replacement facilities, and other jurisdictional activities performed within the right-of-way.
