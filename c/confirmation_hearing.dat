40|$|Introduction: in 1994, a {{study was}} {{performed}} with 200 {{children and adolescents}} suffering from hearing toss. It concluded that the diagnostic <b>confirmation</b> of <b>hearing</b> toss within 2 years of age occurred in just 13 % of the cases, although 56 % were suspected in that phase. the loss of time of over 2 years between suspicion and <b>confirmation</b> of <b>hearing</b> loss occurred in 42 % of the cases. Objectives: the comparison of the main hearing loss etiologies-genetic cause, consanguinity, congenital rubella, meningitis, perinatal. events and unknown causes-in children and adolescents in the periods of 1990 - 1994 and 1994 - 2000; comparison of incidence, in mates and females, for each etiology and among the others; comparison of age at the first consultation, for each and among them; and the investigation {{as to whether the}} time between suspicion and diagnosis of hearing Loss was different for each etiology and among the others. Methods: During the period of 1990 - 2000, of the 519 children and adolescents with hearing toss, 442 individuals were selected, in the two moments of the study: 1990 - 1994 and 1994 - 2000. the variables used were: sex, age at first consultation, suspected etiotogy and time between suspicion and <b>confirmation</b> of <b>hearing</b> loss. Results: Congenital. rubella, genetic and perinatal. causes, meningitis, consanguinity and unknown causes were responsible for over 80 % of all etiologies, in both periods. There were no differences between the sexes in the periods studied. There was no relation among age, sex and etiology. Among the etiologies studied, there were no differences in the lengths of times between suspicion and <b>confirmation</b> of <b>hearing</b> loss, in each period separately. the comparative study showed that congenital rubella, genetic and unknown causes took longer times between suspicion and <b>confirmation</b> of <b>hearing</b> loss, for the period of 1990 - 1994, as compared with 1994 - 2000. Conclusions: Congenital rubella remains as an important etiology, as welt post-meningitis deafness. Age at first consultation did not show relationship to the hearing loss etiology nor to sex. Independently of whether the etiology being pre-natal, perinatal or post-natal, congenital or acquired, the length of time between suspicion and <b>confirmation</b> of <b>hearing</b> loss did not differ between the periods studied, separately.

50|$|For the Catholic laity, the {{restrictions}} {{on their ability to}} exercise freedom of worship in public settings and the closure of churches in their communities may have had greater resonance than the matter of State regulation of the clergy. Community celebrations of their patron saint, processions, pilgrimage to religious sites, and other visible manifestations of religious belief undermined the essence of many rural communities. The absence of a priest to baptize children, prepare Catholics for <b>confirmation,</b> <b>hear</b> confession, perform marriages, and administer the last rites of Extreme Unction before death, meant that the rhythm of the sacramental life cycle for individuals and their families as well as their larger community was being suppressed.Lay organizations became important during the crisis, a strategy of the hierarchy to strengthen Catholic resistance without the hierarchy’s direct intervention, but there is also evidence of widespread lay Catholic desire to either passively resist the anticlerical measures, as opposed to the active and often violent resistance of the Cristero fighters.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND Children with {{bilateral}} permanent {{hearing impairment}} often have impaired language and speech abilities. However, {{the effects of}} universal newborn screening for permanent bilateral childhood hearing impairment {{and the effects of}} <b>confirmation</b> of <b>hearing</b> impairment by nine months of age on subsequent verbal abilities are uncertain. METHODS We studied 120 children with bilateral permanent hearing impairment identified from a large birth cohort in southern England, at a mean of 7. 9 years of age. Of the 120 children, 61 were born during periods with universal newborn screening and 57 had hearing impairment that was confirmed by nine months of age. The primary outcomes were language as compared with nonverbal ability and speech expressed as z scores (the number of standard deviations by which the score differed from the mean score among 63 age-matched children with normal hearing), adjusted for the severity of the hearing impairment and for maternal education RESULTS <b>Confirmation</b> of <b>hearing</b> impairment by nine months of age was associated with higher adjusted mean z scores for language as compared with nonverbal ability (adjusted mean difference for receptive language, 0. 82; 95 percent confidence interval, 0. 31 to 1. 33; and adjusted mean difference for expressive language, 0. 70; 95 percent confidence interval, 0. 13 to 1. 26). Birth during periods with universal newborn screening was also associated with higher adjusted z scores for receptive language as compared with nonverbal ability (adjusted mean difference, 0. 60; 95 percent confidence interval, 0. 07 to 1. 13), although the z scores for expressive language as compared with nonverbal ability were not significantly higher. Speech scores did not differ significantly between those who were exposed to newborn screening or early confirmation and those who were not. CONCLUSIONS Early detection of childhood hearing impairment was associated with higher scores for language but not for speech in midchildhood...|$|R

40|$|Where Universal Newborn Hearing Screening (UNHS) in Australia is concerned, {{there are}} two clear truths to the {{statement}} that “well begun is not all done”. First, given {{that it is now}} more than 7 years since the first state-wide UNHS program was introduced, it is apparent that what was well begun in New South Wales in 2002 is certainly not yet “all done” on a national level. Quite simply, we are still yet to achieve a situation where every newborn Australian child is guaranteed the opportunity to have their hearing screened. Second, even though the available evidence indicates that earlier identification of hearing loss is linked to better language and educational outcomes for children with congenital hearing loss (Kennedy et al., 2006; Yoshinaga-Itano, 2004), it is abundantly clear that those benefits are not guaranteed simply by the act of early identification. From a developmental and educational perspective, the real benefits of earlier identification and <b>confirmation</b> of <b>hearing</b> loss lie in securing the basis for earlier intervention. The extent of the advantage gained by earlier identification still lies in the quality and timeliness of the interventions that proceed from that identification—not the act of identification itself...|$|R
