5|$|As {{the figures}} {{given in the}} table above were {{published}} before the turbines had been operational for a full year they are projected rather than recorded figures. Wind speed is not constant, therefore, a wind farm's annual energy production never achieves {{the sum of the}} generator nameplate ratings multiplied by the total hours in a year. The ratio of actual productivity in a year to this theoretical maximum is called the capacity factor. Typical capacity factors are 20–40%, with values at {{the upper end of the}} range achieved on particularly favourable sites. The expected capacity factor for Scout Moor Wind Farm, <b>calculated</b> <b>from</b> the company's projected figures, is 27%. The actual capacity factor <b>calculated</b> <b>from</b> data published by OFGEM for June 2016 to May 2017 was 25.20%.|$|E

NGC 891 is incredibly faint and small despite its magnitude of 9.9, as its surface brightness of 14.6 indicates; it is 13.5 by 2.8 arcminutes in size. NGC 891 was discovered by the brother-and-sister team of William and Caroline Herschel in August 1783.

5|$|Birds {{returning}} {{north in}} spring across the central Mediterranean appear {{to follow a}} well-defined route. Large concentrations of ruffs form every year at particular stopover sites to feed, and individuals marked with rings or dye reappear in subsequent years.

The ruff stores fat as a fuel, but unlike mammals, uses lipids as {{the main energy source}} for exercise (including migration) and, when necessary, keeps warm by shivering; however, little research has been conducted on the mechanisms by which they oxidise lipids.|$|E
5|$|The {{properties}} of thorium vary widely {{depending on the}} degree of impurities in the sample. The major impurity is usually thorium dioxide (ThO2); even the purest thorium specimens usually contain about a tenth of a percent of the dioxide. Experimental measurements of its density give values between 11.5and11.66g/cm3: these are slightly lower than the theoretically expected value of 11.7g/cm3 <b>calculated</b> <b>from</b> thorium's lattice parameters, perhaps due to microscopic voids forming in the metal when it is cast. These values lie between those of its neighbours actinium (10.1g/cm3) and protactinium (15.4g/cm3), part of a trend across the early actinides.|$|E
