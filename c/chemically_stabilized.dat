Its insecticidal activity has relatively low mammalian toxicity and an unusually fast biodegradation. Their development coincided with the identification of problems with DDT use. Their work consisted firstly of identifying the most active components of pyrethrum, extracted from East African chrysanthemum flowers and long known to have insecticidal properties.

According to company reports, during the 1990s, an arsenic {{precipitation}} plant was installed at the Pompora Treatment Plant for the commercial recovery of arsenic from the roaster flue gases. At the time, the recovered arsenic trioxide was sold to Europe for commercial applications.

This behaviour is largely determined by the amount and stability of the retained austenite dispersion in the microstructure, produced by a two-stage heat-treatment, consisting of intercritical annealing followed by an isothermal bainitic treatment. The amount and stability of retained austenite is mainly determined by the proper selection of the temperature and temporal duration of the bainitic treatment. In the present work an approach is presented which allows for the calculation {{of the amount of}} retained austenite in the microstructure, as a function of bainitic treatment conditions. The approach is based on the physical characteristics of the bainitic transformation and on the stabilizing effects of the formation of bainitic ferrite in austenite.
