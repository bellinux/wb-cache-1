40|$|Vibration {{tests were}} {{performed}} on a 9 story reinforced concrete building with basement, in order to investigate its dynamical characteristics, by exciting the building with 2 vibration generators installed on its 9 th floor. The natural periods of vibration, {{the value of the}} damping, and the mode shapes, in the N-S and E-W directions and in torsion, were determined by measurement. Before {{the main part of the}} testing was carried out, some preliminary tests were made to check the correctness of some assumptions which would simplify the main test procedure. It was possible to investigate in detail only the first mode of each type of motion, because of the relatively high rigidity of the building and a limitation on the maximum frequency at which the shakers could be driven. The periods measured were quite short for a 9 story building, 0. 505 sec in the N-S direction, 0. 662 sec in the E- W direction, and 0. 346 sec in torsion, and their values increased by about 3 per cent when the tests were performed at the highest force levels. The damping, which consistently increased as the exciting force increased, varied between 0. 70 and 2. 00 per cent of the <b>critical</b> <b>viscous</b> <b>damping.</b> The periods and damping values were also deter- mined at very low force levels by exciting the building with a rhythmical movement of the operator's body. The periods measured in this way were slightly smaller than those found using the shakers, and the damping varied between 0. 6 and 0. 9 per cent of the <b>critical</b> <b>viscous</b> <b>damping.</b> The mode shape did not seem to be well defined for the lower force levels, but after the force level reached a certain minimum value, the normalized mode shape remained unchanged, both with further increases in the forces, and with changes in the frequency of excitation. However, in both the N-S direction and in torsion, the horizontal displacements of the first and basement floors consistently increased, on the order of 3 per cent with respect to the displacements of the upper floors as the exciting force increased. Some aspects of the dynamical behavior of buildings, which have not been studied by other investigators in previous tests, were examined. It is a common practice in the seismic analysis of structures to assume that the floor systems act as rigid diaphragms when the building is acted upon by horizontal forces, and also to assume that the structure is fixed at the ground level. It was found that the first assumption was correct, but instead of the second it is more accurate to assume that the building is fixed at the foundation, and not at ground level. The vibration of the ground in the vicinity of the building was also measured, together with the vibrations of the basement and first floor. It was also possible to measure the acceleration at the top of one of the units of the air conditioning equipment located on the roof. The acceleration at the top of this unit was about 8. 5 times that of the roof...|$|E
40|$|Oral presentation. Paper 135. Passive energy {{dissipation}} has advantages such as low cost, easily predictable response, {{and ease of}} implementation, which are offset by difficulty tuning or designing devices for optimum behaviour over a range of inputs and responses. Semiactive systems offer customised response and provide a control input that adapts to structural response without excessive energy input. Specific control laws can simultaneously reduce displacement and total base-shear transmitted to the foundation – a unique semi-active capability. These significant advantages can be offset by the limited {{energy dissipation}} that can arise as a result. This research focuses on a more effective resetable device control law called the “diamond control law,” for its unique semi-actively enabled device hysteresis loop, which maximises energy dissipation while simultaneously minimising the impact on base shear forces. It achieves this affect by controlling the release of stored energy in the resetable device - smart dissipation in place of maximum or instantaneous uncontrolled release typically used in such devices. A spectral analysis shows that this new approach enables a decrease of 30 - 40 % for both displacement and structural force, which is equivalent to 15 - 20 % <b>critical</b> <b>viscous</b> <b>damping</b> for an uncontrolled base structure. The total base shear is also decreased by 40 %, which has significant potential benefits for retrofit applications. This level of displacement and base shear reductions was not available (in combination) from prior resetable device control approaches, nor from any passive device or system, and thus represents a significant expansion of the design space and capability for seismic energy dissipation...|$|E
40|$|This {{validation}} study examines {{the effect on}} vibroacoustic response resulting from the installation of cable bundles on a curved orthogrid panel. Of interest {{is the level of}} damping provided by the installation of the cable bundles and whether this damping could be potentially leveraged in launch vehicle design.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the free motion of a single-degree-of-freedom damped linear {{dynamical}} system can be characterized as overdamped, underdamped, or critically damped.

40|$|AbstractBy {{advancing}} the technologies regarding seismic control of structures {{and development of}} earthquake resistance systems in the past decades application {{of different types of}} earthquake energy dissipation system has incredibly increased. <b>Viscous</b> <b>damper</b> device as a famous and the simplest earthquake energy dissipation system is implemented in many new structures and numerous number of researches have been done on the performance of viscous dampers in structures subjected to earthquake. The experience of recent severe earthquakes indicates that sometimes the earthquake energy dissipation devices are damaged during earthquakes and there is no function for structural control system. So, damage of earthquake energy dissipation systems such as <b>viscous</b> <b>damper</b> device must be considered during design of earthquake resistance structures. This paper demonstrates the development of three-dimensional elasto-plastic <b>viscous</b> <b>damper</b> element consisting of elastic damper in the middle part and two plastic hinges {{at both ends of the}} element which are compatible with the constitutive model to reinforce concrete structures and are capable to detect failure and damage in <b>viscous</b> <b>damper</b> device connections during earthquake excitation.
