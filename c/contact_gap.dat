At the same time, the electric field is very high across the small <b>contact</b> <b>gap.</b> The breakdown of the gap produces a vacuum arc. As the alternating current passes through a zero, and the gap between the fixed and moving contact widens, the conductive plasma produced by the arc moves away from the gap and becomes non-conductive. The current is interrupted, unless the impressed voltage is large enough to break down the wider gap of the open contacts.|$|E

" The contact tightness has been equated to the mean <b>contact</b> <b>gap</b> between those two items. Accurate methods for both control and measurement of this gap have been utilised for this task. The experiment was devised so that precision adjustments to the <b>contact</b> <b>gap</b> could be made externally, and the wall panel was repeatedly adjusted and its thermal resistance measured, with no disturbance to {{any other part of}} the wall. The results showed that the mean <b>contact</b> <b>gap</b> could be adjusted between a mini-mum of 0. 5 mm and a chosen maximum of 3 mm. Variations solely in the tightness of fit between frame and facing (equated here to the mean <b>contact</b> <b>gap)</b> were found to produce up to- 30 % variation (16 % per face), from 1. 30 to 1. 51 m 20 C/W, in the rated R-Values of the test panels studied.

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} {{was to find a}} {{correlation}} between <b>contact</b> <b>gap</b> length and switching be-havior of a vacuum circuit breaker. A large number of interruption experiments was executed in a vacuum chamber with butt type contacts made of Cu, CuCr 50 / 50 and AgWC. The currents to be interrupted varied from 2. 5 to 32 kA. The rate of change of current and recovery voltage were kept at a fixed value at current zero.

The total amount of energy dissipated in the vacuum chamber appears to be determinative for the type of re-ignition.

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{explores the}} role of PTFE ablation in enhancing current interruption for various background gases in high voltage circuit breakers. An assessment of the current interruption capability {{has been made in}} terms of the arcing duration and the <b>contact</b> <b>gap</b> length at which critical arc extinction is achieved. These observations are supported by measurements of the magnitude of extinction and re-ignition voltage peaks. Most previous and other current experimental work on gas filled circuit breaker design follows conventional wisdom in investigating arcing behaviours at elevated gas pressures (usually up to 6 bar). But in this work we concentrate on the effects of using low gas pressures (less than 1 bar) {{in the presence of a}} close-fitting shield of ablatant polymer material (PTFE) that surrounds the electrode assembly of an experimental high power circuit breaker. We demonstrate that for several different gases, arc extinction capability compares well under these conditions with SF 6, suggesting that SF 6 could be replaced entirely in this novel system by more environmentally friendly gases. Moreover, the critical <b>contact</b> <b>gap</b> lengths at extinction are only slightly greater than when using SF 6 at 6 bar.

30|$|The laboratory-calibrated load-stress {{transitive}} relation {{differs from the}} real load-stress {{transitive relation}}. This difference {{is caused by the}} difference between the constraints on the road and those on the laboratory bench, even if the laboratory bench installs the bogie, including spring, axle box, rod, anti-yaw bracket, and other related accessories, according to actual operating conditions. The most significant influencing factors are rigidity matching and gap issues. Different constraint stiffness values and <b>contact</b> <b>gaps</b> in the same direction may offset or increase the stress caused by different loads. Another cause for such a difference is the effect of the changing wheel-rail contact point on the arm of force. Therefore, from a statistical perspective, the optimized load-stress transitive relation is more reasonable than that calibrated by laboratory bench. The stress calculated by the optimized transfer coefficient still exhibits a certain degree of deviation from the measured signal. Such deviation is mainly caused by partial loads. For example, primary vertical damper loads and secondary horizontal damper loads are not measured in this test. Another reason is that elastic vibration phenomenon exists in the local structure (e.g., motor bracket). Overall, load and stress exhibit a linear relationship under the operating conditions.|$|R
