40|$|After Crawford v. Washington {{opened the}} door to a <b>Confrontation</b> Clause debate in 2004, the United States Supreme Court has {{consistently}} confronted <b>confrontation</b> issues arising out of the Crawford interpretation. One issue that the Supreme Court has not yet tackled is whether the <b>Confrontation</b> Clause applies during non-capital and capital sentencing. While many states and federal courts continue to hold that no right of <b>confrontation</b> during sentencing exists, many other courts have chosen to apply a right of <b>confrontation</b> in both capital and non-capital sentencing. This Note takes two new approaches to the <b>Confrontation</b> Clause at sentencing debate. First, this Note addresses both the text of the Sixth Amendment and the history surrounding the <b>Confrontation</b> Clause to conclude that the right of <b>confrontation</b> should apply during sentencing, or at least during capital sentencing. Second, this Note rejects the rationale that Williams v. New York is the controlling precedent in the <b>confrontation</b> at sentencing debate. Under this approach, applying the <b>Confrontation</b> Clause at sentencing may be the next logical step in <b>Confrontation</b> Clause jurisprudence...|$|R
40|$|Speaking {{up about}} or confronting {{everyday}} prejudice creates {{more positive attitudes}} towards groups in the short-term. However, the mechanism underlying <b>confrontation</b> 2 ̆ 7 s prejudice reducing effect remains unclear. Because one goal of confronting prejudice is attitude change, a persuasion framework provides a theoretical model for research. Based on an integration of the confronting prejudice and persuasion literatures, I developed and tested three hypotheses {{about the effects of}} <b>confrontation</b> and elaboration of <b>confrontation</b> messages on observers 2 ̆ 7 attitudes and behavior in the short- and longer-term. I expected that observing a <b>confrontation</b> (vs. no <b>confrontation)</b> reduces prejudice and discrimination; that elaborating on <b>confrontation</b> messages reduces prejudice and discrimination more than <b>confrontation</b> alone; and that elaborating on <b>confrontation</b> messages causes attitude change that lasts longer than <b>confrontation</b> alone. To test these hypotheses, participants were recruited to complete measures of sexism and feelings toward subtypes of women across three time points (i. e., pre-test, lab manipulation, and post-test). During the lab manipulation, participants imagined observing sexist jokes that were either confronted or not confronted. In addition, participants in <b>confrontation</b> conditions then wrote a control essay or an essay elaborating on the <b>confrontation.</b> Across these manipulations, there were three conditions to which 361 participants were randomly assigned: no <b>confrontation</b> control, confrontation-only, or confrontation+elaboration. 1 – 14 days after the lab manipulation, 161 participants completed the post-test, which included a measure of discrimination, ostensibly as part of an unrelated study. Results indicated that observing a <b>confrontation</b> (vs. no <b>confrontation)</b> resulted in more positive feelings toward women and less discrimination in the short- and longer-term, but there was no significant reduction in sexism. Contrary to predictions, elaboration of <b>confrontation</b> messages did not reduce prejudice or discrimination more than <b>confrontation</b> alone. In addition, elaborated <b>confrontation</b> did not cause attitude change to last longer over time. Overall, this study suggests that confronting prejudice reduces prejudice and discrimination in observers in the longer-term but that this effect is not enhanced by elaborating on <b>confrontation</b> messages. ...|$|R

5|$|Deliberate self-harm is {{especially}} prevalent in prison populations. A proposed {{explanation for this}} is that prisons are often violent places, and prisoners who wish to avoid physical <b>confrontations</b> may resort to self-harm as a ruse, either to convince other prisoners that they are dangerously insane and resilient to pain or to obtain protection from the prison authorities. Self-harm also occurs frequently in inmates who are placed in solitary confinement.|$|E

40|$|After Crawford v.

40|$|Research {{investigating}} interpersonal outcomes {{resulting from}} <b>confrontation</b> of bias shows mixed results. Some {{studies show that}} men expect to react harshly when imagining <b>confrontation</b> (Saunders 2 ̆ 6 Senn, 2009), whereas other research finds that men often react well when actually confronted (Mallett 2 ̆ 6 Wagner, 2011). The current studies investigated this inconsistency by exploring the role of men 2 ̆ 7 s interaction goals on men 2 ̆ 7 s goal-directed compensation and interpersonal outcomes following <b>confrontation.</b> In Study 1, I measured accessibility of three goals (liking, respect, egalitarian) after men either imagined or experienced <b>confrontation</b> for sexist or uninformed behavior (gender-neutral). An egalitarian goal was the most accessible goal when men experienced <b>confrontation</b> for sexism, supporting the idea that actual <b>confrontation</b> leads to other-focus. Further supporting the assertion that general and imagined threats lead to self-focus (Crocker, 2008), a respect goal was uniquely accessible when men imagined gender-neutral <b>confrontation.</b> In Study 2, men were primed with either an other-oriented liking goal or a self-oriented respect goal. I then observed men 2 ̆ 7 s self-promoting or ingratiating compensation following <b>confrontation</b> for sexism or uninformed behavior by a female interaction partner. <b>Confrontation</b> for sexism elicited immediate ingratiation from men, but neither <b>confrontation</b> affected self-promotion. Men 2 ̆ 7 s ingratiation also mediated the relation between liking goal pursuit and positive interpersonal outcomes. Together, these studies enhance our understanding of men 2 ̆ 7 s responses to <b>confrontation...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{accuracy}} of <b>confrontation</b> visual field testing was determined for 512 visual fields using automated static perimetry as the reference standard. The sensitivity of <b>confrontation</b> testing excluding patchy defects was 40 % for detecting anterior visual field defects, 68. 3 % for posterior defects, and 50 % for both anterior and posterior visual field defects combined. The sensitivity within each group varied {{depending on the}} type of visual field defect encountered. <b>Confrontation</b> testing had a high sensitivity (75 % to 100 %) for detecting altitudinal visual loss, central/centrocecal scotoma, and homonymous hemianopsia. <b>Confrontation</b> testing was fairly insensitive (20 % to 50 % sensitivity) for detecting arcuate scotoma and bitemporal hemianopsia. The specificity of <b>confrontation</b> testing was high at 93. 4 %. The high positive predictive value (72. 6 %) and negative predictive value (75. 7 %) would indicate that visual field defects identified during <b>confrontation</b> testing are often true visual field defects.

5|$|On 14–19 December 1970 mass demonstrations {{against the}} price rises {{broke out in}} the {{northern}} coastal cities of Gdańsk, Gdynia, Elbląg and Szczecin. In violent <b>confrontations</b> at those and other locations 19 public buildings were destroyed or damaged, including the party headquarters in Gdańsk and Szczecin. The PZPR Central Committee was deliberating in Warsaw, but a smaller conference, led by Gomułka, issued an authorization for a limited use of lethal force to defend lives and property. Nevertheless, Gomułka remained determined to impose a forceful resolution of the conflict. Among the leaders of the party who arrived on the coast and directed the local enforcement actions, initially in Gdańsk, were Zenon Kliszko and Stanisław Kociołek. In Gdynia, the soldiers were instructed to prevent protesters from returning to factory buildings; they fired into a crowd of workers emerging from commuter trains. Fatal <b>confrontations</b> took place also in Szczecin.
