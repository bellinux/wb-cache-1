Our decision model allocates recycling collection {{points to the}} available <b>centralized</b> <b>return</b> <b>center</b> based on its capacity and ensures similar allocation to all facilities via optimal routing for trucks. The study addresses several pertinent questions {{such as how to}} deal with higher collection cost, how to develop a model that jointly considers operational cost reduction along with the achievement of higher environmental benefits, how to reduce sub optimization which is quite common when using standalone decision models, and what are the feasible ways to increase the utilization of collection facilities. We validate the model using data retrieved from a case study in India using a conventional decomposed modelling approach. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed integrated model reduces over ten percent of total recycling costs for both single and multiple products. The results also suggest managers to reduce variances in product quality levels in order to achieve substantial total costs reduction. In addition, to increase the plastic recycling returns and reduce the operational cost, managers need to cluster the customers based on the facility location and offer attractive incentives...|$|E

40|$|This {{article is}} a {{theoretical}} approach on retail reverse logistics. Environmental concern and the current marketing strategy have spurred retailers to implement strategies to facilitate product returns from end customers. Reverse logistics, indicating the process of this return flow, encompasses such activities as the movement of returned products, facilities to accommodate returned items, and overall remedy process for returned items. The retail industry, under great competitive pressure, has used return policies as a competitive weapon. Grocery retailers {{were the first to}} begin to focus serious attention on the problem of returns and to develop reverse logistics innovations. Grocery retailers first developed innovations such as reclamation centers. Reclamation centers, in turn, led to the establishment of <b>centralized</b> <b>return</b> <b>centers.</b> <b>Centralizing</b> <b>returns</b> has led to significant benefits for most firms that have implemented them. Over the last several years, retailers have consolidated. Now, more than ever, reverse logistics is seen as being important.

40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} an open-loop reverse supply chain, which includes a single <b>centralized</b> <b>returns</b> <b>center</b> (CRC) and multiple local collection points (LCPs). Each LCP receives a stream of returned products from consumers and once its inventory reaches its economic inventory level, these products are immediately delivered to the CRC.

An algorithm to find an optimal policy of delivery batch size for LCPs and handling batch size for CRC is developed. We present detailed discussions on how the optimal policy of delivery as well as the handling batch sizes changes with respect to changes in system parameters. We show that the formulas for optimal policies of delivery and handling batch sizes are modifications of the EOQ model.

40|$|Reverse {{logistics}} {{are becoming}} more and more important in the overall Industry area because of the environment and business factors. Planning and implementing a suitable reverse logistics network could bring more profit, customer satisfaction, and an excellent social picture for companies. But, most of the logistics networks are not equipped to handle the return products in reverse channels. Reverse logistics processes and plans rely heavily on reversing the supply chain so that companies can correctly identify and categorize returned products for disposition, an area that offers many opportunities for additional revenue. The science of reverse logistics includes return policy administration, product recall protocols, repairs processing, product repackaging, parts management, recycling, product disposition management, maximizing liquidation values and much more. The focus of this project is to develop a reverse logistics management system/ tools (RLMS). The proposed tools are demonstrated in the following order. First, we identify the risks involved in the reverse supply chain. Survey tool is used to collect data and information required for analysis. The methodologies that are used to identify key risks are the six sigma tools, namely Define, Measure, Analyse, Improve and Control (DMAIC), SWOT analysis, cause and effect, and Risk Mapping. An improved decision-making method using fuzzy set theory for converting linguistic data into numeric risk ratings has been attempted. In this study, the concept of ‘Left and Right dominance approach’(Chen and Liu, 2001) and Method of ‘In center of centroids’ (Thoran et al., 2012 a,b) for generalized trapezoidal fuzzy numbers has been used to quantify the ‘degree of risk’ in terms of crisp ratings. After the analysis, the key risks are identified are categorized, and an action requirement plan suggested for providing guidelines for the managers to manage the risk successfully in the context of reverse logistics. Next, from risk assessment findings, information technology risk presents the highest risk impact on the performance of the reverse logistics, especially lack of use of a decision support system (DSS). We propose a novel multi-attribute decision (MADM) support tool that can categorizes return products and make the best alternative selection of recovery and disposal option using carefully considered criteria using MADM decision making methodologies such as fuzzy MOORA and VIKOR. The project can be applied to all types of industries. Once the returned products are collected and categorized at the retailers/ Points of return (PoR), an optimized network is required to determine the number of reprocessing centres to be opened and the optimized optimum material flow between retailers, reprocessing, recycling and disposal centers at minimum costs. The research develops a mixed integer linear programming model for two scenarios, namely considering direct shipping from retailer/ PoR to the respective reprocessing centers and considering the use of <b>centralized</b> <b>return</b> <b>centers</b> (CRC). The models are solved using LINGO 15 software and excel solver tools respectively. The advantage of the implementation of our solution is that it will help improve performance and reduce time. This benefits the company by having a reduction in their cost due to uncertainties and also contributes to better customer satisfaction. Implementation of these tools at ABZ computer distributing company demonstrates how the reverse logistics management tools can used in order to be beneficial to the organization. The tool is designed to be easily implemented at minimal cost and serves as a valuable tool for personnel faced with significant and costly decisions regarding risk assessment, decision making and network optimization in the reverse supply chain practices...|$|R

40|$|We study an {{optimization}} problem associated with product returns initiated as a manage-ment decision. Returns {{are made from}} multiple stores to a <b>centralized</b> <b>return</b> facility in a retail network and eventually transported to the original manufacturer for refunds. Such returns are called strategic returns and the manufacturer accepts only a single shipment from the retailer. Therefore, the <b>centralized</b> <b>return</b> facility {{has to make a}} decision on how long it has to wait before making a shipment to the original manufacturer to claim refunds. The objective is to minimize the total cost minus the revenue: the cost is due to inventory, transportation to the manufacturer, and scrapping items not returned, while the revenue is due to the refund from the manufacturer. We consider two operational strategies: sta-tic and dynamic. Under the static strategy a shipment is made to the manufacturer at a predetermined time regardless of the number of items returned, whereas under the dynamic strategy such decisions are made adaptively depending on the number of items actually re-turned. Numerical studies are performed to gain managerial insights as well as compare the performance of the static and the dynamic approaches...|$|R

40|$|Many {{high-tech}} {{supply chain}} {{operate in a}} context of high process and market uncertainties due to shorter product life cycles. When introducing a new product, a company must manage the cost of supply, including the cost of returns over its short life cycle. The returns distribution looks like a negative exponential curve, starting with a high flow in returns for a period followed by a sudden drop and low from then on until the peak of life cycle. An important operations decision when launching a new product is the sizing of the capacity and location of <b>return</b> and repair <b>centers</b> in order to stay responsive and serve the market downstream after such a surge in early returns.

A simulation of such centralized PCPA by one-way multi-head pushdown automata (Balan 2009) turned out to be incomplete (Otto 2012). Subsequently it was shown that <b>centralized</b> <b>returning</b> PCPA are universal even if the number of components is two (Petersen 2013) and thus are separated from one-way multi-head pushdown automata. Another line of research modified the definition of PCPA such that communication is asynchronous (Otto 2013). While the simulation of one-way multi-head pushdown automata is still possible, now a converse construction shows this model in returning mode to be equivalent to the one-way multi-head pushdown automaton in a very precise sense.

40|$|Due to the {{emergence}} of e-commerce and the proliferation of liberal return policies, product returns have become daily routines for many companies. Considering the significant impact of product returns on the company’s bottom line, a growing number of companies have attempted to streamline the reverse logistics process. Products are usually returned to initial collection points (ICPs) in small quantities and thus increase the unit shipping cost due to lack of freight discount opportunities. One way to address this issue is to aggregate the returned products into a larger shipment. However, such aggregation increases the holding time at the ICP, which in turn increases the inventory carrying costs. Considering this logistics dilemma, the main objectives of this research are to minimize the total cost by determining the optimal location and collection period of holding time of ICPs; determining the optimal location of a <b>centralized</b> <b>return</b> centre; transforming the nonlinear objective function of the proposed model formulation by Min et al. (2006 a) into a linear form; and conducting a sensitivity analysis to the model solutions according to varying parameters such as shipping volume. Existing models and solution procedures are too complicated to solve real-world problems. Through a series of computational experiments, we discovered that the linearization model obtained the optimal solution {{at a fraction of the}} time used by the traditional nonlinear model and solution procedure, as well as the ability to handle up to 150 customers as compared to 30 in the conventional nonlinear model. As such, the proposed linear model is more suitable for actual industry applications than the existing models...|$|R
