50|$|Chitosan {{can also}} be used in water {{processing}} engineering {{as a part of a}} filtration process. Chitosan causes the fine sediment particles to bind together, and is subsequently removed with the sediment during sand filtration. It also removes phosphorus, heavy minerals, and oils from the water.Chitosan is an important additive in the filtration process. Sand filtration apparently can remove up to 50% of the turbidity alone, while the chitosan with sand filtration removes up to 99% turbidity. Chitosan has been used to <b>precipitate</b> <b>caseins</b> from bovine milk and cheese making.|$|R

40|$|Probably {{no single}} protein {{has been the}} subject of as many {{chemical}} investigations as has casein. This is to be expected since casein is the main protein constituent of the milk of all mammals and because it can be readily isolated in a more or less pure state and with reasonably reproducible properties. For one hundred years following Mulder’s discovery that <b>casein</b> may be <b>precipitated</b> from milk by the addition of acid, casein was considered the typical example of a homogeneous protein.

40|$|It is {{generally}} {{accepted as a}} fact in the biogas technology that protein-rich biomass substrates should be avoided due to inevitable process inhibition. Substrate compositions with a low C/N ratio are considered difficult to handle and may lead to process failure, though protein-rich industrial waste products have outstanding biogas generation potential. This common belief has been challenged by using protein-rich substrates, i. e. <b>casein</b> and <b>precipitated</b> pig blood protein in laboratory scale continuously stirred mesophilic fed-batch biogas fermenters. Both substrates proved suitable for sustained biogas production (0. 447 L CH 4 /g protein oDM, i. e. organic total solids) in high yield without any additives, following a period of adaptation of the microbial community. The apparent key limiting factors in the anaerobic degradation of these proteinaceous materials were the accumulation of ammonia and hydrogen sulfide. Changes in time {{in the composition of}} the microbiological community were determined by next-generation sequencing-based metagenomic analyses. Characteristic rearrangements of the biogas-producing community upon protein feeding and specific differences due to the individual protein substrates were recognized. The results clearly demonstrate that sustained biogas production is readily achievable, provided the system is well-characterized, understood and controlled. Biogas yields (0. 45 L CH 4 /g oDM) significantly exceeding those of the commonly used agricultural substrates (0. 25 - 0. 28 L CH 4 /g oDM) were routinely obtained.

Analysis performed by isoelectric focusing showed heterogeneity within the same breed and between the breeds. Some samples featured a reduced beta-lactoglobulin content and one sample from Larbaa breed showed the lack of bands in the most acidic region, where kappa-casein focuses. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of this sample allowed identifying the alpha-, alpha- and beta-casein fractions only. Highs 1 s 2 performance liquid chromatography analysis of <b>precipitated</b> <b>casein</b> showed three main peaks.

30|$|In {{addition}} to the leucine content, {{it has been suggested}} that the rapidity of protein digestion, and thus the peak plasma concentration of leucine may be an important factor for achieving maximal MPS (Phillips 2014). Thus, the protein absorption kinetics may also be important factor. Slowly absorbed proteins, such as <b>casein</b> that <b>precipitates</b> with acid, elicits a low but sustained increase in MPS and a decrease in protein breakdown, while fast absorbed protein, such as whey protein that remains soluble in the stomach, causes high and short increases in MPS (Boirie et al. 1997). As such, whey protein is considered to be superior (Reitelseder et al. 2011) to casein in supporting MPS during the immediate 4  h following ingestion (Burd et al. 2012; Tang et al. 2009). This may relate to the higher plasma concentrations of EAA and leucine during the immediate ~ 60  min following ingestion of whey compared to casein (Burd et al. 2012; Reitelseder et al. 2011). It is important to note, that when whey protein is ingested in small doses (“pulse feeding”), to mimic the absorption kinetics of casein protein, the effect on MPS is also reduced (West et al. 2011). This may indicate that the superiority of whey protein is not solely related to the greater leucine content in whey compared to casein (Phillips 2014) and that the faster absorption kinetics of whey protein are important for MPS as well. The absorption rate of both whey and casein protein can be increased by protein hydrolysis (measured as degree of protein hydrolysis, i.e., % cleaved peptide bonds) (Morifuji et al. 2010; Power et al. 2009), which may potentially influence MPS.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT In {{previous}} studies of the folate content of human milk, samples were prepared for assay by a method {{that resulted in a}} turbid solution that was then assayed by a turbidimetric microbiological method. We have used an improved microbiological assay in which the milks were treated with rennin to <b>precipitate</b> <b>casein</b> and heated in a buffered ascorbate to coagulate lactalbumin and lactoglobulin. Milks were obtained serially from nursing mothers for periods ranging from 1 day to 6 months postpartum. The results showed that the folate in human milk has few glutamate residues since treatment with a purified folate conjugase preparation released no additional folate activity for Lactobacillus casei. Colostrum is relatively low in folate, but milk folate increases as lactation proceeds. During each stage of lactation there was great variation in milk folate content among the women. In the case of a folate-deficient woman, supplementation with folic acid resulted in a prompt increase in milk folate level. Am J Clin Nuir 1982 : 36 : 576 - 580.

40|$|Caseins, {{the main}} {{proteins}} of milk, {{are known to}} be responsible of flux limitations in tangential filtration of skim milk. These proteins are well known to be versatile with the pH. Their initial form, corresponding to the so-called “native casein micelles” is due to a complex aggregation of monomers through calcium phosphate bridges that can be disrupted by small pH variations. This paper deals with the determination of both critical and limiting fluxes during ultrafiltration of natural and modified skim milks. pH ranging from 3. 7 to 11. 5 allowed to consider skim milk ultrafiltration (UF) for production purpose (pH 6. 6 – 6. 7) as well as acidic and alkaline concentrated effluents. The physico-chemical characteristics of caseins, as diameter and zeta potential, were measured according to the pH variations obtained by the addition of HCl and NaOH. Then, both limiting and critical fluxes variations were correlated to these characteristics. The critical and limiting fluxes varied in a quite complicated way with the pH, leading to four different regions. At acidic pH, zeta potential was null and fluxes were controlled by large particles of <b>caseins</b> that <b>precipitated</b> in the solution. Around neutral pH, the diameter of casein micelles remained constant whereas the zeta potential varied strongly. In this region the fluxes increased linearly with the zeta potential of caseins. Then at alkaline pH, the zeta potential of caseins remained constant whereas the diameter varied showing successively partial destructuration and partial “restructuration” of new types of micelles, both different from native casein micelles. In this region the fluxes varied with the rate of large micelles. Finally, retention of lactose (main neutral solute of milk) and whole proteins, mainly responsible of COD, were measured and discussed in relationship with above-mentioned parameters...|$|R
6000|$|Section 23. After mastication, {{the food}} is worked by the tongue and cheeks into a saliva-soaked [...] "bolus" [...] and swallowed. The passage down the {{oesophagus}} is called deglutition. In the stomach it comes {{under the influence of}} the gastric juice, formed in little glandular pits in the stomach wall-- the gastric (Figure VIII. Sheet 3) and pyloric glands. This fluid is distinctly acid, its acidity being due to about one-tenth per cent {of a hundred} of hydrochloric acid, and it therefore stops any further action of the ptyalin, which can act only on neutral or slightly alkaline fluids. The gastric juice does not act on carbo-hydrates or hydrocarbons to any very noticeable degree. Its essential property is the conversion of proteids into peptones, and the ferment by which this is effected is called pepsin. Milk contains a peculiar soluble proteid, called <b>casein,</b> which is <b>precipitated</b> by a special ferment, the rennet-ferment, and the insoluble proteid, the curd, thus obtained is then acted on by the pepsin. In the manufacture of cheese, the rennetferment obtained, from the stomach of a calf is used to curdle the milk.|$|R

40|$|European agri-environmental {{policies}} are promoting {{the establishment of}} shrubs and trees on grasslands. The use of browse as fodder requires knowledge on their nutritive value since intensive production systems are still relying on expensive and environment-costing protein sources. However, information {{on the influence of}} temperate condensed tannins (CT) -containing browse forage on rumen protein metabolism is elusive. The study aimed to assess the protein precipitation capacity (PPC) of 10 temperate browse species and establish the correlation between PPC values and plants CT content. PPC of foliage of 3 individuals per woody plants was measured using 2 model proteins: bovine serum albumin (BSA) and casein. The N content in protein solutions (4. 6 g/L; pH= 6. 8) was determined before and after adding each forage sample. Extractable CT concentration was quantified by spectrophotometry. The PPC varied across plant species (P< 0. 001). Corylus avellana had the highest ability to <b>precipitate</b> <b>casein</b> (52. 4 %). In contrast, the BSA precipitation (18. 3 %) of this plant was similar to Cornus sanguinea (12. 7 %), Quercus robur (12. 1 %) and Crataegus monogyna (11. 0 %). CT content ranged from 1. 4 in Fraxinus excelsior to 82. 7 g/kg of depigmented sample in Corylus avellana (P< 0. 001) and was correlated to BSA (r= 0. 70; P< 0. 001) and casein PC (r= 0. 51; P< 0. 01).
