In April 2002, GPS receivers were dynamically tested on a 0. 8 km length of railroad track using a small rail cart. The track was surveyed with an RTK GPS receiver and referenced to a NGS benchmark. The GPS receivers were evaluated over a 24 -hr period. The tests were conducted in both directions and at 2 different speeds. <b>Cross-track</b> and pass-to-pass <b>errors</b> were determined for a John Deere StarFire receiver with a dual frequency correction and a Trimble AgGPS 132 in the autonomous mode. <b>Cross-track</b> <b>errors</b> were sequentially correlated creating problems for using typical statistical analysis methods.

The distributed situation awareness of a system is inherently dependent {{on the level of}} interaction between system elements. Previous studies have found that the distributed situational relevance of team communication is highly correlated with team performance. This study investigated the impact of the combination of both relevance and situational correctness of communication during simulated high-speed craft navigation. A natural experiment with navigation in the inner Oslo Fjord was performed with a three-person team in a maritime desktop simulator. Participants were required to communicate verbally to ensure safe and efficient navigation. All statements communicated by the participants during the experiment was rated for relevance (relevant/irrelevant) and for situational correctness (correct or incorrect) and these scores was combined to form a Communication score ranging from + 1 (good) to - 1 (bad). Measures of the relevancy, correctness and the combined communication score were then correlated with the navigational team performance (measured as <b>cross-track</b> <b>error).</b> Findings indicate surprisingly that the relevance of communication (irrespective of its correctness) did not have any relationship to navigational performance (r ≈ 0) while the ratio of wrong communication showed a small to moderate positive correlation (r =. 237) to <b>cross-track</b> <b>error.</b> Most interestingly the combined communication score had a moderately large negative correlation with <b>cross-track</b> <b>error</b> (r = -. 349) thus indicating that at least for dynamic navigation tasks {{it is not enough to}} only look on the relevance of communication – but that also the situational correctness of information must be measured...|$|R

40|$|This report {{presents}} two optimization problems, {{where three}} cost-functions are suggested for each. The {{goal for the}} first optimization problem {{is to find a}} time variant look-ahead distance which improves the performance of the vessel in terms of the <b>cross-track</b> <b>error,</b> relative to constant look-ahead distances. The second optimization problem is an extension of the first, where a time variant surge velocity reference is also calculated. This results in smaller <b>cross-track</b> <b>errors,</b> at the cost of increased calculation time. It is assumed that the path and the desired surge velocity on the path is supplied by some external source. Existing kappa-exponential control laws are used to track the references resulting from the calculated optimal look-ahead distance and surge velocity reference. The predictions needed to solve the optimization problem are made from a model where the control laws are inserted into the dynamics to simplify the model. The optimization problems are solved for two different approaches. The first approach uses an LTV model for predictions and a QP-solver to solve the optimization problem. The second approach forms predictions of the states by numerical integration of the system dynamics and uses an optimization problem solver for general non-linear functions to solve the optimization problem. The latter approach generally results in longer calculation times but better accuracy, while the first approach yields convexity of the optimization problem. A passive observer is used to estimate the current such that it can be included in the predictions. Four of the six suggested cost-functions lead to significantly improved performance of the vessel in terms of the <b>cross-track</b> <b>error.</b> This is true both in the case of no disturbances and {{in the presence of a}} constant irrotational current. That is, the position of the vessel converges faster to the path, the vessel stays closer to the path and has less over-shoot in the <b>cross-track</b> <b>error,</b> for the optimal inputs than for constant inputs. The cost-functions includes weights for tuning where the tuning process is easy for some of the cost-functions. One of the cost-functions where only the optimal look-ahead distance is calculated, results in calculation times shorter than the time between samples, after a few time steps. This is a promising result since the application of MPC to fast-dynamic systems such as marine vessels is desired, but often problematic due to too long calculation times for solving the optimization problem. It takes more time to solve the optimization problem when the optimal surge velocity reference is found in addition to the optimal look-ahead distance. </p...|$|R

There is an increasing number of commercial opportunities for UAVs in business, agriculture, industry and mining, the emergency services and security services. The major barrier to commercialisation of UAVs is the certification process, where automated take-off and landing is a key feature required. The automated landing system presented in this paper uses a longitudinal control system based on the total energy control system (TECS), and a lateral control system that combines a heading and guidance controller with a <b>cross-track</b> <b>error</b> controller. A software state machine is used to advance the flight control system through the different stages of the automated landing.

40|$|This thesis will {{compare the}} {{performance}} of the Challenge 1 unmanned surface vehicle when autonomously conducting a radiological survey of a bounded, obstacle free, convex polygon via a traditional raster scan versus a novel spiral-like path plan. Currently, unmanned ground vehicles (UGV), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), and unmanned surface vehicles (USV) use a simple raster scan to insure complete coverage of a predefined, obstacle free area. Raster scans require a 180 degree change in heading which is easy for tracked UGVs and vertical take-o_ UAVs to accomplish, but more difficult for marine vehicles and fixed winged UAVs. A spiral-like path plan will not completely eliminate turns close to 180 degrees, but presents the possibility of removing the number of sharp turns at the expense of adding more slight turns. The author of this thesis originally hypothesized that this spiral-like path plan would result in shorter autonomous surveys by the Challenge 1 USV, as well as a higher percentage of coverage. Shorter surveys will allow operators such as the mission specialist overseeing a disaster in which radiological material may be present or treaty verification inspectors searching a facility to conduct more surveys in a limited time, which therefore increases the total area searched over this time period as well as provides data to the mission specialist faster. A higher percentage of coverage attained by the spiral-like path plan would guarantee a more complete representation of the area surveyed. To test this hypothesis the author used the 1. 15 acre pond at John Crompton Park in College Station, Texas, to generate twenty-five unique convex polygons via teleoperation of the Challenge 1, ranging in size from 450 square meters to 1027 square meters, to which a raster path plan and spiral-like path plan were each used by the Challenge 1 to survey the area, resulting in fifty total runs. Following the data collection, the associated log from each run was used to calculate total survey time, total survey distance, root mean square of <b>cross-track</b> <b>error,</b> Hausdorff Distance (max RMS error), percent coverage, and percent of survey locations inside the bounded convex polygon. The average survey time for a spiral like path plan versus a raster scan was 13. 68 seconds shorter (p < : 59). The average total distance for a raster path versus a spiral like path was 15. 53 meters less (p < : 061). The average RMS of <b>cross-track</b> <b>error</b> for a spiral like path plan versus a spiral path plan was 0. 31 meters less (p < : 123). The average Hausdorff Distance for a spiral like path plan versus a raster scan was 1. 53 meters less (p < 0 : 0005). The average of percent coverage for a raster scan versus a spiral like path was 4 : 22 % higher (p < 0 : 027). The average of percentage of locations in the bounding area for a raster path versus a spiral like path was 16 : 88 % higher (p < 0 : 00023). This shows that for ? = : 05, there is no statistical difference between either of the two path plans for survey time, survey distance, or RMS of <b>cross-track</b> <b>error.</b> However, there is a statistical difference between the two path plans for Hausdorff Distance, percent coverage and percentage of locations inside the bounding area. Due to the spiral path plan's inability to maintain locations inside the bounding area, a raster scan is the best path plan to use when surveying a bounded convex polygon with the Challenge 1 since it results in the highest percentage of coverage with no statistical difference in survey time, survey distance, or RMS of <b>cross-track</b> <b>error.</b> This result is only guaranteed for the Challenge 1 and its associated controller, with potentially different outcomes if tested on other surfaces vehicles, especially those with underwater propellers, rudders, or jet pump (no propeller or rudder) propulsion systems...|$|R

The track spread/skill relationship for several global ensemble prediction system forecasts is examined {{as a condition for}} a description of a full probability distribution function. The 2007, 2008, and 2009 NHC official track forecasts are compared to the ensemble prediction system model along-, cross-, and forecast-track errors. Significant differences in statistical properties were then identified among the groups to determine whether conditioning based on geographic location was warranted. Examination of each regional distribution interval suggests that differences in distributions existed for along-track and <b>cross-track</b> <b>errors.</b> Because errors for ensemble mean and deterministic forecasts typically have larger mean errors and larger variance than official forecast errors, it is unlikely that independent error distributions based on these models would refine the PDFs used in the probabilistic model. However, this should be tested with a sensitivity analysis and verified with the probability swath. Overall, conditional formatting suggests that the NHC probability product may be improved if the Monte Carlo (MC) model would draw from refined distributions of track errors based on TC location.

Comparison with simulated data shows that the method has good accuracy. The method is also tested with vehicle tracking in a city and people tracking within a building. For the indoor case, static and dynamic measurements allowed the degrading effect of body-worn devices due to signal blockage to be determined. Error modeling is also performed and a Rayleigh-Gamma model is proposed to describe the radial positional errors. It is shown that this model has a good match with both indoor and outdoor field measurements.

40|$|The {{development}} of an area navigation program and the implementation of this software on a microcomputer-based Loran-C receiver to provide high-quality, practical area navigation information for general aviation are described. This software provides range and bearing angle to a selected waypoint, <b>cross-track</b> <b>error,</b> course deviation indication (CDI), ground speed, and {{estimated time of arrival}} at the waypoint. The range/bearing calculation, using an elliptical Earth model, provides very good accuracy; the error does not exceed more than -. 012 nm (range) or 0. 09 degree (bearing) for a maximum range to 530 nm. The alpha-beta filtering is applied {{in order to reduce the}} random noise on Loran-C raw data and in the ground speed calculation. Due to alpha-beta filtering, the ground speed calculation has good stability for constant or low-accelerative flight. The execution time of this software is approximately 0. 2 second. Flight testing was done with a prototype Loran-C front-end receiver, with the Loran-C area navigation software demonstrating the ability to provide navigation for the pilot to any point in the Loran-C coverage area in true area navigation fashion without line-of-sight and range restriction typical of VOR area navigation...|$|R
40|$|The U. S. Navy {{currently}} has no means to conduct sea mine reconnaissance with assets that are organic to Aircraft Carrier Battle Groups or Amphibious Ready Groups. Magic Lanten is an Airborne Laser Mine Detection System (ALMDS) under development, {{that is designed}} to search for floating and shallow moored mines using a helicopter- mounted laser-optic sensor. It is the only ALMDS operationally tested by the Navy to date. This thesis develops a Monte Carlo simulation model called ML-Recon, which is intended for use as a tool to plan mine reconnaissance searches using the Magic Lantern system. By entering fundamental initial planning information, the user can determine the number of uniformly-spaced tracks to fly with a Magic Lantern-equipped helicopter to achieve a certain level of assurance that the area contains no floating or shallow moored mines. By employing Monte Carlo methods, ML-Recon models the three primary stochastic processes that take place during a typical search: the location of the mines, the <b>cross-track</b> <b>error</b> of the helicopter, and the detection/non-detection process of the sensor. By running ML-Recon, the user is given performance statistics for many replications of the search plan that he chooses. This approach is unique in that it provides the user with information indicating how much worse than the mean performance his plan may perform. ML- Recon also gives the user an Opportunity to view an animation of his lan, which he can use to look for tendencies in the lan to contain holes, or holidays. (AN) NAN...|$|R
40|$|The {{nation of}} Singapore is seeking {{new ways to}} adapt to its rapid growth. With the help of {{researchers}} and staff at the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (SMART), numerous {{data collection and analysis}} efforts are underway. One such effort involves the harbor where operations and oceanographic data collection missions are being completed using various sensors and autonomous systems. Utilizing Autonomous Surface Crafts (ASCs) to collect data is one such method and provides a level of robustness unachievable by humans. To improve these operations we seek {{to address the issue of}} efficiency in an environment containing surface waves, strong winds, and multiple current shears. In this thesis we present two new heading control algorithms for ASCs under the influence of currents. The first, <b>Cross-Track</b> <b>Error</b> Minimization, ensures that the vehicle follows a straight-line trajectory between two waypoints under the effects of surface waves and currents. The second controller, Time-Optimal, uses Zermelo's problem and function minimization to find the time-optimal trajectory between two waypoints using a known current field. We further define near-time-optimal paths covering a set of waypoints by defining an asymmetric Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) where the graph nodes are the waypoints and the edges are the corresponding travel times between the waypoints. Tour construction and local search heuristics are then utilized to build near time-optimal paths. These new paths show a potential time savings of 89 % leading to overall mission efficiency. by Lynn M. Sarcione. Thesis (S. M.)
