40|$|The strong {{incentive}} {{to reduce costs}} under price cap regulation may create incentives for a regulated firm to reduce delivered service quality levels. Corrective measures, such as service quality standards or a service quality adjustment factor in the price cap formula may mitigate against this tendency.

40|$|Price cap {{regulation}} is often combined with service quality regulation since price caps may create incentives for quality degradation. A service quality adjustment factor (the Q-Factor) {{in the price}} cap formula ensures that allowed prices fall as quality declines.
