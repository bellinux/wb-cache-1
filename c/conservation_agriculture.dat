The World Health Organization recommends {{the use of}} rotation to minimise problems with pests and plant diseases. Cultivation may be traditional or may make use of <b>conservation</b> <b>agriculture</b> practices to maintain organic matter in the soil and to conserve water, for example with no-till farming systems. In many medicinal and aromatic plants, plant characteristics vary widely with soil type and cropping strategy, so care is required to obtain satisfactory yields.|$|E
