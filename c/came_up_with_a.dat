5|$|In early 1943, Ingersoll Rand pulled out. Keith {{approached}} the Clark Compressor Company and Worthington Pump and Machinery but they turned it down, {{saying that it}} could not be done. So Keith and Groves saw executives at Allis-Chalmers, who agreed to build a new factory to produce the pumps, even though the pump design was still uncertain. The SAM Laboratories <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> design, and Westinghouse built some prototypes that were successfully tested. Then Judson Swearingen at the Elliott Company <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> revolutionary and promising design that was mechanically stable with seals that would contain the gas. This design was manufactured by Allis-Chalmers.|$|E

5|$|In the Royal Navy, dazzle paint schemes reappeared in January 1940. These were unofficial, and {{competitions}} {{were often}} held between ships {{for the best}} camouflage patterns. The Royal Navy's Camouflage Department <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> scheme devised by a young naval officer, Peter Scott, a wildlife artist, which were developed into the Western Approaches Schemes. In 1942 the Admiralty Intermediate Disruptive Pattern came into use, followed in 1944 by the Admiralty Standard Schemes.|$|E
5|$|Producers Graham Broadbent and Peter Czernin {{first saw}} the {{potential}} for a film in Deborah Moggach's novel with the idea of exploring the lives of the elderly beyond what one would expect of their age group.

5|$|Special prizes may {{be awarded}} for {{solutions}} of outstanding elegance or involving good generalisations of a problem. This last happened in 1995 (Nikolay Nikolov, Bulgaria) and 2005 (Iurie Boreico), but was more frequent {{up to the}} early 1980s. The special prize in 2005 was awarded to Iurie Boreico, a student from Moldova, who <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> brilliant solution to question 3, which was an inequality involving three variables.|$|E

5|$|For Vorticons, Carmack {{had created}} {{adaptive}} tile refresh {{to produce a}} scrolling effect on computers not powerful enough to redraw the entire screen when the player moved. For Galaxy and Aliens, he wanted to scroll the background at a different rate than the foreground, but again computers of the time were not powerful enough to do so smoothly. To implement parallax scrolling without having to manage all of the elements moving past each other, he <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> plan to instead save combinations of overlapping foreground and background elements in memory and display the appropriate combination for where Keen was on the screen, so that the game only needed to pick the correct image rather than recalculate what that image would be. Hall, meanwhile, had received feedback from parents who did not like that the enemies in Vorticons left behind corpses instead of disappearing like in other games; {{he did not want}} the violence to have no effects, and so in Dreams replaced the raygun with pellets that temporarily stunned enemies. He was not satisfied with this change, and while considering ways to remove Keen's parents during the introduction for Galaxy, <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> stun gun which would leave behind permanently stunned enemies, which appeared in all three episodes made in 1991. Additionally, music, which was missing in prior Keen games, was added to Aliens, composed by Bobby Prince.|$|E

Wormlike tubes would course through the victim's body and mechanical devices break the skin. The entire transformation was created using computer-generated imagery. The wormlike geometry was animated over the actor's face, then blended in {{with the addition of}} a skin texture over the animation. The gradual change in skin tone was simulated with shaders.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} make money from Frog Fractions, Crawford first sold the game's soundtrack, with part of the {{proceeds}} going to the game's music team. He later decided to sell T-shirts containing jokes from the game in order to benefit its art team. While developing Frog Fractions, Crawford said that he <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> lot of other video game ideas, but he then realized that he could implement them immediately into Frog Fractions rather than start a new project, due to the game's unpredictable nature.|$|E

The contract was signed by Gingrich and other Republican candidates for the House of Representatives. The contract ranged from issues such as welfare reform, term limits, tougher crime laws, and a balanced budget law, to more specialized legislation such as restrictions on American military participation in United Nations missions.|$|E

5|$|It was the Stones' {{first public}} concert in over two years, and was planned as an {{introduction}} of new guitarist, Mick Taylor, though circumstances inevitably changed {{following the death of}} former member Brian Jones two days earlier.

Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) was incorporated in May 1995, construction started in 1998, and the first section, on the Red Line, opened in 2002. The development of network was divided into phases, Phase I containing 3 lines was completed by 2006, and Phase II in 2011. Phase III is scheduled for completion by 2018 (originally planned for 2016).|$|E

It's a trilogy in four parts, and it really follows the continuing adventures of new people who are experiencing this phenomenon of a Klown invasion, {{and once in a}} while you see some of the old guys pop up and hear their stories – find out what happened over the last 25 years.

5|$|The {{concept of}} a mass rapid transit for New Delhi first emerged from a traffic and travel {{characteristics}} study which {{was carried out in}} the city in 1969. Over the next several years, many official committees by a variety of government departments were commissioned to examine issues related to technology, route alignment, and governmental jurisdiction. In 1984,the Urban Arts Commission <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> proposal for developing a multi-modal transport system, which would consist of constructing three underground mass rapid transit corridors as well augmenting the city's existing suburban railway and road transport networks.|$|E
5|$|The main {{rivers of}} Rùm were {{essentially}} just trickling streams, so Cranbourne <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> plan {{to increase the}} power of the Kinloch River, by diverting the other two. In 1849, he built a dam at the end of Loch Sgathaig, allowing him to diverting the overflow into the Kilmory River (northwards), rather than the Abhainn Rhangail (southwards). In 1852, he attempted to dam the Kilmory River, half a mile north of Loch Sgathaig, the plan being to send the overflow into the Kinloch River via a short canal; unfortunately Salisbury's Dam collapsed shortly after being built.|$|E
5|$|The {{opposition}} middle szlachta movement <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> constructive {{reform program}} during the Kraków sejm of 1538/1539. Among the movement's demands were {{termination of the}} kings' practice of alienation of royal domain, giving or selling land estates to great lords at the monarch' discretion, and a ban on concurrent holding of multiple state offices by the same person, both legislated initially in 1504. Sigismund I's unwillingness {{to move toward the}} implementation of the reformers' goals negatively affected the country's financial and defensive capabilities.|$|E
