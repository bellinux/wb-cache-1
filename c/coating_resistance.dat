50|$|One of {{the most}} common {{problems}} among vessel construction and maintenance is the corrosion that takes place in the double hull space ballast tanks have in merchant vessels. Bio-degradation takes place in ballast tank coatings in marine environments. Ballast tanks can carry more than ballast water, most of the time ballast tanks are filled with other bacteria or organisms. Some of these bacteria can that can be picked up {{from other parts of the}} world can cause the ballast tank to get damaged. Bacteria from different regions plus the natural bacteria can cause ballast tanks to break down. The natural bacteria community has an interaction of the natural bio-films with the coating, an aspect which is not covered in standard procedures. Researchers have shown that biological activity indeed significantly affects the coating properties. Micro-cracks and small holes have been found in ballast tanks. Acidic bacteria created holes with 0.2-0.9 μm in length and 4-9 μm in width. The natural community caused cracks of 2-8 μm in depth and 1 μm in length. The EIS technique was used to examine the degradation. The bacterial affected coatings decreased in corrosion resistance. The natural community, has a clear loss in <b>coating</b> <b>resistance</b> over time. Also, coating corrosion resistance declines after 40 days of exposure to the natural community, resulting in blisters in the ballast tank. Bacteria might be linked to certain bio-film patterns affecting various types of coating attacks.|$|E

Experimental results show that the fatigue performance of the specimen is not obviously changed after the coating sensor deposited on it. When plastic deformation occurs, the adjacent measuring date of the <b>coating</b> sensor <b>resistance</b> value is increased about 6 %.

[...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical EngineeringIn this {{research}} project, a nanocomposite coating was developed using multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) associated with epoxy primer {{in order to}} increase <b>coating</b> <b>resistance</b> against ultra-violet radiation and corrosion. The effectiveness of this nanocomposite coating was evaluated by exposing it to ultra-violet light for different time period. To determine hydrophilic/hydrophobic characteristics of the different UV exposed coated surface, the water contact angle was measured on the surfaces. The UV degraded samples were also exposed to the salt fog corrosion chamber for 80 days. The coating performance tests were carried out using digital images, optical microscope, atomic force microscope (AFM) and thickness measurement. It was found that the addition of multiwall carbon nanotubes into the coating materials drastically increased the <b>coating</b> <b>resistance</b> against ultra-violet radiation and corrosion. Overall, this coating can be an option {{to solve the problem of}} the UV degradation and corrosion of metals and composites...|$|E

40|$|This work {{investigated}} {{the protection of}} mechanism of organic coatings on steel exposed to 3 % sodium chloride solution at 50 °C, coupled {{with the use of}} electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to monitor progress of corrosion and degradation of coating. Unlike Walter, EIS measurement was conducted at 50 °C as well as after cooling, and measurements at intermediate temperatures have been used to characterize the dependence of the process involved. The proposition that corrosion rate is controlled by the ionic resistance of an organic coating has been tested. EIS results were fitted to a model circuit and changes in the film resistance and charge-transfer resistance with temperature were analyzed to deduce activation energies for the processes involved. Surprisingly, the calculated activation energy for <b>coating</b> <b>resistance</b> is significantly lower than the activation energy for the charge transfer resistance. This suggests that ion conduction in the coating, as apparent in an AC measurement, cannot be controlling the corrosion rate. Potentiostatic pulse tests on coated metal enable iR-corrected polarization curves to be plotted at different temperatures. From this, the activation energy determined from the corrosion currents also higher matches the higher activation energy value calculated from the charge transfer resistance. However, measurements of <b>coating</b> <b>resistance</b> on free films of the same coating also generate higher activation energy values, leaving two possible models that can account for the results.

40|$|This {{research}} {{concentrates on}} the thermal ageing of a full 3 -coat system with sacrificial pigment (zinc rich) primer on mild steel where the temperature dependence test is conducted to explore {{the correlation between the}} coating resistances with the corrosion rate underneath the coating. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is introduced over a range of temperature to extract activation energies for the rate of controlling processes in the corrosion reactions. It is expected that the zinc rich primer does not form a barrier coating for the metal substrate rather it will be the most active component of the substrate in the electrochemistry. Full 3 -coat system with zinc rich primer show the extracted activation energy from <b>coating</b> <b>resistance</b> is significantly lower than the activation energy extracted from the charge transfer resistance. This suggested that the <b>coating</b> <b>resistance</b> from EIS cannot be controlling the corrosion reaction. The activation energies generated for the corrosion process here (78 – 97 kJmol- 1) are very much higher than those of ion transport through the coating (19 – 37 kJmol- 1) during early immersion. Further interesting findings come from the activation energy trends over time particularly for the corrosion process which shown that the value is decreasing where at the end of exposure, the activation energy values for coating and charge transfer resistance become quite similar. It is suggested that at this stage ion transport in the coating might be controlling the corrosion process unlike at the beginning; the activation energy is getting smaller due to coating degradation...|$|E
