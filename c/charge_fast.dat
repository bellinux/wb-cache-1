A {{consequence of this}} absorption is to induce a heterogeneous conductivity within the film. We present space charge and surface potential measurements which provide evidence for a progressive motion of the charge distribution towards the back electrode, in good accordance with a simple model, assuming stability of the deposited <b>charge,</b> <b>fast</b> retrapping of the photoinduced carriers, {{as well as a}} conductivity proportional to light absorption.

30|$|Currently, two PEV {{charging}} modes {{are widely}} adopted: normal charging mode {{at home or}} parking lots with lower charging power level, and <b>fast</b> <b>charging</b> mode at <b>fast</b> <b>charging</b> stations with higher charging power level, the typical charging duration is 20 – 30  min [18]. Besides the charging power level, the characteristics of such two charging modes are also intrinsically different. When a PEV is driving to the destination but the SoC is too low to complete the rest trip, it should find a <b>fast</b> <b>charging</b> station to get <b>charged</b> with the <b>fast</b> <b>charging</b> mode as soon as possible. However, the normal charging often happens when a PEV arrives at home or workplaces and it doesn’t hurry to get fully charged [19, 20].|$|R

40|$|To {{quantify}} the aggregate losses from operational risk, we employ actuarial risk model, i. e. we consider compound Cox model of operational risk {{to deal with}} stochastic nature of its frequency rate in reality. A shot noise process is used for this purpose. A compound Poisson model is also considered as its counterpart for the case that operational loss frequency rate is deterministic. As the loss amounts arising due to mismanagement of operational risks are extremes in practice, we assume the loss sizes are Loggamma, Fréchet and truncated Gumbel. We also use an exponential distribution for the case of non-extreme losses. Employing loss distribution approach, we derive the analytical/explicit forms of the Laplace transform {{of the distribution of}} aggregate operational losses. The Value at Risk (VaR) and tail conditional expectation (TCE, also known as TailVaR) are used to evaluate the operational risk capital <b>charge.</b> <b>Fast</b> Fourier transform is used to approximate VaR and TCE numerically and the fig-ures of the distributions of aggregate operational losses are provided.

40|$|Solid dielectrics {{have been}} used {{extensively}} in electrical and electronic industries. In the power industry, ultra high voltage transmission and cost saving of power equipment often result in that the dielectrics are operating under high electric fields. On the other hand, reduction in size for modern electronic systems also requires that the dielectrics operate reliably under high electric fields. It is therefore imperative to understand the response of dielectric materials to the high electric fields. In addition to high conduction current, power loss and potential breakdown, {{it has been observed}} over the years there are several anomalous phenomena occurred under high electric fields. These are surface potential cross-over phenomenon in corona charged dielectrics, discharging current flowing {{in the same direction as}} charging current, space <b>charge</b> <b>fast</b> decaying and transient space charge limited current. In the present paper all these phenomena have been experimentally demonstrated but most importantly a bipolar charge injection model has been used to understand the observed phenomena under high dc fields. Preliminary simulations based the model reveal that the presence of bipolar charges is the key to explain these anomalous phenomena...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} role of Internet censorship and circumvention in the Arab world as well as Arabs’ views on the limits to free speech on the Internet. The project involves {{the creation of an}} Internet censorship circumvention tool named Alkasir that allows users to report and access certain types of censored websites. The study covers the Arab world at large with special focus on Egypt, Syria, Tunisia, and Yemen. This work is of interdisciplinary nature and draws on the disciplines of media and communication studies and computer science. It uses a pioneering experimental approach by placing Alkasir in the hands of willing users who automatically feed a server with data about usage patterns without storing any of their personal information. In addition to the analysis of Alkasir usage data, Web surveys were used to learn about any technical and nontechnical Internet censorship practices that Arab users and content producers may have been exposed to. The study also aims at learning about users’ experiences with circumvention tools and how such tools could be improved. The study found that users have successfully reported and accessed hundreds of censored social networking, news, dissident, multimedia and other websites. The survey results show that while most Arab informants disapprove censoring online anti-government political content, the majority support the censoring of other types of content such as pornography, hate speech, and anti-religion material. Most informants indicated that circumvention tools should be free of <b>charge,</b> <b>fast</b> and reliable. An increase in awareness among survey respondents of the need for privacy and anonymity features in circumvention solutions was observed...|$|E
30|$|Therefore, it {{is obvious}} that the PEV <b>fast</b> <b>charging</b> demand is unpostponable and uninterruptible, but the PEVs with <b>fast</b> <b>charging</b> demand can be {{scheduled}} to get charged in an optimal <b>fast</b> <b>charging</b> station. The <b>fast</b> <b>charging</b> demand of PEVs can be considered spatially schedulable but temporally unschedulable. On the contrary, the normal charging demand is interruptible, which can be shifted over time, but the charging place is totally fixed. The normal charging time can be scheduled to consume the DGs optimally with minimal cost, which means the normal charging demand can be considered temporally schedulable but spatially unschedulable.|$|R

30|$|Carbon {{nanomaterials}} {{have a large}} {{surface area}} and complex particle’s shape architecture. These qualities are successfully applying to develop new drug carriers, fillers, or nanodetectors [1]. At the same time, the utilization efficiency of such materials is caused by maintaining of the nanodispersity. An agglomeration and partially sedimentation of nanotubes in aqueous media is a well-known fact. The stability of the nanotube dispersion mostly depends on the uniformity of the boundary layer and nanotube morphology. The hydrophobic nature of defectless areas of their surface and the hydrophilicity of some types of defects in the nanotube boundary layer, namely carboxy- or phenolic groups [2, 3] which are formed during nanotube purification and washing, are competing during dispersing in the aqueous media. An increase in stability of the nanotube dispersion in water can be achieved through the surface charge via formation of the double electrical layer (EDL). Among other carbon materials, carbon nanotubes are characterized by the ability to accumulate <b>charge,</b> <b>fast</b> cycle of charge/discharge, and these properties are important {{for the development of}} devices operating on the principle of EDL. The rapid development of technology of preparation of ionistors based on application of nanotubes determines the relevance of studies of EDL formation on nanotubes with different functionality in the electrolyte medium. In addition, the behaviour of nanotube particles in electrokinetic experiments may provide information on the surface properties and the interactions among particles suspended in a liquid. The EDL formation phenomenon depends on the fact that a potential difference is developed when two phases are in contact. There are several ways to generate this effect in aqueous systems. The water dipoles may be oriented at the interface, thus creating a potential difference. Ions or excess electrons in one or both phases give rise to a nonuniform distribution of electric charges at the interface between the phases. Furthermore, {{in the development of a}} surface charge that exists on the solid surface, whether by ion adsorption from the liquid phase on the particle or ionization of groups, the surface acquires a potential with respect to the solution [4].|$|E

Besides, to maximize social benefits, effective scheduling strategies guiding <b>fast</b> <b>charging</b> behaviors should be formulated rather than simply increasing infrastructure construction investments on the power grid.

Then, a multi-objective optimization model of the <b>fast</b> <b>charging</b> service fee is constructed, whose service fee can be further optimized by employing a fuzzy programming method.
