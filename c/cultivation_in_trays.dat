40|$|Urban {{horticulture}} {{is gaining}} {{more and more}} attention {{in the context of}} sustainable food supply. Yet, cities are exposed to (former) industrial activities and traffic, responsible for emission of contaminants. Trace elements were monitored in soils located in the urban environment of Ghent (Belgium) and 84 samples of Lactuca satica L. lettuce grown on it. The effects of cultivation in soil versus trays, neighbouring traffic and washing of the lettuce before consumption were studied. The 0 – 30 cm top layer of soils appeared heterogenic in composition and enriched in Co, Cd, Ni and Pb within 10 m from the nearest road. Yet, no similar elevated concentrations could be found in the crops, except for As. Besides uptake from the roots, the presence of trace elements in the plants is also caused by the atmospheric deposition of airborne particulate matter on the leaf surface. Correlation analysis and principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that this latter transport pathway might particularly be the case for Pt, Pd and Rh. Concentrations of Cd did not exceed the 0. 2 mg/kg (fresh weight) threshold for Cd in leafy vegetables set by the European Commission. Measurements to reduce the health risks include the washing of lettuce, which effectively reduced the number of samples trespassing the maximum Pb level of 0. 3 mg/kg (fresh weight). Also, <b>cultivation</b> <b>in</b> <b>trays</b> resulted in a lower As content in the plants. Taking into account a vigilance on crop selection, cultivation substrate and proper washing before consumption are considered essential steps for safe domestic horticulture in urban environments...|$|E
40|$|The overall {{production}} of oak mushrooms has steadily increased in Korea, but the mushroom market is plagued {{with a wave}} of falling prices and intensified competition as imports of Chinese oak mushrooms increase. Imported Chinese oak mushrooms are mostly grown on sawdust blocks, which are costly in Korea because of higher labor costs and log prices. Mushroom farmers, therefore, strive to seek ways to compete with Chinese oak mushrooms, and the use of broad-leaved tree species is under consideration to promote sawdust-based mushroom cultivation. Korean oak mushrooms are expected to be more competitive when they are grown on sawdust rather than log while imports of Chinese mushrooms are still limited due to difficulties sustaining freshness. However, there are some obstacles such as the acquisition of superior strains of mushroom to promote sawdust cultivation of oak mushroom. Thus, The study investigated the status of production and sales of oak mushroom and the intent of mushroom farmers toward mushroom culture <b>in</b> wooden <b>trays</b> by conducting a questionnaire survey involving mushroom farmers in the two cities in Gyeonggi Province. Results of the study revealed that there were differences in production volume and revenue per oak log between mushroom farmers in the two areas. Many farmers showed distrustful reactions towards strains distributed because of frequent loss and damages caused by purchased strains. It is, therefore, necessary to encourage farmers to increase productivity by standardizing culture techniques and supplying good strains of mushrooms. More farmers in Hwasung City are interested <b>in</b> mushroom <b>cultivation</b> <b>in</b> wooden <b>trays,</b> but farmers <b>in</b> Yongin City were less enthusiastic about mushroom <b>cultivation</b> <b>in</b> wooden <b>trays</b> after witnessing failures of other farmers. The findings of the study signifies the need for introducing effects of mushroom culture <b>in</b> wooden <b>trays</b> among mushroom farmers, and developing superior strains of mushrooms to promote mushroom growth using wooden trays...|$|R

40|$|Today’s crane-mounted {{planting}} heads plant seedlings with biologically {{similar or}} better results than operational manual planting. However, {{the total cost}} of mechanized tree planting in southern Sweden must decrease at least 25 % to compete economically with manual planting. Although seedlings packed in machine-specific packaging increase the productivity of planting machines by reducing seedling reloading time, they also increase logistics and investment costs. In this study, we analyzed {{the total cost of}} outplanting seedlings with an excavator-mounted Bracke Planter and seedlings packed according to four different concepts: cultivation trays, cardboard boxes, band-mounted seedlings in cardboard boxes and linked pots in container modules. The total cost per planted seedling was calculated for each packaging system as the sum of all costs from nursery to the recovery of empty packaging. The results showed that today’s system of transporting seedlings <b>in</b> <b>cultivation</b> <b>trays</b> is the most cost-efficient of the four alternatives. Machine-specific seedling packaging was 16 – 23 % costlier per planted seedling than cultivation trays when trucking distances were 100 km. Sensitivity analyses indicated that machine-specific seedling packaging increased in cost-efficiency relative to cultivation trays primarily when more planting machines were contracted, but also as planting machine fixed costs and productivity increased. Moreover, the relative cost-efficiency of band-mounted seedlings, but not seedlings in container modules, increased with increasing trucking distance. Thus, we show that investments in machine-specific seedling packaging for today’s planting machines are justified only when the fixed costs, productivity and number of contracted planting machines increase substantially...|$|R

40|$|Abstract ? The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate the influence of crown diameter and growing period of runner tips in 128 cell-trays on growth and yield of strawberry in the field. Treatments consisted of three classes of runner tip crown diameters, between 2. 0 to 3. 9 mm; 4. 0 to 5. 5 mm and 5. 6 to 7. 0 mm, respectively, and four growing periods <b>in</b> <b>trays,</b> 24; 39; 54 and 69 days, respectively. Higher shoot dry mass of transplants at planting and earlier yield of plants in the field were obtained in transplants grown for 69 days <b>in</b> <b>trays.</b> Larger runner tips lead to more vigorous transplants at planting and plants with higher vegetative growth in the field, with minor impact on yield. Increasing the growing time of runner tips <b>in</b> <b>trays</b> improved early fruit yield and decreased plant vegetative growth in the field. 201...|$|R

40|$|Research on the {{application}} of innovative biodegradable materials for substrate mulching <b>in</b> greenhouse floricultural <b>cultivation</b> {{was carried out in}} Southern Italy. A transparent biodegradable film and a transparent biodegradable spray coating were compared with a commercial transparent low density polyethylene film. The biodegradable film was a starch based extruded material, the sprayed coating was created from a polysaccharide solution. The materials were used to mulch the peat and perlite growing media contained <b>in</b> <b>trays</b> during snapdragon <b>cultivation</b> <b>in</b> order to increase the substrate temperature and hasten early growth. The climate variables inside and outside the greenhouse and the growing medium temperature under the mulching materials were recorded. Biometrical data, such as mean blooming time, plant height and spike length, were collected. The laboratory radiometric tests showed that the biodegradable mulching materials had a lower solar transmissivity in comparison to the low density polyethylene film. The capacity to reduce the long wave infrared thermal losses was higher for the biodegradable mulches: the long wave infrared transmissivity coefficient was 53. 9...|$|R
