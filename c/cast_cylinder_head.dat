5000|$|The Mercedes-Benz 190E 2.3-16 with 16-valve engine debuted at the Frankfurt Auto Show in September 1983 {{after it}} set {{a world record}} at Nardo, Italy, {{recording}} a combined average speed of 154.06 mi/h km/h over the 50000 km endurance test. The engine {{was based on the}} 2.3-liter 8-valve 136 hp (101 kW) unit already fitted to the 190- and E-Class series. Cosworth developed the DOHC light alloy <b>cast</b> <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> with four large valves per cylinder. In roadgoing trim, the 190 E 2.3-16 produced 49 hp (36 kW) and 41 ft•lbf (55 N•m) of torque more than the basic single overhead cam 2.3 straight-4 engine on which it was based offering [...] at 6,200 rpm (59.2 kW/liter) and 174 lbft Nm at 4,500 rpm. In 1988 an enlarged 2.5-liter engine replaced the 2.3-liter. It offered double valve timing chains to fix the easily snapping single chains on early 2.3 engines, and increased peak output by 17 bhp (12.5 kW) with a slight increase in torque. For homologation Evolution I (1989) and Evolution II (1990) models were produced that had a redesigned engine to allow for a higher rev limit and improved top-end power capabilities. The Evo II engine offered [...] from 2463 cc (70.2 kW/liter).|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} grain {{refinement}} on the microstructure and mechanical properties of a secondary AlSi 7 Cu 3 Mg gravity die <b>cast</b> <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> is reported. Metallographic and image analysis techniques {{have been used}} to quantitatively examine the macro- and microstructural changes occurring with the addition of grain-refining agent. The results indicate that the AlTi 5 B 1 addition produces a fine and uniform grain structure throughout the casting and this effect is more pronounced in the slowly solidified regions. The initial contents of Ti and B, which are present as impurity elements in the supplied secondary alloy ingots, are not sufficient to produce an effective grain refinement. The combined addition of AlTi 5 B 1 and Sr doesn’t produce any reciprocal interaction under the present casting conditions. Grain refinement improves the mechanical properties of as-cast AlSi 7 Cu 3 Mg alloy and increases the reliability of the castings, as evidenced by the Weibull analysis...|$|E

25|$|The Jupiter {{was fairly}} {{standard}} in design, but featured four valves per cylinder, which was uncommon at the time. The cylinders were machined from steel forgings, and the <b>cast</b> <b>cylinder</b> <b>heads</b> were later replaced with aluminium alloy following {{studies by the}} RAE. In 1927, a change was made {{to move to a}} forged head design due to the rejection rate of the castings. The Jupiter VII introduced a mechanically driven supercharger to the design, and the Jupiter VIII was the first to be fitted with reduction gears.|$|R

40|$|In {{the diesel}} engine <b>cylinder</b> <b>head,</b> {{especially}} to resist to high combustion pressure, {{it has been}} demanded to develop high strength materials. The traditional <b>cast</b> iron <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> meets most of the requirements. However, cast iron has the disadvantage of being heavy and having a low thermal conductivity. To improve the fuel efficiency and the drivability of vehicles, light weighted <b>cylinder</b> <b>heads</b> made of aluminium alloys have been developed. In recent production, Al-Si-Cu-Mg cast alloys have been used so far because of their good performance of castability and mechanical strength with age hardening. This work analysed the microstructural properties of the mentioned cast aluminium alloys on two real complex-shaped castings like diesel <b>cylinder</b> <b>heads,</b> as <b>cast</b> and T 6 heat treated, experimentally produced by Teksid Aluminum. The secondary dendrite arm spacings (SDAS) and the size and morphology of eutectic silicon were considered with this study under quantitative aspects. It is well known how finer SDAS, obtained with high solidification conditions, result in more uniform microstructure and create the condition for more closely distributed and finer, smaller particles, like eutectic silicon and intermetallics. In this study the cast aluminium alloy (A 354) adopted to <b>cast</b> <b>cylinder</b> <b>heads</b> underwent a heat treatment (T 6) {{in order to obtain}} an optimum combination of strength and ductility. The mechanical properties of this alloy are generally dependent by the followings conditions: distribution and size of the precipitates, β-Mg 2 Si and θ-Al 2 Cu, structure and size of eutectic silicon particles. Therefore, it is evident how the mechanical properties of the casting are severely influenced by the combined effect of SDAS and eutectic silicon...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe fatigue {{strength}} of the casted aluminum alloy AlSi 7 Cu 0. 5 Mg T 6 W is investigated, whereat different eutectic modifiers, Sr and Na, are used for the two fatigue testing series. The tested specimens are extracted from three different locations of <b>casted</b> <b>cylinder</b> <b>heads.</b> The high-cycle fatigue testing is executed with cylindrical specimens at a load ratio of R = - 1. The investigations are supported by CT-scans of the specimens and a comprehensive fractographic analysis. The obtained micro pore sizes from CT-scans are compared with thus of the fractography. It is shown that the maximum micro pore sizes near the surface of both examinations are comparable. The database is statistically evaluated using extremal distribution based functions. To assess the {{fatigue strength}} of the imperfected specimen, the simplified crack propagation based approach according to Tiryakioglu is applied. The cumulative distribution function matches well to the experimental results. This methodology features the incorporation of extremal micro pore sizes into finite life fatigue strength...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Car {{manufacturers}} {{are very much}} concerned with thermal fatigue damage that may cause Diesel engine to fail after a few thousand cycles on the test bench and under severe operating conditions. The alternative heating and cooling of the operative Diesel engine generates fatigue cracks, initiating from the fire deck of the <b>cast</b> aluminum <b>cylinder</b> <b>head,</b> which can lead ultimately to engine failure. We present here the modelling of the fatigue damage in aluminum cylinder heads: we describe the constitutive equations {{and the results of}} fatigue crack growth rate measurements.

5000|$|Thus, {{for such}} a modern car, the engine of the {{original}} DS 19 was also old-fashioned. It {{was derived from the}} engine of the 11CV Traction Avant (models 11B and 11C). It was an OHV four-cylinder engine with three main bearings and wet liners, and a bore of 78 mm and a stroke of 100 mm, giving a volumetric displacement of 1911 cc. The <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> had been reworked; the 11C had a reverse-flow <b>cast</b> iron <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> and generated [...] at 3800 rpm; by contrast, the DS 19 had an aluminium cross-flow head with hemispherical combustion chambers and generated [...] at 4500 rpm.|$|R
5|$|The Straight Eight was {{the first}} car in series {{production}} in the United States with a straight-eight engine. The engine had a cast iron block, a detachable <b>cast</b> iron <b>cylinder</b> <b>head,</b> and an aluminum lower crankcase and oil pan. The crankshaft ran in three main bearings. While the prototype Straight Eight shown at the model's introduction had horizontal valves of the type used in earlier Duesenberg-designed marine and racing engines, the model that entered production had a shaft-driven single overhead camshaft which used rockers to operate two valves per cylinder in a hemispheric combustion chamber.|$|R
40|$|A {{complete}} thermomechanical fatigue (TMF) life prediction methodology {{is developed}} for predicting the TMF life of <b>cast</b> iron <b>cylinder</b> <b>heads</b> for efficient heavy duty internal combustion engines. The methodology uses transient temperature fields as thermal loads for the non-linear structural finite-element analysis (FEA). To obtain reliable {{stress and strain}} histories in the FEA for cast iron materials, a time and temperature dependent plasticity model which accounts for viscous effects, non-linear kinematic hardening and tensioncompression asymmetry is required. For this purpose a unified elasto-viscoplastic Chaboche model coupled with damage is developed and implemented as a user material model (USERMAT) in the general purpose FEA program ANSYS. In addition, the mechanismbased DTMF model for TMF life prediction developed in Part I of the paper is extended to three-dimensional stress states under transient non-proportional loading conditions. The material properties of the plasticity model are determined for lamellar graphite cast iron GJL 250 and vermicular graphite cast iron GJV 450 from isothermal and non-isothermal uniaxial tests. The methodology is applied to obtain a TMF life prediction on two <b>cast</b> iron <b>cylinder</b> <b>heads</b> for heavy duty diesel engine applications made from both cast iron materials. It is shown that the life predictions using the developed methodology correlate very well with observed lives from two bench tests in terms of location as well as number of cycles to failure...|$|R
