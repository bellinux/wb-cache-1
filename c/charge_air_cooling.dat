Charge air temperature directly and indirectly influences engine performance, fuel economy & emissions. To date charge air temperature control has, in the main, been passive; aiming only to reduce temperatures towards, but still above, ambient temperature. Driven by increasing specific output, the opportunities for sub-ambient charge cooling need to be investigated. For some real world driving conditions it is also desirable to raise the charge temperature. Air Cycle Technology ltd (ACT), working with the University of Huddersfield (UoH) are developing a controllable <b>charge</b> <b>air</b> <b>cooling</b> system, which will deliver charge air at sub-ambient temperature over a wide engine operating range.

This option has been investigated here to recover the heat available from {{three of the four}} engines of a real electrically driven Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) carrier, having an electric power output of 23, 375 kW. A detailed analysis of the engines operation was first performed to create a reliable set of thermodynamic parameters that fulfil the energy balance of the engines. Heat associated with the jacket water, lubricating oil and <b>charge</b> <b>air</b> <b>cooling</b> of the engines has been considered to be available for the ORC, while the heat from the exhaust gases is already exploited to generate low pressure steam for ship internal use. Simple, regenerative and two-stage ORC configurations have been compared using six different organic fluids that were selected as the most suitable for this application. The thermal matching that maximizes the net power output of the total system including engine cooling circuits and ORC cycle is found by applying the Heatsep method, which allows the optimum heat transfer between thermal streams to be evaluated independently of the structure/number of the heat exchangers within the system. Three layouts of the cooling systems collecting the heat available from the engines have been compared.

40|$|An {{expedient}} {{route to}} improving in-vehicle fuel economy in 4 -stroke cycle engines {{is to reduce}} the swept volume of an engine and run it at a higher BMEP for any given output. The full-load performance of a larger capacity engine can be achieved through pressure charging. However, for maximum fuel economy, particularly at part-load, the expansion ratio, and consequently the compression ratio (CR) should be kept as high as possible. This is at odds with the requirement in pressure-charged gasoline engines to reduce the CR at higher loads due to the knock limit. In earlier work, the authors studied a pressure-charging system aimed at allowing a high CR to be maintained at all times. The operation of this type of system involves deliberately over-compressing the <b>charge</b> <b>air,</b> <b>cooling</b> it at the elevated pressure and temperature, and then expanding it down to the desired plenum pressure, ensuring a plenum temperature which can potentially become sub-atmospheric at full-load. Due to the ability to support a high fixed CR, it is possible that an engine fitted with such a charging system could achieve fuel economy equal to or better than a Variable Compression Ratio unit, while permitting conventional engine architecture and assembly lines. The concept has been termed "Turboexpansion". This paper analyses some initial test bed results taken from an engine fitted with such a charging system, and discusses future development work intended to establish further the validity of the concept and hence its feasibility as a tool to facilitate aggressive engine downsizing.

Die vom Abgas auf das Kältemittel übertragbaren Wärmeströme reichen in weiten Teilen des Motorbetriebsfelds grundsätzlich aus, um den Dampfstrahlkälteprozess anzutreiben. Die kältemittelseitig notwendigen Antriebszustände konnten im einfachen Abgaswärmeübertragerprototyp erreicht und der Prozess kann problemlos über das Kältemittelantriebsdruckniveau geregelt werden. Die Wärmeübertragung im überkritischen Druckbereich des Kältemittels wurde durch ein Modell mit geeigneten Korrekturen der gängigen Nusseltbeziehungen mit einer mittleren arithmetischen Abweichung von nur 4, 7 % ausreichend genau abgebildet. Mit dem Modell der unterkritischen Wärmeübertragung wurden für die Arbeit ausreichend genaue Ergebnisse erzielt. Die Skalierung der Kälteleistung des Dampfstrahlkälteprozesses in den für die mobile Anwendung interessanten Leistungsbereich von 1, 5 kW bis 6 kW wurde mit für die weitere Kühlung der Ladeluft ausreichenden Temperaturhüben und absoluten Verdampfungstemperaturen von bis zu - 15 °C experimentell nachgewiesen. Die Mitführrate der Dampfstrahlverdichtung kann unter Berücksichtigung der Realgaseffekte bei gegebener Geometrie abhängig von den drei Ruhezuständen mit dem über einen physikalisch interpretierbaren Verlustkoeffizienten an die Experimente angepassten Simulationsmodell mit einer mittleren arithmetischen Abweichung von 7, 8 % berechnet werden. Die erzielbaren Ladelufttemperaturen von 12 °C bis - 3 °C sind bei Ottomotoren zur Wirkungsgradsteigerung nutzbar. Der zusätzliche Energieverbrauch für die Kältemittelpumpe sowie der Rückkühlbedarf, nicht aber der erhöhte Abgasgegendruck bzw. der Kraftstoffmehrverbrauch aufgrund des Anlagengewichts, gefährden allerdings bei geringen thermischen Wärmeverhältnissen die Vorteilhaftigkeit des Konzepts. Ein grundlegender Nachteil des Dampfstrahlkälteverfahrens ist zudem die Sensitivität des thermischen Wärmeverhältnisses gegenüber der Erhöhung der Umgebungstemperatur. Die hohen Prozessleistungsdichten sind der wesentliche Systemvorteil. The {{doctoral}} thesis at hand analyzes the characteristics {{and the potential}} of an exhaust gas heat driven jet-ejector cooling process working with R 134 a as refrigerant which is used for <b>charge</b> <b>air</b> <b>cooling</b> consecutive to the conventional charge air cooler of gasoline combustion engines in vehicles. The analysis focuses on the exhaust gas heat exchanger and the jet-ejector as core components of the cooling process which have been investigated separately by means of experiments and simulation. The heat flows transferable from the exhaust gases to the refrigerant are gene-rally sufficient to operate the jet-ejector cooling process almost in the entire operating range of the combustion engine. The necessary refrigerant-side conditions have been achieved in a simple heat exchanger prototype and the process may easily be controlled by the high side pressure of the refrigerant. The heat exchange at super-critical refrigerant pressures can be simulated with the developed model employing the adequate corrections of the well-established Nusselt relations with an arithmetic aver-age deviation of only 4. 7 % from the experimental results. The results of the model developed for the heat exchange at subcritical refrigerant pressures reproduce the experimental results satisfactorily for scope of the thesis. The down-scaling of the jet-ejector cooling process to the cooling capacity range of 1. 5 kW to 6 kW for the automotive application has been experimentally demonstrated. A sufficient temperature lift and absolute evaporation temperatures of down to - 15 °C for the continued <b>charge</b> <b>air</b> <b>cooling</b> have been achieved. The entrainment ratio of the jet-ejection can be calculated for a given ejector geometry dependent on the three stagnation conditions with an arithmetic aver- age deviation of 7. 8 % using a simulation model which accounts for real gas effects and allows a fit of the calculated to the experimental results {{by means of a}} loss coefficient with a clear physical meaning. The potential charge air temperatures of 12 °C to - 3 °C are adequate for improving the efficiency of gasoline engines. The additional energy consumption due to the refrigerant pump and the heat rejection demand, rather than the elevated back pressure or the additional fuel consumption due to the device's weight, may at low thermal coefficients of performance overcompensate the system's advantage. The high sensitivity of the thermal coefficient of performance to an increase of the ambient temperature is another essential disadvantage of the jet-ejection cooling process. The power densities are the substantial system advantage...|$|E

Engine control software development is expensive and time consuming process especially in marine industry. Engine modeling and rapid prototyping are proposed to shorten control system development cycles. Model in the loop simulation can be used to test control system functionality. For this purpose, a zero dimensional mean value engine model is parameterized for a Wärtsilä 6 cylinder medium speed four stroke dual fuel engine. Before parameterization, dual fuel engine operating cycle and combustion process are reviewed in order to model the processes based on physical phenomena. The Combustion Model is the most complex of all the modeled systems. Other systems of the mean value engine model are Engine Model that covers air flow through the engine, Gas System that models fuel gas admission, Fuel System that is in charge of diesel fuel injection, Lube Oil System that simulates heat transfer to lubricating oil and Cooling Water Circuit that handles engine and <b>charge</b> <b>air</b> <b>cooling.</b> These systems are modeled to a varying degree of accuracy. The equations used to model the components of each system are presented. Instrument and start air systems of the engine are not modeled. The engine model is made with Matlab/Simulink.

Test run on the actual engine is made to collect reference data of the engine’s performance. Measured data is used to parameterize the engine model via simulation on development computer. The model is then discretized for real time simulation. During real time simulation on target computer, engine controllers are parameterized to get realistic response. Engine model accuracy is validated by comparing steady-state performance and transient response of the model against measured engine data. Analysis of the results confirms that engine model accuracy is sufficient for control system functionality testing. However, the accuracy is not enough for control system calibration. Due to adequate accuracy, realistic cause and effect relationships between different engine systems and real time simulation capabilities, the engine model can be used for rapid prototyping based control system development...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, the {{shipping}} industry has faced {{an increasing number}} of challenges in terms of fluctuating fuel prices, stricter environmental regulations, and concerns about global warming. In this situation, passenger volumes on cruise ships have increased from around 4 million to 13 million from 1990 to 2008 and keep growing today. A small cruise ship can emit about 85 tons of CO 2 per day, and require around 27 tons of fuel per day. To keep up with market demand, while reducing their impact on the environment, cruise ships will need to improve their energy efficiency. Most previous research in marine technology relates to energy efficiency focused on propulsion, which for most ship types constitutes the largest energy demand. On cruise ships, however, auxiliary heat and electric power also have a significant importance. For this reason, we focus in this paper on the heat demand and its integration with available sources of waste heat on board. In this study, the principles of process integration are applied to the energy system of a cruise ship operating in the Baltic Sea. The heat sources (waste heat from the main and auxiliary engines in form of exhaust gas, cylinder cooling, <b>charge</b> <b>air</b> <b>cooling,</b> and lubricating oil cooling) and sinks (HVAC, hot water, fuel heating) are evaluated based on one year of operational data and used to generate four operating conditions that best represent ship operations. Applying the pinch analysis to the system revealed that the theoretical potential for heat integration on board could potentially allow the reduction of the external heat demand by between 35 % and 85 % depending on the investigated case. A technoeconomic optimisation allowed the identification of the most economically viable heat exchanger network designs: two in the “retrofit” scenario and one in the “design” scenario, with a reduction of 13 - 33 %, 15 - 27 % and 46 - 56 % of the external heat demand, respectively. Given the high amount of heat being available after the process integration, we also analysed the potential for the installation of a steam turbine for the recovery of the energy available in the exhaust gas, which resulted in up to 900 kW of power being available for on board electric power demand...|$|E

40|$|A modern {{diesel engine}} {{is capable of}} running {{efficiently}} with low exhaust gas emissions over a wide operating range. This is thanks to techniques such as turbocharging, EGR, <b>charge</b> <b>air</b> <b>cooling</b> and an advanced fuel injection process. The fuel injection process {{is important for the}} combustion and emission formation in the diesel engine. The fuel injector has to atomize and vaporize the fuel as it is injected. During the combustion the emission formation has to be kept to a minimum. Very strong pressure gradients are present in a modern diesel injection nozzle, this causes cavitation to occur in the nozzle holes. The influence of cavitation on flow parameters such as the various discharge coefficients is discussed. The occurrence of cavitation helps the spray break up and it can keep the nozzle holes free from deposits. Excessive amounts of cavitation can lead to hole erosion and thus impact the long term operation of the nozzle in a negative way. Hole erosion as well as other mechanisms can cause hole to hole variations in fuel spray impulse, mass flow, penetration etc. This is a very important issue in any low emission diesel engine, especially during transients, as less than optimal conditions have to be handled. The influence of hole to hole variation on fuel consumption and emissions is not very well known and this thesis contributes to the field. As a part of this work a fuel spray momentum measurement device was developed and tested. Any automotive engine {{needs to be able to}} perform quick transitions between different loads and speeds, so called transients. In a turbocharged diesel engine with EGR issues related to the turbocharger and the EGR-circuit arise. A diesel engine has to run with a certain air excess in order to achieve complete combustion with low emissions of soot. When turbocharging is used the turbocharger turbine uses some of the exhaust enthalpy to drive the turbo compressor, in this way the engine is provided with boost pressure. In order for the engine and turbocharger to function at the higher load and thus higher mass flow rate the turbocharger has to increase its rotational speed and the surface temperatures have to settle at a new thermodynamic state. Both of these processes take time and during this time the combustion process may have to proceed under less than optimum circumstances due to the low boost pressure...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe vast {{majority}} of today's cars remain powered by gasoline or Diesel engines. In the European market, Diesel cars accounts for 55 % of all new registrations while gasoline cars for 44 %. All the other technologies such as hybrids, fully electric or natural gas and ethanol powered cars combine {{to make up the}} remaining 1 %. Despite the publicity on these highly anticipated alternative technologies, statistics indicate that their usage remains marginal when compared to more ‘traditional’ powertrains. The internal combustion engine remains the principal way of transportation, at least for the foreseeable years. That being said, undesirable emissions (HC, CO, NOx, PM) are today's major concern because of their negative impact on air quality and global warming. The latest Euro 6 standard limits the CO emissions on a gasoline engine to 68 % and the PM (particulate matter) on a Diesel engine to 96 % lower than those established in 1992. CO 2 emissions which are directly proportional to consumption rates are recently added to the list with a target of 95 g/Km for 2020. The main trend for solving these issues is through engine downsizing with high rates of turbocharging accompanied by fuel injection control, after-treatment and system integration. Techniques that increment the energy saving costs. The ICCT (International Council on Clean Transportation) estimates that the cost of taking a 4 -cylinder 1. 5 L Diesel engine from no emission controls to the Euro 6 standard is around US$ 1400. A major technique to gain control of the engine processes and achieve high performance and low emission levels is through air handling depicted by air intake tuning, turbocharging tuning and <b>charge</b> <b>air</b> <b>cooling.</b> This article briefly describes the air intake line of 4 -cylinder 1. 5 L turbocharged Diesel engine and investigates the role of wave action phenomena on its intake line. The goal here is to achieve lower consumption and better performance by finding the optimal intake geometry. The latter comprises of a compressor wheel, a water cooled charge air cooler prototype (WCAC) and connecting pipes. The wave action effects were first explained and highlighted on a dynamic flow bench at “Mann+Hummel” using a frequency modeling approach which enabled to find the optimal length of piping upstream and downstream of the WCAC. Next this length was experimentally verified by mounting the different length on an engine test bench and registering pressure wave amplitudes. Finally the pressure recordings were fed to engine simulation software GT-PowerTM for a transient low speed simulation mimicking urban driving conditions and specific fuel consumption data were recovered. The result is a proposed air intake line for a turbocharged engine with a water cooled charge air cooler design choice. The proposed changes do not add any engine costs, but invests in significant R&D and retooling...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{request for}} more {{efficient}} fuel economy to save {{raw materials and}} to reduce air pollution {{becomes more and more}} crucial in the automotive industry. To fulfil this demand by weight reduction, conventional materials such as steel and copper are replaced by light metals. Due to its beneficial material properties e. g. low density, high strength, good formability and high thermal conductivity, aluminium becomes a frequently used candidate. Particularly in the heat-exchanger industry this change has already taken place. Heat-exchangers made of aluminium brazing sheets are used in various applications e. g. climate control, engine and transmission cooling and <b>charge</b> <b>air</b> <b>cooling.</b> Brazing sheets consist of a multilayer alloy system. A typical material combination in this field is an Al-Mn core alloy (AA 3 xxx) clad on one or both sides with an Al-Si alloy (AA 4 xxx). The benefit for this combination is given by the difference in the melting points of the two alloys. During the brazing process (around 590 °C) the core alloy provides structural integrity while the low melting point clad alloy melts and flows to provide upon cooling metallic bonding between the various components of the heat-exchanger. Due to the various conditions that a heat-exchanger is exposed to during its service life such as heating and cooling cycles, salt water environment on the surface and mechanical loading, the corrosion performance is a crucial point since it might cause perforation of the material resulting in a complete failure of the system. In order to understand the corrosion behaviour of the brazing sheets, it is necessary to have a deeper look at the microstructure, which is mainly determined by the composition of the alloying elements and heat treatments. The addition of alloying elements such as copper and iron provides beneficial material properties e. g. strength, good formability and brazeability, but can also change the corrosion mechanism from pitting, which is the preferred attack in pure aluminium, to more aggressive forms of localized attack, like intergranular and exfoliation corrosion. Furthermore thermal treatments such as solution heat treatment, aging, homogenisation or brazing significantly change the microstructure and hence modify the corrosion behaviour. To fulfil the requested corrosion performance, which is usually performed by salt spray testing (SWAAT), it is often necessary to apply a pre-treatment on the heat-exchanger. Besides protecting the aluminium brazing sheet of corrosion attack, the pre-treatment has to contain environmental friendly and low costs components. After accelerated corrosion testing of AA 4045 / 3003 / 4045 brazing sheets by SWAAT and electrochemical techniques, the corrosion propagation was attributed to potential differences within the brazing sheet causing a galvanically driven perforation of the core material by the diffusion zone. Furthermore a correlation between the SWAAT and potentiodynamic and potentiostatic polarization measurements is observed, offering a substitution of the SWAAT by these electrochemical techniques and hence reducing the testing time from several weeks (SWAAT) to less that one day. Corrosion prevention is achieved by immersing of the brazing sheets in an aqueous sodium silicate solution. The resulting silica passivation layer consists mainly of a dense SiO 2 network and provides a reduction of around 80 % of the corrosion propagation during SWAAT exposure. It is shown that the barrier properties are dependent on the respective pre-treatments conditions such as bath concentrations, curing times, curing temperatures and dipping times...|$|E

The contribution of the transport sector to the total concentration of PM 2. 5 in the ambient air is 12 % [1]. This value represents an average which likely is higher in areas near emission sources (i. e. urban area). PM abatement in exhausts of gasoline direct injection (GDI) engines, which aims to improve fuel efficiency, will be necessary due to the strengthening of the European legislations. GDI engines offer a number of opportunities for improving fuel efficiency, such as reducing pumping losses, <b>charge</b> <b>air</b> <b>cooling,</b> and downsizing when turbocharged [2]. However, direct injection of fuel into the engine cylinder is susceptible to incomplete fuel evaporation and to fuel impingement on piston and cylinder walls, both of which lead to combusti on of liquid fuel and, consequently, to PM emissions increase [3]. Gasoline Particulate Filters (GPF) are currently developed to mechanically filter the soot particles emitted by GDI engines. The particle sizes in this case are typically smaller in comparison with diesel engines [4]. Ultrafine particulate (UFP) matter (1 - 40 nm) emissions from a GDI engine (1. 6 L) were characterized {{as a function of}} the engine operating regime in terms of particle numbers and size distributions. Exhaust gas samples were analyzed upstream and downstream a three-way converter (TWC), as well as downstream a GPF, i. e. at the exhaust outlet. UFPs were analyzed with a Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer equipped with a dielectric barrier discharge, a differential mobility analyzer (176 channels) to classify the PM size range that enters into a Faraday-Cup Electrometer (FCE) to count the charged particulates (SMPS+E, Grimm). After a two stage dilution (realized by FPS 4000, DEKATI), the sampled aerosol was analyzed in the range 1 to 38 nm. SMPS+E data were compared with those of a SMPS (TSI, model 3080, PM size range 3 - 150 nm) and a DMS (Differential Mobility Spectrometer, Cambustion, PM size range analysis 5 - 1000 nm). In addition, the fraction of the elemental carbon in PM was estim ated with a Multi-Angle Absorption Photometer (MAAP, Thermo Scientific, model 5012). UFPs with diameters lower than 20 nm was detected upstream the TWC. UFPs total concentrations were high, in the range 2  20 1014 part/m 3 depending on the engine load. UFPs size distributions were found to be bimodal with mean diameters around 2 - 3 nm and 10 nm, respectively. The impact of TWC on UFP concentration and size was significant since a large part of UFPs, lower than 10 nm, was removed. Furthermore, the overall UFPs number was divided by one order of magnitude. The filtering efficiency for UFPs of the GPF was found to be high since no UFPs was detectable using the SMPS+E downstream the GPF (Fig. 1). These results will be discussed in relation with PM analysis in the range 5  200 nm, carbon elemental concentration as well as gas pollutant emissions.

They also calculate how the temperature of a fresh charge after a <b>charge</b> <b>air</b> <b>cooler</b> impacts the operating cycle indicators of such an engine.

40|$|International audienceThere exist two {{fundamental}} tools for modeling and simulating wave action of internal combustion engines. The {{first is a}} nonlinear time domain solution of the Euler equations using a space–time meshing. The second is a frequency domain solution of the linear wave equations. These two methods exist {{with a wide range}} of complexity and sophistication. Hybrid coupled methods also exist; they attempt to bridge the gap between the two techniques while maintaining the overall goal of engine simulation in mind. This work deals with the frequency characterization of a complex intake element, the <b>charge</b> <b>air</b> <b>cooler.</b> First, a transfer matrix for a simple tube is defined and measured. Two identical versions of the previous tube serve for identifying the transfer matrix of the <b>charge</b> <b>air</b> <b>cooler</b> directly on an operating four-cylinder turbocharged engine. Once the transfer matrix is measured, it is coupled to GT-Power as four transfer functions coded into Simulink. The final validation comprises two tubes in GT-Power with measured boundary conditions of pressure and mass flow with the Simulink model in between. Results are presented in the time and frequency domains with future objectives and perspectives as well...|$|R

The simulations have been performed in a proprietary software Star-CCM+. Physical phenomena have been solved by the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations and consequently a matrix of pressure drops for miscellaneous variations of chamber's geometry and the initial flow conditions has been created. Based on the CFD results, dependence between calculated pressure drops and changing parameters has been analyzed and finally a 1 D solver has been developed and implemented into a software OpenModelica...|$|R
40|$|Current trend on engine {{downsizing}} forces engine {{manufacturers to}} contemplate powertrains {{with more than}} one boosting device. The presence of these devices leads to complex 1 -D engine models which rely on performance maps provided by turbo/supercharger manufacturers. So far, no detailed analysis has been carried out to understand how these maps affect engine performance simulation. As part of the UltraBoost project (65 % gasoline engine downsizing), Imperial College tested the boosting components of a turbo-super configuration. The acquired data were used to assess the effectiveness of 1 -D engine performance prediction and to contemplate the opportunity to exploit the boosting system and use it as engine <b>charge</b> <b>air</b> <b>cooler</b> {{in the form of an}} expander...|$|R
40|$|National audienceIn {{order to}} {{increase}} the volumetric efficiency of downsized engines, turbochargers may be used. They allow the increase of the intake pressure and {{are associated with a}} <b>charge</b> <b>air</b> <b>cooler</b> (CAC). The main disadvantage of a downsized turbocharged engine (compared to a naturally aspirated one) is the deterioration of low-end torque caused by the lack of enthalpy of the exhaust gas at low engine speed and load. To investigate this issue, the intake line of a turbocharged Diesel engine was analyzed, focusing on the pressure waves at the inlet [1] [2] which are most often overlooked on these engines in favor of pressure loss reduction. A first step of the study is to identify the potential resonance for the establishment of standing waves at low engine speeds. Experimental tests with different pipe lengths upstream and downstream of the <b>charge</b> <b>air</b> <b>cooler</b> (CAC) were performed on an electrically driven engine test bench (pulse generator). This was done to study the influence of pressure waves on the air filling of the engine and determine the optimal length of the air circuit. In a second step, and to better understand the dynamic phenomena at the intake, the reflection coefficient at the interface of the CAC is calculated (method of pressure wave decomposition) from measurements on the engine test bench (with combustion). This allows to characterize the unsteady behavior of this element and to better discern the influence of the upstream and downstream ducts on engine filling. Finally, a new active system is proposed, it consists of a long pipe designed for acoustic tuning (low end torque) and a short pipe to minimize losses (high speed power generation). The acoustic response of this element is compared to that obtained with an equivalent length of straight pipe on the dynamic bench [3]...|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} use, however, is {{probably}} in vehicles. It {{is used in}} door seals, window seals, trunk seals, and sometimes hood seals. Frequently, these seals {{are the source of}} noise due to movement of the door against the car body and the resulting friction between the EPDM rubber and the mating surface (painted sheet metal or glass). This can be alleviated using specialty coatings that are applied at the time of manufacture of the weather seal. Such coatings can also greatly increase the chemical resistance of EPDM rubber. Some vehicle manufacturers also recommend a light application of silicone dielectric grease to weatherstripping to reduce noise. Other uses in vehicles include cooling system circuit hoses where water pumps, thermostats, EGR valves, EGR coolers, heaters, oil coolers, radiators, and degas bottles are connected with EPDM hoses, as well as <b>charge</b> <b>air</b> tubing on turbocharged engines to connect the cold side of the <b>charge</b> <b>air</b> <b>cooler</b> (intercooler) to the intake manifold.|$|R
40|$|Uptime and {{maintenance}} planning are important issues for vehicle operators (e. g. operators of bus fleets). Unplanned downtime {{can cause a}} bus operator to be fined if the vehicle is not on time. Supervised classification methods for detecting faults in vehicles are compared in this thesis. Data has been collected by a vehicle manufacturer including three kinds of faulty states in vehicles (i. e. <b>charge</b> <b>air</b> <b>cooler</b> leakage, radiator and air filter clogging). The problem consists of differentiating between the normal data and the three different categories of faulty data. Evaluated methods include linear model, neural networks model, 1 -nearest neighbor and random forest model. For every kind of model, a variable selection method should be used. In our thesis we {{try to find the}} best model for this problem, and also select the most important input signals. After we compare these four models, we found that the best accuracy (96. 9 % correct classifications) was achieved with the random forest model...|$|R
5000|$|More bespoke {{than the}} prior Ford Focus SVT (badged as the Focus ST170 in Europe), the Focus RS {{upgraded}} or replaced 70% {{of the standard}} Focus mechanicals. The turbocharged straight-4 engine produced a minimum of [...] and 310 Nm of torque, which was then mated to the 5-speed MTX-75 and not the Getrag transmission used in the ST 170. Mechanically, most notably, the car incorporated a Quaife automatic torque biasing differential to improve traction from the front-wheel drive setup. The steering used a similar quick-ratio rack as the ST170 while the brakes used fixed-caliper, four-piston Brembo units with 324 mm discs at the front and single-piston floating calipers and 280 mm discs at the back. Wheels were 18" [...] alloys specially developed by OZ Racing. The engine was heavily modified with forged aluminium pistons, hardened valve seats, sodium-filled exhaust valves, stainless steel exhaust system. The forced induction system comprised a Garrett turbocharger with a water-cooled <b>charge</b> <b>air</b> <b>cooler</b> and an electric water pump. To transmit the higher torque an upgraded AP clutch was used.|$|R
