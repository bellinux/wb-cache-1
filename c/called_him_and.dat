Nels was rebuffed again in 1993, when he offered to pay for DNA testing on the evidence from the murder, now that the technology was available; he was told that the police had to have a suspect in order to proceed with testing. Lazarus briefly reunited with Ruetten in 1989; Mayer's notes show that Ruetten had <b>called</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> asked whether he still considered her a suspect.|$|E

25|$|Vance asked Davidson to {{describe}} his fictitious band and their music. Initially, Davidson said that the Cruisers sounded like Dion and the Belmonts, but when they meet Frank, they have elements of Jim Morrison and The Doors. However, Davidson {{did not want to}} {{lose sight of the fact}} that the Cruisers were essentially a Jersey bar band, and he thought of Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band. The filmmaker told Vance to find him someone that could produce music that contained elements of these three bands. Davidson was getting close to rehearsals when Vance <b>called</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> said that he had found the band--John Cafferty & The Beaver Brown Band from Providence, Rhode Island.|$|E
25|$|Peterson taught {{piano and}} {{improvisation}} in Canada, mainly in Toronto. With associates, he started and headed the Advanced School of Contemporary Music in Toronto {{for five years}} during the 1960s, but it closed because concert touring <b>called</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> his associates away, {{and it did not}} have government funding. Later, he mentored the York University jazz program and was the Chancellor of the entire university for several years in the early 1990s. He also published his original jazz piano etudes for practice. However, he asked his students to study the music of Johann Sebastian Bach, especially The Well-Tempered Clavier, the Goldberg Variations, and The Art of Fugue, considering these piano pieces essential for every serious pianist. Pianists Benny Green and Oliver Jones were among his students.|$|E
25|$|The {{rapid change}} of sovereigns did Ronsard no harm. Charles IX, King of France, who succeeded his brother {{after a very}} short time, was even better {{inclined}} to him than Henry and Francis. He gave him rooms in the palace; he bestowed upon him diverse abbacies and priories; and he <b>called</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> regarded him constantly as his master in poetry. Neither was Charles IX a bad poet. This royal patronage, however, had its disagreeable side. It excited violent dislike to Ronsard {{on the part of}} the Huguenots, who wrote constant pasquinades against him, strove (by a ridiculous exaggeration of the Dionysiac festival at Arcueil, in which the friends had indulged to celebrate the success of the first French tragedy, Jodelle's Cleopatre) to represent him as a libertine and an atheist, and (which seems to have annoyed him more than anything else) set up his follower Du Bartas as his rival.|$|E

Nevertheless, on February 26, 2015, he publicly apologized to Bruno Mars on Twitter while asking him to sing a hook on a song that he co-produced.

Cartwright <b>called</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> left a message in a Cockney accent on his answering machine. Butler immediately called her back and agreed to be her mentor. He mailed her a script and instructed her to send him a tape recording of herself reading it. Once he received the tape, Butler critiqued it and sent her notes. For the next year they continued in this way, completing a new script every few weeks. Cartwright described Butler as [...] "absolutely amazing, always encouraging, always polite".|$|E

500|$|Having posted similar {{offensive}} {{statistics in}} the regular season, the Eagles and Cardinals were expected to play a tight game. Played in a blizzard at Philadelphia's Shibe Park, the game's only score was a fourth quarter rushing touchdown by Van Buren from five yards out. The 7–0 win gave the Eagles their first league title. Van Buren finished with 98 yards on 26 carries, though he nearly missed the game entirely. Thinking the game would not be played in the blizzard, he remained home until coach Greasy Neale <b>called</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> told him the game was still on. He had to catch three trolleys and walk six blocks {{in order to make}} the game on time. [...] "I looked out my bedroom window that morning, saw the snow and went back to bed," [...] he later explained. [...] "I was sure the game would be postponed." ...|$|E
500|$|... "One Son" [...] {{would be}} the last episode of the series to feature Owens' character, Jeffrey Spender, until the ninth season entry [...] "William".

Owens was {{slightly}} disappointed, noting that he had just been introduced in the series during the conclusion of the previous season. Davis was upset that Owens was leaving the series, and reportedly told Owens during their last scene together, [...] "I don't want to shoot you! I enjoy working with you!" [...] Owens, however, jokingly noted that Davis had no problems slapping him when the script called for it. In the episode, Laurie Holden, who played Marita Covarrubias, returns. Spotnitz crafted the sequence in which she confronts Mulder to be a way of [...] "taking away [...] beauty and making her [...] as horrifying as possible".

500|$|The series {{introduced}} a new incarnation of the Doctor, the Eleventh, played by Matt Smith. This followed the departure of David Tennant as the Tenth Doctor, who left the role to help ease the transition from Davies to Moffat's showrunning. Smith's agent had <b>called</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> suggested that he try out for the role. Moffat was looking to cast a middle-aged actor, who was [...] "young enough to run but old enough to look wise". However, Smith, who was only 26 when cast, was the third person to audition and the production team knew [...] " [...] had their man". The producers were cautious about casting Smith because they felt that a 26-year-old actor could not play the Doctor adequately; BBC Head of Drama and executive producer Piers Wenger shared the sentiment, but noted that Smith was capable enough to play the role. Moffat also stated that Smith {{did not appear to}} be youthful at all. [...] Smith's casting in the role was revealed during an episode of Doctor Whos companion show Doctor Who Confidential, during which he described the role as [...] "a wonderful privilege and challenge that I hope I will thrive on".|$|E
500|$|While {{he played}} for the Porto Rico Stars, Alejandro Pompéz <b>called</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> made him an offer {{to play with the}} New York Cubans, which at the time he owned. Pompéz became {{interested}} in Coimbre after hearing several reviews of his work, but he was skeptical of these claims and therefore he was hesitant to contract him at first and didn't do so until a group of players recommended him. He debuted in a game against a team named Buschwick, in a game that took place in Brooklyn, New York. In his first two games with the team he connected four hits, three singles and a double. Following this performance Pompéz informed him {{that he was going to}} stay with the team. After the season concluded he was instantly offered a second contract with the Cubans, which by this time where playing in the National League of the Negro League. He also participated with Ponce during the 19401941 season of the winter league and concluded the season with a batting average of [...]401 and no strikeouts. During his second season with the Cubans he had an average of [...]409, and was included in the league's All-star Game for the first time in his career.|$|E
500|$|According to Daniels, Rock City knew Sham {{but they}} had not heard the West Indian/Caribbean-themed music that he had {{composed}} during the camp. Sham played the music to them, to which the brothers responded [...] "Let's give Rihanna a one-drop! Like, a response to 'I shot the sheriff'!" [...] Together, Sham and Rock City wrote the lyrics to [...] "Man Down" [...] in twelve minutes. In an MTV News interview, Rock City said they intended to write a song that would embody Bob Marley's [...] "I Shot the Sheriff" [...] (1973) from a female perspective and to [...] "tap [...] island origins {{in a way that}} sounded authentic". Singer Shontelle said that Rihanna called her during the Last Girl on Earth tour and asked her to be involved with the song. She confirmed that Rihanna was present when she was writing her part in the recording studio. Shontelle elucidated that following one of Rihanna's concerts, the singer exited the stage and immediately returned to the tour bus to work in the studio. Daniels said that once the writing camp had concluded, Rihanna listened to all of the songs which had been composed for her and chose her favorites. In September 2010, several months after Sham attended the writing camp, Rihanna <b>called</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> said that she wanted to record [...] "Man Down" [...] for inclusion on Loud.|$|E

500|$|In 1994, Larry Kasanoff and his {{production}} company, Threshold Entertainment, held {{the rights to}} do a live-action G.I. Joe film with Warner Bros. as the distributor, but instead chose to concentrate the company's efforts upon its Mortal Kombat films. As late as 1999, there had been rumors that a film from Threshold Entertainment was still a possibility, but that project never panned out. In 2003, Lorenzo di Bonaventura was interested in making a film about advanced military technology; Hasbro's Brian Goldner <b>called</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> suggested to base the film on the G.I. Joe toy line. Goldner and di Bonaventura worked together before, creating toy lines for films di Bonaventura had produced as CEO of Warner Bros. Goldner and di Bonaventura spent three months working out a story, and chose Michael B. Gordon as screenwriter, because they liked his script for 300. Di Bonaventura wanted to depict the origin story of certain characters, and introduced the new character of Rex, to allow an exploration of Duke. Rex's name came from Hasbro. Beforehand, Don Murphy was interested in filming the property, but when the Iraq War broke out, he considered the subject matter inappropriate, and chose to develop Transformers (another Hasbro toy line) instead. Di Bonaventura related, [...] "What [...] stand for, and what Duke stands for specifically in the movie, is something that I'd like to think a worldwide audience might connect with." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{read-through}} for [...] "The Rings of Ahkaten" [...] {{was held}} on 17 October 2012, with filming beginning the next week on 22 October. Director Farren Blackburn had previously worked on the programme in the 2011 Christmas special [...] "The Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe". According to Matt Smith, there were [...] "between 50 and 60 prosthetic aliens" [...] in a scene set in an alien market. The Doctor features minimally in the first act because Smith was busy filming pick-ups or reshoots for [...] "Nightmare in Silver". Millennium FX's Neill Gorton remarked that he had [...] "always {{wanted to do a}} scene like the Star Wars cantina" [...] and had worked on different moulds in his spare time in case they could be used in the future, as making thirty different aliens at one time would be out of the budget. Much of the episode was constructed around talks of what could be created with limited resources. For example, Cross recalled that producer Marcus Wilson <b>called</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> asked, [...] "We've always wanted to have a speeder-bike like in Return of the Jedi and we {{know how to do it}} inexpensively, so can you get one into the story?" [...] However, Cross felt that the speeder-bike ended up having more in common with Flash Gordon. The songs were written by composer Murray Gold. To help establish the year at the beginning of the episode [...] "Ghost Town" [...] by The Specials is heard and the Doctor is seen reading a 1981 copy of The Beano. The issue of The Beano was reprinted and included in a special Doctor Who-themed edition on 15 May 2013.|$|E
500|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{directed}} by film-maker Brett Ratner in Los Angeles, and features a cameo appearance from 30 Rock's Jack McBrayer. Prior to filming the video, or releasing the single, Carey had toned her body, and lost a reported twenty pounds. Due to her slim-down, she and Ratner wanted to flaunt Carey's new figure {{as much as possible}} throughout the video: [...] "Mariah looks better than she has ever looked. It's ridiculous. Mariah has an incredible body, but she was always kind of very voluptuous. Now she's just like, fit. And we were like, we've got to show this body." [...] As the pair came up with the video's plot, Ratner contacted McBrayer to play a male leading role, alongside Carey. After receiving the call, McBrayer claimed he was so shocked by the proposal, that he didn't believe it at first. He only met with the producers after Ratner personally <b>called</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> assured him the authenticity of the offer. In an interview with MTV News, McBrayer joked [...] "I'm always worried now that somebody is pranking me, so at first I was very leery. But when I heard it was legit, and then later on we {{got a phone call from}} Brett Ratner, who directed it. I was like, 'This is either a very elaborate prank, or this is the real deal.'" [...] In the fantasy-themed story, he recalled what he considered the video's most memorable scene, in which he and Carey, dressed in medieval attire, were walking with a unicorn. Additionally, he described the filming process as very simple, as they were given very loose directions and pointers. McBrayer claimed that during one take, they were meant to play Frisbee on the mansion lawn, and he accidentally threw it at Carey's face, jokingly adding [...] "by the time she spins back around — bonk, right in her face. I threw a Frisbee in Mariah Carey's face! I'm like, I'm fired!." [...] When questioned by critics regarding the song and video, Carey responded [...] "Have you seen the 'Touch My Body' video? C'mon. Clearly you must see the humour in that. Even the lyrics, 'I will hunt you down'. If anyone doesn't get the joke by this time then they are an idiot." [...] In an interview with Reuters, Carey described working with Ratner, and her experience filming the video: ...|$|E
