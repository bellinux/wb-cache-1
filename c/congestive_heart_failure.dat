40|$|Number 9 in this Series High-altitude {{pulmonary}} hypertension: a pathophysiological entity {{to different}} diseases M. Maggiorini*, F. Léon-Velarde# High-altitude pulmonary hypertension: a pathophysiological entity to different diseases. M. Maggiorini, F. Léon-Velarde. #ERS Journals Ltd 2003. ABSTRACT: Pulmonary hypertension is {{a hallmark of}} high-altitude pulmonary oedema (HAPE) and of <b>congestive</b> right <b>heart</b> <b>failure</b> in subacute mountain sickness (SMS) and chronic mountain sickness (CMS) in the Himalayas and in the end-stage of CMS (Monge 9 s disease) in the Andes. There are studies to suggest that transmission of excessively elevated pulmonary artery pressure and/or flow to the pulmonary capillaries leading to alveolar haemorrhage is the pathophysiological mechanism of HAPE. In the Himalayas, HAPE was successfully prevented by extending the acclimatisa-tion period from {{a few days to}} 5 weeks, however, this did not prevent the occurrence of <b>congestive</b> right <b>heart</b> <b>failure</b> after several weeks of stay at 6, 000 m. This leads to the concept that rapid remodelling of the small precapillary arteries prevents HAPE but not the development of right <b>heart</b> <b>failure</b> in SMS and CMS. Unresponsiveness of pulmonary hypertension to oxygen at high altitude and its complete resolution only after weeks of stay at low altitude suggest that structural rather than functional changes are its pathophysiological mechanism. Since pulmonary hypertension at high altitude is the driving force leading to high-altitude pulmonary oedema and "high-altitude right <b>heart</b> <b>failure</b> " in newcomers and residents of high altitude, the authors propose to adjust current terminology accordingly...|$|R

30|$|C 4.5 {{algorithm}} {{is one of}} the well-known decision tree algorithms because of its efficiency and comprehensive features (Quinlan 1993). It is an improved extension of ID 3 algorithm and it has been used in different disciplines of medical field including cardiology (Esfandiari et al. 2014). Pavlopoulos et al. (Pavlopoulos et al. 2004) used the C 4.5 algorithm to analyze different heart sound features, which assist clinicians to make a better diagnosis in Coronary Heart Disease (CHD). Mašetić and Subasi have evaluated the effect of C 4.5 decision tree in creating a model that will detect and separate normal and <b>Congestive</b> <b>Heart</b> <b>Failures</b> (CHF) on the long-term ECG time series. Experimental results showed that C 4.5 algorithm has significant role in identification and classification of ECG (ElectroCardioGram) heartbeat signals with an accuracy of 99.86  % (Mašetic and Subasi 2013). Karaolis et al. developed a decision tree based system for the assessment of coronary heart disease related risk factors targeting in the reduction of CHD events. The system has shown highest and promising accuracy rates (Karaolis et al. 2010). Overall, the results obtained by studies applying C 4.5 algorithm in cardiology were satisfactory.

40|$|Background: Traumatic {{tricuspid valve}} {{regurgitation}} (TR) {{is usually a}} result of blunt chest trauma.

The tumor was deemed inoperable and palliative ambulatory chemotherapy was initiated. We aimed at a palliative reduction of tumor mass after chemotherapy and atypical vascularization of the metastasis was demonstrated by coronary angiography. We identified two tumor vessels originating from the ramus circumflexus suitable to palliative percutaneous coronary intervention. Within 5 weeks, the initially mild dyspnea increased to New York Heart Association class III and readmission was planned. Regrettably, our patient died from <b>congestive</b> right <b>heart</b> <b>failure</b> only 2 months after diagnosis of tumor recurrence.

5|$|The most {{dangerous}} {{side effect of}} doxorubicin is dilated cardiomyopathy, leading to <b>congestive</b> <b>heart</b> <b>failure.</b> The rate of cardiomyopathy is dependent on its cumulative dose, with an incidence about 4% when the dose of doxorubicin is 500–550mg/m², 18% when the dose is 551–600mg/m² and 36% when the dose exceeds 600mg/m². There are several ways in which doxorubicin is believed to cause cardiomyopathy, including oxidative stress, downregulation of genes for contractile proteins, and p53 mediated apoptosis.

40|$|AbstractThe {{goal of this}} {{systematic}} analysis {{is to provide a}} comprehensive review of the current cardiac magnetic resonance data on microvascular obstruction (MVO) and intramyocardial hemorrhage (IMH). Data related to the association of MVO and IMH in patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) with left ventricular (LV) function, volumes, adverse LV remodeling, and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) were critically analyzed. MVO is associated with a lower ejection fraction, increased ventricular volumes and infarct size, and a greater risk of MACE. Late MVO is shown to be a stronger prognostic marker for MACE and cardiac death, recurrent MI, <b>congestive</b> <b>heart</b> failure/heart <b>failure</b> hospitalization, and follow-up LV end-systolic volumes than early MVO.

40|$|Multicenter {{trials have}} {{demonstrated}} that in patients with sinus rhythm ivabradine is effective in the therapy of ischemic heart disease and of impaired left ventricular systolic function. Ivabradine is ineffective in atrial fibrillation. Many patients with symptomatic <b>heart</b> <b>failure</b> have diastolic dysfunction with preserved left ventricular systolic function, and many have asymptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Ivabradine is not indicated in these conditions, but it happens that it is erroneously used. Digoxin is now considered an outdated and potentially dangerous drug and while effective in the mentioned conditions, is rarely used. The aim {{of the study was}} to compare the therapeutic effects of ivabradine in diastolic <b>heart</b> <b>failure</b> with preserved left ventricular systolic function. Patients were assigned to ivabradine or digoxin according to a randomization cross-over design. Data were single-blind analyzed. The analysis was performed using an intention-to-treat method. Forty-two coronary patients were selected. In spite of maximally tolerated therapy with renin-antagonists, diuretics and ?-blockers, they had <b>congestive</b> diastolic <b>heart</b> <b>failure</b> with preserved systolic function. Both ivabradine and digoxin had positive effects on dyspnea, Nterminal natriuretic peptide, heart rate, duration of 6 -min. walk-test and signs of diastolic dysfunction, but digoxin was high-statistically more effective. Side-effects were irrelevant.

Physical examination revealed an exaggerated inspiratory effort, severe ascites, bilateral jugular vein distension, and hypokinetic femoral arterial pulses. Thoracic auscultation detected tachycardia with muffled heart sounds, without audible cardiac murmurs. Thoracic radiographs identified severe right ventricular enlargement and pleural effusion. The electrocardiogram {{was consistent with}} incomplete right bundle branch block or right ventricular enlargement. Echocardiography demonstrated severe right ventricular and atrial dilation, secondary tricuspid regurgitation, and thinning and hypocontractility of the right ventricular myocardium. Left heart chamber sizes were slightly decreased, with normal left ventricular contractility. Adiagnosis of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy was reached, based on the characteristic clinical, electrocardiographic, radiographic and echocardiographic findings, and the exclusion of other causes of isolated right ventricular failure.
