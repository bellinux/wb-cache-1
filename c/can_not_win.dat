At that very time Ritter offered an opposing view on Portuguese radio station TSF: [...] "The United States is going to leave Iraq with its tail between its legs, defeated. It is a war we <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>win...</b> We {{do not have the}} military means to take over Baghdad and for this reason I believe the defeat of the United States in this war is inevitable... Every time we confront Iraqi troops we may win some tactical battles, as we did for ten years in Vietnam, but {{we will not be able}} to win this war, which in my opinion is already lost," [...] Ritter added.|$|E
2500|$|Finally, the {{committee}} condemned {{the dismissal of}} Admiral Louis E. Denfeld, the Chief of Naval Operations, who accepted cancellation of the supercarrier but testified critically on defense planning and administration of unification. Secretary of the Navy Francis P. Matthews fired Denfeld on October 27, 1949, explaining that he and Denfeld disagreed widely on strategic policy and unification. The House Armed Services Committee concluded that Denfeld's removal by Matthews was a reprisal because of Denfield's testimony and a challenge to effective representative government. Matthew's perceived vindictiveness towards much of the Navy's uniformed senior leadership during his tenure led to a perception by {{both the public and}} the U.S Congress of the Navy's civilian leadership woes, a perception that also did not go totally unnoticed by the news media of the period. As The Washington Daily News reported at the time, [...] "â€¦Secretary of the Navy Matthews does not have the confidence of the Navy and <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>win</b> it...Moreover, Mr. Matthews has forfeited the confidence of Congress by firing Admiral Denfeld." [...] Matthews resigned as Secretary of the Navy in July 1951 to become Ambassador to Ireland.|$|E

Odysseus and Diomedes (or, according to some accounts, Odysseus and Neoptolemus) leave to retrieve them. Upon their arrival, Philoctetes (still suffering from the wound) is seen still to be enraged at the Danaans, especially Odysseus, for abandoning him.

40|$|John Bell {{taught us}} that quantum {{mechanics}} <b>can</b> <b>not</b> be reproduced by non-contextual and local Hidden variable theory. The impossibility of replacing quantum mechanics by non-contextual Hidden Variable Theory can be turned to a impossible coloring pseudo-telepathy game to be played by two distant players. The game <b>can</b> <b>not</b> be <b>won</b> without communication in the classical world. But if the players share entangled state (quantum correlation) the game can be won deterministically using no communication. This again shows that though quantum correlation <b>can</b> <b>not</b> be used for communication, two parties <b>can</b> <b>not</b> simulate quantum correlation without classical communication. The motivation of the article is to present the earlier works on Hidden Variable Theory and recently developed pseudo-telepathy problem in a simpler way, which may be helpful for the beginners in this area.

40|$|We study biased Maker-Breaker {{positional}} games {{between two}} players, {{one of whom}} is playing randomly against an opponent with an optimal strategy. In this work we focus on the case of Breaker playing randomly and Maker being "clever". The reverse scenario is treated in a separate paper. We determine the sharp threshold bias of classical games played on the edge set of the complete graph $K_n$, such as connectivity, perfect matching, Hamiltonicity, and minimum degree-$ 1 $. In all of these games, the threshold is equal to the trivial upper bound implied by the number of edges needed for Maker to occupy a winning set. Moreover, we show that the clever Maker <b>can</b> <b>not</b> only <b>win</b> against an asymptotically optimal bias, but can do so very fast, wasting only logarithmically many moves (while the winning set sizes are linear in $n$).

Robic and Fachleitner, fifth in the general classification, started to work together, and left Brambilla and Ronconi minutes behind. Around 140 km before the finish, they were three minutes ahead of Brambilla, which made Robic the virtual leader of the race.

50|$|For example, if {{a player}} has only the 7 of {{diamonds}} and 8 of diamonds left in their hand, and they draw the 9 of diamonds (forming a sequence), then whether they win the hand or not depends on if they are playing the discard rule variation. If they are playing this variation, they <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>win</b> the hand at this point, {{because they have to}} finish the turn by discarding one of the three cards in their hand, causing them to no longer have a sequence. However, if the player is allowed to lay off this sequence without a final discard, then the game ends when the player lays down the sequence. And a player can lay down cards afterwards.
