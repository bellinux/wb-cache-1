5|$|It {{was decided}} the <b>case</b> <b>would</b> {{be heard by}} the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Coleridge. His court at the Royal Courts of Justice, London, was {{converted}} to accommodate the case by raising {{the height of the}} bench and witness box and installing new seating. In May it was announced that the <b>case</b> <b>would</b> start on 1 June, and that entry to the court would be by ticket only.|$|E
5|$|A {{company board}} member, Victor Coen, was {{convinced}} that the company had been treated wrongly and insisted in bringing it before the courts. In May 1929, he convinced the rest of the board to issue a writ against the syndicate and Oppenheimer, alleging fraudulent conspiracy, and began instructing Hastings. Hastings worried that the <b>case</b> <b>would</b> become unmanageable, with the syndicate relying on over 4,000 documents for their defence, but luckily found a certificate showing that the company profits, rather than the five percent Oppenheimer had reported, were in fact seventeen percent.|$|E
5|$|Anxious {{to protect}} the Papal States' {{precarious}} diplomatic position, the Cardinal Secretary of State Giacomo Antonelli liaised with Rome's Jewish community to arrange a meeting with Momolo Mortara, and received him politely in early August 1858. Antonelli promised that the matter would be referred to the Pope and granted Momolo's request that he be allowed to visit Edgardo regularly in the House of Catechumens. Kertzer cites Antonelli's concession of repeated visits, {{as opposed to the}} usual single meeting, as the first sign that the Mortara <b>case</b> <b>would</b> take on a special significance.|$|E

5|$|For his part, Thompson said {{he thought}} the judge was trying to protect Moore's {{criminal}} conviction at any cost. He also complained about the judge's ethics, saying a local attorney who claimed to have influence on the judge had assured him the <b>case</b> <b>would</b> be dismissed unless the attorney was on Thompson's team, and also claimed that Rockstar Entertainment and Take Two Interactive posted slanderous comments about him on their website.|$|E
5|$|His <b>case</b> <b>would</b> {{make its}} way to the United States Supreme Court, where his {{conviction}} for breaking curfew was affirmed. After internment during most of World War II, he moved to Denver, Colorado in 1944. In Denver, Yasui married and became a local leader in civic affairs, including leadership positions in the Japanese American Citizens League. In 1986, his criminal conviction was overturned by the federal court.|$|E
5|$|In {{the event}} that a person lacks standing, there is a {{possibility}} that he or she may be able to ask the Attorney-General to allow him or her to bring a relator action. In this scenario, the Attorney-General would be the nominal plaintiff in the judicial review proceedings, but the <b>case</b> <b>would</b> actually be conducted by the individual. Bringing a relator action is one means of circumventing the requirement of standing on the part of the individual applicant, because the Attorney-General has an interest in upholding the law for the public benefit.|$|E

5|$|Neither treaty {{made any}} {{provision}} {{as to the}} mode or {{manner in which the}} removal of the Indians or surrender of the reservations was to take place. The grantees have assumed that they were authorized to take forcible possession of the two reservations, or of the four, as the <b>case</b> <b>would</b> have been under the first treaty. The plaintiff in this case was expelled by force; and unless this mode of removal can be sustained, the recovery against the defendants for the trespass was right, and must be affirmed.|$|E
5|$|The {{case was}} remanded to the Ninth Circuit, which {{declared}} the arbitration agreement unconscionable under California law. That precluded arbitration proceedings and allowed Adams {{to pursue a}} regular lawsuit in California courts. Adams was then able to pursue the original claims notwithstanding the decision by Justice Kennedy. In {{the aftermath of the}} case, legal analysts said that this <b>case</b> <b>would</b> be important for future arbitration case law.|$|E
5|$|Beginning with {{statehood}} in 1859, {{the court}} had just four justices, one for each judicial district in the state. The constitution created by the Oregon Constitutional Convention in 1857 called for these justices to serve as both circuit court judges and supreme court justices. This was set to remain until {{the population of the}} state reached 100,000 people. Each justice was assigned one district, and then all justices would gather at set intervals to confer on appeals, which would occur at least once per year and were authorized to meet more frequently if needed. On appeals, the justice who presided over the lower court <b>case</b> <b>would</b> not participate in the proceedings.|$|E

5|$|In 1874, in a {{district}} court case, Deady {{ruled in favor of}} Marcus Neff in a lawsuit against Sylvester Pennoyer concerning unpaid legal fees to John H. Mitchell and a sheriff's auction of Neff's land to Pennoyer. The <b>case</b> <b>would</b> become the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision of Pennoyer v. Neff that helped define the law of personal jurisdiction. In 1885, Deady admitted Mary Leonard to the federal bar, the first woman admitted to practice in Oregon, though the Oregon Supreme Court at first denied her admittance to the state bar on technical grounds. Later that year the Oregon legislature resolved the technical issue in the statute and the state high court admitted Leonard into the state bar.|$|E
5|$|Lam Wing-kee (林榮基, age 60), {{the founder}} of Causeway Bay Books, has been missing since 24 October 2015. He habitually spent long hours at the {{bookshop}} and occasionally slept there. His wife filed a missing persons report with the police on 5 November and his family received {{a telephone call from}} him several hours later; he refused to reveal his whereabouts. When filing the police report, they were referred to the Immigration Department, who said it was against privacy policy to reveal a person's records of entry and exit of Hong Kong without the subject's permission. However, legislator James To said this was a reasonable request that was exempt from privacy policy. Police followed up on his case once, asking whether they had heard from him. His family allege that upon learning that he had contacted his family, the officer who called them informed that the <b>case</b> <b>would</b> be closed as resolved.|$|E
5|$|Olaf's {{father is}} {{identifiable}} as Gofraid, who was king of Dublin between 920 and 934, and also briefly ruled Northumbria in 927. Gofraid was a grandson of Ímar but no patronymic {{is given in}} the original sources. This may be {{because he was a}} child of a son of Ímar who never ruled Dublin, or he was a child of a daughter of Ímar, which in either <b>case</b> <b>would</b> mean his legitimacy to rule in the eyes of his contemporaries was dependent on the identity of his grandfather, not his parents. Ímar, possibly identical to Ivar the Boneless, was the founder of the Uí Ímair {{and was one of the}} earliest kings of Dublin in the mid-ninth century.|$|E

5000|$|Despite the {{problems}} with space and financial matters, in 1910, Dr. Boardman was able to attain five new display cases for the museum.

The final touches would include brackets that have a  nickel plate finish or a “gunmetal finish.” The corners would have a bronze framework that was seven eighths of an inch thick while the points where the framework joined together were two and one-eighth inches thick. The cases also needed to have measures that would ensure pests {{were not able to}} enter them so they also had “poison patented dust proofing.” [...] The cost for the metal <b>cases</b> <b>would</b> be $918 and the wood bases would total $528 for a grand total of $1446 [...] which would have had to been paid within 30 days of all the work being completed and included delivery and setup.|$|R
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} start of class, {{kindergarten}} teacher Rebecca Adler (Robin Tunney) becomes dysphasic, falls to the floor, and experiences seizures. Dr. James Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard) attempts to convince the curmudgeonly Gregory House to treat Adler, but House initially dismisses him, believing that the <b>case</b> <b>would</b> be boring. Hospital administrator Dr. Lisa Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein) approaches House in the elevator and attempts to persuade him to fulfill his duties at the hospital's walk-in clinic, a task House loathes because the cases are usually simplistic. House refuses, claiming that Cuddy cannot fire him due to tenure, and hurriedly leaves. When House's team attempts to perform an MRI on Adler, they discover that House's authorization for diagnostics has been revoked; Cuddy restores his authorization in exchange for his working at the clinic.|$|E
5|$|With the {{assistance}} of hundreds of volunteers, Aruban investigators conducted an extensive search and rescue operation. American special agents from the FBI, fifty Dutch soldiers and three specially-equipped Dutch Air Force F-16 aircraft participated in the search. In addition to the ground search, divers searched the ocean floor for Holloway's body. Her remains were not found. On December 18, 2007, Aruban prosecutors announced that the <b>case</b> <b>would</b> be closed without any charges made. The Aruban prosecutor's office reopened the case on February 1, 2008, after receiving video footage of Van der Sloot, {{under the influence of}} marijuana, saying that Holloway died on the morning of her disappearance, and that a friend had disposed of her body. Van der Sloot later denied that what he had said was true, and in an interview said that he had sold Holloway into sexual slavery. He later retracted his comments. In 2012, Van der Sloot was convicted of the May 30, 2010, murder of Stephany Flores Ramírez in Lima, Peru.|$|E
5|$|The {{action of}} assumpsit had several {{advantages}} over a writ of debt; the plaintiff could count on always having a jury, while in writs of debt the defendant could rely on wager of law, where he produced twelve people to swear he did not owe the plaintiff money and had the case dismissed. In addition, it worked for executory agreements, not just normal contracts. In 1585 {{a new form of}} the Court of Exchequer Chamber was set up, an appellate court where the Common Pleas judges held a majority, and regularly began to reverse King's Bench judgments which were based on assumpsit. This, and the conflict between the King's Bench and the Common Pleas as a whole, was problematic; a plaintiff at assizes could not be sure which sort of judge his <b>case</b> <b>would</b> come before, lending uncertainty to the law. Boyer suggests that, in this environment, the Chief Justice of the King's Bench John Popham deliberately provoked the Common Pleas to resolve the matter, and did so through Slade's Case.|$|E

5|$|UA 8699 was {{discovered}} in a joint study by Stony Brook University and the University of Antananarivo (UA) {{and placed in the}} collections of the latter as specimen 8699. It was found at a locality named MAD93-95 in the Anembalemba Member of the Maevarano Formation, which is Maastrichtian (latest Cretaceous) in age. The locality is in the Mahajanga Basin of northwestern Madagascar. Several other mammals have been recovered from similarly aged Madagascar deposits, but most are also known from very limited material. These include the gondwanathere Lavanify, an indeterminate multituberculate, and a few other indeterminate teeth, as well as a nearly complete skeleton representing an otherwise unknown mammalian lineage. In a 2001 Nature paper, David Krause announced the discovery of UA 8699 and argued for marsupial affinities of the specimen. Because the specimen is so fragmentary, he refrained from assigning a new scientific name to the tooth. Two years later, Alexander Averianov, David Archibald, and Thomas Martin favored a placental interpretation in a paper in Acta Palaeontologica Polonica, noting that the specimen was essentially similar to the zhelestid Lainodon. In a 2006 review of some of the Cretaceous vertebrates of Madagascar, Krause and colleagues continued to consider the specimen as a marsupial and announced that an upcoming paper by <b>Case</b> <b>would</b> make the case for marsupial affinities more fully.|$|E
