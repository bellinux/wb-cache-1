Among these mechanisms, one of the most important is that of physiological arousal, which is often associated with excitement and pleasure. Engaging in communication interactions, particularly in face-to-face situations, triggers physiological arousal in human beings.

At threatened points they formed mixed German and Austro-Hungarian units and other Austro-Hungarian formations were bolstered by a sprinkling of German officers. The derelict citadel of the Brest Fortress was refurbished as their headquarters.

[...] The Ottomans sent a corps to reinforce the German Southern Army, which had to hold Galicia because it was a major source of petroleum. The Russians then struck on Brusilov’s right with their best troops, the Guards Army, and the heaviest artillery concentration yet seen on the Eastern Front. Their military maps were sketchy, because they had never planned to fight so deep in their own territory, so the Guards were sent to advance through a swamp; in a week they lost 80 per cent of their men. Further south Brusilov did better, penetrating a few kilometers into Hungary, but when the front stabilized the Russians faced new fortifications dug and wired on the German pattern. Officers were exchanged between the German and Austro-Hungarian armies for training.|$|E

The likelihood, which can be represented by a quality value, may be a function of number of contacts, timing of contacts, or both the number and timing of contacts in a given velocity profile. A preselected threshold value, which is related to false alarm rate, is compared to the most likely, or highest quality, velocity profile associated with a contact of interest. If the highest quality value exceeds the threshold value, an output is provided indicating that the contact of interest represents a probable target having a velocity within the band defined by the highest quality velocity profile...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the development of}} Sinn Féin's communication strategies and considers how {{news coverage of the}} party has evolved in recent years, and in particular {{with the advent of the}} Irish peace process from the mid- 1990 s onwards. The aim of the research presented here is to establish the relationship between the development of the party's professional <b>communication</b> <b>apparatus</b> and the evolution of its news coverage and to determine the extent to which the emergence of a sophisticated approach to communication has impacted upon media coverage. The thesis argues that the development and implementation of the party's professional <b>communication</b> <b>apparatus</b> has been the result of a much wider process of republican reappraisal that took place during the 1980 s. This culminated in the 1990 s with the transformation of the republican movement into a more constitutional and negotiation-oriented party, while progressively moving away from the armed struggle as a means to achieve Irish re-unification. Moreover, in emphasising that there has been a considerable improvement in the reporting of Sinn Féin; namely that the news media have become progressively more interested in republican predicaments, less biased and more critical of unionism, it also suggests that the improved media coverage must be seen as a result of the political re-alignment of the movement itself. Ultimately, the main argument of this thesis is that we are now witnessing a new phase of the republican movement and, by proxy, of Northern Irish politics and its coverage in the media. This has meant that Sinn Féin has become more wiling to reach a political compromise and to find a peaceful solution to the conflct, and has attempted to affirm itself as a party with political and social interests, other than Irish re-unification. This has also forced the British government to reappraise its own view of the conflict and of Sinn Féin, recognising above all that the party and Northern Irish politics have evolved from a situation of war to one where it is dominated by careful and sensitive diplomacy. The result is that most of the common assumptions held about Sinn Féin including those of some academics, its political communication and its news coverage, must now be reconsidered in light of the radical transformations that have taken place...|$|E

This article will argue that beyond the specific object of our study, the EU is a political object that requires the same sociological approaches as other political objects where this approach seems only "natural".

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this work}} was to {{evaluate}} the Primary Health Care service performance in National Tuberculosis Control Program in Qalyubia Governorate. Methods: The studied area (Qalyubia Governorate) includes 8 health territories (each contains 5 primary care units/centers). A questionnaire based on 6 parameters {{was used to evaluate}} the PHC system performance: I – Physicians with basic knowledge about TB (causative agent, methods of spread, clinical picture, essential steps in investigations: X-ray and sputum smear), II – Facilities for primary investigation (sputum examination and chest X-ray), III – Communication with the central health authorities or a TB specialist, IV – Proper recording systems needed for proper patient management and follow up, V – Follow up schedules are available for the detected patients, VI – Have a role in community education about the disease. The data obtained were tabulated and statistically analyzed. Results: Studied area included 8 health territories and 40 primary care units (35 % were urban and 65 % rural) with one physician in each unit. The mean percent of the correct answers of the basic knowledge score was 48. 2 % (range =  18 %– 100 %), higher in urban units physicians than rural units physicians, with lack of proper laboratory (for sputum analysis) or X-ray <b>apparatus.</b> <b>Communication</b> with central health authorities in urban areas was higher than rural areas (65. 4 % versus 57. 1 %).

3000|$|Table  4 shows, {{whether it}} is from the {{perspective}} of “global comparative advantage” or of “local comparative advantage” (Deardorff 2004), the aggregate trade cost has the effect on export structure of manufacturing, 9 which indicates the trade cost is similar with the material capital and human capital, and is also a factor that influences the trade pattern or structure. The increase in Chinese aggregate trade cost significantly reduces the export share of manufacturing. This effect in the industry with higher trade cost sensitivity is more obvious, and thereby affects the structure of trade commodities. Specifically, the trade cost sensitivity of “manufacturing of office, accounting and computing machinery (C 30)” is highest with the value of 0.523639; the trade cost sensitivity of “manufacture of radio, television and <b>communication</b> equipment and <b>apparatus</b> (C 32)” ranks second with the value of 0.464463; the trade cost sensitivity of “manufacture of medical equipment, precision instruments and optical instruments, watches and clocks manufacturing (C 33)” ranks third with the value of 0.464463. The decline of aggregate trade cost contributes to the effect of these industries export ranking the top three. The trade cost sensitivity of “food, beverage and tobacco manufacturing (C 15 T 16)” is lowest with the value of 0.118279. The trade cost sensitivity of “other non metallic mineral products manufacturing (C 26)” is in the reciprocal second with the value of 0.166794. The trade cost sensitivity of “wood products (C 20)” is in the reciprocal third with the value of 0.178894. The decline of aggregate trade cost contributes to the effect of these industries export in the reciprocal three.
