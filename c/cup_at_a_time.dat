50|$|Across New South Wales in the 1920s and 1930s teams {{played for}} a number of local and {{regional}} challenge cups. Southwest examples include the Alley and Prowse, Bancroft, Batsos, Farrar, O'Farrell, Garden of Roses, Jack Hore Memorial, Motor, Tulk and Weissel Gold cups. A successful team may hold half <b>a</b> dozen such <b>cups</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time.</b> The rise of reliable road transportation to nearby places lead to the demise of challenge cups and their replacement by regular competition schedules. The excellent rail system in the region, the large distances between towns, and the popularity of the Maher Cup, delayed the establishment of such competitions in the Southwest. When cars and buses became commonplace and roads sealed, people became less dependent on rail and regular competitions easier to arrange. Although permanent competition football was established in 1938 it still played second fiddle to the Maher Cup until the 1960s.|$|R

The paper analyses this trick, and compares it with a similar trick using three cups flipped in pairs. Several different methods of analysis are discussed, including a graphical analysis of the state space and a representation {{in terms of a}} matrix. These methods can also solve a more general problem about inverting n <b>cups</b> m <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> whose answer is surprisingly complicated...|$|R

Such perceptions have had an important impact on the city's footballing identities, tapping into the collective consciousness. In this vein, Atlético fans were probably the originators, and are the most frequent singers, of the song, sung {{to the tune of}} the Real Madrid anthem, [...] "Hala Madrid, hala Madrid, el equipo del gobierno, la vergüenza del país", [...] "Go Madrid, go Madrid, the government's team, the country's shame." ...|$|R

25|$|Gastric {{dilatation}} volvulus, {{also known}} as bloat, affects Airedale Terriers. The stomach can twist and block the esophagus, causing a buildup of gas and leading to cardiovascular collapse and death. Signs of bloat include gastric distress (stomach pain), futile attempts at vomiting, and increased salivation. Bloat usually occurs when the dog is exercised too soon after eating.

5000|$|Gillespie took a {{while to}} settle in, mainly because {{world-class}} defenders Mark Lawrenson and Alan Hansen were ahead of him, but eventually he got into the team, making his debut on 7 April 1984 in the 2-2 League Cup draw with Walsall at Anfield. He played 14 times in the 1985-86 season, scoring three league goals, as the Reds sealed the double of the league title and the FA Cup, beating their local rivals Everton into second place and also defeating them 3-1 in the final at Wembley. Gillespie did play enough games to warrant a league title winner's medal, but did not make the squad for the FA <b>Cup</b> final <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> when only one substitute was permitted.|$|R
5000|$|During {{the early}} Francoist period, it was Atlético {{that was the}} {{preferred}} team of the regime, being associated with the military airforce, until the regime's preferences moved towards Real Madrid in the 1950s. Franco sought to make political capital out of Real Madrid's European <b>Cup</b> titles <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> when Spain was internationally isolated; said one minister, [...] "Real Madrid are the best ambassadors we've ever had." [...] Thus, Atlético fans regularly chanted that Real was [...] "el equipo del gobierno, la vergüenza del país" [...] — the team of the government, the shame of the country — and allegedly adopted a more left-wing slant (tempered {{by the rise of}} ultras culture, and Rayo Vallecano's presence as the [...] "true" [...] leftist club in Madrid).|$|R

50|$|Georgamlis {{was born}} in Athens on 25 February 1962. He started his {{professional}} career in 1980 as a defender at AEK Athens having previously played for the youth academies of the club since 1974. He played for AEK until 1985, when he transferred to cross-town rivals Panathinaikos where he played until 1992. During his playing days at Panathinaikos he won three Greek Championships, four Greek Cups, one Greek Super <b>Cup</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> when the team also had successful runs in European Competitions. In 1992, he joined OFI offering his service to the club for two seasons. After a short stay at Kalamata he joined Iraklis (1995-1996) and later Ethnikos Piraeus before ending his career in 1999.|$|E
50|$|In 1996, Llansantffraid won the Welsh Cup and {{qualified}} {{for the first time}} for the European <b>Cup</b> Winners' <b>Cup.</b> <b>At</b> this <b>time</b> <b>a</b> local computer company, Total Network Solutions of Oswestry, arranged a £250,000 sponsorship deal which involved incorporating the company name into the club name. As Total Network Solutions Llansantffraid F.C. they met the Polish cup winners Ruch Chorzów and earned <b>a</b> 1-1 draw <b>at</b> home before losing 5-0 in Poland. Since then they have qualified for European competition several times. The club's European home games are generally played at either Newtown's or Wrexham's stadium as their old Recreation Ground was far below UEFA's standards (though for their 2003 meeting with Manchester City, they played their home game at the 72,000-seat Millennium Stadium in Cardiff).|$|R
40|$|Magic illusions {{provide the}} perceptual and {{cognitive}} scientist with a toolbox of experimental manipulations and testable hypotheses about {{the building blocks}} of conscious experience. Here we studied several sleight-of-hand manipulations in the performance of the classic “Cups and Balls” magic trick (where balls appear and disappear inside upside-down opaque cups). We examined a version inspired by the entertainment duo Penn & Teller, conducted with three opaque and subsequently with three transparent cups. Magician Teller used his right hand to load (i. e. introduce surreptitiously) a small ball inside each of two upside-down <b>cups,</b> one <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> while using his left hand to remove a different ball from the upside-down bottom of the <b>cup.</b> The sleight <b>at</b> the third <b>cup</b> involved one of six manipulations: (a)  standard maneuver, (b) standard maneuver without a third ball, (c) ball placed on the table, (d) ball lifted, (e) ball dropped to the floor, and (f) ball stuck to the cup. Seven subjects watched the videos of the performances while reporting, via button press, whenever balls were removed from the cups/table (button “ 1 ”) or placed inside the cups/on the table (button “ 2 ”). Subjects’ perception was more accurate with transparent than with opaque cups. Perceptual performance was worse for the conditions where the ball was placed on the table, or stuck to the cup, than for the standard maneuver. The condition in which the ball was lifted displaced the subjects’ gaze position the most, whereas the condition in which there was no ball caused the smallest gaze displacement. Training improved the subjects’ perceptual performance. Occlusion of the magician’s face did not affect the subjects’ perception, suggesting that gaze misdirection does not play a strong role in the Cups and Balls illusion. Our results have implications for how to optimize the performance of this classic magic trick, and for the types of hand and object motion that maximize magic misdirection...|$|R
40|$|Remote sensing {{combined}} with an ability to look deeper than the soil surface is currently high in demand. This study was conducted through scaling down the amount of soil data from a saline irrigation water experiment to see if one can still capture the essential soil salinity depth trends within the data, to a level that can enhance the ability of remote methods. A saline irrigation experiment with 6 water qualities was conducted for 8 years on 1. 2  ha of vineyard land near Robertson in the Western Cape Province of South Africa. Soil water was sampled at regular intervals at 5 depths between 0. 15 and 1. 2  m with suction <b>cup</b> lysimeters <b>at</b> <b>a</b> fixed <b>time</b> following each irrigation. Electrical conductivity of the soil water (ECsw) was determined after sampling. Data collected over the full 8 -year period were investigated for depth trends in ECsw, seeking trend lines with lowest polynomial order that were still significantly predict the salinity profile. At all treatment levels a first order polynomial equation, fitted to the salinity profiles, significantly predicted the salinity trends. The ECsw value at only two depths could therefore be used to calculate total salt accumulation and soil water quality below the root zone. The implication is that considerable value {{can be obtained from}} minimal measurements both in estimating salt accumulation in the soil profile and predicting water quality in return flow from saline irrigation.

5000|$|On Tuesday 6 November 1973 Reys {{became the}} first Aboriginal jockey to ride a winner in the Melbourne Cup. Gala Supreme {{carrying}} 7 st and Frank Reys won the Melbourne <b>Cup</b> <b>at</b> 9-1 in <b>a</b> <b>time</b> of 3.19.15. Reys and Gala Supreme then cemented their Melbourne Cup victory by winning the Herbert Power Handicap. At 41 years of age, Frank Reys was the oldest jockey with a ride in the 1973 Melbourne Cup. Gala Supreme had drawn the extreme outside barrier 24 and that clearly was the only stumbling block in Rey’s mind. Trainer Hutchins would later tell how he and Reys had numerous phone conversations after the barrier draw and discussed various riding tactics. Hutchins recalled he eventually left it up to Reys to ride the horse as he saw fit and Reys told him he’d [...] "have Gala Supreme one off the fence in 5th or 6th position going out of the straight". Coming from the outside barrier Reys rode {{just as he had}} planned. He had Gala Supreme one off the fence, not far behind the leaders, before passing the winning post on the first lap. As the horses turned for home, Reys became buried in the pack, just behind the leaders. Two hundred metres from the winning post Reys squeezed Gala Supreme through a gap, left by the favourite, who had drifted off a straight course. It was only a narrow win, but Gala Supreme had surged home to victory. In his recollections Hutchins continued [...] "and he went and did it - it was the perfect ride - he rode the race of his life for me." ...|$|R
40|$|The Castulo cup {{is one of}} {{the most}} common black glaze Attic forms in the Iberian Peninsula from the Atlantic coast to Ampurias. Their date in the Iberian Peninsula is some years later than that {{proposed}} for Athens. They did not appear till some years after the second half of the 5 th c. B. C. Their production probably continued until the first quarter of the 4 th century B. C. They are almost fixed in their form for about a century, but some differences in the outside decoration and the underside of the foot can be pointed out. Two main types are proposed for the second half of the 5 th century and the first quarter of the 4 th century B. C. The differences in date compared with those found at Athens can be explained as an adaptation of the workshops to the demands of Iberian customers. Athen's artisans continued making Castulo <b>cups</b> for export <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> when in Athens they did not use them any more, because the stemless cup had been replaced by the popular kantharoi and cup-kantharoi. La copa Cástulo es una de las formas áticas de barniz negro más abundante en los yacimientos peninsulares desde la costa atlántica hasta Ampurias. Su cronología es en la Península Ibérica algo posterior a la propuesta para Atenas. No aparecen hasta algo después de mediados del siglo V y probablemente se continúan fabricando hasta el primer cuarto del IV a. C. No experimentan durante casi un siglo de producción ninguna variación formal, sin embargo sí se pueden ver diferencias en el tratamiento de la decoración exterior y del fondo externo. Se proponen aquí fundamentalmente dos tipos de la segunda mitad del siglo V y primer cuarto del IV a. C. La diferencia cronológica con las halladas en Atenas se explica como una adaptación de los talleres áticos a la demanda de los clientes ibéricos. Los artesanos atenienses continúan fabricando copas Cástulo para la exportación cuando en Atenas se han dejado ya de utilizar las copas de pie bajo al ser sustituidas por una forma muy popular en Atenas y que sin embargo en muchos yacimientos ibéricos peninsulares casi no aparece: los cántaros...|$|R
