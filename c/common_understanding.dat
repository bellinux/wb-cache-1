5|$|The {{experience}} of being entertained {{has come to be}} strongly associated with amusement, so that one <b>common</b> <b>understanding</b> of the idea is fun and laughter, although many entertainments have a serious purpose. This may be the case in the various forms of ceremony, celebration, religious festival, or satire for example. Hence, there is the possibility that what appears as entertainment may also be a means of achieving insight or intellectual growth.|$|E
5|$|Contrary to the <b>common</b> <b>understanding,</b> the {{crossing}} of the Andes {{was not the first}} time that a military expedition crossed the mountain range. The difference from previous operations was the size of the army, and that it had to be ready for combat right after {{the crossing}}. The army was divided in six columns, each taking a different path. Colonel Francisco Zelada in La Rioja took the Come-Caballos pass towards Copiapó. Juan Manuel Cabot, in San Juan, moved to Coquimbo. Ramón Freire and José León Lemos led two columns in the south. The bulk of the armies left from Mendoza. San Martín, O'Higgins and Soler led a column across the Los Patos pass, and Juan Gregorio de Las Heras another one across the Uspallata Pass.|$|E
5|$|The most {{masculine}} {{women were}} not necessarily common, though they were visible so they tended to attract women interested in finding other lesbians. Women had to broach the subject about their interest in other women carefully, sometimes taking days to develop a <b>common</b> <b>understanding</b> without asking or stating anything outright. Women who did not enter the military were aggressively called upon to take industrial jobs left by men, {{in order to continue}} national productivity. The increased mobility, sophistication, and independence of many women during and after the war made it possible for women to live without husbands, something {{that would not have been}} feasible under different economic and social circumstances, further shaping lesbian networks and environments.|$|E

40|$|Three {{academic}} women {{joined to}} write this piece to explore individual doctoral program experiences and to establish <b>common</b> <b>understandings.</b> They collectively analyzed their experiences using the conceptual approach of doctoral program performances and journeys. This case study shares their experiences within the conceptual approach through emerging themes. The <b>common</b> <b>understandings</b> developed herein about doctoral education based on these themes are also shared. The broader contributions of the three women’s work are two-fold. First, the entire case study provides a way to view, discuss, and consider women’s doctoral education pluralistically. Secondly, perhaps readers of this piece will recognize that individual and <b>common</b> <b>understandings</b> with others are a way to develop professional knowledge as academics. Further, readers of this piece {{might be able to}} relate more deeply to their own and others’ unique doctoral program experiences through the lens of performances or journeys. Some of these connections might be based on the overarching framework, while others might be specific to the shared women’s experience...|$|R

25|$|The {{bilateral}} {{interaction was}} possible because, in many respects, Brazil and Argentina shared a <b>common</b> <b>understanding</b> {{of the global}} non-proliferation regime as a top-down imposition of the major nuclear powers {{at the expense of}} weaker nations.

25|$|This distinguishes {{bullying}} from isolated behaviours {{and other}} forms of job stress and allows the term workplace bullying to be applied in various contexts and to behaviours that meet these characteristics. Many observers agree that bullying is often a repetitive behaviour. However, some experts who have dealt with a great many people who report abuse also categorize some once-only events as bullying, for example with cases where there appear to be severe sequelae. Expanding the <b>common</b> <b>understanding</b> of bullying to include single, severe episodes also parallels the legal definitions of sexual harassment in the US.|$|E
25|$|All the congregations were {{established}} as independent denominations {{under the protection}} that the Dissenter Act provided, {{even if they could}} have as few as six members. Following a movement inspired by the United States, there was a trend towards weak congregationalism. This established a <b>common</b> <b>understanding</b> of the legal and organizational independence of each congregation, while retaining the need for a national administrative and theological coordination. By the early 1870s the congregations in Skien, Bergen, Trondheim and Tromsø had largely taken on regional responsibilities and covered areas far exceeding the city limits.|$|E
25|$|Western {{churches have}} arrived at the {{position}} that, although the Filioque is doctrinally sound, {{the way that it}} was inserted into the Nicene Creed has created an unnecessary obstacle to ecumenical dialogue.

This accommodation on the part of Western Churches has the objective of allowing both East and West to once again to share a <b>common</b> <b>understanding</b> of the Creed as the traditional and fundamental statement of the Christian faith.|$|E

Indeed, Heckscher–Ohlin theory claims that the state of factor endowments of each country (or each region) determines the production of each country (respectively of each region) but Bernstein and Weinstein found that the factor endowments have little predictive power. The factor-endowments-driven model (FED model) has errors much greater than the HOV model.|$|E

In 1912 he replaced Apollinaire at L'Intransigeant and simultaneously was hired by Louis Vauxcelles to write in Gil Blas. In his forward for this exhibition⎯his first writing on Cubism⎯Raynal paints the artistic avant-garde as parallel to scientists whose 'very data will turn the <b>common</b> <b>understanding</b> and ordinary sensibilities upside down'. Science and visual arts evolved together leading to 'a more positivistic age'. Artists, just as scientists, were able to capture the 'essence of things'. The goal or art, writes Raynal, is not the 'slavish imitation of nature', but its 'interpretation in accordance with the artist's intellectual capacity'.|$|E
