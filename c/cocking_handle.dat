5|$|The MP 40 submachine {{guns are}} open-bolt, blowback-operated {{automatic}} arms. The only mode of fire was fully automatic, but {{the relatively low}} rate of fire enabled single shots with controlled trigger pulls. The bolt features a telescoping return spring guide {{which serves as a}} pneumatic recoil buffer. The <b>cocking</b> <b>handle</b> was permanently attached to the bolt on early MP 38s, but on late production MP 38s and MP 40s, the bolt handle was made as a separate part. It also served as a safety by pushing the head of handle into one of two separate notches above the main opening; this action locked the bolt either in the cocked (rear) or uncocked (forward) position. The absence of this feature on early MP 38s resulted in field expedients such as leather harnesses with a small loop, used to hold the bolt in forward position.|$|E
25|$|The M3's <b>cocking</b> <b>handle</b> {{assembly}} {{was located}} {{on the right-hand side}} of the receiver on the ejector housing, just forward and above the trigger, and consisted of nine parts. As the handle is pulled to the rear, a pawl rises to engage a notch {{in the bottom of the}} bolt, pushing the bolt to the rear until it locked back on the sear.|$|E
25|$|In 1940 Commonwealth {{troops in}} Egypt and North Africa were issued {{commercial}} model Lend-Lease Colt- and Savage-manufactured M1928s. Section leaders carried them instead of pistols or rifles. Many of the Colt models had French-language manuals packed {{with them as}} they had been abruptly diverted to England after the fall of France. They soon discovered that the weapon was prone to jamming due to sand. To fix this, the armorers removed the Blish Lock and replaced it with a hex bolt to keep the <b>cocking</b> <b>handle</b> and bolt together. The 20-round Type XX magazines had their peep-holes welded shut to keep sand out and the 50-round Type L drums were discontinued. Ammunition was scarce as it was either in small lots of Lend-Lease commercial ammo or obtained from adjacent American troops. It was later replaced by the 9mm Sten gun and Lanchester SMG.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cocking</b> <b>handles</b> can be {{reciprocating}} or non-reciprocating. The {{advantage of}} the former is that it gives the user complete control over {{the movement of the}} bolt and bolt carrier, and it enables great force to be used to chamber or extract difficult or ruptured cartridges. However it adds an extra, fast-moving part {{on the outside of the}} gun and may limit the way the gun is handled.|$|R
50|$|H&K offers {{dedicated}} training {{variants of}} these weapons, designated MP5A4PT and MP5A5PT (PT—Plastic Training), modified {{to fire a}} plastic 9×19mm PT training cartridge produced by Dynamit Nobel of Germany. These weapons operate like the standard MP5 but have a floating chamber and both rollers have been omitted from the bolt to function properly when firing the lighter plastic projectiles. To help identify these weapons blue dots were painted on their <b>cocking</b> <b>handles</b> and additional lettering provided. The PT variant can be configured with various buttstocks and trigger groups and was developed for the West German Police and Border Guard.|$|R
5000|$|Lage Manufacturing makes a variant, called [...] "MAX" [...] uppers. The {{company is}} based in Chandler, Arizona. The [...] "MAX" [...] upper can reduce the {{original}} rate of fire to about 600 RPM (.45 ACP) and 700 RPM (9×19mm). The upper adds a picatinny optic rail, a side <b>cocking</b> charging <b>handle,</b> and a forend.|$|R
2500|$|The M3 {{operating}} sequence is as follows: the bolt is cocked {{to the rear}} using the <b>cocking</b> <b>handle</b> located {{on the right side}} of the ejector housing. When the trigger is pulled, the bolt is driven forward by the recoil springs, stripping a round from the feed lips of the magazine and guiding the round into the chamber. The bolt then continues forward and the firing pin strikes the cartridge primer, igniting the round, resulting in a high-pressure impulse, forcing the bolt back against the resistance of the recoil springs and the inertial mass of the bolt. By the time the bolt and empty casing have moved far enough to the rear to open the chamber, the bullet has left the barrel and pressure in the barrel has dropped to a safe level. The M3's comparatively low cyclic rate was a function of the relatively low pressure generated by the [...]45 ACP round, a heavy bolt, and recoil springs with a lighter-than-normal compression rate.|$|E
2500|$|HK {{included}} several design {{features that are}} essential in modern military firearms. For example, the bolt locks back after the last round is spent (this can be deactivated), and at {{the front end of}} the trigger guard there is a bolt catch button. The <b>cocking</b> <b>handle</b> can be switched from either end, folds in, and unfolds from a spring so the shooter need not unfold it by hand [...] before firing. Another feature of it is that it doubles as the forward assist, which is used in the instance that the spent cartridge ejected but the next one did not properly extract and go into battery. In addition, the ejection port has a brass deflector to mitigate the amount of casings that may strike the face of left-handed operators. Instead of a dust cover which has the need to be flipped back up when the gun isn't in use, the bolt acts as the seal from dirt.|$|E
2500|$|Initially, M3 submachine guns {{returned}} for repair were not upgraded to the M3A1 standard, but merely inspected {{to ensure they}} had the improved M3 housing assembly and magazine release shield. [...] During the Korean War, existing M3 guns in service were converted to the improved M3A1 configuration using additional new production parts. [...] During the conversion, armorers frequently removed the M3 <b>cocking</b> <b>handle,</b> leaving {{the rest of the}} now-redundant cocking mechanism inside the subframe. Overall, the M3A1 was seen by most soldiers and Ordnance technicians as an improvement over the M3. However, complaints of accidental discharge continued to occur even as late as the Korean War. These incidents were sometimes caused by dropping the weapon on a hard surface with an impact sufficient to knock open the ejection port cover and propel the bolt backwards (but not enough to catch the sear). [...] The return springs would then propel the bolt forward to pick up a cartridge from the magazine and carry it into the chamber, where the bolt's fixed firing pin struck the primer upon contact.|$|E
25|$|Technically 7,62 ItKk/31 VKT is a Maxim {{machine gun}} {{that has been}} {{modified}} for {{a higher rate of}} fire with an accelerator and the use of 250-round disintegrating metallic belts (instead of canvas belts). With these modifications the weapon has a rate of fire of 900 rounds per minute for each gun. The weapon is also air-cooled instead of water-cooled, and has a barrel jacket closely resembling the one in Lahti-Saloranta M/26 light machine gun. At barrel ends are conical flash suppressors. In the twin anti-aircraft machine gun configuration two guns are connected side by side with belt boxes {{on both sides of the}} pair and square boxes under both guns for empty shells and belt links. Both guns have <b>cocking</b> <b>handles</b> on the right side and recoil springs on the left; the left hand gun has a modified feed system to allow the belt run from left.|$|R
5000|$|The gunner {{was forced}} to assume a fetal {{position}} within the turret with his back and head against the rear wall, his hips at the bottom, and his legs held in mid-air by two footrests on the front wall. This left him positioned with his eyes roughly level with the pair of light-barrel Browning AN/M2 [...]50 caliber machine guns which extended through the entire turret, located {{to either side of}} the gunner. The <b>cocking</b> <b>handles</b> were located too close to the gunner to be operated easily, so a cable was attached to the handle through pulleys to a handle near the front of the turret. Another factor was that not all stoppages could be corrected by charging (cocking) the guns. In many cases, when a stoppage occurred, it was necessary for the gunner to [...] "reload" [...] the gun, which required access to the firing chamber of the guns. Access was severely restricted by the guns' location in the small turret. Normally, the gunner accessed the firing chamber by releasing a latch and raising the cover to a position perpendicular to the gun but this was not possible in the ball turret. To remedy that, {{the front end of the}} cover was [...] "slotted". The gunner released the latch and removed the cover which allowed space to clear the action. Small ammunition boxes rested on the top of the turret and additional ammunition belts fed the turret by means of a chute system. A reflector sight was hung from the top of the turret, positioned roughly between the gunner's feet.|$|R
50|$|The 6.5mm bullet {{was found}} to be too light for {{long-range}} fire support and anti-aircraft use, so in 1932 the heavier 8×63mm patron m/32 cartridge was developed. As this resulted in a heavier recoil, a spring-loaded cradle replaced the backplate with a heavily spring-loaded buffer that acted {{as an extension of the}} standard Browning recoil buffer. This also replaced the regular spade-grips with the ones integrated in the cradle. The cradle, now part of the weapon, would then be hooked onto a tripod m/36. This tripod featured, beside a 5×25 power optical sight, advanced elevation- and traverse controls. The unprecedented recoil control and steadiness of the tripod made Dolf Goldsmith remark that this arrangement “was undoubtedly the most accurate long-range rifle-caliber machine gun ever made”. For anti-air purposes, a double cradle was made to hold a matching pair of m/36. The right gun, lacking sights altogether, was fed from the right, while the left gun, with iron sights complemented with an AA sight ring, was fed from left. The <b>cocking</b> <b>handles</b> were located between the guns, while safety and triggers were individual for left and right. The special AA tripod had elongated legs and chains to either secure the tripod or hang weights on it for extra stability. These double cradles were also used as standard defense, mounted on a ring on the cab roof, on terrain vehicles and armored troop carriers like Terrängbil m/42 KP. The latter was used with good effect in the Congo crisis in the early 1960s. Until 1966, the m/14-29 and m/36 machine guns could use both the 6.5mm and the 8mm ammunition. Converting between the two was a matter of exchanging barrel, cartridge stop and bolt.|$|R
2500|$|In July, {{the second}} of two prototypes was sent to France for service trials, which were successful, aircrew being {{generally}} quite favourably impressed; and by September production was well under way. [...] The Vickers-Challenger interrupter gear and the Scarff ring were still in short supply, being required for the Sopwith 1½ Strutter and other types, and a few early R.E.8s were built with a pillar mounting for the observer’s gun as an interim measure. An alternative to the pilot's synchronised Vickers had been designed, consisting of a fixed Lewis gun with deflector plates fitted to the propeller, although this was never used, a Vickers gun for the pilot being mounted {{on the port side}} of the fuselage in a similar position to that on the B.E.12, at first synchronised by the Vickers-Challenger gear and then by the improved Constantinesco hydraulic gear. Photographs of this armament installation make it clear that the <b>cocking</b> <b>handle</b> of the Vickers gun was in easy reach of the pilot and that a normal Aldis sight was mounted in the pilot's windscreen, giving the lie to statements that the forward firing gun could not be sighted properly due to its position.|$|E
2500|$|When fired, {{a portion}} of the {{propellant}} gases are evacuated into the gas cylinder through a [...] port, drilled at a 30° angle in the barrel, and a channel in the gas block. The high-pressure gases drive the piston rod (which is attached to the bolt carrier) rearward. During this rearward movement, a cam slot machined into the bolt carrier engages a cam pin on the bolt and rotates the bolt, unlocking the action. The arrangement of parts on the bolt carrier assembly provides for a degree of free travel, allowing gas pressure in the barrel to drop to a safe level before unlocking. To the immediate rear of the chrome-plated piston head is a notched ring which provides a reduced bearing surface and alleviates excess gas build-up. As the bolt carrier travels back, it compresses the return spring guided in a hollowed section of the bolt carrier and the return energy contained in the spring drives the moving assembly back forward, stripping a new round from the magazine and locking the action. The <b>cocking</b> <b>handle</b> is attached to the bolt carrier {{on the right side of}} the receiver and reciprocates with each shot; the handle is bent upwards allowing for operation with the left hand while the shooting hand remains on the pistol grip.|$|E
50|$|The <b>cocking</b> <b>handle</b> {{is removed}} from the bolt carrier and a new <b>cocking</b> <b>handle</b> {{arrangement}} is placed {{on the left side of}} the forearm.|$|E
500|$|The {{poor design}} of the breech allowed the Type 94 Nambu to be fired unintentionally. The sear bar on the Type 94 Nambu {{converts}} the forward pull of the trigger into a lateral movement that frees the hammer. Because the sear bar is {{on the outside of}} the pistol, it could be jarred loose during engagement if the pistol was <b>cocked</b> and <b>handled</b> carelessly. The forward end of the [...] sear bar would need to be depressed approximately [...] 2mm to cause the weapon to fire. The ability to fire the Type 94 without pulling the trigger gave rise to war stories of Japanese soldiers surrendering, only to fire the pistol, earning the pistol monikers such as the [...] "suicide special" [...] and the [...] "surrender pistol". These stories are widely discredited because of the difficulty to fire the weapon by squeezing the sear bar. If the safety is engaged on the Type 94 it is impossible for the weapon to discharge unintentionally.|$|R
5000|$|In 1875, Hurt {{moved to}} Atlanta, where he {{organized}} the Atlanta Building and Loan Association, which {{he ran for}} thirty-two years. He also co-founded the Trust Company of Georgia - now part of Suntrust - and, starting in 1895, was its president for nine years. In 1882, he organized the East Atlanta Land Company, where he designed and developed Inman Park, a residential area connected to the city center by his Atlanta and Edgewood Street Railway Company, which opened along Edgewood Avenue in 1886. It was Atlanta's first electric streetcar line, {{and it was the}} first profitable electric line in America. In 1880, he filed what would be [...] for an interesting thermal water valve. Then in 1887, he filed No. 374,188 for a new style of valve <b>cock</b> for faucets <b>handling</b> water under pressure.|$|R
5000|$|On {{firearms}} {{where the}} <b>cocking</b> <b>handle</b> is permanently {{connected to the}} bolt or bolt carrier, a dedicated device is not necessary as the bolt can be assisted forwards by simply pushing or tapping the <b>cocking</b> <b>handle</b> forwards.|$|E

50|$|The rifle {{does not}} have a hold-open device; the bolt does not stay back after the last round is fired. The <b>cocking</b> <b>handle</b> is placed {{on the left side of}} the receiver, just above the handguard, and can be {{operated}} by left-handed shooters. There are no access points for the possible ingress of dirt or debris; the <b>cocking</b> <b>handle</b> slot is sealed.|$|E
50|$|The FNC is a {{selective}} fire weapon {{that uses a}} gas-operated long-stroke piston system and a rotating bolt locking mechanism equipped with two locking lugs that engage corresponding recesses in the barrel extension. The bolt is rotated and unlocked by {{the interaction of the}} bolt's cam pin with a camming guide contained in the bolt carrier. Overall, the mechanism strongly resembles that of Kalashnikov rifles, but adapted to more advanced design and production methods. The rear part of the <b>cocking</b> <b>handle</b> slot, cut in the upper receiver for the <b>cocking</b> <b>handle,</b> is covered by a spring-loaded cover which automatically opens by the handle when it goes back and automatically closes the opening when the <b>cocking</b> <b>handle</b> returns forward.|$|E
50|$|The X95 can {{be easily}} {{distinguished}} from the TAR-21 (as well as from CTAR-21, STAR-21, and GTAR-21) by {{the location of the}} <b>cocking</b> <b>handle.</b> An X95 <b>cocking</b> <b>handle</b> is closer to the pistol grip, while a TAR-21 <b>cocking</b> <b>handle</b> is closer to the muzzle. The stock was also slightly redesigned.With the use of a relatively simple conversion kit, the X95 can be converted from a 5.56 mm assault rifle to a 9 mm submachine gun loaded with 20, 25, and 32-round magazines. A suppressor can also be added to the weapon, as part of the 9 mm conversion kit. There is also a variant with an integrated grenade launcher, the IWI GL 40.|$|E

50|$|Before gassing, cock {{the marker}} by pulling back the <b>cocking</b> <b>handle</b> (located {{near the front}} of the marker {{on the left side of}} the receiver). This pulls back the front and rear bolts and allows access to chamber while also {{ensuring}} that the valve is not being depressed by the rear bolt when the propellant supply is screwed in, which would result in a leak. A click should be heard. Release the <b>cocking</b> <b>handle.</b>|$|E
50|$|The MP35 was a {{blowback}} operated, selective fire SMG which {{fired from}} an open bolt. The weapon featured a non-reciprocating <b>cocking</b> <b>handle</b> placed {{at the rear of}} the receiver, which was operated in a similar fashion to bolt-action on a Mauser rifle. This involved the weapon carrier to manually pull the handle up, pull backwards, push forwards and lock back down. When the gun was then fired the <b>cocking</b> <b>handle</b> remained stationary.|$|E

50|$|The non-reciprocating <b>cocking</b> <b>handle</b> {{is located}} above the {{handguard}} and protrudes from the <b>cocking</b> <b>handle</b> tube at approximately a 45° angle. This rigid control {{is attached to}} a tubular piece within the cocking lever housing called the cocking lever support, which in turn, makes contact with the forward extension of the bolt group. It is not however connected to the bolt carrier and therefore cannot be used as a forward assist to fully seat the bolt group. The <b>cocking</b> <b>handle</b> is held in a forward position by a spring detent located in {{the front end of the}} cocking lever support which engages in the cocking lever housing. The lever is locked back by pulling it fully to the rear and rotating it slightly clockwise where it can be hooked into an indent in the cocking lever tube.|$|E

50|$|The {{charging}} handle is still placed to one side, now favouring right-handed operators but {{making it difficult}} to work the <b>cocking</b> <b>handle</b> with the right hand while holding the weapon left-handed.|$|E
5000|$|The m/45 has no safety switch. Instead the m/45 {{is put in}} [...] "safe" [...] by sliding the <b>cocking</b> <b>handle</b> into a short side-slot {{above the}} main (lock) slot. In the example US Army photograph, this short safety side-slot is visible behind the rear L-sight. This design feature results in a {{somewhat}} longer time to ready the weapon for firing, because the soldier must remove his right hand from the pistol grip and trigger, as if operating a bolt-action rifle. When the m/45 is unloaded the bolt is locked {{in place in the}} bolt-forward position by pushing the <b>cocking</b> <b>handle</b> inwards, engaging a hole in the lower left receiver wall.|$|E
50|$|The FMK-3 is comparable, to the Heckler & Koch MP-5 in {{ergonomics}} (IE: selector switch, {{position of}} <b>cocking</b> <b>handle,</b> stock section) although {{it uses a}} grip inserted magazine, and performance (IE: firing from closed bolt, well balanced).|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} {{to being able to}} customize the Cx4 with accessories, it is also able to switch the safety, <b>cocking</b> <b>handle,</b> ejection port, and magazine release to {{the left side of the}} weapon to accommodate left-handed shooters.|$|E
50|$|Pull {{back on the}} <b>cocking</b> <b>handle</b> {{located on}} the {{opposite}} side of the marker from the cyclone feeder (this is only required once each time a propellant bottle is connected). Press the manual-feed button to force a paintball into the chamber.|$|E
50|$|These devices vary {{significantly}} between firearms but {{may occur}} {{in the form of}} a small protrusion or hook from the side of the bolt, a pumped slide or lever. The slide in a pistol performs similar actions as a <b>cocking</b> <b>handle.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>cocking</b> <b>handle</b> is on {{the left}} side of the upper {{receiver}} incorporated with a dust cover. The front sights are fixed and rear sights have an adjustment knob for windage. The upper receiver has a Picatinny rail installed allowing telescopic and red dot sights to be used.|$|E
