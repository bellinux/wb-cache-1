5|$|Piers Gaveston's {{father was}} Arnaud de Gabaston, a Gascon knight {{in the service}} of Gaston VII of Béarn. Gabaston had come into a {{substantial}} amount of land in Gascony through his marriage to Claramonde de Marsan, who was <b>co-heir</b> with her brother of the great landowner Arnaud-Guillaume de Marsan. Through the possessions of his wife, Gabaston also became a vassal of the King of England, in the King's capacity of Duke of Aquitaine. His service to Edward I of England stretched {{over a long period of}} time, starting in the Welsh Wars of 1282–83, in which he participated with a substantial contingent. Sometime before 4 February 1287, Claramonde died, and for the rest of his life Gabaston struggled to retain his wife's inheritance from rival claims by relatives and neighbours. Because of this, he became financially dependent on the English king, and was continuously in his service. He was used as a hostage by Edward twice: first in 1288 to Aragon, secondly in 1294 to the French king, when he managed to escape and flee to England in 1297. After returning home, he was back in England in 1300, where he served with Edward I in the Scottish Wars. He died at some point before 18 May 1302.|$|E
5|$|The {{property}} {{remained in}} the Mowbray family until the death of Anne de Mowbray, 8th Countess of Norfolk (the child bride of Richard of Shrewsbury, 1st Duke of York) in 1481. Anne's estate was divided between John Howard, 1st Duke of Norfolk and William de Berkeley, 1st Marquess of Berkeley, of whom the latter took possession of Caludon Castle. It lay derelict from shortly after Mowbray's banishment until the late 16th century (circa 1580), when it was rebuilt by Henry Berkeley, 7th Baron Berkeley {{in the style of}} a mansion. A large banqueting hall was added later by Elizabeth (née Stanhope), wife of George Berkeley, 8th Baron Berkeley. The latter kept the house until 1632, when he sold it to Sir Thomas Morgan, 1st Baronet. It passed from Morgan to Sir John Preston through the latter's marriage to Morgan's daughter and <b>co-heir,</b> Jane. The house was badly damaged in 1662 when King Charles II took revenge on Coventry for its heavily parliamentarian sympathies in the English Civil War. Their son, Sir Thomas Preston, inherited the estate, and upon his death in 1709 it passed to his daughter, Anne and her husband, Hugh Clifford, 2nd Baron Clifford of Chudleigh. The Cliffords retained the property, using the ruins of the castle to build a large farmhouse in 1800, until 1815, when the estate was divided up and much of it sold. The estate was then held by various private owners until after the First World War, when the Coventry Corporation purchased much of it and developed the area into suburban housing estates.|$|E

25|$|Baldwin died without heirs in 1118, {{during a}} {{campaign}} against Egypt, and the kingdom was offered to his brother Eustace III of Boulogne, who had accompanied Baldwin and Godfrey on the crusade. Eustace was uninterested, and instead the crown passed to Baldwin's relative, probably a cousin, Baldwin of Le Bourg, who had previously succeeded him in Edessa. Baldwin II was an able ruler, and he too successfully defended against Fatimid and Seljuk invasions. Although Antioch was severely weakened after the Battle of Ager Sanguinis in 1119, and Baldwin himself was held captive by the emir of Aleppo from 1122–1124, Baldwin led the crusader states to victory at the Battle of Azaz in 1125. His reign saw {{the establishment of the}} first military orders, the Knights Hospitaller and the Knights Templar; the earliest surviving written laws of the kingdom, compiled at the Council of Nablus in 1120; and the first commercial treaty with the Republic of Venice, the Pactum Warmundi, in 1124. The increase of naval and military support from Venice led to the capture of Tyre that year. The influence of Jerusalem was further extended over Edessa and Antioch, where Baldwin II acted as regent when their own leaders were killed in battle, although there were regency governments in Jerusalem as well during Baldwin's captivity. Baldwin was married to the Armenian noblewoman Morphia of Melitene, and had four daughters: Hodierna and Alice, who married into the families of the Count of Tripoli and Prince of Antioch; Ioveta, who became an influential abbess; and the eldest, Melisende, who was his heir and succeeded him upon his death in 1131, with her husband Fulk V of Anjou as king-consort.

500|$|In December 1908 Eva, then 41, married Houston Stewart Chamberlain, a British-born {{historian}} who had adopted as his personal creed a fanatical form of German nationalism based on principles of extreme {{racial and cultural}} purity. He had known Cosima since 1888, though his affinity with Wagner extended back to 1882, when he had attended the premiere of Parsifal. He had successively courted Blandina and then Isolde, before settling on Eva. Cosima had considerable empathy with his theories; according to Carr [...] "she came to love him as her son—perhaps even more". Chamberlain became the dominant figure within the Wagner circle, and was {{largely responsible for the}} increasing alienation of the Beidlers. Cosima may have been unaware of Isolde's attempts at rapprochement, because Eva and Chamberlain withheld Isolde's letters. In 1913 Isolde was effectively disinherited when she sought to confirm her rights as a <b>co-heir</b> to the considerable Wagner fortunes in a court case, which she lost.

Afterward he supposedly advised Edward to move against his protector, because [...] "It was better that they should eat the dog than that the dog should eat them". On 19 October 1330, while Mortimer and Isabella were entrenched in Nottingham Castle, the constable of the castle showed Montagu a secret entrance through an underground tunnel. Along with William de Bohun, Robert Ufford, and John Neville and others, he entered the castle, where he met up with the king. A short brawl followed before Mortimer was captured. The queen stormed into the chamber shouting [...] "Good son, have pity on noble Mortimer". Edward did not obey his mother's wishes, and {{a few weeks later}} Mortimer was executed for treason in London. As a reward for his part in the coup, Montagu was given lands worth £1000, including the Welsh lordship of Denbigh that had belonged to Mortimer.

500|$|In 1457, Neville was {{appointed}} Chamberlain of the Exchequer, {{along with a}} <b>co-heir</b> of Ralph, Lord Cromwell. Later that year his father and brother appointed Thomas their deputy on the West March, where they were joint Wardens. For this he received a salary of 500 marks- which, R.L. Storey points out, was [...] "less {{than a quarter of}} their official salary."' A few months later, he stood as surety for his uncle William, Lord Fauconberg's good behaviour (whom Michael Hicks speculates may have been involved in piracy at this time). By 1459 the domestic political situation had descended into outright civil war; when the earl of Salisbury marched south from his castle at Middleham in September to join up with the duke of York at Ludlow, Thomas marched with him in a 5,000-strong army. On 23 September 1459, they encountered a larger royal force at Blore Heath, which Salisbury defeated, killing its leader, James Tuchet, 5th Baron Audley. Thomas and John, though, were somehow captured near Tarporley, Cheshire, the next day. Hicks has suggested that this was due to their being wounded in battle and sent home; Rosemary Horrox on the other hand posits that they ventured too far from the main army in pursuit of fleeing Lancastrians. Attainted in the Parliament of Devils the next month, they were imprisoned in Chester Castle and not released until their brother Warwick was victorious at the Battle of Northampton in June 1460. [...] Thomas Neville {{was appointed}}, jointly with his father, to Keeper of the Royal Mews as part of the Nevilles' policy of filling the positions of political importance with their own sympathisers He was immediately, on his release, appointed to commissions to arrest and imprison any who disturbed the peace, and received grants of Duchy of Lancaster estates at the same time. [...] When the duke of York joined them and claimed the throne in October 1460, the Nevilles were as set against his claim as every other member of the nobility present for the coming parliament. Thomas Neville appears to have been fundamental to Salisbury's resistance to York's claims: possibly with Warwick, it was certainly Thomas who met York at Westminster Palace (where he had evicted the King from his lodgings), and informed the duke that his position was untenable [...] "to both lords and people"; According to P.A. Johnson, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Bourchier refused to confront the duke of York, so on two occasions [...] "Thomas Neville was sent instead." [...] Two days later, on 13 October 1460, he again went to York: [...] "whatever was then said is unknown, but Neville's mandate must have been both blunt and bluntly delivered."

Sitting on a white stepped base, and attached to a white back plate which runs to the entablature, is a pedestal. The pedestal’s central panel contains inscriptions within a white bolection mould. Set back on either side are inset white oblong raised panels—the top has a projected moulding following the plinth’s horizontal facets. Above is an aedicule of inscriptions on a black field with wide white bolection mould surround, contained between a column each side of black shaft, and white base, stylobate and ionic capital, beneath the entablature.
