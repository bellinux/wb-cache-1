40|$|By {{taking the}} low {{frequency}} limit of multiple-scattering theory, we obtain the dynamic effective mass density of fluid-solid composites with a two-dimensional rectangular lattice structure. The anisotropic mass density {{can be described}} by an angle-dependent dipole solution, to the leading-order of solid concentration. The angular dependence vanishes for the square lattice, but at high solid concentrations there is a structure-dependent factor {{that contributes to the}} leading-order solution. In all <b>cases,</b> <b>Wood's</b> formula is found to be accurately valid for the effective bulk modulus, independent of the structures. Numerical evaluations from the solutions are shown to be in excellent agreement with finite-element simulations. (c) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

5000|$|Aubrey's {{relationship}} with Wood {{was to become}} increasingly fraught. Aubrey asked Wood to be [...] "my index expurgatorius": {{a reference to the}} Church's list of banned books, which Wood seems to have taken not as a warning, but as a licence to simply extract pages of notes to paste into his own proofs. In 1692, Aubrey complained bitterly that Wood had mutilated forty pages of his manuscript, perhaps for fear of a libel <b>case.</b> <b>Wood</b> was eventually prosecuted for insinuations against the judicial integrity of the school of Clarendon. One of the two statements called in question was founded on information provided by Aubrey and this may explain the estrangement between the two antiquaries and the ungrateful account that Wood gives of Aubrey's character. It is now famous: [...] "a shiftless person, roving and magotie-headed, and sometimes little better than crased. And being exceedingly credulous, would stuff his many letters sent to A. W. with folliries and misinformations, which would sometimes guid him into the paths of errour".|$|E
5000|$|In 1999, Beretta USA offered 2000 {{special edition}} kits to {{accompany}} the 8045F Cougar. Accompanying the basic 8045F was a kit consisting of a special edition case, lapel pin and charcoal laminate grips with inlaid cougar medallions. Several kits were sold {{but the number of}} kits is unconfirmed. With 2000 units initially projected, it is believed the total number sold to be far less than that. There is no specific serial number run for these as the kits were sold with the standard pistol as they were ordered. Typically, the Cat Pak cougars had a date code of BM for 1999. 8045 Cat Pak pistols are listed as such in Beretta USA records but it is unclear if all kits had that code since some were sold separately (did not include the pistol). The pistol comes in the 8045F model which is a double/single-action-type pistol.

Cross sections of samples of Scots pine and Norway spruce which had been exposed outdoors have been prepared {{with the help of}} an Excimer laser (wavelength 248 nm) for study in a microscope. UV-laser ablation has been found to be a suitable method of preparation for wood when it is desired to obtain thin sections with little influence on the material, and particularly when dealing with brittle materials, e. g. archaeological wood, biologically-attacked wood or, as in this <b>case,</b> <b>wood</b> which has been exposed outdoors...|$|E

The aim {{of this paper is}} to evaluate and rank energy sources available for a case of district heating system in Vancouver, Canada, based on multiple criteria and the view points of different stakeholders, and to show how communication would affect the ranking of alternatives. The available energy sources are natural gas, biomass (wood pellets), sewer heat, and geothermal heat. The evaluation criteria include GHG emissions, particulate matter emissions, maturity of technology, traffic load, and local source. In order to rank the energy options the PROMETHEE method is used. In this paper, two different scenarios were developed to indicate how the communication between the stakeholders would affect their preferences about criteria weights and would change the ranking of alternatives. The result of this study shows that without communication the best energy source for the considered district energy system is different for different stakeholders. While, addressing concerns through efficient communication would result in a general consensus. In this <b>case,</b> <b>wood</b> pellet is the best energy alternative for all the stakeholders.

40|$|Aim {{of study}} : There {{is a lack}} of {{empirical}} research that deals with sustainable forest management in Mediterranean regions, among the most vulnerable ecosystems. The main purpose of this work is to define the strategic criteria and objectives for sustainable forest management and aggregate the preferences of stakeholders in a Mediterranean region, using AHP and Goal Programming. Area of study : Valencian Community (Spain). Material and Methods : Firstly, we identified forest stakeholders and structured a decision hierarchy. Then a workshop was carried out to test and validate the proposed criteria and objectives, as well as a survey to determine social preferences. Secondly, another survey was conducted amongst experts to prioritize action plans. Main results : Stakeholders’ preferences gave the greatest importance to the environmental criteria (hydrological regulation and erosion, climate change mitigation and biodiversity) with an average weight of 40 %.  Social criteria (employment, recreational activities and landscape) had a weight of 38 % and 22 % the economic criteria <b>case</b> (<b>wood,</b> hunting and fishing, livestock, renewable energies, rural tourism and mining). The results showed that new products and services such as tourism, renewable energies, landscape, hydrological regulation and erosion control, biodiversity or climate change mitigation are very relevant objectives. We also prioritized action plans comparing them with the distribution of the administration budget. Research highlights: The environmental and social criteria are much more important than the economic ones in the regional planning of the Mediterranean forest, regardless of the method used to aggregate the social preferences and if the forest is public or private.

40|$|The {{production}} of high-quality fermented food, i. e. cheeses and wines, occurs frequently in traditional factories {{with a large}} employment of traditional materials having technological relevance but, at the same time, some serious problems {{in the prevention of}} microbial spoilage. Among these “old” materials wood represent a typical <b>case.</b> <b>Wood</b> is employed in the fabrication of instruments involved in the {{production of}} traditional food such as barrels for wine aging or shelves for seasoning of cheese. The sanitization of these apparatus is today performed by empirical practices based on chemical sanitizers with the risk of poor efficacy and cross-contamination due to the residues of chemicals. The use of ozone could be a promising alternative. This molecule has some attractive features, thanks to the generator based on the Dielectric Barrier Discharge (DBD), it possible a cheap and in-situ production of ozone that results active against all microbiological forms. Furthermore, the high reactivity of ozone ensures the complete disappearance of residues after few minutes of treatment. In this work we present some applications of ozone in the prevention of proliferation of spoilage microbes applied to barriques, large barrels, wine grapes, and shelves for seasoning of cheese. For each application we describe the modification of the microflora due to the action of ozone combining traditional (plate count and genotypic characterization) and innovative (bioluminometry, pyro sequencing) analytical techniques. When the interaction between wood and food has a relevant impact for the quality of products, we evaluated the effects of ozone on the nature of wood components by specific tests and high-resolution analytical techniques. Obtained results confirmed that ozone is a valuable alternative to traditional agents, able to guarantee a complete sanitization in the technological interval of microbial contamination. The obtained results not reviled alterations of the nature of materials excluding interferences with the productive proces...|$|E

40|$|In vitro {{production}} of cellulase and xylanase was common among diverse freshwater ascomycetes and their hyphomycetous anamorphs. Production of enzymes involved in lignin degradation was rare. Most isolates {{were capable of}} causing mass loss in angiosperm wood, although values were low, at ∼ 10 % during a 24 -week period. A few isolates caused higher mass loss of up to 26. 5 %, and five of these were shown to solubilize significant amounts of lignin. This is the first report of lignin solubilization by freshwater fungi. Torula herbarum (hyphomycete) and Ophioceras dolichostomum (ascomycete) produced indices of lignin solubilization equivalent to those of terrestrial white-rot basidiomycetes.
