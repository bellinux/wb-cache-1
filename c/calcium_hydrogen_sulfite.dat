50|$|To avoid {{contamination}} and suppress {{the formation of}} by-products (which are difficult to remove) the reaction must be performed under careful control of mass ratios and process conditions. Excess sulfite (SO32−) or bisulfite (HSO3−) lead to an unpleasant odor of the downstream product, higher levels of ethylene glycol or glycol ethers (formed by the hydrolysis and ethoxylation of ethylene oxide) give hygroscopic and greasy surfactants. Concentrated ethylene glycol-containing sodium 2-hydroxyethyl sulfonate solutions can subsequently mostly be freed from ethylene glycol by continuous extraction with e.g. isopropanol (<0.5%). Therefore, in the continuous industrial process an aqueous sodium <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulfite</b> solution is prepared in a first reactor by mixing a sodium hydroxide solution and sulfur dioxide. In a second reactor the sodium <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulfite</b> solution is mixed with a slight excess of ethylene oxide to obtain sodium 2-hydroxyethyl sulfonate in almost quantitative yields at elevated temperature and pressure with a precise control of pH.

This extract {{was compared to}} one obtained {{in the presence of}} ascorbic acid (A). In the presence of A, two major compounds were obtained, 5 -O-caffeoylquinic acid (5 -CQA) and 4 -O-caffeoyl quinic acid. With S, their 2 '-sulfo-adducts were found instead, the structures of which were confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Also, for minor caffeoyl derivatives and quercetin glycosides, the corresponding sulfo-adducts were observed. Feruloyl and sinapoyl derivatives were not chemically affected by the presence of S. Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) was thought to be responsible for the formation of the sulfo-adducts. This was confirmed by preparing 2 '-sulfo- 5 -O-caffeoyl quinic acid in a model system using 5 -CQA, sodium <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulfite,</b> and PPO. This sulfo-adduct exhibited a small bathochromic shift (¿max 329 nm) as compared to 5 -CQA (¿max 325 nm) and a strong hypochromic shift with an extinction coefficient of 9357 ± 395 M– 1 cm– 1 as compared to 18494 ± 196 M– 1 cm– 1, respectively.

The potassium ion is coordinated by eight O atoms arising from hydroxy or sulfonate groups. The sulfonate group is bonded to the C atom neighbouring {{that of the}} lactone carbonyl group.

Addition of the sulfur nucleophile occurs from the less hindered face. One of the two independent lattice water molecules has hydrogen bonds to sulfonate O atoms of two different anions and is the acceptor of bonds from hydroxy groups of two further anions; the second lattice water molecule donates to the carbonyl and a hydroxy O atom in different anions, and accepts from a hydroxy O atom in a further anion.

40|$|SUMMARY Despite {{substantial}} {{efforts to}} control the spread of malaria, this infectious disease is still a major global health problem as chemotherapy of malaria parasites is limited by established drug resistance and lack of novel affordable treatment options. To combat malaria, identification and characterization of essential genes are needed. Although the calcium metabolism {{is very important in}} the life of P. falciparum, {{little is known about the}} genes which regulate the transport of calcium. With the release of the P. falciparum genome, a putative <b>calcium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> antiporter has been identified. To understand the role of this gene in the calcium metabolism of P. falciparum and to evaluate it as a drug target, we describe here the functional characterization by the heterologuous expression of this putative <b>calcium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> antiporter in Xenopus oocytes and in a S. cerevisiae strain which is deficient for the yeast vacuolar <b>calcium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> antiporter VCX 1. The putative 441 -residue protein, which we designate PfCHA, is predicted to contain 11 membrane-spanning segments and is related to the calcium exchanger family. Expression of pfcha in Xenopus oocytes resulted in a higher and pHdependent uptake of pfcha expressing oocytes, in comparison with control oocytes. External pH estimation showed that the calcium uptake was coupled to extrusion of protons out of the oocytes. In other experiments, we found that PfCHA has an antiport activity which is linear with time, unidirectional and electrogenic. Moreover PfCHA was inhibitable by La 3 +, a calcium transporter competitor, and was moderately inhibited by a sodium calcium exchanger inhibitor KB-R 7943. This inhibitor showed also a moderate inhibition on parasite growth in culture. In contrast to the Xenopus oocytes, expression of pfcha in yeasts mutants defective in the Ca 2 + transport resulted in a weakly complementat ion of the calcium tolerance. Our subcellular experiments suggested that PfCHA was localized to the yeast vacuole. These results confirm that PfCHA is a <b>calcium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> antiporter and we speculate that PfCHA could be a potential drug target. Further studies are needed to localize it in the parasite and to evaluate it as a drug target...|$|R
