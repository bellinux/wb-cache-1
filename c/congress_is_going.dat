It can be said that the major issues of reform in the realm of the economy in China have already all been solved, and what remain as tasks to be completed are simply tasks of amending, repairing, and perfecting the system.

40|$|There is {{only one}} sure way to make {{something}} happen in public policy and in politics, {{and that is to}} organize. Sometimes external events-the Great Depression, World War II, Vietnam, Watergate, September 11 th, Enron, and MCI WorldCom-will make things happen of their own accord. But we can 2 ̆ 7 t wait for events to create opportunity, and many such stimuli are in fact things we don 2 ̆ 7 t want to happen. So it is up to us. And the time for organizing is not just when an issue is at the forefront. Organizing is needed to build interest and support on issues {{over a longer period of}} time. Citizens need a reason to participate in the political process, a reason to register to vote, and a reason to participate in electing better candidates to office. The challenge not only includes getting better people to run, but also getting those already in office to behave better (even if they are not better people). Thus an issue like Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) reauthorization is one part of a larger strategic agenda.

Bell pressed a case in the media that the NFL should be exempted from antitrust regulations and proffered the league was a sport and not a business. He invited an investigation from Congress with respect to the court's ruling. The House Judiciary committee, chaired by Emanuel Celler—who believed the draft was illegal and should be abolished, convened in July 1957 to discuss the ramifications of the Radovich decision. Red Grange and Bell testified at the committee's solicitation and argued the draft was essential to the sport's success. Representatives of the NFLPA contradicted these statements and said the draft and the reserve clause were anti-labor, and it seemed as if <b>Congress</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to accept their position. Faced with Congressional opposition, Bell formally recognized the NFLPA and declared he would negotiate with its representatives.|$|R

Undoubtedly, we shall be rewarded according to our merit". Congress, for its part, at first not really wanting any part of the affair, effectively voted to strip and then abandon the forts. Both Allen and Arnold protested these measures, pointing out that doing so would leave the northern border wide open. They both also made proposals to Congress and other provincial bodies for carrying out an invasion of Quebec. Allen, in one instance, wrote that [...] "I will lay my life on it, that with fifteen hundred men, and a proper artillery, I will take Montreal". Allen also attempted correspondence with the people of Quebec and with the Indians living there in an attempt to sway their opinion toward the revolutionary cause.|$|R

40|$|Fee {{shifting}} in patent litigation {{has been}} a hot topic in recent years. In Octane Fitness v. ICON and Highmark v. Allcare, the Supreme Court {{made it easier to}} shift fees under 35 U. S. C. § 285, which allows courts to award reasonable attorney’s fees to prevailing parties in patent cases. Moreover, several bills have been introduced in Congress since 2013 that would expand courts’ power beyond the parameters of § 285. Various aspects of these proposals have been heavily debated, including whether fee shifting should be mandatory or discretionary, how to recover fees from the “real party in interest,” and whether to adopt a one-way or two-way fee shifting scheme. These sort of design choices regarding a fee shifting regime are not simply about who should pay for patent litigation. Fee shifting schemes also provide a roadmap from lawmakers about whether and how litigation ought to proceed. Fee shifting regimes, in other words, are used to influence litigation conduct. Thus, if <b>Congress</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to alter the fee shifting landscape for patent litigation, it must make careful choices in order to incentivize certain types of patent disputes, while simultaneously discouraging others. This Article does not advocate for a new fee shifting regime for patent litigation, nor does it endeavor to design one. Instead, it focuses on one narrow but important question about fee shifting in patent cases that has received surprisingly little attention: whether prevailing parties should be able to recover attorney’s fees incurred for litigation before the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) — the administrative tribunal of the U. S. Patent 2 ̆ 6 Trademark Office that was created by the America Invents Act (AIA). With the steep rise in both PTAB proceedings (post-AIA) and fee motions (post-Octane/Highmark), district courts are bound to face this question more frequently. While the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has allowed for the recovery of such fees in the past, the Federal Circuit’s analysis was flawed in light of Supreme Court precedent. Thus, this Article proposes that Congress enact legislation allowing parties who prevail at the PTAB to recover their attorney’s fees...|$|E
5000|$|The case {{concerned}} the legality and constitutionality of Department of Health and Human Services regulations {{on the use}} of funds spent by the U.S. federal government to promote family planning (Title X). With Title X of the Public Health Service Act, Congress prohibited the funds from being [...] "used in programs where abortion is a method of family planning." [...] In 1988, the Republican-appointed Secretary of Health and Human Services issued new regulations that prohibited projects receiving these funds from not only providing abortions, but also counseling, advising, or promoting the idea that a woman seek an abortion. These regulations were challenged {{on the grounds that they}} were not permissibly within the scope of the statute and that they violated the First and Fifth Amendments. Rust v. Sullivan (1991) was a challenge to Title X regulations of Health and Human Services that indicated how a certain program adopted by Congress, passed by <b>Congress,</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> implemented.

She also goes back on her promise to leave the glee club alone by having her new cheerleading co-captains, Becky and Santana, sabotage the club's recruitment drive. She rails against the school musical, and succeeds in having its funding rescinded. This angers Kurt's father, Burt Hummel (Mike O'Malley), who arranges for local businesses to sponsor the musical, and he enters the congressional race as a write-in candidate to defeat her. Sue runs a negative campaign, airing political ads containing false statements about Burt's personal life through her political ads. One of the other candidates in the race discovers that Santana is a lesbian, and uses this to attack Sue on the issue of [...] "family values" [...] for appointing her a cheerleading captain, and to imply that Sue herself is a lesbian. Santana is devastated, as she has not yet come out as a lesbian. Sue attempts to combat the implications by starting a relationship one of her former bed partners, Ohio State football recruiter Cooter Menkins, who had recently been dating Coach Beiste.
