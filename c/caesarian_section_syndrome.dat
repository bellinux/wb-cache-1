One of the Important factors in the decision to choose the <b>caesarian</b> <b>section</b> delivery is the fear of childbirth. This study examined the difference in fear of childbirth between mothers choosing normal delivery compared with those who chose <b>caesarian</b> <b>section</b> even though there was no medical indication for this procedure. Three components of fear of childbirth were measured: verbal, physiological and behavioral. Using T-test, it was found that in all three components, the mother 2 Ì† 7 s fear regarding the childbirth in deciding the <b>caesarian</b> <b>section</b> method, was much higher than those that with choice of normal delivery. In addition, the study also found that the main reason for choosing <b>caesarian</b> <b>section</b> method was the lack of confidence in ability to be able to go through a normal delivery and the practicality of <b>caesarian</b> <b>section</b> method.

40|$|A {{pregnant}} {{mother who}} cannot deliver vaginally has to undergo <b>caesarian</b> <b>section.</b> <b>Caesarian</b> <b>section</b> {{is a process}} by which a baby is delivered via a cut through anterior abdominal wall and uterine wall. The objective of this exercise is to study the case series of <b>caesarian</b> <b>section</b> in Muar Hospital and to study its relationship with maternal sociodemografic factors such as ethnic, parity, socioeconomic factors, residence, height and weight gain as a predictors. A case-control study {{was carried out in}} Muar Hospital from June, 1996 till December, 1996. The target population was mothers who delivered f. at the hospital. Cases of 210 mothers who delivered by <b>caesarian</b> <b>section</b> were gathered with its control of 210 mothers delivered vaginally by frequency matching for age. Information gathered via treatment record kept at the Hospital Record Office. Study, showed that the most frequent <b>caesarian</b> <b>section</b> performed in the hospital was I emergency <b>caesarian</b> <b>section</b> (65. 71 %) as compared to elective (34. 29 %). The most frequent indication noted were repeat <b>caesarian</b> <b>section</b> (18. 1 %) followed by fetal distress (13. 81 %) and disproportion (13. 81 %). Univariate analysis showed that there was no significant association between <b>caesarian</b> <b>section</b> with parity, ethnicity and education status. However, <b>caesarian</b> <b>section</b> was significantly associated with maternal working status, family income, residence, the status of antenatal care, height and weight gain. (p value < 0. 05). After controlling for confounder by multivariate analysis, <b>caesarian</b> <b>section</b> was found significantly associated to the status of antenatal care, residence, height and weight gain. (p < 0. 05). Odds ratio for a pregnant lady to undergo <b>caesarian</b> <b>section</b> was 2. 6 if she was to have poor antenatal care, 2. 8 if she lived in town, 3. 4 if she had a short stature of less than 145 cm and 88. 9 if she gained weight more than 0. 5 kg per week. Thus, antenatal care, maternal residence, height and weight gain may be used as a predictor for <b>caesarian</b> <b>section</b> in a pregnant lady. Steps must be taken by the health staff to improve the nutritional status of the children, so that malnutrition is really abated in the country. Malnutrition may lead to stunted growth. The health staff should improve the quality of antenatal care given as well as mothers should be motivated to participate as well. Mothers with weight gain problem should be given diet counseling. Therefore, a dietician is needed during an antenatal clinic session...|$|R

40|$|Background: Mother-to-child {{transmission}} of HIV {{is an important}} mode of spread of HIV in India. With strategies like <b>caesarian</b> <b>section</b> and nevirapine therapy, this spread has been reduced. However, they have costs attached. In this context, this paper attempts to compare the cost-effectiveness of alternative childbirth strategies among HIV-positive mothers receiving nevirapine. Materials and Methods: Using sentinel surveillance data from three districts in Tamil Nadu, a model was created to test the cost-effectiveness of vaginal delivery against elective <b>caesarian</b> <b>section</b> among mothers receiving nevirapine. Sensitivity analysis was applied to evaluate cost per HIV infection prevented. Results: Vaginal delivery is not only cheaper in HIV-infected mothers receiving nevirapine but also cost-effective as compared to elective <b>caesarian</b> <b>section.</b> The incremental cost for preventing an additional HIV infection through <b>caesarian</b> <b>section</b> was Rs. 76, 000. Sensitivity analysis reveals that the findings are robust over a range of HIV transmission probabilities, 0. 04 - 0. 14 for vaginal delivery and 0. 00 - 0. 02 for <b>caesarian</b> <b>section.</b> Conclusions: From a clinical perspective, {{the findings suggest that}} pregnant HIV-infected women receiving nevirapine should consider the benefits of a cheaper and safer vaginal delivery.

The Effect of Adding Vitamin B 12 on Fe Folate Supplementation in Increasing Hemoglobin Level Among Post <b>Caesarian</b> <b>Section</b> Patients at RSU PKU Muhammadiyah Delanggu, Klaten. A Thesis for The Masters Program in Nutrition, Postgraduate Program, Universitas Sebelas Maret, Surakarta. 2009 Caesaria {{section is}} an {{important}} cause of maternal bleeding at delivery. Post <b>caesarian</b> <b>section</b> bleeding leads to anemia among lactating women that subsequently can {{affect the quality of}} mothersâ€™ milk and maternal fatigue. The anemia problem stems from not only iron deficiency but also folic acid and vitamin B 12 deficiencies. This study aimed to determine the effect of adding vitamin B 12 on Fe folate supplementation in increasing hemoglobin level among post <b>caesarian</b> <b>section</b> women. This study was a double blinded randomized controlled trial (RCT). The target population was post birth delivery mothers who underwent caesarean section. The source population was post birth delivery mothers who underwent <b>caesarian</b> <b>section</b> at RSU PKU Muhammadiyah Delanggu, Klaten, Jawa Tengah. Sixteen post <b>caesarian</b> <b>section</b> mothers received Fe Folate supplement, while other 16 post <b>caesarian</b> <b>section</b> mothers received Fe Folate and vitamin B 12 for 60 days. The outcome variable was hemoglobin level (g/L) measured twice, before and after treatment. Confounding factors under consideration were age, intakes of iron, vitamin B 12, protein, energy, and folate, respectively during the study. The effectiveness of adding B 12 was analyzed by t test, using SPSS version 16. The analysis results showed {{no significant difference in the}} mean increase of Hb between mothers who received and who did not receive vitamin 12 supplementation (p= 0. 369). This study concludes that adding vitamin B 12 on Fe Folate supplementation is not effective in further increasing the hemoglobin level among post birth delivery mothers who underwent caesarean section.

40|$|ABSTRACT Background: Surgical site {{infection}} {{is a common}} complication after <b>caesarian</b> <b>section.</b> Correct identification of risk factors for SSI {{is key to the}} design and implementation of effective preventive strategies. Preventive strategies are costly, however, and should be implemented up {{to the point where the}} costs per surgical site infection avoided are less than the benefits gained per surgical site infection. This means that only cost effective strategies should be embarked on. Objectives: To identify risk factors of surgical site infections and the associated costs and to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis on extending antibiotic prophylaxis to all women undergoing <b>caesarian</b> <b>section</b> in Norway. Study Group: Women who under-went <b>caesarian</b> <b>section</b> in Norway and were captured by the Norwegian surveillance system for hospital-acquired infections (NOIS) between September 2012 and December 2014. Methods: Three analyses (risk analysis, cost analysis and cost-effectiveness analysis) were conducted from a hospital perspective. Logistic regression was used for the risk analysis, micro-costing for the cost analysis and decision analytical model for the cost-effectiveness analysis. Surgical site infection avoided was the measure of effect in cost effectiveness analysis. All costs were in Norwegian kroner (NOK, 2015). Results: A total of 19, 796 women who underwent <b>caesarian</b> <b>section</b> were included in the study. The mean age was 31 Â± 4. The rate of surgical site infections was 4. 4 % or 868 out of 19, 796 <b>caesarian</b> <b>sections.</b> Data on 10 variables were analyzed and three of these were identified as independent risk factors of surgical site infections: (i) ASA score greater than III (OR 11. 49; p-value 0. 05; 95 % CI 1. 02 â€“ 129. 46), (ii) hospitals with bed capacity 250 â€“ 500 (OR 1. 44; p-value 0. 04; 95 % CI 1. 01 â€“ 2. 06) and (iii) secondary level hospitals (OR 2. 30; p-value 0. 00; 95 % CI 1. 36 â€“ 3. 89). The average cost of <b>caesarian</b> <b>section</b> not complicated with SSI was NOK 52, 117. For <b>caesarian</b> <b>section</b> complicated with SSI, it was NOK 124, 321. The costs of SSI increased with the depth of infection. For superficial SSI, the costs were NOK 97, 301, for deep SSI there were NOK 189, 329 and for organ/space infections there were NOK 196, 754. Prolonged length of stay accounted for 78 % of all the costs and the least costs were for laboratory tests. The average cost per patient with the current antibiotic guidelines was NOK 55, 634 while it was NOK 55, 231 if the antibiotic prophylaxis is given to all women undergoing <b>caesarian</b> <b>section.</b> The proportion of women with SSI was 5 % and 4 % for the current and extended guidelines respectively, representing a cost saving of NOK 40, 300 per avoided SSI. The difference in costs and effects between the extended guidelines and the current guidelines was NOK 403, (95 % CI: NOK - 900 to NOK 150) and 0. 01, (95 % CI: 0. 0025 to 0. 012) ...|$|R
