Shackleford (1855), the Court {{held that}} the section 30's {{allocation}} of peremptory <b>challenges</b> controlled, rather than an 1840 statute that required federal jury selection to generally follow state law (and, thus, the prosecutor was given no peremptory <b>challenges</b> in such cases). Ten years later, Congress abrogated Shackleford, granting prosecutors five peremptory <b>challenges</b> in treason and capital cases (and two in non-capital felony cases); the 1865 act left the defendant's number of peremptory <b>challenges</b> unchanged.|$|E

5|$|London was {{the premier}} centre for boxing because the aristocratic {{supporters}} of the sport dispersed to their country estates {{during the summer months}} but tended to congregate in the city for the winter period. Birmingham was often portrayed as second only to London for the sport and in 1789 there were a series of <b>challenges</b> issued by fighters from the Birmingham area to opponents based around London. The <b>challenges</b> were intended to demonstrate the level of organisation and confidence among the Birmingham boxers and their supporters. Three of these <b>challenges</b> were accepted, including that from Perrins to Tom Johnson. Perrins had already issued a general challenge, offering to fight any man in England for a prize of 500 guineas, having beaten all challengers in the counties around Birmingham.|$|E
