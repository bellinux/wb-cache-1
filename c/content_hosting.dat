50|$|In the 2010s, {{with the}} {{increasing}} prevalence of technology and the Internet in everyday life, video hosting services serve as a portal to different forms of entertainment (comedy, shows, games, or music), news, documentaries and educational videos. Content may be either both user-generated, amateur clips or commercial products. The entertainment industry uses this medium to release music and videos, movies and television shows directly to the public. Since many users do not have unlimited web space, either as a paid service, or through an ISP offering, video hosting services are becoming increasingly popular, especially with the explosion in popularity of blogs, internet forums, and other interactive pages. The mass market for camera phones and smartphones has increased the supply of user-generated video. Traditional methods of personal video distribution, such as making a DVD to show to friends at home, are unsuited to the low resolution and high volume of camera phone clips. In contrast, current broadband Internet connections are well suited to serving the quality of video shot on mobile phones. Most people do not own web servers, and this has created demand for user-generated video <b>content</b> <b>hosting.</b>|$|E

50|$|Social {{networking}} sites originally did not host hyperlocal content {{but were}} the largest distributors of such content hosted on other sites. This {{is because of}} the contemporary nature of sharing and the predominantly local composition of user's network in which content is shared. This type of distribution is secondary (done by users) in contrast to the primary distribution done by the <b>content</b> <b>hosting</b> site itself (e.g. Craigslist). In recent years there has been a shift in user behavior to use Social Networking sites for both creating as well as sharing hyperlocal content. Prime examples exist in the phenomenon that Whatsapp is being increasingly used for community organization and eCommerce despite having no feature support for these activities. Facebook also hosts 60x more event than eVite (the leading site which specializes in events only). This user behavior suggests that an effective hyperlocal distribution is a more important consideration for users than the superior quality of the content itself. Since 2010, evidence shows that Social Networking sites have been mobilizing to aid and leverage this user behavior. Google acquired Zagat in 2011. Since 2012 Facebook has been adding new features to create varied hyperlocal content e.g. Blogs, Events. In early 2015 Facebook announced the feature to mark a post as sold and later in 2015 it introduced a C2C payment system. Many believe these steps as precursors to an imminent launch of Facebook Classifieds and Marketplace, most likely rolled into one.|$|E
40|$|FLEX {{is a new}} {{scalable}} "locality aware" {{solution for}} achieving both load balancing and efficient memory usage on a cluster of machines hosting several web sites. FLEX allocates the sites to different machines in the cluster based on their traffic characteristics. This aims to avoid the unnecessary document replication to improve the overall performance of the system. The desirable routing {{can be done by}} submitting the corresponding configuration files to the DNS server, since each hosted web site has a unique domain name. FLEX can be easily implemented on top of the current infrastructure used by Web hosting service providers. Using a simulation model and a synthetic trace generator, we compare the Round-Robin based solutions and FLEX over the range of different workloads. For generated traces, FLEX outperforms Round-Robin based solutions 2 - 5 times. 1 Introduction Web <b>content</b> <b>hosting</b> is an increasingly common practice.

40|$|Recent {{studies show}} that a {{significant}} part of Internet traffic is delivered through Web-based applications. To cope with the increasing demand for Web content, large scale <b>content</b> <b>hosting</b> and delivery infrastructures, such as data-centers and content distribution networks, are continuously being deployed. Being able to identify and classify such hosting infrastructures is helpful not only to content producers, content providers, and ISPs, but also to the research community at large. For example, to quantify the degree of hosting infrastructure deployment in the Internet or the replication of Web content. In this paper, we introduce Web Content Cartography, i. e., the identification and classification of <b>content</b> <b>hosting</b> and delivery infrastructures. We propose a lightweight and fully automated approach to discover hosting infrastructures based only on DNS measurements and BGP routing table snapshots. Our experimental results show that our approach is feasible even with a limited number of well-distributed vantage points. We find that some popular content is served exclusively from specific regions and ASes. Furthermore, our classification enables us to derive content-centric AS rankings that complement existing AS rankings and shed light on recent observations about shifts in inter-domain traffic and the AS topology...|$|E

40|$|Web <b>content</b> <b>hosting,</b> {{in which}} a Web server stores and {{provides}} Web access to documents for different customers, is becoming increasingly common. Due to the variety of customers (corporate, individuals, etc.), providing differentiated levels of service is often an important issue for the hosts. Most server implementations, however, are not structured to service requests based on different levels of quality of service (QoS). This paper presents our attempts at augmenting a popular server implementation with differentiated QoS features. We explore priority-based request scheduling at both user and kernel levels. We find that simple strategies such as controlling the numbers of processes can improve the response time of high-priority requests notably while preserving the system throughput. We also find that the kernellevel approach tends to penalize low-priority requests less significantly than the user-level approach, while improving the performance of high-priority requests similarly.

40|$|Interactive Voice Response (IVR) systems play an {{important}} role in collecting and disseminating information in developing regions. Recently, researchers have used IVR technology to build voice forums, in which callers leave messages that can be heard over the Internet and over the phone. However, despite their appeal, voice forums remain difficult to set up, and difficult to scale due to the overhead of moderating content and the cost of phone calls. This paper discusses the challenges and opportunities in creating scalable voice forums. We also present a new open-source system, IVR Junction, that leverages existing free services and commercial tools to simplify the process of creating a voice forum. IVR Junction utilizes familiar cloud-based services to provide free <b>content</b> <b>hosting</b> and moderation, as well as a novel mechanism for automatically synchronizing content across geographically-dispersed offices, thereby enabling local access points with decreased calling costs. ...|$|E

40|$|Web <b>content</b> <b>hosting,</b> {{in which}} a Web server stores and {{provides}} Web access to documents for different customers, is becoming increasingly common. For example, a web server can host webpages for several different companies and individuals. Traditionally, Web Service Providers (WSPs) provide all customers with {{the same level of}} performance (best-effort service). Most service differentiation has been in the pricing structure (individual vs. business rates) or the connectivity type (dial-up access vs. leased line, etc.). This report presents DiffServer, a program that implements two simple, server-side, application-level mechanisms (server-centric and client-centric) to provide different levels of web service. The results of the experiments show that there is not much overhead due to the addition of this additional layer of abstraction between the client and the Apache web server under light load conditions. Also, the average waiting time for high priority requests decreases significantly after they are assigned priorities as compared to a FIFO approach...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{increasing}} popularity of Internet some web sites cannot anymore serve every client all the time. Preparing for the peak hours can mean expensive investments, if no {{quality of service}} methods are used. In this study I combine two basic methods, content based quality of service and session based quality of service. The basic design guarantees that when client is once let in, it can continue without disruptions. Also, services (i. e., content) are allocated a certain share of total capacity, which they are guaranteed to get. If the server is heavily loaded, the design forces the usage of capacity in to a balance situation according to pre-allocated shares. The experimental results support the theory behind the design, and I therefore {{think this is a}} good scheme for heavily used web sites to use. 1 Introduction The explosive growth of Internet requires more and more from the underlying hardware and software used by <b>content</b> <b>hosting</b> service providers are using.

40|$|YouTube, {{currently}} {{the largest and}} most widely used online video service, is at the epicenter of the expanding videosharing universe. Video 2. 0, a subset of the Web 2. 0 suite of interactive browser-based tools, offers educators millions of hours of free video <b>content,</b> <b>hosting,</b> and distribution online. This is particularly beneficial in e-learning which relies on digital content. While video is valuable for many types of instructional events, its role in meeting educational outcomes within the affective learning domain is compelling. Video is a powerful medium for conveying the spectrum of human emotion through the drama of the audiovisual story. This paper illustrates how short video clips can be selected and produced to meet affective learning objectives. A liability case study from the health-care profession is used {{as an example of a}} real-world story that contextualizes values that are critical for health-care professionals to internalize. Micro-level instructional design principles are used as the conceptual framework to guide selection and production of the types of short video clips that are commonly found on YouTube and other video-sharing services...|$|E
