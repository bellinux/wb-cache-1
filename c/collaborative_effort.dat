5|$|Production of {{the song}} was a <b>collaborative</b> <b>effort</b> between Jackson, David Foster and Bill Bottrell. Andrae Crouch's Choir and Jackson engage in a back and forth chant as the song reaches its climactic finale.

He conceptualized a song that had an emotional message.|$|E

5|$|While Smith {{tends to}} write the lyrics and chords, song writing overall is a <b>collaborative</b> <b>effort.</b> The song writing starts with Smith on the piano or {{acoustic}} guitar where he records them and sends them to the other band members where the song is turned into a full 'Editors song'.

5|$|Greater {{cooperation}} between {{federal and state}} agencies {{on a national level}} has been coordinated through the National Interagency Fire Center. Though primarily a <b>collaborative</b> <b>effort</b> between federal agencies to develop a national level fire policy, the center also aids local and state governments in addressing their fire management issues. Universally accepted priorities include management directives which allow natural fires to burn unhindered under prescribed conditions. As in the 1988 fires, protection of lives and property continue to take precedence in all fire fighting efforts.|$|E
5|$|Jackson {{explained}} that he instantly liked the song, but listened to it twice before making his final decision. Although the song was written by Kelly, Jackson was adamant that the production should be a <b>collaborative</b> <b>effort</b> amongst the two musicians. The tape sent to him had no harmony or modulations, so Jackson added a choir in the final portion and added a sense of climax and structure to the final piece. The song has a tempo of 60 beats per minute, {{making it one of}} Jackson's slowest songs.|$|E

5|$|To Heart 2 {{development}} originally {{began as}} a <b>collaborative</b> <b>effort</b> for the PlayStation 2 between the Osaka and Tokyo studios of Aquaplus.

Production began shortly after once the team realized the popularity and success of the forerunner. Naoya Shimokawa, the president of Aquaplus, produced the resulting project, and Tsutomu Washimi served as the game's director.|$|E
5|$|Yield is {{the fifth}} studio album by the American {{alternative}} rock band Pearl Jam, released on February 3, 1998. Following a short promotional tour for its previous album, No Code (1996), Pearl Jam recorded Yield throughout 1997 at Studio Litho and Studio X in Seattle, Washington. The album was proclaimed as {{a return to the}} band's early, straightforward rock sound, and marked a more <b>collaborative</b> <b>effort</b> from the band as opposed to relying heavily on frontman Eddie Vedder to compose the songs. The lyrics deal with contemplative themes, albeit seen in a more positive manner compared to the band's earlier work.|$|E

5|$|Musicologist Francis Maes {{wrote that}} while Rimsky-Korsakov's efforts are laudable, {{they are also}} controversial. It was {{generally}} assumed that with Prince Igor, Rimsky-Korsakov edited and orchestrated the existing fragments of the opera while Glazunov composed and added missing parts, including most of the third act and the overture. This was exactly what Rimsky-Korsakov stated in his memoirs. Both Maes and Richard Taruskin cite an analysis of Borodin's manuscripts by musicologist Pavel Lamm, which showed that Rimsky-Korsakov and Glazunov discarded nearly 20 percent of Borodin's score. According to Maes, the result is more a <b>collaborative</b> <b>effort</b> by all three composers than a true representation of Borodin's intent. Lamm stated {{that because of the}} extremely chaotic state of Borodin's manuscripts, a modern alternative to Rimsky-Korsakov and Glazunov's edition would be extremely difficult to complete.|$|E
5|$|The PS3 {{client was}} {{developed}} in a <b>collaborative</b> <b>effort</b> between Sony and the Pande lab and was first released as a standalone client on March23, 2007. Its release made Folding@home the first distributed computing project to use PS3s. On September18 of the following year, the PS3 client became a channel of Life with PlayStation on its launch. In the types of calculations it can perform, {{at the time of}} its introduction, the client fit in between a CPU's flexibility and a GPU's speed. However, unlike CPUs and GPUs, users were unable to perform other activities on their PS3 while running Folding@home. The PS3's uniform console environment made technical support easier and made Folding@home more user friendly. The PS3 also has the ability to stream data quickly to its GPU, which was used for real-time atomic-level visualizing of the current protein dynamics.|$|E

5|$|The first likely {{description}} of the disease was in 1841 by Charles Oscar Waters. The condition was described in further detail in 1872 by George Huntington, after whom it is named. The genetic basis was discovered in 1993 by an international <b>collaborative</b> <b>effort</b> led by the Hereditary Disease Foundation. Research and support organizations began forming in the late 1960s to increase public awareness, to provide support for individuals and their families, and to promote research. Current research directions include determining the exact mechanism of the disease, improving animal models to aid with research, testing of medications to treat symptoms or slow the progression of the disease, and studying procedures such as stem cell therapy {{with the goal of}} repairing damage caused by the disease.|$|E
5|$|The {{work was}} {{commissioned}} by Sveriges Radio Radioteatern, the radio drama department of Sweden's national radio broadcaster. First released in the Swedish broadcast version in August 2009, with an English-language version following in November 2009, it features a cast of Swedish and American actors {{and a variety of}} musical styles ranging from opera to vaudeville and pop. The album's recording was a <b>collaborative</b> <b>effort</b> – while the music and English vocals were recorded by Sparks in the United States, the album's Swedish vocals were recorded by Sveriges Radio in Stockholm, and then sent to the Maels via an FTP server. The album and its ambitious dramatic concept received favourable reviews, and the Mael brothers have said that they are planning both a live show and a film version of the musical.|$|E
5|$|Afterwards the SEES members {{break into}} the school and indeed find Fuka inside Tartarus when the Dark Hour strikes. However when Akihiko pieces {{together}} {{the connection between the}} full moon and the powerful Shadows, Mitsuru and Yukari come under attack by the Emperor and Empress Arcanas at Tartarus' entrance. Junpei, Akihiko and Fuka rush to their aid however the Arcanas easily overwhelm all of their Personas. In the midst of the battle, Fuka also awakens a Persona, Lucia, to defend an entranced Natsuki. However when the Emperor moves to attack her, Makoto arrives {{in the nick of time}} and launches a barrage of Persona attacks despite his teammates begging him to flee for his safety. With everyone approaching their physical limits, Fuka uses Lucia to sense the Arcanas' weaknesses and coordinates the SEES members in a <b>collaborative</b> <b>effort</b> which results in the Shadows' defeat. A few days later, Fuka moves into the Iwatodai dorm and repairs her relations with Natsuki, while life returns to a level of normalcy.|$|E

5|$|Metroid Prime was a {{collaboration}} between Retro Studios and Nintendo EAD and R. The overall design was a <b>collaborative</b> <b>effort,</b> while the art and engineering was done entirely at Retro, and the music was handled in Japan. Retro Studios was created in 1998 by an alliance between Nintendo and Iguana Entertainment founder Jeff Spangenberg. The studio would create games for the forthcoming GameCube targeted at a mature demographic. After establishing its offices in Austin, Texas in 1999, Retro worked on four GameCube projects. When Miyamoto visited Retro in 2000, he suggested a new Metroid game after seeing the prototype of a first-person shooter engine they had created. In 2000 and early 2001, three games in development at Retro were canceled, and in July 2001, an RPG, Raven Blade, was terminated, leaving Prime {{the only game in}} development. During the last nine months of development, Retro's staff worked 80- to 100-hour weeks to reach the deadline imposed by Nintendo.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy V was {{directed}} by Final Fantasy series creator Hironobu Sakaguchi who, prior {{to the release of}} Final Fantasy IX, called it his favorite Final Fantasy game. The character, image, and title logo designs were created by series illustrator and image designer Yoshitaka Amano, while the actual character sprites were designed by Kazuko Shibuya. The monsters were designed by Tetsuya Nomura. Amano has stated that he counts his depictions of both Faris from Final Fantasy V and Terra from Final Fantasy VI among his favorite Final Fantasy designs. The writing of the scenario text was a <b>collaborative</b> <b>effort</b> between Sakaguchi and Yoshinori Kitase. Sakaguchi conceived the plot and was in charge of it, while Kitase tried to include more humor to lighten up the relatively serious story. The Job System was designed by Hiroyuki Ito, who worked on the game as a battle planner alongside Akihiko Matsui. Mode7 effects were used in the airship sequences, which moving in the airship would cause the planet to rotate on its axis. In total, Square employed a team of 45 people to create the game, and 16Mbits of space were used to accommodate for the sprites, animations, and detailed background. According to GamePro in a May1993 issue, the Japanese authorities had asked Square not to release the game during a school day because schoolchildren would skip class to wait in line for the game.|$|E
5|$|While {{few other}} purely Expressionistic films were made, Caligari {{still had a}} major {{influence}} over other German directors, {{and many of the}} film's Expressionist elements – particularly the use of setting, light and shadow to represent the dark psychology of its characters – became prevalent in German cinema. Among the films to use these elements were Murnau's Nosferatu (1922) and The Last Laugh (1924), G. W. Pabst's Secrets of a Soul (1926), and Lang's Metropolis (1927) and M (1931). The success of Caligari also affected the way in which German films were produced during the 1920s. For example, the majority of major German films {{over the next few years}} moved away from location shooting and were fully filmed in studios, which assigned much more importance to designers in German cinema. Robinson argues this led to the rise of a large number of film designers – such as Hans Dreier, Rochus Gliese, Albin Grau, Otto Hunte, Alfred Junge, Erich Kettelhut and Paul Leni – and that effect was felt abroad as many of these talents later emigrated from Germany with the rise of the Nazi Party. Additionally, the success of Caligaris <b>collaborative</b> <b>effort</b> – including its director, set designers and actors – influenced subsequent film production in Germany for many years, making teamwork a hallmark of German cinema in the Weimar Republic.|$|E
