Upon taking office, Boucher formulated a ten-point “program of progress", {{which consisted of}} <b>centralizing</b> <b>purchasing,</b> updating equipment and work methods, improving snow removal, implementing new budget procedures, hiring professional leadership for the street department, and creating programs for street renewal, narcotics control, youth, tree replacement, {{and the development of}} Mount Cathalia as a recreational facility. Of his ten points, Boucher was able to implement the first five, which he said resulted in [...] "countless tax savings" [...] for the people of Ellenville. In July 1969, Ellenville Trustee Rivan Krieger moved to remove Boucher from office after Boucher signed a check (worth $11.63) that should've gone to the New York State Employee's Retirement Fund over to himself. He was later accused of having falsely claimed be a graduate of two colleges. In August 1969, Boucher resigned, citing “political pressure” and his “deteriorating” relationship with the Ellenville Board of Trustees.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Swedish {{private equity}} firms have {{demonstrated}} a historical {{success in the}} buyout industry. However, current trends in the industry such as institutional changes, phenomenon of capital overhang and an influx of new entrants have intensified competition among buyout firms. To maintain the expected high gains, private equity firms must actively create values for their portfolio companies. The {{purpose of this study}} is to describe and analyze how private equity firms with a hands-on approach add value to the companies under management. A literature review on value-creation by private equity firms was conducted. The valuecreation methods were classified by the authors under the four themes: governance engineering, financial engineering, operational engineering, and strategic redirections. In order to collect the empirical data, the authors chose an inductive approach, used semi-structured interviews with representatives from five private equity firms. The results show that the studied firms undertake to a large extent similar actions when it comes to corporate governance and financial engineering. With governance engineering, the firms attempt to strengthen the portfolio companies’ governance system through proper due diligence, the appointment of a competent and independent board of directors, an appropriate and deep management incentive program, establishment of a close relationship with management, and periodic management reports. The key to efficient governance is to give the portfolio firms 100 % focus on operational and strategic issues in the board meetings. All but one firm use significant debt to lever the buyouts as it is evident that the pressure of debt repayment incentivizes management to better handle scarce capital. Operational engineering and strategic redirection are the two themes in which the firms mainly distinguish themselves. Operational engineering largely concerns running operation more efficiently through a combination of cost-cuttings (divestment of non-profitable product and customer, outsourcing, <b>centralizing</b> <b>purchases)</b> and higher revenue growth (finding new markets, providing more after-sale service, extending product range). Strategic redirection incorporates the focus on core competences, making strategic decisions about investments, divestments, and add-on acquisitions. There have been differences in actions taken by the studied firms. Factors that could affect the behavior of private equity firms are the type of companies acquired, the firm size, their perception of risk and reward regarding a particular action, as well as years of experiences in the industry. There is no common timeframe for actions taken by the studied firms. Nevertheless, all firms emphasize the importance of implementing fundamental changes in the early years of the investments...|$|R
50|$|Scale effects {{resulting}} from <b>centralized</b> acquisition <b>purchase</b> centres {{in the food}} supply chain favor large players such as big retailers or distributors in the food distribution market. This {{is due to the}} fact that they can utilize their strong market power and financial advantage over smaller players. Having both strong market power and greater access to the financial credit market meant that they can impose barriers to entry and cement their position in the food distribution market. This would result in a food distribution chain that is characterized by large players on one end and small players choosing niche markets to operate in on the other end. The existence of smaller players in specialized food distribution markets could be attributed to their shrinking market share and their inability to compete with the larger players due to the scale effects. Through this mechanism, globalization has displaced smaller role players.Another mechanism troubling the specialized food distribution markets is the ability of distribution chains to possess their own brand. Stores with their own brand are able to combat price wars between competitors by lowering the price of their own brand, thus making consumers more likely to purchase goods from them.|$|R

It is also the largest steel mill built in the US in decades. The mill began production in July, 2010 and is the largest non-governmental capital project in the US in decades. The investment {{is in keeping with}} a Steel Industry move from being labor intensive to capital intensive with technology being the primary driver for this shift. Steel is used primarily in construction, automobile and infrastructure industries and its use is rapidly increasing across the world and in the United States. A primary target customer of this new plant is the automotive industry, which has high quality standards and low tolerance for supply chain disruption. These requirements are key to the choices ThyssenKrupp made. The Problem TKS knew that building state-of-the-art business process systems to support supplying rolled steel to US customers {{was the only way to}} compete with older mills investing in new technology and newer mills being built in emerging markets.

40|$|The {{trend towards}} {{production}} consolidation and integration processes taking place {{both in the}} Russian and global economies leads to development of business associations, with a holding company being {{the most common form}} inRussiaand around the globe. The evidence in favor of the formation of holding companies is that they can benefit from the scale (bulk <b>purchasing,</b> <b>centralized</b> stuff training); in the global capital and exports markets they can be more effective than smaller businesses and, if non-profitable, a loss-making structure is easier to liquidate than the entire company; holding companies and associations can be an effective defender from political interference. As the importance of the well-functioning and harmonized procedure for the companies’ integration will increase (especially in the context of Russian business, where specific features of many areas of the production system imply the use of holding oligopolies as the most effective form of market structures), there is a need in their more profound study and, in particular, in the analysis of the most important technologies of the general integration procedure.

40|$|This thesis {{intends to}} be a {{critical}} reflection on the digitization of the acquisition procedures of goods and services, which European policies are aimed to facilitate in order to foster economic revival on both the national and the Community level. Many different reasons make us wonder if it isn't appropriate to introduce a digitized public tender procedure in national and Community legislation. The Community’s economic and cultural policies have influenced national legislation by steering them towards {{the creation of an}} organic and unified set of rules for public tender. Specifically, economic goals such as the realization of a Single Market based on the principle of competition, can be considered essential with regard to acquisition of goods and services. As a matter of fact, the EU policies are intended to identify public tender as a strategic means for market revival and renewed competitiveness between enterprises, so to {{have a positive effect on}} the current economic crisis. Given the amount of financial resources connected to the Public Procurement Code, it is the economic crisis itself that calls for rationalization of public expenditure on acquisitions, which has been an ever more consolidated policy in the past few years, also by national government. This essay will focus on the growing importance of the Community, in particular on its economic policy and its influence over national regulations. The pursuit of the primary objective of European policies - the realization of a Single Market - is the decisive factor in the shift in function of contemporary public tendering from an exclusively national economic matter into a strategic means for the competitiveness of enterprises in the Single Market. This new function and its subsequent use in the public procurement in a broader framework are major factors in undermining the Italian traditional acquisition procedures which identifies the local authority as the fundamental body for the procurement procedures. The change from local to global perspective made it necessary to reflect on the convenience of an evolution in the acquisition dynamics developed in the late 2000 s. In fact, faced with the same economic problems and urged on by the EU, the Italian government has established a <b>centralized</b> digital <b>purchasing</b> system, the Consip model of 3 the electronic market, which has been able to provide an immediate response to the issue of expenditure rationalization by streamlining and simplifying procedures. Through the development of the information society, the European Union points at building a renewed relationship between institutions and citizens, based on the exchange of data in a new perspective of collaboration and simplification of procedures. The need to coordinate the technological tools with traditional institutions of administrative law implies the need to modernize the previous administrative structure both in terms of technological means and in terms of computer literacy for the operators. To this effect the Italian government has established appropriate institutions such as the AIPA, DigitPa and, most recently, the Agency for digital Italy. The mere creation of a digitized administration in which digital technologies are not only a support tool, but also a way to coordinate and redefine the administration itself, requires the analysis of its underlying principles and of some institutions of the administrative digitization procedure. Though the CONSIP system and the electronic market are generally considered to be acquisition procedures, they can't be traced back to the classical notion of administrative procedure. For this reason the analysis of the principles on which the digital administration is based has led us to reflect on their possible application to the procedure of public tender. Given the specific nature of the purchasing process it would be superfluous to create a new set of rules specifically for public tendering, as it can be covered by the current regulation of the digital administration. So even if at first glance there don't seem to exist specific guidelines for the digitization of the acquisition procedures, these can be deducted from the existing regulations of the industry and the Digital Administration Code (DAC). Furthermore, the development of a completely digitized procedure would allow us to better respond to economic needs in the current time of crisis. Technological tools not only save time and money, they can also open the market to more competitors, ultimately resulting in national and global economic revival. This revival will also result from a reduction of the type corruption that is typical of public tender, because the use of a digital procedure will render the expenditure of public money more transparent and easier to control...|$|R
