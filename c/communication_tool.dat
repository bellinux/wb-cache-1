The host of the race, the Viscount, sets a task for each stage. This task must be completed before the player can continue to another map. The player with the most points is the winner of the stage. The overall winner of all the stages is the winner of the Viscount's race. In the Festival Mode, the gameplay is fundamentally the same as in the Adventure Mode, {{with the exception of the}} ability to select stages to play freely. In the My Room mode, the player's character has his or her own private room in which he or she can either play minigames that have been collected in Adventure Mode, view a collection of items obtained in Adventure Mode, or create a Motion Panel, a unique in-game <b>communication</b> <b>tool</b> can allow customized messages to be sent mid-game to help friends or distract other players' gameplay.

The instrumental case study investigated the level and frequency of use of the web-based <b>communication</b> <b>tools</b> during a full-fledged course delivery at a university that enrols only full-time students.

The conceptual framework focused on interactivity, features of <b>communication</b> <b>tools</b> that promote interactivity, as well as the domains such as cognition, motivation and learner interface as aspects that influence {{the use of}} <b>communication</b> <b>tools.</b> Various web-based tools were used by a sample consisting of a selected small group of IT students who participated in the study. Those <b>communication</b> <b>tools</b> were used to facilitate learning in WebCT. The results showed a total of 145 interactions for the duration of ten sessions. The WebCT <b>communication</b> <b>tools</b> supported either synchronous or asynchronous <b>communication.</b> <b>Communication</b> <b>tools</b> were used to retrieve information and send text-based messages to lecturers and students.
