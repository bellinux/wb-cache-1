40|$|Cell {{separation}} {{is an important}} component of modern medicine, with both clinical and research applications. Clinically, it is often desirable to isolate cell subpopulations providing focused treatment; on the research side, cell isolation is necessary for studies underpinning many discoveries in cell biology, further enabling research in areas such as regenerative medicine and cancer therapy. Cell separation requirements include high throughput, purity and recovery. Three <b>cell</b> <b>separators</b> dominate: fluorescence and magnetic-activated cell sorting and density-gradient centrifugation.

40|$|Introduction: Apheresis {{procedures}} [Plateletpheresis, Plasmapheresis/ Therapeutic Plasma Exchange (TPE), & Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Collection (PBSC) ] {{are usually}} well tolerated. Occasionally, Adverse Events (AEs) of variable severity may occur {{during or after}} the procedure. AEs that occur in Donors/Patients are divided into local reactions and systemic reactions. Materials and Methods: A total of 3, 367 apheresis procedures were performed, out of which 3, 120 were plateletpheresis procedures, and out of which 1, 401 were on Baxter CS 3000 & 1, 719 were on Haemonetics MCS+ <b>cell</b> <b>separators.</b> Rest of 247 TPE & PBSC procedures were done on Haemonetics MCS+ <b>cell</b> <b>separators.</b> Results: 90 AEs were reported {{in relation to the}} 3, 367 procedures. Out of 90 AEs, 85 AEs (94 %) were associated with plateletpheresis (n = 3, 120) and 05 AEs (06 %) with TPE & PBSC (n = 247). The rate of vascular injury (VI), Citrate reaction (CR), and Presyncopal/Syncopal (PS/S) in plateletpheresis was 1. 6 % (52 / 3, 120), 0. 96 % (30 / 3, 120), and 0. 096 % (03 / 3, 120), respectively. The rate of CR in TPE and PBSC was 1. 23 % (02 / 162) and 2. 3 % (02 / 85), respectively. The rate of PS/S in PBSC was 1. 17 % (01 / 85). AEs for Plateletpheresis, TPE & PBSC were 2. 7 % (85 / 3, 120), 1. 23 % (02 / 162), and 3. 5 % (03 / 85), respectively. VI, CR, and PS/S were mostly of mild intensity. Both <b>cell</b> <b>separators</b> were equally safe, when AEs associated with plateletpheresis were compared with each other; 2. 8 % on CS 3000 & 2. 6 % on MCS+. Conclusion: Apheresis procedures performed on <b>cell</b> <b>separators</b> are safe, with a low incidence of significant AEs. No significant difference was noted in AEs among the two <b>cell</b> <b>separators</b> studied...|$|R

5000|$|The {{earliest}} {{roots of}} IBM's {{development of the}} IBM 2997 Blood <b>cell</b> <b>Separator</b> lay in the personal tragedy of one of IBM's development engineers, George Judson. In 1962, Judson's son, Tom, was diagnosed with leukemia. His physician was able to have Tom admitted to the Clinical Center of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). On admission, they showed Judson a procedure to remove white blood cells from a patient. It was laborious. They would remove two units (450 ml) of blood, spin them in a bucket centrifuge, express the plasma into a satellite bag, and the white cells into another satellite bag. The packed red cells and the plasma would be recombined and administered to the patient. This would be repeated over and over. Judson, being an engineer, suggested {{that this could be}} done on a continuous-flow basis. He was sent to see Dr. Emil J. Freireich who expressed enthusiasm for the project. Judson returned to IBM and asked for a year's leave of absence to work on his ideas. IBM gave him the one-year leave with pay and provided engineering assistance. His work {{led to the development of}} the NCI Blood <b>Cell</b> <b>Separator</b> and later to the IBM 2990 Blood <b>Cell</b> <b>Separator</b> which could harvest white blood cells from blood donors, to support leukemia patients to keep them alive. The subsequent development of the machine as the IBM 2997, essentially a continuous centrifuge which separated the blood into red blood cells, white blood cells, and blood plasma (used in plasmapheresis), was picked up by IBM's Systems Supplies Division (SSD) which was already ready marketing the IBM 2991 Blood cell Processor. The (disposable) supplies element represented a large part of the revenue stream.The IBM 2997 machine was developed in USA in the 1970s, but the most remarkable applications were in Italy Milan, they were by Girolamo Sirchia, MD and Dr. Marconi in Centro TRasfusionale & Transplant North Italy.

50|$|Ficoll {{is part of}} Ficoll-Paque, {{which is}} used in biology {{laboratories}} to separate blood to its components (erythrocytes, leukocytes etc.). Ficoll-Paque is normally placed {{at the bottom of}} a conical tube, and blood is then slowly layered above Ficoll-Paque. After being centrifuged, the following layers will be visible in the conical tube, from top to bottom: plasma and other constituents, a layer of mono-nuclear cells called buffy coat (PBMC/MNC), Ficoll-Paque, and erythrocytes & granulocytes which should be present in pellet form. This separation allows easy harvest of PBMCs. Note that some red blood cell trapping (presence of erythrocytes & granulocytes) may occur in the PBMC or Ficoll-Paque layer. Major blood clotting may sometimes occur in the PBMC layer. Ethylene diamine tetra-acetate (EDTA) and heparin are commonly used in conjunction with Ficoll-Paque(TM) to prevent clotting and is used as a mononuclear <b>cell</b> <b>separator.</b>|$|E
