5000|$|Known Distance (KD) Appleseed Rifle Marksmanship {{clinics are}} also held {{separately}} for advanced students and instructors. These require center fire rifles only, and typically are started with initial sighting-in being done at 25 meters for setting Battle Sight Zeroes, followed by shooting at known distances of 100, 200, 300, and 400 yards, as a minimum. Where ranges physically can allow shooting further, students are also usually {{given an opportunity}} to shoot at 500 yards, 600 yards, and even longer distances, for determining precise data on personal equipment (DOPE), out to the limits of the particular range where the KD Appleseed is being held. The usual course of study is a classroom lecture for half of the first day, covering intermediate to advanced topics related to ranging, <b>come-ups,</b> mitigating wind, and related topics, followed by shooting sighters at 25 meters, and again at all distances that will be shot.

40|$|A three-strain {{mixture of}} Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 was inoculated into fresh dairy compost (ca. 107 CFU/g) with 40 or 50 % {{moisture}} and {{was placed in}} an environmental chamber (ca. 70 % humidity) that was programmed to ramp from room temperature to selected composting temperatures in 2 and 5 days to simulate the early composting phase. The surviving E. coli O 157 :H 7 population was analyzed by direct plating and enrichment. Optimal and suboptimal compost mixes, with carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratios of 25 : 1 and 16 : 1, respectively, were compared in this study. In the optimal compost mix, E. coli O 157 :H 7 survived for 72, 48, and 24 h in compost with 40 % moisture and for 72, 24, and 24 h with 50 % moisture at 50, 55, and 60 Â°C, respectively, following 2 days of <b>come-up</b> time (rate of heating up). However, in the suboptimal compost mix, the pathogen survived for 288, 72, and 48 h in compost with 40 % moisture and for 240, 72, 24 h in compost with 50 % moisture at the same temperatures, respectively.

40|$|In {{the context}} of the {{development}} of commercially applied high pressure processes it is necessary to evaluate the impact of high pressure on the inactivation of bacterial populations. From the results kinetic models should reliably predict inactivation under dynamic conditions. High pressure processes imply an initial phase of pressure build-up, accompanied by a temperature increase due to adiabatic heating. Since pressure application leads to the generation of heat, the question may arise whether this dynamic p-T profile will influence the spore inactivation. The <b>come-up</b> time (the time needed to reach the constant treatment conditions) is an important variable that needs to be considered in the design and optimization of high hydrostatic pressure processes due to its significant contribution to microbial inactivation. The pressure-temperature inactivation kinetics of Bacillus subtilis var. niger spores was first studied under isobaric-isothermal conditions in the pressure range 50 ï¿½ 400 MPa at temperatures between 25 ï¿½ 70 Â°C. Isobaric-isothermal inactivation of spores appears to follow a fairly linear trend and can be described by a first order model. The kinetic parameters (kref, Ea and DVÂ¹) were calculated at different pressure and temperature levels. Assuming first order kinetics for non-isobaric/non-isothermal inactivation of Bacillus subtilis spores during the <b>come-up</b> time, the integral effect of the inactivation process under dynamic conditions was quantified. To do that, the above mentioned kinetic parameters were used to calculate the inactivation constants as a function of temperature and pressure. The total <b>come-up</b> time was divided in time steps of one second and the inactivation constants were calculated for each seconds time interval. The experimental pressure build-up was carried out in two different ways: (a) fast ï¿½ pressure was developed with the highest possible rate and the <b>come-up</b> time was between 118 and 677 seconds depending on the pressure level of the treatment; (b) slow ï¿½ pressure was built-up with a rate of 20 MPa/min and the <b>come-up</b> time was between 180 and 1337 seconds. The inactivation effects during these <b>come-up</b> times after fast and slow pressure build-up processes were measured and compared with the calculated effects. The comparison reveals an additional inactivation effect on spores due to dynamics of fast pressure build-up. This {{is the first time that}} such an effect has unambiguously been shown...|$|E

Generally, the <b>come-up</b> times and decimal reduction times (D-values) were shorter {{and the change}} in temperature required to change the D-value (z-value) was longer in the aluminum than in the glass tubes. The D-values at 60, 63, and 658 C for the aluminum TDT tubes were 2. 97, 0. 77, and 0. 40 min, respectively, and for the glass TDT tubes, these values were 3. 55, 0. 84, and 0. 41 min. The z-values were 5. 78 C in the aluminum and 5. 38 C in the glass. Because of the shorter <b>come-up</b> time, the aluminum TDT tubes may provide a more precise measurement of microbial thermal inactivation than the glass TDT tubes, particularly for viscous materials, solid foods, and foods containing particulate matter.
