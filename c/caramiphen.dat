40|$|Recently, we {{reported}} that a centrally acting non-narcotic antitussive (cough suppressant drug), tipepidine produces an antidepressant-like effect in the forced swimming test in rats. Because pharmacological properties of tipepidine apparently {{differ from those of}} typical antidepressants developed to date, we speculated that <b>caramiphen,</b> another centrally acting antitussive, has an antidepressant-like effect. That effect of <b>caramiphen</b> was studied in rats using the forced swimming test. <b>Caramiphen</b> at 20 and 40 mg/kg i. p. significantly reduced immobility. At 40 mg /kg i. p., it increased climbing behavior. Even at 40 mg /kg, this drug had no effect on locomotor activity. Results suggest that a centrally acting antitussive possessing inhibition of GIRK channels has an antidepressant-like effect...|$|E
40|$|The {{anticonvulsant}} {{potency of}} a series of structurally-dissimilar compounds which possess nanomolar affinities for high-affinity σ binding sites was examined in the Mg 2 +-free model of epileptiform activity in rat hippocampal slices. Extracellular field potential recordings in the CA 1 region were employed {{to examine the effects of}} test compounds on spontaneous epileptiform activity and multiple population spikes evoked by stimulation of the Schaffer collateral-commissural pathway. Applied at σ site-selective (i. e. nanomolar) concentrations, dextromethorphan, ditolylguanidine, <b>caramiphen</b> and opipramol failed to modify Mg 2 +-free epileptiform activity; neither pro- nor anticonvulsant effects were observed. However, applied at micromolar concentrations, these and additional test compounds reversibly inhibited orthodromically-evoked epileptiform field potentials with a rank order potency (IC 50 values in μM) : dextrorphan (1. 5) >ifenprodil (6. 3) >dextromethorphan (10) >ditolylguanidine (15) >loperamide (28) >carbetapentane (38) >caramiphen (46) >opipramol (52). Micromolar concentrations of the same compounds also inhibited spontaneous epileptiform bursts recorded during perfusion with Mg 2 +-free medium. Co-application of ropizine (10 [*]μM), an allosteric modulator of dextromethorphan binding to high-affinity σ receptors, failed to endow dextromethorphan 10 [*]nM with anticonvulsant properties and did not modify the anticonvulsant potency of 10 [*]μM dextromethorphan. The effects of dextrorphan (10 [*]μM), ifenprodil (20 [*]μM), loperamide (50 [*]μM) and <b>caramiphen</b> (100 [*]μM) were examined in the presence of external Mg 2 + on field potential input/output (I/O) relationships and paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials. Only <b>caramiphen</b> elicited effects on these parameters, affecting synaptic transmission at the point of synaptic transfer and depressing PPF ratios to below baseline values. The effects of <b>caramiphen</b> on I/O relationships mimicked those of the established anticonvulsant adenosine; in contrast, adenosine evoked an increase in PPF ratios. Because anticonvulsant activity was observed only at micromolar concentrations of the σ ligands tested, the results indicate that their anticonvulsant actions should not be ascribed to their occupancy, observed at nanomolar concentrations, of high-affinity σ binding sites. Rather, anticonvulsant activity more likely reflects functional NMDA receptor antagonism and/or blockade of high voltage-activated Ca 2 + channels, effects which are associated with micromolar concentrations of the test compounds. Modulation of GABAergic inhibitory mechanisms may also contribute to the anticonvulsant properties of <b>caramiphen...</b>|$|E
40|$|Soman, a {{powerful}} inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase, causes {{an array of}} toxic effects in {{the central nervous system}} including convulsions, learning and memory impairments, and, ultimately, death. We report on the protection afforded by postexposure antidotal treatments, combined with pyridostigmine (0. 1 mg/kg) pretreatment, against these consequences associated with soman poisoning. Scopolamine (0. 1 mg/kg) or <b>caramiphen</b> (10 mg/kg) were administered 5 min after soman (1. 2 LD 50), whereas TAB (i. e., TMB 4, atropine, and benactyzine, 7. 5, 3, and 1 mg/kg, respectively) was injected in rats concomitant with the development of toxic signs. Atropine (4 mg/kg) was given to the two former groups at the onset of toxic symptoms. <b>Caramiphen</b> and TAB completely abolished electrographic seizure activity while scopolamine treatment exhibited only partial protection. Additionally, no significant alteration in the density of peripheral benzodiazepin...|$|E
40|$|Poisoning by {{organophosphate}} cholinesterase inhibitors {{results in}} a rapid rise in acetylcholine (ACh) in the synapse and many pronounced pharmacological effects in numerous tissues in the body. The treatment for organophosphorus poisoning involves administration of a cholinesterase—reactivating oxime to restore {{the activity of the}} cholinesterase and an antimuscarinic agent to block the response to the excess ACh. Presently atropine is the standard antimuscarinic agent used clinically as an antidote. This research was directed toward finding an antimuscarinic agent better than atropine as an antidote. Since <b>caramiphen</b> and aprophen have been reported to be effective antidotes we synthesized numerous structural variations of these molecules with the aim of enhancing the antimuscarinic and antidotal properties. Many of these compounds showed enhanced antimuscarinic properties. We synthesized analogs of <b>caramiphen</b> which have different substituents in the para position of the phenyl ring. The purpose of the set was to test the effect of different substituents on the antimuscarinic and antidotal activity and to look for any possible relationship of activity with substituent parameters such as Hammett’s sigma (σ) or Hansch’s pi (π) values. Four substituents were selected which have extreme values for sigma and pi in a positive or negative direction, in all combinations. The substituents chosen for use in this approach were the amino (-σ, -π); 1 -‘ tetrazolyl (+σ, -π); l-pyrrolidinyl (-σ, +π); and the trifluoromethyl (+σ, +π). Some N-substituted- 1, 6 -hexanediamines were synthesized to examine the SAR for antimuscarinic and antidotal properties of this series. In a binding assay these compounds showed moderate affinity with a preference for the M 2 receptor subtype. It was determined the bis-quaternary structure was not mandatory for muscarinic activity. The optimum compound of this series was N,N’-dimethyl-N,N’-bis[3 -(2 - phthalimido) propyl]- 1, 6 -hexanediamine. Also, a number of literature and currently manufactured antimuscarinics were obtained. All of the compounds are being screened in a number of in vitro and in vivo assays designed to give information on the SAR for the pharmacological properties which might be important as an antidote. Current information from this research indicates the best antidotes are not the best antimuscarinics in the pharmacological assays. Good central antimuscarinic activity is the primary property of a good antidote, although the antidotal effectiveness of an agent can not be described solely based on its antimuscarinic properties...|$|E
40|$|Pyridostigmine bromide (PYR) {{continues}} to be the predominant pre-treatment for organophosphate nerve agent (NA) exposure. However, its effectiveness is limited by its non-selective inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), as well as its inability to enter the CNS. Physostigmine (PHY), which readily enters the brain and has been reported to be more effective than PYR, has not been widely used due to cholinergic toxicity and a short half life. Scopolamine (SCO) is commonly co-administered with PHY to attenuate cholinergic toxicity. Huperzine A (HUP) and Galantamine (GAL) are two possible pre-treatment candidates. Both enter the CNS and selectively inhibit AChE, which leaves BuChE free to scavenge NAs. The antimuscarinic, <b>Caramiphen</b> (CRM), has inherent anticonvulsant/neuroprotective properties, potentially making it a suitable replacement for SCO. This study compares the tolerability and efficacy of HUP (0. 05 and 0. 25 mg/kg) and GAL (8 mg/kg), alone and in combination with CRM (100 mg/kg), to PHY/SCO (0. 5 / 5. 0 mg/kg) as pre-treatments against soman exposure in guinea pigs. In the tolerability studies, animals received a pre-treatment regimen and were monitored for 7 days for signs of toxicity, body weight changes and blood and brain cholinesterase activity. CRM and 0. 05 mg/kg HUP alone and in combination were the only pre-treatments which did no...|$|E
40|$|Wu, CHAU H. AND TosHlo NARAHASHI: Actions of {{trihexyphenidyl}} and benztropine on squid axon membranes. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 197 : 135 - 141, 1976. Trihexyphenidyl and benztropine have potent local anesthetic {{action on}} squid axon membranes. They suppress the peak transient sodium conductance with EDSO values equal to 1. 75 x 10 -i and 0. 78 x 1 O M, respectively, and shift the sodium conductance curve along the potential axis {{in the direction}} of depolarization by 2. 3 and 8. 7 mV, respectively. The time for the sodium current to attain its peak is shortened. Steady-state potassium conductance is also suppressed by these drugs and undergoes an inactivation which has a potential-dependence characteristic. The local anesthetic action combined with the anticholinergic action may warrant further study of these two drugs, especially trihexyphenidyl, as a potential antiarrhythmic agent. Trihexyphenidyl, benztropine, <b>caramiphen</b> and ethopropazine, commonly used in the symptomatic relief of Parkinson’s disease, have been reported to block the action potential of the squid giant axon (Rosenberg and Bartels, 1967). Trihexyphenidyl and benztropine have also been shown to exert depressive actions on the cardiac tissue. Decreases in the rate of sinus rhythm and conduction velocity were correlated with a reduction in potassium efflux from the rat heart (Langslet, 1970). Although trihexy-phenidyl itself and other derivatives with the same basic structure have never been used in Received for publication June 17, 1974. 1 This work was done during the tenure of a re...|$|E
40|$|Binding of {{dextromethorphan}} (DM) to {{guinea pig}} brain is stereoselective, since levome-thorphan is 20 times weaker than DM in competing for DM sites. In general, opiate agonists and antagonists {{as well as}} their corresponding dextrorotatory isomers are weak competitors for tritiated dextromethorphan ([3 H]DM) binding sites and display ICo values in the micromolar range. In contrast, several non-narcotic, centrally acting anti-tussives are inhibitory in the nanomolar range (ICw values for <b>caramiphen,</b> carbetapen-tane, dimethoxanate, and pipazethate are 25 nM, 9 nii, 41 imi, and 190 n. si, respectively). Other antitussives, such as levopropoxyphene, chiophedianol, and fominoben, have poor affinity for DM sites whereas the antitussive noscapine enhances DM binding by increas-ing the affinity of DM for its central binding sites. Additional competition studies indicate that there is no correlation of DM binding with any of the known or putative neurotrans-mitters in the central nervous system. DM binding is also not related to tricycic antidepressant binding sites or biogenic amine uptake sites. However, certain phenothi-azine neuroleptics and typical and atypical antidepressants inhibit binding with ICo values in the nanomolar range. Moreover, the anticonvulsant drug diphenythydantoin enhances DM binding {{in a manner similar to}} that of noscapine. Preliminary experiments utilizing acid extracts of brain have not demonstrated the presence of an endogenous ligand for DM sites. The binding characteristics of DM sites studied in rat and mouse brain indicate that the relative potencies of several antitussives to inhibit specific DM binding vary according to species. High-affinity, saturable, and stereoselective [3 H]DM binding sites are present in liver homogenates, but several differences have been found for these peripheral binding sites and those described for brain. Although the nature of central DM binding sites is not known, the potent interaction of several classes of centrally acting antitussives with DM sites suggests that they may be related to the mechanism of action of this drug...|$|E
40|$|Neuronal nicotinic {{acetylcholine}} receptors (nAChRs) are {{implicated in}} several {{diseases of the}} central nervous system, including Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. They {{play a role in}} modulating release of neurotransmittors and in the development and intervention of brain seizures and neurodegeneration caused by organophosphate poisoning, a major lethal threat in developing countries. A method was developed to screen drugs for effects on nAChR. The method uses the ratiometric Ca 2 +-probe fura- 2 to measure, {{with the aid of a}} plate reader, nicotine induced responses in the human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY 5 Y. The method was validated using published data for the Alzheimer drug memantine. Drugs that show effects against tremor and brain seizures were characterised, including the Parkinson drugs biperiden, procyclidine, and trihexphenidyl. These drugs all blocked nAChR with an IC 50 in a narrow range from 0. 75 µM to 1. 5 µM. The potencies of the drugs at the nAChR were greater than at the NMDA receptors, implicating a relevance of drug effects on nAChR in the mechanisms of inhibition of seizures. The nAChR block of the drugs were use- and voltage-dependent, features particularly suitable for a drug used to restrain epileptogenic seizures. <b>Caramiphen,</b> a potent antagonist at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, also blocks nAChR with an IC 50 of 0. 3 µM. The novel NMDA-receptor blocker gacyclidine (GK 11) was shown to block the nAChR with an IC 50 of 0. 3 µM for its racemate and 0. 16 µM for the pure (-) -isomer. The novel finding that gacyclidine blocks nAChR makes this receptor a good candidate for the “non-NMDA” binding sites that have been established, but not yet identified, for gacycyclidine. Several novel bis-quarternary pyridine compounds inhibited nAChR with IC 50 values inversely correlated with the length of the carbon chain linker, differing from the relative potencies of the drugs at muscle nAChR. This finding is, because of ganglionic blockade, highly relevant in selecting a suitable candidate to combat organophosphate poisoning...|$|E
