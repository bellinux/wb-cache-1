Since GENESIS-CBA does not allow a partitioned network, a peering-by-necessity relationship is established between x and y.

In order to examine the issues related to this emerging concept, the research methodology was divided in two parts. In the first one, we introduced a longitudinal ethnography research (2005 - 2007) based on participant observation and in-depth interviews with employees in a French business energy supplier called " Utility X. " This choice was the best means to understand how do managers in the energy sector consider their customers: are clients represented as active actors or as passive actors within their own consumption experiences. The second part of this research based on in-depth interviews conducted in 2009, involved a group <b>of</b> 10 <b>customers</b> <b>of</b> " Utility <b>X.</b> " The objective of these interviews was to emphasize the consumer's activation of his competencies in the energy sector.
