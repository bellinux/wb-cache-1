25|$|The {{deadline}} for expressions of interests for Australian franchises was 10 April 2007. In March 2007, Netball Australia chief executive Kate Palmer said the preferred model was for one team each from New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Queensland and Western Australia. In April this was confirmed as {{the composition of}} the league's Australian teams. Netball New South Wales boss Caroline <b>Campbell</b> <b>said</b> that she was disappointed that the Sydney Swifts and the Hunter Jaegers would have to merge. Netball Victoria president Jenny Sanchez said that she had an open mind about whether Victoria would enter one of the two existing teams or a new franchise, but by May 2007, the organisation had chosen to enter a single merged team. Netball ACT also bid for a franchise, but were unsuccessful.|$|E
25|$|On 4 December 1971, the loyalist Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) detonated a {{time bomb}} {{at the door of}} McGurk's public house in Belfast. The pub was frequented by Irish Catholics/nationalists. The {{explosion}} caused the building to collapse, killing fifteen Catholic civilians and wounding seventeen more. It was the deadliest attack in Belfast during the Troubles. The book Killing For Britain (2009), written by former UVF member 'John Black', claims that the MRF organized the bombing and helped the bombers {{get in and out of}} the area. Two days before the bombing, republican prisoners had escaped from nearby Crumlin Road Prison. Security was tightened, and there were many checkpoints in the area at the time. However, locals claimed that the security forces helped the bombers by removing the checkpoints an hour before the attack. One of the bombers—Robert Campbell—said that their original target had been The Gem, a nearby pub that was allegedly linked to the Official IRA. It is claimed the MRF plan was to help the UVF bomb The Gem, and then blame the bombing on the Provisional IRA. This would start a feud between the two IRA factions, diverting them from their fight against the security forces and draining their support. <b>Campbell</b> <b>said</b> that The Gem had security outside and, after waiting for almost an hour, they decided to bomb the nearest 'Catholic pub' instead. Immediately afterward, the security forces claimed that a bomb had accidentally exploded while being handled by IRA members inside McGurk's.|$|E

500|$|Alexander <b>Campbell</b> <b>said</b> {{the goal}} was to [...] "all Bible things by Bible names," [...] which became an early slogan of the Restorationist Movement. [...] These congregations {{generally}} avoid names that associate the church with a particular man (other than Christ) or a particular doctrine or theological point of view (e.g., Lutheran, Wesleyan, Reformed). [...] They believe that Christ established only one church, and that the use of denominational names serves to foster division among Christians. [...] Thomas Campbell expressed an ideal of unity in his Declaration and Address: [...] "The church of Jesus Christ on earth is essentially, intentionally, and constitutionally one." ...|$|E

500|$|According to Cuse, {{the show}} was purposefully set in 1893, exactly 100 years before the series premiered in 1993. Brisco {{is meant to be}} aware of the {{imminent}} changes in society and technology and actively looks for them. The writers of the show, and also the character of Brisco, refer to this concept as [...] "The Coming Thing". Elaborating on this theme, <b>Campbell</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Basically this show is about the turn of the century, when the Old West met the Industrial Era. Cowboys still chew tobacco and ride the range and states are still territories but, over the horizon, is the onset of electricity, the first autos and telephones. Brisco is in the middle of a transition from the past to the future." [...] The collision of cowboy characters with puzzling technology and other anachronisms generates humor throughout the series. The writers made it a point to insert scenes mirroring the pop culture of the 20th century, from the apparent invention of the term [...] "UFO" [...] in the pilot episode to the appearance of a sheriff who looks and acts like Elvis Presley. Speaking about the humor of the show, <b>Campbell</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I would say 30 percent of each episode is being played for laughs. But it's not a winking at the camera, Airplane-type of humor. We're funny like Indiana Jones is funny; the laughs come primarily from the wide variety of ridiculous, colorful characters that come in and out of this series." ...|$|E
500|$|Kelsea Stahler of Hollywood.com {{gave the}} episode a bad review, calling the {{original}} songs [...] "terrible".

It's the last episode we have before the dreaded undetermined hiatus gets underway, and it's Christmas. Let's just cherish the episode for what it is..." [...] Sean <b>Campbell</b> <b>said</b> although he enjoyed the episode's concept, [...] "the execution left much to be desired" [...] and {{that the quality of}} the songs [...] "varied from okay to bad".|$|E
500|$|SF writer Alfred Bester, {{an editor}} of Holiday Magazine and a {{sophisticated}} Manhattanite, recounted at some length his [...] "one demented meeting" [...] with Campbell, a man he imagined from afar to be [...] "a combination of Bertrand Russell and Ernest Rutherford." [...] The first thing <b>Campbell</b> <b>said</b> to him was that Freud was dead, destroyed by the new discovery of Dianetics, which, he predicted, would win L. Ron Hubbard the Nobel Peace Prize. Campbell ordered the bemused Bester to [...] "think back. Clear yourself. Remember! You can remember when your mother tried to abort you with a button hook. You've never stopped hating her for it." [...] Bester commented: [...] "It reinforced my private opinion {{that a majority of}} the science-fiction crowd, despite their brilliance, were missing their marbles." ...|$|E

500|$|Two props of the Orb were made. One of {{the prop}} Orbs {{was used for}} stunts and had {{retractable}} rods. A second version was manufactured from cast bronze, making it heavy: [...] "You really didn't {{want to have to}} handle it", <b>Campbell</b> <b>said.</b> The rocket car seen in the pilot episode was built by special effects coordinator Kam Cooney and was a working vehicle with an internal combustion engine and throttle controls. Some items used in the show had been repurposed from older productions, and some would later be used in other shows. For example, the steam locomotive seen in the pilot episode was the same as the one used in Back to the Future Part III. Two of Carry's prop guns– rifles whose barrels were sawed-off in fashion of the Mare's Leg– were later reused in the science fiction television series Firefly.|$|E
500|$|Green was {{considered}} for roles in The Constant Gardener (a role {{that went to}} Rachel Weisz) and The Black Dahlia. She was cast {{at the last minute}} for the role of Vesper Lynd in the James Bond film Casino Royale (2006). Green was approached in mid-2005 but turned it down. Principal photography was already underway, and director Martin <b>Campbell</b> <b>said</b> casting the role was difficult because [...] "we didn't have the final script and a Bond girl always had the connotation of tits 'n' ass." [...] Campbell saw Green's performance in the director's cut of Kingdom of Heaven, and approached Green again. She read the script, and found the character of Vesper far deeper than most Bond girls. Green's performance was well received: Entertainment Weekly called her the fourth-best Bond girl of all time; IGN named her the best femme fatale, stating, [...] "This is the girl that broke – and therefore made – James Bond"; and she won a BAFTA and an Empire award for her performance. Both awards were voted for by the British public.|$|E
500|$|Bruce Campbell {{went through}} five {{audition}}s {{for the role}} of Brisco before he was hired. In his first audition with the casting director, Campbell spontaneously did a standing flip. The stunt impressed the casting director so much that during each subsequent audition, Campbell was asked to do the flip again. In his final audition, Campbell assured the network executives that if hired for the role, he would work hard to make the show a success. In an interview, <b>Campbell</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "It's every actor's dream to play a cowboy, so when this opportunity came up, I mean, yeah, where do I sign?" [...] He added that working on Brisco provided him with acting opportunities he would not have otherwise had. Cuse said getting Campbell [...] "was just one of those collisions between an actor and a script that was just perfect... I can't imagine Brisco having ever existed without him." [...] Writing in Auxiliary Magazine, Luke Copping claimed that Brisco was Campbell's [...] "last great" [...] role before the actor fell into [...] "a period of self-parody and overt camp that he did not redeem himself from until joining the cast of Burn Notice".|$|E

500|$|Like Pangaea and Dark Magus—the {{two other}} albums {{showcasing}} the septet—Agharta revealed what Amiri Baraka described as Davis' affinity for minimalism. He abandoned melodic and harmonic conventions {{in favor of}} riffs, cross-rhythms, and funk grooves as a backdrop for soloists to improvise throughout. Davis had preferred understated compositions throughout his career but by the mid 1970s he showed a deeper embrace of rhythm, inspired by Afrocentric politics. When Mtume and Cosey joined the band, his live music lost most of its [...] "European sensibilities" [...] and [...] "settled down into a deep African thing, a deep African-American groove" [...] emphasizing rhythm and drums rather than individual solos, Davis said, {{although he did not}} completely reject melody. [...] "We ain't in Africa, and we don't play just chants. There's some theory under what we do." [...] Simon Reynolds, who categorized Agharta as a jazz-rock record, wrote in The Wire that the music [...] "offered a drastic intensification of rock's three most radical aspects: space, timbre, and groove". In Martha Bayles' opinion, it drew from jazz only in its element of free improvisation and from rock only in its use of electronics and [...] "ear-bleeding volume". The album also showcased Davis' avant-garde impulses and exploration of ambient sounds. According to Greg Tate, the septet created [...] "a pan-ethnic web of avant-garde music", while Sputnikmusic's Hernan M. <b>Campbell</b> <b>said</b> they explored [...] "progressive ambiences" [...] particularly within the record's second half; Phil Alexander from Mojo characterized Agharta as [...] "both ambient yet thrashing, melodic yet coruscating", and suggestive of Karlheinz Stockhausen's electronic experiments.|$|E

[...] <b>Campbell</b> <b>said</b> the airstrike was a US decision, made in the US chain of command. In the 15-6 report generated by US Central Command following the strike the military investigators cited General Campbell's own lack of direction and failure in providing proper tactical guidance as contributing factors to the [...] Coalition's command and control breakdown {{leading up to the}} strike.
