40|$|This paper {{addresses}} those {{provisions in}} model BITs relating dispute settlement procedures, particularly provisions under {{the following two}} mechanisms: on the one hand, mechanisms for the settlement of disputes between contracting parties concerning the interpretation or application of the BIT; on the other hand, mechanisms for investor-State dispute settlement. An increasing number of States include in their model BITs precise and detailed procedural provisions, especially as to clauses for the settlement of disputes between the investor and the host State. In this sense, the trend moves towards States introducing flexibility in certain elements of the most <b>common</b> <b>procedural</b> <b>provisions</b> in model BITS. Likewise, the most significant innovations may be appreciated in model BITs of North-American States referring to the promotion of transparency and procedural economy in investor-State arbitration...|$|E

40|$|Part II of the Article {{outlines}} the procedures {{required by the}} APA for agency adjudications. Part III discusses the three primary approaches that courts have followed to determine what triggers formal adjudicatory procedures and introduces the Chevron doctrine. Part IV examines how courts review agency interpretations of statutory provisions under Chevron and its progeny and explores two issues {{on the fringes of}} Chevron 2 ̆ 7 s domain-interpretations of agency jurisdiction and judicial review provisions-and the concerns that they raise. Next, using lessons from these analogous issues, Part V analyzes similar concerns about congressional intent, institutional competency, agency self-interest, and fairness in the <b>procedural</b> <b>provision</b> context. It then advocates for a contextual approach to judicial review, which rejects mandatory deference, and proposes an analytical framework for such review based on factors related to the goals served by procedural formalities. Part V argues that this is the best approach available to provide long-needed guidance to the courts. In Part VI, the Article concludes that courts, not agencies, should be the final interpreters of <b>procedural</b> <b>provisions</b> in enabling statutes...|$|R

40|$|In {{looking at}} the Europeanization of the German Bundestag, the paper brings {{together}} two different debates: the well-established debate on the democratic legitimacy of the European Union sees national Parliaments as guarantor of one branch of a "dual" legitimacy. The more recent debate on "Europeanization" addresses the impacts that European integration has had on its Member States. Analyzing the Europeanization of the German Bundestag, the paper identifies and analyzes three dimensions: legislative Europeanization – {{the extent to which}} legislative decision making by the German Bundestag has been influenced by European stipulations over the last twenty years; institutional Europeanization – how the Bundestag as an institution reacted to this loss of function by establishing institutional and <b>procedural</b> <b>provisions</b> for influencing the government's Euro-politics; and strategic Europeanization – the ways in which individual MPs started more recently to develop euro-political strategies that go beyond controlling the national government. The paper shows that the Bundestag only hesitantly reacted to the increasing loss of functions through legislative Europeanization by establishing effective institutional and <b>procedural</b> <b>provisions</b> for controlling the government's Euro-political activities. What is more, the establishment of institutions does not guarantee their effective use. All in all, Euro- politics continues to remain the activity of few MPs. These few, however, have more recently started to europeanize their strategies. The empirical findings support the claim that the traditional concept of chains of legitimacy is inadequate, both in conceptual and in empirical terms. With regard to the democ- ratic legitimacy of EU governance, this indicates that, apart from major reform projects, especially with regard to everyday legislation, not too great a burden should be placed on national Parliaments...|$|R
40|$|Magister Legum - LLMThe Rome Statute {{established}} the International Criminal Court (ICC). It provides that the Court is complementary to national jurisdictions.

This paper argues that complementarity necessitates the divergence in approach.

Although the mechanisms for control and coordination differ on each regulatory level - the international, supranational, national and sub-national - all levels use private involvement to solve steering problems common in the control of subsidies. The paper takes the view that granting private parties substantial and procedural rights in the procedure is beneficial {{to the public for}} reasons of steering and control of subsidies. On the basis of an intra-level comparison, the paper points out administrative structures and <b>procedural</b> <b>provisions,</b> which enable private parties to have a meaningful involvement in the regulation of subsidiesLaw, EC, WTO, Subsidies, State Aid, Governance, Private Parties. ...|$|R
