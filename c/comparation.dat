50|$|The fancy Palacio Chino {{opened in}} march 29, 1940. It used {{the shell of}} a former ball court, whose space was {{sufficient}} for a big movie theatre. It {{was the only one}} built ever in Mexico in chinese style, but unlike the Grauman’s Chinese, the interior was of the atmospheric type. In 1945 it was listed as having 4000 seats in two levels, orchestra and balcony. It featured a fairly big stage, enough so to hold a symphony orchestra, and indeed was sometimes used as a music theater. Celibidache once directed the National Symphony Orchestra here, as an alternate theater to Bellas Artes, itself the home theater of said orchestra. The inevitable <b>comparation</b> with Grauman’s Chinese stands only as original inspiration goes, because both buildings are very different. The Palacio Chino has a big, traditional flat facade, right in front of Iturbide street. The many windows of this facade are adorned as small pagodas, and there is a big, ornate marquee. The vestibule was spacious and full of chinese decorations, even the ticket boots were rendered as pagodas. The auditorium was of the atmospheric type, with pagodas, temples and gold Buddha statues amid gardens. The ceiling was vault-like, not flat but very arched, and of course was painted deep blue. The screen was protected by a heavy black curtain, with chinese motifs painted upon. The screen arch was very heavily decorated, with dragons appearing here and there.|$|E

Afterwards, two Kundera's main themes - poetry and death - are analyzed. The aim is to prove that their form is almost contradictory in the two novels. It is also suggested, during the analysis of these themes, how their form affects narrative strategy and fiction world of the novels. The main purpose of these <b>comparations</b> is to prove that Immortality stands apart among seven Kunde- ra's novels, so it is not correct to regard seven Kundera's novels as one continuous text...|$|R
