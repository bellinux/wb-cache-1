However, studies found that collaborative {{learning has}} negative aspects as it may cause conflicts and power inequality among members. Given the two sides of collaboration, this study provides a critical investigation on the functions of collaboration in learners' <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation.</b> Through two collaborative corpus analysis sessions, three students of different L 2 proficiency levels assisted each other’s understanding of corpus data to complete group activities. The students’ verbal and nonverbal behaviors during corpus analysis became the main source of investigation, complemented by the results of pre-/post-interviews and the researcher's direct observations. The findings {{of this study suggest that}} collaboration creates significant power inequality among the participants by gradually marginalizing the less capable student in the group from the <b>learning</b> process <b>and</b> increasing the psychological burden for the most capable student. In addition, collaborative work during <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> could impede critical learning opportunities for individual students to pursue personal queries during collaboration. Despite some limitations, the findings of this study provide a realistic picture of collaboration in learners’ <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> <b>and</b> suggest pedagogical implications to corpus-based instruction...|$|R

However, there are only few empirical studies examining the effect of <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> by L 2 learners on improved learning outcomes. ^ The present study investigated the role that <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> plays in the correction of errors via four types of indirect feedback (uncoded indirect feedback only, coded indirect feedback only, uncoded indirect feedback with <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation,</b> <b>and</b> coded indirect feedback with <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation)</b> for lower level Japanese as Foreign Language (JFL) learners. It also examined whether the use of concordance program enhanced accuracy in writing, and whether any effects of indirect feedback with <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> could be retained over a long-term period. Additionally, their perceptions and attitudes toward the <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> were investigated. ^ The results indicated that, in terms of accuracy gain, uncoded/coded indirect feedback with the <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> led to more accurate error correction than uncoded indirect feedback only. Likewise, from the short-term perspective, uncoded feedback with the <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> was significantly more effective than uncoded/coded indirect feedback only. As to long-term effect, however, <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> had a significant positive effect when uncoded indirect feedback was provided on the students 2 ̆ 7 writings. Overall, the JFL learners expressed positive attitudes toward the use of corpus and agreed that it was beneficial to improve their writing skills.

40|$|An {{increasing}} {{number of studies have}} looked at the value of corpus-based data-driven learning (DDL) for second language (L 2) written error correction, with generally positive results. However, a potential conundrum for language teachers involved in the process is how to provide feedback on students’ written production for DDL. The study looks at DDL-mediated error correction across 61 written samples submitted by 32 tertiary students during a series of short DDL courses. Teachers provided feedback on errors present in the samples, and students highlighted corrections made with or without the corpus. The results suggest that students used corpora to correct errors of word choice, word form, collocations and phrasing, but were less likely to use corpora to correct errors of deletion or morphosyntax. When the corpus was used, students were likely to successfully correct errors of collocation but were less successful for errors of morphosyntax. Post-course questionnaires suggested that perception of the usefulness of DDL for grammar learning was less than that for vocabulary <b>and</b> the <b>learning</b> of phrases, <b>and</b> that time and effort spent on analyzing concordance data and understanding the teacher 2 ̆ 7 s feedback on their writing were perceived as difficulties. To explore these findings further, a qualitative analysis of the feedback teachers provided suggests significant difficulties devising appropriate feedback that promotes autonomous, inductive language acquisition for all error types on the one hand, {{and at the same time}} does not eliminate the need for <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> nor is too vague for students to formulate appropriate corpus queries. This study is therefore an initial yet important step in identifying the type of errors that teachers can address in a timely manner with focused feedback leading to <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation,</b> <b>and</b> how such feedback affects the success of this consultation...|$|R

In this talk I will briefly review empirical {{research in the}} field, before focusing on the specific case of France, where such corpus use retains a particularly low profile {{for a variety of}} reasons. My own research in French higher education covers a range of issues. Apart from the obvious questions of how French learners react to <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> <b>and</b> whether it ‘works' in terms of immediate learning outcomes, it is relevant to consider longer term benefits, and how different presentations (e. g. hands-on, paper-based) can be used in different contexts (in class, in the computer room, in distance programmes) and for different purposes (not just for learning the language, but also as a reference resource, for translation, and across other areas of study such as literature and civilisation), as well as for different types of learners (in terms of language ability, <b>learning</b> styles, <b>and</b> specialisation). In all cases, my main aim has been {{to make use of the}} most accessible tools (general purpose, free on-line) and the simplest techniques so that students can, if they wish, continue using corpora on their own after completing the courses. Few would argue that corpora provide miracle solutions in all cases, and individual studies tend to be mitigated in their results – inevitably so, given the infinite number of variables involved. However, the picture that emerges from the research as a whole suggests there are grounds for optimism, and that the multiple affordances of language corpora means that they have something to offer for most teachers and learners...|$|R

40|$|Background: There {{are many}} models of {{consultation}} in educational psychology literature, {{many of which}} provide a practical problem-solving framework or approach. The theory behind these frameworks is not always explicitly linked to what is done <b>and</b> why during <b>consultation.</b> An explicit theory linked to consultee’s <b>learning,</b> behaviour <b>and</b> motivation {{has the potential to}} make <b>consultation</b> <b>and</b> professional <b>learning</b> for staff more purposeful and effective. Aim: The main aim of this research was to explore the use of a theoretical consultation framework called Exceptional Professional Learning (EPL) in educational psychology practice. This research sought to develop a practical framework to implement the theoretical framework during <b>consultation</b> <b>and</b> to investigate the processes/mechanisms used by consultants and consultees to support internalised <b>and</b> sustained <b>learning</b> <b>and</b> motivation. Design: This research used an instrumental multiple-case study design. Consultations took place within four schools to support the implementation of emotion coaching using EPL. The main focus of this research was the implementation of the EPL components (autonomy, relatedness, responsiveness, authenticity <b>and</b> equity) during <b>consultation</b> to investigate the processes and mechanisms that occurred within each setting. <b>Consultations</b> were recorded <b>and</b> transcribed then the framework approach was used to analyse the results in each case study before mapping and interpreting across all case studies. Findings/conclusion: Many processes/mechanisms were consistent across all the case studies, such as the EP actively listening, nurturing relationships, acknowledging, reassuring and containing feelings in the relatedness component. The consultees would empathise, encourage, value one another’s ideas and engage in joint problem solving. Returning to the practical framework it was then possible to structure an EPL consultation session, to link it to theories of <b>learning</b> <b>and</b> motivation through the EPL components and to be clear about the consultant’s and consultee’s role through the processes and mechanisms employed...|$|R

40|$|Aside {{from their}} {{intrinsic}} {{value for the}} purposes of language description, corpora can be used in language courses under the broad umbrella term of "data-driven learning", or DDL (Johns 1990). They {{can be used as a}} teaching aid or learning tool, but also as a reference resource, particularly for writing and revision / error-correction, with an increasing body of empirical evidence (cf. Boulton in press) largely concerning students needing English for academic purposes. Corpora can also be used as a reference resource in translation, and here the DDL-related research focuses largely on translation trainees (e. g. Beeby et al. 2009). However, as Zanettin (2009) points out, translation is also a staple activity in many undergraduate language programmes where learners may also benefit from <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation,</b> <b>and</b> not just to help with the immediate translation assignment. The techniques involved build on many cognitive and metacognitive skills (O'Sullivan 2007), and once mastered, can be applied to other language courses and a variety of future language needs. The main research question in this paper is thus: Can general language corpora be used by non-translation students for translation purposes? The students in this study are enrolled in a translation course in the third year of a degree in English at the distance education centre of a French university. They have no prior experience of corpus use and are expected only to work only with freely available on-line monolingual corpora of contemporary English. The simple interface provided by Mark Davies ([URL] to large corpora of British and American English (100 million and 400 + million words respectively) is widely used for such purposes, with over two thirds of all users declaring their primary interest as language learning, teaching or translation. The sites are suitable for novice users to navigate and are accompanied by tutorials and help features; this is highly desirable in the distance teaching context where face-to-face input is not an option, and means that the course itself can keep the introduction to the basic concepts and techniques to a minimum. After that, the constraints of the distance context play to the strengths of constructivism as the students explore the corpora on their own; though email contact with the teacher is possible, and there are discussion forums to facilitate peer-to-peer collaboration, these are generally under-used. Following an earlier pilot study, the results presented here are based on on-line examinations where the methodology component requires the students to choose sections of a previously unseen text and demonstrate and explain how they use corpora to solve the problems encountered in context. Comparing data from two sessions shows how the students come to grips with corpora for translation, and allows a qualitative analysis of individual performance on the various techniques used with greater or lesser success. These data are backed up by questionnaires submitted after the examinations to gain feedback from both successful and less successful students. Particular attention is accorded to corpus use beyond the usual concordance lines, including frequencies, register distributions, collocates lists, word comparisons, and so on, which allow the learner to ask not just 'can I say this?', but 'is this appropriate in this translation context?'...|$|R

This education thesis is about a community-based partnership study that applies the Aterihwihsón:sera Kaswénta (Two Row Wampum) as a relational framework to investigate how two Indigenous communities across the world— the Carcross/Tagish First Nation (C/TFN) in Yukon, Canada and the Narungga Community of Point Pearce (NCPP) in South Australia—can create and implement online tools to support consultation processes compatible with Indigenous legal traditions, and facilitate more meaningful, equitable, <b>and</b> effective <b>consultations.</b> In total, 64 participants from the two aforementioned communities/countries took part in this study. Thematic content analysis of this data, along with literature, participant observation, and digital ethnography revealed {{that there is an}} overall lack of consultation with the C/TFN, NCPP, and other Indigenous communities. Moreover, it found that existing consultations tend to be ambiguous, fraught with process breakdowns, tokenistic, colonizing, oppressive, ineffective, and lacking community engagement. While the study suggests that technology can be an important tool (in addition to in-person meetings) in <b>consultations,</b> <b>and</b> several leading practices were identified, the key finding is that the most significant determining factor of the meaningfulness of consultations is relationships. Within the Kaswénta framework, a relationship-based approach is characterized by three interconnected principles: 1) equality, 2) distinction and self-determination, and 3) harmonious, and interdependent co-existence. Time was also shown to be an important element.

The analysis of the results reveals a significant number of changes made by the learners which may be classified as follows in order of frequency: grammatical errors (gender and agreement, prepositions, verb forms/mood, negation and syntax); misspellings, accents and hyphens; lexico- grammatical patterning (native language interference, choice of verb and inappropriate vocabulary); and capitalisation. The conclusion notes that the situation in which these students found themselves (i. e. faced with a text on which the teacher had indicated phrases which could be improved) is replicated in many cases every day, <b>and</b> suggests that <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> may have a useful role to play in the context of interactive feedback, particularly in cases where traditional language learning resources are of little use.
