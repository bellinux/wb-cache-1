50|$|After failing the {{entrance}} exams twice {{and becoming a}} second-year rōnin (a high school student who did not pass the college entrance exams), his parents kick {{him out of his}} house, forcing him to move into his grandmother Hinata's home in Hinata City (Hinata-shi), a hot-springs village in Kanagawa Prefecture overlooking Sagami Bay. Hinata's residence is a hotel called the Hinata House, located at 1 Hinata Street; what he does not know at this time is that the hotel had been converted into a girls-only dormitory. Despite an embarrassing and painful run with the residents which almost forces him to leave, he stays upon finding out that Hinata has given him the title and deed to the Hinata establishment. As the new landlord and manager, he must oversee and maintain the residence, a fact which upsets the girls. Even though the girls {{think of him as a}} pervert, over time he wins them over with his good-natured personality and constant perseverance even under dire pressure. Whereas in the anime he has a skill for drawing, particularly women, in the manga his main specialty is <b>cooking</b> <b>chocolate</b> dishes; he even boasted in the second volume that his skill can easily match that of any real chef's. One of his favorite hobbies is collecting photobooth pictures, which are, however, almost only of himself (except for two of him with Naru).|$|E

5000|$|Once more, as in Chocolat, Harris uses food as {{a metaphor}} both for {{tolerance}} and acceptance. It {{also serves as a}} means of entering another culture on a very basic level. In Harris' books, a gift of food is often an expression of affection, and Vianne's <b>cooking</b> (and her <b>chocolates)</b> serve as a means of breaking down inhibitions and inviting confidences. In an interview with the New Zealand Herald, she says: [...] "It's like the first elementary contact. It doesn't necessarily offer a vast amount of understanding, but it's the first contact with a culture because it's something that everybody can understand. It's not like a language that you have to learn or a culture that you have to buy into. It's a simple way of offering or accepting hospitality. It's the first few stumbling phrases in something that will later become a dialogue."http://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&objectid=10815381 ...|$|R

40|$|Catherine Hoffmann’s Free Lunch {{with the}} Stench Wench is a {{performance}} of abjection and self-abjection through poverty with an apotropaic aspiration: to shed the shame through sharing, and to create opportunities for a common social subjectivity that refuses to be silent about the struggle of its own creation and maintenance. Despite its title, Free Lunch does not come with a free lunch for the audience but creates an olfactory situation, through the on-stage <b>cooking</b> of hot <b>chocolate</b> {{and the presence of}} a dead rat, which compliments Hoffman’s narration and stage presence into a synaesthetic portrait of poverty and its psychosocial fallout. Drawing on the psychological foundations of shame studies, sociological approaches and social-theoretical responses to austerity and social division, I propose to examine the gendered embodiment of shame and its exorcism in Hoffmann’s performance, focusing on its physical codification in and beyond the visual. I explore the potential of shame to be re-weaponised against those who originally inflict it, and consider the shame that haunts every creative act, especially those with high political stakes: the failure to make a connection, the fear of being misunderstood...|$|R

40|$|This diploma {{thesis is}} focused on the problem of {{volatile}} aroma active compounds in chocolate, directly connected with the formation of chocolate aroma. Organoleptic properties of chocolate (aroma and taste) are the most important for evaluating by consumers. In this work four types of plain chocolate: Figaro Sweet Passion 70 % cacao, Figaro plain <b>chocolate,</b> Figaro for <b>cooking</b> and KAUMY <b>chocolate</b> glaze were tested. SPME method (fiber CAR/PDMS 85 µm) in conjunction with gas chromatography was chosen for their analysis. Solid phase micro-extraction (SPME) is simple, sensitive, reproducible, rapid and low-cost method for evaluation of key odorant compounds found in cocoa and chocolate products. Using SPME-GC method total 56 aromatic compounds: 14 acids, 9 aldehydes, 8 ketones, 17 alcohols, 7 esters and 1 nitrogen compound were identified and quantified. Taste and aroma are the most important for evaluating of chocolate by consumer. Taste and aroma should be aromatic, pleasant and after used raw material. The single organoleptic properties (appearance, colour, taste, aroma and texture) were observed by sensory analysis using scale and also aroma and taste profiles of samples were created. The assessors were students and staffs faculty of chemistry BUT. The high content of alcohols (methanol, ethanol, propanol, butan- 2, 3 -diol) and fatty acids was found in all types of chocolate, these compounds are probably important components of chocolate aroma. Some detected aromatic compounds doesn´t contribute positively to typical chocolate aroma. Unpleasant odour of these compounds often influences total flavour of chocolate, which was also proved by sensory evaluating...|$|R
