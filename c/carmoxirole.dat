40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>carmoxirole,</b> a {{presynaptic}} dopamine (DA 2) receptor agonist, on blood pressure, plasma catecholamines, renin-aldosterone and {{atrial natriuretic peptide}} and the intracellular concentration and transmembrane fluxes of Na+ and K+, in erythrocytes and platelets was studied in 24 normal men, using a double-blind, parallel study design. After a run-in period of 1 week, the subjects were treated with either placebo (n = 8) or 0. 5 mg <b>carmoxirole</b> (n = 16) once daily for 1 week. Blood pressure and heart rate were not changed during <b>carmoxirole</b> administration in these normal men. Surprisingly, no significant effect of <b>carmoxirole</b> {{was found on the}} circulating plasma concentration of noradrenaline, adrenaline or dopamine. Other hormones such as renin, aldosterone and atrial natriuretic peptide were also not changed during <b>carmoxirole</b> administration. No significant effect of <b>carmoxirole</b> could be demonstrated on the intracellular concentration of Na+, K+, Mg 2 + and Ca 2 + and on the transmembrane fluxes of Na+ and K+ in erythrocytes and platelets. In the carmoxirole-treated subjects (n = 16), 6 subjects reported spontaneously adverse events such as syncope, dizziness and vomiting tendencies and/or fatigue. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Dopamine DA 2 -receptor {{activation}} inhibits noradrenaline {{release in}} human kidney slices. Dopamine receptor modulation of noradrenaline release from renal sympathetic nerves was investigated. Human kidney slices were incubated with 3 H-noradrenaline, placed into superfusion chambers between two platinum electrodes and field-stimulated at 5 Hz. The slices accumulated radioactivity. Pretreatment of the kidney slices with 6 -hydroxy-dopamine (1. 2 mM) {{prior to the}} 3 H-noradrenaline incubation reduced the accumulation of radioactivity. The stimulation induced (S-I) outflow of radioactivity was mainly composed of intact 3 H-noradrenaline. The sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin (1 µM), 6 -hydroxy-dopamine pretreatment and omission of calcium from the superfusion solution abolished S-I outflow of radioactivity. The DA 1 -receptor agonist fenoldopam (SKF 82526; 0. 01 and 0. 1 µM) did not alter but fenoldopam (1 µM) increased S-I outflow of radioactivity. However, {{in the presence of}} either the non-selective α-adrenoceptor antagonist phentolamine (1 µM) or the selective α 2 -adrenoceptor antagonist idazoxan (1 µM) fenoldopam (1 µM) had no effect. The DA 2 -receptor agonist quinpirole (LY 171555; 1 µM) inhibited S-I outflow of radioactivity, an effect blocked by the selective DA 2 -receptor antagonists S(-) -sulpiride (10 µM) and domperidone (0. 3 µM) but unaltered either by the DA 1 -receptor antagonist SCH 23390 (1 µM) or by phentolamine (1 µM). The α 2 -adrenoceptor agonist UK 14304 (0. 1 µM) inhibited S-I outflow of radioactivity, and this effect was blocked by phentolamine (1 µM) and idazoxan (1 µM) but unaltered by S(-) -sulpiride (10 µM). Phentolamine and idazoxan, in contrast to S(-) -sulpiride, domperidone and SCH 23390, enhanced S-I outflow of radioactivity by themselves. The DA 2 -receptor agonist <b>carmoxirole</b> (EMD 45609; 0. 03 µM) inhibited S-I outflow of radioactivity but <b>carmoxirole</b> (0. 003 and 0. 3 µM) did not. However, in the presence of phentolamine <b>carmoxirole</b> (0. 3 and 0. 03 µM) inhibited S-I outflow of radioactivity to a similar extent. Moreover, in the presence of idazoxan <b>carmoxirole</b> (0. 3 µM) also inhibited S-I outflow of radioactivity. The inhibitory effect of <b>carmoxirole</b> (0. 03 µM) was blocked by S(-) -sulpiride (10 µM) but not by SCH 23390 (1 µM). The data suggest that activation of prejunctional DA 2 -receptors by either quinpirole or <b>carmoxirole</b> (0. 03 µM) inhibits noradrenaline release in human kidney cortex. The inhibitory DA 2 -receptor mediated effect of <b>carmoxirole</b> (0. 3 µM) seems to be masked by simultaneous blockade of prejunctional inhibitory α-autoreceptors. There is no evidence that activation of DA 1 -receptors modulates noradrenaline release. Endogenous noradrenaline, in contrast to endogenous dopamine, seems to activate its respective prejunctional receptor system, since phentolamine and idazoxan but neither S(-) -sulpiride nor domperidone enhanced S-I outflow of radioactivity...|$|E
