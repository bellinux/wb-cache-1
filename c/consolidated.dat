40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{illustrate}} Serbia’s democratic development on the basis of <b>consolidate</b> democratic perspective. Linz & Stepan´s five arenas (political, civil, economic, legal and bureaucratic) are required for the possibility to become a <b>consolidate</b> democracy. In order to fulfil the aim, I have chosen to focus on the political and civil arenas that are most central in the study of <b>consolidate</b> democracy. The {{purpose of this}} study is to process how far Serbia has come towards a <b>consolidate</b> democracy and which obstacles still remain in the transition. The questions in this study are: • What problems has Serbia faced since the democratic transition in the beginning of 1990 ? • What possibilities are there for Serbia to <b>consolidate</b> the democracy, with focus on the two key arenas of consolidation? By applying the theoretical framework to the data, I have been able to present answers and build up an analysis. As the analysis shows, Serbia has come a long way since the transition faze. Still there are a lot obstacles and further improvements are necessary before the country can finish the transition faze and become a <b>consolidate</b> democracy.
