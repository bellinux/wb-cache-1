It first introduces the topic and then considers the juridical basis of subrogation. It also attempts to sketch the historical origins and derivation of the modern law of subrogation. Subrogation is generally divided into two categories by civilian and American writers, namely legal subrogation and <b>contractual</b> <b>subrogation.</b> Irish and English courts have not always been careful to make it clear which category they were applying. This has led to considerable confusion and controversy as to the relevance of intention to subrogation.

This thesis disputes the universal application of the ?restitutionary hypothesis. ...|$|E
