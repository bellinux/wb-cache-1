5|$|The König-class {{ships were}} 174.7m long at the waterline, and 175.4m long overall. With {{a beam of}} 29.5m, a forward draft of 9.19m and a rear draft of 9.0m, the Königs were {{designed}} to displace 25,796metric tons normally, but at full <b>combat</b> <b>load,</b> they displaced 28,600tons. The hulls were constructed with transverse and longitudinal steel frames, over which the outer hull plates were riveted. The ships' hulls each contained 18 watertight compartments, each equipped with a double bottom that ran for 88% {{of the length of}} the hull.|$|E
25|$|LST-22 {{participated in}} the Cape Gloucester landings, New Britain {{at the end of}} December 1943 and January 1944. After {{beaching}} at Cape Gloucester on 26 December 1943, the ship underwent its first enemy air raid. Returning to Goodenough Island, another <b>combat</b> <b>load</b> was taken to Saidor, New Guinea, beaching there on 2 January 1944.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} replace the elderly F1CRs of 2/33s, a number of Rafales were {{outfitted}} with an advanced reconnaissance pod. The Rafale's range, maneuverability and <b>combat</b> <b>load</b> is far superior to the F1CR that it replaces, {{as well as its}} reconnaissance capabilities: after the Rafale's pod has taken photographs, these can be almost instantly transmitted back to its base or where the imagery would be required if provisioned with compatible down link equipment. The French Air Force's last Mirage F1 fighters were retired from operational service on 13 June 2014. The last units in service, these being 11 single-seat Mirage F1CRs and three two-seat F1Bs were transferred to storage; six aircraft performed a final appearance in a flypast during Bastille Day celebrations over Paris prior to their disposal.|$|E
50|$|Night {{and weapons}} {{training}} and field craft involving 20 km treks with 60 kg loads and live ammunition are conducted. Weekly forced marches with 65 kg <b>combat</b> <b>loads</b> with distances over 80 km to 130 km and quarterly night drops with full <b>combat</b> <b>loads</b> are also conducted.|$|R
50|$|<b>Combat</b> <b>loading</b> is {{a special}} type of unit loading of ships so that {{embarked}} forces will have immediately needed weapons, ammunition and supplies stowed {{in such a way}} that unloading of equipment will be concurrent with the force personnel and available for immediate combat during an amphibious landing. It gives primary consideration to the ease and sequence with which troops, equipment, and supplies can be unloaded ready for combat, rather than to the efficient use of cargo space as in convoy loading where forces and equipment would be joined in rear or secure areas. The art and science of <b>combat</b> <b>loading</b> were developed in World War II, and contributed greatly to the success of Allied amphibious campaigns. While <b>combat</b> <b>loading</b> usually took place in forward bases, the Western Task Force for the landings in North Africa was <b>combat</b> <b>loaded</b> at the Army's Hampton Roads Port of Embarkation which was called on again for the Sicily force.|$|R
50|$|<b>Combat</b> <b>loading</b> {{normally}} {{requires the}} use of each of these methods, with the vertical and block method predominating.|$|R
25|$|Module 1 assesses a candidate's {{level of}} {{physical}} fitness, motivation and suitability to progress on towards further modules (2-5) of the SOFQ course {{similar to the}} previous selection course. Candidates must pass a series of fitness assessments, map reading and individual navigation assessments, claustrophobia, water confidence, and psychometric testing. The final phase of Module 1 includes individual navigation exercises with set weights over unknown distances and completion times which can be over 250km, culminating in an additional 65km cross-country march carrying a 65lb <b>combat</b> <b>load</b> in the Dublin & Wicklow mountain range. On average candidates get between four and five hours sleep per a night. Officer and senior NCO candidates are subjected to separate, rigorous scrutiny of their planning and decision-making skills to determine the suitability. The length of Module 1 is 3 weeks similar to the previous selection course length. Typically 85% of candidates fail Module 1. Between 2000 and 2005, approximately 240 attempted selection, including a female, with 50 successful.|$|E

5000|$|Joint {{exercises}} in 1941 {{resulted in a}} decision that the Navy {{would be responsible for}} providing the transports for joint operations against enemy resistance. As the war progressed specialized types of ships were developed for the United States Navy, generally termed combat loaders, and specifically designated APA (transport, attack), and AKA (cargo ship, attack). Army doctrine, after some discussion as to whether the port commander or force commander should be responsible, settled on the commander of the landing force being responsible for <b>combat</b> <b>loading</b> Army forces. <b>Combat</b> <b>loading</b> for Army in the Pacific was organized under the Army Port and Service Command as directed by force commanders. Navy Attack cargo ships were assigned a specially-trained Marine Corps officer called the [...] "transport quartermaster" [...] or [...] "combat cargo officer" [...] to oversee their proper <b>combat</b> <b>loading.</b>|$|R
50|$|Like all AKAs, {{they were}} {{designed}} to carry <b>combat</b> <b>loaded</b> military cargo and landing craft, and to use the latter to land weapons, supplies, and troops on enemy shores during amphibious operations.|$|R

500|$|The {{two ships}} of the Leipzig class were not identical, {{prompting}} some naval historians to classify them as separate designs, {{rather than as}} a ship class.

40|$|This report {{describes}} firings of the A- 10 /GAU- 8 {{weapon system}} against individual <b>combat</b> <b>loaded</b> Soviet main battle tanks. The pilots making the firing passes attacked at low altitude and corresponding low dive angles simulating movement through a hostile air defense system. Ammunition {{used in the}} attacks comprised 30 mm armor piercing incendiary rounds, which proved to be effective damage agents against substantial areas of the Soviet T- 62 tanks used as targets. The pilots in six successful firing passes (one additional pass resulted in a miss) scored 95 impacts on target, which included 17 perforations through the armored envelope. The six tanks which were impacted received damage physically assessed as ranging from catastrophic {{in the case of}} two <b>combat</b> <b>loaded</b> vehicles to negligible in the case of one tank attacked directly from the front.

50|$|When a ship is <b>combat</b> <b>loaded,</b> {{each item}} must be stored {{so it can}} be {{unloaded}} at a time and in a sequence that will most effectively support the planned activities ashore. Whenever possible, the loading scheme must also provide flexibility to accommodate changes in the tactical plan, and to allow access to cargo that is required to meet emergency calls for equipment or supplies.|$|R
5|$|Because of {{a design}} flaw, ships of this class have {{inherent}} lists to starboard when under <b>combat</b> <b>loads</b> that exceed {{the capability of}} their list control systems. The problem appears to be especially prevalent {{on some of the}} more modern vessels. This problem has been previously rectified by using damage control voids for ballast, but a solution using solid ballast which does not affect the ship's survivability has been proposed.|$|R
