Abstract Fractional Cattaneo-Christov flux model {{is used in}} analyzing the anomalous diffusion in <b>comb</b> <b>frame</b> subject to finite length of fingers. Formulated governing equation contains Dirac delta function and mixed partial derivatives. Solutions are obtained by numerical discretization method where the time fractional derivative of order α in (0, 1] is approximated by L 1 -scheme. The correctness of numerical method is verified by introducing a source item to construct an exact solution. Results show that, when there exists relaxation, the particles distribution displays a parabolic feature with the spatial evolution at small times while a hyperbolic feature appears with a larger relaxation parameter at large times, the particles distribution and {{the total number of}} particles on x axis are oscillating with the temporal evolution. Moreover, the effects of involved parameters on dynamic characteristics are graphically analyzed and discussed in detail.

5000|$|Langstroth hives {{make use}} of bee space so that frames are neither glued {{together}} nor filled with burr comb: <b>comb</b> joining adjacent <b>frames.</b> They use standardized sizes of hive bodies (rectangular boxes without tops or bottoms placed {{one on top of}} another) and internal frames to ensure that parts are interchangeable and that the frames will remain relatively easy to remove, inspect, and replace without killing the bees. Langstroth hive bodies are rectangular in shape and can be made from a variety of materials that can be stacked to expand the usable space for the bees. Inside the boxes, frames are hung parallel to each other. The minimum size of the hive is dependent on outside air temperature and potential food sources in the winter months. The colder the winter, the larger the hive and food stores need to be. In regions with severe winter weather, a basketball-shaped cluster of bees typically survives in a [...] "double-deep" [...] box. In temperate and equatorial regions, a winter cluster will survive in a single box or in a [...] "nuc" [...] (short for nucleus colony).Langstroth frames are thin rectangular structures made of wood or plastic and typically have a wax or plastic foundation on which the bees draw out the <b>comb.</b> The <b>frames</b> hold the beeswax honeycomb formed by the bees. Ten frames side by side will fill the hive body and leave the right amount of bee space between each frame and between the end frames and the hive body.|$|R
5000|$|Blending {{is done by}} blending, or {{averaging}} consecutive {{fields to}} be displayed as one <b>frame.</b> <b>Combing</b> is avoided because the images are {{on top of each}} other. This instead leaves an artifact known as ghosting. The image loses vertical resolution and temporal resolution. This is often combined with a vertical resize so that the output has no numerical loss in vertical resolution. The problem with this {{is that there is a}} quality loss, because the image has been downsized then upsized. This loss in detail makes the image look softer. Blending also loses half the temporal resolution since two motion fields are combined into one frame.|$|R
50|$|A top-bar hive is a single-story {{frameless}} beehive {{in which}} the comb hangs from removable bars. The bars form a continuous roof over the <b>comb,</b> whereas the <b>frames</b> in most current hives allow space for bees to move up or down between boxes. Hives that have frames or that use honey chambers in summer but which use similar management principles as regular top-bar hives are sometimes {{also referred to as}} top-bar hives. Top-bar hives are rectangular in shape and are typically more than twice as wide as multi-story framed hives commonly found in English speaking countries. Top-bar hives usually include one box only, and allow for beekeeping methods that interfere very little with the colony.|$|R

The book is intended for readers interested in low-dimensional topology, and some familiarity with the basics is assumed.

40|$|Fraunhofer IPMS already {{demonstrated}} a technol. for resonant 2 D MEMS scanning mirrors, where the resonant driving principle {{has been established}} for mirror and frame. Using frequencies of 2500 Hz for the frame and 28 kHz for the mirror full color laser projection systems have been developed. Multiple Lissajous patterns are needed for the generation of one picture. Thus efficiency and frame rate are limited. Recently, a new approach has been invented: still a resonantly moving mirror {{is used for the}} fast movement but the frame is driven by a quasi-static drive. Among the several driving mechanisms possible the piezoelec. drive is the most promising. By choosing appropriate piezoelec. materials MEMS process integration is feasible. Besides a quasi-static deviation to generate pictures further options arise. The picture generation algorithm can be simplified if the movement along the rows is stepwise and the movement back is one fast step. This saw tooth like motion could be achieved through the high frequency response of piezoelec. materials. The setup of the chip is similar to the existing 2 d scanning mirrors: Inside the mirror with an area of 0. 25 to 9 mm 2 is mounted on two spring bearings to the frame and resonantly driven through <b>comb</b> structures. The <b>frame</b> bearing to the chip is realized through flat bending actuators. Either the position change has to be considered at the picture generation or a layout has to be designed in a way that ensures a Pivot point {{in the middle of the}} mirror...|$|R
