5|$|In {{defense of}} the text's authenticity, Ariel Shisha-Halevy, Professor of Linguistics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and a leading expert on Coptic language, {{concluded}} that the language itself offered no evidence of forgery. King also found examples from a new discovery in Egypt that has {{the same kind of}} grammar, showing that at least one unusual <b>case</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> unique. While some experts continue to disagree about the other case, King notes that newly discovered texts often feature grammatical or spelling oddities which expand our understanding of the Coptic language.|$|E

25|$|The Swiss courts {{began their}} own {{investigation}} with information from Argentine deputies Garrido and Ocaña; however, Switzerland required {{input from the}} Argentine judiciary to pursue the case. Le Matin and Tages-Anzeiger reported the ongoing Argentine controversy, and public opinion opposed illicit money in Swiss banks. However, the Swiss <b>case</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> {{directly related to the}} Argentine one. Casanello and prosecutor Marijuan were invited to Switzerland to confer with local judges, but their trip was cancelled.|$|E
25|$|If the <b>case</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> settled {{following}} {{issuance of}} a complaint, then {{the case will}} proceed to hearing before an Administrative Law Judge of the NLRB.

25|$|Another {{model that}} has been put forth is the incentive-motivation model. The model {{explains}} that the desire for sex comes from an interaction between a sensitive sexual response system and stimuli that {{are present in the}} environment. Researchers argue that this model supports the idea that sexual desire is not spontaneous. Furthermore, this model implies that the <b>case</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> that one has sex because one feels sexual desire; rather, the case is that one feels sexual desire because one has sex.|$|E
25|$|The Hevajra Tantra {{has some}} {{material}} {{in common with}} other sources: II iii 29 of the Hevajratantra {{is the same as}} XVI 59c-60b of the Guhyasamajatantra, and an Apabhraṃśa couplet at II v 67 of the Hevajratantra appears in one of Saraha's songs. In the case of the Guhyasamaja, it is safe to assume that the Hevajra version is later, but the <b>case</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> as clear cut with the Saraha quote, since the relative dates are harder to establish with any certainty.|$|E
25|$|Rules {{three and}} five of the {{avoidance}} doctrine thus echo concerns addressed by the constitutional and prudential limitations of standing and ripeness. In some cases, the tenets of the avoidance doctrine addressed above— rules 1, 2, 3 and 5— may serve to buttress the conclusion that a <b>case</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> justiciable, or that a case is justiciable but the court will voluntarily decline to exercise its jurisdiction for prudential reasons. The avoidance doctrine {{as set out in}} these rules functions primarily as a supplement to established doctrines of standing and ripeness.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to affixation, Igbo exhibits both partial and full reduplication to form gerunds from verbs. The partial form copies {{on the initial}} consonant and inserts a high front vowel, while the full form copies the first consonant and vowel. Both types are then prefixed with o-. For example, -go 'buy' partially reduplicates to form ògigo 'buying,' and -bu 'carry' fully reduplicates to form òbubu 'carrying. Some other noun and verb forms also exhibit reduplication, but because the reduplicated forms are semantically unpredictable, reduplication in their <b>case</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> synchronically productive, and they are better described as separate lexical items.|$|E
25|$|Gorsuch {{wrote his}} first U.S. Supreme Court {{decision}} for a unanimous court in Henson v. Santander Consumer USA Inc., 582 U.S. ___ (2017). Gorsuch and the Court ruled against the borrowers, holding that Santander in this <b>case</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a debt collector under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act since they purchased the original defaulted car loans from CitiFinancial for pennies on the dollar, making Santander {{the owner of}} the debts and not merely an agent. When the act was enacted, regulations were put on institutions that collected other companies' debts, but the act left unaddressed businesses collecting their own debts.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, a Tennessee court granted {{guardianship}} of a {{child to}} her grandmother and step-grandfather after the child's mother April Divilbiss and partners outed themselves as polyamorous on MTV. After contesting the decision for two years, Divilbiss eventually agreed to relinquish her daughter, acknowledging that {{she was unable to}} adequately care for her child and that this, rather than her polyamory, had been the grandparents' real motivation in seeking custody. The Tennessee <b>case</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> necessarily normative for the entirety of the United States, since family law varies significantly from state to state. U.S. state law is, of course, not normative for laws of other countries.|$|E

25|$|The {{examining}} magistrate then presents the dossier detailing {{his or her}} findings {{to the president of}} the bench that will adjudicate on the case where it has been decided that a trial shall be conducted. Therefore, the president of the bench's view of the <b>case</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> neutral and may be biased while conducting the trial after the reading of the dossier. Unlike the common law proceedings, the president of the bench in the inquisitorial system is not merely an umpire and is entitled to directly interview the witnesses or express comments during the trial, as long as he or she does not express his or her view on the guilt of the accused.|$|E
25|$|The County Courts Act 1984 {{permitted}} the High Court to transfer {{any part of}} a High Court case to the County Courts {{in one of three}} situations; firstly if the parties consent, secondly where the High Court believes the amount in dispute is below the maximum amount the County Court is allowed to deal with and thirdly where the High Court believes that the <b>case</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> likely to raise any important question of law. Before the passing of the Courts and Legal Services Act, around 13,000 cases were transferred to the County Courts each year in this way. The Act changed the system so that the High Court has a discretionary power to transfer any proceedings to the County Courts.|$|E
25|$|While on harbor patrol, McNulty {{spots the}} body of a dead woman in the water. When Rawls argues the <b>case</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> in his jurisdiction, McNulty, spends three hours poring over wind and tide charts to prove the death {{occurred}} within city limits. When port authority officer Beadie Russell finds thirteen dead women in a shipping container on the Baltimore docks, McNulty again intervenes and, {{with the help of the}} medical examiner, proves that the deaths were not accidental: the air pipe to the container was deliberately closed off, and, with the help of a mining engineer, they are able to prove that the ship was within the city limits when it happened. The case is given to Bunk and Lester, who don't look forward to investigating these difficult cases.|$|E

25|$|The rule in Rylands v. Fletcher {{will not}} cover cases of harm to persons within the {{premises}} where the inherently dangerous activity is carried out, {{for the rule}} requires escape of the thing, which causes harm from the premises. The new rule makes no distinction between the persons within the premises where the enterprise is operating or and persons outside the premises because escape of the thing causing harm from the premises is not {{a necessary condition for}} the applicability of the rule. Further, the rule in Rylands v. Fletcher, though strict {{in the sense that it}} is not dependent on any negligence on the part of the defendant and in this respect similar to the new rule, is not absolute as it is subject to many exceptions but the new rule in Mehta’s <b>case</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> only strict but absolute and is subject to no exception.|$|E
25|$|The 'effective control' {{test for}} {{attribution}} {{established in the}} Nicaragua <b>case</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> suitable to questions of State responsibility for international crimes committed with a common purpose. The 'overall control' test for attribution established in the Tadić case is more appropriate when the commission of international crimes is the common objective of the controlling State and the non-State actors. The Court's refusal to infer genocidal intent from a consistent pattern of conduct in Bosnia and Herzegovina is inconsistent with the established jurisprudence of the ICTY. The FRY's knowledge of the genocide set to unfold in Srebrenica is clearly established. The Court should have treated the Scorpions as a de jure organ of the FRY. The statement by the Serbian Council of Ministers {{in response to the}} massacre of Muslim men by the Scorpions amounted to an admission of responsibility. The Court failed to appreciate the definitional complexity of the crime of genocide and to assess the facts before it accordingly.|$|E
25|$|However, in {{addition}} to his virtuosity as a keyboard performer and composer, Bull was also skilled at getting into trouble. In 1597 his appointment to Gresham College required him to obey the committee's ordinances, lodge at Gresham House, and give an inaugural lecture during the second week of June {{in the presence of the}} mayor, the aldermen, the Bishop of London and the master and warden of the Mercers Company. Fearful of losing his readership because his assigned rooms were still occupied by Thomas Gresham's stepson, William Reade, he forced an entry to the rooms by engaging a mason to help him break down a wall, which led to an action against Bull in Star Chamber. The outcome of this <b>case</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> known. Ten years later, he was forced to leave his post at Gresham College on 20 December 1607, after he fathered a child pre-maritally with an Elizabeth Walter, thus losing his best source of income as well as his quarters. Even though he filed a petition for a marriage licence two days after he lost his job, he never returned to the college. He married Elizabeth Walter in 1607, by whom he had a daughter.|$|E
