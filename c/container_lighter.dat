The design uses Kevlar, foam and aluminum, as in previous designs, {{but with a}} different configuration that makes the <b>container</b> <b>lighter,</b> stronger and more rigid. The results of finite element analysis are presented, consisting in the deformations due to temperature changes and to weight, and in the security factor for each material when maximum constraints are applied. Tilt rigidity is also analyzed. They show that the composite material construction technique gives a good performance up to 6 meter diameters.

50|$|In {{response}} {{to the need for}} greater improved movement of bulk liquids, tank containers were invented in the mid 1960 by Bob Fossey who worked for Wiliams Fairclough in London. This first tank was a beam type designed in 1967 built onto a swap body design from Fossey in 1966. The eighties and early nineties saw two different trends. One was a quest to make the tank <b>container</b> both <b>lighter</b> and have a greater capacity. Through the following decades tanks have evolved to become a lighter and more space efficient means of transporting bulk liquids.|$|R

30|$|In this case, vermiwash was {{produced}} using method described by Pramanik (2010) with slight modification. Around 25 numbers having around 30  g of total weight of well-grown matured worms (E. foetida) of approximately equal length were applied cold stress by keeping them in chilled conditions, in ice cubes in beaker at − 5  °C for 3 – 4  min. The earthworms were {{then transferred to}} a 500 -ml glass beaker containing cold distilled (°C) water and kept for 7 – 8  min with occasional stirring. The worms were transferred to a sterilized beaker containing distilled water at room temperature and rinsed for around 2 – 3  min and then released to the stock culture <b>container.</b> The <b>light</b> yellow-coloured exudutes from the petridish, glass beaker and plastic beaker were all mixed together and the vermiwash was stored in dark-coloured sterilized glass bottle at 4  °C for experimental purpose.|$|R
50|$|The size-weight illusion, {{also known}} as the Charpentier illusion, is named after the French {{physician}} Augustin Charpentier because {{he was the first to}} demonstrate the illusion experimentally. The illusion occurs when a person underestimates the weight of a larger object (e.g. a box) when compared to a smaller object of the same mass. Similar illusions occurs with differences in material and colour: metal <b>containers</b> feel <b>lighter</b> than wooden <b>containers</b> of the same size and mass, and darker objects feel heavier than brighter objects of the same size and mass. These illusions can all be described as contrast with the expected weight. The expected weight or density can be measured by matching visible and hidden weights, lifted in the same manner. This gives an expected density of about 1.7 for metal canisters and 0.14 for polystyrene blocks. Density expectations may assist in selecting suitable objects to throw.|$|R
50|$|Kechili is {{the place}} of {{residence}} of the Middle Ages in {{the east of the}} same named village in the Shahbuz rayon. Its area is 1400 m2.

At the result of the surface research, were collected a considerable amount of ware of the glazed and unglazed pottery (big pitcher, jug, pot, lid, jar-type <b>containers),</b> construction materials, <b>light</b> and the remains of an iron object. It is supposed that the place of residence belongs to the 9th-13th centuries.|$|R
30|$|This {{method was}} adopted from method {{described}} by Karuna et al. (1999). Well-grown adult earthworms Eisenia foetida were separated from casting materials {{by placing the}} worms in a plastic tub for some time. Then the earthworms were removed carefully from the casting materials and transferred to a glass beaker containing 500  ml of warm (40  °C temperature) distilled water and agitated for 5 – 6  min with a stirrer. Around 30  g of warms were taken. They were then removed immediately and added to another pre-sterilized plastic container filled with water at room temperature. Here the worms were rinsed thoroughly to collect the remaining excretory and secretory products adhering {{to the body of}} the worms. The earthworms were then released back to the stock culture <b>container.</b> The <b>light</b> yellow straw-coloured contents of the glass beaker and plastic beaker were mixed and the solution was stored in sterilized dark colour glass bottle at 4  °C to be used for the experimental purpose.|$|R
25|$|Increasing gas {{pressure}} improves the energy density by volume, making for smaller, but not <b>lighter</b> <b>container</b> tanks (see pressure vessel). Achieving higher pressures necessitates {{greater use of}} external energy to power the compression. The mass of the hydrogen tanks needed for compressed hydrogen reduces the fuel economy of the vehicle. Because {{it is a small}} molecule, hydrogen tends to diffuse through any liner material intended to contain it, leading to the embrittlement, or weakening, of its container. The most common method of on board hydrogen storage in today's demonstration vehicles is as a compressed gas at pressures of roughly 700bar (70MPa).|$|R
25|$|Compressed hydrogen, by comparison, {{is stored}} quite differently. Hydrogen gas has good energy density by weight, but poor energy density by volume versus hydrocarbons, hence it {{requires}} a larger tank to store. A large hydrogen tank will be heavier than the small hydrocarbon tank used to store {{the same amount of}} energy, all other factors remaining equal. Increasing gas pressure would improve the energy density by volume, making for smaller, but not <b>lighter</b> <b>container</b> tanks (see hydrogen tank). Compressed hydrogen costs 2.1% of the energy content to power the compressor. Higher compression without energy recovery will mean more energy lost to the compression step. Compressed hydrogen storage can exhibit very low permeation.|$|R
50|$|In {{container}} shipping, stowage planning {{refers to}} the arrangement of containers on board a container vessel. The stowage of a container ship involves different objectives, such as to optimize the available space and prevent damage to the goods, and more importantly, to minimize the time the vessel spending at the port port terminal. Containers will be arranged depending on their destinations (those going to the first port calls in the schedule will be placed on top), cargo weight (<b>lighter</b> <b>containers</b> are stored on top of heavier ones), cargo nature (dangerous goods containers normally are placed {{at the end of}} ship, and on upper deck to minimize the loss, in case of fire or leakage), etc.|$|R

50|$|A {{controlled}} {{study was}} undertaken {{to determine the}} stability of LSD in pooled urine samples.The concentrations of LSD in urine samples were followed over time at various temperatures, in different types of storage containers, at various exposures to different wavelengths of light, and at varying pH values. These studies demonstrated no significant loss in LSD concentration at 25 °C for up to four weeks. After four weeks of incubation, a 30% loss in LSD concentration at 37 °C and up to a 40% at 45 °C were observed. Urine fortified with LSD and stored in amber glass or nontransparent polyethylene containers showed no change in concentration under any light conditions. Stability of LSD in transparent <b>containers</b> under <b>light</b> was dependent on {{the distance between the}} light source and the samples, the wavelength of light, exposure time, and the intensity of light. After prolonged exposure to heat in alkaline pH conditions, 10 to 15% of the parent LSD epimerized to iso-LSD. Under acidic conditions, less than 5% of the LSD was converted to iso-LSD. It was also demonstrated that trace amounts of metal ions in buffer or urine could catalyze the decomposition of LSD and that this process can be avoided by the addition of EDTA.|$|R

30|$|There is {{a wealth}} of image {{analysis}} methods for tracking insects in videos recorded under highly controlled conditions. For instance, Balch et al. described an algorithm to track ants in special <b>containers</b> with ideal <b>lighting</b> conditions [9]. SwisTrack is another widely used tool for tracking insects and small robots [10]. Its modular architecture allows for configurable image processing pipelines that can be built from basic components (e.g., background subtraction, blob detection, particle tracking). Beetrack is a similar software tool with a more advanced toolset {{for the analysis of}} honeybees’ locomotion [11]. While the aforementioned tools provide fully automated insect tracking, they require controlled environments along with a predetermined set of parameters, making them unsuitable for outdoor field studies where the lighting conditions are constantly changing and the visual field is susceptible to frequent intrusion from other insects. To the best of our knowledge, no one has successfully used any of them to track insects in their native habitat.|$|R
