This initial payment was a {{landmark}} for the Foundation, as the transaction allowed it to assume the title to Monticello. The Foundation also sought to raise $500,000 for an endowment fund, which {{would be used to}} maintain Monticello and create plans that would [...] "foster the ideals of Jefferson". In moving beyond the planning stages and taking physical possession of Monticello, the Foundation surpassed prior attempts by similar organizations and groups in the preceding half-century that never got beyond preliminary negotiations. The Washington Post noted that the Foundation's successful payment [...] "has set to rest any misgivings that may have existed that the foundation's plan would end without result".|$|E

50|$|A {{personal}} <b>contract</b> <b>purchase</b> (PCP), {{often referred}} to as a personal contract plan, is a form of hire purchase vehicle finance for individual purchasers, which has similarities to both personal contract hire and a traditional hire purchase (buying on instalments).|$|E
50|$|This form of <b>contract</b> <b>purchase</b> was {{originally}} used more by businesses than individuals, {{but there has}} been steadily increasing use by consumers in countries such as the UK in recent years. In 2016, 82% of personal new car finance deals in the UK were PCPs.|$|E

50|$|The funding {{supplier}} may retain {{ownership of}} the car {{during the period of}} the contract for certain types of financing, such as a hire purchase or personal <b>contract</b> <b>purchase.</b> This interim ownership by a third party and subsequent leasing to the acquirer is far more typical for business assets than private ones, with the option of vehicle leasing being the major exception for private consumers.|$|E
50|$|Personal Car Finance is a {{complete}} subsector of personal finance, with numerous different products available. These include a straightforward car loan, hire purchase, personal contract hire (car leasing) and personal <b>contract</b> <b>purchase.</b> Therefore, car finance includes but {{is not limited to}} vehicle leasing. These different types of car finance are possible because of the high residual value of cars and the second hand car market, which enables other forms of financing beyond pure unsecured loans.|$|E

50|$|Mortgage {{contingency}} - Performance of the <b>contract</b> (<b>purchase</b> of {{the real}} estate) is contingent upon or subject to the buyer getting a mortgage loan for the purchase. Usually such a contingency calls for a buyer {{to apply for a}} loan within {{a certain period of time}} after the contract is signed. Since most people who buy a house require financing to complete their purchase, mortgage contingencies are one of the most common type of contingencies in real property contracts. If the financing is not secured, the buyer may unilaterally cancel the contract by stating that his or her condition has not or will not be satisfied or allow the contract to expire by declining to waive the condition within the specified time period.|$|E
50|$|It may be agreed {{instead that}} the final balloon payment is {{compulsory}} within {{the terms of the}} contract, but that the owner then retains a right to hand the vehicle back to the financing company at the previously agreed figure (GMFV) in lieu of the balloon payment. It is necessary to fully understand these aspects of a personal <b>contract</b> <b>purchase</b> before signing any deal as a loss may be incurred at this point. This option, but not the obligation, to acquire the car after a period equivalent to a contract hire is therefore packaged as either an option (in law) to purchase the car (a call option) at a 'set' price, or a right to sell the car (a 'put' option) at a set price after ownership is fully achieved from the final ‘balloon’ payment.|$|E
