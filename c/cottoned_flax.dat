50|$|Typically, raw {{materials}} such as metal ores or agricultural products such as foodstuffs or textile source plants (<b>cotton,</b> <b>flax)</b> require a sequence of treatments to render them useful. For metal, the processes include crushing, smelting and further refining. For plants, the useful material has {{to be separated from}} husks or contaminants and then treated for onward sale.|$|R
50|$|Textiles can be {{made from}} many {{materials}}. These materials come from four main sources: animal (wool, silk), plant (<b>cotton,</b> <b>flax,</b> jute), mineral (asbestos, glass fibre), and synthetic (nylon, polyester, acrylic). In the past, all textiles were made from natural fibres, including plant, animal, and mineral sources. In the 20th century, these were supplemented by artificial fibres made from petroleum.|$|R

40|$|Byssinosis as a nonspecific chronic {{respiratory}} disease in textile workers exposed to <b>cotton,</b> <b>flax,</b> jute, hemp and sisal is described. Opinions about aetiopathogenesis are presented. The following chapters are focused on clinical symptoms and functional lung changes. Classification of the disease is described afterwards. Finally, the necessity of medical and technical measures to prevent {{the development of this}} disease in textile workers is emphasised. CHARACTERISTIC Byssinosis is a chronic nonspecific {{respiratory disease}} in textile workers exposed to dust of <b>cotton,</b> <b>flax,</b> hemp, jute and sisal. It mostly arises after more than 10 years of exposure to dust. It is characterized by chest tightness and breathlessness, which the worker experiences periodically most severe {{on the first day of}} the working week after the days of absence from work. In the following days the symptoms are less troublesome and subsequently they disappear at all. In the following course of the disease the symptoms persist in the cours...|$|R

40|$|Data {{presented}} in this study support the finding that <b>cotton</b> and <b>flax</b> dusts contain agents which potentiate the formation or accumulation of histamine or both in the lungs of guinea pigs exposed to dust, and that such agents are present at much higher levels in cotton dust than in flax dust. The potentiating effect may be through the recruitment of mast cells into the lung. Both <b>cotton</b> and <b>flax</b> dusts contain methylating enzyme inhibitory agents, whereas cotton dust also contains agents that inhibit histaminase activity; flax dust contains agents potentiating histamine activity. These agents working together result in the accumulation or depletion of histamine observed in the different groups of animals exposed to either <b>cotton</b> or <b>flax</b> dust in this study...|$|R

50|$|Natural fibres {{are from}} animals (sheep, goat, rabbit, silk-worm), {{minerals}} (asbestos), or plants (<b>cotton,</b> <b>flax,</b> sisal). These vegetable fibres {{can come from}} the seed (cotton), the stem (known as bast fibres: flax, hemp, jute) or the leaf (sisal). Without exception, many processes are needed before a clean even staple is obtained - each with a specific name. With the exception of silk, each of these fibres is short, being only centimetres in length, and each has a rough surface that enables it to bond with similar staples.|$|R
40|$|Textile {{production}} and consumption are continually increasing.

50|$|Ring {{spinning}} is {{a method}} of spinning fibres, such as <b>cotton,</b> <b>flax</b> or wool, to make a yarn. The ring frame developed from the throstle frame, which in its turn was a descendant of Arkwright's water frame. Ring spinning is a continuous process, unlike mule spinning which uses an intermittent action. In ring spinning, the roving is first attenuated by using drawing rollers, then spun and wound around a rotating spindle which in its turn is contained within an independently rotating ring flyer. Traditionally ring frames could only {{be used for the}} coarser counts, but they could be attended by semi-skilled labour.|$|R

50|$|The area of Yūki was an {{important}} center {{for the production of}} <b>cotton,</b> <b>flax</b> and woven goods from the Nara period. From the Kamakura period onwards, the area was controlled by the Yūki clan, who developed a castle town around Yūki Castle. This subsequently became the center of Yūki Domain which was ruled by 10 generations of a junior branch of the Mizuno clan under the Tokugawa shogunate in the Edo period. The town of Yūki was created with the establishment of the municipalities system on April 1, 1889. On March 15, 1954 Yūki merged with the neighboring villages of Yamakawa, Kinugawa, Egawa and Kamiyamakawa and was elevated to city status.|$|R
5|$|Textiles {{are made}} from both animal fibres, {{including}} wool and silk, and plant fibres, including <b>cotton</b> and <b>flax.</b> Dyestuffs too are made both from animals, including carmine from the bodies of insects, and from plants, including indigo, , and lichens.|$|R
50|$|Flax fibers {{are taken}} from the stem of the plant, and are {{two to three times}} as strong as those of <b>cotton.</b> Additionally, <b>flax</b> fibers are {{naturally}} smooth and straight. Europe and North America depended on flax for vegetable-based cloth until the nineteenth century, when <b>cotton</b> overtook <b>flax</b> as the most common plant used for making rag-based paper. Flax is grown on the Canadian prairies for linseed oil, which is used as a drying oil in paints and varnishes and in products such as linoleum and printing inks. In India, flax seed oil also is known as alsi in Hindi and javas in Marathi. It is mainly used in Savji curries, such as mutton curries.|$|R
