40|$|In fireprone ecosystems, two {{important}} alternative fates for leaves are burning in a wildfire (when alive or as litter) or they get consumed (as litter) by decomposers. The influence of leaf traits on litter decomposition rate is reasonably well understood. In contrast, less {{is known about}} the influence of leaf traits on leaf and litter flammability. The aim of this study was twofold: (i) to determine which morphological and <b>chemical</b> <b>leaf</b> traits drive flammability and (ii) to determine whether different (combinations of) morphological and <b>chemical</b> <b>leaf</b> traits drive interspecific variation in decomposition and litter flammability and, in turn, help us understand the relationship between decomposability and flammability. To explore the relationships between leaf traits and flammability of individual leaves, we used 32 evergreen perennial plant species from eastern Australia in standardized experimental burns on three types of leaf material (i. e. fresh, dried and senesced). Next, we compared these trait-flammability relationships to trait-decomposability relationships as obtained from a previous decomposition experiment (focusing on senesced leaves only). Within the three parameters of leaf flammability that we measured, interspecific variation in time to ignition was mainly explained by specific leaf area and moisture content. Flame duration and smoulder duration were mostly explained by leaf dry mass and to a lesser degree by leaf chemistry, namely, nitrogen, phosphorus and tannin concentrations. The variation in the decomposition constant across species was unrelated to our measures of flammability. Moreover, different combinations of morphological and <b>chemical</b> <b>leaf</b> properties underpinned the interspecific variation in decomposability and flammability. In contrast to litter flammability, decomposability was driven by lignin and phosphorus concentrations. The decoupling of flammability and decomposability leads to three possible scenarios for species' influence on litter fates: (i) fast-decomposing species for which flammability is irrelevant because there will not be enough litter to support a fire; (ii) species with slow-decomposing leaves and a high flammability; and (iii) species with slow-decomposing leaves and a low flammability. We see potential for making use of the decoupled trait-decomposition-flammability relationships when modelling carbon and nutrient fluxes. Including information on leaf traits in models can improve the prediction of fire behaviour. We note that herbivory is another key fate for leaves, but this study was focused on fire and decomposition...|$|R

Both mechanical and hand detasseling result in loss of some leaf tissue and plant N. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine if seed yield and quality and N content of grain and stover were affected by leaf removal during detasseling. The treatments evaluated were removal of tassel only, tassel plus one leaf, tassel plus two leaves, tassel plus three leaves, tassel plus four leaves, and no tissue <b>removed</b> (control). The <b>leaf</b> area index (LAI) declined linearly, about 0. 16 LAI units per <b>leaf</b> <b>removed.</b> Grain and stover yield also declined linearly with number of leaves removed with the tassel (r 2 = 0. 97 and 0. 92, respectively). Each <b>leaf</b> <b>removed</b> reduced grain yield about 0. 36 Mg ha- 1. Yield reduction was caused by decreased kernel size. Grain and stover N concentration and amount of N in stover did not vary among detasseled treatments. However, total N in the grain declined linearly as number of leaves removed increased (r 2 = 0. 97). Warm and cold germination and warm germination after accelerated aging were not affected by leaf removal during detasseling. Results reported here suggest that when leaves are removed from the plant at detasseling, the loss of photosynthetic capacity, the ability to intercept light, and plant N all contribute to grain yield reduction...|$|R

40|$|Florivory, or the {{consumption}} of flowers, is a ubiquitous interaction that can reduce plant reproduction directly by damaging reproductive tissues and indirectly by deterring pollinators. However, we know surprisingly little about how florivory alters plant traits or the larger community of species interactions. Although leaf damage is known to affect floral traits and interactions in many systems, the consequences of floral damage for leaf traits and interactions are unknown. We manipulated floral damage in Impatiens capensisand measured effects on floral attractive traits and secondary <b>chemicals,</b> <b>leaf</b> secondary <b>chemicals,</b> floral interactions, <b>leaf</b> herbivory, and plant reproduction. We also examined relationships between early season floral traits and floral interactions, to explore which traits structure floral interactions. Moderate but not high florivory significantly increased relative selfed reproduction, leading to a shift in mating system away from outcrossing. Florivory increased leaf secondary compounds and decreased leaf herbivory, although mechanisms other than leaf chemistry {{may be responsible for}} some of the reduced leaf damage. Florivory altered four of seven measured interactions, including increased subsequent florivory and reduced flower spiders, although only leaf damage effects were significant after correcting for multiple tests. Pretreatment concentrations of floral anthocyanins and condensed tannins were associated with reduced levels of many floral antagonisms, including florivory, nectar larceny, and flower spider abundance, suggesting these traits play a role in floral resistance. Overall, our results indicate a broad range of community and potential evolutionary consequences of florivory through structuring subsequent floral interactions, altering <b>leaf</b> secondary <b>chemicals,</b> and shaping <b>leaf</b> herbivory...|$|R

Journal of Chemical Ecology, 35, (4), 469 - 475. IMPF: 02. 41 RONO: 00 Sponsorship: Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Illinois at Urbana?ChampaignA field {{study on the}} effects of current grazing practices on plants in central Norway found no increase in either phenolic compounds or proteinase inhibitors in plants subjected to grazing by sheep. This could either reflect insufficient damage to the plants due to low grazing intensity or a lack of a long-term response of the plants to grazing. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that damage to forage plants used by sheep and rodents in Norwegian alpine rangelands can stimulate a long-term (at least 2 -week) increase in levels of defensive compounds. We used clipping experiments to manipulate the severity and timing of damage to eight species of common plants used by herbivores in Norway. Under greenhouse conditions (i. e., climate-controlled), we subjected mature plants to one of four clipping treatments: control (0 % <b>leaf</b> tissue <b>removed),</b> low (10 ? 15 % <b>leaf</b> tissue <b>removed),</b> high (70 ? 75 % <b>leaf</b> tissue <b>removed),</b> or sustained (15 % of <b>leaf</b> tissue <b>removed</b> every other day up to a total removal of 75 %, i. e., five clippings over 9 days). Samples were collected 2 weeks after final clipping and analyzed for concentrations of total phenolics, proteinase inhibitors, ratio of total phenolics to soluble proteins, and ratio of proteinase inhibitors to soluble plant proteins. As expected, the different species of plants responded differently to simulated herbivory, but most plants either showed no response to mechanical wounding and tissue loss or had reduced defensive compounds. Thus, our results do not support the hypothesis that herbivory induces a long-term increase in defensive compounds in alpine rangelands of Norway, a result consistent with those from field studies.

In the test, the insulation of the greenhouse was increased by separating the existing 2 -layers of the light tight screen, creating an air layer of 5 cm in between them. This improved the temperature layering between the greenhouse and the greenhouse cover, resulting in very low net radiation losses by the crop. The applied light-dependent temperature strategy proved technically and physiologically suitable between November and May. The day length in winter was gradually extended to 13 or 15 hours, with a proportional increase of the average day temperature (at least 16 °C) according to the light dependent temperature strategy. This saved some energy on heat, but required more electricity without improving production or quality; on the contrary, the crop showed an increased vegetative growth.
