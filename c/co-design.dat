Design {{management has}} been recognized (and subsidized) throughout the European Union as a function for corporate advantage of both companies and nations. The main issues and debates included the topics of design thinking, strategic design management, design leadership, and product service systems. Design management {{was influenced by the}} following design trends: sustainable design, inclusive design, interactive design, design probes, product clinics, and <b>co-design.</b> It was also influenced by the later management trends of open innovation and design thinking.|$|E

[...] In November 1977, developer Oliver T. Carr proposed tearing down the entire block, which was occupied by the Beaux-Arts Keith-Albee Building and Metropolitan National Bank Building as well as the 180-year-old Rhodes Tavern. A years-long legal and political battle ensued, as historic preservationists fought to keep all three buildings. Carr eventually agreed to retain the facades of the two Beaux-Arts buildings facing G and 15th Streets. The battle to save the entire Rhodes' Tavern, however, lasted into 1983 and involved a citywide ballot initiative and an appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States. To preserve the facades, Carr hired Koubek and the New York City firm of Skidmore, Owings and Merrill and charged them with designing ground-floor retail entrances and two upper floors which would reflect but not mimic the Beaux-Arts style of the retained facades which building a more modern structure behind them. Construction on the new building began in 1980.|$|E
40|$|What {{is holding}} back service design {{from making a}} {{distinct}} departure from a product-centred to a socio-material humancentred framework? We have a concern for <b>co-designing</b> that is often discussed as a generic method to develop empathetic connections and understandings of people and their contexts. In this use, mastering the craft of <b>co-designing</b> had inadvertently isolated the method from the practitioner, fragmenting its process {{as a series of}} static events or a tool for deployment in staged workshops. Contributing to current debates on <b>co-designing</b> and design anthropology, our paper seeks to re-entangle <b>co-designing</b> back into its lived and enacted contexts. We see <b>co-designing</b> as a reflexive, embodied process of discovery and actualisation, and it is an integral, on-going activity of designing services. Codesigning can catalyse a transformative process in revealing and unlocking tacit knowledge, moving people along on a journey to &# 039;make real&# 039; what proposed services might be like in the future...|$|R

2500|$|From 1797 until 1829, the bucolic {{village of}} Greenwich was the {{location}} of New York State's first penitentiary, Newgate Prison, on the Hudson River at what is now West 10th Street, near the Christopher Street pier. The building was designed by Joseph-François Mangin, who would later <b>co-design</b> New York City Hall. Although the intention of its first warden, Quaker prison reformer Thomas Eddy, {{was to provide a}} rational and humanitarian place for retribution and rehabilitation, the prison soon became an overcrowded and pestilent place, subject to frequent riots by the prisoners which damaged the buildings and killed some inmates. By 1821, the prison, designed for 432 inmates, held 817 instead, a number made possible only by the frequent release of prisoners, sometimes as many as 50 a day. Since the prison was north of New York City, being sentenced to Newgate became known as being [...] "sent up the river", an expression which carried over when it was replaced by the new Sing Sing Prison in Ossining, New York.|$|E
