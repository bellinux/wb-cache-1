In the present research Zn doped cobalt ferrites were prepared by the chemical co-precipitation method and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) at room temperature for structural analysis. X-ray diffraction patterns confirmed the FCC spinel structure of synthesized particles. Crystallite sizes were calculated from the most intense peak (311) using the Debye-Scherrer formula. The obtained crystallite sizes were in nanometer range for all the samples synthesized at reaction temperature of 70 °C.

40|$|Relative {{movements}} {{of the human body}} parts are enable due to the existence of joints. However, disease and injury codd cause joint disorder. Nowadays, joint replacement is a widely accepted treatment for damaged joint. In Malaysia, hip joint or knee joint replacements, either as total or partial, have become a standard procedure in many hospitals. Sultanah Aminah hospital for example, conducts 4 5 joint replacement surgeries every week. A typical art&cial joint consists of two different materials which have self lubricating bearing behaviour such as metal and polymer. A well perform joint must fulfil bio mechanics aspects of mobility and stability, as well as <b>bio</b> <b>compatibility</b> aspects. Despite of the smooth mobility, the main problem by metal-polymer bearing is the wear which occur in the surface contact, because friction moment will create small particles or debris which can accumulate in the surrounding human tissue and cause various problems. Many studies reported that metal-polymer pair contact is satisfactory for short term only. Therefore, a hard material couple such as metalmetal which provides better tribologicral propertie is considered high potential. The current available metal-metal joint is made from Titanium alloy Ti- 6 A 1 - 4 V, but the toxic presence of A 1 and V ions in this alloy has been a serious issue of concern.

40|$|Ligaments are a dense {{connective}} tissue responsible for joint movements and stability. Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) {{is one of the}} four major ligaments of the knee. Being subjected to high physiological loads, ACL is commonly injured,Surgical management with ligament grafts is often required, but these treatments are associated with complications of reduced strength, joint stiffness, repair-rupture. Interface Tissue engineering (ITE) may effectively address these complications where an artificial ligament incorporating the interfacial fibrocartilage can be engineered to provide similar mechanical and functional characteristics as the native tissue. Therefore a multi-compartmental scaffold that can induce the growth and differentiation of fibrocartilage at the interface of engineered bone and ligament tissues would mimic the native structure of bone-ligament –bone block with deposition of appropriate extracellular matrix (ECM) in respective compartments and possession of adequate mechanical properties to support the healing tissue. The current project has focused on the fabrication of a silk-based knitted scaffold which comprises of three compartments, one each for the bone, ligament and enthesis tissues. an array of methods were adopted for surface modification of the compartmentalized knitted silk scaffold by using bio-polymers such as silk solution, chitosan, gelatin and hydroxyapatite on the appropriate compartments. The ligament and bone compartments were reserved for mature cell line culture like MG 63 and Saos- 2. The various methods used for coatings of polymers over the knitted-silk were alternate soaking, plain coating and freeze-drying.

The wetting properties of stainless steel surfaces are presumed to be essential for the process of clean ability and {{for a wide variety}} of <b>bio</b> <b>compatibility.</b> In collaboration with the topical company for this thesis, the idea is to find the correlation between the surface properties of various stainless steel in relation to their wetting and spreading ability to enable efficient cleaning of the surface. For a substrate surface to be thoroughly cleaned of any debris or soil, it should be able to allow proper adherence of the liquid across its surface to a certain degree good enough to ensure good wettability of the surface and conversely easy and proper removal of any attached soil on the surface. Higher demand on cleaning, disinfection and sterilization processes became more and more pressing due the development of complex medical equipment.

A dinuclear copper(II) complex, namely [Cu 2 (L) (m-OH) (H 2 O) (ClO 4) 2], has been prepared by treating HL with Cu(ClO 4) 2 $ 6 H 2 O in methanolic solution {{with the aim}} of investigating its catalytic promiscuity. Single crystal structural analysis reveals that the Cu–Cu separation is 2. 9 °A. Catecholase activity of the complex has been investigated in anhydrous DMSO as well as in a DMSO–water mixture with progressively increasing the quantity of water up to a 1 : 1 volume ratio in order to assess the <b>bio</b> <b>compatibility</b> of the catalyst using 3, 5 -DTBC as a model substrate. In anhydrous DMSO the catalytic activity reaches its peak and decreases with increasing water concentration, a feature most likely due to insolubility of 3, 5 -DTBQ, the product formed in the catalysis, in water. The complex also shows excellent phosphatase-like activity by exploiting the Lewis acidity, the necessary requirement for that activity, under different pH. Thorough investigation reveals that no activity is observed at pH 6 but the activity increases with increasing pH and attains a maximum at pH 9. A variable temperature magnetic study shows that the two Cu centers are antiferromagnetically coupled at low temperature with a J value of 78. 63 1. 30 cm 1. In acetonitrile medium the complex shows very exciting behavior. A new transformed ligand is generated that has been assigned as a Schiff-base ligand, 2, 6 -bis-[(2 -hydroxy-ethylimino) -methyl]- 4 -methylphenol. The genesis of the new ligand is a consequence of dealkylation from HL followed by oxidation.

40|$|Aseptic {{loosening}} and periprosthetic osteolysis are {{the most}} common complications (5 - 10 % in 10 years follow up) after total hip arthroplasty. Polyethylene debris appears {{to play a major role}} in this process. To avoid polyethylene wear induced osteolysis, second generation of metal on metal bearing hip prosthesis made of cobalt alloy has been introduced. The aim of this study was to assess tribological and <b>bio</b> <b>compatibility</b> characteristics of metal on metal hip prosthesis systems in vitro prior to the clinical trial. A hip joint simulator was used to asses the tribological. characteristic of the hip prosthesis system. The hip joint simulator was validated against retrieval reports. The wear rate from metal on metal bearing prosthesis system was compared with the wear rate from metal on polyethylene prosthesis system and the wear phases in metal on metal prosthesis system were characterised. The effect of pseudosynovial fluid from patients with loosened hip prostheses on osteobalst proliferation was examined. Finally, the influence of cobalt on human osteoblast proliferation and function was studied. By reproducing the head size effect reported by Charnley the joint simulator showed to be a reliable tool to evaluate wear rate. The use of bovine serum as synovial fluid substitute in the simulator is clearly superior compared to water. The wear rate of metal on metal hip prostheses is 100 times less compared to metal on polyethylene prosthesis systems. Characterisation of wear phases in metal on metal prosthesis systems show a biphasic wear pattern with an initial rapid followed by a slower steady state phase. This indicates that patients with metal on metal hip prostheses will be exposed to a higher volume of metallic wear in the first year after implantation compared to the following years. The pseudosynovial fluid from patients with loosened prosthesis systems inhibited the proliferation of human osteoblast cells. The inhibition could be a result of accumulation of cytokines and /or dissolved metallic wear in synovial fluid. Penetration of pseudosynovial. fluid in bone implant interface may inhibit osteoblasts and cause prosthesis loosening. Human osteoblast's function and proliferation were reduced in the presence of cobalt. The osteoblast activities, such as DNA synthesis, osteocalcin and collagen type I production have been reduced and the amount of interleukine 6 was increased with increasing cobalt concentration. In vitro evaluation of metal on metal prosthesis systems where tribological properties are assessed provide us data about expected wear rate. The wear from prosthesis system can be dissolved in body fluid and influence the homeostasis of the cells both in periprosthetic tissue and distanced organs. Our biocompatibility studies showed that psuedosynovial fluid influenced osteoblast cell proliferation and cobalt inhibited the ostoeblast function and proliferation. This thesis advocates combined tribological and biocompatibility assessments of hip prosthesis prior to the clinical trial. In vitro evaluation of prosthesis systems and material may prevent disastrous clinical outcomes after total hip arthroplasties...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of new anticancer drugs {{can be divided into}} six phases: characterization of the API (structural and analytical), solubility- and stability studies, design of the formulation, manufacturing, quality control analysis, and (<b>bio)</b> <b>compatibility</b> studies. Structural and analytical characterization of the API is required before solubility- and stability studies are performed. Subsequently, solubility- and stability studies are performed. Because anticancer drugs are mainly compounds with a decreased solubility in aqueous solutions, formulations have to be developed which increase the solubility of the API. This thesis showed that the use of the organic solvent tert-butyl alcohol (TBA) in combination with freeze drying is a suited technique to elucidate both solubility- and stability problems. Furthermore, it was found with DSC analysis that during freeze drying of 40 % v/v TBA three different crystals are formed: TBA hydrate (containing 70 % w/w TBA) -ice crystals, pure TBA hydrate crystals (containing 70 % w/w TBA), and TBA hydrate crystals containing 90 - 95 % w/w TBA. Furthermore, it was seen that crystallization of TBA was inhibited when both mannitol and sodium bicarbonate were present. Another technique to solve dissolution problems is the use of complexing agents. In this thesis the use of the complexation agent 2 -hydroxypropyl-?-cyclodextrin (HP?CD) is described. It was shown that this agent can be very useful for complexation of drugs even if the complexation constant is relatively low. Furthermore, it was seen that the addition of HP?CD can result in different stability profiles, indicating that the presence of excipients can influence the stability profile dramatically. Based on the results of the solubility- and stability studies the final formulation is developed. Subsequently, further research is performed to be able to guarantee a formulated product of good quality. Therefore, compatibility studies have to be performed to determine the stability of the product in the primary packaging material, in the clinic (after dilution prior to administration) and in the physiological environment (i. e. simulation of the “in vivo” situation). Meanwhile, specification limits of the newly developed final product have to be defined. After these studies a final formulation is selected and manufacturing is performed on small scale for phase I and II clinical trials. However, before this is performed, possible interactions between the drug substance and/or excipients with the manufacturing materials should be investigated (e. g. extraction of lipophile compounds from silicone tubing by complexing agents). Furthermore, because only a limited amount of batches is manufactured in this stage of development, {{it is not possible to}} perform risk assessment of the manufacturing process per product. Therefore, we performed risk assessment using mixed effects analysis. This method was shown to be a suitable technique for risk assessment in this early stage of development. Overall it can be concluded that all the items discussed in this thesis are of importance during pharmaceutical development experimental agents to obtain a final pharmaceutical product of good quality. Neglecting one step may result in an undesired decrease in product quality...|$|R
