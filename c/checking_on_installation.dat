40|$|Different {{types of}} bearing designs were {{developed}} to improve dynamic properties of rotor-bearing systems. Elliptical bearings, multisleeve bearings, tilting pad and other designs such as herringbone groove were utilized to increase resistance to the onset of self excited vibrations. Experimental trials are costly, two alternative methods are used to gain a qualitative insight. The first one creates mathematical model and applies both a digital or an analog computer simulation. The second one investigates phenomena occurring on the laboratory rig with the bearing replaced by an electronic simulating device, working in a feedback loop, which produces forces,which are functions of journal displacement and velocity. The simulated hydrodynamic forces are produced according to assumed characteristics matched to the bearing type. The principal benefit of the analog simulation is that nonlinear characteristics of a subsystem are precisely identified and mathematical methods applied for a wide class of problems are <b>checked</b> <b>on</b> the experimental <b>installation...</b>|$|R
