This work, co-authored with Richard Eck, was the first application of computers to infer phylogenies from molecular sequences. It was the first reconstruction of a phylogeny (evolutionary tree) by computers from molecular sequences using a maximum parsimony method. In later years, she applied these methods to study a number of molecular relationships, such as the <b>catalytic</b> <b>chain</b> and bovine cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase and the src gene product of Rous avian and Moloney murine sarcoma viruses; antithrombin-III, alpha-antitrypsin, and ovalbumin; epidermal growth factor and the light chain of coagulation factor X; and apolipoproteins A-I, A-II, C-I and C-III.|$|E

50|$|<b>Catalytic</b> <b>chain</b> {{transfer}} {{is a way}} to make shorter polymer chains in a radical polymerization process. The method involves adding a <b>catalytic</b> <b>chain</b> transfer agent to the reaction mixture of the monomer and the radical initiator. <b>Catalytic</b> <b>chain</b> transfer proceeds via hydrogen atom transfer from the organic growing polymeryl radical to cobalt(II), producing a polymer vinyl-end group and a cobalt-hydride species (equilibrium 2). The Co-H species then reacts with the monomer to start a new Co(III)-alkyl species, which re-initiates a new growing polymeric radical (reversible termination, equilibrium 1). The main products of <b>catalytic</b> <b>chain</b> transfer polymerization are therefore vinyl terminated polymer chains which are shorter than in conventional (free) radical polymerization.|$|E
40|$|A {{collection}} of circularly permuted <b>catalytic</b> <b>chains</b> of aspartate transcarbamoylase (ATCase) has been generated by random circular permutation of the pyrB gene. From {{the library of}} ATCases containing permuted polypeptide chains, we have chosen for further investigation nine ATCase variants whose <b>catalytic</b> <b>chains</b> have termini located within or close to an α helix. All of the variants fold and assemble into dodecameric holoenzymes with similar sedimentation coefficients and slightly reduced thermal stabilities. Those variants disrupted within three different helical regions in the wild-type structure show no detectable enzyme activity and no apparent binding of the bisubstrate analog N-phosphonacetyl-l-aspartate. In contrast, two variants whose termini are just within or adjacent to other α helices are catalytically active and allosteric. As expected, helical disruptions are more destabilizing than loop disruptions. Nonetheless, some <b>catalytic</b> <b>chains</b> lacking continuity within helical regions can assemble into stable holoenzymes comprising six catalytic and six regulatory chains. For seven of the variants, continuity within the helices in the <b>catalytic</b> <b>chains</b> is important for enzyme activity but not necessary for proper folding, assembly, and stability of the holoenzyme...|$|R
40|$|In the {{regulatory}} enzyme aspartate transcarbamoylase (aspartate carbamoyltransferase; carbamoylphosphate:L-aspartate carbamoyltransferase, EC 2. 1. 3. 2) of Escherichia coli, the six <b>catalytic</b> polypeptide <b>chains</b> are arranged as two distinct catalytic trimers "crosslinked" by three regulatory dimers. Because in allosteric proteins {{it is assumed}} that the binding of a ligand to one site promotes a conformational change that affects the subsequent binding to other sites in the oligomeric protein, it was of interest to determine directly whether the effects of ligand binding to <b>chains</b> in one <b>catalytic</b> subunit are "communicated" to unliganded chains in the other subunit. Accordingly, hybrid enzyme molecules were constructed containing sensitive chromophores on the three inactive <b>catalytic</b> <b>chains</b> in one subunit along with an active catalytic subunit and three native regulatory subunits. The derivative exhibited the allosteric properties characteristic of the native enzyme. Communication between the two catalytic subunits was demonstrated by spectral measurements showing that the effects of ligand binding to the three active chains are propagated to the chromophores on the unliganded, inactive chains in the other subunit. Moreover, the change in the tertiary structure of the unliganded <b>catalytic</b> <b>chains</b> is tightly linked to the alteration in the quaternary structure...|$|R

Three alleles, pyrB 554, pyrB 730, and pyrB 748, have been cloned, and their nucleotide sequences have been determined along {{with that of the}} wild-type pyrBI operon in order to locate the sites of the alterations in the <b>catalytic</b> <b>chains.</b> Missense mutation pyrB 554 leads to replacement of serine- 52 by phenylalanine, and the inactive mutant enzyme has properties similar to those of wild-type aspartate transcarbamoylase. The amber mutation pyrB 730 results in unstable truncated polypeptide chains 27 amino acids shorter than wild-type chains. Deletion mutation pyrB 748 causes the removal of 181 amino acids. Combining these results with knowledge of the crystallographic structure of the wild-type enzyme provides a basis for tentative structural mechanisms for the observed complementation behavior of the mutant proteins...|$|R

Two slightly different genetic constructs led to the expression in good yield of circularly permuted <b>catalytic</b> <b>chains,</b> which associated in vivo into active trimers. They, in turn, combined in vitro with wild-type regulatory dimers to form ATCase-like molecules. Both polypeptide chains began at residue 235 in a different domain from the NH 2 terminus of wild type and had an overlapping sequence of eight residues at the COOH terminus. One had a six-amino-acid linker, and the other had a deletion of four residues. Enzymes containing rearranged chains were similar to their wild-type counterparts in physical properties. Whereas values of Vmax were close to those of wild-type trimers and ATCase, the Km values were more than 10 -fold greater. Also the allosteric properties characteristic of wild-type ATCase were lacking in the enzymes containing permuted chains. Denaturation of trimers by urea was reversible, and recovery of activity in both rate and yield was {{comparable to that of}} wild-type trimers. The experiments demonstrate that folding of chains into clearly defined domains and the assembly of active, thermodynamically stable oligomers are not dependent on the positions of NH 2 and COOH termini; the folded structures are a consequence of the final sequence and not the order of biosynthetic addition of amino acids...|$|R
40|$|Proteases of Porphyromonas gingivalis are {{considered}} to be important virulence determinants of this periodontal bacterium. Several biochemical isoforms of arginine-specific proteases are derived from rgpA and rgpB. HRgpA is a heterodimer composed of the <b>catalytic</b> α <b>chain</b> noncovalently associated with a β adhesin chain derived from the C terminus of the initial full-length translation product. The <b>catalytic</b> α <b>chain</b> is also present as a monomer (RgpA) either free in solution or associated with membranes. rgpB lacks the coding region for the adhesin domain present in rgpA and yields only monomeric forms (RgpB) which again may be soluble or membrane associated. In this study, the <b>catalytic</b> <b>chains</b> of this unusual group of enzymes are shown to be differentially modified by the posttranslational addition of carbohydrate. A monoclonal antibody (MAb 1 B 5) raised to the monomeric RgpA did not react with the corresponding recombinant RgpA α chain expressed in Escherichia coli but was immunoreactive with P. gingivalis lipopolysaccharide. MAb 1 B 5 also reacted with the membrane-associated forms of RgpA and RgpB but not with the heterodimeric HRgpA and the soluble form of RgpB. RgpA treated with denaturants was capable of binding to MAb 1 B 5 whereas treatment with periodate abolished this binding, suggesting the presence of carbohydrate residues within the epitope. Chemical deglycosylation abolished immunoreactivity with MAb 1 B 5 and caused a ∼ 30 % reduction {{in the size of the}} membrane-associated enzymes. Monosaccharide analysis of HRgpA and RgpA demonstrated 2. 1 and 14. 4 %, respectively, carbohydrate by weight of protein. Furthermore, distinct differences were detected in their monosaccharide compositions, indicating that these protease isoforms are modified not only to different extents but also with different sugars. The variable nature of these additions may have a significant effect on the structure, stability, and immune recognition of these protease glycoproteins...|$|R

As yet no methodical study has been conducted to determine how extensively new termini can be introduced and where such termini cannot be tolerated. We have devised a procedure to generate random circular permutations of the <b>catalytic</b> <b>chains</b> of Escherichia coli aspartate transcarbamoylase (ATCase; EC 2. 1. 3. 2) and to select clones that produce active or stable holoenzyme containing permuted chains. A tandem gene construct was made, based on the desired linkage between amino acid residues in the C- and N-terminal regions of the polypeptide chain, and this DNA was treated with a suitable restriction enzyme to yield a fragment containing the rearranged coding sequence for the chain. Circularization achieved with DNA ligase, followed by linearization at random with DNase I, and incorporation of the linearized, repaired, blunt-ended, rearranged genes into a suitable plasmid permitted the expression of randomly permuted polypeptide chains. The plasmid with appropriate stop codons also contained pyrI, the gene encoding the regulatory chain of ATCase. Colonies expressing detectable amounts of ATCase-like molecules containing permuted <b>catalytic</b> <b>chains</b> were identified by an immunoblot technique or by their ability {{to grow in the}} absence of pyrimidines in the growth medium. Sequencing of positive clones revealed a variety of novel circular permutations. Some had N and C termini within helices of the wild-type enzyme as well as deletions and insertions. Permutations were concentrated in the C-terminal domain and only few were detected in the N-terminal domain. The technique, which is adaptable generally to proteins whose N and C termini are near each other, can be of value in relating in vivo folding of nascent, growing polypeptide chains to in vitro renaturation of complete chains and determining the role of protein sequence in folding kinetics...|$|R

40|$|The Ser/Thr kinase CK 2 (previously called casein kinase 2) is {{composed}} of two <b>catalytic</b> <b>chains</b> (CK 2 alpha) attached to a dimer of noncatalytic subunits (CK 2 beta). CK 2 is involved in suppression of apoptosis, cell survival, and tumorigenesis. To investigate these activities and possibly affect them, selective CK 2 inhibitors are required. An often-used CK 2 inhibitor is 5, 6 -dichloro- 1 -beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB). In a complex structure with human CK 2 alpha, DRB binds to the canonical ATP cleft, but additionally it occupies an allosteric site that can be alternatively filled by glycerol. Inhibition kinetic studies corroborate the dual binding mode of the inhibitor. Structural comparisons reveal a surprising conformational plasticity of human CK 2 alpha around both DRB binding sites. After local rearrangement, the allosteric site serves as a CK 2 beta interface. This opens the potential to construct molecules interfering with the CK 2 alpha/CK 2 beta interaction...|$|R

Each gene of the human light chains was transferred into the Escherichia coli system. The recovered light chain was highly purified using a two-step purification system. Light chain 22 F 6 showed interesting catalytic features. The light chain cleaved a peptide bond of synthetic peptidyl- 4 -methylcoumaryl- 7 -amide (MCA) substrates, such as QAR-MCA and EAR-MCA, indicating amidase activity. It also hydrolyzed a phosphodiester bond of both DNA and RNA. From the analysis of amino acid sequences and molecular modeling, the 22 F 6 light chain possesses two kinds of active sites as amidase and nuclease in close distances. The 22 F 6 <b>catalytic</b> light <b>chain</b> could suppress the infection of influenza virus type A (H 1 N 1) of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells in an in vitro assay.

40|$|Although local, {{direct effects}} of ligand binding to {{proteins}} are readily differentiated conceptually from gross, indirect conformational changes in {{regions of the}} protein remote {{from the site of}} binding, it has been difficult experimentally to distinguish between them. In oligomeric proteins, for example, the binding of ligands to one chain may cause a conformational change in the unliganded chains, but many physical chemical probes are not sufficiently discriminating to demonstrate where the change occurred. Evidence has been lacking as to whether the inhibitor, CTP, or the activator, ATP, in binding to the regulatory chains of the allosteric enzyme aspartate transcarbamoylase (aspartate carbamoyltransferase; carbamoylphosphate:L-aspartate carbamoyltransferase, EC 2. 1. 3. 2) causes a conformational change that is propagated throughout the enzyme to the <b>catalytic</b> <b>chains.</b> To demonstrate this “communication” of effects of binding at one site on the conformation of other polypeptide chains, we constructed molecules containing native regulatory subunits and enzymically active nitrated catalytic subunits having one sensitive nitrotyrosyl chromophore per polypeptide chain. These hybrid molecules exhibited the characteristic regulatory properties of the native enzyme. Upon the addition of CTP the population of molecules was shifted toward the constrained or T state, as shown by the change in the sedimentation coefficient and the altered enzyme kinetics. Moreover, there was a decrease in absorbance at 430 nm due to the altered environment of the nitrated <b>catalytic</b> polypeptide <b>chains.</b> In contrast, ATP caused a shift toward the relaxed or R conformation, and the absorbance due to the nitrotyrosyl residues was increased.

40|$|Although {{intensive}} {{investigations have}} been conducted on the allosteric enzyme, aspartate transcarbamoylase, which catalyzes the first committed reaction in the biosynthesis of pyrimidines in Escherichia coli, {{little is known about}} the role of individual amino acid residues in catalysis or regulation. Two inactive enzymes produced by random mutagenesis have been characterized previously but the loss of activity is probably attributable to changes in the folding of the chains stemming from the introduction of charged and bulky residues (Asp for Gly- 128 and Phe for Ser- 52). Site-directed mutagenesis of pyrB, which encodes the <b>catalytic</b> <b>chains</b> of the enzyme, was used to probe the functional roles of several amino acids by making more conservative substitutions. Replacement of Lys- 84 by either Gln or Arg leads to virtually inactive enzymes, confirming chemical studies indicating that Lys- 84 is essential for catalysis. In contrast, substitution of Gln for Lys- 83 has only a slight effect on enzyme activity, whereas chemical modification causes considerable inactivation. Gln- 133, which has been shown by x-ray crystallography to reside near the contact region between the <b>catalytic</b> and regulatory <b>chains,</b> was replaced by Ala. This substitution has little effect on catalytic activity but leads to a marked increase in cooperativity. The Gln- 83 mutant, in contrast, exhibits much less cooperativity. Since a histidine residue may be involved in catalysis and His- 134 has been shown by x-ray diffraction studies to be in close proximity to the site of binding of a bisubstrate analog, His- 134 was replaced by Ala, yielding a mutant with only 5 % wild-type activity, considerable cooperativity, and lower affinity for aspartate and carbamoylphosphate. All of the mutants, unlike those in which charged or bulky residues replaced small side chains, bind the bisubstrate analog, which promotes the characteristic "swelling" of the enzymes indicative of the allosteric transition...|$|R

Careful determinations under conditions that minimized proteolysis {{showed that the}} molecule is a 1 : 1 stoichiometric complex of two polypeptide chains of 34 and 45 kDa. Pyridoxal phosphate is a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme (Ki = 1 microM). Reduction of the pyridoxal phosphate enzyme adduct with sodium boro[3 H]hydride showed that the active site {{is located on the}} 34 -kDa polypeptide. Affinity labeling with 5 '-[p-(fluorosulfonyl) benzoyl]adenosine, an ATP analog, suggested that the regulatory site is also located on the 34 -kDa species. While the function of the 45 -kDa subunit is unknown, neither carbamoyl phosphate synthetase nor dihydroorotase activities are associated with the ATCase. The molecular mass of the enzyme was determined by gel filtration, sedimentation velocity, and electron microscopy to be 464 kDa. Thus the enzyme is composed of six copies of the 34 -kDa polypeptide and six copies of the 45 -kDa polypeptide. The molecule has a Stokes' ratio of 70. 9 A and a frictional ratio of 1. 37, suggesting a compact globular shape.

The mutant enzyme with phenylalanine at position 240 has substantially reduced homotropic interactions and an increased affinity for the substrate aspartate but displays no alteration in maximal observed specific activity.

Heterotropic interactions of the mutant enzyme are altered to a lesser extent. The catalytic subunit derived from the mutant enzyme exhibits kinetics identical to that of the wild-type catalytic subunit. Reactivity of the mutant enzyme with p-hydroxymercuribenzoate suggests that the unligated enzyme exists in an altered conformation.

For these studies the endogenous zinc in the latter chains was replaced by nickel, which served as a discriminating spectral probe. The Ni(II) -enzyme was constructed by dissociating the native enzyme, separating the catalytic and regulatory subunits, removing Zn(II) from the latter, replacing it with Ni(II), and reconstituting the enzyme from native catalytic and Ni(II) -containing regulatory subunits. Ni(II) derivatives containing either six Ni(II) or five Ni(II) and one Zn(II) possess the allosteric properties of the native enzyme and exhibit absorption bands at 360 and 440 nm due to charge transfer transitions. Smaller bands were also observed at 665 and 720 nm from d-d transitions, which are consistent with tetrahedral geometry in the coordination sphere of nickel. Binding of the bisubstrate ligand N-(phosphonacetyl) -L-aspartate to the catalytic subunit of Ni(II) -aspartate transcarbamoylase perturbed the Ni(II) chromophore, giving rise to two difference spectral bands (at 390 and 465 nm). Spectral titrations showed that the conformational changes at the metal-ion-binding sites were complete even though about one-third of the active sites were unoccupied.
