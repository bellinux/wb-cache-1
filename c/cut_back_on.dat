5|$|Juenger {{also notes}} that SpongeBob could affect the ratings of other Nickelodeon {{programming}} because children often change channels to find their favorite program, then stay tuned into that network. Nickelodeon recently reduced its exposure in television. In {{the first quarter of}} 2012, the network <b>cut</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the number of episodes it aired by 16% compared with a year earlier.|$|E
5|$|For {{many poor}} {{women and men}} whose work hours have {{reached the point where}} they cannot <b>cut</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> leisure time anymore to make time for {{domestic}} and paid work, work intensity is an issue because they often intensify their work time by doing two or more activities at once, such as taking care of children while cooking. Work intensity can lead to many negative health consequences, such as lack of sleep, stress, and lack of recreation.|$|E
5|$|In other instances, {{managers}} deliberately {{used the}} reforms {{as an opportunity}} to cut wages, exaggerating wage cuts made by the ministries so that {{they would be able to}} <b>cut</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> overall expenditure. In one case, a manager of a concrete factory was sentenced to eight months corrective labour after being found guilty of using the reforms as a pretext to extract unpaid overtime from workers.|$|E

5|$|Chamberlain {{was made}} {{chairman}} of the Town Planning Committee. Under Chamberlain's direction Birmingham soon adopted {{one of the first}} town planning schemes in Britain. The start of war in 1914 prevented implementation of his plans. In 1915, Chamberlain became Lord Mayor of Birmingham. Apart from his father Joseph, five of Chamberlain's uncles had also attained the chief Birmingham civic dignity: they were Joseph's brother Richard Chamberlain, William and George Kenrick, Charles Beale, who had been four times Lord Mayor and Sir Thomas Martineau. As a Lord Mayor in wartime, Chamberlain had a huge burden of work and he insisted that his councillors and officials work equally hard. He halved the Lord Mayor's expense allowance and <b>cut</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the number of civic functions expected of the incumbent.|$|E
5|$|In the 1985 NBA Finals, the Lakers made amends {{for their}} {{previous}} eight losses to the Celtics by defeating them in six games. Even though the Lakers lost {{the first game}} by 34 points in the Memorial Day Massacre, they won 4 of the next 5 games, including Game 6 at the Boston Garden, to finally end the long years of frustration of failing to defeat the Celtics. These finals {{were the first to}} be played in the 2–3–2 format, which was suggested by Boston coach Red Auerbach to NBA commissioner David Stern, as he hoped to <b>cut</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the frequent traveling from Boston to Los Angeles.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the show, the {{producers}} from WCW/Turner Broadcasting System made several changes to the format, including reducing the overall time by 40 minutes. This forced AAA to change the first three matches from the traditional best-of-three falls to a single fall. The producers also <b>cut</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the elaborate entrances that AAA usually had for their major shows and did not allow AAA to have a dark match before the broadcast started to rev up the crowd. The producers also pushed to change the semi-main event to a singles match between El Hijo del Santo and Eddie Guerrero, but in the end, the match went on as originally planned and advertised.|$|E

5|$|Since Clough assumed office, he {{has made}} plans to {{digitize}} the Museum's collections, and offer more intensive K-12 educational programming. In November 2008, for the first time, the Smithsonian opened a board meeting to the public. Clough has made {{efforts to improve the}} Smithsonian's facilities and long-term planning, as well as plans to reorganize and <b>cut</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> staff and budget. In February 2012, Clough's travel expenses were probed by senator Charles E. Grassley, despite increased controls; Clough's travel must be approved by the Smithsonian's chief financial officer as part of the reforms enacted in the wake of alleged abuses by Secretary Small.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{returned}} to management on 8 October 2001 with Wrexham on a two-year contract, replacing Brian Flynn who had resigned after 12 years in charge, {{with the club}} 23rd in the Second Division. He was tasked with keeping the club steady whilst it struggled with financial problems. He decided to <b>cut</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the club's youth coaching spending, {{and as a result}} Wrexham's youth structure was downgraded from an Academy to a Centre of Excellence. He signed goalkeeper Marius Røvde, midfielder Jim Whitley, and gave striker Hector Sam his debut, but failed to keep Wrexham away from the relegation zone. With relegation confirmed, new signing Lee Jones scored all five goals in a 5–0 win over Cambridge United, leaving cause for optimism at the Racecourse Ground.|$|E

5|$|The {{packaging}} {{has undergone}} many changes since its inception. Unlike McDonald's, the company {{never used the}} clamshell style box made of Styrofoam, so when the environmental concerns over Styrofoam {{came to a head}} in the late 1980s, the company was able to tout its use of paperboard boxes for its sandwiches. To <b>cut</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the amount of paper that the company used, the paperboard box was fully eliminated in 1991 and was replaced with waxed paper. For a short time in 2002, the company used a gold-toned, aluminum foil wrapping for the sandwich as part of the 45th anniversary of the sandwich. The packaging was changed again in 2012 when the company moved to half wrapped sandwich packaged in a paper board box.|$|E
5|$|To aid his {{recovery}} from Tommy John surgery, Fernández <b>cut</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> {{the use of}} his fastball during spring training in 2016 and began working on his secondary pitches. Appearing as a pinch hitter in the 12th inning against the Atlanta Braves on July 1, Fernández doubled in two runs to put the Marlins ahead 7–5, which ended up being the final score. He became just the second pitcher in Marlins history to produce a game-winning hit, following Dennis Cook on August 1, 1997. Fernández appeared in the 2016 MLB All-Star Game.|$|E
5|$|Topiramate, a {{derivative}} of the naturally occurring sugar monosaccharide D-fructose, {{has been found}} effective in helping alcoholics quit or <b>cut</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the amount they drink. Evidence suggests that topiramate antagonizes excitatory glutamate receptors, inhibits dopamine release, and enhances inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid function. A 2008 review {{of the effectiveness of}} topiramate concluded that the results of published trials are promising, however, as of 2008, data was insufficient to support using topiramate in conjunction with brief weekly compliance counseling as a first-line agent for alcohol dependence. A 2010 review found that topiramate may be superior to existing alcohol pharmacotherapeutic options. Topiramate effectively reduces craving and alcohol withdrawal severity as well as improving quality-of-life-ratings.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Cutting</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> {{internal}} effort - In this mode, {{the effort}} exertion of the volitional entity is reduced so that less strain is incurred. This {{is done for}} instance through simplifying tasks, reassignment of work responsibilities and deprioritizing some tasks in organizational management, or by fiscal stimulus and task simplification in macroeconomic management and developmental economics to reduce the effort economic agents (such as businesses) exert in economic activities (such as trade, tax filing, production, business monitoring, employment creation).|$|R
50|$|Romita, {{increasingly}} {{called upon}} to do art corrections and touch-ups, and to interface with artists for ever-busy editor Lee, became Marvel's de facto art director. <b>Cutting</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> his Spider-Man workload, Romita began doing only layouts, with finished pencils by Don Heck or Jim Mooney for nearly every issue for a year-and-a-half (#57-75, Feb. 1968 - Aug. 1969). Romita then stepped back for six issues, drawing only covers while John Buscema laid out issues #76-81 (Sept. 1969 - Feb. 1970) for others to finish.|$|R

5|$|Yelp began {{a service}} called Yelp Deals in April 2011, but by August it <b>cut</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> Deals due to {{increased}} competition and market saturation. That September, the Federal Trade Commission investigated Yelp's allegations that Google was using Yelp web content without authorization and that Google's search engine algorithms favored Google Places over similar services provided by Yelp. In a January 2014 agreement, Google was not subject to anti-trust litigation from the FTC, but did have to allow services like Yelp the ability {{to opt out of}} having their data scraped and used on Google's websites.|$|E
5|$|Additional Native resentment {{resulted}} from Amherst's decision in February 1761 to <b>cut</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the gifts {{given to the}} Native Americans. Gift giving had been {{an integral part of}} the relationship between the French and the tribes of the pays d'en haut. Following a Native American custom that carried important symbolic meaning, the French gave presents (such as guns, knives, tobacco, and clothing) to village chiefs, who in turn redistributed these gifts to their people. By this process, the village chiefs gained stature among their people, and were thus able to maintain the alliance with the French. Amherst, however, considered this process to be a form of bribery that was no longer necessary, especially since he was under pressure to cut expenses after the war with France. Many Native Americans regarded this change in policy as an insult and an indication that the British looked upon them as conquered people rather than as allies.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 2006, Ahmad Dhani {{threatened}} to disband the group if Maia did not <b>cut</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> her performance schedule; he felt she was too busy, {{to the point of}} forgetting their children. Dhani later withdrew his threat, but– after becoming manager– limited the group to one performance a week. He then fired the group's manager, Vita Ramona, who {{threatened to}} bring Dhani to court if he did not apologize for perceived defamation. This situation was exacerbated when Mulan publicly complained of not receiving her share of the band's money and a lack of transparency in the management. She resigned on 30 January 2007, after waiting ten days for her open letter to the management to receive a reply. Mulan then hired a lawyer and sued Dhani, resulting in her contract fee being returned.|$|E

When Wałęsa complained that the Polish government was not keeping to its promise of allowing the independent labour movement enough of an opportunity to publicize itself, Jagielski indicated that {{he would try to}} give the movement better access to the Polish press, and to the Polish radio network. Jagielski led a delegation that went to a meeting in Moscow of Comecon, the Eastern Bloc economic community, during January 1981. That month, the government declared that the poor economy was forcing it to <b>cut</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> its promise of ensuring that Polish workers did not have to work on Saturdays, and that it would offer a number of Saturdays as work-free instead.|$|E
5|$|NY414 {{has been}} {{truncated}} twice over the years. The {{first of these}} occurred on January1, 1949, when it was <b>cut</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> its southern end to Corning. NY414 was truncated to its current northern terminus in the mid-1960s following {{the construction of the}} super two highway for US104 between Sodus and NY414. US104 continued to use the former alignment of NY414 along Lake Bluff Road to connect to Ridge Road until the remainder of the super two east to Red Creek was completed in the early 1970s. This portion of Lake Bluff Road is now maintained by Wayne County as CR254. In Seneca County, NY414 was realigned slightly in the early 1950s to bypass the hamlet of Romulus to the east, moving it off CR148 and NY96 and onto a new road leading directly to Ovid.|$|E
5|$|Pineda {{finished}} the 2011 {{season with a}} 9–10 record and a 3.74 ERA.

In 28 starts, he struck out 173 hitters while walking just 55 over 171 innings. Pineda struck out 24.9% of all batters faced, which was the third highest strikeout percentage in MLB. He also finished fifth in voting for American League Rookie of the Year Award, behind Jeremy Hellickson, Mark Trumbo, Eric Hosmer, and Iván Nova, and ahead of teammate Dustin Ackley, who finished sixth. After the season, Keith Law ranked Pineda as the 20th best player under the age of 25.|$|E
