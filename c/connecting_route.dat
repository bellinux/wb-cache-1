5|$|M-105 was the {{designation}} of a former state trunkline highway in The Thumb region of the US state of Michigan. It served as a <b>connecting</b> <b>route</b> between M-53 in Popple and M-83 (now M-142) near Elkton. The designation was in use in the 1920s and 1930s, {{and it has not}} been reused since.|$|E
5|$|The first {{parts of}} SR 125 {{were added to}} the state highway system in 1933, <b>connecting</b> <b>Route</b> 94 with U.S. Route 80 (US 80). In the 1964 state highway renumbering, what was signed as Route 67 was {{transferred}} to the new SR 125. After several delays in funding and in planning, the highway was extended north to SR 52 and south to SR 54 in the early 2000s.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, {{the council}} {{announced}} that a park and ride facility would be developed next to the M32 to help alleviate congestion in the city centre. The project was expected to create 1,500 parking spaces and cost £191 million. In 2015, construction began on a bus-only junction between junctions 1 and 2, on land partly allocated to the Stapleton Allotments and near the Stoke Park estate. The project {{is part of the}} North Fringe to Hengrove MetroBus rapid transit route package, and involves creating new slip roads, a <b>connecting</b> <b>route</b> to Stoke Lane and a new bridge over the M32 to be completed by mid-2016. The bridge was lifted into place in June, which required closing the M32 to all traffic.|$|E

50|$|Much {{concern was}} made of the {{shedding}} of routes across Scotland, but Flybe stated that BA <b>Connect</b> <b>routes</b> will be kept and expanded. On 6 March 2007 Flybe stated {{that they would not be}} operating any former BA Connect services from Bristol. Consequently, the last flights on any of BA <b>Connect's</b> <b>routes</b> from Bristol was on 24 March 2007.|$|R
5|$|The first {{plans for}} serving Hammerfest with an airline route was {{launched}} in a government plan from 1933. It proposed that flights in Northern Norway be carried out using seaplanes, and proposed Hammerfest as one of several stops on a route from Trondheim to Vadsø. Norwegian Air Lines (DNL) received the concession to operate all routes in Norway from 1935, resulting in the coastal route from Bergen to Tromsø commencing. The following year a <b>connecting</b> <b>route</b> from Tromsø via Hammerfest to Honningsvåg was subcontracted to Widerøe. The water aerodrome in Hammerfest was located at Rypefjord and consisted of a buoy where the aircraft parked; passengers were transported to the aircraft in a boat. All flights were terminated in 1939 and remained so {{until the end of}} World War II in 1945.|$|E
5|$|As {{the capital}} of Silla, {{commerce}} and trading in Gyeongju developed early on. Samguk Sagi has records on the establishment of Gyeongdosi (capital area market) in March, 490 during King Soji's reign, and Dongsi (East Market) in 509, during King Jijeung's reign. In the 1830s, Gyeongju had five five-day markets which remained very active until the late 1920s. Due to its size Gyeongju Bunaejang (Gyeongju village market) {{was referred to as}} one of the two leading markets in the Yeongnam area, along with Daegu Bunaejang. Transportation developed in the late period of the Japanese occupation, as the Jungang Line and the Daegu Line and the <b>connecting</b> <b>route</b> between Pohang and the northwestern part of Japan were set up, leading to increasing population and developing commerce. After the 1960s, traditional periodic markets gradually transformed into regular markets as the city was flourishing. In periodic markets, agricultural and marine products, industrial products, living necessaries, wild edible greens, herbs, and cattle are mainly traded. As of 2006, Gyeongju had eight regular markets, nine periodic markets and the Gyeongju department store. Traditional periodic markets declined and have become token affairs these days.|$|E
5|$|Since December 1974, the North Vietnamese {{prepared}} for the offensive by conducting raids on various South Vietnamese outposts and broadcasting fake radio messages to keep South Vietnamese commanders guessing about the location of their next assault. While the South Vietnamese units were kept occupied by Communist diversions, North Vietnamese General Hoang Minh Thao began moving his troops into attacking positions. The VPA 7th Combat Engineer Regiment was tasked with <b>connecting</b> <b>Route</b> 14 at North Vo Dinh with Highway 19 near Mang Yang Pass, which surpassed the district of Kontum. The VPA 10th Infantry Division began withdrawing from Duc Lap, and only left a small force behind to continue the bombardment of Pleiku, as artillery and tanks units took positions north of Kontum. The 320A Infantry Division deployed a small unit west of Pleiku to apply additional pressure on South Vietnamese positions at La Son, Thanh An, and Don Tam. Elements of the 95th Regiment conducted blocking operations along Highway 19 to stop South Vietnamese reinforcements from reaching their destination. The 198th Special Forces Regiment raided South Vietnamese depots at Pleiku, while the main formation of the 10th and 320A Infantry Divisions marched on Ban Me Thuot.|$|E

5|$|The state built a bypass of the Valley Boulevard {{portion of}} the route in the early-to-mid-1930s, leaving the old road near Diamond Bar and heading {{northeast}} through the foothills, along the present freeway alignment and Mission Boulevard. To the south, the legislature added then-unrelated Route180 along State College Boulevard in 1933, <b>connecting</b> <b>Route</b> 2 (I-5) near the Santa Ana River with Route 175 (Orangethorpe Avenue, later replaced by SR 91) near Placentia. By 1955, the Brea Canyon Freeway was proposed to begin at the Santa Ana Freeway (I-5) near La Veta Avenue in Santa Ana and head north, paralleling Routes 180 and 19 to Pomona. The portion northeast of Diamond Bar into Pomona soon {{became part of the}} planned Pomona Freeway, {{and the name of the}} remainder was changed to Orange Freeway. The state legislature altered the definition of Route19 to reflect this in 1957 by moving its south end to Santa Ana.|$|E

25|$|The Central of Georgia {{became part}} of the system in 1963, and the former Norfolk Southern Railway was {{acquired}} in 1974. Despite these small acquisitions, the Southern disdained the merger trend when it swept the railroad industry in the 1960s, choosing to remain a regional carrier. In 1978 President L. Stanley Crane said the refusal to add routes through merger was a mistake, especially the decision not to add a <b>connecting</b> <b>route</b> to Chicago.|$|E
25|$|In August 2001, landowners {{that were}} {{shareholders}} {{of the route}} filed a lawsuit, claiming that profits and traffic usage were less than expected. The failure of the route was attributed to the price for truck traffic ($16), the continuation of U.S. government policies banning Mexican trucks from {{the interior of the}} United States (which had been expected to be abolished under the North American Free Trade Agreement), and the approval of a new freeway <b>connecting</b> <b>route</b> from the World Trade International Bridge crossing along Loop 20 to Interstate 35.|$|E
25|$|A {{significant}} portion of Montrose Road, Randolph Road, and Cherry Hill Road existed along or near their present alignments by the early 20th century. The major exceptions were Montrose Road west of I-270 and Randolph Road from North Bethesda to Glenmont. Much of the county highways were improved as modern roads by the mid-1940s. Randolph Road from Glenmont to Colesville was originally known as Glenmont Road and constructed as Maryland Route 183 in the late 1910s. The North BethesdaGlenmont stretch of Randolph Road was built as a four-lane divided highway in the 1950s and early 1960s. MD 183 was expanded to a divided highway in the mid-1970s then transferred to county control in the early 1980s. Montrose Road was reconstructed as a temporary <b>connecting</b> <b>route</b> associated {{with the construction of}} I-270 in the late 1950s; the highway was extended to Potomac in the late 1980s. The first phase of Montrose Parkway was constructed in the late 2000s; the parkway will be extended east to MD 586 in the future.|$|E
