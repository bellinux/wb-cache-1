We {{present the}} surface {{photometry}} of star <b>clusters</b> <b>in</b> the nearby dwarf elliptical galaxies NGC 185 and NGC 205, obtained from deep HST WFPC 2 F 555 W (V) and F 814 W (I) images. We have obtained surface brightness and color profiles of six star <b>clusters</b> <b>in</b> NGC 185, seven star <b>clusters</b> <b>in</b> NGC 205, and one recently discovered non-stellar object in NGC 205. The surface brightness profiles of ten star clusters are fitted well by the King model, {{and those of}} four star clusters are fitted well by the power-law. Three out of ten star clusters fitted well with King model show signs of tidal tails. It is essential to understand the structures of star <b>clusters</b> <b>in</b> studying the dynamical evolutions of star clusters. There have been several studies on the structures of star <b>clusters</b> <b>in</b> nearby galaxies (LMC, SMC, Fornax dwarf spheroidal, WLM, M 31, and NGC 5128).

5|$|There are {{approximately}} 460 globular clusters {{associated with the}} Andromeda Galaxy. The most massive of these clusters, identified as Mayall II, nicknamed Globular One, has a greater luminosity than any other known globular <b>cluster</b> <b>in</b> the Local Group of galaxies.

Globular One (or G1) has several stellar populations and a structure too massive for an ordinary globular. As a result, some consider G1 to be the remnant core of a dwarf galaxy that was consumed by Andromeda in the distant past.

5|$|If Sedna {{formed in}} its current location, the Sun's {{original}} protoplanetary disc must have extended as far as 75AU into space. Also, Sedna's initial orbit must have been approximately circular, otherwise its formation by the accretion of smaller bodies into a whole {{would not have been}} possible, because the large relative velocities between planetesimals would have been too disruptive. Therefore, it must have been tugged into its current eccentric orbit by a gravitational interaction with another body. In their initial paper, Brown, Rabinowitz and colleagues suggested three possible candidates for the perturbing body: an unseen planet beyond the Kuiper belt, a single passing star, or one of the young stars embedded with the Sun in the stellar <b>cluster</b> <b>in</b> which it formed.|$|E

Investigation of the area yielded only ten RR Lyrae variables—consistent with the Milky Way's halo and thick disk populations rather than a separate dwarf spheroidal galaxy. On the other hand, a globular <b>cluster</b> <b>in</b> Puppis, NGC 2298—which appears {{to be part of the}} Canis Major dwarf system—is extremely metal-poor, suggesting it did not arise from the Milky Way's thick disk, and instead is of extragalactic origin.|$|E
