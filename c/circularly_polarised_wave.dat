40|$|The main {{objective}} of this work was to study the behaviour of antennas constructed using textured surface substrates, and {{to a certain extent}} provide control over their farfield radiation patterns. The properties of the textured surface have been analysed in terms of numerical electromagnetic simulation and by measurement, revealing both artificial magnetic conductor and electromagnetic bandgap properties. It is shown through measurement that by engineering the reflection phase response of such surfaces they can be made to reflect an incident <b>circularly</b> <b>polarised.</b> <b>wave</b> with the same sense as that of the incident polarisation, or with a sense opposite to that of the incident wave. Such properties can be potentially useful in radar cross-section control. Having characterised the textured surface, we then demonstrate its use as an efficient ground plane for a wire dipole. For this structure, we demonstrate that the dipole excites surface currents which, in turn, contribute to the far-field radiation pattern. This is confirmed by the examination of the 'measured near-field and far-field energy distributions close to the antenna. By introducing surface anisotropy to the structure, we further demonstrate far-field radiation pattern control. A novel method of feeding such structures was proposed, using a slot etched in the ground plane, in order to provide excitation to the antenna. Further, we show that careful placement of surface mounted resistors connecting adjacent patches can influence the confinement of surface currents, and as a result produce a more directive radiation pattern. We also show that by selectively interconnecting textured elements, the current distribution can be modified such that we can switch the far-field pattern from sum to difference mode.

We thus apply ideas developed for Jupiter's magnetosphere, being a well-studied rotationally-dominated analogue in our solar system, {{to the case of}} fast-rotating UCDs. We explain the properties of the radio emission from UCDs by showing that it would arise from the electric currents resulting from an angular velocity shear in the fast-rotating magnetic field and plasma, i. e. by an extremely powerful analogue of the process which causes Jupiter's auroras. Such a velocity gradient indicates that these bodies interact significantly with their space environment, resulting in intense auroral emissions. These results strongly suggest that auroras occur on bodies outside our solar system. Comment: Accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journa...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{evolution}} of non-linear <b>circularly</b> <b>polarised</b> Alfven <b>waves</b> by solving numerically the time-dependent equations of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) in one dimension. We examine the behaviour of the waves and find that different physical mechanisms are relevant in different ranges of beta. In a low beta plasma the wave may undergo a parametric decay. This is because the wave excites a density enhancement that travels slower than the wave itself and thus interacts with the wave. When beta is greater or equal to one the density enhancement does not interact with the wave and no decay takes place, instead the Alfven wave is reflected against the density enhancement. The reflection zone propagates with the speed 1 /n of the Alfven speed. Because of that the magnetic flux is conserved which results in an amplification of the oscillating magnetic field by a factor 1 /n. We find that n depends on beta, and that in particular it is less or equal to one for values of beta ~ 1 and is greater or equal to one for beta >> 1. We discuss the relevance of these mechanisms to the acceleration of the solar wind, and the triggering of MHD turbulence in the polar wind region.

A convenient way to describe the polarisation of two dimensional electromagnetic fields is given by the Stokes parameters. This thesis deals with different aspects of wave polarisation and electromagnetic field measurements. A generalisation of the Stokes parameters to three dimensions is presented. The theory {{has been used to}} develop methods and systems for obtaining the polarisation parameters of electromagnetic waves. The methods can be applied {{for a wide range of}} electromagnetic fields, measured both on ground and onboard satellites. The applications include, e. g., direction-finding, polarisation analysis, radar, and several examples in the field of wireless communication. Further applications are given in the analysis of satellite data, where a whistler wave is considered. Whistlers are <b>circularly</b> <b>polarised</b> electromagnetic <b>waves</b> propagating in the magnetosphere along the geomagnetic field. Dispersion in the magnetospheric plasma make the whistler frequencies travel at different speeds and the signal takes the form of a chirp.

A statistic analysis of ionospheric stimulated electromagnetic emissions (SEE) is also presented. SEE is generated by injecting a powerful high frequency radio wave into the ionosphere. It is shown that the SEE features have a statistical behaviour indistinguishable from the amplitude and phase distributions of narrow-band Gaussian noise. The results suggests that SEE cannot be explained by simple coherent processes alone. Finally, an expression for the complex Poynting theorem is derived for the general case of anharmonic fields.

The interaction between a target analyte (the biological molecule) and the probe results in a modulation of the polarisation of the emission, which is readily, studied using <b>circularly</b> <b>polarised</b> luminescence spectroscopy. <b>Circularly</b> <b>polarised</b> luminescence spectroscopy {{is based on}} the differential emission of left and right circularly polarized radiation by luminescent chiral systems. The primary observables in <b>circularly</b> <b>polarised</b> luminescence spectroscopy are the emission circular intensity differential. The systems used in this study are the luminescent Lanthanide (III) ion complexes, which have proven to be a productive area of research due to their unique optical properties enabling their use in a wide range of applications. A major drawback to using Lanthanide (III) ion is their low extinction coefficients; hence the antenna effect is often used to overcome this problem. In this way, the antenna chromophore absorbs incoming radiation and transfers the energy to the Lanthanide leading to indirect excitation of the Lanthanide (III) ion.

40|$|The {{greenhouse}} vegetable {{industry in}} Northern Europe is an extensive, high value and energy-intensive horticultural sector that {{is vital for}} food supply and security in Europe. Despite technical and legislative innovation {{over a period of}} thirty years, little improvement has been made in the reduction of absolute energy con- sumption for heating greenhouse growing space. A novel free-space microwave system for heating greenhouse crops volumetrically is proposed. and demonstrated. It is estimated that such a system can use one-third of the energy of a conventional heating system. This would allow for significant reductions in energy consumption, reduce environmental damage and provide financial savings of several billion Euros. Experiments on real plants demonstrate microwave heating utilising ISM band frequencies as a viable method for heating growing plants from seedling to fruition and reveal plant and fruit quality that is comparable to that attained by conventional heating. Non-uniformity of electric-field distribution within the plants, both between and within plant components, is identified as the main limiting factor during microwave heating and can result in localised burning. This can cause catastrophic failure when occurring on stems. The necessary reduction in power and the resultant decrease in average plant temperature delays development relative to conventionally-heated plants. Poor leaf heating and development is the main source of delay in fruit formation. A novel practical technique for improving inter- and intra-object heating uniformity is thus also presented and demonstrated. This method utilises <b>circularly</b> <b>polarised</b> incident <b>waves</b> to allow more regular heating of plant components and greater consistency of heating between different plant components. Furthermore, this technique can be applied generally to other dielectric heating scenarios where heating non-uniformity is a problem, specifically in industrial processes.
