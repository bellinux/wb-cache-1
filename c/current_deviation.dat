50|$|The {{route of}} the highway between Tumblong and Tarcutta is the third {{route of the}} highway in this location. The {{original}} route led west from Tumblong along the Murrumbidgee River, before turning south over difficult country, crossing {{what is now the}} Sturt Highway and rejoining the current route of the highway as Lower Tarcutta Road. This was replaced in December 1938 by the first Tumblong deviation, to the east of the current route. The main features of this section of the highway were a deep, narrow cutting and the reinforced concrete bowstring arch bridge over Hillas Creek. This bridge has been preserved as it is one of only two bridges in New South Wales built to this design, and is visible on the western side of the highway close to the interchange with the Snowy Mountains Highway.

50|$|A major {{advantage}} of the DME is that each drop has a smooth and uncontaminated surface free from any adsorbed analyte or impurity. The self-renewing electrode {{does not need to}} be cleaned or polished like a solid electrode. This advantage comes at the cost of a working electrode with a constantly changing surface area. Since the drops are produced predictably the changing surface area can be accounted for or even used advantageously. In addition the drops' growth causes capacitive current and faradaic current. These changing current effects combined with experiments where the potential is continuously changed can result in noisy traces. In some experiments the traces are continually sampled, showing all the <b>current</b> <b>deviation</b> resulting from the drop growth. Other sampling methods smooth the data by sampling the current at the electrode only once per drop at a specific size. The DME's periodic expansion into the solution and hemispherical shape also affects the way the analyte diffuses to the electrode surface. The DME consists of a fine capillary with a bore size of 20-50 µm.|$|E

30|$|This {{paper is}} focused on the {{consistency}} evaluation of the current distributions obtained from short-circuit tests. It is clear that the consistency of current distribution can be evaluated by to what extent Kirchhoff’s current law (KCL) is met in the AT feeding system. Therefore, the <b>current</b> <b>deviations</b> at each node are to be calculated. As the <b>current</b> <b>deviations</b> vary with the fault site and system short-circuit capacity, they are normalized by the short-circuit current. The maximum and mean of the normalized <b>current</b> <b>deviations</b> are selected as the evaluation indices. The short-circuit current is estimated with the generalized method of symmetrical components (GMSC). It is found that the short-circuit current varies greatly with the utilized equation, and its standard deviation may also be selected as an index. To obtain a unified index, the three indices are summed. The unified index is then used in two case studies, and the results show that it can clearly distinguish the consistency of the short-circuit test.|$|R

The functional nature of these adjustments was highlighted by concomitant and opposite variation in the variability of current speed and <b>current</b> <b>deviation.</b> In all cases, an increase in the standard deviation of speed was accompanied by a reduction in the standard deviation of <b>current</b> <b>deviation.</b> Neither time to make adjustments nor acceleration capabilities modified the observed kinematic patterns, but they did modulate the adjustments that were produced.

30|$|The {{share of}} voltage source {{converter}} (VSC) technology is increasing in conventional power systems, {{and it is}} penetrating into specific transportation systems such as electric vehicles, railways, and ships. Researchers are identifying feasible methods to improve the performance of railway electrification systems (RESs) by utilizing VSC-based medium-voltage direct current (MVDC) railways. The continuous motion of electric trains makes the catenary resistance a variable quantity, {{as compared to the}} traction substation (TSS), and affects the current-sharing behavior of the system. A modified droop control technique is proposed in this paper for VSC-based MVDC RES to provide more effective current-sharing while maintaining catenary voltages above the minimum allowable limit. The droop coefficient is selected through an exponential function based on the ratio between the concerned TSS current and the system average current. This enables small adjustments of droop values in less concerning marginal <b>current</b> <b>deviations,</b> and provides higher droop adjustments for large <b>current</b> <b>deviations.</b> Meanwhile, the catenary voltages are regulated by considering the voltage data at the midpoint between two TSSs, which experiences the lowest voltages owing to the larger distance from the TSSs. The proposed techniques are validated via simulations and experiments.|$|R

3000|$|To {{improve the}} {{accuracy}} of fault location system, several short-circuit tests need [...] to be conducted before being brought into service in autotransformer (AT) feeding systems for high-speed railways in China. However, no systematic algorithm yet exists to evaluate {{the consistency of the}} current distribution of short-circuit tests. A methodology is proposed in this paper to address this problem. Based on Kirchhoff’s current law and the generalized method of symmetrical components, the <b>current</b> <b>deviations</b> of the AT feeding systems are analysed and then normalized with the short-circuit current as they vary greatly with systems and short-circuit sites. It is also found that the short-circuit current varies with the calculation methods, and its unbiased standard deviation also reflects the consistency of the short-circuit test. The mean and maximum of the <b>current</b> <b>deviations,</b> as well as the unbiased standard deviation of the short-circuit current, show the consistency of the short-circuit test from different aspects, although the last two items are highly relevant. Therefore, a unified evaluation index is defined as the sum of the three items, and then applied in two case studies to test its performance. The results show that, the proposed index can clearly distinguish the consistency of the short-circuit tests and may be used to sort the short-circuit tests for fault location systems. Besides, some short-circuit tests may have very poor consistency indices, and thus are not applicable to the tuning of fault location systems. In the authors’ opinion, the determination of the threshold of the proposed index needs further investigation.|$|R
