40|$|This study {{presents}} a diagnostic analysis of how {{two types of}} governance structures (water user associations versus <b>collective</b> <b>irrigation</b> institutions) at Hubei, issue their impacts on local irrigation governance and management, to produce a collective action outcome in irrigation systems. In particular, it focuses on (1) at the meso level, institutional analyses of irrigation management incorporate physical, community, and institutional attributes, and their interactions to configure possible pathways to collective outcomes within Hubei’s settings, and (2) at the micro level, the underlying mechanisms that offer individuals incentives to cooperate {{with each other for}} irrigation activities. Drawing upon a theoretical debate about rationales for promoting or limiting the establishment and development of water user associations, and empirical puzzling phenomena observed in Central China, three research hypotheses are posited accordingly. Determinants of collective outcomes in local irrigation governance and management are highlighted from irrigation literature. Employing Elinor Ostrom’s Institutional Analysis and Development Framework, an analytical framework exploring irrigation governance patterns in Central China is introduced. A mixed research method is applied in this study. At the meso level, 32 irrigation systems are selected to run a Qualitative Comparative Analysis; at the micro level, four irrigation systems are identified out for an in-depth comparative case study. In the end, three pathways to collective action, and four pathways to water adequacy, are generalized respectively. Evidence from 32 irrigation systems in central China indicates that both WUA-managed <b>irrigation</b> systems and <b>collective</b> <b>irrigation</b> systems have the capacity to organize <b>collective</b> <b>irrigation</b> activities successfully in local settings. For one thing, WUA {{is only one of the}} many factors affecting collective outcomes, and that the impact of WUA really depends on how it is nested within the larger configuration of factors; thus, challenging the belief of many government officials and analysts that WUA institution is a panacea for irrigation problems. For the other, <b>collective</b> <b>irrigation</b> systems could also achieve collective action, if attributes configured appropriately. This demonstrates that <b>collective</b> <b>irrigation</b> institution, in and of itself, is not automatically malign; given this, moves towards participatory governance do not necessarily render traditional hierarchical government interventions obsolete. Last but not least, this study also identifies a third governance institution, namely, the lineage group. Findings indicate that as informal solidary entities, lineage groups have important contributions to rural governance, as long as they are nested within the appropriate attributes configurations. Referring to the pathways to water adequacy, it is found that the emergence of collective action alone does not necessarily translate into water adequacy at the tail end of the irrigation systems. The four case studies not only entail some pathways to collective action, but also exemplify complicated and diverse reasons that might lead to collective failures. Comparing the successful cases with the failure ones, boundary rules, position rules, choice rules, and payoff rules explain the systematic differences at the operational level, while information rules, aggregation rules, and scope rules that operate at the collective level, appear to have minimal effect here. published_or_final_versionPolitics and Public AdministrationDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

40|$|The main {{theme of}} this thesis is to analyze the impact of supply chain of {{perishable}} agricultural products on income derived from vegetables. The study is conducted particularly focusing on <b>irrigation</b> <b>cooperatives</b> located in the southern zone of Tigray. This {{is due to the}} highest number of <b>irrigation</b> <b>cooperatives</b> members in the region. Among the vegetables the particular emphasis of the study is on income derived from three vegetables. These are onion, potato and tomato. These vegetables are preferred, on one hand for the reason that they are major sources of income in <b>irrigation</b> <b>cooperatives,</b> {{and on the other hand}} for the reason that there are so many constraints in relation to the perishable nature of the products which affects the producer’s income. A total of 120 households from vegetables producers <b>irrigation</b> <b>cooperatives</b> (16 female headed households and 104 male headed households) drawn from two southern zone Woredas. To collect the necessary data for the analysis structured and pre tested questionnaires are used. Focused group discussion and key informant interview are also conducted. Secondary data on basic agricultural and population is also collected to strengthen the analysis. The analysis is conducted using descriptive statistics and empirically. The analysis of the collected data showed that most of the households are illiterate (40. 8 %). The average age of the households is 40. 03 years. The average family size is about 5. 41 of which the active labor force is 3. The average land holding is about 0. 47 hectare per household of which 0. 25 hectares of land on averages used for vegetable production per household. The average ownership of livestock is 4. 34 TLU. The majority of the households in the study area become a member of <b>irrigation</b> <b>cooperative</b> voluntarily. The majority of the households identified that irrigation water management and provision of fertilizer as a major benefit obtained from the cooperative. The average years of experience as a vegetable producer of the households is 6. 7 years and as cooperative members the average years are 4. 6. The income sources of the households are both from agricultural and non agricultural income sources. The average income the households received in the crop year 2008 / 09 was 10, 672. 15 birr. Of the total income the average income from off farm activities was 1, 095. 25 (10. 26 %) birr. From agricultural activities the households on average received 1267. 45 (11. 9 %), 6, 719. 83 (62. 97 %), 1589. 61 (14. 9 %) and 6. 66 birr from crops, vegetables, livestock and bee colony respectively. The xvi total income received from sold onion, potato and tomatoes were 806, 380 birr in the study area. A total of 748 quintal of onion, 662 quintal of potato and 953 quintal of tomatoes were sold in the production year 2008 / 09. The average price received per quintal for onion, potato and tomatoes were 364. 34 birr, 352. 65 birr and 315. 20 birr respectively. This income was the highest income received by the households from agricultural income sources. From the identified market channels the channel that stretched as producer – wholesaler retailers, producer – cooperatives – wholesalers - consumers, and producer – wholesalers - out of region are some of the forms of supply chain used for vegetables by the produces. In the supply chain of vegetables wholesalers are found to be the dominant buyers of vegetables. Among the constraints of income from vegetables land size, fertilizer in terms of its cost, perishable nature of the product, shortage of improved seed, irrigation water shortage, storage, technical assistance both for production and marketing, lack of training from the cooperatives and disease and pests are among the major ten rated constraints of income from vegetables. The econometrics result for the determinants of income from vegetables, among the hypothesized seventeen variables six of them found significant. These are vegetable post harvest loss, crop income, distance from major market, distance from major road, off farm income and livestock income. Livestock income is the only variable which affects vegetable income positively. Post harvest loss and crop income are highly significant factors to affect income from vegetables. Other variables like land size, credit, extension service, price information and improved seeds are not significant as expected though they exhibited positive relationship with vegetable income. Based on the constraints to increase income from vegetables, improving the availability and developing ways in reducing the price of inputs, developing drought resistance varieties of seeds, developing crop insurance schemes with minimum premiums, developing farm plan budget, analyzing the cost benefit of market choice, analyzing the opportunity cost of crop and vegetable production are some of the recommendations suggested to increase income of the households in the production of vegetables...|$|R

It reveals that high irrigation costs are progressively excluding the poor, who are unable to generate a cash income from other activities they need to fund irrigation. In addition, the operation of collective schemes involving the poor is being jeopardized by the development of private irrigation schemes, which benefit from hidden subsidies appropriated by local elites. This results in unequal access to irrigation, which can cause resentment at community level.

40|$|In recent decades, {{water has}} been {{subjected}} to different commodification and de-collectivization processes. Increasingly, this is also affecting <b>collective</b> <b>irrigation</b> water management. Critical analysis of this privatization and de-collectivization wave in the irrigation sector has mainly focused on neoliberal institutional policies and market-oriented legislation. However, subtly and silently but equally determinant, the adoption of water-saving technologies is fostering the penetration of private enterprise and market-based governance into these hydro-social settings. This paper discusses this phenomenon through a case study of the community of Senyera in Valencia, Spain, tracking the privatization and subsequent contestation and re-takeover of water management by irrigation system users. The article shows how privatization removes users’ autonomy in the name of common well-being, and increases irrigation costs in a context of little transparency. But the case also highlights users’ capacity to re-value and re-signify their past collective action, remembering and ‘re-membering to’ the collective. Senyera water users critically and reflexively analyse privatization, reconstruct societal relationships around and embedded inside the new technology, and re-collectivize and re-moralize irrigation management in a new hydro-social scenario...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the connection between management of canal (gravity) irrigation and farmers’ social behavior. From this perspective, we examine the benefits of a rural canal irrigation project, based on our hypothesis that social behaviors of local farmers are influenced by the availability of canal irrigation due to the <b>collective</b> <b>irrigation</b> management required in irrigated societies. The present paper (1) measures social behavior through behavioral game experiments, and (2) estimates the effects of irrigation, neighborhood, as well as individual characteristics. Drawing on the results of dictator game and ultimatum game as the dependent variables, with a household survey on 245 villagers in the province of Bohol, the Philippines, we employ the HLM (Hierarchical Linear Modeling) method which was originally designed to explore neighborhood effects and social contexts. To date, the model has provided quantitative analyses of the latter. Yet, it has not been fully utilized for neighborhood effects studies. Our regression result shows that the level of measured social behavior is fairly associated with 1) access to irrigation water in the village, 2) other neighborhood characteristics (e. g., village-level averages of schooling years, asset, and yield) 3) household’s socioeconomic and agricultural characteristics (e. g., household-level schooling years, asset, and yield). The result indicates that the availability of irrigation water in the village does not only improve agricultural productivity but also enhances social relationship among farmers, which would add to the importance of irrigation investment in rural areas...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{transcription}} of the 2000 ’s European Water Framework Directive in France has led {{to define}} maximum volumes that can be abstracted in water bodies. In many French contexts, it requires reducing more or less drastically current water consumption, especially in agriculture where farmers were granted permits by the water policy authority, regardless the real level of water availability. To do so, French water law imposes, where water bodies are structurally in water scarcity, to create irrigation associations charged to share available water between farmers. And the challenge is particularly high in the groundwater case, where farmers are not embedded in <b>collective</b> <b>irrigation</b> schemes.

In five cases, researchers took the lead of these workshops, and in the last one it was directly carried by a stakeholder (an Agriculture Chamber), which allows to test the transferability of such a method in real context with a direct implementing goal. Lessons are drawn at several levels. Firstly, debating on contrasted scenarios is a robust way to facilitate discussions on something not implemented yet in France. Secondly, the context highly matters, in particular the perception of the reality of groundwater scarcitylevel. Thirdly, to debate on groundwater management tools has to be firstly embedded in a more general discussion, on the future of agriculture or at least on more broadly water challenges (like in terms of quantity and quality) ...|$|R
30|$|The {{previous}} agent-based {{model by}} Heim et al. (2018) revealed spatial-economic inequalities. This study extends the previous model to include socio-economic drivers of land-settlement such as tribal affiliation and clan-formation. Both scenarios developed with the extended agent-based model reveal that clan-formation is inevitable {{under the current}} system. A trade-off can be observed between social mix or segregation within clans and efficient land-allocation to clan members. Spatial mixing, as the process of clan-formation, is further constrained by the urgency of individuals to actually settle down, build a home and start a family (compare Scholz 1990; Belgacem 2011; Al Gharibi 2014; Benkari 2017; Shouman 2017). This life-changing decision blocks the mobility of a plot-owner for a long time. For the model, this means that once the initial plots have been settled, {{there seem to be}} not enough matching opportunities to create a competitive market. Thus, the following phases cannot accommodate trades motivated by tribal affiliation explicitly, yet also not exclude them totally. The study suggests that Oman is closer to the metaphorical ‘salad bowl’ described by Belgacem (2011) as ‘segregationist division’, where tribal groups might get relocated but not dissolved, than the ‘melting pot’. Incidentally, the land-allocation system strengthens the tribal power on a local level and forms a third aspect contrary to the intended purposes of the land-allocation system a striking parallel to Wilkinson (1977) central thesis that a “tribally organised population running a <b>collective</b> <b>irrigation</b> (and spatial distribution) system cannot emerge under a centralised state” (additions by the authors). Taking limitless mobility of the clan members into account, the simulation tests all desired properties, which would require excessive coordination between clans and individuals in real life. Clan-formation will thus never reach absolute states as described by the model, but gradually slows down, a further indication why the process is hard to back by empirical data, but is a recurring subject among younger Omanis that suffer from the impossibility to access the real-estate market. The simulation results confirm that emergent urban phenomena such as partial settlement, land speculation and spatial mobility can be linked to.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} hypotheses regarding <b>collective</b> {{actions for}} <b>irrigation</b> management, {{with the help}} of evolutionary game theory. Data for the analysis were collected by the author from the irrigation system of rural Yunnan, China. An econometric analysis reveals that collective action will be forthcoming in rural communities where few nonfarm job opportunities are provided, the degree of income disparity is quite small, and resource restrictions are moderately problematic. The finding that communities without local government intervention outperform those with intervention supports the proverbial view that external agencies should delegate significant parts of the control rights of common pool resources to immediate stakeholders. ...|$|R

This is a fairly successful system, functioning for decades in the study area. Check-dams overcome water scarcity faced by farmers during the summer irrigation season and thereby {{play a crucial role in}} farming. We identify issues in the management of check-dams, noting how this traditional water harvesting and conservation system suits the local geographic conditions and needs to be sustained and promoted.

40|$|Farmers {{continue}} to show great differences in irrigation water use, {{even for a}} given location and crop. Irrigation advisory services have narrowed the gap between scientific knowledge and on-farm scheduling, but their success has been limited. The performance of sprinkler irrigation is greatly affected by factors such as wind speed, whose short-time variability requires tactical adjustments of the irrigation schedule. Mounting energy costs often require the consideration of interday and intraday tariff evolution. Opportunities have arisen that allow these challenges to be addressed through irrigation controllers guided by irrigation and crop simulation models. Remote control systems are often installed in <b>collective</b> pressurized <b>irrigation</b> networks. Agrometeorological information networks are available in regions worldwide. Water users’ associations use specialized databases for water management. Different configurations of irrigation controllers based on simulation models can develop, continuously update, and execute irrigation schedules aiming at maximizing irrigation adequacy and water productivity. Bottlenecks requiring action {{in the fields of}} research, development, and innovation are analyzed, with the goal of establishing agendas leading to the implementation and commercial deployment of advanced controllers for solid-set irrigation...|$|R
