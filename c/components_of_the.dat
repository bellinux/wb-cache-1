5|$|Although animals {{generally}} express fewer {{variants of}} the dicer enzyme than plants, RNAi in some animals produces an antiviral response. In both juvenile and adult Drosophila, RNA interference {{is important in}} antiviral innate immunity and is active against pathogens such as Drosophila X virus. A similar role in immunity may operate in C. elegans, as argonaute proteins are upregulated in response to viruses and worms that overexpress <b>components</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> RNAi pathway are resistant to viral infection.|$|E
5|$|As the {{dissolution}} of Austria-Hungary was taking effect in October 1918, other such units were spontaneously formed on Austrian territory, mainly from rogue <b>components</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Imperial Army. The Romanian Legion of Prague helped the Czechoslovak National Council and the Sokols gain the upper hand during an anti-Austrian uprising, while other Romanian units were breaking away from Austrian command in Vienna. Romanians also formed a distinct segment of the k.u.k. Kriegsmarine personnel who rioted on the Austrian Littoral {{and elsewhere in the}} Adriatic.|$|E
5|$|As well {{as being}} added, forces can also be {{resolved}} into independent components {{at right angles to}} each other. A horizontal force pointing northeast can therefore be split into two forces, one pointing north, and one pointing east. Summing these component forces using vector addition yields the original force. Resolving force vectors into components of a set of basis vectors is often a more mathematically clean way to describe forces than using magnitudes and directions. This is because, for orthogonal components, the <b>components</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vector sum are uniquely determined by the scalar addition of the <b>components</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> individual vectors. Orthogonal components are independent of each other because forces acting at ninety degrees to each other have no effect on the magnitude or direction of the other. Choosing a set of orthogonal basis vectors is often done by considering what set of basis vectors will make the mathematics most convenient. Choosing a basis vector that is {{in the same direction as}} one of the forces is desirable, since that force would then have only one non-zero component. Orthogonal force vectors can be three-dimensional with the third component being at right-angles to the other two.|$|E

5|$|Filters are {{required}} to operate at many different frequencies, impedances and bandwidths. The utility of a prototype filter comes from the property that all these other filters {{can be derived from}} it by applying a scaling factor to the <b>components</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prototype. The filter design need thus only be carried out once in full, with other filters being obtained by simply applying a scaling factor.|$|E
