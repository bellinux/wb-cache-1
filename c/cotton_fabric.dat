5|$|Petticoats made of {{horsehair}} crinoline appeared around 1839, proving {{so successful}} that the name 'crinoline' began to refer to supportive petticoats in general, rather than solely to the material. By 1847, crinoline fabric was {{being used as a}} stiffening for skirt linings, although English women preferred separate crinoline fabric petticoats which were beginning to collapse under the increasing weight of the skirts. One alternative to horsehair crinoline was the quilted petticoat stuffed with down or feathers, such as that reportedly worn in 1842 by Lady Aylesbury. However, quilted skirts were not widely produced until the early 1850s. In about 1849, it was possible to buy stiffened and corded <b>cotton</b> <b>fabric</b> for making petticoats, marketed as 'crinoline,' and designed as a substitute for the horsehair textile.

25|$|Scouring, is a {{chemical}} washing process {{carried out on}} <b>cotton</b> <b>fabric</b> to remove natural wax and non-fibrous impurities (e.g. the remains of seed fragments) from the fibres and any added soiling or dirt. Scouring is usually carried in iron vessels called kiers. The fabric is boiled in an alkali, which forms a soap with free fatty acids (saponification). A kier is usually enclosed, so the solution of sodium hydroxide can be boiled under pressure, excluding oxygen which would degrade the cellulose in the fibre. If the appropriate reagents are used, scouring will also remove size from the fabric although desizing often precedes scouring and {{is considered to be}} a separate process known as fabric preparation.
