5000|$|In 1962, {{after getting}} his bachelors {{in math and}} science from Vivekananda College, Dr. Datta was {{employed}} by Kuljin, an American civil engineering company in India. While working for this company, he was faced with a very competitive work environment which fostered in him the feeling that he could do something though his experiences there. [...] Working for Kuljin was also very important in his academic pursuits; in order to be accepted to the prestigious Bengal University’s College of Engineering, experience in the field was required among many other rigorous tests. [...] After a few years of working for Kuljin, Dr. Datta applied to Bengal University and was accepted.After acquiring his degree in Civil Engineering at the Bengal Engineering College of the University of Calcutta, he traveled to Detroit, Michigan, in 1967. [...] While studying for his masters degree at Wayne State University, he worked in the Wayne State mailing room to support himself. He was eventually hired as a part-time professor at Wayne State. [...] Dr. Datta was hired as a full-time faculty member in 1973 by Wayne State. While at Wayne State, Dr. Datta has worked on many research projects for MDOT, {{in addition to being a}} professor of Transportation Engineering. After his first year of employment, he received a grant to run safety training programs throughout the state. [...] Dr. Datta then created the Transportation Research Group (TRG) at Wayne State and has led numerous grant projects through this group. Some projects the TRG completed in recent years include “2005 and 2007 <b>Child</b> <b>Restraint</b> <b>Device</b> Use and Misuse Survey,” the “Susan Harwood Training Grant - OSHA Training Material Development for Highway Construction Work Zones and Traffic Control Hazards,” and a study on the “Identification of Targeted Enforcement Locations for the Reduction of Speed-Related Crashes”. Around the same time he was hired as a full-time faculty member at Wayne State, Dr. Datta also began working for Goodell Grivas Inc., a structural engineering consulting firm in Southfield, Michigan. This company was responsible for engineering the structural steel of Jacobs Field (now Progressive Field) as it was being constructed in Cleveland, OH, as well as the roof on Cobo Hall in Detroit, Michigan. In 1981, Dr. Datta became the sole owner of Goodell Grivas Inc after one of the existing owners died. Dr. Datta walked away from the company in the early 1990s to fully dedicate his time to research and teaching at Wayne State.|$|E

Approximately 7 percent of children involved in crashes in the state were killed (29 fatalities) or experienced incapacitating injuries (243). According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), motor vehicle crashes remain {{the leading cause of}} death among children aged 4 and among children ages 11 through 14 (National Center for Statistics and Analysis, 2013). In 2011, NHTSA found that 1, 140 children aged 14 and under were killed in traffic collisions. This accounted for 4 percent of 32, 367 traffic fatalities in the United States. Research has shown that the use of child restraints, including child safety seats and lap/shoulder belts, reduces the risk of fatal and serious injuries. NHTSA strongly recommends that child occupants progress through four stages of restraint usage from birth to adulthood; revised guidelines were released in 2011 for this process (Figure 1). Current Indiana child passenger restraint law requires all child occupants aged 15 and under to be properly restrained in a <b>child</b> <b>restraint</b> <b>device</b> or seat belt in all seating positions in all vehicles.

40|$|Evidence {{that death}} and injury rates for young {{children}} involved in automobile collisions could be reduced if children were restrained prompted the State of Tennessee to pass the nation's first child passenger law, a law that became effective in January 1978. Although similar laws have now been enacted throughout the United States, usually <b>restraint</b> <b>devices</b> are not provided to low-income groups who may have difficulty affording them. Few {{studies have examined the}} use of such devices by welfare recipients. A total of 56 black women, receiving Medicaid and residing in inner city Memphis, were interviewed about their use of passenger restraints during automobile travel for their children ages 0 - 3 years. About two-thirds of the mothers interviewed said they rarely or never used <b>child</b> passenger <b>restraint</b> <b>devices</b> when transporting their child.

The experimental treatment consisted of an informal discussion period with specific selected content included informally, opportunity to view a film concerning auto safety for children, pamphlets and opportunity to practice with a CRD. Dependent variables were CRD use on a single outing immediately prior to the follow-up interview, and reported general frequency of use since birth. Demographic characteristics which were found to differentiate significantly between users and nonusers of CRDs included age, marital status, income, residence type, locus of control, vehicle size, and education. ^ Subsets of the Health Beliefs about Children and Auto Accidents (HBCAA) instrument were tested for their relationships to CRD use and frequency of use.

40|$|This file {{was last}} viewed in Adobe Reader X. The {{purpose of this}} {{research}} project {{was to examine the}} performance of rear-facing child restraint devices (RFCRD) involved in side impact crashes. Side impact crashes are the second highest crash mode reported by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Child restraint devices (CRDs) are being installed in the center seating position of vehicles because it is thought to be the safest position in the vehicle due to the distance from any intrusion. Children are still being injured in side impact crashes due to the <b>child</b> <b>restraint</b> <b>device</b> moving toward the direction of impact and colliding against the intruding sheetmetal and interior components of a vehicle hit in the side. Testing done by the NHTSA in the Side Impact New Car Assessment Program (SINCAP) in 2007 placed RFCRDs in test vehicles. Subjective analysis of the SINCAP high speed video raised the question examined in this research about the excursions and potential injury of the child occupants in side impacts. The first part of this study examined the maximum head excursion of a 12 month CRABI anthropomorphic test device (ATD) placed in RFCRDs at a change in velocity of 35 km/h (22 mph). The change in velocity was determined by using the average of four popular selling small and mid-size vehicles' crash tested by the NHTSA SINCAP program. The purpose of the test series was to determine if a child occupant placed in aCRD in the center seating position would impact the door of a vehicle involved in a higher speed side impact event, such as the NHTSA SINCAP program where a moving deformable barrier traveling at 62 km/h (38. 5 mph) impacts the side of a vehicle. After determining the excursion of the ATD head, and determining if the head would hit an intruding door during a side impact event, the ATD and CRD were impacted into a simulated door to determine injury potential at 35 km/h (22 mph) change in velocity. Tests impacting the simulated door were also conducted at 29 km/h (18 mph), and 24 km/h (15 mph) to determine injury potential. In all the sled tests done at 35 km/h (22 mph) the ATD head moved into the crush zone of a sample of smaller and mid-sized vehicles. The potential for severe head injury using all the tested RFCRDs at 35 km/h (22 mph) was high when impacting a simulated door. The threshold for lower injury potential was at 24 km/h (15 mph). When the ATD did not impact anything at 35 km/h (22 mph) the potential for severe head injury was also low. This study concludes that testing of CRDs needs to be done at higher speeds to better protect children involved in higher speed side impact crashes. Head injury values and excursions both need to be evaluated for reducing injury potential...|$|E

40|$|On {{behalf of}} the Dutch Road Safety Association {{a survey of the}} use of <b>child</b> <b>restraint</b> <b>devices</b> (CRDs) in The Netherlands was conducted. In a {{population}} of 420 parents of children younger than 5 years old, 95 % possessed at least one CRD, while 83 % of the owners always, or most of the time, used a CRD when transporting a young child. It appeared that while the decision to buy a CRD was mainly determined by beliefs concerning safety and comfort provided by CRDs, the actual use of CRDs was determined primarily by the reaction of restrained children. Parents, once in possession of a CRD, seem to agree on the safety and comfort of CRDs. Not until they start using it do some parents find that their child responds irritably. For parents not using a CRD regularly, this seems to be the main reason for their behaviour. Another significant determinant, although less influential, appeared to be the perceived social influence of partners of the respondents and of road safety experts. The practical implications for health education include the recommendation to separately address parents who are already in possession of a CRD and parents who are not. Furthermore, some theoretical implications are discussed...|$|R

40|$|ISSUE: Traffic-related {{injuries}} and fatalities disproportionately affect the African American community. These {{high rates of}} traffic-related death and injury among African Americans manifest in multiple areas of traffic safety, including: Failure to use seat belts and <b>child</b> <b>restraints.</b> High incidence of alcohol-impaired driving. Failure to follow child passenger and seat belt safety laws and recommendations. High rates of pedestrian accidents, ofen brought on by impairments of drivers and/or pedestrians. Research indicates that national public information campaigns, with general messages only slightly modified for African American audiences, have not been culturally appropriate or effective in changing traffic safety behavior. In addition, traditional distribution mechanisms for these messages have not effectively reached the target population. Evidence suggests that in the African American community, there is a pervasive {{lack of knowledge of}} the devastating impact of traffic-related accidents on the overall health status of the community. This lack of information has resulted in a tragic cycle, in which parents fail to model safe operation of motor vehicles, and generation after generation copy this behavior, increasing the community's vulnerability to serious {{injuries and}} untimely deaths. This trend toward improper traffic safety habits among African Americans persists despite federal, state and local laws to enforce and promote sound traffic safety practices. OBJECTIVE: To study the existence of disparities in traffic-related injury and death among African Americans and to determine what kinds of traffic safety messages and campaigns will be effective in encouraging African Americans to respond to safety laws in sufficient numbers to reduce the disproportionately high rate of injury and death. Traffic safety issues were examined to effectively recommend policy, address barriers, best practices, and intervention strategies for the National Medical Association, its physician members, their patients, and their communities. CONSENSUS PROCESS: A literature review, driven by research instruments from numerous organizations included reports and materials from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), American Academy of Pediatrics, National Committee for Injury Prevention and Control, U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD), and the National SAFE KIDS Campaign. Both the Meharry Medical College report, Achieving a Credible Health and Safety Approach to Increasing Seat Belt Use Among African-Americans, and the U. S. Department of Transportation's Blue Ribbon Panel to Increase Seat Belt Use Among African Americans: A Report to the Nation, provided substantial background for the panel. More than 60 pieces of traffic safety literature have been examined to date. Based on the literature review, a short list of the most relevant issues affecting African Americans and traffic safety was devised. It includes: The disproportionately high rate of traffic-related injury and death among African Americans. The cost in health, monetary costs and other associated costs of traffic safety accidents and injuries. The number of traffic-related injuries and deaths that could be prevented if more African Americans observed good traffic safety practices. Barriers to practicing good traffic safety habits among African Americans. Failure of laws and public information campaigns to influence improved traffic safety practices among African Americans sufficient to reduce disparities in traffic-related injury and death. In July 2001, NMA convened a consensus panel of experts in St. Thomas, U. S. Virgin Islands, to review a briefing document summarizing the most salient traffic safety issues among African Americans. The panel elaborated on key issues, including existing policy and standards for the use of <b>child</b> <b>restraint</b> <b>devices</b> to secure infants and toddlers, existing data regarding disparities in traffic-related injury and death among African Americans, and the cultural, age and developmental appropriateness of existing safety campaigns. SUMMARY: Public information campaigns have successfully improved traffic safety practices among the general public but in large part have been unsuccessful among minority populations-including African Americans. This may be due to: A failure to use techniques and messages that are culturally sensitive to African Americans. Campaigns that have targeted geographic and social centers where African Americans are not broadly present. Lack of awareness of the disproportionate effect motor vehicle crashes are having on African Americans. Scientifically based, culturally appropriate intervention strategies need to be devised and implemented by African American institutions and organizations to improve traffic safety practices and reduce the high rate of traffic-related injury and deaths among African Americans...|$|R

Trained road safety officers assessed whether seat restraints were appropriate for the age of the passengers and whether restraints were used correctly. These assessments were based on standards published by the Child Accident Prevention Trust. PARTICIPANTS: The survey gathered data from 596 occupants in 180 cars: 327 adults and 269 children. Ten per cent of drivers who were approached refused to participate. Car occupant restraint was assessed in 180 drivers, 151 front seat passengers, and 265 rear seat passengers. MAIN RESULTS: Three hundred and sixty one occupants wore seat belts, 68 were restrained by a seat belt and booster cushion, 63 in toddler seats, 25 in two way seats, and 18 in rear facing infant carriers. Ninety seven per cent of drivers, 95 % of front seat passengers, and 77 % of rear seat passengers were restrained. However, in 98 (52 %) vehicles at least one passenger was restrained by a device that was used incorrectly. Seven per cent of adults and 28 % of children were secured incorrectly. The commonest errors were loose seat belts and <b>restraint</b> <b>devices</b> not adequately secured to the seat. Rates of incorrect use were highest in <b>child</b> seat <b>restraints,</b> reaching 60 % with two way seats and 44 % with rear facing infant seats. CONCLUSIONS: The incorrect use of car occupant restraints is an under-recognised problem, both by health professionals, and the general public. Incorrect use has been shown to reduce the effectiveness of restraints, can itself result in injury, and is likely to be an important factor in child passenger injuries. The correct use of car seat restraints merits greater attention in strategies aiming to reduce road traffic casualties. Areas of intervention that could be considered include raising public awareness of this problem, improving information and instruction given to those who purchase <b>child</b> <b>restraints,</b> and encouraging increased collaboration between manufacturers of cars and <b>child</b> <b>restraints,</b> in considering safety issues...|$|R
50|$|Directive 2003/20/EC of the European Parliament and the Council has {{mandated}} {{the use of}} child-restraint {{systems in}} vehicles effective May 5, 2006. Children less than 135 cm tall in vehicles must be restrained by an approved <b>child</b> <b>restraint</b> system suitable for the child's size. In practice, <b>child</b> <b>restraint</b> systems {{must be able to}} be fitted to the front, or other rows of seats. Children may not be transported using a rearward-facing <b>child</b> <b>restraint</b> system in a passenger seat protected by a front air bag, unless the air bag has been deactivated.|$|R

40|$|Background and Aim: About {{one-third of}} Iranian {{children}} mortality {{is caused by}} injuries from which 36 % occur due to road traffic injuries. Using <b>child</b> <b>restraint</b> embedded in vehicles can reduce road traffic fatalities by 71 % for neonates and 54 % for children. Based on its effectiveness in reduction of fatality and prevention of injury severity, <b>child</b> <b>restraint</b> usage mandatory law is a priority. Therefore, {{this study was conducted}} to assess opportunities and threats to mandatory law of <b>child</b> <b>restraint</b> usage in Iran. Materials and Methods: Initially, a mixed methods research is carried out by a phenomenological qualitative study, a discussion session by traffic injuries’ stakeholders was performed to assess & discuss the opportunities and threats to mandatory law of <b>child</b> <b>restraint</b> usage in Iran, by brain storming method to find the themes in the related topic. A structured questionnaire is later prepared and completed by the stakeholders in the area of road traffic injuries. Assigned scores of 0 - 100 were considered for each response and analysis of results was performed according to target themes & the total score of the filled questionnaires. Results: Overall, 28 stakeholders participated in the study. According to the stakeholders, traffic police department obtained the highest score of 90 (from 0 - 100) as an organization to establish the mandatory law of <b>child</b> <b>restraint</b> usage, and acquired the score of 100 for future enforcement and monitoring. As threats and obstacle to the mandatory law of <b>child</b> <b>restraint</b> usage, lack of television and media campaigns and <b>child</b> <b>restraint</b> law and legislation, obtained the highest scores of 85 & 70 respectively. And family sensitivity to their children's health, officials’ support and national facilities for broadcasting, and community awareness to use <b>child</b> <b>restraints</b> had the highest scores among existing opportunities and facilities in the country, by scores of 83, 69 and 68 respectively. Conclusion: Due to sensitivity of the family about their children’s health & safety, and officials’ support to safety establishment through media campaigns, implementation and applicability of <b>child</b> <b>restraint</b> usage laws and legislations, and subsequent enforcement and monitoring seem practical...|$|R
