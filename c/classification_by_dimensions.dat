40|$|A {{number of}} {{detection}} and defense mechanisms {{have emerged in}} the last decade to tackle the botnet phenomenon. It is important to organize this knowledge to better understand the botnet problem and its solution space. In this paper, we structure existing botnet literature into three comprehensive taxonomies of botnet behavioral features, detection and defenses. This elevated view highlights opportunities for network defense by revealing shortcomings in existing approaches. We introduce the notion of a dimension to denote different criteria which can be used to classify botnet detection techniques. We demonstrate that <b>classification</b> <b>by</b> <b>dimensions</b> is particularly useful for evaluating botnet detection mechanisms through various metrics of interest. We also show how botnet behavioral features from the first taxonomy affect the accuracy of the detection approaches in the second taxonomy. This information can be used to devise integrated detection strategies by combining complementary approaches. To provide real-world context, we liberally augment our discussions with relevant examples from security research and products...|$|E
40|$|The {{universal}} theta divisor {{over the}} moduli space Ag of principally polarized abelian varieties of dimension g, is the divisor Θg inside the universal abelian variety Xg over Ag, characterized by two properties: (i) Θg |[A,Θ] = Θ, for every principally polarized abelian variety [A, Θ] ∈ Ag, and (ii) the restriction s ∗ (Θg) along the zero section s: Ag → Xg is trivial on Ag. The {{study of the}} geometry of Θg closely mirrors that of Ag itself. Thus {{it is known that}} Θg is unirational for g ≤ 4; the case g ≤ 3 is classical, for g = 4, we refer to [Ve]. The geometry of Θ 5 will be addressed in the forthcoming paper [FV 3]. Whenever Ag is of general type (that is, in the range g ≥ 7, cf. [Fr], [Mum], [T]), one can use Viehweg’s additivity theorem [Vi] for the fibre space Θg → Ag whose generic fibre is a variety of general type, to conclude that Θg is of general type as well. The Kodaira dimension of Θ 6 (and that of A 6) is unknown. The main aim {{of this paper is to}} present a complete birational <b>classification</b> <b>by</b> Kodaira <b>dimension</b> of the universal theta divisor Th g: = Mg ×Ag Θ...|$|R
40|$|Proximity scaling (i. e., multidimensional scaling {{and related}} methods) is a {{versatile}} statistical method whose general {{idea is to}} reduce the multivariate complexity in a data set by employing suitable proximities between the data points and finding low-dimensional configurations where the fitted distances optimally approximate these proximities. The ultimate goal, however, is often not only to find the optimal configuration but to infer statements about the similarity of objects in the high-dimensional space based on the the similarity in the configuration. Since these two goals are somewhat at odds it can happen that the resulting optimal configuration makes inferring similarities rather difficult. In that case the solution lacks "clusteredness" in the configuration (which we call "c-clusteredness"). We present a version of proximity scaling, coined cluster optimized proximity scaling (COPS), which solves the conundrum by introducing a more clustered appearance into the configuration while adhering to the general idea of multidimensional scaling. In COPS, an arbitrary MDS loss function is parametrized by monotonic transformations and combined with an index that quantifies the c-clusteredness of the solution. This index, the OPTICS cordillera, has intuitively appealing properties with respect to measuring c-clusteredness. This combination of MDS loss and index is called "cluster optimized loss" (coploss) and is minimized to push any configuration towards a more clustered appearance. The effect of the method will be illustrated with various examples: Assessing similarities of countries based on the history of banking crises in the last 200 years, scaling Californian counties with respect to the projected effects of climate change and their social vulnerability, and preprocessing a data set of hand written digits for subsequent <b>classification</b> <b>by</b> nonlinear <b>dimension</b> reduction.

40|$|This paper {{proposed}} a five dimensional taxonomy ADMIT which captures five major classifiers {{to characterize the}} nature of attacks. These are <b>classification</b> <b>by</b> attack vector, <b>classification</b> <b>by</b> defense, <b>classification</b> <b>by</b> method, <b>classification</b> <b>by</b> impact and <b>classification</b> <b>by</b> attack target. The classification structure of proposed taxonomy described the nature of attacks thoroughly. The administrator can use the proposed taxonomy to locate strategies that are appropriate for securing their system against vulnerabilities that can be exploited. Use of ADMIT taxonomy in network defense strategies can improve the overall level of security...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Cyber {{attacks have}} greatly {{increased}} over the years, where the attackers have progressively improved in devising attacks towards a specific target. To aid in identifying and defending against cyber attacks we propose a cyber attack taxonomy called AVOIDIT (Attack Vector, Operational Impact, Defense, Information Impact, and Target). We use five major classifiers to characterize the nature of an attack, which are <b>classification</b> <b>by</b> attack vector, <b>classification</b> <b>by</b> attack target, <b>classification</b> <b>by</b> operational impact, <b>classification</b> <b>by</b> informational impact, and <b>classification</b> <b>by</b> defense. Our fifth category, <b>classification</b> <b>by</b> defense, is used to provide the network administrator with information of how to mitigate or remediate an attack. Contrary to the existing taxonomies, our taxonomy efficiently classifies blended attacks. Our taxonomy is applied using an application approach with pabulum to educate the defender on possible cyber attacks.
