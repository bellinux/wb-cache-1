500|$|Any type of vinyl doll can be {{used for}} reborning. [...] Dolls vary by size, shape, and materials, making some more {{desirable}} or popular than others. According to Doll Reader Magazine, Berenguer Babies, Zapf, Lee Middleton, Ashton-Drake Galleries, Apple Valley, and Secrist Dolls are doll <b>companies</b> <b>that</b> <b>make</b> dolls which are easy to transform into reborns. Kathryn Peck of Doll Reader Magazine explains that with JC Toys Berenguer Babies, it is because the dolls already resemble human babies in their expressions, body shapes, surface materials, and other lifelike attributes. Ashton Drake uses a trademark vinyl for their outer skin. Almost all the Ashton-Drake dolls are created using a theme based marketing line. [...] "Preemies" [...] are smaller dolls molded after premature infants. Between [...] "preemie" [...] and regular dolls, sizes can range from 4 inches to Child size.|$|E
500|$|Jake Adelstein, former crime {{reporter}} for the Yomiuri Shimbun, said these three acquired companies [...] "shared addresses and office space with several other companies with different names but sometimes the same employees, creating a web of real and paper <b>companies</b> <b>that</b> <b>make</b> tracking the money very difficult." [...] He also alleged that Japanese authorities {{considered one of the}} auditors involved [...] "a corporate blood brother... to the Yamaguchi-gumi." [...] Sankei Shimbun said there were perhaps 10 brokers involved in the acquisition schemes, and that while they [...] "are not members of crime syndicates themselves..... conduct economic activities together with antisocial forces... There is the possibility that Olympus has supplied cash (to organised crime) as a result." [...] However, the investigatory panel set up by Olympus rejected reports the allegations that the acquisition funds could found their way to organised crime. Panel chairman Tatsuo Kainaka said [...] "Our committee has confirmed no such facts in its investigations so far." ...|$|E

2500|$|This {{indicates}} that the capital market in Tehran is heavily concentrated on four economic sectors with <b>companies</b> <b>that</b> <b>make</b> up {{nearly half of the}} total listed companies on the exchange.

2500|$|Colt has {{to compete}} with other <b>companies</b> <b>that</b> <b>make</b> M1911-style pistols such as Kimber and AR-15 rifles such as Bushmaster. Bushmaster has {{subsequently}} overtaken Colt {{in the number of}} AR-15s sold on the civilian market. Colt suffered a legal defeat in court when it sued Bushmaster for trademark infringement claiming that [...] "M4" [...] was a trademark that it owned. The judge ruled that since the term M4 is a generic designation that Colt does not specifically own, Colt had to pay monetary reimbursement to Bushmaster to recoup Bushmaster's legal fees. The M4 designation itself comes from the U.S. military designation system, whose terms are in the public domain.|$|E
2500|$|Certain {{business}} situations, and {{the parent}} firms in those cases, are also logically analysed under an options framework; see [...] "Applications" [...] under the Real options valuation references. Just {{as a financial}} option gives its owner the right, but not the obligation, {{to buy or sell}} a security at a given price, <b>companies</b> <b>that</b> <b>make</b> strategic investments have the right, but not the obligation, to exploit opportunities in the future. Thus, for companies facing uncertainty of this type, the stock price may (should) be seen as the sum of the value of existing businesses (i.e., the discounted cash flow value) plus any real option value. Equity valuations here, may (should) thus proceed likewise. Compare PVGO.|$|E
