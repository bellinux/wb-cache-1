Prior to the Kosovo War, there was a thriving music industry in Kosovo, which reached new heights in recent years. The Kosovar music industry was home to many famous musicians, including the famous Nexhmije Pagarusha, Ismet Peja and the romantic, more elaborate Qamili i Vogël of Gjakova. The Macedonian band Vëllezërit Aliu became well- known for the traditional vocal duets accompanied by drum box, electric bass, synthesizer and clarinet or saxophone.

In June 2013, the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal was opened on the tip of the former runway. Two public housing estates opened on the northeast area of the site in 2013, providing over 13,000 new rental flats. As of August 2014, the checkerboard remains visible, though with strong natural overgrowth obscuring much of its facade.

25|$|In essence, a {{flagship}} can {{be located}} in the market where the station's owner is headquartered, or in the largest market where that owner operates. For example, WSB-TV in Atlanta is the flagship of Cox Media Group, because Cox's headquarters is located in a suburb of that city. However, Cox owns WFXT in Boston, which is larger than Atlanta. The same <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>for</b> TEGNA who lists three of its properties as its flagship stations (WXIA-TV in Atlanta, WUSA in Washington, D.C. and KUSA in Denver), but also owns WFAA in Dallas, which is larger than Atlanta, Washington D.C., and Denver in terms of Media market.

The rest are only taught the 'basics' or the external form of the art. As it stands, only a few were ever taught the real stuff and what the true masters of the art said or did was done to mislead a particular group of people into thinking that they were learning true aikijitsu.

500|$|Birdsong fascinated Messiaen from {{an early}} age, and in this he found {{encouragement}} from his teacher Dukas, who reportedly urged his pupils to [...] "listen to the birds". Messiaen included stylised birdsong {{in some of his}} early compositions (including L'abîme d'oiseaux from the Quatuor pour la fin du temps), integrating it into his sound-world by techniques like the modes of limited transposition and chord colouration. His evocations of birdsong became increasingly sophisticated, and with Le réveil des oiseaux this process reached maturity, the whole piece being built from birdsong: in effect it is a dawn chorus for orchestra. The same <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>for</b> [...] "Epode", the five-minute sixth movement of Chronochromie, which is scored for eighteen violins, each one playing a different birdsong. Messiaen notated the bird species with the music in the score (examples 1 and 4). The pieces are not simple transcriptions; even the works with purely bird-inspired titles, such as Catalogue d'oiseaux and Fauvette des jardins, are tone poems evoking the landscape, its colours and atmosphere.|$|E
500|$|The famous Glen Rose {{trackway}} {{on display}} in New York City includes theropod footprints belonging to several individuals which moved {{in the same direction}} as up to twelve sauropod dinosaurs. The theropod prints are sometimes found on top of the sauropod footprints, indicating that they were formed later. This has been put forth as evidence that a small pack of Acrocanthosaurus was stalking a herd of sauropods. While interesting and plausible, this hypothesis is difficult to prove and other explanations exist. For example, several solitary theropods may have moved through in the same direction at different times after the sauropods had passed, creating the appearance of a pack stalking its prey. The same <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>for</b> the purported [...] "herd" [...] of sauropods, who also may or may not have been moving as a group. At a point where it crosses the path of one of the sauropods, one of the theropod trackways is missing a footprint, which has been cited as evidence of an attack. However, other scientists doubt the validity of this interpretation because the sauropod did not change gait, as would be expected if a large predator were hanging onto its side.|$|E

He {{challenged}} himself to remix {{the rest of}} the record, taking more than a year, as a project called The REcstatic, working with Jan Fairchild, the original album's mixing engineer. Preservation revisited sources for the original beats to find similar recordings that would correspond to each song's particular aesthetic while preserving Mos Def's vocals for the remixes. He wanted them to be sample-based and consistent in key, pitch, and tone to the first album, which he found difficult to achieve because of the original music's unorthodox instrumentals and singing. [...] "It's the result of countless hours of digging through records to sample", he recalled. [...] "Constructing the beat, wrapping it around the vocal, adjusting the tempo, and so on". The REcstatic was released as a free download on June 12, 2013, by Preservation's imprint label, Mon Dieu Music. Reviewing the remix album in Tiny Mix Tapes, Samuel Diamond said the rapturous energy of the original record was given a [...] "slightly rougher texture" [...] on what he deemed [...] "a respectful contribution to the canon of remix-based art, something that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>for</b> very few modern rap 'remixes'".|$|E

In 2002, Justin Hoeger of The Sacramento Bee opined that [...] "unlike most other female video game characters, Samus isn't some husky-voiced bimbo in tight leather included only for sex appeal.
