40|$|Abstract. Robust Security Network (RSN) epitomised by IEEE 802. 11 i {{substandard}} {{is promising}} what it stands for; robust and effective protection for mission critical Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN). However, {{despite the fact}} that 802. 11 i overhauls the IEEE's 802. 11 security standard several weaknesses still remain. In this context, the <b>complementary</b> <b>assistance</b> of Wireless Intrusion Detection Systems (WIDS) to deal with existing and new threats is greatly appreciated. In this paper we focus on 802. 11 i intrusion detection, discuss what is missing, what the possibilities are, and experimentally explore ways to make them intertwine and co-work. Our experiments employing well known open source attack tools and custom made software reveal that most 802. 11 i specific attacks can be effectively recognised, either directly or indirectly. We also consider and discuss Distributed Wireless Intrusion Detection (DIDS), which seems to fit best in RSN networks...|$|E

40|$|Background: Community {{health care}} is the arena in which most care-dependent older people receive {{professional}} nursing assistance. The main objective of home nursing care {{is to improve the}} patient’s quality of life and/or to maintain his/her independence. Aims: To describe the characteristics of people receiving home nursing care (HNC), and how the recipients define their health. To examine the mechanisms underlying the loss of independent living and the allocation of home nursing care, and whether home nurses give priority to the overall goals of HNC. Respondents/methods: 242 respondents were aged 75 years or older, receiving HNC. A survey with baseline- and follow-up data (a 2 -year period) was undertaken. Results: The oldest patients were the healthiest. Subjectively perceived health was more important in the perception of health than objective health measures. Strong perception of social support and a high self-rating of health predicted a longer period of independent living. Functional and cognitive decline and being male were the most important predictors of loss of independent living. Compensatory or <b>complementary</b> <b>assistance</b> from informal networks did not influence the period of independent living. Coping resources, measured as Sense of Coherence (SOC), did not prolong independent living. The allocation of home nursing care was mainly influenced by impaired functional health, and not influenced by subjective health measures. Conclusion: Older persons with a poor perception of subjective social and health conditions are vulnerable since these are not intercepted as a reason for care assistance. Implications: Nurses should emphasize the identification and treatment of subjective health problems. The salutogenic approach should be given stronger attention as a principle for nursing practice. More research should be done with regard to how the dimensions of sense of coherence influence health promotion. This includes both the individual patient, and how services are organized. </p...|$|E
40|$|The rapidly {{increasing}} demand of oil-based chemicals {{calls for the}} development of new technologies based on other natural sources. Among these emerging alternatives, the methanol-to-olefin process (MTO) in acidic zeolites {{is one of the most}} promising. However, unraveling the reaction mechanism of such an extremely complex catalytic process like MTO conversion has been a challenging task from both experimental and theoretical viewpoint. For over 30 years the actual mechanism has been one of the most discussed topics in heterogeneous catalysis. [1] Instead of plainly following direct routes,[2 - 3] the MTO process has experimentally been found to proceed through a hydrocarbon pool mechanism, in which organic reaction centers act as cocatalysts inside the zeolite pores, adding a whole new level of complexity to this issue. [4 - 5] Therefore, a more detailed understanding of the elementary reaction steps can be obtained with the <b>complementary</b> <b>assistance</b> of theoretical modeling. In this work, a complete supramolecular complex of both the zeolite framework and the co-catalytic hydrocarbon pool species is modeled through state-of-the-art quantum chemical techniques [6 - 7]. This approach provides a more detailed understanding of the crucial interactions between the zeolite framework and its contents, which form the driving forces for successful methanol-to-olefin conversion.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: {{to assess}} the {{efficiency}} of the Calatonia technique about clinical parameters and pain in the immediate post-surgical phase. METHOD: a randomised study was carried out with 116 patients subjected to a cholecystectomy, by laparoscopy, divided into an experimental group (58 patients) and a placebo group (58 patients). The experimental group received the Calatonia technique, while the placebo was only subjected to non-intentional touches. RESULTS: The placebo group and the experimental group were considered homogeneous in terms of the variables: sex, age, physical status classification, duration of surgical procedures and also the time spent recovering in the Post-Anaesthetic Recovery Room. The only variable to show a statistically significant difference was the axillary temperature of the body. In relation to pain, the experimental group showed significant results, and hence it is possible to deduce that the relaxation caused by the Calatonia technique brought some relief of the general situation of pain. CONCLUSION: The application of Calatonia can take up the function of a resource <b>complementary</b> to <b>assistance</b> in the period immediately after surgery.

40|$|The {{weaknesses}} of traditional policies {{for dealing with}} unemployment shocks have placed the reform of social insurance programs {{at the center of}} the public policy debate. Unemployment insurance saving accounts (UISAs) have been proposed as an instrument to protect workers from the loss in earnings associated with unemployment. The idea is to have all workers (and possibly their employers as well) deposit a share of their monthly incomes into their UISA, with the balance in the account accruing market interest rates. During an unemployment spell, the workers who would be eligible to do so could withdraw funds from their individual account. It is only when there would be no or few funds left in the account that <b>complementary</b> unemployment <b>assistance</b> allowances would be provided. The fact that the accounts are individualized helps to solve the moral hazard problem. Moreover, the fact that the contribution system is mandatory also helps to solve another problem, namely the adverse selection mechanisms through which only some workers might choose to self-insure, or through which the private insurance firms insuring workers would try to hand-pick those workers with the lowest risk of being unemployed. Overall, the objective of UISAs is to set incentives right. Recent proposals for replacing standard forms of unemployment assistance by UISAs are being implemented in several Latin American countries. This paper explores some of the implications of replacing in Chile the current job security system with UISAs. ...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} 10 years the three Baltic republics have {{undertaken}} significant restructuring of their banking sectors, {{supported by the}} World Bank through three projects: the Financial Institutions Development Project in Estonia, the Enterprise and Financial Sector Restructuring Project in Latvia, and the Enterprise and Financial Sector Project in Lithuania. These projects included a credit line, channeled through local commercial banks, to provide long-term funding and <b>complementary</b> technical <b>assistance</b> to private enterprises. In parallel, the government of Sweden injected equity into the commercial banks from Swedfund Financial Markets (SFM). The projects and the accompanying Swedfund equity were aimed at promoting sound banking systems in the three Baltic countries-by strengthening the equity in the banks and thereby expanding medium- and long-term financing. Meigas examines the role of SFM-which provides development-oriented equity investment (DEI) to Baltic banks-in {{the context of the}} World Bank programs. She examines the arguments for deploying DEI as a development vehicle by gauging its impact in the three Baltic countries on banking skills and services, on capitalization, and on shareholder structure and board membership. She draws out the role of technical assistance and compares its impact with that of DEI, and explores the possibilities offered by DEI for imposing sound corporate governance. The author also describes the necessary ingredients for successful DEI. The author's analysis shows that the Baltic projects were valuable initiatives that could in principle be replicated in other transition or developing economies whose banking sector faces serious restructuring challenges. A development-oriented equity investment, like that made by SFM, can address the important deficiencies in a banking sector that is still in a rudimentary state, lacking both capital and banking skills. SFM's most effective tool was the imposition of sound corporate governance on the institutions that received the equity injection. This approach provided a powerful supplement to the banking supervisory functions. Rather than relying on the external enforcement power of state supervision, SFM targeted internal processes to change business practices. As a result, the DEI led to improvements in the corporate culture and broader risk management and thus in the quality of banking services-not only meeting the institutional development objectives but also ensuring an adequate return on the invested capital. The potential of good corporate governance for easing the work of banking supervisors has been stressed by the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision. Thispotential is particularly valuable in countries still developing the supervisory function, and DEI, the author argues, is well suited for the task of improving corporate governance.

40|$|Officially {{the war in}} the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has ended, {{but human}} rights reports leave no doubt that the {{conflict}} is still going on, particularly in the Eastern provinces. The widespread and systematic use of rape as a weapon of war has put the issue of sexual violence {{at the heart of the}} public debate. Rape victims are faced with severe physical and psychological trauma, high risks of unwanted pregnancies, infections with sexually transmitted diseases including HIV/AIDS, and rejection by their family and the community. Based on broader empirical research focusing on the sexual and reproductive health (SRH) rights and needs of war-affected children, this article suggests the adoption of a rights-based approach in the aid to rape victims. Such an approach should not only pay attention to the provision of direct aid to the victims and to protecting them from being repeatedly victimised, but also to the prevention of the further spread of sexual violence. Direct aid to the victims requires the development of comprehensive programmes that should include five interrelated and <b>complementary</b> components: medical <b>assistance,</b> psychosocial support, economic aid, legal aid, and protection. Prevention should focus on the fight against impunity and the elimination of socio-cultural barriers that enhance the ‘acceptability’ of sexual violence perpetrated by non-combatants. In the reconstruction of the country the fight against impunity will be paramount to counteract the ‘ethical vacuum’ that has been created, whereby other forms of sexual violence, such as adult men making use of the services of children who try to survive as sex workers, are not only tolerated but even accepted. Given the complete state of impoverishment in the DRC to which the author calls attention, the support of international donors will be indispensable. The creation of effective coordinating mechanisms will be essential and the strengthening of the national and local capacities to respond properly to the needs of the rape victims will be paramount in order to guarantee sustainability of the programmes...|$|R
