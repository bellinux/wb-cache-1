Debt consolidation typically involves borrowing from one lender (typically a bank), {{at a low rate}} of interest, sufficient funds to repay a number of higher interest rate debts (such as credit cards). By <b>consolidating</b> <b>debts,</b> the debtor replaces many payments to many different creditors with one monthly payment to one creditor, thereby simplifying their monthly budget. In addition, the lower interest rate means that more of the debtor's monthly payment is applied against the principal of the loan, resulting in faster debt repayment.

40|$|Little {{is known}} on which credit {{instruments}} early modern entrepreneurs used to fund and manage their enterprises. By using {{the city of}} Enkhuizen as a case study, this thesis demonstrates that seventeenth-century entrepreneurs used a range of different techniques for this end. Generally, it shows the all-important use of credit in early modern trade. Privately contracted loans and supplier credit {{formed the basis of}} early modern funding, especially for small-scale entrepreneurs. The inherent need for credit caused by early modern trade caused entrepreneurs to resort to the local credit market. On this market also creditors had a lot of different investments options. As a result entrepreneurs had to compete with all other types of securities offered on this market. In Enkhuizen, especially securities of Holland and bonds issued by the local chamber of the VOC at times dominated the financial market. Moreover, this thesis demonstrates that even a large company such as the VOC needed to resort to different credit instruments to solve its liquidity needs. Although the local chamber of the VOC was at first anxious to resort to the local credit market, it started to borrow heavily from 1615, and gradually a <b>consolidated</b> <b>debt</b> arose...|$|E
40|$|Founded in 1932, {{the twelve}} Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs) have {{historically}} provided long-term funding to specialized mortgage lenders. But legislative {{changes in the}} wake of the 1980 s’ thrift crises spurred the FHLBs to expand in both size and scope. For example, FHLB balance sheets now also include a substantial investment in mortgages and mortgage-backed securities, and the attendant interest rate risk has created financial and accounting difficulties at some of the FHLBs.; Like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the FHLB System is a government-sponsored enterprise that funds itself largely with federal agency debt obligations that investors perceive to be implicitly guaranteed by the U. S. government. This article identifies some differences in risk-taking incentives between the cooperatively owned FHLB System and investor-owned Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.; Cooperative ownership itself does not reduce FHLB risk-taking incentives because, unlike many mutuals, the FHLB System does not bundle its equity and debt claims. Also, the joint-and-several liability provision in the FHLBs’ <b>consolidated</b> <b>debt</b> obligations and a lack of equity market discipline may heighten FHLB risk-taking incentives. However, the FHLBs cannot avail themselves of equity-based managerial compensation, which create high-powered risk-taking incentives in investor-owned firms. Thus, it is unclear whether the FHLBs’ risk-taking incentives are necessarily weaker than Fannie Mae’s and Freddie Mac’s. Federal home loan banks...|$|E

40|$|This study aims {{assessing}} {{the impact of}} the introduction of the "Lei de Responsabilidade Fiscal" (Fiscal Responsibility Law) on the municipal public finance. The Law established limits of indebtedness and expenses by the relations "expenses with public servants payroll over the net current revenue" and "net <b>consolidated</b> <b>debt</b> over the net current revenue" which must not surpass the 0, 6 and 1, 2 limits respectively. For this analysis, we build two scenarios ("before" and "after" the Law), on the basis of which we compared the municipalities` performance concerning their expenditures and debt policies. In a first analysis, we observed that the limits imposed to the municipalities were very higher than their average results suggesting "miscalibration" in the setting of those limits since the aim was to prevent the public servants payroll expenses raise without criterion. The results show {{that in the case of}} the public servant payroll ratio over the net current revenues, the imposition of a 60 % limit worked as an incentive to increase that item of expenditure to most municipalities, which had results much lower than the established ceiling. Nevertheless, the minority that surpassed the ceiling had their expenses adjusted. As for the indebtedness index, the Law brought about a controlling effect to a small number of municipalities that overreached the limit imposed. However, we observed that the municipalities that were unable to fit themselves to the limit increased their participation in the aggregate debt of all the municipalities. Therefore, two effects were detected: a debt control of some municipalities and a concentration of indebtedness in others where the debt was not controlled. ...|$|E
40|$|The study {{analyses}} {{the relationship}} between public debt, external and internal disequilibrium and inflation in Hungary through changes {{in the public sector}} borrowing requirement and in the structure of budget financing. The analysis is based on data from the 1986 - 1997 period in order to put the changes in true perspective. Policy constraints stemming from high indebtedness and their macroeconomic consequences are analysed by comparing different measures of fiscal deficit, as well as by quantifying the factors determining the evolution of the public debt/GDP ratio. We focus on the operational deficit (which is derived from the nominal deficit by eliminating the inflation compensation component of interest payments) and on its financing. The study presents a detailed empirical analysis of the evolution of the financing structure (seigniorage - debt) {{as well as of the}} role and structural changes of debt financing. The calculations are based on net consolidated public debt, which includes the combined debt of the budget and the central bank to other sectors net of claims. The consolidation of budget and central bank balances is unavoidable in order to get reliable indicators of the fiscal stance since in Hungary the central bank has been responsible for borrowing abroad in its own name. We introduced the category of ?extended??consolidated public debt (including the stock of central bank’s sterilisation instruments) which enabled us to analyse the past eleven years in a consistent framework, and to reveal the trends as well as the dynamic relationships of the debt accumulation process. The analysis shows that the shift to a new regime of deficit financing based on issuing marketable government securities (in 1992) did not increase the fiscal burden, it merely revealed its true magnitude by separating monetary and fiscal functions and by increasing transparency. The analysis of <b>consolidated</b> <b>debt</b> revealed that throughout the last ten years the implicit real interest rates on public debt exceeded the growth rate of the economy, which led to the continuous increase of the debt ratio (the gross debt/GDP around 90 % in the middle of nineties). This effect was mitigated only from 1995 by the fiscal adjustment resulting a primary surplus in the budget. The seigniorage did not play an important role in financing after 1992, it amounted to 1 - 2 % of GDP. However, the major element in the significant (over 15 percentage points) reduction in the debt-to- GDP ratio over the last three years was the devotion of privatisation revenues to retire public debt. Analysing past developments, we came to the conclusion that despite the significant reduction in the debt-to-GDP ratio in the last few years, the debt burden is still significant and a further reduction of the debt to GDP ratio is inevitable in order to create the conditions for sustainable growth and to ensure the continuous convergence to developed countries. This requires a structural primary surplus of 1. 5 - 2 % of GDP in the medium run, if we take into account the requirement of sustainability, the goal of further reductions in the inflation rate and the fact that with the end of the privatisation process privatisation revenues will not provide additional sources for financing. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{object of}} this thesis is {{to study the}} {{underlying}} trends in railway finance in Portugal between 1850 and 1890. During these 40 years {{the building of the}} trunk lines was completed, with over 2, 000 kilometres in operation at the beginning of 1890. Schemes for railways in Portugal were put forward in the mid- 1840 s but the unstable political situation, which culminated in a Civil War in 1847, delayed the commencement of railway services until 1856. Because of Portugal's continuing critical financial situation and the consequent meager resources of the Portuguese Treasury railway construction was largely financed by foreign capital. Allowing for the imperfection of the data it would appear that at least a third of total investment in Portuguese railways would have been financed by foreign investors. Both British and French railway promoters and speculators dominated the scene and set the pace for railway development throughout the period covered in this study. The initial railway schemes were experimental and then developed erratically, with an absence of a consistent and sustained railway policy {{on the part of the}} Government. Locomotives and materials, as well as the capital required for the construction of the lines, were first imported from England, but from the early 1860 s France became a major supplier of capital, relegating Britain to a position of a supplier of coal and rolling stock. This contrast between British and French investments, however, may in some ways be misleading. Overall, in both Iberian countries it seems reasonable to argue that the success of French railway schemes was partly due to the support, direct or indirect as the case may be, of English financial houses. Although Rondo Cameron's extensive study placed France as the supplier of capital for railway building in Spain, with further research serious doubts have emerged as to the nature and financial connections of the capital invested there by the Credit Mobilier and other French investment banks. For Portugal, however, the present study suggests that the distinction between British and French investments hardly stands. It seems difficult to differentiate the nature of foreign capital invested in the Portuguese railways and it appears more reasonable to conclude that foreign investments were the product of an Anglo-French financial alliance formed by investment banks which envisaged the control of railway services in both Portugal and Spain. The nature of Portuguese railway finance is also linked with the successive failures of the Portuguese Government to establish an adequate railway policy with the result that the cost of the lines built by foreign private operators, but with a government subsidy, was substantially higher than the cost of state-lines. This study will demonstrate that a least 4. 1 million could have been saved throughout the 40 years between 1850 and 1890, if the state had embarked on a program of direct railway construction. In annual terms the amount mentioned above represented over 20 per cent of the budget deficit and around 3. 5 per cent of the service of the <b>consolidated</b> <b>debt</b> between 1877 - 78 and 1889 - 90. Further, this study will show that the high cost of construction was also the result of high interest rates, over seven per cent, paid on state bonds. This, in turn, explains the lack of private railway entrepreneurship and investors' preference for an indirect investment which produced higher returns than those offered by the equity capital of the private companies. The nature of Portuguese railway finance is ultimately connected with the dependent peripheral condition of 19 th century Portugal which, like in all European peripheral countries, made the railway a leading sector to animate the economy and propelled industrialisation forward. The outcome of this relationship, however, varied widely in the peripheral areas of Europe and no general pattern can be established with respect to either the finance or the impact of the railways in various peripheral economy countries. In Portugal, the conditions surrounding the building of the network resulted in a speculative, inefficient, uneconomic, costly and foreign-orientated railway system...|$|E

40|$|Control on {{regional}} government budgets {{is important in}} a monetary union as lower tiers of government have fewer incentives to <b>consolidate</b> <b>debt.</b> According to the Fiscal Theory of the Price Level; unsustainable non-Ricardian fiscal policies eventually force monetary policy to adjust. Hence, uncoordinated and non-regulated regional fiscal policies would therefore threaten price stability for the monetary union as a whole. However, the union central bank is not without defense. A federal government that internalises the spillover effect of non-Ricardian fiscal policies on the price level can offset non-Ricardian regional fiscal policies. A federal government, which taxes and transfers resources between regions, may compensate for unsustainable regional fiscal policies so as to keep fiscal policy Ricardian on aggregate. Following Canzoneri et al. (2001), we test {{the validity of the}} Fiscal Theory of the Price Level for both federal and regional governments in Germany. We find evidence of a spillover effect of unsustainable policies on the price level for other Länder. However, the German federal government offsets this effect on the price level by running Ricardian policies. These results have implications for the regulation of fiscal policies in the EMU.
