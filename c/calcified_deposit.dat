40|$|Induratio penis plastica (IPP) is a {{degenerative}} disease, {{which consists}} in a thickening of the albuginea tunica of cavernous corpora, {{especially on the}} dorsal aspect. In 25 % of the cases a <b>calcified</b> <b>deposit</b> is present. This disease can determine a bending of the penis, usually upward, pain during erection and impotentia coeundi. It is associated with Dupuytren's disease in 25 % of the cases. IPP is of unknown etiological origin. The more reliable etiological theories are the degenerative one (micro trauma and inflammation) and the autoimmune one. The assessment of IPP is based on story, physical examination, autophotography (which are necessary) and on imaging techniques such as ultrasound, color Doppler, CT, MRI and X-ray in mammography. Color Doppler has demonstrated {{to be the best}} technique because of its cost/benefit and cost/effectiveness ratio. RMI with gadolinium can determine plaques activity but it has a lower cost/benefit ratio. Color Doppler can determine the presence of an IPP plaque and its status, which is size, location, and degree of calcification. Some authors sustain that inflammation can be suggested by the presence of micro vascularization around the plaque. US can be very useful to detect plaque in a size not easily accessible by physical examination (on the dorsal aspect of the penis) and to demonstrate plaques in different evolution moment. Ultrasonography is the better technique to show directly albuginea tunica.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the osteogenesis characteristics of cultured rat mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) under bone induction condition. Methods: MSCs were isolated from adult rat by using density gradient separation method. The osteogenic inducers were compounds of Dexone, β-glycerophosphate sodium and vitamin C. Results: The MSC attachment formed {{soon after the}} seeding and grew into colonies {{with the appearance of}} fibroblastic cells. The osteogenic inducer with low dose of Dexone could promote the osteogenic differentiation of MSC. In the group of osteogenic inducer with low dose of Dexone, the expression of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was remarkably increased after one week’s induction, and the number of positive cells was (15. 1 ± 2. 6), significantly higher than that of the control group (12. 0 ± 3. 5) (P< 0. 01). The <b>calcified</b> <b>deposits</b> began to appear in the group of osteogenic inducer with low dose of Dexone after one week's induction and was increased remarkably after three weeks, and the number of <b>calcified</b> <b>deposits</b> was (9. 0 ± 1. 7), significantly higher than that of the control group (2. 0 ± 1. 8) (P< 0. 01).

40|$|AbstractFamilial tumoral {{calcinosis}} {{refers to}} a group of disorders inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. Hyperphosphatemic tumoral calcinosis is characterized by increased re-absorption of phosphate through the renal proximal tubule, resulting in elevated phosphate concentration and deposition of <b>calcified</b> <b>deposits</b> in cutaneous and subcutaneous tissues, as well as, occasionally, in visceral organs. The disease was found to result from mutations in at least 3 genes: GALNT 3, encoding a glycosyltransferase termed ppGalNacT 3, FGF 23 encoding a potent phosphaturic protein, and KL encoding Klotho. Recent data showed that ppGalNacT 3 mediates O-glycosylation of FGF 23, thereby allowing for its secretion and possibly protecting it from proteolysis-mediated inactivation. Klotho was found to serve as a co-receptor for FGF 23, thereby integrating the genetic data into a single physiological system. The elucidation of the molecular basis of HFTC shed new light upon the mechanisms regulating phosphate homeostasis, suggesting innovative therapeutic strategies for the management of hyperphosphatemia in common acquired conditions such as chronic renal failure...|$|R
40|$|Vascular {{calcification}} {{is associated}} with an increased risk of myocardial infarction; however, the mechanisms linking these 2 processes are unknown. Studies in macrophages have suggested that calcium phosphate crystals induce the release of proinflammatory cytokines; however, no studies have been performed on the effects of calcium phosphate crystals on vascular smooth muscle cell function. In the present study, we found that calcium phosphate crystals induced cell death in human aortic vascular smooth muscle cells with their potency depending on their size and composition. Calcium phosphate crystals of approximately 1 microm or less in diameter caused rapid rises in intracellular calcium concentration, an effect that was inhibited by the lysosomal proton pump inhibitor, bafilomycin A 1. Bafilomycin A 1 also blocked vascular smooth muscle cell death suggesting that crystal dissolution in lysosomes leads to an increase in intracellular calcium levels and subsequent cell death. These studies give novel insights into the bioactivity of <b>calcified</b> <b>deposits</b> and suggest that small calcium phosphate crystals could destabilize atherosclerotic plaques by initiating inflammation and by causing vascular smooth muscle cell death...|$|R

METHODS AND RESULTS: Aortic calcification was diagnosed by radiographic detection of <b>calcified</b> <b>deposits</b> in the abdominal aorta. In all cohort members for whom DNA was available, the C 1173 T SNP of VKORC 1 (rs 9934438) was determined. With multivariable logistic regression analysis the association between this polymorphism and the risk of aortic calcification was calculated, adjusted for potential confounders. The T allele frequency of the VKORC 1 1173 C>T polymorphism was 38. 8 %. 1185 (37. 2 %) persons were homozygous CC, 1529 (48, 0 %) were heterozygous CT and 473 (14. 8 %) were homozygous TT.

The dose was doubled after 2 weeks until an increase of 2 g/dl of haemoglobin was observed. The effects on various parameters were studied during a 3 -month period. Haemoglobin increased from 6. 70 ± 0. 74 to 10. 49 ± 1. 04 g/dl (mean + SD, P< 0. 001), potassium from 5. 51 ± 0. 50 to 6. 06 + 0. 65 mmol/ 1 (P< 0. 005), phos-phate from 1. 78 ± 0. 40 to 2. 17 ± 0. 40 mmol/l (P< 0. 001) and the calcium phosphorus product from 4. 3 to 5. 2 (P< 0. 001). Three patients developed marked periarticu-lar inflammation due to <b>calcified</b> <b>deposits</b> with a high calcium-phosphorus product of 6. 8. An increase in arterial blood pressure was observed in three previously well-controlled hypertensive patients, one of whom developed hypertensive encephalopathy.

In the histological study of the rotator cuffs, various degenerative changes, such as separation and irregular arrangement of the collagen bundles and hyalinization at the attachment of the rotator cuff tendon to the bone were found. Calcification at the tendon insertion was also detected at the blue line area, which was stained with hematoxylin, while the musculo-tendinous juntion was intact. Scanning electron micrographs showed that <b>calcified</b> <b>deposits</b> in the CTS lesions were made up of granular crystals (0. 1 - 0. 2 μ in diameter) accumulating into round particles (3 - 10 μ in diameter). Infra-red spectrography demonstrated that the deposits were similar to commercially available hydroxyapatite.
