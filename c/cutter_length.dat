40|$|Five axis CNC {{machining}} {{centers are}} widely used in the industries for producing the complex parts. Due to two more axes {{as compared to the}} three axes machining, it provides the efficient and flexible way of the machining. Besides this flexibility, accidental collision possibilities between the cutting system and the other moving parts of the machine tools are also increased. These collisions could be avoided by changing the orientations of the tool during the tool path planning or by adjusting the <b>cutter</b> <b>length</b> and the tool holder size after the tool path generation in the part coordinate system. Collision detection and removal by the optimum <b>cutter</b> <b>length</b> depends on the configuration of five axis machine tools. No. of possible candidates for the collision may vary with the configuration of the machine tools. Since the fully utilization of the existing machining facilities in the industry is also in high demand, therefore, after selecting the one of the critical parameter of the <b>cutter</b> <b>length,</b> the maximum utilization of the work space of the 5 -axis machine tools is another critical task. This dissertation comprises of two main works. 	In the first research work, a comprehensive approach for the determination of the optimum <b>cutter</b> <b>length</b> for the specific configuration of five axis machine tool is developed. The complete cutting system (the tool, the tool holder and the spindle), the work in process model and the fixture are the three possible candidates for the collision. The work in process model and the fixture are represented as the point cloud data and the tool holder and the spindle are represented as a regular shape of the truncated cone and the cylinder respectively. Collision checking is conducted in two steps. In the first step the KD-tree data structure is employed on the point cloud data and a method is developed which confines the searching of the point cloud data in the local region and in the second step a new mathematical model for the collision detection between the points in the local region and the cutting system is established. This model also has the capability of removal collision with the optimum <b>cutter</b> <b>length.</b> 	In the second research work, kinematics of the table rotating and spindle tilting 5 -axis machine is developed and setup parameters for mounting the part on the table are defined. A precise method for the determination of the setup parameters, which gives the opportunity of fully utilization of the work space of the machine tool, is developed. Many machining simulation software such as vericut can simulate the G-codes for the given setup parameters of the part and can verify the over travel limits of the machine tool as well as accidental collision between the moving parts of the machine. In this research, the developed method for the determination of the setup parameters gives the guarantee of complete machining of the part without over travel limits of the machine translational axes. This research is based on the predetermined machining strategies, which means, tool path is already given in the part coordinate system. ...|$|E
40|$|Miniaturized {{devices are}} the key {{producing}} next-generation microelectro-mechanical products. The applications extend to many fields that demand high-level tolerances from microproducts and component functional and structural integrity. Silicon-based products are limited because silicon is brittle. Products {{can be made from}} other engineering materials and need to be machined in microscale. This research deals with predicting microtool failure by studying spindle runout and tool deflection effects on the tool, and by measuring the cutting force that would fail the tool during microend-milling. End-milling was performed using a tungsten carbide (? 1. 016 mm dia., 2 flute) tool on SS- 316 L material. Tool runout measured using a laser was found to be less than 1 ?m and tool deflection at 25000 rpm was 20 ?m. Finite element analysis (FEA) predicts tool failure due to static bending for a deflection greater than 99 % of tool diameter. Threshold values of chipload and cutting force resulting in tool failure were found using workdone by tool. Threshold values to predict tool failure were suggested for axial depth of cut in between 17. 25 % - 34. 5 % of <b>cutter</b> <b>length.</b> For a chipload greater than 20 % of cutter diameter, the microtool fails instantly for any radial depth of cut...|$|E

40|$|In {{milling around}} corners, cutting {{resistance}} rises momentarily {{due to an}} increase of <b>cutter</b> contact <b>length.</b> NC tool path generation in dealing with sharp corners thus requires special consideration. This paper describes an improved NC tool path pattern for pocket milling. The basic pattern of the improved tool path is a conventional contour-parallel tool path. Bow-like tool path segments are appended to the basic tool path at the corner positions. When reaching a corner, the cutter loops around the appended tool path segments so that corner material is removed progressively in several passes. By using the corner-looping based tool path, <b>cutter</b> contact <b>length</b> can be controlled by adjusting the number of appended tool path loops. The procedures of creating the improved tool path for different corner shapes are explained. The proposed tool path generation was implemented as an add-on user function in a CAD/CAM system.

40|$|This study {{describes}} {{the use of}} ultrasonic-assisted end milling {{to improve the quality}} of the machined surface of hard Stavax (modified AISI 420) mold steel and to reduce the amount of work involved in the final polishing process. The effects of input voltage, the stretch <b>length</b> and <b>cutter</b> holding force on the amplitude of the ultrasonic vibration used were measured. The effect of ultrasonic frequency (25 and 50 kHz) and amplitude (0, 2. 20 and 3. 68 μm) as well as the effect of the rake angle (6 ° and − 6 °) and the cutter helix angle (25 °, 35 ° and 45 °) on tool wear and quality of the workpiece surface finish were also investigated. It was found that the ultrasonic amplitude increased with <b>cutter</b> stretch <b>length</b> and input voltage, as expected. The amplitude remained constant when the cutter holding force exceeded 15 N. The experimental results showed that the ultrasonic amplitude had an optimum value with respect to surface finish. However, large amplitude ultrasonics did not necessarily improve quality. Furthermore, the cutters used for ultrasonic-assisted milling show less wear than those used for normal milling. It was also found that a positive rake angle and cutters with a large helix angle gave a better surface finish...|$|R

40|$|Machining of the {{complicated}} parts of high accuracy {{in large quantities}} has been an increasing demand since sophisticated technological equipment and machinery rapidly developed. These complicated components can be machined by employing NC machine tools. TIle motion commands for NC machine tool {{are determined by the}} path of the cutter. Obtaining optimal <b>cutter</b> path <b>length</b> is vital important in reducing the machining time. Nevertheless, another factor which has also influenced over machining time is the sequence of the machining operation. Hence, this project has presented the development of the process planning for machining diaphragm valve with Y - valve body (prismatic parts) with regard an optimum machining time. An effective process planning was developed with considering two major influences over machining time which are cutter path and machining operation sequence. Tool paths planning and simulation have been done by Unigraphics CAD/CAM Software. The machining operation is assumed to be carried out by 3 -axis CNC vertical milling machine and has five setups for machining completion. The process planning developed comprises of six phases. They are fcature recognition, machining operation selection, machine selection, cutting tool sclection, cutting parameters selection and finally sequencing of the machining operation. The study results revealed that the total shortest machining time was 99. 81 minutcs resulted from an optimum tool path and machining sequencc.

40|$|Mechanistic {{models of}} the milling process must {{calculate}} the chip geometry and the <b>cutter</b> edge contact <b>length</b> in order to predict milling forces accurately. This task becomes increasingly difficult for the machining of three dimensional parts using complex tool geometry, such as bull nose cutters. In this paper, a mechanistic model of the milling process based on an adaptive and local depth buffer of the computer graphics card is compared to a traditional simulation method. Results are compared using a 3 -axis wedge shaped cut – a tool path with a known chip geometry {{in order to accommodate}} the traditional method. Effects of cutter nose radius on the cutting and edge forces are considered. It is verified that there is little difference (1. 4 % at most) in the predicted force values of the two methods, thereby validating the adaptive depth buffer approach. The numerical simulations are also verified using experimental cutting tests of aluminum, and found to agree closely (within 12 %).

5000|$|Saw chains operate {{by being}} {{propelled}} around a guide bar, removing {{material from the}} [...] by cutting chips from the side and bottom. In order to operate properly, the depth to which each tooth cuts must be limited to avoid it binding in the wood. Scratcher chain, like the teeth on a hand saw, simply uses a multitude of teeth to prevent individual teeth from sinking too far in without undue pressure on the bar. Chipper chain, and all subsequent designs, incorporate a depth gauge (also known as a [...] "raker") on each cutter link to limit depth of cut on each tooth. This has two distinct advantages over scratcher chain - it {{enables the use of}} fewer <b>cutters</b> per unit <b>length</b> of chain, which allows for shorter downtime for sharpening, and produces a more [...] "open" [...] chain layout, allowing far better clearance of chips and debris from the kerf. Individual depth gauges on each tooth also enable the use of skip chain. Skip or semi-skip chain has a further {{reduction in the number of}} teeth and is used for applications where much debris is produced, such as ripping or cross-cutting very large sections of wood. Skip chain also absorbs less power from the motor per unit length of chain than full-complement chain, allowing the use of a longer bar/chain combination on any given motor.|$|R
40|$|What can be {{done when}} someone is riding a bicycle in a large {{metropolitan}} area, and when they reach their destination they find that there either is no bike rack, or the rack is already full. For bikers who prefer {{the security of a}} standard U-lock, this means having to leave to find another rack elsewhere or leave your bike unlocked. This situation is the why {{there is a need for}} a bike lock which can combine the security of a U-lock, with the flexibility and size of a chain. This project solves the problem by using a hardened steel chain, comprised of long sturdy chain links connected by stainless steel rivets. This allows for a bike to be locked to a telephone pole or tree about a foot in diameter, while still protecting the bike from the threat of bike theft. This was accomplished through the selection of a strong steel with good hardenability, followed by forces analyses to determine what shape and size is required to prevent tampering from standard bike theft tools, such as hacksaws, bolt cutters, and pry bars. These analyses resulted in a necessary chain link cross-section of 1. 250 inches by 0. 250 inches, to resist bolt <b>cutters,</b> and a <b>length</b> of each link being 15 inches in total. The required hardness to resist cutting from a hacksaw is above 65 on the Rockwell C Scale, and the design includes washers to prevent a pry bar from fitting between the links...|$|R

Analysis of moisture of raw materials and their calorific value were carried out according to binding norms. Moisture of compacted raw materials was within 10. 1 - 13. 3 %, where-as the calorific value was from 16. 1 to 17. 9 MJ. kg- 1. Pellets were produced in a pelleting machine with an immobile flat matrix and driven compressing rolls, whereas briquettes were produced in a screw briquetting machine with a heated compressing chamber. The following values of temperature of the compressing chamber of a briquetting machine were assumed: 200, 225 and 250 ºC. For meas-urement of energy consumption of the raw materials compression process power, time and electric energy converter Lumel 3000 was used.

40|$|In {{the last}} few years, {{especially}} in the developed countries, an increment in demand for fresh-cut fruit by the consumers of all ages has occurred. This increase is mainly due to the importance that people are giving to the consumption of fresh, healthy, and low-calorie food products. Fresh-cut pineapple (Ananas comosus) {{is one of the}} fruits that consumers can eat quickly and still enjoy its benefits; however, its shelf-life is very short (7 days). A means to preserve all the natural and beneficial components of fresh-cut pineapple is coating the fruit with an edible material, a coating. This coating acts as a barrier against moisture loss and gas exchanges and can be a carrier of other components like antimicrobials, which can help to extend the shelf-life of the fresh-cut fruit. The main objective {{of this study was to}} develop an edible coating with an antimicrobial agent for fresh-cut pineapple and to determine its effectiveness in extending shelf-life and preserving fruit quality attributes. Different treatments consisted of several concentrations of sodium alginate (0. 5 %, 1 %, and 2 %); beta-cyclodextrin, trans-cinnamaldehyde (antimicrobial), pectin, and calcium chloride were tested for formulation of the edible coating. The layer-by-layer technique with a dipping method was used to coat the fruits. Pineapples were properly cleaned with a chlorine solution (300 ppm) and triangular prisms (3. 6 cm per side) were cut using a triangular <b>cutter.</b> The <b>length</b> of the triangular prisms was adjusted to 2. 54 cm using a small knife measured with a ruler. Color, texture, pH, degrees Brix (total soluble solids), acidity, vitamin C, moisture content, and weight loss, were monitored every 3 to 4 days for 15 days. Microbiological tests (aerobic plate counts, psychrotrophic counts, and yeast and molds counts) were performed to determine the effectiveness of the antimicrobial compound. In terms of microbiological and physicochemical quality attributes, the coating improved the shelf-life of the fresh-cut pineapple up to 12 days compared to the control (fresh-cut pineapple without the coating) which only lasted 7 days at 4 degrees C. Color, texture and pH, were better preserved in the treated (coated) fruit compared to controls (uncoated). Different concentrations of the solutions in the formation of the coating had different results in terms of the preservation of the quality attributes of the fruit. Antimicrobial coatings with a concentration of alginate of 1 % and 2 % (w/w), pectin 2 % (w/w) and calcium chloride 2 % (w/w) presented a satisfactory formulation to preserve fruit quality attributes like moisture content, help to control juice leakage, and avoid microbial growth. Antimicrobial coating with 1 % of alginate (w/w), 2 % of pectin (w/w), 2 % of calcium chloride (w/w) and 2 % of antimicrobial compound (w/w) was the best formulation.
