25|$|International NGOs (INGOs) {{have found}} {{operating}} in Iraq highly dangerous to their staff, as between March 2003 and March 2008 94 aid workers were killed, 248 injured, 24 arrested or detained and 89 kidnapped or abducted. This {{has led to}} INGOs to either <b>completely</b> <b>unwind</b> their operations, or else go undercover {{and try to make}} their activities as low profile as possible. INGOs are not treated as neutral parties by large sections of the population due to their beginning operations alongside the invasion and receiving security and funding from the multinational force and the governments that it consists of. The security situation has also led to much of the management of aid programmes to take place abroad, thus lowering the effectiveness of the programmes and creating a fragmented response. Researchers at the Overseas Development Institute have discussed the importance of using local organisations and also understanding the violence not a single insurmountable challenge, but understanding various acts of violence more individually, sharing the knowledge between agencies and responding more appropriately - the formation of the NGO Coordination Committee in Iraq is a step in this direction.|$|E
5000|$|Electronic control {{also made}} it simpler to time very long shutter speeds. A spring-wound {{clockwork}} escapement must <b>completely</b> <b>unwind</b> fairly quickly and limit the longest speed - generally to one full second, although the Kine Exakta (Germany) offered 12 s in 1936. The Olympus OM-2's electronically timed horizontal FP shutter could reach 60 s in 1975 and the Olympus OM-4 (both Japan) reached 240 s in 1983. The Pentax LX (Japan, 1980) and Canon New F-1 (Japan, 1981) even had hybrid electromechanical FP shutters that timed their fast speeds mechanically, but used electronics only to extend the slow speed range; the LX to 125 s, the F-1N to a modest 8 s. Note, the Nikon F4 (Japan, 1989) was specified to reach a timed shutter speed of 999 hours {{with the use of}} the accessory electronic Multi Control Back MF-23. In theory, the longest available speed is limited only by available battery power for the electronics. This caught some 1970s photographers by surprise when they attempted very long [...] "B" [...] exposures and found their camera batteries had died in the middle because of the era's power hungry electronics and ruined the exposure.|$|E
50|$|The leg is outstretched to {{the side}} while the poi are being swung {{to the side}}s of the body. The poi string or chain makes contact with the outstretched leg, causing the lower portion of the string or chain to be wound round the leg. Provided the poi had enough speed when contact with the leg was made, it will wind {{completely}} around the leg, with the head impacting the leg. The head will then rebound. Pulling upon the string/chain at this point will mean that, again provided there was enough initial speed, the poi <b>completely</b> <b>unwinds</b> from the leg and swings freely in the opposite direction to the one it did initially. At this point the swinger can proceed with another trick.|$|R

Lett. 80, 26001 (2007)), we have shown that a {{compensated}} cholesteric liquid crystal (in which the macroscopic helix <b>completely</b> <b>unwinds)</b> may be subjected to a thermomechanical torque (the so-called Lehmann effect), in agreement with previous findings of Eber and Janossy (Mol. Cryst. Liq. Cryst. Lett. 72, 233 (1982)). These results prove that one {{must take into account}} the chirality of the molecules and the absence of inversion symmetry at the macroscopic scale when deriving the constitutive equations of the phase at the compensation temperature. In this paper, we present the details of our experimental work and a new experiment performed in a sample treated for planar gliding anchoring. The latter experiment, coupled with a numerical simulation, supports the existence of a thermomechanical coupling in a compensated cholesteric...|$|R
25|$|This {{is related}} to the {{so-called}} resumption model of exception handling, in which some exceptions are said to be continuable: it is permitted to return to the expression that signaled an exception, after having taken corrective action in the handler. The condition system is generalized thus: within the handler of a non-serious condition (a.k.a. continuable exception), it is possible to jump to predefined restart points (a.k.a. restarts) that lie between the signaling expression and the condition handler. Restarts are functions closed over some lexical environment, allowing the programmer to repair this environment before exiting the condition handler <b>completely</b> or <b>unwinding</b> the stack even partially.|$|R

The homotopy classification is no longer provided by the Hopf invariant, but rather by the set of integer homotopy invariants proposed by Pontrjagin. The nature of these invariants depends on the boundary conditions. A set of tightly wound parallel vortices of the usual Hopfion structure is observed to form a bunch of intertwined vortices or <b>unwind</b> <b>completely,</b> depending on the boundary conditions.

50|$|The {{mainspring}} {{is wound}} {{by turning the}} arbor, but drives the watch movement by the barrel; this arrangement allows the spring to continue powering the watch while it is being wound. Winding the watch turns the arbor, which tightens the mainspring, wrapping it closer around the arbor. The arbor has a ratchet attached to it, with a click to prevent the spring from turning the arbor backward and unwinding. After winding, the arbor is stationary and {{the pull of the}} mainspring turns the barrel, which has a ring of gear teeth around it. This meshes with one of the clocks gears, usually the center wheel pinion and drives the wheel train. The barrel usually rotates once every 8 hours, so the common 40-hour spring requires 5 turns to <b>unwind</b> <b>completely.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Analyzing old {{eyewitness}} reports, Jim McKeague {{explained how}} poor, itinerant conjuring troupes could have performed the trick using known magical techniques. [...] If {{a ball of}} cord is thrown upwards, one end being retained in the hand, the ball rapidly decreases in size as it rises. As it <b>unwinds</b> <b>completely</b> the illusion of the ball disappearing into the sky is striking, especially if the pale cord is similar in color to any overcast cloud. Before the cord has time to fall the climber leaps up, pretending to climb, but really being lifted by a companion. Skilled acrobats could make this quick [...] "climb" [...] look very effective until the climber's feet are at or even above the lifter's head. Then a noisy distraction from {{other members of the}} troupe is the misdirection needed which allows the climber to drop unseen to the ground and hide.

40|$|The NS 3 protein of {{hepatitis}} C virus (HCV) is a bifunctional protein containing a serine protease in the N-terminal one-third, which is stimulated upon binding of the NS 4 A cofactor, and an RNA helicase in the C-terminal two-thirds. In this study, a C-terminal hexahistidine-tagged helicase {{domain of the}} HCV NS 3 protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity by conventional chromatography. The purified HCV helicase domain has a basal ATPase activity, a polynucleotide-stimulated ATPase activity, and a nucleic acid unwinding activity and binds efficiently to single-stranded polynucleotide. Detailed characterization of the purified HCV helicase domain with regard to all four activities is presented. Recently, we published an X-ray crystallographic structure of a binary complex of the HCV helicase with a (dU) 8 oligonucleotide, in which several conserved residues of the HCV helicase were shown {{to be involved in}} interactions between the HCV helicase and oligonucleotide. Here, site-directed mutagenesis was used to elucidate the roles of these residues in helicase function. Four individual mutations, Thr to Ala at position 269, Thr to Ala at position 411, Trp to Leu at position 501, and Trp to Ala at position 501, produced a severe reduction of RNA binding and <b>completely</b> abolished <b>unwinding</b> activity and stimulation of ATPase activity by poly(U), although the basal ATPase activity (activity in the absence of polynucleotide) of these mutants remained intact. Alanine substitution at Ser- 231 or Ser- 370 resulted in enzymes that were indistinguishable from wild-type HCV helicase with regard to all four activities. A mutant bearing Phe at Trp- 501 showed wild-type levels of basal ATPase, unwinding activity, and single-stranded RNA binding activity. Interestingly, ATPase activity of this mutant became less responsive to stimulation by poly(U) but not to stimulation by other polynucleotides, such as poly(C). Given the conservation of some of these residues in other DNA and RNA helicases, their role in the mechanism of unwinding of double-stranded nucleic acid is discussed...|$|R
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the DNA substrate specificity of BACH 1 (BRCA 1 -associated C-terminal helicase). The importance of various DNA structural elements for efficient unwinding by purified recombinant BACH 1 helicase was examined. The results indicated that BACH 1 preferentially binds and unwinds a forked duplex substrate compared with a duplex flanked by only one single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) tail. In support of its DNA substrate preference, helicase sequestration studies revealed that BACH 1 can be preferentially trapped by forked duplex molecules. BACH 1 helicase requires a minimal 5 2 ̆ 7 ssDNA tail of 15 nucleotides for unwinding of conventional duplex DNA substrates; however, the enzyme is able to catalytically release the third strand of the homologous recombination intermediate D-loop structure irrespective of DNA tail status. In contrast, BACH 1 <b>completely</b> fails to <b>unwind</b> a synthetic Holliday junction structure. Moreover, BACH 1 requires nucleic acid continuity in the 5 2 ̆ 7 ssDNA tail of the forked duplex substrate within six nucleotides of the ssDNA-dsDNA junction to initiate efficiently DNA unwinding. These studies provide the first detailed information on the DNA substrate specificity of BACH 1 helicase and provide insight to the types of DNA structures the enzyme is likely to act upon to perform its functions in DNA repair or recombination...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{premature}} {{aging and}} cancer-prone Werner and Bloom syndromes {{are caused by}} defects in the RecQ helicase enzymes WRN and BLM, respectively. Recently, both WRN and BLM (as well as several other RecQ members) {{have been shown to}} possess a strand annealing activity in addition to the requisite DNA unwinding activity. Since an annealing function would appear to directly oppose the action of a helicase, we have examined in this study the dynamic equilibrium between unwinding and annealing mediated by either WRN or BLM. Results Our investigation into the competition between annealing and unwinding demonstrates that, under standard reaction conditions, WRN- or BLM-mediated annealing can partially or <b>completely</b> mask <b>unwinding</b> as measured in standard helicase assays. Several strategies were employed to suppress the annealing activity so that the actual strength of WRN- or BLM-dependent unwinding could be more accurately assessed. Interestingly, if a DNA oligomer complementary to one strand of the DNA substrate to be unwound is added during the helicase reaction, both WRN and BLM unwinding is enhanced, presumably by preventing protein-mediated re-annealing. This strategy allowed measurement of WRN-catalyzed unwinding of long (80 base pair) duplex regions and fully complementary, blunt-ended duplexes, both of which were otherwise quite refractory to the helicase activity of WRN. Similarly, the addition of trap strand stimulated the ability of BLM to unwind long and blunt-ended duplexes. The stimulatory effect of the human replication protein A (hRPA, the eukaryotic single-stranded DNA binding protein) on both WRN- and BLM-dependent unwinding was also re-examined in light of its possible role in preventing re-annealing. Our results show that hRPA influences the outcome of WRN and BLM helicase assays by both inhibiting re-annealing and directly promoting unwinding, with the larger contribution from the latter mechanism. Conclusion These findings indicate that measurements of unwinding by WRN, BLM, and probably other RecQ helicases are complicated by their annealing properties. Thus, WRN- and BLM-dependent unwinding activities are significantly stronger than previously believed. Since this broadens the range of potential physiological substrates for WRN and BLM, our findings have relevance for understanding their functions in vitro and in vivo. </p...|$|R
40|$|A mutant {{simian virus}} 40 (SV 40) large tumor (T) antigen bearing alanine instead of {{threonine}} at residue 124 (T 124 A) failed to replicate SV 40 DNA in infected monkey cells (J. Schneider and E. Fanning, J. Virol. 62 : 1598 - 1605, 1988). We investigated the biochemical properties of T 124 A T antigen {{in greater detail}} by using purified protein from a baculovirus expression system. Purified T 124 A is defective in SV 40 DNA replication in vitro, but does bind specifically to the viral origin under the conditions normally used for DNA replication. The mutant protein forms double-hexamer complexes at the origin in an ATP-dependent fashion, although the binding reaction requires somewhat higher protein concentrations than the wild-type protein. Binding of T 124 A protein results in local distortion of the origin DNA similar to that observed with the wild-type protein. These findings indicate that the replication defect of T 124 A protein is not due to failure to recognize and occupy the origin. Under some conditions T 124 A is capable of unwinding short origin DNA fragments. However, the mutant protein is almost <b>completely</b> defective in <b>unwinding</b> of circular plasmid DNA molecules containing the SV 40 origin. Since the helicase activity of T 124 A is essentially identical {{to that of the}} wild-type protein, we conclude that the mutant is defective in the initial opening of the duplex at the origin, possibly as a result of altered hexamer-hexamer interactions. The phenotype of T 124 A suggests a possible role for phosphorylation of threonine 124 by cyclin-dependent kinases in controlling the origin unwinding activity of T antigen in infected cells...|$|R
40|$|The {{catalytic}} subunit {{of protein}} phosphatase 2 A (PP 2 Ac) stimulates {{the initiation of}} replication of simian virus 40 DNA in vitro by dephosphorylating T antigen at specific phosphoserine residues (K. H. Scheidtmann, D. M. Virshup, and T. J. Kelly, J. Virol. 65 : 2098 - 2101, 1991). To better define the biochemical mechanism responsible for this stimulation, we investigated the effect of PP 2 Ac on the interaction of T antigen with wild-type and mutant origins of replication. Analysis of the binding of T antigen to the wild-type origin {{as a function of}} protein concentration revealed that binding occurs in two relatively discrete steps: the assembly of a T-antigen hexamer on one half-site of the origin, followed by the assembly of the second hexamer on the other half-site. The major effect of PP 2 Ac was to stimulate binding of the second hexamer, so that the binding reaction became much more cooperative. This observation suggests that dephosphorylation of T antigen by PP 2 Ac primarily affects interactions between the two hexamers bound to the origin. Pretreatment with PP 2 Ac increased the ability of the bound T antigen to unwind the origin of replication but had no effect on the intrinsic helicase activity of the protein. Thus, dephosphorylation of PP 2 Ac appears to increase the efficiency of the initial opening of the origin by T antigen. An insertion mutation at the dyad axis in the simian virus 40 origin, which altered the structural relationship of the two halves of the origin, abolished the effect of the phosphatase on the cooperativity of binding and <b>completely</b> prevented origin <b>unwinding.</b> These findings suggest that the ability of T antigen to open the viral origin of DNA replication is critically dependent on the appropriate functional interactions between T-antigen hexamers and that these interactions are regulated by the phosphorylation state of the viral initiator protein...|$|R
