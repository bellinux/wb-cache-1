5|$|Almost a {{thousand}} impact craters on Venus are evenly distributed across its surface. On other cratered bodies, such as Earth and the Moon, craters show {{a range of}} states of degradation. On the Moon, degradation is caused by subsequent impacts, whereas on Earth it is caused by wind and rain erosion. On Venus, about 85% of the craters are in pristine condition. The number of craters, together with their well-preserved condition, indicates the planet underwent a global resurfacing event about 300–600 million years ago, followed by a decay in volcanism. Whereas Earth's crust is in <b>continuous</b> <b>motion,</b> Venus {{is thought to be}} unable to sustain such a process. Without plate tectonics to dissipate heat from its mantle, Venus instead undergoes a cyclical process in which mantle temperatures rise until they reach a critical level that weakens the crust. Then, over a period of about 100 million years, subduction occurs on an enormous scale, completely recycling the crust.|$|E

Although existing literature challenged the benefits of <b>continuous</b> passive <b>motion</b> claiming it had no added short-term or long-term benefits after knee arthroplasty (Boese et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2012; Herbold et al., 2014; Leach et al., 2006; Maniar et al., 2012), the existing literature is difficult to generalize and apply to the veteran population at San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center. This study was undertaken to determine the efficacy of <b>continuous</b> passive <b>motion</b> in helping veteran patients at San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center achieve post-operative range of motion goals following total knee arthroplasty. Using a retrospective design an extensive chart review was conducted.

It is the idea to use the topological dual of the Voronoi diagram that is shown to be locally stable under sufficiently small <b>continuous</b> <b>motions,</b> in opposite to the accompanying Voronoi diagram which is reconstructed from its dual only when it is needed. We present an efficient, numerically stable update algorithm for the topological structure of the Voronoi diagram in a dynamic scene, using only O(log n) time for each change (which is worst-case optimal). Furthermore, we develop fast algorithms for inserting and deleting points {{at the edge of}} the dynamic scene. There are a lot of related problems in computational geometry, as for example the dynamic convex hull and the dynamic nearest neighbor problem, but also applications in motion planning and pattern recognition in dynamic scenes...|$|R

It also required less power for running in level ice than traditional designs, resulting in 40–50% reduction in ice resistance due to lubricating effect of propeller-induced water flow, more open stern design and the propellers being allowed to mill (crush) the ice. The icebreaking capability of an Azipod-equipped icebreaker operating astern in level ice was also found out to be superior to traditional icebreakers regardless of propulsion arrangement.|$|E

25|$|If {{the edges}} of the {{framework}} are assumed to be rigid bars that can neither expand nor contract (but can freely rotate) then any motion respecting this rigidity must preserve the lengths of the edges: the derivative of length, {{as a function of the}} time over which the motion occurs, must remain zero. This condition may be expressed in linear algebra as a constraint that the gradient vector of the motion of the vertices must have zero inner product with the row of the rigidity matrix that represents the given edge. Thus, the family of gradients of (infinitesimally) rigid motions is given by the nullspace of the rigidity matrix. For frameworks that are not in generic position, it is possible that some infinitesimally rigid motions (vectors in the nullspace of the rigidity matrix) are not the gradients of any <b>continuous</b> <b>motion,</b> but this cannot happen for generic frameworks.|$|E
25|$|Two {{disjoint}} closed curves {{that both}} {{lie on the}} same plane are unlinked, and more generally a pair of disjoint closed curves {{is said to be}} unlinked when there is a continuous deformation of space that moves them both onto the same plane, without without either curve passing through the other or through itself. If there is no such <b>continuous</b> <b>motion,</b> the two curves are said to be linked. For example, the Hopf link is formed by two circles that each pass through the disk spanned by the other. It forms the simplest example of a pair of linked curves, but it is possible for curves to be linked in other more complicated ways. If two curves are not linked, then it is possible to find a topological disk in space, having the first curve as its boundary and disjoint from the second curve. Conversely if such a disk exists then the curves are necessarily unlinked.|$|E
25|$|A {{framework}} has {{a unique}} realization in d-dimensional space if every placement of the same graph with the same edge lengths is congruent to it. Such a framework must necessarily be rigid, because otherwise there exists a <b>continuous</b> <b>motion</b> bringing it to a non-congruent placement with the same edge lengths, but unique realizability is stronger than rigidity. For instance, the diamond graph (two triangles sharing an edge) is rigid in two dimensions, {{but it is not}} uniquely realizable because it has two different realizations, one in which the triangles are {{on opposite sides of the}} shared edge and one in which they are both on the same side. Uniquely realizable graphs are important in applications that involve reconstruction of shapes from distances, such as triangulation in land surveying, the determination of the positions of the nodes in a wireless sensor network, and the reconstruction of conformations of molecules via nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.|$|E

Motion vectors (MVs) of spatially adjacent blocks are often exploited as credible MV candidates in searching <b>continuous</b> <b>motions.</b> However, {{they are no longer}} helpful when searching complex or random motions. We propose a novel multi-resolution BMA to solve this problem. At the coarsest level, a full search BMA (FSBMA) is performed for searching complex or random motions. Concurrently, spatial correlation of MV "eld is used for searching <b>continuous</b> <b>motions.</b> Here {{we present a}}n e$cient method for searching full resolution MVs without MV decimation even at the coarsest level. After the coarsest level search, two or three initial MV candidates are chosen for the next level. At the following levels, the MV candidates are re"ned within smaller search areas. Experimental results show that in comparison with FSBMA, the proposed BMA achieves a speed-up factor over 710 with minor PSNR degradation of 0. 2 dB at most, under a normal MPEG 2 encoding environment.

In order to guarantee the robot’s safety and <b>continuous</b> <b>motions,</b> this paper proposes a novel safety-control strategy, which is strictly conservative and which consists of a pre-contact and post-contact safety strategy. We adopt an optimal motion trajectory-planning method, by use of which the jerk, acceleration and velocity of the robot’s motion can be limited and a time-optimal motion can be obtained as a post-contact safety strategy for a position-controlled manipulator. The optimal motion trajectory planning not only reduces the impact forces during the collision period, but also maintains the efficiency of the manipulator and preserves <b>continuous</b> <b>motions.</b> Next, we describe a novel collision detection method as a pre-contact safety strategy to avoid collisions. The method proposed here can compute security warning region to handle the effect of robot motion on collision detection and detect collisions between non-convex polygon soups.
