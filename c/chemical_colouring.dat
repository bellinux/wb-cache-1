Abstract This research project offers new knowledge {{in the field of}} artificial patination and extends the application of colour to metals that have previously not been exploited for their colouring properties, specifically pewter and its main constituent, tin. The investigation defines, refines and applies new and evolved processes and techniques that provide novel opportunities for both craft and industry through the development of new products, particularly jewellery and tableware items. The thesis details the actions taken to substantiate the hypothesis that pewter and tin may be coloured by chemical means. This includes the interpretation, exploitation and creative application of developed processes to the design and production of new works. It also discusses the research method applied and the rationales that have informed decision making. The research project is reviewed in separate chapters discussing each phase of the investigation. These phases are:  The selection, testing and analysis of <b>chemical</b> <b>colouring</b> processes within the workshop and laboratory.  Investigation into working properties of the coloured material and surface pattern development.  The creative application of outcomes from the above two phases to new works.  Evaluation of the research outcomes in relation to creative practice and their potential for wider commercial application The chemical exploration and design development phases of the research have been conducted in association with the International Tin Research Institute (ITRI Ltd) and the manufacturing industry, which has confirmed the validity of results. The model of collaboration adopted and associated outcomes are also discussed. Finally, the thesis considers the impact of the research outcomes on the material, creative practice and implications for further investigation including the potential for wider commercial application of the patination procedures developed...|$|E

Creamy texture is an essential attribute of these cheeses, which results from structural properties that are not always well characterized. Here, the structural changes occurring during the ripening period of a traditional RESS-cheese, known as Serpa cheese, were analysed through small amplitude oscillatory shear (SAOS). Rheological data was complemented with other physical and chemical parameters, that were monitored during ripening, in order to estimate Serpa cheese ripening time using multiple linear regression (MLR). Mechanical spectra indicated a relatively strong structure, comparable to a gel, with a low dependence on frequency {{at the beginning of}} ripening and a weak structure, comparable to a concentrated suspension, with a crossing point (G″=G′) at the left of the graphic and with both moduli highly dependent on frequency, at the end of ripening. Good correlations (P< 0 · 05) were obtained between structural (hardness and storage modulus) and proteolysis indicators. Using a combination of <b>chemical,</b> <b>colour</b> and rheological parameters we were able to obtain a multiple linear regression (MLR) which allows the estimation of Serpa cheese ripening time with an estimation error of 1 · 7 d (adjusted R 2 = 0 · 98, P< 0 · 0001) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{diversity}} of fl ower colour has astonished artists, gardeners and scientists for centuries. Flowers generate colour by refl ecting only {{a subset of}} the wavelengths which make up white light, resulting in a coloured appear-ance. This is achieved either through the use of chemical pigments which absorb certain wavelengths, or by the use of structures which refl ect only certain wavelengths. <b>Chemical</b> <b>colour</b> has been well studied in plants, and the three major pigment groups are fl avonoids, carotenoids and betalains. Spatial and temporal regulation of the synthesis of these pigments gives pattern and depth of colour to the fl ower. Combinations of pigments can result in variations in fi nal fl ower colour, while the addition of metal ions and the alteration of cell pH can also infl uence the fi nal wavelengths absorbed by pigments. Focussing light into the pigment-containing regions of the cell, using specialised cell shapes, also infl uences intensity of fl ower colour. Structural colour, including iridescence, is produced independently of pigment colour, and can overlay it. Flower colour itself is viewed as an advertisement to attract pollinating animals to the rewards (usually nectar) contained within the fl ower. This article concludes with an analysis of the long-running debate over whether specifi c fl ower colours attract specifi c pollinators, or whether all colours are simply different ways of attracting a wide variety of animals...|$|R

40|$|Interest in {{the colour}} {{reproduction}} of artworks and artefacts is gaining more significance, {{as it is}} now recognised that some artefacts are too delicate to be exhibited and some important landmarks are no longer around due to damage by war or climate change. This brings a need for further research in how to obtain and transmit accurate colour information for the reproduction of texture, three-D artefacts, and the reconstruction of lost colour and heritage colours. There is a need to regain an understanding of the cultural implications of colour and an emerging area of discussion in relation to resilience. Cadmium red refers to a <b>chemical</b> <b>colour</b> that has been used and loved by artists for centuries, yet this extremely toxic colour is under threat. Cadmium is used in batteries, for electroplating, jewellery, footwear, and of course, paint. The restrictions on cadmium, like chromium or mercury, are obviously necessary for us and the environment, but have posed a problem for many industries reliant on these materials. A key challenge has been the costs involved in remanufacture using alternative materials. In the context of new legislation relating to heavy metals such as cadmium, ink manufacturers, for example, are now forced to reconsider the content of their inks and replace toxic pigments and materials with more environmentally safer versions. Yet despite the change in the constituents of the paint, the naming traditions that are so closely associated with art history are still used by paint manufacturers. The romance of Cadmium red remains even though distant from its traditional and cultural origins. Many the pigment colours of the 15 th and 16 th centuries are far removed from the dyes and acrylics of the 21 st century, but the naming of these new equivalents uses the terminology originally generated from the materials or associations of their forebears. The question remains: what impact does this have for the colour restorer or colour conservator? How might conventions and standards in colour naming for the paint manufacturer or the domestic paint industry be developed? We ask how red is the Cadmium red that is now available? Based on an inspection of traditional and contemporary paint charts, many variations of hues associated with Cadmium red can be seen. The range in saturation and hue will be explored. We also look closely at how a red hue that is loosely associated to a heritage name is used in the 21 st century. Albeit seeming a somewhat narrow question, it is predicated on a much larger enquiry that looks at the implications arising from a situation in which colour manifest in material form is an increasingly rare commodity. This has occurred due to the rise if digital fabrication technologies, redistributed manufacturing, applications for mimicking paint colours and brush strokes, and 2. 5 D printing. The challenge of the sustainability of using some colour sources and their resilience has also constrained colour use. In an apocryphal story by Jasper Fford about a world where colour is indeed synthetic (Shades of Grey: The Road to High Saffron), green is piped to the grass to colour it green, and colour is collected as a rare commodity. The question here is: what is the future of colour – as computational versions or facsimiles of <b>chemical</b> <b>colours</b> or colour that is salvaged? In a world of seemingly plenty, our resources are dwindling, yet colour remains a vital resource for our economy, society and culture. Our diversity of geography means that environmental colour, the colour of the stuff with which we build our dwellings, and those with which we describe our built and natural environments, have imbued our culture with a wide sensibility in respect of how colour works in everyday contemporary life, but we need to understand how we manage its integrity and our language for describing this resource in the light of new technology and care for the lived environment...|$|R

40|$|Chaotic terrains on Mars {{are mainly}} {{located in the}} source regions of the outflow {{channels}} East of Valles Marineris. They {{are supposed to be}} formed by fluidisation of an incompetent layer underlying material that is more competent. Various states of disruption are observed especially in chasmata where some knobs are present. The Mars Express HRSC provides 3 D-images of the Martian surface in high resolution while the OMEGA/-Mars Express spectrometer produces data characterising the mineralogical composition of the surface. Very high-resolution MOC images sometimes reveal the texture of the layer, whereas the relative mean grain size and structure of the material is given by THEMIS night time-infrared data. Using HRSC-, OMEGA-, THEMIS- and MOLA-data, a stratigraphic profile of the chaotic terrains in Valles Marineris from Eos Chasma to Meridiani Planum is made. Here we present a characterisation of the layers forming a chosen sample of chaotic terrain by the following parameters: albedo, thickness, <b>chemical</b> composition, <b>colour,</b> physical properties, stratigraphic position, and elevation...|$|R

Determination of physical parameters (air and water temperatures and <b>colour),</b> <b>chemicals</b> parameters of water (pH, Cl, hardness, alkalinity, phosphate) and sediments parameters (pH, available nitrogen and available phosphate) were carried out to identify the nature {{and quality of the}} water of Burdwan Municipality. The present study reveals that the quality of pond water positively depends on air and surface water temperature, pH of water and pH of the sediments.

5000|$|In 2009 Nitschke made a {{barbiturate}} testing kit available, initially {{launched in}} the UK, then Australia. Nitschke said the kit was made available by Exit International in response to growing demand for something to test the Nembutal obtained from Mexico, often delivered in the post without labels. [...] "They {{want to be sure}} they have the right concentration," [...] Nitschke said. The kits have <b>chemicals</b> that change <b>colour</b> when mixed with Nembutal. He was detained for an hour for questioning on arrival at Auckland Airport in New Zealand on a trip to hold public meetings and launch the kit.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The Lembo clay deposit {{occurs on}} orthogneiss, {{but it also}} {{comprises}} clays with litho-relicts of volcanic rocks. In this study, ten samples from two sites were investigated. The mineralogical compositions consisted of kaolinite + halloysite + illite + quartz + hematite + anatase> rutile> orthoclase> sanidine> magnetite> maghemite> goethite> Ba-Al-Fe-phosphates> carbonates> sulphates. Kaolinite-halloysite and quartz are the prevailing minerals. Some volcanic-derived clays contain Fe-rich kaolinite-halloysite (9. 614. 1 wt. % Fe 2 O 3). The <b>chemical</b> compositions, <b>colours</b> and specific surface area (SSA) measurements reveal two groups of clays: one with a positive whiteness index (IB), small SSA and small Fe content, and the other showing a large SSA, negative IB and relatively large Fe contents. The compositions of the first group are close to those of clays from the Mayouom deposit (Cameroon), and from some European commercial kaolins used in ceramics. Relatively Fe-rich clay materials may conform to most formulations of earthen bricks. As a whole, the Lembo clay deposit comprises various compositions of kaolinitic clays, which may yield the opportunity for extensive application in ceramics...|$|R
