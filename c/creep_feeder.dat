50|$|Weaning in horses {{usually takes}} place when the foal is 4 to 5 months old, as {{by this point}} the foal no longer needs {{nutrients}} beyond what the mare offers. Prior to weaning the foal, there is usually a <b>creep</b> <b>feeder</b> set up to allow the foal to begin consuming feed that the mare cannot access. There are two main approaches to weaning foals, abrupt and gradual weaning. Abrupt weaning is when the mare and foal are separated, usually without contact. Gradual weaning consists of the separating the mare and foal, but still with contact, but not enough contact that allows nursing to occur, and then {{after a period of}} time the mare and foal are separated not allowing contact, or, in some cases, sight of each other. Foals that are weaned by the abrupt method have shown to have higher stressful behaviors displayed. Weaning foals in groups for both methods can reduce stress in the foals.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} the effects of <b>creep</b> <b>feeder</b> design and feed accessibility on preweaning performance and the proportion of eaters of creep feed. Materials and methods: A total of 54 sows and their litters were assigned to three treatments: rotary feeder with hopper, rotary feeder without hopper, and pan feeder. A creep diet with 1. 0 % chromic oxide was offered ad libitum from Day 18 until weaning (Day 21). Fecal samples were collected from piglets with sterile swabs 3 to 12 hours before weaning. Piglets were categorized as “eaters” when either of the two fecal samples was colored green; otherwise, they were categorized as “non-eaters. ” Pigs were weighed Days 0 (birth), 18, and 21, and litter creep-feed disappearance was determined daily. Results: There were no differences (P >. 05) in preweaning gains and weaning weights of pigs and litters using the different types of <b>creep</b> <b>feeder.</b> Litters provided creep feed using the rotary feeder with the hopper had 2. 7 times lower total creep-feed disappearance than litters using the rotary feeder without the hopper and the pan feeder (P <. 001). However, the rotary feeder with the hopper produced the highest proportion of pigs consuming creep feed within the litter (80 %; P <. 001). Implications: The proper choice of <b>creep</b> <b>feeder</b> is essential to manage creep feeding and to maximize the number of eaters in the litter.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this experiment {{was to determine the}} effects of different <b>creep</b> <b>feeder</b> designs and increased feed accessibility on creep feed consumption and pre-weaning performance. A total of 54 sows (PIC Line 1050) and their litters were used in this study. Two groups of sows were blocked according to parity and date of farrowing using a randomized complete block design and allotted to three experimental treatments: Treatment 1 – rotary feeder with hopper (Control), Treatment 2 – rotary feeder without hopper, and Treatment 3 – pan feeder. A creep diet (1, 585 kcal ME/lb, 1. 56 % TID Lys) with 1. 0 % chromium oxide was offered ad libitum at d 18 until weaning (d 21). A single lactation diet (1, 586 kcal ME/lb, 0. 97 % TID Lys) was used, where sows were allowed free access to feed throughout lactation. Piglets were weighed individually at d 0 (birth), 18, and 21 (weaning) to calculate total and daily gains. Litter creep feed intake as feed disappearance was also calculated. Fecal samples from all piglets were taken twice using sterile swabs between 3 and 12 h before weaning for all treatments. Piglets were categorized as ‘eaters’ when the fecal sample was colored green at least once on any of the two samplings. Results showed no differences in pig (P< 0. 18) and litter (P< 0. 51) weights at weaning among litters using the different types of <b>creep</b> <b>feeder.</b> Total and daily gains of pigs (P< 0. 20) and litters (P< 0. 31) were also similar across treatments. Litters using the rotary feeder without the hopper or the pan feeder had 2. 7 times greater (P< 0. 0001) total creep disappearance than those using the rotary feeder with the hopper. The average feeding frequency was 1, 2. 3, and 4. 2 times per 12 h for the rotary feeder with and without the hopper, and the pan feeder, respectively. <b>Creep</b> <b>feeder</b> design influenced (P< 0. 0001) the proportion of eaters created among piglets provided with creep feed. There were 69, 47, and 42 % eaters in creep-fed litters using the rotary feeder with a hopper, rotary feeder without hopper, and pan feeder, respectively. In conclusion, the proportion of eaters in creep-fed litters can be influenced by non-dietary factors, such as <b>creep</b> <b>feeder</b> design...|$|E
40|$|This NebGuide {{discusses}} {{the benefits and}} implications of creep feeding horses during the growing period of development. Creep feeding, providing a place where foals can eat without interference from the mare and other horses, should be used if foals are to grow at optimum rates. <b>Creep</b> <b>feeders</b> are used to provide a nutritionally balanced, digestible concentrate to young nursing foals before weaning. The practice of creep feeding serves to supply nutrients beyond what a foal receives from mare 2 ̆ 7 s milk. And, creep feeding minimizes foals 2 ̆ 7 intake of broodmare feed which often lacks the concentrated amounts of protein and minerals relative to the energy needed by foals. <b>Creep</b> <b>feeders</b> also decrease the chances for injury to a foal when competing for feed from the mare 2 ̆ 7 s <b>feeder.</b> Finally, <b>creep</b> <b>feeders</b> allow foals to become accustomed to eating concentrates before weaning time, thus reducing weaning stress...|$|R
30|$|Sufficient {{knowledge}} and understanding of the farming system is essential to make it sustainable. We used household surveys to identify farmers’ circumstances in the target area (Henning et al. 2007), then new technologies/intervention strategies were planned, designed and followed by on-farm testing for a period of one year (Henning et al. 2009). In transferring new technology, {{it is important to understand}} a farmer’s own evaluation of its performance during early adoption. Feedback from farmers on the research methodology used and on equipment promoted was collected and recommendations given by farmers during pilot-testing and extension workshops were followed up. For instance <b>creep</b> <b>feeders</b> for chick feeding were modified based on the advice given by farmers early in the project.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the influence of creep feeding and creep grazing on the pasture characteristics and on performance and productivity of sheep. Three systems of lambs production on Tifton 85 (Cynodon spp.) pastures oversown with Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam) were studied: lambs with dams until slaughter without supplementation (1); lambs with dams until slaughter fed concentrate in <b>creep</b> <b>feeders</b> at 2 % BW. day- 1 (2); and lambs with dams until slaughter and supplemented with white clover (Trifolium repens) in creep grazing system ad libitum (3). The characteristics of the pasture did not differ (P> 0. 05) among the systems. Individual lamb growth was higher with creep feeding (307 g/day) and creep grazing (274 g/day) compared to no supplemented systems (204 g/day; p< 0. 05). Animal productivity per area on supplemented treatments (2. 4 kg BW/ha/day) was significantly greater than no supplemented one (1. 8 kg BW/ha/day; p< 0. 05). White clover showed to be a particularly good supplement for raising lambs on pastures.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Animal Sciences and IndustryMichael D. TokachFive {{experiments}} {{were performed to}} {{determine the influence of}} creep feeding on individual consumption characteristics and growth performance of neonatal and weanling pigs. These evaluated the effects of lactation feed intake and creep feeding (n = 84 litters; Exp. 1), creep feeding duration (n = 54 litters; Exp. 2), <b>creep</b> <b>feeder</b> design and feed accessibility (n = 54 litters; Exp. 3), organoleptic properties of the creep feed (n = 50 litters; Exp. 4) and creep diet complexity (n = 96 litters; Exp. 5). In summary, creep feeding did not affect preweaning gains and weaning weights of pigs weaned at 3 weeks of age. Creep feeding for 18 d did not influence sow performance. However, creep feeding tended to improve litter weaning weights due to improved survivability. Creep feed consumption was related to piglet maturity rather than the induction of creep feeding. In both experimental and field conditions, pigs that consumed creep feed (eaters) had greater post-weaning feed intake and daily gains compared to non-eaters (pigs that did not consume creep feed) and non-creep fed pigs. This led to improvements in pig weight uniformity and reduction of the severity of post-weaning lag. These benefits were achieved regardless of weaning weight, the complexity of the creep diet, and the duration of creep feeding. The proportion of eaters of creep feed in whole litters can be manipulated. Longer duration of creep feeding increased the proportion of eaters. A rotary <b>creep</b> <b>feeder</b> with a hopper created the most eaters with the lowest creep feed disappearance. Creep diet complexity had the greatest effect in increasing the proportion of pigs consuming creep feed. On the other hand, low feed intake of lactating sows and adding feed flavors to the creep feed did not affect creep feed consumption and the proportion of pigs consuming creep feed. Therefore, creep feeding that focuses in encouraging more suckling piglets to eat is beneficial in producing weanling pigs that are better adapted to weaning, which improves post-weaning performance...|$|E

30|$|These {{issues were}} then {{addressed}} in a 12 -month intervention study with different interventions or treatments being applied to randomly selected flocks (Henning et al. 2009). In this study we compared the profitability for households {{of the use of}} Newcastle disease vaccination (Treatment 1 [*]=[*]TR 1) with improved chick rearing management (TR 3) to neither strategy (TR 2) in an average sized flock of village chickens. Vaccination of individual birds against ND (TR 1) was conducted using the thermostable live I- 2 ND vaccine produced by LBVD. ND vaccine was administered in eye drops, by veterinarians from the Myanmar LBVD. Improved management of chicks (TR 3) included the provision of both coops (for the protection of chicks from predation) and chick starter feed inside a <b>creep</b> <b>feeder</b> (to support chicks’ nutrition). The equipment for the confinement, the feeds, and the vaccinations were provided free of charge to participants during the randomised controlled trial, which was carried out from July 2004 until June 2005. Assuming costs to be incurred if farmers implement I- 2 ND vaccination or improved chick management themselves we modelled the income from the sale of chickens under the three treatments {{and we were able to}} show that the group of farmers who introduced changes to the management of young chicks had an significant increase in the number of birds sold after a period of six months resulting in additional income from the sale of birds (Henning et al. 2009).|$|E
30|$|Farmer {{workshops}} {{were the}} major tool {{to deliver the}} extension messages on improving village chicken health and {{on the use of}} the intervention methods. These workshops were conducted in common spiritual or communal places (e.g. in monasteries, in the house of the village head person, in schools or in village offices) from June until September 2007 in 47 villages in three different divisions of Myanmar (Yangon, Bago, Mandalay Divisions). Women and children as the main poultry keepers were the main target in the workshops. Training of trainers resulted in training of 14 field veterinarians and 47 village head people to deliver the extension messages on village chicken health and improved chick husbandry. Overall a total of 166 workshops were conducted with 3, 969 trainees attending (representing about 50 % of the 9, 157 village households in the 47 villages). Farmers who had positive experiences with the interventions in the field studies were invited to report on their experiences. Farmers could purchase the extension equipment (bamboo coops, <b>creep</b> <b>feeders,</b> chick starter feed) used in the intervention studies. During the trainings sessions a total of 1750 complete sets of extension equipment for improved chick management were sold to farmers.

Concentrates were offered from <b>creep</b> <b>feeders</b> (kids) and troughs (kids and does) until weaning (10 weeks), after which the kids were held in separate paddocks until 16 weeks of age. Experience of concentrates prior to weaning facilitated higher feed consumptions at weaning, but these effects were not apparent at later times. At all ages, single kids were significantly (PcO. 05) heavier than twins, and males and castrates were significantly (PcO. 05) heavier than females. At 6 weeks of age {{there were no significant}} differences in the liveweights of kids in the different feeding groups.

40|$|A {{cost-benefit}} analysis using deterministic and stochastic modelling {{was conducted to}} identify the net benefits for households that adopt (1) vaccination of individual birds against Newcastle disease (ND) or (2) improved management of chick rearing by providing coops {{for the protection of}} chicks from predation and chick starter feed inside a <b>creep</b> <b>feeder</b> to support chicks 2 ̆ 7 nutrition in village chicken flocks in Myanmar. Partial budgeting was used to assess the additional costs and benefits associated with each of the two intervendons tested relative to neither strategy. In the deterministic model, over the first 3 years after the introduction of the interventions, the cumulative sum of the net differences from neither strategy was 13, 189 Kyat for ND vaccination and 77, 645 Kyat for improved chick management (effective exchange rate in 2005 : 1000 Kyat= 1 US). Both interventions were also profitable after discounting over a 10 -year period; Net Present Values for ND vaccination and improved chick management were 30, 791 and 167, 825 Kyat, respectively. The Benefit-Cost Ratio for ND vaccination was very high (28. 8). This was lower for improved chick management, due to greater costs of the intervention, but still favourable at 4. 7. Using both interventions concurrently yielded a Net Present Value of 470, 543 Kyat and a Benefit-Cost Ratio of 11. 2 over the 10 -year period in the deterministic model. Using the stochastic model, for the first 3 years following the introduction of the interventions, the mean cumulative sums of the net difference were similar to those values obtained from the deterministic model. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the cumulative net differences were strongly influenced by grower bird sale income, particularly under improved chick management. The effects of the strategies on odds of households selling and consuming birds after 7 months, and numbers of birds being sold or consumed after this period also influenced profitability. Cost variations for equipment used under improved chick management were not markedly associated with profitability. Net Present Values and Benefit-Cost Ratios discounted over a 10 -year period were also similar to the deterministic model when mean values obtained through stochastic modelling were used. In summary, the study showed that ND vaccination and improved chick management can improve the viability and profitability of village chicken production in Myanmar. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.

Two groups of sows were blocked according to parity and date of farrowing and allotted to three experimental treatments using a randomized complete block design. Creep feeding was initiated at d 7, 14, and 18 from birth for a duration of 13, 6, and 2 d of creep feeding. A creep diet (1, 585 kcal ME/lb, 1. 56 % TID Lys) with 1. 0 % chromium oxide was offered ad libitum until weaning (d 20) using a rotary <b>creep</b> <b>feeder</b> with hopper. A single lactation diet (1, 586 kcal ME/lb, 0. 97 % TID Lys) was used where sows were allowed free access to feed throughout lactation. Piglets were weighed individually at d 0 (birth), 7, 14, 18, and 20 to calculate total and daily gains. Daily creep feed intake per litter was recorded and calculated. Fecal samples from all piglets were taken twice per sampling day using sterile swabs at d 14, 18, and 20 for Treatment 1; at d 18 and 20 for Treatment 2; and d 20 for Treatment 3. Piglets were categorized as ‘eaters’ when fecal sample was colored green at least once on any of the sampling days. Overall, there were no differences in weaning weights (P< 0. 61), total gain (P< 0. 38), and daily gain (P< 0. 38) among pigs and litters fed creep for different durations. Total creep feed intake of litters fed creep for 13 and 6 d were greater (P< 0. 0001) than those litters provided creep feed for 2 d. There were no differences (P< 0. 69) in overall creep intake between litters fed for 13 and 6 d. Litters provided with creep feed for 13 d produced 10 % more (80 vs. 70 %; P< 0. 03) eaters than litters fed creep for both 6 and 2 d. There were no differences (P< 0. 98) in the percentage of eaters between litters fed creep for 6 and 2 d.

40|$|Graduation date: 1973 Most of the nutritionally related {{difficulties}} of winter feeding deer apparently result from either poor acceptability of artificial rations or digestive disturbances {{that result from}} feeding starved animals feeds {{to which they are}} not accustomed. Reported in this thesis are studies conducted with both captive and wild deer concerning acceptability of artificial rations and on the affects of feeding various rations to starving deer. The relative acceptability of various physical forms of grains [...] pelleted, rolled, and whole [...] and of the common commercial concentrates was determined with captive black-tailed deer. When given a choice between the three forms, the deer markedly preferred the pelleted form in each of three separate trials with corn, barley and oats. The intake of the pelleted form comprised 79. 6 percent, 77. 9 percent, and 100 percent in the barley, corn and oat trials, respectively. The rolled form was rejected in the oat trial and comprised 20. 4 percent and 22. 1 percent of the total intake in the barley and corn trials, respectively. The whole form was rejected in all three trials. Nine common commercial concentrates were offered ad libitum, cafeteria style in various combinations, to the deer in a series of trials. Consumption rates indicated that corn, wheat and soybean meal were preferred by the deer with barley and oats being selected in limited amounts. Beet pulp, cottonseed meal, linseed meal, and peas were rejected by the deer if given a choice of more preferred feedstuffs, but, if not given a choice then they would consume limited amounts of these. Two palatability studies were conducted whereby browse plants that were considered to be highly palatable to deer were fed in combination with a cereal grain considered to be of low palatability. The relative intake of the browse-grain mixture was compared to the intake of the grain alone. The browse-grain mixtures were mountain mahogany-oats and blackberry-barley. With one exception, there was uniform rejection of treatments containing browse. The deer were able to detect browse in the feedstuffs at levels of 1 percent browse. Two levels of blackberry leaves (1 and 5 percent) and 3 levels of mahogany (1, 5 and 10 percent) all resulted in marked rejection. One mule deer was used in the mahogany-oat trial and there is some indication that this deer may have preferred the mixture. All of the other data which were taken from black-tailed deer indicate that low levels of dried mountain mahogany and blackberry in oats and barley, respectively, will decrease intake. The effects of abrupt dietary changes on mule deer and black-tailed deer, following periods of malnutrition were investigated. Four separate trials were conducted. These were, (1) changing five mule deer fawns from a browse diet to alfalfa ad libitum, (2) changing one mule deer from alfalfa to a complete concentrate ration ad libitum, (3) changing one mule deer from alfalfa to a green grass diet ad libitum, and (4) changing 18 black-tailed deer and two mule deer from grass hay to high protein diets. A total of three deer died after these dietary changes, but the ensuing necropsies did not reveal conclusive evidence that would indicate that any of the deer {{died as a result of}} the ration changes. Diarrhea was prevalent in the high protein ad libitum rations. Mule deer were observed while using feeding stations in Eastern Oregon during a severe winter. Rumen contents were taken and body condition was determined by necropsy on 16 deer that died at the feeding site and from 11 live deer that were sacrificed and which had access to the feeders. The results indicated that all deer to die on the feeding site died of starvation. The ingesta from the deer had high acid detergent fiber and cellulose levels, both of which were significantly related to lowered in vitro dry matter digestibility of the rumen samples. There was a significant negative correlation between body condition and in vitro dry matter digestibility of the rumen contents. Two herds of mule deer were artificially fed during a severe winter in Eastern Oregon. Two rations were fed to the deer without causing severe digestive upset, although one of the rations, containing 45 percent soybean meal, caused the deer to develop diarrhea for a brief period. Feed cost estimations indicated that it costs 0. 07 and 0. 11 per deer-day for the two rations fed during this study. It is suggested that <b>creep</b> <b>feeders</b> may offer a method of feeding fawns separate from adults which would make more economical use of the feed.
