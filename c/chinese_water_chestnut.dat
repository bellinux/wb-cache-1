50|$|<b>Chinese</b> <b>water</b> <b>chestnut</b> {{is usually}} not very prone to pests, {{nevertheless}} some animals and fungi may attack the plant: Water fowl may damage the stems and corms, especially when plants are young. Similarly, rodents and grazing animals {{pose a threat to}} the <b>Chinese</b> <b>water</b> <b>chestnut,</b> which may be discouraged by keeping the paddy inundated. Fly larvae (Trichoptera sp.) and other leaf-eating caterpillars also feed on the stems. However, unless complete defoliation below the waterline occurs, the plants can normally tolerate this damage. Plant hoppers (Fulgoridae) and scale insects feed on plant sap and may cause subsequent death. Other pests represent nematodes Ditylenchus spp. and Dolichodorus heterocephalus. Fungal species can also attack the <b>Chinese</b> <b>water</b> <b>chestnut.</b> In warmer climates, a rust is caused by uromyces and Cylindrosporium eleocharidis is causing stem blight.|$|E
40|$|Fresh-cut <b>Chinese</b> <b>water</b> <b>chestnuts</b> (CWC) turn yellow {{after being}} peeled, {{reducing}} their shelf life and commercial value. Metabolomics, {{the systematic study}} of the full complement of small molecular metabolites, was useful for clarifying the mechanism of fresh-cut CWC etiolation and developing methods to inhibit yellowing. In this study, metabolic alterations associated with etiolation at different growth stages (0 day, 2 days, 3 days, 4 days, 5 days) from fresh-cut CWC were investigated using LC–MS and analyzed by pattern recognition methods (principal component analysis (PCA), partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), and orthogonal projection to latent structures-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA)). The metabolic pathways of the etiolation molecules were elucidated. The main metabolic pathway {{appears to be the}} conversion of phenylalanine to p-coumaroyl-CoA, followed by conversion to naringenin chalcone, to naringenin, and naringenin then following different pathways. Firstly, it can transform into apigenin and its derivatives; secondly, it can produce eriodictyol and its derivatives; and thirdly it can produce dihydrokaempferol, quercetin, and myricetin. The eriodictyol can be further transformed to luteolin, cyanidin, dihydroquercetin, dihydrotricetin, and others. This is the first reported use of metabolomics to study the metabolic pathways of the etiolation of fresh-cut CWC...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Proton T 1 NMR {{relaxation}} {{of the cell}} wall materials from <b>Chinese</b> <b>water</b> <b>chestnuts</b> (CWC) is {{an order of magnitude}} more efficient than those from potatoes, even though both the major relaxation pathways and the relative proton population of the relaxation groups are similar. This anomalous behavior of CWC {{can be explained by the}} detection of a strong ESR signal, which is an order of magnitude larger than that in samples from potatoes. The estimated free radical concentration is about 60 µM. Spectral properties of the radicals (g D 2 : 00599, linewidth 10. 75 G) are consistent with that of semiquinone radicals derived from wall-bound polyphenols in cell wall materials. Hydration led to the drastic reduction of the ESR signal; it virtually disappeared when as little as 13 % water was added to CWC in the vapor phase. Redrying over phosphorus pentoxide under vacuum followed by exposure to air resulted in some recovery of the free radical signals. Paradoxically, 1 H T 1 {{relaxation of}} a wet CWC (21 % D 2 O) showed sustained efficiency at T> 300 K. T 1 relaxation was only moderately affected by the presence of free radicals and transverse relaxation showed no effects. All the relaxation behavior could be accounted for by a spin diffusion model involving low concentration of unpaired electron spins. Copyright 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
40|$|The texture {{quality of}} canned fruits and {{vegetables}} can be severely degraded or softened due to thermal processing. Increased ferulic acid cross-linking and cell-cell adhesion {{has been associated with}} increased firmness of texture in {{fruits and vegetables}}. In order to test such a theory for maintaining firmness and cross-linkages of ferulic acid after thermal processing, vegetables were pre-treated/infused with peroxidase enzyme and ferulic acid. Carrots, beets and <b>Chinese</b> <b>water</b> <b>chestnuts</b> were chosen for their extreme differences in texture. Various methods for measuring texture were tested. Flat head compression was selected as the most sensitive method of assessing texture. Various infusion methods were tested including osmotic (marinating), vacuum and high-pressure. High-pressure was selected as the most effective method of infusion. Various high-pressure levels were tested. 20 K psi showed the highest effective enzyme activity (balance of infusion vs. enzyme degradation by high pressure) and the most promising texture improvement. ^ Sliced raw carrots and beets were high-pressure infused at 20 K psi for 10 min with 0. 05 mg/ml peroxidase enzyme with and without 0. 1 mg/ml added ferulic acid followed by vacuum infusion of 1. 5 % hydrogen peroxide for 30 min. Samples were then vacuum packaged in military tri-laminate pouches and thermally sterilized at 115. 5 °C (240 °F) for 6 min. Texture effects of various treatments were assessed and compared to relative amounts of non cross-linked esterified ferulic acid versus cross-linked ferulic acid by HPLC separation and analysis within prepared isolated plant cell walls. Texture improvements were seen in peroxidase-infused carrot and beet samples, with additional firming seen in the peroxidase/ferulic acid infused beets. The amount of cross-linked ferulic acid increased in the peroxidase infused beets. Chromatograms support a possible theory explaining the additional firming seen in the peroxidase/ferulic acid infused beets. Very little ferulic acid cross-linking was seen in the carrots. There was good correlation between cross-linked ferulic acid and improved texture for the beet. Fluorescence was used to confirm ferulic acid solution cross-linking with both peroxidase/hydrogen peroxide and laccase enzymes. A fluorescence shift was also seen in peroxidase-infused beets possibly indicating ferulic acid cross linking. ...|$|R

40|$|Background and Purpose: This {{manuscript}} {{reports on}} the rapid spread of <b>water</b> <b>chestnut</b> in a shallow dam reservoir. The <b>water</b> <b>chestnut</b> is a critically endangered plant in Poland. Materials and Methods: From 2008 to 2016 during the vegetation season we investigated the distribution of <b>water</b> <b>chestnut</b> in the Rzeszów dam reservoir. Results: The colony has grown from sparse individual plants which probably appeared around 2005, to a dense floating mat of plants with the total area of over 14 ha today. Recently <b>water</b> <b>chestnut</b> has also appeared in all shallow parts of the reservoir with weak water flow. Conclusions: Taking into consideration the dynamic expansion of the <b>water</b> <b>chestnut,</b> it can be assumed that {{in the near future}} this species may control many parts of the Rzeszów reservoir, while in others it can be displaced by reeds. It is highly probable then that the total area of <b>water</b> <b>chestnut</b> patches will decrease, rather than increase. </p...|$|R

40|$|Plant cell {{walls are}} a key {{determinant}} of the material properties of vegetable tissue following thermal processing. This study focussed upon the effects of heat on the material properties of model vegetable tissues (<b>Chinese</b> <b>water</b> <b>chestnut</b> and carrot), with particular emphasis on the rate of compression during mechanical testing. In a homogeneous system such as cooked <b>Chinese</b> <b>water</b> <b>chestnut,</b> low strain rate compression (0. 2 min(- 1)) produced buckling of the cell walls, steady fluid expression, low stiffness and fractures at high strains. However a high compressive strain rate (> 50 min(- 1)), produced a high stiffness and failure by a rapid, brittle fracture at low strain, which propagated by cell rupture causing limited, rapid fluid release. These differences in mechanical behaviour are ascribed {{to the ability of}} cellular fluid to flow through the tissue during the timescale of the compressive test. When carrot tissue was heated for short periods of time (20 min at 100 degreesC), weakening of the inter-cellular adhesion changed the failure mechanism from cell rupture to cell separation. These results show that the material properties of processed vegetable tissue depend upon, not only the previously known factor of inter-cellular adhesion and cell wall strength, but also the cell wall porosity and the ease of fluid flow.
