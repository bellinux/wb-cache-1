40|$|Alternative {{education}} programs (AEPs) have been operating {{in public schools}} for over thirty years, and there is considerable research testifying to their effectiveness. As {{a result of these}} long standing programs, the literature and research identifies criteria for exemplary alternative schools/programs. The {{purpose of this study was}} to identify the essential criteria for exemplary alternative education in public school settings via the literature and research findings, and the barriers that prevent the criteria from being fully addressed by the educational leaders of these schools/programs. ^ Multiple case study methods were employed to conduct the research. Individual interviews were the primary data collection methodology. The coding of qualitative data and other appropriate analysis techniques, including the use of QSR N 5 software, were conducted simultaneously with the data collection, interpretation, and the writing of the research report. The process of reduction and interpretation was used to identify themes, categories, and patterns from the data collected. ^ From the review of related literature and research, three essential criteria of exemplary alternative education emerged: (1) positive school climate; (2) <b>customized</b> <b>curriculum</b> and instruction; (3) personal, social and emotional growth. Sub-categories of each criterion emerged. The data was then compared to the research. From this comparison, agreements, conflicts, and gaps were identified. The strongest agreement between the data and the research related to positive school climate emphasizing the importance of a caring, demanding, and well-prepared teacher. The strongest conflict between the data and the research existed in the area of personal, social, and emotional growth and the best praxis necessary to promote and develop citizenry. The gap which raised the greatest amount of concern was evident in the <b>customized</b> <b>curriculum</b> and instruction criterion. John Kellmayer (1995 a) emphasizes Bloom 2 ̆ 7 s taxonomy in curriculum development because of a failure to emphasize higher order thinking skills. In addition, the development of affective skills is often overlooked in alternative school curricula (p. 79). This gap needs to be addressed in subsequent research of public school-based alternative education. ^ Findings, summaries, conclusions and recommendations from this study are to be made to the Rhode Island Department of Education, a major client of this research. ...|$|E

40|$|Short Abstract: Current {{research}} restores our {{awareness that}} students’ mathematical proficiency impacts their future academic success, choices of majors {{at the university}} level, career choice, and early career earnings potential (Boaler, 2015; Geiser 2 ̆ 6 Santelices, 2007; Rose 2 ̆ 6 Betts, 2004). In this discussion, Dr. Berkopes presents the Learning Commons as a methodology for scaling competency based learning and peer-to-peer academic centered interactions. Full Abstract: The teaching and learning of mathematics in the US has been a highly publicized political and economic issue {{for more than four}} decades. Despite decades of reform efforts, the US education system still predominantly provides access to mathematical content through lecture or other formal classroom activities. This first-access point for content necessitates that content be filtered through the active educator and her beliefs about mathematics, how students learn, and the goals of teaching the content (Schoenfeld, 1999). Often, this setting results in students rotely learning the product of mathematical thought, rather than the desired learning of mathematical thought (Skemp, 1987, Boaler, 2015). In this discussion, the presenter posits that in fact reforming first-access techniques is not a scalable option, but rather efforts and resources should be allocated towards a pragmatic and scalable alternative approach to mathematics (or any content) education. This alternative, define as the Learning Commons Model (Berkopes 2 ̆ 6 Abshire, 2016) has the flexibility to capitalize on interventions proven to lessen mathematics anxiety and enable a much higher level of student fluency with core curriculum. These techniques can include individualized instruction, self-efficacy development, systematic desensitization, <b>customized</b> <b>curriculum,</b> competency based-learning, and working memory enhancements (Hembree, 1990; Passolunghi, Caviola, De Agostini, Perin, 2 ̆ 6 Mammarella, 2016) ...|$|E

40|$|UnrestrictedRecent {{years have}} seen {{a large number of}} game-based {{training}} systems or serious games developed for diversified learning domains. Despite the hypothesis that computer games are motivator to promote learning engagement, however, researchers reported various problems existing in these systems. One of the intractable problems, for example, is that games incentives may direct learners to unproductive learning activities, diverging from the original intention of educational software designers. Skeptics began to question the worth of employing game techniques in training systems, as constructing a serious game faces relatively longer development cycle and consumes more expensive resources.; Do unproductive learning activities in serious games falsify the hypothesis that games can promote learning? What kind of learners can benefit from the didactics of learning by playing? What design issues should be taken into consideration in order to reduce these unproductive activities? To what extent can pedagogy harness the power of computer games and still preserve their fun elements? This thesis attempts to answer these questions through in-depth research on improving the learning productivity of serious games. Iterative exploratory studies were carried for evaluating the training results and validating the design of a particular serious game, called the Tactical Language & Culture Training System (TLCTS), which coaches adult learners to rapidly acquire spoken communication skills. Evidence of the previous study was used to establish the hypothesis for the next controlled study, which further serves as the basis of qualitative and quantitative analysis on the generic issues of low learning productivity in serious games. Based on the analysis, this thesis presents a pedagogical framework tailored for serious game applications, which incorporate <b>customized</b> <b>curriculum</b> contents, implicit and explicit feedback, game scoring, scaffolding and fading, online student assessment, performance summarization as well as tutor advice facilities. This thesis also provides implementation details of this framework as a case study.; Preliminary results on adoption of this framework indicate that it helps reduce unproductive learning activities.

40|$|Background: Quality-assured {{tuberculosis}} {{laboratory services}} {{are critical to}} achieve global and national goals for tuberculosis prevention and care. Implementation of a quality management system (QMS) in laboratories leads to improved quality of diagnostic tests and better patient care. The Strengthening Laboratory Management Toward Accreditation (SLMTA) programme has led to measurable improvements in the QMS of clinical laboratories. However, progress in tuberculosis laboratories has been slower, which {{may be attributed to}} the need for a structured tuberculosis-specific approach to implementing QMS. We describe the development and early implementation of the Strengthening Tuberculosis Laboratory Management Toward Accreditation (TB SLMTA) programme. Development: The TB SLMTA curriculum was developed by <b>customizing</b> the SLMTA <b>curriculum</b> to include specific tools, job aids and supplementary materials specific to the tuberculosis laboratory. The TB SLMTA Harmonized Checklist was developed from the World Health Organisation Regional Office for Africa Stepwise Laboratory Quality Improvement Process Towards Accreditation checklist, and incorporated tuberculosis-specific requirements from the Global Laboratory Initiative Stepwise Process Towards Tuberculosis Laboratory Accreditation online tool. Implementation: Four regional training-of-trainers workshops have been conducted since 2013. The TB SLMTA programme has been rolled out in 37 tuberculosis laboratories in 10 countries using the Workshop approach in 32 laboratories in five countries and the Facility based approach in five tuberculosis laboratories in five countries. Conclusion: Lessons learnt from early implementation of TB SLMTA suggest that a structured training and mentoring programme can build a foundation towards further quality improvement in tuberculosis laboratories. Structured mentoring, and institutionalisation of QMS into country programmes, is needed to support tuberculosis laboratories to achieve accreditation. </p...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} paper examines first-year student performance and retention within engineering. A considerable {{body of literature}} has reported factors influencing performance and retention, including high school GPA and SAT scores, 1, 2, 3 gender, 4 self-efficacy, 1, 5 social status, 2, 6, 7 hobbies, 4 and social integration. 6, 7 Although these factors can help explain and even partially predict student outcomes, they {{can be difficult to}} measure; typical survey instruments are lengthy and can be invasive of student privacy. To address this limitation, the present paper examines whether a much simpler survey can be used to understand student motivations and anticipate student outcomes. The survey was administered to 347 students in an introductory Engineering Graphics and Design course. At the beginning of the first day of class, students were given a three-question, open-ended questionnaire that asked: “In your own words, what do engineers do?”, “Why did you choose engineering?”, and “Was there any particular person or experience that influenced your decision?” Two investigators independently coded the responses, identifying dozens of codes for both motivations for pursuing engineering and understanding of what it is. Five hypotheses derived from Dweck’s mindset theory 7 and others 8, 9 were tested to determine if particular codes were predictive of first-semester GPA or first-year retention in engineering. Codes that were positively and significantly associated with first-semester GPA included: explaining why engineers do engineering or how they do it, stating that engineers create ideas, visions, and theories, stating that engineers use math, science, physics or analysis, and expressing enjoyment of math and science, whereas expressing interest in specific technical applications or suggesting that engineers simplify and make life easier were negatively and significantly related to first-semester GPA. Codes positively and significantly associated with first-year retention in engineering included: stating that engineers use math or that engineers design or test things, expressing enjoyment of math, science, or problem solving, and indicating any influential person who is an engineer. Codes negatively and significantly associated with retention included: citing an extrinsic motivation for pursuing engineering, stating that they were motivated by hearing stories about engineering, and stating that parents or family pushed the student to become an engineer. Although many prior studies have suggested that student self-efficacy is related to retention, 1, 5 this study found that student interests were more strongly associated with retention. This finding is supported by Dweck’s mindset theory: students with a “growth” mindset (e. g., “I enjoy math”) would be expected to perform better and thus be retained at a higher rate than those with a “fixed” mindset (e. g., “I am good at math”). 7 We were surprised that few students mentioned activities expressly designed to stimulate interest in engineering, such as robotics competitions and high school engineering classes. Rather, they cited general interests in math, problem solving, and creativity, as well as family influences, all factors that are challenging for the engineering education community to address. These findings demonstrate that relative to its ease of administration, a five minute survey can indeed help to anticipate student performance and retention.
