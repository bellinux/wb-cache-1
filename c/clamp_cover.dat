40|$|Valobran Kaše je bez sumnje izniman spomenik graditeljstva renesanse, vrhunska inženjerska građevina svestranog graditelja Paskoja Miličevića. Izgrađen je između 1486. i 1514. Prvi, manji, sjeverni dio izgrađen je 1486, a drugi, nešto veći, 1487. godine. Ta dva dijela su 1498. povezana, a 1514. godine su Kaše dograđene prema sjeveru. Prilikom gradnje primijenjene su, u renesansi ponovo otkrivene, antičke tehnike gradnje. Valobran je izgrađen u suhom doku, a ne u kesonu, kako se dosad smatralo. Suhi dok izrađen je kao drvena kutija čije se dno sastojalo od dva sloja greda, dok su bočne stranice bile oplaćene jednim slojem greda. Suhi dok je potopljen na mjestu gradnje, a potom je isušen. Valobran je izveden kao zidana konstrukcija, čija je vanjska oplata zidana masivnim kamenim blokovima spojenim metalnim sponama i trnovima zalivenim u olovo. Sredina valobrana bila je “betonirana” mortom od vapna i crvenice s dodacima lomljenog kamena.

These constructions, whose dimensions are approximately 50 meters length, 40 meters height and variable depth of 4 to 5 meters, are spatial modular structures composed of steel tubular elements connected by <b>clamps</b> and <b>covered</b> by wood boards. The consideration or not of the eccentricities introduced by the connection element as well as the determination of the stiffness to consider {{is one of the major}} problems when developing the analysis model. The construction company aims to achieve their optimization in order to reduce the final cost. This paper investigates about how different ways of modeling these connections affects the optimization of the final model. The extent to which the modification of the position of the eccentricities influences the optimization is also discussed, as this aspect is difficult to control on site...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDamping {{using an}} {{instability}} of a fluid film {{in contact with}} a vibrating structure is investigated. Waves induced in the fluid film {{are the source of}} the added damping. A model based on the theory of Faraday instability is applied to a <b>clamped</b> circular plate <b>covered</b> by a fluid film. It is shown that this original technique can provide a significant damping, as with viscoelastic or porous material treatments. It is related to the amplitude of the waves which is a non linear function of the plate acceleration. Theoretical and experimental results are compared. The model overestimates the added damping: it is four times greater than the measured one...|$|R
40|$|DE 10000132 A UPAB: 20011018 NOVELTY - The {{surface of}} an {{elastomer}} material is treated with an energy stream, which acts {{on the surface}} while the material is stretched. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The workpiece is a flat membrane (1), and the energy stream is directed at least {{at one of the}} two sides. The energy {{is in the form of}} an ion or electromagnetic radiation, aligned at the surface of the stretched workpiece. The energy is generated together with a plasma which forms the ions. The workpiece material is <b>clamped</b> to <b>cover</b> a hollow zone on one side, where an overpressure stretches it. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for an elastomer membrane workpiece, where the macro mols. have a high cross linking level and especially in the zones near the surface. USE - The membrane is for use in pressure stores or hydraulic systems. ADVANTAGE - The process gives a targeted increase in the cross linking of macro mols. within the elastomer material, at least in the layers close to the surface. It gives a targeted reduction in the permeation of gases through the elastomer membrane...|$|R

The structural property of the very light plate with high bending stiffness is very crucial element in such plate silencer. In this study, an approach to fabricate new reinforced composite panel with light weight and high bending stiffness is developed in order to realize the function of this plate silencer practically. The performance of two plate silencer with the stopband from 229 to 618 Hz in which the transmission loss is higher than 10 dB over the whole frequency band can be achieved. ...|$|R

A figure-eight can be made around the brake lever <b>clamp</b> to completely <b>cover</b> the bar, or a small, separate piece of tape can be place on the back side to cover the small v-shaped section that might otherwise be left bare. Strips of bar gel may optionally be applied to the handebars prior to applying the tape in order to reduce vibration transmission and increase comfort.|$|R

2500|$|In 1864, Meucci {{claimed to}} have made what he felt was his best device, using an iron {{diaphragm}} with optimized thickness and tightly clamped along its rim.

30|$|There {{are several}} {{treatment}} options {{that should be}} considered for the emergency haemostasis of pelvic fractures, such as: the pelvic sling, arterial inflow arrest, external fixation devices, internal fixation, direct surgical haemostasis, pelvic packing, pelvic angiography and embolization. Only external devices that can be easily applied can be used effectively [11, 12, 17, 21, 24, 28, 31, 37]. These devices create a tamponade effect against ongoing bleeding by reducing the intrapelvic volume and also restore stability, bone contact and favour blood clotting. Should the bleeding continue despite the application of the external fixator, then pelvic packing should be considered, as should tamponade of the areas, or temporary aortic compression, in the presence of multiple massive bleeding points. Complex abdominal procedures should be avoided in the presence of pelvic haemorrhage [2, 9]. A major spleen rupture usually necessitates splenectomy. In liver injuries, attention is paid only to major vessels and hepatic tamponade is applied [19]. Bowel injuries are <b>clamped</b> and <b>covered,</b> leaving definitive treatment until such times as the haemodynamic situation has been stabilized. As angiographic embolization is both time consuming and inhibitive to dynamic assessment and further treatment, it is not usually indicated in this population. However, in cases where haemodynamic stability with volume replacement can be achieved, but ongoing pelvic haemorrhage is suspected (expanding haematoma), it is a good practise to add angiography to the treatment protocol [9]. The management of the pelvic fracture should be conceived as part of the resuscitative effort. Immediate external fixation of the unstable pelvis with pelvic packing to control pelvic haemorrhage is a practical approach in both the borderline and “in extremis” patient. Angiographic embolization can be recommended in more stable patients. Any benefits of immediate fracture stabilization are obtained at an early stage i.e. a reduction in blood loss and, therefore the need for transfusion/s and/or a reduced risk of developing systemic complications.|$|R

50|$|William A Irvin {{could carry}} up to 14,000 tons of iron ore {{in either the}} {{processed}} taconite form, or the raw iron ore straight from the mines. About 90% of what she carried was taconite, although she did switch to coal and limestone for periods of time. William A Irvin was equipped to carry grain, although she never did due to {{the problems associated with}} switching cargoes from taconite to grain. All cargo was loaded and unloaded through the top of the ship, through the 18 hatches on deck. All hatches were covered with large one-piece steel hatch covers, which weighed 5.5 tons per cover. After all the covers were lifted off and placed aside using the hatch crane, the cargo could be dumped {{to the bottom of the}} three holds, which would normally take 3-4 hours to complete. Unloading used Hulett cranes: cranes whose necks reach down to the bottom of the holds and grab 10-15 tons per bite, much like a large playground crane. After all the cargo was either in or out of the holds, the hatch covers would be replaced and clamped down using the dog-ear or butterfly <b>clamps.</b> Although the <b>covers</b> needed a crane to move them, they would need to be secured to ensure that they would not be dislodged by waves washing the decks during storms.|$|R
