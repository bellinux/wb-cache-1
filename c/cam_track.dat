50|$|The gun is an air-cooled, recoil-operated design, firing {{standard}} 7.92Ã—57mm Mauser ammunition, fed from {{a slightly}} curved 30-round magazine {{inserted in the}} left side of the weapon. It uses a locking ring, which is located at the end of the barrel extension, to lock the bolt. Inside the locking ring, there are six sets of locking lugs, arranged as an interrupted thread, which mate with lugs cut at the rear of the bolt. Rotation of the ring, which locks and unlocks the bolt, is controlled by rollers mounted on the outside of the ring. Upon recoil, these rollers follow <b>cam</b> <b>tracks</b> cut into the receiver. The gun is of relatively simple design, with most parts having a round cross-section. The tubular receiver is an extension of the barrel jacket. The butt hosts a tube which contains the return spring and its guide.|$|R

5000|$|The {{first version}} of the 1921 Michel engine, an unusual opposed-piston cam engine, used the {{principle}} of a rotary engine, in that its [...] "cylinder block" [...] rotated. This was soon replaced by a version with the same cylinders and cam, but with stationary cylinders and the <b>cam</b> <b>track</b> rotating {{in lieu of a}} crankshaft. A later version abandoned the cam altogether and used three coupled crankshafts.|$|E
50|$|The <b>cam</b> <b>track</b> is not {{a regular}} helix but varies in pitch angle and depth. The {{variation}} in steering ratio between straight ahead and full lock results from the variance in pitch angle of the track. The more the steering wheel is turned, the lower the steering ratio becomes. In the Rover P5B, for example, {{the ratio of the}} power steering unit was 16:1 at the straight ahead and 11.3:1 at full lock.|$|E
5000|$|The pulley/cam {{system also}} confers a benefit called [...] "let-off". As the string is drawn back, the pulleys rotate. The pulleys are {{eccentric}} rather than round, and so their effective radius changes as they rotate. The pulleys feature two cam tracks. An inner <b>cam</b> <b>track</b> which connects mechanically to the limbs or opposite cam and an outer <b>cam</b> <b>track</b> which the bowstring runs through. As the bow is drawn {{the ratio of}} bowstring pay-out and bowstring take-up relative to limb-weight and leverage of the cams changes. By manipulation of the shapes of these cam tracks, different draw-stroke profiles can be created. A compound bow can be soft-drawing with a slow build-up to peak weight and a gradual let-off with a long [...] "valley" [...] at the end. It can also be hard-drawing with a very fast build-up to peak draw-weight, a long plateau where weight is maintained, and a quick let-off with a short valley. The let-off itself {{is the result of}} the cam profiles having passed center and approaching a condition very similar to a cam-lock. In fact some compound bows, if the draw-stops or draw-length modules are removed, will self-lock at full draw and require professional equipment to unlock safely.|$|E
5000|$|As the {{assembly}} of bolt, barrel and barrel extension recoiled {{to the rear of}} the gun upon firing, the locking block was drawn out of engagement by a cam in the bottom of the gun's receiver. The recoiling barrel extension struck the [...] "accelerator" [...] assembly, a half-moon shaped spring-loaded piece of metal pivoting from the receiver below the bolt and behind the barrel extension. The tips of the accelerator's two curving fingers engaged the bottom of the bolt and caused it to move rapidly to the rear. The extractor-ejector was a mechanism that pivoted over the front of the bolt, with a claw that gripped the base of the next round in the belt. A <b>camming</b> <b>track</b> in the left side of the receiver caused this to move down as the bolt moved back, lowering the next round down on top of the fired case, pushing it straight down out of the extraction grooves of the bolt face through the ejection port. A spring in the feed tray cover pushed the extractor-ejector down onto the next round, so if the feed tray cover was opened, the extractor-ejector would be pulled upwards if the belt needed to be removed.|$|R

50|$|When {{creating}} a zigzag stitch, the back-and-forth {{motion of the}} sewing machine's needle is controlled by a cam. As the cam rotates, a fingerlike follower, connected to the needle bar, rides along the <b>cam</b> and <b>tracks</b> its indentations. As the follower moves in and out, the needle bar is moved from side to side. Very old sewing machines lack this hardware and so cannot natively produce a zigzag stitch, but there are often shank-driven attachments available which enable them to do so.|$|R
50|$|The CZ 75 {{is a short}} recoil operated, locked breech pistol. It {{uses the}} Browning linkless cam locking system {{similar to that used}} in the Browning Hi-Power pistol, where the barrel and slide are locked {{together}} on firing, using locking lugs milled into the barrel mating with recesses in the roof of the slide. An enclosed <b>cam</b> <b>track</b> integral with the barrel is actuated by the slide release lever's transverse pin. After the first few millimetres of the recoil stroke, the barrel is cammed downwards at the rear, enabling the slide to continue the recoil stroke and eject the spent cartridge.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first version}} of this engine, as {{described}} in the initial patent, was a rotary engine: the 'crank' (in this case the cam ring) remained fixed and the cylinders revolved around it. [...] This type of engine (although as spark-ignition petrol engines, not diesels) had developed before World War I as an aircraft engine, its advantage being improved cooling for the cylinders as they rotated through a stream of cooling air. A disadvantage of the rotary engine was the increased rotating mass, although in the Michel case, the <b>cam</b> <b>track</b> was itself of considerable mass and so the significance was less than it had been for the aircraft engine.|$|E

50|$|The M82 is a short-recoil {{semi-automatic}} firearm. When {{the gun is}} fired, {{the barrel}} initially recoils for a short distance (about 1 in), while being securely locked by the rotating bolt. After the short travel lower part of acclerater arm held by receiver upper part is already hinged in bolt carrier and the middle portion strikes {{it back to the}} barrel by a rod place in bolt carrier transferring part of the recoil energy of the barrel to the bolt to achieve reliable cycling and unlock it from barrel.The bolt is unlocked by turning in the curved <b>cam</b> <b>track</b> in the bolt carrier.Then, the barrel is stopped By the combined effect of the accelerater, buffer spring and the muzzle braker and the bolt continues back, to extract and eject a spent case. On its return stroke, the bolt strips the fresh cartridge from the box magazine and feeds it into the chamber and finally locks itself to the barrel. The striker is also cocked on the return stroke of the bolt. The gun is fed from a large, detachable box magazine holding up to 10 rounds, although a rare 12-round magazine was developed for use during Operation Desert Storm in 1991.|$|E
50|$|The Stoner 63 {{series of}} weapons are gas-operated, air-cooled, belt or magazine-fed and in rifle and carbine configuration, fire from a closed bolt to ensure maximum accuracy, or in machine gun mode, {{fire from the}} open bolt {{position}} to prevent cook-offs and enhance cooling. The weapon has a rotary bolt locking mechanism with 7 radially symmetrical locking lugs that engage a series of recesses in the barrel extension, and is actuated by a conventional long-stroke piston. The radial arrangement of locking lugs distributes the firing load evenly around the bolt head and barrel socket, reducing stress and increasing the longevity of these critical components. Attached to the piston extension is the bolt carrier which {{is equipped with a}} curved <b>cam</b> <b>track</b> that guides the bolt's cam pin (retained by the firing pin) and rotates the bolt 22.5Â° during the movement of the piston to either lock or unlock the bolt from behind the abutments in the barrel socket. Incorporated into the bolt carrier/piston group is an anti-bounce device, consisting of a 4 in carbide rod that rides within the piston extensionâ€™s hollow interior and moves back and forth during the recoil and counter-recoil cycles, reducing bolt bounce and preventing the possibility of firing out of battery during closed bolt firing (in the Rifle/Carbine models).|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. The {{objective}} ofthis {{project is}} to create a walking robot employing a cam controlled leg. The cam controlled walker was first theorized in the Master's Thesis of Xiaonan Wan of Northern Illinois University. The principle of a cam controlled is to combine the advantages of both wheels and legs into one manipulator. The robot is constructed 'of a body with four motor driven walking pods. Each pod consisted of three cam-controlled members. The robot is capable of walking in a smooth, strait and level line, when it is activated. The robot is designed to be less than 69 centimeters and less than 2 kg in mass. The basic pod design involves a rotating slider and a <b>cam</b> shaped <b>track,</b> which causes a rotating member to have an end path that is a level strait line. This design is advantageous because it allows for the level motion of a wheel and the small footprint and rough terrain navigation ability of a leg. Analysis of motion shows that the robot does not move at constant speed. This creates a dynamic loading problem along with a dynamic control problem. The robot is built to be structurally sound and stable under the dynamic conditions. In order to conserve weight a light motors were used in conjunction with gearboxes. The robot showed it was physically capable of moving but it has problems power issues. B. S. (Bachelor of Science...|$|R

50|$|Tablet presses, {{also called}} {{tableting}} machines, range from small, inexpensive bench-top models that make one tablet {{at a time}} (single-station presses), with only around a half-ton pressure, to large, computerized, industrial models (multi-station rotary presses) that can make hundreds of thousands to millions of tablets an hour with much greater pressure. The tablet press is an essential piece of machinery for any pharmaceutical and nutraceutical manufacturer. Common manufacturers of tablet presses include Natoli, Stokes, Fette Compacting, Korsch, Kikusui, Manesty, B&D, PTK, IMA and Courtoy. Tablet presses must allow the operator to adjust {{the position of the}} lower and upper punches accurately, so that the tablet weight, thickness and density can each be controlled. This is achieved using a series of <b>cams,</b> rollers, and/or <b>tracks</b> that act on the tablet tooling (punches). Mechanical systems are also incorporated for die filling, and for ejecting and removing the tablets from the press after compression. Pharmaceutical tablet presses are required to be easy to clean and quick to reconfigure with different tooling, because they are usually used to manufacture many different products.There are 2 main standards of tablet tooling used in pharmaceutical industry: American standard â€˜TSMâ€™ and European standard â€˜EUâ€™. TSM and EU configurations are similar to each other but cannot be interchanged.|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, a {{vast amount}} of content is {{available}} to, and can be created by anyone, anywhere. To make this content available, search services make use of the content itself, the context in which content is used or metadata that describes what the content is about and how to locate, retrieve and use the content. Based on metadata, content can be organised and searched for more efficiently. Repositories are databases that store metadata and potentially content. Compared to search engines, repositories typically provide features for content management, as well as copyright and access management. The repository and its metadata can be tailored to support specific application needs. In this thesis, we have researched the use of metadata in two different domains that typically apply repositories: music information retrieval (MIR) and technology-enhanced (human) learning (TEL). Metadata needs to be created and added to the content. For repositories, this process is still often done manually. Because this is expensive and does not scale, we have investigated how metadata creation can be automated by using web-based techniques - i. e. by using mashups. Mashups are web applications that combine content, presentation or functionality of web sources to create new useful applications or services. Two MIR case studies investigated how music metadata fields can be created automatically using mashups. First, we researched the use of data mashups to determine the country of origin of an artist. The approach intelligently combines location data from three data sources based on the accuracy of each data source. The method performs well, but one downside of our approach is that it cannot determine the origin for artists who are not described in the data sources. To our knowledge, this research is the first attempt to generate the country of origin of an artist. The second case study investigates how search engines {{can be used as a}} general metadata generation solution. An existing method was used that is based on the distribution of the search result counts over artist queries with changing metadata values (e. g. for musical genre by comparing search results counts of "madonna rock" and "madonna jazz"). We re-evaluated the approach for musical genre with multiple search engines and identified situations where the approach under-performs. Although the approach does not outperform other generators for musical genre, the method offers perspectives for automatically generating a variety of metadata fields. This technique is also a mashup, because search engines already aggregate data from different sources. Typically, metadata is used extensively for search and recommendation applications. These applications often rely on a specific metadata standard that enables a common understanding to support exchange and interoperability. These standards and schemas describe content in different ways, granularity levels and application purposes. To guide the selection of a suitable schema for a specific application, we have elaborated a framework that defines clusters of semantically related metadata fields as well as application domains for metadata schemas. This framework can be used to compare the expressiveness and richness of a metadata schema. More specifically, our survey can guide the selection of a metadata schema suitable for application requirements. In a next step, we researched how content in a variety of repositories and described according to a metadata standard, can be made available through a single search service. This is called federated search and works as follows: a query is sent to each repository, the received results of each repository are aggregated, the metadata standards of each repository are mapped to the metadata format used by the federated search service, and the aggregated search results are presented to the user. In TEL, we evaluated the usability and usefulness of this approach to provide student access to a variety of learning material in three different real-world settings. Most users would benefit from a federated search solution, but the search speed could be improved. In addition, we researched how recommendations can enhance these search results with both explicit (e. g. rating) and implicit relevance indicators that are extracted from interaction data of users with content (e. g. downloads, reads, etc.). Such 'attention metadata' describe not content as such, but what people do with it. The use of these data was researched for two purposes: first, for personalisation and recommendation functionality as explained above and second to provide awareness and to enable self-reflection for learners and teachers. More specifically, we researched (i) how information visualisation techniques can be used to support this process and (ii) whether it is useful to create awareness and provide self-reflection to teachers and learners. Results from evaluations in four real-world settings, indicate that the provided visualisations are useful to teachers and students to assist with improving awareness. This research contributed to the momentum of the emerging research field of learning analytics.
