5000|$|The drug—usually (but not always) in {{a powder}} or crystal form—is {{dissolved}} in water, normally in a spoon, tin, bottle cap, {{the bottom of}} a soda can, or another metal container. Cylindrical metal containers—sometimes called [...] "cookers"—are provided by needle exchange programs. Users draw the required amount of water into a syringe and squirt this over the drugs. The solution is then mixed and heated from below if necessary. Heating is used mainly with heroin (though not always, {{depending on the type of}} heroin), but is also often used with other drugs, especially crushed tablets. Cocaine HCl (powdered cocaine) dissolves quite easily without heat. Heroin prepared for the European market is insoluble in water and usually requires the addition of an acid such as citric acid or ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) powder to dissolve the drug. Due to the dangers from using lemon juice or vinegar to acidify the solution, packets of citric acid and Vitamin C powder are available at needle exchanges in Europe. In the U.S., vinegar and lemon juice are used to shoot crack cocaine. The acids convert the water-insoluble cocaine base in crack to a cocaine salt (cocaine acetate or <b>cocaine</b> <b>citrate),</b> which is water-soluble (like cocaine hydrochloride).|$|E
5000|$|Another risk is drug interactions. Some club {{drug users}} take {{multiple}} drugs {{at the same}} time. [...] "Club drugs often are taken together, with alcohol, or with other drugs to enhance their effect." [...] Drug interactions can cause hazardous side effects. When club drug users are in a liquor-licensed nightclub, users may mix pills or powders (MDMA, 2C-B, GHB, ketamine) with consumption of alcoholic drinks such as beer, wine or hard liquor. Some depressants, such as Rohypnol, are dangerous to take while drinking alcohol. [...] "Ketamine often is taken in “trail mixes” of methamphetamine, phencyclidine, <b>cocaine,</b> sildenafil <b>citrate</b> (Viagra), morphine or heroin." ...|$|R
