Chiral separation techniques may be employed to help distinguish the source of the drug, whether prescription amphetamine, prescription amphetamine prodrugs, (e.g., selegiline), over-the-counter drug products that contain levomethamphetamine, or illicitly obtained substituted amphetamines. Several prescription drugs produce amphetamine as a metabolite, including benzphetamine, <b>clobenzorex,</b> famprofazone, fenproporex, lisdexamfetamine, mesocarb, methamphetamine, prenylamine, and selegiline, among others. These compounds may produce positive results for amphetamine on drug tests. Amphetamine is generally only detectable by a standard drug test for approximately 24hours, although a high dose may be detectable for days.|$|E

40|$|Abstract I <b>Clobenzorex</b> (Asenlix) is an {{anorectic}} drug used {{as part of}} a weight-management program. The drug is metabolized by the body to amphetamine, which is then excreted in the urine, thus causing difficulty in interpretation of amphetamine-positive drug tests. Previous {{studies have shown that the}} parent drug and several metabolites are xcreted in urine. <b>Clobenzorex</b> itself has been detected for as long as 29 h following administration f a single dose. However, the parent drug was not always detected in samples that contained amphetamine at _> 500 ng/mL, the administrative cutoff for a positive result. Consequently, the parent compound <b>clobenzorex</b> is not ideal for ascertaining whether the drug was the origin of the amphetamine. Several metabolites of <b>clobenzorex</b> have been shown to be detected for a longer period of time than the parent. One of these, a hydroxy metabolite, was shown to b...|$|E
40|$|Abstract J The {{interpretation}} of urine drug-testing results can have important forensic and legal implications. I particular, {{drugs that are}} metabolized to amphetamine or methamphetamine or both pose significant concerns. In this study, <b>clobenzorex,</b> an anorectic drug that is metabolized to d-amphetamine, was administered to five subjects. Each subject took 30 mg daily for seven days, and individual urine samples were collected ad lib for 14 days beginning {{on the first day}} the drug was administered. Urine pH, specific gravity, and creatinine values were determined for each sample. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to determine the excretion profile of amphetamine and <b>clobenzorex</b> using a standard procedure for amphetamines with additional monitoring of ions at m/z 118, 125, and 364 for the detection of <b>clobenzorex.</b> Peak concentrations of amphetamin...|$|E
40|$|<b>Clobenzorex</b> is an anorexigenic {{drug that}} {{is widely used}} in Mexicofor the {{treatment}} of obesity, since it helps to reduce body weight. This drug is available as immediate release capsules. To improve compliance to treatment, it was devel oped a new slow release formulation. In order to establish its usefulness, oral pharmacokinetics and weight reduction of slow release and immediate release formulations of <b>clobenzorex</b> in obese patients were compared. Sixty patients with a BMI higher than 27 kg/m 2 {{were included in the}} study. Two groups of 30 patients were formed, one of them received 30 mg immediate release formulation b. i. d. and the other group received one 60 mg slow release formulation once a day, since under this scheme these formulations are prescribed. Blood samples were obtained at selected times during the first day and once weekly during 4 weeks. After the last dose, samples were obtained at selected times during 48 h. Plasma levels were determined by HPLC-MS/MS and pharmacokinetic parameters were obtained. Reduction in C max due to increased t max, as well as, increased half-life were observed with the slow release formulation in comparison with immediate release formulation. Although lower plasma levels of <b>clobenzorex</b> were reached with the slow release for mulation, reduction of body weight was similar with both products. Based on the results, it was concluded that slow re lease formulation of <b>clobenzorex</b> is an adequate formulation of <b>clobenzorex,</b> since pharmacokinetics and effects ob served are compatible with a once a day administration. </span...|$|E
40|$|To the Editor: <b>Clobenzorex</b> hydrochlorate, {{supplied}} {{under the}} trade name Asenlix, is an anoretic drug {{that is being}} prescribed in Mexico. The Mexican Physicians ' Desk Reference (1) describes this drug as especially useful in patients that have diabetes, cardiac impairments, hypertension, anxiety, hyperactivity, and psychiatric illnesses. They attribute this to a low degree of central nervous ystem activity and "physical excitation". Our interest in this drug was prompted by multiple incidences of amphetamine-positive drug screens in which the client called back and reported that the employees were taking Asenlix that was prescribed for them by their doctors in Mexico. Looking at the structure, it is plausible that amphetamine is a metabolite of <b>clobenzorex</b> (Figure 1). To prove this metabolic pathway, we obtained acapsule of Asenlix containing 30 mg of <b>clobenzorex</b> hydrochlorate. A drug-free volunteer took this as a single dose. Urine specimens were collected at 1, 3, 4. 5, and 7 hours post-ingestion. These were analyzed for amphetamine by GC/MS after an initial screen by TDx. The specimens obtained at 3, 4. 5, and 7 Q- 13 Figure 1. Structure of <b>clobenzorex</b> hydrochlorate. hours all screened greater than the cutoff (1 lag/re_L) on the TDx.

40|$|<b>Clobenzorex</b> is a {{metabolic}} {{precursor of}} amphetamine indicated {{for the treatment}} of obesity. Amphetamines have been involved with cardiovascular side effects such as hypertension and pulmonary arterial hypertension. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate whether the direct application of 10 – 9 – 10 – 5 M <b>clobenzorex</b> on isolated phenylephrine-precontracted rat aortic rings produces vascular effects, and if so, what mechanisms may be involved. <b>Clobenzorex</b> produced an immediate concentration-dependent vasorelaxant effect at the higher concentrations (10 – 7. 5 – 10 – 5 M). The present outcome was not modified by 10 – 6 M atropine (an antagonist of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors), 3. 1 × 10 – 7 M glibenclamide (an ATP-sensitive K+ channel blocker), 10 – 3 M 4 -aminopyridine (4 -AP; a voltage-activated K+ channel blocker), 10 – 5 M indomethacin (a prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor), 10 – 5 M clotrimazole (a cytochrome P 450 inhibitor) or 10 – 5 M cycloheximide (a general protein synthesis inhibitor). Contrarily, the clobenzorex-induced vasorelaxation was significantly attenuated (P< 0. 05) by 10 – 5 M L-NAME (a direct inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase), 10 – 7 M ODQ (an inhibitor of nitric oxide-sensitive guanylyl cyclase), 10 – 6 M KT 5823 (an inhibitor of protein kinase G), 10 – 2 M TEA (a Ca 2 +-activated K+ channel blocker and non-specific voltage-activated K+ channel blocker) and 10 – 7 M apamin plus 10 – 7 M charybdotoxin (blockers of small- and large-conductance Ca 2 +-activated K+ channels, respectively), and was blocked by 8 × 10 – 2 M potassium (a high concentration) and removal of the vascular endothelium. These results suggest that the direct vasorelaxant effect by <b>clobenzorex</b> on phenylephrine-precontracted rat aortic rings involved stimulation of the NO/cGMP/PKG/Ca 2 +-activated K+ channel pathway...|$|E
