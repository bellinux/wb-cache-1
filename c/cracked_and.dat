5|$|A {{survey in}} 1932 {{found that the}} roof was <b>cracked</b> <b>and</b> it {{eventually}} collapsed in 1935. In 1936 the roof structure was straightened, preserving the medieval trusses where possible, and covered with clay tiles. The restoration was undertaken by the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings, with the work being funded by Roger Clark of the local shoemakers C. & J. Clark who bought the derelict barn for £5. It has been owned by the National Trust since 1938. Designation as a Grade I listed building first took place in 1961. A survey in 2002 found minor repairs were needed to the doors and wall plate.|$|E

Smyrna failed to honor Aphrodite, incurring {{the wrath of the}} goddess, by whom was made {{to fall in love with}} her father; and with the aid of her nurse she deceived him for twelve nights until her identity was discovered. Smyrna fled, but her father later caught up with her. Smyrna then prayed that the gods would make her invisible, prompting them to turn her into a tree, which was named the Smyrna. Ten months later the tree <b>cracked</b> <b>and</b> Adonis was born from it.|$|E

The major problem with asphalt concrete resurfacing is the reflective cracking from underlying <b>cracks</b> <b>and</b> joints in the portland cement concrete (PCC) pavement. <b>Cracking</b> <b>and</b> seating the PCC prior to an asphalt overlay was the construction method evaluated in this project.

Though the intent was to provide usable space in the basement, it was rarely used.|$|E

30|$|The {{overlying}} {{fine silt}} contains <b>cracks</b> <b>and</b> wedges filled with black mud derived from above. These can {{be recognized as}} open <b>cracks</b> <b>and</b> wedges. Some <b>cracks</b> <b>and</b> wedges were observed in a sandy interval (Fig.  4). Montenat et al. (2007) summarized the characteristics of thixotropic wedges that are developed in coarse-grained layers and {{are similar to the}} <b>cracks</b> <b>and</b> wedges in this case. Such wedges are attributed to the limited and periodical occurrence of liquefaction and subsequent sediment collapse (Montenat et al., 2007). However, Montenat et al. (2007) suggested that the <b>cracks</b> <b>and</b> wedges should be discriminated from those of cryogenic origin in order to specify the seismic origin. In this case, the Kathmandu Valley was located in subtropical and temperate climate zones and the presence of ice wedges is not realistic (cf. Gayer et al. 2006).|$|R

5|$|A log {{portion of}} the {{original}} Oklahoma Row was moved north and now sits {{on the east side}} of Highway 94 in Monte Ne. It is used for storage. The three-story concrete-and-stone tower still stands and remains above water on the edge of Beaver Lake. This section is often incorrectly referred to as the bank building and the honeymoon suite. Monte Ne was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978 because of the historic significance of being so closely associated with Harvey and its unique architecture and engineering. Despite this, what is left of Monte Ne has fallen victim to severe neglect and vandalism. It is covered with spray paint and graffiti, as well as being <b>cracked</b> <b>and</b> full of debris. In 2011 the fire department was called to help a person who had climbed to the top floor and gotten stuck in the chimney. Because of this incident and the general state of the remains, the Army Corps of Engineers erected a temporary barbed wire fence around the tower.|$|E
5|$|Assembly of a Fat Man {{unit was}} a complex {{operation}} involving personnel from the HE-ME, Pit, Fusing and Firing teams. To prevent the assembly building from becoming overcrowded and thereby causing an accident, Parsons limited the numbers allowed inside at any time.

The first Fat Man assembly, known as F13, was assembled by 31 July, and expended in a drop test the next day. This was followed by F18 on 4 August, which was dropped the next day. Three sets of Fat Man high explosive pre-assemblies, designated F31, F32, and F33, arrived on a B-29 of the 509th Composite Group and 216th Army Air Forces Base Unit on 2 August. On inspection, the high explosive blocks of F32 {{were found to be}} badly <b>cracked</b> <b>and</b> unserviceable. The other two were assembled, with F33 earmarked for a rehearsal and F31 for operational use.|$|E

5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1997, a storm blew out the main two-story window {{at the front of}} the building, and the window's wooden frame was rotten, <b>cracked</b> <b>and</b> could not be saved. The window {{remained}} unrepaired, which left the sanctuary open to the elements for a month before the congregation, down to approximately 100 members, asked for assistance. The congregants had, by then, long held services in a smaller room, using the sanctuary only on the High Holidays. The New York Landmarks Conservancy's Endangered Buildings fund gave $2,500 for a temporary metal window, and assisted in getting approval from the Landmarks Preservation Commission for the work required to repair the damage, but the congregation did not have the $10,000 required to pay for it. Beth Hamedrash Hagodol received an additional $2,000 from the New York Landmarks Conservancy's Sacred Sites program in 1998 for a conditions survey. In 1999 a second application for National Historical designation was made, this time successful; the building was deemed significant at the local level, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 30.|$|E

The Illinois Freedom Bell is rung during the annual Let Freedom Ring festival, and it can be found beneath a gazebo on the village square. The bell has been credited with starting an Independence Day bell-ringing tradition across the United States. The bell was designated the official Illinois Freedom Bell in 1971.|$|E

40|$|The {{formation}} {{mechanisms for}} layer interface-parallel discontinuities and {{their interactions with}} vertical cracks in layered rocks with varying layer thickness are investigated. The interface behaviour between rock layers is modeled by a shear displacement response <b>and</b> rock <b>crack</b> behaviour is described by a damage model. Three typical failures can be captured: (1) vertical <b>cracking,</b> (2) delamination <b>and</b> (3) interface-parallel <b>cracking.</b> The result further indicates these crack modes are determined by a threshold of the interfacial strength. When the interfacial strength {{is higher than the}} threshold, a combined pattern of vertical <b>cracking</b> <b>and</b> interface-parallel <b>cracking</b> occurs. If the strength is lower than the threshold, a combined pattern of vertical <b>cracking</b> <b>and</b> interfacial delamination can be found. If the strength for the interface is near the threshold, a combined pattern of interface-parallel <b>cracking,</b> vertical <b>cracking</b> <b>and</b> interfacial delamination occurs. The result shows the interface-parallel discontinuities are induced by interface-delamination, interface-parallel cracks, or their coupling behaviour. Both interfacial delamination <b>and</b> interface-parallel <b>cracking</b> can reduce the tensile stress between two adjacent <b>cracks</b> <b>and</b> thus lead to a saturation state. Layer thickness variations can further influence the infilling process of vertical <b>cracks</b> <b>and</b> the <b>crack</b> spacing to average layer thickness ratios...|$|R
