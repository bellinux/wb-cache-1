5|$|By 1980, the USACE {{was working}} to obtain funding, {{which was the}} major {{obstacle}} for completion; public concerns about the project were {{that it was not}} needed and would be too costly. The USACE announced in 1981 that an environmental impact report was necessary before the project could begin, following the Endangered Species Act of 1973; the least tern and light-footed <b>clapper</b> <b>rail</b> were considered endangered, and construction would have affected their habitat. The next year, the environmental impact report process began, funded by the USACE.|$|E
5|$|The Bay Area {{is home to}} {{a diverse}} array of {{wildlife}} and, along with the connected San Joaquin River Delta represents one of California's most important ecological habitats. California's Dungeness crab, Pacific halibut, and the California scorpionfish are all significant components of the bay's fisheries. The bay's salt marshes now represent most of California's remaining salt marsh and support a number of endangered species and provide key ecosystem services such as filtering pollutants and sediments from the rivers. Most famously, the bay is a key link in the Pacific Flyway and with millions of shorebirds annually visiting the bay shallows as a refuge, is the most important component of the flyway south of Alaska. Many endangered species of birds are also found here: the California least tern, the California <b>clapper</b> <b>rail,</b> the snowy egret, and the black crowned night heron.|$|E
25|$|The {{area around}} the bridge is an {{important}} ecological area, hosting many species of birds, fish and mammals. The endangered species California <b>clapper</b> <b>rail</b> {{is known to be}} present in the western bridge terminus area.|$|E
50|$|The regular {{flooding}} {{from the}} tide influences {{the distribution of}} salt marsh plants. These salt marshes can be found {{to the west of}} the barrier islands. They are home to black ducks, <b>clapper</b> <b>rails,</b> and other species.|$|R
50|$|Coastal {{salt marsh}} habitat, {{situated}} above mudflats, contains salt tolerant vegetation. It is the predominant habitat in the refuge with 565-acre land occupied. It is a nesting, feeding and cover area for bird and fish including the endangered light-footed <b>clapper</b> <b>rails</b> and Belding’s Savannah sparrow.|$|R
50|$|Magothy Bay Natural Area Preserve is a 286 acre Natural Area Preserve {{located in}} Northampton County, Virginia. The {{preserve}} encompasses woodlands, wetlands, and salt marshes, providing foraging areas for various species of waterfowl, shorebirds, and wading birds. Diamondback terrapins and <b>clapper</b> <b>rails</b> are frequent visitors, as are many varieties of songbird.|$|R
500|$|That year, the Sierra Club filed {{a lawsuit}} that halted {{progress}} on the project the next year, due to concerns about damage to the least tern and light-footed <b>clapper</b> <b>rail</b> bird populations caused by {{the construction of a}} nearby hotel and the roads to it would have. Chief U.S. District Judge Gordon Thompson stopped the work because the preserve had not been created. It was estimated that the shutdown resulted in the state losing $25,000 (about $ in [...] dollars) a day, as well as over 185layoffs.|$|E
2500|$|The {{variety of}} natural {{habitats}} includes mixed oak woodland, riparian zones, and bayland marshes. One endangered species, the California <b>clapper</b> <b>rail,</b> was sighted feeding on mudflats by the Third Avenue bridge in San Mateo. [...] The marsh areas {{are also likely}} habitat for the endangered Salt Marsh Harvest Mouse, which inhabit the middle and high zones of salt and brackish marshes, {{as well as for}} the endangered marsh plant, Point Reyes bird's beak.|$|E
2500|$|The California {{wildfires}} that officially {{started on}} October 21, 2007, burned [...] of native habitat {{preserved in the}} park and caused it to temporarily close. The park also moved many of their endangered animals out of danger. The fire did not reach any of the main enclosures, and no animals were killed directly by the fire, although deaths of a <b>clapper</b> <b>rail</b> and kiang were attributed to indirect effects of the blaze.|$|E
50|$|Benicia SRA {{has been}} {{designated}} an Important Bird Area, providing habitat for endangered California <b>clapper</b> <b>rails</b> (Rallus longirostris obsoletus) and black rails (Laterallus jamaicensis). Other uncommon species include Virginia rails (Rallus limicola), Suisun song sparrows (Melospiza melodia maxillaris) and salt marsh common yellowthroat (Geothlypis trichas sinuosa). On their journey along the Pacific Flyway, many waterfowl winter in the park.|$|R
50|$|Pacific harbor seals have {{occasionally}} {{been spotted}} in the waterways/lagoons around Redwood Shores. The areas {{in and around}} the community are home to a variety of wildlife including raccoons, skunks, ducks, geese, egrets, great blue herons, <b>clapper</b> <b>rails,</b> harvest field mice, sting rays, jellyfish, and many other species. Canada geese pose a nuisance and the community is actively working on reducing their presence.|$|R
40|$|I {{conducted}} call-response surveys for Yuma <b>clapper</b> <b>rails</b> in the Colorado River delta, Mexico {{during the}} breeding seasons of 1999 and 2000 to estimate abundance, determine distribution, and identify patterns of habitat use. The maximum estimate of abundance was 6, 629 individuals (95 % C. I. 4, 859 to 8, 399). Rails were widely {{distributed in the}} delta, occupying almost all marshlands dominated by cattail. Rail density was higher in the Cienega de Santa Clara than in the other wetlands of the delta. High densities of <b>clapper</b> <b>rails</b> were associated with increased water depth, high cattail coverage, high vegetation coverage, low saltcedar coverage, proximity to shoreline, and increased salinity up to 8 ppt. As this is an endangered subspecies shared by Mexico and the U. S., the conservation of the delta ecosystem should be the interest of both countries, especially when management decisions upstream in the U. S. have an impact over natural areas downstream in Mexico...|$|R
2500|$|A {{variety of}} salamanders, snakes and frogs are also present. The federally listed as {{threatened}} California red-legged frog {{is present in}} the northern reach draining the south slopes of Annadel State Park. Several endangered species (mostly associated with the marshy discharge area) present include California <b>clapper</b> <b>rail</b> (Rallus longirostris), California black rail (Laterallus jamaicensis), California brown pelican (Pelicanus occudentalis), California freshwater shrimp (Syncaris pacifica), salt marsh harvest mouse (Reithrodontomys raviventris [...] ), Suisun shrew (Sorex ornatus sinuosus), Sacramento splittail (Pogonichtys macrolepidotus). The above are endangered species {{with the exception of the}} splittail, steelhead and black rail, which species are federally designated as threatened.|$|E
2500|$|Birds are {{abundant}} in Richardson Bay, with {{over one million}} migratory visitors each winter, many of whom utilizing the upper mudflats and Bothin Marsh associated with the area west of the U.S. Route 101. [...] In addition to being designated a high score IBA, Richardson's Bay has been dedicated as [...] a Hemispheric Reserve of the Western Shorebird Network. [...] Migrating birds that winter regularly at Richardson's Bay include least sandpiper, western sandpiper, spotted sandpiper, American avocet, dunlin, marbled godwit, greater yellowlegs, willet, long-billed curlew and dowitchers. [...] A special resident of Bothin Marsh, Blackies' Creek mouth and DeSilva Island is the California <b>clapper</b> <b>rail,</b> a non-migratory endangered species.|$|E
2500|$|Richardson Bay {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{pristine}} estuaries on the Pacific Coast in spite of its urbanized periphery, since it supports extensive eelgrass areas and sizable undisturbed intertidal habitats. It is a feeding and resting area for a panoply of estuarine and pelagic birds, while its associated marshes and littoral zones support a variety of animal and plant life. [...] Richardson Bay has been designated as an Important Bird Area (IBA), based upon its large number of annual bird visitors and residents, its sightings of California <b>clapper</b> <b>rail</b> and its strategic location in the flyway. The bay's waters are subject to a [...] "no discharge" [...] rule to protect the elaborate and fragile ecosystems present, including a complex fishery, diverse mollusk [...] populations and even marine mammals such as the harbor seal.|$|E
5000|$|An undescribed species, [...] "Maritrema sp. I", {{is known}} from <b>clapper</b> <b>rails</b> (Rallus crepitans) and marsh rice rats (Oryzomys palustris) {{in the eastern}} United States. M. heardi {{was placed in a}} {{separate}} genus Floridatrema upon its description in 1994 {{on the basis of a}} morphological difference, but was reassigned to Maritrema in 2005, as molecular data indicated that Maritrema would be paraphyletic without the inclusion of the species.|$|R
50|$|The last of {{the homes}} on Lea-Hutaff Island was {{destroyed}} by a storm in October 2015. The northern portion of Lea-Hutaff Island that was Lea Island is now mostly held by the National Audubon Society and the state government, while the Hutaff area {{is owned by the}} Hutaff family. The island is only accessible by boat. The island is also a prominent nesting spot for loggerhead turtles, Least Terns, American Oystercatchers, Piping Plovers and <b>Clapper</b> <b>Rails.</b>|$|R
50|$|A small {{population}} of red fox, muskrat, mink, otter, voles, northern diamondback terrapin, and various nonpoisonous water snakes also {{live in the}} marsh areas. <b>Clapper</b> <b>rails,</b> seaside sparrows, and marsh wrens also depend on the protected refuge habitat. Peregrine falcons have been nesting on the refuge every year since the first peregrine nesting tower was installed in 1984. The marsh and estuary are important {{in the production of}} marine species such as crabs and oysters that help form the food chain.|$|R
2500|$|The San Francisco Estuary {{is a major}} stop on the Pacific flyway for {{migrating}} waterfowl. Yet {{little is}} known about the flow of carbon in or out of the estuary via birds. Millions of waterfowl annually use the bay shallows as a refuge. Most of the birds are dabbling ducks that feed on submerged aquatic vegetation. Diving ducks (such as scaups) feed on epibenthic organisms like C. amurensis, representing a possible flow of carbon from that otherwise dead end. [...] Two endangered species of birds are found here: the California least tern and the California <b>clapper</b> <b>rail.</b> Exposed bay muds provide important feeding areas for shorebirds, but underlying layers of bay mud pose geological hazards for structures near many parts of the bay perimeter. Piscivorous birds such as cormorants and pelicans also inhabit the estuary, but their trophic impact remains poorly studied.|$|E

50|$|Levinseniella deblocki is a {{parasitic}} fluke {{that occurs}} in salt marshes along the eastern coast of the Gulf of Mexico. Its life cycle includes a metacercarial stage in the gonads of fiddler crabs (Uca) and one intermediate host is a gastropod from the genus Heleobops (family Hydrobiidae). Adults {{are found in the}} digestive tracts of marsh rice rats (Oryzomys palustris), raccoons (Procyon lotor), and <b>clapper</b> <b>rails</b> (Rallus crepitans). Within the subgenus Austromicrophallus, L. deblocki is most similar to the European L. polydactyla and the Californian L. ophidea, but differs in size, ecology, and morphology.|$|R
40|$|Abstract In {{this study}} we used {{feathers}} to biomonitor exposure to the polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) Aroclor 1268 congener mixture in <b>clapper</b> <b>rails</b> (Rallus longiros-tris). This species {{has been used as}} an indicator species of environmental damage for the LCP superfund site located in Brunswick, GA, USA which is contaminated with Aroclor 1268, a congener mixture that has been used in limited amounts elsewhere and therefore {{can be used as a}} contaminant marker. The Aroclor 1268 congener mixture, including congener profiles, were quantified in feathers using gas chromatography (GC). Concurrently, each sam-ple was quantified for the total Aroclor 1268 congener mixture using an enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) and compared to the GC results to determine if ELISA was an efficient method for quantifying or qualifying PCBs in feathers. ELISA consistently quantified PCB loads over an order of magnitude lower than the GC. Based on sample replication, extraction recovery, and sample spike, it appears that GC is the more reliable method of detection and that ELISA methods may be more suitable for qualitative exposure assessment for this par-ticular Aroclor. Moreover, since all <b>clapper</b> <b>rails</b> from the LCP site had the Aroclor 1268 congener mixture in their feathers, this experiment showed that birds were returning to the site to breed despite the adverse effects experienced by this population from the contamination revealed in previous studies. This study also supports the utility of feathers as a non-lethal mechanism by which to biomonitor PCBs in the environment...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{effect of}} {{contamination}} on eggshell mineralization {{has been studied}} for <b>clapper</b> <b>rails</b> (Rallus longirostris) inhabiting a contaminated salt marsh in coastal Georgia. To {{assess the impact of}} contaminants, the thickness, microstructure (crystal orientation), mineral composition, and chemistry of shell material were analyzed from a contaminated site and a nearby reference site using optical microscopy, X-ray diffraction, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, and gas chromatography with electron capture detector. Eggshells from the contaminated site were generally thinner than those from the reference site. Also, eggshells from the contaminated site were abnormally brittle and contained anomalous microstructural attributes. The combination of reduced shell thickness and anomalous microstructure resulted in weaker eggshells, which in turn could pose a significant threat to the reproductiv...|$|R

50|$|In 1995, {{there was}} a study that U.S Navy has found {{elevated}} levels of toxic chemicals in the carcasses and food of endangered birds at the Seal Beach National Wildlife Refuge. The elevated levels of cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, nickel and zinc, all poisonous heavy metals, were found in dead California least terns and light-footed <b>clapper</b> <b>rails.</b> However, these potentially toxic substances were not only found in the birds, but also found in smaller animals normally eaten by them. They also found small amounts of PCBs and DDT, a dangerous pesticide that was banned by the Endangered Species Act in 1973. To find the cause, the Navy assessed the impacts of ponds on the refuge on the birds. They found that {{there was a}} construction of the pond by the Port of Long Beach that has raised the volume and velocity of the bay water flowing into the refuge. The toxic materials affect the birds with altered growth patterns, reduced survival, loss of appetite, lethargy, difficulty in reproducing, and even killing the birds.|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{what motivates}} public {{perception}} and actions {{is important in}} assessing public response and forecasting the success of resource management plans. Failure of the policy makers to foresee public reaction can result in expensive delays, bad press and lengthy court battles which at best, increases the cost of implementation and at worst stops resource management projects altogether. An endangered species management program was stopped at the Seal Beach National Wildlife Refuge in Southern California when an animal right 2 ̆ 7 s organization protested the euthanizing of non-native red foxes where were decimating endangered populations of California Least terns and <b>Clapper</b> <b>rails</b> in the coastal wetlands. The animals right 2 ̆ 7 s organization valued the red fox and perceived the management practice as unacceptable. This {{study was conducted to}} determine the perceptions of the general public in regards to the species involved and management plan. Through a survey of a three specific sample populations, it was found that over half of the respondents valued the endangered birds and believed that they should be protected even if it meant euthanizing the red foxes. The public would have preferred other methods to remove the foxes and protect the birds but were not willing to play for alternative, more costly management practices. Finally, the public had a clear preference for a 2 ̆ 2 natural 2 ̆ 2 management plan in which native coyotes were re-introduced to the coastal wetland to establish a better balanced habitat...|$|R
