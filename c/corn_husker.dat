5000|$|John Wind was an {{architect}} {{who worked in}} southwest Georgia in the United States from approximately 1838 {{until his death in}} 1863. He was born in Bristol, England, in 1819. John Wind designed the Greenwood, Susina, Oak Lawn, Pebble Hill, Eudora and Fair Oaks monumental plantation houses, the Thomas county courthouse and a few in-town cottages. William Warren Rogers writes [...] "Some of Wind's work still exists and reveals him as one of the South's most talented but, unfortunately, least known architects." [...] John Wind also worked as an inventor, jeweler, master mechanic and surveyor. He devised a clock that remained wound for one year and was awarded a patent for a cotton thresher and cleaner, Patent Number 5369. He was also the co-recipient of a <b>corn</b> <b>husker</b> and sheller patent in 1860. But it was his work as {{an architect}} that made him an enduring figure.|$|E

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} three broad {{categories}} of a {{turn of the}} century farming collection containing more than 40, 000 total items. The three categories examined in this study include: wrenches, spark plugs, and <b>corn</b> <b>huskers.</b> Within each category, judgmental samples were selected to reflect the variation present in the collection. Repeated interviews with the collection's owner, utilization of collector's guides, and historical documentation has yielded a comprehensive explanation of the enormous variation present in these artifacts. This variation is based upon a number of factors which includes: change over time, individual use, differing functions within an artifact type, and added variation in pursuit of a patent. Due to the increasing age of the majority of these collectors, such investigations should be an immediate concern before an entire generation of knowledge is essentially lost...|$|R

50|$|The farm proved {{difficult}} for the family to manage. In 1857, William Wallace Marsh began to expierment with grain bundling methods. Marsh discovered he could bind grain while another was being cut if the cutting apparatus could move. His brother, Charles W., joined the effort the next day. For the next few years, the brothers worked together to perfect their harvester. In 1859, the Marsh brothers unveiled the completed product during a reaping contest north of DeKalb. The success of the Marsh's design was owed {{to the fact that}} anyone could use the implement—during demonstration, the Marshes had young girls and hoboes operate the machine with ease. The Marsh design was deemed the most effective reaper, and the brothers set to manufacture the product.Marsh Brothers was founded in 1858. William Marsh was the inventor of the company while his brother Charles handled the financial aspects. Marsh's inventions were responsible for thirty-five approved patents, expanding the company line with products such as <b>corn</b> <b>huskers,</b> wire stretchers, and plows. The first company factory was opened in Plano, where they met prominent settler Lewis Steward, who invested in the company. Oringially capable of producing 100 harvesters in a year, Steward's capital allowed the company to expand to 10,000 per year. The produced their goods essentially unrivaled until 1871. Marsh married M. J. Smith on January 8, 1871. Marsh, Steward & Company moved to Sycamore in 1873. Marsh was elected alderman of Sycamore that year, a position he held for decades. Two years later, William Deering purchased the company and moved most of its operations to North Chicago. It merged with the McCormick Harvesting Machine Company in 1902 to form International Harvester.|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} of the main food equipments manufactured in Maroua was carried out {{with the aim of}} highlighting their impact in the technological appropriation by the local populations and the industrial development of the city. Research carried out enabled the researcher to administer survey forms and to observe the design and realisation of the equipment models. Results indicate that the main equipments are mills for cereals (millet, sorghum, <b>corn)</b> and fruit, <b>huskers,</b> ginners (grains removers) and oil expellers. These equipments are mainly operated {{at the level of the}} village units. They suffer from low spread. The technological parameters of the dimensioning are not always controlled (capacity, temperature, input and output particle size), as well as the technical parameters (shape, materials used, maintenance). The scale of manufacture and the lack of innovation in the design of these equipments do not allow the installation of real “small industries”. This situation delays the technological development not only of the city and the region, but also of Cameroon because the Far-North region is a great supplier of agricultural products (cereals, tubers, vegetables, oilseeds, fruits) of economic importance...|$|R
