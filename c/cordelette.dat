50|$|A natural anchor is {{a secure}} natural feature which {{can serve as}} a {{climbing}} anchor by attaching a sling, lanyard, or <b>cordelette</b> and a carabiner. Examples of natural anchors include trees, boulders, lodged chockstones, horns, icicles, and protrusions.|$|E
5000|$|A load-sharing anchor {{which does}} not extend {{in the event of}} an {{individual}} anchor failure has the property of non-extension. This important feature reduces the potential for shock-loading the remaining individual anchors during a failure. Non-extension can be accomplished by tying an appropriate knot in the interconnecting <b>cordelette,</b> or by using individual slings for the equalization. The principle of non-extension refers to the mitigation of shock-loading, rather than the elongation of materials under an increased load.|$|E
5000|$|Ice climbers {{also use}} the ice itself as protection. The two most common of such {{techniques}} are the V-Thread (also known as the [...] "Abalakov" [...] anchor, named after a Russian climber who popularised the technique) and the ice bollard. In a V-thread two intersecting tunnels are bored into the ice to form a [...] "V" [...] shaped tunnel. A sling or <b>cordelette</b> is then threaded through the V and tied in a loop. The rope is passed through the sling, which remains left behind after use.|$|E
50|$|When a belayer {{needs to}} {{transfer}} the load from his harness to the anchor to escape the system:a rope grab (mechanical or friction knot/Prusik) {{is placed on the}} load line towards the load, rope is terminated on the rope grab (or the tails of accessory cord are used when using a <b>cordelette</b> with a Prusik as a rope grab) and runs back to the anchor where a Munter mule is tied under tension. The load can then be lowered (transferred) from the original belay onto the Munter Mule via the rope grab. The new line is often consider independent of the safety system so the original belay needs to be maintained throughout the process and secured back to the anchor before the system can be left unattended.|$|E
