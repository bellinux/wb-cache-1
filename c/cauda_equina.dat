5|$|Imaging is {{indicated}} {{when there are}} red flags, ongoing neurological symptoms that do not resolve, or ongoing or worsening pain. In particular, early use of imaging (either MRI or CT) is recommended for suspected cancer, infection, or <b>cauda</b> <b>equina</b> syndrome. MRI is slightly better than CT for identifying disc disease; the two technologies are equally useful for diagnosing spinal stenosis. Only a few physical diagnostic tests are helpful. The straight leg raise test is almost always positive in those with disc herniation. Lumbar provocative discography {{may be useful to}} identify a specific disc causing pain in those with chronic high levels of low back pain. Similarly, therapeutic procedures such as nerve blocks can be used to determine a specific source of pain. Some evidence supports the use of facet joint injections, transforminal epidural injections and sacroilliac injections as diagnostic tests. Most other physical tests, such as evaluating for scoliosis, muscle weakness or wasting, and impaired reflexes, are of little use.|$|E
25|$|Typically, {{symptoms}} are experienced only {{on one side}} of the body. If the prolapse is very large and presses on the nerves within the spinal column or the <b>cauda</b> <b>equina,</b> both sides of the body may be affected, often with serious consequences. Compression of the <b>cauda</b> <b>equina</b> can cause permanent nerve damage or paralysis. The nerve damage can result in loss of bowel and bladder control as well as sexual dysfunction. This disorder is called <b>cauda</b> <b>equina</b> syndrome.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cauda</b> <b>equina</b> syndrome*, {{also known}} as {{degenerative}} lumbosacral stenosis, in dogs is a compression of the <b>cauda</b> <b>equina</b> by a narrowing of the lumbosacral vertebral canal. It is most commonly seen in German Shepherd Dogs. Signs include pain, weakness, and rear limb muscle atrophy.|$|E
25|$|The {{spinal cord}} terminates in the conus medullaris and <b>cauda</b> <b>equina.</b>|$|E
25|$|Spinal {{manipulation}} is contraindicated for disc herniations {{when there}} are progressive neurological deficits such as with <b>cauda</b> <b>equina</b> syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Involvement of {{the spinal}} cord is rare, but can lead to {{abnormal}} sensation or weakness {{in one or more}} limbs, or <b>cauda</b> <b>equina</b> symptoms (incontinence to urine or stool, decreased sensation in the buttocks).|$|E
25|$|Low to moderate-quality {{evidence}} suggests that spinal manipulation is an effective treatment for acute sciatica. For chronic sciatica, the evidence is poor. Spinal manipulation has been found generally safe {{for the treatment of}} disc-related pain; however, case reports have found an association with <b>cauda</b> <b>equina</b> syndrome, and it is contraindicated when there are progressive neurological deficits.|$|E
25|$|Other {{compressive}} spinal causes include lumbar spinal stenosis, {{a condition}} in which the spinal canal (the spaces the spinal cord runs through) narrows and compresses the spinal cord, <b>cauda</b> <b>equina,</b> or sciatic nerve roots. This narrowing can be caused by bone spurs, spondylolisthesis, inflammation, or a herniated disc, which decreases available space for the spinal cord, thus pinching and irritating nerves from the spinal cord that travel to the sciatic nerves.|$|E
25|$|The {{condition}} is sometimes {{classified as a}} psychiatric disorder. However, {{it can also be}} caused by medical problems such as diabetic neuropathy, multiple sclerosis, genital mutilation, complications from genital surgery, pelvic trauma (such as from a straddle injury caused by falling on the bars of a climbing frame, bicycle or gymnastics beam), hormonal imbalances, total hysterectomy, spinal cord injury, <b>cauda</b> <b>equina</b> syndrome, uterine embolisation, childbirth trauma (vaginal tearing through the use of forceps or suction or a large or unclosed episiotomy), vulvodynia and cardiovascular disease.|$|E
25|$|Both {{the central}} nervous system (brain and spinal cord) and the {{peripheral}} nervous system may be involved. Emboli to the brain may cause stroke-like episodes, headache and episodes of loss of vision in one eye (known as amaurosis fugax). Emboli to the eye can be seen by ophthalmoscopy and are known as plaques of Hollenhorst. Emboli to the spinal cord may cause paraparesis (decreased power in the legs) or <b>cauda</b> <b>equina</b> syndrome, a group of symptoms due to loss of function of the distal part of the spinal cord - loss of control over the bladder, rectum and skin sensation around the anus. If the blood supply to a single nerve is interrupted by an embolus, the result is loss of function in the muscles supplied by that nerve; this phenomenon is called a mononeuropathy.|$|E
25|$|Sciatica is {{generally}} {{caused by the}} compression of lumbar nerves L4, or L5 or sacral nerves S1, S2, or S3, or by compression of the sciatic nerve itself. When sciatica is caused by compression of a dorsal nerve root (radix), it is considered a lumbar radiculopathy (or radiculitis when accompanied with an inflammatory response). This can occur {{as a result of}} a spinal disk bulge or spinal disc herniation (a herniated intervertebral disc), or from roughening, enlarging, or misalignment (spondylolisthesis) of the vertebrae, or as a result of degenerated discs that can reduce the diameter of the lateral foramen (natural hole) through which nerve roots exit the spine. The intervertebral discs consist of an annulus fibrosus, which forms a ring surrounding the inner nucleus pulposus. When there is a tear in the anulus fibrosus, the nucleus pulposus (pulp) may extrude through the tear and press against spinal nerves within the spinal cord, <b>cauda</b> <b>equina,</b> or exiting nerve roots, causing inflammation, numbness, or excruciating pain. Inflammation of the spinal canal can also spread to adjacent facet joints and cause lower back pain and/or referred pain in the posterior thigh(s). Pseudosciatic pain can also be caused by compression of peripheral sections of the nerve, usually from soft tissue tension in the piriformis or related muscles.|$|E
500|$|<b>Cauda</b> <b>equina</b> {{syndrome}} (CES) {{results from}} a lesion below {{the level at which}} the spinal cord splits into the <b>cauda</b> <b>equina,</b> at levels L2–S5 below the conus medullaris. Thus it is not a true spinal cord syndrome since it is nerve roots that are damaged and not the cord itself; however it is common for several of these nerves to be damaged at the same time due to their proximity. CES can occur by itself or alongside conus medullaris syndrome. It can cause low back pain, weakness or paralysis in the lower limbs, loss of sensation, bowel and bladder dysfunction, and loss of reflexes. Unlike in conus medullaris syndrome, symptoms often occur on only one side of the body. The cause is often compression, e.g. by a ruptured intervertebral disk or tumor. [...] Since the nerves damaged in CES are actually peripheral nerves because they have already branched off from the spinal cord, the injury has better prognosis for recovery of function: the peripheral nervous system has a greater capacity for healing than the central nervous system.|$|E
2500|$|Surgery for {{unilateral}} sciatica {{involves the}} removal of part of the disc, which {{is known as a}} discectomy. While it results in short-term benefits, [...] the long-term benefits appear to be equivalent to conservative care. Treatment of the underlying cause of the compression is needed in cases of epidural abscess, epidural tumors, and <b>cauda</b> <b>equina</b> syndrome.|$|E
2500|$|The {{presence}} of <b>cauda</b> <b>equina</b> syndrome (in {{which there is}} incontinence, weakness and genital numbness) is considered a medical emergency requiring immediate attention and possibly surgical decompression. Regarding the role of surgery for failed medical therapy in people without a significant neurological deficit, a Cochrane review concluded that [...] "limited evidence is now available to support some aspects of surgical practice".|$|E
2500|$|The fluid then flows {{around the}} {{superior}} sagittal sinus to be reabsorbed via the arachnoid granulations [...] (or arachnoid villi) into the venous sinuses, after which {{it passes through}} the jugular vein and major venous system. CSF within the spinal cord can flow {{all the way down}} to the lumbar cistern at the end of the cord around the <b>cauda</b> <b>equina</b> where lumbar punctures are performed.|$|E
2500|$|Central neuraxial {{anesthesia}} is {{the injection}} of local anesthetic around {{the spinal cord}} to provide analgesia in the abdomen, pelvis or lower extremities. [...] It is divided into either spinal (injection into the subarachnoid space), epidural (injection outside of the subarachnoid space into the epidural space) and caudal (injection into the <b>cauda</b> <b>equina</b> or {{tail end of the}} spinal cord). [...] Spinal and epidural are the most commonly used forms of central neuraxial blockade.|$|E
2500|$|Persons {{suffering}} from peripheral neuropathy experience numbness and tingling {{in their hands}} and feet. This can cause ambulation impairment, such as trouble climbing stairs or maintaining balance. Gait abnormality is also common in persons with nervous system problems such as <b>cauda</b> <b>equina</b> syndrome, [...] multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, myasthenia gravis, normal pressure hydrocephalus, and Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease. Research has shown that neurological gait abnormalities are {{associated with an increased}} risk of falls in older adults.|$|E
2500|$|Sciatica {{can also}} be caused by tumors {{impinging}} on the spinal cord or the nerve roots. Severe back pain extending to the hips and feet, loss of bladder or bowel control, or muscle weakness may result from spinal tumors or [...] <b>cauda</b> <b>equina</b> syndrome. Trauma to the spine, such as from a car accident, may also lead to sciatica. A relationship has been proposed with a latent Propionbacterium acnes infection in the intervertebral discs, but the role it plays is not yet clear.|$|E
2500|$|Fractures are {{the most}} {{dangerous}} aspect of osteoporosis. Debilitating acute and chronic pain in the elderly is often attributed to fractures from [...] osteoporosis {{and can lead to}} further disability and early mortality. These fractures may also be asymptomatic. The most common osteoporotic fractures are of the wrist, spine, shoulder and hip. The symptoms of a vertebral collapse ("compression fracture") are sudden back pain, often with radicular pain (shooting pain due to nerve root compression) and rarely with spinal cord compression or <b>cauda</b> <b>equina</b> syndrome. Multiple vertebral fractures lead to a stooped posture, loss of height, and chronic pain with resultant reduction in mobility.|$|E
2500|$|There is not {{sufficient}} data to establish the safety of spinal manipulations. The rate of adverse events is unknown. Adverse events are increasingly reported in randomized clinical trials of spinal manipulation but remain under–reported despite recommendations in the 2010 CONSORT guidelines. It is frequently associated with mild to moderate temporary adverse effects, and also serious outcomes which can result in permanent disability or death, which include strokes, spinal disc herniation, vertebral and rib fractures and <b>cauda</b> <b>equina</b> syndrome. Serious outcomes are very rare. About half of people reported encountering adverse effects following spinal manipulation. The positive effects to be found with spinal manipulation are: increasing range of motion and mobility, pain and headache relief, and improved posture.|$|E
2500|$|When the afferent and efferent nerves {{are both}} destroyed, {{as they may}} be by tumors of the <b>cauda</b> <b>equina</b> or filum terminale, the bladder is flaccid and {{distended}} for a while. Gradually, however, the muscle of the [...] "decentralized bladder" [...] becomes active, with many contraction waves that expel dribbles of urine out of the urethra. The bladder becomes shrunken and the bladder wall hypertrophied. The reason for the difference between the small, hypertrophic bladder seen in this condition and the distended, hypotonic bladder seen when only the afferent nerves are interrupted is not known. The hyperactive state in the former condition suggests the development of denervation hypersensitization even though the neurons interrupted are preganglionic rather than postganglionic.|$|E
2500|$|A {{difficult}} {{issue that has}} arisen recently is the case where the defendant neither factually causes the harm, nor {{increases the risk of}} its occurrence. [...] In Chester v Afshar , a doctor negligently failed to warn a patient of risks inherent in an operation, specifically <b>cauda</b> <b>equina</b> syndrome. [...] The patient had the operation and a risk materialized causing injury. [...] It was found that even if the patient had been warned, the patient would still have undergone the operation, simply at a different time. [...] The risk of the injury would be the same at both times. [...] Accordingly, the doctor neither caused the injury (because but for the failure to warn, the patient would still have gone ahead with the operation), nor increased the risk of its occurrence (because the risk was the same either way). [...] Yet the House of Lords, embracing a more normative approach to causation, still held the doctor liable. [...] Lawyers and philosophers continue to debate whether and how this changes the state of the law.|$|E
50|$|The {{management}} of true <b>cauda</b> <b>equina</b> syndrome frequently involves surgical decompression. When <b>cauda</b> <b>equina</b> syndrome {{is caused by}} a herniated disk early surgical decompression is recommended.|$|E
50|$|The <b>cauda</b> <b>equina</b> {{was named}} after its {{resemblance}} to a horse's tail (<b>cauda</b> <b>equina)</b> by the French anatomist Andreas Lazarius (André du Laurens) in the 17th century.|$|E
50|$|Typically, {{symptoms}} are experienced only {{on one side}} of the body.

This disorder is called <b>cauda</b> <b>equina</b> syndrome.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>cauda</b> <b>equina</b> (Latin for [...] "horse's tail") is {{a bundle}} of spinal nerves and spinal nerve roots, {{consisting}} of the second through fifth lumbar nerve pairs, the first through fifth sacral nerve pairs, and the coccygeal nerve, all of which arise from the lumbar enlargement and the conus medullaris of the spinal cord. The <b>cauda</b> <b>equina</b> occupies the lumbar cistern, a subarachnoid space inferior to the conus medullaris. The nerves that compose the <b>cauda</b> <b>equina</b> innervate the pelvic organs and lower limbs to include motor innervation of the hips, knees, ankles, feet, internal anal sphincter and external anal sphincter. In addition, the <b>cauda</b> <b>equina</b> extends to sensory innervation of the perineum and, partially, parasympathetic innervation of the bladder.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cauda</b> <b>equina</b> {{syndrome}} (CES) is {{a serious}} neurologic condition in which damage to the <b>cauda</b> <b>equina</b> causes loss of function of the lumbar plexus (nerve roots) of the spinal canal below the termination (conus medullaris) of the spinal cord. CES is a lower motor neuron lesion.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cauda</b> <b>equina</b> {{syndrome}} {{can occur}} during pregnancy due to lumbar disc herniation; age of mother increases the risk. Surgery {{can still be}} performed and the pregnancy does not adversely affect treatment. Treatment for those with <b>cauda</b> <b>equina</b> {{can and should be}} carried out at any time during pregnancy.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cauda</b> <b>equina</b> syndrome, a rare {{disorder}} {{affecting the}} bundle of nerve roots (<b>cauda</b> <b>equina)</b> at the lower (lumbar) end of the spinal cord, is a surgical emergency. <b>Cauda</b> <b>equina</b> syndrome occurs when the nerve roots in the lumbar spine are compressed, disrupting sensation and movement. Nerve roots that control {{the function of the}} bladder and bowel are especially vulnerable to damage. It can lead to permanent paralysis, impaired bladder and/or bowel control, loss of sexual sensation, and other problems if left untreated. Even with immediate treatment, some patients may not recover complete function.|$|E
