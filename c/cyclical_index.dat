40|$|The postwar {{business}} cycle in Lebanon {{was dominated by}} the exchange rate based stabilization (ERBS) program implemented by the successive postwar governments. In the early period 1993 - 2002, a boom-bust dynamics was generated during which the economy exhibited the well-documented stylised facts of ERBS programs. The paper develops a <b>cyclical</b> <b>index</b> (ci) for Lebanon during this period and a VAR model shows that real interest rates (rr) {{had a significant impact}} on the dynamics of the {{business cycle}} during the early ERBS period. The second period 2002 - 2005 was marked by a recovery generated by foreign aid given to Lebanon in the Paris II international donors' conference held in November 2002. The period ended in a recession in 2005 brought about by the assassination of Lebanon's ex-prime minister Rafic Hariri. The third phase of the business cycle was caused by the Israel-Lebanon war in the summer of 2006 which led to widespread civilian and infrastructure damage and ended a brief recovery in early 2006. Throughout the period 2002 - 2006, foreign aid was instrumental in the resilience of the ERBS program. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{simulation}} method to model seasonal time series is developed. Using {{the ratio of}} seasonal data to nonlinear periodic trend, simulation parameters of the seasonal indices are identified. A decomposed seasonal time series is re-seasonalized to identify the combined random as well as <b>cyclical</b> <b>indices</b> in the seasonal model. These indices are modeled as a multi channel queue system. The seasonal time series is constructed as a multiplicative decomposition simulation model. To improve performance of the time series, the simulation model identifies the best seasonal <b>indices</b> and combined <b>cyclical</b> and random <b>indices.</b> These indices are updated whenever the simulation search improves squared error criteria of the fitted model. The simulated optimized seasonal, random and <b>cyclical</b> <b>indices</b> are used finally to re-seasonalize the data for forecast evaluation. The software is developed to test {{the performance of the}} approach using airline travel data available in Box, Jenkins and Reinsel (1994). The proposed {{simulation method}} achieves 38. 89 % improvement in squared error measure against the X- 11 decomposition method...|$|R
50|$|On October 9, 2007, the Dow Jones Industrial Average {{closed at}} the record level of 14,164.53. Two days later on October 11, the Dow would trade at its highest {{intra-day}} level ever, at the 14,198.10 mark. In what would normally take many years to accomplish; numerous reasons were cited for the Dow's extremely rapid rise from the 11,000 level in early 2006, to the 14,000 level in late 2007. They included future possible takeovers and mergers, healthy earnings reports particularly in the tech sector, and moderate inflationary numbers; fueling speculation the Federal Reserve would not raise interest rates. Roughly on par with the 2000 record when adjusted for inflation, this represented the final high of the <b>cyclical</b> bull. The <b>index</b> closed 2007 at 13,264.82, a level it would not surpass for nearly five years.|$|R
40|$|Seven {{diabetic}} {{girls who}} presented with cyclical disturbance of diabetic control before the menarche are described. In six girls cyclical hyperglycaemia occurred {{and in one}} <b>cyclical</b> hypoglycaemia. The <b>index</b> case is described in detail, and is then included in {{a description of the}} main clinical features of all seven cases. Cyclical disturbance of diabetic control may present in diabetic girls from age 9 years onwards. Home blood glucose monitoring records may reveal cyclical disturbance, usually hyperglycaemia, and usually occurring at 21 - 34 day intervals and lasting for two to five days. Serious illnesses and hospital admission can be averted by educating parents to make appropriate changes to insulin regimen or diet. Our hypothesis is that the disturbance of diabetic control is caused by the onset of cyclical hormonal changes, a 'menstrual' cycle before menstruation. The precise mechanism for the changes in carbohydrate tolerance is unknown...|$|R
40|$|We {{contribute}} to the intense debate on the real effects of fiscal stimuli by showing {{that the impact of}} government expenditure shocks depends crucially on key country characteristics, such as the level of development, exchange rate regime, openness to trade, and public indebtedness. Based on a novel quarterly dataset of government expenditure in 44 countries, we find that (i) the output effect of an increase in government consumption is larger in industrial than in developing countries, (ii) the fisscal multiplier is relatively large in economies operating under predetermined exchange rate but zero in economies operating under flexible exchange rates; (iii) fiscal multipliers in open economies are lower than in closed economies and (iv) fiscal multipliers in high-debt countries are also zero.

40|$|Abstract. Worm cam {{mechanism}} {{is a common}} indexing mechanism which is widely used in automatic machinery. Because of its high transmission precision requirements, the mechanism has high demands on the cylinder cam. The machining methods of cylinder cam are unique and the methods of special machine tool and NC machining are the two methods that general adopted in the machining of it. In this paper, the method of CNC Programming which is used for machining cylinder cam in 5 -axeses high speed DMU 70 eVolution Machining Center is introduced. The machining principle of cylinder cam has been studied, and the mathematical model for CNC Programming has also been worked out. The automated compensation of cutting tool’s radius is used in this field for the first time. Worm {{cam mechanism}} Cylinder cam mechanism is widely used in automatic machinery. Fig. 1 shows one kind of cylinder cam mechanism. When the camshaft rotates, the groove and the convex ridge in the cam make the rollers revolve round {{the center of the}} indexing plate, so the <b>cyclical</b> movement of <b>indexing</b> plate is realized. This mechanism is mainly used in the occasions of more indexing workstations, larger load and lower speed. The speed and acceleration rules of its cam follower can be chosen according to the predetermined motion demands, and then realize the precise transmission. Because of its high transmission precision requirements, the special and complex shape, the machining methods of this mechanism are unique. The common machining methods of worm cam have the following two: The method of special machine tool: Because the indexing curves of cam have a high transmission precision requirement and complex shape, and also, they are space curved face, so we could take advantage of copying machine to machine the cam curves by model or use the special machine tool to machine them...|$|R
