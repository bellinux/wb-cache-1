40|$|Ciguatera, {{a form of}} fish {{poisoning}} with a pantropical distribution, {{has been}} a recognized health problem in the Carribean and the Pacific for centuries (in the decade from 1973 to 1983 for the island Pacific region as a whole, reported incidence, conservatively 20 % of actual incidence, was 97 / 100, 000). Island peoples in subsistence communities have developed strategies to minimize its impact. These strategies are less effective when people move to towns, cities and wage labor. The existence of <b>ciguatoxic</b> <b>fish,</b> which are indistinguishable from those that are not, has serious implications for development in island states. Furthermore, development activities which result in disruption of the marine environment increase the potential for ciguatoxic biotopes. The distribution of this health risk in the Pacific region is presented, adaptive strategies discussed, and implications for health, nutrition, resource development and tourism explored. ciguatera marine toxin nutrition development resources...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Ciguatera toxins (CTXs) in wild {{coral reef}} fish {{collected}} from the southern coast of China were analysed. Cigua-Check kits were used for primary screening. Mouse bioassaywas used to quantify toxins of the samples identified as positive by the Cigua-Check kit. High-performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC–MS/MS) was used to further analyse P-CTX- 1 of ciguatera toxins in the samples identified as positive by the mouse bioassay. The mouse bioassay showed that <b>ciguatoxic</b> <b>fish</b> existed in all six sampling sites, and 47. 8 % of the samples were confirmed to be contaminated with CTXs. The implicated species largely belonged to Chaetodontidae, Scaridae, Holocentridae, Lutjanidae and Serranidae. The toxicities varied from 0 to 169 ng P-CTX- 1 kg 1 fish flesh according to mouse bioassay. There was no significant correlation between fish toxicity and fish weight, length and feeding habits. The accuracy rate of the Cigua-Check kit in judging toxicity or non-toxicity was up to 95. 7 % according to the mouse bioassay. However, the Cigua-Check kit and mouse bioassay differed significantly with respect to measures of toxicity. According to HPLC– MS/MS, no P-CTX- 1 was identified {{in any of the}} samples that the mouse bioassay identified as positive...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} review of 23 {{published}} case studies, the main {{objective is to}} report the emergence and epidemiology of ciguatera in the coastal cities of southern China. There was a sudden surge in ciguatera outbreaks in 2004. Ciguatera mostly occurred in the Guangdong Province. In Shenzhen, the incidence of ciguatera in 2004 {{was estimated to be}} over 7. 5 per million people. In Foshan and Zhongshan, three large outbreaks each affecting over 100 – 200 subjects (caused by tiger grouper served at banquets) accounted for the much higher incidence of ciguatera in 2004 (> 48. 7 and > 129. 9 per million people). Humphead wrasse and areolated coral grouper were the other important <b>ciguatoxic</b> <b>fish.</b> In some subjects, risk factors for increased likelihood of (severe) ciguatera were present, namely concomitant alcohol consumption and ingestion of large reef fishes and CTX-rich fish parts. To prevent large outbreaks and severe illness, large apex predators from coral reefs should never be served at banquets and the public should realize the increased risk of severe symptoms due to ingestion of CTX-rich fish parts with alcohol. The systematic collection of accurate details, implementation of risk assessment process and continuing education for the public on prevention are of obvious importance...|$|E
40|$|In {{the coastal}} {{countries}} of East Asia and Southeast Asia, ciguatera should be common {{because of the}} extensive tropical and subtropical coral reefs along the coasts and in the neighboring seas with <b>ciguatoxic</b> <b>fishes.</b> An extensive search of journal databases, the Internet and the government websites was performed to identify all reports of ciguatera from the regions. Based on the official data and large published case series, the incidence of ciguatera was higher in the coastal cities (Hong Kong, Foshan, Zhongshan) of southern China than in Japan (Okinawa Prefecture). In Singapore, ciguatera appeared to be almost unknown. In other countries, only isolated cases or small case series were reported, but under-reporting {{was assumed to be}} common. Ciguatera may cause severe acute illness and prolonged neurological symptoms. Ciguatera represents an important public health issue for endemic regions, with significant socio-economic impact. Coordinated strategies to improve risk assessment, risk management and risk communication are required. The systematic collection of accurate data on the incidence and epidemiology of ciguatera should enable better assessment and management of its risk. Much more work {{needs to be done to}} define the size threshold for important coral reef fish species from different regions, above which the risk of ciguatera significantly increases...|$|R
40|$|M. S. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2011. Includes bibliographical references. Ciguatoxins, the causative {{agent of}} ciguatera fish poisoning, are {{a group of}} potent {{neurotoxins}} produced worldwide in tropical and subtropical marine coastal ecosystems by several dinoflagellate species within the genus Gambierdiscus. It has been hypothesized that the multiple chemical congeners of ciguatoxin are lipid-soluble molecules that are biologically magnified through coral reef food webs. This study attempts {{for the first time}} to quantify this biological magnification via correlation between estimations of fractional trophic position and estimations of ciguatoxin concentrations for individual wild-caught fish within a known feeding relationship. This study focuses on the carnivorous grouper, Cephalopholis argus, and 22 potentially <b>ciguatoxic</b> prey <b>fish</b> species...|$|R
40|$|Ciguatoxins (CTXs) are lipid-soluble {{polyether}} compounds {{produced by}} dinoflagellates from the genus Gambierdiscus spp. typically found in tropical and subtropical zones. This endemic area is however rapidly expanding due to environmental perturbations, and both toxic Gambierdiscus spp. and <b>ciguatoxic</b> <b>fishes</b> have been recently {{identified in the}} North Atlantic Ocean (Madeira and Canary islands) and Mediterranean Sea. Ciguatoxins bind to Voltage Gated Sodium Channels on the membranes of sensory neurons, causing Ciguatera Fish Poisoning (CFP) in humans, a disease characterized by a complex array of gastrointestinal, neurological, neuropsychological, and cardiovascular symptoms. Although CFP is the most frequently reported non bacterial food-borne poisoning worldwide, {{there is still no}} simple and quick way of detecting CTXs in contaminated samples. In the prospect to engineer rapid and easy-to-use CTXs live cells-based tests, we have studied the effects of CTXs on the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a unicellular model which displays a remarkable conservation of cellular signalling pathways with higher eukaryotes. Taking advantage of this high level of conservation, yeast strains have been genetically modified to encode specific transcriptional reporters responding to CTXs exposure. These yeast strains were further exposed to different concentrations of either purified CTX or micro-algal extracts containing CTXs. Our data establish that CTXs are not cytotoxic to yeast cells even at concentrations as high as 1 μM, and cause an increase in the level of free intracellular calcium in yeast cells. Concomitantly, a dose-dependent activation of the calcineurin signalling pathway is observed, as assessed by measuring the activity of specific transcriptional reporters in the engineered yeast strains. These findings offer promising prospects regarding the potential development of a yeast cells-based test that could supplement or, in some instances, replace current methods for the routine detection of CTXs in seafood products...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of a clinical diagnostic scheme for ciguatera fish poisoning has been accomplished through the utilization of three assays, specifically a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for quantification, and two procedures for separation of toxic potentials, i. e., a liquid-liquid partition method and an immunoaffinity column system. For the ELISA assay, quality control parameters were evaluated including the coating binding efficiency and the binding capability of the conjugate (okadaic acid-bovine serum albumin). A 100 % recovery was obtained and reproducibility values were under 30 % coefficient of variation (CV) for concentrations from 0. 0001 to 100 ng okadaic acid/mL serum or g fish flesh. Additionally, {{the usefulness of the}} method was evaluated by determining sensitivity and specificity parameters (66. 7 and 95 %, respectively) from where the positive and negative predictive values of the test as a diagnostic instrument were assessed. A rapid extraction procedure utilizing a mixture of methanol:chloroform:water was adapted for extraction and isolation of toxins associated with ciguatera fish poisoning. The method has been optimized for the analytical evaluation of potentially <b>ciguatoxic</b> <b>fish</b> samples and human serum. Applications of the extraction procedure include the clinical diagnosis of ciguatera illness and, if leftover fish portions responsible for the intoxication event are available, analysis of the seafood. It can also be used as a tool for monitoring seafood products for food safety. Recovery values of the extraction method with and without an intermediary defatting step for spiked fish samples were of 105 and 86 %, respectively. By attaching anti-okadaic acid monoclonal antibody onto an inert matrix (AH-Sepharose®), an immunoaffinity column specific to ciguatera-related toxins has been developed, also for serum analysis, but with the potential application in other body fluids. The binding efficiency was 82 % and reproducibility values for spiked test portions at concentrations as low as 250 pg were below 10 %...|$|E
