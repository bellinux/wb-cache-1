40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a hybrid {{optimization}} approach to solving the economic dispatch (ED) problem. The objective is to minimize the total fuel cost and keep the power flows within the security limits. The idea consists in combining principles from real coded genetic algorithms (RCGAs) [1] and a parallel quasi-Newton method (QN), {{in order to find}} a better <b>compromise</b> <b>trade-off</b> and a better precision while requiring a reasonable computing time. The approach that is presented utilizes both local and global optimization algorithms to find good design points more efficiently than either could. A parallel quasi-Newton method is used to explore the space of research and exploit all local information to progress towards a better point. The proposed approach improves the equality of the solution and speed of convergence of the algorithms. The hybrid methods developed is compared with a RCGAs and a classical methods of QN. The proposed approach has been tested on the IEEE 57 bus system [2]...|$|E
40|$|Factors {{that control}} the morphologic {{variability}} of Pediastrum tetras under different experimental conditions Morphological variability and plasticity in phytoplankton populations are important for taxonomy, systematic, and evolutionary studies and are key characteristics for ecological plankton processes. The green algae Pediastrum tetras (Ehrenberg) Ralfs was studied to describe the variation in its population size structure and its response to changes in biotic (presence of Daphnia magna (Straus) and its info-chemicals) and abiotic factors (nutrient concentration). The {{results indicated that the}} nutrient supply could affect the coenobium population structure (diminishing the most common coenobium, the 8 -celled one). D. magna significantly reduced P. tetras population density, because depredation affected it by significantly decreasing the biggest coenobium’s density. In addition, info-chemicals induced a lower increase of the biggest coenobium when compared to the controls (rate of change was 45 % lower than in control cultures). Our study suggests that P. tetras coenobium size is subjected to a possible <b>compromise</b> (<b>trade-off)</b> in their natural environment: P. tetras population would tend to increase their size for a better use of nutrients and to decrease it when big herbivores are present...|$|E

40|$|It is not {{possible}} fully to resolve {{the tension between the}} doctrine of equality and the set of values that implicitly underpins our partialist practices. But neither is it possible to compartmentalise our life into different spheres to be governed by different ethical precepts: there is no simple distinction to be made between the realms of political and personal morality [...] Rather ethical decision-making is both holistically integrated and ridden with value conflict: in particular, impartiality is often in conflict with other goals like community (and, indeed, happiness) forcing upon us painful <b>compromises.</b> <b>Trade-offs</b> are inevitable. To make such trade-offs well requires us not only to accept the inevitability of compromises but also to understand how we can be committed to the equality of human worth and yet acknowledge myriad partialist obligations and commitments, some of which implicitly rank some individuals and groups as more valuable than others. This monograph aims to sustain the thesis of the inevitability of compromise with impartiality; in so doing, I hope to shed light on the values that are in conflict. Understanding these values and their relationship to conceptions of human flourishing is essential if we wish to compromise impartiality only in such circumstances and such manner as to leave in tact the integrity of our commitment to equality...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In multiobjective optimization, {{there are}} several targets that are in conflict, and thus they all cannot reach their optimum simultaneously. Hence, the {{solutions}} of the problem form a set of <b>compromised</b> <b>trade-off</b> solutions (a Pareto-optimal front or Pareto-optimal solutions) from which the best solution for the particular problem can be chosen. However, finding that best compromise solution {{is not an easy}} task for the human mind. Pareto-optimal fronts are often visualized for this purpose because in this way a comparison between solutions according to their location on the Pareto-optimal front becomes somewhat easier. Visualizing a Pareto-optimal front is straightforward when there are only two targets (or objective functions), but visualizing a front for more than two objective functions becomes a difficult task. In this paper, we introduce a new and innovative method of using three-dimensional virtual reality (VR) facilities to present multi-dimensional Pareto-optimal fronts. Rotation, zooming and other navigation possibilities of VR facilities make easy to compare different trade-off solutions, and fewer solutions need to be explored {{in order to understand the}} interrelationships among conflicting objective functions. In addition, it can be used to highlight and characterize interesting features of specific Pareto-optimal solutions, such as whether a particular solution is close to a constraint boundary or whether a solution lies on a relatively steep trade-off region. Based on these additional visual aids for analyzing trade-off solutions, a preferred compromise solution may be easier to choose than by other means. I...|$|R

40|$|Different {{conceptual}} {{perspectives and}} analytical approaches can be pursued {{in the analysis}} of climate change vulnerability. These include top-down and bottom-up approaches which frame and assess vulnerability in different ways using different methods and tools. Bottom-up approaches tend to focus on the analysis of vulnerability at the local level by addressing local conditions and processes that influence and affect the vulnerability of a system to climate change. However, performing vulnerability assessments (VA) using this type of analytical approach can be hindered and limited by numerous challenges such as the access to and quality of, data as well as the analytical <b>compromises</b> and <b>trade-offs</b> that come out of those challenges.

40|$|Abstract. The {{ubiquitous}} {{access to}} information via the Web has changed our daily life. For instance, e-commerce application allow {{for a wide variety}} of vendors to compete in a world-wide market. But with a growing number of vendors, also the amount of available offers is increasing, which in turn leads to an information flood that hampers the user experience. Skyline algorithms as introduced by the information systems community, promise to winnow suboptimal offers from electronic marketplaces. For the amount of Web data and the typical interaction style, however, the result sets are still too large and hard to manage. Recently, first approaches to integrate human decision processes like <b>compromises</b> or <b>trade-offs</b> have been designed. In this paper we will build on these approaches and introduce a novel heuristic into the skylining paradigm that not only allows for convenient Web-style user interaction, but also focuses searches on semantic clusters of offers. Thus, the view on interesting clusters is refined, whereas less interesting clusters are reduced to only the outstanding items...|$|R

40|$|Improving {{the profile}} of a {{molecule}} for the drug-discovery process requires the simultaneous optimization of numerous, often competing objectives. Traditionally, standard chemo-informatics methods ignored this problem and focused on the sequential optimization of each single biological or chemical property (ie, a single objective). This approach, known as single-objective optimization (SOOP), strives to discover a single optimal solution to the optimization problem. Implicitly, SOOP-based methods assume that the optimal solution for an objective will also be the optimum for any other objectives involved in the profiling of a molecule. However, when these other objectives are conflicting, {{as is often the case}} in drug discovery, the individual optima corresponding to the numerous objectives may vary substantially. Multi-objective optimization (MOOP) methods introduce a new approach for gaining optimality based on <b>compromises</b> and <b>trade-offs</b> among the various objectives. MOOP aims to discover a set of satisfactory compromises that can in turn be used to discover the global optimal solution by optimizing numerous dependent properties simultaneously. MOOP methods have only recently been introduced to the field of chemoinformatics.

This study investigates how remitters are able to sustain their lifestyles in a foreign country, and the sacrifices and compromises made in terms of their dual commitment to support families in Ghana and in the Netherlands. A qualitative approach using in-depth interviews was adopted in order to give research participants an opportunity to talk broadly about their lived experiences as Ghanaians residing in a foreign country and the challenges associated with sending remittances. Push factors such as political unrest, poverty, low income, and unemployment influenced movement out of Ghana. A better quality of life (better paying jobs, improved qualifications) was the major pull factor that attracted migrants to the Netherlands. Remittances from migrants in the Netherlands supported the welfare of many households in Ghana, especially in terms of improved standards of living and better access to health care and education. Sending remittances is not “a feel good gesture” only, but an obligation to the family members back in Ghana.

In response, there is growing scientific interest in novel multi-functional coastal defence structures with built-in secondary ecological and/or socio-economic benefits. To ensure research efforts are invested effectively, it is first necessary to determine what secondary benefits can potentially be built-in to engineered coastal defence structures, and further, which of these benefits would be most desirable. It is unlikely that secondary benefits are perceived in the same way across different stakeholder groups. Further, their order of priority when evaluating different options is unlikely to be consistent, since each option will present a suite of <b>compromises</b> and <b>trade-offs.</b> The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate stakeholder attitudes towards multi-functional coastal defence developments across different sector groups.

40|$|Innovative {{developments}} {{in the design of}} product and manufacturing systems are often marked by simplicity, at least in retrospect, that has previously been shrouded by restrictive mental models or limited knowledge transfer.

40|$|Blind {{deconvolution}} {{involves the}} estimation of a sharp signal or image given only a blurry observation. Because this problem is fundamentally ill-posed, strong priors on both the sharp image and blur kernel are required to regularize the solution space. While this naturally leads to a standard MAP estimation framework, performance is <b>compromised</b> by unknown <b>trade-off</b> parameter settings, optimization heuristics, and convergence issues stemming from non-convexity and/or poor prior selections. To mitigate some of these problems, a number of authors have recently proposed substituting a variational Bayesian (VB) strategy that marginalizes over the high-dimensional image space leading to better estimates of the blur kernel. However, the underlying cost function now involves both in-tegrals with no closed-form solution and complex, function-valued arguments, thus losing the transparency of MAP. Beyond standard Bayesian-inspired intuitions, it thus remains unclear by exactly what mechanism these methods are able to operate, rendering un-derstanding, improvements and extensions more difficult. To elucidate these issues, we demonstrate that the VB methodology can be recast as an unconventional MAP proble...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. An {{adaptive}} regulator with a smoothly variable high-order {{linear response}} {{controlled by a}} single real parameter, or a regulator including a single nonlinear element, is employed in an acquisition-tracking system. The requirement for good tracking is not compromised by the requirement for fast acquisition, and vice versa. The minimum phase character of the return ratio is preserved in a robust manner. Using intermediate design requirement simplifies the design procedure. A nonlinear static function is used as the exponent of a link transfer function. The transition between the modes is smooth and rapid. The transient responses are fast and without substantial overshoots. 1. Acquisition and tracking Acquisition and tracking systems, like those used in homing missiles, are designed to operate in two modes: acquisition mode when the error is initially large and gradually diminish, and tracking mode when the error is maintained small. An example of the acquisitiodtracking type is a homing control system for pointing a spacecraft-mounted camera, in which a rapid retargeting maneuver {{is followed by a}} slow precise scanning pattern to form a mosaic image. Another example is clock acquisition in the phase-locked loops of telecommunication systems and frequency synthesizers. Since optimizing of an LTI controller for the purpose of acquisition and for the purpose of tracking results in quite different systems, performance of LTI controllers cannot be best both for acquisition and tracking, and the controller design involves some <b>compromises.</b> The <b>trade-offs</b> can be better resolved in nonlinear and LTV controllers. Some of industrial acquisitiodtracking controllers are very sophisticated (like those for some hard disk drives) and are designed by teams of advanced level professionals. However, large investments in the control design not always can be justified, and many practical acquisitiodtrackin...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{defining}} characteristics of sustainability assessment {{as a form}} of impact assessment is that it provides a forum for the explicit consideration of the trade-offs that are inherent in complex decision-making processes. Few sustainability assessments have achieved this goal though, and none has considered trade-offs in a holistic fashion throughout the process. Recent contributions such as the Gibson trade-off rules have significantly progressed thinking in this area by suggesting appropriate acceptability criteria for evaluating substantive trade-offs arising from proposed development, as well as process rules for how evaluations of acceptability should occur. However, there has been negligible uptake of these rules in practice. Overall, we argue that there is inadequate consideration of trade-offs, both process and substantive, throughout the sustainability assessment process, and insufficient considerations of how process decisions and compromises influence substantive outcomes. This paper presents a framework for understanding and managing both process and substantive trade-offs within each step of a typical sustainability assessment process. The framework draws together previously published literature and offers case studies that illustrate aspects of the practical application of the framework. The framing and design of sustainability assessment are vitally important, as process <b>compromises</b> or <b>trade-offs</b> can have substantive consequences in terms of sustainability outcomes delivered, with the choice of alternatives considered being a particularly significant determinant of substantive outcomes. The demarcation of acceptable from unacceptable impacts is a key aspect of managing trade-offs. Offsets can be considered {{as a form of}} trade-off within a category of sustainability that are utilised to enhance preferred alternatives once conditions of impact acceptability have been met. In this way they may enable net gains to be delivered; another imperative for progress to sustainability. Understanding the nature and implications of trade-offs within sustainability assessment is essential to improving practice...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{effort is}} a joint program between the Departments of Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering and the Computer Science and Engineering Department at the University of Notre Dame. The purpose {{of the project was}} to develop a framework and systematic methodology to facilitate the application of Multidisciplinary Design Optimization (MDO) to a diverse class of system design problems. For all practical aerospace systems, the design of a systems is a complex sequence of events which integrates the activities of a variety of discipline "experts" and their associated "tools". The development, archiving and exchange of information between these individual experts is central to the design task and it is this information which provides the basis for these experts to make coordinated design decisions (i. e., <b>compromises</b> and <b>trade-offs)</b> - resulting in the final product design. Grant efforts focused on developing and evaluating frameworks for effective design coordination within a MDO environment. Central to these research efforts was the concept that the individual discipline "expert", using the most appropriate "tools" available and the most complete description of the system should be empowered to have the greatest impact on the design decisions and final design. This means that the overall process must be highly interactive and efficiently conducted if the resulting design is to be developed {{in a manner consistent with}} cost and time requirements. The methods developed as part of this research effort include; extensions to a sensitivity based Concurrent Subspace Optimization (CSSO) NMO algorithm; the development of a neural network response surface based CSSO-MDO algorithm; and the integration of distributed computing and process scheduling into the MDO environment.

Qualitative content analysis is used to identify, on one hand, dynamic features characterising the selection process and the role of different factors in the selection of indicators, and on the other hand, to explore the arguments used to justify the selection or removal of any given indicator. The material for this study comprises of documents relating to the meetings of the Sustainable Development Indicators Task Force and Working Group. The results are discussed with consideration for the predefined factors affecting the indicator selection (e. g. the framework and approach chosen, and data availability), while conclusions of the arguments used to justify the selection are studied in the light of the three characteristics of a good indicator; scientific validity, policy relevance and communicability. The results show that the selection process is characterised by dynamic features such as the dynamics of sustainable development and the nature of policy processes, as well as the on-going indicator development process, resulting in constant need for revision of the set. The selection of the indicators is affected by the <b>compromises</b> and <b>trade-offs</b> made in the selection process between policy- and statistics-driven approach, a thematic-framework and causal-chain framework, participatory and expert-driven approach, stable and active indicator set, and data availability and the development of the most suitable indicators.

40|$|Ultra {{poor women}} in Bangladesh are {{especially}} vulnerable to poverty and food insecurity, and they have generally been excluded from recent improvements in hunger and poverty rates in the country. An examination of the food provisioning narratives of 43 ultra poor female heads of household in Bangladesh was conducted in order to deepen understanding of this obstacle to the country's achievement of the First Millennium Development Goal. All participants were the household's sole income provider, had dependent children, and earned less than $ 1 USD per day. Women were purposively selected based on occupational group, context, and personal characteristics. Ethnographic interviews were conducted in January and February, 2008. Analysis of women's accounts of their daily food routine revealed chronic and pervasive food insecurity punctuated by acute episodes of absolute food deprivation that resulted from seasonal fluctuations in earnings, rising food prices, illness disrupting work, and healthcare costs. Women's accounts of their daily food provisioning experiences suggested <b>compromises</b> in, and <b>trade-offs</b> between, multiple basic needs {{as a result of}} inadequate income. Women were further constrained by social norms and gender roles that influenced their ability to work outside the home. Our method of inquiry led us to construct an organizing framework that extends knowledge of ultra poor women in Bangladesh's complex and multi-sphered experience of poverty and food insecurity. Based on these findings, we propose a strategy called whole person development (WPD), which seeks small adjustments to services, programs, and policies based on leverage points identified through in-depth narratives.
