5|$|In 2011, Robert Hallman, a local Hadleigh resident, {{suggested}} that the <b>community</b> <b>should</b> memorialise Murrell in some way, either by naming a local street after him or erecting a statue in {{the centre of the}} town.|$|E
5|$|Once a given astronomical {{observation}} {{has been determined}} to be a credible extraterrestrial signal, the astronomical <b>community</b> <b>should</b> be informed through the Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams of the IAU.

5|$|While {{there is}} an {{important}} need to link the economic, cultural, and ecological imperatives of development in the context of tourism enterprises, there is the key question of implementation and how the idea of sustainable tourism enterprises can be translated into reality: formulation of strategies and how they may be expected to interact with important aspects of indigenous culture. In addition to being locally directed and relevant, the planning process for the establishment of an ethno/ecotourism enterprise in an indigenous <b>community</b> <b>should</b> be strategic in nature. The use of a strategic planning process enables indigenous culture to be regarded as an important characteristic requiring careful consideration, rather than a feature to be exploited, or an incidental characteristic that is overshadowed by the natural features of the environment.|$|E

25|$|In {{reviewing}} the above cases of censorship {{where a group}} or individual challenges and/or ends up censoring this book, the reasoning is that the themes of anti-Catholic values, sex, excessive violence, adult language, and/or others are problematic for the values children of a <b>community</b> <b>should</b> have.|$|E

25|$|In September, Undersecretary of State Nicholas Burns {{called for}} the UN Security Council members and U.S. allies to help push for a third round of {{sanctions}} against Iran over the nuclear program. Meanwhile, French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner said that although {{the international community is}} focused on diplomacy, the international <b>community</b> <b>should</b> prepare for the possibility of war if Iran obtains nuclear weapons.|$|E
25|$|On 24 May 2017, the Constitutional Court {{ruled that}} current {{marriage}} laws are unconstitutional and that same-sex couples in the Taiwanese LGBT <b>community</b> <b>should</b> {{have the right}} to marry.

According to the court ruling, if amendments are not passed within two years, same-sex marriages will automatically become legal in Taiwan.|$|E

25|$|Perkasa has criticised {{the rally}} for {{threatening}} to spread chaos, {{claiming that the}} opposition will use the rally to trigger an uprising similar to Egypt and Libya. Perkasa president Ibrahim Ali also threw his support behind the EC, arguing that they had already answered demands for free and fair elections. Ibrahim Ali also warned Chinese <b>community</b> <b>should</b> avoid joining this rally and stay away from it by keeping food at home.|$|E
25|$|Instead in June 1855 the {{stockholders}} voted {{that the}} <b>community</b> <b>should</b> liquidate its assets and terminate its existence. In October community land was surveyed and divided into parcels {{ranging in size}} from 5 to 150 acres and sold at auction, together with all movable property. A total of $80,000 was raised from the sale of the North American Phalanx's land and property, with the proceeds divided and disbursed to the stockholders, who received 57.33 cents per dollar invested in the liquidation.|$|E
25|$|A Property-Owner's Association was {{established}} in 1916. In addition to overseeing local services within the development, the organization also advocated that the <b>community</b> <b>should</b> become an independent municipality. Legislation {{was passed by the}} Legislature on March 22, 1917, and a referendum approving the establishment of the borough passed on April 12. On May 11, the borough's first council was elected, along with Joseph H. Senior, who was chosen by the voters as Beachwood's first mayor. A Board of Education was formed the following year, with school transportation provided {{on the back of a}} truck outfitted with wooden benches.|$|E

25|$|Saddam {{reached out}} to other Arab governments for cash and {{political}} support during the war, particularly after Iraq's oil industry severely suffered {{at the hands of}} the Iranian navy in the Persian Gulf. Iraq successfully gained some military and financial aid, as well as diplomatic and moral support, from the Soviet Union, China, France, and the United States, which together feared the prospects of the expansion of revolutionary Iran's influence in the region. The Iranians, demanding that the international <b>community</b> <b>should</b> force Iraq to pay war reparations to Iran, refused any suggestions for a cease-fire. Despite several calls for a ceasefire by the United Nations Security Council, hostilities continued until 20 August 1988.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} change the {{incentives}} for war and make peace more appealing the UN can provide a military force by way of an enforcement mandate which provides deterrence to would-be spoilers. They can monitor the situation making the potential for surprise attack {{by one of the}} belligerents less likely to occur or by making it more difficult to carry out such an attack. A lightly-armed observer mission can also serve as an early-warning force or “tripwire” for the aforementioned enforcement mission. Aid and recognition provided to the belligerents by the international <b>community</b> <b>should</b> be made conditional and based on compliance with objectives laid out in the negotiating process. And lastly, peace dividends should be provided in the forms of jobs, public works and other benefits.|$|E
25|$|While Master Tara Singh {{confused}} Rajagopalchari's offer {{with the}} Muslim League demand {{he could see}} that any division of Punjab would leave the Sikhs divided between Pakistan and Hindustan. He espoused the doctrine of self-reliance, opposed partition and called for independence on the grounds that no single religious <b>community</b> <b>should</b> control Punjab. Other Sikhs argued that just as Muslims feared Hindu domination the Sikhs also feared Muslim domination. Sikhs warned the British government that the morale of Sikh troops in the British Army would be affected if Pakistan was forced on them. Since Hindus seemed more concerned about the rest of India than Punjab, Master Tara Singh refused to ally with them and preferred to approach the British directly. Giani Kartar Singh drafted the scheme of a separate Sikh state if India was divided.|$|E

25|$|A {{few months}} after the {{construction}} of the Bábíyyih, a large number of Bábís gathered in the village of Badasht for the purpose of seeking consensus on the core spiritual beliefs of Bábism and making plans for how the Bábí <b>community</b> <b>should</b> respond to increasing persecution and the continued imprisonment of the Báb. The Conference of Badasht was largely organized and funded by Bahá'u'lláh, and Quddús and Táhirih were also major players in the conference — an event that would mark the declared independence of the Bábí religion from Islam. During the weeks before the conference, large numbers of Bábís travelled to Mashhad from around the country, angering city authorities to the extent that Mullá Husayn's personal attendant was arrested and publicly tortured in an effort to drive Mullá Husayn from the city.|$|E
25|$|Other {{measures}} allowed certain {{reports on}} intelligence and intelligence-related matters to be deferred until either February 1, 2002 or a date after February 1, 2002 if the official involved certified that preparation and submission on February 1, 2002, would impede {{the work of}} officers or employees engaged in counterterrorism activities. Any such deferral required congressional notification before it was authorized. The Attorney General was charged with training officials in identifying and utilizing foreign intelligence information properly {{in the course of}} their duties. The government officials include those in the Federal Government who do not normally encounter or disseminate foreign intelligence in the performance of their duties, and State and local government officials who encounter, or potentially may encounter in the course of a terrorist event, foreign intelligence in the performance of their duties. A sense of Congress was expressed that officers and employees of the intelligence <b>community</b> <b>should</b> be encouraged to make every effort to establish and maintain intelligence relationships with any person, entity, or group while they conduct lawful intelligence activities.|$|E
25|$|An {{adaptation}} of the seal of the Order of St. Augustine, the seal of Villanova University {{is one of the}} campus's most ubiquitous images, adorning everything from buildings to chairs to backpacks. A ribbon carries the University motto: Veritas, Unitas, Caritas (Truth, Unity, and Charity), virtues to which every member of the Villanova <b>community</b> <b>should</b> aspire. A book symbolizes Augustine's dedication to education and the New Testament where he found Christianity. A cincture is part of the habit worn by members of the Order of Saint Augustine. Hovering above is the flaming heart, symbol of Augustine's search for God and his love of neighbors. Behind the book is the crosier – a staff traditionally held by a Bishop – commemorating Augustine's service as Bishop of Hippo. Above and behind the book are two crosses, symbolic of Augustine's conversion and the University's commitment to Christianity. Framing the central portion of the seal is a laurel wreath exemplifying victory through the pursuit of knowledge, and 1842 is the year of the University's founding. Surrounding the seal is the incorporated fide of the University: Universitas Villanova In Statu Pennsylvaniae.|$|E
