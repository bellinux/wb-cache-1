5|$|As pH {{rises above}} 0 the above yellow hydrolyzed species form {{and as it}} rises above 2–3, reddish-brown hydrous iron(III) oxide {{precipitates}} out of solution. Although Fe3+ has an d5 configuration, its absorption spectrum is not like that of Mn2+ with its weak, spin-forbidden d–d bands, because Fe3+ has higher positive charge and is more polarizing, lowering the energy of its ligand-to-metal <b>charge</b> <b>transfer</b> absorptions. Thus, all the above complexes are rather strongly colored, with the single exception of the hexaquo ion – and even that has a spectrum dominated by <b>charge</b> <b>transfer</b> in the near ultraviolet region. On the other hand, the pale green iron(II) hexaquo ion 2+ does not undergo appreciable hydrolysis. Carbon dioxide is not evolved when carbonate anions are added, which instead results in white iron(II) carbonate being precipitated out. In excess carbon dioxide this forms the slightly soluble bicarbonate, which occurs commonly in groundwater, but it oxidises quickly in air to form iron(III) oxide that accounts for the brown deposits present in a sizeable number of streams.|$|E
5|$|Cerium(IV) aqueous {{solutions}} may {{be prepared}} by reacting cerium(III) solutions {{with the strong}} oxidising agents peroxodisulfate or bismuthate. The value of E⦵(Ce4+/Ce3+) varies widely depending on conditions due to the relative ease of complexation and hydrolysis with various anions, though +1.72V is a usually representative value; that for E⦵(Ce3+/Ce) is −2.34V. Cerium is the only lanthanide which has important aqueous and coordination chemistry in the +4 oxidation state. Due to ligand-to-metal <b>charge</b> <b>transfer,</b> aqueous cerium(IV) ions are orange-yellow. Aqueous cerium(IV) is metastable in water and is a strong oxidising agent that oxidizes hydrochloric acid to give chlorine gas. For example, ceric ammonium nitrate is a common oxidising agent in organic chemistry, releasing organic ligands from metal carbonyls. In the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction, cerium oscillates between the +4 and +3 oxidation states to catalyse the reaction. Cerium(IV) salts, especially cerium(IV) sulfate, are often used as standard reagents for volumetric analysis in cerimetric titrations.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The CdSe/ZnS core/shell {{quantum dots}} (QDs) were {{synthesized}} and characterized with absorption spectrometry, photoluminescence (PL) spectrometry and transmission electron microscopy. PL quenching of colloidal CdSe/ZnS QDs {{in the presence}} of <b>charge</b> <b>transferring</b> material was studied by means of steady-state and time-resolved PL spectroscopy. With increasing <b>charge</b> <b>transferring</b> materials concentration in the CdSe/ZnS QDs solution, the PL intensity and lifetime of CdSe/ZnS QDs decrease gradually. The quenching efficiency of CdSe/ZnS QDs decrease with increasing the oxidation potential of <b>charge</b> <b>transferring</b> materials. Based on the analysis, there are two pathways in the PL quenching process: static quenching and dynamic quenching. The dynamic quenching is correlated with hole transfer from QDs to the <b>charge</b> <b>transferring</b> materials...|$|R

25|$|NdCl3 is a mauve colored {{hygroscopic}} solid whose color {{changes to}} purple upon absorption of atmospheric water. The resulting hydrate, {{like many other}} neodymium salts, has the interesting property that it appears different colors under fluorescent light- In the chloride's case, light yellow (see picture). The color difference is likely due to the <b>charge</b> <b>transfer</b> converting the Nd3+ ions into the Nd2+ state; the orange absorption band of Nd3+ decreases and the green Nd2+ absorption increases producing the yellowish color.|$|E
25|$|Exciplexes {{provide one}} of the 3 dynamic {{mechanisms}} by which fluorescence is quenched. A regular exciplex has some charge-transfer (CT) character, and in the extreme case there are distinct radical ions with unpaired electrons. If the unpaired electrons can spin-pair to form a covalent bond, then the covalent bonding interaction can lower {{the energy of the}} <b>charge</b> <b>transfer</b> state. Strong CT stabilisation has been shown to lead to a conical intersection of this exciplex state with the ground state in a balance of steric effects, electrostatic interactions, stacking interactions, and relative conformations that can determine the formation and accessibility of bonded exciplexes.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Charge</b> <b>Transfer</b> theory {{states that}} a {{lightning}} strike to a protected structure {{can be prevented}} by reducing the electrical potential between the protected structure and the thundercloud. This is done by transferring electric charge (such as from the nearby Earth to the sky or vice versa). Transferring electric charge from the Earth to the sky is done by installing engineered products composed of many points above the structure. It is noted that pointed objects will indeed transfer charge to the surrounding atmosphere and that a considerable electric current can be measured through the conductors as ionization occurs at the point when an electric field is present, such as happens when thunderclouds are overhead.|$|E
30|$|Hybrid bulk {{heterojunction}} (HBH) nanostructure {{is commonly}} adopted in organic thin film solar cells where excitons are generated first after photon absorption[1, 2]. In these photovoltaic devices, the HBH structure enables a highly efficient exciton splitting or <b>charge</b> <b>transferring</b> through an interpenetrated nanoscale heterojunction {{distributed in the}} whole active layer. If optimization treatment to phase separation is carried out or efficient photovoltaic materials are adopted, not only the exciton splitting and <b>charge</b> <b>transferring</b> but also <b>charge</b> collection {{will benefit from the}} formation of interpenetrated and continuous transportation networks for holes and electrons[3 – 5].

25|$|It {{should be}} noted that the colours of {{lanthanide}} complexes originate almost entirely from <b>charge</b> <b>transfer</b> interactions between the metal and the ligand. f → f transitions are symmetry forbidden (or Laporte-forbidden), which is also true of transition metals, however t-metals are able to use vibronic coupling to break this rule. The valence orbitals in lanthanides are almost entirely non-bonding and as such little effective vibronic coupling takes, hence the spectra from f → f transitions are much weaker and narrower than those from d → d transitions. In general this makes the colours of lanthanide complexes far fainter than those of transition metal complexes. f→f transitions are not possible for the f1 and f13 configurations of Ce3+ and Yb3+ and thus these ions are colourless in aqueous solution.|$|E
25|$|Applying {{a voltage}} at the {{electrochemical}} capacitor terminals moves electrolyte ions {{to the opposite}} polarized electrode and forms a double-layer in which a single layer of solvent molecules acts as separator. Pseudocapacitance can originate when specifically adsorbed ions out of the electrolyte pervade the double-layer. This pseudocapacitance stores electrical energy by means of reversible faradaic redox reactions {{on the surface of}} suitable electrodes in an electrochemical capacitor with an electric double-layer. Pseudocapacitance is accompanied with an electron charge-transfer between electrolyte and electrode coming from a de-solvated and adsorbed ion whereby only one electron per charge unit is participating. This faradaic <b>charge</b> <b>transfer</b> originates by a very fast sequence of reversible redox, intercalation or electrosorption processes. The adsorbed ion has no chemical reaction with the atoms of the electrode (no chemical bonds arise) since only a charge-transfer take place.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{localized}} ("intra-atomic") {{absorption of}} light which causes color for chromium and vanadium impurities, blue color in sapphires comes from intervalence <b>charge</b> <b>transfer,</b> {{which is the}} transfer of an electron from one transition-metal ion to another via the conduction or valence band. The iron can take the form Fe2+ or Fe3+, while titanium generally takes the form Ti4+. If Fe2+ and Ti4+ ions are substituted for Al3+, localized areas of charge imbalance are created. An electron transfer from Fe2+ and Ti4+ can cause {{a change in the}} valence state of both. Because of the valence change there is a specific change in energy for the electron, and electromagnetic energy is absorbed. The wavelength of the energy absorbed corresponds to yellow light. When this light is subtracted from incident white light, the complementary color blue results. Sometimes when atomic spacing is different in different directions there is resulting blue-green dichroism.|$|E
