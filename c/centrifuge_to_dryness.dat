40|$|Analytical {{methodology}} {{was developed}} and validated for the determination of spiroxamine residues in grapes, must, and wine by gas chromatography/ion trap-mass spectrometry (GC/IT-MS). Two extraction procedures were used: the first involved grapes, must, and wine extraction with alkaline cyclohexane-dichloromethane (9 + 1, v/v) solution, and the second grape extraction with acetone, dichloromethane, and petroleum ether. In both procedures, the extract was <b>centrifuged,</b> evaporated <b>to</b> <b>dryness,</b> and reconstituted in cyclohexane or 2, 2, 4 -trimethylpentane-toluene (9 + 1, v/v), respectively. Spiroxamine diastereomers A and B were determined by GC/IT-MS, and a matrix effect was observed {{in the case of}} grapes but not in must and wine. Recovery of spiroxamine from fortified samples at 0. 02 to 5. 0 mg/kg ranged from 78 - 102 % for grapes and must, with relative standard deviation (RSD) < 13 %; for red and white wines, recoveries ranged from 90 to 101 % with RSD < 9 %. The limit of quantification was 0. 02 mg/kg for grapes, must, and wine or 0. 10 mg/kg for grapes, depending on the extraction procedure used...|$|R
40|$|The {{suitability}} of isotachophoresis for {{the determination of}} quinine in different samples was investigated. The operational conditions were 0. 01 M potassium—morpholinoethanesulphonic acid (MES) (pH 6. 0) with 0. 05 % Mowiol as the leading electrolyte and ca. 0. 005 M creatinine—MES as the terminating electrolyte. The analyses were carried out at 25 µA in a 0. 2 mm I. D. PTFE capillary with UV and conductivity detection. Quinine-containing beverages were degassed by sonification and directly injected. The limit of detection was 5 mg/l with a 4 µl injection volume. The allowed concentrations could be determined with sufficient accuracy. Analgesic preparations were dissolved in a solution of 5 · 10 - 3 M MES with sonification. The quinine levels found agreed well with the declared values. The other constituents of the pharmaceuticals did {{not interfere with the}} analysis. Urine samples from volunteers were analysed after consumption of tonic. The samples were extracted with dichloromethane—isopropanol (95 : 5), vortexed, <b>centrifuged,</b> evaporated <b>to</b> <b>dryness,</b> the residue dissolved in 5 · 10 - 3 M MES and analysed. At a concentration factor of 33, the limit of detection was ca. 60 µg in 48 -h urine: 2 – 15 % of the quinine consumed was excreted as the parent compound in the first 48 h after consumption. The combination of the extraction procedure and the operational system makes the method suitable for the determination of a number of other alkaloids in physiological samples...|$|R
