Although these areas are of high ecological value less than 10 % of arid systems are conserved. This study was conducted in Paulshoek a remote village in the Leliefontein area of the Namaqualand. Historically Paulshoek has been under <b>continuous</b> selective <b>grazing</b> since the 18 th century. A fence line contrast is investigated in an area that was fenced three years ago and in one that has been exposed to heavy, <b>continuous,</b> selective <b>grazing</b> over the past century (both areas were fenced prior to fencing). The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of short-term rest on key vegetation demographic parameters as well as the physical characteristics of communal river systems. No significant differences in plant species richness were observed across the fence line. However, the numbers of plants of each species within the plots were significantly different, depending on presence or absence of grazing. The grazed sites had more species tolerant of grazing such as geophytes, annuals and toxic species such as Galenia africana. Heavy grazing in this ecosystem has resulted in increased proportions of unpalatable species with a slow reduction in the number of palatable species. Species cover was significantly reduced on the grazed sites; however, these reductions were insignificant for Lyceum cinereum species due to large standard deviations. Heavy grazing of palatable sedge species (Scirpus nodosus) resulted in significant reductions in the number of flowers of plants, in the grazed sites. Grazing not only reduced the size of the plants, it also reduced flowering, fruit set and recruitment rate. There was no significant difference in the physical and geomorphologic characteristics of the river across the fence-line.

In this paper, characteristics of vegetation and soil properties under <b>continuous</b> <b>grazing</b> and exclusion of livestock for 5 and 10 years were examined in representative degraded sandy grassland. <b>Continuous</b> <b>grazing</b> resulted in a considerable decrease in ground cover, which accelerates soil erosion by wind, leading to a further coarseness in surface soil, loss of soil organic C and N, and a decrease in soil biological properties. The grassland under <b>continuous</b> <b>grazing</b> is in the stage of very strong degradation.

We studied an 800, 000 -ha section of a threatened ecoregion in southeastern Australia. Conventional management in the region involves <b>continuous</b> livestock <b>grazing</b> with few rest periods and regular fertilizer application. By using remotely sensed data on tree cover and extensive field data on livestock grazing regimes, soil chemistry, tree diameters, and tree regeneration, we show that the region is facing a tree regeneration crisis. Under conventional management, across the region, millions of hectares of land currently supporting {{tens of millions of}} trees will be treeless within decades from now. This would have severe negative ramifications for biodiversity and key ecosystem services, including water infiltration and shade provision for livestock. However, we identified an unexpected win–win solution for tree regeneration and commercial grazing. A relatively new practice in the region is fast-rotational grazing, characterized by prolonged rest periods in between short, intensive grazing events. The probability of regeneration under fast-rotational grazing was up to 4 -fold higher than under conventional grazing, and it did not differ significantly from the probability of regeneration in ungrazed areas. In addition, trees were more likely to regenerate where soil nutrient levels were low. These findings suggest that the tree regeneration crisis can be reversed by applying low-input, fast-rotational grazing. New policy settings supporting these practices could signal a turning point for the region, from ecological decline to ecological recovery...|$|R

Livestock grazing can affect insects by altering habitat quality; however, the effects of grazing years and intensities on insect abundance and trophic level during manipulative sheep grazing are not well understood. Therefore, we investigated these effects in a large manipulative experiment from 2014 to 2016 in the eastern Eurasian steppe, China. Insect abundance decreased as sheep grazing intensities increased, with a significant cumulative effect occurring during grazing years. The largest families, Acrididae and Cicadellidae, were susceptible to sheep grazing, but Formicidae was tolerant. Trophic primary and secondary consumer insects were negatively impacted by increased grazing intensities, while secondary consumers were limited by the decreased primary consumers. Poor vegetation conditions caused by heavy sheep grazing were detrimental to the existence of Acrididae, Cicadellidae, primary and secondary consumer insects, but were beneficial to Formicidae. This study revealed variations in insect abundance and trophic level in response to <b>continuous</b> sheep <b>grazing</b> in steppe grasslands. Overall, our results indicate that continuous years of heavy- and over- sheep grazing should be eliminated. Moreover, our findings highlight the importance of more flexible sheep grazing management and will be useful for developing guidelines to optimize livestock production while maintaining species diversity and ecosystem health.
