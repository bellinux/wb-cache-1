500|$|Stuart Price (also {{known as}} Jacques Lu <b>Cont)</b> {{made the most}} {{well-known}} remix of the song, titled the Thin White Duke Mix, which was included on the CD single. The track, over eight minutes long, is carried by a guitar riff and occasional chimes. The remix received positive reviews from music critics. Aaron Mandel of Pitchfork labeled it [...] "outstanding", and John M. Cunningham of Stylus Magazine stated that it [...] "endowed [...] {{with a sense of}} grandeur". DJ InVincible from About.com viewed the remix as [...] "moody and a bit hypnotic", commenting that it is [...] "best suited for early-evening sets." [...] Armand Van Helden created two remixes, the Armand Van Helden Remix and the Armand Van Helden Dub, which use only some of the original vocals and a new bassline constructed with synthesizers and some electric guitar. Felix da Housecat created the Rude Ho Mix, which uses more bass guitar and leaves out the original background vocals by Mimi Parker until the final verse.|$|E

An extended version, [...] "The Passengerz Mix", was also included on the remix album Remixed & Revisited (2003). A promotional video for the remix was also shot.

However, he noted that [...] " [...] can't even get an actual commercial right. Maybe Madonna really is over." [...] A parody of the commercial which satirized at Madonna's age was featured on the ninth season of MADtv.|$|E
