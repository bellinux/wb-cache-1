By this time, the asking price for the building had dropped to $425,000, which {{was estimated to be}} $8000 below its real market value. The Foundation began to make major upgrades and repairs to the interior of the building. A fundraising drive in 1987 allowed 422 modern sized plush seats to be installed, lowering the theatre’s original seating capacity by almost 240. In 1989, a soundproofed cry room was installed with an independent sound system, allowing patrons with small children to come to films without worry.|$|E

Hindman's application {{was one of the}} few denied; nonetheless, he attempted to return to his former life. Politics still called to him and, although ineligible to run for office, he came out against the Reconstruction Constitution, which put him in direct conflict with reconstruction authorities. These authorities revived a treason indictment against him and had him arrested. This did not stop Hindman, who went on the political circuit and had some success building an unlikely coalition of newly freed slaves and Democrats.|$|E

After he had created significantly more material than would fit on a standard LP, an earthquake struck LA. He decided to head back to New York for some live sessions, with the help of Moogy Klingman, to lighten the mood. The final sessions were in Bearsville, where the remainder of the recording and mixing took place, and this created enough material for a double album.|$|E
40|$|It is {{generally}} believed that overseas students have more difficulty than host nationals {{in dealing with}} a wide range of social and academic situations. In the first study, 105 Asian students, 105 urban Australian students and 112 rural Australian students completed structured questionnaires, which asked them about the level of difficulty experienced in dealing With everyday social situations in Australia and their methods of coping with these problems. Asian students had more difficulty in dealing with situations related to close interpersonal relationship. In dealing with people of different status and in establishing friendships. Australian students attending university from country areas shared many of these difficulties, although to a lesser extent. In coping with these problems, Asian students engaged in information‐seeking strategies more than host nationals. In Study 2, 101 Australian and 101 ethnic Chinese students responded to four vignettes about academic situations. Chinese students reported special difficulties in dealing with tutorials not knowing how to behave or feeling <b>confidents</b> <b>enough</b> about their English to express their opinions.

However, an August 2005 ruling by federal judge Dean D. Pregerson cleared the way for Beatty to sue the Tribune. The April 2006 hearing ended without a ruling, but in July 2006, a Los Angeles judge ruled that the case can go to trial; Tribune's request to end the suit in their favor was rejected.

5|$|According to his biographer Roland Huntford, the {{references}} to Shackleton's physical breakdown made in Scott's The Voyage of the Discovery, published in 1905, reopened the wounds to Shackleton's pride. It became a personal mission that he should return to the Antarctic and outperform Scott. He began looking for potential backers for an expedition of his own; his initial plans appear in an unpublished document dated early 1906. These include a cost estimate of £17,000 (updated value £) for the entire expedition. He received his first promise of financial backing when early in 1907 his employer, Beardmore, offered a £7,000 loan guarantee (updated value £). With this in hand, Shackleton felt <b>confident</b> <b>enough</b> to announce his intentions to the Royal Geographical Society (RGS) on 12 February 1907.

5|$|Anti-Masonry {{was still}} strong in Western New York {{though it was}} petering out nationally, and when the Anti-Masons did not {{nominate}} him {{for a second term}} in 1834, Fillmore declined the Whig nomination, seeing that the two parties would split the anti-Jackson vote and elect the Democrat. Despite Fillmore's departure from office, he was a rival for state party leadership with Seward, the unsuccessful 1834 Whig gubernatorial candidate. Fillmore spent his time out of office building his law practice and boosting the Whig Party, which gradually absorbed most of the Anti-Masons. By 1836, Fillmore was <b>confident</b> <b>enough</b> of anti-Jackson unity that he accepted the Whig nomination for Congress. Democrats, led by their presidential candidate, Vice President Martin Van Buren, were victorious nationwide and in Van Buren's home state of New York, but Western New York voted Whig and sent Fillmore back to Washington.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of Carr Gomm's letters to The Times, Merrick's case {{attracted}} the notice of London's high society. One person who took a keen interest was actress Madge Kendal. Although she probably never met him in person, she was responsible for raising funds and public sympathy for Merrick. She sent him photographs of herself and employed a basket weaver {{to go to his}} rooms and teach him the craft. Other ladies and gentlemen of high society did visit him however, bringing gifts of photographs and books. He reciprocated with letters and hand made gifts of card models and baskets. Merrick enjoyed these visits and became <b>confident</b> <b>enough</b> to converse with people who passed his windows. A young man, Charles Taylor, the son of the engineer responsible for modifying Merrick's rooms, spent time with him, sometimes playing the violin. Occasionally, he grew bold enough to leave his small living quarters and would explore the hospital. When he was discovered, he was always hurried back to his quarters by the nurses, who feared that he might frighten the patients.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the defeat}} of Japan in the Second World War, anti-Japanese {{resistance}} movements in Malaya turned their attention towards the British, who had moved to quickly retake control of the colony, valuing it {{as a source of}} rubber and tin. The fact that the guerrillas were primarily Malayan-Chinese Communists meant that the British attempt to quell the uprising was supported by the Muslim Malay majority, on the understanding that once the insurgency had been quelled, independence would be granted. The Malayan Emergency, as it was called, began in 1948 and lasted until 1960, but by 1957, Britain felt <b>confident</b> <b>enough</b> to grant independence to the Federation of Malaya within the Commonwealth. In 1963, the 11 states of the federation together with Singapore, Sarawak and North Borneo joined to form Malaysia, but in 1965 Chinese-majority Singapore was expelled from the union following tensions between the Malay and Chinese populations. Brunei, which had been a British protectorate since 1888, declined to join the union and maintained its status until independence in 1984.|$|E

5|$|North Carolina's {{defense was}} {{among the best in}} the country during the regular season, {{finishing}} the year ranked second in total defense (209.3 yards per game) and fifth in scoring defense (13 points per game). The Tar Heels also were ranked second in the country in terms of rushing yards, allowing an average of 77.9 rushing yards per game during the regular season. Those statistics were due to the performance of three consensus first-team All-America defenders: defensive end Greg Ellis, linebacker Brian Simmons and cornerback Dré Bly. Ellis had 87 tackles during the season (18 for loss) to lead the team in both categories. Another defender, linebacker Kivuusama Mays, was a third-team All-American.

5|$|Unlike Darwin, Alfred Russel Wallace, {{influenced}} by the book Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation, already suspected that transmutation of species occurred when {{he began his career}} as a naturalist. By 1855, his biogeographical observations during his field work in South America and the Malay Archipelago made him <b>confident</b> <b>enough</b> in a branching pattern of evolution to publish a paper stating that every species originated in close proximity to an already existing closely allied species. Like Darwin, it was Wallace's consideration of how the ideas of Malthus might apply to animal populations that led him to conclusions very similar to those reached by Darwin about the role of natural selection. In February 1858, Wallace, unaware of Darwin's unpublished ideas, composed his thoughts into an essay and mailed them to Darwin, asking for his opinion. The result was the joint publication in July of an extract from Darwin's 1844 essay along with Wallace's letter. Darwin also began work on a short abstract summarising his theory, which he would publish in 1859 as On the Origin of Species.|$|E

30|$|Overall, the {{findings}} of this study support the studies into the psychological advantages of strategy use along with its pedagogical benefits. Among these psychological outcomes are autonomy (e.g., Chamot et al., 2010; Nguyen & Gu, 2013) and self-efficacy (e.g., Shang, 2010; Yui & Hassan, 2015), both of which belonging to intrapersonal competency. One can conclude, then, that strategy awareness, appropriate use of reading strategies, and transferring them to new situations can intensify learners’ motivation by increasing their confidence and expectation of success; when the students are <b>confident</b> and motivated <b>enough,</b> they anticipate the worth of their learning, turn to be more self-reliant on their ability to use reading strategies, and become better able to learn independently. This can further lead to an enhancement in such life qualities as autonomy and self-efficacy. Similarly, the more frequently they use strategies in reading comprehension classroom, the more confidence and personal control they will have over their reading skills, and the higher self-perception of learning outcomes they will obtain.|$|R
