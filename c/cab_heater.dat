5000|$|Lighting was {{supplied}} from a 110 V circuit {{which was}} {{fed by the}} [...] generator in parallel with 110 V lead acid batteries. The batteries were mounted in cases suspended underneath the locomotive body between the bogies. This generator also supplied power to the control circuits, exhauster, compressor and <b>cab</b> <b>heaters.</b>|$|R
50|$|Alternative Energy and Efficiency: Argonne {{develops}} both {{chemical and}} biological fuels tailored for current engines as well as improved combustion schemes for future engine technologies. The laboratory has also recommended best practices for conserving fuel; for example, a study that recommended installing auxiliary <b>cab</b> <b>heaters</b> for trucks in lieu of idling the engine. Meanwhile, the solar energy research program focuses on solar-fuel and solar-electric devices and systems that are scalable and economically competitive with fossil energy sources. Argonne scientists also explore best practices for a smart grid, both by modeling power flow between utilities and homes and by researching the technology for interfaces.|$|R
50|$|Improvements since {{manufacture}} {{have included}} the replacement of low-level Ward couplers by buckeye couplers, which has resulted in less damage from shunting accidents, and the fitting of draught excluders and <b>cab</b> <b>heaters</b> for use in winter when the locomotives operate on sections of line above ground. A number of the machines were fitted with Automatic Train Operation (ATO) equipment {{to enable them to}} work on the newly opened Victoria line. Subsequently, some have been fitted with Automatic Train Protection (ATP) equipment, compatible with the system used on the Central line, and some with ATP equipment which enables them to work with the replacement Distance-to-Go Radio (DTG-R) system on the upgraded Victoria line.|$|R
5000|$|Cab - is {{the area}} that {{contains}} a seat for the operator along with the control pedals, steering wheel, levers, switches and a dashboard containing operator readouts. The cab area may be open air or enclosed but it is covered by the cage-like overhead guard assembly. When enclosed, the cab may also be equipped with a <b>cab</b> <b>heater</b> for cold climate countries along with a fan or air conditioning for hot weather.|$|E
50|$|The Tatra T148 {{featured}} an all-steel two door {{cabin with}} a fully suspended drivers seat and a bench seat for two occupants. Special military variants included a hatch opening on the roof. The vehicle featured an independent auxiliary <b>cab</b> <b>heater</b> and included cyclone pre-cleaners {{mounted on the}} front mudguards. The vehicle's top speed was approximately 80 km/h up to 26000 kg GVM(T148 S3) or a total {{truck and trailer combination}} of up to 38000 kg GCM(T148 S3).|$|E
5000|$|The WC54 was {{designed}} to replace the WC9, WC18 and the WC27 Truck, 1/2 ton, 4Ã—4 Dodge Ambulance (G505).Based on the 3/4 Ton [...] "Beep" [...] Dodge chassis, it featured a longer wheelbase and adjusted suspension to make its ride softer. The closed sheet-metal body was made by Wayne Body works. It had room for a driver and four to seven patients plus a medic. If the fold-away bunk stretchers were used, four patients could be transported lying down.Because of its intended role, the WC54 featured a large matrix <b>cab</b> <b>heater</b> fitted on the firewall, providing comfort for patients and crew. It was fitted with a foldaway step to its rear to allow easier access for stretcher bearers and injured personnel. Early models featured a stuck out fuel filler cap which was changed to a recessed one in the later model, a modification that was retrofitted to some early model trucks.|$|E
5000|$|In some cases, a B unit is {{converted}} from an already existing A unit. The cab is either removed or has its windows blanked out (such as on CSX GE BQ23-7 units), and all non-essential equipment is removed. The {{degree to which}} this equipment is removed depends on the railroad, but may (and usually) include {{the removal of the}} speedometer, event recorder, horn, headlights, toilet, and <b>cab</b> <b>heaters.</b> This conversion was sometimes performed when the A unit had been in a collision and rebuilding the cab was not cost-effective. In some rare instances, B units were converted to incorporate a cab, such as on the Chicago & North Western Railway in the 1970s with some EMD E8B units bought from the Union Pacific. The homebuilt cabs were referred to as [...] "Crandall Cabs." [...] Also, the Santa Fe rebuilt four of its five GP7Bs to GP9us with cabs. In the Illinois Central Gulf's GP11 rebuild program, some of the engines used were ex-UP GP9Bs, and in their SD20 program, some ex-UP SD24Bs were also used. BNSF converted a former ATSF GP60B #370 into a cab unit and was renumbered to #170 in 2010.|$|R
40|$|Schneider National, Inc., SNI, has {{concluded}} the Cab Heating and Cooling evaluation of onboard, engine off idling solutions. During the evaluation period three technologies were tested, a Webasto Airtronic diesel fired heater for cold weather operation, and two {{different approaches to}} cab cooling in warm weather, a Webasto Parking Cooler, phase change storage system and a Bergstrom Nite System, a 12 volt electrical air conditioning approach to cooling. Diesel fired <b>cab</b> <b>heaters</b> were concluded to provide adequate heat in winter environments down to 10 F. With a targeted idle reduction of 17 %, the payback period is under 2 years. The Webasto Parking Cooler demonstrated the viability {{of this type of}} technology, but required significant driver involvement to achieve maximum performance. Drivers rated the technology as ''acceptable'', however, in individual discussions it became apparent they were not satisfied with the system limitations in hot weather, (over 85 F). The Bergstrom Nite system was recognized as an improvement by drivers and required less direct driver input to operate. While slightly improved over the Parking Cooler, the hot temperature limitations were only slightly better. Neither the Parking Cooler or the Nite System showed any payback potential at the targeted 17 % idle reduction. Fleets who are starting at a higher idle baseline may have a more favorable payback...|$|R
50|$|An M35A2 {{cargo truck}} with a 10000 lb PTO-driven Garwood front winch is 112 in tall, 96 in wide and 277 in long, and 13030 lb empty (13530 lb empty when {{equipped}} with the front mount winch, according to dashboard dataplates). The standard wheelbase cargo bed is 8 feet wide by 12 feet long (2.4 x 3.6 m), with only 7.25 feet of this width being flat floorspace between the stake-pockets, the tailgate rising 16 inches above {{the floor and the}} side-walls/stake-pockets rising 12 inches above the floor. The M35A2 was available with a canvas soft top or a metal hard top. Metal hard-top configurations are most often found on vehicles that have been equipped with cold-weather gear, including additional insulation in the cab, as well as engine coolant or multifuel-fired <b>cab</b> personnel <b>heaters.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Cabin is all steel {{construction}} of COE design but not tiltable, {{the access to}} the engine was provided via removable engine cowlings inside the cabin compartment. The cab came in two versions, the [...] "short" [...] two-seater two-door version and in the [...] "long" [...] "crew cab" [...] seven seater four-door version. The military specs cabs included the roof hatch {{or two in the}} case of the crew cab. All cabs were equipped with self-contained diesel <b>cab</b> <b>heater</b> which could also be used in the winter to warm up the engine before starting it. Another military feature was CTI central tyre inflation system controlled from the cab for each wheel independently and an ability to pressurize gearbox and differentials housing during water crossing. The 8x8 models had abilility to cross trenches up to 1.4 metre wide and vertical obstacles up to 0.6 metre high. Water crossing depth (static including the wave) was up to 1.4 metre (KOLOS 8x8). The vehicle top speed was 92 km/h (NT & NTH), 80 km/h (KOLOS), 70 km/h (hauler), 60 km/h (S1) @ 2000 engine rpm.|$|E
40|$|In {{future and}} also in the present time, with the focus on {{minimizing}} environmental impacts, the truck industry faces a big technological challenge in terms of meeting statutory emission legislations and also on satisfying the ever increasing demand of customers in terms of minimizing the fuel consumption. There are other challenges in terms of having a short development time and reducing the overall development cost. All the above stated challenges requires measures in terms of how computer simulations can be used to better represent a system, how different concepts can be tested, how the overall system can be tested in particular system working environment which ultimately will give a short development time with minimum cost. This thesis work basically answers the above questions in a holistic manner by considering how the truck cooling system be modeled using different CFD tools like AMESim and GT Cool to understand how different performance parameters of a cooling system vary for a steady and transient driving cycle. In this thesis work, the cooling system model has been developed for an ongoing project in Volvo Powertrain AB. The model has been developed for 16 L DST, 750 Hp, Euro 6 heavy duty truck engine with other auxiliary components like, air compressor, transmission oil cooler, <b>cab</b> <b>heater,</b> urea heater to mention a few. The model has been developed such that it can run on both steady and transient cycles by changing few elements in terms of how the input is given to the model. One of the aims of this thesis work was to evaluate the two tools mentioned above in terms of workability, implementability and reliability. Results in terms of pressure drop, mass flow rate, heat transfer rate, thermostat valve fluctuation etc. have been compared for above mentioned tools. It is pointed out that since the model has been developed for an ongoing project, the validation of the model by performing actual tests couldnâ€™t be performed because of the unavailability of the engine. In the end certain conclusions have been drawn out in terms of cooling system performance and how effective the tools were in simulating the cooling system...|$|E
