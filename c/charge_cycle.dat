5000|$|A <b>charge</b> <b>cycle</b> is {{the process}} of {{charging}} a rechargeable battery and discharging it as required into a load.

50|$|If {{batteries}} are used repeatedly even without mistreatment, they lose capacity {{as the number}} of <b>charge</b> <b>cycles</b> increases, until they are eventually considered to have reached the end of their useful life.|$|R
50|$|Glass-amorphous solid {{electrolytes}} in {{the form}} of Ba-doped Li-glass and Ba-doped Na-glass are proposed by Braga as a solution to problems identified with organic liquid electrolytes used in modern lithium-ion battery cells. Sodium is easier to obtain and more environmentally friendly than lithium, and the glass electrolyte eliminates the possibility of short circuit. Batteries based on this new design may store three times as much energy as comparable Li-ion cells. In addition, designs based upon Bragas research improve the existing limitation of 500 <b>charge</b> <b>cycles</b> in Li-ion to over 1200 <b>charge</b> <b>cycles</b> and over a wider temperature range.|$|R
50|$|The {{zinc-bromine battery}} can be {{regarded}} as an electroplating machine. During charging zinc is electroplated onto conductive electrodes, {{while at the same time}} bromine is formed. On discharge the reverse process occurs, the metallic zinc plated on the negative electrodes dissolves in the electrolyte and is available to be plated again at the next <b>charge</b> <b>cycle.</b> It can be left fully discharged indefinitely without damage.|$|E
50|$|Lead-acid {{batteries}} are relatively easier to recycle and, {{due to the}} high resale value of the lead, 99% of those sold in the US get recycled. They have much shorter useful lives than a lithium-ion battery of a similar capacity, due to having a lower <b>charge</b> <b>cycle,</b> narrowing the environmental-impact gap. In addition, lead is a toxic heavy metal and the sulphuric acid in the electrolyte has a high environmental impact.|$|E
50|$|A sulfated battery has higher {{electrical}} resistance than an unsulfated battery of identical construction. As related by Ohm's law, current is {{the ratio of}} voltage to resistance, so a sulfated battery will have lower current flow. As the charging process continues, such a battery will reach the charger's preset cut-off more rapidly, long before it has had time to accept a complete charge. In this case the battery charger indicates the <b>charge</b> <b>cycle</b> is complete, but the battery actually holds very little energy. To the user, {{it appears that the}} battery is dying.|$|E
50|$|Later an {{intelligent}} battery management system (IBMS) was provided which automatically conditioned {{one or more}} batteries, a process which ensured only complete <b>charge</b> <b>cycles</b> were applied, {{in order to avoid}} the NICAD memory effect.|$|R

40|$|In this work, we {{investigate}} scheduling problems for electrical energy storage systems and formulate an algorithm that finds an optimal solution with minimal <b>charging</b> <b>cycles</b> {{in the case}} of a single device. For the considered problems, the storage system is used to reduce the peaks of the production and consumption within (part of) the electricity distribution grid, while minimizing device wear. The presented mathematical model of the storage systems captures the general characteristic of electrical energy storage devices while omitting the details of the specific technology used to store the energy. In this way, the model can be applied to a wide range of settings. Within the model, the wear of the storage devices is modeled by either: (1) the total energy throughput; or (2) the number of switches between charging and discharging, the so-called <b>charging</b> <b>cycles.</b> For the first case, where the energy throughput determines the device wear, a linear programming formulation is given. For the case where <b>charging</b> <b>cycles</b> are considered, an NP-hardness proof is given for instances with multiple storage devices. Furthermore, several observations about the structure of the problem are given when considering a single device. Using these observations, we develop a polynomial time algorithm of low complexity that determines an optimal solution. Furthermore, the solutions produced by this algorithm also minimize the throughput, next to the <b>charging</b> <b>cycles,</b> of the device. Due to the low complexity, the algorithm can be applied in various decentralized smart grid applications within future electricity distribution grids. electrical energy storage; peak shaving; device aging; mixed integer linear program (MILP); polynomial time optimal algorith...|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} prevent cell damage, fast {{chargers}} must terminate their <b>charge</b> <b>cycle</b> before overcharging occurs. One method is to monitor the change of voltage with time. When the battery is fully charged, the voltage across its terminals drops slightly. The charger can detect this and stop charging. This method is often used with nickel-cadmium cells, which display a large voltage drop at full charge. However, the voltage drop is much less pronounced for NiMH and can be non-existent at low charge rates, which can make the approach unreliable.|$|E
50|$|Duracell further {{suggests}} that a trickle charge at C/300 {{can be used for}} batteries that must be kept in a fully charged state. Some chargers do this after the <b>charge</b> <b>cycle,</b> to offset natural self-discharge. A similar approach is suggested by Energizer, which indicates that self-catalysis can recombine gas formed at the electrodes for charge rates up to C/10. This leads to cell heating. The company recommends C/30 or C/40 for indefinite applications where long life is important. This is the approach taken in emergency lighting applications, where the design remains essentially the same as in older NiCd units, except for an increase in the trickle-charging resistor value.|$|E
50|$|A Hydrogen bromine {{battery is}} a {{rechargeable}} flow battery in which HBr {{serves as the}} system’s electrolyte. During the <b>charge</b> <b>cycle,</b> as power flows into the stack, H2 is generated and stored in a separate tank. An additional product of the chemical reaction is HBr3, which is also an electrolyte and is mixed in the same tank as the HBr. During the discharge cycle H2 is consumed and energy is generated. The H2 is combined again with the HBr3 and the system returns to its initial stage with a full tank of HBr. The electrolyte suffers no degradation during {{the process and the}} system is self contained with no emissions.|$|E

50|$|While {{the energy}} density is only around one third {{as that of}} a lithium battery, the {{distinctive}} virtue of the nickel-hydrogen battery is its long life: the cells handle more than 20,000 <b>charge</b> <b>cycles</b> with 85% energy efficiency and 100% faradaic efficiency.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Parasitic energy {{scavenging}} from human-generated vibrations with piezoelectric materials {{has long}} been studied in contrast to electromagnetic or conventional electrostatic transducers. Dielectric Elastomers (DEs) are now gaining notice as low-cost electrostatic transducers with high energy densities. However, their transduction mechanism is more intricate. DE Generators (DEGs) are functionally variable capacitors, which require fine-grained control of their <b>charging</b> <b>cycles</b> {{in order to maximize}} the energy transduced. Based on a detailed DEG model that incorporates an effective method to time the <b>charge</b> <b>cycles,</b> we contrast the energy scavenged from shoe strikes by DEGs that are virtually embedded into the shoe sole, to similar piezoelectric generators. This comparison for a plantar pressure dataset of a walking subject demonstrates a multiple order-ofmagnitude improvement in harvested energy. I...|$|R
5000|$|All {{electrochemical}} cell batteries deliver a changing voltage as their chemistry changes from [...] "charged" [...] to [...] "discharged". A nominal output voltage and a cutoff voltage are typically specified for a battery by its manufacturer. The output voltage {{falls to the}} cutoff voltage when the battery becomes [...] "discharged". The nominal output voltage is always less than the open-circuit voltage produced when the battery is [...] "charged". The temperature of a battery can affect the power it can deliver, where lower temperatures reduce power. Total energy delivered from a single <b>charge</b> <b>cycle</b> is affected by both the battery temperature and the power it delivers. If the temperature lowers or the power demand increases, the total energy delivered {{at the point of}} [...] "discharge" [...] is also reduced.|$|E
5000|$|Ni-Cd {{batteries}} {{may suffer}} from a [...] "memory effect" [...] if they are discharged and recharged to the same state of charge hundreds of times. The apparent symptom is that the battery [...] "remembers" [...] the point in its <b>charge</b> <b>cycle</b> where recharging began and during subsequent use suffers a sudden drop in voltage at that point, as if the battery had been discharged. The capacity of the battery is not actually reduced substantially. Some electronics designed to be powered by Ni-Cd batteries are able to withstand this reduced voltage {{long enough for the}} voltage to return to normal. However, if the device is unable to operate through this period of decreased voltage, it will be unable to get enough energy out of the battery, and for all practical purposes, the battery appears [...] "dead" [...] earlier than normal.|$|E

50|$|In September 2010, {{researchers}} demonstrated 250 <b>charge</b> <b>cycles</b> maintaining above 80 {{percent of}} initial storage capacity. However, some studies {{pointed out that}} Si nanowire anodes shows significant fade in energy capacity with more <b>charge</b> <b>cycles</b> caused by the volumetric expansion of Si nanowires during lithiation process. Researchers has proposed many solutions to remedy this problem: published results in 2012 showed doping impurities to the nanowire anode improves the battery performance, and it is shown that phosphorus doped Si nanowires achieved better performance compared with boron and undoped nanowire electrode; researchers also demonstrated the possibility of sustaining an 85% of initial capacity after cycling over 6,000 times by replacing nominally undoped silicon anode into a doubled-walled silicon nanotube with silicon oxide ion-permeating layer as coating.|$|R
50|$|The battery has a {{much shorter}} {{charging}} time than Li-ion batteries - in minutes rather than hours.

50|$|The most {{sophisticated}} types {{are used in}} critical applications (e.g. military or aviation batteries). These heavy-duty automatic “intelligent charging” systems can be programmed with complex <b>charging</b> <b>cycles</b> specified by the battery maker.

50|$|The {{charging}} protocol (how much voltage {{or current}} for how long, {{and what to}} do when charging is complete, for instance) depends on the size and type of the battery being charged. Some battery types have high tolerance for overcharging (i.e., continued charging after the battery has been fully charged) and can be recharged by connection to a constant voltage source or a constant current source, depending on battery type. Simple chargers of this type must be manually disconnected {{at the end of the}} <b>charge</b> <b>cycle,</b> and some battery types absolutely require, or may use a timer to cut off charging current at some fixed time, approximately when charging is complete. Other battery types cannot withstand over-charging, being damaged (reduced capacity, reduced lifetime) or overheating or even exploding. The charger may have temperature or voltage sensing circuits and a microprocessor controller to safely adjust the charging current and voltage, determine the state of charge, and cut off at the end of charge.|$|E
50|$|Vented {{cell voltage}} rises rapidly {{at the end}} of charge {{allowing}} for very simple charger circuitry to be used. Typically a battery is constant current charged at 1 CA rate until all the cells have reached at least 1.55 V. Another <b>charge</b> <b>cycle</b> follows at 0.1 CA rate, again until all cells have reached 1.55 V. The charge is finished with an equalizing or top-up charge, typically for not less than 4 hours at 0.1 CA rate. The purpose of the over-charge is to expel as much (if not all) of the gases collected on the electrodes, hydrogen on the negative and oxygen on the positive, and some of these gases recombine to form water which in turn will raise the electrolyte level to its highest level after which it is safe to adjust the electrolyte levels. During the over-charge or top-up charge, the cell voltages will go beyond 1.6 V and then slowly start to drop. No cell should rise above 1.71 V (dry cell) or drop below 1.55 V (gas barrier broken).|$|E
50|$|With the {{exception}} of the PRC 349 and UK RT 350 which are 12 Volt (nominal), The Manpack and Portable sets and their chargers were almost all nominally rated 24V DC (Direct Current) to match the British Army's choice of 24 Volts to power its vehicle systems. The Direct Current Charging Units (DCCU) was used to float charge (provide a top up charge while the set was in use) the manpack battery, while it was mounted in a vehicle, using a clip in kit for example. It could also provide a full <b>charge</b> <b>cycle</b> over 4.5 Hours from flat, switching itself out of circuit when complete. (A clip-in kit locked the radio in a convenient frame for rapid deployment when dismounting, and had the charger as part of the installation.) There were a few exceptions where 24 Volts was not used in vehicles, such as in the General Service (GS) Landrover where a 12v system was used for example. A 12 Volt DCCU was provided. The Clansman 24V 4Ah Nickel Cadmium Battery was prolific and for convenience an Alternating Current Charging Unit (ACCU) was provided for use in barracks where up to sixteen batteries could be charged simultaneously or singularly. All of these chargers worked the same, basically providing an appropriate charging current while sensing the battery temperature to detect when charging was complete, achieved by measuring the voltage across two sets of a series pair of silicon diodes in the battery itself, one series pair would sense the internal temperature of the cells the other series pair fitted close to the outer case of the battery to sense ambient temperature, the difference in temperature being used to determine the state of charge. One drawback of the Clansman 24V 4Ah NICAD is that failure of these diodes makes batteries unserviceable. Also due to partial charge cycles due to the 'memory effect' of the Nicad cells. A discharge process could have prevented such failures, but was not provided for in either the DC or ACCU. Specialists can rebuild the unserviceable Clansman NICAD battery.|$|E
