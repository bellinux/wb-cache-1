500|$|... 509 {{people had}} been killed and 1,466 injured by land mines in Croatia since the war; with these figures {{including}} 60 deminers and seven Croatian Army engineers killed during demining operations. In {{the immediate aftermath of}} the war there were about 100 civilian mine casualties per year, but this gradually decreased to below ten per year through demining, mine-awareness and education programmes. Croatia has spent approximately €450million on demining since 1998, when the process was taken over by private <b>contractors</b> <b>coordinated</b> by the Croatian Mine Action Centre. The cost to complete the demining is estimated at €500million or more. Economic loss to Croatia (due to loss of land use within suspected minefields) is estimated at €47.3million per year.|$|R

40|$|In 1999 an {{integrated}} biological control system was instituted at the U. S. Department of Energy's Hanford Site. Successes and {{changes to the}} program needed to be communicated to a large and diverse mix of organizations and individuals. Efforts at communication are directed toward the following: Hanford Contractors (Liquid or Tank Waste, Solid Waste, Environmental Restoration, Science and Technology, Site Infrastructure), General Hanford Employees, and Hanford Advisory Board (Native American Tribes, Environmental Groups, Local Citizens, Washington State and Oregon State regulatory agencies). Communication was done through direct interface meetings, individual communication, where appropriate, and broadly sharing program reports. The objectives of the communication efforts {{was to have the}} program well <b>coordinated</b> with Hanford <b>contractors,</b> and to have the program understood well enough that all stakeholders would have confidence in the work performed by the program to reduce or elimated spread of radioactive contamination by biotic vectors. Communication of successes and changes to {{an integrated}} biological control system instituted in 1999 at the Department of Energy's Hanford Site have required regular interfaces with not only a diverse group of Hanford contractors (i. e., those responsible for liquid or tank waste, solid wastes, environmental restoration, science and technology, and site infrastructure), and general Hanford employees, but also with a consortium of designated stake holders organized as the Hanford Advisory Board (i. e., Native American tribes, various environmental groups, local citizens, Washington state and Oregon regulatory agencies, etc.). Direct interface meetings, individual communication where appropriate, and transparency of the biological control program were the methods and outcome of this effort...|$|R
5000|$|... "Engineering, Procurement, and Construction" [...] (EPC) is a {{particular}} form of contracting arrangement used in some industries where the EPC Contractor is made responsible for all the activities from design, procurement, construction, to commissioning and handover of the project to the End-User or Owner. This form of contract is covered by the FIDIC Silver Book [...] containing the title words [...] "EPC/Turnkey". Other abbreviations used {{for this type of}} contract are [...] "LSTK" [...] for [...] "Lump Sum Turn Key", [...] "EPIC" [...] for [...] "Engineering, Procurement, Installation & Commissioning", and some times also [...] "EPCC" [...] which is short for [...] "Engineering, Procurement, Construction and Commissioning". Use of EPC is common e.g. by FIDIC and most Persian Gulf countries. Use of LSTK is common in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Use of EPCC is common in Qatar and some other countries e.g. by Qatar Petrolem. Therefore, an EPC, LSTK or EPCC are all same types of contracts a typical well known example of which is the Silver Book of FIDIC.

40|$|This study {{provides}} {{the results of}} a survey of major contractors engaged in the Sri Lankan construction industry. It is aimed at identifying common risk elements affecting construction industry projects, determining how they are apportioned between the owner and the contractor, and quantifying and ranking their significance. The previous studies provided a list of 52 risk elements {{and with the help of}} a pilot study it was reduced to manageable 25 risk elements having a great relevance to the Sri Lankan construction industry. Altogether 72 respondents selected from among major contractors in Sri Lanka (C 1 to C 4) were involved in the questionnaire survey of the study. The analysis of the results show that only some risk elements are apportioned more to one party (apportionment of at least 65 %) either contractor or owner. Shortage of labor, materials, tools and equipment (82 %), Low productivity of labor and equipment due to complexity of work (78 %), Labor disputes & trade union action (76 %), Delays due to sub-contractors, suppliers and other bodies (74 %), Difficulty to <b>coordinate</b> with sub- <b>contractors</b> (74 %), Corruption (70 %), Delayed payment by owner (68 %), and Accidents (66 %) are apportioned more to contractors whereas, Delay in approvals and permits (70 %), is apportioned more to the owner than to the contractor. The risk elements were ranked according to their significance and the most significant risk elements are, in descending order of significance are; Shortage of labor, materials, tools and equipment, inaccurate and incomplete design, Financial failure resulting from owner and contractor, Substandard quality of work. The results indicate that contractors perceive that risks are apportioned disproportionately more towards them. The implication of this is that naturally contractors tend to quote higher bid prices to cover their potential risks...|$|R
40|$|The CEV TPS Advanced Development Project (ADP) is a NASA {{in-house}} {{activity for}} providing two heatshield preliminary designs (a Lunar direct return {{as well as}} a LEO only return) for the CEV, including the TPS, the carrier structure, the interfaces and the attachments. The project s primary objective is the development of a single heatshield preliminary design that meets both Lunar direct return and LEO return requirements. The effort to develop the Lunar direct return capable heatshield is considered a high risk item for the NASA CEV development effort due to the low TRL (approx. 4) of the candidate TPS materials. By initiating the TPS ADP early in the development cycle, the intent is to use materials analysis and testing in combination with manufacturing demonstrations to reduce the programmatic risk of using advanced TPS technologies in the critical path for CEV. Due to the technical and schedule risks associated a Lunar return heatshield, the ADP will pursue a parallel path design approach, whereby a back-up TPS/heatshield design that only meets LEO return requirements is also developed. The TPS materials and carrier structure design concept selections will be based on testing, analysis, design and evaluation of scalability and manufacturing performed under the ADP. At the TPS PDR, the preferred programmatic strategy is to transfer the continued (detailed) design, development, testing and evaluation (DDT&E) of both the Lunar direct and LEO return designs to a government/prime <b>contractor</b> <b>coordinated</b> sub-system design team. The CEV prime contractor would have responsibility for the continued heatshield sub-system development. Continued government participation would include analysis, testing and evaluation as well as decision authority at TPS Final System Decision (FSD) (choosing between the primary and back-up heatshields) occurring between TPS PDR and TPS Critical Design Review (CDR). After TPS FSD the prime CEV contractor will complete the detailed design, certification testing, procurement, and integration of the CEV TPS...|$|R
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The U. S. military has long used contractors to provide supplies and services to deployed U. S. forces {{as well as for}} post-conflict support. The Department of Defense's (DOD) use of contractors has grown significantly {{to the extent that the}} force in Iraq is composed of approximately 143, 000 military personnel and 149, 000 DOD contractor personnel. Congress,GAO, and others have frequently reported on or expressed concerns about the long-standing challenges that DOD faces when managing operational contract support. These challenges include a failure to adequately plan for the use of contractors, poorly defined or changing requirements, a lack of deployable contracting personnel with contingency contracting experience, and difficulties in <b>coordinating</b> contracts and <b>contractor</b> management across military services in joint contingency environments. Furthermore, as we have previously reported, DOD has not provided a sufficient number of trained contract oversight and management personnel in contingency operations, and visibility of contracting activities and contractors has been limited. As we have testified, problems associated with DOD's inability to overcome these challenges have resulted in higher costs, schedule delays, unmet goals, and negative operational impacts. To respond to these concerns, Congress enacted an amendment to title 10 of the U. S. Code adding section 2333, which directed the Secretary of Defense in consultation with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to develop joint policies by April 2008 for requirements definition, contingency program management, and contingency contracting during combat and post-conflict operations. In January 2008, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, hereafter referred to as the NDAA FY 08, amended section 2333 to add a new subparagraph directing that these joint policies provide for training of military personnel outside the acquisition workforce who are expected to have acquisition responsibilities including oversight of contracts or contractors during combat operations, post-conflict operations and contingency operations. Additionally, NDAA FY 08 directed GAO to review DOD's joint policies and determine the extent to which those policies and the implementation of such policies comply with the requirements of section 2333 of title 10 of the U. S. Code. This report responds to congressional direction included in section 849 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 (NDAA FY 08). Our objectives were to determine the extent to which (1) DOD has complied with section 2333 of title 10 of the U. S. Code to develop joint policies for (a) requirements definition, (b) contingency program management, (c) contingency contracting, and (d) training for personnel outside the acquisition workforce; and (2) DOD has implemented these joint policies. ...|$|R
