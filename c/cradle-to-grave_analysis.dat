Waste management focuses on processing waste after it is created, concentrating on re-use, recycling, and waste-to-energy conversion rather than eliminating the creation of waste in the initial phases of production. Waste minimisation involves efforts to minimize resource and energy use during manufacture. For the same commercial output, usually the less materials are used, the less waste is produced. Waste minimisation usually requires knowledge of the production process, <b>cradle-to-grave</b> <b>analysis</b> (the tracking of materials from their extraction to their return to earth) and detailed knowledge of the composition of the waste.|$|E
40|$|Current {{practice}} {{adopted by}} highway agencies {{with regards to}} pavement management, has mostly consisted of employing life cycle costs analysis (LCCA) systems to evaluate the overall long-term economic efficiency of competing pavement design and maintenance and rehabilitation (M&# 38;R) activities alternatives. This way of supporting the decision-making process {{as it relates to}} pavement management, in which little or no importance is given to environmental considerations, suggests the need for pavement management decision-support systems (DSS), which, by integrating multi-disciplinary and complementary pavement life cycle modelling approaches, enable the decision makers (DMs) to properly account for, consider and assess the lifetime impacts of their decisions and practices regarding sustainability goals and targets. This only can be achieved by employing techniques and tools provided with a comprehensive and wide-scoped <b>cradle-to-grave</b> capacity of <b>analysis.</b> To address this multifaceted problem, this paper presents a comprehensive and modular multi-objective optimization (MOO) -based pavement management DSS which comprises three main components: (1) a MOO module; (2) a comprehensive and integrated pavement life cycle costs - life cycle assessment (LCC-LCA) module that covers the whole life cycle of the pavement; and (3) a decision-support module. The potential of the proposed DSS is illustrated with one case study consisting of determining the optimal M&# 38;R strategy for a one-way flexible pavement section of a typical Interstate highway in Virginia, USA, which yields the best trade-off between the following three often conflicting objectives: (1) minimization of the present value (PV) of the total life cycle highway agency costs (LCHAC); (2) minimization of the PV of the life cycle road user costs (LCRUC); and (3) minimization of the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions (LCGHG). In comparison to the traditional maintenance strategy, the proposed DSS suggest a maintenance plan that reduces LCHAC by 15 %, LCRUC by 28 % and LCGHG by 26 %...|$|R

40|$|Presented at the 248 th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society (ACS), San Francisco, California on August 11, 2014. In the {{pesticide}} industrial sector, an emerging issue is stakeholder and customer {{interests in the}} life cycle profile of specific agricultural chemicals, often known as the carbon footprint. The origins of this issue are a general expectation that manufacturers 1) have begun to understand the broader aspects of their products (referred to as a <b>cradle-to-grave</b> <b>analysis),</b> 2) have a quantitative profile of these life cycles, and 3) can, as appropriate, show sustainability improvement over time. While {{this is a new}} issue, it does not displace the significant progress of the agricultural chemicals industry in such developments as efficacy, lower toxicity, worker health, etc. This paper addresses the challenges of conducting life cycle analyses of complex chemicals with inherently large supply chains. The design-based life cycle methodology is used, which provides substantial transparency, science-based rules, and to some extent global manufacturing implications. Seven agricultural chemical life cycles (herbicides, fungicides, and insecticides, for the National Agriculture and Food Research Organization of Japan) have been done and will be used to help explain the benefits of such life cycle analyses...|$|E

The number of people using bicycles has been increasing in several European countries as well as the interest in manufacturing new types of bicycles with different materials. The main objective {{of this paper is to}} evaluate the complete life cycle of a bicycle (<b>cradle-to-grave</b> <b>analysis)</b> and to quantify which components have the highest environmental impact. The production, maintenance, use and waste scenarios were modelled using the life cycle assessment software SimaPro. The use of bicycles in two different realities in terms of bicycle modal share (Portugal and The Netherlands) was considered. Then, some “what-if” scenarios were performed, in which some bicycles components were replaced with different materials, with the objective to decrease the environmental impact of the product itself. Aluminium, steel, wood and carbon fiber were tested in SimaPro. Results indicate that the components made in aluminium have the highest environmental impact. On the other hand, a bicycle with carbon fiber shows the lowest impact for the majority of the environmental categories. When evaluating the entire life cycle of the bicycle, the production phase has the highest negative impact...|$|E
40|$|Although the {{conventional}} farming system (CV) for apple production remains the common practice worldwide, the organic farming system (OF) {{is becoming increasingly}} important. Few global assessments of {{the environmental impacts of}} organic orchard systems are currently available. In this work, we analyse the weak and strong points of the environmental performance of the growing phase of two organic and one conventional apple orchard, using a pluri-annual dataset from experimental orchard systems located in the Middle Rhone valley in France, with life cycle analysis (LCA). LCA, also referred to as <b>cradle-to-grave</b> <b>analysis,</b> allows a quantitative and global evaluation of an orchard’s environmental performance. The analysis was performed using the SALCA (Swiss Agricultural Life Cycle Assessment) method (SALCA-Crop V 3. 1, adapted for pome fruit) and included relevant impact categories based on characterisation models derived mainly from the EDIP 97 and CML 01 methods, as well as those developed by Agroscope (ART). Seven impact categories that included ecotoxicity and human toxicity, as well as energy consumption and other environmental impact categories, were calculated and are discussed here. The OF systems appeared to have less of an impact than {{the conventional}} system, considering the surface-based functional unit (ha/year). However, the basic substitution of conventional with organic inputs or mechanised activities was not sufficient to radically improve the overall environmental performance of the orchard systems.

40|$|The {{degreasing}} or defatting phase {{represents one}} of the most environmentally impacting steps in the entire leather manufacturing cycle. Indeed, the chemical compounds conventionally employed during this activity are significantly impacting, mainly as a consequence of their scarcity and slow biodegradability. The present work represents a limited part of the European Life+ project titled, “Environmentallyfriendly natural products instead of chemical products in the degreasing phase of the tanning cycle”, which aims at proposing innovative degreasing formulations based on chemical compounds of natural origin. Particularly, newly synthesised lactose derivatives were thought to partially replace ethoxylated alcohols typically employed in commercial products. The aim of the present work is to present detailed and quantitative environmental assessments of the laboratory-scale preparation of the most promising formulation tested, designated EDF 20. This innovative formulation is based on a piperazinyl hydrochloride derivative of lactose, for which a four-step synthetic protocol has been optimized, and which was then mixed, in the last preparatory step, with further components to obtain an aqueous degreasing formulation with a reduced ethoxylated alcohol content. A preliminary environmental assessment limited to the chemical point of view was performed by employing the software EATOS (Environmental Assessment Tool for Organic Syntheses) in order to evaluate all of the chemicals used in the synthesis of the lactose derivative and in its work-up procedures. In order to assess the whole environmental and human health impacts associated with the production of the defatting agent, thus performing a <b>cradle-to-grave</b> <b>analysis,</b> the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology was applied, with the aim of furnishing quantitative and trustworthy data also related to further fundamental impact categories, such as those comprising energy consumption. This work represents the first example of an environmental assessment related to one efficient alternative to the conventional degreasing procedure within the leather manufacturing cycle. It will hopefully smooth the way towards the quantitative assessments of further alternative defatting procedures/ products, which are proposed practically on a daily basis with the aim of significantly reducing the environmental loads of this tremendously impacting industrial activity...|$|E
40|$|The final {{publication}} {{is available}} at Springer via [URL] 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. Purpose: Carbon-fibre-reinforced polymers (CFRP) have been developed by the aviation industry to reduce aircraft fuel burn and emissions of greenhouse gases. This study presents a life cycle assessment (LCA) of an all-composite airplane, based on a Boeing 787 Dreamliner. The global transition of aircraft to those of composite architecture is estimated to contribute 20 – 25  % of industry CO 2 reduction targets. A secondary stage of the <b>cradle-to-grave</b> <b>analysis</b> expands the study from an individual aircraft to the global fleet. Methods: An LCA was undertaken utilising SimaPro 7. 2 in combination with Ecoinvent. Eco-indicator 99 (E) V 2. 05 Europe EI 99 E/E was the chosen method to calculate {{the environmental impact of}} the inventory data. The previously developed aviation integrated model was utilised to construct a scenario analysis of the introduction of composite aircraft against a baseline projection, through to 2050, to model CO 2 emissions due to their particular relevance in the aviation sector. Results and discussion: The analysis demonstrated CFRP structure results in a reduced single score environmental impact, despite the higher environmental impact in the manufacturing phase, due to the increased fossil fuel use. Of particular importance is that CFRP scenario quickly achieved a reduction in CO 2 and NO x atmospheric emissions over its lifetime, due to the reduced fuel consumption. The modelled fleet-wide CO 2 reduction of 14 – 15  % is less than the quoted emission savings of an individual aircraft (20  %) because of the limited fleet penetration by 2050 and the increased demand for air travel due to lower operating costs. Conclusions: The introduction of aircraft based on composite material architecture has significant environmental benefits over their lifetime compared to conventional aluminium-based architecture, particularly with regards to CO 2 and NO x a result of reduced fuel burn. The constructed scenario analyses the interactions of technology and the markets they are applied in, expanding on the LCA, in this case, an observed fleet-wide reduction of CO 2 emission of 14 – 15  % compared to an individual aircraft of 20  %...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide an {{improved}} (up-to-date) insight into the environmental burden of textiles made of the base materials cotton, polyester (PET), nylon, acryl, and elastane. The research question is: Which base material and which life cycle stage (cradle-to-gate as well as cradle-to-grave) have the biggest impact on the environment? Methods: Life cycle inventory (LCI) data are collected from the literature, life cycle assessment (LCA) databases, and emission registration database of the Dutch government, as well as communications with both manufacturing companies of production equipment and textile companies. The output of the calculations is presented in four single indicators: Ecocosts 2012 (a prevention-based indicator), CO 2 equivalent (carbon footprint), cumulative energy demand (CED), and ReCiPe (a damage-based indicator). Results and discussion: From an analysis of the data, it becomes clear that the environmental burden is not only a function of the base materials (cotton, PET, nylon, acryl, and elastane) but also of the thickness of the yarn (for this research, the range of 50 – 500 dtex is examined). The authors propose that the environmental burden of spinning, weaving, and knitting is a function of 1 /yarn size. The <b>cradle-to-grave</b> <b>analysis</b> from raw material extraction to discarded textile demonstrates that textiles made out of acryl and PET have the least impact on the environment, followed by elastane, nylon, and cotton. The use phase has less relative impact than it is suggested in the classical literature. Conclusions: The impact of spinning and weaving is relatively high (for yarn thicknesses of less than 100 dtex), and from the environmental point of view, knitting is better than weaving. LCA on textiles can only be accurate when the yarn thickness is specified. In case the functional unit also indicates the fabric per square meter, the density must be known. LCA results of textile products over the whole value chain are case dependent, especially when dyeing and finishing processes and the use phase and end-of-life are included in the analysis. Further LCI data studies on textiles and garments are urgently needed to lower the uncertainties in contemporary LCA of textile materials and products...|$|E
40|$|The main {{topic of}} this thesis {{has been a}} study of the {{environmental}} impacts of the ventilation system in Abels Hus, an office building in Trondheim, from a life cycle perspective. The objective of the study has been to develop a methodology for easier Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of buildings based on Building Information Models (BIM) and the scope has been a <b>cradle-to-grave</b> <b>analysis.</b> The background for the study is the increased complexity of technical installations in buildings leading to a need for reassessment of the share of impacts that belong to embodied emissions, while also taking into consideration more impact categories than just climate change. Additionally, the conventional LCA methodology does not sufficiently reflect the time-dependent impact of greenhouse gases when considering systems with such a long lifetime as a building. Thus, a dynamic methodology is applied to better encompass the long lifetime of buildings. A literature study on Life Cycle Assessments of buildings revealed that the use phase constitutes the majority of impacts throughout the buildings lifetime. To explore these findings a BIM model has been used to find inventory data on a ventilation system. A supplied dataset, combined with environmental product declarations and component data sheets was used to create the inventory for the embodied impacts in the building components, and energy simulations gave the energy use throughout the use phase of the building. To model impacts to climate change for construction and demolition services, input output analysis was applied with the use of modified input-output tables for construction. Scenario analyses were performed through variations in the electricity supply mix. Four supply mixes were analysed: The Norwegian Mix, Nordic, EU very optimistic, and EU realistic-optimistic. Recycled content of the steel in the ventilation system was also varied. Uncertainties of the embodied impacts were assessed through Monte Carlo simulation. The results show that energy use constitutes the majority of the impacts for most impact categories, but embodied impacts have a larger share of emissions than previously shown in literature, although total impacts coincide with literature data. The dynamic LCA gives a 33 % lower result in climate change impacts than the conventional LCA, and it better shows when in the life cycle the impacts occur, while also keeping consistent with the given time horizon. The ventilation impacts from energy consumptions in the use phase constitute 22 %- 33 % of total emissions from energy consumption. Policy makers should consider a reduction in embodied impacts of ventilation systems, through increased recycled content of materials, and alternative ventilation methods like hybrid natural ventilation. Without a standardization of BIM models, LCA through BIM is very time consuming, but with the recent developments in BIM standards, these could prove a viable tool for environmental assessments in the early design stages...|$|E
40|$|The global Fashion {{industry}} is significant, worth 300 billion US Dollars and employs more than 26 million workers (University of Cambridge, 2006). However the {{industry is}} changing, due to devaluation of design {{on the one hand}} and economic pressure and re-evaluation of design ethics coupled with consumer integrity on the other. This paper addresses the emerging retail landscape, where production and consumption practices are separating like oil and water. We are witnessing a paradigm shift with regard to business models, where the new consumer desires and is demanding high value, performance and smart ethical fashion. These consumers expect co-creation, innovation, opportunities through customisation, supply chain transparency and business integrity, to build an ongoing relationship with a retailers ‘no worry’ brand. They are generation ‘C’, who often purchase from virtual retail environments, and who understand the relevance of design for behavioural change, and the true cost of products both in material and human terms. Sustainability, or people, profit, planet, inherent in the bedrock of a cradle-to-cradle fashion textiles system of the near future. In New Zealand, fashion is worth 326 million NZD in exports (NZTE, 2008) and as elsewhere the insatiability of the mainstream fashion consumer is being satisfied by an escalation of ‘pile it high, sell it cheap’ outlets. Here the ‘dollar a day’ dress (Marks, 2005) made by a significant silent workforce of slave labourers, refugees, illegal workers and children exist in the black manufacturing economy, even here in the back streets of Auckland (Cumming, 2002). Consumer responses during the recent recession (Euromonitor, 2010; Vass, 2009) are poles apart, customers buying wisely what is needed, with integrity, in contrast to the pressure of ‘buy one, get one free’ and the frenzy of a fashion bargain. With these attitudes working in tandem, this paper predicts an unsustainable global manufacturing fashion/textile industry will continue to run parallel to an emerging model of fashion/textiles design and business systems. Fashion textile literature and theory relating to sustainability is often emotive, fragmented and vague. This positioning paper argues that a polarisation, or separation, of the producer, consumer, disposal and reuse markets is already taking place in the best and the worst of the industry, on every high street and mall. To illustrate this division we have focused on two fictitious adjacent clothing stores in the high street of 2018 : we predict a continuation of the unsustainable global manufacturing fashion textile industry as Shop Two; running in parallel to an emerging new paradigm of fashion and textiles found in Shop One. This thesis has been developed by focussing on issues of sustainability, comparing existing fashion/textile retail supply and disposal chains and analysis of the cause-and-effect, using guiding principles from <b>cradle-to-grave</b> <b>analysis</b> and systemic reasoning. It is underpinned by, and reflects upon the knowledge of current local and global fashion/textile design business practice and data which forms the context for thinking through design to enable change...|$|E
40|$|A {{sustainable}} {{food supply}} chain (FSC) is at the nexus of several critical global challenges including hunger, resource scarcity, climate change, poverty, energy security and economic growth. However, managing FSC resources in a sustainable manner is complex and data to support this goal is lacking. This dissertation addressed four knowledge gaps by applying a variety of analytical and experimental tools to the New York State FSC. First, a <b>cradle-to-grave</b> <b>analysis</b> of the New York State FSC was conducted. Resources leaving the FSC from primary production (post-harvest) through to consumption were defined and characterized. Surveys and literature were used to estimate FSC resources and factors were provided for several sectors and sub-sectors including the Educational sector. Material flows through the utilization pathways in New York State were analyzed. It was estimated that over 3. 5 million t/yr of solid resources were generated. Resource utilization pathways including donation were estimated to treat approximately 6 % of these resources. An additional 22 million m 3 /yr of low solid resources primarily from the food processors was also estimated and analyzed. In the next chapter, climate change impacts of utilization pathways emerging in the State were analyzed. Two comprehensive lifecycle assessments (LCAs) were conducted to assess climate change impacts. The first was based upon primary data collected from the largest on-farm anaerobic digester in the State, which co-digests dairy manure and industrial food wastes. The results showed a net negative climate change of 37. 5 kg CO 2 e/t influent processed {{when compared to the}} reference case. Displacement of grid electricity provided the largest reduction, followed by avoidance of alternative food waste disposal options and reduced impacts associated with storage of digestate vs. undigested manure. Sensitivity analysis showed that using feedstock diverted from high impact disposal pathways, control of digester emissions, and managing digestate storage emissions were opportunities to improve climate change benefits. The second LCA was based upon a small-scale, distributed waste-to-ethanol process. This analysis was based upon data from an operating pilot plant facility, co-fermenting industrial and retail FSC resources. The climate change impacts for the processing phase were estimated to be comparable to those associated commercial ethanol production, however when considering the avoidance waste disposal for FSC resources used as feedstock, the result was a net negative impact of 338 kg CO 2 e/MJ fuel produced. The following chapter evaluated the potential of several significant New York State FSC resources as feedstock for biogas production. Twenty-four source-separated, commercial substrates from the retail and food processing sector were characterized and tested in bench-scale bio-methane potential (BMP) tests. Substrates were also combined with dairy manure and other substrates to assess synergistic or antagonistic effects associated with co-digestion. Key bio-methane kinetic parameters including bio-methane potential, apparent hydrolysis rate constant and co-digestion indices were reported. Substrates with high fat content demonstrated higher potential for bio-methane generation. Substrates rich in readily hydrolysable carbohydrates and fats showed more complete bio-degradation. Measured bio-methane potential was the product of both of these factors. Bio-methane production of co-digested substrates was close to that of the weighted average of the individual substrates with a slight synergistic bias (- 5 %/+ 20 % on average). However, co-digestion generally resulted in an increase in apparent hydrolysis rate relative to that predicted by the combination of individual substrates...|$|E
40|$|Proper {{management}} of wastewater {{is a challenge}} for the cities in developing countries. The discharges of untreated wastewater into the urban rivers have huge impacts on public health as well as entire ecosystem of the earth. Therefore, treatment of wastewater {{is essential for the}} reduction of impacts on environment. Wastewater treatment plants remove the pollutant from the wastewater and thus reduce the pollutant load on the receiving water body. However the raw materials and energy required to build and operate the wastewater treatment systems also contribute to environmental burdens. Thereafter, the net environmental benefit of the wastewater treatment system can only be perceived by taking into account entire life cycle phases of the wastewater treatment system viz; construction, operation and demolition phases. In this study, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) {{has been used as a}} tool for the sustainability assessment of small-scale decentralized wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) commonly used in developing countries. LCA is supportive to analyze the environmental burdens of WWTP that need to be a part of decision-making process towards sustainability. Life cycle assessment is known as <b>cradle-to-grave</b> <b>analysis.</b> LCA is a compilation and evaluation of the inputs, outputs and the potential environmental impact of a product system throughout its life cycle. The overall objective of the study is to analyze the environmental performance of the representative small-scale decentralized sanitation system. In this study three-wastewater treatment scenario that consists of a combination of different small scale decentralized treatment methods are considered. The design capacities of the treatment modules used in the present study are 10 m 3 /day and 50 m 3 /day. The three Decentralized Wastewater Treatment (DEWATS) modules considered for the study are: 1) module 1 (DM 1) consisting of Settler (S), Anaerobic Baffled Reactor (ABR), and Planted Gravel Filter (PGF), 2) module 2 (DM 2) consisting of S, PGF and Collection Tank (CT) and 3) module 3 (DM 3) consisting of S and PGF. The Life Cycle Assessment was carried out as per ISO standards 14040 - 14044. In this study only the construction and operational phase was taken into account. The functional unit for this study is the treatment of wastewater generated by person equivalent over a period of 20 years. In all modules, the greenhouse gas contribution (GWP) from the construction phase is 95 % and 5 % from operational stage. Acidification potential (AP) and Ozone layer depletion potential (ODP) are found to be 100 % in construction periods. Among the treatment units, ABR has significant contribution to the eutrophication potential (EP). The other units like PGF, S and CT are responsible to the impact categories of AP, ODP and GWP. The study shows that configuration of the treatment units have an impact in the environmental performance. However, the more units the more environmental load is observed during the construction phase. On the other hand, increased in the units or treatment steps or modules increases the performance of system and hence decreases the environmental impacts of the whole system and vice versa. The production process of cement clinker, electricity, natural gas, brick, bituminous coal and transportation are responsible for the main impact during the construction phase. Based on the evaluation of three DEWATS modules, it cannot be said, which module is best, but the findings herein can support the decision-making process towards more sustainable DEWATS system...|$|E
