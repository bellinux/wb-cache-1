5|$|In 1983, {{classification}} for swimmers with {{cerebral palsy}} was governed by CP-ISRA. There were five cerebral palsy classifications. Class 1 competitors <b>could</b> <b>compete</b> in the 25 metre freestyle event with flotation devices with or without flotation devices. Class 2 competitors <b>could</b> <b>compete</b> in the same events, but only against class 2 competitors. That year, 80 to 85 per cent of all competitors {{with cerebral palsy}} competed in the same classification in international competitions.|$|E

The game was also made available at Comiket 73 between December 21 and December 23, 2007.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{many women}} of her era, Stanton was {{formally}} educated. She attended Johnstown Academy {{until the age}} of 16, where she studied Latin, Greek, mathematics, religion, science, French, and writing. At the Academy, she enjoyed being in co-educational classes where she <b>could</b> <b>compete</b> intellectually and academically with boys her age and older. She won several academic awards and honors, including the award for Greek language.|$|E

The 400 m hurdles was not {{introduced}} for women until 1984 in Los Angeles and then she <b>could</b> not <b>compete</b> because of the Soviet boycott and by the 1988 season she had retired so she <b>could</b> not <b>compete</b> in Seoul either.|$|R

5|$|No {{one player}} {{dominated}} the event during this period. Only five players, Frank Parker, Jaroslav Drobný, Tony Trabert, Nicola Pietrangeli and Roy Emerson, won multiple titles. The tournament became an Open in 1968, as professional players {{were allowed to}} compete with amateurs, previously only amateurs <b>could</b> <b>compete</b> in the Grand Slam tournaments. The tournament, won by Australian Ken Rosewall, was the first Grand Slam tournament to be played in the Open era.|$|E
5|$|The GWR began {{experimenting with}} the {{electric}} lighting in 1880, leading to Paddington being decorated with Christmas lights that year. Although {{the system was}} unreliable, it spurred the GWR on to a more ambitious lighting scheme in 1886, in which a 145V AC supply could light the terminus, office, goods yard and Royal Oak and Westbourne Park stations. It was praised for its scale and showing that electricity <b>could</b> <b>compete</b> with gas lighting on the same scale.|$|E
5|$|The {{company also}} joined {{the joint venture}} Commuter Service along with other Norwegian {{regional}} airlines, Coast Aero Center, Mørefly and Trønderfly. The intention {{was to create a}} cooperative company which <b>could</b> <b>compete</b> in a more diversified market. The group's lawyer stated that the organizational structure among regional airlines was 15 years out of date and that the group would take market shares in a growing market, especially by starting new niche direct services.|$|E

5|$|Between 1862 and 1867, Liverpool held {{an annual}} Grand Olympic Festival. Devised by John Hulley and Charles Melly, these games {{were the first}} to be wholly amateur in nature and {{international}} in outlook, although only 'gentlemen amateurs' <b>could</b> <b>compete.</b> The programme of the first modern Olympiad in Athens in 1896 was almost identical to that of the Liverpool Olympics. In 1865 Hulley, Brookes and E.G. Ravenstein founded the National Olympian Association in Liverpool, a forerunner of the British Olympic Association. Its articles of foundation provided the framework for the International Olympic Charter. In 1866, a national Olympic Games in Great Britain was organised at London's Crystal Palace.|$|E
5|$|In initial tests run during 2006 by David Ferrucci, {{the senior}} manager of IBM's Semantic Analysis and Integration department, Watson was given 500 clues from past Jeopardy! programs. While the best real-life {{competitors}} buzzed {{in half the}} time and responded correctly {{to as many as}} 95% of clues, Watson's first pass could get only about 15% correct. During 2007, the IBM team was given three to five years and a staff of 15 people to solve the problems. By 2008, the developers had advanced Watson such that it <b>could</b> <b>compete</b> with Jeopardy! champions. By February 2010, Watson could beat human Jeopardy! contestants on a regular basis.|$|E
5|$|The {{first season}} saw them finish runners-up, but the club's {{management}} declined {{to apply for}} promotion back into the Southern League and so they remained in the Wessex League. In the following three seasons they were placed seventh, ninth and sixth, but 1997–98 saw the club finish runners-up again, winning promotion back to the Southern League. Returning after a five-year absence, {{it was not long}} before the difference in quality between the two leagues became evident, and the club soon realised that it was unable to compete financially with the bigger clubs in the division. At {{the beginning of the year}} the club announced its intention to return to the Wessex League for 1999–2000, a decision taken because it was felt it would be better to play in a league in which it <b>could</b> <b>compete</b> financially and successfully.|$|E

5|$|A {{report in}} the American Chess Bulletin (July–August 1920 issue) said that Lasker had {{resigned}} the world title in favor of Capablanca because {{the conditions of the}} match were unpopular in the chess world. The American Chess Bulletin speculated that the conditions were not sufficiently unpopular to warrant resignation of the title, and that Lasker's real concern was that there was not enough financial backing to justify his devoting nine months to the match. When Lasker resigned the title in favor of Capablanca he was unaware that enthusiasts in Havana had just raised $20,000 to fund the match provided it was played there. When Capablanca learned of Lasker's resignation he went to the Netherlands, where Lasker was living at the time, to inform him that Havana would finance the match. In August 1920 Lasker agreed to play in Havana, but insisted that he was the challenger as Capablanca was now the champion. Capablanca signed an agreement that accepted this point, and soon afterwards published a letter confirming this. Lasker also stated that, if he beat Capablanca, he would resign the title so that younger masters <b>could</b> <b>compete</b> for it.|$|E
5|$|After the {{departure}} of Patrick Vieira to Juventus, Fàbregas was given the Frenchman's number 4 shirt and featured regularly in the Arsenal central midfield alongside Gilberto Silva. He made 49 appearances in all competitions during the 2005–06 season. Despite his young age, his performances came under greater scrutiny due to his increased involvement in the first team. Further, as Fàbregas possessed a smaller frame and played with less aggression than Vieira, there were initially doubts over his ability {{to fill in the}} void left by the Frenchman. Nevertheless, Fàbregas asserted his own style of play and impressed pundits in the Champions League against Real Madrid and Juventus. In the latter, he scored Arsenal's first goal and set up Thierry Henry for the second, at the same time proving that he <b>could</b> <b>compete</b> against tough, hard-tackling midfielders like Vieira. He then played in the Final against his former club Barcelona, but Arsenal were defeated 2–1, completing a trophyless 2005–06 campaign for Arsenal.|$|E
5|$|Descent 3 was {{presented}} at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in 1998, where developers showed off a demonstration of the game. In the months leading to the game's release, the game's publisher, Interplay Productions, ran a program that allowed Descent fans to submit a digital photo of themselves along with a pilot name to the company. These photos would later be included in the game so that players could use them as their multiplayer profiles. Outrage also released two game demos that allowed customers to try the game before purchasing it. The second demo included a single-player level and several multiplayer matches which could be played through a matchmaking service provided by Outrage. From March to August 1999, Interplay also held a Descent 3 tournament in the United States consisting of three phases where numerous players <b>could</b> <b>compete</b> against each other in multiplayer matches. The winner was awarded a prize of US$50,000.|$|E

5|$|During the {{discussion}} about deregulation, Braathens SAFE considered several possibilities to strengthen itself. In particular, it had discussions with the large European airlines Lufthansa, British Airways and KLM about an alliance, but these were rejected by Braathens SAFE, stating that the agreements were all about getting traffic to the partner's hub. Minister of Transport, Kjell Opseth and director of SAS in Norway, Jan Reinås, both proposed a merger between Braathens SAFE and SAS, {{to ensure that the}} company had a 100% market share on the primary routes before the merger. This would, according to them, secure that no foreign company <b>could</b> <b>compete</b> with the merged company. The proposal was rejected by Braathens SAFE's management. Still, negotiations started between the companies in 1992, although they were quickly abandoned. The press reported the price of Braathens SAFE to be NOK1.2 billion, but that this had been rejected as too expensive by SAS.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, CWC {{became a}} member of the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA). During this time, CWC wrestlers <b>could</b> <b>compete</b> for championships {{operated}} by the NWA. In 1958, the CWC created the United States Tag Team Championship (the first title ever owned by WWE), which inaugural champions Mark Lewin and Don Curtis won in April of that year. In 1963, CWC was renamed as the WWWF and ended its partnership with the NWA. To reflect the changes, the WWWF introduced its world heavyweight championship (WWE's second overall championship and the current WWE Championship), while the WWWF acronym was added to the United States Tag Team Titles. The titles were disbanded in 1967 without a formal announcement by the WWWF, and thus, the first tag team championship (and first championship overall) to be retired by the promotion. Ten years later, the company retired its first individually contested title, the WWWF United States Heavyweight Championship, also without a formal announcement.|$|E
5|$|Motivated {{in part by}} {{a desire}} to prove that Australians <b>could</b> <b>compete</b> at the highest level, and believing that claims that his brother died due to {{inexperience}} was a smokescreen intended to cover-up the poor safety standards, Malcolm Milne represented Australia at the next two Winter Olympics, won a World Cup event and came third in a World Championship. In 1968, Milne finished 24th in both the downhill and slalom events, Australia's best result in a skiing event up to that point. Ross Martin came 60th in both cross-country events, and Colin Coates came 41st and 49th in his two speed skating events. Australia had more officials present than athletes, with five competitors and three administrators. This trend continued at the 1972 Olympics in Sapporo, which were attended by five staff and four athletes. Milne rose up the rankings to finish 23rd and 24th in the downhill and slalom respectively, as did Coates, who came in the top 30 in three of his four events, including an 18th-place result in the 10,000m event. Milne was considered a medal contender and the team manager felt that but for a near-fall, he would have placed near the medalists.|$|E

5|$|On October 18, 2013, Charlene Johnson, the {{minister}} responsible for trade, along with Fisheries minister Keith Hutchings {{announced that the}} government supported the agreement in principle for CETA, that had been announced early that day. The ministers said the trade agreement would a game changer for the fishing industry. The agreement would eliminate MPRs for the European Union {{three years after the}} ratification of the deal, which is expected to occur in 2015. In return for eliminating minimum processing requirement, high tariffs and import restrictions on almost all fish would be eliminated on the first day that CETA comes into effect. Currently only 13.1 per cent of seafood is duty-free. But by 2022, all seafood would be 100 per cent duty-free. Following the conclusion of the CETA negotiations Dunderdale said that other provinces and the federal government had been pressuring her to accept a deal that would eliminate minimum processing requirements on fish right away, in exchange for concessions on tariffs later. Dunderdale said they refused that deal and were eventually able to negotiate the current arrangement. Her government also felt that eliminating MPRs was a safe trade away because they did not feel European countries <b>could</b> <b>compete</b> with Newfoundland and Labrador fish plants, due to higher operating costs in those countries.|$|E
5|$|Sega {{announced}} {{a follow-up to}} Sonic Adventure and a spinoff (which would become Sonic Shuffle) on October 4, 1999. The newly named Sonic Adventure 2 appeared at E3 2000, with Sonic Team adding video shown there to its website on June 30. Sonic Team posted a trailer {{and a number of}} screenshots on May 30, 2001, with Sega promoting Sonic Adventure 2 as the last Sonic game for the Dreamcast and as marking the series' 10th anniversary. Sega held a 10th-anniversary party for Sonic in June 2001, at which attendees <b>could</b> <b>compete</b> in a battle tournament; the winner played against Iizuka. The GameCube, rather than the competing Xbox or PlayStation 2, was chosen for a port of Sonic Adventure 2 because of its 56k technology. Sega and Sonic Team USA were unconcerned {{with the fact that the}} Xbox would feature broadband Internet connectivity, and the GameCube would not.|$|E
5|$|Sonic the Hedgehog {{was created}} by the newly formed Sonic Team, a 15-member Sega {{subsidiary}} formed to create a character that <b>could</b> <b>compete</b> with Nintendo's Mario. The game's level design was handled by Hirokazu Yasuhara, and the musical theme was composed by Masato Nakamura from the Japanese band Dreams Come True. In designing Green Hill, Yasuhara was inspired by the U.S. state of California, while the game's color scheme in general was influenced by the work of pop artist Eizin Suzuki. While the original game was a 2D side-scroller, Green Hill was remade in full 3D as a secret level in the 2001 game Sonic Adventure 2; the player unlocks it after collecting all 180 of the emblems found by completing the game's many objectives. The 2011 game Sonic Generations, a title that revisits past entries in the Sonic series, features both 2D ("Classic") and 3D ("Modern") versions of Green Hill, as well as of numerous other Sonic levels. A reinterpretation of the level appears in the 2017 title Sonic Mania. Green Hill Zone reappears in Sonic Forces, having partially turned to desert due to resource depletion by Eggman's industries.|$|E
