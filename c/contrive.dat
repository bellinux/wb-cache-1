5|$|When Catherine {{finds her}} {{colleague}} dead, she flees {{from the company}} premises and finds her husband, who has deduced that her job offer was simply a way for Odessa to reach him. Elsewhere, an Odessa agent murders the Old Man in Frank's home; the loss serves to reunite Watts, Means and Black, who <b>contrive</b> a plan to strike back at Odessa. As the Elder conducts a funeral for the Old Man, a carbomb kills his assassin, while Odessa's Paraguayan headquarters is destroyed and Knight's company is raided and closed. The Elder finishes his rites and returns home, opening a package delivered from the Middle East; inside is the fragment of the True Cross.|$|E
5|$|After the reclusive and bookish scholar Vasily Ordynov is {{compelled}} {{to leave his}} apartment he wanders aimlessly through Saint Petersburg, contemplating his despair over a loveless life, his childhood and his future. Through this distraction he finds himself within a church, where he notices an old man, Ilia Murin, with his young wife, Katerina. His fascination for the couple, particularly Katerina, causes him to <b>contrive</b> further encounters, {{with the intention of}} securing a lodging at their home. He becomes their house guest. The gloomy Murin is a perceived Old Believer, with powers of clairvoyance that have perturbed his neighbours and the local police, and which appear to control his wife. Katerina implies that Murin was her mother's lover, that she might be Murin's biological daughter, and that the pair ran-off together after he killed her father. There is an unresolved suggestion that Murin caused the death of Katerina's fiancé during their escape.|$|E

40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to examine whether teachers view mentoring as an inherently <b>contrived</b> or collaborative enterprise. Drawing upon a micro-political framework, this study examines the relationships between <b>contrived</b> and collaborative collegial relationships (Hargreaves, 1991), utilizing data from a mentor teacher program in a large Southwestern district. Teacher collegiality has not been viewed within the context of shifting power relationships between teachers and administrators. Some researchers (Conley, Bas-Isaac, & Scull, in press; Hargreaves, 1991) have maintained that while some teacher collegiality mechanisms may be teacher-driven and reflect genuine teacher collaboration, others are <b>contrived</b> and aimed more toward promoting administrative efficiency and gaining greater control over teachers' work. The critical question is whether peer mentoring systems, such as a formalized mentoring component of a Career Ladder program, which are inherently <b>contrived,</b> are capable of generating teacher collaboration. The results suggest that collaborative and <b>contrived</b> collegiality may be complementary relationships, that is, teachers can meet their own needs and interests in what on the surface is a <b>contrived</b> setting...|$|R

As a preliminary, Abu Bakr demanded that the governor of Ceuta, Fernando de Noronha, be relieved from office – his reputation was such that the Moroccans believed Noronha would <b>contrive</b> to prevent the swap. Peter had little trouble agreeing to it – the Noronha family, closely allied with the Braganzas, were among Peter's keenest political enemies; indeed, Noronha's brothers had led the conspiracy of nobles which tried to deprive Peter of the regency back in 1438.|$|E

25|$|Unlike the play, Scarpia shows Tosca the Marquise Attavanti's fan in Act 1, where Puccini's librettists <b>contrive</b> to {{have her}} return to the church {{following}} the departure of Angelotti and Cavaradossi. In the opera, both Cavaradossi's interrogation and torture and Scarpia's subsequent murder {{take place in the}} Farnese Palace. In the play, Cavaradossi's interrogation is set at his country house, where he was captured, while Scarpia's murder takes place at his apartment in the Castel Sant'Angelo. The news of the Austrian defeat at Marengo which formed the climax of Act 2 in La Tosca does not emerge in the opera until after Cavaradossi has been captured and tortured. Thus Scarpia is able to listen to Tosca's uninterrupted performance of the cantata (heard in a distant room of the palace).|$|E

The objectives of this research is to describe the implementation of incidental and <b>contrived</b> learning to increase the student’s vocabulary mastery at the first year of Engineering of SMK Negeri 2 Klaten and describe {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} teaching vocabulary by using incidental and <b>contrived</b> learning. This research is classroom action research. The analysis is qualitative method where the data are taken from documentation, interview, test, and observation analysis. The object of the study is the implementation of incidental and <b>contrived</b> learning to increase the student’s vocabulary mastery to the first year students of Mechanical Engineering of SMK Negeri 2 Klaten. The result of the research shows that incidental and <b>contrived</b> learning can increase the students’ vocabulary mastery. Before the observation, the teacher’s teaching technique was monotonous and the students easily get bored. The students tended to speak with other friends than listen to what the teacher said, so the material cannot be learned well, so the result of vocabulary mastery us poor. After the observation using incidental and <b>contrived</b> learning, the vocabulary mastery of the first year students of Mechanical Engineering of SMK 2 Klaten increases. The advantages of using Incidental and <b>Contrived</b> learning on teaching vocabulary are: The material are flexible, depending on the atmosphere or the situation within the class, the student will not get bored if the teacher able to use the method correctly, the students will have an extra new vocabulary from the new material of incidental learning, the teacher can create their own technique with the incidental learning. The disadvantages of using Incidental and <b>Contrived</b> learning on teaching vocabulary are: the students were confused when sometimes teacher changed the material that is not based on the curriculum, the teacher needed more material from the both incidental and <b>contrived</b> learning...|$|R

Unlike the other Olympic events, charioteers did not perform in the nude, probably for safety reasons because of the dust kicked up by the horses and chariots, and the likelihood of bloody crashes. Racers wore a sleeved garment called a xystis. It fell to the ankles and was fastened high at the waist with a plain belt.

500|$|The {{earliest}} {{reference to}} a Mohini-type goddess appears in the Samudra manthan episode of the 5th century BCE Hindu epic Mahabharata. The Amrita, or nectar of immortality, is produced by the churning of the Ocean of Milk. The Deva and the Asura fight over its possession. The Asuras <b>contrive</b> to keep the Amrita for themselves, angering the Devas. Vishnu, wise to their plan, assumes {{the form of an}} [...] "enchanting damsel". She uses her allure to trick the Asuras into giving her the Amrita, and then distributes it amongst the Devas. Rahu, an Asura, disguises himself as a god and tries to drink some Amrita himself. Surya (the sun-god) and Chandra (the moon-god) quickly inform Vishnu, and he uses the Sudarshana Chakra (the divine discus) to decapitate Rahu, leaving the head immortal. The decapitated body becomes Ketu. Rahu and Ketu are both regarded as celestial bodies that assume one's destiny. The other major Hindu epic, Ramayana (4th century BCE), narrates the Mohini story briefly in the Bala Kanda chapter. This same tale is also recounted in the Vishnu Purana four centuries later.|$|E

Despite this, Elizabeth hesitated to order her execution, {{even in the face of}} {{pressure}} from the English Parliament to carry out the sentence. She was concerned that the killing of a queen set a discreditable precedent, and was fearful of the consequences, especially if, in retaliation, Mary's son James formed an alliance with the Catholic powers and invaded England. Elizabeth asked Paulet, Mary's final custodian, if he would <b>contrive</b> a clandestine way to [...] "shorten the life" [...] of Mary, which he refused to do on the grounds that he would not make [...] "a shipwreck of my conscience, or leave so great a blot on my poor posterity". On 1 February 1587, Elizabeth signed the death warrant, and entrusted it to William Davison, a privy councillor. On the 3rd, ten members of the Privy Council of England, having been summoned by Cecil without Elizabeth's knowledge, decided to carry out the sentence at once.|$|E

[...] He stated that [...] "the whole point of the book is to raise awareness about the kiddie-sex tourism business in Thailand". Though the story uses more realism than the escapism typically associated with superhero fiction, Vachss did end the book with endorsements of two real non-profit groups; Don't! Buy! Thai! and End Child Prostitution in Asian Tourism. The writing is not subtle, as Vachss noted [...] "If you don't get angry, you're not going to do anything". Understanding that the likely readers were young males with short attention spans, Vachss tried to be dramatic by using what author Adam Begley calls [...] "a motivational hat trick: sympathy for the victims, revenge, and a family calling".|$|E

Casey and Jennings indignantly deny this, and Marie comes forward as a witness; whereupon Jennings and Casey try to leave the convention.

500|$|The {{episode was}} {{conceived}} by Mike Bullen and Cold Feets executive producer Andy Harries in 2000. Both attended a television conference in Sydney {{and decided to}} <b>contrive</b> the main plot of the fourth series so the characters {{would end up in}} Australia. Helen Baxendale was pregnant and could not fly to Australia, so all scenes featuring Rachel were filmed in Manchester and Salford, England. After location scouting and casting around the Sydney area in May and July, production in Australia ran for 18 days in October 2001. Locations used included a heritage home in Vaucluse for the wedding scenes, Palm Beach for a beach barbecue scene, and outside the Opera House. The episode was watched by nearly ninemillion people on its original UK broadcast and received a mixed reaction from newspaper critics; some believed the trip to Sydney was an unnecessary jaunt for the cast and crew, others selected the episode as a [...] "pick of the day". It also received mixed reviews in Australia and New Zealand. Kimberley Joseph's performance was praised, as was Gary Sweet's guest role.
