5|$|George Reid {{adopted a}} {{strategy}} of trying to reorient the party system along Labour vs non-Labour lines – prior to the 1906 election, he renamed his Free Trade Party to the Anti-Socialist Party. Reid envisaged a spectrum running from socialist to anti-socialist, with the Protectionist Party in the middle. This attempt struck a <b>chord</b> <b>with</b> politicians who were steeped in the Westminster tradition and regarded a two-party system as very much the norm.|$|E
5|$|The song uses two-measure phrases that, {{aside from}} the choruses, use a i–III–IV–VI chord progression. The B minor chord is held for 1⅓ of a beat, and a {{relative}} transformation is then used to produce a second-inversion D major chord, which is held for 1⅔ of a beat. In the second measure, a first-inversion E major <b>chord</b> <b>with</b> an added ninth precedes a G major major seventh chord; the chords are held for the same durations as the previous two.|$|E
5|$|By 1876, Macdonald and the Conservatives {{had adopted}} {{protection}} as party policy. This view was widely promoted in speeches {{at a number}} of political picnics, held across Ontario during the summer of 1876. Macdonald's proposals struck a <b>chord</b> <b>with</b> the public, and the Conservatives began to win a string of by-elections. By the end of 1876, the Tories had picked up 14seats as a result of by-elections, reducing Mackenzie's Liberal majority from 70 to 42. Despite the success, Macdonald considered retirement, wishing only to reverse the voters' verdict of 1874—he considered Charles Tupper his heir apparent.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} 20th century, Bosch's work enjoyed a popular resurrection. The early surrealists' fascination with dreamscapes, the {{autonomy}} of the imagination, and a free-flowing connection to the unconscious brought about a renewed interest in his work. Bosch's imagery struck a <b>chord</b> <b>with</b> Joan Miró and Salvador Dalí in particular. Both knew his paintings firsthand, having seen The Garden of Earthly Delights in the Museo del Prado, and both regarded him as an art-historical mentor. Miró's The Tilled Field contains several parallels to Bosch's Garden: similar flocks of birds; pools from which living creatures emerge; and oversize disembodied ears all echo the Dutch master's work. Dalí's 1929 The Great Masturbator is similar to an image {{on the right side of}} the left panel of Bosch's Garden, composed of rocks, bushes and little animals resembling a face with a prominent nose and long eyelashes.|$|E

25|$|There {{are several}} ways a guitalin is tuned. The most common tuning is a second {{inversion}} C <b>chord</b> <b>with</b> the courses of 2 adjacent strings tuned in unison with the lowest course (4th course) tuned an octave apart. This common tuning is GCEG.|$|E
25|$|Cross-note tunings {{include a}} minor third, so giving a minor <b>chord</b> <b>with</b> open strings.

By contrast, {{it is more difficult}} to fret a minor chord using an open major-chord tuning.|$|E

5|$|Instructional {{literature}} uses standard tuning. Traditionally {{a course}} {{begins with the}} hand in first position, that is, with the left-hand covering frets 1–4. Beginning players first learn open chords belonging to the major keys C,G, andD. Guitarists who play mainly open chords in these three major-keys and their relative minor-keys (Am,Em,Bm) may prefer standard tuning over an M3tuning. In particular, hobbyists playing folkmusic around a campfire are well served by standard tuning. Such hobbyists may also play major-thirds tuning, which also has many open <b>chords</b> <b>with</b> notes on five or six strings; <b>chords</b> <b>with</b> five-six strings have greater volume than <b>chords</b> <b>with</b> three-four strings and so are useful for acoustic guitars (for example, acoustic-electric guitars without amplification).|$|R
25|$|Many {{of these}} films showed the disillusionment with the oppressive rule of Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist Party. The Spring River Flows East, a three-hour-long two-parter {{directed}} by Cai Chusheng and Zheng Junli, was a particularly strong success.

25|$|Usually, when composers {{require a}} chord {{that is not}} easily {{described}} using this notation, they indicate the required chord in a footnote or in the header of the music. Alternatively, chords can be specified with more detailed numbers. For example, if the composer wants a C9 <b>chord</b> <b>with</b> no seventh, she can write C9 (no 7th), because the normal rule in jazz {{is that if a}} ninth chord is requested, the seventh is assumed.|$|E

25|$|The modernist 'revolution of the word' was {{not universally}} welcomed, either by readers or writers.

25|$|The design {{inherited}} some features {{from the}} earlier Mercury: it too had thin wings of constant <b>chord</b> <b>with</b> square tips of about the same span as the later Mercuries and used wing warping rather than ailerons. The wing was wire braced from above via a kingpost and below via the undercarriage, and was built up around machined I-section ash spars. The Type D also had the triangular cross-section fuselage seen on several of Blackburn's aircraft from the Second Monoplane onward.|$|E
25|$|The {{wing of the}} E-30 was {{straight}} edged and of constant <b>chord,</b> <b>with</b> rounded wing tips and a large, rounded cut-out in the trailing edge above the fuselage to improve visibility from the rear cockpit. It was fabric covered over a wooden structure, with Spanish pine box spars and ribs. Its centre section contained an integral fuel tank and was mounted on the fuselage with three duraluminum cabane struts on each side to the fuselage top and sides. Each wing was braced {{with a pair of}} lift struts from the fuselage bottom to about mid-span. The wings could be easily folded.|$|E

25|$|The E.1 was {{a wooden}} {{aircraft}} with spruce frames and plywood covering. It was a mid-wing cantilever monoplane with straight, thick section, constant chord wings of quite high aspect ratio (8.45). The lateral division was at about 65% <b>chord,</b> <b>with</b> the rear part joined {{to the front}} with conspicuous V-shaped faired underwing hinges. In normal flight the two parts were close together and the rear sections acted both as lifting surface and, differentially, ailerons but they could also be lowered together as slotted flaps, moving rearwards as well as down to produce a slot between fore and aft parts.|$|E
25|$|In 1898, {{the social}} {{reformer}} Ebenezer Howard {{wrote a book}} entitled To-morrow: A Peaceful Path to Real Reform (later republished as Garden Cities of To-morrow), in which he advocated {{the construction of a}} new kind of town, summed up in his Three Magnets diagram as combining the advantages of cities and the countryside while eliminating their disadvantages. Industry would be kept separate from residential areas—such zoning was a new idea at the time—and trees and open spaces would prevail everywhere. His ideas were mocked in the press but struck a <b>chord</b> <b>with</b> many, especially members of the Arts and Crafts movement and the Quakers.|$|E
25|$|The E-34 was {{a single}} engine biplane, seating two in tandem. It had unswept single bay wings of the same span and {{constant}} <b>chord,</b> <b>with</b> some stagger. The wings were fabric-covered wooden structures. Only the lower wing carried dihedral. The N-shaped interplane struts were assisted by flying wire bracing. The upper wing was supported over the fuselage {{by a pair of}} N-shaped struts to the upper fuselage longerons. The upper centre section had a large cut-out in its trailing edge for better upward visibility, and also contained the fuel tank. Ailerons were fitted only on the lower wing. The HS-34 had its tailplane mounted on top of the fusealge, carrying split elevators. The rudder was horn balanced.|$|E
