5|$|If a {{cerebral}} aneurysm is identified on angiography, two measures {{are available to}} reduce the risk of further bleeding from the same aneurysm: clipping and <b>coiling.</b> Clipping requires a craniotomy (opening of the skull) to locate the aneurysm, followed by the placement of clips around the neck of the aneurysm. <b>Coiling</b> is performed through the large blood vessels (endovascularly): a catheter is inserted into the femoral artery in the groin and advanced through the aorta to the arteries (both carotid arteries and both vertebral arteries) that supply the brain. When the aneurysm has been located, platinum coils are deployed that cause a blood clot to form in the aneurysm, obliterating it. The decision as to which treatment is undertaken is typically made by a multidisciplinary team consisting of a neurosurgeon, neuroradiologist, and often other health professionals.|$|E
5|$|After a subarachnoid {{hemorrhage}} is confirmed, its origin {{needs to be}} determined. If the bleeding {{is likely to have}} originated from an aneurysm (as determined by the CT scan appearance), the choice is between cerebral angiography (injecting radiocontrast through a catheter to the brain arteries) and CT angiography (visualizing blood vessels with radiocontrast on a CT scan) to identify aneurysms. Catheter angiography also offers the possibility of <b>coiling</b> an aneurysm (see below).|$|E

5|$|DNA {{is a long}} polymer {{made from}} repeating units called nucleotides. The {{structure}} of DNA is dynamic along its length, being capable of <b>coiling</b> into tight loops, and other shapes. In all species it is composed of two helical chains, bound to each other by hydrogen bonds. Both chains are coiled round the same axis, and have the same pitch of 34ångströms (3.4nanometres). The pair of chains has a radius of 10ångströms (1.0nanometre). According to another study, when measured in a different solution, the DNA chain measured 22 to 26ångströms wide (2.2 to 2.6nanometres), and one nucleotide unit measured 3.3Å (0.33nm) long. Although each individual nucleotide repeating unit is very small, DNA polymers can be very large molecules containing millions to {{hundreds of millions of}} nucleotides. For instance, the DNA in the largest human chromosome, chromosome number 1, consists of approximately 220 million base pairs and would be 85mm long if straightened.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{proposes a}} new multi-dimensional scoring {{approach}} for identifying and distinguishing trimeric and dimeric <b>coiled</b> <b>coils.</b> Practical {{issues in the}} implementation of the two-stranded <b>coiled</b> <b>coil</b> prediction algorithm PairCoil suggested by Berger are discussed.

5|$|Japanese pottery {{is one of}} the country's oldest {{art forms}} dating to the neolithic period, and some of the world's oldest {{earthenware}} from about 14,000BC has been discovered in Japan.

5|$|The tentacles of cydippid ctenophores are {{typically}} fringed with tentilla ("little tentacles"), {{although a few}} genera have simple tentacles without these sidebranches. The tentacles and tentilla are densely covered with microscopic colloblasts that capture prey by sticking to it. Colloblasts are specialized mushroom-shaped cells in the outer layer of the epidermis, and have three main components: a domed head with vesicles (chambers) that contain adhesive; a stalk that anchors the cell in the lower layer of the epidermis or in the mesoglea; and a spiral thread that coils round the stalk and {{is attached to the}} head and to the root of the stalk. The function of the spiral thread is uncertain, but it may absorb stress when prey tries to escape, and thus prevent the collobast from being torn apart. In addition to colloblasts, members of the genus Haeckelia, which feed mainly on jellyfish, incorporate their victims' stinging nematocytes into their own tentacles – some cnidaria-eating nudibranchs similarly incorporate nematocytes into their bodies for defense. The tentilla of Euplokamis differ significantly from those of other cydippids: they contain striated muscle, a cell type otherwise unknown in the phylum Ctenophora; and they are coiled when relaxed, while the tentilla of all other known ctenophores elongate when relaxed. Euplokamis tentilla have three types of movement that are used in capturing prey: they may flick out very quickly (in 40 to 60milliseconds); they can wriggle, which may lure prey by behaving like small planktonic worms; and they coil round prey. The unique flicking is an uncoiling movement powered by contraction of the striated muscle. The wriggling motion is produced by smooth muscles, but of a highly specialized type. <b>Coiling</b> around prey is accomplished largely by the return of the tentilla to their inactive state, but the coils may be tightened by smooth muscle.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} the physical characteristics {{and behavior of}} <b>coils</b> for endovascular therapy. METHODS: Mechanically detachable <b>coils</b> were constructed with simple helical (4 mm � 10 cm and 8 mm� 30 cm) and pretzel shapes (4 mm � 5 cm) made from three metals using 0. 003 - and 0. 004 -in wire. Stiffness or pliability, frictional resistance, shape memory, and <b>coil</b> stability were evaluated in vitro. RESULTS: The 0. 004 -in wire stock <b>coils</b> proved significantly stiffer {{when compared with the}} 0. 003 -in <b>coils.</b> Tungsten <b>coils</b> proved least pliable; platinum <b>coils</b> were intermediate in stiffness; and nitinol <b>coils</b> were softest. Frictional resistance in the catheter was greatest for stiffer <b>coils.</b> The 5 -cm pretzel <b>coil</b> consistently created more frictional force than the 10 - or 30 -cm simple helical <b>coils.</b> Despite a shorter length, the 4 -mm simple helical <b>coil</b> exerted more frictional force than the 8 -mm <b>coil.</b> Stiffer metal <b>coils</b> constructed of larger-diameter wire (0. 004 in) were more stable than softer <b>coils.</b> CONCLUSION: Stiffer <b>coils</b> exert greater frictional forces within the catheter and a greater resistive force during bending but are more stable after placement. Frictional forces also depended on the complex three-dimensional shape of the <b>coil</b> and the diameter of the turns in that shape rather than <b>coil</b> length.

Harbury et al. performed a landmark study using an archetypal <b>coiled</b> <b>coil,</b> GCN4, in which rules that govern the way that peptide sequence affects the oligomeric state (that is, the number of alpha-helices in the final assembly) were established. The GCN4 <b>coiled</b> <b>coil</b> is a 31-amino-acid (which equates to just over four heptads) parallel, dimeric (i.e., consisting of two alpha-helices) <b>coiled</b> <b>coil</b> and has a repeated isoleucine (or I, in single-letter code) and leucine (L) at the a and d positions, respectively, and forms a dimeric <b>coiled</b> <b>coil.</b> When the amino acids in the a and d positions were changed from I at a and L at d to L at a and I at d, a trimeric (three alpha-helices) <b>coiled</b> <b>coil</b> was formed. Furthermore, mutating the a and d positions both to L resulted in the formation of a tetrameric (four alpha-helices) <b>coiled</b> <b>coil.</b> These represent a set of rules for the determination of <b>coiled</b> <b>coil</b> oligomeric states and allows scientists to effectively [...] "dial-in" [...] the oligomerization behavior. Another aspect of <b>coiled</b> <b>coil</b> assembly that is relatively well understood, at least in the case of dimeric <b>coiled</b> <b>coils,</b> is that placing a polar residue (in particular asparagine, N) at opposing a positions forces parallel assembly of the <b>coiled</b> <b>coil.</b> This effect is due to a self-complementary hydrogen bonding between these residues, which would go unsatisfied if an N were paired with, for instance, an L on the opposing helix.|$|R
