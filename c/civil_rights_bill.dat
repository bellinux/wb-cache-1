5|$|The General Assembly {{established}} the state's first sales tax at two percent in 1962. The {{revenues from the}} tax led {{to a host of}} new projects across the state. The General Assembly also passed the Indiana <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>bill</b> in 1963, granting equal protection to minorities in seeking employment. In 1970 a series of constitutional amendments were passed. Among them was one that authorized the General Assembly to meet annually instead of biennially.|$|E
5|$|Democrats {{remained}} in the minority when the 43rd Congress convened in 1873. Randall continued his opposition to measures proposed by Republicans, especially those intended to increase {{the power of the}} federal government. That term saw the introduction of a new <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>bill</b> with farther-reaching ambitions than any before it. Previous acts had seen the use of federal courts and troops to guarantee that black men and women could not be deprived of their civil rights by any state. Now Senator Charles Sumner of Massachusetts proposed a new bill, aimed at requiring equal rights in all public accommodations. When Sumner died in 1874, his bill had not passed, but others from the radical wing of the Republican Party, including Representative Benjamin Butler of Massachusetts, continued to work for its enactment.|$|E
5|$|Despite the Democrats' {{advantage}} in the Senate, conservative Democrats united with the Republican minority to oppose much of Truman's agenda, most notably, civil rights legislation. In March 1949, Democratic floor leader Scott W. Lucas introduced an amendment to Senate Rule XXII to make cloture easier to achieve; hoping to end a ten-day filibuster against a <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>bill.</b> Conservative Republicans and Southern Democrats opposed the rule change and tried to obstruct it. Lucas asked for a cloture vote on the rule change, but opponents contended that the motion was out of order. Barkley studied the original debate on Rule XXII, which governed both cloture motions, before ruling in Lucas' favor. Georgia Senator Richard Russell, Jr. appealed Barkley's decision, and the chamber voted 46–41 to overrule. Sixteen Republicans, mostly from Northeast and West Coast states, voted to sustain the ruling; most Southern Democrats voted with the remaining Republicans to overrule it.|$|E
50|$|In Congress, Bennett was a {{moderate}} Republican who initially opposed <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>bills,</b> but he finally {{voted for the}} <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> Act of 1964 {{shortly before his death}} at age 60.|$|R

5|$|Illinois Senator Lyman Trumbull, {{leader of}} the Moderate Republicans and Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, was anxious to reach an {{understanding}} with the President. He ushered through Congress a bill extending the Freedmen's Bureau beyond its scheduled abolition in 1867, and the first <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Bill,</b> to grant citizenship to the freedmen. Trumbull met several times with Johnson, and was convinced the President would sign the measures (Johnson rarely contradicted visitors, often fooling those who met with him into thinking he was in accord). In fact, the President opposed both bills as infringements on state sovereignty. Additionally, both of Trumbull's bills were unpopular among white Southerners, whom Johnson hoped to include in his new party. Johnson vetoed the Freedman's Bureau bill on February 18, 1866, {{to the delight of}} white Southerners and the puzzled anger of Republican legislators. He considered himself vindicated when a move to override his veto failed in the Senate the following day. Johnson believed that the Radicals would now be isolated and defeated, and that the Moderate Republicans would form behind him; he did not understand that Moderates too wanted to see African Americans treated fairly.|$|E
5|$|Passage of the {{national}} Civil Rights Act of 1964 had {{paved the way for}} an even stronger <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>bill</b> in the 1966 legislative session. The Assembly easily passed the Kentucky Civil Rights Act opening all public accommodations to people of every race and prohibiting racial discrimination in employment by firms that employed eight or more people. The act applied to many kinds of businesses not covered by the federal statute, and approximately ninety percent of the businesses in Kentucky were affected, compared to only sixty percent that were covered by the federal statute. The act was {{the first of its kind}} passed in a southern state. In 1966, Breathitt was presented with the Lincoln Key Award for his leadership in the bill's passage. In 1966 and 1967, he was chair of the Southern Governors' Conference's Committee on Regional and Interstate Cooperation. He was also the only state governor named to the President's Council on Human Rights.|$|E

50|$|Rauh also lobbied Congress for {{the passage}} of many <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>bills,</b> having {{a hand in the}} passing of the <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> Act of 1968.

25|$|Although {{one of the}} officially stated {{purposes}} of the march was to support the <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>bill</b> introduced by the Kennedy Administration, several of the speakers criticized the proposed law as insufficient.

25|$|By the mid-1960s, the NAACP had regained {{some of its}} preeminence in the Civil Rights Movement by {{pressing}} for civil rights legislation.

25|$|During 1870, Langston {{assisted}} Republican Senator Charles Sumner from Massachusetts with {{drafting the}} <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>bill</b> that was enacted as the Civil Rights Act of 1875.

25|$|A {{landmark}} gay <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>bill</b> {{failed in}} the 2005 session but subsequently passed in the 2006 session. It was primarily responsible for expanding the scope of protected classes to include sexual orientation and gender identity in cases of discrimination. The bill was signed by Gregoire on January 31, 2006. She also signed a law on April 21, 2007 granting same-sex couples domestic partnership rights.|$|E
25|$|President Lyndon B. Johnson {{worked hard}} to persuade Congress to pass a <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>bill</b> aimed at ending racial {{discrimination}} in employment, education and public accommodations, and succeeded in gaining passage in July 1964. He followed that with passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which provided for protection of the franchise, with a role for federal oversight and administrators in places where voter turnout was historically low.|$|E
25|$|The Democratic Party, proclaiming {{itself the}} party of white men, north and south, {{supported}} Johnson. However the Republicans in Congress overrode his veto (the Senate by the close vote of 33:15, the House by 122:41) and the <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>bill</b> became law. Congress also passed a toned-down Freedmen's Bureau Bill; Johnson quickly vetoed {{as he had done}} to the previous bill. Once again, however, Congress had enough support and overrode Johnson's veto.|$|E
5000|$|Included in {{the list}} of {{prominent}} figures who have taken a stance on the subject, African-American scholar, Lerone Bennett Jr, stated that, [...] "We…need a new understanding—in the media, in the entertainment industry, in our churches, schools, and organizations—that popular songs are as important as <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>bills</b> and that a society who pays pipers to corrupt its young and to defame its women and mothers will soon discover that it has no <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> to defend and no songs to sing." ...|$|R
50|$|Reagan did {{not support}} many <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>bills</b> {{throughout}} the years. He opposed the <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 {{signed into law by}} President Lyndon B. Johnson. In 1982 he signed a bill extending the Voting Rights Act for 25 years after a grass-roots lobbying and legislative campaign forced him to abandon his plan to ease that law's restrictions. In 1988 he vetoed the <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> Restoration Act, but his veto was overridden by Congress. Reagan had argued that the legislation infringed on states' rights and the rights of churches and business owners.|$|R
50|$|After 57 {{working days}} of filibuster, and several compromises, the Senate had enough votes (71 to 29) {{to end the}} debate and the filibuster. It {{was the first time}} that Southern {{senators}} had failed to win with such tactics against <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>bills.</b> On July 2, President Johnson signed into law the <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> Act of 1964. The Act prohibited segregation in public places and barred unequal application of voter registration requirements. It did not explicitly ban literacy tests, which had been used to disqualify blacks and poor white voters.|$|R
25|$|Such miscarriages {{of justice}} by state governments {{influenced}} {{a move towards}} civil rights initiatives at the federal level. Truman subsequently established a national interracial commission, made a historic speech to the NAACP and the nation in June 1947 in which he described civil rights as a moral priority, submitted a <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>bill</b> to Congress in February 1948, and issued Executive Orders 9980 and 9981 on June 26, 1948, desegregating {{the armed forces and}} the federal government.|$|E
25|$|Emulating the Civil Rights Act of 1875, Kennedy's <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>bill</b> {{included}} {{provisions to}} ban discrimination in public accommodations, and {{to enable the}} U.S. Attorney General to join in lawsuits against state governments which operated segregated school systems, among other provisions. However, it {{did not include a}} number of provisions deemed essential by civil rights leaders including protection against police brutality, ending discrimination in private employment, or granting the Justice Department power to initiate desegregation or job discrimination lawsuits.|$|E
25|$|Judiciary Committee {{chairman}} Celler filed {{a petition}} to discharge the bill from the Rules Committee; it required {{the support of a}} majority of House members to move the bill to the floor. Initially Celler had a difficult time acquiring the signatures necessary, with many congressmen who supported the <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>bill</b> itself remaining cautious about violating normal House procedure with the rare use of a discharge petition. By the time of the 1963 winter recess, 50 signatures were still needed.|$|E
50|$|Over {{a hundred}} thousand, {{predominantly}} African Americans, gathered in Washington for the <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom on August 28, 1963. Kennedy feared the March {{would have a}} negative effect on the prospects for the <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>bills</b> in Congress, and declined an invitation to speak. He turned over some of the details of the government's involvement to the Dept. of Justice, which channelled hundreds of thousands of dollars to the six sponsors of the March, including the N.A.A.C.P. and Martin Luther King's Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC).|$|R
50|$|In {{his later}} career, Hollings was {{generally}} considered to be a moderate politically but was supportive of many <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>bills.</b> He voted for re-authorizing the Voting Rights Act in 1982. However, in 1967 {{he was one of the}} 11 senators who voted against the confirmation of Thurgood Marshall, the first black Supreme Court justice. Hollings later voted in favor of the failed nomination of Robert Bork and also for the successful nomination of Clarence Thomas.|$|R

25|$|Johnson {{was quite}} {{familiar}} with the procedural tactic, as he {{played a role in}} a similar tactic against the <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>bill</b> that Harry Truman had submitted to congress fifteen years earlier. In that fight, a rent-control renewal bill was held up until the civil-rights bill was withdrawn. Believing that the current course meant that the Civil Rights Act would suffer the same fate, he adopted a different strategy from that of Kennedy, who had mostly removed himself from the legislative process. By tackling the tax cut first, the previous tactic was eliminated.|$|E
25|$|March {{organizers}} themselves disagreed {{over the}} purpose of the march. The NAACP and Urban League saw it as a gesture of support for a <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>bill</b> that had been introduced by the Kennedy Administration. Randolph, King, and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) saw it as a way of raising both civil rights and economic issues to national attention beyond the Kennedy bill. Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) saw it as a way of challenging and condemning the Kennedy administration's inaction and lack of support for civil rights for African Americans.|$|E
25|$|On February 2, 1948, President Truman {{sent the}} first {{comprehensive}} <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>bill</b> to Congress. It incorporated many of the 35 recommendations of his commission. In July 1948, over the objection of senior military officers, Truman issued Executive Order 9981, banning racial discrimination in the U.S. Armed Forces, and Executive Order 9980 to integrate the federal government. (Facilities had been segregated under President Woodrow Wilson). This {{was in response to}} a number of incidents against black veterans, most notably the Woodard case. The armed forces and federal agencies led the way in United States for integration of the workplace, public facilities and schools. Over the decades, the decision meant that both institutions benefited from the contributions of minorities.|$|E
