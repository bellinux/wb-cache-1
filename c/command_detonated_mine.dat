5|$|On 4 August 1970, coincidentally Coast Guard Day, {{the pair}} of cutters set out on what {{would prove to be}} their last combat patrol. Each cutter had 25 Kit Carson Scouts {{embarked}} for a patrol of the Co Chien River. While following a narrow canal leading off the main channel, Point Marone was the target of a <b>command</b> <b>detonated</b> <b>mine.</b> The blast killed two of the RVN sailors instantly; all five Coast Guardsmen were injured along with 10 Kit Carson Scouts. After the mine explosion, Point Marone listed to starboard but managed to get underway while Point Cypress laid down suppressing fire and escorted the damaged cutter back to base at Cat Lo. Point Marone suffered three shrapnel holes at the starboard waterline as well as extensive damage to the bridge windows and damage to the watertight door between the mess deck and the forward berthing space. The deck aft of the bridge was covered with three inches of mud. After patching and painting, Point Marone was prepared for a final Operational Readiness Inspection to check the RVN crew readiness for the pending turnover of both Point Marone and Point Cypress.|$|E
25|$|Point Clear was {{credited}} with helping stop the overrun of the ARVN outpost at Hà Tiên on 20 October 1965 by firing her machine guns and lobbing mortar rounds near {{the perimeter of the}} compound. On 14 February 1966, Point Clear came to the rescue of a U.S. Navy Swift boat which had been sunk by a <b>command</b> <b>detonated</b> <b>mine</b> in shallow water near Rạch Giá. She provided covering fire with machine guns and the 81mm mortar while Navy personnel from other PCF's evacuated the injured and recovered bodies and equipment from the wreckage.|$|E
25|$|On 4 August 1970, Point Marone and , {{conducted}} the last mission for Squadron One on the Co Chien River. The cutters each carried fifty Kit Carson Scouts and their ARVN advisors {{along with the}} full 13 man South Vietnamese Navy replacement crew aboard for their final check ride for the Vietnamization program. In one of the canals that intersected with the river Point Marone hit a <b>command</b> <b>detonated</b> <b>mine</b> wounding several on board and causing several holes below the waterline. The mission was cancelled and Point Cypress escorted {{her back to the}} base at Cat Lo.|$|E
5000|$|On 16 March the 2nd Brigade air-assaulted {{into the}} area of Plei Doc (...) , {{approximately}} 15 kilometres northwest of the Đức Cơ Camp. As the UH-1s carrying the 1/12th Infantry landed the PAVN triggered several <b>command</b> <b>detonated</b> <b>mines</b> destroying 1 UH-1D and damaging 7 others and killing 5 US troops and wounding 13 others. The PAVN then engaged the infantry with rifle and machine gun fire before breaking contact as US air and artillery fire was brought to bear, leaving 10 dead.|$|R
50|$|The mine is {{normally}} fixed {{to a tree}} or pole, and is <b>command</b> <b>detonated.</b> The <b>mine</b> is currently in service with the Swedish army, where it {{is known as the}} Fordonsmina 14 and is produced by Saab Bofors Dynamics.|$|R
2500|$|Naval mines {{were also}} used to protect Krepost Sveaborg from an attack from the sea. An outer line of contact mines was laid {{approximately}} [...] outside the main line of defence. Shore <b>detonated</b> controlled <b>mines</b> were used to create an inner mine barrier to protect the entrances to the outer anchorage. These mines were laid typically in three rows with [...] separation between rows and [...] between mines in a row. Controlled mines required an extensive cabling system to the shore stations where the <b>command</b> to <b>detonate</b> the <b>mines</b> was given. Fortified electrical stations provided the necessary electricity for the mine control network. Electricity was also used for communication systems, searchlights, electrical ammunition lifts and in barracks and crew shelters.|$|R
25|$|As NVA {{activity}} {{continued to}} increase in the eastern DMZ, particularly north of Con Thien, the Marines decided to act. In addition to sightings of enemy tanks, Marine fighter pilots and aerial observers reported spotting trucks, truck parks, camouflaged revetments, storage bunkers, and trenchlines. Of special interest were repeated sightings of low, slow moving lights during hours of darkness which, it was assumed, came from enemy helicopters thought to be resupplying forward positions with high priority cargo such as ammunition and medical supplies or conducting medevacs. On 19 August, after 60 Arclight strikes 2nd Battalion 1st Marines (2/1) assaulted into three LZs in the Trung Son region of the southern DMZ, 5km north of Con Thien. Supported by a platoon of tanks from 3rd Tank Battalion, 2/1 swept the area but {{found no evidence of}} use by VPAF helicopters. During the extraction one CH-46 Sea Knight was destroyed by a <b>command</b> <b>detonated</b> <b>mine,</b> killing 4 Marines.|$|E
25|$|The {{next day}} at 12:00 on 23 December in AO Kilcoy, 8 Platoon, C Company 4 RAR/NZ mounted in APCs had been reacted to a {{reported}} sighting of Viet Cong. The platoon was split into two, with one half under the platoon sergeant moving forward on foot to search the area, moving through open rice padi parallel with the dense scrub. When the patrol came level with {{a break in the}} vegetation it was suddenly engaged with a claymore-type <b>command</b> <b>detonated</b> <b>mine,</b> wounding five members of the platoon. In response the remaining half of the platoon swept the area forward of the engagement area, however the Viet Cong made good their escape, withdrawing by sampan down a branch of a nearby river. One of the wounded Australians subsequently died of his wounds before the evacuation of the casualties could be arranged. The Christmas cease-fire began at 18:00, but was broken after the Viet Cong attacked elements of 2nd ARVN Airborne Brigade at FSB Barbara with mortars and small arms fire. Australian and South Vietnamese artillery and helicopter light fire teams were subsequently called-in to provide support.|$|E
2500|$|The last patrol of Point Cypress was {{conducted}} on 4 August with Point Marone in a narrow canal flowing into the Cổ Chiên River with 25 Kit Carson Scouts aboard each cutter and a mostly South Vietnamese Navy crew. After both cutters had turned around in the narrow canal, Point Marone was damaged by a <b>command</b> <b>detonated</b> <b>mine</b> causing three deaths among the Vietnamese crew and Scouts and several injuries. Point Cypress provided suppression fire with machine guns and her mortar and the Point Marone managed to clear the ambush scene. [...] Eleven days later, on 15 August 1970 the patched and painted Point Marone and the Point Cypress were {{turned over to the}} Republic of Vietnam Navy with Point Cypress recommissioned as RVNS Hồ Duy (HQ-724).|$|E

5000|$|... 2/9 Marines, {{supported}} by a platoon of M-48s, 3 M50 Ontos and 3 LVTEs moved north along Provincial Route 606 to make a spoiling attack into the DMZ, the unit made no contact with the NVA {{and set up a}} night defensive position near the Ben Hai River. The following morning as the unit was returning along the same route a <b>command</b> <b>detonated</b> <b>mine</b> exploded wounding 5 Marines. The NVA then opened fire with small arms and mortar fire and attacked the armored vehicles with RPGs. The NVA attempted to hug the US column negating the use of air support and the column broke up into several separate firefights. The isolated Marine Companies set up night defensive positions and were eventually relieved by 3/4 Marines on the morning of 30 July. Marine casualties for the operation were 23 dead and 251 wounded, while the NVA suffered 32 killed and a further 175 believed killed.|$|E

5000|$|Kerry {{was serving}} in the United States Navy at the time, as {{lieutenant}} and Officer-in-Charge of Swift Boat PCF-94, which for that period primarily patrolled in the Mekong River delta. On 13 March 1969, they had completed operations, had debarked some passengers but retained others, and this squadron of five PCF boats was headed {{out of the river}} to the bay. They approached a weir (a series of poles across the river, like thousands along the shore and the shoreline of the bay, across which nets could be strung). Some of the boats hugged the shore to the left, some to the right, in order to get around. As they tried to go around, the lead boat to the left, PCF-3, was blown clear out of the water with a <b>command</b> <b>detonated</b> <b>mine</b> (someone was nearby to remotely detonate it). According to Sen. Kerry's account, Kerry was already injured himself, and his boat (already damaged from a second explosion) came under heavy fire, when Kerry heard [...] "man overboard". He says that he ordered that the crew turn the boat around and return to pick up Rassmann, who had fallen off the port side or stern of PCF-94. Rassmann was for some reason unable to climb up over the cargo net near the bow of PCF-94, so Kerry pulled him on deck. The incident earned Kerry a Bronze Star with [...] "V" [...] Device for valor and his third Purple Heart.|$|E

50|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and intrepidity at {{the risk}} of his life above and {{beyond the call of duty}} while serving as a Rifleman with Company I, Third Battalion, Ninth Marines, Third Marine Division in action against enemy forces in the Republic of Vietnam. On February 13, 1969, Lance Corporal Creek's squad was providing security for a convoy moving to resupply the Vandegrift Combat Base when an enemy <b>command</b> <b>detonated</b> <b>mine</b> destroyed one of the vehicles and halted the convoy near the Cam Lo Resettlement Village. Almost immediately, the Marines came under a heavy volume of hostile mortar fire followed by intense small arms fire from a well-concealed North Vietnamese Army force. When his squad rapidly deployed to engage the enemy, Lance Corporal Creek quickly moved to a fighting position and aggressively engaged in the fire fight. Observing a position from which he could more effectively deliver fire against the hostile force, he completely disregarded his own safety as he fearlessly dashed across the fire-swept terrain and was seriously wounded by enemy fire. At the same time, a North Vietnamese fragmentation grenade was thrown into the gully where he had fallen, landing between him and several companions. Fully realizing the inevitable results of his action, Lance Corporal Creek valiantly rolled on the grenade and absorbed the full force of the explosion with his own body, thereby saving the lives of five of his fellow Marines. As a result of his heroic action, his men were inspired to such aggressive action that the North Vietnamese were defeated and the convoy was able to continue its vital mission. Lance Corporal Creek's indomitable courage, inspiring valor and selfless devotion to duty upheld the highest traditions of the Marine Corps and the United States Naval Service. He gallantly gave his life for his country.|$|E
