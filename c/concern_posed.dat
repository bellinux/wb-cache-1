2500|$|On September 11, 2014, KSTP-TV filed a {{complaint}} with the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) regarding its carriage in Canada and simultaneous substitution (simsubbing), as well as notifying the CRTC of viewer complaints of problems with closed captioning and poorly-timed simsubbing on its cable feed in Canada. In particular, KSTP is stating it is authorized for broadcast by the Federal Communications Commission, and not the CRTC, and is concerned that it may not have the appropriate broadcast rights for viewing in Canada. Hubbard Broadcasting, the owners of KSTP-TV, also argued concerns about their video feed being modified for Canadian viewers via simsubbing, removal of its closed-captioning information (a Broadcast Act violation, if proven), not having its digital subchannels carried as well, and that this might be a potential Copyright Act of Canada violation for its programming to air in Canada. Similar to , KSTP has also asked for compensation for its carriage in Canada or to have its unauthorized coverage cease, as it was never asked for permission to be relayed on cable services in Canada. The CRTC ultimately ruled against KSTP-TV on September 16, 2014 regarding their request to be removed from the CRTC's list of stations eligible for carriage in Canada, a fear that was shared by Shaw Media (owners of Shaw Direct/Shaw Cable/CANCOM) and Thunder Bay MP Bruce Hyer. [...] A secondary <b>concern</b> <b>posed</b> by Shaw Media was that KSTP-TV would try to ask for fee-for-carriage in a cross-border retransmission consent agreement, which does not currently exist under the Copyright Act of Canada, and as the CRTC explained, is outside the scope of the Broadcast Act of 1968 or its regulatory responsibilities.|$|E

30|$|The {{tunability}} of DES {{contributes to}} much more possibility of designing vast kinds of DES, thus bringing various {{effect on a}} biocatalytic reaction system. The selection of HBAs and HBDs {{make a big difference}} in the whole process. For instance, ChCl/Gly is usually used as a good solvent/co-solvent for enzymatic reaction, while the performance of ChCl/MA is not satisfactory (Durand et al. 2012). Different HBDs also form DESs with different viscosities (Zhang et al. 2012), which affects the mass transfer of all the reactants (substrate, product, catalyst, etc.) and further changes the reaction rate. At this point, the hydrogen bond is another <b>concern</b> <b>posed</b> by various HBDs. There is a difference of just one hydroxyl group between Gly and EG; however, the resulting DESs showed remarkable difference on the lipase-catalyzed reaction (Durand et al. 2012).|$|E

The samples were separated thus: tuber (head, middle and tail), leaves and stem. The results based on dry weight showed that phytate ranged from 203. 8 - 383. 4 mg 100 g- 1, (head), 213. 0 - 383. 0 mg 100 g- 1 (middle), 213. 0 - 372. 8 mg 100 g- 1 (tail), 213 - 383. 5 mg 100 g- 1 (leaves) and 213. 0 - 355 mg 100 g- 1 (stem). The middle of the tubers had highest total P. More {{than half of the}} cassava samples had over 70 % of their total P linked to phytate. The coefficient of variation in percent (CV %) of all-the samples revealed that there were no great disparity between the parameters measured. The relative high phytate value obtained in this study suggests that the bioavailability of metals in the samples should be adequately processed so that the <b>concern</b> <b>posed</b> by the metal chelation and protein – binding action of phytate would be eliminated...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{screening}} tool for quantifying levels {{of concern for}} contaminants detected in monitoring wells on or near landfills to down-gradient receptors (streams, wetlands and residential lots) was developed and evaluated. The tool uses Quick Domenico Multi-scenario (QDM), a spreadsheet implementation of Domenico-based solute transport, to estimate concentrations of contaminants reaching receptors under steady-state conditions from a constant-strength source. Unlike most other available Domenico-based model applications, QDM calculates the time for down-gradient contaminant concentrations to approach steady state and appropriate dispersivity values, and allows for up to fifty simulations on a single spreadsheet. Sensitivity of QDM solutions to critical model parameters was quantified. The {{screening tool}} uses QDM results to categorize landfills as having high, moderate {{and low levels of}} concern, based on contaminant concentrations reaching receptors relative to regulatory concentrations. The application of this tool was demonstrated by assessing levels of concern (as defined by the New Jersey Pinelands Commission) for thirty closed, uncapped landfills in the New Jersey Pinelands National Reserve, using historic water-quality data from monitoring wells on and near landfills and hydraulic parameters from regional flow models. Twelve of these landfills are categorized as having high levels of concern, indicating a need for further assessment. This tool is not a replacement for conventional numerically-based transport model or other available Domenico-based applications, but is suitable for quickly assessing the level of <b>concern</b> <b>posed</b> by a landfill or other contaminant point source before expensive and lengthy monitoring or remediation measures are taken. In addition to quantifying the level of concern using historic groundwater-monitoring data, the tool allows for archiving model scenarios and adding refinements as new data become available...|$|E

40|$|Pseudo-nitzschia is a {{cosmopolitan}} marine diatom {{which can cause}} the poisoning of humans, marine mammals, and birds through {{the production of the}} neurotoxin domoic acid and subsequent contamination of the marine food web. Severe poisoning events are induced when environmental conditions allow: (1) the rapid proliferation ('bloom') of resident toxic species of Pseudo-nitzschia, and/or (2) their enhanced toxin production, and (3) the conveyance of the toxin into prey items. The introduction of domoic acid into the food web was recognized as a public health concern along the coast of California following a Pseudo-nitzschia bloom and seabird mortality event in the Monterey Bay area in 1991, and blooms of Pseudo-nitzschia have since been observed in the region with regularity. Since the recognition of the public health <b>concern</b> <b>posed</b> by these recurrent harmful algal bloom (HAB) events, the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) has been charged with protecting the public from domoic acid intoxication through the Preharvest Shellfish Protection and Marine Biotoxin Monitoring Program. This regulatory program (1) conducts, surveys, classifies and monitors commercial shellfish growing areas, and (2) monitors numerous points along the California coastline for marine biotoxins in shellfish and toxigenic phytoplankton in the waters. While these regulatory efforts have successfully prevented significant injury to public health since they began, they remain relatively inefficient in terms of time, energy, and cost. This thesis begins with an investigation of the environmental factors that contribute to Pseudo-nitzschia bloom formation in Monterey Bay (Chapter 1). The identification of nitrate and river discharge as seasonal bloom factors motivated an explicit evaluation and contextualization of river nitrate loading within the 'upwelling-dominated' region of Monterey Bay (Chapter 2). Finally, a new monitoring technology, Solid Phase Adsorption Toxin Tracking (SPATT), is presented, developed primarily for use by public health managers for more effective and efficient monitoring of domoic acid, the toxin produced by Pseudo-nitzschia and the ultimate cause for concern (Chapter 3, with addendum) ...|$|E
40|$|X-rays are an {{energetic}} and penetrating form of ionizing electromagnetic radiation, which can degrade NASA flight hardware. The main <b>concern</b> <b>posed</b> by such radiation is degradation of active electronic devices and, in some cases, diodes. Non-electronic components are only damaged at doses that far exceed {{the point where}} any electronic device would be destroyed. For {{the purposes of this}} document, flight hardware can be taken to mean an entire instrument, the flight electronics within the instrument or the individual microelectronic devices in the flight electronics. This document will discuss and describe the ways in which NASA flight hardware might be exposed to x-rays, what is and isn't a concern, and how to tell the difference. First, we must understand what components in flight hardware may be vulnerable to degradation or failure as a result of being exposed to ionizing radiation, such as x-rays. As stated above, bulk materials (structural metals, plastics, etc.) are generally only affected by ionizing radiation at very high dose levels. Likewise, passive electronic components (e. g. resistors, capacitors, most diodes) are strongly resistant to exposure to x-rays, except at very high doses. The main concerns arise when active components, that is, components like discrete transistors and microelectronic devices, are exposed to ionizing radiation. Active components are designed to respond to minute changes in currents and voltages in the circuit. As such, {{it is not surprising that}} exposure to ionizing radiation, which creates ionized and therefore electrically active particles, may degrade the way the hardware performs. For the most part, the mechanism for this degradation is trapping of the charges generated by ionizing radiation by defects in dielectric materials in the hardware. As such, the degree of damage is a function of both the quantity of ionizing radiation exposure and the physical characteristics of the hardware itself. The metric that describes the level of exposure to ionizing radiation is total ionizing dose (TID). The unit of TID is the rad, which is defined as 100 ergs absorbed per gram of material. Dose can be expressed in other units, for example grays (gy), where 1 gy = 100 rads. The actual fluence of radiation needed to deliver a rad depends on the absorbing material, so units of dose are usually stated in reference to the material of interest. That is, for microelectronic devices, the unit of dose is generally rad (Si) or rad (SiO 2). However, the definition of absorbed dose in this fashion has the advantage that the type of radiation causing the ionization can be normalized so that a realistic and adequate comparison can be made. The sensitivity of microelectronic parts to TID varies over many orders of magnitude. (Note: Doses to humans are typically expressed in rems-or roentgen-equivalent-man-which measures tissue damage, and depends on the type of radiation, as well as the dose in rads.) Thus far, the "softest" parts tested at NASA showed damage at 500 rads (Si), while parts that are radiation-hardened by design can remain functional to doses on the order of 107 rads (Si). This broad range of sensitivity highlights one of the most important considerations when considering the effects of radiation on electronic parts: In order to determine whether a radiation exposure is a concern for a particular part, one must understand the technologies used in the part and their vulnerabilities to TID damage. A NASA radiation expert should be consulted to obtain such information...|$|E
