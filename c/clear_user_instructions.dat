40|$|Recently, the {{behaviors}} of library users have changed due {{to the development of}} electronic resources and computer technologies. Accordingly, use of web-based electronic resources is becoming more popular compared to a visit to the library. Therefore, efficient and easy use of electronic resources has become essential and libraries support users by providing <b>user</b> <b>instruction</b> programs. This study investigated the status of <b>user</b> <b>instruction</b> of medical libraries in Korea, and developed <b>user</b> <b>instruction</b> programs. A few medical libraries perform <b>user</b> <b>instruction</b> programs regularly with various subjects. For the development of the program, users who received education in <b>user</b> <b>instruction</b> programming in medical libraries were surveyed and interviewed. Results showed that the satisfaction levels regarding program content, methodology, and place were high, but the satisfaction levels for course length were low. Users responded that the <b>user</b> <b>instruction</b> program was helpful for library use, database use, and general information usage. Many questions regarding library use were asked, and interest in other courses was high. Users also emphasized repetitive education, as well as details divided by levels. Beginning in 2008, Yonsei University Medical Library has updated its <b>user</b> <b>instruction</b> program based on the results. This paper introduces the case of such a library that has made changes on their <b>user</b> <b>instruction</b> programs...|$|R
40|$|<b>User</b> <b>instruction</b> {{has lately}} {{become one of}} the most fashionable topics in the vast field of library and {{information}} science. At the same time, the development of experiences and activities related to <b>user</b> <b>instruction</b> is becoming more and more normal practice in information units of all types. Within the specific context of public libraries, <b>user</b> <b>instruction</b> is still to be fully developed and the implementation of instruction programmes and services still leaves a lot to be desired.

In this respect, this paper presents and analyses the main <b>user</b> <b>instruction</b> experiences carried out at Spanish public libraries over the last few years, their results and future prospects...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Research {{shows that}} confidence-increasing {{elements}} in <b>user</b> <b>instructions</b> positively influence senior users' task performance and motivation. We added verification steps and personal stories to <b>user</b> <b>instructions</b> for a cell phone, {{to find out}} how seniors (between 60 and 70 years) perceive these confidence-increasing motivational elements. Verification steps allow users to check if a procedure was carried out correctly. Personal stories describe how a fictitious user succeeded in completing a procedure. Method: The plus-minus method was used. Participants were asked to place pluses and minuses in cell phone <b>user</b> <b>instructions</b> to indicate their positive and negative reading experiences, and to explain their choices afterwards. Results: Verification steps are regarded as other, common parts of <b>user</b> <b>instructions</b> by seniors. Nineteen out of 20 participants appreciate verification steps, and they mainly encourage providing these because they are expected to decrease doubts, and increase user confidence and satisfaction. Personal stories tend to stand out compared to other, common parts of <b>user</b> <b>instructions.</b> Thirteen out of 20 participants appreciate personal stories, which use is mainly discouraged for redundancy reasons, and encouraged for their expected positive effects on user confidence and motivation. Conclusion: The use of verification steps and personal stories in <b>user</b> <b>instructions</b> seems acceptable to seniors. As a next step, it seems worth it to test for effects of these motivational elements on usability, user confidence and motivatio...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{gives an}} {{overview}} of three studies that we conducted to investigate the effects of motivational elements in <b>user</b> <b>instructions.</b> We tested for effects on usability, in particular on task effectiveness, task efficiency and user satisfaction. Motivational elements are textual additions or modifications to <b>user</b> <b>instructions</b> {{with the aim of}} motivating the reader, without changing the content of the actual instructions. The results of our studies showed that supplying motivation in <b>user</b> <b>instructions</b> can positively affect usability, but the presence of these effects seems to depend on the task at hand and on the characteristics of the user group. Our upcoming studies will focus on reading-to-do situations and on users with low confidence levels...|$|R
40|$|Understanding <b>user</b> <b>instructions</b> {{in natural}} {{language}} {{is an active}} research topic in AI and robotics. Typically, natural <b>user</b> <b>instructions</b> are high-level and can be reduced into low-level tasks expressed in common verbs (e. g., `take', `get', `put'). For robots understanding such instructions, {{one of the key}} challenges is to process high-level <b>user</b> <b>instructions</b> and achieve the specified tasks with robots' primitive actions. To address this, we propose novel algorithms by utilizing semantic roles of common verbs defined in semantic dictionaries and integrating multiple open knowledge to generate task plans. Specifically, we present a new method for matching and recovering semantics of <b>user</b> <b>instructions</b> and a novel task planner that exploits functional knowledge of robot's action model. To verify and evaluate our approach, we implemented a prototype system using knowledge from several open resources. Experiments on our system confirmed the correctness and efficiency of our algorithms. Notably, our system has been deployed in the KeJia robot, which participated the annual RoboCup@Home competitions {{in the past three years}} and achieved encouragingly high scores in the benchmark tests...|$|R

40|$|MORETHAN 5000 PUBLICATIONS {{related to}} library <b>user</b> <b>instruction</b> and {{information}} literacy {{have been published}} and reviewed in the past thirty years. New developments in education and technology {{during the last two}} decades have affected <b>user</b> <b>instruction</b> and have led to the emergence of information literacy. Based on needs related to the rapid development of information technology and the evolving information society, librarians have begun teach-ing information skills to all types of users to ensure that they gain informa-tion fluency so they can become productive and effective information users both in the education environment and in the work environment. The number of publications related to <b>user</b> <b>instruction</b> and information literacy, like the field itself, show phenomenal growth during the past three decades as demonstrated by the fact that in 1973 twenty-eight publications were reviewed, and in 2002 more than 300 publications dealing with the topic of information literacywill be issued. It is noteworthy that in the last decade there has been a tremendous growth in publications related to information literacy globally. During the 1970 s,publications indicate that <b>user</b> <b>instruction</b> activities were of concern primarily to librarians in the United States, Cana-da, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand. At the present time, publications indicate a major concern with information literacy not only i...|$|R
40|$|For a long time, <b>user</b> <b>instructions</b> were {{considered}} as purely instrumental documents: Instructions had to enable readers to perform tasks with an accompanying device. And {{even though this}} still remains {{the main purpose of}} <b>user</b> <b>instructions,</b> views on how to accomplish this have changed over the years. The traditional view seemed to assume that when the instructions were correct, readers would automatically {{be able to use the}} accompanying device well (Moore, 1997). According to current views, the instructions should motivate readers to keep on reading once they have started doing so (Horton, 1997). This new approach to technical communication is being adopted by a vastly growing group of practitioners in the field, but relatively little research has been conducted so far to test for the effects of this approach. We executed a number of studies to test for the effects of motivational elements in <b>user</b> <b>instructions</b> (Loorbach, Karreman, & Steehouder, 2007, 2009).

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose the use (or re-use) of formal {{specifications}} {{for the development of}} user manuals and <b>user</b> <b>instructions.</b> We base our work on two observations. The first is that a considerable part of user manuals consist of series of <b>user</b> <b>instructions</b> that guide a user in the use of a device or a software application. The second is that the user interface in terms of user operations and feedback can often be described {{in the form of a}} finite state machine. In this paper we describe how model checking techniques can be used to derive automatically series of <b>user</b> <b>instructions</b> from the interface specification. The approach is illustrated by means of the specification of a well-known device such as a telephone which is then used to derive proper instruction sequences addressing relevant 2 ̆ 7 how-to 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 what-if 2 ̆ 7 questions about the operation of the system from a user point of view...|$|R

40|$|Literature {{shows that}} there are two views on how <b>user</b> <b>instructions</b> should stimulate the users’ {{motivation}} to read the instructions {{to be able to work}} with the accompanying device, system or program. Advocates of the first view state that users will be motivated by correct instructions that enable them to perform tasks effectively and efficiently. Promoters of the second view think that facilitating correct task performance is not enough to motivate users. They consider it a function of <b>user</b> <b>instructions</b> to facilitate positive experiences while performing tasks, and they expect that adding motivational elements would be beneficial. We conducted four studies to investigate the effects of motivational elements in <b>user</b> <b>instructions.</b> These studies were based on the ARCS model, which provides strategies focusing on four objectives – Attention, Relevance, Confidence and Satisfaction – to make instructions motivational. We measured the effects of motivational elements focusing on those objectives, on usability and on the users’ motivation and confidence. We particularly studied elements that were expected to promote confidence (e. g. personal stories). In general, the results of the studies show that confidence-enhancing elements positively affect the effectiveness of task performance and users’ persistence in trying to complete a task...|$|R

40|$|The {{history of}} <b>user</b> <b>instructions</b> {{demonstrates}} a graphic diversity {{and freedom from}} the conventionality that typifies current examples, especially those that attempt to explain the operation of new technology products to ordinary consumers. This paper shows how ideas from graphic design history can be used both critically and creatively to question and improve current practice. The overall aim of the project is to formulate a new model that will benefit both the user and the manufacturer as an integrated part of brand communication. Firstly, this paper will define the problem: it will attempt to trace and explain the separation of research into the effectiveness of <b>user</b> <b>instructions</b> from the broader flow of graphic design practice and research. Current <b>user</b> <b>instructions</b> demonstrate a limited graphic language that has evolved through a science-based quantitative research methodology. This process measures the reader’s cognitive responses in artificial test conditions. The visual outcomes have failed to satisfy the increasing need for <b>user</b> <b>instructions</b> to be both simple and an integrated, consistent tool of brand communication between manufacturer and user. Secondly, the paper explores the potential through a range of examples {{from the history of}} <b>user</b> <b>instructions.</b> Examples will focus on those that introduce new technology to a domestic context. These demonstrate both the aesthetic and rhetorical breadth of graphic language, as well as their significance to specific audiences. They illustrate attempts to resolve the conflicting demands of technical instruction whilst promoting brand values and persuading users of the benefits of new technology. Design historians such as Brockmann (1998) and Attfield (1990, 2006) have shown that exploring design ideas from a real-user context can provide an alternative, more meaningful and relevant assessment of designed artifacts. Finally, this paper will describe research practice, showing how visualised qualitative methods can analyse rich and significant graphic communication content (Doblin, Kress & Van Leeuwen, Jewitt, Crow, Meggs, Berger, Goffman, Lidwell), considering visual rhetoric and relevance to the user's context in addition to instructional content (Hartley, Schriver, Booher, Westendorp, etc). This method can be used to extract ideas and content from instructional documents, which could provide design principles incorporating contextual relevance and value to the user. This parallels recent trends in other areas of design that explore beyond mere functionality to the emotional significance (Norman, Crilly) and user's experience of design (Shedroff) ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Research {{shows that}} Western and Chinese {{technical}} communicators structure their documents in different ways. The research {{reported in this}} article is a first attempt to systematically explore the effects cultural adaptations of <b>user</b> <b>instructions</b> have on <b>users.</b> Specifically, we investigate whether Western (from Europe and North America) and Chinese (from the People's Republic of China) users would benefit from a document structure that is theoretically assumed to reflect their cultural preferences. Method: Using the SDL Trados Studio 2014 translation software package, a 2 x 2 experiment (N= 80) was conducted with manual structure (Western versus Chinese) and cultural background (Western versus Chinese) as independent variables. The Chinese and Western manual structures were based on the literature on cultural differences between Western and Chinese technical communication. Dependent variables were task performance, knowledge, and appreciation of the software and the <b>user</b> <b>instructions.</b> Results: Contrary to our expectations, {{no significant differences were found}} between the conditions. Both Western and Chinese participants performed equally well and were equally appreciative when using the Western and Chinese manual structure. Conclusion: The results of our study raise questions about the validity and/or the relevance of the current insights regarding cultural differences in the structures of <b>user</b> <b>instructions.</b> Cultural differences found in content analytic research may reflect the habits of technical communicators rather than the preferences of users. However, caution is needed in interpreting our findings, as our research experiences also raised a number of methodological issues that must be addressed in future researc...|$|R
40|$|Concerning {{the design}} of <b>user</b> <b>instructions,</b> two view can be distinguished. The {{traditional}} view considers instructions as purely instrumental documents. The more and more emerging affective view still assumes that above all, instructions should enable readers to perform tasks. But {{in order to accomplish}} this goal, the instructions should motivate readers to keep on reading long enough and carefully enough to perform a task. The studies presented in this dissertation were aimed at giving insight in the use and effects of so-called motivational elements in <b>user</b> <b>instructions</b> (e. g., testimonials, control steps). For most of these studies, the ARCS Model of Motivational Design (Keller, 1983, 1987 abc, 1999, 2010) was used to design the motivational instructions. According to this model, instruction design should be aimed at four goals in order to motivate readers, namely Attention, Relevance, Confidence, and Satisfaction. The described research shows that when things go smoothly, motivation does not seem so much of an issue. In such cases, motivational elements may increase text appreciation, but such elements are unlikely to affect user confidence or usability aspects. In those cases, instruction does it all. In those cases, advocates of the traditional view on {{the design of}} <b>user</b> <b>instructions</b> seem to be right. When setbacks are met, however, the affective view seems more fruitful and motivational elements could do the trick. In those cases, instruction does not do it all.
