This thesis looks at how science <b>communicators</b> {{become aware of}} (or “learn about”) the increasingly specialized subfields of science. The thesis also examines how science <b>communicators</b> educate themselves (or “keep up”) with ongoing changes in the field. The study, which integrated a survey with 161 participants and five in-depth interviews, also uncovered the demographics of science <b>communicators,</b> {{as well as the}} pressures they face on-the-job. According to the study’s results, there are no ineffective methods for learning about or keeping up with science, indicating that science <b>communicators</b> are using everything at their disposal to become aware of and remain educated about science. Another area looked at was a potential reflection of the relationship between scientists and <b>communicators</b> based on how easy/difficult it was for <b>communicators</b> to get in contact with scientists, and how eager/willing they were to talk to <b>communicators.</b> The findings show that scientist and <b>communicators</b> seem to have positive relationships with each other. These findings all have significance because they can be used by science <b>communicators</b> to improve practices...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1990 Researchers have {{investigated}} the behavioral and demographic characteristics of fashion innovators, opinion leaders, and innovative <b>communicators</b> in samples drawn from populations residing outside of Oregon. Therefore, {{the purpose of the}} present study was to examine differences between innovative <b>communicators</b> and non-innovative <b>communicators</b> in a sample of Oregon women in their shopping behavior and demographic characteristics. This study was conducted in order to compare these two segments of Oregon women with samples drawn from other populations. The first objective of the study was to examine what retail outlets were patronized for apparel purchases, what form of payment was used for clothing purchases, and how much money was spent annually on these purchases by Oregon women. A second objective was to develop shopping behavior profiles of Oregon women who were categorized as innovative <b>communicators</b> and non-innovative <b>communicators.</b> Diffusion theory was used to explain the adoption process by consumers when adopting innovations. On the basis of their level of innovativeness, Rogers (1983) categorized individuals into one of five adopter categories: innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority, and laggards. Innovators were found to be the first in a social group to adopt an innovation, whereas early adopters were opinion leaders of innovations. Although functionally different, similarities were found in the demographic and life-style chararacteristics of innovators and opinion leaders. The term "innovative communicator" was used to identify individuals who simultaneously performed the role of innovator and opinion leader (Baumgarten, 1975). Life-style research examined consumer characteristics of innovative <b>communicators</b> and non-innovative <b>communicators</b> in relation to their shopping behavior. Based on diffusion and life-style literature, a number of hypotheses were developed that examined store patronage, form of payment, annual amount spent on apparel purchases, and demographic characteristics in relation to level of fashion leadership. Data used for this study were taken from a larger study, Agriculture Experiment Station Western Region Project W- 175, that was conducted in 1987. From this questionnaire, items that asked about retail store patronage, clothing expenditures, fashion leadership, and demographic characteristics were used for the present study. The sample consisted of 234 adult Oregon women. Subjects were classified as innovative-communicators, medium innovative <b>communicators,</b> or non-innovative <b>communicators</b> based on summed scores from the fashion innovativeness and fashion opinion leadership items from the questionnaire. For statistical analysis, one-way analysis of variance, post-hoc analysis using the Tukey HSD test, and chi-square were performed. The. 05 confidence level was selected for claims of statistical significance. Profiles of Oregon women classified as innovative <b>communicators</b> and non-innovative <b>communicators</b> emerged relating to their shopping behavior and demographic characteristics. Women in Oregon who categorized themselves as innovative <b>communicators</b> had a higher household income, spent more money on apparel, always or often purchased their apparel at specialty stores, and sometimes purchased apparel at department stores. Oregon women who categorized themselves as non-innovative <b>communicators</b> had lower household incomes, spent less money on apparel, always or often purchased their apparel at discount stores, and sometimes purchased apparel at department stores. In terms of shopping behavior and demographic characteristics, similarities were found between this sample of innovative <b>communicators</b> and non-innovative <b>communicators</b> and samples previously studied. Innovative <b>communicators</b> and non-innovative <b>communicators</b> among Oregon women were found to be similar to samples previously studied with regard to store patronage, clothing expenditures, and level of income. Innovative <b>communicators</b> and non-innovative <b>communicators</b> in the present sample were also similar to samples previously studied in their use of store credit cards for apparel purchases. Because of these similarities, results on profiles of innovative <b>communicators</b> and non-innovative <b>communicators</b> can be used by retailers in developing marketing strategies to fit their retail establishments...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, text {{messages}} have {{become one of}} most popular forms of communication. A diverse array of software to enable the exchange of text messages has been developed and deployed on computers and smart phones {{which is one of}} reasons for the increased use of text messages for communication purposes. However, there are several disadvantages for <b>communicators</b> when using text messages. For example, in the text-chat environment, {{there is a lack of}} trust between <b>communicators</b> (Bos et al., 2002) and <b>communicators</b> may face a high cognitive load (Thirunarayanan et al., 2002). Therefore, we conducted several studies to improve communication between people in the text-chat environment where important elements for communication, such as facial expressions, do not exist. We examined various data collected from people with different levels of interpersonal trust and cognitive load, including chat contents (e. g., the number of assent words used), mouse movements (e. g., distance travelled by the mouse) and physiological signals (skin response). These data proved to be useful indicators for measuring the level of trust of the <b>communicators</b> and the cognitive load to which the <b>communicators</b> were exposed. These findings have implications for enhancing the communication and relationships between <b>communicators</b> in a text-chat environment and will assist system developers to design applications to measure the conditions the <b>communicators</b> are under when they use the text-chat environment to complete tasks in a business or government context and provide them with suitable assistance. In addition to using the previously mentioned data to measure trust and cognitive load, we further examined the text-chat environment by allowing <b>communicators</b> to see the actions of their partners in real time when they were trying to solve tasks. Our results show that when <b>communicators</b> are able to see the behaviors of their partners when they chat in the text-chat environment while completing tasks, it improves the level of interpersonal trust between them. Finally, in this thesis, we examined the effects of cooperation and cognitive load on interpersonal trust. The findings show that trust is significantly improved between <b>communicators</b> in the text-chat environment when the <b>communicators</b> act in a cooperative way and when they are under a low cognitive load...|$|R

For the 1970–71 season Shero again changed teams this time coaching in the Central Hockey League with the Omaha Knights, winning the league Championship. Although in the Rangers farm system for several years and winning at various levels, Shero was never seriously considered to replace Emile Francis as head coach, due to Shero's perceived alcohol problem and a belief that he was an ineffective <b>communicator.</b>|$|E
5|$|Belichick, {{who came}} to the Browns after 12 years mostly with the Giants under Bill Parcells, quickly made his mark by restricting media access to the team. He acted gruff or bored at press conferences, shrugging, rolling his eyes and often giving short answers to long questions. This bred the {{perception}} that the new coach was not a good <b>communicator</b> and lacked a vision for the team. Behind the scenes, however, he was trying to remake the Browns. He reformed Cleveland's scouting methods and, in conjunction with player personnel director Mike Lombardi, tried to form a coherent identity: a big and strong cold-weather team. Belichick's new way forward, however, did not immediately translate to on-field success. Cleveland's record only improved slightly in 1991 to 6–10 as the offense struggled to produce scoring drives and the defense was plagued by injuries. Kosar was a rare bright spot, passing for almost 3,500yards and 18 touchdowns. Bridging the end of the 1990 season and the beginning of 1991, the quarterback threw a then-record 307 straight passes without an interception. Kosar broke his ankle twice and sat out for most of the 1992 season, leaving quarterback Mike Tomczak under center. The team finished with a 7–9 record and did not make the playoffs.|$|E

Meyer used camera and set tricks to spare the construction of large and expensive sets. For a scene taking place at Starfleet Academy, a forced perspective was created by placing scenery close to the camera to give the sense the set was larger than it really was. To present the illusion that the Enterprises elevators moved between decks, corridor pieces were wheeled out of sight to change the hall configuration while the lift doors were closed. Background equipment such as computer terminals were rented when possible instead of purchased outright. Some designed props, such as a redesigned phaser and <b>communicator,</b> were vetoed by Paramount executives in favor of existing materials from The Motion Picture.|$|E
