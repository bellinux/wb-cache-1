In the literature there are various representations of the standard form of the wave equation from which different forms of the so called <b>cut-off</b> <b>frequency</b> are inferred. It is not uncommon that statements concerning the propagation behavior of waves are made {{which are based on}} the height dependence of a cutoff frequency. In this paper, first we critically discuss concepts resting on the use of <b>cut-off</b> <b>frequencies.</b> We add a further wave equation to three wave equations previously presented in the literature, yielding an additional <b>cut-off</b> <b>frequency.</b> Comparison among the various <b>cut-off</b> <b>frequencies</b> of the VAL-atmosphere reveals significant differences, which illustrate the difficulties of interpreting a height dependent <b>cut-off</b> <b>frequency.</b> We also discuss the <b>cut-off</b> <b>frequency</b> of the parabolic temperature profil...|$|R

40|$|Inverse {{dynamics}} {{analyses are}} commonly used to understand movement patterns in all forms of gait. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the effect of digital filtering procedures on the knee joint moments calculated during sprinting as an example of the possible influence of data analysis processes on interpretation of movement patterns. Data were obtained from three highly trained sprinters who completed a series of 30 m sprints. Ten different combinations of <b>cut-off</b> <b>frequency</b> were applied to the two-dimensional kinematic and kinetic input data with the kinetic <b>cut-off</b> <b>frequency</b> set equal to or higher than the kinematic <b>cut-off</b> <b>frequency.</b> When using the commonly adopted practice of filtering the kinetic data with a higher <b>cut-off</b> <b>frequency</b> than the kinematic data, exaggerated fluctuations in the knee joint moment existed soon after contact. In extreme cases, the knee moved between flexor, extensor and flexor dominance in less than 33 ms and through ranges exceeding 500 Nm. During an inverse dynamics analysis of locomotion, mismatched <b>cut-off</b> <b>frequencies</b> will likely affect the calculated joint moments if the <b>cut-off</b> <b>frequency</b> applied to the kinematic data is less than the true frequency content, particularly during impact phases. In the example of sprinting, exaggerated fluctuations in the knee joint moment appear to be data processing artefact rather than genuine characteristics of the joint kinetics. When the <b>cut-off</b> <b>frequencies,</b> and thus the frequency content of all input data, are matched, the fluctuations after contact are minimal and such a procedure is suggested for inverse dynamics analyses of gait...|$|R

40|$|SummaryRemoval of electrocardiographic (ECG) {{contamination}} of electromyographic (EMG) signals from torso muscles is often attempted by high-pass filtering. This {{study investigated the}} effects of the <b>cut-off</b> <b>frequency</b> used in this high-pass filtering technique on the resulting EMG signal. Surface EMGs were recorded on five subjects from the rectus abdominis, external oblique, and erector spinae muscles. These signals were then digitally high-pass filtered at <b>cut-off</b> <b>frequencies</b> of 10, 30, and 60 Hz. Integration and power analyses of the filtered EMGs were subsequently performed. It was found that an increase in the <b>cut-off</b> <b>frequency</b> affects the integrated EMG signal by (1) reducing the ECG contamination, (2) decreasing the amplitude, and (3) smoothing the signal. It was concluded that the use of a high-pass filter is effective in reducing ECG interference in integrated EMG recordings, and a <b>cut-off</b> <b>frequency</b> of approximately 30 Hz was optimal. RelevanceElectromyographic recordings of torso muscles are often used in the development of low-back biomechanical models. Unfortunately, these recordings are usually contaminated by electrocardiographic interference. High-pass filtering methods are sometimes used to diminish the influence of ECG from surface EMGs; however, {{the effects of the}}se filters on the recorded and processed EMG have not been reported. The findings show that high-pass filtering is effective in reducing ECG contamination and motion artefact from integrated EMGs when the appropriate <b>cut-off</b> <b>frequency</b> is used. Inappropriate <b>cut-off</b> <b>frequencies</b> lead to either incomplete ECG removal or excess filtering of the EMG signal...|$|R

The pseudomodes are shifted slightly in frequency with respect to p modes making possible the use of pseudomodes to determine the acoustic <b>cut-off</b> <b>frequency.</b> Using data from GOLF and VIRGO instruments on board the SOHO spacecraft, we calculate the acoustic <b>cut-off</b> <b>frequency</b> using the coherence function between both the velocity and intensity sets of data.

40|$|AbstractIn the {{analysis}} of movement data it is common practice to use a low-pass filter {{in order to reduce}} measurement noise. However, the choice of a <b>cut-off</b> <b>frequency</b> is typically rather arbitrary. The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate a new method to find the optimal <b>cut-off</b> <b>frequency</b> for filtering kinematic data. In particular, we propose to use rigid marker clusters to determine the dynamic precision of a given 3 D motion analysis system, and to use this precision as criterion to find the optimal <b>cut-off</b> <b>frequency</b> for filtering the data. We tested this method using a model-based approach in a situation in which measurement noise is a serious concern, namely the registration of the kinematics of swimming using a video-based motion analysis system. For the model data we found that filtering the data with a single cutoff frequency of 6 Hz under some conditions decreased the accuracy of the reconstruction of the kinematics compared to using the unfiltered data. If the <b>cut-off</b> <b>frequency</b> was used that yielded optimal dynamic precision, then the accuracy improved by 29 % compared to using raw data irrespective of the cluster position, close to the optimal accuracy improvement of 30 %. We confirmed in an experiment that the <b>cut-off</b> <b>frequency</b> at which optimal precision was found varied between cluster positions and subjects, similar to the results obtained with the model. We conclude that 3 D motion analysis systems can be made more accurate by optimising the <b>cut-off</b> <b>frequency</b> used in filtering the data with regard to their precision. Furthermore, the dynamic precision method seems useful to evaluate the effect of various filtering procedures...|$|R
