Applying the energy system model MARKAL and scenario analysis, this paper examines and quantifies the role of <b>clean</b> and <b>advanced</b> energy technologies for efficient local resource exploitation and improving energy security and environmental conditions. The main focus is on the power sector and the paper also addresses the potential ASEAN markets for European energy technologies. The paper concludes that there is a large potential market for <b>clean</b> and <b>advanced</b> energy technologies in the studied countries. If adopted, these technologies will bring several benefits like reduction in primary energy requirement, reduced investments requirement in the power sector and other parts of the energy infrastructure, reduced import of primary energy, reduced CO 2 emissions and local pollution, reduced energy system costs and marginal cost of electricity supply. Finally, barriers for transfer and diffusion of advanced energy technologies are discussed...|$|R

30|$|This section {{describes}} {{the basis of}} our model simulations to examine the impact of different BAMs. The Australian government’s previous carbon pricing policy used the carbon tax at the rate of A$ 23 per tonne of CO 2 equivalent with the exemption of agriculture, road transport and household sectors. In our experiments, we have used this carbon tax rate in each simulation scenarios. The government proposed a number of compensation plans outlining the ways the revenue collected through the tax will be used. They included compensation to selected manufacturers and exporters, reform of income tax thresholds and family tax benefits such as a <b>clean</b> energy <b>advance,</b> <b>clean</b> energy supplement and single income family supplement. These measures were quite complex, and it is hard to capture them all in a single model. In the model simulations, we adopt a modest and simplified compensation plan. We use in each scenario a revenue-neutral straightforward household compensation plan; that is, we transfer all of the carbon tax revenue in equal lump sums to households of the poorest six income deciles of the Australian economy.|$|R
