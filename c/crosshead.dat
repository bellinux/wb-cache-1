25|$|The tandem {{compound}} {{first appeared on}} the Erie Railroad in 1867. Like the Vauclain compound, a {{tandem compound}} has each pair of high- and low-pressure cylinders driving a common <b>crosshead,</b> connecting rod and crank; but unlike the Vauclain compound, the cylinders are mounted fore and aft of each other. The rear wall of the forward cylinder is usually the forward wall of the rear cylinder. The piston rod of the rear cylinder {{is connected to the}} <b>crosshead</b> in the usual way, but the forward cylinder may have its piston rod, or rods, in either of two forms: either the piston rod of the rear cylinder is extended forwards to also carry the forward piston; or if the forward cylinder be the low-pressure cylinder (and thus larger in diameter than the high-pressure cylinder behind), it may have two long piston rods which pass above and below, or to either side, of the high-pressure cylinder in order to reach the common <b>crosshead.</b>|$|E
25|$|The primary lead {{motion is}} {{provided}} by the <b>crosshead</b> arm (9) and the union link (11). This pivoting bar gives the in phase component of motion {{to the bottom of the}} combination lever (12).|$|E
25|$|The Phillips-head screw is a <b>crosshead</b> screw design {{lying in}} its {{self-centering}} property, useful on automated production lines that use power screwdrivers. The Phillips-head screw was invented and patented by Henry F. Phillips in 1936.|$|E
50|$|Soon after {{entering}} service, problems were experienced with failing connecting rods, big end bearings breaking {{up as well}} as cracks developing in the motion girder of the Alligator <b>crossheads.</b> After investigations by SAR engineers with assistance from the South African Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), the <b>crossheads,</b> slide bars and coupling rods were modified. The <b>crossheads</b> were converted to the multiple-bearing type with single guide bars while the three independent coupling rods were replaced with the more conventional single coupling rod with knuckle joints.|$|R
50|$|The Alligator type <b>crossheads</b> {{were split}} on the {{vertical}} centre line and clamped on {{to the end of}} the piston rods, which had three coned rings engaging in grooves in the <b>crossheads.</b> The original coupling rods differed from the usual in being three separate rods, thereby doing away with four knuckle joints and pins.|$|R
50|$|Soon {{after being}} placed in service, {{problems}} were experienced with failing connecting rods, big end bearings breaking up as well as cracks developing in the motion girder of the Alligator <b>crossheads.</b> After investigations by SAR engineers with assistance from South Africa's Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), the <b>crossheads,</b> slide bars and coupling rods were modified. The <b>crossheads</b> were converted to the multiple-bearing type with single guide bars, a more sophisticated method of filtering out the cylinder and valve lubricant from the exhaust steam replaced the original centrifuge while the three independent coupling rods were replaced with the more conventional single coupling rod with knuckle joints.|$|R
25|$|The <b>crosshead</b> engine, {{also known}} as a square, sawmill or A-frame engine, was a type of {{paddlewheel}} engine used in the United States. It was {{the most common type of}} engine in the early years of American steam navigation.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} to the air brake is the vacuum brake, in which a steam-operated ejector is mounted on the engine instead of the air pump, to create a vacuum and release the brakes. A secondary ejector or <b>crosshead</b> vacuum pump is used to maintain the vacuum in the system against the small leaks in the pipe connections between carriages and wagons. Vacuum systems existed on British, Indian, West Australian and South African railway networks.|$|E
25|$|Because the {{cylinder}} was placed above the crankshaft {{in this type}} of engine, it had a high center of gravity and was therefore deemed unsuitable for oceangoing service, so that its use was largely confined to vessels plying inland waterways. As marine engines grew steadily larger and heavier through the course of the century, the high center of gravity of square <b>crosshead</b> engines became increasingly impractical, leading to their abandonment by the 1840s in favor of the walking beam engine.|$|E
50|$|Engines with <b>crossheads</b> have piston rods. These include most steam {{locomotives}} {{and some}} large marine diesel engines.|$|R
50|$|The {{cylinders}} and frames {{were cast}} {{in one piece}} while the steel cylinders and steam chests were fitted with cast iron liners. The tender frame was also a one-piece steel casting. The Alligator type <b>crossheads</b> were split on the vertical centre line and clamped on {{to the end of}} the piston rods, which had three coned rings engaging in grooves in the <b>crossheads.</b> The original coupling rods differed from the usual in the provision of three independent rods, thereby doing away with four knuckle joints and pins.|$|R
50|$|The {{cylinders}} {{drove on}} the second pair of coupled wheels. The locomotives were fitted with the single slide-bar type piston <b>crossheads,</b> popular in Europe but prone to rapid wear under South African conditions. The valve spindle <b>crossheads</b> were screwed {{to the ends of}} the valve spindles and secured with locknuts. Although this made adjustment easier, it was not satisfactory in service and was later replaced by the usual taper fit with cotter pin. With these two exceptions, the mechanical parts of the Class 19 gave very little trouble.|$|R
25|$|General Taylors {{original}} builder is not known, but {{her original}} engine was {{supplied by the}} Allaire Iron Works of New York. The single-cylinder, 98 hp, 23 rpm engine was of the square <b>crosshead</b> type, with a 25.3 inch bore and 6-foot stroke. Steam was supplied by an iron flue boiler at an average working pressure of 20 psi. The paddlewheels were 16 feet in diameter and 4 feet 10 inches wide, with fourteen 1-foot 10-inch width paddles. The vessel had an average speed of 8 and a maximum speed of 9 knots.|$|E
25|$|Crank pin and <b>crosshead</b> {{bearings}} carry small cup-shaped reservoirs for oil. These have {{feed pipes}} to the bearing surface that start above the normal fill level, or are kept closed by a loose-fitting pin, {{so that only}} when the locomotive is in motion does oil enter. In United Kingdom practice the cups are closed with simple corks, but these {{have a piece of}} porous cane pushed through them to admit air. It is customary for a small capsule of pungent oil (aniseed or garlic) to be incorporated in the bearing metal to warn if the lubrication fails and excess heating or wear occurs.|$|E
25|$|The Class GL {{made use}} of Beyer, Peacock's {{standard}} lever-actuated Sterling-type steam-operated power reverser and a Pyle National Company turbo-generator. The piston valves were modern straight-ported types with long-lap, long-travel valves, used {{for the first time}} in a South African Garratt which made the Class GL very free-running and more efficient than its predecessors. The cylinders, of the same bore and stroke as those of the Class 14, drove the third coupled axles using long connecting rods which stabilised the locomotive by reducing vertical forces at the <b>crosshead</b> to a minimum. This method of design became the standard on most Beyer-Garratts thereafter.|$|E
5000|$|In a steam locomotive, {{the crank}} pins are usually mounted {{directly}} {{on one or}} more pairs of driving wheels, and the axle of these wheels serves as the crankshaft. The connecting rods (also called the main rods in US practice), run between the crank pins and <b>crossheads,</b> where they connect to the piston rods. <b>Crossheads</b> or trunk guides are also used on large diesel engines manufactured for marine service. (The similar rods between driving wheels are called side rods in US practice and coupling rods in British practice.) ...|$|R
50|$|The neo-classic frontage, though {{worn out}} by time, still {{displays}} some architectural details: cartouches with festoons {{on the first}} floor and ornaments on the top, or adorned window <b>crossheads.</b>|$|R
50|$|Some large slow-speed Diesel engines, {{particularly}} those for ships, use <b>crossheads</b> and piston rods. Medium- and high-speed diesel engines operate at faster speeds and so use lighter-weight trunk pistons.|$|R
25|$|In 1889 Samuel M. Vauclain of the Baldwin Locomotive Works {{devised the}} Vauclain {{compound}} locomotive. This design used a double-expansion engine fitted {{into the space}} occupied by a conventional single-expansion engine on the locomotive, using a single piston valve with conventional gear to control both the high- and low-pressure cylinders. The high-pressure cylinder could be placed above or below the low-pressure cylinder, each had its own piston rod connected to a common <b>crosshead,</b> so that one connecting rod and crank was required for each pair of cylinders. Substantial fuel efficiencies were achieved, but maintenance difficulties doomed the type. Most were converted to conventional engines.|$|E
25|$|On 10 October 1846, General Taylor {{caught fire}} while lying at the wharf of the Pensacola Navy Yard, and was {{burned to the}} water's edge. She was {{redesigned}} by F. Grice and rebuilt by G. Lyndal of Baltimore, a new engine and boiler being supplied {{at the same time}} by Charles Reeder & Sons of the same city. The new 187hp engine was of the <b>crosshead</b> type, with a 36-inch bore, 6-foot stroke and steam cut-off of 3 feet. The new boiler had a greater fire surface area (720 vs. 499 square feet) than the original, and a slightly higher operating pressure of 25 psi. The paddlewheel diameter was also enlarged by a foot, and the number of paddles reduced by one to thirteen. The new machinery appears to have been less efficient than the original, consuming twice the fuel for only a one-half knot increase in maximum speed. General Taylors hull dimensions remained the same after the rebuild as before.|$|E
25|$|The side-lever was an {{adaptation}} of the earliest form of steam engine, the beam engine. The typical side-lever engine {{had a pair of}} heavy horizontal iron beams, known as side levers, connected in the centre {{to the bottom of the}} engine with a pin; this connection allowed a limited arc in which the levers could pivot. These levers extended, on the cylinder side, to each side of the bottom of the vertical engine cylinder. A piston rod, connected vertically to the piston, extended out of the top of the cylinder. This rod attached to a horizontal <b>crosshead</b> which, at each end, was connected to vertical rods (known as side-rods). These rods connected down to the levers on each side of the cylinder. This formed the connection of the levers to the piston on the cylinder side of the engine. The other side of the levers (the opposite end of the lever pivot to the cylinder) were connected to each other with a horizontal crosstail. This crosstail in turn connected to and operated a single connecting rod, which turned the crankshaft. The rotation of the crankshaft was driven by the levers which, at the cylinder side, were driven by the piston oscillating vertically.|$|E
25|$|The locomotive's two {{cylinders}} {{were inside}} the frame and it was equipped with Stephenson valve gear. Its two feedwater pumps were actuated by the piston <b>crossheads.</b> As built, the engine had an open cab, but a cab roof was installed some years later.|$|R
5000|$|The {{renovation}} {{performed in}} 2016-2017, {{draws attention to}} the main elements of the facade: the bulging bay window on the left-hand side with its metal roof, the ornamented window <b>crossheads</b> and the neo-renaissance front gable, flanked by urns with a side railing.|$|R
50|$|Large {{two-stroke}} ship diesels {{are sometimes}} {{made to be}} reversible. Like four-stroke ship engines (some of which are also reversible) they use mechanically operated valves, so require additional camshaft mechanisms. These engine use <b>crossheads</b> to eliminate sidethrust on the piston and isolate the under-piston space from the crankcase.|$|R
500|$|The {{engine room}} on a bulker is usually near the stern, under the superstructure. Larger bulkers, from Handymax up, {{usually have a}} single {{two-stroke}} low-speed <b>crosshead</b> diesel engine directly coupled to a fixed-pitch propeller. Electricity is produced by auxiliary generators and/or an alternator coupled to the propeller shaft. On the smaller bulkers, one or two four-stroke diesels are used to turn either a fixed or controllable-pitch propeller via a reduction gearbox, which may also incorporate an output for an alternator. The average design ship speed for bulkers of Handysize and above is [...] The propeller speed is relatively low, at about 90 revolutions per minute, although {{it depends on the}} size of the propeller.|$|E
500|$|Constructing his designs proved {{far more}} {{difficult}} than Evans initially envisaged—with just six working steam engines in the United States at this time, {{and a handful of}} workshops with any experience making them, it took Evans much of his savings and two years to yield a working example to display to the public in 1803. This first engine was powered by a double-acting cylinder six inches in diameter and with a piston stroke length of eighteen inches. Many components, such as the flywheel and <b>crosshead,</b> were made of wood in order to simplify construction. The boiler, the engineering of which was critical to the safe operation of the engine, consisted of a large copper shell encased in wood and cast iron rings in order to contain the pressure. The output of the machine was approximately five horsepower. This work output was modest by contemporary standards—the low-pressure engine of the nearby waterworks produced about twelve horsepower. But his steam engine was just a fraction of the size of pre-existing machines—the waterworks machine was over twenty-five times larger in volume. Evans unveiled his engine at his store and put it to work crushing plaster of Paris and, more sensationally, sawing slabs of marble. The showmanship paid off, and thousands came to see the machine in operation, while the Philadelphia newspaper Aurora declared [...] "a new era {{in the history of the}} steam engine." ...|$|E
2500|$|The <b>crosshead</b> {{engine is}} {{described}} as having a vertical cylinder above the crankshaft, with the piston rod secured to a horizontal <b>crosshead,</b> from each end of which, {{on opposite sides of}} the cylinder, extended a connecting rod which rotated its own separate crankshaft. The <b>crosshead</b> operated within vertical guides that enabled the assembly to maintain the correct path as it moved. The engine's alternative name [...] "A-frame" [...] presumably derived from the shape of the frames supporting these guides. Some <b>crosshead</b> engines had more than one cylinder, in which case the piston rods were usually all connected to the same <b>crosshead.</b> An unusual feature of early examples of this type of engine was the installation of flywheelsgeared to the crankshaftswhich were thought necessary to ensure smooth operation. These gears could apparently be very noisy in operation.|$|E
5000|$|The corner {{tenement}} shows early {{elements of}} Art Nouveau style, {{in particular in}} the remaining motifs of both frontages: a cartouche above the corner entrance displays a man figure, all first level windows boast pediments and <b>crossheads</b> with vegetal motifs or flowered woman heads, {{in the spirit of}} Art Nouveau ornamentation.|$|R
50|$|Thompsons class L1 Adriatic {{suburban}} tank locomotives {{were another}} unsuccessful design. They were powerful machines {{that should have}} been well-suited to their duties but their 5 ft 2 inch wheels were too small for fast outer suburban services and they quickly knocked themselves apart. The axle boxes suffered, water tanks split, oil pipes broke off, and <b>crossheads</b> wore rapidly.|$|R
5000|$|The {{locomotive}} had flat [...] "D" [...] type sliding valves {{which were}} actuated by Heusinger valve gear, with Laird type <b>crossheads</b> with single slide bars. To protect the motion from wind-blown {{sand in the}} Namib Desert, it had plate shields arranged along {{the full length of}} the engine, hinged on the running board to allow access to the motion.|$|R
2500|$|The Siamese engine, also {{referred}} to as the [...] "double cylinder" [...] or [...] "twin cylinder" [...] engine, was another early alternative to the beam or side-lever engine. This type of engine had two identical, vertical engine cylinders arranged side-by-side, whose piston rods were attached to a common, T-shaped <b>crosshead.</b> The vertical arm of the <b>crosshead</b> extended down between the two cylinders and was attached at the bottom to both the crankshaft connecting rod and to a guide block that slid between the vertical sides of the cylinders, enabling the assembly to maintain the correct path as it moved.|$|E
2500|$|The back-acting engine, {{also known}} as the return {{connecting}} rod engine, was another engine designed to have a very low profile. The back-acting engine was in effect a modified steeple engine, laid horizontally across the keel of a ship rather than standing vertically above it. Instead of the triangular <b>crosshead</b> assembly found in a typical steeple engine however, the back-acting engine generally utilized a set of two or more elongated, parallel piston rods terminating in a <b>crosshead</b> to perform the same function. The term [...] "back-acting" [...] or [...] "return connecting rod" [...] derives {{from the fact that the}} connecting rod [...] "returns" [...] or comes back from the side of the engine opposite the engine cylinder to rotate a centrally located crankshaft.|$|E
2500|$|Henry Eckfords {{compound}} engine {{was of the}} vertical <b>crosshead</b> type. It had two cylinders—a high-pressure cylinder 12 inches in diameter and a 24 inch low-pressure cylinder—and a stroke of 4 feet. The engine operated at a pressure of about , well above the [...] common to marine steam engines of the period.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I'd {{better go}} soon," [...] said Lister. [...] "The braces I bolted on the pump won't hold long; she rocks and strains the shaft when she's running hard. I must get a proper casting {{made at a}} foundry. Besides, the engine <b>crosshead's</b> worn and jumps about. I must {{try to find a}} forge and machine-shop." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{tenement}} still retains nice architectural details. Windows on {{the first}} floor boast worked window sills and <b>crossheads</b> encapsulating a winged motif. Openings on the third floor are each separated by one large ornament. At the top of the facade runs a dentil. Highlight of this building is the presence in the corner of a round bay window stretching through two levels.|$|R
50|$|The locomotive's {{cylinders}} were mounted {{outside the}} frame and were lubricated by gravitation from two tallow cups, attached to the smokebox sides immediately above the steam chests. The feedwater pumps, attached {{to the back of}} the spectacle plate, were operated from the piston <b>crossheads.</b> The locomotive used wooden brake blocks which were driver-operated by a hand brake in the cab.|$|R
