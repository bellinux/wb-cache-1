5000|$|The {{mountain}} guides {{only had}} one long rope - 60 metres - with them. Hans Schlunegger just put it between his back and his rucksack (not into his rucksack) to save some time. This was not an unusual practice for them. Unfortunately when he made a sudden movement the rope dropped and fell down {{to the foot of}} the wall. As a result the team <b>combined</b> two shorter <b>ropes</b> to reach the required length; however the <b>combined</b> <b>ropes</b> still fell short. Kurz pulled up their rope, fixed it, and began his abseiling descent. He was stopped a mere couple of metres above his rescuers by the knot. To abseil any further he would have had to raise himself enough to release the pressure on the knot and let it pass through his gear. Desperately, Kurz tried to move himself past the knot, but in vain. Facing the futility of his situation, he said only [...] "Ich kann nicht mehr" [...] ("I can't on anymore") and died. His body was later recovered by a German team.|$|R
25|$|Mooring {{lines and}} hawsers {{may also be}} made by <b>combining</b> wire <b>rope</b> and {{synthetic}} line. Such lines are more elastic and easier to handle than wire rope, {{but they are not}} as elastic as pure synthetic line. Special safety precautions must be followed when constructing a combination mooring line.|$|R

25|$|By <b>combining</b> both <b>rope</b> and {{mesh bag}} {{approaches}} to bath sponge aquaculture in a “nursery period”, increases may occur in quality and production. In the nursery period method, sponges are initially cultivated in mesh bags until the explants have healed and regenerated to efficiently filter water. The regenerated explants are transferred onto rope to promote optimal growth till harvesting. This strategy is labour-intensive and costly, with growth rates and survival {{found to be}} no greater than when farming occurs solely via the mesh bag method.|$|R
500|$|Each tram car travels {{on a pair}} of 2inch (49mm) steel track ropes, totaling four cables. The track <b>ropes</b> <b>combined</b> are {{tensioned}} at {{over one}} million pounds (4.4 million newtons). A fifth cable—the haul rope—is a continuous loop which winds around the drive bullwheel at the lower station, connects to one car, winds through a counterweighted bullwheel at the upper station, then to the other car, before joining itself. [...] The haul rope length is over 7000feet (2100m).|$|R
40|$|The {{pattern of}} weaving by guy ropes in {{association}} with egg stalk was observed under scanning electron microscope in Panonychus citri (McGregor). The egg stalk was vertical having a base of 15. 5 μm wide and its length was 146 μm. Initially few guy ropes extended {{from the tip of}} the stalk to the leaf surface of host plant. The ropes rolled up to 125 μm on the stalk tip and were stretched towards the surface. Several thin <b>ropes</b> <b>combined</b> together to form strong strand. The ropes were roughly surfaced and possessed granular materials. The development of new net was accomplished with further extension of thinner ropes, which were twisted over the thicker ones and pasted on the leaf. Mites used adhesive material for the fixation of threads on the leaf as well as for webbing. The thick guy ropes were segregated before sticking on the leaf surface. The surface of the leaf was covered with adhesive, which was invisible. Several ropes overlaps the hatching egg vertically and horizontally. ...|$|R
5000|$|Topang {{literally}} means crutch. Traditional crutches in Southeast Asia {{were made}} up of a stick with a perpendicular handle attached about one third of the length down. The weaponized form is shorter, measuring only the length of a forearm. Traditionally made from bamboo or wood, they may also be constructed from steel. The most common form of the topang is the pancawangan sakti which is made of bamboo and has a 5 inch blade protruding from inside the shaft. Originating in northern Malaysia where it is most prevalent, several versions of the weapon exist. What {{is believed to be the}} earliest form consists of a rectangular slab of wood strapped to the fighter's forearm with <b>rope,</b> <b>combined</b> with a handle. Unlike its current form which is usually paired, this weapon was used defensively like a shield, and was typically used either on its own or with a sword. A modern variant known as the segu is entirely metal. The version used by law enforcement officers is called kayu-T, literally meaning [...] "T-stick".|$|R
40|$|An Electromyographic {{diagnosis}} {{of an injury}} to the distal portion of the right posterior and medial cords of the Brachial plexus in a 40 year old male due to a water skiing accident is described. Electromyography is an excellent objective method of examining muscles and the peripheral nervous system., Buchthal 1962, {{in order to determine}} the exact anatomical site and extent of a lesion, (Bauwens, 1960) and to make a prognosis based on objective data. A case history demonstrating the practical value of clinical electromyography follows: A 40 year old man sustained a flaccid paralysis of his right upper extremity in a water skiing accident on August 22 nd, 1976. At the time of the injury the patient was being towed on water skis, when another boat cut across his tow rope. The force of the boat hitting his tow <b>rope,</b> <b>combined</b> with the wakes of both boats, caused the patient to be thrown forcefully into the air, with his right arm forced behind his back. After hitting the water with a substantial impact, the patient noticed that he could not move his right arm. He also noted pain in the right shoulder. Examination revealed paralysis of the right deltoid, right triceps and extensor muscles of the right forearm and wrist. There was marked paresis of the muscles supplied by the ulnar nerve in the forearm and hand. Sensation was decreased to pinprick over the skin, on the lower part of the right deltoid, over the medial side of forearm and hand and over the dorsum of the right hand...|$|R
40|$|Recently, lake {{eutrophication}} {{has become}} a serious concern and its causes and controls have attracted growing attention worldwide. In the experiments described here, we have used Ipomoea aquatica as an experimental plant for use with ecological floating beds. Three kinds of combined ecological floating bed systems were constructed by hanging two kinds of rope (hemp and PST) below the beds, and their effectiveness for improving water quality was investigated. The {{results showed that the}} plant ecological floating bed, plant-PST- <b>rope</b> <b>combined</b> bed, and plant-hemp-rope combined bed provided significant removal effects on TN, NH 4 +-N, TP and DIP. Removal efficiencies were 39. 09 %, 49. 46 % and 60. 43 %, 44 % 55 %, 67. 79 %and 70. 05 %, 63. 68 %, 54. 72 % and 71. 70 %, and 53. 70 %, 50. 62 % and 64. 20 %, respectively. The plant-hemp-rope combined floating bed had especially high N and P removal rates. In the three kinds of ecological floating beds, the contributions of plant absorption to N and P removal were 36. 13 % and 71. 85 %, 32. 15 % and 87. 07 %, 27. 11 % and 74. 34 %, respectively. This suggested that for N removal in the system, plant uptake accounted for a relatively small portion of total absorption, and that denitrification by microorganisms might play a more important role. However, plant uptake took the leading role in P removal in all three kinds of floating beds. Therefore, the combined ecological floating bed having both ropes and plants was an effective way for improving the quality of eutrophic water...|$|R
40|$|Study {{on fishing}} {{operation}} of fyke net {{was conducted at}} reef waters at {{the west coast of}} Selayar Island from November 2008 to October 2010. The main objective of this research is to determine the best design and technical operation for environmental friendly catching of reef fish. Fyke net is chosen as an experimental fishing gear because its shape is a combination between basket trapnet ???bubu???, traditional fishing gear which is cosidered as environmental friendly fishing gear for catching coral reef fish and fence setnet (sero) shape. The first design of the experimantal fyke net follows the original shape, support with 5 rectangular steel frames and surrounding by 0. 75 inch of webbing 5 m in length, 1. 8 m in width and 1. 2 m in height. It has two 2 m fixed and 15 m flexible extended wings. Unlike ???bubu???, fyke net has not use bait for attracting the fish, therefore the entrance of fyke net should be large enough to make the fish entering freely. In two months of operations the fyke net did not show satisfactory results because the fish moved back and forward through the entrance of fyke net easily and the main problem was bycatch of turtels, therefore the second fyke net was designed. The new feature of the second fyke net was playground with rectangular vertical opening. The size of the opening was 150 x 15 cm devided into seven small entrances {{in order to protect the}} turtles entering the gear. To keep the fish inside the playground some 40 cm cableties are tied at the frame of the entrance functioning as shieves. In two months of operations the second fyke net was show better results however the new problem was the weight of the gear became heavier because of the increase of diameter of steelframe used, therefore, the third fyke net was designed to find a lighter gear. The third fyke net was supported by a rectangular polyvinil chloride (PVC) tube frames <b>combined</b> by polyethylene <b>ropes,</b> covered by 1. 25 inch of webbing. No more turtles was caught but more life reef fish was caught. To evaluate which design and methods of operation was better, three types of fyke nets and two methods of operations were examined. RAPFISH (Rapid Appraisal of Fish Status) is used to analyze which type of fyke net is the most suitable for reef fishing and to analyze the status of fyke net as an environmental friendly fishing gear. RAPFISH applies a statistical ordination technique called multi-dimensional scaling (MDS). Based on this analysis the third fyke net, lighter gear with PVC tube frames, shows the best value for it performance and technical operations, and fyke net is an environmental friendly fishing gear (value > 50. 0 in the range of 0 - 100). Ecological aspects gave the highest value for the status of fyke net as an environmental friendly fishing gear followed by ethical, technological, social and economical aspects...|$|R
