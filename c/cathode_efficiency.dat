50|$|The {{functional}} {{advantages of}} trivalent chromium are higher <b>cathode</b> <b>efficiency</b> and better throwing power. Better throwing power means better production rates.

50|$|One {{functional}} {{disadvantage of}} hexavalent chromium plating is low <b>cathode</b> <b>efficiency,</b> {{which results in}} bad throwing power. This means it leaves a non-uniform coating, with more on edges and less in inside corners and holes. To overcome this problem the part may be over-plated and ground to size, or auxiliary anodes may be used around the hard-to-plate areas.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the production of}} alloy nanoparticles of Co:Fe ratio 65 : 35 from Aotani solutions {{in the presence of}} high power ultrasound (20 kHz). The production of this new type of alloy nanoparticles was performed potentiostatically and galvanostatically at (298 ± 1) K using a newly designed experimental set-up i. e. a ‘sonoelectrode’ producing short applied current pulses triggered and followed immediately by ultrasonic pulses. It was shown that <b>cathode</b> <b>efficiencies</b> decreased with increasing current densities and high nanoparticle yields were obtained at low current densities. Morphological and structural studies of the produced nanoparticles were performed by TEM, SEM, XRD, and SAED, and showed that the strongly aggregated Co 65 Fe 35 alloy nanoparticles were predominantly formed, with prevalent body-centered cubic bcc crystalline structure; no redissolution of the nanoaggregates was observed and no separate Fe and Co metallic nanoparticles were produced sonoelectrochemically.

In this study, the pH value of the bath was controlled from 0. 5 to 3. 6 {{by the addition of}} hydrochloric acid or sodium citrate. The electrodeposited Fe-Ni film with the Fe content of approximately 22 at. % prepared at high pH (> 3) tends to show large coercivity (> 100 A/m), rough surface and relatively high <b>cathode</b> <b>efficiency</b> (> 70 %) whereas the films prepared at low pH (< 1) tend to show low coercivities (< 50 A/m), smooth surfaces and low cathode efficiencies (< 60 %). The Fe 22 Ni 78 film prepared from the bath without the pH adjuster of a hydrochloric acid or a sodium citrate shows low coercivity of 25 A/m, smooth surface and relatively high <b>cathode</b> <b>efficiency</b> of 65 %. Since low coercivity, smooth surface and high <b>cathode</b> <b>efficiency</b> are important factors for mass-producing Fe-Ni films, we concluded that a citric-acid-based bath with pH range from 1 to 3 is suitable for electrodeposition of soft magnetic Fe-Ni films...|$|E

40|$|In {{some ways}} it seems strange to talk about {{problems}} in closed-loop nickel recovery, when {{there are so many}} recovery systems operating today {{and there are so many}} platers who add virtually no nickel chemicals to their baths. Has the loop truly been closed by the recovery technologies available today or are substantial quantities of nickel still ending up as hazardous waste? As the EPA moves to restrict or possibly even to ban land disposal of this type of waste, what problems do nickel platers face and what alternatives do they have? This paper attempts to address these issues, to discuss possible ways to further close the loop, and the potential problems raised by them. Various papers (1, 2, 3) show that most systems which are designed as closed-loop recovery systems actually recover only 80 - 95 % of the nickel dragged out of the bath. Even when no nickel salts need to be added to the bath, this often represents substantially less than 90 - 95 % recovery of dragout, due to the 3 - 5 % difference between anode and <b>cathode</b> <b>efficiencies.</b> Most studies on this subject also fail to take into account significant nicke...|$|R
