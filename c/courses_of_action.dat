5|$|On 29 January 2008, the High Court {{handed down}} its ruling on Odex's appeal.

5|$|The {{inconclusive}} {{report was}} the subject of bitter and personal debate among Kennedy's senior advisers. Various <b>courses</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> towards Vietnam were discussed, such as fostering a regime change or taking a series of selective measures designed to cripple the influence of Ngô Đình Nhu, Diệm's brother and chief political adviser. Nhu and his wife Madame Ngô Đình Nhu were seen as the major causes of the political problems in South Vietnam. The inconclusive result of Krulak and Mendenhall's expedition resulted in a follow-up mission, the McNamara–Taylor mission.|$|E
5|$|It {{is likely}} that the castle evolved from the {{practice}} of fortifying a lordly home. The greatest threat to a lord's home or hall was fire as it was usually a wooden structure. To protect against this, and keep other threats at bay, there were several <b>courses</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> available: create encircling earthworks to keep an enemy at a distance; build the hall in stone; or raise it up on an artificial mound, known as a motte, to present an obstacle to attackers. While the concept of ditches, ramparts, and stone walls as defensive measures is ancient, raising a motte is a medieval innovation.|$|E
5|$|With few exceptions, these roads {{remained}} rudimentary {{and were}} impassible {{in bad weather}} and a nuisance in good weather, which limited the economic possibilities of those regions of Delaware and Maryland. The Good Roads Movement in the 1890s and 1900s spurred investment and advocacy for constructing all-weather roads that connected the population centers of the states, although the instigating forces in each state were different. State agencies in Maryland spearheaded the tasks of studying the issues and recommending increasingly effective <b>courses</b> <b>of</b> <b>action.</b> In Delaware, it was the philanthropic measure of a worldly man of one of Delaware's leading families that brought good roads {{to much of the}} state.|$|E

In the final variation, the decision maker evaluates each <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> generated and then chooses the most appropriate strategy. Expertise is crucial for using RPD, as it necessary to mentally simulate the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> events that might have led up to the observed situation and to evaluate the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> generated.|$|R

25|$|According to Herodotus, {{after the}} defeat, Xerxes {{presented}} Artemisia with two possible <b>courses</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> {{and asked her}} which she recommended.

25|$|Edward had {{returned}} to London, where he held his own parliament to discuss <b>courses</b> <b>of</b> <b>action.</b> Mortimer led his army east towards London as well, reaching St Albans in late July. The city of London refused to let Mortimer's forces in, and his forces placed the capital under effective siege. Lancaster arrived in August to support him and a tense stand-off ensued, with the younger Despenser threatening the rebels from a ship on the River Thames, and the barons threatening to begin to destroy royal properties and lands outside London unless he desisted.|$|E

Miles produced at least three witnesses who testified that Meigs had given orders. Meigs admitted to suggesting <b>courses</b> <b>of</b> <b>action,</b> but denied absolutely giving any orders.|$|E
25|$|Problems {{analogous}} to the trolley problem arise {{in the design of}} autonomous cars, in situations where the car's software is forced during a potential crash scenario to choose between multiple <b>courses</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> (sometimes including options which include the death of the car's occupants), all of which may cause harm. A platform called Moral Machine was created by MIT Media Lab to allow the public to express their opinions on what decisions autonomous vehicles should make in scenarios that use the trolley problem paradigm. Other approaches make use of virtual reality to assess human behavior in experimental settings.|$|E
25|$|The ethnic {{conflict}} in Sri Lanka {{can be traced}} to the independence of the island in 1948 from Britain. At the time a Sinhala majority government was instituted that passed legislation deemed discriminatory by the substantial Tamil minority population. In the 1970s two major Tamil parties united to form the Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF) that started agitating for a separate state of Tamil Eelam within the system in a federal structure in northern and eastern Sri Lanka that would grant the Tamils greater autonomy. Outside the TULF, however, factions advocating more radical and militant <b>courses</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> soon emerged, and the divisions started flaring into a violent civil war.|$|E
