40|$|Both Hexagenia (mayfly) nymphs and <b>Chironomus</b> (midge) <b>larvae</b> live in {{the soft}} sediments of Lake Erie, showing a {{non-overlapping}} mosaic distribution. The objective {{of this study was}} to quantify the importance of interactions between Hexagenia nymphs, and larval Chironomus. The field distributions of Hexagenia nymphs and chironomid larvae were analysed to examine the co-occurance of these two taxa. Little evidence of negative interactions between these taxa were found based on these analyses. Laboratory experiments were conducted that measured survivorship and increase in body length of Hexagenia nymphs and <b>Chironomus</b> <b>larvae</b> reared individually and together to determine the strength of competition for space between these taxa. The results of the experiments did not suggest competition for space. Duration effects were tested by adding <b>Chironomus</b> <b>larvae</b> to containers of Hexagenia nymphs at different stages in the development of Hexagenia. Chironomid larvae are present in the western Lake Erie sediments when Hexagenia are depositing their embryos. Laboratory experiments were conducted to determine if <b>Chironomus</b> <b>larvae</b> consume Hexagenia embryos. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

30|$|Because {{they are}} larger {{in size and}} heavier in dry biomass, chironomid larvae were {{preferred}} above fish larvae when present in equal or higher proportions. However, mosquitofish preferences switched to carp larvae when larval carp were present in higher proportions. For prey that differ in frequency of encounter and ease of capture but are similar in nutritional quality, optimal foraging theory predicts switching behaviour depending on the relative abundance of prey (Bence and Murdoch 1986, Schoener 1987, Krebs and Kacelnik 1991). Many fish species are able to switch from one feeding mode to another, {{depending on the size}} and concentration of the prey (Mookerji and Rao 1993). <b>Chironomus</b> <b>larvae</b> that were preferred in our two prey choice tests were not a preferred food types in a multispecies choice test. Note that previous fish experience with prey items may also have affected the preferences of prey. Mosquitofish were thoroughly exposed to the <b>Chironomus</b> <b>larvae</b> but not to the fish larvae, as fish larvae were added in the food of mosquitofish only occasionally. In nature, <b>Chironomus</b> <b>larvae</b> are commonly located {{at the bottom of a}} waterbody during the day but they migrate upwards at night and are not readily encountered by visual predators such as mosquitofish.|$|R
40|$|Chironomus Meigen (Diptera, Chironomidae) larvae {{are usually}} the largest sediment-burrowing chironomids, and as such often {{constitute}} {{a major part of}} the freshwater infaunal biomass. However, use of this genus in ecological, environmental and paleoecological studies is hampered by the fact that <b>Chironomus</b> <b>larvae</b> are difficult to identify to species because the larvae of many species are morphologically similar. We used a combination of morphological, cytological and genetic techniques to distinguish <b>Chironomus</b> <b>larvae</b> collected from 31 water bodies located in eastern Canada, producing 17 distinguishable groupings. These groups of larvae were ultimately identified as belonging to 14 known species (C. anthracinus, C. bifurcatus, C. cucini, C. decorus-group sp. 2, C. dilutus, C. entis, C. frommeri, C. harpi, C. maturus, C. nr. atroviridis (sp. 2 i), C. ochreatus, C. plumosus, C. staegeri and C. 'tigris') and three other species that remain unidentified (C. sp. NAI-III). No single approach served to delimit and identify larvae of all 17 Chironomus species that we collected. Although we expected that morphological criteria alone would be insufficient, our results suggest that DNA barcoding, using either the mitochondrial cox 1 or the nuclear gb 2 β gene, was also inadequate for separating some Chironomus species. Thus we suggest that multiple approaches will often be needed to correctly identify <b>Chironomus</b> <b>larvae</b> to species...|$|R

40|$|Measurements of {{ammonium}} and phosphate excretion by the <b>Chironomus</b> <b>larvae</b> {{were conducted}} in order to evaluate {{the importance of these}} chironomids for the internal loads of a small eutrophic urban reservoir. Ammonium and phosphate excretion rates by <b>Chironomus</b> <b>larvae</b> of small size (6 - 10 mm total length) were significantly higher than those of the Chironomids having medium (9 - 11 mm) and large (11 - 16 mm) sizes. A dependence in relation to temperature was recorded for the ammonium and phosphate excretions that was significantly higher at 25 °C than at 20 and 15 °C. Through a linear relation between biomass (dry weight) and total length and, between excretion and biomass and, data on chironomids densities, after an intense sampling in 33 sites distributed all along the reservoir bottom, the mean phosphate and ammonium excretion rates corresponded to 2, 014 ± 5, 134 µg. m- 2 /day and 1, 643 ± 3, 974 µg. m- 2 /day, respectively. Considering the mean biomass (34 mg. m- 2) of Chironomus, the lake area (88, 156 m²) and the mean excretion rates, the contribution of benthic chironomids to the internal loads would be 181 KgP and 147 KgN. for the sampling months (October-November 1998).

Dissolved oxygen was low on many occasions at all the stations except Maa Chandrika Devi and chemical oxygen demand values were high. There was a gradual increase in mean nitrite and phosphate values from up to downstream. Benthic fauna was dominated by oligochaetes and <b>chironomus</b> <b>larvae.</b> Other groups reported were leeches, nematodes, sponges, crustaceans, pelycypodes, gastropods and fish fry. Population density was exceptionally high at Daliganj (20, 135 m sub(- 1)) followed by Ambedkar Park (5, 199 m sub(- 1)) and Aquaduct (3, 287 m sub(- 1)), and low at Maa Chandrika Devi (264 m sub(- 1)). Oligochaete genera common at all the four stations were Lumbricillus, Limnodrillus, Branchiura, Chaetogaster, Nais and Tubifex. Odonates were reported only from Maa Chandrika Devi while sponges were encountered at Daliganj and Aquaduct. On some occasions, fish fry were also found at Ambedkar Park and Aquaduct. Seasonally, maxima for population density were observed during pre-monsoon and minima during monsoon.

40|$|WOS:A 1985 ATH 7300001 International audienceThe predatory {{behaviour}} of last instar Anax imperator larvae varied {{according to the}} type of prey offered.

Predation of Gastropoda was characterized by long sequences including many successive orientation of the predator towards its potential prey and a high success rate. Predation on Trichoptera larvae generally included complex manipulations of cases.

Predation on the other three species presented some individual characteristics but showed great overall similarity: the success rates were only average, ingestion was short and few manipulations occurred before ingestion.

Evaluation of predation by R. sikkimensis on <b>Chironomus</b> sp. <b>larvae,</b> in the laboratory, revealed that a single adult morph of R. sikkimensis could kill and consume on an average 10 – 90 and 10 – 78 numbers of small and large <b>Chironomus</b> sp. <b>larvae,</b> respectively, per day, depending on the prey density. The attack rate ranged between 520 and 537, and the handling time ranged between 4. 3 and 8. 6 {{depending on the size of}} the preys. The predation varied with respect to predator density also, with a maximum of 151 larvae killed by three predators per day.

A laboratory culture of an Israeli benthic midge, Chironomus luridus, was exposed to copper sulfate. Two conditions were tested in bioassay experiments: larvae within silt tubes and larvae without tubes. The non toxic, anionic, fluorescent dye, fluorescein, was used to examine the effect of sub-lethal copper sulfate concentrations on the permeability of cuticular, gill and gut epithelia of the chironomids. Increased cell permeability, which is the cause of cell damage, was reflected by an increase in fluorescence intensity. Following exposure to copper sulfate, higher fluorescence was found in different body compartments: midgut, hindgut, tracheal gills, fat body and muscles, and the Malpighian tubules. The effect was significantly higher in tube-free larvae when compared to silt tube dwelling larvae.

The fish tested were Channel catfish, Ictalurus punctatus, Rainbow trout, Salmo gairdneri, and Malacca Tilapia hybrids. The major objectives were to establish survival rates, growth rates, stocking schedules, and maximum stocking densities for these fish in an unusual and highly productive environment. Less than 1 % survival occurred in five trout experiments and in one catfish experiment. An important cause of mortality was low sunrise oxygen tensions resulting from respiration of dense phytoplankton blooms which were stimulated in part by high (14 mg/l) average inflow orthophosphate concentrations.

In the present study we investigated the application of benthic microbial community composition, as determined by phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis, alongside aquatic insect data in 25 peatland ditches {{in the province of}} North Holland, The Netherlands. We applied clustering and principal component analysis to a matrix of 26 PLFAs to group ditches by the microbial community. Generalized linear models were used to examine correlations between microbial PLFAs, insects, vegetation (emergent and submerged) and abiotic factors. The ratio of heterotrophic (e. g. sulphate reducing bacteria) to autotrophic (e. g. algae and cyanobacteria) derived PLFAs could be estimated as the ratio between saturated and branched to monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids (SB/MP). SB/MP was correlated with insect community composition, differences in water chemistry (in particular bicarbonate, sulphate and nutrients) and vegetation cover in the ditches. Moreover, ditches distinguished by their microbial communities differed in the number of insects they supported with differences most pronounced for Odonata, Trichoptera and <b>Chironomus</b> <b>larvae.</b> This study demonstrates that integrating microbial and aquatic insect community data provides insight into key environmental drivers in modified aquatic ecosystems and may facilitate the development of remediation strategies for degraded wetlands...|$|R

40|$|Although generalist predators {{have been}} {{reported}} to forage less efficiently than specialists, there is little information {{on the extent to which}} learning can improve the efficiency of mixed-prey foraging. Repeated exposure of silver perch to mixed prey (pelagic Artemia and benthic <b>Chironomus</b> <b>larvae)</b> led to substantial fluctuations in reward rate over relatively long (20 -day) timescales. When perch that were familiar with a single prey type were offered two prey types simultaneously, the rate at which they captured both familiar and unfamiliar prey dropped progressively over succeeding trials. This result was not predicted by simple learning paradigms, but could be explained in terms of an interaction between learning and attention. Between-trial patterns in overall intake were complex and differed between the two prey types, but were unaffected by previous prey specialization. However, patterns of prey priority (i. e. the prey type that was preferred at the start of a trial) did vary with previous prey training. All groups of fish converged on the most profitable prey type (chironomids), but this process took 15 - 20 trials. In contrast, fish offered a single prey type reached asymptotic intake rates within five trials and retained high capture abilities for at least 5 weeks. Learning and memory allow fish to maximize foraging efficiency on patches of a single prey type. However, when foragers are faced with mixed prey populations, cognitive constraints associated with divided attention may impair efficiency, and this impairment can be exacerbated by experience.

Field water with dry and sieved, organic matter-free, and nontreated sediments was used to determine the toxicity of heavy metals that enter the organism through ingested material. In both in situ and laboratory bioassays, body length increase was significantly inhibited by metal contamination, whereas head capsule width was not affected. Body length increase was more affected by contaminated sediment compared to contaminated water. The lowest-effect level of heavy metals was observed in the dry and sieved sediment that prevented ingestion of sediment particles by larvae. These results suggest that body length increase of C. riparius larvae can be used to indicate the impact of metal contamination in rivers. <b>Chironomus</b> riparius <b>larvae</b> are more affected by heavy metals that enter the organism through ingested sediment than by heavy metals dissolved in the water column.

No adverse effects on the larvae, for the investigated end-points (survival and deformity induction), were found. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B. V. AII rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|A bacia hidrográfica do rio Piracicaba é considerada uma das mais poluídas do estado de São Paulo. Está localizada em uma região com alta densidade populacional e acentuado desenvolvimento da agroindústria e de indústrias químicas, têxteis, metalúrgicas, eletroeletrônicas, automotivas e de papel e celulose. Diante deste cenário, o objetivo deste trabalho foi analisar a incidência de deformidades morfológicas no mento de <b>larvas</b> de <b>Chironomus</b> em corpos dágua que integram esta bacia, principalmente na sub-bacia do ribeirão Quilombo. Foram {{realizadas}} análises de características físicas e químicas da água e do sedimento, testes ecotoxicológicos e de mutagenicidade e análise da comunidade bentônica em dez pontos de coleta, no mês de agosto de 2007. A influência dos esgotos domésticos nos pontos amostrados foi evidenciada através da análise da água superficial e de fundo, que no geral, apresentou resultados fora dos limites estabelecidos pela Resolução CONAMA 357 / 2005. No sedimento foi detectada a presença de metais e de HPAs em concentrações acima dos limites estabelecidos pela Resolução CONAMA 344 / 04, além de efeito tóxico agudo para <b>larvas</b> de <b>Chironomus</b> sancticaroli e Hyalella azteca. Melhor condição ambiental para a comunidade bentônica foi verificada no ribeirão Jacuba e no rio Piracicaba, a montante do ribeirão Quilombo, correspondendo às áreas mais preservadas. As maiores incidências de deformidades morfológicas no mento de Chironomus avaliadas nas amostras de sedimento foram verificadas em dois pontos localizados no rio Piracicaba (Pontos 2 e 3), a jusante do ribeirão Quilombo, com 25, 3 % e 36, 3 % de deformidades, respectivamente, sendo a falta de dentes o tipo mais comum. Através dos resultados da incidência de deformidades observada nas <b>larvas</b> de <b>Chironomus</b> coletadas na vegetação alguns pontos localizados nas sub-bacias dos ribeirões Quilombo e Tatu puderam ser mais bem avaliados, em termos de qualidade ambiental, pois no sedimento não havia número significativo de larvas. Na maioria dos pontos amostrados não foi verificada uma correspondência direta entre a freqüência de deformidades e o nível bruto de contaminantes, a exceção do zinco. Sugere-se o valor de 2 % como limite para a incidência natural de deformidades em ambientes não impactados, devendo ser realizadas novas investigações em locais de referência no país, visando a inclusão desta variável em programas de monitoramento da qualidade ambiental. The Piracicaba {{river basin}} {{is considered one}} of the most polluted in the state of São Paulo. It is located in a region with high population density in addition to great development of agribusiness and chemical, textiles, metals, electronics, automotive and paper industries. The objective of this study was to analyze the incidence of morphological deformities in the mentum of <b>Chironomus</b> <b>larvae</b> of this basin, especially in the basin of Quilombo stream. Physical and chemical analysis were performed in water and sediment, ecotoxicological and mutagenicity tests and analysis of the benthic community at ten sampling sites in August 2007. The influence of domestic sewage in the sampling sites was evidenced by analysis of surface and bottom water, which in general, gave results outside the limits established by CONAMA Resolution 357 / 2005. In the sediment it was detected the presence of metals and PAHs at higher concentrations than the limits established by CONAMA Resolution 344 / 04, besides the acute toxicity to Chironomus sancticaroli and Hyalella azteca larvae. The best environmental condition for the benthic community was observed in Jacuba stream and Piracicaba river, upstream of the Quilombo stream, which corresponds to the most preserved area. The major incidence of morphological deformities in the mentum of Chironomus evaluated in sediment samples were observed at two points located in the Piracicaba river (Points 2 and 3), downstream of the Quilombo stream, with 25. 3 % and 36. 3 % of deformities, respectively, and the lack of teeth was the most common type of deformity. In terms of environmental quality, <b>Chironomus</b> <b>larvae</b> collected in vegetation offered an additional parameter for some sites, because the sediment offered no significant number of larvae. In most of sampling sites it was not observed a direct correlation between the frequency of gross deformities and the level of contaminants, with the exception of zinc. It is suggested the value of 2 % for the limit of natural incidence of deformities in non-impacted environments. Further investigations should be conducted in reference sites in the country, with the objective to include this variable in monitoring programs of environmental quality...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Regulation of RNA {{polymerase}} II (RNAPII) during transcription {{is essential}} for controlling gene expression. Here we report that the transcriptional activity of RNAPII at the Balbiani ring 2. 1 gene could be halted during stable elongation in salivary gland cells of <b>Chironomus</b> tentans <b>larvae</b> for extended time periods in a regulated manner. The transcription halt was triggered by heat shock and affected all RNAPII independently of {{their position in the}} gene. During the halt, incomplete transcripts and RNAPII remained at the transcription site, the phosphorylation state of RNAPII was unaltered, and the transcription bubbles remained open. The transcription of halted transcripts was resumed upon relief of the heat shock. The observed mechanism allows cells to interrupt transcription for extended time periods and rapidly reactivate it without the need to reinitiate transcription of the complete gene. Our results suggest a so-far-unknown level of transcriptional control in eukaryotic cells...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to improve the cause-effect {{relationship}} between toxicant exposure and chironomid mouthpart deformities, by linking induction of mouthpart deformities to contaminated field sediments, metal mixtures and a mutagenic polycyclic aromatic compound metabolite (acridone). Mouthpart deformities in <b>Chironomus</b> riparius <b>larvae</b> were induced by both the heavy metal mixture and by acridone. A clear correlation between metal concentrations in the sediment and deformities incidence was only observed when the contaminated field sediments were left out of the analysis, probably because these natural sediments contained other toxic compounds, which could be responsible for a higher incidence of deformities than predicted by the measured metal concentrations only. The present study clearly improved the cause-effect relationship between toxicant exposure and the induction of mouthpart deformities. It is concluded that the incidence of mouthpart deformities may better reflect the potential toxicity of contaminated sediments than chemical analysis...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of nascent RNA in chromosome region I- 18 C was {{revealed by the}} method of induced hybrid formation (IEH) and by use of anti-RNA: DNA antibodies. IEH signals were quantitated, and used {{as a measure of}} transcriptional activity in the region. The expansion of the I- 18 C region was also determined and used as an indication of local chromatin decondensation. <b>Chironomus</b> tentans <b>larvae</b> may undergo oligopause or they may develop subitaneously. It was found that the course of basal activity in I- 18 C differs substantially in these two modes of development. Most interestingly they also differ in activation of I- 18 C in response to in vitro ecdysterone treatment. Changes in hormonal responsiveness of I- 18 C parallel changes in the preexisting state of I- 18 C decondensation. Oligopause stage 5 animals, being most refractory in this respect, exhibit the most condensed I- 18 C chromosome region...|$|R
40|$|Single {{molecule}} {{observation in}} cells and tissue allows {{the analysis of}} physiological processes with molecular detail, but it still represents a major methodological challenge. Here we introduce a microscopic technique that combines light sheet optical sectioning microscopy and ultra sensitive high-speed imaging. By this approach {{it is possible to}} observe single fluorescent biomolecules in solution, living cells and even tissue with an unprecedented speed and signal-to-noise ratio deep within the sample. Thereby we could directly observe and track small and large tracer molecules in aqueous solution. Furthermore, we demonstrated the feasibility to visualize the dynamics of single tracer molecules and native messenger ribonucleoprotein particles (mRNPs) in salivary gland cell nuclei of <b>Chironomus</b> tentans <b>larvae</b> up to 200 µm within the specimen with an excellent signal quality. Thus single molecule light sheet based fluorescence microscopy allows analyzing molecular diffusion and interactions in complex biological systems...|$|R
