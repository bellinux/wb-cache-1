Enterprise models {{cover all}} aspects of modern enterprises, from accounting, through {{management}} of <b>custom</b> orders and <b>invoicing,</b> to operational data such as records on machines and workers.

In particular, we describe how to extract data from the enterprise model for solving the scheduling problem using constraint-based solvers...|$|R
