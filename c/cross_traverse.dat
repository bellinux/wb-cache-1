The rover should be capable of rough terrain <b>crossing,</b> <b>traversing</b> human made obstacles (such as stairs and doors), and moving through human and robot occupied spaces without collision. The rover is also to evidence considerable decision making ability, navigation and path planning skills. These goals came from the concept that the robot should have the abilities of both a planetary rover and a hazardous waste site scout...|$|R

Among those, {{the most notable}} ones are the [...] Krapinčica Viaduct and the [...] Sveta Tri Kralja Tunnel. The tunnel {{is part of a}} sequence of two tunnels and three viaducts in a [...] segment between Krapina and Đurmanec. Generally, the Krapina–Macelj border crossing segment of the A2 motorway required numerous expensive engineering works, including six tunnels and nine viaducts, which caused the construction cost to be over 235 million euros.|$|R

While serving as the 30th Arkansas Infantry its colors were captured by the 2nd Ohio Infantry at the Battle of Murfreesboro, Tennessee, on December 31, 1862. The flag was returned to the State of Arkansas by the U.S. War Department in 1905. The flag measures 40inches on the staff by 46inches on the fly. It is composed of a blue cotton field, bordered on all sides with white cotton, 3inches wide, with a white St. Andrew's <b>cross</b> <b>traversing</b> the blue field. In black painted outline figures, 2-1/2inches high, is the designation 30TH REG, ARK INF on the upper and lower borders, respectively. Two battle honors—FARMINGTON MISS and RICHMOND KY—appear in white painted outline letters, in the upper and lower quadrants, respectively, formed by the white cross.

30|$|A {{comparative}} study of the VES curve in Fig.  6 shows that VES- 13 represents a KH type of curve, {{while the rest of}} the curves further south along the traverse show a predominantly HA type of trend. A sudden change in the shape of the resistivity curve (VES- 13) probably indicates some structural control. EPF <b>crossing</b> is the <b>traverse</b> somewhere between VES- 14 and VES- 15 according to (Sahu et al. 2010), but the exact location of EPF may be a little north, near VES- 13 (Fig.  1 d). A change in the shape of the VES between GopalpurMathai and Sewanat Halt may be due the fact that EPF <b>crosses</b> the <b>traverse</b> between these two places. The coarse sand bed also pinches out in between the stretch marked by VES- 13 and VES- 14, revealing that the older course of Sone river is controlled by the tectonic activity of the region (Sahu et al. 2010) and further south from VES- 13 older alluvium of Pleistocene age is exposed.|$|R

50|$|Cross-boundary {{subsidies}} {{are caused by}} organisms or materials that <b>cross</b> or <b>traverse</b> habitat patch boundaries, subsidizing the resident populations. The transferred organisms and materials may provide additional predators, prey, or nutrients to resident species, which can affect community and food web structure. Cross-boundary subsidies of materials and organisms occur in landscapes composed of different habitat patch types, and so depend on characteristics of those patches and on the boundaries in between them. Human alteration of the landscape, primarily through fragmentation, {{has the potential to}} alter important cross-boundary subsidies to increasingly isolated habitat patches. Understanding how processes that occur outside of habitat patches can affect populations within them may be important to habitat management.|$|R

50|$|Descendants of {{the common}} walking stick, {{trekking}} poles are usually used by hikers {{for the same reasons}} — to provide some rhythm to their walking pace and for added support. On flat, smooth terrain they really aren't necessary although using them can increase the exercise a hiker gets from the trip, as well as increase the speed. But on less certain terrain, or steep slopes, they provide useful lateral stability, and many turn to them for help with knee pain. They can also be used as aids when climbing rocks or boulders, to probe the depth of mud or water and facilitate a <b>crossing.</b> When <b>traversing</b> steep slopes for long distances, some hikers make one pole shorter than the other to make those trips feel more as if they were taking place on level ground.|$|R
