5|$|Imprisoned debtors {{were allowed}} some social contact, but the regime for criminals was {{designed}} to be one of isolation, according to the separate system. Consequently, the seating in the prison chapel is designed to enclose each prisoner individually so that the preacher could see everyone but each <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>only</b> him. By 1878 the system was discredited and the inmates were transferred to the new gaol in the eastern outskirts of Lincoln. The prison in the castle was left without a use until the Lincolnshire Archives were housed in its cells.|$|E
25|$|First {{trying to}} examine the hole with a {{flashlight}} from above Gómez <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>only</b> darkness, so tied with a line of heavy rope around his waist he was lowered by several colleagues, and descending into the murk {{he realized it was}} a perfectly cylindrical shaft. At the bottom he came to rest in apparently ancient construction – a man-made tunnel, blocked in both directions by immense stones. Gómez was acquainted that archaeologists had previously discovered a narrow tunnel underneath the Pyramid of the Sun, and supposed he was now observing a kind of similar mirror tunnel, leading to a subterranean chamber beneath Temple of the Feathered Serpent. He decided initially to elaborate clear hypothesis and to obtain approval. Meanwhile, he erected a tent over the sinkhole to preserve it from {{the hundreds of thousands of}} tourists who visit Teotihuacán. Researchers reported that the tunnel was believed to have been sealed in 200 CE.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} Broadway production {{opened at}} the Majestic Theatre on April 19, 1945. [...] The dress rehearsal the day before had gone badly, and the pair feared the new work would not be well received. [...] One successful last-minute change was to have de Mille choreograph the pantomime. [...] The movement of the carnival crowd in the pantomime had been entrusted to Mamoulian, and his version was not working. [...] Rodgers had injured his back the previous week, and he watched the opening from a stretcher propped in a box behind the curtain. [...] Sedated with morphine, he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>only</b> part of the stage. [...] As he could not hear the audience's applause and laughter, he assumed the show was a failure. [...] It was not until friends congratulated him later that evening that {{he realized that the}} curtain had been met by wild applause. [...] Bambi Linn, who played Louise, was so enthusiastically received by the audience during her ballet that she was forced to break character, when she next appeared, and bow. [...] Rodgers' daughter Mary caught sight of her friend, Stephen Sondheim, both teenagers then, across several rows; both had eyes wet with tears.|$|E

500|$|The first {{volley of}} gunfire killed the Tsar, the Empress and two male servants, and wounded the family's {{doctor and the}} empress' maidservant. Maria tried to escape through the doors {{at the rear of}} the room, which led to a storage area, but the doors were nailed shut. The noise as she rattled the doors {{attracted}} the attention of the drunken military commissar Peter Ermakov. [...] A heavy layer of smoke had accumulated in the room from the gunfire and from plaster dust released from the walls by errant bullets, and the gunmen <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>only</b> the lower bodies of those who were still alive. [...] Ermakov fired at Maria, and his bullet struck her in the thigh. She fell to the floor with Anastasia and Demidova and lay there moaning. [...] The assassins then left the room for several minutes to let the haze clear, and when they returned they killed Dr Botkin, Tsarevich Alexei and Grand Duchesses Olga and Tatiana. [...] Ermakov then turned on the wounded Maria and Anastasia, who was still unharmed. He struggled with Maria and tried to stab her with a bayonet. [...] The jewels sewn into her clothes protected her, and he said he finally shot her in the head. [...] But the skull that is almost certainly Maria's has no bullet wound. [...] Perhaps the drunken Ermakov inflicted a scalp wound, knocking her unconscious and producing a considerable flow of blood, leading Ermakov to think he had killed her. [...] He then struggled with Anastasia, whom he also claimed he shot in the head. [...] As the bodies were being removed from the house, Maria regained consciousness and screamed. Ermakov tried to stab her again but failed, and struck her in the face until she was silent. [...] The facial area of Maria's skull was indeed destroyed, but Yurovsky wrote that the victims' faces were shattered with rifle butts at the burial site. [...] Though Maria unquestionably died with her family, the exact cause of her death remains a mystery.|$|E
2500|$|An {{animated}} Sesame Street skit {{involved a}} man called Uncle Gus [...] "and all of us" [...] (a group of kids, of which the narrator, Sonia Manzano, was a part) taking a ride on a bus to Ho-Ho-Kus. The {{back of the bus}} had a hippopotamus and a snuffleupagus. As the skit was written back when Mr. Snuffleupagus was still [...] "imaginary" [...] to the adults on the street, the kids naturally saw both animals, but Uncle Gus <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>only</b> the hippo.|$|E

6000|$|Nevertheless, he {{was still}} {{trembling}} {{when they reached the}} edge of a farm-yard clearing beyond the swamp. It was gray-dark. They <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>only</b> the mass of a barn and a farmer's cabin, both new to Carl. Holding her hand, he whispered: ...|$|E

60|$|She did {{not move}} or answer, but {{remained}} with her face turned full away, so that he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>only</b> the contour of her cheek. After waiting awhile, he flushed, turned swiftly and set his machine rattling. In a moment he was racing between the trees.|$|E
60|$|There {{seemed to}} be a rushing in his ears through which pierced sharp, ringing clip-clop of iron hoofs. He <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>only</b> the corner of the street.

60|$|It was {{daylight}} {{when they}} {{crawled out of}} the cabin after the meal, but the sky was hidden by low-flying vapor, and gazing seaward they <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>only</b> a short stretch of big leader combers which rolled {{up out of the}} haze crested with livid froth.

25|$|In the 17th century, Giovanni Cassini {{observed}} that he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> Iapetus <b>only</b> {{on the west}} side of Saturn and never on the east.

60|$|It {{was very}} dark now, for {{a bank of}} clouds hid {{the glory of the}} evening sky, and he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>only</b> the mere outline of the woman whom he so passionately loved, the small head with the {{fluttering}} curls fanned by the wind, the graceful shoulders and arms folded primly across her bosom.|$|E
60|$|He {{stood over}} her a moment, {{masculine}} and mysterious in his immobility, before {{he sat down}} on a chair near by.

60|$|And at last Mr. Bessel did {{a desperate}} thing. I have told how {{that in some}} strange way he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> not <b>only</b> the outside of a man as we see him, but within.
