5|$|Hale–Bopp became {{visible to}} the naked eye in May 1996, and {{although}} its rate of brightening slowed considerably during the latter half of that year, scientists were still <b>cautiously</b> <b>optimistic</b> that it would become very bright. It was too closely aligned with the Sun to be observable during December 1996, but when it reappeared in January 1997 it was already bright enough to be seen by anyone who looked for it, even from large cities with light-polluted skies.|$|E
5|$|Unlike most of Fagen's {{previous}} work, The Nightfly {{is almost}} blatantly autobiographical. Many {{of the songs}} relate to the <b>cautiously</b> <b>optimistic</b> mood of his suburban childhood in the late 1950s and early 1960s, and incorporate such topics as late-night jazz disc jockeys, fallout shelters, and tropical vacations. Recorded over eight months at various studios between New York City and Los Angeles, the album is an early example of a fully digital recording in popular music. The nascent technology, {{as well as the}} perfectionist nature of its engineers and musicians, made the album difficult to record.|$|E
25|$|Roosevelt's {{attacks on}} Wilson helped the Republicans win control of Congress in the off-year {{elections}} of 1918. He declined {{a request from}} New York Republican to run for another gubernatorial term, but attacked Wilson's Fourteen Points, calling instead for the unconditional surrender of Germany. He was <b>cautiously</b> <b>optimistic</b> about the proposed League of Nations, but had reservations about its impact on United States sovereignty. Roosevelt was popular enough to contest the 1920 Republican nomination, but his health was broken by 1918 due to the lingering effects of malaria. His family and supporters threw their support behind Roosevelt's old military companion, General Leonard Wood, but Taft supporter Warren G. Harding defeated Wood on the tenth ballot of the 1920 Republican National Convention.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of its {{contribution}} to Allied victory in the First World War, Canada became more assertive and less deferential to British authority. Convinced that Canada had proven itself on the battlefields of Europe, Prime Minister Sir Robert Borden demanded that it have a separate seat at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919. This was initially opposed not only by Britain but also by the United States, which saw such a delegation as an extra British vote. Borden responded by pointing out that since Canada had lost nearly 60,000 men, a far larger proportion of its men, its right to equal status as a nation had been consecrated on the battlefield. British Prime Minister David Lloyd George eventually relented, and convinced the reluctant Americans to accept the presence of delegations from Canada, India, Australia, Newfoundland, New Zealand, and South Africa. These also received their own seats in the League of Nations. Canada asked for neither reparations nor mandates. It played only a modest role at Paris, but just having a seat was a matter of pride. It was <b>cautiously</b> <b>optimistic</b> about the new League of Nations, in which it played an active and independent role.|$|E
500|$|Puffy {{expressed}} his respect for Mariah and her craft, mentioning that she re-did her vocals many times until she {{felt they were}} perfect. After they had the vocals, Carey and Puffy began working on the song's hook and incorporating the music samples and blending them into the bridge and chorus. After the song was completed, Combs was very confident with the song, calling it [...] "slammin'," [...] but because of its heavy hip-hop influence, he felt only <b>cautiously</b> <b>optimistic</b> about the song's commercial success. On a more personal note, [...] "Honey" [...] served as Carey's first single after her separation from estranged husband, Tommy Mottola, who also lead her current record label, Columbia.|$|E
500|$|The courts' <b>cautiously</b> <b>optimistic</b> {{acceptance}} of Pepper, which included {{an attempt to}} include it in the House of Lords' Practice Directions, soon began to wane. Although the lower courts applied the decision and allowed the use of Hansard, and the Lords itself initially followed it in R v Warwickshire County Council, ex parte Johnson, several objections and limits were expressed in later obiter dicta and ratio decidendi. The first judicial complaints were voiced in 1997 by Lord Hoffmann in The Intolerable Wrestle with Words and Meanings, where he criticised the increased expense and drop in efficiency which it created. In {{a speech to the}} Chancery Bar Lord Millett calling the judgment [...] "a regrettable decision" [...] that [...] "was not only misguided in practical terms, it was in my view contrary to principle", saying that: [...] The courts immediately began to [...] "whittle down" [...] the precedent set by Pepper. The first direct attack came through Massey v Boulden, where the Court of Appeal held that Hansard could not be used in criminal law cases, because of [...] "the principle that penal statutes are to be narrowly construed intervenes to resolve any ambiguity without resort to Hansard".|$|E
500|$|Meredith was {{partnered with}} George Livingstone for the 1903–04 campaign, {{who was able}} to supply him {{and the rest of the}} team with quality passes. Drawn against a strong Sunderland outfit in the First Round of the FA Cup, Meredith was the [...] "raider-in-chief" [...] as City claimed a 3–2 victory at Hyde Road. City then {{defeated}} Woolwich Arsenal and Middlesbrough to reach the semi-finals. There they faced The Wednesday at Goodison Park, and Meredith scored one goal (bundled in by Gillespie) and claimed two assists as City won the game 3–1. Their opponents in the final at Crystal Palace were mid-table Second Division outfit Bolton Wanderers, and Meredith was <b>cautiously</b> <b>optimistic</b> before the match, stating [...] "We ought to win... if we play anything like our normal game the cup is ours... but this is the cup final and, well, anything might happen." [...] With just over 20 minutes played, Livingstone found Meredith with a long ball, who then beat goalkeeper Dai Davies to score the only goal of the game; Bolton supporters long maintained that Meredith had been offside. As captain, Meredith was handed the trophy by Prime Minister Arthur Balfour.|$|E
500|$|James Poniewozik of Time {{took a more}} {{negative}} stance. He wrote that [...] "The Purple Piano Project" [...] "was not a particularly good episode of Glee", one which was hindered by the vast number of central characters, [...] "but it did at least suggest where the third season of the show could find its strong core stories, and also ... the numerous {{ways in which it}} could get sidetracked into tangential ridiculousness." [...] The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff graded the episode [...] "D+". He summarised it as [...] "a handful of okay performances, one or two pretty good lines, and then a whole bunch of awful". Rolling Stone Erica Futterman praised the episode's humor and plot development, but commented that it [...] "didn't hit any of the emotional notes Glee is capable of." [...] Robert Canning of IGN rated it an [...] "okay" [...] 6.5 out of 10. He too found [...] "there were still quite a few laughs to be had", but felt the episode suffered from its repetitiveness, as Sue's hatred of the glee club and New Directions' recruitment problems have been thoroughly explored before. The Dallas Morning News Samantha Urban noted that Murphy failed to deliver on his promise to increase Mercedes and Tina's roles, and couldn't accept that Sue would be allowed to promote her congressional campaign on her local news commentary spot, but overall was [...] "pretty impressed" [...] with what she called [...] "a solid episode of Glee that made [...] feel <b>cautiously</b> <b>optimistic</b> about the season ahead." [...] Lisa Respers France of CNN summed up the episode in a single word: [...] "Meh." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Miami, some Venezuelans joyfully celebrated Chavez's death, {{and were}} <b>cautiously</b> <b>optimistic</b> of new {{elections}} for Chávez's successor; an estimated 189,219 Venezuelans {{live in the}} United States, {{most of whom are}} anti-Chavez. United States President Barack Obama reaffirmed the support of the US for the Venezuelan people and its interest in developing a constructive relationship with the Venezuelan government. Former president Jimmy Carter complimented Chávez's commitment to improving the lives of Venezuelans. According to a statement posted at the Carter Center website, Carter and his wife Rosalynn [...] "came to know a man who expressed a vision to bring profound changes to his country to benefit especially those people who had felt neglected and marginalized." ...|$|E
2500|$|The British {{attempted}} {{to renew the}} advance, by attacking where the original assault had failed, instead of reinforcing success and a fresh attack with the same detailed preparation as that {{on the first day}} became necessary. A big German counter-attack by twenty infantry battalions (...) early on 12 March, was a costly failure. Sir Douglas Haig, the First Army commander, cancelled further attacks and ordered the captured ground to be consolidated, preparatory to a new attack further north. An acute shortage of artillery ammunition made another attack impossible, apart from a local effort by the 7th Division, which was another costly failure. The Germans strengthened the defences opposite the British and increased the number of troops in the area; the French became <b>cautiously</b> <b>optimistic</b> that British forces could be reliable in offensive operations.|$|E
2500|$|Transition {{left the}} economy of the European Union in a <b>cautiously</b> <b>optimistic</b> state during the early 2000s. [...] The most {{difficult}} years were 2000–2001, precipitating the worst years of the American recession. [...] The European Union introduced a new currency on January 1, 1999. [...] The euro, which was met with much anticipation, had its value immediately plummet, and it continued to be a weak currency throughout 2000 and 2001. [...] Inflation struck the Eurozone for a few months in summer 2001 but the economy deflated within months. [...] In 2002, the value of the euro began to rapidly rise (reaching parity with the US dollar on July 15, 2002). [...] This hurt business for companies based in Europe, as the profits made abroad (especially in the Americas) had an unfavorable exchange rate.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2016, the International Monetary Fund {{reported}} that it would disburse a higher amount than the US$150 million originally planned, a full US$162.6 million (SDR 119.894 million), to Sri Lanka. The agency's evaluation was <b>cautiously</b> <b>optimistic</b> about the future: [...] "While inflation has abated, credit growth remains strong. The central bank indicates its readiness to tighten the monetary policy stance further if inflationary pressures resurge or credit growth persists. The authorities intend to continue building up reserves through outright purchases while allowing for greater exchange rate flexibility. The banking sector is currently well capitalized. Steps are being taken to find a resolution mechanism for the distressed financial institutions. Going forward, {{there is a need}} to strengthen the supervisory and regulatory framework, and identify and mitigate vulnerabilities in the financial sector, particularly with regard to non-banks and state-owned banks." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2015, the Parliament of India {{passed the}} Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Amendment Act {{to address issues}} {{regarding}} implementation of the POA, including instances where the police put procedural obstacles {{in the way of}} alleged victims or indeed outright colluded with the accused. It also extended the number of acts that were deemed to be atrocities. One of those remedies, in an attempt to address the slow process of cases, was to make it mandatory for states to set up the exclusive Special Courts that the POA had delineated. Progress in doing so, however, was reported in April 2017 to be unimpressive. P. L. Punia, {{a former chairman of the}} NCSC, said that the number of pending cases was high because most of the extant Special Courts were in fact not exclusive but rather being used to process some non-POA cases, and because [...] "The special prosecutors are not bothered and the cases filed under this Act are as neglected as the victims". While Dalit rights organisations were <b>cautiously</b> <b>optimistic</b> that the amended Act would improve the situation, legal experts were pessimistic.|$|E

50|$|The first {{international}} review of their debut demo album Blood Sacrifice Shaman by German heavy metal magazine Legacy in 2011 was <b>cautiously</b> <b>optimistic</b> about the band’s potential. Later MTV did {{an interview with}} the band.|$|E
50|$|A 2007 {{review by}} the Cochrane Collaboration was <b>cautiously</b> <b>optimistic</b> about the results of sacral nerve {{stimulation}} in fecal incontinence, although it also concluded that trial periods of stimulation did not adequately identify patients that would benefit from the procedure, and that more longer-term studies were needed.|$|E
5000|$|After viewing MTV video promos for {{the second}} season of Jersey Shore, DiMino stated that he was [...] "... <b>cautiously</b> <b>optimistic</b> ..."

50|$|After {{learning}} {{that his father}} is Fat Vince, John realises that his true identity is that of Fat John, half-brother of Fat Paul. The novel ends with Fat John having lost all his money (if it ever existed), yet he is still able to laugh at himself and is <b>cautiously</b> <b>optimistic</b> about his future.|$|E
5000|$|A 2001 United Nations {{report says}} {{population}} growth is [...] "the main force driving increases in agricultural demand" [...] but [...] "most recent expert assessments are <b>cautiously</b> <b>optimistic</b> {{about the ability of}} global food production to keep up with demand for the foreseeable future (that is to say, until approximately 2030 or 2050)", assuming declining population growth rates.|$|E
5000|$|In his track-by-track {{review for}} The Sunday Times, Dan Cains wrote: [...] "Like a funeral take on Gorillaz’ [...] "Superfast Jellyfish" [...] {{sprinkled}} with cabaret-lounge piano and disco strings, this combines a soul vocal, jarring, muffled beats and a chorus {{that begins with}} the work “arrhythmia.” It’s at once utterly forlorn, <b>cautiously</b> <b>optimistic</b> and sonically warm, an Albarn trademark." ...|$|E
50|$|On May 28, 2005, the Cubs traded Hawkins to the San Francisco Giants in {{exchange}} for pitchers Jerome Williams and David Aardsma. Upon arrival in San Francisco, Hawkins was initially converted back into a set-up role, with the team <b>cautiously</b> <b>optimistic</b> about a return to form. However, Hawkins only showed brief flashes of his previous ability {{en route to a}} league-average performance for the Giants.|$|E
50|$|A two-week {{tour through}} the upper midwest {{and parts of}} New England was booked for mid-summer, and the band hit the road in a <b>cautiously</b> <b>optimistic</b> frame of mind. But the few crowded, raucous shows in Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan contrasted sharply with the {{virtually}} empty venues elsewhere in the country, and as the tour ended there was a prevailing feeling that the writing was on the wall.|$|E
50|$|Following their 7th-place {{finish the}} {{previous}} season, Boro fans were <b>cautiously</b> <b>optimistic</b> {{for the upcoming}} season. Despite losing Bolo Zenden (who left on a free to join Liverpool), the signings of Yakubu, Abel Xavier and Emanuel Pogatetz bolstered the squad and made it appear a lot stronger. These signings, along {{with the promise of}} another season in the UEFA cup promised a season to look forward to for the fans.|$|E

Randy assures Monk that indeed, Eddie Murdoch is the person who killed Stefanie Preston and Rusty - they found soot-stained clothes in his house.|$|E
50|$|Local news, editorial, {{advertising}} and design is generated mainly in-house, with additional news and feature contributions from syndicated columnists, news services and occasionally freelance writers. The editorial {{position has been}} independent; politically, its stance has changed on some issues. Following {{the signing of the}} Oslo Accords in Washington in 1993, for example, the paper remained <b>cautiously</b> <b>optimistic</b> about Mideast peace {{even in the face of}} Palestinian violence against Israel. But by 2007, it was in the camp of those who question the two-state solution.|$|E

That morning at the Willis home, Floyd, played by Palmer Williams Jr., is hilariously negative about Rose allowing Frank to work for the wealthy couple. Floyd is convinced that Louis’ much younger wife, Diane, will snatch Frank right from under Rose’s nose.|$|E
50|$|Despite the {{popularity}} of outgoing governor (and 1950 U.S. Senate candidate) Jim Duff and the low approval ratings of President Harry Truman, Democrats came into the election with a <b>cautiously</b> <b>optimistic</b> outlook. In Dilworth, they had selected a charismatic candidate with a strong reputation as a reformer after serving as {{a key figure in}} the Democratic overthrow of Philadelphia's corrupt Republican political machine. Furthermore, although Republicans held registration advantages throughout the state, many voters were ambivalent toward their policies due to a 1949-50 recession that impacted crucial heavy industries.|$|E

5000|$|Chief peace {{negotiator}} Miriam Coronel-Ferrer {{said that}} the government was <b>cautiously</b> <b>optimistic</b> for a final agreement soon following six days of talks on July 13, 2013. He said: [...] "This signing indicates that both sides are really committed to finish the peace negotiations. Nobody wants this not to reach its fruition." [...] The agreement would see government allowances for the MILF to have a 75 percent share of earnings from natural resources and metallic minerals in a proposed autonomous region. For other energy resources, earnings would be split equally in accordance with Malaysia-brokered talks.|$|E
5000|$|MICOM was {{directed}} to study {{whether or not the}} Navy's AIM-9D Sidewinder missile could be adapted for the ground-to-air role. Since the Sidewinder was guided by an infrared seeker, it would not be confused by ground clutter like the radar-guided Mauler. On the downside, the missile required some time to [...] "lock on", and the current generation seekers were only able to lock onto the tail of an aircraft. MICOM's report was <b>cautiously</b> <b>optimistic,</b> concluding that the Sidewinder could be adapted very quickly, although it would have limited capability.|$|E
