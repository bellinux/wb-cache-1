40|$|Many {{applications}} in {{wireless sensor networks}} (WSNs) require energy consumption to be minimized and the data delivered to the sink within a specific delay. A usual solution for reducing energy consumption is duty cycling, in which nodes periodically switch between sleep and active states. By increasing the duty <b>cycle</b> <b>interval,</b> consumed energy can be reduced more. However, a large duty <b>cycle</b> <b>interval</b> causes a long end-to-end (E 2 E) packet delay. As a result, the requirement of a specific delay bound for packet delivery may not be satisfied. In this paper, we aim at maximizing the duty cycle while still guaranteeing that the packets arrive at the sink with the required probability, i. e., the required delay-constrained success ratio (DCSR) is achieved. In order to meet this objective, we propose a novel scheduling and forwarding scheme, namely the deadline-aware scheduling and forwarding (DASF) algorithm. In DASF, the E 2 E delay distribution with the given network model and parameters is estimated {{in order to determine}} the maximum duty <b>cycle</b> <b>interval,</b> with which the required DCSR is satisfied. Each node independently selects a wake-up time using the selected interval, and packets are forwarded to a node in the potential forwarding set, which is determined based on the distance between nodes and the sink. DASF does not require time synchronization between nodes, and a node does not need to maintain neighboring node information in advance. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can satisfy a required delay-constrained success ratio and outperforms existing algorithms in terms of E 2 E delay and DCSR...|$|E

PURPOSE: To test the effects of a two-week high-intensity <b>cycle</b> <b>interval</b> protocol on two-mile run time trial performance. METHODS: A convenience sample of 12 college-age students volunteered for participation. Participants performed two separate two-mile running time trials and an individual Wingate session for familiarization. Next, all participants performed a two-mile run pre-test on an outdoor track. Afterward, participants were randomly divided into control and experimental groups. Participants in the experimental group completed a two-week high-intensity <b>cycle</b> <b>interval</b> protocol, which consisted of six sessions (separated by 24 -hours of rest). Each session included multiple (4 - 7) 30 -second Wingate sprints, separated by 4 -minutes of rest. The control group continued their normal physical activity during the training period. Following the training period, all participants performed a two-mile run post-test on the same outdoor track. Run time, in seconds, was recorded for data analysis. The independent variable was training condition (control vs. experimental) and the dependent variable was two-mile run time. A factorial ANOVA was used to compare differences between pre- and post-test run times and control and experimental group performances. Alpha (α) was set at p ≤ 0. 05 to determine statistical significance. RESULTS: There was a statistical difference (p= 0. 001) between and within groups. Pairwise comparison within groups (pre- vs. post-test) indicated a significant difference between two-mile run times (990. 0 ± 80. 4 s vs. 936. 4 ± 61. 7 s; p= 0. 001). In addition, a pairwise comparison between training groups (control vs. experimental) indicated a significant difference between two-mile run times (1018. 3 ± 86. 6 s vs. 908. 05 ± 55. 5 s; p= 0. 046). CONCLUSION: Participants from both groups improved running time from pre- to post-test with the exception of two participants in the control group who ran slower during the post-test. The improvement in both groups could be attributed to a learning effect from the pre-test. Despite this, the experimental group improved two-mile run time more than the control group, which suggests that short-duration, high-intensity <b>cycle</b> <b>interval</b> training can indeed improve running performance. Due to the low sample size, statistical power of the study was very low (0. 001), so future research with more participants is needed to verify these results...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{discover}} early hormonal {{predictors of}} menopause and {{the stages of}} the menopausal transition and to understand the hormonal basis behind the bleeding abnormalities common in the menopausal transition. METHODS: A cohort of 804 women aged 42 - 52 collected first void urine samples daily for one complete menstrual cycle or 50 days (whichever came first) once a year for 3 years. Urine was assayed for excreted levels of follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, estrogen metabolites, and progesterone metabolites, which were normalized for creatinine concentration. Anovulation was defined by an algorithm based on progesterone secretion. Menstrual bleeding parameters were derived from daily calendars. Correlations among bleeding characteristics, hormone concentrations, and other potential clinical predictors were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression models. RESULTS: An ethnically diverse population of women (mean age of 47) with {{a majority in the}} early perimenopause was studied. Approximately 20 % of all cycles were anovulatory. Short <b>cycle</b> <b>intervals</b> (fewer than 21 days) were common early in the menopause transition and were associated with anovulation (44 %). Long <b>cycle</b> <b>intervals</b> (more than 36 days) also were associated with anovulatory cycles (65 %). Both short (1 - 3 days) and long (more than 8 days) duration of menstrual bleeding were associated with anovulation (18 % and 23 %, respectively). Women with anovulatory cycles were less likely to report heavy menstrual bleeding as compared with those with ovulatory cycles. Heavy bleeding was not associated with steroid hormone concentrations but was associated with obesity and with the self-reported presence of leiomyomata. CONCLUSIONS: Among women in the early menopause transition, abnormalities in timing of menstrual bleeding (<b>cycle</b> <b>intervals</b> or bleeding duration) have a hormonal basis and are frequently associated with anovulation. In contrast, abnormally heavy periods do not appear to have a steroid hormonal basis and are less likely after anovulatory cycles. Heavy periods are associated with obesity and leiomyomata.

30|$|A {{significant}} part of the PQ metering process is synchronisation with the line voltage. The PQ metering standards, namely EN 61000 - 4 - 30 and EN 61000 - 4 - 7, define strict requirements in this area. In particular, all quantities should be measured within 10  cycle intervals for 50  Hz systems (for 60  Hz systems 12  cycles are required). In addition, RMS measurements for event detection and flicker reference values must be measured by means of a sliding one <b>cycle</b> <b>interval</b> that moves in half-cycle steps. Consequently, correct detection of a cycle is crucial. A typical phase locked loop (PLL) could be used for this task; however, it can be prone to voltage disturbances (e.g. harmonic distortion) or events (e.g. voltage dips). For three phase systems, the asymmetry could also affect a typical PLL system. Therefore, a robust implementation of the PLL is an important task {{in order to make a}} PQ meter operate correctly.|$|E

40|$|In recent research, it {{has been}} {{increasingly}} necessary to employ an extended wavelength metric to cover the complete hue cycle so as to research or represent data {{as a function of}} relative wavelength rather than psychological scales such as CIELAB or Munsell hue angle. This article describes such a relative wavelength metric and its derivation from complementary wavelength functions. The metric provides a useful psychophysical, wavelength-based, ratio scale for the hue cycle allowing nonspectrals to be treated in the same coherent scale as spectral hues. Several indicators, e. g., color order hue cycles, infer the (optimally efficient) spectral hues comprise about 71 % and the nonspectrals about 29 %, of the hue <b>cycle</b> <b>interval.</b> This gives a hue cycle whose relative wavelength interval is about 240 nm for illuminant D 65.

In particular, the walking strategy addresses the balance issue, including both static and dynamic balance that were triggered non-deterministically based on the robot's realtime interaction with the environment. Four parallel Subsumption Architectures (SA) and a simple Central Pattern Producer (CPP) are employed in the physical implementation of the walking strategy. An implementation framework for such a parallel Subsumption Architecture is also proposed to facilitate the reusability of the system. A Reinforcement Learning (RL) method was integrated into the CPP to allow the robot to learn the optimal walking <b>cycle</b> <b>interval</b> (OWCI), appropriate for the robot walking on various terrain conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the robot employs the proposed walking strategy and can successfully carry out its walking behaviours under various experimental terrain conditions, such as flat ground, incline, decline and uneven ground.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} {{the age at}} menarche, the prevalence of menstrual <b>cycle</b> (<b>interval)</b> disorders, and determinants in women with congenital heart disease (CHD). DESIGN: Using two CHD registries, 1802 (82 %) of the 2196 women with CHD contacted (aged 18 - 58 years) provided written informed consent. After exclusion of patients with genetic disorders known {{to be associated with}} menstrual cycle disorders, 1593 eligible patients remained. Interviews by telephone and reviews of medical records were conducted. RESULTS: Overall, the age at menarche was slightly increased in women with CHD (13. 3 vs. 13. 1 years in the general population), mainly attributable to an increased prevalence of primary amenorrhea (n = 147; 9. 2 %). Other menstrual cycle disorders were documented: secondary amenorrhea (n = 181, 11. 4 %), polymenorrhea (n = 103, 6. 5 %), oligomenorrhea (n = 90, 5. 6 %), and menorrhagia (n = 117, 6. 5 %). The occurrence of these disorders also depended on the presence of cyanotic heart disease, surgical status, the number of surgical interventions, and the severity of CHD.

40|$|Dominant {{wavelength}} is a psychophysical scale presently {{limited to}} the spectrum. It is extended into the nonspectrals to designate the hue cycle in a continuous wavelength-based scale. To omit the fading spectrum ends, the extended scale {{is based on the}} limited spectrum of optimum color stimuli (442 – 613 nm). The hue <b>cycle</b> <b>interval</b> is found by many methods in agreement, e. g., from the spacing of the ideal primaries (additive and subtractive). These were recently defined as the complementary maxima and minima of several visual functions (e. g., saturation/W, spectral sensitivity, λ discrimination, complementary efficiency). Five of these six primaries are spectral, uniformly spaced at (40 ± 4) nm intervals. Interpolating the sixth (531 c magenta) as similarly spaced between adjacent primaries (blue 447 nm and red 607 nm) gives it the dual designation 407 / 647 as both ends of the cycle, an interval equivalent to 240 nm. Nonspectral hues are numbered serially with wavelength by interpolating green–purple complementary pairs as sinusoidallike spectral pairs. Applying the extended scale to a color circle, the six primaries reveal a sextuple symmetry of (60 ± 2) °. Only these three pairs are both complements and opposites.
