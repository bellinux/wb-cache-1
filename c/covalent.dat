5|$|Because of {{the higher}} {{electronegativity}} of lithium, some of its compounds have a more <b>covalent</b> character. For example, lithium iodide (LiI) will dissolve in organic solvents, a property of most <b>covalent</b> compounds. Lithium fluoride (LiF) is the only alkali halide that is not soluble in water, and lithium hydroxide (LiOH) is the only alkali metal hydroxide that is not deliquescent.|$|E
5|$|<b>Covalent</b> bonding {{takes place}} {{when one of}} the {{constituent}} atoms loses one or more electrons, with the other atom gaining the electrons, resulting in an electron cloud that is shared by the molecule as a whole. In both ionic and <b>covalent</b> bonding the location of the ions and electrons are constrained relative to each other, thereby resulting in the bond being characteristically brittle.|$|E
5|$|EC 6, Ligases: join two {{molecules}} with <b>covalent</b> bonds.|$|E
5|$|Activity-based {{proteomics}} – {{a branch}} of proteomics that uses <b>covalent</b> enzyme inhibitors as reporters to monitor enzyme activity.|$|E
5|$|An {{irreversible}} inhibitor permanently inactivates the enzyme, {{usually by}} forming a <b>covalent</b> bond to the protein. Penicillin and aspirin are common drugs that act in this manner.|$|E
5|$|Binary {{fluorides}} of metalloids and p-block nonmetals {{are generally}} <b>covalent</b> and volatile, with varying reactivities. Period 3 and heavier nonmetals can form hypervalent fluorides.|$|E
5|$|Many <b>covalent</b> binary {{nitrides}} are known. Examples include cyanogen ((CN)2), triphosphorus pentanitride (P3N5), disulfur dinitride (S2N2), and tetrasulfur tetranitride (S4N4). The essentially <b>covalent</b> {{silicon nitride}} (Si3N4) and germanium nitride (Ge3N4) are also known: silicon nitride in particular {{would make a}} promising ceramic {{if not for the}} difficulty of working with and sintering it. In particular, the group 13 nitrides, most of which are promising semiconductors, are isoelectronic with graphite, diamond, and silicon carbide and have similar structures: their bonding changes from <b>covalent</b> to partially ionic to metallic as the group is descended. In particular, since the B–N unit is isoelectronic to C–C, and carbon is essentially intermediate in size between boron and nitrogen, much of organic chemistry finds an echo in boron–nitrogen chemistry, such as in borazine ("inorganic benzene"). Nevertheless, the analogy is not exact due to the ease of nucleophilic attack at boron due to its deficiency in electrons, which is not possible in a wholly carbon-containing ring.|$|E
5|$|Temporarily {{reacting}} {{with the}} substrate, forming a <b>covalent</b> intermediate {{to provide a}} lower energy transition state.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemistry}} of lithium shows several differences {{from that of}} the rest of the group as the small Li+ cation polarises anions and gives its compounds a more <b>covalent</b> character. Lithium and magnesium have a diagonal relationship due to their similar atomic radii, so that they show some similarities. For example, lithium forms a stable nitride, a property common among all the alkaline earth metals (magnesium's group) but unique among the alkali metals. In addition, among their respective groups, only lithium and magnesium form organometallic compounds with significant <b>covalent</b> character (e.g. LiMe and MgMe2).|$|E
5|$|Theoreticians have {{predicted}} the <b>covalent</b> radius of meitnerium to be 6 to 10pm {{larger than that}} of iridium. The atomic radius of meitnerium {{is expected to be}} around 128pm.|$|E
5|$|A {{catalytic}} triad {{refers to}} the three amino acid residues that function together at {{the centre of the}} active site of some hydrolase and transferase enzymes (e.g. proteases, amidases, esterases, acylases, lipases and β-lactamases). An Acid-Base-Nucleophile triad is a common motif for generating a nucleophilic residue for <b>covalent</b> catalysis. The residues form a charge-relay network to polarise and activate the nucleophile, which attacks the substrate, forming a <b>covalent</b> intermediate which is then hydrolysed to regenerate free enzyme and release the product. The nucleophile is most commonly a serine or cysteine amino acid, but occasionally threonine. Because enzymes fold into complex three-dimensional structures, the residues of a catalytic triad can be far from each other along the amino-acid sequence (primary structure), however, they are brought close together in the final fold.|$|E
5|$|Alkali metals form ionic {{and highly}} soluble monofluorides; these have the cubic {{arrangement}} of sodium chloride and analogous chlorides. Alkaline earth difluorides possess strong ionic bonds but are insoluble in water, {{with the exception}} of beryllium difluoride, which also exhibits some <b>covalent</b> character and has a quartz-like structure. Rare earth elements and many other metals form mostly ionic trifluorides.|$|E
5|$|Beryllium's {{chemical}} {{behavior is}} largely {{a result of its}} small atomic and ionic radii. It thus has very high ionization potentials and strong polarization while bonded to other atoms, which is why all of its compounds are <b>covalent.</b> It is more chemically similar to aluminium than its close neighbors in the periodic table due to having a similar charge-to-radius ratio.|$|E
5|$|Carbon is {{the sixth}} element, with a {{ground-state}} electron configuration of 1s22s22p2, {{of which the}} four outer electrons are valence electrons. Its first four ionisation energies, 1086.5, 2352.6, 4620.5 and 6222.7kJ/mol, are much {{higher than those of}} the heavier group 14 elements. The electronegativity of carbon is 2.5, significantly higher than the heavier group 14 elements (1.8–1.9), but close to most of the nearby nonmetals {{as well as some of}} the second- and third-row transition metals. Carbon's <b>covalent</b> radii are normally taken as 77.2pm (C–C), 66.7pm (C=C) and 60.3pm (C≡C), although these may vary depending on coordination number and what the carbon is bonded to. In general, <b>covalent</b> radius decreases with lower coordination number and higher bond order.|$|E
5|$|Carboxypeptidase cleaves peptide {{linkages}} during digestion of proteins. A coordinate <b>covalent</b> bond {{is formed}} between the terminal peptide and a C=O group attached to zinc, {{which gives the}} carbon a positive charge. This helps to create a hydrophobic pocket on the enzyme near the zinc, which attracts the non-polar part of the protein being digested.|$|E
5|$|Catalytic triads perform <b>covalent</b> {{catalysis}} using a residue as a nucleophile. The {{reactivity of}} the nucleophilic residue is increased by the functional {{groups of the}} other triad members. The nucleophile is polarised and oriented by the base, which is itself bound and stabilised by the acid.|$|E
5|$|Curium ions {{are hard}} Lewis acids and thus form most stable {{complexes}} with hard bases. The bonding is mostly ionic, {{with a small}} <b>covalent</b> component. Curium in its complexes commonly exhibits a 9-fold coordination environment, within a tricapped trigonal prismatic geometry.|$|E
5|$|Enzymes may use {{several of}} these {{mechanisms}} simultaneously. For example, proteases such as trypsin perform <b>covalent</b> catalysis using a catalytic triad, stabilise charge build-up on the transition states using an oxyanion hole, complete hydrolysis using an oriented water substrate.|$|E
5|$|If the {{electronic}} {{structure of the}} two interacting bodies {{is affected by the}} presence of one another, <b>covalent</b> interactions (non-ionic) also contribute to the overall energy of the compound formed. Ionic compounds are rarely purely ionic, i.e. held together only by electrostatic forces. The bonds between even the most electronegative/electropositive pairs such as those in caesium fluoride exhibit a small degree of covalency. Conversely, <b>covalent</b> bonds between unlike atoms often exhibit some charge separation and can be considered to have a partial ionic character. The circumstances under which a compound will have ionic or <b>covalent</b> character can typically be understood using Fajans' rules, which use only charges and the sizes of each ion. According to these rules, compounds with the most ionic character will have large positive ions with a low charge, bonded to a small negative ion with a high charge. More generally HSAB theory can be applied, whereby the compounds with the most ionic character are those consisting of hard acids and hard bases: small, highly charged ions with a high difference in electronegativities between the anion and cation. This difference in electronegativities means that the charge separation, and resulting dipole moment, is maintained even when the ions are in contact (the excess electrons on the anions are not transferred or polarized to neutralize the cations).|$|E
5|$|Most of the iodides of the pre-transition metals (groups 1, 2, and 3, {{along with}} the {{lanthanides}} and actinides in the +2 and +3 oxidation states) are mostly ionic, while nonmetals tend to form <b>covalent</b> molecular iodides, as do metals in high oxidation states from +3 and above. Ionic iodides MIn tend to have the lowest melting and boiling points among the halides MXn of the same element, because the electrostatic forces of attraction between the cations and anions are weakest for the large iodide anion. In contrast, <b>covalent</b> iodides tend to instead have the highest melting and boiling points among the halides of the same element, since iodine is the most polarisable of the halogens and, having the most electrons among them, can contribute the most to van der Waals forces. Naturally, exceptions abound in intermediate iodides where one trend {{gives way to the}} other. Similarly, solubilities in water of predominantly ionic iodides (e.g. potassium and calcium) are the greatest among ionic halides of that element, while those of <b>covalent</b> iodides (e.g. silver) are the lowest of that element. In particular, silver iodide is very insoluble in water and its formation is often used as a qualitative test for iodine.|$|E
5|$|Serine and {{cysteine}} proteases catalyse {{peptide bond}} cleavage by a two-step process. Initially, the catalytic residue {{of the active}} site triad performs a nucleophilic attack on the peptide bond of the substrate. This releases the new N-terminus and forms a <b>covalent</b> ester-bond between the enzyme and the substrate. This <b>covalent</b> complex between enzyme and substrate is called an acyl-enzyme intermediate. For standard substrates, the ester bond is hydrolysed and the new C-terminus is released to complete catalysis. However, when a serpin is cleaved by a protease, it rapidly undergoes the S to R transition before the acyl-enzyme intermediate is hydrolysed. The efficiency of inhibition depends on fact that the relative kinetic rate of the conformational change is several orders of magnitude faster than hydrolysis by the protease.|$|E
5|$|Some {{amino acids}} have special {{properties}} such as cysteine, that can form <b>covalent</b> disulfide bonds to other cysteine residues, proline that forms a cycle to the polypeptide backbone, and glycine {{that is more}} flexible than other amino acids.|$|E
5|$|Some ions are classed as amphoteric, {{being able}} to react with either an acid or a base. This is also true of some {{compounds}} with ionic character, typically oxides or hydroxides of less-electropositive metals (so the compound also has significant <b>covalent</b> character), such as zinc oxide, aluminium hydroxide, aluminium oxide and lead(II) oxide.|$|E
5|$|The +4 {{oxidation}} state dominates titanium chemistry, but compounds in the +3 {{oxidation state}} are also common. Commonly, titanium adopts an octahedral coordination geometry in its complexes, but tetrahedral TiCl4 is a notable exception. Because {{of its high}} oxidation state, titanium(IV) compounds exhibit {{a high degree of}} <b>covalent</b> bonding. Unlike most other transition metals, simple aquo Ti(IV) complexes are unknown.|$|E
5|$|The {{absorption}} band of simple cations shift toward shorter wavelength {{when they are}} involved in more <b>covalent</b> interactions. This occurs during hydration of metal ions, so colourless anhydrous ionic compounds with an anion absorbing in the infrared can become colourful in solution.|$|E
5|$|The bonding in boron {{has been}} {{described}} as being characteristic of behaviour intermediate between metals and nonmetallic <b>covalent</b> network solids (such as diamond). The energy required to transform B, C, N, Si and P from nonmetallic to metallic states has been estimated as 30, 100, 240, 33 and 50 kJ/mol, respectively. This indicates the proximity of boron to the metal-nonmetal borderline.|$|E
5|$|The {{structural}} {{chemistry of}} boron {{is dominated by}} its small atomic size, and relatively high ionization energy. With only three valence electrons per boron atom, simple <b>covalent</b> bonding cannot fulfil the octet rule. Metallic bonding is the usual result among the heavier congenors of boron but this generally requires low ionization energies. Instead, because of its small size and high ionization energies, the basic structural unit of boron (and nearly all of its allotropes) is the icosahedral B12 cluster. Of the 36 electrons associated with 12 boron atoms, 26 reside in 13 delocalized molecular orbitals; the other 10 electrons are used to form two- and three-centre <b>covalent</b> bonds between icosahedra. The same motif can be seen, as are deltahedral variants or fragments, in metal borides and hydride derivatives, and in some halides.|$|E
5|$|According {{to their}} shared {{physical}} and chemical properties, the elements can be classified into the major categories of metals, metalloids and nonmetals. Metals are generally shiny, highly conducting solids that form alloys {{with one another and}} salt-like ionic compounds with nonmetals (other than the noble gases). The majority of nonmetals are coloured or colourless insulating gases; nonmetals that form compounds with other nonmetals feature <b>covalent</b> bonding. In between metals and nonmetals are metalloids, which have intermediate or mixed properties.|$|E
5|$|Although {{these are}} not found on Earth naturally, boron forms a variety of stable {{compounds}} with formal oxidation state less than three. As for many <b>covalent</b> compounds, formal oxidation states are often of little meaning in boron hydrides and metal borides. The halides also form derivatives of B(I) and B(II). BF, isoelectronic with N2, cannot be isolated in condensed form, but B2F4 and B4Cl4 are well characterized.|$|E
5|$|At higher {{temperatures}} tellurium {{is sufficiently}} plastic to extrude. It melts at 449.51°C. Crystalline tellurium has a structure consisting of parallel infinite spiral chains. The bonding between adjacent atoms {{in a chain}} is <b>covalent,</b> but {{there is evidence of}} a weak metallic interaction between the neighbouring atoms of different chains. Tellurium is a semiconductor with an electrical conductivity of around 1.0S•cm−1 and a band gap of 0.32 to 0.38eV. Liquid tellurium is a semiconductor, with an electrical conductivity, on melting, of around 1.9 × 103S•cm−1. Superheated liquid tellurium is a metallic conductor.|$|E
5|$|Catalytic triads perform <b>covalent</b> {{catalysis}} via an acyl-enzyme intermediate. If this intermediate {{is resolved}} by water, {{the result is}} hydrolysis of the substrate. However, if the intermediate is resolved by attack by a second substrate, then the enzyme acts as a transferase. For example, attack by an acyl group results in an acyltransferase reaction. Several families of transferase enzymes have evolved from hydrolases by adaptation to exclude water and favour attack of a second substrate.|$|E
5|$|Enzyme {{kinetics}} cannot prove which {{modes of}} catalysis {{are used by}} an enzyme. However, some kinetic data can suggest possibilities to be examined by other techniques. For example, a ping–pong mechanism with burst-phase pre-steady-state kinetics would suggest <b>covalent</b> catalysis might be important in this enzyme's mechanism. Alternatively, the observation of a strong pH effect on Vmax but not Km might indicate that a residue in the active site {{needs to be in}} a particular ionisation state for catalysis to occur.|$|E
5|$|Enzymes {{that contain}} a {{catalytic}} triad {{use it for}} one of two reaction types: either to split a substrate (hydrolases) or to transfer one portion of a substrate over to a second substrate (transferases). Triads are an inter-dependent set of residues in the active site of an enzyme and act in concert with other residues (e.g. binding site and oxyanion hole) to achieve nucleophilic catalysis. These triad residues act together to make the nucleophile member highly reactive, generating a <b>covalent</b> intermediate with the substrate that is then resolved to complete catalysis.|$|E
5|$|Fluorine's first {{ionization}} energy is third-highest among all elements, behind helium and neon, which complicates {{the removal of}} electrons from neutral fluorine atoms. It also has a high electron affinity, second only to chlorine, and tends to capture an electron to become isoelectronic with the noble gas neon; it has the highest electronegativity of any element. Fluorine atoms have a small <b>covalent</b> radius of around 60picometers, {{similar to those of}} its period neighbors oxygen and neon.|$|E
5|$|Irreversible inhibitors usually covalently modify an enzyme, and {{inhibition}} {{can therefore}} not be reversed. Irreversible inhibitors often contain reactive functional {{groups such as}} nitrogen mustards, aldehydes, haloalkanes, alkenes, Michael acceptors, phenyl sulfonates, or fluorophosphonates. These electrophilic groups react with amino acid side chains to form <b>covalent</b> adducts. The residues modified are those with side chains containing nucleophiles such as hydroxyl or sulfhydryl groups; these include the amino acids serine (as in DFP, right), cysteine, threonine, or tyrosine.|$|E
5|$|It {{may not be}} {{possible}} to observe every atom in the asymmetric unit. In many cases, disorder smears the electron density map. Weakly scattering atoms such as hydrogen are routinely invisible. It is also possible for a single atom to appear multiple times in an electron density map, e.g., if a protein sidechain has multiple (<4) allowed conformations. In still other cases, the crystallographer may detect that the <b>covalent</b> structure deduced for the molecule was incorrect, or changed. For example, proteins may be cleaved or undergo post-translational modifications that were not detected prior to the crystallization.|$|E
