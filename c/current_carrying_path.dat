40|$|The {{thesis is}} focused on the {{calculation}} of electrodynamic forces that counterwork on moving contacts of compact circuit breaker BL 1600 from the company OEZ Letohrad. The thesis is divided into separates chapters that build on themselves. In the introduction the reason why we deal with calculation of dynamic forces and structural arrangement of <b>current</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>path</b> is described. In the following chapter there is a theoretical analysis of electrodynamic forces that conterwork on individual parts of circuit breaker´s element. The third part is devoted to structural arrangement of the circuit breaker BL 1600. In this part we can find an example of using the circuit broker Modeion in practice. Two next chaptures deal with adjustment of the model of <b>current</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>path</b> which then serves for the calculation of electrodynamic forces. The rest of the thesis is devoted to my own calculations. These calculations are mainly stationary where we try to find the forces that conterwork on the contacts in a steady current and in a point in time. There are also dynamics calculation when we can watch the forces that counterwork on contacts in a certain time interval. The last chapter is devoted to a stationary calculation of forces that counterwork on the electrical arc which arises while turning the short-circuit current off. The obtained results are evaluated in partial conclusions of this thesis...|$|E

40|$|Bachelor‘s {{thesis is}} {{focuses on the}} issue of {{designing}} electrical switching devices, especially dimensioning of the current-carrying paths according to the effects of electrodynamic forces. There are dimensioning requirements for <b>current</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>paths</b> of switching devices in the introductory chapter. Fundamental requirements are: sufficient dielectric strength between parts at different potential, resistance to thermal effects of electric current and current path arrangement considering electrodynamic forces. Typical current path arrangements of electrical apparatuses are justified in second chapter. Furthermore, the actual problems to solve are formulated, corresponding with the development of technical solutions. Emphasis is laid upon proper description of modifications of the proposal so to limit their negative impact of secondary phenomena such as electrodynamic forces or thermal effects. The best solutions then directly positively use these phenomena. The present progressive technical solutions retrieved in a patented state of the art using Goldfire Innovator software are described in the third chapter. The work is then focused on rotary contact arrangement patents from the very first, through the pioneering patent to the present. Hereinafter are described the features of the evolution of technology development – micro and macrosegmentation. In the last chapter, there are analytically calculated electrodynamic forces acting on the contact arm of low voltage circuit breaker in both open and closed state and medium voltage disconnector. Both technical solutions are evaluated due to given requirements...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{simulate}} the action of electrodynamic forces on <b>current</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>path</b> and a movable contact of the circuit breaker OEZ Modeion BH 630 NE. For the calculation there is used the simulation program Ansys Maxwell. The first part is devoted to theoretical analysis of electromagnetic forces on a conductor in a magnetic field. Further I discuss the constructional design of the circuit breaker itself, especially the current path and the contact mechanism. In the next part there is (with using program Autodesk Inventor) created a simplified 3 D model of the current path including an arc chamber. With program Ansys Maxwell then there is performed simulation of the acting of forces in each mode. This is magnetostatic and transient analysis for symmetrical and asymmetrical flow of the fault current. In conclusion the results obtained are evaluated and processed in the tabular way...|$|E
40|$|The {{critical}} current reduction in silver-sheathed (Bi,Pb) 2 Sr 2 Ca 2 Cu 3 O 10 superconducting tapes (Bi 2223 /Ag) is investigated when loaded with uni-axial strains {{in combination with}} a magnetic field perpendicular to the tape surface. The number {{and quality of the}} grain-to-grain connections and the alignment of the superconducting cores mainly determine the {{critical current}} in Bi 2223 /Ag tapes. It is assumed that the transport current flows simultaneously through two current carrying paths in the tape: one through the network of Josephson junctions and the other is through the well-connected grains. The model describes well the magnetic field dependence of the critical current at various strains.

40|$|International audienceThe {{self-induced}} {{magnetic field}} {{has an important}} role in thermal plasma configurations generated by electric arcs as it generates velocity through Lorentz forces. In the models a good representation of the magnetic field is thus necessary. Several approaches exist to calculate the self-induced magnetic field such as the Maxwell - Ampere formulation, the vector potential approach combined with different kinds of boundary conditions or the Biot & Savart formulation. The calculation of the self-induced magnetic field is alone a difficult problem and only few articles of the thermal plasma community speak on this subject. In the present study different approaches with different boundary conditions are applied on two geometries to compare the methods and their limitations. The calculation time {{is also one of the}} criteria for the choice of the method and a compromise must be found between method precision and computation time. The study shows the importance of the <b>current</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>path</b> representation in the electrode on the deduced magnetic field. The best compromise consists of using the Biot & Savart formulation on the walls and/or edges of the calculation domain to determine the boundary conditions and to solve the vector potential in a 2 D system. This approach provides results identical to those obtained using the Biot & Savart formulation over the entire domain but with a considerable decrease of calculation time...|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} effect of system {{reservoir}} coupling strength on the current flowing through quantum junctions. We consider two simple double quantum dot configurations coupled to two external fermionic reservoirs and calculate the net current flowing between the two reservoirs. The net current is partitioned into <b>currents</b> <b>carried</b> by the eigenstates {{of the system and}} by the coherences induced between the states due to coupling with the leads. We find that <b>current</b> <b>carried</b> by populations is always positive whereas <b>current</b> <b>carried</b> by coherences may be negative. This results in a non-monotonic dependence of the net current on the coupling strength. We find that in certain cases, the net current can vanish at large couplings due to cancellation between <b>currents</b> <b>carried</b> by the states and the coherences. These results provide new insights into the non-trivial role of system-reservoir couplings on electron transport through quantum dot junctions. Comment: 5 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

40|$|All {{electrical}} equipments generate {{heat through}} I 2 R loss within a specified volume resulting in temperature rise. The regulating bodies define {{the temperature rise}} limits for all equipments for safe operation. So during the design phase of any electrical equipment thermal analysis is mandatory to predict the temperature rise. The objective is to develop an analytical tool based on thermal networking method by exploiting the similarity between thermal and electrical analogy to calculate steady state temperatures in less time along <b>current</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>path</b> in electrical equipments. As a later part, the tool developed is used to predict change in temperatures for change in geometry of the components in the electrical equipment. The problem is considered as two parts. As first part, an Excel tool is developed with Visual Basic backend, based on thermal networking method to calculate steady state temperatures in electrical equipments. Here the numerical method used is Elementary Balance Method, in which every element is represented by a node and relevant energy balance equations are formulated for it. Temperatures are calculated using the Excel tool for frame 1 and 3. Test (Thermal Run) is conducted on AKD- 12 switch gear (frame 1 and frame 3) under continuous current to find out temperatures. Analytical results from the tool are then validated against the test data. As second part, dimensions of components in the switch gear are varied and variation in temperatures of components, particularly at moving contact (highest temperature point) with respect to original temperatures is observed. Good matching is observed in temperature profile between analytical and experimental results. The maximum percentage error is 15 %. By analyzing the results, {{it can be concluded}} that thermal network theory helps engineers to predict temperatures easily for changes in design reducing design cycle time and it is flexible as to expand its application to any heat generating equipment...|$|E
