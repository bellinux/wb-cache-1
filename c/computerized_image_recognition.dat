40|$|Retinal {{pathology}} is {{a common}} cause of an irreversible decrease of central vision commonly found amongst senior population.  Detection of the earliest signs of retinal diseases can be facilitated by viewing retinal images available from the telemedicine networks.  To facilitate the process of retinal images, screening software applications based on image recognition technology are currently on the various stages of development. Purpose: To develop and implement <b>computerized</b> <b>image</b> <b>recognition</b> software {{that can be used}} as a decision support technology for retinal image screening for various types of retinopathies. Methods: The software application for the retina image recognition has been developed using C++ language. It was tested on dataset of 70 images with various types of pathological features (age related macular degeneration, chorioretinitis, central serous chorioretinopathy and diabetic retinopathy). Results: It was shown that the system can achieve a sensitivity of 73 % and specificity of 72 %. Conclusion: Automated detection of macular lesions using proposed software can significantly reduce manual grading workflow. In addition, automated detection of retinal lesions can be implemented as a clinical decision support system for telemedicine screening. It is anticipated that further development of this technology can become a part of diagnostic image analysis system for the electronic health records. </p...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} clarify the {{correlation}} between the interpretation by observers and the computerized detection of pulmonary nodules, both an interpreting experiment and a computerized image analysis of conventional chest radiographs of 192 cases, each of which contained a pathologically proven tumor nodule, were performed. Two kinds of directional contrast filters (DCFs) were developed for this study, one for detecting nodular densities, DCF(N), and the other for detecting linear or vascular densities, DCF(V). Three major groups of candidates detected by DCF(N) were tumor nodules (181 areas), overlapping blood vessels (1045 areas), and overlapping ribs (730 areas). The mean values and gradients of DCF(N) output of nodule candidates were significantly different from those of blood vessel candidates and rib candidates. As for the nodules, computerized detection was considered as confirmed if included in the first to the twentieth ranked candidates, as in 170 (88. 5 %) of the 192 cases. Significant correlation was seen between the rank of the candidates and the DCF(N) -detected area, and between the rank of the candidates and the mean value of DCF(N) output of the central portion of the candidates. Factors affecting the detectability of pulmonary nodules in the experiment of observer interpretation of chest radiographs were the area, density, vascular convergence of nodules, and the degree of overlay of nodules with posterior ribs. These results were also recognized by the data of computerized image analysis. These findings suggest that the <b>computerized</b> <b>image</b> <b>recognition</b> of chest radiographs with DCF(N) and DCF(V) finds some of the characteristic features of lung nodules and might have a {{role in the development of}} a computerized support system for detecting pulmonary nodules in chest radiographs...|$|E

To facilitate various user requirements, we ported our <b>image</b> <b>recognition</b> software to different platforms including Linux, Windows, iOS and Android. Therefore the <b>image</b> <b>recognition</b> engine can run on either smartphones or server computers. If it runs on the smartphone, the app does not need to send the query image to the server.

In both cases, the app will retrieve and display the corresponding contents after obtaining the recognition result. As mentioned in 2.1, the <b>image</b> <b>recognition</b> engine can be configured to run on the smartphone or the server, depending on whether Internet connection is available, and the number of images to be recognized. If Internet connection is not available, the <b>image</b> <b>recognition</b> will be performed on the smartphone.
