25|$|Mike Smith {{was kept}} as captain {{for only the}} First Test of the 1966 series against a West Indian side held {{together}} by the superb all round skills of their captain Gary Sobers. Sobers won the toss at Old Trafford, batted first and caught England on a spinning wicket for an innings victory, Cowdrey making 69 in the debacle. Smith was dismissed as captain and dropped from the side due to his well-known weakness to the West Indian fast bowlers. Cowdrey was placed in charge, which he accepted reluctantly due to the shoddy treatment of his friend and predecessor. In the Second Test at Lords England were 86 runs ahead in the first innings with the West Indies 95/5 when Sobers and his cousin David Holford added 274 to save the game. Cowdrey was criticised for not surrounding Sobers with fielders {{at the beginning of}} his innings, but he maintained that by spreading the field he encouraged him to make the strokes which <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> him out, but there was little doubt that the plan failed.|$|E

500|$|Answering to the {{nickname}} of [...] "Puddin'", Ponsford was a thickset man, weighing in at around [...] during his playing career. Despite this, {{he was known}} for his quick footwork, and was regarded as an excellent player of spin bowling. Ponsford was noted for his ability to maintain intense levels of concentration for extended periods. He possessed a strong cut shot and he drove through mid off powerfully, although critics noted that his backlift was not completely straight. He had a tendency to shuffle too far to the off; this exposed his leg stump and he was bowled behind his legs on six occasions in Tests against England. However, Ray Robinson felt that [...] "no bowler <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> a marble, much less a [...] ball between his bat and his left leg." ...|$|E

500|$|The critic {{writing for}} The Times thought that Bond was [...] "backed up by sound writing" [...] by Fleming. Although the plot was grandiose, the critic noted that: [...] "it sounds – and is – fantastic; {{the skill of}} Mr. Fleming is to be {{measured}} {{by the fact that}} it is made not to seem so." [...] For The Times Literary Supplement, Michael Robson considered that [...] "a new Bond has emerged from these pages: an agent more relaxed, less promiscuous, less stagily muscular than of yore." [...] Bond was not the only thing that was more relaxed, according to Robson, as [...] "the story, too, is more relaxed." [...] Robson saw this as a positive development, but it did mean that although [...] "there are incidental displays of the virtuosity to which Mr. Fleming has accustomed us, ...the narrative does not slip into top gear until Goldfinger unfolds his plan". The Evening Standard looked at why Bond was a success and listed [...] "the things that make Bond attractive: the sex, the sadism, the vulgarity of money for its own sake, the cult of power, the lack of standards". The Sunday Times called Goldfinger [...] "Guilt-edged Bond", whilst the Manchester Evening News thought that [...] "Only Fleming <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> away with it...outrageously improbable, wickedly funny, wildly exciting".|$|E
500|$|According to AllMusic, {{the album}} is mostly {{influenced}} by dance-pop, post-disco and pop rock music. The overall sound of Madonna is dissonant, {{and is in the}} form of upbeat synthetic disco, utilizing some of the new technology of the time, like the usage of Linn drum machine, Moog bass and the [...] This equipment has dated since, consequently the sound of the album comes off as somewhat harsh. Madonna commented on her debut album: [...] "The songs were pretty weak and I went to England during the recordings so I wasn't around... I wasn't in control. [...] I didn't realize how crucial it was for me to break out of the disco mold before I'd already finished the [...] album. I wish I <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> a little more variety there." [...] The album starts with the song [...] "Lucky Star", a medium-paced dance track, beginning with a sparkle of synth note and is followed by heavy beats of electronic drum and handclaps. A guitar is played in high riff and a bubbling bass synth is produced to accompany the guitar sound. The song revolves around the [...] "Starlight, starbright" [...] hook for more than a minute, before going to the chorus. According to author Rikky Rooksby, the lyrics are repetitive and inane, revolving around the transparent ambiguity of the stars, and juxtaposition of the male character with being a heavenly body in the sky.|$|E

2500|$|By 1932, Constantine had {{followed}} his relations into the Trinidad cricket team. He made his first-class debut against Barbados on 16 January in the Inter-Colonial Tournament, and scored 30 in his only innings. He later bowled 11 wicketless overs {{in a comfortable}} Trinidad win. According to his obituary in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, [...] "he was so quick in the field that his team-mates reputedly congratulated him when he dropped a catch on his Trinidad debut, {{because no one else}} <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> close."

2500|$|Although Columbia Records {{intended}} to release [...] "Work" [...] as Ms. Kelly’s lead {{single in the}} beginning, Polow da Don-produced [...] "Like This" [...] eventually replaced the original album's lead single [...] "Gotsta Go" [...] in early 2007, as Rowland thought the song had no hit potential, influenced by negative blogs she read after snippets of [...] "Work" [...] had leaked.

2500|$|O'Neal {{announced}} his retirement via social media on June 1, 2011. Two days later, O'Neal {{held a press conference}} at his home in Orlando to officially announce his retirement. When asked who was the greatest player he ever played with during his career, O'Neal did not answer but Bryant was the only player whose name was mentioned. He also mentioned that his departure from Los Angeles {{has nothing to do with}} Kobe Bryant, saying [...] "the reason I left wasn't about what Kobe did; it was about something else. I was making maximum dollars and felt I deserved more. It was a business end."

When I first heard of Hitler, when Ribbentrop came to see me, I thought they were all crazy. I think I brought Ramsay and Simon to meet Ribbentrop. Remember that Ramsay's health was breaking up in the last two years. He had lost his nerve in the House in the last year. I had to take all the important speeches.

No power on earth <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> rearmament without a general election except by a big split. Simon was inefficient.

2500|$|Various {{scientists}} have formed their own theories {{to explain how}} the [...] "20th century manufactured" [...] anatase in the Vinland Map ink <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> into genuine medieval ink. The first was chemist Jacqueline Olin, then a researcher with the Smithsonian Institution, who in the 1970s conducted experiments which produced anatase at an early stage of a medieval iron-gall ink production process. Examination of her anatase by a colleague, mineralogist Dr Kenneth Towe, showed that it was very different from the neat, rounded crystals found in the Vinland Map and modern pigments. Towe himself, a clay specialist, briefly considered the possibility that the anatase could have come from clay, where it is present in trace amounts, but on checking McCrone's data found no significant traces of clay minerals. Shortly before the Raman analysis was published, historian Douglas McNaughton based a mistaken theory about the ink around McCrone's emphasis on the chromium-rich black particle, having obtained unpublished data on the similar particles in Möller's report.|$|E
2500|$|Sørensen {{was dropped}} by his three companions not long after, while [...] rider Nairo Quintana tried to {{attack from the}} peloton, but was brought back due to his close nature to both Martin and Rodríguez in the general classification. The lead group swelled to five riders several {{kilometres}} later, as Michele Scarponi of the [...] team– fifth in the general classification overnight– and 's Robert Kišerlovski bridged across a 20-second gap to reach the leaders. Martin's team-mates took station {{on the front of}} the peloton, in order to negate any potential gains that Scarponi <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> off the front. Ultimately, Scarponi failed to achieve enough seconds to take the overall victory, but the group of four riders (minus Wellens, who had been dropped) remained clear to the end, where De Gendt beat out López for the stage victory, taking both his– and his team's– first win of 2013. The bunch came across the line 21 seconds later, with Martin positioned in the group to become the first Irish winner of the race in 27 years. Scarponi's advantage enabled him to move up two places into third overall, passing Quintana and 's Bradley Wiggins.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2015, Virginia Roberts made {{allegations}} of sexual impropriety against the Duke in court papers related to a civil action in Florida arising from the Epstein affair, but to which the Duke was not a party. Roberts claimed that the Duke was among men, including [...] "a former prime minister" [...] and Alan Dershowitz, who {{had sex with her}} while she was a teenager. She alleged she was first introduced to and, for £10,000, had sex with the Duke on a trip to London in 2001, when she was 17 (which is above the age of consent in the United Kingdom), and again in New York (where the age of consent is 17). Flight logs show the Duke and Virginia Roberts were in the same places when she alleges sex happened. The Duke and Roberts were also photographed together with the Duke's arm round Roberts' waist. Roberts said she was pressured to have sex with the Duke and [...] "wouldn't have dared object" [...] and feared leaving, as she felt Epstein, through contacts, <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> her [...] "killed or abducted". The allegations have, as of early 2015, not been tested in any court, but Roberts repeated allegations against the Duke and against Epstein in a sworn legal statement under penalty of perjury.|$|E
