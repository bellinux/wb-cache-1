50|$|Dr. Locsin’s work is {{obviously}} {{guided by the}} question asked by thoughtful nurses everywhere: How can I satisfactorily reconcile the idea of competent use of technology {{with the idea of}} <b>caring</b> <b>in</b> nursing? His theory significantly describes a practical understanding of the solution enriching the practice value of all of the general theories of nursing which are grounded <b>in</b> <b>caring.</b> Technological competency as <b>caring</b> <b>in</b> nursing informs nursing as a critical process of knowing persons’ wholeness. Dr. Locsin’s theory book explores, clarifies, and advances the conception of technological competency as <b>caring</b> <b>in</b> nursing. His theory is essential to modeling a practice of nursing from the perspective of caring. It is a practical illumination of excellent nursing in a technological world.|$|R

5|$|Continuous Care is {{a service}} {{provided}} in the patient's home. It is for patients who are experiencing severe symptoms and need temporary extra support. Once a patient is on continuous care, the hospice provides services in the home a minimum of eight hours a day.

This study describes the views of nurse managers and nurses regarding <b>caring</b> <b>in</b> the workplace. Human competence, recovery and healing are central to caring. To ensure caring and healing of patients in health services it is of the utmost importance for nurse managers to ensure a healthy and <b>caring</b> environment <b>in</b> the management of nurses.

It is clear that to become a caring person, one must be treated <b>in</b> a <b>caring</b> way and that caring may be impaired or reinforced by the environment. The environment of interest to this study was the environment in which nurses practise. A descriptive survey with a convenience sampling explored <b>caring</b> <b>in</b> the workplace of nurses.

Section A comprised demographic information and in section B the questionnaire consisted of Likert type questions, open-ended questions and yes/no questions.

40|$|Children {{entering}} care {{have not}} had the same chance as other children to grow and thrive. Parental maltreatment and other disadvantages mean that their life outcomes are often poor compared to children generally. Anglicare Victoria’s Children <b>in</b> <b>Care</b> Report Card shows the ‘gap’ between children <b>in</b> <b>care</b> and all children. Information on 142 children <b>in</b> <b>care</b> was collected from case records and compared to population data. The results for physical activity, obesity and healthy lifestyle were positive. However, a much higher proportion of children <b>in</b> <b>care</b> had emotional and behavioural problems and chronic health conditions compared to children who were not <b>in</b> <b>care.</b> Education participation rates of children <b>in</b> <b>care</b> were similar to children in the community. However, children <b>in</b> <b>care</b> were less engaged in education and less likely to be reaching their learning potential. Older teenagers <b>in</b> <b>care</b> also had limited independent living skills and lacked access to important identity documents. Too many children <b>in</b> <b>care</b> were disconnected from birth fathers and peers. Children <b>in</b> <b>care</b> also had fewer opportunities than children who were not <b>in</b> <b>care</b> to participate <b>in</b> activities that would help them build community networks.
