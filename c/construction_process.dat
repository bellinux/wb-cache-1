5|$|Preussen and Friedrich der Grosse, {{which were}} {{laid down in}} 1870 and 1869, respectively, were {{completed}} {{much more quickly than}} Grosser Kurfürst. Preussen was launched on 22 November 1873, while Friedrich der Grosse was launched on 20 September 1874. The former was completed by July 1876 and commissioned into the fleet on 4 July, and the latter joined the fleet 22 November 1877. Preussens <b>construction</b> <b>process,</b> six years long, was much shorter than either of her sisters; Friedrich der Grosse required eight years to complete, while work Grosser Kurfürst lasted for a decade. The delays associated with redesigning Grosser Kurfürst contributed to the significantly longer <b>construction</b> <b>process,</b> though this was compounded by the shipbuilders assigned to each ship. Grosser Kurfürst and Friedrich der Grosse were built by recently created Imperial shipyards, while Preussen was built by an established dockyard.|$|E
5|$|An {{elaborate}} {{series of}} foundation rituals preceded construction. A further set of rituals followed the temple's completion, dedicating {{it to its}} patron god. These rites were conducted, at least in theory, by the king {{as part of his}} religious duties; indeed, in Egyptian belief all temple construction was symbolically his work. In reality, it was the work of hundreds of his subjects, conscripted in the corvée system. The <b>construction</b> <b>process</b> for a new temple, or a major addition to an existing one, could last years or decades.|$|E
40|$|The {{construction}} industry’s {{growth and}} the adoption of newer means, methods, and materials of construction have resulted {{in an increase in}} complexity of on-site <b>construction</b> <b>processes.</b> Consequently, the <b>construction</b> industry’s need for advanced tools and techniques to study, plan, and manage these complex <b>construction</b> <b>processes</b> has developed. This paper illustrates a Petri Net based hierarchical and modular modeling and analysis technique {{that can be used for}} simulation of complex <b>construction</b> <b>processes.</b> Through the use of hierarchy, modularity, and resource modeling, Petri Nets provide clear advantages in the modeling of complex <b>construction</b> <b>processes.</b> This paper highlights the advanced features of Petri Nets and their utilization in the modeling and analysis of a structural steel erection process...|$|R

5|$|Supporters of {{the project}} {{suggested}} that the cheap electricity provided by the dam would be a strong enticement for electricity-intensive industries, such as aluminum smelting, to move to Alaska. They were encouraged by a 1962 economic feasibility study by the Development and Resources Corporation, which stated that the electricity generated would attract aluminum, magnesium and titanium industries to the region and help process locally produced minerals. The report also stated that the dam would attract a wood pulp mill on at least a temporary basis to process {{the hundreds of millions}} of board feet of timber that would otherwise be lost as the dam's reservoir flooded. The authors of the DRC report were specific enough to predict that 19,746 jobs would be created by the dam's construction—not including jobs opened during the <b>construction</b> <b>process.</b> Both the 1962 study, and another report by University of Michigan researcher Michael Brewer in 1966, stated that tens of thousands of jobs would be created by the <b>construction</b> <b>process</b> alone, even if the cheap electricity generated by the dam failed to attract any additional industries to Alaska.|$|E

5|$|The immensely {{complex and}} ambitious F-111 design and <b>construction</b> <b>process</b> forced the Australian {{government}} to quickly adopt sophisticated American procurement and project management methods. Although Australia originally planned {{to buy the}} American F-111A design, RAAF liaison officers requested country-specific changes such as a long-distance radio, Aeronautical Research Laboratories in Melbourne participated in an intake redesign and provided metal fatigue expertise, and an Australian test pilot evaluated the Australian version's longer wings and performance in tropical conditions. The differences from the F-111A caused it to be designated the F-111C in 1966.|$|E
5|$|The {{originally}} intended 12-pounder guns were exchanged for sixteen 4-in (102mm) QF Mk III guns {{early in the}} <b>construction</b> <b>process.</b> They were positioned in the superstructure and on turret roofs in open mounts as they were {{not expected to be}} manned in a ship-to-ship engagement during daylight. During 1914–15 the turret roof guns were transferred to the superstructure and the total number of guns was reduced to twelve. All of the remaining guns were enclosed in casemates and given blast shields at that time to better protect the gun crews from weather and enemy action.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a Croatian educational experience {{about the possibility}} of implementing a combination of the famous method of “work study” and the most modern simulation software to improve construction production. For the first time the students observed the capital technological <b>construction</b> <b>processes</b> “on site” and then measured the necessary time for their execution by the well known “chronometric” method. During the second exercise they analyzed the real observed processes and the sample of collected data. After that, they made a “graphic-simulation” model using the best-known software “Stroboscope” for simulating “just” the <b>construction</b> technological <b>processes.</b> At the end of their training exercise, the students concluded about the possibilities of improving technological <b>construction</b> <b>processes</b> on a “real site”. The main goal of this paper was to describe the “real process” of real education for some regular Croatian students. The simulation of <b>construction</b> <b>processes,</b> with real collection of data, may train the students about what to do in real situations. Of course, this paper presents only the general approach without greater detail...|$|R

5|$|The {{subway station}} at Porter is, at 105 feet below ground level, the deepest in the MBTA system.

The longest single span of the escalators is 143feet, the longest in the MBTA system. In 2005, a man was killed when his sweatshirt tangled {{in the bottom of the}} escalator.|$|E
5|$|In 1955 Pei's group took a {{step toward}} {{institutional}} independence from Webb and Knapp by establishing a new firm called I.M. Pei & Associates. (The name changed later to I.M.

The new firm distinguished itself through the use of detailed architectural models. They took on the Kips Bay residential area {{on the east side of}} Manhattan, where Pei set up Kips Bay Towers, two large long towers of apartments with recessed windows (to provide shade and privacy) in a neat grid, adorned with rows of trees. Pei involved himself in the <b>construction</b> <b>process</b> at Kips Bay, even inspecting the bags of concrete to check for consistency of color.|$|E
5|$|In March 2005, the <b>{{construction}}</b> <b>process</b> {{began with}} {{the sinking of the}} first caisson for the tower into the bedrock. In April, construction began on the foundation below the Chicago River. In July 2005, water from the river began seeping into the building site, through crevices in a corner where the foundation wall meets the Wabash Avenue Bridge. Divers discovered that the leak could not be sealed from the water side. After several other failed attempts to correct the problem, they drove a steel plate next to the gap and filled the space between with concrete after digging it out.|$|E

5|$|To {{prevent a}} Confederate force from {{advancing}} on Washington along the Potomac, several forts were constructed on hills near the river. To guard River Road, {{which was the}} most direct route into the city, U.S. Army engineers built a small, round fort {{at the point where}} River Road crossed into the district of Columbia. With a perimeter of only 123 yards and mounting only six guns, it was located forward of Fort Reno, the largest fort protecting the Tenleytown area. Details of the actual <b>construction</b> <b>process</b> are scarce, though a letter from a member of the Ninth New York Heavy Artillery regiment to the Democratic Press newspaper indicates that the fort was at least partially built with labor from that regiment.|$|E
5|$|By March 2004 {{the cost}} {{had reached the}} sum of £430m (compared to an {{original}} budget of £55m in July 1998 when the architects were appointed). This equates to £85 {{for each of the}} 5.1 million people in Scotland. A report published by the Auditor General for Scotland in July 2004 specifically identified elements that contributed to both increasing costs and the delay in completing the project. His report criticised the overall management of the project and stated that had the management and <b>construction</b> <b>process</b> been executed better, costs could have been reduced. The report attempted to identify the reasons why there had been an acceleration in cost from £195m in September 2000 to £431m in February 2004 and concluded that over 2000 design changes to the project were a major factor. The building was finally certified for occupation in the Summer of 2004, with the official opening in October of the same year, three years behind schedule.|$|E
5|$|Coalhouse Fort is an {{artillery}} fort {{built in the}} 1860s to guard the lower Thames from seaborne attack. It stands at Coalhouse Point in Essex on the north bank of the river, at a location near East Tilbury that was vulnerable to raiders and invaders. It was the last {{in a series of}} fortifications dating back to the 15th century and was the direct successor to a smaller mid-19th century fort built on the same site. Constructed during a period of tension with France, its location on marshy ground caused problems from the start and led to a lengthy <b>construction</b> <b>process.</b> The fort was equipped with a variety of large-calibre artillery guns and the most modern defensive facilities at the time, including shell-proof casemates protected by granite facing and cast-iron shields. However, its lengthy construction and the rapid pace of artillery development at the time meant that it was virtually obsolete for its original purpose within a few years of its completion.|$|E

5|$|During {{his tenure}} as a civil engineer, Lemoine wrote a {{treatise}} concerning compass and straightedge constructions entitled, La Géométrographie ou l'art des constructions géométriques, which he considered his greatest work, {{despite the fact that}} it was not well-received critically. The original title was De la mesure de la simplicité dans les sciences mathématiques, and the original idea for the text would have discussed the concepts Lemoine devised as concerning the entirety of mathematics. Time constraints, however, limited the scope of the paper. Instead of the original idea, Lemoine proposed a simplification of the <b>construction</b> <b>process</b> to a number of basic operations with the compass and straightedge. He presented this paper at a meeting of the Association Française in Oran, Algeria in 1888. The paper, however, did not garner much enthusiasm or interest among the mathematicians gathered there. Lemoine published several other papers on his construction system that same year, including Sur la mesure de la simplicité dans les constructions géométriques in the Comptes rendus of the Académie française. He published additional papers on the subject in Mathesis (1888), Journal des mathématiques élémentaires (1889), Nouvelles annales de mathématiques (1892), and the self-published La Géométrographie ou l'art des constructions géométriques, which was presented at the meeting of the Association Française in Pau (1892), and again at Besançon (1893) and Caen (1894).|$|E
5|$|Taiko {{construction}} has several stages, including making and shaping of the drum body (or shell), preparing the drum skin, and tuning {{the skin to}} the drumhead. Variations in the <b>construction</b> <b>process</b> often occur in the latter two parts of this process. Historically, byō-uchi-daiko were crafted from trunks of the Japanese zelkova tree that were dried out over years, using techniques to prevent splitting. A master carpenter then carved out the rough shape of the drum body with a chisel; {{the texture of the}} wood after carving softened the tone of the drum. In contemporary times, taiko are carved out on a large lathe using wood staves or logs that can be shaped to fit drum bodies of various sizes. Drumheads can be left to air-dry over a period of years, but some companies use large, smoke-filled warehouses to hasten the drying process. After drying is complete, the inside of the drum is worked with a deep-grooved chisel and sanded. Lastly, handles are placed onto the drum. These are used to carry smaller drums and they serve an ornamental purpose for larger drums.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} {{portion of}} SR 125 {{would be built}} in stages, {{at the same time}} as the portion south of SR 94. The reconstruction of the interchange with I-8 was completed in April 1993. The <b>construction</b> <b>process</b> began in April 1996, at a cost of $177 million in sales tax revenue. The first phase of the construction of the eastern portion of the SR 54 freeway corresponded with the construction of SR 125 north of Jamacha Boulevard to SR 94; construction began in 1996 at a cost of $313.5 million, using money from sales tax revenue. The plans were to exclude the controversial ramps at Troy and Palm streets. After weather-related construction delays due to the El Niño season of the winter of 1997–1998, as well as a contractor declaring bankruptcy, the extension of SR52 between Mission Gorge Road and SR125 was dedicated on May9, 1998, as well as SR 125 from Mission Gorge Road to Grossmont College Drive.|$|E

40|$|The paper evaluates a {{neural network}} {{approach}} to modelling {{the dynamics of}} <b>construction</b> <b>processes</b> that exhibit both discrete and stochastic behaviour, providing {{an alternative to the}} more conventional method of discrete-event simulation. The incentive for developing the technique is its potential for (i) facilitating model development in situations where there is limited theory describing the dependence between component processes, and (ii) rapid execution of a simulation through parallel processing. The alternative ways in which neural networks can be used to model <b>construction</b> <b>processes</b> are reviewed and their relative merits are identified. The most promising approach, a recursive method of dynamic modelling, is examined in a series of experiments. These involve the application of the technique to two classes of earthmoving system, the first comprising a push-dozer and a fleet of scrapers, and the second a loader and fleet of haul trucks. The viability of the neural network approach is demonstrated in terms of its ability to model the discrete and stochastic behaviour of these classes of <b>construction</b> <b>processes.</b> The paper concludes with an indication of some areas for further development of the technique. ...|$|R
