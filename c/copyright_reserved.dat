40|$|We characterise the {{relationships}} between preliminary and subsequent measurements for 16 commonly-used UK macroeconomic indicators drawn from two existing real-time data sets and a new nominal variable database. Most preliminary measurements are biased predictors of subsequent measurements, with some revision series affected by multiple structural breaks. To illustrate how these findings facilitate real-time forecasting, we use a vector autoregresion to generate real-time one step ahead probability event forecasts for 1990 Q 1 to 1999 Q 2. Ignoring the predictability in initial measurements understates considerably the probability of above trend output growth. <b>Copyright</b> <b>Reserve</b> Bank of New Zealand 2006 [...] ...|$|R

40|$|We study a {{generalization}} of Serre [...] Tate theory of ordinary abelian varieties and their deformation spaces. This generalization deals with abelian varieties equipped with additional structures. The additional structures can {{be not only}} an action of a semisimple algebra and a polarization, but more generally the data given by some "crystalline Hodge cycles" (a p-adic version of a Hodge cycle {{in the sense of}} motives). Compared to Serre [...] Tate ordinary theory, new phenomena appear in this generalized context. We give an application of this theory to the existence of "good" integral models of those Shimura varieties whose adjoints are products of simple, adjoint Shimura varieties of D_l^ H type with l> 4.

40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of West Nile Virus (WNV) in the New York City of USA in 1999, {{it has become a}} global public health concern. The outbreak of WNV has been reported {{in various parts of the}} world. The global spread of WNV has indicated that WNV is a re– emerging pathogen. Evidence of WNV infection in India is reported by sero–prevalence in 1952 and subsequently by virus isolation from mosquito, bat and man. Most of the WNV isolates from India belong to Lineage 5, while occasional isolates belonging to lineage 1 a have also been reported, which are shown to be more virulent than those of lineage 5 isolates. WNV usually causes mild febrile illness but sometime neuro–invasive disorder has been reported. Currently, there is no licensed vaccine for human beings, although a number of veterinary vaccines have been licensed for horses. The information about prevalence of WNV among animal population in India is scanty. This review attempts to compile and analyze the information on WNV epidemiology, diagnosis and phylogeny from Indian perspective.
