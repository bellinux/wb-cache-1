Lipton about animal rights, and Lipton (who Oscar {{suspects}} is gay) gives Oscar his private <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> <b>number,</b> asking Oscar {{to call him}} in the evening to discuss issues further. Oscar tells Pam (Jenna Fischer) and Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) that the Senator was hitting on him. Jim says Lipton was likely just schmoozing a voter, talks to Lipton himself, and also gets his number. Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) later gets Lipton's number as well, resulting in Oscar thinking that the senator {{may not have been}} hitting on him. When Oscar is leaving, Lipton shakes his hand and caresses Oscar's arm for long enough that Oscar once again believes Lipton was pursuing him.|$|E

However, opposition led by leading consumer-protection organization Consumers Union presented several privacy concerns in their congressional testimony.

Allocation of new GSM <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> <b>numbers</b> within a geographic zone is very rare now because law requires all incoming calls to be free, including incoming calls to a <b>cell</b> <b>phone.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract We {{conducted}} a dual frame survey of landline and <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> <b>numbers</b> in 2004 {{to evaluate the}} feasibility of including <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> <b>numbers</b> in random digit dial telephone surveys in the United States. By sampling <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> <b>numbers,</b> the coverage bias associated with house-holds that have only <b>cell</b> <b>phones</b> is eliminated. However, we discovered two major sources of nonresponse bias in the dual frame sample. In an attempt to reduce these biases, we applied several different estimation schemes. But a comparison to the 2004 Current Population Survey <b>Cell</b> <b>Phone</b> Supplement showed {{that none of the}} estimation schemes substan-tially reduced the nonresponse bias of the estimates. We suggest other methods that might be used in future surveys that include <b>cell</b> <b>phones</b> and discuss the need for additional data collection and research on this issue...|$|R
2500|$|Stack {{has been}} noted to employ various methods to make himself {{available}} to Union City citizens, such as widely publicizing his <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> <b>number.</b> Since 2000, Stack has spent a few dates each quarter away from City Hall in a [...] "mobile office" [...] tent that is set up at various locations in Union City in order {{for people who do}} not have easy access to City Hall to see him. According to Stack, whereas he sees approximately 350 to 400 people a week at City Hall, his mobile office attracts upwards of 300 people a day. Stack, who employs a translator to communicate with Spanish-only speakers, is frequently asked by citizens for assistance in matters such as housing and employment. In July 2010, Stack increased his mobile office appearances to a monthly basis. Among the activities sponsored by his organization, the Brian Stack Civic Association, are annual delivery of free turkeys to the needy and free public Thanksgiving dinners.|$|E

40|$|<b>Cell</b> <b>phone</b> use has {{consistently}} risen over recent years; “cord-cutters ” {{may be the}} biggest threat to random digit dial (RDD) surveys since they represent potential respondents who are intentionally avoided during the interview process. In the 2005 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey, <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> <b>numbers</b> – including those ported from a landline – were flagged by the RDD sample vendor and excluded from calling. A question was also inserted into the survey’s introduction that asked if the number reached was a <b>cell</b> <b>phone.</b> If so, the number was immediately removed from further calling. Data from the 2005 BRFSS for multiple states were analyzed. <b>Cell</b> <b>phone</b> <b>numbers</b> were defined as either being flagged in the monthly sample files or the respondent answering affirmatively to reaching a <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> in the survey’s introduction. Numbers that were self-reported to be a <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> were checked against a cumulative database of known <b>cell</b> <b>phones</b> in an effort to validate this response. This paper describes the prevalence of <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> <b>numbers</b> that were identified prior to and during the fielding period.

At least one group of researchers has found that women are less likely to share information that [...] "identifies them directly - last name, <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> <b>number,</b> and address or home phone number," [...] linking that resistance to women's greater concerns about [...] "cyberstalking", [...] "cyberbullying", and security problems.|$|E

50|$|In Hungary, {{telephone}} numbers {{are in the}} format 06 + area code + subscriber number, where the area code is a single digit 1 for Budapest, the capital, followed by a seven digit subscriber number, and two digits followed by either seven (for <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> <b>numbers)</b> or six digits (others). for other areas, <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> <b>numbers</b> or non-geographic numbers like toll-free or premium-rate numbers. Two digit area codes which consist of digits between 2 and 9 are geographic areas, while area codes ending with a 0 or a 1 denote other services. The area code 55, which, according to its first digit, would be normally assigned to a geographic area in Eastern Hungary, is reserved as a test code with no subscriber numbers assigned. There are certain closed networks redefining area code 55 and assigning such numbers for subscribers or machines inside the network, but these are non-standard and non-dialable from outside the network.Telephone numbers starting with the digits 555 are assigned to subscribers as ordinary numbers. Hungarian taxi company Tele5 Taxi uses 555-5555 as a vanity number, while at least one company specializing in vanity <b>numbers</b> sells <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> <b>numbers</b> starting with the digits 555 for a premium rate, capitalizing on their fame in American movies.|$|R

40|$|To meet {{challenges}} {{arising from}} increasing rates of noncoverage in US landline-based telephone samples due to cell-phone-only households, the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) expanded a traditional landline-based random digit dialing survey to a dual-frame survey of landline and <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> <b>numbers.</b> In 2008, {{a survey of}} adults with <b>cell</b> <b>phones</b> only was conducted in parallel with an ongoing landline-based health survey in 18 states. The authors used the optimal approach to allocate samples into landline and cell-phone-only strata and used {{a new approach to}} weighting state-level landline and <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> samples. They developed logistic models for each of 16 health indicators to examine whether exclusion of adults with <b>cell</b> <b>phones</b> only affected estimates after adjustment for demographic characteristics. The extents of the potential biases in landline telephone surveys that exclude <b>cell</b> <b>phones</b> were estimated. Biases resulting from exclusion of adults with <b>cell</b> <b>phones</b> only from the landline-based survey were found for 9 out of the 16 health indicators. Because landline noncoverage rates for adults with <b>cell</b> <b>phones</b> only continue to increase, these biases are likely to increase.
