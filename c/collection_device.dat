25|$|Electrostatic {{precipitators}} An {{electrostatic precipitator}} (ESP), or electrostatic air cleaner is a particulate <b>collection</b> <b>device</b> that removes particles from a flowing gas (such as air), using {{the force of}} an induced electrostatic charge. Electrostatic precipitators are highly efficient filtration devices that minimally impede the flow of gases through the device, and can easily remove fine particulates such as dust and smoke from the air stream.|$|E

Electrostatic precipitators are highly efficient filtration devices that minimally impede the flow of gases through the device, and can easily remove fine particulate matter such as dust and smoke from the air stream.

25|$|Tolls {{are only}} {{collected}} from westbound traffic at the toll plaza {{on the east}} side of the bay. Since July 2010, the toll rate for passenger cars is $5. For vehicles with more than two axles, the toll rate is $5 per axle. Drivers may either pay by cash or use the FasTrak electronic toll <b>collection</b> <b>device.</b> There are seven toll lanes at the plaza. During peak traffic hours, the leftmost lane is designated a FasTrak-only HOV lane, allowing carpool vehicles carrying two or more people or motorcycles to pass for a toll of $2.50. The next two leftmost lanes are FasTrak-only lanes for all vehicles, and all other lanes accept both cash and FasTrak. During non-peak hours the HOV lane is open to vehicles carrying only one person, but remains FasTrak-only.|$|E
25|$|To {{decrease}} {{the risk of}} developing decompression sickness, pilots breathe 100% oxygen for an hour prior to take off to remove nitrogen from the blood. A portable oxygen supply is used during transport to the aircraft. Since 2001, more than a dozen pilots have reportedly suffered the effects of decompression sickness, including permanent brain damage in nine cases; initial symptoms include disorientation and becoming unable to read. Factors increasing the risk of illness since 2001 include longer mission durations and more cockpit activity. Conventional reconnaissance missions would limit pilot duties to maintaining flight path for camera photography. Operations over Afghanistan included more real time activities, such as communication with ground troops, increasing their bodies' oxygen requirements and the risk of nitrogen bubble formation. U-2 pilots now exercise during oxygen pre-breathing. In 2012, modifications were initiated under the Cockpit Altitude Reduction Effort (CARE), increasing the cabin pressure from 3.88 psi to 7.65 psi, a 15,000 foot altitude equivalent. The urine <b>collection</b> <b>device</b> also was rebuilt to eliminate leakage.|$|E

500|$|BLM {{began its}} roundup of feral horses on the Pryor Mountains range in early September 2009. After several days, 130 of 188 feral horses were rounded up. Forty-six horses were {{put up for}} adoption, while the freed mares were given a {{contraceptive}} vaccine {{to help keep the}} herd population down. Also in 2009, BLM also placed [...] "guzzlers" [...] on the range. [...] A guzzler is a precipitation (usually rainwater) <b>collection</b> <b>device</b> which traps water in a storage tank ranging in size from a few to several thousand gallons. The storage tank can be above-ground, partially buried, or below-ground. A mechanical valve releases water into a drinking trough from the storage tanks, allowing animals access to the water. When the valve senses that the water level in the trough is low, it opens and allows more water into the drinking area. Five guzzlers were placed in undergrazed areas to encourage the horses to better utilize this forage.|$|E

40|$|Improper {{design or}} use of blood <b>collection</b> <b>devices</b> can {{adversely}} affect the accuracy of laboratory test results. Vascular access devices, such as cathe-ters and needles, exert shear forces during blood flow, which creates a predisposition to cell lysis. Components from blood collection tubes, such as stoppers, lubricants, surfactants, and separator gels, can leach into specimens and/or adsorb analytes from a specimen; special tube additives may also alter analyte stability. Because of these interactions with blood specimens, blood <b>collection</b> <b>devices</b> are a potential source of pre-analytical error in laboratory testing. Accurate laboratory testing requires {{an understanding of the}} complex interactions between <b>collection</b> <b>devices</b> and blood spe-cimens. Manufacturers, vendors, and clinical laboratorians must consider the pre-analytical challenges in laboratory testing. Although other authors have described the effects of endogenous substances on clinical assay results, the effects/impact of blood collection tube additives and components have not been well systematically described or explained. This review aims to identify and describe blood collection tube additives and their compo-nents and the strategies used to minimize their effects on clinical chemistry assays.
