It allows the opportunity for new annealing cycles with higher heating rates (up to 300 K/s), shorter soaking times, and controlled cooling rates, so that well-recrystallized samples have been achieved in less than several seconds of total process time.

The diurnal cycle of tropical convection is a significant process but its large-scale impact is not well understood. Here we develop a multi-scale analytic model to assess the in-traseasonal impact of planetary-scale inertial oscillations in the diurnal cycle. A self-contained derivation of a multi-scale model governing planetary-scale tropical flows on the daily and intraseasonal time scale is provided below, by following the derivation of systematic multi-scale models for tropical convection. This derivation demonstrates the analytic tractability of the model. The appeal of the multi-scale model devel-oped {{here is that it}} provides assessment of eddy flux divergences of momentum and temperature and their intraseasonal impact on the planetary-scale circulation in a transparent fashion.

Carbothermic reduction process of magnetite containing composites is a typical example of such systems. The reduction process in this case is highly endothermic and hence, the overall rate of the reaction is greatly influenced by the heat transfer through composite compact. Using Laser-Flash method, the change of effective thermal diffusivity of magnetite-graphite composite pellet was monitored in the dynamic mode over a pre-defined thermal <b>cycle</b> (<b>heating</b> at the rate of 7 K/min to 1423 K (1150 A degrees C), holding the sample for 270 minutes at this temperature and then cooling it down to the room temperature at the same rate as heating). These measurements were supplemented by Thermogravimetric Analysis under comparable experimental conditions as well as quenching tests of the samples in order to combine the impact of various factors such as sample dilatations and changes in apparent density on the progress of the reaction. The present results show that monitoring thermal diffusivity changes during the course of reduction would be a very useful tool in a total understanding of the underlying physicochemical phenomena.

These ovens are on an approximate 24 -hour <b>cycle,</b> <b>heating</b> for 12 hours and cooling for 12 hours. Pressurized argon and process water are used to expedite cooling. The proposed modifications aim to minimize cycling by reducing cooling time; they are grouped into three fundamental mechanisms. The first is a recommendation to modify current operating procedures. This entails opening the furnace doors at higher than normal temperatures. A furnace temperature model based on current parameters is used to show the reduction in cooling time in response to opening the furnace doors at higher temperatures. The second mechanism considers the introduction of forced argon convection. Argon is used in the process to mitigate part oxidation. Cycling argon through the furnace during cooling increases convection over the parts and removes heat from the furnace envelope. Heat transfer models based on convective Nusselt correlations are used to determine the increase in heat transfer rate. The last mechanism considers a modification to the current heat exchanger. By decreasing the temperature of the water jacket and increasing heat exchanger efficiency, heat transfer from the furnace is increased and cooling time is shortened.

30|$|The {{combination}} of laboratory experiments with numerical simulations also allows to us discuss the relative influences {{of the physical}} properties at {{the origins of the}} delays measured in CWI. Laboratory measurements embrace all the distinctive contributions to the signal (i.e., changes in properties such as velocity, attenuation, anisotropy, and scattering properties). The comparison of CWI measurements obtained in the simulation with those computed for real laboratory experiments opens real perspectives to distinguish the physical processes of the measured time shifts. Such a comparison is applied here to the <b>cycle</b> <b>heating</b> of Westerly Granite, which is a relevant context when dealing with thermally dynamic environments such as geothermal reservoirs. If the simulation isolates the reversible elastic response of the sample to the thermal loading, the difference in CWI results suggest that there are other reversible deformation mechanisms at play in the laboratory experiments. This comparison of results highlights the partitioning between the different physical processes responsible for time delay in CWI measurements. The discrimination between the different effects induced by thermal variations—changes of properties, such as velocity, attenuation, anisotropy, and scattering properties—of the delays measured with CWI type of signals remains challenging. However, the 8 % ratio highlighted in our study when comparing the slopes d/dT of the linear regression fitted to simulated and laboratory CWI results, provides a first estimate of the thermal strain contribution to CWI measurements. Therefore, the interferometry technique could potentially detect stress changes linked to a reservoir thermal variation during stimulation or exploitation which could help to guide stimulation strategies designed to optimize reservoir productivity.|$|E

This plant consists of 48 parabolic trough collectors; each one has 25 m long and 3. 4 m wide. The plant consists of two cycles, oil heat absorbing cycle and steam production cycle. The plant performance and transition period to reach steady state condition or damping some disturbances as well as oil <b>cycle</b> <b>heating</b> and steam generation rate depends on several factors such as oil cycle response time.

40|$|Microstructure of {{the powder}} {{metallurgy}} (PM) steels and especially mechanism of its formation differs {{significantly from the}} microstructure of the conventional steels even if composition will be exactly the same. The difference is not only connected {{to the presence of}} the pores, which are inalienable feature of the PM parts. Presence of the prior inter-particle boundaries, which can be contaminated by residual oxides, as well as microstructure heterogeneity are another characteristic features of the microstructure of PM steels. Microstructure heterogeneity is connected to the PM manufacturing process: powder mix, consisting of the base powder and additional alloying elements is compacted and then sintered. Fully prealloyed powder is not always possible to use in standard press & sintering route due to the solid solution strengthening of the ferrite resulting in bad powder compressibility. Hence, in order to provide good powder compressibility only pure iron or low-alloyed (typically < 3 wt. %) powders are used. Required alloying elements and carbon (added as graphite) are further admixed in the powder form and are distributed during sintering by diffusion into iron particles at high temperatures. To assure satisfactory distribution of alloying elements, oxide layer, covering surface of the powder particles and hindering mass-transfer of the alloying elements, has to be removed first. This can be done by gaseous reducing agents as hydrogen and carbon monoxide. However, their cost and/or purity are of issue for modern alloyed PM steels. Admixed carbon, additionally to its function as alloying element, plays a role of effective reducing agent at higher temperatures. Paper summarizes the main features of microstructure formation during the whole sintering <b>cycle</b> (<b>heating</b> and isothermal sintering) and effect of alloying additives (different carbon sources, alloying elements) and processing parameters (sintering atmosphere composition, temperature profile) on the microstructure formation during conventional sintering process.

40|$|Solid {{oxide fuel}} cells (SOFCs) are {{the future of}} energy {{production}} in America. They offer great promise as a clean and efficient process for directly converting chemical energy to electricity while providing significant environmental benefits (they produce negligible hydrocarbons, CO, or NO{sub x} and, {{as a result of}} their high efficiency, produce about one-third less CO{sub 2 } per kilowatt hour than internal combustion engines). Unfortunately, the current SOFC technology, based on a stabilized zirconia electrolyte, must operate in the region of 1000 C to avoid unacceptably high ohmic losses. These high temperatures demand (a) specialized (expensive) materials for the fuel cell interconnects and insulation, (b) time to heat up to the operating temperature and (c) energy input to arrive at the operating temperature. Therefore, if fuel cells could be designed to give a reasonable power output at low to intermediate 1 temperatures tremendous benefits may be accrued. At low temperatures, in particular, it becomes feasible to use ferritic steel for interconnects instead of expensive and brittle ceramic materials such as those based on LaCrO{sub 3 }. In addition, sealing the fuel cell becomes easier and more reliable; rapid start-up is facilitated; thermal stresses (e. g., those caused by thermal expansion mismatches) are reduced; radiative losses ({approx}T{sup 4 }) become minimal; electrode sintering becomes negligible and (due to a smaller thermodynamic penalty) the SOFC operating <b>cycle</b> (<b>heating</b> from ambient) would be more efficient. Combined, all these improvements further result in reduced initial and operating costs. The problem is, at lower temperatures the conductivity of the conventional stabilized zirconia electrolyte decreases to the point where it cannot supply electrical current efficiently to an external load. The primary objectives of the proposed research are to develop a stable high conductivity (> 0. 05 S cm{sup - 1 } at {le} 550 C) electrolyte for lower temperature SOFCs. This objective is specifically directed toward meeting the lowest (and most difficult) temperature criteria for the 21 st Century Fuel Cell Program. Meeting this objective provides a potential for future transportation applications of SOFCs, where their ability to directly use hydrocarbon fuels could permit refueling within the existing transportation infrastructure. In order to meet this objective we are developing a functionally gradient bilayer electrolyte comprised of bismuth oxide on the air side and ceria on the fuel side. Bismuth oxide and doped ceria are among the highest ionic conducting electrolytes and in fact bismuth oxide based electrolytes are the only known solid oxide electrolytes to have an ionic conductivity that meets the program conductivity goal...|$|E
