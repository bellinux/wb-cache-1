The world's largest zinc producer is Nyrstar, a merger of the Australian OZ Minerals and the Belgian Umicore. About 70% of the world's zinc originates from mining, while the remaining 30% comes from recycling secondary zinc. <b>Commercially</b> <b>pure</b> zinc is known as Special High Grade, often abbreviated SHG, and is 99.995% pure.|$|E
5|$|About fifty {{grades of}} {{titanium}} and titanium alloys are designed and currently used, although {{only a couple}} of dozen are readily available commercially. The ASTM International recognizes 31 grades of titanium metal and alloys, of which Grades 1 through 4 are <b>commercially</b> <b>pure</b> (unalloyed). Those four vary in tensile strength as a function of oxygen content, with Grade 1 being the most ductile (lowest tensile strength with an oxygen content of 0.18%), and Grade 4 the least ductile (highest tensile strength with an oxygen content of 0.40%). The remaining grades are alloys, each designed for specific properties of ductility, strength, hardness, electrical resistivity, creep resistance, specific corrosion resistance, and combinations thereof.|$|E

40|$|Liquid phase {{deposition}} treatment (LPD) {{was applied}} to form a corrosion protective titanium dioxide (TiO 2) film on <b>commercially</b> available <b>pure</b> magnesium. Changing the solution pH, from acidic to highly alkaline, and {{with the addition of}} sucrose, it becomes possible to form a highly adhesive and thin TiO 2 film on <b>commercially</b> available <b>pure</b> magnesium without any heat treatment. The role of the sucrose may be attributed to the formation of tetrafluoroboric acid (BF 4) - in the solution reducing the homogeneous nucleation of TiO 2 in the LPD solution. The film formed in the weak alkaline environment shows better corrosion resistance than at other LPD conditions, while the average rest potential is {{the same as that of}} as-polished specimens. This low rest potential may be due to micro-cracks in the formed film and high activity of the magnesium substrate...|$|R
25|$|Titanium frames {{typically}} use {{titanium alloys}} and tubes that were originally {{developed for the}} aerospace industry. The most commonly used alloy on titanium bicycle frames is 3AL-2.5V (3.5% Aluminum and 2.5% Vanadium). 6AL-4V (6% Aluminum and 4% Vanadium) is also used, {{but it is more}} difficult to weld, make tubes of, and machine. Often, the tubes are of 3AL-2.5V while dropouts and other peripheral sections are made of 6AL-4V. Experimental frames have been made with <b>commercially</b> <b>pure</b> (CP, i.e.:unalloyed) titanium, but these proved less durable for the active riding intended for frames of this cost level.|$|E
25|$|This is now done {{by forcing}} a jet of {{high-pressure}} oxygen into a special rotating container containing the pig iron. Some {{of the carbon}} is oxidised into carbon monoxide, CO, and carbon dioxide, CO2. This also oxidizes impurities in the pig iron. The container is rotated and the processed pig iron can {{be separated from the}} oxidised impurities. Before the mid 19th century, pig iron from the blast furnace was made into wrought iron, which is <b>commercially</b> <b>pure</b> iron. At that period, if steel was needed, particularly pure varieties of iron were heated with charcoal in a cementation furnace to produce blister steel (with about 1-2% carbon). This might be further purified using the crucible technique, but steel was too expensive to use on a large scale. However, with the introduction of the Bessemer process in the late 1850s and then other processes, the production of steel was dramatically increased. By the late 19th century most iron was being converted to steel before use.|$|E

500|$|A typical implant {{consists}} of a titanium screw (resembling a tooth root) with a roughened or smooth surface. The majority of dental implants are made out of <b>commercially</b> <b>pure</b> titanium, which is available in four grades depending upon the amount of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and iron contained.

Grade 5 titanium, Titanium 6AL-4V, (signifying the titanium alloy containing 6 percent aluminium and 4 percent vanadium alloy) is slightly harder than CP4 and used in the industry mostly for abutment screws and abutments.

Although several <b>commercially</b> available <b>pure</b> optical imaging modalities, including confocal microscopy, two-photon microscopy, and optical coherence tomography, have been highly successful, none of these technologies can provide penetration beyond ~ 1 mm into scattering biological tissues, because they are based on ballistic and quasi-ballistic photons.

Photoacoustic tomography, which combines high ultrasonic resolution and strong optical contrast in a single modality, has broken through this limitation and filled this void.

40|$|<b>Commercially</b> {{available}} <b>pure</b> {{nitrogen gas}} often possesses {{a small amount}} of oxygen impurity that may react with many materials at high temperature. In this research the influences of the oxygen impurity contained in the nitrogen gas on the annealing of a nitride model system- titanium nitride pellets were investigated in the temperature range 400 - 1200 degreesC. Analyzing the in-situ oxygen partial pressure changes when titanium nitride samples were placed in a gas-tight furnace during annealing gives that the dissolution of oxygen in TiN is exothermic and the solubility decreases with increasing temperature. The oxidation involves simultaneously the dissolution of oxygen and the oxide scale formation. X-ray diffraction results show that TiO 2 rutile phase is present above 700 degreesC. Changes in the relative integrated intensity and in the morphology after annealing have also been discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
