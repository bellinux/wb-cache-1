2500|$|The city finally {{extended}} East Capitol Street {{across the}} Anacostia River and Kingman Island in 1955. That 1934 proposal was finally approved by city and federal planners in 1949. Construction required that [...] of lake bottom be dredged from Kingman Lake {{and replaced with}} sand and gravel to create a gently curving peninsula that extended [...] into {{the western side of}} the lake. [...] of fill would be used to raise the peninsula [...] above the low water mark, so that the bridge's western approaches <b>could</b> <b>built</b> on <b>the</b> <b>new</b> land. <b>The</b> Whitney Young Memorial Bridge opened in November 1955.|$|R
50|$|In 1913, the North Catasauqua School District razed the four-room Allen Township schoolhouse {{so that a}} <b>new</b> one <b>could</b> be <b>built.</b> <b>The</b> <b>new</b> school {{building}} housed grade 1-8 and featured, what were at the time, state-of-the-art amenities. After a merger of North Catasauqua and Catasauqua school districts in 1953, the school housed elementary grades 1-6 until June 1972. In 1975, North Catasauqua Borough obtained possession {{of the building and}} transferred the municipal offices to the site in 1976. In 1995, extensive renovations took place and a rededication ceremony was held in 1996. The municipal building now houses the borough police department, borough offices, council chambers, a meeting room, fire department administrative headquarters, as well as room for future expansion.|$|R
50|$|They {{surveyed}} {{the property and}} subdivided it into building lots shortly afterward. At auction, the lots sold {{for an average of}} $25 per square foot. However, the Panic of 1837 slowed the economy shortly afterwards, and ground was not broken until the early 1850s when Joseph Corlies, one of <b>the</b> partners, <b>built</b> himself <b>the</b> house at 28 Garfield as a demonstration of what sort of home <b>could</b> be <b>built</b> on <b>the</b> <b>new</b> street.|$|R
5000|$|Nicolet's {{financial}} success {{was such that}} in 1762 {{he was able to}} apply for permission to construct a much larger and more substantial theatre. He leased a plot of land located further along the boulevard on the northeast side, away from the city. The site had previously been part of the moat, which had been filled in, but was still extremely boggy and needed to be drained, raised, and leveled before the wooden structure <b>could</b> be <b>built.</b> <b>The</b> <b>new</b> theatre, referred to as the Salle des Grands Danseurs, opened in 1764, and was even more successful at attracting large audiences, and [...] "on Sundays, it was by no means unusual to see a couple of thousand spectators besieging the doors." [...] Rivals during this period were few; those who tried, failed to compete and quickly departed.|$|R
25|$|A {{range of}} local, low-tech {{solutions}} are {{being pursued by}} a number of companies. These efforts center around the use of solar power to distill water at temperatures slightly beneath that at which water boils. By developing the capability to purify any available water source, local business models <b>could</b> be <b>built</b> around <b>the</b> <b>new</b> technologies, accelerating their uptake. For example, bedouins from the town of Dahab in Egypt have installed AquaDania's WaterStillar, which uses a solar thermal collector measuring two square metres to distill from 40 to 60 litres per day from any local water source. This is five times more efficient than conventional stills and eliminates the need for polluting plastic PET bottles or transportation of water supply.|$|R
40|$|Trinity Methodist Church of El Paso, Texas, {{was founded}} in 1881, as the Union Sunday School by Rev. A. H. Sutherland, the {{presiding}} elder of the South and West Texas Conference, and Rev. John R. Carter. It was housed in a one-story adobe building {{at the corner of}} Mesa and San Antonio Streets. Rev. Carter served as the first minister from 1881 - 1884. When the congregation outgrew this structure, services were held in a tent erected at the corner of San Antonio and Kansas Streets until a <b>new</b> church <b>could</b> be <b>built.</b> <b>The</b> <b>new</b> frame church was dedicated January 29, 1882. The first session of <b>the</b> <b>New</b> Mexico Conference was convened here in 1890. As the business district encroached on the church, the building was sold and property at Mesa and Boulevard (now Yandell) was purchased. The cornerstone for the brick church was laid on April 29, 1906. In 1939, that structure was razed and a <b>new</b> sanctuary in <b>the</b> Spanish renaissance style was <b>built.</b> <b>The</b> collection contains materials that appear to have been compiled by Mrs. Frank D. Norwood {{and other members of the}} 90 th Anniversary Committee. The bulk of the collection is research and transcription from a variety of newspapers, journals, and newsletters. Also included are photographs of the building, pastors, and members of committees, as well publications of the church, other El Paso Methodist churches, and other Methodist organizations...|$|R
