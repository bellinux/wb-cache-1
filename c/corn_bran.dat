30|$|Ferulic acid (4 -hydroxy- 3 -methoxycinnamic acid, FA) is {{abundant}} {{in nature and}} is derived from lignocellulosic biomass. FA is esterified to an arabinosyl residue of arabinoxylan in the plant cell wall and is linked to lignin (Walton et al. 2000). FA is a 3 -o-methyl phenolic moiety of lignin that crosslinks hemicellulose and lignin in the plant cell wall (Gopalan et al. 2015). FA is present in abundance in crops and in agricultural wastes such as rice <b>bran,</b> maize <b>bran,</b> <b>corn</b> and wheat <b>brans,</b> or straw (Gopalan et al. 2015). FA can be released from arabinosyl residues of arabinoxylan in the plant cell wall using alkaline solvents or enzymes (Gopalan et al. 2015). Maize bran contains approximately 30  g FA/kg dry weight of cell wall materials (Benoit et al. 2006). <b>Corn</b> and rice <b>bran</b> each contain approximately 32 and 33  g FA/kg dry weight of cell wall material, respectively (Mathew and Abraham 2004; Schmidt et al. 2013).

5000|$|Anglicisms, due to {{cultural}} and commercial influence from the United States and the American occupations of the Dominican Republic during 1916-1924 and 1965-1966, are extremely common in Dominican Spanish, {{more so than}} in any other Spanish variant, save for Puerto Rican and perhaps Northern Mexican Spanish. A prime example of this is [...] "vaguada", which is a corruption of the English [...] "bad weather", though in Dominican Spanish the term has come to mean storm or torrential downpour, rather than a spot of unpleasant climate. Hence, a common Dominican expression: [...] "Viene una vaguada", [...] "here comes a vaguada", or [...] "here comes a storm". Another excellent example of this is [...] "boche", a corruption of the English [...] "bull shit", though in Dominican Spanish the term has come to mean a reprimanding, fulmination, or harangue in general terms. Hence, a common Dominican expression: [...] "Me echaron un boche", [...] "they threw me a boche", or [...] "they reprimanded me". The pronoun [...] "they" [...] in Dominican Spanish often refers to the third person singular, so that me dijeron, [...] "they told me", is sometimes used instead of [...] "a man told me", or [...] "a woman told me", or [...] "the young boy by the lemon tree told me". Furthermore, is the Dominican Spanish word for SUV, [...] "yipeta", [...] "jeepeta", or rarely [...] "gipeta". This term is a corruption of the American [...] "Jeep", which was the primary mode of transport for the GI's throughout the country during the occupation in the 1960s. Dominican license plates for SUVs are marked with a [...] "G" [...] for [...] "gipeta", a variant of, and pronounced like, [...] "yipeta", before their serial number. The word [...] "tichel", from [...] "T-shirt", also refers to a rugby shirt, association football jersey, or undershirt, and similarly, [...] "corn flakes" [...] and its variant [...] "con fléi" [...] can refer to any breakfast cereal, in Dominican Spanish, be it puffed <b>corn,</b> <b>bran</b> flakes, or puffed wheat. The borrowing [...] "polo shirt" [...] is frequently pronounced polo ché.|$|E

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the effect of 2 hulless barley varieties, with or without the addition of a nonstarch polysaccharide (NSP) enzyme complex (β-glucanase and xylanase), on growth performance of weaned piglets in a 42 -d feeding study. The {{study was conducted}} with 140 piglets (PIC × Duroc). Pigs were allocated to pens (4 castrated males or 4 females per pen) based on BW and sex, and pens were assigned to 5 experimental diets with 4 pens of castrated males and 3 pens of females per treatment. Five isonitrogenous and isoenergetic diets were compared: 1) control corn-based diet (CTR), 2) diet with <b>corn</b> and wheat <b>bran</b> replaced by the Astartis hulless barley variety (AS), 3) diet with <b>corn</b> and wheat <b>bran</b> replaced by the AS supplemented with the NSP enzyme complex (ASE), 4) diet with <b>corn</b> and wheat <b>bran</b> replaced by the Alamo hulless barley variety (AL), and 5) diet with <b>corn</b> and wheat <b>bran</b> replaced by the AL supplemented with the NSP enzyme complex (ALE). The diets were formulated to meet or exceed nutrient requirements and offered in 2 phases: d 0 to 14 and d 14 to 42. At the end of the study, pigs fed AS and AL had equal weights as pigs fed CTR. Pigs fed the hulless barley diets had greater (P < 0. 05) ADG during the second phase (P 2) and overall phase, BW at d 42, and G:F during the P 2 than those fed the CTR. Pigs fed the ASE and ALE had greater (P < 0. 05) ADFI during the P 2 and overall ADG than those fed the AS and AL. The increases in ADG during the P 2 and final BW obtained with NSP enzyme supplementation were greater in pigs fed the AS than those fed the AL (barley × enzyme, P < 0. 05). On the other hand, the NSP enzyme complex increased G:F in pigs fed the AS during the P 2 and overall phase, but it had no effect on those fed the AL (barley × enzyme, P < 0. 05). In conclusion, hulless barley with or without the NSP enzyme complex can be a replacement ingredient for <b>corn</b> and wheat <b>bran</b> in weaned pig diets. Addition of the NSP enzyme complex to AS variety, but not AL variety, improved growth performance of weanling pigs...|$|R
