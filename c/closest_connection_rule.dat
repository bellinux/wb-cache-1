40|$|IN ENGLISH The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{determine}} and evaluate conflict of law rules for designating the applicable law in contractual obligations {{in the absence of}} parties' choice. Such rules can be found in international, European or national legal sources, hence the scope of any particular regulation has to be considered in detail. The core of this thesis shall be the European private international law, especially the Article 4 of the Regulation on the law applicable to contractual obligations (Rome I), effective from 17 December 2009, which shall apply to contractual obligations in civil and commercial matters in situations involving a conflict of laws, if the applicable has not been chosen by the parties. New Article 4 of the Regulation tends to enhance certainty and to overcome interpretative difficulties in Rome Convention. Required certainty shall be expressed by introduction of hard-and-fast rules included in Article 4 (1) Regulation supplemented by the characteristic performance rule in paragraph 2. On the other hand, flexibility shall be ascertained through escape clause and <b>closest</b> <b>connection</b> <b>rule,</b> which aims to disregard applicable law designated by paragraphs 1 and 2 in situations when the contract is manifestly more closely connected with another country. Although the wording and [...] ...|$|E

Following this rule ensures that the final result of a sequence of probability revisions is undisturbed by an alteration in the temporal order of the learning prompting these revisions. There is also a <b>close</b> <b>connection</b> between this <b>rule</b> and an intriguing metric on probability measures introduced by Chan and Darwiche...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the utility of}} fuzzy logic {{in the field of}} control engineering. A tutorial introduction to the field of fuzzy control is presented during the development of an efficient fuzzy controller. Using the controller as a starting point, a set of criteria are developed that ensure a <b>close</b> <b>connection</b> between <b>rule</b> base construction and control surface geometry. The properties of the controller are exploited in the design of a global controller optimiser based on a genetic algorithm, and a tutorial explaining how the optimiser may be used to effect automatic controller design is given. A library of software that implements a fast fuzzy controller, a genetic algorithm, and various utility routines is included...|$|R
40|$|In Germany, the Act to Modernize Accounting Law (Bilanzrechtsmodernisierungsgesetz - BilMoG) {{which was}} promulgated on 29 May, 2009 {{introduced}} some major {{changes to the}} German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch - HGB), such as removing the <b>close</b> <b>connection</b> to tax <b>rules</b> and controversial policy options currently available to companies for fmancial reporting. This chapter provides a critical examination of the recent reforms of the regulatory environment of accounting in Germany. Data for the study were collected through a document survey and interviews of a selected group of key individuals and an online focus group, who had an influence on and/or interest in accounting regulation in Germany. Findings of this study raise some interesting issues related to international fmancial reporting. We found {{that as a result}} of the reforms, German accounting shifted away from the Continental European model and closer to the Anglo-American model. We also found that the reforms were aimed mainly at addressing domestic concerns, and not necessarily at converging with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). 17 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Non-Contractual Obligations in Private International Law This thesis {{deals with}} non-contractual {{obligations}} in private international law. The most important {{law in this}} area is the Rome II Regulation on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations that applies since 11 January 2009. The Regulation creates a common regime of conflict of law rules for most civil and commercial non-contractual obligations. The general rule is the law of the place of injury (lex loci damni). The rule is subject to two exceptions, the common habitual residence exception and a general escape clause based on the <b>closer</b> <b>connection</b> principle. Special <b>rules</b> are laid down for some non-contractual obligations, such as product liability, unfair competition and acts restricting free competition, environmental damages, infringement of intellectual property rights, unjust enrichment, negotiorum gestio and culpa in contrahendo. However, in most cases, the parties may agree on the law applicable to the non- contractual obligations between them. Post-tort agreements may be made between all parties whereas pre-tort agreements are allowed only where all the parties are pursuing commercial activity. Where the Rome II Regulation does not apply the courts will look to the relevant national legislation, which is the Private [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Classification {{techniques}} {{based on}} one or few dimensions are widely used in research studies and textbooks to explain and predict the development of accounting systems internationally. However, their usefulness in international accounting has been limited in today's globalized world. For example, {{in the context of}} the EU, IFRS are required for consolidated accounting, while national accounting systems continue to be the dominant system for unconsolidated accounting in many countries. Using Germany as a case study, the objective of this paper is to examine whether Germany can still be classified within the Continental European model of accounting following the Act to Modernize Accounting Law (Bilanzrechts-modernisierungsgesetz - BilMoG), which was promulgated on May 29, 2009. This Act introduced some major reforms to the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch - HGB), such as removing the <b>close</b> <b>connection</b> to tax <b>rules</b> and introducing new recognition and valuation regulations, which changed traditional principles of orderly accounting (Grundsätze ordnungsmäβiger Buchführung). As a result, the current German approach of financial reporting separates Germany from the traditional Continental European model of accounting and moves it somewhere on a spectrum between the traditional Continental European model of accounting and the Anglo-American model of accounting. 10 page(s...|$|R
40|$|An Act to Modernize Accounting Law (Bilanzrechtsmodernisierungsgesetz - BilMoG) {{has been}} promulgated on 29 May, 2009, and it {{introduces}} some major {{changes to the}} German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch - HGB), such as removing the <b>close</b> <b>connection</b> to tax <b>rules</b> and controversial policy options currently available to companies for financial reporting. This paper provides a critical examination of the recent reforms of the regulatory environment for accounting in Germany. Data for the study were also collected through interviews of a selected group of individuals and an online focus group, who had an influence on and/or interest in accounting regulation in Germany. Findings of this study raise two issues related to international financial reporting. First, we found that although {{as a result of}} the reforms, German accounting shifted away from the Continental European model and closer to the Anglo-American model, the reforms were aimed at addressing some domestic concerns, and not necessarily at converging with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Second, this suggests that the new German law on financial reporting by firms is likely to act as an impediment to any effort to harmonize financial reporting standards within the European Union unless such effort is based on the German model. 17 page(s...|$|R

This paper {{discusses}} the <b>closest</b> <b>connection</b> as a relationship resembling the function in mathematics. Firstly, {{it is the}} relationship between a legal issue ant the law applicable to that issue. Secondly, the <b>closest</b> <b>connection</b> determines also the way, how legal issues are defined. It means, that the <b>closest</b> <b>connection</b> constitutes relationship between the factual matrix of the case and the legal issues resulting thereof. Thirdly, the appropriate provisions of the applicable law are also determined {{on the basis of the}} <b>closest</b> <b>connection.</b> Accordingly, the case should be decided by these rules of the applicable law, which cover the factual matrix of that case with their scope of application, notwithstanding the qualification assumed by the applicable law. In this way the rules, which have the <b>closest</b> <b>connection</b> to the case will come into operation. In the nutshell, the <b>closest</b> <b>connection</b> joins factual and legal elements. Another problem discussed in this paper is the attempt of description of the <b>closest</b> <b>connection.</b> It has been done by the analysis of the interplay of the four fundamental principles of the private international law: the <b>closest</b> <b>connection,</b> predictability, party autonomy and the protection of the weaker party. It has been shown, that the <b>closest</b> <b>connection</b> is always a starting point, however usually not the final goal of the private international law...|$|R
40|$|The envelope-function method with {{generalized}} {{boundary conditions}} {{is applied to}} the description of localized and resonant interface states. A complete set of phenomenological conditions which restrict the form of <b>connection</b> <b>rules</b> for envelope functions is derived using the Hermiticity and symmetry requirements. Empirical coefficients in the <b>connection</b> <b>rules</b> play role of material parameters which characterize an internal structure of every particular heterointerface. As an illustration we present the derivation of the most general <b>connection</b> <b>rules</b> for the one-band effective mass and 4 -band Kane models. The conditions for the existence of Tamm-like localized interface states are established. It is shown that a nontrivial form of the <b>connection</b> <b>rules</b> can also result in the formation of resonant states. The most transparent manifestation of such states is the resonant tunneling through a single-barrier heterostructure. Comment: RevTeX 4, 11 pages, 5 eps figures, submitted to Phys. Rev. ...|$|R

40|$|Within social choice theory, the {{new field}} of {{judgment}} aggregation aims at reaching collective judgments {{on a set of}} logically interconnected propositions. I investigate decision problems, in which the agenda is a network, composed of atomic propositions and <b>connection</b> <b>rules</b> between them. Networks can represent various realistic decision problems, including most concrete examples given in the literature. Nevertheless, networks are unexplored so far due to problems when modelling <b>connection</b> <b>rules</b> in standard propositional logic. By extending the logic, I prove that, for any network, decision rules satisfying the common conditions always exist, in contrast to the literature's emphasis on impossibilities. I also characterise the class of such decision rules, and propose a simple way to select a decision rule. judgment aggregation, collective inconsistency, possibility theorems, network, <b>connection</b> <b>rule,</b> formal logic, material conditional, subjunctive conditional...|$|R
