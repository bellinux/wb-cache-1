40|$|Significant {{developments}} {{have taken place}} in defining technology standards and identifying avenues for technological innovations to reduce the cost of manufacturing RFID tags below the $ 0. 05 price point. The Auto-ID center at MIT has been the central coordinating body with participation from 5 universities and over 100 industry partners. The primary focus of these efforts has been in developing a standard which minimizes the logic capability of on chip circuitry and using radical innovations to reduce the cost of assembly of the RFID tags. Various disruptive innovations are underway to explore lithographic techniques which can reduce the cost of fabrication in the sub 100 nm regime wherein photolithography faces significant challenges. This research analyzes the value chain in the RFID industry and reviews potential technology strategies using the double-helix model of business dynamics and Porter's five forces framework. It also explores {{the current state of the}} art in RFID tag manufacturing and proposes the application of disruptive technologies in conjunction with innovations in assembly and packaging to enable a low cost RFID system design. Five key emerging technologies which are examined in detail are Nanoimprint Lithography, Step and Flash Imprint Lithography, Inkjet Printing, Soft lithography and Spherical Integrated Circuit Processing. These are analyzed in terms of application to RFID tag manufacturing. Current innovations in high speed and low cost assembly and packaging techniques are also examined. Fluidic Self Assembly, Vibratory Assembly, <b>Chip</b> <b>on</b> <b>Paper</b> techniques are reviewed in terms of application to RFID manufacturing. A systems thinking approach is also pursued to explore the drivers for wider acceptance of RFID-based(cont.) applications in addition to just depending on cost reduction for crossing the chasm from early adopters to a wider market penetration.

Floorplan is {{a crucial}} {{estimation}} task in the modern layout design of systems <b>on</b> <b>chips.</b> The <b>paper</b> presents a novel theoretical upper bound for slicing floorplans with soft modules. We show that, given a set of soft modules of total area Atotal, maximum area Amax, and shape flexibility r ≥ 2. 25, there exists a slic-ing floorplan F of these modules such that Area(F) ≤ min{ 1. 131,(1 + β) }Atotal, where β =...|$|R
40|$|This paper presents, for {{the first}} time, an inkjet printed, wearable, low-cost, light weight and {{miniaturized}} real time locating TAG on an ordinary photo-paper. The 29 grams, 9 cm× 8 cm× 0. 5 cm TAG integrates a GPS/GSM module, a microcontroller with on-paper GPS and GSM antennas. A novel monopole antenna with an L shaped slit is introduced to achieve the required circular polarization for the GPS band. Issues related to integration of active components (e. g. BGA <b>chip)</b> <b>on</b> inkjet-printed <b>paper</b> substrates are discussed. The system enables location tracking through a user-friendly interface accessible through all internet enabled devices. Field tests show an update interval of 15 sec, stationary position error of 6. 2 m and real time tracking error of 4. 7 m which is 4 times better than the state-of-the-art. Due to the flexible nature of the paper substrate, the TAG can be designed for different shapes such as a wrist band for child tracking or a collar band for pet tracking applications. © 2013 IEEE...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Bug-free first silicon is not {{guaranteed}} by the existing pre-silicon verification techniques. To have impeccable products, it is now required to identify any bug {{as soon as the}} first silicon becomes available. We consider the Assertion Based Verification techniques for the post-silicon debugging based on the insertion of hardware checkers in the debug infrastructure for complex systems <b>on</b> <b>chip.</b> This <b>paper</b> proposes a method to cluster hardware-assertion checkers using the graph partitioning approach. It turns out that having the clusters of hardwareassertions and controlling each cluster selectively during the debug mode and normal operation of the circuit makes integration of assertions inside the circuits easier, and causes lower energy consumption and efficient debug scheduling.

40|$|Design, mapping, and {{simulations}} of a 3 G WCDMA/FDD basestation using network <b>on</b> <b>chip</b> This <b>paper</b> presents {{a case study}} of a single-chip 3 G WCDMA/FDD basestation implementation based on a circuit-switched network <b>on</b> <b>chip.</b> As the amount of transistors <b>on</b> a <b>chip</b> continues to increase, so does the possibility to integrate more functionality onto every chip. By combining general-purpose and application-specific hardware, it is possible to integrate the complete baseband part of a 3 G basestation <b>on</b> a single <b>chip.</b> Such a single-chip basestation has been modeled from a communication perspective without full implementations of the processing elements. The system has been scheduled and implemented as a traffic model for a network <b>on</b> <b>chip</b> simulator. Simulation results show perfect adherence to the schedule already at a network clock frequency of 75 MHz. The overall network usage is relatively low except for the area closest to the radio interfaces. This will allow for other messages, e. g. control related, to be transported over the network during the gaps in the communication schedule...|$|R
40|$|Testing {{and power}} {{consumption}} are becoming two critical issues in VLSI design {{due to the}} growing complexity of VLSI circuits and remarkable success and growth of low power applications (viz. portable consumer electronics and space applications). <b>On</b> <b>chip</b> Built In Self Test (BIST) is a cost-effective test methodology for highly complex VLSI devices like Systems <b>On</b> <b>Chip.</b> This <b>paper</b> deals with cost-effective Test Pattern Generation (TPG) schemes in BIST. We present a novel methodology based {{on the use of}} a suitable Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) which cycles through the required sequences (test vectors) aiming at a desired fault coverage causing minimum circuit toggling and hence low power consumption while testing. The proposed technique uses circuit simulation data for modeling. We show how to identify the LFSR using graph theory techniques and compute its feedback coefficients (i. e., its characteristic polynomial) for realization of a Test Pattern Generator...|$|R
