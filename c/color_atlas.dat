40|$|Abstract — A {{robust and}} {{accurate}} hue descriptor that {{is useful in}} modeling human color perception and for computer vision applications is explored. The hue descriptor {{is based on the}} peak wavelength of a Gaussian-like function (called a wraparound Gaussian) and is shown to correlate as well as CIECAM 02 hue to the hue designators of papers from the Munsell and Natural <b>Color</b> System <b>color</b> <b>atlases</b> and to the hue names found in Moroney’s Color Thesaurus. The new hue descriptor is also shown to be significantly more stable under a variety of illuminants than CIECAM 02. The use of wraparound Gaussians as a hue model is similar in spirit to the use of subtractive Gaussians proposed by Mizokami et al., but overcomes many of their limitations.

These tapes contained the F 08 SSM/I data for the period from July 1988 through December 1991 and the F 10 SSM/I data for the period from December 1990 through December 1991. For the F 08 SSM/I, a data inventory was compiled and an engineering assessment was done. Ephemeris tables for the F 08 and F 10 spacecrafts were computed.

40|$|To avoid a vast {{rejection}} of {{evolution in the}} Muslim world, scientists can present the theory as the bedrock of biology and can stress its practical applications. Early in 2007, biologists and anthropologists at universities across the United States received an unsolicited gift of an 850 -page, <b>colored</b> <b>Atlas</b> of Creation, produced by a Muslim creationist, Adnan Oktar, {{who goes by the}} pen name of Harun Yahya (Science, 16 February 2007, p. 925). The atlas was a timely notice that, although the last couple of decades have seen an increasing confrontation over the teaching of evolution in the United States, the next major battle over evolution is likely to take place in the Muslim world (i. e., predominantly Islamic countries, as well as in countries where there are large Muslim populations). Relatively poor education standards, in combination with frequent misinformation about evolutionary ideas, make the Muslim world a fertile ground for {{rejection of}} the theory. In addition, there already exists a growing and highly influential Islamic creationist movement (1). Biological evolution is still a relatively new concept for a majority of Muslims, and a serious debate over its religious compatibility has not yet taken place. It is likely that public opinion on this issue will be shaped in the next decade or so because of rising education levels in the Muslim world and the increasing importance of biological sciences. Views of Evolution from Scholars Just as there is no monolithic Islam, there is no “official ” opinion on evolution. There are indeed verses in the Koran that talk about the creation of the universe and of the living beings on Earth, but specific details are often not laid out. For example, the Koranic narrative of creation includes a 6 -day account of creation. The length of each day, however, is not clearly specified. One day has been defined as “a thousand years of what you count ” (32 : 5) or as “a day the measure of which is fifty thousand years ” (70 : 4). The resulting ambiguity leaves open the possibility of a very old Earth. Indeed, young-Earth creationism is wholly absent in the Muslim world, and a universe billions of years old i...|$|R

40|$|We have {{obtained}} integrated and nuclear spectra {{as well as}} U, B, R surface photometry for {{a representative sample of}} 196 nearby galaxies. These galaxies span the entire Hubble sequence in morphological type, as well as a wide range of luminosities (M(B) = - 14 to - 22). Here we present the spectrophotometry for these galaxies. The selection of the sample and the U, B, R surface photometry is described in a companion paper. Our goals for the project include measuring the current star formation rates and metallicities of these galaxies, and elucidating their star formation histories, as a function of luminosity and morphology. We thereby extend the work of Kennicutt to lower luminosity systems. We anticipate that our study will be useful as a benchmark for studies of galaxies at high redshift. We describe the observing, data reduction, and calibration techniques and demonstrate that our spectrophotometry agrees well with that of Kennicutt. The spectra span the range 3550 - 7250 Angstrom, at a resolution (FWHM) of similar to 6 Angstrom and have an overall relative spectrophotometric accuracy of similar to +/- 6 %. We present a spectrophotometric atlas of integrated and nuclear rest-frame spectra as well as tables of equivalent widths and synthetic <b>colors.</b> The <b>atlas</b> and tables of measurements will be made available electronically. We study the correlations of galaxy properties determined from the spectra and images. Our findings include: (1) galaxies of a given morphological class display a wide range of continuum shapes and emission-line strengths if a broad range of luminosities are considered, (2) emission-line strengths tend to increase and continua tend to get bluer as the luminosity decreases, and (3) the scatter on the general correlation between nuclear and integrated H alpha emission-line strengths is large...|$|R

40|$|We {{recently}} had to repaint our house. Like many traditional houses, also ours was painted {{in a single}} off-white color inside-out. We asked several color scientists how they designed a color scheme for their house or apartment {{the last time they}} had to paint. We were surprised to invariably receive the same answer: “I did not want to take any risk; I painted everything white. ” This prompted us to a challenge and try to design a bold color scheme. Based on previous work, we decided to design the color scheme as a set of symmetries in a perceptually defined color space. Although we had the software tools for designing a scheme in CIELAB, it turned out that using a computer was inconvenient and it was difficult to reliably predict in an uncontrolled environment the color appearance for small color nuances. The color chips available from paint stores were not suitable because the colors were not ordered in three dimensions. Since the second edition of the Natural <b>Color</b> System (NCS) <b>atlas</b> had recently become available and is widely used by designers in some European countries, we decided to design our color scheme using this system.

50|$|How {{important}} the <b>color</b> <b>atlas</b> {{would be for}} the artist from now on when he was designing or composing pictures can be not only seen in works such as Rivoli, Pompejanisches ("Pompeian"), Camogli, Recco or Arkadisches ("Arcadian"), but already in the sheets Siena I to III. As a former construction expert, he was often greatly taken by architectural aspects. In Siena the earthen colors of the brick buildings dominate. They are interwoven by rhythmic accents - of light and shade, rust-red and olive-green. On the other hand, all sorts of variations blue and gray dominate in the works in which he took the atlas plates of Florence to hand (Toscanische Stadt/Tuscan City, 1932), the city in which the artist repeatedly took refuge in the future. The works that are related to Florence are especially full of allusions to architectural motifs and colorful flashes, and infused with the city's characteristic bright light. After going into exile, Nebel interpreted both building motifs and landscapes through the lens of the Farben-Atlas ("Color Atlas").|$|E
