6000|$|The {{burden of}} the valley of vision: woe to the Honourable Adam B. Hunt! Where is he all this time? On the porch of his home in Edmundton, smoking cigars, little heeding the rising of the waters; {{receiving}} visits from the Honourables Brush Bascom, Nat Billings, and Jacob Botcher, and signing <b>cheques</b> <b>to</b> the <b>order</b> of these gentlemen for necessary expenses. Be it known that the Honourable Adam {{was a man of}} substance in this world's goods. To quote from Mr. Crewe's speech at Hull: [...] "The Northeastern Railroads confer--they do not pay, except in passes. Of late years their books may be searched in vain for evidence of the use of political funds. The man upon whom they choose to confer your governorship is always able to pay the pipers."

50|$|<b>Cheque</b> fraud refers <b>to</b> a {{category}} of criminal acts that involve making the unlawful use of <b>cheques</b> in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> illegally acquire or borrow funds that do not exist within the account balance or account-holder's legal ownership. Most methods involve {{taking advantage of the}} float (the time between the negotiation of the cheque and its clearance at the cheque-writer's bank) to draw out these funds. Specific kinds of cheque fraud include cheque kiting, where funds are deposited {{before the end of the}} float period to cover the fraud, and paper hanging, where the float offers the opportunity <b>to</b> write fraudulent <b>cheques</b> but the account is never replenished.|$|R

5000|$|An unknown rogue stole a {{blank cheque}} in Nigeria from one Commander Robert Bill, {{who was a}} retired naval office living in Lagos, and a {{customer}} of National Westminster Bank. The rogue (or an accomplice) then met the second defendant, a Mr Ismail. At the relevant time Nigeria operated foreign exchange controls. The official rate pegged the Nigerian pound to the British pound at 1:1, but a black market had grown up whereby people would exchange currency unofficially at around a 30% premium to the official rate. [...] Mr Ismael wished to get money out of Nigeria, and the rogue claimed {{to be able to}} broker a black market trade. Mr Ismael agreed that he would accept a cheque for £8,000 in London and if it cleared, he would then write a <b>cheque</b> <b>to</b> the rogue's <b>order</b> drawn on his bank in Nigeria at the black market rate.|$|R

According to Mr. Seely's story,--of the truth of which he declared himself to be by no means certain,--Crinkett had wished to go, but had been retained by the woman. 'As far as I can learn,' said Mr. Seely, 'she is in communication with the Boltons, who will of course keep her if it be possible. He would get off if he could; but she, I take it, has got hold of the money. When you made the <b>cheque</b> payable <b>to</b> her <b>order,</b> you effectually provided for their remaining here. If he could have got the money without her name, he would have gone, and she would have gone with him.' ...|$|R

60|$|What Sir Harry {{did with}} Captain Stubber {{need not be}} {{minutely}} described. There {{can be no doubt}} that Cousin George was not spared by the Captain, and that when he understood what might be the result of telling the truth, he told all that he knew. In that matter of the £500 Cousin George had really been ill-treated. The payment had done him no sort of service whatever. Of Captain Stubber's interview with Sir Harry nothing further need now be said. But it must be explained that Sir Harry, led astray by defective information, made a mistake in regard to Mrs. Morton, and found out his mistake. He did not much like Mrs. Morton, but he did not leave her without an ample apology. From Mrs. Morton he learned nothing whatever in regard to Cousin George,--nothing but this, that Mrs. Morton did not deny that she was acquainted with Captain Hotspur. Mr. Boltby had learned, however, that Cousin George had drawn the money for a <b>cheque</b> payable <b>to</b> her <b>order,</b> and he had made himself nearly certain of the very nature of the transaction.|$|R
5000|$|A payee that {{accepts a}} cheque will {{typically}} deposit {{it in an}} account at the payee's bank, and have the bank process the cheque. In some cases, the payee will take the <b>cheque</b> <b>to</b> {{a branch of the}} drawee bank, and cash the cheque there. If a cheque is refused at the drawee bank (or the drawee bank returns the <b>cheque</b> <b>to</b> the bank that it was deposited at) because there are insufficient funds for the <b>cheque</b> <b>to</b> clear, it is said that the cheque has been dishonoured. Once a cheque is approved and all appropriate accounts involved have been credited, the cheque is stamped with some kind of cancellation mark, such as a [...] "paid" [...] stamp. The cheque is now a cancelled cheque. Cancelled cheques are placed in the account holder's file. The account holder can request a copy of a cancelled cheque as proof of a payment. This is known as the cheque clearing cycle.|$|R
50|$|<b>To</b> {{settle a}} <b>cheque,</b> it has <b>to</b> be {{presented}} to the drawee bank for payment. Originally this was done by taking the <b>cheque</b> <b>to</b> the drawee bank, but as cheque usage increased this became cumbersome and banks arranged to meet each day at a central location <b>to</b> exchange <b>cheques</b> and settle the money. This became known as central clearing. Bank customers who received cheques could deposit them at their own bank, who would arrange for the <b>cheque</b> <b>to</b> be returned to the drawee bank and the money credited to and debited from the appropriate accounts. If a cheque was dishonoured or bounced it would be physically returned to the original bank marked as such.|$|R
