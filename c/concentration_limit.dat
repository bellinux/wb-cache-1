50|$|Simply due to {{the high}} number of {{microorganism}} in MBRs, the pollutants uptake rate can be increased. This leads to better degradation in a given time span or to smaller required reactor volumes. In comparison to the conventional activated sludge process (ASP) which typically achieves 95 percent, COD removal can be increased to 96 to 99 percent in MBRs (see table,). COD and BOD5 removal are found to increase with MLSS concentration. Above 15 g/L COD removal becomes almost independent of biomass concentration at >96 percent. Arbitrary high MLSS concentrations are not employed, however, as oxygen transfer is impeded due to higher and non-Newtonian fluid viscosity. Kinetics may also differ due to easier substrate access. In ASP, flocs may reach several 100 μm in size. This means that the substrate can reach the active sites only by diffusion which causes an additional resistance and limits the overall reaction rate (diffusion controlled). Hydrodynamic stress in MBRs reduces floc size (to 3.5 μm in sidestream MBRs) and thereby increases the apparent reaction rate. Like in the conventional ASP, sludge yield is decreased at higher SRT or biomass concentration. Little or no sludge is produced at sludge loading rates of 0.01 kgCOD/(kgMLSS d). Because of the imposed biomass <b>concentration</b> <b>limit,</b> such low loading rates would result in enormous tank sizes or long HRTs in conventional ASP.|$|E
40|$|The maximal <b>concentration</b> <b>limit</b> {{of solar}} {{radiation}} for photovoltaic applications {{is assumed to}} be constant, at Cmax≈ 46, 000 suns. This limit is easily found via a geometrical application of the 2 nd law of thermodynamics to a radiation transfer system [A. Rabl, Sol. Energy vol. 18, pp. 93 - 111, 1976]. However, previous analysis did not include the generation of entropy in photovoltaic conversion. Here, we show a bandgap dependence of the maximal <b>concentration</b> <b>limit</b> for a semiconductor solar cell when taking this entropy generation into account, and show that the limit is reduced for low bandgap materials. This new <b>concentration</b> <b>limit</b> lies in contrast to the assumed invariance of the <b>concentration</b> <b>limit,</b> and we attribute this difference to a breakdown in the assumptions used to derive the traditional detailed-balance model.

40|$|In 1993 {{during the}} process of the German reunification East Germany raised the blood alcohol <b>concentration</b> <b>limit</b> from 0 % to 0. 08 %. Three {{roadside}} surveys were conducted to assess the short-term and long-term effects of raising the blood alcohol <b>concentration</b> <b>limit</b> (directly before the change, at 4 months, and at 16 months). Roadside breath alcohol tests were conducted to determine the frequency of drunken driving. A short roadside interview was used to assess attitudes towards driving {{under the influence of alcohol}}. Additionally, selected subjects were questioned extensively over the telephone. Overall, 21, 198 drivers were stopped and tested. By comparing an East German region in which the blood alcohol <b>concentration</b> <b>limit</b> had been raised to a West German region in which no such legal change had been enacted, the effects of different limits as well as the effect of raising the limit were analyzed. The results show that the major effect of raising the blood alcohol <b>concentration</b> <b>limit</b> is an increase in the blood alcohol concentration of drivers who are under the influence of alcohol while the number of such drivers remains constant. This effect is especially strong for young drivers, indicating that they are more vulnerable to legal changes than older drivers.
