5|$|The {{summit of}} Mount Elbert is an alpine environment, {{featuring}} {{plants such as}} Phacelia sericea (sky-pilot), Hymenoxys grandiflora (old-man-of-the-mountain), and Geum rossii (alpine avens). Also noted are Carex atrata var. pullata, Salix desertorum, Platanthera hyperborea, Thalictrum fendleri, Aquilegia canadensis, <b>Chenopodium</b> <b>album,</b> Gentiana detonsa var. hallii, and Bigelovia parryi. Below treeline the mountain is heavily forested, with the lower slopes covered {{with a mixture of}} lodgepole pine, spruce, aspen and fir.|$|E
25|$|Some seeds {{usually made}} into gruel in {{historical}} times are acorn and manna grass (Glyceria fluitans). Roots {{of the sea}} beet, Beta maritima, were prepared as well. That species is ancestral to modern domestic beets. Greens could have been boiled from nettle (Urtica dioica), orache (Atriplex) and goosefoot (<b>Chenopodium</b> <b>album).</b>|$|E
25|$|The Przewalski horse's diet {{consists}} {{mostly of}} vegetation. There are many plant species {{in a typical}} Przewalski horse environment including: Elymus repens, Carex spp., Fabaceae, and Asteraceae. While the horses eat {{a variety of different}} plant species, they tend to favor one species during a specific time of the year. In other words, the Przewalski horses have seasonal food preferences. In the springtime, Przewalski horses favor Elymus repens, Corynephorus canescens, Festuca valesiaca, and <b>Chenopodium</b> <b>album.</b> In early summer they favor Dactylis glomerata and Trifolium and in late summer, they gravitate towards Elymus repens and Vicia cracca. In winter, for example, the horses eat Salix spp., Pyrus communis, Malus sylvatica, Pinus sylvestris, Rosa spp., and Alnus spp. Additionally, Przewalski horses may dig for Festuca spp., Bromus inermis and Elymus repens that grow beneath the ice and snow. The Przewalski horse’s winter diet is very similar to the diet of domestic horses. Studies have suggested that in the wintertime, Przewalski horses experience hypodermis. Hypodermis is a condition in which one’s metabolic rate slows down. This means that in the winter time, Przewalski horse’s process their food more slowly than they do during other times of the year. Looking at the species diet overall, however, Przewalski horses most often eat Elymus repens, Trifolium pratense, Vicia cracca, Poa trivialis, Dactylis glomerata and Bromus inermis.|$|E
500|$|The {{black bean}} aphid [...] can feed {{on a wide}} variety of host plants. Its primary hosts on which the eggs overwinter are shrubs such as the spindle tree (Euonymus europaeus), Viburnum species, or the mock-orange (Philadelphus species). Its {{secondary}} hosts, on which it spends the summer, include a number of crops including [...] sugar beets, spinach, beans, runner beans, celery, potatoes, sunflowers, carrots, artichokes, tobacco, and tomatoes. It colonises more than two hundred different species of cultivated and wild plants. Among the latter, it shows a preference for poppies (Papaver species), burdock (Arctium tomentonum), fat-hen (<b>Chenopodium</b> <b>album),</b> saltbush (Atriplex rosea), chamomile (Matricaria chamomilla), thistles (Cirsium arvense), and docks (Rumex spp.).|$|E

50|$|<b>Chenopodium</b> <b>album</b> is {{vulnerable}} to leaf miners, making it a useful trap crop as a companion plant. Growing near other plants, it attracts leaf miners which might otherwise have attacked the crop to be protected. It is a host plant for the beet leafhopper, an insect which transmits curly top virus to beet crops.|$|E
5000|$|Yields are maximised when 170 to 200 kg N {{per hectare}} are available. The {{addition}} of phosphorus does not improve yield.

50|$|Allelopathic {{effects of}} Calotropis on {{different}} agricultural crops {{have been well}} studied. Extracts of plant parts such as root, stem, and leaf affect germination and seedling vigor of many agricultural crops. However, extracts of Calotropis failed to produce any detrimental effects on weeds such as <b>Chenopodium</b> <b>album,</b> Melilotus alba, Melilotus indica, Sphaeranthus indicus, and Phalaris minor.|$|E
50|$|It also infects many {{perennial}} weed species that {{can act as}} virus reservoirs for susceptible agricultural crops. These weed species include Solanum nigrum (nightshade), S. aculeatissimum (soda apple), <b>Chenopodium</b> <b>album</b> (pigweed), Datura stramonium (jimson weed), Linaria canadensis (blue toadflax), and Physalis spp. (ground cherry). Thus, recommendations for the control of this virus include the control of weeds in and around susceptible solanaceous crops.|$|E
