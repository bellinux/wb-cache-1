This paper investigates new ways to integrate piezoelectric energy harvesting elements onto carbon-fibre composite structures, using a new bonding technique with a vacuum bag system and <b>co-curing</b> process, for fabrication onto airframe structures. Dynamic mechanical vibration tests were performed to characterise the energy harvested by the various integration methods across a range of different vibration frequencies and applied mechanical input loadings. An analytical model was also introduced to predict the power harvested under the mechanical vibrations as a benchmark to evaluate the proposed methods. The developed <b>co-curing</b> showed a high efficiency for energy harvesting at a range of low frequencies, where the <b>co-curing</b> method offered a maximum improvement of 14. 3 % compared to the mechanical bonding approach at a frequency of 10 Hz. Furthermore, <b>co-curing</b> exhibited potential at high frequency by performing the sweep test between frequencies of 1 and 100 Hz.

The treated cavities were filled with a micro-hybrid resin composite (Point 4, Kerr). Following finishing and polishing procedures, the specimens were placed in 100 % humidity, stored in distilled water, thermocycled and then immersed in a methylene blue, sectioned, evaluated for microleakage and scored on a 0 to 3 ordinal scale.  Results: None of the adhesives tested were capable of completely eliminating marginal microleakage. There were statistically significant differences among the test groups at occlusal margins; but at cervical margins were not. The Fuji Bond LC with <b>co-cure</b> and control groups had significantly greater microleakage scores at the occlusal margins. At the cervical margins, the bonded restorations with OptiBond XTR and OptiBond All-in-One adhesives presented significantly lower microleakage scores.

40|$|Department of Mechanical EngineeringCarbon-Fiber-Reinforced Plastics (CFRPs) are {{composite}} materials, {{consisting of}} carbon fibers and polymeric matrices. Depending on {{the types of}} carbon fiber and polymer used, CFRP can {{have a variety of}} properties. Generally, CFRP show high specific strength and stiffness, so it is regarded as a substitute material for existing structural materials, such as metals. In addition, CFRP can have high temperature or corrosion resistance based on the type of matrix used. For this reason, despite the high price of carbon fiber, it is widely applied to the aerospace industry and has gradually expanded into the automotive industry in recent years. Despite their advantages in terms of weigh-saving, {{it is not possible to}} replace all the metal parts, especially ultra-high-strength steels, etc., with CFRPs due to their limitations in intrinsic properties. This has led to the “multi-material design” concept, in which hetero-junctions between composites and metals have become an important issue. Typical methods for multi-material joining include mechanical joining and adhesive bonding. Mechanical joining, e. g., riveting, mechanical fastening, etc., leads to high stress concentration due to the pre-drilled holes, and it has to bear additional weight of inserts, such as bolts and rivets. Adhesive bonding, on the other hand, requires time of adhesive curing in addition to matrix curing, which has detrimental effects on manufacturing time and costs. To overcome these drawbacks, the <b>co-curing</b> method, in which the infused resin serves as the adhesive and therefore, the additional adhesive curing time can be omitted, has been considered as an alternative cost-effective adhesive joining method. Although multi-material joining using the <b>co-curing</b> method results in a lower adhesive strength than adhesive-bonded joints, this method can reduce the curing time since adhesive and CFRP curing proceed simultaneously and makes possible real-time health monitoring of the joints using electrical resistance measurement because carbon fiber directly contacts the metal surface, both of which are electrically conductive. In this study, we showed that structural health monitoring using electrical resistance measurement at the junction between metals and CFRPs joined by <b>co-curing</b> is feasible, and its effectiveness was studied as compared to the case where a conductive epoxy was used as the adhesive. Also, we measured the adhesive strength and determined the possibility of failure detection when a steel bushing, which is one of metal inserts, was joined by <b>co-curing</b> with CFRP. In addition, the interfacial strength between metal and polymer resin was enhanced by atmospheric plasma surface treatment since aluminum-CFRP co-cured joints initially had poor lap shear strength. CFRP was fabricated by plain-woven carbon fibers and unsaturated polyester resin, and stainless steel and aluminum sheets were used as the metals for multi-material joining. To detect the failure at the junction between CFRP and metal, <b>co-curing</b> was adopted rather than an epoxy adhesive containing dispersed carbon nanotubes (CNTs). In the <b>co-curing</b> process, conductive carbon fiber and metals directly contacted each other, so electric current can flow through both materials. As the initial load increased, the resistance gradually decreased, and then increased drastically due to de-bonding at the co-cured joints. Electrical resistance was increased when the contact area between carbon fiber and metal surface were decreased, so it can monitor the failure detection at the multi-material joints. Single-lap shear test was performed for each joint, and four-wire Kelvin resistance measurement was adopted to measure the change in resistance during the test. To apply this research, we manufactured steel bushing-inserted CFRPs joined by <b>co-curing</b> method. Push-out tests were performed to measure the adhesive strength between the inserts and CFRPs. Next, we demonstrated the proof-of-concept of health monitoring at the co-cured joints between steel bushings and CFRPs using electrical resistance measurements. In the case of aluminum-CFRP co-cured joints, the adhesive strength was about 30...|$|E

40|$|Composite {{materials}} are widely appreciated by the engineers for aerospace applications {{because of their}} property tailorability, high specific strength, high specific stiffness, less weight and many other advantages. Various technologies are used worldwide for fabrication of these composite structures. One of such {{state of the art}} technologies is <b>co-curing,</b> where the primary structure is co-cured along with the secondary structure by eliminating the fasteners and allowing many other benefits of <b>co-curing.</b> The integral structure realized through <b>co-curing</b> approach will result in cost benefits by reducing the part count, fasteners and assembly time. Such type of fabrication is adopted in transport aircraft wing and empennage structures where the substructure members like spars, ribs etc are co-cured with the skin forming co-cured joints. When such joints are present in wing structures they are subjected to direct or in-direct out-of-plane loads caused by pressure generated due to the presence of fuel. The behavior and the strength of these joints under out-of- plane loads are of concern and has been the topic of many analytical and experimental studies. However, only limited information is available in the open literature. For the present study a typical transport aircraft wing, which is made of composites and fabricated using <b>co-curing</b> technology, is considered. The co-cured wing structure with internal fuel pressure imparting out-of-plane loads on joints are addressed in this paper. The joint strength assessment through feature level test by introducing the same level of defect concentration on such joints would be time consuming and expensive. On the other hand Finite Element (FE) analysis using suitable commercial software with appropriate model of the joint would provide a substantial understanding on the strength of the joint. In the present paper attempts are made to understand the structural behavior of typical co-cured composite joints subjected to pull-off load, in presence and absence of a typical manufacturing defect. The authors demonstrate here the approach to predict the failure strength of co-cured joints under contemplation analytically using a polynomial invariant based three dimensional failure theory. The paper explains the methodology established for predicting failure strength under pull-off load which is a first step towards certification of co-cured joints with and without manufacturing defects. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} use of {{composite materials}} in the aerospace industry has driven {{a need for a}} greater understanding of bonded composite joints. There are generally two types of composite joint used in the aerospace industry; secondary bonded joints and cocured joints. Secondary bonded joints are produced by bonding two cured composite laminates together with an adhesive. However, when composites and adhesives are used to manufacture large parts in the aerospace industry, it is often convenient to co-cure the two materials at the same time. This helps to reduce the high costs associated with autoclave curing and also to reduce processing time. However, despite the apparent advantages, <b>co-curing</b> is not without its drawbacks. Any moisture stored in the composite material prior to <b>co-curing</b> is released during the cure cycle and has a negative effect on the joint. This can also result in interfacial failure. A way around this problem is to either dry the composite material prior to curing or to engineer the composite surface using a variety of surface treatments to promote adhesion, such as an atmospheric pressure plasma treatment [1]. The former option will be investigated in this work. The effects of moisture on the fracture performance of secondary bonded composite joints is well publicised. Moisture can be introduced into the composite laminate prior to [2] or after [3] secondary bonding. The moisture can plasticize the adhesive and reduce the glass transition temperature of the adhesive [4]. However, compared to secondary bonded joints, relatively little work has been carried out on co-cured joints. In the present work, the effect of the level of moisture in the composite prepreg prior to <b>co-curing</b> will be examined...|$|E

40|$|Addition cure (X 1 - 2672) and {{condensation}} cure (4 - 3136) silicone resins {{have been}} studied for their mechanical property change with temperature. Properties include maximum flexural stress, flexural modulus and fracture toughness K[sub]IC. Temperature effect on mechanical properties of addition cure resin is substantial and also depends on the crosslinkers used. Generally the maximum stress and flexural modulus decrease with temperature, and the dependence upon crosslinkers in addition cure resin is obvious. Fracture toughness data of addition cure silicone resins have a peaking behavior with the peak appearing [approximately] 58 - 101 CÌ (depending on the crosslinker) below their glass transition temperatures. This {{can be explained by}} the competing effect between network mobility and rigidity of the silicone polymer. Rate effect on fracture toughness of silylphenylene crosslinked 2672 has also been studied. It is concluded that the temperature effect on such a system is more dominant compared to the rate effect. The condensation resins also experience decrease in modulus and strength but the toughness changes little with temperature. This is due to its tight network structure. Silylphenylene crosslinked addition cure resin (2672 B) and the toughened condensation cure resin (3136 T) were used to make silicone fiberglass laminates. They have been successfully processed with a vacuum bagging technique. Silicone resin composites are proved to be thermally stable, moisture resistant and fire resistant. However, they have weak strength and modulus. Their temperature dependence of mechanical properties is also big and results in poor property retention at high temperatures. 2672 B was used to produce hybrid composites with an organic resin-vinyl ester. The processes of curing the hybrid composites in both sequential cure and <b>co-cure</b> methods prove to be successful. The hybrid composites are stronger and their property retention at elevated temperatures is improved compared to silicone resin composites. They also have improved moisture resistance, thermal stability and fire resistance over vinyl ester composites. The co-cured V/B 8 / 4 structure has excellent strength and rigidity and also extraordinary property retention at high temperatures, which {{can be explained by the}} chemical reaction at the silicone resin and vinyl ester resin interface. The hybrid composites prove to be successful in having balanced mechanical and environmental properties. by Yuhong Wu. Thesis (Ph. D.)

Postbuckling failure {{behaviors}} and strength were investigated in compression {{tests of the}} hat stiffened composite panels manufactured with different bonding methods and different stiffener section shapes. The skin-stiffener separation loads, separation failure {{behaviors and}} final collapse loads were different with respect to bonding methods and stiffener shapes. As the separation failure was initiated early and propagated larger area, collapse loads and structural performance of the panels decreased.

40|$|The centre {{fuselage}} has {{a complex}} geometry with doubly curved surfaces. This presents a greater {{challenge in the}} realization of airworthy composite components. The mouldability of composites is exploited to produce composite tools, which capture the complex geometry. The stiffened composite parts on these composite tools are made by <b>co-curing</b> technology involving the bonding of stiffeners to the skin in a single operation. These stiffeners on contoured components need to be aligned vertically with the required spacing. Most of these parts have non-developable surfaces, which are not amenable for lay-up with computer generated transfer foils. The lay-up is done using prepregs pf smaller width, {{which is similar to}} tow placement, to facilitate the lay-up. The heart of <b>co-curing</b> technology lies in the design and fabrication of tooling. The tools should have precise contour and dimensional stability. NAL has adopted a unique philosophy in the tooling technology based on the experience of cocuring such components. The lay-up tools of stiffeners are stiff so that they maintain the required contour and alignment. The curing tools are different from layup tools and are flexible enough to achieve the required compaction of the web of stiffener. This concept allows the uniform application of autoclave pressure on webs of stiffeners and skin. The stiffeners and joint configurations vary from part to part. Some of the parts have stiffeners running orthogonal to each other and both are continuous at their junctions. The <b>co-curing</b> technique has to be suitably modified to redesign the layup and curing tools. Some of the parts have a Y joint, which allows the integration of floor of fuel tank without a mechanical joint in that region avoiding fuel leakage through joints. This is achieved by an innovative design using assembly of external moulds during lay-up. One of the parts has stiffeners, which are curved in height and curved in length to follow spine contour. The tools are fabricated to suit the contour and the required stiffener spacing. The technology to produce these complex composite components is developed over a period of time. The tools required for the layup at critical areas like bermuda triangle, assembly of cores on skin and fixtures for curing etc. are developed to facilitate faster and controlled production.

40|$|A newly {{developed}} method for the edge-selective functionalization of "pristine" graphite with 4 -aminobenzoic acid {{was applied for}} the synthesis of 4 -aminobenzoyl-functionalized graphite (AB-graphite) through a "direct" Friedel-Crafts acylation in a polyphosphoric acid (PPA) /phosphorus pentoxide medium (P(2) O(5)). The AB moiety {{at the edge of}} the AB-graphite played the role of a molecular wedge to exfoliate the AB-graphite into individual graphene and graphene-like platelets upon dispersion in polar solvents. These were used as a <b>co-curing</b> agent and a nanoscale additive to epoxy resin. The physical properties of the resulting epoxy/AB-graphite composites were improved because of the efficient load transfer between the additive and epoxy matrix through covalent links. close 191...|$|E
