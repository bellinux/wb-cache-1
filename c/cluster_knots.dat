40|$|We {{develop an}} {{analysis}} of sharp and fuzzy RD designs, based on a new approach for non-parametrically estimating the unknown functions of the forcing variable and, {{in the case of}} the fuzzy design, a new modeling of the unobserved confounder. Several novel ideas are employed. First, in estimating the functions of the forcing variable, we include a knot at the threshold, which is not in general an observed value of the forcing variable, to al-low for curvature in the estimated functions from the breakpoint to the nearest values on either side of the breakpoint. Second, we <b>cluster</b> <b>knots</b> close to the threshold with the aim of controlling the approximation bias. Third, we introduce a new second-difference prior on the spline coefficients that can deal with unequally spaced knots. The number of knots and other features of the model are compared through marginal likelihoods and Bayes factors. Fourth, in the fuzzy case, instead of assuming that the confounder is continuous, as in the models to date, we suppose that the confounder is a discrete random variable that represents one of three exogenous subject-types, compliers, never-takers and always-takers. We show that under certain mild conditions, the effect of the forcing variable on the mean outcome...|$|E

For a single colloidal particle, we observe that a single defect loop is winding around the particle, with the winding pattern being more complex in cells with higher total twist. We observe that colloidal dimers and colloidal clusters are always entangled by one or several - 1 / 2 defect loops. For colloidal pairs in π-twisted cells, we identify at least 17 different entangled structures, some of them exhibiting linked defect loops-Hopf link.

40|$|Access {{restricted}} to the OSU CommunityA three-dimensional finite element model was used to predict the strength and location of failure of nine wood transmission poles. The poles were made from three commonlyused species (western redcedar, Douglas-fir and southern pine) in North America. All poles were tested to failure as a cantilever beam with a concentrated load applied to the tip. The methodology involved was to select several eighteen inches long segments, located along the poles, which contained the most severe defects such as <b>cluster</b> of <b>knots,</b> spiral grain, including material inhomogeneity in the highly stressed region. Each segment was analyzed using the finite element technique with appropriate boundary conditions. Material properties for each segment were determined by measuring clear-wood elastic and strength parameters in boles taken from broken poles. The information about knots and spiral grain, obtained by visual inspection of the pole surface, was used to identify the worst <b>knot</b> <b>clusters</b> and grain deviation in any segment. Knots were modeled in the finite element mesh and the localized grain deviation around the knots were determined {{through the use of}} the flow-grain analogy model. Finite element computer analysis were performed through the use of the program GTSTRUDL. The model resulted in a total of 288 three-dimensional, isoparametric, linear strain, 20 -node parallelepiped and 15 -node wedge shaped elements. For the nine poles studied, the results showed good agreement between predicted and experimental strength. The predicted values for strength differed from the actual ones with an average deviation of 7 % (below the actual). Concerning failure location, in six of the poles, failure was verified in the same places as those predicted by the model. In the three other cases the failure with the maximum error of three feet, except for one pole where the deviation was twelve feet.

The cluster has a bright X-ray core and a central temperature gradient that declines inward from 2. 7 keV at 130 kpc to ≈ 1. 6 keV at the cluster center. The radiative cooling time of the gas in the inner 10 kpc is about 0. 5 Gyr, and rises to 1 Gyr at a radius of 20 kpc. The cooling rate of the gas within the latter radius is < ∼ 25 M ⊙ yr − 1.

Since extreme GPs are associated with both candidate and confirmed Lyman continuum (LyC) emitters, Mrk 71 /NGC 2366 is thus also {{a good candidate for}} LyC escape.

This joins the ranks of other cooling flow clusters with Chandra-detected bubbles blown by central radio sources. This source is different than the other well-known cases, in that the radio source is orders of magnitude less luminous and has produced a much smaller bubble.

However, they play a different role in building the gel, depending on their particle numbers in the milk system. The present study was set to evaluate the role of whey protein aggregates and casein micelles by means of changing their ratio in model milk systems. Whey protein aggregates (WPIA) were generated from a whey protein isolate upon controlled heating conditions. Mixtures of Native Micellar Casein (NMC) and WPIA were suspended in a milk permeate at different weight ratios ranging from 0 % to 100 % NMC. The total protein concentration was set constant to 45 g/kg. Acidification was performed at 35 °C by addition of glucono- -lactone (GDL) {{to achieve the same}} final pH of 4. 5 in 6 h. Acid-induced gelation of these systems was followed using small deformation rheology as function of pH followed by large deformation test at pH 4. 5. Final gels were characterized by texture analysis and whey retention, while their microstructure was investigated using confocal scanning laser microscopy (CSLM) and transmission electron microscopy. The results from this study confirmed that systems with different numbers of each type of protein particles behaved differently during the acid gelation. Increasing the content in WPIA led to an increase in their pH of gelation and final elastic modulus (G’) and a decrease in tan. CSLM shows that increasing WPIA content produced a gel structure with smaller pores which led to a firmer gel as showed by the texture measurements. Furthermore, a more firm gel bound more whey which led to higher whey retention. The results are discussed in terms of interaction between the WPIA and the casein micelles, possibly creating dense <b>clusters</b> or <b>knots</b> in the finer WPIA network...|$|R

40|$|Part 2 : Full PapersInternational audienceThe knot {{model is}} aimed at obtaining a trust-based {{reputation}} in communities of strangers. It identifies groups of trustees, denoted as knots and among whom overall trust is strong, and is thus considered the most capable solution for providing reputation information to other members within the same knot. The problem of identifying knots in a trust network is modeled as a graph clustering problem. When considering dynamic and large-scale communities, the task of keeping the clustering correct over time is a great challenge. This paper introduces a clustering maintenance algorithm based on the properties of knots of trust. A maintenance strategy is defined that addresses violations of knot properties due to changes in trust relations that occur with time {{in response to the}} dynamic nature of the community. Based on this strategy, a reputation management procedure is implemented in two phases: the first identifies the essence of change and makes a decision regarding the need to improve <b>knot</b> <b>clustering.</b> The second phase locally modifies the clustering to preserve a stable network structure while keeping the network correctly clustered with respect to the knot utility function.

40|$|We {{present a}} new and very {{concrete}} connection between <b>cluster</b> algebras and <b>knot</b> theory. This connection is being made via continued fractions and snake graphs. It is known that the class of 2 -bridge knots and links is parametrized by continued fractions, and it has recently been shown that one can associate to each continued fraction a snake graph, and hence a cluster variable in a cluster algebra. We show that up to normalization by the leading term the Jones polynomial of the 2 -bridge link {{is equal to the}} specialization of this cluster variable obtained by setting all initial cluster variables to 1 and specializing the initial principal coefficients of the cluster algebra as follows $y_ 1 =t^{- 2 }$ and $ y_i=-t^{- 1 }$, for all $i> 1 $. As a consequence we obtain a direct formula for the Jones polynomial of a 2 -bridge link as the numerator of a continued fraction of Laurent polynomials in $q=-t^{- 1 }$. We also obtain formulas for the degree and the width of the Jones polynomial, {{as well as for the}} first three and the last three coefficients. Along the way, we also develop some basic facts about even continued fractions and construct their snake graphs. We show that the snake graph of an even continued fraction is ismorphic to the snake graph of a positive continued fraction if the continued fractions have the same value. We also give recursive formulas for the Jones polynomials. Comment: 35 pages, 12 Figures, v 2 minor change...|$|R
40|$|Using drift scan data, a new {{approach}} to determining surface brightness profiles, and techniques for detecting low surface brightness signals, we fit the light profile of the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) in the rich cluster Abell 1651 out to 670 h^{- 1 } kpc. This radius is a significant fraction of the virial radius of the cluster (2 h^{- 1 } Mpc; Girardi et al. 1998), indicating that the sizes of the BCG and the cluster are comparable. We find that the profile is consistent with a de Vaucouleurs profile over the radial range probed. We also find that the integrated light profile of the BCG in Abell 1651 contributes 36 % of the total cluster light within 500 h^{- 1 } kpc. Including all luminous components, we obtain M/L_I~ 160 h for the cluster, which would be overestimated by ~ 20 % without the BCG halo. Furthermore, the relatively red color of the BCG at large radii suggests that recent disruption and tidal stripping of spirals and dwarf ellipticals do not contribute significantly to the halo luminosity. The color and the form of the profile are consistent with a scenario in which the BCG forms from filamentary collapse during the epoch of cluster formation, with relatively little evolution in the past 5 Gyrs (Dubinski 1998). We remove the BCG and other detected galaxies from the image and construct a two dimensional surface brightness map of the <b>cluster</b> core.

Although J 1023 + 1952 spatially overlaps {{the edge of the}} disk of NGC 3227, it has a mean HI velocity 150 km/s higher than that of NGC 3227 so is kinematically distinct; comparison of ionized and neutral gas kinematics in the star-forming region show closely matched velocities, providing strong evidence that the knots are embedded in J 1023 + 1952 and do not merely lie behind in the disk of NGC 3227, thus confirming J 1023 + 1952 as a gas-rich dwarf galaxy. We discuss two scenarios for the origin of J 1023 + 1952; as a third, pre-existing dwarf galaxy involved in the interaction with NGC 3227 and NGC 3226, or a newly-forming dwarf galaxy condensing out of the tidal debris removed from the gaseous disk of NGC 3227. Given the lack of a detectable old stellar population, a tidal origin is more likely.

40|$|Considering {{the various}} {{mathematical}} ideas we’ve been exploring briefly, how might these differ in textiles from ancient Peru? In the ancient textiles that I study, Andean {{people seem to}} have made conscious use of the math embedded in textile processes for generating several kinds of graphic codes. You may have heard about a device called the khipu: it {{is a bunch of}} colored and knotted cords that looks like a string mop, but it is really an ancient record-keeping device. The knots stand for numbers in the base 10 system. Long knots were used for numbers from 2 to 9, while <b>clusters</b> of single <b>knots</b> stood for the 10 ’s, 100 ’s, and 1000 ’s. The colors of cords were likely used for categories of things, and the direction of the twist for another kind of distinction. Although no one can read a khipu, we {{have a pretty good idea}} of how the fiber qualities and structures mathematically encoded information such as census figures or quantities of goods collected through taxation during the Inka period, c. 1500 A. D. Two thousand years ago, people on the South Coast of Peru were embroidering mantles that look something like khipus. Some Linear-style mantles from the site of Paracas Necropolis have many parallel bands with reverse-curve snakes repeated within them. The snake-like patterns usually alternate three colors, and look like three-ply cords. In an example from the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (1972. 353), all of the band patterns twist in the same direction, except for one. The number of colors and bands, and the twist direction, are no doubt significant, as they vary from mantle to mantle in this style. It is fairly clear that fiber structures were used as a model for some visual codes that we see on Andean textiles in different periods – particularly those patterns that have a geometric appearance. Headbands from the mummy bundles excavated at the site of Paracas Necropolis sometimes look like cords made of five plied elements. Other headbands from different bundles show from two to eight plied elements in their patterns. Cord patterns are not the only fiber structures that occur. Braid structures made with three, four, or eight ends also occur as patterns on the headbands...|$|R
