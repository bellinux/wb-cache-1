40|$|Aim of this diploma {{thesis is}} to make {{sensitivity}} research concerning influence of <b>vehicle</b> <b>body</b> position on its aerodynamical loading. CAD model was created in Pro/E software. Formula Ford 1600 <b>chassis</b> and <b>vehicle</b> <b>body</b> dimensions were used as a pattern for CAD model. Then this model was imported into CFD environment where ambient medium characteristic were set up. FLUENT software performed calculations and measurement of aerodynamical characteristics of vehicle dependent on height and angle of chassis...|$|R
50|$|Active {{suspension}} {{is a type}} {{of automotive}} suspension that controls the vertical movement of the wheels relative to the <b>chassis</b> or <b>vehicle</b> <b>body</b> with an onboard system, rather than in passive suspension where the movement is being determined entirely by the road surface; see Skyhook theory.Active suspensions can be generally divided into two classes: pure active suspensions, and adaptive/semi-active suspensions. While adaptive suspensions only vary shock absorber firmness to match changing road or dynamic conditions, active suspensions use some type of actuator to raise and lower the chassis independently at each wheel.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} the three {{dimensional}} dynamic analysis of vehicle motions is presented {{on the basis}} of the finite element method, therefore the distribution of elasticity and mass of the <b>chassis</b> and <b>vehicle</b> <b>body</b> is taken into account accurately. The mode superposition method is improved on the description of large horizontal displacements (in longitudinal and lateral directions), while the effects of dampers and other structural elements with non-linear characteristics are considered by the pseudoforce method. Shear forces arising between road surface and tyres are determined by the cosine version of magic formula tyre model. Examples, relating to cornering and braking, are presented by the use of a bus finite element model containing 2294 degrees of freedom...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, an {{improved}} FRF-based substructure synthesis method combined with power flow analysis is presented {{and is used}} for performing a vehicle axle noise analysis. The major transfer paths of axle noise transmitted from <b>chassis</b> to <b>vehicle</b> <b>body</b> are identified and ranked based on power flows transmitted through bushings between the chassis and body. To calculate the power flows, {{it is necessary to}} know the reaction forces and the vibrations at the bushing locations on the body side. To this end, the body is represented in terms of experimentally derived frequency response functions (FRF's) at the bushing locations, and the FRF's are coupled with the FEA model of the chassis for performing a total system dynamic analysis. This paper also describes how the FRF's of the <b>vehicle</b> <b>body</b> and the frequency dependent stiffness data of the bushings can be combined together with a simple formulation to better represent the dynamic characteristics of a full vehicle. A classical example is used to illustrates the concept of the method, and the method is then applied to a vehicle axle noise analysis with detailed procedure. The theoretical predictions are compared with experimentally measured results. Good correlation has been obtained...|$|R
50|$|This is {{a method}} that is only usable on body-on-frame design found in some pickup trucks and some SUVs. A body lift is {{performed}} by placed spacers in between the normal mounting points of the <b>vehicle's</b> <b>chassis</b> and <b>body.</b> These typically are between 1-4 inches. When a body lift is installed on a vehicle it is very common for linkages and other components on the vehicle to need drop brackets to function properly after the lift.

50|$|This was {{designed}} because Lincoln executives {{were concerned about}} the large heavy doors on the Mark VIII and wanted to improve them, especially for cities with tight parking spaces. They had the idea of a Mark VIII that had doors that disappeared beneath the car and would require no additional space outside the car's wheelbase for the doors to open in order to allow people to enter or exit. At this time it was usual for the large car manufacturers to sub-contract their concepts to other companies who specialized in making concepts reality. In this case, this Mark VIII was sent to Joalto near Detroit. Joalto still holds many US Patents for with this <b>vehicle's</b> <b>chassis</b> and <b>body</b> construction.|$|R

The analysis of that motion, particularly displacements towards the vehicle interior have significant practical aspect as it facilitates conclusions concerning the mechanisms of danger and injury formation.

30|$|The heights at {{four corners}} of the <b>vehicle</b> <b>body</b> are {{adjusted}} by controlling the air mass flow rates flowing into or flowing out of the air springs for an EAS system. During off-road driving condition, the EAS system can lift the <b>vehicle</b> <b>body</b> to prevent the suspension from hitting the position limiter [10], while for driving on an expressway with high speed, the air drag can be reduced and the driving safety can be enhanced by lowering the <b>vehicle</b> <b>body.</b> Meanwhile, in order to prevent the phenomenon of vehicle posture instability, i.e., the peak values of the roll and pitch angles of the <b>vehicle</b> <b>body</b> are too large, which is mainly caused by the different payloads at four corners and the system parameters difference between the front and rear air suspensions, the effective control of the vehicle leveling is also very essential for the EAS system dynamic performance [11].|$|R

30|$|Mining {{vehicles}} {{are an important}} underground device for the transportation of minerals and staff. Recently, higher requirements on their isolation vibration performance have been demanded. However, the <b>vehicle</b> <b>body</b> often experiences continuous and excessive vibrations owing to harsh working conditions. This can lead to discomfort and seriously affect the {{physical and mental health}} of staff [1]. Moreover, the long longitudinal distance between the axles and large load change in mining vehicles can aggravate the <b>vehicle</b> <b>body</b> pitch motion under continuous upslope and downslope roads in the mines. The severe pitch motion is the primary source of the longitudinal vibration to be experienced at points above the center of gravity (CG) of the <b>vehicle</b> <b>body.</b> Simultaneously, it intensifies the load transfer between the front and rear wheels, resulting in a safety accident. To improve the carrying capacity and reduce the maintenance cost, leaf spring suspension has been used as the typical suspension system for mining vehicles, but it cannot effectively suppress the <b>vehicle</b> <b>body</b> vibration.|$|R
