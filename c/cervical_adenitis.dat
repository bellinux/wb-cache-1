40|$|Introduction. Tuberculous lymphadenitis, which {{currently}} {{is most often}} caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, was once mainly caused by Mycobacterium bovis. Objective. To describe an unusual case of tuberculous adenitis from Mycobacterium bovis. Case report. A woman {{with a history of}} consuming raw milk and unsupervised dairy home-made products presents with <b>cervical</b> <b>adenitis</b> of 5 month course unassociated to other symptoms. A diagnosis of Mycobacterium bovis tuberculous adenitis was made by biopsy, ELISA, PCR and culture. Discussion. Approximately 11 to 25 % of all TB cases are extrapulmonary exclusively. Cervical lymphadenitis is the most common presentation of peripheral disease. Treatment usually is based on four drugs. Surgery is indicated for diagnostic procedures and complications. Conclusion.

40|$|Aims: To {{define the}} rote of medical or {{surgical}} treatment {{in patients with}} periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and <b>cervical</b> <b>adenitis</b> (PFAPA syndrome). Methods: A Medline search was performed using the terms PFAPA, periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, <b>cervical</b> <b>adenitis,</b> treatment. A systematic review of the English literature was performed. Papers on pyrexia of unknown origin in the pediatric population were excluded; this was because the clinical entities included in the differential diagnosis of pyrexia of unknown origin share many clinical characteristics with PFAPA, and may be ill defined. Results: Twenty-seven papers have been published since 1989, of which 20 were in English language. There were five single case reports and two papers involving two patients each. There were 6 retrospective reviews of case notes, involving 5 - 94 patients over a 3 - 10 year review period. Given that current evidence {{on the effectiveness of}} tonsillectomy in PFAPA is extremely weak (level of evidence V), tonsillectomy should not be performed. Conclusions: PFAPA usually resolves without any long-term adverse effect, and as such, there is no rote for tonsillectomy in these patients. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|The {{pediatric}} syndrome {{characterized by}} periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and <b>cervical</b> <b>adenitis</b> (PFAPA) and adult Beh double dagger et's disease share some clinical manifestations and are both polygenic autoinflammatory disorders with interleukin- 1 beta showing {{to play a}} pivotal role. However, the diagnosis is mostly clinical and we hypothesize that specific criteria may be addressed differently by different physicians. To determine the diagnostic variability, we compared the answers of 80 patients with a definite diagnosis of Beh double dagger et's disease (age 42. 1 +/- 13. 7 years) obtained by separate telephone interviews conducted by a rheumatologist, a pediatrician, and an internist working largely {{in the field of}} autoinflammatory disorders. Questions were related to the age of symptom onset, the occurrence of recurrent fevers during childhood, and the association with oral aphthosis, <b>cervical</b> <b>adenitis</b> and/or pharyngitis, previous treatments, possible growth impairment, the time lapse between PFAPA-like symptoms and the onset of Beh double dagger et's disease, and the occurrence of Beh double dagger et-related manifestation during childhood. The rheumatologist identified 30 % of patients with Beh double dagger et's disease fulfilling PFAPA syndrome diagnostic criteria, compared to the pediatrician and the internist identifying 10 and 7. 5 %, respectively. Most of the patients suffered from recurrent oral aphthosis in childhood also without fever (50, 39, and 48 % with each interviewer), yet no patient fulfilled the Beh double dagger et's disease diagnostic criteria.

The aims of {{this study}} were to {{describe}} the clinical features of periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis and <b>cervical</b> <b>adenitis</b> (PFAPA) and identify distinct phenotypes in a large cohort of patients from different countries. Methods. We established a web-based multicentre cohort through an international collaboration within the periodic fevers working party of the Pediatric Rheumatology European Society (PReS). The inclusion criterion was a diagnosis of PFAPA given by an experienced paediatric rheumatologist participating in an international working group on periodic fever syndromes. Results. Of the 301 patients included from the 15 centres, 271 had pharyngitis, 236 <b>cervical</b> <b>adenitis,</b> 171 oral aphthosis and 132 with all three clinical features. A total of 228 patients presented with additional symptoms (131 gastrointestinal symptoms, 86 arthralgias and/or myalgias, 36 skin rashes, 8 neurological symptoms). Thirty-one patients had disease onset after 5 years and they reported more additional symptoms. A positive family history for recurrent fever or recurrent tonsillitis was found in 81 patients (26. 9 %). Genetic testing for monogenic periodic fever syndromes was performed on 111 patients, who reported fewer occurrences of oral aphthosis or additional symptoms. Twenty-four patients reported symptoms (oral aphthosis and malaise) outside the flares. The CRP was > 50 mg/l in the majority (131 / 190) of the patients tested during the fever. Conclusion.

This suggested that the pneumococci may enter the body through the mucosa of the nose, pass to the lymphatics and so into the blood, and that the pneumonia may be secondary to a bacteremia.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: We {{sought to}} {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of the auramine orange (AO) stain in diagnosing mycobacterial <b>cervical</b> <b>adenitis</b> (MCA) from fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytology. METHODS: A retrospective review of 19 patients evaluated at 2 urban hospitals from 2000 to 2003 for suspected MCA. FNA specimens were inoculated to culture media and had direct smears stained by the auramine acid fast method. RESULTS: Mycobacteria were identified in 16 (84. 2 %) of 19 AO-stained FNA specimens, with results available within 4 hours. Corresponding cultures were positive for mycobacteria in 12 spec-imens, 9 tuberculous and 3 nontuberculous, and grew Mycobacte-rium tuberculosis from the 3 AO-negative specimens. Three of the 4 patients with negative cultures had previously taken anti-myco-bacterial medications.

40|$|PFAPA {{syndrome}} {{represents the}} most common cause of recurrent fever in children in European populations, and it is characterized by recurrent episodes of high fever, pharyngitis, <b>cervical</b> <b>adenitis,</b> and aphthous stomatitis. Many possible causative factors have been explored so far, including infectious agents, immunologic mechanisms and genetic predisposition, but the exact etiology remains unclear. Recent findings demonstrate a dysregulation of different components of innate immunity during PFAPA flares, such as monocytes, neutrophils, complement, and pro-inflammatory cytokines, especially IL- 1 β, suggesting an inflammasome-mediated innate immune system activation and supporting the hypothesis of an autoinflammatory disease. Moreover, in contrast with previous considerations, the strong familial clustering suggests a potential genetic origin rather than a sporadic disease. In addition, the presence of variants in inflammasome-related genes, mostly in NLRP 3 and MEFV, suggests a possible role of inflammasome-composing genes in PFAPA pathogenesis. However, none of these variants seem to be relevant, alone, to its etiology, indicating a high genetic heterogeneity as well as an oligogenic or polygenic genetic background...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Mycobacterium malmoense is a nontuberculous {{mycobacteria}} seen {{mainly in}} two age groups and with different clinical presentations. Most patients are male adults presenting clinical symptoms and signs {{similar to those}} of pulmonary tuberculosis. The second group is formed by immunocompetent children with localized cervical lymphadenitis. Although <b>cervical</b> <b>adenitis</b> is the main extrapulmonary manifestation of M. malmoense, virtually all cases of cervical disease were documented in children. Disseminated disease is rare and has been reported in patients with severely impaired immunity. CASE REPORT: We report a case of a 47 -year-old immunocompetent man with a cervical abscess, in whom we identified a M. malmoense pulmonary disease with multiple cervical, thoracic and abdominal adenopathies. CONCLUSION: Extrapulmonary infection due to M.

Normal or infected recipients of fraction I + II + III from the plasma of tuberculin-sensitive donors manifested edematous responses to tuberculopolysaccharide, maximal at 4 to 6 hours, as reported.
