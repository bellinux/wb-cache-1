25|$|IGCC also consumes {{less water}} than {{traditional}} pulverized coal plants. In a pulverized coal plant, coal is burned to produce steam, {{which is then}} used to create electricity using a steam turbine. Then steam exhaust must then be condensed with cooling water, and water is lost by evaporation. In IGCC, water consumption is reduced by combustion in a gas turbine, which uses the generated heat to expand air and drive the turbine. Steam is only used to capture {{the heat from the}} <b>combustion</b> <b>turbine</b> exhaust for use in a secondary steam turbine. Currently, the major drawback is the high capital cost compared to other forms of power production.|$|E

2500|$|Much of {{the energy}} for the MIT campus comes from a Central Utilities Plant (Building 42).

MIT plans to replace the existing turbine, which is {{nearing the end of}} its useful life, with two new 22 megawatt units by 2020. Since the cogeneration plant came on line in 1995, MIT estimates it has used one third less fuel than it would have using conventional sources for electricity and steam. The plant is also capable of powering portions of the campus in an emergency.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY: This action proposes {{national}} {{emission standards}} for {{hazardous air pollutants}} (NESHAP) for stationary <b>combustion</b> <b>turbines.</b> We have identified stationary <b>combustion</b> <b>turbines</b> as major sources of hazardous air pollutants (HAP) emissions such as formaldehyde, toluene, benzene, and acetaldehyde. The proposed NESHAP would implement section 112 (d) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) by requiring all major sources to meet HAP emission standards reflecting {{the application of the}} maximum achievable control technology (MACT) for <b>combustion</b> <b>turbines.</b> We estimate that 20 percent of the stationary <b>combustion</b> <b>turbines</b> affected by the proposed rule will be located at major sources. As a result, the environmental, energy, and economic impacts presented in this preamble reflect these estimates. The proposed standards would protect public health by reducing exposure to air pollution, by reducing total national HAP emissions by an estimated 81 tons/year in the 5 th year after the standards are promulgated. This action also proposes to add Method 323 of 40 CFR part 63, appendix A for the measurement of formaldehyde emissions from natural gas-fired stationary sources. DATES: Comments.
