Digital created the AltaVista search engine, the Internet firewall, the Web portal, the webcast and live election returns. Digital continued its lead in Internet and Web development through difficult times, but Kotok questioned a <b>corporate</b> <b>strategy</b> that he believed consumed Web and Internet resources to sell Digital products like the AlphaServer. For example, he saw a missed opportunity in Millicent, the micropayment system for buying and selling Web content for fractions of a U.S. cent.|$|E

5|$|Strategic design {{management}} involves {{the creation of}} strategic long-term vision and planning for design, and deals with defining the role of design within the company. The goal of strategic {{design management}} is to support and strengthen the corporate visio by creating {{a relationship between the}} design and <b>corporate</b> <b>strategy.</b> It includes the creation of design, brand and product strategies, ensuring that design management becomes a central element in the <b>corporate</b> <b>strategy</b> formulation process. Strategic design management is responsible for {{the development and implementation of}} a corporate design programme that influences the design vision, mission, and positioning. It allows design to interact with the needs of corporate management and focuses on the long-term capabilities of design. Where strategic design management is applied, there is often a strong belief in the potential to differentiate the company and gain competitive advantage by design. As a result, design thinking becomes integrated into the corporate culture. Depending on the type of company and industry the following job titles are associated with this function: design strategist, strategic design manager, chief design officer, vice president design and innovation, chief creative officer, innovation design director, and others.|$|E

5|$|In September 1999, SAS {{announced}} that if Braathens {{took the first}} step to reduce capacity between Bergen and Oslo, they would follow immediately to reduce the overcapacity in the combined 37 daily departures. However, Braathens was not willing to reduce. On 15 September, Color Air {{announced that}} they would start flying five round trips from Oslo to Stavanger on 1 October, following the delivery of their fourth aircraft. At the same time, the airline would reduce the number of round trips to Ålesund from four to two. In January 1999, Braathens applied to register twenty of its Norwegian aircraft in Sweden, following their discovery that foreign-registered aircraft, such as Color Air's and SAS', did not have to pay value added tax on good sold on board. This was rejected by the Norwegian Armed Forces, who based their need of transport of military personnel during wartime on requisition of civilian, Norwegian-registered aircraft. The same month, Geir Olsen, head of Braathens in Sweden, withdrew from his position, due to disagreements about the <b>corporate</b> <b>strategy.</b>|$|E

40|$|Background: It is {{important}} to develop and execute human resource practices that generate employee competencies and behaviours the company needs to achieve its strategic goals. SHRM is about how to align HR <b>strategies</b> with <b>corporate</b> <b>strategies,</b> and implemented in a correct way SHRM can be an efficient tool to use for enhancing organisational performance. Purpose: The purpose of the thesis is to evaluate the alignment between EWES Stålfjäder AB´s <b>corporate</b> <b>strategies</b> and its HR strategies. Method: To study this we believe it was accurate to use a qualitative method approach. The empirical study consists of semi-structured interviews as well as written documents. Analysis: The structure of the analysis follows the theoretical framework. We have used the model developed by Dessler (2008, p. 95), “How to Align HR Strategy and Actions with Business Strategy”. Conclusions: We found that EWES Stålfjäder AB need to clarify their <b>corporate</b> <b>strategies</b> throughout the whole organisation. This will help them to identify and implement HR strategies that {{are in line with}} them. Working in this manner, we believe it will help EWES to conceptualize and execute accurate changes the organisation needs to accomplish their <b>corporate</b> <b>strategies.</b> Furthermore, we found that most of EWES’ HR practices become more like add-ons than strategic activities that are aligned with their <b>corporate</b> <b>strategies...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of corporate culture on the strategies used by firms {{to meet the}} environmental sustainability challenge has been explored in this dissertation. This was investigated through web-based questionnaires that were administered to employees in companies who would have knowledge of both their employer‟s corporate culture and corporate sustainability practices. To determine this, the respondents were requested to rate both the <b>corporate</b> <b>strategies</b> undertaken to meet the environmental challenge, {{as well as the}} corporate culture where they work. The <b>corporate</b> <b>strategies</b> were evaluated using a bespoke instrument which was constructed from various strategy instruments found in the literature. The corporate culture was evaluated using a well-known organisational culture instrument available in the literature. Potential contextual variables pertaining to the perceptions of the respondents, {{as well as to the}} business and industry sector characteristics, were evaluated as well. The findings indicated that the contextual variables had little or no effect on either the corporate culture or the <b>corporate</b> <b>strategies</b> undertaken by the firm, and that a strong comprehensive culture correlated strongly with positive <b>corporate</b> <b>strategies.</b> <b>Corporate</b> cultures that emphasise social coordination (or organic culture forms) exhibited stronger correlations with positive <b>corporate</b> <b>strategies</b> than those which emphasise formal control methods (or mechanistic forms). The focus of the firm, whether on internal dynamics or the external environment, did not show a significant effect on the <b>corporate</b> <b>strategies</b> that were undertaken by the firm. A sustainability culture was synthesised from the findings of the research, which concludes with recommendations regarding further research into this topic.
