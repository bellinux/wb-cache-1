40|$|One of {{the most}} {{intriguing}} features of the stellar velocity distribution in the solar neighbourhood is the existence of moving groups. At present, the origin of these kinematic structures is far from completely understood although it is more than 140 years since they were discovered. Nowadays, several explanations for their origin are considered: cluster disruption, dynamical effects induced by the non-axisymmetric components (spiral arms and bar) of the Milky Way (MW), remnants of past accretion events and external dynamical effects on the disc resulting from interaction events. It has already been shown that the effects of the bar and the spiral arms of the MW can induce kinematic groups in the local stellar velocity distribution. The aims of this thesis are: i) to characterise the observed moving groups, establishing observational insights into their origin, and ii) to explore to what extent we can use the kinematic imprints to constrain the large-scale structure of the MW and its recent evolution. To undertake the observational study we have compiled an extensive compendium with the best available astrometric and photometric data for more than 24000 stars in the solar neighbourhood. We have applied the Wavelet Denoising multiscale technique to this sample to characterise and analyse the moving groups in the U-V-age-[Fe/H] space. We find that the dominant kinematic structures in the U-V plane are the branches of Sirius, Coma Berenices, Hyades-Pleiades and Hercules. From the large spread of ages and metallicities inside them, we refuse the models that relate their origin to cluster disruption. The Hercules branch is more conspicuous in the region of inner galactocentric radius, and for a region near the Sun in comparison to a region that is located further in the direction of rotation. For Hyades-Pleiades, Coma Berenices and Sirius the more negative the V component, the higher the mean metallicity. The Hercules branch does not follow this correlation and has a higher metallicity dispersion. On the other hand, we have performed test particle simulations with the ame model to explore the phase space available to the local stellar distribution. This is a specific potential model for the MW which is very flexible and has been tuned to reproduce some recent observational constraints. We have also considered a great variety of initial conditions and integration procedures. This methodology has allowed to study the imprints of the spiral arms and the bar on the velocity distribution at different disc positions. We have also used a method to ascertain the regularity of the orbits in the U-V plane. Our results show that the bar and the spiral arms create strong kinematic imprints on the velocity distributions. When the spiral arms and the bar act together, individual imprints of each component can be still identified in the final velocity distributions. The spiral arms crowd the kinematic region of Hercules and not only the bar, as traditionally believed. The arms also induce slightly tilted kinematic branches that resemble some of the observed ones. The low angular momentum moving groups such as Arcturus can have an origin related to the bar acting on a relatively hot stellar disc, which introduces a new perspective on the interpretation of its extragalactic origin. Our analysis of the observations and and simulations indicates that it is very feasible that some of the observed moving groups have an origin related to the spiral arms and the bar. We find that the induced stellar kinematics groups depend on the properties of the non-axisymmetric components. We discuss if it is currently possible to use the stellar phase space groups as constraints to the large-scale structure and evolution of the MW. KEY WORDS: Galactic dynamics & kinematics, Milky Way, Solar Neighbourhood, Galactic Structure S'ha demostrat que els efectes de la barra i els braços espirals de la Via Làctia (MW) poden induir grups cinemàtics en la distribució de velocitats local. Els objectius d'aquesta tesi són: i) caracteritzar els grups mòbils observats, aportant més coneixement al seu origen, i ii) explorar fins a quin punt podem utilitzar les empremtes cinemàtiques per restringir la estructura a gran escala de la Via Làctia. D'una banda hem aplicat la tècnica del Wavelet Denoising a un compendi de dades cinemàtiques, edats i [Fe/H] per a més de 24000 estrelles de l'entorn solar. Hem trobat que les estructures cinemàtiques dominants en el pla cinemàtic són les branques de Sirius, Coma Berenices, Hyades-Pleiades i Hercules. Degut a la gran dispersió d'edats i metal·licitats dins de les branques, refusem els models que expliquen els grups mòbils com a restes de <b>cúmuls</b> estel·lars. La branca d'Hercules és més rellevant a la regió de radis interiors i en la regió propera al Sol en comparació a la zona cap a la rotació Galàctica. Per Hyades-Pleiades, Coma Berenices i Sirius, com més negativa és la component V de la branca, més gran és la seva metal·licitat mitja. Per altra banda, hem realitzat simulacions de partícules test en un potencial flexible de la MW, consistent amb diverses restriccions observacionals. El nostre treball ha mostrat que la barra Galàctica i els braços espirals creen fortes empremtes cinemàtiques. El braços poblen la regió cinemàtica d'Hercules i no únicament la barra. Els braços també indueixen branques cinemàtiques lleugerament inclinades semblants a les observades. Els grups a baix moment angular com Arcturus poden ser creats per la barra actuant sobre un disc calent i no necessàriament tenir origen extragalàctic. En les simulacions on els braços espirals i la barra actuen alhora, identifiquem empremtes individuals de cada component en les distribucions de velocitat finals. Trobem que els grups cinemàtics induïts depenen de l'estructura del model i de les condicions inicials dels experiments. Finalment discutim si es actualment possible utilitzar els grups estel·lars de l'espai fase com a restriccions de l'estructura a gran escala i evolució de la MW. </I...|$|R
40|$|En septembre 2002, les régions méditerranéennes françaises et notamment le département du Gard ont été affectées par des précipitations d'une extrême intensité. On estime que 80 % de ce département a été inondé, on dénombre 23 victimes et les dégâts ont été évalués à 1. 2 milliards d'euros. Cette {{catastrophe}} hydrologique soulève à nouveau les problèmes de la fréquence de ces événements et de l'augmentation des forts <b>cumuls</b> de pluie ces dernières années. L'objet de cet article est d'apporter quelques éléments de réponse, notamment à travers l'analyse régionale des pluies extrêmes journalières ayant affecté la région Languedoc-Roussillon de 1958 à 2002. La fréquence régionale des pluies extrêmes est estimée en prenant en compte la superficie couverte par ces événements {{en fonction}} des hauteurs pluviométriques. A l'échelle régionale la période de retour de l'événement varie entre 80 ans pour la superficie touchée par au moins 200 mm à 140 ans pour celle couverte par 300 mm. La stationnarité des fréquences des pluies extrêmes est analysée à partir des chroniques du nombre annuel d'événements pluvieux dépassant 200 mm, 250 mm et 300 mm en 24 h maximum, entre 1958 et 2002 sur la région. Les tests de stationnarité ne révèlent pas de tendance significative à l'augmentation de ces fréquences. Les données historiques aboutissent aux mêmes conclusions. L'augmentation réelle des inondations est en fait principalement liée à l'augmentation de la vulnérabilité des bassins. In September 2002, the Gard {{department in the}} South of France was affected by heavy precipitation that covered a broad geographical area. It was estimated that 80 % of the department was flooded; there were 23 victims and the damage was evaluated to be 1. 2 billion euros. This hydrological catastrophe raised questions about a possible increase {{in the frequency of}} these events during recent years, since several other severe flooding events have been observed in the region over the last 15 years. The aim {{of this article is to}} explore these questions through a regional analysis of the extreme daily rainfall that affected the Languedoc-Roussillon region between 1958 and 2002. The daily rain data were used because they are the most available type of information over the observation period. Usually, the rainfall hazard description is based on statistical analysis of the maximum rainfall depth observed at a given rain gauge. However, because the spatial variability of rainfall in the Mediterranean region, such results are only representative of local rainfall conditions. Moreover, this type of analysis does not take into account the spatial coverage of the precipitation, which is another factor influencing the resulting floods. Thus, the regional frequency of extreme rainfall was estimated by taking into account the area covered according to a given rainfall depth. For each rainfall event, a rain field was built using a kriging interpolation (NEPPEL et al., 1997). The isohyet area defined a rainfall threshold from 10 to 300 mm with a step of 10 mm calculated for each rainfall event. For each rainfall depth from 10 to 300 mm with a step of 10 mm, the probability distribution of the isohyet area was estimated. The regional rainfall hazards were described with the Depth-Area-Frequency curves (DAF) for 24 -h periods. It was shown that at on regional scale, the return period of the last event varied between 80 years for the surface affected by at least 200 mm and 140 years for the surface covered by 300 mm. Compared with other major events that have occurred in the region, it appears that the September 2002 event one was characterized by : 1. the spatial extension of the heavy rainfall, for example more than 1800 km² were affected by at least 400 mm in less than 24 h; 2. the spatial localisation of the heaviest rainfall depths, which were measured over the highest relief (1000 m to 1500 m) as usual in the 'cévenols' meteorological situation, but rather in the plain where the altitude lies between 200 m and 300 m. The stationnarity analysis of the extreme rainfall frequency was based on the annual number of events exceeding 200 mm, 250 mm and 300 mm over a 24 h maximum duration, between 1958 and 2002. The hypothesis of random events against the hypothesis of a trend or a sudden break in the mean was examined through several statistical tests. The procedures used were the rank correlation test, PETTITT's test, BUISHAND's test, HUBERT's segmentation procedure, a linear regression procedure, and the turning points procedure. Detailed descriptions of these tests can be found in KENDALL and STUART (1977), LUBES-NIEL et al. (1998) and WMO (2000). Except for the rank correlation test, all the procedures led to the conclusion that the three series are randomly distributed at the level of significance 1 %, 5 % and 10 % respectively. Thus no significant increase in extreme rainfall frequency seems to appear. Although the study period was short, 45 years, compared with climatological variability, LUBES-NIEL et al. (1998) show that the procedures used were adapted in detecting trends in 50 -yr time series. In considering historical rainfall data before 1958 in the same region, at least two extreme rainfall events could be compared with the event on 8 - 9 September 2002 : in October 1940, 840 mm of rainfall were measured during 24 h in the Pyrénées-Orientales district and in September 1900, 940 mm were observed over 24 h in Valleraugue, upstream in the Herault catchment. Furthermore, if the evolution of the rain gauge network density is taken into account, one can argue that such an event could have occurred more frequently. Indeed, the number of rain gauges has varied from 162 gauges in 1900 to 330 today. It has been shown that the number of observed rainfall events varied according to the area of the events and the network density (NEPPEL et al., 1998 b). For example, an event of 150 km 2 (corresponding to the area covered by more than 600 mm in September 2002) had a probability of 70 % to be observed by the network between 1958 and 1993. If one considers the period 1920 - 1939, this probability decreases to 30 %. In addition, the basin vulnerability has increased. The regional population has grown from 1, 460, 000 inhabitants in 1949 to 2, 300, 000 in 2000. At the same time, urbanization has expanded widely. Moreover, this new population came from other districts, and they are not familiar with the Mediterranean rainfall regime and the resulting flash floods. Buildings have often been constructed near rivers, which are attractive building sites, and sometimes even in the river's main channel, increasing the flooding risk and the flood damages. Thus, rather than climate change, for which the effect on extreme rainfalls cannot be proved, the development of basin urbanisation and vulnerability could explain the apparent increase in floods. As the regional population is expected to reach more than 3, 000, 000 by 2030, it is necessary to take into account the flood risk in future urban planning...|$|R

50|$|In recent years, the <b>cumul</b> {{has been}} {{increasingly}} criticized. Critics contend that lawmakers that {{also have some}} local mandate cannot be assiduous to both tasks; for instance, they may neglect their duties to attend parliamentary sittings and commission in order to attend to tasks in their constituency. The premise that holders of dual office can defend the interest of their city etc. in the National Parliament is criticized in that national lawmakers should have the national interest in their mind, not the advancement of the projects of the particular city they are from. Finally, this criticism {{is part of a}} wider criticism of the political class as a cozy, closed world in which the same people make a long career from multiple positions.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] <b>cumul</b> des mandats [...] ( [...] , [...] {{accumulation}} of mandates) is the French {{equivalent of the}} dual mandate in other countries. It is a political practice particularly common in France (as well as Belgium), in comparison to other Western countries. It consists of simultaneously holding two or more elective offices {{at different levels of}} government — local, regional, national and European — as mayors, MPs, senators, Members of the European Parliament, and President of the General Council in their home regions. [...] Sometimes, officials hold as many as four positions. While officials may not be elected to more than one office at the same level (such as being both an MP and a senator), they may hold offices in any combination at the municipal, departmental, regional, national and European levels.|$|E
5000|$|The {{purpose of}} holding {{multiple}} offices are multiple. Holding {{a seat in}} the Senate, National Assembly, or European Parliament gives local mayors a valuable method of tapping funds to develop their home cities and regions. [...] It also can give many opportunities to curry favor with other important officials, with opportunities at each level. [...] Salaries for positions can be combined to a point as well, for greater wage compensation as an additional reward for building a political safety net. [...] For politicians with national ambitions, retaining a position in a local town can give them a down-to-earth aura that can appeal to voters. These advantages have made politicians very wary of reducing the practice of the <b>cumul</b> with legislation despite other moves to end perceptions of favoritism and corruption among politicians.|$|E

40|$|Multiple-office holding (holding {{simultaneously}} {{more than}} one elected position at different levels) represents a dilemma for political parties in terms of personnel selection. On the one hand, politicians who already have one elected position and want to gain an additional one are an electoral asset for their party since they have already demonstrated their ability to convince the electors and since they can rely on the resources of their current mandate to campaign. On the other hand, multiple-office holders are also a threat because {{they are able to}} accumulate individual resources not controlled by the party which makes them more independent. Parties in France and in Germany seems to respond differently to this dilemma. Whereas most French MPs hold concurrently one local mandate and maintain it for a long time, only a minority of German MPs hold a local mandat and they tend to abandon it after they entered parliament. Moving beyond culturalist explanations of the high level of multiple-office holding in France (<b>cumul</b> des mandats), we want to test the effects of institutional and systemic factors such as the total number of mandates available in each country, the role of parliament in the German federal and parliamentary system as opposed to the French centralised and semi-presidential regime. Institutional factors of special importance are the electoral rules. We assume that the more an election is individualized (uninominal rather than list, majority rather than proportional) the more leverage the politicians have to decide about their own fate; this, in turn, allows individual politicians to garner mandates even against the interest of their party and should increase the frequency of <b>cumul</b> des mandats. Thus, our analysis of <b>cumul</b> des mandats combines an analysis of the cost for parties to let their politicians hold several mandates with an analysis of the autonomy of individual politicians within their party organization under the specific institutional rules in France and Germany.

40|$|The French {{system of}} local and {{regional}} government has long been characterised by several features (Mabileau, 1994). The first is the institutional fragmentation without comparison anywhere else in Europe : 36 700 municipalities, {{as much as in}} the 14 other EU member states put together. The second is the multiple office holding (<b>cumul</b> des mandats) that enabled local politicians, until some limitations were enforced, to be mayors, members of département and regional assemblies and MP, and sometimes ministers. This practice was not only a way to extend and secure political control, but also {{to gain access to the}} central government's resources in order to implement policies at the constituency level. This system gave birth to a specific political breed, the notables, those politicians who where outrageously dominating local political spaces because of their personal prestige and their privileged access to central government and administrations. Those notables were often competing against each other to gain resources from the central government and to influence national policies (Grémion, 1976). In some way, and this is the third peculiarity of the French local and regional government system, this permanent competition between local and regional politicians has long been seen as an asset for the State's field services, and for the Prefect in the first place. The central government representatives at the field level were able to use this competition to impose some of their choices and priorities. For a long time, all these features have not made cooperation a salient aspect {{of local and}} regional governance. Competition was rather the rule and the 1982 Decentralization reforms did nothing to change this situation. Nevertheless, things recently changed in France and cooperation managed to nestle in the French local government system. In this paper, we will distinguish two different kinds of cooperation : on one hand, we will deal with horizontal cooperation, i. e. forms of cooperation linking authorities of the same territorial level (in this perspective, we will mainly deal with inter-municipal cooperation); on the other hand, we will deal with vertical cooperation, i. e. forms of cooperation linking authorities of different territorial levels. The main arguments of this paper are the following. Firstly, the concern for horizontal cooperation came first, it is only very recently that the problem of vertical cooperation arose. The consolidation of horizontal cooperation practices mainly occurred between municipalities and has been crowned with the recent and spectacular reinforcement and/or multiplication of inter-municipal cooperation institutions. Nevertheless, and this is the second main point of the chapter, this cooperation, when it occurred, was not always the result of the creation of strong cooperation institutions but rather the outcome of the collective recognition of common stakes and problems and of the collective work on these common stakes and problems. Cooperation has often been gradual, incremental and problem-driven. The third argument of the chapter is that it is the reinforcement of horizontal cooperation between municipalities that generated the urge for vertical cooperation, mainly between reinforced inter-municipal cooperation institutions on one hand, and départements and regions on the other hand. The reinforcement of vertical cooperation occurred along quite the same process, i. e. problems came first, were collectively tackled, but mainly through informal arrangements...|$|E

Un cadre probabiliste régional est utilisé, avec une paramétrisation de la distribution des pluies à l’aide de l’indice ENSO. La dépendance spatiale entre sites est modélisée par une copule, et une inférence bayésienne permet d’accéder directement aux incertitudes d’estimation des différents paramètres du modèle. Deux cas d’étude sont présentés, le premier sur le <b>cumul</b> des pluies sur les 3 mois de l’été, le second sur la valeur maximale journalière des pluies d’été. Un modèle asymétrique {{permet de}} montrer que la phase El Niño n’a que peu d’influence, alors la phase La Niña est propice à une augmentation des pluies, de l’ordre de + 20 à + 50 % pour la pluie centennale journalière en comparaison avec un calcul probabiliste en mode stationnaire. Le cadre régional d’analyse probabiliste a l’avantage d’exploiter une information plus conséquente qu’avec une analyse locale, avec un meilleur pouvoir de détection du lien de causalité entre pluie extrême et oscillation climatique. / There is increasing {{evidence that the}} distribution of hydrometeorological variables such as average or extreme rainfall/runoff is modulated by modes of climate variability in many regions of the world. This paper presents a general spatio-temporal regional frequency analysis framework that allows quantifying the effect of climate variability {{on the distribution of}} at-site hydrometeorological variables. Climate effects are described through the parameters of a pre-specified distribution, by using regression models linking parameter values with time-varying covariates, such as climate indices. For the regional model copulas are used to incorporate spatial dependency. A Bayesian framework is used for inference and prediction, which enables quantification of parameter and predictive uncertainties. A regional approach enables better identification of climate effects which can be subject to high uncertainty using only at-site (local) analysis. Lastly, model comparison tools enable considering competing statistical hypotheses on the nature of climate effects and selecting the most relevant one. This modelling framework is applied to two case studies assessing the effect of El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on summer rainfall in Southeast Queensland. The first case study focuses on summer rainfall totals while the second analysis focuses on extremes using summer daily rainfall maxima. The Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), a measure of ENSO, is considered as a time-varying covariate. In order to account for different effects during La Niña and El Niño episodes, an asymmetric piecewise-linear regression is used to analyse the rainfall data using both local and regional models. During La Niña episodes, SOI has a significant effect on both summer rainfall totals and maxima. Conversely, during El Niño episodes, the SOI has little effect on rainfall. It is found that, during a strong La Niña, the most likely 1 in 100 year summer maximum daily rainfall for different sites estimated with the local asymmetric model can be 5 % to 33 % higher than the estimates from a local symmetric linear model and 20 % to 50 % higher than the estimates from a stationary model, albeit with significant uncertainty. Results from regional and local models are also compared: the former shows a great advantage in terms of uncertainty reduction and allows a better quantification of the ENSO effect on summer rainfall totals and maxima...|$|E

La {{structure}} de la règle est construite à partir de l'observation de la gestion pratiquée actuellement sur le terrain. Les paramètres de cette règle sont ajustés de façon à minimiser le <b>cumul</b> moyen des écarts entre demandes et ressources des séries générées après une étude fréquentielle des aléas hydrauliques. Dans le cas du périmètre lié au barrage de Ghézala, cette méthode {{permet de}} répartir au mieux les risques de défaillance sur l'année et d'adapter la stratégie d'irrigation aux phases végétatives critiques des cultures. Les avantages et les inconvénients de cette approche empirique par rapport aux techniques de programmation dynamique sont finalement discutés et mis en relief pour les systèmes de gestion des ressources en zones semi-arides. An empirical inter-annual management rule is defined {{to operate a}} reservoir for irrigation use in a semi-arid zone. Management rules for hydro-agricultural systems in semi-arid zones consist of establishing a trade-off between the total quantity of water to be distributed for summer irrigation and the indispensable volumes {{to be held in}} store for the raising of future seedlings during the following autumn. In less arid countries, water is sufficiently cheap so that it is economically profitable to deliver great quantities to sustain maximum agricultural output. Indeed, water is sufficiently abundant so that it is generally useless to conserve reserves for the next year. Such an inter-annual compromise is not the norm for water resources managers in humid climates. For instance, the two consecutive dry summers in Europe in 1989 and 1990 would not have had the same impact on the agricultural economy in the semi-arid zones. There rules of management would have been adapted to obtain of an inter-annual balance. Numerous mathematical methods have been used in the domain of water resource systems management, sustained by the constant increase of computer performances. Reservoir management issues have consequently been widely studied and solved both from the viewpoint of the art of modeling and the methods of optimization. Nevertheless it is necessary to ensure that the mathematically correct optimal solution is also implementable when one leaves the computer screen {{to get back to the}} field: the success of this passage depends largely on the ability of the objective function to quantify the economic stakes encoded in the choice of a management rule. Except for hydropower generation, the various uses of a dam are most unlikely to be integrated into an aggregative utility function under the form of separable additive criteria. A way to bypass the inherent difficulties in the design of a realistic objective quantification is to restrict the search of the operation rule to the class of strategies compatible with the commonly met attitude of semi-arid water resources system managers. The structure of the rule is designed from the observation of the effective management presently in operation. Its logic fits to the following reasoning:- when the reservoir level is low, as soon as it starts to vary, the irrigation perimeter manager will behave very prudently. i. e. by reducing the proportion of the allocated irrigation water to the amount in store; - for average working conditions, the system manager will deliver a constant fraction of the available reservoir storage for irrigation; - when the quantity stored in the dam is high, the manager tends to satisfy completely the irrigation demand. The parameters of this piecewise linear rule are adjusted so as to minimize the probability of discrepancy between demands and resources on series obtained after a brief hydrological study. The Ghezala perimeter in Tunisia, which is situated in the watershed of lake Ichkeul, has been taken as a case study. With a thousand hectares of irrigated crops to be satisfied from an upstream 12 hm 3 reservoir, and 625 mm rain per year on the watershed with a strong seasonal dependence, the Ghezala perimeter is quite representative of Tunisian irrigation practices. The method developed in this paper allows to balance the risk of failure all over the year and to adapt the strategy of irrigation according to critical vegetative phases of the crops. A statistical analysis of possible deficits according to the improved rule reveals that the method improves the performance of irrigation and decreases its sensitivity to the critical vegetative phases that are of critical importance in agriculture in semi-arid zones. The management model is unsophisticated but its objective is to provide elements of appreciation to the manager of the irrigated perimeter. Each component of the model can be improved and more finely described. Advantages and drawbacks of this empirical approach with regards to more conventional dynamic programming techniques are finally discussed and underlined for water resource systems with specific attention to their management in semi-arid zones...|$|E
