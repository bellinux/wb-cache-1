5|$|The {{preservation}} of oral history may {{be achieved through}} musical performance in Madagascar. Among the Betsileo, for instance, oral histories are retold through a form of musical performance called the rija, which {{in its current form}} may represent a combination of the original, single-verse rija and an epic poem called the isa. The Betsileo rija is performed by two men who each play a jejy while singing very loudly with a strained pitch in the soprano range. The structure of the song is complex and, unlike other Malagasy musical styles, parallel thirds are not predominant in the harmony. Other Southern ethnic groups also perform simplified variations of the rija featuring for example a solo musician who strums rather than fiddles his accompanying instrument and sings at a lower, more natural pitch. While the Betsileo rija <b>can</b> <b>address</b> diverse themes, those performed by other southern groups are almost always praise songs recalling a favorably memorable event.|$|E

25|$|In {{the consent}} {{procedure}} (formerly assent procedure), the Council can adopt legislation {{based on a}} proposal by the European Commission after obtaining the consent of Parliament. Thus Parliament has the legal power to accept or reject any proposal but no legal mechanism exists for proposing amendments. Parliament has however provided for conciliation committee and a procedure for giving interim reports where it <b>can</b> <b>address</b> its concerns to the Council and threaten to withhold its consent unless its concerns are met. This applies to admission of members, methods of withdrawal, subsidiary general legal basis provision and combating discrimination.|$|E
25|$|Mediation is {{a process}} during which abductors and the left behind family, {{assisted}} by mediator(s), attempt to resolve conflicts independent of the judicial system. Mediators create a constructive atmosphere for discussions and ensure fair dealings between parents. The mediators do not make decisions; instead, they confine themselves to assisting the parties in working out for themselves a fair and sensible solution to their problems. More specifically, the mediation <b>can</b> <b>address</b> not only the child’s primary residence, but also the child’s contact with both parents, visitation arrangements, agreements concerning the child’s maintenance, schooling, further education, bi-cultural and bi-lingual upbringing, necessary arrangements for financial support etc.|$|E
25|$|Beckett {{was then}} Leader of the House of Commons from 1998 until her {{replacement}} by Robin Cook in June 2001. Her tenure saw {{the introduction of}} Westminster Hall debates, which are debates held in a small chamber near Westminster Hall on topics of interest to individual MPs, committee reports, and other matters that would not ordinarily be debated in the Commons chamber. Debates {{that take place in}} Westminster Hall are often more consensual and informal, and <b>can</b> <b>address</b> the concerns of backbenchers. She received admiration for her work as Leader of the House, working on this {{and a number of other}} elements of the Labour government's modernisation agenda for Parliament.

25|$|Within the {{executive}} branch of Oklahoma government, the governor is assisted by the Lieutenant Governor of Oklahoma, the Secretary of State of Oklahoma, the Attorney General of Oklahoma, and the State Treasurer of Oklahoma, among others. While the other high level executive offices are elected directly by the people of Oklahoma, the Secretary of State is appointed by the governor with the consent of the Oklahoma Senate for a four-year term. Due to the large number of state agencies, the governor is assisted in running the government through the use of the Oklahoma State Cabinet. Through the Cabinet, the Governor <b>can</b> <b>address</b> the assembled heads of Oklahoma's executive branch departments which oversee Oklahoma's agencies. A secretary appointed by the governor heads each department and carryies out his executive orders through that department.|$|E
25|$|A second {{exception}} {{is to be}} found in the works of researchers who have employed resources from ethnomethodology and symbolic interactionism in studying legal settings. This type of research is clearly sociological rather than socio-legal research because it continually engages in debate with other theoretical traditions in sociology. Max Travers' doctoral thesis about the work of a firm of criminal lawyers took other sociologists, and especially Marxists, to task for not addressing or respecting how lawyers and clients understand their own actions (a standard argument used by ethnomethodologists in debates with structural traditions in the discipline). It also, however, explored issues raised by legal thinkers in their critique of structural traditions in sociology of law: the extent to which social science <b>can</b> <b>address</b> the content of legal practice.|$|E
25|$|In the elections, the TDP {{allied with}} the Sanjaya Vichara Manch party and decided to field educated {{candidates}} who had a good name in the society and were not indulging in corruption, which was an innovative political concept at the time. NTR himself decided to contest from two assembly constituencies, Gudivada and Tirupati. NTR used many innovative ways of campaigning, such as being the first politician in India to use rath yatras for campaigning. However, it was MGR who had started the opentop van campaigning for elections, as {{it was felt that}} he <b>can</b> <b>address</b> the roadshows {{as an alternative to the}} mammoth meetings, which involves large amount of money as well as manpower. For this, he used a modified Chevrolet van which was given the name of Chaitanya Ratham. In this, NTR travelled across the state of Andhra Pradesh, crisscrossing all the districts. With his son Nandamuri Harikrishna, also a film actor, driving the van, NTR notched up over 75,000 kilometres during his campaign, a distinctive sight with the van's yellow party flags and banners and NTR sitting on top of the vehicle hailing the crowds. NTR campaigned for restoring the dignity of the Telugu people and advocated the forming a closer bond between the government and the common people, going into the elections with the slogan, Telugu Vari Atma Gauravam (lit. Telugu people's self-respect).|$|E

500|$|Among {{the general}} public, the parity of zero {{can be a}} source of confusion. In {{reaction}} time experiments, most people are slower to identify 0 as even than 2, 4, 6, or 8. Some students of mathematics—and some teachers—think that zero is odd, or both even and odd, or neither. Researchers in mathematics education propose that these misconceptions can become learning opportunities. Studying equalities like [...] <b>can</b> <b>address</b> students' doubts about calling 0 a number and using it in arithmetic. Class discussions can lead students to appreciate the basic principles of mathematical reasoning, such as the importance of definitions. Evaluating the parity of this exceptional number is an early example of a pervasive theme in mathematics: the abstraction of a familiar concept to an unfamiliar setting.|$|E

MIT students collaborated with the government of Singapore and a professor at the National University of Singapore to create AudiOdyssey, a game which allows both blind and sighted gamers to play together. Guitar Hero was used as part of a Trent University youth sleep study, which showed that, in general, players who played a song were better at it twelve hours later if that period included normal sleep.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Current Genetic Algorithms <b>can</b> {{efficiently}} <b>address</b> order-k separable problems, {{in which}} {{the order of the}} linkage is restricted to a low value k. Outside this class, there exist hierarchical problems that cannot be addressed by current genetic algorithms, yet <b>can</b> be <b>addressed</b> efficiently in principle by exploiting hierarchy. We delineate the class of hierarchical problems, and describe a framework for Hierarchical Genetic Algorithms. Based on this outline for algorithms, we investigate under what conditions hierarchical problems may be solved efficiently. Sufficient conditions are provided under which hierarchical problems <b>can</b> be <b>addressed</b> in polynomial time. The analysis points to the importance of efficient sampling techniques that assess the quality of module settings. ...|$|R

500|$|As Anne Frank's stature as both {{a writer}} and humanist has grown, she has been {{discussed}} specifically {{as a symbol of}} the Holocaust and more broadly as a representative of persecution.

After receiving a humanitarian award from the Anne Frank Foundation in 1994, Nelson Mandela addressed a crowd in Johannesburg, saying he had read Anne Frank's diary while in prison and [...] "derived much encouragement from it." [...] He likened her struggle against Nazism to his struggle against apartheid, drawing a parallel between the two philosophies: [...] "Because these beliefs are patently false, and because they were, and will always be, challenged by the likes of Anne Frank, they are bound to fail." [...] Also in 1994, Václav Havel said [...] "Anne Frank's legacy is very much alive and it <b>can</b> <b>address</b> us fully" [...] in relation to the political and social changes occurring at the time in former Eastern Bloc countries.|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} create a balance in the track listing, Lafourcade wrote [...] "Te Quiero Ver" [...] as a [...] "simple song" [...] about wanting to be with someone. The track was co-written by Marian Ruzzi, and was {{inspired}} by the music of the 1970s, including a chorus with answering voices, emulating musical theatre. The lyrics for [...] "Lo Que Construimos", deals with the decision to leave someone and going separate ways. [...] "Estoy Lista" [...] is a ballad about being ready to be well, and Lafourcade worked on the track in her spare time, taking a year to finish it. The last track, [...] "No Más Llorar", was written during a family reunion with her father and sister in Chile. Lafourcade wrote it about a love that could not be, her mourning and search for stability, forgiveness, and healing. In live performances, the singer dedicates the track to Mexico, to send hope through her music and help people deal with situations such as the Iguala mass kidnapping. [...] "I feel that nowadays is really important that we acknowledge the social part.
