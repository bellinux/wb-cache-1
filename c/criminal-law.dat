50|$|A {{closely related}} concept to {{spoliation}} of evidence is tampering with evidence, {{which is usually}} the <b>criminal-law</b> {{version of the same}} concept, namely when a person alters, conceals, falsifies, or destroys evidence in an investigation by law enforcement or by a regulatory authority. An act of ruining or destroying evidence may sometimes be considered both spoliation of evidence and tampering with evidence. For example, when police destroy their own dashboard-camera footage or seize and destroy a citizen's video footage of an incident, it may constitute spoliation of evidence in a criminal case against the defendant if the footage tended to create reasonable doubt for the defendant, and also constitute tampering if the video were evidence of police misconduct in a criminal or regulatory investigation of the police's actions. The goal of spoliating or tampering with evidence is usually to cover up evidence that would be disfavorable to the doer in some way.|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{there have}} been various {{developments}} within Dutch substantive <b>criminal-law</b> doctrine that in some important ways suggest a shift towards a common-law conception of judicial interpretation in different topics which are central to substantive criminal law. The developments suggest that <b>criminal-law</b> doctrine in the Netherlands is becoming sketchier and is losing some theoretical profundity. Building on Cassirer's philosophy of symbolic forms, Shapiro's planning theory of law, and Wittgenstein's considerations on rule-following, this article aims {{to contribute to a}} description of the independent function of doctrine in substantive criminal law, by addressing the question as to how, and in what sense, doctrine 'helps' the court in applying the statutory and non-statutory <b>criminal-law</b> norms. It is argued that the law constitutes a 'symbolic form' that is to some extent disassociated from the social life-world, and that is construed by way of sophisticated, shared forms of 'social planning'. These forms of social planning form parts of a 'practice' governed by a specific 'legal point of view'. It is further argued that <b>criminal-law</b> doctrine, in a radical sense, comprises a form of proceduralization, by means of which the adjudicating judge is 'directed' to a certain position within the criminal law's symbolically construed space. It is concluded that <b>criminal-law</b> doctrine fulfils an important function in 'situating' the judge, and in 'prompting' or 'compelling' the judge, from his subjective position, to apply a <b>criminal-law</b> norm in an objectively correct manner...|$|E

However, self-sufficiency of law and mere legal positivism are a true obstacle in this battle. This pressure and the lack of questionings are the first step on the road to disappearance of the man, because a man that asks questions is the man that exists. He and his boldness are a barrier to voluntarism. The lack of boldness of the man opens the gates to his disappearance. This boldness has not been taken away from him in the field of bioethics, which is neither secular nor religious, but rather unique as the man is unique...|$|E

40|$|The current {{approach}} to regulate spectrum sensing seems light-handed (just specify the target sensitivity), but has very heavy-handed consequences.

Organized crime is inseparably associated with the most controversial institutions of procedural criminal law, namely, the institutions of the cooperating accused person, informers, agents provocateurs, and the protected witness, which in the fight against organized crime represent a serious challenge for the fundamental principles of procedural criminal law.
