40|$|Abstract: This paper studies a {{weighted}} local linear regression smoother for longitudinal/clustered data, which takes a form {{similar to the}} classical weighted least squares estimate. As a hybrid of the methods of Chen and Jin (2005) and Wang (2003), the proposed local linear smoother maintains the advantages of both methods in computational and theoretical simplicity, variance minimization and bias reduction. Moreover, the proposed smoother is optimal {{in the sense that}} it attains linear minimax efficiency when the within-cluster correlation is correctly specified. In the special case that the joint density of covariates in a cluster exists and is <b>continuous,</b> any <b>working</b> within-cluster correlation would lead to linear minimax efficiency for the proposed method.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that neural noise in the cortex arises from chaotic dynamics in the balanced state: in this model of cortical dynamics, the excitatory and inhibitory inputs to each neuron approximately cancel, and activity is driven by fluctuations of the synaptic inputs around their mean. It remains unclear whether neural networks in the balanced state can perform tasks that are highly sensitive to noise, such as storage of <b>continuous</b> parameters in <b>working</b> memory, while also accounting for the irregular behavior of single neurons. Here we show that <b>continuous</b> parameter <b>working</b> memory can be maintained in the balanced state, in a neural circuit with a simple network architecture. We show analytically that {{in the limit of}} an infinite network, the dynamics generated by this architecture are characterized by a continuous set of steady balanced states, allowing for the indefinite storage of a continuous parameter. In finite networks, we show that the chaotic noise drives diffusive motion along the approximate attractor, which gradually degrades the stored memory. We analyze the dynamics and show that the slow diffusive motion induces slowly decaying temporal cross correlations in the activity, which differ substantially from those previously described in the balanced state. We calculate the diffusivity, and show that it is inversely proportional to the system size. For large enough (but realistic) neural population sizes, and with suitable tuning of the network connections, the proposed balanced network can sustain continuous parameter values in memory over time scales larger by several orders of magnitude than the single neuron time scale.

In addition to installing an air compressor at the bank to assist ventilation, he moved the hauling engine to the out-by end of the drift; and relocated the pump to extract the surplus water. The output increased to record levels, peaking at 600 tons for an 8.5-hour shift. In 1894, he attempted without success to expand the colliery in a southerly direction. The results of these modifications offered continual employment until 1902, when the mine became commercially exhausted.|$|E

In a world which has adequate supplies of energy, scientific knowledge and inventions for utilising it, and the man-power able and willing to perform the necessary duties and services, poverty and destitution are purely artificial institutions, due to ignorance of the principles of government, actively, if not deliberately, fostered for class ends by legal conventions confounding wealth with debt.

Although the two ND unorganized townships have numbers that are not duplicated by any existing MD or SD unorganized townships, the ND numbering sequence is unrelated to the MD and SD numbering sequence (T3 ND and T4 ND are immediately to the north of T40 MD and T41 MD).

At the end of 1944, more than 2.4 million Javanese died because of starvation. Nobody was an exception in the Japanese cruelty.
