40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the effect of castration, sex and type of birth on the rate of body weight gain and linear measurements non <b>castrates,</b> <b>castrates</b> and female Savanna Brown kids. The mean values of the body weight, body length and chest girth of single non-castrates (5. 75 kg, 53. 37 cm and 42. 50 cm) were higher but not significantly different (p > 0. 05) from other groups. Single <b>castrates</b> and twin <b>castrates</b> in height at withers (38. 86 cm and 38. 47 cm), significantly (p < 0. 05) differed from that of the females (36. 09 cm).

40|$|Prolactin (PRL) {{concentrations}} were measured in serum of intact rams, <b>castrate</b> rams, and steroid-treated <b>castrate</b> rams {{to determine whether}} testicular steroids influence PRL secretion in this species. Testosterone was administered to <b>castrate</b> rams by subdermal Silastic implants providing serum testosterone concentrations {{similar to those found}} in intact rams; estradiol was administered similarly to <b>castrate</b> rams, providing a ten-fold elevation of serum estradiol. Testosterone and estradiol implants decreased serum LH to concentrations found in intact rams, whereas estradiol, but not testosterone, effectively increased basal concentrations of PRL. This effect was most apparent when animals were exposed to short photoperiods (8 hours light: 16 hours darkness). When 5 g of thyrotropin releasing hormone were injected into these animals, peak PRL {{concentrations were}} lowest in <b>castrate</b> rams and highest in estradiol-treated <b>castrate</b> rams. PRL responses in testosterone- treated <b>castrate</b> rams and intact rams to the releasing hormone were intermediate.

5|$|Cats {{are ready}} to go to new homes at about 12 weeks of age, when they {{are ready to}} leave their mother. They can be surgically sterilized (spayed or <b>castrated)</b> as early as 7 weeks to limit {{unwanted}} reproduction. This surgery also prevents undesirable sex-related behavior, such as aggression, territory marking (spraying urine) in males and yowling (calling) in females. Traditionally, this surgery was performed at around six to nine months of age, but it is increasingly being performed prior to puberty, at about three to six months. In the US, about 80% of household cats are neutered.|$|E
5|$|Following Christopher's {{early death}} in 931, and given Constantine VII's de facto sidelining, Stephen and Constantine assumed an {{increased}} prominence, although formally they still ranked after their brother-in-law {{in the college}} of emperors.

5|$|In {{the area}} of Pendjari National Park, almost all West African males are maneless or have very weak manes.

In addition, increased testosterone may be the cause of the maned lionesses of northern Botswana.|$|E
40|$|Castration {{has a long}} {{temporal}} and geographical span. Its origins are unclear, but likely lie in the Ancient Near East {{around the time of}} the Secondary Products Revolution and the increase in social complexity of proto-urban societies. Due to the unique social and gender roles created by castratesâ€™ ambiguous sexual state, human <b>castrates</b> were used heavily in strongly hierarchical social structures such as imperial and religious institutions, and were often close to the ruler of an imperial society. This privileged position, though often occupied by slaves, gave <b>castrates</b> enormous power to affect governmental decisions. This often aroused the jealousy and hatred of intact elite males, who were not afforded as open access to the ruler and virulently condemned <b>castrates</b> in historical documents. These attitudes were passed down to the scholars and doctors who began to study castration in the late 19 th and early 20 th centuries, affecting the manner in which castration was studied. Osteometric and anthropometric examinations of <b>castrates</b> were carried out during this period, but the two World Wars and a shift in focus meant that <b>castrate</b> bodies were not studied for nearly eighty years. Recent interest in gender and sexuality in the past has revived interest in castration as a topic, but few studies of <b>castrate</b> remains have occurred. As large numbers of <b>castrates</b> are referenced in historical documents, the lack of <b>castrate</b> skeletons may be due to a lack of recognition of the physical effects of castration on the skeleton. The synthesis and generation of methods for more accurate identification of <b>castrate</b> skeletons was undertaken and the results are presented here to improve the ability to identify <b>castrate</b> skeletons within the archaeological record.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{androgen}} aromatization {{hypothesis was}} {{examined in the}} male lizard, Anolis carolinensis. After castration, sc silastic implants of testosterone (T) restored both challenge and courtship behavior, while dihydrotestosterone (DHT) or 17 /?-estradiol (E) {{had no effect on}} male behaviors. Both T and DHT, but not E, stimulated hypertrophy and colloid production by the renal sex segment, a secondary sexual characteristic of male lizards. In two separate studies, <b>castrates</b> received DHT in combination with E. In each replicate, half of the <b>castrates</b> responded with increases in courtship be-havior after hormone treatment.

5|$|Eusebius characterizes Urbanus {{as a man}} {{who enjoyed}} some variety in his punishments. One day, shortly after Easter 307, he ordered the virgin Theodosia from Tyre (á¹¢Å«r, Lebanon) thrown to the sea for conversing with Christians {{attending}} trial and refusing sacrifice; the Christians in court, meanwhile, he sent to Phaeno. On a single day, November 2, 307, Urbanus sentenced a man named Domninus to be burned alive, three youths to fight as gladiators, and a priest to be exposed to a beast. On the same day, he ordered some young men to be <b>castrated,</b> sent three virgins to brothels, and imprisoned a number of others, including Pamphilus of Caesarea, a priest, scholar, and defender of the theologian Origen. Soon after, and for unknown reasons, Urbanus was stripped of his rank, imprisoned, tried, and executed, all in one day of expedited proceedings. His replacement, Firmilianus, was a veteran soldier and one of Maximinus's trusted confidants.|$|E
5|$|From {{the later}} twelfth- to the mid thirteenth century, the dynasty {{suffered}} from bitter factionalism and vicious kin-strife. RÇ«gnvaldr Ã“lÃ¡fsson's father, Ã“lÃ¡fr, was a younger son of GuÃ°rÃ¸Ã°r Ã“lÃ¡fsson, King of Dublin and the Isles (died 1187). According to the chronicle, {{before his death}} in 1187, GuÃ°rÃ¸Ã°r Ã“lÃ¡fsson instructed that Ã“lÃ¡fr should succeed to the kingship. The latter was only a child at the time, however, and the Islesmen instead inaugurated RÇ«gnvaldr GuÃ°rÃ¸Ã°arson (died 1229), GuÃ°rÃ¸Ã°r Ã“lÃ¡fsson's eldest albeit illegitimate son. As {{the first quarter of the}} thirteenth century began to wane, contentions between the half-brothers broke out into outright war. By the turn of the first quarter of the century, Ã“lÃ¡fr managed to put aside the wife that RÇ«gnvaldr GuÃ°rÃ¸Ã°arson had assigned him; and afterwards married CairistÃ­ona, thereby gaining her father's military assistance. As time wore on, Ã“lÃ¡fr gained the upper-hand in the struggle, and at one point had RÇ«gnvaldr GuÃ°rÃ¸Ã°arson's son, GuÃ°rÃ¸Ã°r RÃ¶gnvaldsson (died 1231), blinded and <b>castrated.</b> The bitter conflict between the half-brothers ended with RÇ«gnvaldr GuÃ°rÃ¸Ã°arson's treacherous death in 1229. For a brief period in 1230/1231, Ã“lÃ¡fr co-ruled the kingdom with GuÃ°rÃ¸Ã°r RÃ¶gnvaldsson. When the latter was slain in 1231, Ã“lÃ¡fr ruled the entire kingdom without any internal opposition until his own death in 1237.|$|E

5|$|Instances of {{war crimes}} were alleged to have {{occurred}} {{on both sides of}} the conflict, and troops from both the UN and North Korea were involved in several high-profile incidents. The North Korean troops, in occupying South Korea, were accused of many instances of abuse of prisoners of war captured during the fighting. Most serious among these were accusations that some captured UN prisoners were tortured and executed. Isolated incidents of prisoners being beaten, <b>castrated,</b> burned to death, and used for bayonet practice arose. In the Taegu region, groups of captured soldiers were found executed with their hands bound. This was also known to have occurred at Masan, where isolated instances of prisoners being used as human shields against other UN troops were known to have taken place. Critically wounded UN troops were known to have been killed, and in at least one instance, unarmed chaplains and medics were attacked despite wearing proper identification. The North Koreans were also known to have forcibly conscripted South Korean civilians into their armies on a large scale, killing any who attempted to desert.|$|E
5|$|Sommerstein {{attempts}} {{a reconstruction}} of {{the plot of the}} Troilos, in which the title character is incestuously in love with Polyxena and tries to discourage the interest in marrying her shown by both Achilles and Sarpedon, a Trojan ally and son of Zeus. Sommerstein argues that Troilus is accompanied on his fateful journey to his death, not by Polyxena, but by his tutor, a eunuch Greek slave. Certainly there is a speaking role for a eunuch who reports being <b>castrated</b> by Hecuba and someone reports the loss of their adolescent master. The incestuous love is deduced by Sommerstein from a fragment of Strattis' parody, assumed to partially quote Sophocles, and from his understanding that the Sophocles play intends to contrast barbarian customs, including incest, with Greek ones. Sommerstein also sees this as solving what he considers the need for an explanation of Achilles' treatment of Troilus' corpse, the latter being assumed to have insulted Achilles in the process of warning him off Polyxena. Italian professor of English and expert on Troilus, Piero Boitani, on the other hand, considers Troilus' rejection of Achilles' sexual advances towards him as sufficient motive for the mutilation.|$|E
5|$|Tamar's youth {{coincided with}} a major {{upheaval}} in Georgia; in 1177, her father, George III, was confronted by a rebellious faction of nobles. The rebels intended to dethrone George {{in favor of the}} king's fraternal nephew, Demna, who was {{considered by many to be}} a legitimate royal heir of his murdered father, David V. Demna's cause was little but a pretext for the nobles, led by the pretender's father-in-law, the amirspasalar ("constable") Ivane Orbeli, to weaken the crown. George III was able to crush the revolt and embarked on a crackdown campaign on the defiant aristocratic clans; Ivane Orbeli was put to death and the surviving members of his family were driven out of Georgia. Prince Demna, <b>castrated</b> and blinded on his uncle's order, did not survive the mutilation and soon died in prison. Once the rebellion was suppressed and the pretender eliminated, George went ahead to co-opt Tamar into government with him and crowned her as co-ruler in 1178. By doing so, the king attempted to preempt any dispute after his death and legitimize his line on the throne of Georgia. At the same time, he raised men from the gentry and unranked classes to keep the dynastic aristocracy away from the center of power.|$|E

5|$|The Minister Steward (Shaofu å°‘åºœ), {{also known}} as the Privy Treasurer and Small Treasurer, served the emperor exclusively, {{providing}} him with entertainment and amusements, proper food and clothing, medicine and physical care, valuables and equipment. For this purpose he was given responsibility for the emperor's personal finances during Western Han, yet this responsibility was transferred to the Minister of Finance during Eastern Han. Although he was not a <b>castrated</b> eunuch, many of his subordinates were, since his ministry managed the imperial harem housing concubines. His secretaries were headed by a Prefect of the Masters of Writing (Shangshu ling å°šæ›¸ä»¤). The secretaries were responsible for relaying all written messages to the emperor, official correspondence with Excellencies, senior ministers, provincial authorities, common people who submitted memorials to the throne, and non-Han-Chinese peoples within and outside the empire. Since the Masters of Writing were not eunuchs, and thus not allowed into the imperial harem, Emperor Wu established an all-eunuch office of secretaries for the inner palace, which was abolished in 29 BC.|$|E
5|$|The Persian {{fleet and}} army wintered at Miletus, before setting out in 493 BC to finally stamp {{out the last}} embers of the revolt. They {{attacked}} and captured the islands of Chios, Lesbos and Tenedos. On each, they made a 'human-net' of troops and swept across the whole island to flush out any hiding rebels. They then moved over to the mainland and captured each of the remaining cities of Ionia, similarly seeking out any remaining rebels. Although the cities of Ionia were undoubtedly harrowed in the aftermath, none seems to have suffered quite the fate of Miletus. Herodotus says that the Persians chose the most handsome boys from each city and <b>castrated</b> them, and chose the most beautiful girls and sent them away to the king's harem, and then burnt the temples of the cities. While this is possibly true, Herodotus also probably exaggerates the scale of devastation.

Some versions also mention that she was turned into a dry stream and that she would be condoned of her guilt when eventually the stream starts flowing and joins the river Gautami(Godavari). Indra was cursed to be <b>castrated</b> or be covered by a thousand vulvae that ultimately turn into a thousand eyes.|$|E

40|$|Of {{patients}} with <b>castrate</b> resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), less than 25 â€“ 33 % survive {{more than five}} years. Recent studies have implicated estrogen, acting either alone or synergistically with androgens {{in the development of}} <b>castrate</b> resistant prostate cancer. Several in vitro and in vivo studies, as well as a limited number of clinical trials, have highlighted the potential of selective estrogen receptor modulators, such as raloxifene (Ral) for the treatment of <b>castrate</b> resistant prostate cancer. However, the poor oral bioavailability and metabolism of selective estrogen receptor modulators limit their efficiency in clinical application. To overcome these limitations, we have used styrene co-maleic acid (SMA) micelle to encapsulate raloxifene. Compared to free drug, SMA-Ral micelles had 132 and 140 % higher cytotoxicity against PC 3 and DU 145 prostate cell lines, respectively. SMA-Ral effectively inhibits cell cycle progression, increases apoptosis, and alters the integrity of tumor spheroid models. In addition, the micellar system induced changes in expression and localization of estrogen receptors, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and downstream effectors associated with cell proliferation and survival. Finally, SMA-Ral treatment decreased migration and invasion of <b>castrate</b> resistant prostate cancer cell lines. In conclusion, SMA-Ral micelles can potentially benefit new strategies for clinical management of <b>castrate</b> resistant prostate cancer...|$|R
