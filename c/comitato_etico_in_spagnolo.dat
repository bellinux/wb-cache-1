In our routine care, irrespective of the cause of intubation and mechanical ventilation, tracheotomy is considered after 7  days of invasive mechanical ventilation for the patients for whom extubation is considered unlikely to occur in the following 3 – 5  days. If there is uncertainty or disagreement at this regard, the patient is re-evaluated after 2 – 3 additional days. Tracheotomy is performed, anyway, within 14  days after initiation of invasive mechanical ventilation in all patients. At the time of the study, there were no formal protocols for either weaning or disconnection from the ventilator. The weaning strategy for tracheotomized patients was based on the application of pressure support ventilation with progressive reduction of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and support level; the decision of disconnecting the patient was left to the discretion of the attending physician in charge.|$|R

All the diabetic patients were ≥ 40  years of age, had ≥ 10 natural teeth and had no history of long-term antibiotic use (≥ 14  days) in the 6  months preceding the study. The considered diabetic hosts (n =  25) where diagnosed with a Type II diabetes and had {{an average age of}} 58 (SD =  7.2  years). All patients older than 70 (n =  6) were excluded from the study due to various associated combordities. The tooth examination was performed by the same clinician and the dichotomous plaque index (PI) was assessed at four sites per tooth (Löe 1967). For the evaluation of caries experience, the DMFT index (number of decayed, missing and filled teeth) was used. Supragingival plaque on buccal and lingual surface was collected in 10  mL of distilled water. About 5  mL of unstimulated saliva was obtained from all subjects 2  h after the breakfast and 10  min after mouthwash with 10  mL of deionized water. The plaque and saliva samples were homogenized by ultrasonic dispersion for 20  s at 0  °C. 100  µL of these dispersed samples were spread plate on selective agar medium TSY 20 B (Trypticase Soy agar with 1  % yeast extract, 20  % sucrose and 200  IE of bacitracin) or MSB (Mitis-Salivarius agar containing 15  % sucrose, 1  % tellurite and 200  IE bacitracin) at appropriate dilutions (Gold et al. 1973; Schaeken et al. 1986).

Methods Eighty-four orthodontic participants enrolled from patients who were beginning fixed orthodontic treatment at the Orthodontic Department, Gaslini Hospital, Genova, between July and October 2014 were randomly assigned to one of three trial arms.

Methods/Design: Aim of the study is assessing the effectiveness of a non-invasive tests to guide a titrated volemic repletion before spinal anesthesia in order to reduce post-spinal hypotension rate. After local ethical committee approval of the study (<b>Comitato</b> <b>Etico</b> Cantonale Ref.  N. CE 2796), we will randomize patients undergoing elective surgery under spinal anesthesia into two parallel groups: in the first vena cava ultrasound will be used in order to assess adequacy of patients’ volemic status and consequently guide the administration of crystalloids boluses; in the second passive legs raising test will be used instead of ultrasound for the same purpose. Discussion: The hypothesis we want to test is that the using of these two experimental methods before spinal anaesthesia, compared to the standard method (empirical fluid administration) can reduce the impact of systemic hypotension through an adequate titrated volemic repletion, avoiding both hypotension and fluid overload. The final purpose is to ensure that spinal anaesthesia is performed in the safest way possible. Conclusions: The study will offer a new insight on the possible role of vena cava ultrasound and passive legs raising test as screening tools to prevent hypotension after spinal anesthesia.
