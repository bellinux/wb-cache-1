40|$|With recent {{technological}} improvements, {{fabrication of}} integrated circuit elements on shrinking scales {{is required to}} meet the demand for massive storage and fast data processing. As the fabrication of high resolution patterns requires short wavelength radiation sources, extreme ultraviolet and electron beam techniques have been developed as radiation sources for next-generation lithography. Advancements of lithography techniques accompany the evolution of resist materials for the synchronous fulfillment of high sensitivity, high resolution, and high structural integrity. Our strategy for nanofabrication is a combination of bottom-up synthesis and top-down lithography. The use of <b>cylindrical</b> <b>brush</b> polymers, which can vertically align on substrates, affords access to electron-beam-generated patterns with the minimum pixel size determined by the cylinder diameter. <b>Cylindrical</b> <b>brush</b> polymers for negative- and positive-tone photoresist materials were synthesized by controlled radical and olefin metathesis polymerization. Macromonomers with well-defined size variations were prepared by reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerization of monomers having surface energy reducing, substrate adhesion enhancing, and lithographically functioning moieties. Then, sequential ring-opening metathesis polymerization of the macromonomers via a ?grafting-through? strategy allows precise control of concentric and lengthwise dimensions and compositions in the brush polymer structures. The brush polymers consist of a rigid polymeric backbone with covalently tethered side chains which allow facile access to a cylindrical morphology due to their steric repulsion.

40|$|We {{report in}} this paper an easy method for the {{synthesis}} of <b>cylindrical</b> polymer <b>brushes</b> with dendritic side chains through anionic reaction.

The grafting reaction involves two successive steps: i) epoxidation of internal double bonds of PI segments, either in main chain or side chains; ii) ring-opening addition to the resulting epoxy group by the living PI-. b-PSLi.

40|$|We {{report the}} results of a Monte Carlo {{simulation}} study of isolated comb copolymer cylindrical brushes. The conformational characteristics of molecules consisting of a flexible backbone densely grafted with side chains strongly depend on the rigidity of the side chains, which is exemplified by using both fully flexible and totally rigid side chains. The short length scale fluctuations of the backbone are not affected by the presence of rigid rod side chains, whereas flexible side chains induce local stretching of the backbone. However, at the large length scale, the persistence length λ of the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>brush</b> is considerably larger for rigid rod side chains than for flexible side chains. Moreover, for rigid side chains the ratio between the persistence length λ and the diameter D of the brush increases approximately linearly {{as a function of the}} rod length L, thus supporting the possibility of lyotropic behavior. In contrast to this, in the case of flexible side chains, λ/D is approximately independent of the side chain length M. ...|$|E

The molecules considered consist of a flexible backbone, which is densely grafted with semiflexible side chains. The study focuses {{on the influence of}} the degree of intrinsic stiffness, λside, of the side chains on the conformational behavior of the molecules. It is demonstrated that with a fixed side chain length, M, the local length scale conformational fluctuations of the backbone increase as a function of λside. However, the persistence length, λ, of the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>brush</b> increases considerably with the side chain stiffness, indicating that the backbone becomes more extended at the large length scale.

40|$|The Ph. D. thesis {{deals with}} the {{conformational}} study of individual <b>cylindrical</b> polymer <b>brush</b> molecules using atomic force microscopy (AFM). Imaging combined with single molecule manipulation {{has been used to}} unravel questions concerning conformational changes, desorption behavior and mechanical properties of individual macromolecules and supramolecular structures. 	In {{the first part of the}} thesis (chapter 5) molecular conformations of <b>cylindrical</b> polymer <b>brushes</b> with poly-(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) side chains were studied in various environmental conditions. Also micelle formation of cylindrical brush-coil blockcopolymers with polyacrylic acid side chains and polystyrene coil have been visualized. In chapter 6 the mechanical properties of single <b>cylindrical</b> polymer <b>brushes</b> with (PNIPAM) side chains were investigated. Assuming that the brushes adopt equilibrium conformation on the surface, an average persistence length of lp= (29 ± 3) nm was determined by the end-to-end distance vs. contour length analysis in terms of the wormlike chain (WLC) model. Stretching experiments suggest that an exact determination of the persistence length using force extension curves is impeded by the contribution of the side chains. Modeling the stretching of the bottle brush molecule as extension of a dual spring (side chain and main chain) explains the frequently observed very low persistence length arising from a dominant contribution of the side chain elasticity at small overall contour lengths. It has been shown that it is possible to estimate the “true” persistence length of the bottle brush molecule from the intercept of a linear extrapolation of the inverse square root of the apparent persistence length vs. the inverse contour length plot. By virtue of this procedure a “true” persistence length of 140 nm for the PNIPAM brush molecules is predicted. 	Chapter 7 and 8 deal with the force-extension behavior of PNIPAM <b>cylindrical</b> <b>brushes</b> studied in poor solvent conditions. The behavior is shown to be qualitatively different from that in a good solvent. Force induced globule-cylinder conformational changes are monitored using “molecule specific force spectroscopy” which is a combined AFM imaging and SMFS technique. An interesting behavior of the unfolding-folding transitions of single collapsed PNIPAM brush molecules has been observed by force spectroscopy using the so called “fly-fishing” mode. A plateau force is observed upon unfolding the collapsed molecule, which is attributed to a phase transition from a collapsed brush to a stretched conformation. 	Chapter 9 describes the desorption behavior of single <b>cylindrical</b> polyelectrolyte <b>brushes</b> with poly-L-lysine side chains deposited on a mica surface using the “molecule specific force spectroscopy” technique to resolve statistical discrepancies usually observed in SMFS experiments. Imaging of the brushes and inferring the persistence length from a end-to-end distance vs. contour length analysis results in an average persistence length of lp = (25 ± 5) nm assuming that the chains adopt their equilibrium conformation on the surface. Stretching experiments carried out on individual poly-L-lysine brush molecules by force spectroscopy using the “fly-fishing” mode provide a persistence length in the range of 7 - 23 nm in reasonable accordance with the imaging results. 	In chapter 10 the conformational behavior of cylindrical poly-L-lysine brush-sodium dodecyl sulfate complexes was studied using AFM imaging. Surfactant induced cylinder to helix like to globule conformational transitions were observed...|$|R

Various correlation functions are analyzed to study the conditions when (local) Janus cylinder-type ordering and when (local) microphase separation in the direction along the cylinder axis occurs.

The developed approach gives the possibility for calculation of the scf molecular potential acting at monomers of the tethered chains. In the linear elasticity regime for stretched polymers, the molecular potential has a parabolic shape with the parameter k depending on architectural parameters of tethered macromolecules: polymerization degrees of spacers, branching functionalities, and number of generations. For dendrons of the second generation, we formulate a general equation for parameter k and analyze how variations in the architectural parameters of these dendrons affect the molecular potential. For dendrons of the third generation, an analytical expression for parameter k is available only for symmetric macromolecules with equal lengths of all spacers and equal branching functionalities in all generations. We analyze how the thickness of dendron brush in a good solvent is affected by variations in the chain architecture. Results of the developed scf theory are compared with predictions of boxlike scaling model. We demonstrate that in the limit of high branching functionalities, the results of both approaches become consistent if the value of exponent bin boxlike model is put to unity.

30|$|Although young, {{this field}} is {{developing}} rapidly; {{a number of}} important contributions have appeared in the recent literature. [1, 12, 19, 20, 21] The Meijer group showed that the molecular weight and backbone rigidity of the parent polymer does not significantly influence the SCNP fabrication induced by supramolecular interactions. Instead, the solvent {{plays a key role in}} mediating intra-molecular folding [21]. Meijer and coworkers also expanded the scope of possible architectures by successfully synthesizing SCNP from <b>cylindrical</b> <b>brush</b> block polymers as well as an orthogonally collapsible ABA triblock copolymer [6, 22]. Additionally, this group studied temperature and co-solvent induced changes in the secondary structures of benzene- 1, 3, 5 -tricarboxamides (BTA)-based SCNPs, and developed a compartmentalized metal ion SCNP sensor that shows impressive binding affinities [4, 23]. The Barner-Kowollik group demonstrated a photo-induced Diels–Alder ligation to create SCNP in addition to using metal–ligand complexation to induce controlled folding by linking chain ends [1, 24]. Other work has demonstrated that SCNP can be formed from a host of reactions including benzocylcobutene coupling [25], olefin cross-metathesis [26], azide–alkyne click chemistry [19, 27, 28, 29, 30], thiol-ene click chemistry [31, 32], Bergman cyclization [33, 34, 35], Curtius rearrangement [36], Glasser–Hay coupling [37], nitrene-mediated C-alkylation (sulfonyl azide) [38], oxidative polymerization through pendant moieties [12], benzosulfone chemistry [39], carbodiimide coupling [40], benzoxazine chemistry [11], amide bond formation [10, 31], cinnamoyl [40] and coumarin [2] photodimerization, guest–host interactions [41], hydrogen bonding [20, 42, 43, 44], and vulcanization [45].|$|E
40|$|This work {{describes}} {{the synthesis of}} {{a new class of}} rod-coil block copolymers, oligosubstituted shape persistent macrocycles, (coil-ring-coil block copolymers), and their behavior in solution and in the solid state. The coil-ring-coil block copolymers are formed by nanometer sized shape persistent macrocycles based on the phenyl-ethynyl backbone as rigid block and oligomers of polystyrene or polydimethylsiloxane as flexible blocks. The strategy that has been followed is to synthesize the macrocycles with an alcoholic functionality and the polymer carboxylic acids independently, and then bind them together by esterification. The ester bond is stable and relatively easy to form. The synthesis of the shape persistent macrocycles is based on two separate steps. In the first step the building blocks of the macrocycles are connected by Hagiara-Sogonaschira coupling to form an 2 ̆ 7 half-ring 2 ̆ 7 as precursor, that contains two free acetylenes. In the second step the half-ring is cyclized by forming two sp-sp bonds via a copper-catalyzed Glaser coupling under pseudo-high-dilution conditions. The polystyrene carboxylic acid was prepared directly by siphoning the living anionic polymer chain into a THF solution, saturated with CO 2, while the polydimethylsiloxane carboxylic acid was obtained by hydrosilylating an unsaturated benzylester with an Si-H terminated polydimethylsiloxane, and cleavage of the ester. The carbodiimide coupling was found to {{be the best way to}} connect macrocycles and polymers in high yield and high purity. The polystyrene-ring-polystyrene block copolymers are, depending on the molecular weight of the polystyrene, lyotropic liquid crystals in cyclohexane. The aggregation behavior of the copolymers in solution was investigated in more detail using several technique. As a result it can be concluded that the polystyrene-ring-polystyrene block copolymers can aggregate into hollow cylinder-like objects with an average length of 700 nm by a combination of shape complementary and demixing of rigid and flexible polymer parts. The resulting structure can be described as supramolecular hollow <b>cylindrical</b> <b>brush.</b> If the lyotropic solution of the polystyrene-ring-polystyrene block copolymers are dried, they remain birefringent indicating that the solid state has an ordered structure. The polydimethylsiloxane-ring-polydimethylsiloxane block copolymers are more or less fluid at room temperature, and are all birefringent (termotropic liquid crystals) as well. This is a prove that the copolymers are ordered in the fluid state. By a careful investigation using electron diffraction and wide-angle X-ray scattering, it has been possible to derive a model for the 3 D-order of the copolymers.

40|$|Rapid renal clearance, liver accumulation, {{proteolytic}} {{degradation and}} non-specificity are challenges small molecule drugs, peptides, proteins and nucleic acid therapeutics encounter {{en route to}} their intended destination within the body. Nanocarriers (i. e. dendritric polymers, vesicles, and micelles) of approximately 100 nm in diameter, shuttle small molecule drugs to their desired location through passive (EPR effect) and active (ligand-mediated) targeting, maximizing therapeutic efficiency. Polypeptide-based polymers are water-soluble, biocompatible, non-toxic and are therefore excellent candidates for nanocarriers. 	Dendritic polymers, including dendrimers, cylindrical brushes, and star polymers, are the newest class of nanomedicine drug delivery vehicles. The synthesis and characterization of dendritic polymers is challenging, with tedious and costly procedures. Dendritic polymers possess peripheral pendent functional groups that can potentially be used in ligand-mediated drug delivery vehicles and bioimaging applications. More specifically, cylindrical brushes are dendritic polymers where a single linear polymer (primary chain) has polymer chains (secondary chains) grafted to it. Recently, research groups have shown that <b>cylindrical</b> <b>brush</b> polymers are capable of nanoparticle and supramolecular structure self-assembly. 	The facile preparation of high-density brush copolypeptides by the "grafting from" approach will be discussed. This approach utilizes a novel, tandem catalytic methodology where alloc-&# 945;-aminoamide groups are installed within the side-chains of the &# 945;-amino-N-carboxyanhydride (NCA) monomer serving as masked initiators. These groups are inert during cobalt initiated NCA polymerization, and give alloc-&# 945;-aminoamide substituted polypeptide main-chains. The alloc-&# 945;-aminoamide groups are activated in situ using nickel to generate initiators for growth of side-chain brush segments. This method proves to be efficient, yielding well-defined, high-density brushes for applications in drug delivery and imaging. 	Here, we also report a method for the synthesis of soluble, well-defined, azido functionalized polypeptides in a straightforward, 3 -step synthesis. Homo and diblock azidopolypeptides were prepared with controlled segment lengths via living polymerization using Co(PMe 3) 4 initiator. Through copper azide alkyne click chemistry (CuAAC) in organic solvent, azidopolypeptides were regioselectively and quantitatively modified with carboxylic acid (pH-responsive), amino acid and sugar functional groups. 	Finally, the advances towards well-defined hyperbranched polypeptides through &# 945;-amino-acid-N-thiocarboxyanhydrides (NTAs) will be discussed. Within the past 10 years, controlled NCA (&# 945;-amino acid-N-carboxyanhydride) ring-opening polymerization (ROP) has emerged, expanding the application of copolypeptide polymers in various drug delivery and tissue engineering motifs. Modification of NCA monomers to the corresponding &# 945;-amino-acid-N-thiocarboxyanhydride (NTA) will diversify ROP reactions, leading to more complex polypeptides (such as hyperbranched polymers), {{in addition to the}} possibility of performing these polymerizations under ambient conditions, which would greatly expand their potential utility. The project focuses on the preparation of hyperbranched polypeptides with well-defined architectures and controlled branching density in a one-pot reaction. This will be accomplished by taking advantage of the different selectivities of Co(PMe 3) 4 and depeNi(COD) polymerization initiators, and by exploiting the reactivity difference between NCA and the more stable NTA monomers...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Cylindrical</b> {{molecular}} <b>brushes,</b> {{each with}} a gradient of grafting density along the backbone, demonstrated a transition from rodlike to tadpole conformations. Using atomic force microscopy (AFM), a coexistence of two conformational phases was observed within individual molecules adsorbed on a mica substrate. These observations were made by compressing monolayers {{on the surface of}} water and then transferring a sample of this monolayer to a mica substrate for AFM studies. Upon compression, the rod-globule transition occurs at the end where the brush is densely grafted, leaving a molecule with a globular “head ” and an extended “tail”sa so-called tadpole conformation. This research demonstrates the asymmetric changes in the molecular conformation, {{which is one of the}} prerequisites for directed motion...|$|R

For small areas, a household hand brush can work such a compound into carpet pile; working like [...] "tiny sponges", the attracted cleaning solution dissolve dirt, dirt and grime is attracted/absorbed to the compound, {{after a short}} drying time (the cleaning solution which is attracted to the compound must evaporate), it will be removed with a vacuum cleaner, the drier the better, leaving carpet immediately clean and dry. But it's very difficult to remove all residues, the residues can cause allergies and biological compounds may cause discolourations on carpets. For commercial applications, a specially designed <b>cylindrical</b> counter-rotating <b>brushing</b> system is used, without a vacuum cleaner. Machine scrubbing is more typical, in that hand scrubbing generally cleans only the top third of carpet.|$|R
40|$|We present {{theoretical}} {{arguments and}} experimental {{evidence for a}} longitudinal instability in core-shell <b>cylindrical</b> polymer <b>brushes</b> with a solvophobic inner (core) block and a solvophilic outer (shell) block in selective solvents. The two-gradient self-consistent field Scheutjens-Fleer (SCF-SF) approach and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations are employed to study a conformational transition which occurs upon {{a decrease in the}} solvent strength for the inner block from theta- to poor solvent conditions. It is found that a decrease in the solvent strength for the core block leads to an instability in the cylindrically uniform structure and the appearance of longitudinal undulations in the collapsed core of the molecular brush. This result of our modeling is in excellent agreement with experimental observations on core-shell brushes poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) core and poly(n-butyl acrylate) shell, where the core forms pearl-necklace-like structures in either a bad solvent for PAA or due to complexation with multivalent ions...|$|R
