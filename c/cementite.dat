5|$|Carbon {{combines}} {{with some}} metals at high temperatures to form metallic carbides, {{such as the}} iron carbide <b>cementite</b> in steel, and tungsten carbide, widely used as an abrasive and for making hard tips for cutting tools.|$|E
5|$|When steels with exactly 0.8% carbon (known as a {{eutectoid}} steel), are cooled, the austenitic phase (FCC) of {{the mixture}} attempts {{to revert to}} the ferrite phase (BCC). The carbon no longer fits within the FCC austenite structure, resulting in an excess of carbon. One way for carbon to leave the austenite is for it to precipitate out of solution as <b>cementite,</b> leaving behind a surrounding phase of BCC iron called ferrite with {{a small percentage of}} carbon in solution. The two, ferrite and <b>cementite,</b> precipitate simultaneously producing a layered structure called pearlite, named for its resemblance to mother of pearl. In a hypereutectoid composition (greater than 0.8% carbon), the carbon will first precipitate out as large inclusions of <b>cementite</b> at the austenite grain boundaries until the percenage of carbon in the grains has decreased to the eutectoid composition (0.8% carbon), at which point the pearlite structure forms. For steels that have less than 0.8% carbon (hypoeutectoid), ferrite will first form within the grains until the remaining composition rises to 0.8% of carbon, at which point the pearlite structure will form. No large inclusions of <b>cementite</b> will form at the boundaries in hypoeuctoid steel. The above assumes that the cooling process is very slow, allowing enough time for the carbon to migrate.|$|E
5|$|Quenching {{involves}} {{heating the}} steel {{to create the}} austenite phase then quenching it in water or oil. This rapid cooling results in a hard but brittle martensitic structure. The steel is then tempered, {{which is just a}} specialized type of annealing, to reduce brittleness. In this application the annealing (tempering) process transforms some of the martensite into <b>cementite,</b> or spheroidite and hence it reduces the internal stresses and defects. The result is a more ductile and fracture-resistant steel.|$|E
5|$|To inhibit corrosion, {{at least}} 11% {{chromium}} {{is added to}} steel so that a hard oxide forms on the metal surface; {{this is known as}} stainless steel. Tungsten slows the formation of <b>cementite,</b> keeping carbon in the iron matrix and allowing martensite to preferentially form at slower quench rates, resulting in high speed steel. On the other hand, sulfur, nitrogen, and phosphorus are considered contaminants that make steel more brittle and are removed from the steel melt during processing.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{evidence of}} the use and applications of nanotechnology {{can be traced back}} to carbon nanotubes, <b>cementite</b> nanowires found in the microstructure of wootz steel manufactured in ancient India from the time period of 600 BC and exported globally.|$|E
25|$|Wootz steel {{which is}} also known as Damascus steel was a unique and highly prized steel {{developed}} on the Indian subcontinent as early as the 5th century BC. Its properties were unique due to the special smelting and reworking of the steel creating networks of iron carbides described as a globular <b>cementite</b> in a matrix of pearlite. The use of Damascus steel in swords became extremely popular in the 16th and 17th centuries.|$|E
25|$|Elemental silicon {{is added}} to molten cast iron as {{ferrosilicon}} or silicocalcium alloys to improve performance in casting thin sections and to prevent the formation of <b>cementite</b> where exposed to outside air. The presence of elemental silicon in molten iron acts as a sink for oxygen, so that the steel carbon content, which must be kept within narrow limits {{for each type of}} steel, can be more closely controlled. Ferrosilicon production and use is a monitor of the steel industry, and although this form of elemental silicon is grossly impure, it accounts for 80% of the world's use of free silicon. Silicon is an important constituent of electrical steel, modifying its resistivity and ferromagnetic properties.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} famous steels {{produced}} in the medieval Near East was Damascus steel used for swordmaking, and mostly produced in Damascus, Syria, in the period from 900 to 1750. This was produced using the crucible steel method, based on the earlier Indian wootz steel. This process was adopted in the Middle East using locally produced steels. The exact process remains unknown, but it allowed carbides to precipitate out as micro particles arranged in sheets or bands within the body of a blade. Carbides are far harder than the surrounding low carbon steel, so swordsmiths could produce an edge that cut hard materials with the precipitated carbides, while the bands of softer steel let the sword as a whole remain tough and flexible. A team of researchers based at the Technical University of Dresden that uses X-rays and electron microscopy to examine Damascus steel discovered the presence of <b>cementite</b> nanowires and carbon nanotubes. Peter Paufler, a member of the Dresden team, says that these nanostructures give Damascus steel its distinctive properties and are a result of the forging process.|$|E
500|$|... "White" [...] {{cast irons}} contain their carbon {{in the form}} of <b>cementite,</b> or iron carbide (Fe3C). This hard, brittle {{compound}} dominates the mechanical properties of white cast irons, rendering them hard, but unresistant to shock. The broken surface of a white cast iron is full of fine facets of the broken iron-carbide, a very pale, silvery, shiny material, hence the appellation. Cooling a mixture of iron with 0.8% carbon slowly below 723°C to room temperature results in separate, alternating layers of <b>cementite</b> and ferrite, which is soft and malleable and is called pearlite for its appearance. Rapid cooling, on the other hand, does not allow time for this separation and creates hard and brittle martensite. The steel can then be tempered by reheating to a temperature in between, changing the proportions of pearlite and martensite. The end product below 0.8% carbon content is a pearlite-ferrite mixture, and that above 0.8% carbon content is a pearlite-cementite mixture.|$|E
500|$|Even in {{a narrow}} range of {{concentrations}} of mixtures of carbon and iron that make a steel, {{a number of different}} metallurgical structures, with very different properties can form. Understanding such properties is essential to making quality steel. At room temperature, the most stable form of pure iron is the body-centered cubic (BCC) structure called alpha iron or α-iron. It is a fairly soft metal that can dissolve only a small concentration of carbon, no more than 0.005% at [...] and 0.021 wt% at [...] The inclusion of carbon in alpha iron is called ferrite. At 910°C pure iron transforms into a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure, called gamma iron or γ-iron. The inclusion of carbon in gamma iron is called austenite. The more open FCC structure of austenite can dissolve considerably more carbon, as much as 2.1% (38 times that of ferrite) carbon at , which reflects the upper carbon content of steel, beyond which is cast iron. When carbon moves out of solution with iron it forms a very hard, but brittle material called <b>cementite</b> (Fe3C).|$|E
2500|$|Once {{the disc}} has {{some level of}} {{variation}} in thickness, uneven pad deposition can accelerate, sometimes resulting in changes to the crystal structure of the metal that composes the disc in extreme situations. As the brakes are applied, the pads slide over the varying disc surface. As the pads pass by the thicker section of the disc, they are forced outwards. The foot of the driver applied to the brake pedal naturally resists this change, and thus more {{force is applied to}} the pads. The result is that the thicker sections see higher levels of stress. This causes an uneven heating of the surface of the disc, which causes two major issues. As the brake disc heats unevenly it also expands unevenly. The thicker sections of the disc expand more than the thinner sections due to seeing more heat, and thus the difference in thickness is magnified. Also, the uneven distribution of heat results in further uneven transfer of pad material. The result is that the thicker-hotter sections receive even more pad material than the thinner-cooler sections, contributing to a further increase in the variation in the disc's thickness. In extreme situations, this uneven heating can actually cause the crystal structure of the disc material to change. When the hotter sections of the discs reach extremely high temperatures ( [...] ), the metal can undergo a phase transformation and the carbon which is dissolved in the steel can precipitate out to form carbon-heavy carbide regions known as <b>cementite.</b> This iron carbide {{is very different from the}} cast iron the rest of the disc is composed of. It is extremely hard, very brittle, and does not absorb heat well. After <b>cementite</b> is formed, the integrity of the disc is compromised. Even if the disc surface is machined, the <b>cementite</b> within the disc will not wear or absorb heat at the same rate as the cast iron surrounding it, causing the uneven thickness and uneven heating characteristics of the disc to return.|$|E
50|$|Heating {{white cast}} iron above 727 C causes the {{formation}} of austenite in crystals of primary <b>cementite.</b> This austenisation of white iron occurs in primary <b>cementite</b> at the interphase boundary with ferrite. When the grains of austenite form in <b>cementite,</b> they occur as lamellar clusters oriented along the <b>cementite</b> crystal layer surface. Austenite is formed by diffusion of carbon atoms from <b>cementite</b> into ferrite.|$|E

50|$|<b>Cementite</b> is {{essentially}} a ceramic, which accounts for the sharpness of the Damascus (and bulat) steel. <b>Cementite</b> is unstable and breaks down between 600-1100 °C into ferrite and carbon, so working the hot metal must be done very carefully.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Molar volume vs. {{pressure}} for <b>cementite</b> at room temperature.|$|E
50|$|A {{hypereutectoid}} steel {{contains more than}} 0.77% carbon. When slowly cooling a {{hypereutectoid steel}}, the <b>cementite</b> will begin to crystallize first. When the remaining steel becomes eutectoid in composition, it will crystallize into pearlite. Since <b>cementite</b> is much harder than pearlite, the alloy has greater hardenability at a cost in the ductility.|$|E
5000|$|In the iron-carbon system (i.e. plain-carbon steels {{and cast}} irons) it {{is a common}} {{constituent}} because ferrite can contain at most 0.02wt% of uncombined carbon. Therefore, in carbon steels and cast irons that are slowly cooled, a portion of the carbon {{is in the form of}} <b>cementite.</b> [...] <b>Cementite</b> forms directly from the melt in the case of white cast iron. In carbon steel, <b>cementite</b> precipitates from austenite as austenite transforms to ferrite on slow cooling, or from martensite during tempering. An intimate mixture with ferrite, the other product of austenite, forms a lamellar structure called pearlite.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first stage}} of {{tempering}} occurs between room-temperature and 200 C. In the first stage, carbon precipitates into ε-carbon (Fe24C). In the second stage, occurring between 150 C and 300 C, the retained austenite transforms into a form of lower-bainite containing ε-carbon rather than <b>cementite</b> (archaically referred to as [...] "troostite"). The third stage occurs at 200 C and higher. In the third stage, ε-carbon precipitates into <b>cementite,</b> and the carbon content in the martensite decreases. If tempered at higher temperatures, between 650 C and 700 C, or for longer amounts of time, the martensite may become fully ferritic and the <b>cementite</b> may become coarser or spheroidize. In spheroidized steel, the <b>cementite</b> network breaks apart and recedes into rods or spherical shaped globules, and the steel becomes softer than annealed steel; nearly as soft as pure iron, making it very easy to form or machine.|$|E
50|$|Similar iron {{carbides}} occur also {{in technical}} iron alloys and are called <b>cementite.</b>|$|E
50|$|Carbon steel {{consists}} of two components: pure iron, {{in the form of}} ferrite, and <b>cementite</b> or iron carbide, a compound of iron and carbon. <b>Cementite</b> is very hard and brittle; its hardness is about 640 by the Brinell hardness test, whereas ferrite is only 200. The amount of the carbon and the cooling regimen determine the crystalline and chemical composition of the final steel. In bulat, the slow cooling process allowed the <b>cementite</b> to precipitate as micro particles in between ferrite crystals and arrange in random patterns. The color of the carbide is dark while steel is grey. This mixture is what leads to the famous patterning of Damascus steel.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cementite</b> {{changes from}} {{ferromagnetic}} to paramagnetic at its Curie temperature of approximately 480 K.|$|E

50|$|In {{iron and}} steel metallurgy, {{ledeburite}} {{is a mixture of}} 4.3% carbon in iron and is a eutectic mixture of austenite and <b>cementite.</b> Ledeburite is not a type of steel as the carbon level is too high although it may occur as a separate constituent in some high carbon steels. It is mostly found with <b>cementite</b> or pearlite in a range of cast irons.|$|E
50|$|The {{eutectoid}} {{composition of}} austenite is approximately 0.76% carbon; steel with less carbon content (hypoeutectoid steel) will contain a corresponding proportion of relatively pure ferrite crystallites {{that do not}} participate in the eutectoid reaction and cannot transform into pearlite. Likewise steels with higher carbon content (hypereutectoid steels) will form <b>cementite</b> before reaching the eutectoid point. The proportion of ferrite and <b>cementite</b> forming above the eutectoid point can be calculated from the iron/iron—carbide equilibrium phase diagram using the lever rule.|$|E
50|$|When steels with exactly 0.8% carbon (known as a {{eutectoid}} steel), are cooled, the austenitic phase (FCC) of {{the mixture}} attempts {{to revert to}} the ferrite phase (BCC).

50|$|Ledeburite {{arises when}} the carbon content is between 2.06% and 6.67%. The {{eutectic}} mixture of austenite and <b>cementite</b> is 4.3% carbon, Fe3C:2Fe, with a melting point of 1147 °C.|$|E
50|$|Steels with {{pearlitic}} (eutectoid composition) or near-pearlitic microstructure (near-eutectoid composition) can {{be drawn}} into thin wires. Such wires, often bundled into ropes, are commercially used as piano wires, ropes for suspension bridges, and as steel cord for tire reinforcement. High degrees of wire drawing (logarithmic strain above 3) leads to pearlitic wires with yield strengths of several gigapascals. It makes pearlite {{one of the strongest}} structural bulk materials on earth.Some hypereutectoid pearlitic steel wires, when cold wire drawn to true (logarithmic) strains above 5, can even show a maximal tensile strength above 6 GPa. Although pearlite is used in many engineering applications, the origin of its extreme strength is not well understood. It has been recently shown that cold wire drawing not only strengthens pearlite by refining the lamellae structure, but also simultaneously causes partial chemical decomposition of <b>cementite,</b> associated with an increased carbon content of the ferrite phase, and even a structural transition from crystalline to amorphous <b>cementite.</b> The deformation-induced decomposition and microstructural change of <b>cementite</b> is closely related to several other phenomena such as a strong redistribution of carbon and other alloy elements like Si and Mn in both the <b>cementite</b> and the ferrite phase; a variation of the deformation accommodation at the phase interfaces due to a change in the carbon concentration gradient at the interfaces; and mechanical alloying.|$|E

50|$|Type 1 telluric iron {{contains}} {{a significant amount}} of carbon. Type 1 is a white nickel cast-iron, containing 1.7 to 4% carbon and 0.05 to 4% nickel, which is very hard and brittle and does not respond well to cold working. The structure of type 1 consists mainly of pearlite and <b>cementite</b> or cohenite, with inclusions of troilite and silicate. The individual ferrite grains are typically about a millimeter in size. Although the composition of the grains may vary, even within the same grain, they are mostly composed of fairly pure nickel-ferrite. The ferrite grains are connected with <b>cementite</b> laminations; typically 5 to 25 micrometers thick; forming the pearlite.|$|E
