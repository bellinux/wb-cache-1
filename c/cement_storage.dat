Specimens were stored for 24 h in deionized water and immersed in saline (pH 7. 0) or 0. 1 M lactic acid solution (pH 4. 0) for 15 days.

40|$|A new {{approach}} is proposed to analyze {{small amounts of}} polymer in a cement paste {{by means of a}} dynamic mechanical thermoanalyser. The polymer-cement ratio is determined from the drop in the storage modulus E' at the glass transition of the polymer. Different calibration curves are determined by analyzing the viscoelastic behaviour of the polymer in the <b>cement</b> from <b>storage</b> or loss moduli and the dissipation factor tan delta. This technique is very sensitive, which makes it possible to calculate a polymer rate accuracy better than +/- 5 %, even {{in the case of a}} very porous material, when the polymer rate is lower than 10 % by weight.

40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} the micro-hardness profile of two dual cure resin cements (RelyX - U 100 (R), 3 M-ESPE and Panavia F 2. 0 (R), Kuraray) used for cementing fiber-reinforced resin posts (Fibrekor (R) - Jeneric Pentron) under three different curing protocols and two water storage times. Material and methods: Sixty 16 mm long bovine incisor roots were endodontically treated {{and prepared for}} cementation of the Fibrekor posts. The cements were mixed as instructed, dispensed in the canal, the posts were seated and the curing performed as follows: a) no light activation; b) light-activation immediately after seating the post, and; c) light-activation delayed 5 minutes after seating the post. The teeth were stored in water and retrieved for analysis after 7 days and 3 months. The roots were longitudinally sectioned and the microhardness was determined at the cervical, middle and apical regions along the cement line. The data was analyzed by the three-way ANOVA test (curing mode, storage time and thirds) for each cement. The Tukey test {{was used for the}} post-hoc analysis. Results: Light-activation resulted in {{a significant increase in the}} microhardness. This was more evident for the cervical region and for the Panavia <b>cement.</b> <b>Storage</b> in water for 3 months caused a reduction of the micro-hardness for both cements. The U 100 cement showed less variation in the micro-hardness regardless of the curing protocol and storage time. Conclusions: The micro-hardness of the cements was affected by the curing and storage variables and were material-dependent. FAPESP [07 / 02612 - 2]CNPq [307510 / 2010 - 7]CAPES (Brazil...|$|E

40|$|Steel trusses are {{the most}} popular system for {{supporting}} long span roofs in commercial buildings, such as warehouses and aircraft hangars. There are several advantages of steel trusses, such as lightweight, ease of handling and erection, and geometric flexibility. However, they have some drawbacks, such as high material and maintenance cost, and low fire resistance. In this paper, a precast concrete truss is proposed as an alternative to steel trusses for spans up to 160 ft. without intermediate supports. The proposed design is easy to produce and has lower construction and maintenance costs than steel trusses. The proposed design is an evolution of the system that was developed by e. Construct USA, LLC and was used in the construction of a <b>cement</b> <b>storage</b> facility at United Arab of Emirates. The proposed truss design consists of two segments that are formed using standard bridge girder forms (PCI and AASHTO girders) with block-outs in the web that result in having diagonals and vertical sections. The two segments are then connected using a wet joint and post-tensioned longitudinally. The proposed design optimizes the truss-girder member locations, cross-sections, and material use. A Finite Element Analysis for the truss-girder system is conducted to investigate stresses at truss connections and the wet joint. A 30 -foot long truss specimen is constructed at the structural laboratory of UNL to investigate the constructability of the truss and the structural capacity of the diagonals, verticals, and connections. Testing results indicate the production and structural efficiency of the developed system. Adviser: George Morcous and Maher K. Tadro...|$|E

40|$|Master's thesis in Petroleum engineeringThe {{foremost}} goal {{of primary}} cementing {{is to provide}} zonal isolation in a well. Cementing of the casing/liner set right above the reservoir on the Ekofisk and Eldfisk fields {{are associated with a}} lot of challenges. Depletion and water flooding of a reservoir makes drilling and cementing increasingly difficult. At the Ekofisk and Eldfisk fields, the operational window above the reservoir is very narrow and difficult to predict due to the regression of fracture pressure the last 200 ft above the reservoir. This coupled with the natural faults and fractures in this area makes lost circulation a hindrance to provide zonal isolation. Cement history on the two fields shows that there is a very low chance of achieving required casing cement isolation. Historical practices within the last two years have been analysed trying to find the root causes of any failure to meet the company requirements. A review of potential solutions to solve the issue has been presented. Different studies have been made, including hydraulic simulations, to come up with suggestions on how to reach the cement target for the two fields. In addition, simulations on how to cement the entire Miocene section were performed. A study performed in WellPlanTM-Opticem revealed that there still exist some challenges before the cement design and real time jobs can be properly imported and analysed in the software. During the work lack of <b>cement</b> job data <b>storage</b> system was discovered. A new way of <b>cement</b> data <b>storage</b> was suggested and established. Collection and analyses of cement jobs during the last two years on the M-wells was performed in order to investigate if there was a trend between lost circulation and different parameters. No clear trend was found. Hydraulic simulations were performed to investigate how different parameters impact the equivalent circulating density. A colloidal light weight cement was utilized in the simulations. The main results from the simulations showed that; Warp OBM is superior to Versatec OBM system from a well cementing perspective, the expandable liner hanger imposed a very high ECD and the liner hanger dimensions needs {{to be taken into account}} in hydraulic simulations. The overall outcome of the simulations indicates a possible solution on how to cement back to the previous casing shoe...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effects of long-term storage on the microtensile bond strength (µTBS) to dentin of two self-adhesive and three multi-step resin cements. Two self-adhesive cements RelyX U 100 (U 100) and seT PP (SET), and 3 multi-step resin cements, one using 2 -step etch-and-rinse adhesive AllCem (ALC), and two conventional resin cements with self-etching primer Panavia F (PAN) and Multilink (MULT) were used. Human molars were restored (n= 5), sectioned and subjected to the &# 956;TBS test after 24 h and 6 months. Fractured specimens were examined by stereomicroscope and SEM. The µTBS were analyzed by one-way ANOVA and Tukey test (&# 945;= 0. 05). ANOVA revealed a difference between groups (p< 0. 0001). All multi-step resin cements ALC, MULT and PAN showed statistically similar bond strength values that were higher than those of the U 100 and SET groups. The bond strength value of ALC, MULT and PAN decreases significantly after 6 months. The majority of the failures were adhesive for all the groups. The µTBS produced by the self-adhesive cements were significantly lower than those observed for multi-step luting agents.
