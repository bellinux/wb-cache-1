This was the incident of February 21, 1973, when Libyan Arab Airlines Flight 114 was shot down by Israeli F-4 jets over the Sinai Peninsula. ICAO convention required the state in whose territory the accident had taken place (the Soviet Union) to conduct an investigation together with the <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>registration</b> (South Korea), the country whose air traffic control the aircraft was flying under (Japan), {{as well as the}} aircraft's manufacturer (Boeing).|$|E

5000|$|Imported {{used cars}} are {{registered}} based on year <b>of</b> first <b>registration</b> in their <b>country</b> <b>of</b> original <b>registration</b> rather than year of import. Each county had continuous sequence numbers for vehicles so {{if a new}} car registered on 31 December 2010 was 10 D 37456, then the next registered car from 2010 registered in 2011 would be 10 D 37457. This changed in late 2011 when each county (prior to 2010) had their next available sequence number increased dramatically for no particular reason other than being easily identified as an [...] "import". For example, 10-D-120006 would be the 6th import in Dublin of a car from 2010, as Dublin's re-registration band starts at 120000. Meath's starts at 15000.|$|R

40|$|Advances in {{pharmaceuticals}} offer improved {{health outcomes}} {{for a wide}} range of illnesses, yet medicines are often inaccessible for many patients worldwide. One potential barrier to making medicines available to all is the cost <b>of</b> product <b>registration,</b> the fees for regulatory review and licensing for the sale of medicines beyond the cost of clinical trials, if needed. We performed a cross-sectional analysis <b>of</b> pharmaceutical <b>registration</b> fees in low-, middle-, and high-income countries. We collected data on market authorization fees for new chemical entities and for generic drugs in 95 countries. We calculated measures <b>of</b> <b>registration</b> fee size relative to population, gross domestic product (GDP), and total health spending in each <b>country.</b> Each <b>of</b> the 95 <b>countries</b> had a fee for registering new chemical entities. On average, the ratio <b>of</b> <b>registration</b> fees to GDP was highest in Europe and North America and lowest in South and Central America. Across individual <b>countries,</b> the level <b>of</b> <b>registration</b> fees was positively correlated with GDP and total health spending, with relatively few outliers. We find that, generally speaking, the regulatory fees charged by medicines regulatory authorities are roughly proportional to the market size in their jurisdictions. The data therefore do not support the hypothesis that regulatory fees are a barrier to market entry in most countries...|$|R

40|$|The {{analysis}} of services is difficult, {{due to a}} lack of appropriate statistical data. In this context, service marks prove to be an interesting novel indicator, showing a significant correlation to innovation. They allow the examination of structures and specialisation in service subsectors, in particular with regard to knowledge-intensive services. Furthermore, it is possible to analyse the area of product-accompanying services in more detail. The recent introduction of European marks has considerably improved the opportunities for country comparison. As the use of service marks as an innovation indicator is still in an early phase, it will be necessary to get more experiences with regard to sectors, <b>countries</b> and offices <b>of</b> <b>registration...</b>|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: We {{sought to}} assess {{the current status of}} global data on death {{registration}} and to examine several indicators of data completeness and quality. METHODS: We summarized the availability <b>of</b> death <b>registration</b> data by year and <b>country.</b> Indicators <b>of</b> data quality were assessed for each country and included the timeliness, completeness and coverage <b>of</b> <b>registration</b> and the proportion of deaths assigned to ill-defined causes. FINDINGS: At the end of 2003 data on death registration were available from 115 countries, although they were essentially complete for only 64 <b>countries.</b> Coverage <b>of</b> death <b>registration</b> varies from close to 100 % in the WHO European Region to less than 10 % in the African Region. Only 23 countries have data that are more than 90 % complete, where ill-defined causes account for less than 10 % of total of causes of death, and where ICD- 9 or ICD- 10 codes are used. There are 28 countries where less than 70 % of the data are complete or where ill-defined codes are assigned to more than 20 % of deaths. Twelve high-income countries in western Europe are included among the 55 countries with intermediate-quality data. CONCLUSION: Few countries have good-quality data on mortality {{that can be used to}} adequately support policy development and implementation. There is an urgent need for countries to implement death registration systems, even if only through sample registration, or enhance their existing systems in order to rapidly improve knowledge about the most basic of health statistics: who dies from what...|$|R
