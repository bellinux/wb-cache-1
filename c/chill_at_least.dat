Investigating the crime, he discovers that <b>Chill,</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> in this timeline, did not commit the murder. Once he returns to his proper time, Bruce Wayne is plagued with doubt. He wonders if it is possible that he never actually caught or confronted his parents' killer. He also wonders if that makes any difference regarding his crimefighting career.

25|$|Modern {{trawlers}} {{store the}} fish they catch {{in some form}} of <b>chilled</b> condition. <b>At</b> the <b>least,</b> the fish will be stored in boxes covered with ice or stored with ice in the fish hold. In general, the fish are kept fresh by chilling them with ice or refrigerated sea water, or freezing them in blocks. Also, many trawlers carry out some measure of onboard fish processing, and the larger the vessel, {{the more likely it is}} to include fish processing facilities. For example, the catch can undergo some preliminary processing by being passed through sorting and washing devices. At a further stage, the fish might be mechanically gutted and filleted. Factory trawlers may process fish oil and fish meal and may include canning plants.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} feeding Zilpaterol {{hydrochloride}} (ZH) with a 3 or 10 d withdrawal (WD) period to calf-fed Holstein steers (N= 2993) on carcass characteristics and tenderness were evaluated in a feed lot experiment. Cattle were fed 0 or 8. 3 mg/kg of ZH {{for the final}} 20 d of the feeding period, each treatment level was assigned a WD period of either 3 or 10 d. Treatment groups consisted of Control 3 d WD (C 3) and 10 d WD (C 10), and ZH fed 3 day WD (Z 3) and 10 d WD (Z 10). Cattle were slaughtered at a commercial facility, carcasses <b>chilled</b> for <b>at</b> <b>least</b> 40 hours and carcass characteristics evaluated by trained personnel. Loins (n= 60) {{were randomly selected from}} each treatment group for Warner Bratzler Shear (WBS) analysis. Rib-eye area (REA) increased 3. 8 cm 2 for ZH fed 3 day WD cattle (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) when compared to control, and 5. 4 cm 2 for ZH fed 10 day withdrawal cattle (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) when compared to control. There {{was no significant difference in}} REA between ZH fed 3 and 10 d WD periods (P 3 ̆e 0. 05). A trend was observed for ZH fed 10 d WD cattle to have an increased hot carcass weight when compared to control (P= 0. 0589), while there was no significant difference for cattle fed ZH with a 3 day WD (P= 0. 3763) comparatively.

40|$|Strawberry (Fragaria ananasa) is a {{berry fruit}} {{belonging}} to the family Rosaceae and requires certain amount of cold temperature to initiate flowering. Present {{study was conducted with}} the objective to study flowering and fruiting responses of strawberry to growth hormone and chilling under tunnel conditions. The study comprised of six different treatments as; control, GA 3 (gibberellic acid) 200 ppm, GA 3 400 ppm, <b>chilling</b> <b>at</b> 4 °C, <b>chilling</b> <b>at</b> 4 °C + GA 3 200 ppm and <b>chilling</b> <b>at</b> 4 °C + GA 3 400 ppm. Treatments were applied at vegetative stage before flowering. It was inferred from the study that strawberry plants responded much better to application of GA 3 at 400 ppm for their growth, flower stimulation, their number, quality features while <b>chilling</b> <b>at</b> 4 °C proved better for maximum fruit production and better quality under tunnel condition...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. For the {{regeneration}} niche {{to contribute}} to the main-tenance of species diversity interspecific differences in sensi-tivity of seedling recruitment to environmental conditions is assumed. We experimentally tested differences between meadow species for the response of seed germination to chilling, and sensitivity of seedling recruitment to microscale heterogeneity. We also compared the dynamics of seedling recruitment in gaps. Seed germination was tested in standard laboratory germi-nation tests, comparing control seeds with seeds <b>chilled</b> <b>at</b> + 4 °C, and at – 14 °C for one month. Species responses varied from significant increases in germinability after chilling (e. g. Cirsium palustre, Betonica officinalis, Angelica sylvestris) to significant decreases (e. g. Hieracium umbellatum, Succisa pratensis, Selinum carvifolia). In some species, <b>chilling</b> <b>at</b> + 4 °C has a similar effect to <b>chilling</b> <b>at</b> – 14 °C, in others th...|$|R
