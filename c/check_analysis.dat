The {{main source of}} information is the structural components, including the relations among them and how they might be structurally arranged. These relations are studied to generate valuable information for EA professionals. However, {{to the best of}} our knowledge, ours is the first attempt to combine structural information with a second source of information: expert's tacit knowledge. We believe combining these sources employing two new methods - what we call cognitive-structural diagnosis analysis and attribute <b>check</b> <b>analysis</b> - can refine the expert's knowledge about the architecture. To demonstrate these methods' feasibility, we apply them with two application architecture datasets collected in two different organizations. We also offer a classification schema for enterprise architecture network analysis at the component level, our focus.

The attribute <b>check</b> <b>analysis</b> offers further contributions by helping in the investigation of particular attributes of applications in important architectural positions...|$|E

This paper will describe particular methods chosen to implement a Courtesy Amount Block Locator (CABL). First, the connected components in the image are identified. Next, strings are constructed on the basis of proximity and horizontal alignment of characters. Finally a set of rules and heuristics are applied to these strings to choose the correct one.

The main {{features}} of Chinese kangs include the effective use of thermal mass in kang plate. In this paper, a thermal and airflow model for an elevated kang is developed with a simply consideration of the heat transfer in building envelope. Approximate analytical formulas are derived to identify the critical parameters that affect the levels and fluctuations of kang plate temperature and indoor air temperature. It can be observed that the increase of the plate time constant and the heat source frequency with continuous firings and equally distributing the firings and adding the number of firing with intermittent firings can effectively decrease the fluctuation of kang plate temperature and indoor air temperature.

40|$|Abstract. Precise dynamic race {{detectors}} {{report an}} error if {{and only if}} an observed program trace exhibits a data race. They must typically check for races on all memory accesses to ensure that they catch all races and generate no spurious warnings. However, a race check for a particular memory access is guaranteed to be redundant if the accessing thread has already accessed that location within the same release-free span. A release-free span is any sequence of instructions containing no lock releases or other “release-like ” synchronization operations, such as notify or fork. We present a static analysis to identify redundant race checks by reasoning about memory accesses within release-free spans. In contrast to prior whole program analyses for identifying accesses that are always race-free, our redundant <b>check</b> <b>analysis</b> is span-local and can also be made methodlocal without any major loss in effectiveness. RedCard, our prototype implementation for the Java language, enables dynamic race detectors {{to reduce the number of}} run-time checks by close to 40 % with no loss in precision. We also present a complementary shadow proxy analysis for identifying when multiple memory locations can be treated as a single location by a dynamic race detector, again with no loss in precision. Combined, our analyses reduce the number of memory accesses requiring checks by roughly 50 %. ...|$|E
