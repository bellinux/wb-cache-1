40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{was to examine the}} demand for cross {{directional}} control of basis weight on a board machine. To analyse the demand, changes made by the control system are studied. The significant changes were expected to be present when a major event occurred on the machine. The events classified as major were changes in basis weight, of grade or of coating blade. Break of board and stoppage of the machine were also included. These events can be seen as large disturbances to the machine. In order to identify the disturbances a methodology had to be developed. The methodology developed is to analyse the output from a model with the actuators of the control system as input and measurement of basis weight as output. The analysis of this output was done using the multivariate method of principal component analysis. The data analysed in this thesis was collected on-line from a board machine operating within the Stora Enso group. Over a period of 3 months, a total of 47 sets of data were collected, each set representing 12 - 14 hours. The data analysis shows that the variations in the control system are greater than the variation in the measured basis weight. This is a strong indication that the control system is needed and in order to find disturbances in the cross directional profile it is not enough only to analyse the final product, the control signals also have to be analysed. The large disturbances do not necessarily emerge from the major events as assumed. Other causes might havelarger impact to the process then first believed. One of the major obstacles in trying to explain the variations is that the basis weight is controlled by using the <b>centre</b> <b>layer</b> of the board but measured on the final product. This leads {{to the fact that the}} errors seen by the measuring system can result from anything on the machine and be compensated by basis weight in the <b>centre</b> <b>layer</b> of the board...|$|E

40|$|The quench {{sensitivity}} of high strength 7 xxx series aluminium alloys becomes {{an increasingly important}} issue as the product thickness increases. Due {{to the nature of}} thermal conduction, the <b>centre</b> <b>layer</b> of a thick aluminium plate experiences a slower cooling rate than the surface. This can lead to variations in properties such as strength, corrosion resistance and fracture toughness across the thickness of a plate. The objective of this work was to study the quench-induced precipitation behaviour in different 7 xxx alloys with systematic changes of alloy composition and processing history. Detailed microstructural analysis has been carried out using SEM, EBSD, TEM and HAADF-HRTEM. Vickers hardness values, electrical conductivities and the precipitation heats determined from differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were measured {{for a wide range of}} different cooling rate conditions to evaluate the different quench sensitivity behaviours. The main findings from this work are as follows: 1. The results show that the Al 3 Zr dispersoids in recrystallised grains can become preferential nucleation sites for quench-induced precipitates in air cooling condition. The microstructural characterisation shows that the Al 3 Zr dispersoids tend to maintain their metastable structure and orientation when recrystallisation occurs. This causes them to lose coherency with the matrix after recrystallisation and thereby causes them to become more potent heterogeneous nucleation sites for quench-induced precipitation. It should be noted that incoherent Al 3 Zr dispersoids are not the only preferential sites for quench-induced precipitates. They can precipitate out at grain/subgrain boundaries in air cooling condition. However, the current research still demonstrates that materials containing a higher fraction of recrystallisation will lead to a significant increase of quench sensitivity. 2. The precipitation heats for quench-induced precipitates have been studied using a specialised DSC technique over a wide range of cooling rate conditions. A continuous cooling precipitation (CCP) diagram for commercially produced alloy 7150 has been developed based on a combination of DSC measurements, microstructure analysis and hardness testing. The results show that there are three main quench-induced precipitation located in different temperature ranges. It is demonstrated that the high temperature reaction from about 350 to 470 °C corresponds to S-phase (Al 2 CuMg), the medium temperature reaction from about 200 to 400 °C corresponds to M-phase (MgZn 2) and the low temperature reaction from about 250 to 150 °C corresponds to a unique platelet phase containing both Cu and Zn. The critical cooling rates were determined to be 3 K/s for the S-phase, 10 K/s for the M-phase, and 300 K/s for the unique platelet phase in alloy 7150. The platelet phase has not been previously reported for alloy 7150. The platelets precipitate with a high aspect ratio and have a hexagonal structure (a= 0. 429 nm, c= 1. 385 nm) according to HAADF-STEM images. It is shown that this platelet phase can contribute to strengthening. 3. It was shown that the surface layer of a 7150 thick plate is more sensitive to cooling rate than the <b>centre</b> <b>layer.</b> This can be ascribed to a relatively higher degree of recrystallisation in the surface layer. Therefore there are more nucleation sites for quench-induced precipitates in the same cooling condition. It was confirmed with DSC analysis that the precipitation heat values for the surface layer are higher than for the <b>centre</b> <b>layer,</b> demonstrating that there is more quench-induced precipitation occuring in the surface layer. 4. A number of CCP diagrams were developed for alloys 7085, 7037, 7020 and 7055 with systematic changes in alloy composition. It is demonstrated that the quench sensitivity generally increases with increasing total alloy content. Therefore alloy 7020 exhibits the lowest quench sensitivity when compared with the other studied alloys. It is noted that the amount of M-phase increases with increasing Zn content. Therefore alloys 7085, 7037 and 7055 can precipitate more M-phase during slow cooling than alloys 7150 and 7020. However, the precipitation of S-phase during continuous cooling was found to be significantly suppressed with increasing Zn/Mg ratio. Quench factor analysis (QFA) also indicates that higher k 3 values can be found for the higher Zn/Mg ratio alloys 7085 and 7037, suggesting that the energy required to form a nucleus is higher in these two alloys. This is in agreement with experimental observations that these two alloys contained less S-phase and exhibited relatively low quench sensitivities. It was shown that the CCP diagrams provide a useful method of quantifying the quench sensitivities of different alloys. The CCP diagrams can also facilitate engineers to design and optimise industrial cooling process more effectively. However, it requires a deep understating of the quench-induced precipitation to develop a reliable CCP diagram for a given alloy, i. e. what types of quench-induced precipitation reactions happen, where they preferentially nucleate and how many much precipitation occurs during the cooling process. The current research therefore shows that the quench {{sensitivity of}} a 7 xxx alloy can be decreased by decreasing the degree of deformation, decreasing the fraction of recrystallisition, decreasing the total grain boundary area, decreasing the number of incoherent dispersoids, decreasing the total alloying content, increasing the Zn/Mg ratio and decreasing the Cu content...|$|E

T & G radiata pine boards, the <b>centre</b> <b>layer</b> running {{at right angles to}} the outer layers. The fastenings were three densities of nailing and one of nail-gluing. Timber properties were characterised by grading modulus (g. m.) which was the stiffness of prototype boards on the flat under centre point loading over a 3 ft span while the fastenings were characterised by the load-slip behaviour of representative joints. The joint behaviour showed little correlation with g. m. Prototype and 1 / 5 scale model elements were tested in compression shear, bending and torsion and elastic constants were computed. The various constants were affected to different degrees by the four types of fastening according to the level of stress carried by the fastening under the various element loadings. The model similitude obtained in the elements was good when this was based on g. m., the load-slip behaviour of representative joints and the weight of glue spread per unit area of glueline. Two 1 / 5 scale model cylindrical timber shells were built and tested, one nailed and the other nail-glued. Their deflections were about twice those calculated by a simplified analysis for orthotropic shells. Their relative behaviour was similar to the relative behaviour of the model elements in shear which suggests that the discrepancy between calculated and observed deflections arose from shear deformation which the analysis ignored...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a numerical {{study of the}} response of impulsively loaded circular sandwich plates using the general purpose finite element programme called ABAQUS. The sandwich plate studied consists of three layers. The two outer layers are of mild steel and the <b>centre</b> <b>layer,</b> or core, is of air. Because of this configuration, the analysis is split into two sections. The first {{is the study of}} impulsively loaded circular single plates and the second is the study of the interaction of the outer layers of the sandwich plate on each other. The plates are analysed in the impulse range that results in large plastic deformations known as Mode I Failure. Mode II and III failure of the plates, where failure by tearing occurs, is omitted. The results of the single plate analysis are compared to experimental and analytical work. Criteria for comparison include mid-plate deflections, strain rate dependence, strain predictions, plate thinning, deformation shape and response time. The results of the sandwich plate analysis are compared to experimental data and the criteria for comparison include mid-plate deflections and the diameter of the contact area of the two outer layers. Other aspects of the plate behaviour such as response times and the amount of strain energy absorbed are also discussed. The explicit integration scheme is considered the best finite element solution method to use for this dynamic response problem. The pressure loading model is found to give the best correlation with experimental data while velocity loading models tend to result in instabilities in the explicit solution scheme. The presented results for both the single plates and the sandwich plates show good correlation with the experimental data. In the case of the sandwich plates, the predicted contact diameters show good correlation with the experimental work. The phases of deformation evident in the sandwich plate experimental work are not evident in the presented results, while the mid plate deflection predictions show correct trends, but over estimate the experimental data...|$|E
40|$|Splicing {{technology}} {{is used to}} create fuselage panels due to the maximum width of the aluminium sheets of 60 inches {{as a result of}} the production process. A set of designing rules is required for the design of a spliced Glare fuselage resulting in a significant increase in complexity. Friction stir welding of the thin aluminium sheets in Glare results in larger Glare panels where the maximum dimensions are limited by the size of the autoclave. FSW Glare could result in reduced weight and production cost, and perhaps as well as having enhanced mechanical properties. But welding defects could occur which will compromise fatigue properties. Fatigue and damage tolerant properties of FSW Glare with welding defects are investigated, and recommendations are given in this thesis. Friction stir welding generally does not produce defects that are common to conventional welding technologies, such as warping and porosity. Instead unique defects can occur, such as the zig zag curve or lazy S defect, where the oxide particles of the aluminium are present in a concentrated form. Another typical form of defect is the tunnel defect, also know as the channel, cavity, or void defect. A physical channel is present in the cross section of the weld, which is not visible looking at the surface of the welded sheet. A similar defect is the groove defect where the absence of material is at the surface which makes it visible and tangible. Nevertheless, friction stir welding is a robust process where a wide range of welding parameters result in a defect free weld. Friction stir welding results in much more favourable fatigue properties compared to conventional welding methods, and S-N data lie well above the FAT 40 design curve. Welding parameters, such as welding speed and tool pressure, as well as tool geometry play an important role in fatigue properties. Defects as a result of improper welding parameters have a large impact on fatigue properties. Surface properties of the weld also impact fatigue properties; post machining the rough surface results in improvements. Static properties are also favourable with friction stir welding. Two sets of FSW sheets with a welding defect are available for testing both in single sheet and FML form. Artificially damaged sheets are produced to model a welding defect and tested in both single sheet and FML form. This data is compared to standard 2024 -T 3 in single sheet form, and standard Glare in FML form. Both fatigue and static tests are performed. The Ccg and ncg coefficients derived from the single sheet 2024 -T 3 specimens deviate quite a lot from the Ccg and ncg coefficients derived from the Forman equation. Using the latter would have resulted in inaccurate comparisons of other single sheet FSW and Artificial Defect specimens. The single sheet FSW 0. 3 – 0. 4 mm specimens have a kissing bond defect, which resulted in degradation of fatigue performance. This defect was present, even though the welds on the sheets looked flawless. The single sheet FSW defect specimens show a significant drop in fatigue properties, but that is primarily due to the reduced cross section thickness of the weld. Correcting this data to the real thickness, or real stress, results in a substantial improvement, where some specimens even have the same fatigue properties as that of standard single sheet 2024 -T 3. The results are surprisingly favourable considering the visual state of the FSW sheets. The single sheet Artificial Defect groove specimens show the most reduction in fatigue properties. Standard Glare has a shorter crack initiation life than single sheet 2024 -T 3, but a much longer crack growth life resulting in an approximate doubled fatigue life. The worst case scenario is tested with the FML Artificial Defect severed weld specimens. Fatigue life is comparable to single sheet 2024 -T 3 at high stress amplitude, but fatigue properties are comparable to standard Glare at low stress amplitude. All other FML types perform between these two types of FMLs. The biggest degradation in fatigue occurs at high stress amplitude, whereas fatigue performance is comparable to standard Glare at low stress amplitude. The exception is FML 0. 3 – 0. 4 mm, which even performs slightly better than standard Glare. The reason is that the cross section of the centre FSW sheet was 0. 35 millimetres, whereas it is considered as if it were only 0. 3 mm. Fatigue properties of different types of material is much smaller in FML form than in single sheet form. The FMLgrow model predicts the fatigue life most accurately at low stress amplitude with a fatigue life that is 70 % of the measured value. The least accurate prediction is at high stress amplitude with a fatigue life that is about 25 % compared to the tested specimen. Crack initiation in the <b>centre</b> <b>layer</b> of the FML occurred only faster than in the outer aluminium layers with the Artificial Defect groove specimens, where the groove acts as a stress riser. The centre fatigue crack in this case is not longer than the fatigue crack in the outer aluminium layers when the latter reaches its final value of 2 a = 50 millimetres. This is visible in the C-scan result where the delamination pattern doesn’t exceed the final crack length value in the outer layer. The outer crack, after initiation, catches up with the centre crack, and then all cracks continue to grow at the same rate. Crack growth rate in FML reduces after initiation to reach a minimum value before increasing again. Crack bridging is less efficient when cracks are small, and the discontinuity due to the notch are the reasons for this initial high crack growth rate before reducing to a minimum value. Exponential growth as a function of half crack length was observed in the FML specimens, resulting in the following expression: da/dN=C_exp·a Cexp is an intrinsic fatigue property of an FML as are the Ccg and ncg coefficients for single sheet. Different basic fatigue calculations can be performed. Modeling and understanding of crack growth in Glare can be facilitated knowing this relation, since exponential growth is an intrinsic fatigue property in an FML. Plotting the logarithmic Cexp as a function of linear Sa yields a relation similar to the S-N relation. Exploration of the FMLgrow model to account for the differences between its predictions and measured data resulted in the understanding that the Alderliesten model is flawed due to interdependency of the aluminium layer with the glass fibre in the (W- 2 a) region, resulting in an incorrect Kfarfield. Ktip?Kfarfield+Kbridging Glare is considered as a structure where the primary load is carried solely by the aluminium sheets. Hence the feasibility of FSW Glare is based on the fatigue properties of FSW single sheet. Single sheet FSW with a defect shows more degradation in fatigue performance than the FML variant. Therefore using single sheet performance to evaluate feasibility of FSW Glare result in a stricter selection of what defects can and cannot be tolerated. At the same time will the stricter selection not result in a heavier structure; only damage tolerance will benefit. 90 % of the initiation and crack growth life of 2024 -T 3 is chosen as an arbitrary value for the requirements of the FSW sheets. This means that 90 % of the fatigue life of 2024 -T 3 is required. None of the tested specimens fulfill this requirement. Zero defects are not feasible in reality; an example is the presence of air inclusions in Glare. Defects in FSW are continuous and occur only as a result of incorrect welding parameters. Therefore there is no validation in the discussion what type of FSW defect can or cannot be tolerated; FSW sheets should not have any welding defects at all for Glare application.

40|$|In the thermo-elastic stress {{analysis}} of a spherically symmetric fuel element as used in a pebble bed reactor the problems of a radial variation in material properties and the temperature dependence of these properties can be unified into a single analysis. Such an analysis is developed for incorporation in a computer programme and applied, as an example, to a fuel element for a beryllia moderated reactor. The results give the effect of different material properties between surface and <b>centre,</b> a buffer <b>layer</b> between surface coating and centre, an increase in temperature of a fuel element composed of materials with different properties, and temperature dependance of the fuel element materials...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} the prototype design {{and development of}} a multimedia system for museums and galleries. Key elements in the system are the introduction of 3 -D models of museum artefacts together with 3 -D as well as 2 -D content based retrieval and navigation facilities {{and the development of}} a semantic <b>layer,</b> <b>centred</b> on an ontology for museums, which aims to expose the richness of knowledge associated with the museum collections and facilitate concept based retrieval and navigation integrated with that based on content and metadata. Interoperability protocols are designed to allow external applications to access the collection and an example is given of an e-Learning facility which uses models extracted to a virtual museum...|$|R
40|$|The smectic layer {{spacings}} (d) {{have been}} determined {{for a number}} of cyano derivatives which have an anomalous d/l ratio of ∼ 1. 4, where l is the molecular length. It is shown that the quantity (d — l) {{is directly related to the}} length of the alkyl or alkoxy tail of the molecule but is not simply related to the length of the aromatic core. This is consistent with a bimolecular layer structure having overlapping molecular cores at the <b>layer</b> <b>centre.</b> Using a combination of X-ray and neutron diffraction measurements of the intensity of the layer reflections on several isotopically substituted forms we have positively confirmed and quantified this model for one compound (4 -cyano- 4 '-n-octylbiphenyl, 8 CB) ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceCalculations of dication N 2 ++ {{density in}} the {{atmosphere}} of Titan is performed for the first time. The metastable lifetime of this species is 3 seconds in its ground state. The density of the N 2 ++ <b>layer</b> <b>centred</b> around 1100 – 1200 km altitude can reach 104 m− 3. The ions are produced by both the double photoionisation and the photoelectron impact of N 2. They are lost by dissociative recombination with the thermal electrons and chemical reactions with N 2 and CH 4. The most recent chemical reaction rate constants, given by laboratory experiments, were used in this study. Finally, we explore the possible detection of this ion layer by a spectrophotometer and show that the UVIS instrument onboard CASSINI could be capable to observe it...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the stability of}} the one-dimensional boundary layer generated by sudden heating of an infinite vertical wall. A quasi-steady approximation is used to obtain the asymptotic form of the growth rate and phase speed of disturbances whose wavelength is comparable with the boundary-layer width. Results for the inviscid modes governed by Rayleigh's equation are obtained for several values of the Prandtl number and are compared with solutions of the full stability equations. As the wavelength increases,the phase speed of disturbances approaches the maximum flow speed of the boundary layer and a five-tier structure extends across and outside the boundary layer. This intermediate regime,where viscous effects are important within a critical <b>layer</b> <b>centred</b> on the position of maximum flow speed,provides a link with an earlier long-wave analysis of the problem...|$|R

Their understanding may produce guidelines for the preparation and restoration projects aimed to removing excessive growth, for the reconstruction of missing parts necessary for the proper operation of the bodies and urban construction, for the restoration of the distribution system more congenial to a reuse compatible, for the less invasive technology adaptation...|$|R
40|$|Many {{applications}} require data to {{be captured}} and processed in real time, as the migration of all the data to a central site prior to analysis can create significant overhead. Examples include the variety of sensor network-based applications where sensors interface with real world artefacts and must respond to physical phenomenon that cannot be predicted apriori. The amount of data likely to be generated by a sensor and processing requirements in such applications can not be pre-determined (as they are often dependent on {{the rate of change}} of the physical phenomenon being measured and potential occurrence of “trigger events” which are non-deterministic). We propose the use of a multilayer Cloud infrastructure that distributes processing over both sensing nodes, multiple intermediate/gateways nodes and the more complex centralised data <b>centre.</b> Such <b>layers</b> need to work in coordination to ensure more reliable and efficient use of computing and network resources, preventing the need to move data to a central location when this is not necessary and creating data processing paths from data capture to analysis. We outline the basis for a decision function that evaluates: (i) where processing should be carried out; (ii) what processing should be undertaken centrally vs at an edge node; (iii) how processing can be distributed across multiple data centre locations to achieve QoS and cost targets...|$|R
50|$|Air defence in naval tactics, {{especially}} {{within a}} carrier group, is often {{built around a}} system of concentric layers with the aircraft carrier at the <b>centre.</b> The outer <b>layer</b> will usually be provided by the carrier's aircraft, specifically its AEW&C aircraft combined with the CAP. If an attacker is able to penetrate this layer, then the next layers would come from the surface-to-air missiles carried by the carrier's escorts; the area-defence missiles, such as the RIM-67 Standard, {{with a range of}} up to 100 nmi, and the point-defence missiles, like the RIM-162 ESSM, with a range of up to 30 nmi. Finally, virtually every modern warship will be fitted with small-calibre guns, including a CIWS, which is usually a radar-controlled Gatling gun of between 20mm and 30mm calibre capable of firing several thousand rounds per minute.|$|R
40|$|The {{biphenyl}} compounds 4 '-n-octyl- 4 -cyanobiphenyl and 4 '-n-octyloxy- 4 -cyanobiphenyl form smectic {{phases of}} a novel type. The X-ray diffraction patterns are unlike any other previously reported; they contain a sharp inner ring (corresponding to the layer thickness) and two diffuse outer rings. The layer thickness indicates some form of bilayer structure with molecules partially overlapping in the <b>centre</b> of the <b>layer.</b> A number of alternative models for the precise molecular arrangement are suggested. This smectic phase is miscible with the conventional SA phase formed by 2 -(4 '-n-octadecyloxybenzylideneamino) fluorene. X-ray investigations indicated that the layer thickness changes smoothly across the composition range. In spite {{of the difference in}} molecular length and the difference between the structures of the two pure smectic phases, it appears that in mixtures there is a complete and intimate mixing of the molecules...|$|R
