The <b>Continuing</b> <b>Vocational</b> <b>Training</b> Survey, 2010 (CVTS 4) aimed to assess the provision of <b>continuing</b> <b>vocational</b> <b>training</b> (CVT) in businesses {{in terms of the}} types of training offered, the numbers of employees being given training, the costs of training provision, and its management and delivery. Initial vocational training (IVT) such as that specifically designed for apprentices / trainees, or for inductions, was also covered in a separate section. The scope of CVTS 4 was enterprises employing ten or more people and it measured the training provided to employees other than apprentices and recognised trainees. In total 4, 604 enterprises of varying sizes were represented in the survey. Participants in the survey were Personnel Managers, Personnel Directors and other senior persons with responsibility for training for their enterprise. The survey in the UK is part of a pan-European investigation across EU nations and is the fourth in a series undertaken at half-decade intervals. The survey mainly concerns the vocational training undertaken by those employers in the 'reference year' of 2010 (previous reference years of earlier editions of the survey having been 1995, 2000, and 2005). The Statistical Office of the European Commission (Eurostat) undertook co-ordination of the study. The data available at the UKDA cover the UK only.

40|$|The {{intention}} of this contribution is Firstly, {{to discuss how}} the labour market education system from a network perspective can contribute to a positive employment development, and thereby create a symbioses-like relationship between the demand and supply side of <b>vocational</b> education and <b>training</b> Secondly, to illustrate how a CVT-system (<b>Continued</b> <b>Vocational</b> <b>Training)</b> can serve the diversified skill needs of industry as well as promote mobility and re-integration of the unemployed In order to present an exhaustive basis for discussion of these two items, we have chosen to submit our results in two different contributions to this IIRA conference.

Results show that employee-investment in training yields only moderate wage returns and has no significant impact on the further career development, especially when compared to the effects of enterprise-financed training. On the other hand, employees financing their own training gain in terms of unemployment risk reduction and the improvement in the matching of individual skills and job requirements.

30|$|Human capital {{theory and}} the life-course {{perspective}} are used to investigate how economic modernisation, as well as developments in the labour market after the West German “economic miracle”, impacted employers’ supply of {{further education and training}} on the job, and employees’ increased participation in these arrangements. Additionally—controlling for the aforementioned structural change and economic cycles—it is analysed whether participation in further training minimises employees’ risk of dismissal and heightens their commitment to a company. The hypotheses are tested using longitudinal data and time series—allowing the analysis of employees’ participation in further education and training on the job, and the careers of West Germans born between 1956 and 1978 for the 1972 – 2008 periods—by procedures of event history analysis and episode splitting in a dynamic multi-level design. Systematic period and cohort effects of structural change in the economy and labour markets on companies’ supply of, and employees’ participation in, <b>continued</b> <b>vocational</b> <b>training</b> on the job have been revealed. Participation in further training reduces employees’ risk of dismissal, as well as their mobility between companies. Participants’ adaptation to structural change via job-related further training is correlated with increased employment security, professional flexibility, and commitment to the employer.|$|R

Using structural equation modelling five latent variables were identified which have a significant effect on learning transfer parallel to the training – the so called collateral learning transfer.

30|$|Furthermore, so far unknown {{relationships}} {{in regard to}} individuals’ inclination to participate in further training activities, {{as well as the}} consequences thereof in regard to job mobility and employment security, are revealed. While social selectivity in regard to access to <b>continued</b> <b>vocational</b> <b>training</b> on the job and the accumulation of unequal educational and career opportunities has been discussed in many sociological studies (e.g. Becker 2018), this study reveals some of the mechanisms behind these processes. It should be noticed that there is a complex and, in particular, time-dependent interplay between individual characteristics (micro level), structural characteristics (meso level), and societal developments (macro level) (see also: Becker and Mayer 2019; Becker and Blossfeld 2017). This interplay reflects the reaction of the individual and corporate actors to the changing contexts in which they are embedded. Employees, as the ones directly affected by changes in the economy and employment structures, react to these changes before companies do, which is partly due to the structural inertia of these organisations (Hannan and Freeman 1989; Carroll 1984). On the one hand, organisations “interpret” the individual characteristics and efforts of their employees (e.g. educational level, trained profession, work experience, gender etc.) (Haveman and Cohen 1994; Baron and Bielby 1980; Stolzenberg 1978); they also convey continued training opportunities (Becker 2018), as well as employment and career opportunities (Blossfeld 1986, 1987 a) as an effect of organisational reactions to structural change and through effects on competitive positions.|$|R
