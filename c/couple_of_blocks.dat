5|$|Route177 {{began at}} {{a traffic light}} {{intersection}} with U.S. Route 206 {{in the city of}} Somerville. At the intersection, southbound traffic on Route206 had to use a jughandle to connect to Route177. The state highway went northeastward, progressing along as South Bridge Street through a curve. Heading northward, the route passed the Somerville Old Cemetery before intersecting with Fifth Street. There, state-maintenance ended, and the designation of Route177 terminated. Entering downtown Somerville, South Bridge Street continued northward into a large residential community. Passing to the east and west of several residential homes, South Bridge Street continued into the downtown portion, crossing the current-day Raritan Valley Line tracks maintained by New Jersey Transit and served the Somerville train station. After a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>blocks</b> of residential homes and businesses, South Bridge Street came to an intersection with New Jersey Route 28, where it switched to North Bridge Street.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a three-dimensional Newton-Krylov flow solver for the Navier-Stokes equations which uses summation-by-parts (SBP) operators on multi-block structured grids. Simultaneous approximation terms (SAT’s) {{are used to}} enforce the boundary conditions and the <b>coupling</b> <b>of</b> <b>block</b> interfaces. The discrete equations are solved iteratively with an inexact Newton method. The linear system of each Newton iteration is solved using a Krylov subspace iterative method with an approximate-Schur parallel preconditioner. The algorithm is validated against an established two-dimensional flow solver. Additionally, results are presented for laminar flow around the ONERA M 6 wing, as well as low Reynolds number flow around a sphere. Using 384 processors, the solver is capable of obtaining the steady-state solution (reducing the flow residual by 12 orders of magnitude) on a 4. 1 million node grid around the ONERA M 6 wing in 4. 2 minutes. Convergence to 3 significant figures in force coefficients is achieved in 83 seconds. Parallel scaling tests show that the algorithm scales well {{with the number of}} processors used. The results show that the SBP-SAT discretization, solved with the parallel Newton-Krylov-Schur algorithm, is an efficient option for three-dimensional Navier-Stokes solutions, with the SAT’s providing several advantages in enforcing boundary conditions and block coupling.

2500|$|The newly {{established}} village became an industrial centre, and implement works, tanneries, asheries and wagon factories opened (and often closed shortly after, as economic [...] "panics" [...] occurred regularly). In 1876, Robert Samuel McLaughlin, Sr. moved his carriage works to Oshawa from Enniskillen {{to take advantage}} of its harbour and of the availability of a rail link not too far away. He constructed a two-storey building, which was soon added to. This building was heavily remodelled in 1929, receiving a new facade and being extended to the north using land where the city's gaol (jail, firehall & townhall) had once stood. The village became a town in 1879, in what was then called East Whitby Township. Around 1890, the carriage works relocated from its Simcoe Street address to an unused furniture factory a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>blocks</b> to the northeast, and this remained its site until the building burnt in 1899. Offered assistance by the town, McLaughlin chose to stay in Oshawa, building a new factory across Mary Street from the old site. Rail service had been provided in 1890 by the Oshawa Railway; this was originally set up as a streetcar line, but c. 1910 a second [...] "freight line" [...] was built slightly to the east of Simcoe Street. This electric line provided streetcar and freight service, connected central Oshawa with the Grand Trunk (now Canadian National) Railway, and with the Canadian Northern (which ran through the very north of Oshawa) and the Canadian Pacific, built in 1912-13. The Oshawa Railway was acquired by the Grand Trunk operation around 1910, and streetcar service was replaced by buses in 1940. After GM moved its main plants to south Oshawa in 1951, freight traffic fell and most of the tracks were removed in 1963, although a line to the older remaining [...] "north" [...] plant via Ritson Road remained until 2000.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the statistical {{relationship between the}} total ozone column (TOC) and atmospheric blocking using 40 -yr European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Re-Analysis (ERA- 40) data for the 1978 - 98 period, with special emphasis on winter and the European and eastern Pacific sectors. Regional blocking occurrence {{is accompanied by a}} decrease of TOC within the anticyclonic circulation region and a distinctive ozone increase upstream and downstream (upstream and south) in the Pacific (European) sector. Blocking significantly enhances the likelihood of low TOC extremes, especially over the Scandinavian and the Alaska Peninsulas, where more than 50 % <b>of</b> winter <b>blocks</b> lead to TOC values in the lowest tail of the distribution. The relationship between ozone miniholes and blocking is confined to the high latitudes of both basins and is strong in Europe, where about half of the ozone miniholes occur simultaneously with blocking. Blocking-related ozone miniholes (blocking ozone miniholes) are also among the most intense and persistent. Although blocking activity does not drive the interannual variability of regional ozone miniholes, blocking ozone miniholes account for up to two-thirds of the total observed trend of ozone miniholes in Europe. The polar vortex is proposed as a feasible candidate for explaining the enhanced <b>coupling</b> <b>of</b> <b>blocking</b> and ozone miniholes in Europe and its long-term modulation. Blocking ozone miniholes are consistent with an almost purely dynamic origin caused by horizontal transport of ozone-poor air and vertical motions working together at different levels to reduce ozone content. Although the contribution of the former is dominant, accounting for two-thirds of ozone reduction in the 330 - 850 -K column, the effect of the latter becomes a distinctive feature <b>of</b> <b>blocking</b> ozone miniholes...|$|R

Its deregulation {{is involved in}} numerous human diseases. This thesis describes the synthesis and biological evaluation {{of a series of}} analogues of the PI 3 -K-Akt-mTOR inhibitor E 1, a homo-dimeric diarylmethane. Several structurally diverse hetero-dimeric E 1 derivatives were discovered that inhibited PI 3 -K-Akt-mTOR signalling in human cancer cells. Chapter 1 provides an overview of the PI 3 -K-Akt-mTOR signalling pathway and its biological significance. Chapter 2 discusses the use of small molecules for the investigation of PI 3 -K-Akt-mTOR signalling, with examples given by structural class. It concludes with a profile of lead compound E 1. Chapter 3 outlines the proposed approach to analogue synthesis by the <b>coupling</b> <b>of</b> functionalised building <b>blocks,</b> and describes the development <b>of</b> building <b>block</b> compounds via the orthofunctionalisation of phenol derivatives. Chapter 4 describes efforts towards the derivatisation of E 1 with a linker group in order to allow the conjugation of biotin for affinity chromatography, or the incorporation of other groups useful for biological characterisation. In Chapter 5, the <b>coupling</b> <b>of</b> building <b>blocks</b> via C-C, C-O, C-N and N-S bond-forming reactions to generate homo- and hetero-dimeric E 1 derivatives is discussed. Several of these compounds were capable of inducing cellular Akt inhibition. Chapter 6 focuses on the synthesis of hetero-dimeric analogues based on these new lead compounds. The biological evaluation of E 1 derivatives in a cellular assay is described in Chapter 7. Finally, detailed experimental procedures are described in Chapter 8.

40|$|ArticleFor the {{investigation}} of the molecular heterogeneity <b>of</b> polystyrene-b-polyisoprene <b>block</b> copolymers, a chromatographic separation method, namely liquid chromatography at critical conditions was developed. This method was coupled on-line with 1 H-NMR(where NMR stands for nuclear magnetic resonance) for the comprehensive analysis of the polystyrene-b- polyisoprene copolymers. The copolymers were synthesized by two different methods: sequential living anionic polymerization and <b>coupling</b> <b>of</b> living precursor <b>blocks.</b> While 1 H-NMR allows just for the analysis of the bulk chemical composition <b>of</b> the <b>block</b> copolymers, the coupling with liquid chromatography at critical conditions provides selective molar mass information on the polystyrene and polyisoprene blocks within the copolymers. The polyisoprene block molar mass is determined by operating at chromatographic conditions corresponding to the critical point of adsorption of polystyrene and size exclusion chromatography mode for polyisoprene. The molar mass <b>of</b> the polystyrene <b>block</b> is determined by operating at the critical conditions of polyisoprene. In addition to the molar mass <b>of</b> each <b>block</b> <b>of</b> the copolymers, the chemical composition distribution <b>of</b> the <b>block</b> copolymers was determined.
