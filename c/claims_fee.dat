50|$|Dr Ghosh was a surgeon. He {{was convicted}} of four {{offences}} under the Theft Act 1968 sections 20(2) and 15(1). During {{his work as a}} locum surgeon he obtained money by <b>claiming</b> <b>fees</b> for work that others had carried out, or that had been carried out under England's National Health Service. The jury found him guilty and he appealed on the basis that the trial judge had told the jury to use their common sense to determine whether the accused's conduct had been dishonest or not. Ghosh argued that the judge should have instructed the jury that dishonesty was about the accused’s state of mind (a subjective test) rather than the jury’s point of view (an objective test).|$|R

40|$|The American rule {{dictates}} {{that regardless of}} the outcome, parties pay for their own attorneys 2 ̆ 7 fees unless Congress has specifically enacted a fee-shifting statute authorizing courts to award fees to prevailing parties. One of the most recognized fee-shifting statutes is 42 U. S. C. § 1988. Courts and scholars have extensively discussed whether a plaintiff is a prevailing party under § 1988. Yet both have largely ignored one scenario in which a plaintiff files a suit containing both constitutional <b>claims</b> for which <b>fees</b> are authorized under § 1988 (<b>fee</b> <b>claims)</b> and state law <b>claims</b> for which <b>fees</b> are not authorized (nonfee claims). Courts then, invoking the avoidance doctrine, simply rule on the state law claim and leave the constitutional claim unaddressed. In this scenario, is the plaintiff a prevailing party under § 1988 ? The few courts that have addressed this question have adopted a rule that unnecessarily favors plaintiffs {{at the expense of}} defendants by allowing courts to award fees without finding that the defendants violated the plaintiffs 2 ̆ 7 constitutional rights. It also creates a system that is ripe for abuse-one in which plaintiffs can use pleading tricks to obtain fee awards with 2 ̆ 2 mere incantations 2 ̆ 2 of <b>fee</b> <b>claims.</b> This Note proposes revising this rule by requiring that the <b>fee</b> and nonfee <b>claims</b> be reasonably related, with a heavy emphasis on whether they are based on related legal theories. This new rule would still let courts invoke the avoidance doctrine but would better protect defendants without unnecessarily burdening plaintiffs...|$|R
