5|$|Since then, many {{scholars}} have operated under {{the belief that}} the Great Wall continually defended China's border against the steppe nomads for two thousand years. For example, the 18th-century sinologist Joseph de Guignes assigned macrohistorical importance to such walls when he advanced the theory that the Qin construction forced the Xiongnu to migrate west to Europe and, becoming known as the Huns, ultimately contributed to the decline of the Roman Empire. Some have attempted to make general statements regarding <b>Chinese</b> <b>society</b> and foreign policy based on the conception of a perennial Great Wall: Karl Marx took the Wall to represent the stagnation of the <b>Chinese</b> <b>society</b> and economy, Owen Lattimore supposed that the Great Wall demonstrated a need to divide the nomadic way of life from the agricultural communities of China, and John K. Fairbank posited that the Wall played a part in upholding the Sinocentric world order.|$|E

40|$|Panel 5 : Men and Sex in Hong KongThis {{paper is}} a {{historical}} anthropology of masculinity in the <b>Chinese</b> <b>societies</b> of Hong Kong and Taiwan. Following Saussure’s insight that the conventional value of a cultural category is defined by its relations to other categories within the same cultural scheme, we shall study masculinity in relation to ethnobiology, sexuality, marriage, family, and descent in the <b>Chinese</b> <b>societies</b> of Hong Kong and Taiwan, arguing that masculinity cannot be understood on its own but should be examined {{in relation to other}} cultural categories. However, the relationship between masculinity and other social categories varies with different societies. By comparing such a relationship in the <b>Chinese</b> <b>societies</b> of Hong Kong and Taiwan, we shall understand why the conventional value/meaning of masculinity differs in these two societies. We contextualize our study of masculinity in pre-colonial, colonial, and postcolonial Taiwan and Hong Kong, demonstrating how meaning of masculinity changes in different political regimes of these two societies. This paper ends with a theoretical question: if masculinity takes on different meanings in Hong Kong and Taiwanese societies, what do we mean when we say that they are <b>Chinese</b> <b>societies...</b>|$|R

5|$|The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism was Weber's {{second major}} {{work on the}} {{sociology}} of religion. Hans H.

His work also questioned why capitalism did not develop in China. He focused on the issues of Chinese urban development, Chinese patrimonialism and officialdom and Chinese religion and philosophy (primarily, Confucianism and Taoism), as the areas in which Chinese development differed most distinctively from the European route.|$|E

Christians who they felt were responsible for foreign domination of China were also targeted. In June 1900, the Boxers invaded Beijing and killed 230 non-Chinese. The Qing commander in chief Ronglu expelled the Boxers from the city. The Qing ordered foreign diplomats and personnel to leave to Tianjin but they refused and stay put in the legation quarter of Beijing.|$|E

This introductory chapter provides the rationale for the book and introduces its sections and chapters. The first section focuses on the common Chinese cultural values that underpin early childhood development and education in all the societies covered in the book. The next section focuses on the PRC and includes six chapters that consider ECE policy, governance and finance, teacher education, curriculum and pedagogy, ECE in rural China, and ECE in emergencies.

5|$|America's Asian {{conflicts}} against Japan, North Korea, and North Vietnam brought Sun Tzu to {{the attention}} of American military leaders. The Department of the Army in the United States, through its Command and General Staff College, has directed all units to maintain libraries within their respective headquarters for the continuing education of personnel in the art of war. The Art of War is mentioned as an example of works to be maintained at each facility, and staff duty officers are obliged to prepare short papers for presentation to other officers on their readings. Similarly, Sun Tzu's Art of War is listed on the Marine Corps Professional Reading Program. During the Gulf War in the 1990s, both Generals Norman Schwarzkopf Jr. and Colin Powell employed principles from Sun Tzu related to deception, speed, and striking one's enemy's weak points. However, the United States and other Western countries have been criticised for not truly understanding Sun Tzu's work and not appreciating The Art of War within the wider context of <b>Chinese</b> <b>society.</b>|$|E
5|$|In China, {{silk-worm}} farming {{was originally}} restricted to women, and many women {{were employed in}} the silk-making industry. Even though some saw {{the development of a}} luxury product as useless, silk provoked such a craze among high society that the rules in the Li Ji were used to limit its use {{to the members of the}} imperial family. For approximately a millennium, the right to wear silk was reserved for the emperor and the highest dignitaries. Silk was, at the time, a sign of great wealth, because of its shimmering appearance. This appearance was due to silk's prism-like shape/structure, which refracted light from every angle. After some time, silk gradually extended to other classes of <b>Chinese</b> <b>society.</b> Silk began to be used for decorative means and also in less luxurious ways: musical instruments, fishing, and bow making. Peasants did not have the right to wear silk until the Qing dynasty (1644–1911).|$|E
5|$|Taoism was the {{official}} {{religion of the}} Tang. Buddhism, originating in India {{around the time of}} Confucius, continued its influence during the Tang period and was accepted by some members of imperial family, becoming thoroughly sinicized and a permanent part of Chinese traditional culture. In an age before Neo-Confucianism and figures such as Zhu Xi (1130–1200), Buddhism had begun to flourish in China during the Northern and Southern dynasties, and became the dominant ideology during the prosperous Tang. Buddhist monasteries played an integral role in <b>Chinese</b> <b>society,</b> offering lodging for travelers in remote areas, schools for children throughout the country, and a place for urban literati to stage social events and gatherings such as going-away parties. Buddhist monasteries were also engaged in the economy, since their land property and serfs gave them enough revenues to set up mills, oil presses, and other enterprises. Although the monasteries retained 'serfs', these monastery dependents could actually own property and employ others to help them in their work, including their own slaves.|$|E

5|$|The {{core of the}} I Ching is a Western Zhou divination text {{called the}} Changes of Zhou (周易 Zhōu yì).

A comparison between modern day Chinese and American societies showed that there was greater distress with sexual infidelity in the US than in China. The cultural difference is most likely due to the more restrictive nature of <b>Chinese</b> <b>society,</b> thus, making infidelity a more salient concern.
