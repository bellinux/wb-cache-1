50|$|A {{stock option}} is a <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>option.</b> Specifically, a call option {{is the right}} (not obligation) to buy stock in the future at a fixed price and a put option is the right (not obligation) to sell stock in the future at a fixed price. Thus, {{the value of a}} stock option changes in {{reaction}} to the underlying stock of which it is a derivative. The most popular method of valuing stock options is the Black Scholes model. Apart from call options granted to employees, most stock options are transferable.|$|E

40|$|A new <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>option</b> price {{models is}} {{developed}} {{and applied to}} options on the Australian S&P 200 Index. The class of models generalizes the traditional Black-Scholes framework by accommodating time-varying conditional volatility, skewness and excess kurtosis in the underlying returns process. An important property of the more general pricing models is that the computational requirements are practically {{the same as those}} associated with the Black-Scholes model, with both methods being based on one-dimensional integrals. Bayesian inferential methods are used to evaluate a range of models nested in the general framework, using observed market option prices. The evaluation is based on posterior distributions estimated for the parameters of the alternative models, as well as posterior model probabilities, out-of-sample predictive performance and implied volatility smiles.

40|$|We {{describe}} a search problem {{in which a}} decision maker (DM) must select several sequentially-encountered options. Each option is described by multiple attributes, {{and the value of}} an option is given by a function of its attribute values. However, the attribute values are not known with certainty, and can only be ascertained in a predefined order, at some fixed cost. During the search the DM can choose to select an option, purchase information about an attribute value, reject (permanently) the current option and continue the search, or terminate the search and accept a status quo outcome. We introduce a Threshold Policy for this search process, and provide a <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>option</b> value functions for which the policy is optimal. We then furnish a dynamic programming procedure for prescribing an optimal policy for this problem.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the trading activity in options market based on information about expected future volatility in spot market. We employ Common Implied Volatility as a measure of expected volatility and options volume and changes in Open Interests as measures <b>of</b> <b>options</b> trading activity. We first test for simultaneous information flow in the two markets using multiple regression technique. Next, we test for information based or hedge based use <b>of</b> <b>options</b> using Trivariate Vector-auto Regression framework. We further consider the <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> <b>options</b> moneyness and the market trends in our analysis to examine if the trader’s preference <b>of</b> <b>options</b> changes with change in description <b>of</b> <b>options</b> intrinsic value and market environment. We use daily closing data of S&P CNX Nifty Index options traded on National Stock Exchange, India. We, for the most part, find negative and significant relationship in contemporaneous regression suggesting active trading by arbitrageurs. A feedback relationship is observed in vector auto regression analysis suggesting that options are traded in India for both information based trading and hedging purposes.

This indicates that traders are not indifferent in their choice of trading venue when market conditions and factors change. The results of this study are helpful for traders in managing the risk and return of their portfolio based on volatility forecast.

40|$|Doctor of Philosophy(PhD) In {{this thesis}} we are {{concerned}} with valuing options on traded accounts using both continuous and discrete time models. An option on a traded account is a zero strike call on the balance of a trading account which consists of a position of size θ in a risky asset (which we refer to as a stock) and the remaining wealth in a risk-free account. The choice of trading positions throughout {{the life of the}} option are made by the buyer, subject to constraints specified in the contract at the time of purchase. The specification of these trading constraints gives rise to some of the more well known examples including passport options and vacation options. At maturity, the option buyer is entitled to any positive wealth accumulated in the trading account whilst any losses are covered by the option seller. First, we examine the problem of valuing these options in continuous time. A review of some existing methods is presented, including a complete derivation of the pricing formula for the passport option and the option on a traded account following the methods proposed by Hyer et al. (1997) and Shreve and Vecer (2000), though we often use different techniques to those authors. We also present an alternative derivation for the value of a passport option using our own methodology which we believe is simpler than those currently available. Secondly, we consider the valuation problem in a discrete time setting by looking at one specific discrete time model, the binomial tree. This is a new contribution to the literature as binomial models for these options have not been previously examined. Using this approach, the greatest difficulty is the determination of an optimal trading strategy which is required to price this <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>option.</b> We show that in general, binomial models and continuous time models {{do not have the same}} trading strategy, and in fact that the analytic determination of the trading strategy for an option on a traded account may in fact be impossible to obtain. We then turn to passport options, where we are able to derive an analytic optimal strategy which in this case is identical to that used in the continuous time models, thus the problem of valuing passport options is reduced to the same computational burdens as a binomial valuation without recombining branches. Lastly, we examine some numerical methods which could be used to value options on traded accounts with binomial models. Our problem is shown to be an NP-hard convex maximisation which we convert into both an l 1 -norm convex maximisation and an indefinite quadratic program. Whilst we present algorithms which are guaranteed to obtain the optimal solution, they are also known to be inefficient and thus inappropriate for any likely application beyond a few time steps. We conclude by summarising our results and give directions for future research in this area...|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that the Black-Scholes-Merton model suffers from several deficiencies. Jump-diffusion and Levy models have been widely used to {{partially}} alleviate some of the biases inherent in this classical model. Unfortunately, the resulting pricing problem requires solving a more difficult partial-integro differential equation (PIDE) and although several approaches for solving the PIDE have been suggested in the literature, none are entirely satisfactory. All treat the integral and diffusive terms asymmetrically and are difficult to extend to higher dimensions. We present a new, efficient algorithm, based on transform methods, which symmetrically treats the diffusive and integrals terms, is applicable to a wide <b>class</b> <b>of</b> path-dependent <b>options</b> (such as Bermudan, barrier, and shout options) and options on multiple assets, and naturally extends to regime-switching Levy models.

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the pricing {{problem for the}} <b>class</b> <b>of</b> multiasset European <b>options</b> with {{piecewise}} linear convex payoff in the asset prices. We derive a simple upper bound on the price <b>of</b> this <b>option</b> by constructing a static super-replicating portfolio using cash and options on smaller subsets of assets. The best upper bound is found by determining the optimal set of strike prices that minimizes {{the cost of this}} super-replicating portfolio. Under the no-arbitrage assumption, this bound is shown to be tight when the joint risk-neutral distributions for the smaller subsets of assets are known but the complete risk-neutral distribution is unknown. Using a simulation-based optimization approach, we obtain new price bounds for the basket option, an option on the maximum of several assets and an option on the spread between the maximum and minimum of assets. Extensions to markets where only a finite set <b>of</b> <b>options</b> are traded on smaller subsets of assets is also provided.
