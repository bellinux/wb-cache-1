The control objective is usually achieved through an energy reshaping process and by injecting damping to modify the dissipation structure of the system.

From previous work we know that a PBC <b>controller</b> <b>forces</b> the closed-loop dynamics to behave as if there are artificial resistors connected to the real circuit elements.

One of the {{fundamental}} issues in asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) networks is the congestion problem of information flow.

This paper presents a traffic controller to solving the congestion problem by using Q-learning conjunction with simulated annealing. In stead of relying on the mathematical model for source traffic, the controller is designed to learn an optimal policy by directly interacting with the unknown environment. The simulated annealing is a powerful way to solve hard combinatorial optimization problems, which is used to adjust the balance between exploration and exploitation in learning process. The proposed <b>controller</b> <b>forces</b> the queue size in multiplexer buffer to the desired value by adjusting the source transmission rate of the available bit rate (ABR) service.

40|$|A {{non-linear}} {{control strategy}} {{is applied to}} a simply supported uniform beam subjected to an axial end force at the principal-parametric resonance frequency of the first skew-symmetric mode. The control input consists of the bending couples applied by two piezoceramic actuators attached onto the beam surface symmetrically {{with respect to the}} midspan and are driven by the same voltage thus generating symmetric control forces. This control architecture has zero control authority, in a linear sense, onto skew-symmetric vibrations. The non-linear transfer of energy from symmetric to skew-symmetric modes, due to non-linear inertia and curvature forces, provides the key physical mechanism for delivering effects from the actuators to the linearly uncontrollable mode. The reduced dynamics of the system, constructed with the method of multiple scales directly applied to the governing PDE's and boundary conditions, suggest effective forms of the control law as a two-frequency input. In particular, the performances of different control laws in sub-combination resonance with the excited mode are investigated. The relative phase and frequency detunings, with respect to the external excitation, are designed so as to render the control action the most effective. The control schemes generate <b>controller</b> <b>forces</b> which increase the threshold for the activation of the parametric resonance thus annihilating the parametric resonance...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Basing on a {{constraint}} Jacobian induced orthogonal {{decomposition of}} the task space and by requiring the <b>force</b> <b>controller</b> to be orthogonal to the constraint manifold, {{the dynamics of the}} constrained robots under hybrid control is decomposed into a set of two equations. One describes the motion of robots moving on the constraint manifold, while the other relates the constraint force with the hybrid controller. This decomposition does not require the solution of the constraint equation in partition form. In this setting, the hybrid control of constrained robots can be essentially reduced to robust stabilization of uncertain nonlinear systems whose uncertainties do not satisfy the matching condition. A continuous version of the sliding-mode controller (from Khalil [12]) is employed to design a position <b>controller.</b> The <b>force</b> <b>controller</b> is designed as a proportional force error feedback of high gain type. The coordination of the position <b>controller</b> and the <b>force</b> <b>controller</b> is shown to achieve ultimately bounded position and force tracking with tunable accuracy. Moreover, an estimate of the domain of attraction is provided for the motion on the constraint manifold. Simulation for a planar two-link robot constraining on an ellipse is given to show the effectiveness of a hybrid controller. In addition, the friction effect, viewed as external disturbance to the system, is also examined through simulations.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{focuses on}} the design of {{intelligent}} actuator logic for Electro-Mechanical Brake (EMB) system using fuzzy control. Previous studies simplified EMB system as a linear system or removed coulomb friction and backlash for the convenience of calculation. However, nonlinear components such as coulomb friction and backlash should be considered because the inherent nonlinearity in the high operating speed of EMB system is critical. Therefore, in this paper, we adopt full Brake by Wire (BBW) model of EMB system. Unlike Electro-Hydraulic Brake (EHB) system, EMB has no hydraulic back-up system, and is operated totally by electric and electro-mechanical components. Therefore, safety is the {{one of the most important}} problems in designing an EMB system. To control the EMB system, we developed fuzzy logic controller, which is effective in a complex and nonlinear system. MATLAB SIMULINK is used to provide the verification of the control performance.

40|$|Ideally, robots {{should learn}} {{from a few}} demonstrations of a given task, and generalize {{knowledge}} to new, unseen tasks, and to different robots. In this paper, we focus on trajectory tracking and introduce a multi-robot, multi-task transfer learning framework that allows a target system to complete a target task by learning from a few demonstrations of a source task on a source system. The proposed multi-robot transfer learning framework {{is based on a}} combined L 1 adaptive control and iterative learning control approach. The key idea is that the adaptive <b>controller</b> <b>forces</b> dynamically different systems to behave as the specified reference model. The proposed multi-task transfer learning framework uses theoretical control results (e. g. the concept of vector relative degree) to learn a map from desired trajectories to the inputs that make the system track these trajectories. The learned map is then used to calculate the inputs for a new, unseen trajectory. Experimental results using two different quadrotors show that, using the proposed framework, it is possible to significantly reduce the tracking error of a target trajectory on the target system when information from a single source trajectory learned on the source system is used.

Based on the adaptive control schemes designed by Seraji [18], Dai [30], and Jimenez [31], we redesigned and further simplified the control algorithm and, as a consequence, we achieved better path tracking performance. The proposed adaptive controller is made of a PD feedback controller which has time varying gains, a feedforward compensator {{based on the idea}} of inverse dynamics, and an auxiliary signal. Due to its adaptive structure, the controller shows robustness against disturbances and unmodeled dynamics. In order to ensure asymptotic tracking we select a Lyapunov function such that the <b>controller</b> <b>forces</b> the negative definiteness of the time derivative of such a Lyapunov function.

40|$|As robots {{and other}} {{automated}} systems {{are introduced to}} unknown and dynamic environments, robust and adaptive control strategies are required to cope with disturbances, unmodeled dynamics and parametric uncertainties. In this paper, we propose and provide theoretical proofs of a combined L_ 1 adaptive feedback and iterative learning control (ILC) framework to improve trajectory tracking of a system subject to unknown and changing disturbances. The L_ 1 adaptive <b>controller</b> <b>forces</b> the system to behave in a repeatable, predefined way, even {{in the presence of}} unknown and changing disturbances; however, this does not imply that perfect trajectory tracking is achieved. ILC improves the tracking performance based on experience from previous executions. The performance of ILC is limited by the robustness and repeatability of the underlying system, which, in this approach, is handled by the L_ 1 adaptive controller. In particular, we are able to generalize learned trajectories across different system configurations because the L_ 1 adaptive controller handles the underlying changes in the system. We demonstrate the improved trajectory tracking performance and generalization capabilities of the combined method compared to pure ILC in experiments with a quadrotor subject to unknown, dynamic disturbances. This is the first work to show L_ 1 adaptive control combined with ILC in experiment. Comment: 7 pages, 5 figures, Proc. of the 2017 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automatio...|$|E
