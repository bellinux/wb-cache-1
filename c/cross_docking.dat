40|$|Abstract- <b>Cross</b> <b>docking</b> is a {{relatively}} new technique in supply chain operations. It offers limited storage time to maximize the efficiency of goods transshipment. Efficient operation of a <b>cross</b> <b>docking</b> system requires an appropriate coordination of inbound and outbound flows, accurate planning and dynamic scheduling. The planning strategies at <b>cross</b> <b>docking</b> terminals, which are receiving growing attention today, are the truck-to-door assignment and destination to door assignment problems. This paper provides a comprehensive literature review of quantitative approaches in dock door assignment problems of <b>cross</b> <b>docking</b> planning.

40|$|Many supply chains {{strive to}} shorten the time between a customer's order and the actual {{delivery}} of the ordered goods. <b>Cross</b> <b>docking</b> {{is one of the}} options to reduce these response times. <b>Cross</b> <b>docking</b> facilities are dynamic environments where products arrive and leave the same day. To deal with these dynamic aspects, the need for efficient control policies in combination with flexible and easy to reconfigure storage area layouts increases. We present a dynamic design methodology to select control policies and determine layout rules for <b>cross</b> <b>docking</b> facilities. We present both advantages and disadvantages of the proposed layout procedures. We use the <b>cross</b> <b>docking</b> center of the "Royal Horticultural Company Lemkes" in The Netherlands as the basis for a comparative analysis of the procedures presented. We show that, by applying our design methodology, a savings of 16 % can be obtained in total travel distances of employees. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

Little {{attention has been given}} to the transshipment operations inside a <b>cross</b> <b>dock.</b> In this article, we study the transshipment scheduling problem in a single receiving and a single shipping door <b>cross</b> <b>dock</b> under three scheduling policies: In the first policy, we assume to have complete information on the order of arrivals and the contents of all inbound trucks. The second and the third policies assume the availability of partial and no information on the sequence of upcoming trucks. An optimal graph based model is proposed for the full information case, and a polynomial time algorithm is given. Heuristics are developed for the other two cases. The comparison of the costs associated to each policy helps evaluating the value of information in <b>cross</b> <b>dock</b> scheduling problems...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to define an optimal distribution network for Argentina using <b>Cross</b> <b>Docking</b> Centers. The products to be delivered are in a Central Warehouse in Buenos Aires, the main city and port of Argentina. These products have to be distributed to hundreds of locations {{in the interior of}} the country. These locations have lower levels of demand and are at great distance from Buenos Aires. In order to achieve efficient distribution, <b>cross</b> <b>docking</b> centers and a third party carrier distribution are utilized. To find the optimal number, size and location of <b>cross</b> <b>docking</b> centers and which <b>cross</b> <b>docking</b> center or carrier should supply each location, two models are developed. The first model is a location-allocation model in which capacities of the <b>cross</b> <b>docking</b> centers are not considered constraining. In this case, the model is complemented by a heuristic approach that is used to find a near-optimal feasible solution. The second model, a capacited location model, is more complex, taking into account the demands of each location and defining the optimal location of <b>cross</b> <b>docking</b> centers and their respective capacities. Both models are analyzed with the data representing the distribution of pharmaceutical products in Argentina in 1999. The models' solution generates savings of 5 %, compared to the current network that was designed based on intuition and other external factors, without the use of an optimization tool. by Fernando G.

40|$|<b>Cross</b> <b>docking</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} issues in management of supply chains. In <b>cross</b> <b>docking,</b> different items delivered to a warehouse by inbound trucks are directly arranged and reorganized based on customer demands, routed and loaded into outbound trucks for delivery purposes to customers without virtually keeping them at the warehouse. If any item is kept in storage, it is normally for a short amount of time, say less than 24 hours. In this paper, we consider a special case of <b>cross</b> <b>docking</b> where there is temporary storage and implements genetic algorithm to solve the resulted problem for some realistic test problems. In our method, we first use some heuristics as initial solutions and then improve the final solution using genetic algorithm.

40|$|Efficiency of <b>cross</b> <b>docking</b> {{is mainly}} {{affected}} by the inbound operation’s total operation time that involves truck-to-door assignment and scheduling. However, many <b>cross</b> <b>docking</b> centres are still practising conservative way for assigning and scheduling trucks to dock doors. Most current studies addressed deterministic truck scheduling model, thus, unable to deal with real time and dynamic environment of trucks arrival at the <b>cross</b> <b>docking</b> centre. Thus, this study embarks on four objectives which are to identify current issues of cross docking’s truck-to-door assignment and scheduling, to estimate the unloading time of a truck using fuzzy logic modelling, to develop a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model that minimizes the total service time of trucks at the inbound operation based on the estimated unloading time; and to analyse the simulations of daily real time truck scheduling operations based on the proposed model. This study utilized data gathered from a third party logistics company (3 PL). Results from data analysis were used as basis for establishing the models of this study. Statistical analysis was utilized for hypothesis testing. Monte Carlo simulation experiments using an automated Excel-VBA template were conducted for verification and validation of the models. Based on the results, the developed mathematical model has been proven to be reliable in producing feasible solutions with low waiting time per truck and low service time, thus, capable of minimizing the total service time for all trucks at inbound operation at <b>cross</b> <b>docking</b> centre. The models and {{findings of this study}} can be utilized to enhance the <b>cross</b> <b>docking</b> services especially in Malaysia...|$|E

40|$|At <b>cross</b> <b>docking</b> terminals, {{shipments}} from inbound {{trucks are}} unloaded, sorted {{and moved to}} dispatch points where they are directly loaded onto outbound trucks for an immediate delivery elsewhere in the distribution system. This warehouse management concept aims at realizing economies in transportation cost by consolidating divergent shipments to full truckloads without requiring excessive inventory at the cross dock. The efficient operation of such a system requires an appropriate coordination of inbound and outbound trucks, e. g. by computerized scheduling procedures.
