40|$|Outcrossing of non-Bt cotton (Gossypium hirsutum (L.)) in refuges by {{transgenic}} Bt cultivars {{could reduce}} the efficacy of refuges for delaying resistance in seed-feeding pests. Based on reports that outcrossing decreased as distance <b>from</b> <b>Bt</b> cotton increased in small-scale studies, we hypothesized that increasing refuge width or distance <b>from</b> <b>Bt</b> fields would reduce outcrossing. In a large-scale study in Arizona, we quantified Bt seed in refuges of experimental and commercial fields, comparing outcrossing between in-field (narrow) and external (wide) refuges and among rows of refuges at various distances <b>from</b> <b>Bt</b> fields. Some refuges, including those in tightly controlled experimental plots, contained up to 8 % adventitious Bt plants. Some, but not all, Bt plants likely resulted <b>from</b> <b>Bt</b> seed in the non-Bt seed bags. We did not detect a difference in outcrossing between in-field and external refuges. However, statistical power was low because outcrossing was low (< 0. 4 % of seeds) in both treatments. Higher outcrossing levels (≤ 4. 6 % of seeds) were observed in the studies measuring out-crossing at various distances <b>from</b> <b>Bt</b> fields, yet outcrossing did not decrease as the distance <b>from</b> <b>Bt</b> fields increased. We hypothesize that Bt plants in refuges cross-pollinated surrounding non-Bt plants, overshadow-ing the expected association between distance <b>from</b> <b>Bt</b> fields and outcrossing...|$|R

40|$|Proceedings of the 2003 Georgia Water Resources Conference, held April 23 - 24, 2003, at the University of Georgia. The {{high iron}} {{content in the}} soils and {{resident}} parent material of the Georgia Piedmont results in significant transport of iron in runoff to receiving waterbodies. Phosphorus cycling in lakes can be significantly affected by the iron cycle. The work presented here describes experiments to test sorption and desorption of phosphate <b>from</b> <b>Bt</b> horizon soil to help illuminate the role of transported sediment in the cycling of phosphorus in Georgia Piedmont impoundments. We conducted sorption capacity experiments on Bt horizon soil, Lake Lanier sediments, and catalyst grade FeOOH. We also describe experiments to test release of phosphate <b>from</b> <b>Bt</b> horizon soil under elevated pH conditions. Sorption capacity of Bt soil and Lake Lanier sediments is {{greater than that of}} FeOOH. Phosphate desorption <b>from</b> <b>Bt</b> horizon soil at pH values of 8 - 10 fits a linear model with greater desorption at higher pH values. The results presented here further support the alternative phosphorus cycling pathway proposed in Parker and Rasmussen (2001) ...|$|R
40|$|Chitinase plays a {{positive}} {{role in the}} pathogenicity of Bacillus thuringiensis to insect pests. We used touchdown PCR to clone the chitinase (Schi) gene from Bacillus thuringiensis serovar sotto (Bt sotto) chromosomal DNA. Our DNA sequencing analysis revealed that the Bt sotto Schi gene consists of an open reading frame (ORF) of 2067 nucleotides with codes for the chitinase precursor. We {{also found that the}} putative promoter consensus sequences (the - 35 and - 10 regions) of the Bt soto Schi gene are identical to those of the chiA 71 gene <b>from</b> <b>Bt</b> Pakistani, the chiA 74 gene <b>from</b> <b>Bt</b> kenyae and the ichi gene <b>from</b> <b>Bt</b> israelensis. The Schi chitinase precursor is 688 amino acids long with an estimated molecular mass of 75. 75 kDa and a theoretical isoelectric point of 5. 74, and contains four domains, which are, in sequence, a signal peptide, an N-terminal catalytic domain, a fibronectin type III like domain and a C-terminal chitin-binding domain. Sequence comparison and the evolutionary relationship of the Bt sotto Schi chitinase to other chitinase and chitinase-like proteins are also discussed...|$|R

40|$|Summary We {{compared}} embryogenic {{capacities of}} integument explants excised from three {{sources of the}} Hevea brasiliensis (Müll. Arg.) mature genotype PB 260. The three sources were 17 -year-old (BT 86) and 7 -year-old (BT 96) budded trees and 7 -year-old emblings (EM 96). The highest proportions of embryogenic calluses obtained from {{the total number of}} integument explants initially used were from trees of EM 96 origin, followed by BT 96 trees, with explants <b>from</b> <b>BT</b> 86 trees producing the lowest number of embryogenic calluses. Further initiation of embryogenic callus lines from the primary somatic embryos derived from the three sources was successful only for EM 96. Somatic embryo cultures <b>from</b> <b>BT</b> 86 and BT 96 sources produced only friable calluses that could not be further amplified. Overall, somatic embryo explants derived from EM 96 responded over a wider range of 3, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and kine-tin concentrations than the somatic embryo explants <b>from</b> <b>BT</b> 86 and BT 96 origins.
