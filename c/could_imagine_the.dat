25|$|Gleason {{was raised}} by his mother. When she died in 1935 of sepsis from a large neck {{carbuncle}} (which young Jackie had tried to lance), Gleason was 19, he had nowhere to go, and he had 36 cents to his name. The family of his first girlfriend, Julie Dennehy, offered to take him in; Gleason, however, was headstrong and insisted {{that he was going}} {{into the heart of the}} city. His friend Sammy Birch made room for him in the hotel room he shared with another comedian. Birch also told him of a weeklong gig in Reading, Pennsylvania, that would pay $19, more money than Gleason <b>could</b> <b>imagine.</b> <b>The</b> booking agent advanced him bus fare for the trip against his salary. This was Gleason's first job as a professional comedian; henceforth, he would always have regular work in small clubs.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{had mixed}} {{opinions}} on the characters. Generally, reviewers liked the character interactions. IGN praised the diverse characters but panned Milla's english voice acting. Game Revolution felt the characters were relatable and agreed with IGN about Milla's voice noting it sounded robotic and forced. Electronic Gaming Monthly described the characters as rather normal and competent compared to the previous Tales games, adding that they <b>could</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>the</b> cast having lives and dreams outside of the party's journey. Edge described the character interactions as engaging, well written, and praised how the characters avoided the cliché found in manga and anime. Oppositely, PlayStation Official Magazine felt the characters [...] "fall into the familiar anime archtypes" [...] and that [...] "flat voice acting and a melodramatic script" [...] {{made it difficult to}} feel invested in the cast; Polygon agreed about the character archetypes and called it a lazy strategy used to make the characters understandable.|$|E
500|$|Bird {{stuck to}} {{elaborate}} scene planning, such as detailed animatics, {{to make sure}} there were no budgetary concerns. The team initially worked with Macromedia's Director software, before switching to Adobe After Effects full-time. Bird was eager to use the then-nascent software, as it allowed for storyboard to contain indications of camera moves. The software became essential to that team—dubbed [...] "Macro" [...] early on—to help the studio grasp story reels for the film. These also allowed Bird to better understand what the film required from an editing perspective. In the end, he was proud of the way the film was developed, noting that [...] "We <b>could</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>the</b> pace and the unfolding of our film accurately with a relatively small expenditure of resources." [...] The group would gather in a screening room to view completed sequences, with Bird offering suggestions by drawing onto the screen with a marker. Lead animator Bazley suggested this led to a sense of camaraderie among the crew, who were unified in their mission to create a good film. Bird cited his favorite moment of the film's production as occurring in the editing room, when the crew gathered to test a sequence in which the Giant learns what a soul is. [...] "People in the room were spontaneously crying. It was pivotal; there was an undeniable feeling that we were really tapping into something," [...] he recalled.|$|E

2500|$|The England fast bowler John Snow rescued the England first innings {{when he came}} in at 183/7 {{and made}} 73 to hoist the total up to 304. This was Snow's highest Test and equal highest First Class score, but he was {{disappointed}} not to realise his boyhood dream of a century at Lord's when he was caught off a Chandrasekhar googly. India needed 183 to win in the fourth innings when Snow had the opener Ashok Mankad caught by Knott for 8 and India were 21–2 when Sunil Gavaskar was called for a quick single after hitting the ball to mid-wicket. Snow went for the ball and knocked him over, [...] "I <b>could</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>the</b> horror on the faces of everybody watching the game from the committee room at Lord's". They were both uninjured and continued with the game, and Snow tossed Gavaskar's bat back to him. A similar incident had happened in Georgetown in 1967–68 with Clive Lloyd, but the 5'4" [...] Indian received far more sympathy than the 6'4" [...] West Indian who knocked Snow to the ground. From afar the incident had looked much worse and was replayed repeatedly on slow-motion television. A media furore ensued and with press demanding disciplinary action. The replay {{can be seen in the}} Indian episode of the BBC documentary Empire of Cricket and it certainly appears that Snow recklessly barged into the Gavaskar. Many were more angry about the throwing of the bat back than the knocking him over in the first place. At lunch Snow returned to the dressing room and apologised to the chairman of selectors Alec Bedser and promised to do so to Gavaskar when an enraged Mike Griffith charged in and shouted [...] "That's the most disgusting thing I've ever seen on the field". Illingworth took him out and Snow waited until he had calmed down before apologising to Gavaskar after lunch. When he later saw the replay he said [...] "Oh well, the scene's been far too quiet without me anyway" [...] and realised he could not avoid being dropped for the Second Test. The game was rained off with India needed 38 runs to win, but England wanting only two wickets for victory.|$|E
2500|$|Snow was {{exhausted}} {{after the long}} tour of Australia and apart from his broken finger he suffered from a strained back and shoulder. He was dropped from the Sussex County team because his [...] "bowling performances, and more especially his fielding have been so lacking in effort that the selection committee had no alternative". However, instead of playing for the Sussex Second XI Snow was declared unfit by his doctor and missed {{the first half of}} the season and the Test series against Pakistan. He recovered to take 4/45 & 7/73 against Essex and was picked for the First Test against India at Lord's. He rescued the England first innings when he came in at 183/7 and made 73 to hoist the total up to 304. This was Snow's highest Test and equal highest First Class score, but Snow was disappointed not to realise his boyhood dream of a century at Lord's when he was caught off a Chandrasekhar googly.

The game was rained off with India needing 38 runs to win, but with only two wickets in hand. Snow returned for the Third Test at The Oval and tore off Gavaskar's chain and medallion with a bouncer that zipped under his chin and made him fall over. He bowled the Indian for 6 in the first innings and had him lbw for a duck in the second, but this was not enough to prevent India winning the Test by four wickets and the series with it. It was only the second Test defeat Snow had seen since he had become an England regular in 1966 and ended England's run of 27 Tests without loss.|$|E
