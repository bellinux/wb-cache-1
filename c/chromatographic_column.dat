25|$|A {{completely}} new approach of using SIRs for the separation or purification of biotechnological {{products such as}} proteins {{is based on the}} concept of impregnating porous particles with aqueous polymer solutions developed by B. Burghoff. These so-called Tunable Aqueous Polymer-Phase Impregnated Resins (TAPPIR) enhance aqueous two-phase extraction (ATPE) by applying the SIR technology. During classical aqueous two-phase extraction, biotechnological components such as proteins are extracted from aqueous solutions by using a second aqueous phase. This second aqueous phase contains e.g. polyethylene glycol (PEG). On the one hand, a low density difference and low interfacial tension between the two aqueous phases facilitate comparatively fast mass transfer between the phases. On the other hand, PEG appears to stabilize the protein molecules, which results in a comparatively low protein denaturation during the extraction. However, a significant drawback of ATPE is the persistent emulsification, which makes phase separation a challenge. The idea behind TAPPIR is to use the advantages posed by SIRs, namely low extractant loss due to immobilization in the pores and less emulsification than in liquid-liquid extraction. This way, the drawbacks of ATPE could be remedied. The setup would consist of a packed column or a fluidized bed rather than liquid-liquid extraction equipment with additional phase separation steps. Nonetheless, as yet only first feasibility studies are on the way to prove the concept. Adrawback of this method is the non-conitnous working mode. The packed column is run similar as a <b>chromatographic</b> <b>column.</b>|$|E

40|$|Labeling by isotopic {{exchange}} reactions {{is one of}} the conventional techniques for preparing marked molecules. The use of heterogeneous exchange reactions has the advantage that the labeled product can be separated more easily from the labeled starting material than in homogeneous systems. Fast heterogeneous exchange reactions can also be carried out in a dynamic system by means of gas <b>chromatographic</b> reaction <b>columns.</b> Some years ago we have shown $^{(1), (2) }$ l that labeling of alkyl bromides with bromine- 82 can be readily achieved when carrier-free radio bromine ions were adsorbed on a gas chromatographic adsorbent and the inactive alkyl bromide, injected into the carrier gas, was passed through the adsorbent at elevated temperatures. This method has been extended by us to non-isotopic element exchange reactions on gas <b>chromatographic</b> <b>columns,</b> thus leading to carrier-free labeled alkyl halides when an additional separation column was placed behind the reaction column. This technique is simple and fast since it combines preparation and purification of the labeled compound, and we have used it among others to prepare fluorine- 18 labeled alkyl fluorides.

50|$|In column {{chromatography}} {{a mixture of}} substances is dissolved in a mobile phase and passed over a stationary phase in a column. A selectivity factor {{is defined as the}} ratio of distribution coefficients, which describe the equilibrium distribution of an analyte between the stationary phase and the mobile phase. The selectivity factor is equal to the selectivity coefficient with the added assumption that the activity of the stationary phase, the substrate in this case, is equal to 1, the standard assumption for a pure phase. The resolution of a <b>chromatographic</b> <b>column,</b> RS is related to the selectivity factor by:where α is selectivity factor, N is the number of theoretical plates kA and kB are the retention factors of the two analytes.

50|$|A {{sample of}} water is {{collected}} {{in the field in}} a vial without headspace and capped with a Teflon septum or crimp top to minimize the escape of volatile gases. It is beneficial to store the bottles upside down to further minimize loss of analytes. Before analysis begins, the sample is brought to room temperature and temperature is recorded. In the laboratory, a headspace is created by displacing water with high purity helium. The bottle is then shaken upside down for a minimum of five minutes in order to equilibrate the dissolved gases into the headspace. It’s {{important to note that the}} bottle must be kept upside down for the remainder of analysis if manually injected. A known volume of headspace gas is then injected onto a gas <b>chromatographic</b> <b>column.</b> An automated process can also be utilized. Individual components (gases) are separated and detected by either a thermal conductivity detector (TCD), a flame ionization detector (FID) or an electron capture detector (ECD).

5000|$|Headspace Gas Chromatography uses {{headspace}} gas injected directly onto a gas <b>chromatographic</b> <b>column.</b> Chemists often {{use the phrase}} “standard temperature and pressure or STP” to convey that they are working at a temperature of 25 °C and one atmosphere of pressure. There are three states of matter under these conditions: solids, liquids and gases. Although all three are distinct states both solids and gases can dissolve (or disperse) in liquids. The most commonly occurring liquid in the biosphere is water. All components of the atmosphere are capable of dissolving in water to some degree. The bulk of the stable natural components of the atmosphere are nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, gaseous water, argon and other trace gases. [...] Materials that exist primarily in the gas phase at STP {{are referred to as}} “volatile." [...] Many natural and man-made (anthropogenic) materials are stable in two states at STP, earning them the title “semi-volatile.” A naturally occurring volatile that is sometimes found in aqueous solution is methane, water itself is semi-volatile. Man-made or anthropogenic chemicals also occur in these classes. Examples of volatile anthropogenic chemicals include the refrigerants chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and hydrofluorocarbons (HCFCs). Semivolatile anthropogenics can exist as mixtures, such as petroleum distillates or as pure chemicals like trichloroethylene (TCE). There is a need to analyze the dissolved gas content of aqueous solutions. Dissolved gases can directly interact with aquatic organisms or can volatilize from solution (the latter described by Henry’s Law). These processes can result in exposure that, depending {{on the nature of the}} dissolved material, can have negative health effects. There is natural occurrence of various dissolved gases in groundwater and can be a measure of health for lakes, streams and rivers. Dissolved gases also occur as a result of human contamination from fuel and chlorinated spill sites. This method can be used to determine if there is natural biodegradation processes occurring in contaminated aquifers. For example, fuel hydrocarbons will break down into methane. Chlorinated solvents such as trichloroethylene, break down into ethene and chloride. Detecting these compounds can determine if biodegradation processes are occurring and possibly at what rate. [...] Natural gas extracted from the earth also contains many low molecular weight hydrocarbon compounds such as methane, ethane, propane and butane. For example, methane has been found in many water wells in West Virginia.|$|E

Benzoic acid was most mobile of the synthetic organics but was retained in the Cecil soil by hydrogen bonds to Fe oxides. Toluene probably was hydrophobically sorbed to all soils.

40|$|The {{nonlinear}} {{frequency response}} of a <b>chromatographic</b> <b>column</b> for the adsorption of two dissolved components is analyzed using {{the concept of}} higher order frequency response functions (FRFs) {{which is based on}} the Volterra series and generalized Fourier transform. By applying this concept a nonlinear model of a system is replaced by an infinite series of the FRFs of the first, second, etc. order. The FRFs up to the third order are derived theoretically starting from the equilibrium-dispersive model, which is used for description of a <b>chromatographic</b> <b>column,</b> and applying the harmonic probing method. The functions that relate outlet concentration changes of each component to the corresponding inlet concentration changes are derived. At the inlet of a <b>chromatographic</b> <b>column,</b> it is considered: (a) the concentration change of one of the components keeping the concentration of the other component constant and (b) the concentration change of both components keeping their ratio constant. The FRFs are calculated numerically for different steady-state concentrations and relative mixture compositions. It has been found that, despite certain differences in initial conditions, the FRFs exhibit similar behavior. For higher frequencies, the amplitudes of the FRFs tend to zero and phases to −∞. In the low frequency range, which is of interest for investigation of equilibrium parameters, these functions have similar behavior, but tend to different asymptotic values. Correlations between coefficients of competitive adsorption isotherms, i. e. partial isotherm derivatives, and the derived FRFs are established.
