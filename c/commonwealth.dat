5|$|In the <b>Commonwealth</b> context, too, Britain {{knew that}} simply {{granting}} independence to Southern Rhodesia {{was out of}} the question as many of the Afro-Asian countries were also <b>Commonwealth</b> members. Statehood for Salisbury without majority rule would split the <b>Commonwealth</b> and perhaps cause it to break up, a disastrous prospect for British foreign policy. The <b>Commonwealth</b> repeatedly called on Britain to intervene directly should Southern Rhodesian defiance continue, while liberals in Britain worried that if left unchecked Salisbury might drift towards South African-style apartheid. Anxious to avoid having to choose between Southern Rhodesia and the <b>Commonwealth,</b> Whitehall attempted to negotiate a middle way between the two, but ultimately put international considerations first, regarding them as more important.|$|E

5|$|In {{the times}} of the Polish–Lithuanian <b>Commonwealth</b> (1569–1795), a banner of the <b>Commonwealth</b> was also used, {{combining}} the heraldic symbols of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The <b>Commonwealth</b> banner was initially plain white emblazoned with {{the arms of the}} <b>Commonwealth</b> which consisted of the heraldic charges of Poland (White Eagle) and Lithuania (Pursuer). Since both Polish and Lithuanian coats of arms consisted of white (Argent) charges in a red (Gules) field, these two colors started to be used for the entire banner.
