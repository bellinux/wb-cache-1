40|$|Teachers {{were asked}} to {{identify}} and rank 10 preferred stimuli for 9 toddlers, and a hierarchy of preference for these items was determined via a direct preference assessment. The reinforcing efficacy of the most highly preferred items identified by each method was evaluated concurrently in a reinforcer assessment. The reinforcer assessment showed that all stimuli identified as highly preferred via the direct preference assessment and teacher rankings functioned as reinforcers. The highest ranked stimuli in the direct assessment were more reinforcing than the teachers' top-ranked stimuli for 5 of 9 participants, whereas the teachers' top-ranked stimulus was more reinforcing than the highest ranked stimulus of the direct assessment for only 1 child. A strong positive correlation between rankings generated through the two assessments was identified for only 1 of the 9 participants. Despite poor <b>correspondence</b> <b>between</b> <b>rankings</b> generated through the teacher interview and direct preference assessment, results of the reinforcer assessment suggest that both methods are effective in identifying reinforcers for toddlers...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} <b>correspondences</b> <b>between</b> the {{differences}} among the phones in human speaker identification and their acoustic properties. In the speaker identification test, the Japanese CV syllables excerpted from the carrier sentences were used as the stimuli. As {{pointed out in the}} previous studies, the stimuli containing the nasal sounds were significantly effective for the identification of the speakers, compared to other stimuli containing only the oral sounds. In the acoustic analyses, we analysed the spectral properties of the stimuli in order to explain these differences in the perception test, and we found that the cepstral distances among the speakers were significantly larger in the nasal sounds than in the oral sounds. Also, there were <b>correspondences</b> <b>between</b> the <b>rankings</b> of the consonants in the identification test and in the cepstral distances. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} <b>between</b> reputational <b>rankings</b> {{of political}} science departments and their scholarly productivity remains a source of discussion and controversy. After the National Research Council (1995) published its ranking of 98 political science departments, Katz and Eagles (1996), Jackman and Siverson (1996), and Lowry and Silver (1996) analyzed the factors that seemingly influenced those rankings. Miller, Tien, and Peebler (1996) offered an alternate approach to ranking departments, based both upon the number of faculty (and their graduates) who published in the American Political Science Review and upon the number of citations that faculty members received. More recently, two studies have examined departmental rankings in other ways. Ballard and Mitchell (1998) assessed political science departments by evaluating the level of productivity in nine important disciplinary and subfield journals, and Garand and Graddy (1999) evaluated the impact of journal publications (and other variables) on the rankings {{of political science}} departments. In general, Miller, Tien, and Peebler found {{a high level of}} <b>correspondence</b> <b>between</b> reputation <b>rankings</b> and productivity, Ballard and Mitchell did not, and Garand and Graddy found that publications in “high impact” journals were important for departmental rankings...|$|R
40|$|Observations {{of marine}} air {{temperature}} (MAT) by Voluntary Observing Ships (VOS) {{are known to}} contain significant biases due to solar heating of the sensor environment. MAT and humidity observations are usually made using wet- and dry-bulb thermometers housed in Stevenson screens, or with psychrometers. These instruments are typically mounted in the bridge wings or on the wheel-house top. If not sited carefully then the instruments can be poorly exposed to the undisturbed environmental conditions and have inadequate ventilation, leading to biased observations of both MAT and humidity. In this paper we use observations collected {{as part of the}} VOS Climate (VOSClim) project to investigate the relationship between instrument exposure and heating errors. The heating errors are estimated as the difference between the observed MAT and the collocated output of a numerical weather prediction model. The instrument exposures are assessed from hotographs of the instruments. Currently, photographs of the instruments and sufficient observations exist for 17 VOSClim ships. Two methods of assessing the instrument exposure using the observations are presented. The first method is based on the skewness of the distribution of estimated heating errors for individual ships. The second method is based on a correction developed to correct the heating errors and uses the ratio of the heating to cooling terms in the correction. When ships are ranked both on the skewness and on the ratio of the heating to cooling terms, there is a statistically significant <b>correspondence</b> <b>between</b> the <b>rankings</b> and the visual assessments of instrument exposure. The skewness of the distribution of estimated errors in MAT is proposed as a simple indicator of instrument exposure...|$|R
40|$|Background In this study, a multi-parent {{population}} of barley cultivars was {{grown in the}} field for two consecutive years and then straw saccharification (sugar release by enzymes) was subsequently analysed in the laboratory to identify the cultivars with the highest consistent sugar yield. This experiment was used to assess the benefit of accounting for both the multi-phase and multi-environment aspects of large-scale phenotyping experiments with field-grown germplasm through sound statistical design and analysis. Results Complementary designs at both the field and laboratory phases of the experiment ensured that non-genetic sources of variation could be separated from the genetic variation of cultivars, which was the main target of the study. The field phase included biological replication and plot randomisation. The laboratory phase employed re-randomisation and technical replication of samples within a batch, with a subset of cultivars chosen as duplicates that were randomly allocated across batches. The resulting data was analysed using a linear mixed model that incorporated field and laboratory variation and a cultivar by trial interaction, and ensured that the cultivar means were more accurately represented than if the non-genetic variation was ignored. The heritability detected was more than doubled in each year of the trial by accounting for the non-genetic variation in the analysis, clearly showing the benefit of this design and approach. Conclusions The importance of accounting for both field and laboratory variation, as well as the cultivar by trial interaction, by fitting a single statistical model (multi-environment trial, MET, model), was evidenced by the changes in list of the top 40 cultivars showing the highest sugar yields. Failure to account for this interaction resulted in only eight cultivars that were consistently in the top 40 in different years. The <b>correspondence</b> <b>between</b> the <b>rankings</b> of cultivars was much higher at 25 in the MET model. This approach is suited to any multi-phase and multi-environment population-based genetic experiment...|$|R
40|$|Rank {{correlation}} {{statistics are}} useful for determining whether a there is a <b>correspondence</b> <b>between</b> two measurements, par-ticularly when the measures themselves are of less interest than their relative ordering. Kendall’s τ in particular has found use in Information Retrieval as a “meta-evaluation” measure: {{it has been used}} to compare evaluation measures, evaluate system rankings, and evaluate predicted perfor-mance. In the meta-evaluation domain, however, correla-tions between systems confound relationships between mea-surements, practically guaranteeing a positive and signifi-cant estimate of τ regardless of any actual correlation be-tween the measurements. We introduce an alternative mea-sure of distance <b>between</b> <b>rankings</b> that corrects this by ex-plicitly accounting for correlations between systems over a sample of topics, and moreover has a probabilistic interpre-tation for use in a test of statistical significance. We validate our measure with theory, simulated data, and experiment...|$|R
