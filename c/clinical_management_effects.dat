40|$|Young {{patients}} with class II skeletal malocclusion are often found. To avoid further discrepancy of this case, myofunctional therapy {{is one of}} the options. Functional appliance often used for such treatment. Functional appliance has been modified since activator was introduced by Andresen. With its bulky shape, activator makes difficulty for patient to speak and eat. Patient unable to wear it full time due to uncomfortness and negative facial appearance. In 1977, Clark developed twin block to overcome the weakness of previous appliances. A more simple design allows patient to be more comfortable and willing to wear it longer. Twin block is myofunctional appliance to reposition the mandible forward for skeletal class II correction with retruded mandible. This paper describes the design, <b>clinical</b> <b>management</b> <b>effects</b> of twin block treatment and brief case presentation using twin block appliance. Similar to the study reports found, this case revealed improvement of facial appearance, decrease overjet and overbite, improvement of molar relationship and good compliance of patient. </p...|$|E
40|$|In {{this chapter}} of the Evidence-based Practice Centers Methods Guide for Medical Tests, we {{describe}} how {{the decision to use}} a medical test generates a broad range of outcomes and that each of these outcomes should be considered for inclusion in a systematic review. Awareness of these varied outcomes affects how a decision maker balances the benefits and risks of the test; therefore, a systematic review should present the evidence on these diverse outcomes. The key outcome categories include clinical management outcomes and direct health effects; emotional, social, cognitive, and behavioral responses to testing; legal and ethical outcomes, and costs. We describe the challenges of incorporating these outcomes in a systematic review, suggest a framework for generating potential outcomes for inclusion, and describe the role of stakeholders in choosing the outcomes for study. Finally, we give examples of systematic reviews that either included a range of outcomes or that might have done so. The following are the key messages in this chapter: Consider both the outcomes that are relevant to the process of testing and those that are relevant to the results of the test. Consider inclusion of outcomes in all five domains: <b>clinical</b> <b>management</b> <b>effects,</b> direct test effects; emotional, social, cognitive and behavioral effects; legal and ethical effects, and costs. Consider to which group the outcomes of testing are most relevant. Given resource limitations, prioritize which outcomes to include. This decision depends on the needs of the stakeholder(s), who should be assisted in prioritizing the outcomes for inclusion...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The {{organization}} of trauma care has different perspectives {{that depend on}} regional aspects. Among these, geographical peculiarities, historical developments regarding development of medical subspecialties and resident education {{appear to be the}} most relevant factors. Methods: We performed a structured literature search on PubMed. Results and Conclusion: This manuscript deals with the differences of several trauma systems in certain European countries, the USA and Australia. It aims to provide an overview of the peculiarities and influences of these systems on the <b>clinical</b> <b>management.</b> However, the <b>effect</b> of differences in organization in different countries on patient outcome is difficult to assess. There appears to be consensus on the fact that structured treatment for acute trauma care is beneficial for trauma patients. Thus, any kind of organization contributes to improved patient outcome...|$|R
40|$|Side {{effects are}} among the most {{frequent}} reasons preventing patients from taking their medication. Although the <b>management</b> of side <b>effects</b> is an important issue in clinical practice, particularly in patients with physical comorbidities, research on <b>clinical</b> <b>management</b> of side <b>effects</b> is rather scattered. The aim of this article was to provide an overview on the prevalence and management of various side effects of mood-stabilizing drugs. In December 2012, we carried out a PubMed search for publications reporting side effects in patients with bipolar disorder. Naturalistic studies describing the prevalence of side effects in treatment with mood stabilizers are sparse. We describe the prevalence of neurological, gastrointestinal, metabolic, thyroid, dermatological, nephrogenic, cognitive, sexual, hematological, hepatogenic, and teratogenic side effects of lithium, valproate, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine and discuss their <b>clinical</b> <b>management.</b> There are specific strategies that aim at reducing side effects, but, to date, studies on the efficacy of these interventions are lacking. With age, the renal elimination and hepatic metabolism of drugs reduce and comedication and somatic comorbidity increase, making elderly patients particularly susceptible to side effects. Most side effects can be managed by striving for the lowest possible dose without losing efficacy by lowering the dose below the therapeutic window. Specific measurements to limit certain side effects are available and may ameliorate treatment adherence. Â© 2013 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins...|$|R
40|$|The role of E-cadherin in Hereditary Diffuse Gastric Cancer (HDGC) is unequivocal. Germline {{alterations}} in its encoding gene (CDH 1) are causative of HDGC and occur in about 40 % of patients. Importantly, while {{in most cases}} CDH 1 alterations result in {{the complete loss of}} E-cadherin associated with a well-established clinical impact, in about 20 % of cases the mutations are of the missense type. The latter are of particular concern in terms of genetic counselling and <b>clinical</b> <b>management,</b> as the <b>effect</b> of the sequence variants in E-cadherin function is not predictable. If a deleterious variant is identified, prophylactic surgery could be recommended. Therefore, over the last few years, intensive research has focused on evaluating the functional consequences of CDH 1 missense variants and in assessing E-cadherin pathogenicity. In that context, our group has contributed to better characterize CDH 1 germline missense variants and is now considered a worldwide reference centre. In this review, we highlight {{the state of the art}} methodologies to categorize CDH 1 variants, as neutral or deleterious. This information is subsequently integrated with clinical data for genetic counseling and management of CDH 1 variant carriers...|$|R
40|$|Background: Australia and New Zealand {{have the}} highest {{incidence}} of colorectal cancer (CRC) in the world, presenting considerable health, economic, and societal burden. Over {{a third of the}} Australian population live in regional areas and research has shown they experience a range of health disadvantages that result in a higher disease burden and lower life expectancy. The extent to which geographical disparities exist in CRC management and outcomes has not been systematically explored. The present review aims to identify the nature of geographical disparities in CRC survival, <b>clinical</b> <b>management,</b> and psychosocial outcomes. Methods: The review followed PRISMA guidelines and searches were undertaken using seven databases covering articles between 1 January 1990 and 20 April 2016 in an Australian setting. Inclusion criteria stipulated studies had to be peer-reviewed, in English, reporting data from Australia on CRC patients and relevant to one of fourteen questions examining geographical variations in a) survival outcomes, b) patient and cancer characteristics, c) diagnostic and treatment characteristics and d) psychosocial and quality of life outcomes. Results: Thirty-eight quantitative, two qualitative, and three mixed-methods studies met review criteria. Twenty-seven studies were of high quality, sixteen studies were of moderate quality, and no studies were found to be low quality. Individuals with CRC living in regional, rural, and remote areas of Australia showed poorer survival and experienced less optimal <b>clinical</b> <b>management.</b> However, this <b>effect</b> is likely moderated by a range of other factors (e. g., SES, age, gender) and did appear to vary linearly with increasing distance from metropolitan centres. No studies examined differences in use of stoma, or support with stomas, by geographic location. Conclusions: Overall, despite evidence of disparity in CRC survival and <b>clinical</b> <b>management</b> across geographic locations, the evidence was limited and at times inconsistent. Further, access to treatment and services may not be the main driver of disparities, with individual patient characteristics and type of region also playing an important role. A better understanding of factors driving ongoing and significant geographical disparities in cancer related outcomes is required to inform the development of effective interventions to improve the health and welfare of regional Australians.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{quantify}} inter- and intra-observer {{agreement of}} non-reassuring intrapartum cardiotocography (CTG) patterns and subsequent <b>clinical</b> <b>management.</b> DESIGN: Methodological study. SETTING: University Medical Center. POPULATION: CTG patterns of 79 women beyond 37 weeks of gestation with a singleton fetus in vertex position in {{first stage of}} labor in whom fetal blood sampling (FBS) had been performed. METHODS: Nine observers assessed CTG patterns, which were formerly clinically classified as non-reassuring and indicative for FBS, according to the guidelines of the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics modified for ST analysis. They also proposed <b>clinical</b> <b>management</b> strategies without and with insight into clinical parameters. Weighted kappa values (kappaw) and proportions of agreement (Pa) were calculated. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Agreement on CTG classification and <b>clinical</b> <b>management.</b> RESULTS: Inter-observer agreement on CTG classification and on <b>clinical</b> <b>management</b> were poor for most observer categories (kappaw range 0. 31 - 0. 50 and 0. 20 - 0. 45, respectively). Observers agreed best on abnormal CTG patterns (Pa range 0. 28 - 0. 36) and on the <b>clinical</b> <b>management</b> option "continue monitoring" (Pa range 0. 32 - 0. 40). Intra-observer agreement was fair to good for most observers (kappaw 0. 33 - 0. 70). Insight into clinical parameters resulted in similar inter- and intra-observer agreement. CONCLUSIONS: There was poor inter-observer agreement and fair to good intra-observer agreement on classification and <b>clinical</b> <b>management</b> of intrapartum CTG patterns, which had been classified as non-reassuring and indicative for FBS during birth...|$|R

Cognitive behavior treatment of residual symptoms {{was found to}} yield a significantly lower relapse rate than <b>clinical</b> <b>management</b> in recurrent depression at a 2 -year follow-up. The objective {{of this investigation was}} to provide a 6 -year follow-up of cognitive behavior treatment versus <b>clinical</b> <b>management.</b> METHOD: Forty patients with recurrent major depression who had been successfully treated with antidepressant drugs were randomly assigned to either cognitive behavior treatment of residual symptoms (supplemented by lifestyle modification and well-being therapy) or <b>clinical</b> <b>management.</b> In both groups, antidepressant drugs were tapered and discontinued. A 6 -year follow-up was undertaken. During this period, no antidepressant drugs were used unless a relapse ensued. RESULTS: Cognitive behavior treatment resulted in a significantly lower relapse rate (40 %) at a 6 -year follow-up than did <b>clinical</b> <b>management</b> (90 %). When multiple recurrences were considered, the group that received cognitive behavior treatment had a significantly lower number of relapses in comparison with the <b>clinical</b> <b>management</b> group. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the sequential use of cognitive behavior treatment after pharmacotherapy may improve the long-term outcome in recurrent depression. A significant proportion of patients with recurrent depression might be able to withdraw from medication successfully and to stay well for at least 6 years with a focused course of psychotherapy...|$|R
