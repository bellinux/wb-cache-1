At first Bågenholm {{struggled}} in the cold water before she found an air pocket and was able to remain conscious for 40minutes before becoming a victim of <b>circulatory</b> <b>arrest.</b> Ketil Singstad led the rescue team {{from the top of the}} mountain. He skied as fast as he could to Bågenholm's location, where he and his rescue team tried unsuccessfully to pull her out with a rope. They then tried to dig her out, but their snow shovel could not break through the ice. Rescuers from the bottom of the mountain then arrived, bringing with them a pointed gardening shovel. They were able to cut a hole in the ice, and pulled her through at 19:40. Bågenholm had been in the water for 80minutes when she was rescued.|$|E

40|$|Animal {{studies have}} shown that the {{increased}} intravenous pressure stimulates the group III and IV muscle afferent fibres, and in turn induce cardiovascular responses. However, this pathway of autonomic regulation has not been examined in humans. The aim of this study was to examine the hypothesis that infusion of saline into the venous circulation of an arterially occluded vascular bed evokes sympathetic activation in healthy individuals. Blood pressure, heart rate, and muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) responses were assessed in 19 young healthy subjects during local infusion of 40 ml saline into a forearm vein in the <b>circulatory</b> <b>arrested</b> condition. From baseline (11. 8 ± 1. 2 bursts min− 1), MSNA increased significantly during the saline infusion (22. 5 ± 2. 6 bursts min− 1, P < 0. 001). Blood pressure also increased significantly during the saline infusion. Three control trials were performed during separate visits. The results from the control trial show that the observed MSNA and blood pressure responses were not due to muscle ischaemia. The present data show that saline infusion into the venous circulation of an arterially occluded vascular bed induces sympathetic activation and an increase in blood pressure. We speculate that the infusion under such conditions stimulates the afferent endings near the vessels, and evokes the sympathetic activation...|$|R
40|$|Total {{stressed}} blood {{volume is}} an important parameter for both doctors and engineers. From a medical point of view, it {{has been associated with}} {{the success or failure of}} fluid resuscitation therapy, which is a treatment for cardiac failure. From an engineering point of view, this parameter dictates the cardiovascular system's dynamic behavior. Current methods to determine this parameter involve repeated phases of <b>circulatory</b> <b>arrests</b> followed by fluid administration. In this work, a method is developed to compute stressed blood volume from preload reduction experiments. A simple six-chamber cardiovascular system model is used and its parameters are adjusted to pig experimental data. The parameter adjustment process has three steps: (1) compute nominal values for all model parameters; (2) determine the most sensitive parameters; and (3) adjust only these sensitive parameters. Stressed blood volume was determined sensitive for all datasets, which emphasizes the importance of this parameter. The model was able to track experimental trends with a maximal mean squared error of 11. 77 %. Stressed blood volume has been computed to range between 450 and 963 ml, or 15 to 28 ml/kg, which matches previous independent experiments on pigs, dogs and humans. Consequently, the method proposed in this work provides a simple way to compute total stressed blood volume from usual hemodynamic data...|$|R

500|$|Despite {{the severe}} damage to Bågenholm's body, no {{permanent}} brain damage was diagnosed. Gilbert commented on this: [...] "Her body {{had time to}} cool down completely before the heart stopped. Her brain was so cold when the heart stopped that the brain cells needed very little oxygen, so the brain could survive for quite a prolonged time."

The interatrial septum is punctured and the catheter passed into the left atrium using a [...] "trans-septal technique." [...] The balloon is sub-divided into 3 segments and is dilated in 3 stages. First, the distal portion (lying in the left ventricle) is inflated and pulled against the valve cusps. Second, the proximal portion is dilated, in order to fix the centre segment at the valve orifice. Finally, the central section is inflated, this should take no longer than 30 seconds, since full inflation obstructs the valve and causes congestion, leading to <b>circulatory</b> <b>arrest</b> and flash pulmonary edema.|$|E
5000|$|Cardiopulmonary bypass {{machines}} were {{essential to the}} development of deep hypothermic <b>circulatory</b> <b>arrest</b> (DHCA) in humans. [...] By 1959, it was known from the animal experiments of Bigelow, Andjus and Smith, Gollan, Lewis's colleague, Niazi, and others that temperatures near 0°C could be survived by mammals, [...] and that colder temperature permitted the brain to survive longer <b>circulatory</b> <b>arrest</b> times, even beyond one hour. Humans had survived cooling to 9°C, and <b>circulatory</b> <b>arrest</b> of 45 minutes, using external cooling only. However, reaching such low temperatures by external cooling was difficult and hazardous. At temperatures below 24°C, the human heart is prone to fibrillation and stopping. This can begin <b>circulatory</b> <b>arrest</b> before the brain has reached a safe temperature. Cardiopulmonary bypass machines allow blood circulation and cooling to continue below the temperature at which the heart stops working. By cooling blood directly, cardiopulmonary bypass also cools people faster than surface cooling, even if the heart is not functioning.|$|E
40|$|Muscle metaboreceptors and {{peripheral}} chemoreceptors exert {{differential effects}} on the cardiorespiratory and autonomic responses following hypoxic exercise. Whether these effects are accompanied by specific changes in sympathetic and cardiac baroreflex control is not known. Sympathetic and cardiac baroreflex functions were assessed by intravenous nitroprusside and phenylephrine boluses in 15 young male subjects. Recordings were performed in random order, under locally <b>circulatory</b> <b>arrested</b> conditions, during: (1) rest and normoxia (no metaboreflex and no chemoreflex activation); (2) normoxic post-handgrip exercise at 30 % of maximum voluntary contraction (metaboreflex activation without chemoreflex activation); (3) hypoxia without handgrip (10 % O 2 in N 2, chemoreflex activation without metaboreflex activation); and (4) post-handgrip exercise in hypoxia (chemoreflex and metaboreflex activation). When compared with normoxic rest (- 42 +/- 7 % muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) mmHg(- 1)), sympathetic baroreflex sensitivity did not change during normoxic post-exercise ischaemia (PEI; - 53 +/- 9 % MSNA mmHg(- 1), P = 0. 5) and increased during resting hypoxia (- 68 +/- 5 % MSNA mmHg(- 1), P < 0. 01). Sympathetic baroreflex sensitivity decreased during PEI in hypoxia (- 35 +/- 6 % MSNA mmHg(- 1), P < 0. 001 versus hypoxia without exercise; P = 0. 16 versus normoxic PEI). Conversely, when compared with normoxic rest (11. 1 +/- 1. 7 ms mmHg(- 1)), cardiac baroreflex sensitivity did not change during normoxic PEI (8. 3 +/- 1. 3 ms mmHg(- 1), P = 0. 09), but decreased during resting hypoxia (7. 3 +/- 0. 8 ms mmHg(- 1), P < 0. 05). Cardiac baroreflex sensitivity was lowest during PEI in hypoxia (4. 3 +/- 1 ms mmHg(- 1), P < 0. 01 versus hypoxia without exercise; P < 0. 001 versus normoxic exercise). The metaboreceptors and chemoreceptors exert differential effects on sympathetic and cardiac baroreflex function. Metaboreceptor activation is the major determinant of sympathetic baroreflex sensitivity, when these receptors are stimulated {{in the presence of}} hypoxia.

40|$|The {{biology of}} human beings is not {{constant}} during the 24 hours, menstrual cycle, and year as inferred by the concept of homeostasis. Instead, most of life's functions vary predictably and often dramatically over these and other time periods. Circadian rhythms, in particular, are of great importance to clinical medicine in general (565) and to CV medicine in particular. In this chapter, we discussed in great detail the 24 -hour patterns of BP, HR and other CV hemodynamics in normal and hypertensive states. These patterns arise from circadian rhythms in neuroendocrine and other functions plus day-night differences in physical activity, mental strain, and posture. In hypertensive patients at risk to CV events, the staging of the peak and trough of these critical circadian rhythms gives rise to an increased vulnerability to angina, myocardial infarct, sudden cardiac death, and stroke {{in the morning when}} environmental triggers of CV events tend to be most intense. Not only does the vulnerability to myocardial infarct vary during the 24 hours, but so does its clinical course (566). Symptom onset between 6. 00 h and noon is associated with greatest infarct size, whereas an onset time between midnight and 6. 00 h is associated with significantly lower risk of <b>circulatory</b> <b>arrests</b> from ventricular arrhythmias (567). Moreover, the circadian-time-dependent occurrence of myocardial infarction is likely to affect the success of thrombolysis, which {{has been shown to be}} less in patients who have a morning onset (568). Finally, the body’s biological time structure can also exert significant influence on the pharmacokinetics and effects of antihypertensive and other medications used to treat hypertensive and other CV conditions. This will be discussed in depth in another chapter of this volume. Nonetheless, the prominent circadian patterns in BP, myocardial oxygen demand, coagulation and CV events bring to fore the concept of chronotherapeutics — medications which proportion their concentration during the 24 hours in synchrony with day-night differences in the biological requirement for therapy. In the United States two verapamil chronotherapies are now approved by the Food and Drug Administration. One is approved for the treatment of angina pectoris and both are approved for the treatment of hypertension. These chronotherapies have been shown to be effective in attenuating the rapid rise of BP in morning and elevated level during daytime activity without inducing super-dipping of BP during sleep. Nonetheless, it is not yet known whether they afford primary protection against CV morbidity and morality in the long term. The answer to this question must await the completion of the CONVINCE trial that entails the comparison of conventional equal-interval, equal-dose, ß-blocker and diuretic therapy versus verapamil chronotherapy dosed once daily in the evening (569) ...|$|R
40|$|The metastatic {{spread of}} cancer {{is still the}} major barrier to the {{treatment}} of this disease. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the metastatic process is of crucial importance to tune novel therapeutic strategies aimed at contrasting the dissemination of cancer. Metastasis is a sequential multistep process that ultimately leads to the cancer's outgrowth in a different organ from which it had originated. This clinically and experimentally involves the following steps: invasion of adjacent tissues, intravasation, transport of cancer cells through the <b>circulatory</b> system, <b>arrest</b> at a secondary site, extravasation and growth in a secondary organ. Additionally, tumor growth and metastasis depend on the ability of the tumor to induce its own blood supply through angiogenesis. Each of these steps can potentially be targeted by therapeutic agents, but the limited knowledge regarding the molecular events of metastasis makes most therapeutic strategies largely inefficient. However, important methodological advances have recently led to further insights into the biology of metastasis, thus raising the possibility of designing more appropriate pharmacological strategies to contrast the specific steps of the metastatic process. A variety of pharmacological approaches including inhibition of tumor invasion, angiogenesis, signal transduction pathways, and most recently the targeting of tumor stroma, are now under fervent development. Benefits and limits of these approaches, as well as, new therapeutic opportunities are herein discussed. Agents that limit any phase of the metastatic process may be therapeutically useful. Therefore, the future pharmacological challenge will be to combine drugs that target different aspects of this complex multistep process...|$|R

40|$|Distant metastases, which {{result in}} > 90 % of cancer related deaths, is enabled by hematogenous {{dissemination}} of tumor cells via the circulation. In particular, tumor cell extravasation {{is thought to}} be an essential and potential rate-limiting step, as most metastases are found in the extravascular space rather than intraluminal at distant organs. However, mechanistic insights into the cellular and molecular players during extravasation are limited due to technical challenges in observing real-time events in vivo. Increased understanding of the extravasation cascade is critical in uncovering new opportunities for therapeutic intervention during early metastatic dissemination. In this thesis, we develop an in vitro model of the human microcirculation with the capability to recapitulate several discrete steps of hematogenous dissemination, including tumor cell <b>circulatory</b> transport, <b>arrest,</b> and transendothelial migration. The microdevice features self-organized human microvascular networks through which tumor cells can be perfused and tracked over time via standard confocal microscopy. In addition to improved throughput for parametric studies, robust and rapid scoring of extravascular cells combined with high spatio-resolution imaging for deciphering cell morphological dynamics can be easily achieved due to excellent optical accessibility. To demonstrate the ability to obtain novel biological insights, we apply the assay to decipher the roles of tumor integrins in modulating extravasation. In particular, we deplete integrin beta- 1 in tumor cells and isolate the specific defects in the extravasation cascade. Dynamic imaging revealed that [beta] 1 -depleted cells lacked the ability to sustain protrusions into the subendothelial matrix in contrast to control cells. Specifically, adhesion via [alpha] 3 [beta] 1 and [alpha] 6 [beta] 1 to subendothelial laminin was a critical prerequisite for successful transmigration, as well as basement membrane breaching. Combined with validation from in vivo metastasis assays, we find that tumor beta- 1 integrin is a critical mediator of extravasation and metastases formation. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential of our assay to recapitulate the complexities of the host microenvironment via modular addition of non-cancer host cells. Specifically, we explore the interactions of circulating human neutrophils with tumor cells and demonstrate that their interactions can exert pro-extravasation effects through neutrophil-derived IL- 8. Through high spatio-temporal resolution imaging, we further identify novel mechanisms through which neutrophils are sequestered and confined at the vicinity of trapped tumor cells during flow conditions, and how the spatial localization of their secreted factors can act to facilitate tumor transmigration.

40|$|Objectives: Despite {{advances}} in resuscitation methods, survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest remains low, {{at least in}} part, due to postcardiac <b>arrest</b> <b>circulatory</b> and neurologic failure. To elucidate the role of nitric oxide (NO) in the recovery from cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), we studied the impact of NO synthase (NOS 3) /cGMP signaling on cardiac and neurologic outcomes after cardiac arrest and CPR. Design: Prospective, randomized, controlled study. Setting: Animal research laboratory. Subjects: Mice. Interventions. Female wild-type (WT) mice, NOS 3 -deficient mice (NOS 3 (-/-)), NOS 3 (-/-) mice with cardiomyocyte-specific overexpression of NOS 3 (NOS 3 (-/-) CSTg), and mice deficient for soluble guanylate cyclase (alpha 1 (sGC alpha 1 (-/-)) were subjected to potassium-induced cardiac arrest (9 min) followed by CPR. Cardiac and neurologic function and survival were assessed up to 24 hrs post-CPR. Measurements and Main Results: Cardiac arrest and CPR markedly depressed myocardial function in NOS 3 (-/-) and sGC alpha(-/-) but not in WT and NOS 3 (-/-) CSTg. Neurologic function score and 24 hrs survival rate was lower in NOS 3 (-/-) and sGC alpha 1 (-/-) compared with WT and NOS 3 (-/-) CSTg. Detrimental effects of deficiency of NOS 3 or sGC alpha 1 were associated with enhanced inflammation of heart and liver and increased cell death in heart, liver, and brain that were largely prevented by cardiomyocyte-restricted NOS 3 overexpression. Conclusions: These results demonstrate an important salutary impact of NOS 3 /sGC signaling {{on the outcome of}} cardiac arrest. Myocardial NOS 3 prevented postcardiac arrest myocardial dysfunction, attenuated end-organ damage, and improved neurologic outcome and survival. Our observations suggest that enhancement Of cardiac NOS 3 and/or sGC activity may improve outcome after cardiac arrest and CPR...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine whether a composite outcome, derived of objective signs of inadequate cardiac output, would be associated with other important measures of outcomes and therefore be an appropriate end point for clinical trials in neonatal cardiac surgery. MethodsNeonates (n =  76) undergoing cardiac operations requiring cardiopulmonary bypass were prospectively enrolled. Patients were defined to have met the composite outcome if they had any of the following events before hospital discharge: death, the use of mechanical <b>circulatory</b> support, cardiac <b>arrest</b> requiring chest compressions, hepatic injury (2 times the upper limit of normal for aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase), renal injury (creatinine > 1. 5  mg/dL), or lactic acidosis (an increasing lactate > 5  mmol/L in the postoperative period). Associations between the composite outcome and the duration of mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit stay, hospital stay, and total hospital charges were determined. ResultsThe median age at the time of surgery was 7  days, and the median weight was 3. 2  kg. The composite outcome was met in 39 % of patients (30 / 76). Patients who met the composite outcome compared with those who did not had a longer duration of mechanical ventilation (4. 9 vs 2. 9  days, P < . 01), intensive care unit stay (8. 8 vs 5. 7  days, P < . 01), hospital stay (23 vs 12  days, P < . 01), and increased hospital charges ($ 258, 000 vs $ 170, 000, P < . 01).

40|$|Constriction of prey by gopher snakes Pituophis melanoleucus {{and king}} snakes Lampropeltis getula is highly {{variable}} in posture, muscular activity and force exertion. These snakes typically use lateral bends of the anterior trunk to wind the {{body into a}} vertical coil around the prey. Three common constriction postures are fully encircling loops that form a coil, partially encircling loops, and non-encircling loops that pinion the prey. Initial tightening of a coil occurs by winding or pressing the loops tighter to reduce {{the diameter of the}} coil. The epaxial muscles are highly active during striking and coil formation and intermittently active during sustained constriction. These results refute the hypothesis of a mechanical constraint on constriction in snakes with elongate epaxial muscles. Constricting gopher and king snakes can detect muscular, ventilatory and circulatory movements in rodent prey. In response to simulated heartbeats or ventilation in mice, the snakes twitch visibly, recruit epaxial muscle activity, and increase constriction pressure temporarily, but then quickly relax. Muscular activity and constriction pressure are increased most and sustained longest in response to muscular struggling in prey. Although muscle activity and pressure exertion are intermittent, the constriction posture is maintained until the prey has been completely still for several seconds; thus, a snake can reapply pressure in response to any circulatory, ventilatory or muscular movement by the prey. The pressures of 6. 1 – 30. 9 kPa (46 – 232 mm Hg) exerted on small mammal prey by constricting snakes range from about half to over twice a mouse's systolic blood pressure, and are probably 10 times larger than the venous pressure. These high pressures probably kill mammalian prey by inducing immediate <b>circulatory</b> and cardiac <b>arrest,</b> rather than by suffocation alone...|$|R

50|$|One of the {{anticipated}} medical uses of long <b>circulatory</b> <b>arrest</b> times, or so-called clinical suspended animation, is treatment of traumatic injury. In 1984 CPR pioneer Peter Safar and U.S. Army surgeon Ronald Bellamy proposed suspended animation by hypothermic <b>circulatory</b> <b>arrest</b> {{as a way}} of saving people who had exsanguinated from traumatic injuries to the trunk of the body. Exsanguination is blood loss severe enough to cause death. Until the 1980s, it had been thought impossible to resuscitate victims whose heart stopped because of blood loss, resulting in these victims being declared dead when cardiac resuscitation failed. Traditional treatments such as CPR and fluid replacement or blood transfusion are not effective when cardiac arrest has already occurred and bleeding remains uncontrolled. Safar and Bellamy proposed flushing cold solution through blood vessels of victims of deadly bleeding, and leaving them in a state of cold <b>circulatory</b> <b>arrest</b> with the heart stopped until the cause of bleeding could be surgically repaired to allow later resuscitation. In preclinical studies at the University of Pittsburgh during the 1990s, the process was called deep hypothermia for preservation and resuscitation, and then suspended animation for delayed resuscitation.|$|E
