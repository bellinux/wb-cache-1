40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss the {{properties}} of optically induced birefringence in DR 19 -MDI <b>cast</b> <b>films</b> {{that may be used}} in optical storage applications. The selection of DR 19 -MDI <b>cast</b> <b>films</b> was based on a comparative study of optical storage properties of Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films from various azopolymers. DR 19 -MDI possesses a high residual fraction of optical birefringence and good environmental stability, which was corroborated by the data from optical storage experiments. DR 19 -MDI <b>cast</b> <b>films</b> maintain a reasonable level of birefringence after the initial decay due to chromophore relaxation, thus making them promising candidates for optical storage devices...|$|R
40|$|Poly(p-phenylene vinylene) (PPV) {{derivatives}} {{are well}} known for their applications in polymer light emitting diodes (PLEDs). PPV derivatives are highly susceptible to photo-oxidation though, which is mainly caused by the scission of the vinyl double bond on the polymer backbone. In this work, we show that LangmuireBlodgett (LB) films are less degraded than <b>cast</b> <b>films</b> of a PPV derivative (OC 1 OC 6 -PPV). Both films had similar thickness (w 50 nm) {{to allow for a}} more realistic comparison. Degradation was monitored with UVevis and FTIR spectroscopies. The results indicated that <b>cast</b> <b>films</b> were completely degraded in ca. 400 min, while LB took longer time, i. e. about four times the values for the <b>cast</b> <b>films.</b> The differences {{can be attributed to the}} more compact morphology in the LB than in the <b>cast</b> <b>films.</b> With a compact morphology the diffusion of oxygen in the LB film is hampered and this causes a delay in the degradation process...|$|R

25|$|In {{order to}} save costs, an {{increasing}} number of polyester intermediate producers like spinning mills, strapping mills, or <b>cast</b> <b>film</b> mills are working on the direct use of the PET-flakes, from the treatment of used bottles, with a view to manufacturing {{an increasing number of}} polyester intermediates. For the adjustment of the necessary viscosity, besides an efficient drying of the flakes, it is possibly necessary to also reconstitute the viscosity through polycondensation in the melt phase or solid-state polycondensation of the flakes. The latest PET flake conversion processes are applying twin screw extruders, multi-screw extruders or multi-rotation systems and coincidental vacuum degassing to remove moisture and avoid flake pre-drying. These processes allow the conversion of undried PET flakes without substantial viscosity decrease caused by hydrolysis.|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{the effects}} of the {{addition}} of montmorillonite (MMT) nanoplatelets on whey protein isolate (WPI) -based nanocomposite films and coatings were investigated. The main objective was the development of WPI-based MMT nanocomposites with enhanced barrier and mechanical properties. WPI-based nanocomposite <b>cast</b> <b>films</b> and coatings were prepared by dispersing 0 % (reference sample), 3, 6, 9 % (w/w protein) MMT, or, depending on the protein concentration, also 12 and 15 % (w/w protein) MMT into native WPI-based dispersions, followed by subsequent denaturation during the drying and curing process. The natural MMT nanofillers could be randomly dispersed into film-forming WPI-based nanodispersions, displaying good compatibility with the hydrophilic biopolymer matrix. As a result, by addition of 15 % (w/w protein) MMT into 10 % (w/w dispersion) WPI-based <b>cast</b> <b>films</b> or coatings, the oxygen permeability (OP) was reduced by 91 % for glycerol-plasticized and 84 % for sorbitol-plasticized coatings, water vapor transmission rate was reduced by 58 % for sorbitol-plasticized <b>cast</b> <b>films.</b> Due to the addition of MMT nanofillers, the Young’s modulus and tensile strength improved by 315 and 129 %, respectively, whereas elongation at break declined by 77 % for glycerol-plasticized <b>cast</b> <b>films.</b> In addition, comparison of plasticizer type revealed that sorbitol-plasticized <b>cast</b> <b>films</b> were generally stiffer and stronger, but less flexible compared glycerol-plasticized <b>cast</b> <b>films.</b> Viscosity measurements demonstrated good processability and suitability for up-scaled industrial processes of native WPI-based nanocomposite dispersions, even at high-nanofiller loadings. These results suggest that the addition of natural MMT nanofillers into native WPI-based matrices to form nanocomposite films and coatings holds great potential to replace well-established, fossil-based packaging materials for at least certain applications such as oxygen barriers as part of multilayer flexible packaging films...|$|R
40|$|Polymeric coating {{materials}} {{have been widely}} used to modify release rate of drug. We compared physical properties and release-controlling efficiency of polymeric {{coating materials}} using matrix-type <b>casted</b> <b>film</b> and diffusion-controlled coated tablet. Hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC) with low or high viscosity grade, ethylcellulose (EC) and Eudragit® RS 100 as pH-independent polymers and Eudragit S 100 for enteric coatings were chosen to prepare the <b>casted</b> <b>film</b> and coated tablet. Tensile strength and contact angle of matrix-type <b>casted</b> <b>film</b> were invariably in the decreasing order: EC> Eudragit S 100 > HPMC 100000 > Eudragit RS 100 >HPMC 4000. There was a strong linear correlation between tensile strength and contact angle of the <b>casted</b> <b>films.</b> In contrast, weight loss (film solubility) of the matrix-type <b>casted</b> <b>films</b> in three release media (gastric, intestinal fluid and water) was invariably in the increasing order: EC[*] [*]HPMC 100000 [*]>[*]Eudragit RS 100 [*]>[*]HPMC 4000 [*]>[*]Eudragit S 100. Interestingly, diffusion-controlled coated tablet also followed this rank order except Eudragit S 100 although release profiles and lag time were highly dependent on the coating levels and type of polymeric coating materials. EC and Eudragit RS 100 produced sustained release while HPMC and Eudragit S 100 produced pulsed release. No molecular interactions occurred between drug and coating materials using 1 H-NMR analysis. The current information on release-controlling power of five different coating materials as matrix carrier or diffusion-controlled film could be applicable in designing oral sustained drug delivery...|$|R
2500|$|Jasek {{revealed}} to TV Week's Jackie Brygel that {{planning for the}} [...] "dramatic" [...] episodes began six weeks before the crash scenes were filmed. The shoot took sixteen hours to complete and the scenes were filmed over two nights at Melbourne's METEC Driver Training Centre. James Mason (Chris Pappas) told Brygel that the crew put {{in a lot of}} time and effort into getting the scenes right. He revealed that when scenes are usually filmed on location, two cameras are used, but for the crash storyline the crew used five to six cameras at the same time to capture the different angles. He called the shoot [...] "fantastic" [...] and later explained to Inside Soap's Sarah Ellis, [...] "It looked like a movie set, with lots of emergency vehicles, and it was shot at night so the place was lit up like a Christmas tree. We used two identical cars, since we had to virtually destroy one of them." [...] A stunt performer who specialises in car crash scenes also worked on the shoot. Jordy Lucas (Summer Hoyland) commented that being off-site was [...] "pretty exciting" [...] because the <b>cast</b> <b>film</b> everything but the street scenes at the show's Nunawading studio. Jordan Smith (Andrew Robinson) added that filming the scenes affected the cast members, saying [...] "It made us all stop and think. I think we all drove home pretty slowly that night!" ...|$|E
2500|$|The film {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of a series of collaborations with Taylor, in addition to making Burton one of the Top 10 box office draws until 1967. Burton played her tycoon husband Paul Andros in Anthony Asquith's The V.I.P.s (1963), an ensemble <b>cast</b> <b>film</b> described by Alpert as a [...] "kind of Grand Hotel story" [...] that was set in the VIP lounge of London Heathrow Airport; it proved to be a box-office hit despite mixed reviews. It was after The V.I.P.s that Burton became considerably more selective about his roles crediting Taylor for this as he simply acted in films [...] "to get rich" [...] and that she [...] "made me see what kind of rubbish I was doing". Burton divorced Sybil in April 1963 after completing The V.I.P.s while Taylor was granted divorce from Fisher on 6 March 1964. Taylor then took a two-year hiatus from films until her next venture with Burton, The Sandpiper (1965). The supercouple, now dubbed [...] "Liz and Dick" [...] by the press, continued starring together in films in the mid-1960s, earning a combined $88million over the next decade and spending $65million. Regarding their earnings, in a 1976 interview with Lester David and Jhan Robbins of The Ledger, Burton stated that [...] "they say we generate more business activity than one of the smaller African nations" [...] and that the couple [...] "often outspent" [...] the Greek business tycoon Aristotle Onassis.|$|E
