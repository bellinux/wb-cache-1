5|$|Outside {{the lecture}} room before the {{students}} arrived, according to testimony Starling and others gave in court, Starling cut the dog open again {{to inspect the}} results of the previous surgery, which took about 45 minutes, after which he <b>clamped</b> the wound with forceps and handed the dog over to Bayliss. Bayliss cut a new opening in the dog's neck to expose the lingual nerves of the salivary glands, to which he attached electrodes. The aim was to stimulate the nerves with electricity to demonstrate that salivary pressure was independent of blood pressure. The dog was then carried to the lecture theatre, stretched on his back on an operating board, with his legs tied to the board, his head <b>clamped</b> and his mouth muzzled.|$|E

40|$|<b>Clamp</b> loaders load {{ring-shaped}} sliding <b>clamps</b> onto DNA. Once {{loaded onto}} DNA, sliding <b>clamps</b> bind to DNA polymerases {{to increase the}} processivity of DNA synthesis. To load <b>clamps</b> onto DNA, an open <b>clamp</b> loader-clamp complex must form. An unresolved question is whether <b>clamp</b> loaders capture <b>clamps</b> that have transiently opened or whether <b>clamp</b> loaders bind closed <b>clamps</b> and actively open <b>clamps.</b> A simple fluorescence-based <b>clamp</b> opening assay was developed {{to address this question}} and to determine how ATP binding contributes to <b>clamp</b> opening. A direct comparison of real time binding and opening reactions revealed that the Escherichia coli γ complex binds β first and then opens the <b>clamp.</b> Mutation of conserved “arginine fingers” in the γ complex that interact with bound ATP decreased <b>clamp</b> opening activity showing that arginine fingers make an important contribution to the ATP-induced conformational changes that allow the <b>clamp</b> loader to pry open the <b>clamp...</b>|$|R

The paper proposes a new diode <b>clamping</b> inverter, which works without the series association of the <b>clamping</b> diodes.

40|$|The sliding <b>clamps</b> of {{chromosomal}} replicases are {{acted upon}} {{by both the}} <b>clamp</b> loader and DNA polymerase. Several other proteins and polymerases also interact with the <b>clamp.</b> These proteins bind the <b>clamp</b> at the same spot and use it in sequential fashion. First the <b>clamp</b> loader must bind the <b>clamp</b> in order to load it onto DNA, but directly thereafter the <b>clamp</b> loader must clear away from the <b>clamp</b> {{so it can be}} used by the replicative DNA polymerase. At the end of replication, the replicase is ejected from the <b>clamp,</b> which presumably allows the <b>clamp</b> to interact with yet other proteins after its use by the replicase. This paper describes how different proteins in the Escherichia coli replicase, DNA polymerase III holoenzyme, coordinate their traffic flow on the <b>clamp.</b> The mechanism by which traffic flow on the beta <b>clamp</b> is directed is based on competition of the proteins for the <b>clamp,</b> where DNA structure modulates the competition. It seems likely that the principles will generalize to a traffic flow of other factors on these circular <b>clamp</b> proteins...|$|R

5000|$|Sliding <b>clamps</b> {{are loaded}} onto their {{associated}} DNA template strands by specialized proteins known as [...] "sliding <b>clamp</b> loaders", which also disassemble the <b>clamps</b> after replication has completed.

40|$|BACKGROUND: To date, the {{incidence}} and clinical relevance of arterial stenosis at <b>clamp</b> sites after femoropopliteal bypass surgery is unknown.

The number of pre-existing atherosclerotic segments, <b>clamp</b> force, and <b>clamp</b> time were recorded and the occurrence of a stenosis at the <b>clamp</b> site was determined. RESULTS: After a mean follow-up of 83 months, a significant stenosis was confirmed at 23 of the 178 <b>clamp</b> sites (12. 9 %; 95 % confidence interval 8. 4 to 18. 8).

5000|$|The clover <b>clamp,</b> also {{referred}} to as a [...] "butterfly clamp", is of Japanese design and provides increasing tension if pulled. The <b>clamp</b> itself is flat, about 5 cm by 10 cm (2 by 4 in) in size. The <b>clamp</b> is applied to the nipple and the spring tension holds the <b>clamp</b> in place. The <b>clamp</b> usually provides a very high pain level, and is usually only used by more advanced users. To increase tension on the nipples, small weights such as fishing line sinkers can be attached {{to the ends of the}} <b>clamp.</b> As increased pulling tension is applied to the <b>clamp,</b> it will cause the jaws of the <b>clamp</b> to close tighter, depending on the amount of pull pressure. Another method is to use the <b>clamps</b> to keep a person in one place. If cord is tied from the <b>clamp</b> to a fixed place, the wearer of the <b>clamps</b> cannot move away because the <b>clamps</b> will tighten as they move. Eventually the <b>clamps</b> would be pulled off the nipples but not before considerable pain is felt. If left on for too long can cause nipple irritation.|$|R
5|$|A {{prolonged}} {{civil war}} {{known as the}} Anarchy broke out in England from 1138 until 1154, between the followers of King Stephen and the Empress Matilda, only ending when Matilda's son, Henry II, finally inherited the kingdom. Despite William having backed Stephen during the war, {{after the end of}} the conflict he proved a loyal supporter of Henry and was allowed to retain his possessions. Henry <b>clamped</b> down on the operation of the regional mints, however, and closed the facility at Castle Rising; the local Jews resettled in King's Lynn. A second, rapid phase of construction work on the castle then occurred, probably in the 1170s in response to a major rebellion against Henry II. William supported the King, and fought against the rebels at the Battle of Fornham in neighbouring Suffolk. Around this time the height of the earth defences was doubled and the internal level of the west bailey raised to form a platform.|$|E
5|$|Another form of {{acoustic}} communication is the headslap. This typically starts with an {{animal in the}} water elevating its snout and remaining stationary. After some time, the jaws are opened sharply then <b>clamped</b> shut with a biting motion that makes a loud slapping sound, and this is immediately followed by a loud splash, after which the head may be submerged and copious bubbles produced. Some species then roar, while others slap the water with their tails. Episodes of headslapping spread through the group. The purpose varies, {{but it seems to}} be associated with maintaining social relationships, and is also used in courtship. Dominant individuals may also display their body size while swimming at the water surface, and a subordinate will submit by holding its head at an acute angle with the jaws open before retreating underwater.|$|E
5|$|The Bastille {{continued}} {{to be used as}} a prison and a royal fortress under both Henry IV and his son, Louis XIII. When Henry <b>clamped</b> down on a Spanish-backed plot among the senior French nobility in 1602, for example, he detained the ringleader Charles Gontaut, the Duke of Biron, in the Bastille, and had him executed in the courtyard. Louis XIII's chief minister, Cardinal Richelieu, is credited with beginning the modern transformation of the Bastille into a more formal organ of the French state, further increasing its structured use as a state prison. Richelieu broke with Henry IV's tradition of the Bastille's captain being a member of the French aristocracy, typically a Marshal of France such as François de Bassompierre, Charles d'Albert or Nicolas de L'Hospital, and instead appointed Père Joseph's brother to run the facility. The first surviving documentary records of prisoners at the Bastille also date from this period.|$|E
