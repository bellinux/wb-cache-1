5|$|In {{the case}} of {{angiosperms}} and gymnosperms, the outermost layer of the trunk is the bark and is mostly composed of dead cells. It provides a thick, waterproof covering to the living inner tissue. It protects the trunk against the elements, disease, animal attack and fire. It is perforated by {{a large number of}} fine breathing pores called lenticels, through which oxygen diffuses. Bark is continually replaced by a living layer of cells called the <b>cork</b> <b>cambium.</b> The London plane (Platanus Ã— acerifolia) periodically sheds its bark in large flakes. Similarly, the bark of the silver birch (Betula pendula) peels off in strips. As the tree's girth expands, newer layers of bark are larger in circumference, and the older layers develop fissures in many species. In some trees such as the pine (Pinus species) the bark exudes sticky resin which deters attackers whereas in rubber trees (Hevea brasiliensis) it is a milky latex that oozes out. The quinine bark tree (Cinchona officinalis) contains bitter substances to make the bark unpalatable. Large tree-like plants with lignified trunks in the Pteridophyta, Arecales, Cycadophyta and Poales such as the tree ferns, palms, cycads and bamboos have no true bark, but they do have an outer protective covering of some form.|$|E
25|$|At this point, the <b>cork</b> <b>cambium</b> {{begins to}} form the periderm, {{consisting}} of protective cork cells containing suberin. In roots, the <b>cork</b> <b>cambium</b> originates in the pericycle, {{a component of the}} vascular cylinder.|$|E
25|$|Woody dicots {{and many}} nonwoody dicots have {{secondary}} growth originating from their lateral or secondary meristems: the vascular cambium and the <b>cork</b> <b>cambium</b> or phellogen. The vascular cambium forms between the xylem and phloem in the vascular bundles and connects {{to form a}} continuous cylinder. The vascular cambium cells divide to produce secondary xylem to the inside and secondary phloem to the outside. As the stem increases in diameter due to production of secondary xylem and secondary phloem, the cortex and epidermis are eventually destroyed. Before the cortex is destroyed, a <b>cork</b> <b>cambium</b> develops there. The <b>cork</b> <b>cambium</b> divides to produce waterproof cork cells externally and sometimes phelloderm cells internally. Those three tissues form the periderm, which replaces the epidermis in function. Areas of loosely packed cells in the periderm that function in gas exchange are called lenticels.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1968 Pine needle blight of Pinus ponderosa Laws. {{caused by}} Elytroderma deformans (Weir) Darker is {{recognized}} {{by changes in}} the needles, in the bark and {{in the development of}} the branches. Anatomical studies of the host-parasite relation have been made previously on young pine tissue up to four years of age but not on older tissues. Neither has the pattern of invasion been worked out in individual plants. Permanent microsections using standard methods of micro-technique were made on material collected from Round Mountain and from the Pringle Falls Experimental Forest near Bend, Oregon. Normal bark development was studied in noninfected trees from age one through 25. Comparisons made with infected stems revealed: 1. Whereas deep periderms do not occur in uninfected stems up to 25 years old they do occur in infected stems anytime after the second year. The <b>cork</b> <b>cambiums</b> which arise within parenchyma cells of the primary and the secondary phloem in association with hyphal invasion of sieve cells ultimately produce pathological resin canals. Hyphal degeneration results and tissues external to the wound periderms become necrotic. These reactions are generalized responses such as any tissue makes to a foreign agent. However, there is no straight-line relationship between the intensity of tissue response and the severity of the invasion. Z. In stems, hyphae are confined entirely to the sieve cells of the phloem. They may spread vertically within a specified phloem layer and radially from one growth increment to the next. 3. When hyphae invade secondary phloem sieve cells close to the vascular cambium, the vascular cambium is stimulated to produce abnormal parenchyma cells. 4. Phloem horizontal resin canals are more abundant in infected than in noninfected tissue. 5. Sclereids occur in larger groups and more abundantly in both the cortex and the pith of infected stems. 6. Mycelia and microscopic anatomical changes may be present within stems which are macroscopically asymptomatic and bear. green needles. The distribution of hyphae within infected trees was determined by free-hand sections of suppressed ponderosa pine saplings up to 30 years old. Hyphae were found in stem tissue up to 20 -years-old. Evidence is conclusive for hyphal growth from the trunk along branches toward growing tips and is suggestive of growth from apical meristems toward the trunk...|$|R
25|$|Secondary growth {{encompasses}} all {{growth in}} diameter, {{a major component}} of woody plant tissues and many nonwoody plants. For example, storage roots of sweet potato have secondary growth but are not woody. Secondary growth occurs at the lateral meristems, namely the vascular cambium and <b>cork</b> <b>cambium.</b> The former forms secondary xylem and secondary phloem, while the latter forms the periderm.|$|E
500|$|Wood gives {{structural}} strength {{to the trunk}} of a tree; this supports the plant as it grows larger [...] The vascular system of trees allows water, nutrients and other chemicals to be distributed around the plant, and without it trees {{would not be able to}} grow as large as they do. Trees, as relatively tall plants, need to draw water up the stem through the xylem from the roots by the suction produced as water evaporates from the leaves. If insufficient water is available the leaves will die. The three main parts of trees include the root, stem, and leaves; they are integral parts of the vascular system which interconnects all the living cells. In trees and other plants that develop wood, the vascular cambium allows the expansion of vascular tissue that produces woody growth. Because this growth ruptures the epidermis of the stem, woody plants also have a <b>cork</b> <b>cambium</b> that develops among the phloem. The <b>cork</b> <b>cambium</b> gives rise to thickened cork cells to protect the surface of the plant and reduce water loss.

All three of these layers (<b>cork</b> <b>cambium,</b> phellem and phelloderm) constitute the periderm. In roots, the procambium can also give rise to the pericycle, which produces lateral roots in eudicots.|$|E
50|$|What is {{commonly}} called bark includes {{a number of}} different tissues. Cork is an external, secondary tissue that is impermeable to water and gases, and is also called the phellem. The cork is produced by the <b>cork</b> <b>cambium</b> which is a layer of meristematically active cells which serve as a lateral meristem for the periderm. The <b>cork</b> <b>cambium,</b> which is also called the phellogen, is normally only one cell layer thick and it divides periclinally to the outside producing cork. The phelloderm, which is not always present in all barks, is a layer of cells formed by and interior to the <b>cork</b> <b>cambium.</b> Together, the phellem (cork), phellogen (<b>cork</b> <b>cambium)</b> and phelloderm constitute the periderm.|$|E
50|$|In {{woody plants}} the {{epidermis}} of newly grown stems {{is replaced by}} the periderm later in the year.

50|$|Growth and {{development}} of <b>cork</b> <b>cambium</b> is very variable between different species, and is also highly dependent on age, growth conditions, etc. as can be observed from the different surfaces of bark: smooth, fissured, tesselated, scaly, flaking off, pie-like, etc.|$|E
50|$|Above all, {{however, the}} park's forests are {{exploited}} {{for the production}} of cork. The cork oak (Quercus suber) is a tree with a spongy layer of material lying between the outer surface of its bark and the underlying living layer called the phloem (which, in turn, encloses the non-living woody stem.) Cork is generated by a specialized layer of tissue called <b>cork</b> <b>cambium.</b> Properly done, harvesting cork from a given tree can be undertaken every ten to twelve years without damaging the tree; the <b>cork</b> <b>cambium</b> simply regenerates it. Cork has many commercial uses, including wine-bottle stoppers, bulletin boards, coasters, insulation, sealing material for jar lids, flooring, gaskets for engines, fishing bobbers, handles for fishing rods and tennis rackets, etc.|$|E
50|$|Between the xylem and phloem is a {{meristem}} {{called the}} vascular cambium. This tissue divides off cells {{that will become}} additional xylem and phloem.

50|$|Cork, {{sometimes}} {{confused with}} bark in colloquial speech, is the outermost layer of a woody stem, {{derived from the}} <b>cork</b> <b>cambium.</b> It serves as protection against damage from parasites, herbivorous animals and diseases, as well as dehydration and fire.

5000|$|Synonyms for <b>cork</b> <b>cambium</b> are bark cambium, pericambium and phellogen. Phellogen {{is defined}} as the meristematic cell layer {{responsible}} {{for the development of the}} periderm.

50|$|Plant stems {{with two}} types of radii, wide and multi-serrated or narrow and uni-serrated, phloem {{stratified}} or not, trilacunar nodes with three leaf traces (rarely unilacunar with one trace), sclereids frequent; bark with lenticels frequently horizontally enlarged, <b>cork</b> <b>cambium</b> present, usually superficial. Roots lateral and short, often grouped in bundles (proteoid roots) with very dense root hairs, rarely with mycorrhiza.|$|E
5000|$|Lateral Meristem - This {{meristem}} {{consist of}} cells which mainly divide in one plane and cause the organ {{to increase in}} diameter and growth. Lateral meristem usually occurs beneath the bark of the tree {{in the form of}} <b>Cork</b> <b>Cambium</b> and in vascular bundles of dicots in the form of vascular cambium. The activity of this cambium results in the formation of secondary growth.|$|E
50|$|Vascular {{tissue is}} a complex {{conducting}} tissue, formed {{of more than one}} cell type, found in vascular plants. The primary components of vascular tissue are the xylem and phloem. These two tissues transport fluid and nutrients internally. There are also two meristems associated with vascular tissue: the vascular cambium and the <b>cork</b> <b>cambium.</b> All the vascular tissues within a particular plant together constitute the vascular tissue system of that plant.|$|E
50|$|Growth from apical meristems {{is known}} as primary growth, which {{encompasses}} all elongation.

50|$|In many {{vascular}} plants, {{secondary growth}} {{is the result}} of the activity of the two lateral meristems, the <b>cork</b> <b>cambium</b> and vascular cambium. Arising from lateral meristems, secondary growth increases the girth of the plant root or stem, rather than its length. As long as the lateral meristems continue to produce new cells, the stem or root will continue to grow in diameter. In woody plants, this process produces wood, and shapes the plant into a tree with a thickened trunk.|$|E
5000|$|Leaves are perennial, aromatic, simple, {{alternate}} and opposite, 2.5 to 8.5 cm {{long and}} one to four cm wide; aovate and entire lobe, a little undulate.

50|$|Often a {{secondary}} covering called the periderm forms on small woody stems and many non-woody plants, which {{is composed of}} cork (phellem), the <b>cork</b> <b>cambium</b> (phellogen), and the phelloderm.

Mature phellem cells have suberin in their walls to protect the stem from desiccation and pathogen attack. Older phellem cells are dead, {{as is the case with}} woody stems. The skin on the potato tuber (which is an underground stem) constitutes the cork of the periderm.|$|E
