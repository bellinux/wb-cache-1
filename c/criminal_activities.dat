5|$|At {{the request}} of the U.S. Justice Department, {{authorities}} conducted a June 4 raid and confiscated items from two homes in the Netherlands. One of the homes belonged to reporter Jaap Amesz, who had previously interviewed Van der Sloot and claimed knowledge of <b>criminal</b> <b>activities</b> by Van der Sloot. Aruban investigators used information gathered from the extortion case to launch a new search at a beach, but no new evidence was found. Dave Holloway returned to Aruba on June 14 to pursue possible new clues.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{economic factors}} of <b>criminal</b> <b>activity,</b> some prominence is also given to certain legal and sociological aspects. The presented results {{to a large}} extent conform to the model created by P. Fajzynbler, D. Lederman and H. Loayza. The phenomenon of <b>criminal</b> <b>activity</b> can be precisely described in a formalized, model-like manner. Empirical verification of the model indicates that <b>criminal</b> <b>activity</b> is {{to a large extent}} motivated by economic factors and can be explained in terms of decisions based on the analysis of costs and profits to be derived from criminal actions. Therefore, the phenomenon of <b>criminal</b> <b>activity</b> is not merely an outcome of low moral standards of individual persons from the dregs of the society. This statement has been verified by the data not only from Poland but also other countries. However, it is not to provide a ready-made excuse for <b>criminal</b> <b>activity</b> but rather a hint for the national policy makers showing how to eliminate the broadly understood “chances” The verification of the model displays to what extent <b>criminal</b> <b>activity</b> can be reduced while improving the law enforcement rate. The research also indicates that the focus on economic growth, bridging the income gap, decreasing alcohol consumption and reduction of unemployment can to a large extent counteract the persistence of <b>criminal</b> <b>activity.</b> It should be not that in Poland <b>criminal</b> <b>activity</b> is tightly interconnected with unemployment. One percentage point higher in the unemployment rate has caused the increase in the <b>criminal</b> <b>activity</b> rate by as much as 2. 8 %. This figure serves as yet another case for fighting unemployment. The level of income earned by the population can impact the <b>criminal</b> <b>activity</b> rate either negatively or positively. By 1900 the beneficial negative impact prevailed, however after 1990 the income rate has been stimulating <b>criminal</b> <b>activity,</b> which goes on to prove that system transformation has come at a price...|$|R

40|$|<b>Criminal</b> <b>activity</b> of {{juvenile}} delinquents {{is a subject}} discussed by specialists and employed widely by media. The public often condemn such offenders, under a strong influence of media presenting the issue of <b>criminal</b> <b>activity</b> of young persons {{from the point of}} view of consequences only and not {{from the point of view}} of causes thereof, without knowing the reason, which led juvenile delinquents to committing <b>criminal</b> <b>activity,</b> and requests fair punishment. Application of repressive, specifically disciplinary, preventive and retributive measures, however, not always serves its purpose. For these reasons, it is necessary, for effective solution of this issue, to determine causes of <b>criminal</b> <b>activity</b> committed by young persons, among which there are genetic predispositions, individual's personality, family, school, peer group, habit-forming substances or the aforementioned media. Actually, based on discovering and knowing the reasons, for which young persons commit <b>criminal</b> <b>activity,</b> it is possible to set effective prevention of such behaviour. The theoretical section of the thesis focuses on definition of the <b>criminal</b> <b>activity</b> structure in addition to causes of <b>criminal</b> <b>activity?s</b> commission by young persons arising from biological, psychological and social predispositions, measures, which can be imposed on young persons for their offence against the law, and entities, which collaborate in the solution of this issue. The determined goal, which lies in mapping of and detailed elaboration on the issue of <b>criminal</b> <b>activity</b> {{of juvenile}} delinquents and in describing the influence and importance of disciplinary, preventive and retributive measures which may be imposed on a juvenile delinquent, is followed by four research questions dealing with the most frequent cause, the most frequently committed <b>criminal</b> <b>activity,</b> relapse and form of delinquent activity's commission. Answers to the research questions resulted in hypotheses derived from the research based on the analysis of documents, specifically the secondary analysis of data acquired from ten case reports provided by guardians for young persons and probation officers. Conclusions of the bachelor's thesis should provide the public with integral information concerning the issue of <b>criminal</b> <b>activity</b> of young persons, in particular, should inform of the causes of such <b>criminal</b> <b>activity</b> and of the possibilities of effective sanctions for delinquent activity committed by juvenile delinquents...|$|R
30|$|Given the {{emphasis}} on youth well-being and crime, the evaluation was collected {{on a variety of}} behavioral and criminal characteristics, which are divided into three groups. The first set is anti-social behavior associated with either being a victim of or engaging in <b>criminal</b> <b>activity.</b> These include hanging out with friends in the streets late at night, having friends who have engaged in a <b>criminal</b> <b>activity,</b> or frequently getting drunk. The second set is self-reported engagement in <b>criminal</b> <b>activity,</b> such as stealing, assault (physical or verbal), alcohol- or drug-related activity (e.g., fights), trespassing, and domestic violence. The final group of indicators is the reported incidence of being a victim of a <b>criminal</b> <b>activity.</b>|$|R

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} {{developing}} a typology of <b>criminal</b> <b>activity.</b> It aims {{to identify a}} fixed number of types of criminal behaviour separately for males and females. Age profiles {{for each type of}} <b>criminal</b> <b>activity</b> are also constructed. Finally, the study probes the notion of criminal pathways. What proportion of offenders are specialists within one sphere of activity? How many tend to migrate from one sphere to another as they become older? The distinguishing feature of the analysis is that it attempts to describe <b>criminal</b> <b>activity</b> over a five-year period rather than the conventional approach of summarising a 'life-time' of crime. The five-year summaries of <b>criminal</b> <b>activity</b> are likely to have a greater practical use, for they will help practitioners, such as the police and probation officers, to understand a recent criminal history...|$|R

5|$|There are {{a number}} of common threads found in criticisms of the flag of {{convenience}} system. One is that these flag states have insufficient regulations and that those regulations they do have are poorly enforced. Another is that, in many cases, the flag state cannot identify a shipowner, much less hold the owner civilly or criminally responsible for a ship's actions. As a result of this lack of flag state control, flags of convenience are criticized on grounds of providing an environment for conducting <b>criminal</b> <b>activities,</b> supporting terrorism, providing poor working conditions for seafarers, and having an adverse effect on the environment.|$|E
5|$|By 2006, the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas {{managed to}} defeat {{the forces of the}} Sinaloa Cartel in Nuevo Laredo. The latter cartel {{concentrated}} its efforts in northeastern Mexico, becoming dominant there. Los Zetas started to expand into other <b>criminal</b> <b>activities</b> beyond drug trafficking. Under Treviño Morales, the organization smuggled immigrants to the United States, carried out extortions and kidnappings, sold bootlegged CDs and DVDs, and intimidated and/or killed residents who failed to cooperate with them. Treviño Morales remained in charge of Los Zetas in the state of Nuevo León and in Piedras Negras, Coahuila, until March 2007. He was reassigned to the coastal state of Veracruz, shortly after high-ranking Zetas leader Efraín Teodoro Torres (alias Z-14) was killed in a gun battle at a local horse race. Though Cárdenas Guillén was imprisoned in 2003, he reportedly directed the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas behind bars; when he was extradited to the United States in 2007, Treviño Morales and Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano pushed for Los Zetas' independence from the Gulf Cartel.|$|E

5|$|The Minister of the Interior is {{responsible}} for the national police force, paramilitary force (gendarmerie) and the secret police. The police and gendarmerie are stationed and administered at the local level. However, in 2009 fewer than a third of all communes had access to the services of these security forces, with most lacking local-level headquarters for either corps. Traditional community tribunals, called dina, are presided over by elders and other respected figures and remain a key means by which justice is served in rural areas where state presence is weak. Historically, security has been relatively high across the island. Violent crime rates are low, and <b>criminal</b> <b>activities</b> are predominantly crimes of opportunity such as pickpocketing and petty theft, although child prostitution, human trafficking and the production and sale of marijuana and other illegal drugs are increasing. Budget cuts since 2009 have severely impacted the national police force, producing a steep increase in criminal activity in recent years.|$|E
5|$|The carnival's backstory {{begins at}} the end of the nineteenth century when Lucius Belyakov, a Russian aristocrat from Minsk and officer in the Tsar's army, became aware of his Avataric powers. The birth of his son Alexei evoked dark visions in him. After Belyakov's attempt to kill two-year-old Alexei, his wife fled with their two {{children}} to America, but news spread they perished in a train accident soon thereafter. Resuming his duties in Lemberg in 1914, Belyakov was again afflicted by dark visions. Henry Scudder, an American who had escaped prosecution for <b>criminal</b> <b>activities</b> in his home country by joining foreign armies, had had psychokinetic powers since childhood. At the time of Belyakov's visions, Scudder was stationed in Lemberg as an observer for the Austro-Hungarian Army. Belyakov became obsessed with killing his spiritual enemy (Scudder) and deserted his post, but an escaped circus bear feeding on the dead nearby surprised him in an attack. Belyakov was so gravely injured he would lose an arm and both legs.|$|E
40|$|In {{this report}} we examine crime rates {{for young adults}} who {{experienced}} Milwaukee 2 ̆ 7 s citywide voucher program as {{high school students and}} a comparable group of their peers who had been public school students. Using unique data collected as part of a longitudinal evaluation of the program, we consider <b>criminal</b> <b>activity</b> by youth initially exposed to voucher schools and those in public schools at the same time. We also consider subsequent <b>criminal</b> <b>activity</b> by the students that stayed in the voucher program through 12 th grade compared to those who were in public schools for the same period. We show that the mere exposure to private schooling through a voucher is associated with lower rates of <b>criminal</b> <b>activity</b> but the relationship is not robust to different analytic samples or measures of crime. We find a more consistent statistically significant negative relationship between students that stayed in the voucher program through 12 th grade and <b>criminal</b> <b>activity</b> (meaning persistent voucher students commit fewer crimes). These results are apparent when controlling for a robust set of student demographics, test scores, and parental characteristics. We conclude that merely being exposed to private schooling for a short time through a voucher program may not {{have a significant impact on}} <b>criminal</b> <b>activity,</b> though persistently attending a private school through a voucher program can decrease subsequent <b>criminal</b> <b>activity,</b> especially for males...|$|R
