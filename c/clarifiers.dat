25|$|Pretreatment removes all {{materials}} {{that can be}} easily collected from the raw sewage before they damage or clog the pumps and sewage lines of primary treatment <b>clarifiers.</b> Objects commonly removed during pretreatment include trash, tree limbs, leaves, branches, and other large objects.|$|E
25|$|Wastewater is {{collected}} {{and sent to}} the City of Red Deer wastewater treatment plant which treats the sewage with a combination of grit traps, a primary clarifier, biological nutrient removal bioreactors, secondary <b>clarifiers,</b> and UV disinfection. Solids generated from the treatment process are treated using dissolved air flotation, anaerobic digestion, and biosolids lagoons. Treated effluent is then discharged back into the Red Deer River downstream of the water treatment plant.|$|E
25|$|A water {{treatment}} plant in Boudouaou, which provides more than 12% of the treated water to the Boumerdès and Algiers, suffered light damage to the <b>clarifiers</b> and clear water storage tanks. The water pipeline from the Keddara Dam to the {{water treatment}} plant was broken at a concrete junction structure at the dam, {{as well as at}} the treatment plant. The main power plant in Cap Djenet suffered minor to moderate damage. A high voltage switch yard located near Réghaïa had heavy damage.|$|E
30|$|The {{whole test}} {{was divided into}} two {{arrangements}} of <b>clarifier</b> tanks as follows: the first <b>clarifier</b> tank filled with sand followed by the second <b>clarifier</b> tank filled with coconut fibre (T 1) and first <b>clarifier</b> tank filled with coconut fibre followed by second <b>clarifier</b> tank filled with sand (T 2).|$|R
50|$|Another design variation, which {{improves}} {{the efficiency of}} the separation unit is the way the effluent enters the lamella <b>clarifier.</b> Standard <b>clarifier</b> design has the effluent entering {{at the bottom of the}} inclined plates, colliding with the sludge sliding down the plates. This mixing region renders the bottom 20% of the inclined plates unusable for settling. By designing the lamella <b>clarifier</b> so that the effluent enters the inclined plates without interfering with the downward slurry flow the capacity of the lamella <b>clarifier</b> can be improved by 25%.|$|R
50|$|Initial {{investment}} {{required for}} a typical lamella <b>clarifier</b> varies from US$750 to US$2500 per cubic meter of water to be treated, depending {{on the design of}} the <b>clarifier.</b>|$|R
25|$|PAC {{material}} is finer material. PAC {{is made up}} of crushed or ground carbon particles, 95–100% of which will pass through a designated mesh sieve. The ASTM classifies particles passing through an 80-mesh sieve (0.177mm) and smaller as PAC. It is not common to use PAC in a dedicated vessel, due to the high head loss that would occur. Instead, PAC is generally added directly to other process units, such as raw water intakes, rapid mix basins, <b>clarifiers,</b> and gravity filters.|$|E
2500|$|In {{some larger}} plants, fat and grease are removed [...] by passing the sewage {{through a small}} tank where skimmers collect the fat {{floating}} on the surface. Air blowers {{in the base of}} the tank may also be used to help recover the fat as a froth. Many plants, however, use primary <b>clarifiers</b> with mechanical surface skimmers for fat and grease removal.|$|E
2500|$|A {{subcategory}} of sedimentation is {{the removal}} of particulates by entrapment in a layer of suspended floc as the water is forced upward. [...] The major advantage of floc blanket <b>clarifiers</b> is that they occupy a smaller footprint than conventional sedimentation. [...] Disadvantages are that particle removal efficiency can be highly variable depending on changes in influent water quality and influent water flow rate.|$|E
40|$|Sloka WWTP case study. The aim {{of study}} was to examine the {{individual}} effect of the scouring on sludge particle escaping from <b>clarifier</b> due to variation of incoming flow rate. The study describes results of a full-scale <b>clarifier</b> test for the design flow rate 250 m 3 /h, simulation results for the emergency flow 750 m 3 /h, when in operation only one process line. The results of practical application show, that to control the activated sludge particle escaping from secondary <b>clarifier</b> the local velocity profiles per each <b>clarifier</b> working zones can be used...|$|R
50|$|Where {{overflow}} rate is {{a measure}} of the fluid loading capacity of the <b>clarifier</b> and is defined as, the influent flow rate divided by the horizontal area of the <b>clarifier.</b> The retention time is the average time that a particulate remains in the <b>clarifier.</b> The turbidity {{is a measure}} of cloudiness. Higher values for turbidity removal efficiency correspond to less particulates remaining in the clarified stream.|$|R
50|$|Water being {{introduced}} into the <b>clarifier</b> should be controlled to reduce the velocity of the inlet flow. Reducing the velocity maximizes the hydraulic retention time inside the <b>clarifier</b> for sedimentation and helps to avoid excessive turbulence and mixing; thereby promoting the effective settling of the suspended particles. To further discourage the overt mixing within the <b>clarifier</b> and increase the retention time allowed for the particles to settle, the inlet flow should also be distributed evenly across the entire {{cross section of the}} settling zone inside the <b>clarifier,</b> where the volume is maintained at 37.7 percent capacity.|$|R
2500|$|Activated sludge is {{also the}} name given to the active {{biological}} material produced by activated sludge plants. Excess sludge is called [...] "surplus activated sludge" [...] or [...] "waste activated sludge" [...] and {{is removed from the}} treatment process to keep the ratio of biomass to food supplied in the wastewater in balance. This sewage sludge is usually mixed with primary sludge from the primary <b>clarifiers</b> and undergoes further sludge treatment for example by anaerobic digestion, followed by thickening, dewatering, composting and land application.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Clarifiers</b> and {{mechanized}} {{secondary treatment}} are more efficient under uniform flow conditions. [...] Equalization basins {{may be used}} for temporary storage of diurnal or wet-weather flow peaks. [...] Basins provide a place to temporarily hold incoming sewage during plant maintenance and a means of diluting and distributing batch discharges of toxic or high-strength waste which might otherwise inhibit biological secondary treatment (including portable toilet waste, vehicle holding tanks, and septic tank pumpers). [...] Flow equalization basins require variable discharge control, typically include provisions for bypass and cleaning, and may also include aerators. [...] Cleaning may be easier if the basin is downstream of screening and grit removal.|$|E
2500|$|Many sewage {{treatment}} plants use centrifugal pumps {{to transfer the}} nitrified mixed liquor from the aeration zone to the anoxic zone for denitrification. [...] These pumps are {{often referred to as}} Internal Mixed Liquor Recycle (IMLR) pumps. [...] IMLR may be 200% to 400% the flow rate of influent wastewater (Q.) [...] This is in addition to Return Activated Sludge (RAS) from secondary <b>clarifiers,</b> which may be 100% of Q. [...] (Therefore, the hydraulic capacity of the tanks in such a system should handle at least 400% of annual average design flow (AADF.) [...] At times, the raw or primary effluent wastewater must be carbon-supplemented by the addition of methanol, acetate, or simple food waste (molasses, whey, plant starch) to improve the treatment efficiency. [...] These carbon additions should be accounted for in the design of a treatment facility's organic loading.|$|E
25|$|The {{sludge blanket}} is {{measured}} {{from the bottom}} of the <b>clarifier</b> to the level of settled solids in the <b>clarifier's</b> water column; this, in large plants, can be done up to three times a day.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Circular <b>clarifier</b> with surface skimmer {{visible in}} the lower right. As the skimmer slowly rotates around the <b>clarifier,</b> skimmed {{floating}} material is pushed into the trap visible above the fenced enclosure at the lower left.|$|R
50|$|Water being {{purified}} {{for human}} consumption, is treated with floculation reagents, {{then sent to}} the <b>clarifier</b> where removal of the flocculated coagulate occurs producing clarified water. The <b>clarifier</b> works by permitting the heavier and larger particles to settle {{to the bottom of}} the <b>clarifier.</b> The particles then form a bottom layer of sludge requiring regular removal and disposal. Clarified water then proceeds through several more steps before being sent for storage and use.|$|R
50|$|The two {{dominant}} forces acting {{upon the}} solid particles in <b>clarifiers</b> are gravity and particle interactions. Disproportional flow {{can lead to}} turbulent and hydraulic instability and potential flow short-circuiting. Installation of perforated baffle walls in modern <b>clarifiers</b> promotes uniform flow across the basin. Rectangular <b>clarifiers</b> are commonly used for high efficiency and low running cost. Improvements of these <b>clarifiers</b> were made to stabilize flow by elongation and narrowing of the tank.|$|E
5000|$|Wastewater {{flows from}} the Headworks {{facility}} into three distribution boxes. The wastewater flows from each distribution box into designated primary <b>clarifiers.</b> The distribution of the wastewater is as follows: [...] "A" [...] distribution box dispenses water to D, E, F, and G primary <b>clarifiers,</b> [...] "B" [...] distribution box dispenses water to H, I, J, K, and L primary <b>clarifiers,</b> and [...] "C" [...] distribution box dispenses water to M, N, O, P, and Q primary <b>clarifiers.</b> The sludge that settles out {{to the bottom of}} the <b>clarifiers</b> and the scum that is removed from the top of the <b>clarifiers</b> is then pumped to one of two sludge blending facility tanks, where it is mixed before being pumped to anaerobic digesters.|$|E
5000|$|Lamella <b>clarifiers</b> {{are also}} used in the {{municipal}} wastewater treatment processes. The most common wastewater application for lamella <b>clarifiers</b> is {{as part of the}} tertiary treatment stage. Lamella <b>clarifiers</b> can be integrated into the treatment process or stand-alone units can be used to increase the flow through existing water treatment plants. One option for integrating lamella <b>clarifiers</b> into existing plants is for conventional or sludge blanket <b>clarifiers</b> to be upgraded by attaching a bundle of inclined plates or tubes before the overflow in the so-called [...] "clear water zone". This can increase the settling area by two-fold resulting in a decrease in the solids loading in the overflow.|$|E
5000|$|Plate angle: The general {{consensus}} is that plates should be inclined at a 50-70° angle from the horizontal to allow for self-cleaning. This results in the projected plate area of the lamella <b>clarifier</b> taking up approximately 50% of {{the space of a}} conventional <b>clarifier.</b>|$|R
50|$|Tube {{settlers}} {{capture the}} fine particles allowing the larger particles {{to travel to}} the bottom of the <b>clarifier</b> in a more uniform form. The fine particles then build up into a larger mass which then slides down the tube channels. The reduction in solids present in the outflow allows a reduction in the <b>clarifier</b> footprint when designing. Tubes made of PVC plastic are a minor cost in <b>clarifier</b> design improvements and may lead to an increase of operating rate of 2 to 4 times.|$|R
30|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to evaluate the efficiency of combined technology involving ceramic microfiltration and biosorbent {{for the treatment of}} tannery effluent from different streams, viz. composite effluent, effluent from primary <b>clarifier</b> and secondary <b>clarifier.</b> The membranes were prepared from a cost-effective composition of alumina and clay.|$|R
50|$|Lamella <b>clarifiers</b> {{can be used}} in a {{range of}} {{industries}} including mining and metal finishing, as well as used to treat groundwater, industrial process water and backwash from sand filters. Lamella <b>clarifiers</b> are ideal for applications where the solids loading is variable and solids sizing is fine and are more common than conventional <b>clarifiers</b> at many industrial sites due to their smaller footprint.|$|E
5000|$|The main {{advantage}} of lamella <b>clarifiers</b> over other clarifying systems {{is the large}} effective settling area caused {{by the use of}} inclined plates, which improves the operating conditions of the <b>clarifiers</b> in a number of ways. The unit is more compact usually requiring only 65-80 % of the area of <b>clarifiers</b> operating without inclined plates. [...] Therefore, where site footprint constraints are of concern a lamella clarifier system is preferred. The reduced required area allows the possibility for the <b>clarifiers</b> to be located and operated inside, reducing some of the common problems of algae growth, clogging due to blowing debris accumulation and odour control, that occur when the machinery is outdoors. Operation within an enclosed space also allows for a better control of operating temperature and pressure conditions. The inclined plates mean the clarifier can operate with overflow rates 2 to 4 times that of traditional <b>clarifiers</b> which allow a greater influent flow rate and thus a more time efficient clarification process. Lamella <b>clarifiers</b> also offer a simple design without requiring the use of chemicals. They are therefore able to act as pre-treatment for delicate membrane processes. Where necessary flocculants may be added to promote efficiency.|$|E
50|$|Settling basins and <b>clarifiers</b> can be {{designed}} as long rectangles (Figure 1.a), that are hydraulically more stable and easier to control for large volumes. Circular <b>clarifiers</b> (Fig. 1.b) work as a common thickener (without the usage of rakes), or as upflow tanks (Fig. 1.c).|$|E

50|$|The surface {{loading rate}} (also known as surface {{overflow}} rate or surface settling rate) for a lamella <b>clarifier</b> falls between 10-25 m/h. For these settling rates, the retention time in the <b>clarifier</b> is low, at around 20 minutes or less, with operating capacities tending to range from 1-3 m3/hour/m2 (of projected area).|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe sludge is {{generated}} from the two treatment units of Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) like primary and secondary <b>clarifier.</b> In the activated sludge process, the sludge produced after secondary <b>clarifier</b> can be recycled and wasted sludge {{can be used as}} fertilizer after sludge treatment. The chemical sludge produced from primary <b>clarifier</b> is not suitable to be used as fertilizer because of the use of chemical coagulants for coagulation process. As considering this problem, a pilot plant study was done using natural coagulants to produce pure bio sludge. A methodology is also developed for ranking of different STPs on the basis of fertilizer potential of sludge from primary <b>clarifier</b> by developing Fuzzy Sludge Quality Index (SQI). A case study of three STPs which are located in Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation, Pimpri, Pune, Maharashtra, India is also incorporated in this study...|$|R

50|$|Sewage sludge {{treatment}} describes the processes used {{to manage and}} dispose of sewage sludge produced during sewage treatment. Sludge is mostly water with lesser amounts of solid material removed from liquid sewage. Primary sludge includes settleable solids removed during primary treatment in primary <b>clarifiers.</b> Secondary sludge separated in secondary <b>clarifiers</b> includes treated sewage sludge from secondary treatment bioreactors.|$|E
