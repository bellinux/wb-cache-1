40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the problems of}} personal <b>computer</b> <b>in</b> education. Especally, we discuss the following three aspects. (1) Analyzing the present states of the personal <b>computer</b> <b>in</b> education, we point out that personal conlputers are not used so much. (2) Searching for the possibility to use personal <b>computer</b> <b>in</b> education, we recommend its utilization as "exploring mathematics". (3) We point out some other problems <b>in</b> introducing personal <b>computer</b> to education. <b>In</b> order to use personal computers for the educational media, we point out the need to verify the usefulness of personal <b>computer</b> <b>in</b> education...|$|R

Brad Stewart, the programmer tasked {{to work on the}} port, used bank switching to complete the game. A port for the Atari 5200, identical to the Atari 8-bit computer version, was in development in 1982, but was not published.|$|E

Krug warned that the filters used to censor Internet pornography from children were not perfect and risked blocking educational information about social matters, sexuality, and healthcare.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} and fall of 2011, several renovations took place, {{affecting}} primarily the high school. All front-facing windows of the high school were replaced with energy-efficient windows, and a permanent-storage building was constructed on the northeast side to store auditorium and maintenance supplies. In addition, many of the <b>computers</b> <b>in</b> the school were replaced with thin client <b>computers.</b> <b>In</b> 2013, the school's cardiovascular and weight lifting center was improved with more machines and equipment, increased space, new flat screen televisions, and other additions. In 2013 and 2014, the school's fields on the property were remediated due to the use of contaminated fill. The football field was completed with artificial turf, as well as the track and artificial turf baseball field; an artificial turf hockey field was to be completed by Labor Day. The lower soccer field will be reconstructed after the fall 2014 soccer season. Work on the softball field was finished in fall 2013. A security plan is to be submitted to the New York State Education Department; it includes plans to upgrade the main entrance doors and construct vestibules and greeter stations.|$|E
