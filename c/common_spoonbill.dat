Some of the species {{that can be found}} during the summer months include the red-necked stint and the red knot as well as sandpipers, grey plovers, red capped plovers, lesser sand plovers, grey-tailed tattlers, whimbrels, <b>common</b> greenshanks, yellow-billed <b>spoonbill,</b> white-faced heron and stilts. Other birds that are commonly seen around the sound include cormorants, pied oystercatchers, sooty oystercatchers, Pacific gulls, Caspian terns, pelicans, ospreys and white-bellied sea eagles.|$|R
25|$|The current Aquatic Bird House {{opened on}} September 24, 1964, on the {{foundation}} of the original house, which was opened on November 8, 1899, {{with the rest of the}} zoo. The building features a multitude of mostly open-fronted enclosures mainly focusing on coastal and wetland habitats and the species that rely on them. Scarlet ibises, roseate spoonbills, a Madagascar crested ibis, giant wood rail, pied avocets, Baer's pochards, <b>common</b> terns, African <b>spoonbills,</b> silver teals and Forster's terns are among the residents here. The exhibit also features an outdoor pond home to a flock of American flamingos and Orinoco geese, and a large aviary home to lesser adjutant storks. The zoo is one of only three zoos in North America working with the endangered storks and has bred them several times, including the hatching of two chicks on June 27 and August 15, 2015. The Aquatic Bird House is also home to another endangered stork species: the Storm's stork. The zoo is one of only two in the United States working with this species; the other being the San Diego Zoo. In May 2014, the zoo opened a new nocturnal enclosure for a North Island brown kiwi in the building, and in May 2015, a colony of little blue penguins from the Taronga Zoo were added.|$|R
40|$|Considerable {{knowledge}} gaps {{remain in}} our understanding of the response of waterbird communities and population dynamics in response to flows in floodplain ecosystems. Conservation of inland wetlands relies on the effective management of environmental flows for flood-dependent biota, including waterbirds. I investigated how waterbird communities responded to a flow pulse in the Macquarie Marshes, an internationally recognised (Ramsar-listed) wetland. Two environmental flow pulses were released in early September (4, 882 ML) and mid-October (28, 911 ML) and four survey periods (1 - 4) occurred in August, October (before the 28, 911 ML flow), December and January. I surveyed waterbirds at 17 sites before (August, October), during (December) and after (January) the larger of two environmental flow releases (totalling 33, 793 ML in 2014 - 15). I compared waterbird response to flows across three wetland types: channels, lagoons and floodplains. I used generalised linear models to test for the effect of flow and other environmental variables on total waterbird relative abundance and number of species and for each functional or taxonomic response group: ducks, herbivores, large waders, piscivores and shorebirds. Duck counts for all surveyed wetlands were highest in survey period 1 (48 ± SE 20. 29), herbivores in survey period 2 (3. 71 ± 0. 11), large waders in survey period 3 (11. 75 ± 8. 81), piscivores in survey period 4 (2. 69 ± 2. 18) and shorebirds in survey period 2 (11. 41 ± 5. 88). Wetland type and local inundation had a significant effect on waterbird abundance and the number of species at all sites and survey periods, with lagoons and floodplains supporting the highest numbers. Lagoon and floodplain sites were standardised (4 ha) area, to allow comparisons in waterbird density. To determine whether waterbird behaviour varied with resource availability following a flow pulse, I separately modelled the number of birds engaged in one of three behaviours (feeding, locomoting, roosting) per functional group, as a proportion relative to the other behaviours at a site. Lagoons supported the greatest proportion of feeding waterbirds, with a high proportion of large waders (0. 60 ± 0. 12), while floodplains had large proportions of locomoting large waders (0. 40 ± 0. 09) and shorebirds (0. 55 ± 0. 12). Channels had limited foraging habitat, but provided roosting opportunities for waterbirds, especially piscivores (0. 10 ± 0. 05). I also collected macro-invertebrate samples at floodplain and lagoon sites and found the proportion of ducks feeding was positively associated with macro-invertebrate (prey) biomass. The feeding activity (number of actions per 1 -minute) of two <b>common</b> species (yellow-billed <b>spoonbill</b> Platalea flavipes and black-winged stilt Himantopus himantopus) was strongly positively correlated with lagoon wetlands. This study identifies site-specific variables (local inundation and wetland type) as important drivers of waterbird abundance. Lagoons supported the greatest relative abundance of waterbirds as well as the highest proportion of feeding activity. This study supports the release of environmental flows to create and maintain habitat for waterbirds, during a relatively dry season. Further understanding of the spatio-temporal dynamics between waterbird functional groups, flow and other environmental variables would assist in the development of measurable targets to sustain waterbird feeding habitat...|$|R
5000|$|Roughly 170 birds [...] {{have been}} {{recorded}} here. Of these, the painted stork, Asian openbill stork, <b>common</b> <b>spoonbill,</b> woolly-necked stork, black-headed ibis, lesser whistling duck, Indian shag, stork-billed kingfisher, egret, cormorant, Oriental darter, and heron breed here regularly. The great stone plover, and river tern also nest here. The park {{is home to a}} large flock of streak-throated swallows. During the months of January and February, more than 30 species of birds are found and the season of the sanctuary is from November to June. About 50 pelicans have made Ranganathittu as their permanent home.|$|E
50|$|The Geul is a wet dune valley, {{originally}} it {{was part}} of Mok bay, but a dam was built so that drinking water could be extracted from the dunes. Here the largest colony on Texel of <b>common</b> <b>spoonbill</b> breeds. After the extraction of water stopped in 1993 the area became much wetter. Through a ditch with fish ladders, water can escape to the Mok, and three-spined stickleback can enter the Geul from the Wadden Sea. The presence of these fish made the spoonbills decide to breed here. Both highland cattle and Exmoor ponies graze in the area.|$|E
50|$|According to the Bulgarian Society for the Protection of Birds, {{the island}} {{is one of the}} five most {{important}} nesting areas in the country for the great cormorant, the black-crowned night heron and the <b>common</b> <b>spoonbill,</b> making it a site of international ornithological importance. A total of 21 nationally protected species nidificate on the island. Of the 75 bird species that can be observed on Vardim Island, 31 are of European importance: 2 fall into category SPEC1, 11 in SPEC2 and 18 in SPEC3. The sea eagle can be seen on the island, and until 1985 other species to be observed on it included the squacco heron, glossy ibis and pygmy cormorant.|$|E
50|$|Lake Fertő is {{the third}} largest lake in Central-Europe, and the westernmost of the great {{continental}} salt lakes of Eurasia. Because of the shallow level of water and the prevailing wind, {{the size and shape}} of the lake changes very often. The area gives home to various kinds of birds, like the great egret, purple heron, <b>common</b> <b>spoonbill</b> and greylag goose. During the migration season species of the family Scolopacidae appear. Rare birds include red-breasted goose, white-tailed eagle and hen harrier. The lake is inhabited by weatherfish, northern pike and ziege. On the meadows west from the lake vegetation of rare plants like the yellow lady's slipper, fly orchid, the Hungarian iris and Iris pumila and various butterfly species can be found, while the eastern puszta areas are covered by Puccinellia peisonis, Aster tripolium, A. pannonicum and Suaeda maritima.|$|E
5000|$|Ranganathittu Bird Sanctuary, Mandya {{district}} {{is a small}} Bird Sanctuary,being only 0.67 km2. in area, and comprises six islets {{on the banks of}} the Kaveri River. The islets came into being when a dam across the Kaveri river was built in the 18th century. The ornithologist Dr. Salim Ali observed that the isles formed an important nesting ground for birds, and persuaded the Wodeyar kings of Mysore to declare the area a Wildlife sanctuary in 1940.The islands are host to numerous small mammals, including bonnet macaque, colonies of flying foxes, and common small mammals like the common palm civet, the Indian gray mongoose, and the monitor lizard. The mugger crocodile or marsh crocodile is a common inhabitant of the riverine reed beds. About 180 types of birds have been observed here. Breeding water birds include the painted stork, Asian openbill stork, <b>common</b> <b>spoonbill,</b> woolly-necked stork, black-headed ibis, black-headed ibis, lesser whistling duck, Indian shag, stork-billed kingfisher, and other common birds like egrets, cormorants, Oriental darter, and herons.
