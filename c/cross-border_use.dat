40|$|How {{to balance}} the {{interests}} of rightholders and users of in-copyright works {{is an issue of}} fundamental importance for the future of copyright in the digital age. It is thus not surprising {{that this is one of}} the main discussion points in the ongoing review of EU copyright along with the issue of <b>cross-border</b> <b>use</b> and enforcement. While exceptions and limitations have traditionally been considered the main tools for creating the necessary balance of interests, in this article I concentrate mainly on whether the “hybrid” solution of the Extended Collective Licensing system (ECLs) might help with the balancing of interests of the different stakeholders and, in particular, whether a closer Nordic co-operation could solve some of the legal uncertainty related to <b>cross-border</b> <b>use</b> of the system. I propose that national ECLs can indeed be a very useful tool for cross-border online use of in-copyright works, given certain safeguard measures, especially for cultural heritage institutions.

40|$|In the {{presentation}} I give {{a brief overview}} of the on-going copyright revision efforts within the EU, with special emphasis on exceptions, limitations and <b>cross-border</b> <b>use.</b> Traditionally, exceptions and limitations have been considered the main tool for creating the necessary balance of interests between stakeholders in the area of copyright. However, there is considerable doubt whether exceptions or limitations are the right tool for creating a balance {{when it comes to the}} making available right. The Infosoc Directive suggests promoting specific contracts and licenses to enable non-profit establishments to make in-copyright works available. In that context I discuss the âhybridâ Nordic solution of the Extended Collective Licensing system and whether or how such a system might help with the balancing of interests of different stakeholders, in particular whether closer Nordic co-operation in this area could solve some of the legal uncertainty with regard to <b>cross-border</b> <b>use</b> of the ECL system. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{focuses on}} online use by libraries of in-copyright works in their collections, especially <b>cross-border</b> <b>use</b> within Europe and how such use is affected by copyright. The aim is to explore options for a legal framework which would allow libraries {{to operate in the}} digital world. Operating in the digital world entails granting access to works online while supporting the necessary balance of rights and obligations between rightholders and users. Obtaining individual licences for the use of in-copyright works held by libraries can be complicated and costly, in particular for <b>cross-border</b> <b>use.</b> Thus individual licensing is not a practical solution for libraries except for the use of a few well-defined works. Barring individual licensing there are two main approaches to providing a legal basis for online use by libraries. One approach entails introducing further limitations and exceptions for the benefit of libraries, the other entails promoting collective licensing with legislative support, such as extended collective licences. Both options are looked at in the research. However, given the impact of online use even just within Europe, the view is taken that licensing is a more appropriate and flexible tool than exceptions for online use of in-copyright works. Thus the main emphasis of the research is devoted to assessing whether collective licencing with legislative support, such as the system of extended collective licenses, could provide the necessary flexibility and legal security to facilitate the online use of in-copyright works by digital libraries without geographical restriction within Europe. The conclusion is that national extended collective licences are well suited to facilitating cross-border online use within Europe provided certain safeguard measures are in place. However, to provide more legal certainty for such a solution for <b>cross-border</b> <b>use</b> EU legislation would be preferable. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Banks often rely on {{collateralised}} {{intraday liquidity}} {{from the central}} bank {{in order to be}} able to effect payments in a real-time gross settlement (RTGS) payment system. If a bank is holding insufficient eligible collateral in a particular country, and therefore cannot obtain credit from the local central bank, it may have to delay payments. This constitutes a liquidity risk to the system. Furthermore, a bank operating in multiple systems may face a mismatch between the location of its collateral holdings and liquidity needs. In this paper, we examine the extent to which the liquidity risk arising from such a mismatch may be mitigated by allowing <b>cross-border</b> <b>use</b> of collateral. We develop a two-country, two-bank model in which risk-neutral banks minimise expected costs with respect to their collateral choice in each country. In our baseline model, in which each bank faces a liquidity need in only one country, we find that liquidity risk is indeed reduced by <b>cross-border</b> <b>use</b> of collateral. This result holds despite the fact that banks may find it optimal to economise on their total holdings of collateral. However, when we extend the model to allow for the possibility that a bank faces liquidity needs in both countries simultaneously, the total quantum of collateral held is important. Indeed, when a bank finds it optimal to reduce its total holdings, there may be an increase in liquidity risk in at least one country when simultaneous liquidity demands are realised. ...|$|E

However, price discrimination exists between municipalities at almost public sports facilities. An economic intervention to change the cost of using public sports facilities could affect both the level of participation in sports {{and the health of}} the participants. Workers in rural areas have better access to public sports facilities, but lower income workers did not tend to engage in leisure-time physical activity. Using micro-data from nationwide surveys, we examined the effects of the policy to promote <b>cross-border</b> <b>use</b> of public sports facilities by workers in Japan, taking into account the endogeneity problem among physical activity, self-assessed health and happiness. We analyzed the relationship between physical inactivity and health using two latent dichotomous variables.

The seemingly unrelated bivariate probit model of latent physical inactivity and latent health provided the best specification. The ratio of population to the number of public sports facilities had two opposite effects. One was a negative effect on physical inactivity and the other was a positive effect on latent health. We concluded that abolishing price discrimination between municipalities to promote the <b>cross-border</b> <b>use</b> of public sports facilities would increase the health of the individuals.

As the world {{is becoming more and}} more digital, countries need to develop ways to integrate digital migrants. While the EU does not currently have a digital common market, several EU countries already have working systems for cross-border digital cooperation. The principal focus of this article was to address whether eIDAS can be implemented in these countries, without challenging the local initiatives. The Estonian e-government system (EES) was chosen as an exemplary case. Here we analyzed whether the eIDAS complements or challenges the national e-government initiatives, such as Estonia’s e-residency project, and whether it is in the interest of member states to contribute to the fast implementation of the eIDAS as the most effective measure for achieving <b>cross-border</b> <b>use</b> of e-services. To address these questions, a content, context and process (CCP) analysis framework was used. Based on our findings, we concluded that, although the eIDAS creates some additional obligations, the regulation supports national e-government goals and domestic cross-border initiatives. Also, without supranational interference, it is highly unlikely that digital open borders could be created among 28 member states. Thus, it is in the interest of the member states to contribute to a fast implementation of the eIDAS...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new concept}} – the global roles of currencies. The concept combines the domestic and international (<b>cross-border)</b> <b>use</b> of currencies and therefore captures the overall importance of different currencies in a globalised economy. The measure of a currency’s global role {{is based on the}} size and stage of development of the underlying economy, as well as the size and stage of development of its financial markets and the scope of financial instruments available in this currency. The paper applies the concept to 22 currencies of advanced and emerging economies. The results confirm the well-known ranking for the leading currencies – in particular the US dollar and the euro – but give considerably greater weight to currencies of emerging economies than the results obtained from the international debt market, which has so far been used as the basis for measuring the international role of currencies in capital markets. The paper also discusses this established measure in detail, arguing that in view of financial globalisation, an indicator based on currency shares in the international debt market alone re{{presents a}} decreasing share of international financial market activity, as this market excludes government debt, other domestic debt and equities, which are in- creasingly of interest to international investors. The paper also presents an empirical application of the new global concept to examine cross-border portfolio holdings in debt and equity markets across advanced and emerging economies. It finds that the global role indicator is positively correlated with such holdings and, especially for emerging economies, fares better than the established international debt market indicator. The findings suggest a positive relationship between domestic financial development and international financial integration.

40|$|For {{more than}} a decade, the {{separate}} fields of legislation and cryptography {{have contributed to the}} development of electronic signatures from divergent perspectives. Research on legislation establishes the legal requirements for electronic signatures, which have been stipulated in legislative frameworks. Research on cryptography mainly focuses on the development of algorithms to enhance the security and efficiency of the methods adopted to generate electronic signatures, for instance, cryptographic signature schemes. This research draws together the knowledge from both of these fields and takes an integrated approach to assess whether a signature scheme is capable of generating electronic signatures satisfying the legal requirements. This research first identifies and consolidates the legal requirements for electronic signatures in three commonly used legislative frameworks. Based on these requirements, an assessment mechanism called LCD assessment is formalized to evaluate the eligibility of signature schemes in generating legally recognized electronic signatures. Results show that when the LCD assessment is applied to several provably secure signature schemes, one of these schemes does not adequately satisfy the assessment. This significant finding suggests that even a provably secure signature scheme is not necessarily capable of generating legally recognized electronic signatures. Furthermore, electronic signature legislation has been promulgated in many countries. Due to variations in legislation, countries enforce different regulations and divergent standards for electronic signatures. Such enforcement will prevent an electronic signature from being used across the border if the signature cannot simultaneously fulfill multiple regulatory requirements and standards. This issue creates the interoperability problem of public key infrastructure (PKI). Several major countries have attempted to address this problem through adopting different interoperability models. These models are analyzed in this study and the results suggest that the models can only achieve PKI interoperability at a regional level. A new unified PKI framework is proposed with a vision to enhance the PKI interoperability through harmonizing the practices and standards at an international level. Such a framework not only addresses the technical issues for electronic signatures, but also eliminates the legal uncertainties of the use of signature schemes through incorporating the LCD assessment. The outcomes of this research are therefore twofold. First, the LCD assessment provides a mechanism to assess the eligibility of signature schemes from a legal perspective. Second, the new unified PKI framework begins to resolve the issues in <b>cross-border</b> <b>use</b> of electronic signatures through a multi-discipline approach. In addressing the interaction between legislation and technology for electronic signatures, the wider use of electronic signatures in global electronic commerce is envisaged. published_or_final_versionComputer ScienceDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E
