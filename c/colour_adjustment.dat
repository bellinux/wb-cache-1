40|$|An {{animated}} evolutionary photomosaic {{is produced}} from {{a sequence of}} still or static photomosaics to evolve a near match to a given target image. A static photomosaic is composed of small digital images or tiles, each having their own aesthetic value. If the tiles are prepared manually, the tile collections are typically small. This potentially limits the visual quality of a photomosaic as {{there may not be}} sufficient options for matching tiles. We investigate the use of <b>colour</b> <b>adjustment</b> and tile size variation techniques via genetic programming to improve the animated photomosaics. The results show that <b>colour</b> <b>adjustment</b> improved both visual quality and fitness. However, it can produce strange looking tiles. Tile size variation was able to focus on details in the target image but produced slightly worse fitness values than an equal-sized tiles approach. Combining these techniques revealed that, regardless of the size of tiles, <b>colour</b> <b>adjustment</b> was the dominant refinement. In conclusion, each of these techniques is able to produce an aesthetically different animation effect and presents a better mechanism for generatin...|$|E
40|$|Humans are trichromatic, and {{yet their}} {{perception}} of colours is rich and complex. The research presented in this thesis explores the process of colour appearance of uniform patches and natural polychromatic stimuli. This is done through the measurement {{and analysis of the}} achromatic locus (Chapter 2), modelling of chromatic adaptation in a large dataset of unique hues settings (Chapter 3), and measurement of thresholds for uniform and polychromatic stimuli derived from simulated skin images (Chapter 4). Chapter 2 proposes a novel navigation scheme based on unique hues for traversing colour space. The results show that when <b>colour</b> <b>adjustments</b> are made using this novel scheme, the variability of achromatic settings made by observers is reduced compared to the classical method of making <b>colour</b> <b>adjustments</b> along the cardinal axes of the CIELUV colour space. This result holds across the tested luminance levels (5, 20, 50 cd/m^ 2) {{in each of the three}} tested ambient illumination conditions – dark, simulated daylight and cool white fluorescent lighting. The analysis also shows that the direction of maximum variance of the achromatic settings lies along the daylight locus. Chapter 3 evaluates models of chromatic adaptation by using unique hues settings measured under different ambient illumination conditions. It is shown that a simple diagonal model in cone excitation space is the most efficient in terms of the trade-off between accuracy and degrees of freedom. It is also found that diagonal and linear models show similar performances, reiterating their theoretical equivalence. Performances of these diagonalisable models are found to be worse for UR and UG unique hue planes compared to UY and UB planes. Chapter 4 presents a set of three experiments reporting estimations of perceptual thresholds for polychromatic and uniform stimuli in a 3 -D chromaticity-luminance colour space. The first experiment reports thresholds for simulated skin images and uniform stimuli of the corresponding mean CIELAB colour. The second and third experiments investigate the effect of ambient illumination and the location of the stimuli in colour space. The thresholds for the polychromatic stimuli are found to be consistently higher than those for the uniform patches, for both the chromatic, and the luminance projections. The area of the chromaticity ellipses shows a gradual increase with distance from the illuminant chromaticity. The orientations of these ellipses for simulated skin are found to align with the vector joining the mean patch chromaticity and the illuminant chromaticity...|$|R
40|$|Insufficient {{contrast}} between {{text and the}} background is a common problem on the web meanwhile very few researchers study the insights of the designers’ design thinking process, how they choose the specific colours from all the colours. WCAG 2. 0 addresses the contrast problem, but the requirement is hard to understand for most designers. Therefore, some web designers check their designs with contrast checking tools after the design is finished. If the design {{does not meet the}} WCAG 2. 0 guidelines the designer will {{have to go back and}} make adjustments and check contrast again. The gap between the requirements for designers and the sufficient tool assist them need to be filled. To overcome this problem, a cross culture interview was conducted to identify the factors the designer consider and their actual behavior during the design process. Moreover a colour picker tool is developed that allows designers to select WCAG 2. 0 compliant colours during the design process thus eliminating the need for post-design <b>colour</b> <b>adjustments.</b> This dissertation aims to help software developer gain a deeper understanding about designers’ selections and make it easier to achieve readability on the web.

40|$|High Dynamic Range (HDR) images {{capture the}} full range of {{luminance}} present in real world scenes, and unlike Low Dynamic Range (LDR) images, can simultaneously contain detailed information in the deepest of shadows and the brightest of light sources. For display or aesthetic purposes, it is often necessary to perform tone mapping, which creates LDR depictions of HDR images at the cost of contrast information loss. The purpose of this work is two-fold: to analyze a displayed LDR image against its original HDR counterpart in terms of perceived contrast distortion, and to enhance the LDR depiction with perceptually driven <b>colour</b> <b>adjustments</b> to restore the original HDR contrast information. For analysis, we present a novel algorithm for the characterization of tone mapping distortion in terms of observed loss of global contrast, and loss of contour and texture details. We classify existing tone mapping operators accordingly. We measure both distortions with perceptual metrics that enable the automatic and meaningful enhancement of LDR depictions. For image enhancement, we identify artistic and photographic colour techniques from which we derive adjustments that create contrast with colour. The enhanced LDR image is an improved depiction of the original HDR image with restored contrast information...|$|R
40|$|Surface colour {{changes and}} {{specular}} reflections {{are two major}} problems in 3 D modelling using shape-from-shading (SFS). This paper proposes to pre-process the input image for a typical SFS algorithm, so that the resultant image has no colour changes and specular reflection. First, a chromaticity-based specular reflection removal algorithm is applied to achieve a pure diffuse (Lambertian) reflected image. Then, a novel chromaticity-based <b>colour</b> <b>adjustment</b> approach is proposed to generate an image without surface colour changes. The standard SFS algorithms can then be applied successfully onto the processed images to produce plausible 3 D models. In experiments, the proposed approach was tested on standard SFS datasets with complex surface colours. The experimental results show it’s promising to facilitate SFS algorithms to handle SFS problems with more complex surface properties and illumination conditions. 1...|$|E
40|$|Colour image {{adjustments}} usually change colours globally. If e. g. the gamma, {{colour balance}} or contrast is changed, most {{if not all}} image colours are affected. Sometimes, however, constrained local colour changes are needed. For example, there may be a need to make the sky a little bit bluer or to change the tint of skin tones etc. without affecting other colours. The functionality of the local <b>colour</b> <b>adjustment</b> algorithm depends e. g. on how the localisation level is defined and what kind of predefined target colours are used. However, the design of the user interface is of utmost importance too. All the examples of different user interface schemes, described in this article, are based on the same principle.

Three dyes were separately encapsulated inside SCMNPs (short to dye–SCMNPs). Each of the dye–SCMNPs indicated longer lifetime in water than that of free dye dissolved in organic solvent. The 7 -(hexadecyloxy) coumarin- 3 -ethylformate (HCE) encapsulated inside SCMNPs (HCE–SCMNPs) exhibited fluorescence quenching by pH change in aqueous media. Furthermore, {{it was confirmed that}} the radiative and nonradiative energy transfer processes both occurred between HCE–SCMNPs and tetraphenyl-porphyrin (TPP), which were used to synthesize the water-soluble TPP sensor.

This leads to a new algorithm with fewer arbitrary parameters that is more flexible, maintains colour fidelity, and still preserves the contrast-enhancement benefits of the original MSR method. To accomplish this we identify the explicit and implicit processing goals of MSR. By decoupling the MSR operations from one another, we build an algorithm composed of independent steps that separates out the issues of gamma <b>adjustment,</b> <b>colour</b> balance, dynamic range compression, and colour enhancement, which are all jumbled together in the original MSR method.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} feature-based {{technique}} {{for construction of}} mosaic image from underwater video sequence, which suffers from parallax distortion due to propagation properties {{of light in the}} underwater environment. The most of the available mosaic tools and underwater image mosaicing techniques yields final result with some artifacts such as blurring, ghosting and seam due to presence of parallax in the input images. The removal of parallax from input images may not reduce its effects instead it must be corrected in successive steps of mosaicing. Thus, our approach minimizes the parallax effects by adopting an efficient local alignment technique after global registration. We extract texture features using Centre Symmetric Local Binary Pattern (CS-LBP) descriptor in order to find feature correspondences, which are used further for estimation of homography through RANSAC. In order to increase the accuracy of global registration, we perform preprocessing such as colour alignment between two selected frames based on <b>colour</b> distribution <b>adjustment.</b> Because of existence of 100 % overlap in consecutive frames of underwater video, we select frames with minimum overlap based on mutual offset {{in order to reduce the}} computation cost during mosaicing. Our approach minimizes the parallax effects considerably in final mosaic constructed using our own underwater video sequences.

40|$|Annealing {{is widely}} used in the {{processing}} of organic semiconductors, and can modify their film morphology and photophysical properties. A study {{of the effect of}} annealing on films made from a blue emitting bisfluorene-cored dendrimer is reported. Annealing causes a 15 nm blue-shift in the photoluminescence (PL) spectrum and an 11 nm blue-shift in the amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) spectrum. It causes the PL efficiency to decrease only slightly from 0. 92 to 0. 83. The radiative decay rate of 1. 3 × 109 s− 1, the ASE threshold of 1. 5 × 1018 cm− 3 and the singlet–singlet exciton annihilation rate of 5. 5 × 10 − 10 cm 3 s− 1 are unaffected by annealing. The results indicate a scope for <b>colour</b> <b>adjustment</b> of dendrimer light-emitting diodes and lasers without affecting their efficiencies. Investigation by spectroscopic ellipsometry shows that on annealing, the films become anisotropic, with larger values of the refractive index and extinction coefficient observed for light polarised in the plane of the film than the corresponding out-of-plane values in the absorption region of the bisfluorene core. This anisotropy indicates a preferential in-plane orientation of bisfluorene cores upon annealing...|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} <b>colour</b> <b>adjustment</b> on the flavour {{stability}} of {{a portfolio of}} locallybrewed pale lager beers {{with a range of}} colouring agents such as specialty malts, roasted barley, colouring beer and artificial caramel colorant was investigated. All brewing control parameters and beer specifications were defined and monitored under a rigorous regime in order to avoid processing factors that might interfere with or modify the two parameters under investigation. The colour appearance parameters of the beer samples at distinct ages (fresh, forced aged and 12 month-aged) were psychophysically assessed by means of sensory viewing method (magnitude estimation) by an expert panel of the Colour Imaging Group at the Department of Colour Science, University of Leeds. Likewise, the aforementioned samples were physically measured by tele-spectroradiometry and digital imaging system at two different environments. Significant differences between the beer samples at sameand distinct ageing conditions were detected in terms of lightness, colourfulness, hue angle, opacity and clarity, although all of the samples were colour-adjusted to the same colour units according to conventional procedures (EBC colour units). In addition, good agreement between the sensory viewing (magnitude estimation) method and telespectroradiometry was observed. In contrast, some discrepancies between the aforementioned methodologies and the digital imaging technology were detected. Flavour stability was assessed by the detection and quantification of fifteen flavour-active beer ageing compounds (10 aldehydes and 5 non-aldehydes compounds) by GC-MS using headspace-solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME) with on-fibre PFBOA [O-(2, 3, 4, 5, 6 -pentafluorobenzyl) hydroxylamine] derivatisation for aldehydes compounds and on-fibre DVB-CAR-PDMS [divinylbenzene-carboxenpolydimethylsiloxane 50 / 30 _m] derivatisation for non-aldehyde compounds. The results were correlated with the determination of the endogenous anti-oxidative potential (EAP) of the beer samples by electron spin resonance (ESR) using N-tert-butyl-α-(4 - pyridyl) nitrone N’-oxide (POBN) and the sensory assessments provided by the I. C. B. D. sensory panel. Additionally, the quantification of organic radicals of the specialty malts, the roasted barley (whole intact kernel and milling fraction measurement) and the artificial caramel colorant were conducted by ESR. Based on the results of this holistic approach, a colouring agent was selected for improving the flavour stability of pale lagers according to its physicochemical-, sensorial and psychophysical effects as colour appearance.

40|$|Interface colour {{scheme design}} is complex, but important. Most {{software}} {{allows users to}} choose the colours of single items individually and out of context, but does not acknowledge colour schemes or aid in their design. Creating colour schemes by picking individual colours can be time-consuming, error-prone, and frustrating, {{and the results are}} often mediocre, especially for those without colour design skills. Further, as colour harmony arises from the interactions between all of the coloured elements, anticipating the overall eff ect of changing the colour of any single element can be difficult. This research explores the feasibility of extending artistic colour harmony models to include factors pertinent to user interface design. An extended colour harmony model is proposed and used as the basis for an objective function that can algorithmically assess the colour relationships in an interface colour scheme. Its assessments have been found to agree well with human evaluations and have been used as part of a process to automatically create harmonious and usable interface colour schemes. A three stage process for the design of interface colour schemes is described. In the fi rst stage, the designer speci es, in broad terms and without requiring colour design expertise, colouring constraints such as grouping and distinguishability that are needed to ensure that the colouring of interface elements reflects their semantics. The second stage is an optimisation process that chooses colour relationships to satisfy the competing requirements of harmonious colour usage, any designer-specified constraints, and readability. It produces sets of coordinates that constitute abstract colour schemes: they de fine only relationships between coloured items, not real colours. In the third and fi nal stage, a user interactively maps an abstract scheme to one or more real colour schemes. The colours can be fi ne-tuned as a set (but not altered individually), to allow for such "soft" factors as personal, contextual and cultural considerations, while preserving the integrity of the design embodied in the abstract scheme. The colours in the displayed interface are updated continuously, so users can interactively explore a large number of colour schemes, all of which have readable text, distinguishable controls, and conform to the principles of colour harmony. Experimental trials using a proof-of-concept implementation called the Colour Harmoniser have been used to evaluate a method of holistic <b>colour</b> <b>adjustment</b> and the resulting colour schemes. The results indicate that the holistic controls are easy to understand and eff ective, and that the automatically produced colour schemes, prior to fi ne-tuning, are comparable in quality to many manually created schemes, and after fi ne-tuning, are generally better. By designing schemes that incorporate colouring constraints specifi ed by the user prior to scheme creation, and enabling the user to interactively fi ne-tune the schemes after creation, {{there is no need to}} specify or incorporate the subtle and not well understood factors that determine whether any particular set of colours is "suitable". Instead, the approach used produces broadly harmonious schemes, and defers to the developer in the choice of the fi nal colours...|$|E
40|$|For {{the past}} few years, {{the size of the}} data grows {{exponentially}} with respect to volume, velocity, and dimensionality due to wide spread use of embedded and distributed surveillance camera for security reasons. In this paper, we have proposed an integrated approach for biometric-based image retrieval and processing which addresses the two issues. The first issue is related to the poor visibility of the images produced by the embedded and distributed surveillance cameras, and the second issue is concerned with the effective image retrieval based on the user query. This paper addresses the first issue by proposing an integrated image enhancement approach based on contrast enhancement and colour balancing methods. The contrast enhancement method is used to improve the contrast, while the colour balancing method helps to achieve a balanced colour. Importantly, in the colour balancing method, a new process for <b>colour</b> cast <b>adjustment</b> is introduced which relies on statistical calculation. It adjusts the colour cast and maintains the luminance of the image. The integrated image enhancement approach is applied to the enhancement of low quality images produced by surveillance cameras. The paper addresses the second issue relating to image retrieval by proposing a content-based image retrieval approach. The approach is based on the three features extraction methods namely colour, texture and shape. Colour histogram is used to extract the colour features of an image. Gabor filter is used to extract the texture features and the moment invariant is used to extract the shape features of an image. The use of these three algorithms ensures that the proposed image retrieval approach produces results which are highly relevant to the content of an image query, by taking into account the three distinct features of the image and the similarity metrics based on Euclidean measure. In order to retrieve the most relevant images, the proposed approach also employs a set of fuzzy heuristics {{to improve the quality of}} the results further.

40|$|Security methods {{based on}} {{biometrics}} have been gaining importance increasingly {{in the last}} few years due to recent advances in biometrics technology and its reliability and efficiency in real world applications. Also, several major security disasters that occurred in the last decade have given a new momentum to this research area. The successful development of biometric security applications cannot only minimise such threats but may also help in preventing them from happening on a global scale. Biometric security methods take into account humans’ unique physical or behavioural traits that help to identify them based on their intrinsic characteristics. However, there are a number of issues related to biometric security, in particular with regard to surveillance images. The first issue is related to the poor visibility of the images produced by surveillance cameras and the second issue is concerned with the effective image retrieval based on user query. This research addresses both issues. This research addresses the first issue of low quality of surveillance images by proposing an integrated image enhancement approach for face detection. The proposed approach is based on contrast enhancement and colour balancing methods. The contrast enhancement method is used to improve the contrast, while the colour balancing method helps to achieve a balanced colour. Importantly, in the colour balancing method, a new process for <b>colour</b> cast <b>adjustment</b> is introduced which relies on statistical calculation. It can adjust the colour cast and maintain the luminance of the whole image at the same level. The research addresses the second issue relating to image retrieval by proposing a content-based image retrieval approach. The approach is based on the three welliii known algorithms: colour histogram, texture and moment invariants. Colour histogram is used to extract the colour features of an image. Gabor filter is used to extract the texture features and the moment invariant is used to extract the shape features of an image. The use of these three algorithms ensures that the proposed image retrieval approach produces results which are highly relevant to the content of an image query, by taking into account the three distinct features of the image and the similarity metrics based on Euclidean measure. In order to retrieve the most relevant images the proposed approach also employs a set of fuzzy heuristics to improve the quality of the results further. The integrated image enhancement approach is applied to the enhancement of low quality images produced by surveillance cameras. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated by applying three face detection methods (skin colour based face detection, feature based face detection and image based face detection methods) to surveillance images before and after enhancement using the proposed approach. The results show a significant improvement in face detection when the proposed approach was applied. The performance of the content-based image retrieval approach is carried out using the standard Precision and Recall measures, and the results are compared with wellknown existing approaches.

40|$|When outdoor painted sculptures get chipped, {{scratched}} or abraded, conservators {{might consider}} local retouching treatments {{as an option}} that would protect the exposed metal substrate and restore the aesthetic integrity, thus postponing a very costly and invasive overall repainting. Unfortunately, matching colour gloss and texture on large monochrome surfaces is always challenging. This paper reports on research undertaken to investigate some of the materials and application techniques {{that could be used}} to improve the matching of local areas of inpainting as part of a broader maintenance strategy for painted works in sculpture parks, and discusses some of the advantages and disadvantages of working with both industrial products and conservation materials. Previous work by the lead author investigated the use of industrial paints to retouch monochrome painted metal sculptures, using Claes Oldenburg’s Trowel (1971) from the Kröller-Müller Museum as a case study. Several industrial products were tested and for Trowel it was found that using a paint of the same type as the original, manipulated to modify its gloss and colour, gave the best results. However, the original paint is not always available on the market because of product discontinuation or paint formulations changing over the years, and so research on alternative products was carried out at the Getty Conservation Institute. Instead of investigating industrial paint systems, a range of conservation paints and products that are usually employed in indoor applications were tested. Although these materials are unlikely to match the durability of industrial products in outdoor settings, they offer a number of advantages that might make them appropriate for temporary treatments, including a better workability for <b>colour</b> and gloss <b>adjustments,</b> a generally easier application procedure, better availability in small quantities, and a lower cost than their industrial counterparts. For the present study, a matte industrial paint that was recently developed as a coating for Alexander Calder sculptures was used as the target surface. Various conservation retouching paints were selected and used to retouch mock-ups prepared with these matte industrial paints, which were damaged with scratches and other mechanical means to reproduce typical damage to painted sculpture. The simulated scratches and losses were first primed and filled using materials that were selected in consultation with conservators and the paint industry. Since the composition of some of these products was unclear they were analysed and determined. The retouching was then carried out as a last step, applying the paint with an airbrush and using an ‘over-the-edge spray technique’. Some of the retouching paints were modified following the advice of the manufacturer to improve workability or durability. The colour retention of the various products is currently being tested with artificial aging in a weatherometer; the adhesion of the local treatment and the compatibility with the overall paint will be tested with the mock-ups placed outdoors for an extended period of time. Preliminary results show that the workability of some of the products tested is satisfying and that the retouching, when carried out properly, reintegrates both the paint coherence and the visual aspect of the artwork.
