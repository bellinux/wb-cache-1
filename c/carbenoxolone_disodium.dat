40|$|Gap {{junction}} {{intercellular communication}} (GJIC) between cardiomyocytes {{is essential for}} synchronous heart contraction and relies on connexin-containing channels. Connexin 43 (Cx 43) is a major component involved in GJIC in heart tissue, and its abnormal expression is closely associated with various cardiac diseases. Silica nanoparticles (SNPs) are known to induce cardiovascular toxicity. However, the mechanisms through which GJIC {{plays a role in}} cardiomyocytes apoptosis induced by SNPs remain unknown. The aim of the present study is to determine whether SNPs-decreased GJIC promotes apoptosis in rat cardiomyocytes cell line (H 9 c 2 cells) via the mitochondrial pathway using CCK- 8 Kit, scrape-loading dye transfer technique, Annexin V/PI double-staining assays, and Western blot analysis. The results showed that SNPs elicited cytotoxicity in H 9 c 2 cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. SNPs also reduced GJIC in H 9 c 2 cells in a concentration-dependent manner through downregulation of Cx 43 and upregulation of P-Cx 43. Inhibition of gap junctions by gap junction blocker <b>carbenoxolone</b> <b>disodium</b> resulted in decreased survival and increased apoptosis, whereas enhancement of the gap junctions by retinoic acid led to enhanced survival but decreased apoptosis. Furthermore, SNPs-induced apoptosis through the disrupted functional gap junction was correlated with abnormal expressions of the proteins involved in the mitochondrial pathway-related apoptosis such as Bcl- 2 /Bax, cytochrome C, Caspase- 9, and Caspase- 3. Taken together, our results provide the first evidence that SNPs-decreased GJIC promotes apoptosis in cardiomyocytes via the mitochondrial pathway. In addition, downregulation of GJIC by SNPs in cardiomyocytes is mediated through downregulation of Cx 43 and upregulation of P-Cx 43. These results suggest that in rat cardiomyocytes cell line, GJIC plays a protective role in SNPs-induced apoptosis and that GJIC {{may be one of the}} targets for SNPs-induced biological effects...|$|E
40|$|Pannexin (Panx) 1 is {{a widely}} {{expressed}} protein that shares structural, but not amino acid, homology with gap junction proteins, the connexins. Panx 1 does not form gap junctions in mammalian cells, but it may function as a plasma membrane hemichannel. Little is known of the pharmacological properties of panx 1 expression in mammalian cells. Here, we identify three variants in the human PANX 1 gene. We expressed these variants and mouse Panx 1 in mammalian cells and compared Panx 1 -induced currents. All human Panx 1 variants and the mouse Panx 1 showed identical protein expression levels, localization patterns, and functional properties, although the frequency of functional expression was species-dependent. Panx 1 currents were independent of changes in extracellular or intracellular calcium or phospholipase C transduction. We found compounds that inhibited Panx 1 currents with a rank order of potency: <b>carbenoxolone</b> > <b>disodium</b> 4, 4 ′-diisothiocyanatostilbene- 2, 2 ′-disulfonate (DIDS) ≈ disodium 4 -acetamido- 4 ′-isothiocyanato-stilben- 2, 2 ′-disulfonate ≈ 5 -nitro- 2 -(3 -phenylpropylamino) benzoic acid > indanyloxyacetic acid 94 >> probenecid >> flufenamic acid = niflumic acid. Triphosphate nucleotides (ATP, GTP, and UTP) rapidly and reversibly inhibited Panx 1 currents via mechanism(s) independent of purine receptors. When Panx 1 was coexpressed with purinergic P 2 X 7 receptor (P 2 X 7 R), DIDS was found {{to act as a}} P 2 X 7 R antagonist to inhibit ATP-evoked currents, but none of the other compounds inhibited P 2 X 7 R currents. This is the first detailed pharmacological characterization of Panx 1 -mediated currents in mammalian cells and sheds new, although contradictory, light on the hypothesis that Panx 1 acts as a hemichannel to allow passage of large molecules in response to P 2 X 7 R activation...|$|R
