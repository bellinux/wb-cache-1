2500|$|The hatchlings, {{which are}} [...] in length, have been {{reported}} to actively hunt prey within a few days of hatching. It is not uncommon for the mother to care for her young even weeks after they have hatched, remaining attentive to their calls and continuing to provide transportation. About five weeks after hatching, the young American crocodiles disband in search of their own independent lives. Most of them, of course, will not survive, being preyed upon by several types of raptorial birds and larger fishes (e.g. barred catfish (Pseudoplatystoma fasciatum), Atlantic tarpons (Megalops atlanticus), <b>common</b> <b>snook</b> (Centropomis undecimalis) and lemon sharks (Negaprion brevirostris)), boa constrictors (Boa constrictor), black spiny-tailed iguana (Ctenosaura similis), spectacled caimans, as well as raccoons.

50|$|The <b>common</b> <b>snook</b> is an estuarine-dependent fish species. Within estuaries, {{juvenile}} <b>common</b> <b>snook</b> {{are most}} often found inhabiting areas such as coastal wetland ponds, island networks, and creeks. Despite being a euryhaline species of fish, <b>common</b> <b>snook</b> do show a tendency to gravitate towards lower salinity conditions {{in the early stages}} of their life. By being able to adapt and thrive in both high and low salinity conditions through osmoregulation, <b>common</b> <b>snook</b> display a high level of habitat plasticity. <b>Common</b> <b>snook</b> are opportunistic predators whose feeding habits indicate that there is a positive relationship between their size and the size of their prey, meaning that as the snook grows it feeds on larger and larger prey. <b>Common</b> <b>snook</b> have been found to occasionally engage in cannibalistic activities, though this behavior is rare. This usually occurs during the winter months when adult and juvenile <b>common</b> <b>snook</b> are in close proximity to one another within their estuarine habitats. This form of cannibalism where the juveniles are fed on by the adults is referred to as intercohort cannibalism. The adult <b>common</b> <b>snook</b> who do cannibalize juveniles most likely target them due to the fact that the juveniles may be the largest of the available prey, and are therefore more nutritionally efficient to prey upon.|$|E

50|$|<b>Common</b> <b>snook,</b> {{like many}} species of fish, are very in tune with their environment, meaning that even a slight change in their {{surroundings}} can {{have a significant impact}} on their behavior. For example, <b>common</b> <b>snook</b> are able to determine when to start and stop spawning based on the temperature and salinity of the water they inhabit, the amount of rainfall in the area and whether or not there is a full moon. However, there are some cases in which disturbances in their environment can have very negative effects on the snook population. One example of this is the devastating results of a cold snap. Snook are very susceptible to cold temperatures, with the effects ranging from the complete halt of all feeding at a water temperature of 14.2 C, to the loss of equilibrium at 12.7 C, to death at a temperature of 12.5 C. Recently, a cold snap in January 2010 resulted in a 41.88% decline in nominal abundance of the <b>common</b> <b>snook</b> population in Southwest Florida from the previous year and a 96-97% post-cold event decrease in apparent survival estimates.|$|E

5000|$|... ‘Róbalo’ or snook are world-renowned {{game fish}} of the Centropomidae family - genus Centropomus {{that are much}} sought after by fly fishing enthusiasts and sportfishing charters. Six Atlantic and six Pacific Ocean species are {{currently}} recognized as scientifically valid. All are known to inhabit Central America and all are excellent gamefish. There is no evidence found of the individual species crossing from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean or vice versa through the Panama Canal. All Robalo or snook species are capable of inhabiting both fresh and saltwater and are known to seasonally occupy Gatun Lake, which forms a water bridge connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans {{as an integral part}} of the Panama Canal. Of the twelve species only 4 are known to reach sizes in excess of 10 lbs. - two Atlantic Ocean species (Centropomus undecimalis and Centropomus poeyi) and two Pacific Ocean species (Centropomus viridis and Centropomus nigrescens). The eight species of smaller Robalo usually grow to less than 6 lbs. and can be readily distinguished by from the four larger species by their noticeably longer anal spine, anal fin configuration and body shape. The four large species are immediately recognizable by their more streamlined appearance given by the longer narrower body shape. Many individual species of Robalo bear a close resemblance to one another although they may be from the same or different oceans so identification is best left up to experts. The two Atlantic Ocean large Robalo species (Centropomus undecimalis and Centropomus poeyi) are virtually identical in appearance. They can usually only be distinguished by the number of gill rakers each possesses. The Robalo or <b>common</b> <b>snook</b> (Centropomus undecimalis) commonly has eleven to thirteen non-rudimentary gill rakers and the Mexican snook (Centropomus Poeyi) is most often found to possess fifteen to eighteen non-rudimentary gill rakers. The Pacific Ocean “Robalo Ñato” or white snook (Centropomus viridis) is also a dead ringer for the <b>common</b> <b>snook</b> (Centropomus undecimalis). The distinguishing feature is also the non-rudimentary gill raker count with thirteen to fifteen for the white snook (Centropomus Viridis). They act, breed, grow and fight virtually the same. Curiously, laboratory reared specimens of the <b>common</b> <b>snook</b> (Centropomus undecimalis) showed meristic variations in vertebrae, fin ray and gill raker numbers not observed in specimens from the wild. These variations are suspected to be due to diet and growth rates. Large Robalo caught in Lake Gatun invariably cause a wealth of confusion. The IGFA requires verification of the species by a designated authority for world record claims. The two Pacific Ocean species of large Robalo (Centropomus viridis and Centropomus nigrescens) are somewhat easier to distinguish.|$|E

40|$|<b>Common</b> <b>snook</b> (Centropomus undecimalis) is a {{relatively}} new species for aquaculture; considered as a recreational species and not commercial. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop <b>common</b> <b>snook</b> larval rearing techniques for stock enhancement. <b>Common</b> <b>snook</b> culture has two main bottlenecks, broodstock management and larval culture. High mortality during the first 6 days is the main limitation for successful larval survival. Broodstock management of <b>common</b> <b>snook</b> is still developing and the only source of <b>common</b> <b>snook</b> eggs is from wild broodstock. Securing a regular supply during the natural spawning was essential to reach the main objective. Finding the optimal spawning sites, as well as optimal spawning time was achieved. Results showed Terra Ceia, Longboat and Cayo Costa to be the best sites for wild broodstock collection. The onset of spawning was triggered by a rise in water temperature. During the 4 years of this study spawning started at the end of May and finished in September. Total capture results and egg quality results, such as fertilization, hatching rate and lipid analysis, indicated June and July as the peak months during the spawning season. <b>Common</b> <b>snook</b> follow a lunar spawning cycle. Results showed that one to three days after the new and full moon were the peak spawning periods and therefore the best days to capture wild stock. <b>Common</b> <b>snook</b> egg lipid composition fits the general marine fish fatty acid composition with saturated fatty acids predominating. On the other hand, the omega 3, omega 6 (n- 3 /n- 6) ratio was lower than the typical marine fish and arachidonic acid values were significantly higher than other marine species. This egg fatty acid profile will be helpful in the future to compare it with captive spawned eggs for egg quality purposes. Description of the <b>common</b> <b>snook</b> embryonic and larval development for the first 14 days was carried out. This has strengthened knowledge for this species’ development, and should provide a helpful tool to identify <b>common</b> <b>snook</b> embryos and larvae in the wild. Novel improvements to existing <b>common</b> <b>snook</b> larval culture protocols were implemented. Larval lipid analysis throughout development, and high mortality around day 6 post hatching, suggested that <b>common</b> <b>snook</b> larvae were dying of starvation. Gross morphological development and ultra-structure findings in the digestive and eye system development during the first three days indicated that day 2 post hatching larvae were capable of capturing and digesting food. Additionally, larval nutritional improvements were made, increasing the larval survival. The most significant ones were: finding a smaller and more nutritional prey (SS type rotifers and copepods), finding an optimal stocking and feeding density and the importance that green water technique has on larval survival. Overall, larval success was improved from a zero percent survival during the first 14 days to a 2 % survival rate.

40|$|Disturbances that alter cross-habitat {{food web}} {{linkages}} {{can lead to}} whole-scale changes to aquatic systems. In coastal rivers of the Everglades (Florida, U. S.

In the dry season, rainfall decreases and floodplains dry, forcing floodplain prey into these river systems. These prey provide a prey subsidy for an estuarine predator, the <b>common</b> <b>snook</b> (Centropomus undecimalis). In 2011, severe drought impacted the region, likely affecting this prey subsidy.

In this study, we used fishery independent capture-based sampling to evaluate where <b>Common</b> <b>Snook</b> occurred in Tampa Bay and if it changed with spawning season, and passive acoustic telemetry to assess fine scale behavior at an inlet spawning site (2007 - 2009). Snook concentrated in three areas during the spawning season only one of which fell within the expected spawning habitat. Although in lower numbers, they remained in these areas throughout the winter months. Acoustically-tagged snook (n =  31) showed two seasonal patterns at the spawning site: Most fish occurred during the spawning season but several fish displayed more extended residency, supporting the capture-based findings that <b>Common</b> <b>Snook</b> exhibit facultative catadromy. Spawning site selection for iteroparous, multiple-batch spawning fishes occurs at the lifetime, annual, or intra-annual temporal scales. In this study we show colonization of a new spawning site, indicating that lifetime spawning site fidelity of <b>Common</b> <b>Snook</b> is not fixed at this fine spatial scale. However, individuals did exhibit annual and intra-seasonal spawning site fidelity to this new site over the three years studied. The number of fish at the spawning site increased in June and July (peak spawning months) and on new and full lunar phases indicating within population variability in spawning and movement patterns. Intra-seasonal patterns of detection also differed significantly with sex. <b>Common</b> <b>Snook</b> exhibited divergent migration tactics and habitat use at the annual and estuarine scales, with contingents using different overwintering habitat.
