6000|$|Brangwen {{could not}} understand. He had {{pictures}} of a <b>cattle-truck</b> full of naked girls riding from nowhere to nowhere, of Lydia laughing because her father made great debts and said, [...] "I know, I know"; of Jews running down the street shouting in Yiddish, [...] "Don't do it, don't do it," [...] and being cut down by demented peasants--she called them [...] "cattle"--whilst she looked on interested and even amused; of tutors and governesses and Paris and a convent. It {{was too much for}} him. And there she sat, telling the tales to the open space, not to him, arrogating a curious superiority to him, a distance between them, something strange and foreign and outside his life, talking, rattling, without rhyme or reason, laughing when he was shocked or astounded, condemning nothing, confounding his mind and making the whole world a chaos, without order or stability of any kind. Then, when they went to bed, he knew that {{he had nothing to do}} with her. She was back in her childhood, he was a peasant, a serf, a servant, a lover, a paramour, a shadow, a nothing. He lay still in amazement, staring at the room he knew so well, and wondering whether it was really there, the window, the chest of drawers, or whether it was merely a figment in the atmosphere. And gradually he grew into a raging fury against her. But because he was so much amazed, and there was as yet such a distance between them, and she was such an amazing thing to him, with all wonder opening out behind her, he made no retaliation on her. Only he lay still and wide-eyed with rage, inarticulate, not understanding, but solid with hostility.|$|E

While I have {{traced the}} finer and higher laws {{of this matter}} for those whom they concern, I have also to note the {{material}} law--vulgarly expressed in the proverb, [...] "Honesty is the best policy." [...] That proverb is indeed wholly inapplicable to matters of private interest. It is not true that honesty, as far as material gain is concerned, profits individuals. A clever and cruel knave will in a mixed society always be richer than an honest person can be. But Honesty is the best [...] "policy," [...] if policy mean practice of State. For fraud gains nothing in a State. It only enables the knaves in it to live {{at the expense of}} honest people; while there is for every act of fraud, however small, a loss of wealth to the community. Whatever the fraudulent person gains, some other person loses, as fraud produces nothing; and there is, besides, the loss of the time and thought spent in accomplishing the fraud, and of the strength otherwise obtainable by mutual help (not to speak of the fevers of anxiety and jealousy in the blood, which are a heavy physical loss, as I will show in due time). Practically, when the nation is deeply corrupt cheat answers to cheat; every one is in turn imposed upon, and there is to the body politic the dead loss of the ingenuity, together with the incalculable mischief of the injury to each defrauded person, producing collateral effect unexpectedly. My neighbour sells me bad meat: I sell him in return flawed iron. We neither of us get one atom of pecuniary advantage on the whole transaction, but we both suffer unexpected inconvenience; my men get scurvy, and his <b>cattle-truck</b> runs off the rails.|$|E

In general, non-white people and those born in enemy nations were not welcomed into the military. When blacks from Sydney, Nova Scotia volunteered their services, they were told, [...] "This is not for you fellows, this is a white man's war." [...] Nonetheless, some segregated units were formed. In 1915, Indigenous people were allowed to enlist and accepted into a 114th battalion as well as others. In total, about 3,500 Indigenous people would serve with the Canadian Forces, but this figure has been disputed. The Canadian Japanese Association in British Columbia put forward a volunteer reserve force of 227 men, {{some of whom were}} later admitted into the military. The No. 2 Construction Battalion included black soldiers from both Canada and the United States, the latter having crossed into Canada in order to participate. The over one thousand Black Canadians who served would continue to be segregated during their tour, both on ships and in camps.
