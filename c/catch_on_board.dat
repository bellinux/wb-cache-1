50|$|The ECO-HARVESTING™ {{gathering}} method {{employs a}} continuous mid-water/pelagic trawl {{system that is}} guarded by a fine mesh net, which prevents anything larger than krill from entering. Underwater cameras monitor the system. Rather than heaving a trawl to get the <b>catch</b> <b>on</b> <b>board,</b> a conveyor hose {{is attached to the}} end of the net, which remains underwater throughout the entire operation. A continuous stream of water flows through the hose, bringing the live krill directly into the ship. Supply vessels offload products, bring fuel and replace the crew of the fishing grounds. The products are shipped to a hub in South America, and then distributed to the global market. Aker's fishing vessels feature a processing plant that transforms the entire content of the catch into meal. Historically, retrieving the innumerable krill in the Antarctic waters has been difficult, because of the krill’s delicate nature. Once a krill dies, its powerful digestive enzymes quickly break down the body tissue, rendering it useless before processing.|$|E

40|$|Small-scale {{fisheries}} are {{an important}} fisheries sector in Greece and the Mediterranean. They are characterized by high heterogeneity and a multitude of particularities. The management of small-scale fisheries requires taking into account biological {{as well as social}} and economical elements. In the present study, a typology of Greek small-scale fisheries was developed based on biological, social and economical parameters. Consequently, the study focused in the Patraikos Gulf, where elements such as the fishing activity of the local fleet, catch and catch per unit of effort, species composition, discards and length composition of individuals caught were examined. The prefectures of Greece were stratified considering the number of fishermen and local dependence on fisheries and interviews of fishermen were carried out. The multitude of fishing gears and target species and the intense spatial heterogeneity was confirmed. The major activity pattern identified was seasonal (20 days of activity in summer, 13 in winter), however local particularities arose. The main metiers practiced were identified as combinations of fishing gear, target species, area and season. Concerning socio-economical elements, the fishermen generally had low education, high average age, tendency to remain in their place of birth and the profession is attached to the family. The fishermen were categorized into three dependence groups, based on the percentage of income originating from fisheries. Significant differences were identified among these groups considering variables such as mean fishermen age, vessel size, days of activity and income from fishing. Consequently, the small-scale fisheries of the Patraikos Gulf were studied using data from sampling of fishing operations. The catch weighted about 12 kg per operation on average and a total of 102 species were recorded. A methodology for the identification of metiers using a limited dataset, {{as is often the case}} in the Mediterranean, was developed. The metiers identified showed significant differences in catch quantity and composition and were grouped in meta-metiers to facilitate fishing activity sampling schemes. The study of discards revealed three reasons for discarding: low commercial value (78 % of discards), destruction of the catch before gear retrieval (5 %) and bad handling of the <b>catch</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> (17 %). High discard ratio was recorded for the longline and small-size mesh trammel net metiers. Using data of individual length per species, comparisons were carried out among metiers and seasons that in most cases revealed significant differences. The study of the effect of minimum landing sizes legislation showed a low percentage of undersized individuals regarding both the legislation currently in effect and the proposed one by the Roadmap for the Reform of the Common Fisheries Policy of the European Union, but exceptions arose for certain species. The present work is the foothold for the development of a methodology for studying small-scale fisheries in Greece and for carrying out comparative studies in a European scale concerning this understudied fishing sector. ...|$|E

40|$|This report {{provides}} {{a detailed analysis}} of work-related injuries and vessel safety issues within the Bering Sea/Aleutian Island (BSAI) crab fleet to identify both hazards and opportunities for safety improvements within the fleet. The BSAI crab fleet is comprised of vessels averaging 90 - 120 feet in length that use pot gear to harvest crab, and either process the <b>catch</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> or deliver it to on-shore or floating processors (Woodley & Medlicott, 2001). The fishing seasons for various species of BSAI crab begin in October and typically end by May. The findings and recommendations in this report are especially relevant to the North Pacific Fishery Management Council, United States Coast Guard, and the Bering Sea/Aleutian Island crab fleet. The BSAI crab fleet was identified as the most hazardous commercial fishery in the United States during the 1990 s (Lincoln et al., 2013). During that decade, 73 crewmembers in the fleet {{died as a result of}} vessel disasters, falls overboard, or on-board injuries (Lincoln et al., 2013). Although safety regulations in place at that time required vessels to carry lifesaving equipment, such as immersion suits and life rafts, the regulations did not address the problem of overloading vessels with crab pots, a major cause of vessel disasters and deaths. This gap in safety regulations was partially corrected by the Coast Guard in 1999 with the introduction of the "At-the-Dock Stability and Safety Compliance Check" program, in which Coast Guard personnel checked crab vessels in Dutch Harbor prior to departure to ensure that each was loaded in compliance with their stability instructions. Subsequent to the introduction of this program, along with other possible factors such as changes in safety culture, the number and rate of fatalities in the fleet decreased during the period 1999 - 2012 (Lincoln et al., 2013; Woodley et al., 2009). In addition to the Coast Guard Compliance Checks, the BSAI crab fishery changed in 2005 from a derby-style race for fish to a quota-based (rationalized) system. This management change contributed to an extended fishing season, smaller pot loads, and allowed for a more experienced and potentially less fatigued crew (Woodley et al., 2009). The change was also associated with a consolidation of the fishing fleet, from an average of 243 vessels during 2001 - 2004 to 78 vessels during 2005 - 2010 (North Pacific Fishery Management Council, 2010). Fatal injuries in the BSAI crab fleet have decreased substantially through the combined and cooperative efforts of the fishing industry, Coast Guard, and National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS). Further improvements in crewmember safety may be obtained by analyzing the causes of nonfatal injuries and vessel casualties, and developing focused interventions to address hazards. This report summarizes these hazards in the BSAI crab fleet during the 2005 / 06 - 2012 / 13 seasons. The results can be used to develop recommendations to improve safety within the fleet by the industry, Coast Guard, and fisheries management. Suggested Citation: NIOSH (2016).

40|$|Discarding in {{fisheries}} {{is believed}} to be a waste of natural resources, as it is the part of the total <b>catch</b> brought <b>on</b> <b>board</b> but then returned to the sea dead or alive for any reason. This study aims to advance knowledge of the discards associated with the deep water rose shrimp fisheries in the south-central Mediterranean Sea. We address this issue by examining the data collected within the module of commercial catch monitoring (Campbiol) of European data collection framework (DCF) between January 2009 and December 2013. Multivariate data analysis and the generalized additive model (GAMs) were used to assess the spatio-temporal composition of the discard and factors influencing its distribution. Overall, discard represented 32. 9 ± 15. 4 % of the total catch. Multiple analysis of variance highlighted the significant effect on discard assemblage only for the factor of depth (p-value < 0. 05). In general, bony fish were the most discarded organisms (23. 5 ± 14. 4 %). Cartilaginous fish, crustaceans and other invertebrates represented approximately 13 % of the total catch. The fraction of discard in the catch presented significant variation regarding the years, depth and fishing ground. Our results showed that most of the discards in the deep water rose shrimp (DPS) fisheries are due to species that have a minimum legal size (Hake, DPS, Trachurus spp.), and are consequently subjected to the discard ban (art. 15 of the reg. EU 1380 / 2013). To avoid the landing of discards, specific measures aimed to minimize the unwanted catches of undersized species should be implemented...|$|R

40|$|In {{the context}} of the landing {{obligation}} under the European Common Fisheries Policy, electronic monitoring (EM) is often presented as one of the solutions to fully document catches. EM includes video monitoring to record the <b>catch</b> handling process <b>on</b> <b>board</b> the vessels. This study evaluated the efficacy of EM for cod (Gadus morhua) <b>catches</b> <b>on</b> vessels in a mixed bottom-trawl fishery and tested the hypothesis that cod catches are difficult to detect with video monitoring, specifically in catches with large volumes of bycatch. In 2011, a catch quota pilot study started for cod in the Dutch bottom-trawl fishery in which EM was used as an audit system to review the consistency of reported cod catches. Eleven vessels joined the pilot study on a voluntary basis. Participants received a 30 % increase in individual quota for cod and were compensated with extra effort in days at sea. In return, all cod catches were counted against their cod quota. This mixed bottom-trawl fishery differs from fisheries where EM was proven to be a successful method, e. g. hook and line or single-species fisheries with low bycatch volumes. We conclude that distinguishing small numbers of cod in catches of mixed bottom-trawl fisheries is difficult because there is a low correlation between logbook and video data (Pearson r = 0. 17). We expect similar difficulty in other mixed demersal trawl fisheries with large bycatch volumes, when similar-looking species are targeted. Meanwhile, implementing a landing obligation will pose large challenges for fisheries with large volumes of bycatch. Limitations in the applicability of EM to control {{one of the most common}} types of fisheries in Europe will be a burden on the implementation of the European landing obligation.

The proposed EU Common Fisheries Policy reform, to be implemented in 2014, sets out a gradual elimination of discards by reducing unwanted catches and ensuring that all catches are landed. To develop successful discard mitigation measures it is necessary to identify the reasons for discarding. Here we have developed a simple model that can be applied to data from observer programmes to establish the contribution of different drivers of discarding behaviour. The analysis makes inferences on the causes of discarding by partitioning discards into four categories based on the length of the fish and the associated regulatory restrictions. The drivers are defined as: fish discarded below the legal minimum landing size; fish {{for which there is no}} market and that do not have a MLS (minimum landing size); fish for which there are inconsistencies in market and sorting practices; and discards that can be attributed to fishermen’s responses to quota restrictions. The approach is applied to data generated from observer programmes from five European Member States. All of the inferred drivers contribute to the total discard quantity. Their relative contributions vary widely across countries, areas, gears and species. JRC. H. 1 -Water Resource...|$|R
