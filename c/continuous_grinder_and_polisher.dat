50|$|Before the {{development}} of float glass, larger sheets of plate glass were made by casting a large puddle of glass on an iron surface, and then polishing both sides, a costly process. From the early 1920s, a continuous ribbon of plate glass was passed through a lengthy series of inline <b>grinders</b> <b>and</b> <b>polishers,</b> reducing glass losses and cost.|$|R

After brief flushing with saline, specimens were fixed in formalin (buffered 4  %). Prior to embedding, macroscopic evaluation and photo documentation were accomplished. After fixation, tissue blocks {{containing the}} devices were embedded in resin methylmethacrylate (Technovit 9100, Kulzer & Co, Wehrheim, Germany). Following hardening, resin blocks were subsequently sectioned in slices of 0.8  mm using a diamond band saw (300 CP, Exakt GmbH, Norderstedt, Germany). These slices were ground down to 5 – 30  μm with a horizontal rotatory <b>grinder</b> <b>and</b> <b>polisher</b> (400 CS, Exakt GmbH, Norderstedt, Germany) [12].|$|R
40|$|Tell el-Retaba is {{an archaeological}} site {{located in the}} Wadi Tumilat, 35 km west of Ismailiya in Egypt. The joint Polish-Slovak Archaeological Mission has been {{conducting}} research there since 2007. This paper reports {{the results of the}} analysis of the flint assemblages found at the site from 2010 to 2016. The excavations revealed 180 flint artefacts in stratigraphic units dated from the Second Intermediate Period to the Late Period. The flint assemblages include sickle blades, retouched flakes <b>and</b> blades, pounders, <b>grinders,</b> <b>polishers</b> <b>and</b> some other examples of implements. The flint tool forms and the contexts of their find are described and the preliminary analysis of the raw materials is conducted. The study indicates that there are some differences in the tool forms and the raw materials used for their production in particular historical periods at the site...|$|R

5000|$|The Celebration of Japanese ArtsThe {{university}} {{agreed to}} house {{one of the}} most renowned and respected swordsmiths in Japan in the spring of 1980. Master Yoshindo Yoshihara hoped to come to the United States and demonstrate how blades were forged and ultimately produce the first Samurai blades forged in the Western Hemisphere. In the early spring of 1980, the garden between the art buildings was transformed into a Japanese setting with plants and a gravel surface to welcome the guests. The project began on Holy Saturday, after the lighting of the fire of sacramental order. Yoshihara, inside the Kaji-Ba, struck the first fire with flint and steel at the forge, and began with raw ore that had been transported from Japan. Along with Yoshihara and his assistants there was also a hibaki maker, <b>grinder,</b> <b>and</b> a <b>polisher.</b> The scabbard <b>and</b> hibaki makers sat on tatami mats inside the sculpture studio, which is currently the printmaking studio at the university. 16 blades were completed, and three from raw ore. One is in the Metropolitan, one in Boston, and the third in on the University of Dallas Campus. A week long Shinsa was offered in upstairs Haggar. Here the blades made by Yoshihara were evaluated and approved for transportation.Along with the smithing, The Samurai Sword Museum in Kyoto offered to send an exhibition of spear heads, blades, kutani, and Tsuba. The University also housed an exhibition of Japanese ceramics in the Art building. The blades were displayed in the University Gallery, located then where the student life offices are now. They were considered so valuable that they were guarded during the day. So precious were they that no catalogue or identifying labels were permitted. The oldest was 10th century.Also offered in the Campus wide Celebration of the Japanese Arts was a tea ceremony, flower arranging, and kite flying. Among the UD Community Education programs was an eight-week instructional class on [...] "Beginning Ikebana Japanese Floral Art" [...] along with a four-week lecture series on [...] "Zen and Contemporary American Literature" [...] and an eight-week lecture series on [...] "Treasures of Japanese Civilization." [...] A 30-minute, 16mm film “ Samurai” was made by Lowell Jordan that shows the process of the forging of the blades on the University campus. The film was shown on PBS and also won a silver medal at an International film Festival.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{cleaners}} <b>and</b> <b>polishers</b> contain {{properties that}} “... {{have been proven}} to age poorly.” [...] Resultantly, {{the use of such}} cleaners <b>and</b> <b>polishers</b> can prove detrimental. The use of ammonia based cleaning products for example on brass clock components can lead to an irreversible form of damage called Stress Corrosion Cracking. Depending on the type of metal on which it is used, a metallic brush employed to apply cleaning products not only can create the proper conditions for corrosion, but can “... remove any protective oxide layers even with careful use.” ...|$|R

The whizzing bullets accidentally topple a box of ammunition into the <b>grinder,</b> <b>and</b> the <b>grinder</b> becomes a makeshift Gatling gun. Discovering the chance, they add more ammunition and even a gun belt serving as an ad hoc ammunition belt. The increase in opposing firepower overwhelm the bandits until General Muster and his soldiers arrives and captures them. As the Stooges are given kudos for a job well done, the monkey goes to the <b>grinder</b> <b>and</b> twists the handle, firing a few shots that caused the three to be hit and flee the area.|$|R
