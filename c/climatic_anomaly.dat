I am inclined to agree with Montesquieu and Buckle, that it is an affair of latitude and climate and race, and on these grounds alone its existence among a Saxon people, living in the north temperate zone, is a <b>climatic</b> <b>anomaly.</b> It did not grow out of any structural, or race, or social, or climatic necessities, and if it be, as asserted, the offspring of revelation here, I can only say that it needed a revelation to start it. That it has scriptural patriarchal origin and example is probably true, but that was in another age than ours, and in a different land. If Abraham had lived on the line of the overland road in the afternoon of the nineteenth century; if Isaac had been surrounded by 40,000,000 monogamous Yankees; if Jacob had associated with miners and been jostled by speculators, there would, I apprehend, have been a different order of social life in Palestine. The Mormon doctrine may be the true theology, and the writings of Joseph Smith the most direct revelations. The practice of polygamy may be a safeguard against the vice of unlicensed indulgence, and the social life of Utah the most sanitary of social reforms. All the advantages claimed for this State may be actual, but nevertheless the fact exists that polygamy is an anomaly in this Republic, existing hitherto by the sufferance of a people who now declare that it shall exist no longer.|$|E

Using long-term data sets, we show how large-scale <b>climatic</b> <b>anomalies</b> in the Southern Hemisphere affect the foraging behaviour and population dynamics of a key marine predator, the king penguin. When large-scale subtropical dipole events occur simultaneously in both subtropical Southern Indian and Atlantic Oceans, they generate tropical anomalies that shift the foraging zone southward. Consequently the distances that penguins foraged from the colony and their feeding depths increased and the population size decreased. This represents {{an example of a}} robust and fast impact of large-scale <b>climatic</b> <b>anomalies</b> affecting a marine predator through changes in its at-sea behaviour and demography, despite lack of information on prey availability.

40|$|A {{series of}} severe and {{prolonged}} droughts occurred throughout the Northern Hemisphere between approximately 1150 BP to 600 BP. This phenomenon {{is referred to}} as the Medieval <b>Climatic</b> <b>Anomaly</b> and has been shown to have differentially impacted various regions of the world. Previous studies have suggested causal links between the Medieval <b>Climatic</b> <b>Anomaly</b> and observed culture change. The goal of this study was to examine the Antelope Valley region of the Mojave Desert for evidence of impacts on human populations related to the Medieval <b>Climatic</b> <b>Anomaly.</b> To achieve this goal, a sample selection of archaeological sites was chosen from lands within Edwards Air Force Base. These sites represented occupations which occurred immediately before, during, and after the Medieval <b>Climatic</b> <b>Anomaly.</b> Site assemblages were analyzed and compared by cultural period, with cross-comparisons made of artefactual and ecofactual constituents. Site densities and areal extents were also examined and compared. These analyses showed the emergence of trends concurrent with the introduction of the Medieval <b>Climatic</b> <b>Anomaly.</b> The data supports the hypothesis that humans who populated the Antelope Valley region of the Mojave Desert during this period may have engaged in population aggregation, with a tethered nomadism subsistence strategy. The data also shows evidence that upon the amelioration of the environment after the Medieval <b>Climatic</b> <b>Anomaly,</b> site characteristics within the region saw a significant shift. While the evidence generated by this study does suggest a link between climatic change experienced during the Medieval <b>Climatic</b> <b>Anomaly</b> and change observed within the archaeology of the Antelope Valley, it does not suggest climate as a sole, or even primary, causal factor. Rather, the intent of this study was to identify one possible variable responsible for observed change that occurred in the region.

A detailed understanding of the conditions and timing of the most recent dune reactivation (during the Medieval <b>Climatic</b> <b>Anomaly,</b> from 900 to 1300 AD) is important given the possibility for future reactivations. Wind patterns, loss and return of vegetative cover to the dunes, and timing of the last reactivation were all examined. ^ Paleowinds from dune crest orientations and internal structures were compared with modern meteorological data. Strong northwesterly winds are recognized from both periods. A major shift in secondary winds is recognized with dry southwesterly winds present during the last dune reactivation and moist south to southeasterly winds present today. ^ Pocket gopher burrows were studied across the Nebraska Sand Hills to determine the pattern of vegetative loss during the Medieval <b>Climatic</b> <b>Anomaly.</b> Most of these burrows occur in areas of low-angle cross-bedded strata, suggesting vegetative loss occurred first on the crests of the newly formed dunes, while vegetation persisted in the interdunes. Pocket gophers likely survived initially in areas of remaining vegetation and subsequently on roots in the recently buried soil. Ultimately, the gophers were unable to reach their food source and they were forced to abandon the uplands. ^ The timing of the last dune reactivation in the Nebraska Sand Hills was studied using optically stimulated luminescence dating. A spatial trend occurs across the area with older ages (∼ 850 to 1, 000 years) in the northwestern Sand Hills, and younger ages (∼ 500 to 600 years) in the southeast.

40|$|Seasonal climate {{anomalies}} over North America exhibit {{rather large}} variability between years {{characterized by the}} same ENSO phase. This lack of consistency reduces potential statistically based ENSO-related climate predictability. The authors show that the North Pacific oscillation (NPO) exerts a modulating effect on ENSO teleconnections. Sea level pressure (SLP) data over the North Pacific, North America, and the North Atlantic and daily rainfall records in the contiguous United States are used to demonstrate that typical ENSO signals tend to be stronger and more stable during preferred phases of the NPO. Typical El Niño patterns (e. g., low pressure over the northeastern Pacific, dry northwest, and wet southwest, etc.) are strong and consistent only during the high phase of the NPO, which is associated with an anomalously cold northwestern Pacific. The generally reversed SLP and precipitation patterns during La Niña winters are consistent only during the low NPO phase. <b>Climatic</b> <b>anomalies</b> tend to be weak and spatially incoherent during low NPO–El Niño and high NPO–La Niña winters.

40|$|A {{number of}} organisms, {{especially}} insects, are extending their range in {{response of the}} increasing trend of warmer temperatures. However, the effects of more frequent <b>climatic</b> <b>anomalies</b> on these species are not clearly known. The pine processionary moth, Thaumetopoea pityocampa, is a forest pest that is currently extending its geographical distribution in Europe in response to climate warming. However, its population density largely decreased in its northern expansion range (near Paris, France) the year following the 2003 heat wave. In this study, we tested whether the 2003 heat wave could have killed {{a large part of}} egg masses. First, the local heat wave intensity was determined. Then, an outdoor experiment was conducted to measure the deviation between the temperatures recorded by weather stations and those observed within sun-exposed egg masses. A second experiment was conducted under laboratory conditions to simulate heat wave conditions (with night/day temperatures of 20 / 32 °C and 20 / 40 °C compared to the control treatment 13 / 20 °C) and measure the potential effects of this heat wave on egg masses. No effects were noticed on egg development. Then, larvae hatched from these egg masses were reared under mild conditions until the third instar and no delayed effects on the development of larvae were found. Instead of eggs, the 2003 heat wave had probably affected directly or indirectly the young larvae that were already hatched when it occurred. Our results suggest that the effects of extreme <b>climatic</b> <b>anomalies</b> occurring over narrow time windows are difficult to determine because they strongly depend on the life stage of the species exposed to these anomalies. However, these effects could potentially reduce or enhance the average warming effects. As extreme weather conditions are predicted to become more frequent in the future, it is necessary to disentangle the effects of the warming trend from the effects of <b>climatic</b> <b>anomalies</b> when predicting the response of a species to climate change...|$|R

40|$|There is {{a growing}} amount of {{evidence}} for environmental impacts on human behaviour linked to the Medieval <b>Climatic</b> <b>Anomaly</b> (AD 800 – 1350). For example, Jones and others (1999) reported striking correlations between drought and changes in subsistence, population, exchange, health, and interpersonal violence from four regions of western North America, {{and the collapse of}} Classic Maya cities in Mesoamerica is roughly coincident with this time period (Neff et al, 2006). In Australia, however, there is relatively little known paleoenvironmental evidence for the MCA, let alone any impacts it may have had on Aboriginal populations. In a 2002 publication, we reported radiocarbon determinations obtained from heat-retainer hearths (or earth ovens) from a single location in far northwestern New South Wales, Australia, which suggested a cessation in hearth construction during a period that coincides with the Medieval <b>Climatic</b> <b>Anomaly.</b> In this paper, we present the results of further investigation of the temporal and spatial patterns of Aboriginal occupation in this region during the Holocene. The analysis of more that 150 radiocarbon age determinations obtained from hearths at five sampling locations throughout western New South Wales suggests that the human response to this climatic shift varied regionally in ways that may reflect the local availability of water. Locations with multiple and/or abundant water sources exhibit a more continuous sequence of hearth ages across the MCA period than those with a single, more restricted water source. We hypothesise that Aboriginal people abandoned the drier locations for periods lasting up to several hundred years and returned only when climatic conditions ameliorated. At the better watered locations, there is no evidence for similar periods of abandonment. Thus, late Holocene environmental changes may have had a direct influence on patterns of human occupation in the semi-arid rangelands of Australia. 2 page(s...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{analysis}} of corrected ship reports [sea level pressure (SLP), sea surface temperature (SST), air temperature (AT) ] and corrected land data (SLP, AT, rainfall) in the Indian sector reveals {{the existence of}} two low-frequency modes of monsoon variability during the 1900 - 1970 period. - A definite biennial (B) mode exists on the SLP fields. This B oscillation is unambiguously linked with a southwest-northeast SLP anomaly gradient. During the summer monsoon, the B SLP pattern {{can be interpreted as}} an expansion/contraction of the monsoon activity since this mode is strongly coupled with rainfall variations over peninsular India. - A strong low-frequency (LF) mode with period spanning 4 - 6 years is also seen on SLP fields over the Indian Ocean and subcontinent. The variance associated with this band is typically more important than the one observed for the B mode, and its spatial mark is also strikingly different since it is linked with a global pattern of variation. This mode has also a strong influence on the Indian summer rainfall fluctuations, particularly on the Ghats and in the Indo-Gangetic plains. The amplitude of these oscillations varies widely during the 1900 - 1970 period. The LF mode is well defined during 1900 - 1923 and 1947 - 1970. There is a tendency for the energy associated with the B mode to decrease on the land while it increases over the Indian Ocean during the whole 1900 - 1970 interval. Although these two timescales exist also on SST fields, cross-spectral analysis shows that ocean-atmosphere interactions are much stronger at the B timescale. This result stresses the B nature of the monsoon system. The existence of these interannual signals in the Indian areas where the annual cycle is so strong raises difficult problems : How can <b>climatic</b> <b>anomalies</b> persist for several years in spite of strong seasonality ? Or, still more intriguing, how can be explained the persistence of <b>climatic</b> <b>anomalies</b> during one year and the appearance of opposite sign <b>climatic</b> <b>anomalies</b> in the following year for the B mode ?
