40|$|This {{study has}} {{concerned}} {{itself with the}} comparative efficiency of instructions, elicitations, and reinforcements in the manipulation of affective verbal behavior. Bandura has suggested that simple instructions to emit a verbal operant would be superior to the usual reinforcement <b>contingency</b> <b>procedure</b> in increasing verbal response rate. The {{results indicate that the}} instruction groups achieved significantly higher rates for both positive and negative emotional words than the reinforcement groups supporting Bandura's prediction. The elicitation group also exceeded the reinforcement group in the emission of negative affect words. It is suggested that verbal behavior can be successfully manipulated by procedures other than the usual verbal conditioning methods. In a recent paper Bandura (1962) has suggested that the verbal conditioning experiment {{can be viewed as a}} problem-solving situation in which the subtle cues or reinforcements dispensed by the experimenter (E) successively guide the subject (5) in selecting the appropriate response from his repertoire of previously acquired verbal behaviors. In line with this interpretation Bandura predicts that a simple request for a verbal operant would be a more efficient means of influencing response emission than the usual responsereinforcement <b>contingency</b> <b>procedure.</b> This proposal rests on the assumption that the appropriate response has already been acquired and the variable being manipulated relates to the temporal discrimination of response emission rather than to the acquisition process per se. Thus, the more directly relevant the cues are to the performance of the task and, inferentially, the more "aware" the 5 is of the relevent response parameters, the greater the degree of response influence. Krasner (1965), on the other hand, has argued that Bandura's suggestion might be feasible when an unambiguous task is required, such as instructions to emit plural nouns.

40|$|AbstractThe good {{behavior}} game (GBG) is an interdependent group <b>contingency</b> <b>procedure</b> {{designed to reduce}} disruptive behavior in classroom settings. In the GBG, a class is divided into groups, simple rules are made, and contingencies are placed on the students’ rule-following behavior. This procedure has been proven effective across various student ages, and its simplicity and long-term effects have contributed to its popularity in school settings. Although it has been systematically evaluated across {{a wide range of}} student ages, research on the GBG is lacking in the area of population- and setting-specific assessments. In this evaluation, the GBG was implemented in three classrooms (student ages 7 - 12) at a school for children with severe problem behavior; in particular, these students had already displayed behavior that might be described as “delinquent” or “predelinquent. ” Disruptive behavior substantially decreased across all three classrooms {{as a result of the}} intervention. This application extends the current literature by systematically replicating the results of the GBG with a different population. Implementation of the GBG, population-specific obstacles, results, and future directions are discussed...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} {{the effectiveness of}} a contingency management program in preventing relapse to illicit opiate use and increasing treatment retention during outpatient methadone detoxification treatment. Twenty male opiate addicts were randomly assigned to an experimental or control group. Following a 3 -week methadone stabilization period, men in both groups received identical gradual methadone dose reductions during Weeks 4 through 9 and were maintained on placebo during Weeks 10 through 13. Beginning in Week 4, control patients received $ 5. 00 for providing a specimen twice weekly. Experimental patients received $ 10. 00 and a take home methadone dose for each opiate-free urine specimen but forfeited the incentives and participated in more intensive clinic procedures when specimens were opiate positive. The <b>contingency</b> management <b>procedure</b> slowed the rate of relapse to illicit opiate use. Experimental patients provided significantly more opiate-free urines during the methadone dose reduction in Weeks 4 through 9 than control patients, although the difference between groups was no longer significant during placebo administration in Weeks 10 through 13. In addition, the contingency management program improved treatment retention and reduced symptom complaints during the detoxification.

In addition, it has become evident that the presynaptic neural firing needs to consistently predict the postsynaptic firing for synaptic plasticity to occur robustly, mirroring at a synaptic level what is known about the importance of contingency in classical conditioning, where zero <b>contingency</b> <b>procedures</b> prevent the association between two stimuli.|$|E
50|$|The Wake Shield Facility {{deployment}} {{operation was}} canceled on Saturday. This delay {{was the result}} of several factors, including radio interference and an inability to read the Wake Shields status lights when the orbiters payload bay is in full sunlight. Deployment originally was scheduled for 10 am CST, but after grappling the free-flyer and lifting it out of the cargo bay and into the pre-deploy position, crew members and investigators on the ground were unable to tell whether power and transmitter status lights were giving the proper indications. After determining that the problem was not a systems failure, but difficulty in reading the status lights, the crew and flight controllers prepared for another release attempt. Interference between the radio transmitter on the Wake Shield Facility and the receiver on its payload bay carrier resulted in a one-day delay.Wake Shield deployment was also cancelled on Sunday, 6 February 1994 during its orbit 53 opportunity at 12:25 pm WSF and flight controllers worked on problems with the Pitch and Roll sensors on WSFs Attitude, Direction and Control system. Astronaut N. Jan Davis moved the wrist joint on the Remote Manipulator System (RMS) arm to try to point WSFs Horizon Sensor into the Sun in an attempt to warm up the sensors electronics package. The last deployment opportunity for Sunday was a 50-minute window beginning at 2:23 EST on orbit 54 but WSF was not ready. It was left mounted on the RMS during the crew sleep period while ground controllers considered their options. On its perch {{at the end of the}} RMS over night, WSF was able to grow 2 Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) thin films. The next deployment opportunity on 7 February 1994 would have been during orbit 67 but payload controllers and flight controllers determined that there would be insufficient time to safely develop <b>contingency</b> <b>procedures</b> in the event that WSF was unable to maintain stable attitude control without the use of its Horizon Sensor. It was decided that for the remainder of the mission, all WSF operations would take place at the end of the RMS and there would be no WSF free-flying operations on the mission.|$|E

40|$|Covariation within {{behavior}} repertoires {{of problem}} children were examined. Two boys, referred for psychological help, were observed both {{at school and}} at home for about 3 yr. A coded observation system permitted scoring of 19 child-behavior categories and six social-environment categories. After a two-month baseline, behavior categories were intercorrelated, demonstrating that each child showed a group of behaviors that covaried. These groupings were specific to the home and school settings. <b>Contingency</b> management <b>procedures</b> were then applied to each child's problem behaviors in one setting. Next, a reversal phase was instituted, followed by resumption of the initial contingency management phase.

40|$|The autoshaping {{procedure}} confounds {{the effects}} of pairing a keylight and food with the effect of adventitious food reinforcement of responses that typically occur before the pecking response. In Experiment I, acquisition of the orientation to the key, the approach toward the key, and the peck at the key were systematically monitored. Orientations to the key and approaches toward the key frequently occurred in contiguity with food presentation before peck acquisition.

When the approach toward the key resulted in nonreinforcement, the probability of occurrence of that response decreased to zero despite repeated light-food pairings.

In Experiment IV, it was shown that {{the effects of}} the stimulus present during the approach toward the key were not due solely to the effects of pairing that stimulus with food.
