5000|$|In {{financial}} economics, a {{liquidity crisis}} {{refers to an}} acute shortage (or [...] "drying up") of liquidity. Liquidity may refer to market liquidity (the ease with which an asset can be converted into a liquid medium, e.g. cash), funding liquidity (the ease with which borrowers can obtain external funding), or accounting liquidity (the health of an institutionâ€™s balance sheet {{measured in terms of}} its <b>cash-like</b> <b>assets).</b> Additionally, some economists define a market to be liquid if it can absorb [...] "liquidity trades" [...] (sale of securities by investors to meet sudden needs for cash) without large changes in price. This shortage of liquidity could reflect a fall in asset prices below their long run fundamental price, deterioration in external financing conditions, {{reduction in the number of}} market participants, or simply difficulty in trading assets.|$|E
5000|$|The ``Fallacy of Large Numbers`` as {{formulated}} by Paul A. Samuelson in 1963. This {{is a very}} important and fundamental paradox in investment advice. Indeed, financial advisers typically advice risky investments for longer time horizons. So that if one for example has an investment horizon of one year typically only cash and <b>cash-like</b> <b>assets</b> are advices. Shares (that are much more risky) are typically advised if the investment horizon is longer (depending on the country culture this is between 3 and 15 years). This seems to make sense, if one has 10K and wants to buy something of 10K on short term, investing in equities is risky as it would not be uncommon to loose 10% on such portfolio on a horizon of one year. The last few hundred years of capitalist history learns us that on longer horizons the probability that equities have a negative return is much lower. Therefore investment advisers will not advice equities on one year but on ten year it might be acceptable. This paradigm is fundamental to all investment advice, but in 1963 Samuelson wrote a short paper arguing that it is not rational to compound a mistake or in other words that [...] "unfairness can only breed unfairness", meaning that it is not rational to accept a series of bets when one would not accept one of the atomic bets (if one is a utility optimizer).|$|E
40|$|We study daily {{money market}} mutual fund flows at the {{individual}} share class level during the crisis of September 2008. The empirical approach that we apply to this fine granularity of data brings new insights into the investor and portfolio holding characteristics that are conducive to run-risk in <b>cash-like</b> <b>asset</b> pools, as well as providing evidence on the time-series dynamics of runs and the equilibria that develop. We propose two identification approaches to test predictions of recent theoretical models with strategic complementarities and incomplete information. First, we study dynamic interactions between investors with differing levels of sophistication within the same money fund, thus holding constant the quality of the underlying portfolio. Second, we employ a novel quantile regression methodology to identify relationships between observable characteristics and tail outcomes. Our results provide considerable support for the theoretical predictions, providing some of the strongest empirical evidence to date on run-like behavior within intermediated asset pools during the financial crisis.
