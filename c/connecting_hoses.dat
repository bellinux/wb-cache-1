40|$|This {{project is}} a part of the {{collaboration}} between the Swedish-Albanian Association in Mariestad and the Albanian Centre of Excellence in Tirana. The {{project is a}} preliminary feasibility study for an improved irrigation system in the mountain village Lubonja, Korça Region, Albania. When the Albanian communism regime fell in 1990, the infrastructure degenerated and the irrigation systems where almost destroyed. Various organizations, like the World Bank, have assisted with the restoring of the systems, especially in the mountain areas. Today, the most of the systems is in functional condition. The village of Lubonja is located in South-Eastern part of Albania. The village {{is a part of}} the Korça Region and is located 27 km from the town Korça. The fields have an altitude that varies from 930 to 870 meters above sea level and have a total approximate size of 490 hectares. Lubonja has a population of almost 560 inhabitants and the prime livelihood is farming. Today, each family is self sufficient and cultivate many kinds of crops on their fields. There are two main streams in the region; the Lubonja River and a river from the Rehova mine area. Lubonja River comes from the mountains and flows through the village, where grey water and black water is added. The other stream is mixed with the polluted water from the old copper mine. There is also a reservoir on the hill side of the mountain which is for irrigation use only. To calculate the needed amount of water, a small field survey has been performed. The different parts in the survey are; soil type, water quality, evaporation and climate data. The results of the field survey were compiled, with assistance of Dr. Kovaçi, Institute of Land in Tirana. It resulted in the irrigation period and the needed amount of water during the irrigation season in Lubonja. The needed amount of water varies from 1250 m 3 /ha to 4300 m 3 /ha depending on the crop and the period when irrigation is necessary is from the middle of May to the end of September. The proposed design of the system is a combination of restoring the old canals in the area, where the system was sufficient and installing a pipe system in the area, where the old system was insufficient. The idea is to irrigate the area with the water which is now wasted from the reservoir due to leaking valves and shallow streams. To eliminate the waste of water, a pipe will lead the water from the outlet of the reservoir to a switch where there is a y-crossing. After the switch one pipe goes to the main canal and the other leads the water to area where the pipe system is implemented. The pipe system will prepare for a usage of modern technology like drip irrigation and sprinklers. Each farmer will be able to choose how to use the water by <b>connecting</b> <b>hoses</b> to taps. Due to the high position of the reservoir the pressure in the pipes will be sufficient without using a pump. The calculations for the system are divided into two parts. The first part is the canals, where an appropriate cross section and the needed amount of concrete are calculated. The amount of concrete for the canals is approximately 200 m 3. The second part is the pipe system, where the pressure and velocity in the pipes and valves are calculated to be certain that a pump will not be needed and to get proper dimensions of the pipes. The maximum pressure is 1 471 500 Pa, the total outflow when all taps are open is 0. 07 m 3 /s and maximum velocity when tap 25 is open is 24. 0 m/s. It is important that a system like this is being implemented in close collaboration with the villagers...|$|E

Aerodynamic and hydrodynamic bearings cannot support loads at zero speed. Both hydrodynamic and hydrostatic bearings may cause contamination to the work-pieces and the work environment because of the use of lubricating fluid. A potential solution to the above-mentioned problems is the new squeeze film air bearing. It works on the rapid squeeze action of an air film to produce separation between two metal surfaces. This has the benefit of being compact with a very simple configuration because it does not require an external pressurized air supply, can support loads at zero speed and is free of contamination. For this research, two squeeze film air journal bearings, made from material of Al 2024 - T 3 and Cu - C 101 with the same geometry, were designed. The bearing is in the shape of a round tube with three fins on the outer surface and the journal, a round rod. When excited at a certain normal mode, the bearing shell flexes with a desirable modal shape for the squeeze film action. The various modes of vibration of Al bearing were obtained from a finite-element model implemented in ANSYS. Two Modes, the 13 th and 23 rd, at the respective frequencies of 16. 320 kHz and 25. 322 kHz, were identified for further investigation by experiments with respect to the squeeze film thickness and its load-carrying capacity. For Cu bearing, the two Modes are also 13 th and 23 rd at the respective frequencies of 12. 184 kHz and 18. 459 kHz. In order to produce dynamic deformation of the bearings at their modes, a single layer piezoelectric actuator was used as a driver. The maximum stroke length and the maximum blocking force of the single layer piezoelectric actuator were determined using manual calculation and ANSYS simulation. In the coupled-field analysis, the single layer piezoelectric actuator was mounted on the outside surface of the bearing shell and loaded with an AC and a DC voltage in order to produce the static and dynamic deformation. For the static analysis, the maximum deformation of Al bearing shell is 0. 124 μm when the actuators are driven at the DC of 75 V. For the dynamic analysis, the actuators are driven at three levels of AC, namely 55, 65 and 75 V with a constant DC offset of 75 V and the driving frequency coincided with the modal frequency of the bearing. The maximum dynamic deformation of Al bearing shell is 3. 22 μm at Mode 13 and 2. 08 μm at Mode 23 when the actuators were driven at the AC of 75 V and the DC of 75 V. Similarly, the FEA simulation was used for analyzing Cu bearing. Furthermore, the dynamic deformation of both Al and Cu bearing at Mode 13 and 23 are validated by experiments. This research developed two theoretical models that explain the existence of a net pressure in a squeeze film for the levitation. The first model uses the ideal gas law as first approximation whilst the second uses the CFX simulation to provide a more exact explanation. In terms of the load-carrying capacity, Mode 13 was identified to be better than Mode 23 for both bearings. However, at Mode 13, Al bearing has a higher load-carrying capacity than Cu bearing. This is due to Al bearing having a higher modal frequency and amplitude. Finally, the coupled-field analysis for fluid solid interaction (FSI) was studied at both Mode 13 and 23 for Al bearing. The findings are that: a) the fluid force in the squeeze film can affect the dynamic deformation of the bearing shell, especially at high oscillation frequency, more at Mode 13 than at Mode 23 due to the relatively high pressure end-leakage in the latter; b) the dynamic deformation of the bearing shell increases with the gap clearance in a logarithmic manner at Mode 13; and c) the micron levels of gap clearance provide a damping effect on the dynamic deformation of the bearing shell at Mode 13 and at Mode 23, though much less dominant.
