5000|$|About a {{year before}} closing its doors, in February 1996, RSG {{announced}} a partnership with <b>CyberCash,</b> Inc. to launch a virtual arcade service based on micropayments. <b>CyberCash,</b> a virtual currency company, would provide the financial infrastructure for the arcade {{and use it to}} jump-start their micropayment [...] "electronic coin service". This announcement was heavily circulated by the media and, along with several other micropayment based services, was heralded as the next big thing in Internet commerce. The arcade was to be based on RSG [...] "V3 Internet game engine" [...] and feature at least 20 classic arcade games with a launch as early as the second half of 1996. The unnamed service was never given a firm launch date nor were any specific titles mentioned. After the initial flurry of excitement the partnership failed to produce any further announcements and the service was never heard from again. It may have been a casualty of the cuts SegaSoft made later that same year when they acquired RSG. Later SegaSoft partnered with <b>CyberCash</b> and used their micropayment system, now named the CyberCoin service, for their Heat.net online gaming service. Heat.net was shut down in 2000 when SegaSoft was restructured into Sega.com and <b>CyberCash</b> filed for bankruptcy a year later.|$|E
5000|$|In 1995, {{the company}} {{proposed}} RFC 1898, <b>CyberCash</b> Credit Card Protocol Version 0.8. The company went public on February 19, 1996, with the symbol [...] "CYCH" [...] and its shares rose 79% {{on the first}} day of trading.In 1998, <b>CyberCash</b> bought ICVerify, makers of computer-based credit card processing software, and in 1999 added another software company to their lineup, purchasing Tellan Software. [...] In January 2000, a teenage Russian hacker nicknamed [...] "Maxus" [...] announced he had cracked CyberCash's ICVerify application; the company denied this, stating that ICVerify was not even in use by the purportedly hacked organization.|$|E
5000|$|On January 1, 2000, {{many users}} of CyberCash's ICVerify {{application}} {{fell victim to}} the Y2K Bug, causing double recording of credit card payments through their system. [...] Although <b>CyberCash</b> had already released a Y2K-compliant update to the software, many users had not installed it.|$|E
50|$|The NetBill {{electronic}} commerce project at Carnegie Mellon university researched distributed transaction processing systems and developed protocols and software to support payment for {{goods and services}} over the Internet. It featured pre-paid accounts from which micropayment charges could be drawn. NetBill was initially absorbed by <b>CyberCash</b> in 1997 and ultimately taken over by PayPal.|$|E
5000|$|With {{the advent}} of the World Wide Web, it became {{necessary}} to provide alternative payment systems. At first, consumers were hesitant to use their credit cards on the Web due to security concerns. Entrepreneurs tried to market an [...] "electronic wallet". As early as 1994, <b>CyberCash</b> allowed consumers to make secure purchases over the Internet.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the first}} books written about carding, 100% Internet Credit Card Fraud Protected, {{featured}} content produced by 'Hawk' of carding group 'Universal Carders'.

50|$|<b>CyberCash</b> {{eventually}} failed. In March of 2000, PayPal {{was formed}} {{and became a}} predominant electronic wallet in the U.S. Similar regional services include WebMoney and Yandex.Money in Russia and Alipay in China. While popular in their own countries, these do not have significant global reach. PayPal and Moneybookers (Skrill) became regional electronic wallets, providing greater liquidity, but still do not provide for {{the free flow of}} funds between all popular electronic wallet solutions.|$|E
50|$|Confinity Inc. is {{best known}} as the creator of PayPal. It was founded in December 1998 by Max Levchin, Peter Thiel, and Luke Nosek, {{initially}} as a Palm Pilot payments and cryptography company. Many of Confinity's initial recruits were alumni of The Stanford Review, also co-founded by Peter Thiel, and most early engineers hailed from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, recruited by Max Levchin. Early investors included Nokia Ventures, Deutsche Bank, and William N. Melton, the founder of <b>CyberCash.</b>|$|E

5000|$|<b>CyberCash,</b> Inc. was an {{internet}} payment service for electronic commerce, headquartered in Reston, Virginia. It {{was founded in}} August 1994 by Daniel C. Lynch (who served as chairman), William N. Melton (who served as president and CEO, and later chairman), Steve Crocker (Chief Technology Officer), and Bruce G. Wilson. The company initially provided an electronic wallet software to consumers and provided software to merchants to accept credit card payments. Later they also offered [...] "CyberCoin", a micropayment system modeled after the NetBill research project at Carnegie Mellon University, which they later licensed.|$|E
50|$|In 1995, Verifone {{began the}} first of its {{aggressive}} steps to enter an entirely new area, that of Internet-based transactions. In May 1995, the company partnered with Broadvision Inc., a developer of Internet, interactive television, computer network, and other software, to couple Verifone's Virtual Terminal software—a computer-based version of its standard transaction terminal—with BroadVision's offerings, thereby extending Verifone's products beyond the retail counter for the first time. In August 1995, however, Verifone took an even bigger step into the Internet transaction arena, with its $28 million acquisition of Enterprise Integration Technologies, developer of the S-HTTP industry standard for safeguarding transactions over the World Wide Web. Verifone followed that acquisition with a $4 million investment in William Melton's latest venture, <b>CyberCash</b> Inc., also working to develop Internet transaction systems.|$|E
50|$|Wells Fargo & Company's major subsidiary, Wells Fargo Bank, {{was still}} loaded with debt, {{including}} relatively risky real estate loans, {{in the late}} 1980s. However, the bank had greatly improved its loan-loss ratio since the early 1980s. Furthermore, Wells continued to improve its health and to thrive during the early 1990s {{under the direction of}} Reichardt and Hazen. Much of that growth was attributable to gains in the California market. Indeed, despite an ailing regional economy during the early 1990s, Wells Fargo posted healthy gains in that core market. Wells slashed its labor force—by more than 500 workers in 1993 alone—and boosted cash flow with technical innovations. The bank began selling stamps through its automated teller machines (ATMs), for example, and in 1995 was partnering with <b>CyberCash,</b> Inc., a software startup company, to begin offering its services over the Internet.|$|E
5000|$|The sudden {{growth of}} the Internet, and {{especially}} the World Wide Web, in the mid-1990s created a demand for secure online financial transaction applications. Verifone has {{taken the lead in}} designing applications conforming to the Secure Electronic Transaction (SET) standards developed by Visa Inc. and MasterCard. With the $28 million 1995 acquisition of Enterprise Integration Technologies, the company that developed the Secure HyperText Transfer Protocol(S-HTTP), and a $4 million equity investment in <b>CyberCash,</b> Inc., led by Verifone founder William Melton, and with 1996 partnership agreements with Internet browser leaders Netscape, Oracle Corporation, and Microsoft, Verifone has rolled out a suite of software products targeted at consumers, merchants, and financial institutions allowing secure purchases and other transactions online. Purchases over the Internet, which still produced as little as $10 million in 1995, are expected to reach into the billions {{by the turn of the}} century. Verifone has also been working to marry the smart card to the Internet; in 1996, the company introduced the Personal ATM (P-ATM), a small smart card reader designed to be attached to the consumer's home computer, which will enable the consumer not only to make purchases over the Internet, but also to [...] "recharge" [...] the value on the card. Verifone has also partnered with Key Tronic to incorporate a P-ATM interface directly into that company's computer keyboards.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{e-commerce}} {{has become}} a routine part of human life because it offers major advantages: convenience (it’s no longer necessary to visit a store {{to be able to}} shop), efficiency (the buyer can visit several virtual shops in a very short time, the crowd of shops and the frustration caused by the lack of parking spaces available can be avoided, the customer can choose and compare the desired products taking in consideration a set of characteristics such as price, grammage, color, delivery dat, etc.) and the development of secure solutions for online payment (through: bank cards, ePay, <b>cybercash,</b> SmartCard, electronic funds transfer, Ecash). In the last decade, the electronic payment systems have been improved, reaching high levels of security and speed, acquiring a private, confidential, decentralization and internationalization character...|$|E
40|$|What {{implications}} do 21 st century monetary innovations bring for {{holdings of}} {{central bank money}} and standards of value? Emerging technologies such as <b>cybercash,</b> e-cash, and smart cards {{can be expected to}} reduce demand for central bank money, but the theoretical framework for monetary policy has not changed. The authors stress three points in this paper: 1) money innovations tend to reduce the demand for central bank money, but {{it remains to be seen}} whether the predictability of that demand, and thus the reliability of monetary policy, will decline in the coming century; 2) in principle, monetary authorities can continue to determine the price level as long as final settlement of tax and other obligations takes place using central bank liabilities; and 3) the viability of competing currencies and standards of value is gaining steam as a lively field of research.

40|$|A secure Electronic Payment System (EPS) is {{essential}} for the booming online shop-ping market. A successful EPS supports the transfer of electronic money and sensitive information with security, accuracy, and integrity between seller and buyer over the Internet. SET, <b>CyberCash,</b> Paypal and iKP are the most popular Credit Card-Based EPSs (CCBEPSs). Some CCBEPSs only use SSL to provide a secure communication channel. Hence they only prevent the "Man in the Middle" fraud but do not protect the sensitive cardholder information such as credit card number to be passed to the mer-chant, who may be unscrupulous. Other CCBEPSs use complex mechanisms such as cryptography, certificate authorities, etc. to fulfill the security schemes but factors such as ease of use for the cardholder and the implementation costs for each party are fre-quently overlooked. In this paper, we propose a Web service based new payment sys-tem, based on ANSI X 9. 59 - 2006 with extra features added on top of this standard. X 9. 59 is an Account Based Digital Signature (ABDS) and consumer-oriented payment system. It utilizes the existing financial network and financial messages to complete the payment process. However, {{there are a number of}} limitations in this standard. This research provides a solution to solve the X 9. 59 limitations by adding a merchant au-thentication feature during the payment cycle without any addenda records to be added in the existing financial messages. We have conducted performance testing on the proposed system via a comparison with SET and X 9. 59 using simulation to analyze their levels of performance and security...|$|E
40|$|Security {{protocols}} involve {{an exchange}} of messages {{in order to achieve}} a goal such as authentication of a user or secrecy of a session key. Many established protocols {{have been found to be}} flawed using protocol analysis techniques. In this thesis we will be extending current CSP-based protocol modelling techniques.;Recent techniques for analyzing security protocols have tended to concentrate upon the small protocols that are typically found in the academic literature. However, there is a huge gulf between these and most large commercial protocols. As a result, existing techniques are difficult to apply directly to these large protocols.;In this thesis we develop the notion of safe simplifying transformations: transformations that have the property of preserving insecurities; the effect of such transformations is that if we can verify the transformed protocol, then we will have verified the original protocol. We identify a number of safe simplifying transformations, and use them in the analysis of two commercial protocols, the <b>CyberCash</b> Main Sequence protocol and SET.;We extend the CSP-based analysis technique to model the property of non-repudiation and give a formal generalized definition. Our definition of non-repudiation is tested against our two case studies.;Another property we model is that of key compromise: the reuse of a compromised session key that might lead to an authentication or secrecy attack. We look at how to model the intruder learning the value of a key and then using it in an attack. We apply this technique to our case studies, looking for key compromise attacks using the session keys...|$|E
40|$|With {{the year}} 2000 rapidly approaching, stored-value cards are already popular in some {{countries}} and are being introduced into the United States by private companies. Stored-value cards are one form of electronic cash—electronic substitutes for paper currency. Digital cash (also known as <b>cybercash</b> or ecash) is the other form of electronic cash coming into use today. It consists of bits and bytes in cyberspace and substitutes for paper currency in transactions made over the Internet. > Someday privately issued electronic cash may be a common means of payment in the United States. Looking forward to that day, government policymakers need {{to assess the impact}} these new forms of currency might ultimately have on the nation’s currency stock. If privately issued electronic cash, once commonplace, could threaten the long-standing safety, uniformity, and relative stability of the U. S. currency, then policy-makers must decide what, if any, forms of government intervention are appropriate. > Schreft argues there is a limited role for government in ensuring the quality of the nation’s currency when private issuance is allowed. She first describes the emerging forms of electronic cash and how they differ from today’s paper currency. She goes on to argue that the concern for policymakers is not that electronic cash is electronic, but rather that private firms are issuing it. Looking forward from the perspectives of economic theory and economic history, she explores the impact privately issued electronic cash might have on the nation’s currency and the potential role for government. Finally, she considers some specific regulatory alternatives for ensuring that the U. S. currency remains stable, safe, and uniform. Payment systems; Electronic funds transfers...|$|E
40|$|The unparalleled {{success of}} the Internet has led to much debate about its ability to {{securely}} handle financial transactions. Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) is currently the de facto standard for the exchange of trade data, but the interest in the Internet amongst private users and business has made this a potentially very powerful and perhaps lucrative medium for conducting commerce. However, there is no widely adopted payment system that fulfils {{the needs of all}} interested parties. This report looks into electronic commerce and evaluates payment systems that are being developed for open networks, mostly focusing on the Internet. This report identifies key requirements that successful use for the Internet must impose on payment mechanisms. The payment systems can be classified as token, credit/debit or cash-based systems, examples of which are DigiCash, <b>CyberCash</b> and Mondex. Each system is evaluated in-depth against a general set of requirements which include security, global acceptance and ease of use and also against 3 hypothetical scenarios to obtain system strengths and weaknesses. DigiCash is best but this is attributed to omissions in functionality and use by competing systems rather than the strength of the DigiCash system itself. The text highlights the ways in which electronic commerce can be used and illustrates what the features of the main systems are. For this reason it should be read by researchers and I. T. enthusiasts interested in the implications and expectations of this area and also by merchants looking to experiment with selling goods and services over open networks. The report systematically shows, for example, why a merchant should choose one system over another. The conclusion to this report details improvements that need to be made to allow electronic commerce to flourish. A major issue is the inability of Internet protocols to offer service guarantees. Other issues include the need to have open standards to allow interoperability and the need for future software to embrace future needs such as interactive product specifications...|$|E
