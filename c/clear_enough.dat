5|$|Once {{out of the}} village, NY17A and NY94 {{begin to}} climb again, this time {{offering}} some panoramic views to the north, {{all the way to}} the Shawangunk Ridge and even the Catskill Mountains beyond them in <b>clear</b> <b>enough</b> weather. The road is surprisingly little developed in this area, with only one gas station between Florida and Warwick, its next stop, which likewise presents itself after a descent. Again, NY17A and NY94 serve as the bustling village's main street, longer this time and with many upscale boutiques in evidence. Many historic buildings line the road through Warwick. Near the southern end of the village, the two roads split, with NY94 continuing toward New Jersey while NY17A goes eastward.|$|E
25|$|Early {{results of}} the {{observations}} show that the comet is powered by dry ice, not water vapor as was previously thought.The images were <b>clear</b> <b>enough</b> for scientists to link jets of dust and gas with specific surface features.|$|E
50|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century, the land was <b>cleared</b> <b>enough</b> to allow for {{construction}} of permanent hunting lodges. From there land was eventually secured by private owners and turned into seasonal cottage grounds. Shipwreck enthusiasts, lured by the Etta and Eclipse disaster, have turned the small camping area into a tourist destination.|$|R
50|$|With Camp Mitchell in Force Protection Condition Delta for {{the first}} time since the Gulf War, THREE {{deployed}} an Air Detachment in December 2001 to support Operation Enduring Freedom by constructing 130 Al Qaeda detention cells at Camp X-ray. The Det also constructed 65 SEAhuts for JTF 160 security forces and <b>cleared</b> <b>enough</b> land to construct a 160-bed Fleet Hospital.|$|R

25|$|Kildall {{obtained}} {{a copy of}} PCDOS, examined it, and concluded that it infringed on CP/M. When he asked Gerry Davis what legal options were available, Davis told him that intellectual property law for software was not <b>clear</b> <b>enough</b> to sue.|$|E
25|$|The prairie around Malpensa was a moorland {{covered with}} heather, bushes and small trees, {{and it was}} not <b>clear</b> <b>enough</b> to allow an {{aircraft}} to take off and land. The nearest surface sufficiently clear and level was close to Gallarate. The Ca.1 had to be towed there by a donkey, the trip taking around 30 minutes.|$|E
25|$|For today's botanists, Ellis Rowan’s {{painting}} {{has limited}} scientific research value {{because they are}} lacking the critical details that {{is necessary for the}} botanical illustrations. However, these flora drawings are accurate and <b>clear</b> <b>enough</b> to help people identify most of the plants she drew. Although Ellis confessed that she knew very little about plants, she maintained her passion and love to discovering the botanical world, dried many specimens as her collections.|$|E
50|$|However, {{the weather}} soon <b>cleared</b> <b>enough</b> to permit {{air strikes against}} Japanese {{shipping}} and targets on the coasts of China and French Indochina. Through holes in the thick overcast, American carrier planes bombed Japanese shipping at Takao, Amoy, and Swatow on 15 January and at Hainan Island, Indochina, and Hong Kong on 16 January. Fueling operations for the task group, hampered by the generally bad weather that had prevailed during the period, were finally completed on 19 January, shortly before the ships transited the Balintang Channel.|$|R
50|$|The first English-speaking settler was Thomas Powel {{who arrived}} in 1790, there was {{considerable}} colonization by English shipbuilders, Scottish merchants and Irish immigrants followed including many Irish Protestants who arrived {{to work in the}} Jardine Shipbuilding Yards around the year 1819 and they eventually <b>cleared</b> <b>enough</b> land to receive land grants following the 1820s survey by a Mr. Layton conducted around the Molus River area of nearby Weldford Parish, New Brunswick and the size of Elsipogtog First Nation was reduced to the current boundaries.|$|R
50|$|Over the years, {{roads were}} {{improved}} and more land was cleared, but the farms never materialized. Each settler {{had been given}} 35 acre of land but they only <b>cleared</b> <b>enough</b> land to meet their immediate requirements. It wasn’t long before {{many of the men}} were seeking employment elsewhere, such as the American base: Ernest Harmon Air Force Base in Stephenville and with the Pulp and Paper Industry in Corner Brook. Several of the original settlers even returned to their home towns, preferring the uncertainty of fishing to the drudgery of farming.|$|R
25|$|The {{devastation of}} Camille {{inspired}} {{the implementation of}} the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. After the storm, many Gulf Coast residents commented that hurricane warnings were not <b>clear</b> <b>enough</b> in conveying the expected intensity of the coming storm. The Saffir-Simpson scale offered a much more concise statement of storm intensity than barometric pressure and wind-speed measurements, and veterans of previous hurricanes could analogize the power of the approaching storm to those they had experienced.|$|E
25|$|North of here, {{even better}} {{views of the}} Shawangunks open up with the {{observation}} tower at Mohonk Mountain House becoming prominent to the west. The Devil's Path in the Greene County Catskills appears to the north on <b>clear</b> <b>enough</b> days. Some vineyards join the orchards along the road, reflecting a developing local wine industry. The campus of SUNY New Paltz starts to form a distinct skyline to the north, and to the east the ridgeline of Illinois Mountain complements the Shawangunks.|$|E
25|$|Peace was remanded for a week, {{in which}} he refused to give his name. But in captivity, {{he wrote a letter}} to a {{business}} colleague who decided to co-operate with police, and revealed its author as Peace, writing under his pseudonym John Ward. Under that name, he was tried at the Old Bailey for burglary and the attempted murder of PC Robinson. The evidence against the prisoner was <b>clear</b> <b>enough,</b> and he was sentenced by Mr. Justice Hawkins to penal servitude for life.|$|E
2500|$|In 1911, Buckner {{brought his}} wife and three sons to the farm (also call the “Buckner ranch”). Upon arrival, the family found most of the land covered with stumps because the timber had been cut and sold by the {{previous}} owner. [...] Over the next several years, the family <b>cleared</b> <b>enough</b> stumps to plant a [...] apple orchard. [...] The Buckners also designed an irrigation system that diverted water from Rainbow Creek to their orchard. [...] The main irrigation canal and watering ditches, totaling over four miles (6km), were all dug by hand during the summer of 1911.|$|R
5000|$|The HERO units also {{oversee the}} TRIP program which now {{requires}} an accident to be <b>cleared</b> <b>enough</b> to have traffic significantly improved in 90 {{minutes from the}} time that the towing company arrives on scene and is given notice to proceed. (must be on scene in 30 (peak) to 45 (non-peak) minutes or less) [...] Most towing companies pass this requirement because of assistance from GDOT in getting to the scene. Towing companies in the TRIP program must meet a minimum set of standards and pass inspections by GDOT. The approved equipment is issued a TRIP certification sticker.|$|R
50|$|On March 22, 2014, a three-mile {{section of}} SR 530 in {{northern}} Snohomish County, roughly midway between Darrington and Arlington, was completely {{blocked by the}} Oso landslide. The highway was <b>cleared</b> <b>enough</b> by May 31 to open one lane of escorted traffic. Because the highway was badly damaged, and because the topography of the area had been altered by the landslide, WSDOT decided to elevate that section of the highway when it was rebuilt. , {{the first of four}} stages in rebuilding the highway had been completed. The new roadway was opened September 22, and the project is expected to be finished in early October 2014.|$|R
25|$|In 2016, the German Defence Ministry {{lost its}} lawsuit filed against Heckler & Koch on the ministry's claim for {{compensation}} or warranty work on the subpar G36 rifles, because the Bundeswehr did not make its specifications for the weapon <b>clear</b> <b>enough</b> {{in the beginning of}} the procurement process. The District Court of Koblenz rejected claims from the Bundeswehr procurement office, and ruled that weapon manufacturer Heckler & Koch did not have to pay damages on the 167,000 rifles still in use out of more than 176,000 G36 rifles Germany had originally purchased.|$|E
25|$|Definite loss: The loss {{takes place}} at a known time, in a known place, and from a known cause. The classic example is death of an insured person on a life {{insurance}} policy. Fire, automobile accidents, and worker injuries may all easily meet this criterion. Other types of losses may only be definite in theory. Occupational disease, for instance, may involve prolonged exposure to injurious conditions where no specific time, place, or cause is identifiable. Ideally, the time, place, and cause of a loss should be <b>clear</b> <b>enough</b> that a reasonable person, with sufficient information, could objectively verify all three elements.|$|E
25|$|On 20 August 1998, the Supreme Court answered, {{concluding}} that Quebec {{does not have}} the right to secede unilaterally under Canadian or international law. However, the federal government would have to enter into negotiations with the Quebec government if Quebecers expressed a clear will to secede. It confirmed that the Canadian Parliament had the power to determine whether or not a referendum question was <b>clear</b> <b>enough</b> to trigger such negotiations. The Canadian constitution would remain in effect until terms of secession were agreed to by all parties involved, and these terms would have to respect principles of democracy, minority and individual rights as outlined in the Canadian constitution.|$|E
50|$|On September 23, 1950, several muskeg {{fires that}} had been {{smoldering}} for several years in Alberta, Canada, suddenly blew up into major—and very smoky—fires. Winds carried the smoke eastward and southward with unusual speed, and {{the conditions of the}} fire produced large quantities of oily droplets of just the right size (about 1 micrometre in diameter) to scatter red and yellow light. Wherever the smoke <b>cleared</b> <b>enough</b> so that the sun was visible, it was lavender or blue. Ontario, Canada, and much of the east coast of the United States were affected by the following day, and two days later, observers in Britain reported an indigo sun in smoke-dimmed skies, followed by an equally blue moon that evening.|$|R
50|$|In 1894, Fraser left Victoria for {{the remote}} fishing village of Ucluelet {{where he had}} bought 236 acre for $236 two years before. At that time the village was only {{accessible}} by sea. Singlehandedly, he <b>cleared</b> <b>enough</b> of his land to establish his nursery. Hybridizing was his passion and this he did with honeysuckle, gooseberries, cranberries, roses and many more besides. His technique was to use the wild form of the plant and cross it with a domesticated version. His renown among hybridizers, however, was in producing rhododendrons crosses. His work was recognised internationally and recorded in the Gardener's Chronicle of London. Plant explorers and botonists corresponded with him, as did The Royal Botanic Garden, Kew and the Arnold Arboretum, Boston.|$|R
50|$|State Route 530 was indefinitely closed {{after the}} slide by the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT), with an {{alternative}} local route opened the following week after snow was cleared from the unpaved portion of Mountain Loop Highway south of Darrington. The highway was <b>cleared</b> <b>enough</b> by May 31 to open one lane of escorted traffic. Because the highway was badly damaged, and because the topography of the area had been altered by the landslide, WSDOT decided to elevate that section of the highway when it was rebuilt. As of July 27, {{the first of four}} stages in rebuilding the highway had been completed. The new roadway was opened September 22, and the project was expected to be finished in early October 2014.|$|R
25|$|The army {{maintained}} posts at Fort Vancouver, the Cascades, and The Dalles. In late 1855 orders {{arrived to}} move the army's main base up from the Cascades to the Dalles, closer to the anticipated area of war operations in the next campaign season. Movement on the river was completely halted by the severe winter in January 1856, when the Columbia froze from bank to bank from the Gorge on down well below {{the mouth of the}} Willamette. No river traffic moved anywhere on the river, even down to Astoria, Oregon. When the river was finally <b>clear</b> <b>enough</b> of ice, Belle and another boat, the Fashion started moving the Army's equipment up from Fort Vancouver.|$|E
25|$|Kant {{cautions}} that we cannot feel or intuit {{this world of}} the understanding. He also stresses that {{we are unable to}} make interesting positive claims about it because we are not able to experience the world of the understanding. Kant argues that we cannot use the notion of the world of the understanding to explain how freedom is possible or how pure reason could {{have anything to say about}} practical matters because we simply do not and cannot have a <b>clear</b> <b>enough</b> grasp of the world of the understanding. The notion of an intelligible world does point us towards the idea of a kingdom of ends, which is a useful and important idea. We just have to be careful not to get carried away and make claims that we are not entitled to.|$|E
25|$|Both pro- and anti-whaling {{countries}} {{claim that}} their recruiting activities {{are restricted to}} lobbying and persuasion based {{on the merits of}} their cause. Anti-whaling campaigners argue that scientific studies are not currently <b>clear</b> <b>enough</b> to warrant resumption of commercial whaling. Moreover, there are various other issues such as welfare of whales which is beyond the simple matter of conservation. (See The arguments for and against whaling) These issues have global relevance which is not restricted only to whaling and whaling countries. Moreover, public opinion in many anti-whaling countries is solidly behind the governmental position on whaling within the IWC. Pro-whaling countries, on the other hand, argue that the public's anti-whaling stance is often based on misinformation – a 2003 article in The Economist noted that surveys in Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States had found that a majority of respondents incorrectly believe that all whale species are endangered.|$|E
50|$|The smoke <b>cleared</b> <b>enough</b> for Simeral to {{pull the}} B-29 out of a dive at 300 ft above the water and turn toward Iwo Jima, where Erwin could be given {{emergency}} treatment. His crew members extinguished his burning clothes and administered first aid, but whenever Erwin's burns were uncovered, phosphorus embedded in his skin would begin to smolder; white phosphorus is known to cause to extremely terrible wounds, as the burning chemical cannot be extinguished if oxygen is present, {{and will continue to}} burn through flesh until it consumes itself or is extracted. It is also toxic. Although in excruciating pain, he remained conscious throughout the flight and spoke only to inquire about the safety of the crew. Once at Iwo Jima, medical personnel didn't believe he would survive.|$|R
500|$|Fog {{cancelled}} Indefatigables flying {{operations on}} 23 August, including a planned diversionary attack against German shipping in Langfjord. The other two carriers and their escorts rejoined Moore and Indefatigable off Norway {{during the morning}} of 24 August. While conditions that day were initially foggy, the weather <b>cleared</b> <b>enough</b> in the afternoon to permit a strike against Kaafjord. The attacking force comprised 33 Barracudas carrying [...] armour-piecing bombs, 24 Corsairs (including 5 armed with a 1,000-pound [...] bomb), 10 Hellcats, 10 Fireflies and 8 Seafires. In an attempt to achieve surprise, the aircraft flew off from the carriers from a point further {{to the south of}} those used in previous raids. The strike aircraft then flew parallel to the coast, before making landfall and approaching Kaafjord from the south. A German radar station detected the force at 3:41 pm, and immediately alerted Tirpitz.|$|R

25|$|The main {{contention}} of Anderson's appeal {{is that a}} secret, illegally recorded tape of him discussing Bonds' steroid use {{was the basis for}} the grand jury questions he refused to answer. Prosecutors, however, said the tape was legal and was made in a face-to-face meeting with Anderson. Although Judge Alsup dismissed Anderson's tape claim and others, the 9th Circuit Court sent Anderson's appeal back to the judge, saying Alsup's ruling regarding the tape was not <b>clear</b> <b>enough.</b> In clarifying his order, Alsup said he agreed with prosecutors that there was ample evidence beyond the tape to question Anderson. Prosecutors also said the questions they wanted answered were based on athletes' secret testimony in the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative case and a search of Anderson's house that turned up drug records, some with Bonds' name on it. Other than the tape dispute, the 9th Circuit Court had rejected the merits of Anderson's appeal.|$|E
25|$|In the 21st century, {{major changes}} to the ice pack due to climate change have stirred {{speculation}} that the passage may become <b>clear</b> <b>enough</b> of ice to permit safe commercial shipping for {{at least part of}} the year. On August 21, 2007, the Northwest Passage became open to ships without the need of an icebreaker. According to Nalan Koc of the Norwegian Polar Institute, this was the first time the Passage has been clear since they began keeping records in 1972. The Northwest Passage opened again on August 25, 2008. However, drifting chunks of ice, especially in springtime, remain problematic as they can clog straits or severely damage a ship's hull. Cargo's routes may therefore be slower and uncertain, depending on conditions. Because most of the containerized traffic operates in a just-in-time mode, which does not tolerate delays well, and the relative isolation of the passage (which impedes shipping companies from optimizing their operations by grouping multiple stopovers on a same itinerary), the NWP and other Arctic routes are not usually seen as promising shipping lanes.|$|E
25|$|Cameron's {{choice of}} cinematographer {{on the movie}} was Mikael Salomon – a US-based Danish {{national}} who {{would go on to}} work on other blockbusters such as Backdraft and Arachnophobia before moving into the director's slot on a myriad of films and TV shows including two editions of the acclaimed HBO WW2 series Band of Brothers. Salomon used three cameras in watertight housings that were specially designed. Another special housing was designed for scenes that went from above-water dialogue to below-water dialogue. The filmmakers had {{to figure out how to}} keep the water <b>clear</b> <b>enough</b> to shoot and dark enough to look realistic at 2,000 feet (700 m), which was achieved by floating a thick layer of plastic beads in the water and covering the top of the tank with an enormous tarpaulin. Cameron wanted to see the actors' faces and hear their dialogue, and thus hired Western Space and Marine to engineer helmets which would remain optically clear underwater and installed state-of-the-art aircraft quality microphones into each helmet. Safety conditions were also a major factor with the installation of a decompression chamber on site, along with a diving bell and a safety diver for each actor.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} day, Grande Island {{was taken}} and Navy minesweepers began clearing the bay. Engineers of the 38th Division remained in Olongapo to begin reactivation of Subic Bay Naval Station. Bridges, {{buildings and the}} water distilling plant were repaired and the beaches and streets were <b>cleared.</b> Soon <b>enough,</b> LSTs were making dry-ramp landings {{near the town of}} Subic.|$|R
50|$|Ultimate Block Party (titled Kollon (ころん) in Japan, Koloomn in Europe) is {{a puzzle}} game series where blocks must be cleared. Every so often new rows of blocks will push up the current ones. Not <b>clearing</b> <b>enough</b> within a set time limit will force the {{blocks to the}} top of the screen, where the player will lose. Blocks can be cleared if at least four blocks of the same color are touching. The speed of new rows will {{increase}} as the game is played longer. The blocks which get cleared will result in the blocks above falling down. The game offers several different modes including a multiplayer and arcade mode. Games in the franchise have been released for the arcade, PSP, and mobile phone (EZweb, Yahoo! Keitai (Yahoo!ケータイ)). A second PSP Kollon game, titled Korokoro Kollon (コロコロころん) was released in Japan on June 22, 2006.|$|R
