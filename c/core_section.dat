5|$|The IND Queens Boulevard Line, {{sometimes}} abbreviated as QBL, {{is a line}} of the B Division of the New York City Subway in Manhattan and Queens, New York City, United States. The line, {{which is}} underground throughout its entire route, contains 23 stations. The <b>core</b> <b>section</b> between 50th Street in Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan, and 169th Street in Jamaica, Queens, was built by the Independent Subway System (IND) in stages between 1933 and 1940, with the Jamaica–179th Street terminus opening in 1950. , it is among the system's busiest lines, with a weekday ridership of over 460,000 people.|$|E
5|$|With {{the onset}} of the Great Recession in 2008–2009, this narrowly-defined demographic-based sales plan faltered and sales and profits for the chain declined; Burger King's same-store {{comparable}} sales in the United States and Canada declined 4.6% in the three months ended September 30, while McDonald's posted same-store comparable sales growth of 2.5% within the United States. The Stacker line underwent a minor reformulation in 2011 that involved deleting the top layer of cheese and changing the amount of bacon in the sandwiches, and moving the sandwiches from the <b>core</b> <b>section</b> of its menu to the company's value menu. The changed ingredient list and pricing structure created a situation such that the distribution of ingredients did not scale {{at the same rate as}} increasing numbers of burger patties. Consumer Reports' blog The Consumerist noted that two single Stackers at $1.00 included more cheese and more bacon than one double Stacker for $2.00. Three single Stackers had 50% more cheese and double the bacon of one triple Stacker. The Stacker line and other related calorie-heavy menu items were dropped in 2012 when 3G Capital of Brazil bought the company and initiated a menu restructuring focusing on a broader demographic base.|$|E

40|$|Molybdenum and {{vanadium}} were analysed in 9 scediment cores {{recovered from}} the continental slope and rise off NW Africa. Additionall chemical and sedimentological parameters as well as isotope stage boundaries were available for the same core profiles from other investigations. Molybdenum, ranging between < 1 and 10 ppm, occurs in two associateions, either with organic carbon and sulphides in sediments with reducing conditions or with Mn oxides in oxidized near-surface <b>core</b> <b>sections.</b> Highest values (between 4 and 10 ppm Mo) are found in sulphide-rich <b>core</b> <b>sections</b> deposited during glacial times in a core from 200 m water depth. The possibility of anoxic near-bottom water conditions prevailing at thhis site during certain glacial intervals is discussed. In oxidized near-surface <b>core</b> <b>sections,</b> the diagenetic mobility of Mo becomes evident from strong Mo enrichment together with Mn oxides (values up to 4 ppm Mo). This enrichment is probably due to coprecipitation and/or adsorption of Mo from interstitial water to the diagenetically forming Mn oxides. The close relation between Mo and Corg results in strongly covarying sedimentation rates in both components reaching up to 10 times the rates in glacial compared to interglacial <b>core</b> <b>sections.</b> Vanadium (values between 20 and 100 ppm) does not show clear relations to climate and near-bottom or sediment milieu. It occurs mainly bound to the fine grained terrigenous fraction, associated with aluminium silicates (clay minerals) and iron oxides. Additionally positive covariation of vanadium with phosphorus in most core profiles suggest that some V may be bound to phosphates...|$|R
