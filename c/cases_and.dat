5|$|Breast {{cancer is}} the secondest common {{cancer in the world}} and the commonest amongst women, as well as being amongst the ten commonest chronic {{diseases}} of women, and a substantial contributor to loss of quality of life (Gronowski and Schindler, Table IV). Globally, it accounts for 25% of all cancers. In 2016, breast {{cancer is the}} commonest cancer diagnosed amongst women in both developed and developing countries, accounting for nearly 30% of all <b>cases,</b> <b>and</b> worldwide accounts for one and a half million <b>cases</b> <b>and</b> over half a million deaths, being the fifth commonest cause of cancer death overall and the second in developed regions. Geographic variation in incidence is the opposite of that of cervical cancer, being highest in Northern America and lowest in Eastern and Middle Africa, but mortality rates are relatively constant, resulting in a wide variance in case mortality, ranging from 25% in developed regions to 37% in developing regions, and with 62% of deaths occurring in developing countries.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the overall}} {{positive}} reception, some reviewers {{thought that the}} game had too many redundancies in the <b>cases</b> <b>and</b> left too little control to the player, leading to the game being boring at times.

40|$|The author had {{previously}} considered the {{appropriate use of}} error term in the two-factor experimental design. In the present article, the author has considered the three-factor experimental design with repeated measures on one factor. Having decided, for example, that the repeated factor is Factor C, and the non-repeated factors are Factor A and Factor B, there are six cases which are described as follows: Case 1 : Factor A, Factor B, and Factor C are all fixed. Case 2 : Factor A and Factor B are both fixed, but Factor C is random. Case 3 : Factor A is random, but Factor B and Factor C are both fixed. Case 4 : Factor A and Factor C are both random, but Factor B is fixed. Case 5 : Factor A and Factor B are both random, but Factor C is fixed. Case 6 : Factor A, Factor B, and Factor C are all random. To test {{the significance of the}} main effect of Factor A, MSerror(b) is used as denominator of F ratio in <b>Case</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Case</b> 3; MSab in <b>Case</b> 5; <b>and</b> quasi-F ratio, F 1 ´ is used in <b>Case</b> 2 <b>and</b> <b>Case</b> 4, <b>and</b> F 6 ´ in Case 6. To test the significance of Factor B, MSerror(b) is used in Case 1; MSab in <b>Case</b> 3 <b>and</b> <b>Case</b> 5; <b>and</b> quasi-F ratio, F 2 ´ is used in <b>Case</b> 2, <b>and</b> F 4 ´ in <b>Case</b> 4 <b>and</b> <b>Case</b> 6. To test the significance of the interaction effect of Factor A and Factor B, MSerror(b) is used in Case 1, <b>Case</b> 3, <b>and</b> <b>Case</b> 5; <b>and</b> quasi-F ratio, F 3 ´ is used in Case 2, <b>Case</b> 4, <b>and</b> <b>Case</b> 6. To test the significance of Factor C, MSerror(w) is used in <b>Case</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Case</b> 2; MSac in <b>Case</b> 3 <b>and</b> <b>Case</b> 4; <b>and</b> quasi-F ratio, F 5 ´ isused in <b>Case</b> 5 <b>and</b> <b>Case</b> 6.

40|$|AbstractThe paper proposes two {{new methods}} for {{analyzing}} <b>case</b> <b>and</b> adposition meaning. The method for analyzing <b>case</b> <b>and</b> adposition semantics {{is based on}} an analysis of semes (semantic components) as arguments and predicates in a higher-order logic. The method for <b>case</b> <b>and</b> adposition pragmatics {{is based on an}} analysis of <b>case</b> <b>and</b> adposition functions as a series of functional derivations. The methods are complementary, cross-linguistically universal and allow for cross-category generalizations. A thorough discussion of the methods (including comparisons with earlier ones), formal definitions of case/adposition meanings and a variety of examples are provided...|$|R
