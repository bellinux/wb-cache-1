[...] A car chase scene set {{along the banks of the}} Tiber River and through the streets of Rome featured an Aston Martin DB10 and a Jaguar C-X75. The C-X75 was originally developed as a hybrid electric vehicle with four independent electric engines powered by two jet turbines, before the project was cancelled. The version used for filming was converted to use a conventional internal combustion engine, to minimise the potential for disruption from mechanical problems with the complex hybrid system. The C-X75s used for filming were developed by the engineering division of Formula One racing team Williams, who built the original C-X75 prototype for Jaguar. Remote driving pods were built above the cars so the vehicles could be driven while the cameras focused on Craig and Bautista in the steering wheel. According to chief stunt co-ordinator Gary Powell, filming the chase had the [...] "risk of skidding into the Vatican", and led to [...] "a record for smashing up cars in Spectre – seven Aston Martins in all,” with the film's <b>car</b> <b>expenses</b> estimated at £24 million ($48 million).|$|E

50|$|Many talented {{players were}} raised and trained in Cuba and then {{recruited}} {{to the major}} leagues in the United States. Some of the more famous modern players are José Contreras, Orlando Hernández, and Liván Hernández. These players make very good money for their talents, {{but this was not}} always the case. From the 1930s through the 1950s many American scouts went to Cuba to find inexpensive recruits. During this time period many talented Cuban players were recruited, signed contracts and were locked into little or no money. In 1961, due to severed diplomatic relations with Cuba, one of the major league's main sources of foreign players was cut off. This has limited the amount of Cuban players migrating to the United States to play baseball. The US major league baseball clubs are in hopes that in the near future {{they will be able to}} recruit players from Cuba again. This can and will deeply affect baseball as it is played in Cuba today. In the United States, Cuban players such as Liván Hernández can make million dollar salaries, while players in Cuba will make less than thirty dollars a month. Cuba cannot compete with major league wages and this already has shown an impact. Although salaries are the same for all of the Cuban baseball players, some of the best Cuban players can get perks or gifts from the Cuban government. These can be anything from a vacation, to a <b>car,</b> unlimited <b>expense</b> accounts at restaurants, or something as small as movie tickets. The problem with these gifts is that they are very unpredictable and players often complain about the gifts. Cuba has lost many talented players since the 1990s due to defection because the money can be very good.|$|R

Most car ownership and active transportation research focuses on urban areas. However, much of the United States remains rural, and different factors may impact car ownership in less-densely populated areas. This research examines car ownership trends in rural counties to identify communities with lower than expected rates of car ownership considering demographic factors. 2, 285 counties in the continental United States were identified as rural according to guidelines found in the Agriculture Act of 2014. These counties were grouped into five regions based on U. S. Census Bureau definitions. To identify counties of interest, an Ordinary Least Squares regression was created for each region that incorporated data from the 1990 Decennial Census and 2014 5 -year American Community Survey. Two counties from each region were selected and studied for policies that may be correlated with car ownership rates: a county with a lower-than-expected car ownership rate change and a county with a typical car ownership rate change {{to serve as a}} control.

With cloud computing there are three types of service models: platform as a service, software as a service and infrastructure as a service. There are three types of cloud systems, namely the public cloud, private cloud and hybrid cloud. Each type of cloud has its own advantages and disadvantages. The core of thesis include a description of the process of developing cloud application AvtoUtil, which was developed in technology ". NET". We have seen the tools, needed to design and manufacture the cloud application. In the section that {{describes the}} test, we show a typical test procedure of developed application. AvtoUtil is an application that allows the user to insert the datas of his car, <b>car</b> problems and <b>expenses.</b> The total cost overview and statistics of vehicles is intended for the user, but they may be shared with other users. Application itself is divided into three user groups. Each user group can have different access rights and features. The application was developed using the development tools in Visual Studio 2010 programming language C#. There are many providers of cloud services. We briefly describe four products of different vendors (Amazon, Google, Rackspace and Microsoft). We opted for Azure because it allows to run applications that are written using the ".
