60|$|Mary's {{note was}} in pencil, {{scribbled}} hastily. I was to wait after eleven that night near the great rose bushes behind the pavilion. Long before eleven I was there, on {{a seat in}} a thick shadow looking across great lakes of moonlight towards the phantom statuary of the Italianate garden and the dark laurels that partly masked the house. I waited nearly an hour, an hour of stillness and small creepings and <b>cheepings</b> and goings to and fro among the branches.|$|R
6000|$|Across {{the pathway}} was a thick scrub oak, under which I {{sat down to}} watch. Ten long minutes passed, with nothing stirring, before Mother Grouse came {{stealing}} back. She clucked once--"Careful!" [...] it seemed to say; and not a leaf stirred. She clucked again--did the ground open? There they were, {{a dozen or more}} of them, springing up from nowhere and scurrying with a thousand <b>cheepings</b> to tell her all about it. So she gathered them all close about her, and they vanished into the friendly shadows.|$|R
60|$|Belturbet saw, with bulging eyes, {{a sudden}} void where a moment earlier {{had been a}} Cabinet Minister; a void {{emphasized}} rather than relieved {{by the presence of}} a puffed-out bewildered-looking sparrow, which hopped about for a moment in a dazed fashion and then fell to a violent <b>cheeping</b> and scolding.|$|E
60|$|On {{the bank}} before us lay a black cat, both hindpaws torn and bloody in a trap. It {{had no doubt}} been {{bounding}} forward after its prey when it was caught. It was gaunt and wild; no wonder it frightened the poor lap-wings into <b>cheeping</b> hysteria. It glared at us fiercely, growling low.|$|E

60|$|I {{followed}} the flock rapidly, though cautiously, through an interminable tangle of alders that bordered the little stream, and learned {{some things about}} them; though they gave me no chance whatever for a rifle shot. The mother was gone; their leader was a foxy bird, {{the smallest of the}} lot, who kept them moving in dense cover, running, crouching, hiding, inquisitive about me and watching me, yet keeping themselves beyond reach of harm. All the while the leader talked to them, a curious language of <b>cheepings</b> and whistlings; and they answered back with questions or sharp exclamations as my head appeared in sight for a moment. Where the cover was densest they waited till I was almost upon them before they whisked out of sight; and where {{there was a bit of}} opening they whirred up noisily on strong wings, or sailed swiftly away from a fallen log with the noiseless flight that a grouse knows so well how to use when the occasion comes.|$|R
6000|$|But {{the silence}} was only broken by the <b>cheeping</b> of sparrows outside the round window, {{and the sound of}} the horse, Hal, munching the last morsel of his carrot. Harbinger was aware in his every nerve of the sweetish, {{slightly}} acrid, husky odour of the loosebox, mingling with the scent of Barbara's hair and clothes. And rather miserably, he said for the third time: ...|$|E
6000|$|Gav Dishart {{was the one}} who {{had come}} by the burn, and his boots were <b>cheeping</b> like a field of mice. He gave the word [...] "Stroke," [...] and the three then looked at each other firmly. The lights of the town were not visible from the Cuttle Well, owing to an arm of cliff that is outstretched between, but the bell could be {{distinctly}} heard, and occasionally a shout of revelry.|$|E
60|$|All day my {{thoughts}} had remained on her, like bubbles in wine. All day {{hope of the}} coming night and of our expedition to the woods had been, as it were, a palace in which my girlish fancy had wandered, and now, though {{only a few minutes}} ago I had been <b>cheeping</b> my small extemporary philosophy into the ear of Dr Phelps, the fires of self-contempt and hatred burned up in me hotter than ever.|$|E
60|$|This {{afternoon}} {{it was so}} warm {{that the}} bees were all around among the blossoms, and two thrushes, who had built in a yew-tree that watched over the Scotch garden, were in a violent flutter because one of their chicks {{had fallen out of}} the nest. The mother bird, {{at the edge of the}} long orchard grass, was silent, trying by example to still the tiny creature's <b>cheeping,</b> lest it might attract some large or human thing.|$|E
6000|$|The {{wind was}} blowing cold and cuttingly from the north-west. Milton, rosy with his walk, dropped down beside the hedge of weeds {{in the sun and}} Brad climbed over the fence and joined him. It was warm and cosy there, and the crickets were <b>cheeping</b> feebly in the russet grass where the {{sunlight}} fell. The wind whistled through the weeds with a wild, mournful sound. Bradley did not speak for some time. He listened to Milton. At last he said abruptly-- ...|$|E
60|$|Soon {{his little}} gray mate {{appeared}} under the last bush, and after much circumspection came hopping towards the breakfast; and after her, {{in a long}} line, five little Killooleets, hopping, fluttering, <b>cheeping,</b> stumbling,--all in a fright at the big world, but all in a desperate hurry for crackers and porridge ad libitum; now casting hungry eyes at the plate under the old cedar, now stopping to turn their heads sidewise to see the big kind animal with only two legs, that Killooleet had told them about, no doubt, many times.|$|E
6000|$|Say, {{what is the}} spell, {{when her}} fledgelings are <b>cheeping,</b> [...] That lures the bird home to her nest? [...] Or wakes the tired mother, whose infant is weeping, [...] To cuddle and croon it to rest? [...] What the magic that charms the glad babe in her arms, [...] Till it cooes with {{the voice of the}} dove?

6000|$|... "He stays out so late—up at the Ram Inn," [...] {{whispered the}} {{mother in a}} high whisper, looking at George, [...] "and then he's up at five—he doesn't get his proper rest." [...] She turned to the chicks, and {{continued}} in her whisper—"the mother left them just before they hatched out, so we've been bringing them on here. This one's a bit weak—I thought I'd hot him up a bit" [...] she laughed with a quaint little frown of deprecation. Eight or nine yellow, fluffy little mites were <b>cheeping</b> and scuffling in the fender. Lettie bent over them to touch them; they were tame, and ran among her fingers.|$|E
6000|$|... “A fool” was Don Tarquinio’s mental comment as {{the door}} closed on Egbert’s retreat. Then he lifted his velvet forepaws {{in the air and}} leapt lightly on to a {{bookshelf}} immediately under the bullfinch’s cage. It {{was the first time he}} had seemed to notice the bird’s existence, but he was carrying out a long-formed theory of action with the precision of mature deliberation. The bullfinch, who had fancied himself something of a despot, depressed himself of a sudden into a third of his normal displacement; then he fell to a helpless wing-beating and shrill <b>cheeping.</b> He had cost twenty-seven shillings without the cage, but Lady Anne made no sign of interfering. She had been dead for two hours.|$|E
60|$|Now it {{was that}} she found the value of routine. Her days were so well and fully {{occupied}} that anxiety was forced below the surface. The nights were far more terrible; for then, not only had she to bear her own suspense, but, as was natural in a wife, the fears of Horace Pendyce as well. The poor Squire found this the only time when he could get relief from worry; he came to bed much earlier on purpose. By dint of reiterating dreads and speculation he at length obtained some rest. Why had not George answered? What was the fellow about? And so on and so on, till, by sheer monotony, he caused in himself the need for slumber. But his wife's torments lasted till after the birds, starting with a sleepy <b>cheeping,</b> were at full morning chorus. Then only, turning softly for fear she should awaken him, the poor lady fell asleep.|$|E
60|$|The tall {{meadow-sweet}} was in bud {{along the}} tiny beach {{and we walked}} knee-deep among it, watching the foamy race of the ripples and the whitening of the willows on the far shore. At the place where Nethermere narrows to the upper end, and receives the brook from Strelley, the wood sweeps down and stands with its feet washed round with waters. We broke our way along the shore, crushing the sharp-scented wild mint, whose odour checks the breath, and examining here and there among the marshy places ragged nests of water-fowl, now deserted. Some slim young lap-wings started at our approach, and sped lightly from us, their necks outstretched in straining fear of that which could not hurt them. One, two, fled <b>cheeping</b> into cover of the wood; almost instantly they coursed back again to where we stood, to dart off from us at an angle, in an ecstasy of bewilderment and terror.|$|E
60|$|This {{was a very}} {{different}} camp from that of the night before in the cool and silent pine-woods. It was warm and even stifling in the valley. The shrill song of frogs, like the tremolo note of a whistle with a pea in it, rang up from the river-side before the sun was down. In the growing dusk, faint rustlings began to run to and fro among the fallen leaves; from time to time a faint chirping or <b>cheeping</b> noise would fall upon my ear; {{and from time to time}} I thought I could see the movement of something swift and indistinct between the chestnuts. A profusion of large ants swarmed upon the ground; bats whisked by, and mosquitoes droned overhead. The long boughs with their bunches of leaves hung against the sky like garlands; and those immediately above and around me had somewhat the air of a trellis which should have been wrecked and half overthrown in a gale of wind.|$|E
60|$|After a lapse {{of fifteen}} years he rediscovered this {{interesting}} world, about {{which so many}} people go incredibly blind and bored. He went along country roads while all the birds were piping and chirruping and <b>cheeping</b> and singing, and looked at fresh new things, and felt as happy and irresponsible as a boy with an unexpected half-holiday. And if ever the thought of Miriam returned to him he controlled his mind. He came to country inns and sat for unmeasured hours talking of this and that to those sage carters who rest for ever in the taps of country inns, while the big sleek brass jingling horses wait patiently outside with their waggons; {{he got a job}} with some van people who were wandering about the country with swings and a steam roundabout and remained with them for three days, until one of their dogs took a violent dislike to him and made his duties unpleasant; he talked to tramps and wayside labourers, he snoozed under hedges by day and in outhouses and hayricks at night, and once, but only once, he slept in a casual ward. He felt as the etiolated grass and daisies must do when you move the garden roller away to a new place.|$|E
6000|$|Dr. Swift has a {{wife and}} an infant son, {{beginning}} to toddle and run, and they live here as composed as brick and mortar - at least the wife does, a Kentucky German, a fine enough creature, I believe, who was quite amazed at the sisters shedding tears! How strange is mankind! Gilfillan too, a good fellow I think, and far from a stupid, kept up his hard Lowland Scottish talk in the boat while the sister was covering her face; but I believe he knew, and did it (partly) in embarrassment, and part perhaps in mistaken kindness. And that was one reason, too, why I made my speech to them. Partly, too, I did it, because I was ashamed to do so, and remembered one of my golden rules, 'When you are ashamed to speak, speak up at once.' But, mind you, that rule is only golden with strangers; with your own folks, there are other considerations. [...] This is a strange place to be in. A bell has been sounded at intervals while I wrote, now all is still but a musical humming of the sea, not unlike the sound of telegraph wires; the night is quite cool and pitch dark, with a small fine rain; one light over in the leper settlement, one cricket whistling in the garden, my lamp here by my bedside, and my pen <b>cheeping</b> between my inky fingers.|$|E
60|$|One {{early summer}} morning a {{possible}} explanation suggested itself. I was sitting quietly by the brook, {{on the edge of}} the big woods, waiting for a pool to grow quiet, out of which I had just taken a trout and in which I suspected there was a larger one hiding. As I waited a mother-grouse and her brood--one of the old beech partridge's numerous families for whom he provided nothing--came gliding along the edge of the woods. They had come to drink, evidently, but not from the brook. A sweeter draught than that was waiting for their coming. The dew was still clinging to the grass blades; here and there a drop hung from a leaf point, flashing like a diamond in the early light. And the little partridges, <b>cheeping,</b> gliding, whistling among the drooping stems, would raise their little bills for each shining dewdrop that attracted them, and drink it down and run with glad little pipings and gurglings to the next drop that flashed an invitation from its bending grass blade. The old mother walked sedately in the midst of them, now fussing over a laggard, now clucking them all together in an eager, chirping, jumping little crowd, each one struggling to be first in at the death of a fat slug she had discovered on the underside of a leaf; and anon reaching herself for a dewdrop that hung too high for their drinking. So they passed by within a few yards, a shy, wild, happy little family, and disappeared into the shadow of the big woods.|$|E
6000|$|Before I {{finished}} my house, wishing to earn {{ten or twelve}} dollars by some honest and agreeable method, {{in order to meet}} my unusual expenses, I planted about two acres and a half of light and sandy soil near it chiefly with beans, but also a small part with potatoes, corn, peas, and turnips. The whole lot contains eleven acres, mostly growing up to pines and hickories, and was sold the preceding season for eight dollars and eight cents an acre. One farmer said that it was [...] "good for nothing but to raise <b>cheeping</b> squirrels on." [...] I put no manure whatever on this land, not being the owner, but merely a squatter, and not expecting to cultivate so much again, and I did not quite hoe it all once. I got out several cords of stumps in plowing, which supplied me with fuel for a long time, and left small circles of virgin mould, easily distinguishable through the summer by the greater luxuriance of the beans there. The dead {{and for the most part}} unmerchantable wood behind my house, and the driftwood from the pond, have supplied the remainder of my fuel. I was obliged to hire a team and a man for the plowing, though I held the plow myself. My farm outgoes for the first season were, for implements, seed, work, etc., $14.72-1/2. The seed corn was given me. This never costs anything to speak of, unless you plant more than enough. I got twelve bushels of beans, and eighteen bushels of potatoes, beside some peas and sweet corn. The yellow corn and turnips were too late to come to anything. My whole income from the farm was ...|$|E

50|$|Black bulbuls feed {{mainly on}} seeds and insects, {{and they are}} often seen in small groups, either {{roosting}} or flying about in search of food. They are particularly fond of berries. They are known to feed {{on a wide range}} of berries including Celtis, Rosa, Melia and Ehretia in the Himalayas. They feed on the nectar of Salmalia, Erythrina, Rhododendron and other species. They make aerial sallies for insects. They can be quite noisy, making various loud <b>cheeping,</b> mewing and grating calls. The Himalayan form has been reported to make a call resembling a goat kid, throwing back its neck when calling.|$|E
5000|$|De {{was central}} in Daoist cosmology, and the Zhuangzi {{frequently}} explains it with dao [...] "the Way" [...] and tian [...] "heaven; god". Chapter 12, [...] "Heaven and Earth", has two good illustrations.In the Great Beginning, {{there was no}}nbeing; there was no being, no name. Out of it arose One; there was One, but it had no form. Things got hold of it and came to life, and it was called Virtue. Before things had forms, they had their allotments; these were of many kinds, but not cut off from one another, and they were called fates. Out of the flow and flux, things were born, and as they grew they developed distinctive shapes; these were called forms. The forms and bodies held within them spirits, {{each with its own}} characteristics and limitations, and this was called the inborn nature. If the nature is trained, you may return to Virtue, and Virtue at its highest peak is identical with the Beginning. Being identical, you will be empty; being empty, you will be great. You may join in the <b>cheeping</b> and chirping and, when you have joined in the <b>cheeping</b> and chirping, you may join with Heaven and earth. Your joining is wild and confused, as though you were stupid, as though you were demented. This is called Dark Virtue. Rude and unwitting, you take part in the Great Submission. (12, tr. Watson 1968:131-2) ...|$|E
50|$|These {{birds are}} gregarious and {{are found in}} flocks {{of as many as}} 60 birds. They feed on the ground or on low shrubs and grass stalks. They {{constantly}} utter a low <b>cheeping</b> or chirping contact call as they forage. They visit water and drink with a rapid sip and swallow action. Their feed {{on a wide range of}} grass seeds and will also make use of crop species.The breeding season is spread out and varies with region. They nest in winter in southern India and after summer in northern India. They nest, an untidy ball of grasses with an opening on the side, is placed in low shrubs, often on thorny Acacia and are known to make use of the old nests of baya weaver sometimes even visiting those that are occupied by the weaver birds. They will sometimes build their nest below the platform nests of vultures or storks. Old nests are used as dormitories through the year for roosting. Females are known to lay their eggs in the nests of other pairs. The clutch varies from 4 to 8 white eggs and these are incubated by both parents for about 11 days. Helpers may be involved in breeding as more than a pair are sometimes seen at a nest.|$|E
50|$|The adult white stork's main {{sound is}} noisy bill-clattering, {{which has been}} likened to distant machine gun fire. The bird makes these sounds by rapidly opening and closing its beak so that a {{knocking}} sound is made each time its beak closes. The clattering is amplified by its throat pouch, which acts as a resonator. Used {{in a variety of}} social interactions, bill-clattering generally grows louder the longer it lasts, and takes on distinctive rhythms depending on the situation—for example, slower during copulation and briefer when given as an alarm call. The only vocal sound adult birds generate is a weak barely audible hiss; however, young birds can generate a harsh hiss, various <b>cheeping</b> sounds, and a cat-like mew they use to beg for food. Like the adults, young also clatter their beaks. The up-down display is used for a number of interactions {{with other members of the}} species. Here a stork quickly throws its head backwards so that its crown rests on its back before slowly bringing its head and neck forwards again, and this is repeated several times. The display is used as a greeting between birds, post coitus, and also as a threat display. Breeding pairs are territorial over the summer, and use this display, as well as crouching forward with the tails cocked and wings extended.|$|E
5000|$|Like babblers, {{these birds}} are usually seen {{in small groups}} of five to fifteen, {{especially}} in the non-breeding season. They are usually found inside bushes, emerging {{up to the top}} of a stem and then diving back into cover to forage. They feed mainly on insects but take berries (Lantana and Salvadora) as well as nectar. When capturing insects, they may hold them down with their feet. The group constantly produces a series of <b>cheeping</b> or churring calls. During the breeding season, mainly the southwest monsoon (June to August) but sometimes during the receding monsoon, the song is a strong whistling twee-twee-ta-whit-chu, often delivered from a prominent perch. The colour of the inside of the mouth is said to turn from orange-brown to black during the breeding season. They appear to nest cooperatively, the nest being a deep cone made with grass and lined with fine fibre. The nest is wedged between upright stems, the vertical stems being incorporated into the wall of the nest. The outside of the nest is well covered in cobwebs. The usual clutch is four but varies from three to five. The eggs are pinkish white with chestnut-red patches. Both parents take part in incubation and feeding the young. The eggs hatch after about 15-16 days and the young birds fledge after about 13 days. Adult birds have been seen feigning injury presumably to detract predators. Birds roost communally in the centre of a bush, all facing in the same direction and sitting side by side. Members of a group will preen each other. In an apparent territorial display, a pair of birds were found to sing while facing another singing pair and they all simultaneously bobbed their heads while perching on legs held straight to appear tall. Shikras may sometimes attempt to prey on these birds.|$|E
