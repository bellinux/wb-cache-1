40|$|The EU-wide {{salmonella}} {{control programme}} provides for all Member States to submit an annual {{report on the}} percentage of salmonella-positive flocks of breeding poultry (Gallus gal-lus), laying hens and broilers. To meet this requirement, all Länder (German federal states) submit their data to the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) which then evaluates the data. The data reported for 2009 show that the established Community targets for breeding poultry (1 %) and broilers (1 %) were either maintained or reached. In official sampling, salmonella serovars targeted in the control programmes were found in 0. 8 % of breeding poultry and in 0. 4 % of broilers. In laying hens, the detection rate for salmonella serovars targeted in the control programmes was 4. 8 %, which was {{higher than in the}} previous year. Changes in detection rates are also possibly the result of improved reporting. This supports the relevance of harmonised reporting for the consistent implementation and assessment of control programmes. If only the results from official testing are taken into account, the detection rate of the five salmonella serovars targeted in the control programmes in breeding poultry were below the <b>Community</b> <b>target</b> established for salmonella control and thus complied with the target, as they have in previous years. If, however, test results reported by food business operators are also taken into account the result appears differently. Under these circumstances, the sal-monella findings in laying hens clearly exceeded the <b>Community</b> <b>target.</b> Compared with the relatively low detection rates of the previous year, salmonella detection was not reduced further...|$|E

40|$|The {{paper is}} an attempt to analyse the likely effects of {{compensatory}} social programmes such as Misiones Bolivarianas on community organisations in barrios and their participation in the planning and implementation of barrio upgrading projects, based on the case of the CAMEBA project in Caracas, Venezuela. The low level of <b>community</b> (<b>target</b> group) participation in Project CAMEBA has been compounded by a profoundly paternalistic approach of the national government that promised immediate relief and benefits in the form of compensatory programmes thus reinforcing habitual dependency amongst the poor people. These immediate-benefit programmes seem to have had an inhibiting effect on the community organisation and participation in the upgrading project, which had long term objectives and had aspired to create sustainable self-reliant communities in the project’s intervention areas. Such conclusion is reinforced by the results of the survey, which clearly shows that the awareness of the community regarding compensatory programmes is by and large greater than that of the upgrading project, even though project CAMEBA implementation started about four years before the apperance of the Misiones Bolivarianas. This situation has somehow hindered the process of community organisation which in any case involves training of communities to be legitimate and autonomous by getting rid of their chronic dependency syndrome.

WASP- 63 b {{is one of the}} community targets under consideration for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Early Release Science (ERS) program. We present a spectrum derived from a single observation by HST Wide Field Camera 3 in the near infrared. We engaged groups across the transiting exoplanet community to participate in the analysis of the data and present results from each. There is general agreement amongst all results that we find an H 2 O absorption feature with 3. 5 - 4. 0 sigma significance. However, the feature is muted in comparison to a clear atmosphere at solar composition. Although the detection of the water feature is robust, the reasons for the muting of this feature are ambiguous due to a degeneracy between clouds and composition. The data does not yield robust detections of any molecular species other than H 2 O. The group was motivated to perform an additional set of retrieval exercises to investigate an apparent bump in the spectrum at ~ 1. 55 um. We explore possible disequilibrium chemistry and find this feature is consistent with super-solar HCN abundance but it is questionable if the required mixing ratio of HCN is chemically and physically plausible.

40|$|Objectives: Go-Golborne is a pilot {{intervention}} to prevent childhood obesity in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea between 2014 and 2018. It is a multi-strategy approach targeting children aged 0 - 16 years {{and their families}} in all settings where children live, learn and play. This paper describes the methodology and the practical steps {{in the development of}} Go-Golborne. Study design: The programme uses a quasi-experimental design for the evaluation of changes in weight status using data from the extended National Child Measurement Programme across local schools. For specific behavioural change objectives, baseline self-reported lifestyle measures will be compared against annual follow-up data over the 3 -year study period. Qualitative methods will be used to explore the perceptions of stakeholders and participants and organizational change. Methods: Go-Golborne aims to mobilize everyone in the community who has a role or interest in shaping the local environment, norms and behaviors across a range of sectors. A community network of local organisations has been established to co-design all programme activities. A Steering Group of Council officers supports programme implementation and environmental changes. The programme has identified six specific behavior change objectives representing the key areas of need in Golborne and all activities in the council and the <b>community</b> <b>target</b> these objectives during specific programme phases. Key components include community capacity building, community-wide social marketing, environment and policy change and evaluation.

Conclusions: The pilot aims to test the effectiveness of this approach to support behavior change and prevent unhealthy weight gain in children using multiple strategies. This programme will inform the development of an intervention model that defines essential programme components, accountability of partner organisations delivering obesity prevention programmes and the effective use of existing assets...|$|E
40|$|Although much {{research}} has been conducted to identify efficacious psychosocial treatments for children and adolescents, the research findings have not always translated into improved mental health care in real world practice settings. Understanding what clinicians attempt to target in treatment is an essential starting point to bridging the gap between research and practice in youth mental health and improving mental health treatment for youth in real world settings, particularly given research findings that therapists tend to use a broader variety of treatment strategies with less intensity than typically found in evidence-based treatments. It is possible that clinicians in the <b>community</b> <b>target</b> broader areas of functioning than symptoms in treatment or that targets lack the focus on symptom change often seen in research trials. To address this concern, clinician-reported monthly targets of treatment and intake diagnoses for youth in the Hawaii state mental health system were examined. Given the high rates of trauma exposure among American youth and the broad negative sequelae associated with exposure to trauma, a primary focus on the diagnosis of PTSD and the target of traumatic stress for treatment was selected. Clinician-reported monthly targets of treatment and intake diagnoses for youth in the Hawaii state mental health system were examined. With the exception of the traumatic stress, clinicians addressed similar symptoms and areas of functioning for youth with and without a PTSD diagnosis. Although clinicians did target traumatic stress for treatment significantly more often in youth with a PTSD diagnosis compared with youth without a PTSD diagnosis, the proportion of youth with a PTSD diagnosis and in which traumatic stress was a target of treatment was unexpectedly low (< 50 %). Furthermore, when exploratory analysis identified natural groups of cases with similar treatment targets in the sample, assignment to Multisystemic Therapy (MST) was a strongly related to grouping. This finding indicates that treatment selection may drive target selection rather than vice versa. When clinicians targeted traumatic stress in youth without a PTSD diagnosis, major depressive disorders were more frequently the primary diagnosis than in the full sample. These findings suggest that diagnosis may not be the only factor to influence clinician selection of what to address in treatment...|$|E
