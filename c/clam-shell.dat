She performed it wearing a mop-top wig and <b>clam-shell</b> bikini, while playing a Gibson Flying V guitar. During the performance, 15 large, inflatable flowers rose up from below on stage. The flowers were inflated using an air hose to create a garden on the stage. According to Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone, [...] "Gaga did 'Venus' in a clamshell bikini and a wig evoking Raquel Welch in One Million Years B.C., while her dancers wore sad little white costumes that made them look like Woody Allen and Christopher Guest playing sperm cells in Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask)." [...] In 2017, Gaga performed the song at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival.|$|E
500|$|Extensive {{testing of}} the M22 {{occurred}} in 1943 and 1944, and was conducted by both the Ordnance Department and the British Armoured Fighting Vehicle (AFV) Gunnery School at Lulworth Ranges. These tests uncovered a number of faults and problems with the Locust. The AFV School noted {{that the process of}} loading the M22 into a C-54 transport aircraft took considerable time and involved the use of complex equipment. [...] Overall the process took six untrained men 24 minutes, although it was believed this could be shortened with sufficient training. Unloading was also a long process, taking approximately ten minutes; it was noted that the time it took to unload the M22 from a C-54 on the battlefield meant that both the tank and aircraft would make excellent targets for enemy fire. Operational use of the tank would therefore be restricted to the availability of airfields large enough to accommodate a fully laden C-54, which might not be in the right geographical location or might even have to be captured in advance of a planned airborne operation. A heavy transport aircraft, the Fairchild C-82 Packet, was developed to specifically carry the M22 inside its fuselage and unload it through a set of <b>clam-shell</b> doors, but it did not enter service until after the war had ended. The US Army Armored Board released a critical report on the Locust in September 1943, stating that it was inadequate in the areas of reliability and durability, and indicating {{that it would not be}} able to be successfully used during airborne operations. By 1944 it was also realized that the design of the tank was actually obsolete. The armor of the M22 in several areas was found to be so thin that it was incapable of even resisting the armor-piercing ammunition of a [...]50 caliber machine-gun. [...] Complaints were also made about the 37mm main armament, which was not powerful enough to penetrate the armor of most tanks used by the Axis powers. Similarly a report made on March 13, 1944 by elements of the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment complained that when a high-explosive shell was fired from the gun, the resulting shell-burst was so weak that observers had difficulty in seeing where it impacted. There were also mechanical problems with the design, which caused it to be unreliable; the engine was also found to be underpowered, possibly due to problems with the torque characteristics of the engine or an inefficient transmission system.|$|E

2500|$|In Steven Spielberg's 1991 film Hook, {{the pirates}} occupy a small port town {{peppered}} with merchant shopfronts, warehouses, hotels, pubs and an improvised baseball field, and many {{ships and boats}} of varying sizes and kinds fill the harbour, as the pirates, since Peter's disappearance, {{have been able to}} expand their territory. The Home Underground has also been replaced by an intricate tree house structure which is prominent on the landscape rather than concealed, as the Lost Boys have successfully taken over their part of Neverland. This structure is possibly a continued development of Peter's [...] "house atop the trees" [...] which he occupies following Hook's defeat and the Lost Boys' return to the Mainland, presumably because he no longer has to hide nor house a large community. The number of lost boys have also increased and they navigate their home via hybrid wind-surfer/skateboard tracks, as the power of flight was lost with Peter. The Mermaids' Lagoon is directly connected to the Lost Boys' tree house structure by a giant <b>clam-shell</b> pulley system, possibly because they have become allies to the Lost Boys in Peter's absence. The Home Underground is discovered buried and forgotten by an adult Peter in the film, underneath the new home of the Lost Boys. Thus, while more elaborate, the locations of the Home Underground and the Pirates are unchanged. Neither the redskins nor their territory appear in the film.|$|E

60|$|I {{found one}} stone {{on the top}} of the bank, of a dark gray color, shaped exactly like a giant clam (Mactra solidissima), and of the same size; and, what was more remarkable, {{one-half}} of the outside had shelled off and lay near it, of the same form and depth with one of the valves of this clam, while the other half was loose, leaving a solid core of a darker color within it. I afterward saw a stone resembling a razor clam, but it was a solid one. It appeared as if the stone, in the process of formation, had filled the mould which a <b>clam-shell</b> furnished; or the same law that shaped the clam had made a clam of stone. Dead clams, with shells full of sand, are called sand clams. There were many of the large clamshells filled with sand; and sometimes one valve was separately filled exactly even, as if it had been heaped and then scraped. Even, among the many small stones {{on the top of}} the bank, I found one arrow-head.|$|E

At {{the other end of}} the skewer was fastened a small <b>clam-shell.</b> This was used to scoop up the smaller and softer portions of the repast into which all four of the occupants of each table dipped impartially. The Wieroo leaned far over their food, scooping it up rapidly and with much noise, and so great was their haste that a part of each mouthful always fell back into the common dish; and when they choked, by reason of the rapidity with which they attempted to bolt their food, they often lost it all.

I kept this up as long as possible, but as the east paled with the coming of dawn I began to succumb.

Their ears were pierced and distended to accommodate wooden plugs and sticks, pipes, and all manner of barbaric ornaments. Their faces and bodies were tattooed or scarred in hideous designs. In their sickness they wore no clothing, not even loin-cloths, though they retained their shell armlets, their bead necklaces, and their leather belts, between which and the skin were thrust naked knives.

40|$|International audienceDeep-sea {{electric}} and optical connections {{can often be}} problematic. Several manufacturers propose wet-mateable connectors based on integrated valve systems but the complexity and precision needed to reach the required reliability result in high cost. We are therefore developing {{a new type of}} tooling for connecting cheap standard wet-mateable connectors under oil in deep sea water pressure conditions. Complexity is delocalised from the connector to the easily recoverable and reparable tooling. The cost of wet connections is consequently expected to be drastically reduced, with reliability enhanced. The tooling contains 2 carriers sliding on a linear stage together with a second perpendicular stage intersecting the line between the carriers. The carriers and linear stages are enclosed in a <b>clam-shelled</b> oil-fillable volume. Each half of the connector to be mated is fixed to its respective carrier in a ROV operation. The waterproof caps of the two connectors automatically attach to the third carrier on the perpendicular stage. Seawater around the connectors is replaced with non-conductive oil, and both halves of the connector are detached from their sealing caps, which are then moved sideways to allow the connector to be mated under oil. The clamshells are then opened, allowing the mated connector to be removed by the ROV. A reverse capping procedure is applied for disconnection...|$|R

40|$|Normal and {{irregular}} blunt <b>clam-shells</b> were found. Blunt shells increased with depth, because of increasing anoxia. Minimal weight-indices and reproductive stages {{were found at}} 40 m depth (near thermo-haline stratification) probably due to spawning just before sampling. Clams from shallower stations were more ripe and heavier due to higher temperatures and re-development than at deeper stations since temperatures were still below threshold levels for spawning (10 degreesC). Respiration was at ambient temperatures acclimated to standard rates. Consequently, clams from deeper stations (with lower ambient temperatures) had 2 times higher respiration at the same test- temperature. Clams from the most shallow station (Puck Lagoon 5 m) showed the worst performance due to adverse hydrodynamics (stagnated water, anoxia). Heterozygotes showed better performance than homozygotes (heterosis). In 1995 genetic differentiation was found (Idh was diagnostic) : clams below 30 m resembled Atlantic populations; shallow stations formed a distinct group (Baltic race). In later years all populations were Atlantic, probably due to inflow of North Sea water. Before 1996 ecophysiological differences between clams in the Gdansk Bay can possibly be related to genetic differentiation (adaptations of Atlantic vs. Baltic types), in later years differences were due to acclimation to ambient temperatures, salinity and oxygen levels.
