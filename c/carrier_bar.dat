The A-Class in Australia comes standard with 9 airbags.|$|R
25|$|Despite being {{intended}} as 'disposable warships', {{all of the}} completed Light Fleet carriers exceeded their planned three-year service life. The maintenance carriers {{were the first to}} be paid off in the 1950s, and by the 1960s, all of the Royal Navy <b>carriers,</b> (<b>bar</b> , which was later recommissioned as a repair ship) had been sold to other nations or for ship breaking. The carriers in other navies had longer service lives. At the time of her decommissioning in 2001, Minas Gerais was the oldest active aircraft carrier in the world. Despite attempts to preserve several of these carriers as museum ships, the last surviving example, , was sold for scrapping in 2014.|$|R
50|$|Until 1993, active letter <b>carriers</b> were <b>barred</b> {{from taking}} any {{significant}} volunteer role for any political campaigns.

50|$|Eyetech Group Ltd {{was founded}} as a {{subsidiary}} of an international UK plc, before trading as its own, standalone plc following a management buyout in 1985. The company has mostly been involved in producing bespoke software systems for commercial use in the transport and distribution sector under Unix/AIX, track and trace systems involving the use of barcodes, which {{have been used by}} the majority of UK parcel <b>carriers</b> and <b>bar</b> code decoders and industrial (networked) shop floor data capture and access control systems.|$|R
50|$|Continental {{then began}} the process of {{consolidating}} its four commuter <b>carriers</b> (PBA, <b>Bar</b> Harbor, Britt, Rocky Mountain) into one consolidated Continental Express carrier, serving its main hubs at Newark, Houston, and Denver. The combined carrier operated using the Britt Airways operating certificate. In the consolidation, PBA's Florida routes were spun off to Eastern Airlines, and continued to operate using Bar Harbor Airways aircraft and operating certificate as Eastern Express until the demise of Eastern Airlines. The PBA hubs at Boston and LaGuardia continued to operate {{for a little while}} longer.|$|R
25|$|The Djinn {{featured}} a two-seat cockpit as standard, upon which a single pilot and passenger could be accommodated. A range of specialised equipment could be outfitted to suit mission roles, such as stretcher <b>carriers,</b> spray <b>bars,</b> radio sets, electrical systems, additional fuel tanks, and a load-bearing hook. Akin to the later Aérospatiale Alouette II helicopter, the Djinn made considerable use of pneumatic systems. According to aerospace publication Flight International, considerable weight savings {{had been on}} the rotorcraft via the use of bleed air to operate various cockpit indicators and functions, including the blind-flying instruments, fuel gauges, cabin heaters, windshield demisters, trimmers, air/sea rescue hoists and crop-spraying equipment.|$|R
50|$|They {{returned}} to Andover in 1688 {{where they lived}} in poverty and were dependent on the family farm to supply them with a living. Martha nursed her father and two brothers when an outbreak of smallpox spread through the city in 1690 but could not save them. Thereby she became a land owner in her own right. Her husband and four of her children also contracted the disease. Her husband {{and two of the}} children survived. They were accused of bringing the disease to the city, but investigation has revealed that the disease was most likely brought by new immigrants from England. Thirteen people perished during the epidemic, and the <b>Carriers</b> were <b>barred</b> from entering public places.|$|R
40|$|International audienceGS 1 is global {{traceability}} standard, {{which is}} composed by the encoding system (EAN/UCC, EPC), the data <b>carriers</b> identified automatically (<b>bar</b> codes, RFID), {{electronic data interchange}} standards (EDI, XML). RFID is a non-contact, multi-objective automatic identification technique. Tracing of source food, standardization of RFID tags, sharing of dynamic data are problems to solve urgently for recent traceability systems. The paper designed general framework for animal food safety traceability using GS 1 and RFID. This framework uses RFID tags encoding with EPCglobal tag data standards. Each information server has access tier, business tier and resource tier. These servers are heterogeneous and distributed, providing user access interfaces by SOAP or HTTP protocols. For sharing dynamic data, discovery service and object name service are used to locate dynamic distributed information servers...|$|R

50|$|A key {{principle}} of EPCIS is that unlike raw data captured from data <b>carriers</b> such as <b>bar</b> codes and RFID tags, EPCIS events include additional information that imbues the raw observations with meaning {{relative to the}} physical or digital world and to specific steps in operational or analytical business processes. An EPCIS event, while containing {{much of the same}} data as an RFID tag read or a bar code scan, is at a semantically higher level because it incorporates an understanding of the business context in which the identifier data were obtained. Moreover, there is no requirement that an EPCIS event be directly related to a specific physical data carrier observation. For example, an EPCIS event may indicate that a perishable trade item has just crossed its expiration date; such an event may be generated purely by software.|$|R

40|$|In {{the course}} of {{analyses}} of severe air ingress accidents in high temperature gas-cooled reactors the present report deals with the kinetics of the reactions between oxygen and the graphitic fuel element matrix materials A 3 - 3 and A 3 - 27. Kinetic experiments covering a temperature range of approx. 950 to 1200 K (approx. 680 to 930 ° C) {{and a range of}} oxygen partial pressures between 1500 and 15000 Pa (0, 015 and 0, 15 bar) at a constant total pressure of 1, 5 <b>bar</b> (<b>carrier</b> gas Helium) are presented. Their results are comprehended to Hinshelwood-Langmuir-like correlations. These correlations give maximum reaction rates, as they are valid for thatgraphite burn-off field, in which the reaction rate no longer increases with burn-off. The experiments, however, give some evidence about the burnoff dependence. A clear influence of the temperature on the increase factor of the reaction rate can be realized : the increase factor declines with rising temperature. A comparison of the experimental results with literature data, which, however, touch the above mentioned parameter range only at its periphery and thus had to be extrapolated, established satisfactory results...|$|R
50|$|In his {{subsequent}} time in Nuremberg, {{he was working}} on continuous structural systems, which could be calculated more simple. In 1866 he was awarded the Bavarian patent ″Balkenträger mit freiliegenden Stützpunkten″ (<b>bar</b> <b>carrier</b> with exposed bases). This cantilever bridge system was first realized in 1867 at a bridge over the Regnitz at Bamberg and in the Main Bridge in Haßfurt. This construction spread rapidly and became known worldwide as Gerber Beam. 1868 Gerber went back to Gustavsburg to manage the construction of the second track of the Rhine bridge. Then he located with an office in Munich. As part of the conversion of the Nuremberg headquarters in Maschinenbau-Actiengesellschaft Nürnberg, in 1873, the plant MAN-Werk Gustavsburg and his Munich office was merged to Süddeutsche Bridge AG in Munich and became independent with Gerber as Chief Executive. During this time he dealt among other things with development work on intersections of truss, the other duties of the Executive Board were to him less. At his own suggestion, this company was merged in 1884 into the Maschinenbau-Aktiengesellschaft Nürnberg (now MAN). Gerber was a board member there and had a seat in the technical advisory board. He devoted himself to continue his research and consulting activities.|$|R
