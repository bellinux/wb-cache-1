Focusing on a scenario where the <b>fiscal</b> <b>authority</b> is impatient relative to the monetary authority, we show that the equilibrium allocation is typically characterized by a public spending bias if the central bank uses the nominal money supply as its instrument. If it uses instead the nominal interest rate, the central bank can prevent distortions due to fiscal impatience and implement the same equilibrium allocation that would obtain under cooperation of two benevolent policy authorities. Despite this property, the welfare-maximizing choice of instrument depends on the economic environment under consideration. In particular, the money growth instrument is to be preferred whenever fiscal impatience has positive welfare effects, which is easily possible under lack of commitment...|$|R

Many {{have argued that the}} EU did not actually meet the criteria for an OCA at the time the euro was adopted, and attribute the Eurozones economic difficulties in part to continued failure to do so. [...] Europe does indeed score well on some of the measures characterising an OCA (such as symmetry of shocks). By looking at the correlation of a regions GDP growth rate with that of the entire zone, the Eurozone countries show slightly greater correlations compared to the U.S. states. However, it has lower labour mobility than the United States, possibly due to language and cultural differences. In ORourkes paper, more than 40% of U.S. residents were born outside the state in which they live. In the Eurozone, only 14% people were born in a different country than the one in which they live. In fact, the U.S. economy was approaching a single labor market in the nineteenth century. However, for most parts of the Eurozone, such levels of labour mobility and labor market integration remain a distant prospect. Furthermore, the U.S. economy, with a <b>central</b> federal <b>fiscal</b> <b>authority,</b> has stabilization transfers. When a state in the U.S. is in recession, every $1 drop in that state’s GDP would have an offsetting transfer of 28 cents. Such stabilizing transfers are not present in both the Eurozone and EU; thus, they cannot rely on fiscal federalism to smooth out regional economic disturbances. The European crisis, however, may be pushing the EU towards more federal powers in fiscal policy.|$|R

40|$|Economists discuss {{multi-level}} governance {{in terms of}} fiscal federalism, namely as a problem of assigning fiscal functions optimally to different tiers of government. This literature assumes that {{the jurisdiction of the}} monetary authority coincides with that of the <b>central</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>authority.</b> However, EMU implied for each member state that national fiscal policy became devolved relative to supranational monetary policy. In several member states, this ‘upward’ devolution of stabilisation came on top of fiscal decentralisation in the conventional sense. In the run-up to EMU, and even earlier, governments tended to decentralise public finances. The question this paper asks is how this dual trend of devolution relates to the goals of the EMU fiscal framework and its operation in practice. In this paper, we argue that laboratory fiscal federalism is a more appropriate framework than functional public finance or constitutional public choice for understanding fiscal devolution in EMU. We explore to what extent national governments have used innovations in upward and downward devolution to get better control over their budgets, using EMU as a lever. We also ask what this potential gain in budgetary control and consolidation has meant for national stabilisation in EMU...|$|E

40|$|EMU has {{a unique}} {{macroeconomic}} framework that combines a single monetary policy with coordinated national economic and fiscal policies. Since the coordination process has some serious weaknesses despite having been modified several times in recent years, {{the idea of a}} single economic/fiscal policy is being discussed as a potential alternative solution for the euro area. On the one hand, there are reasonable economic arguments in favor of a single fiscal policy, such as the need to formulate an aggregate fiscal stance for the euro area as a whole, the need to ensure sustainable macroeconomic stabilization within EMU, and the need for a kind of insurance against asymmetric shocks. On the other hand, establishing the context for a single fiscal policy would require significant changes to the present political, institutional, and macroeconomic design of the EU. Such a context could include full political union with a federal structure, and federal institutions, including an economic government or <b>central</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>authority</b> for the euro area, with a much larger and restructured general budget at the EU level, and possible abandonment of the rule that the budget must be in balance every year. Currently, neither the political will nor the social support exists in the EU for transferring further national authority to a supranational, European level. Therefore, while it may be desirable, a single fiscal policy in the euro area can only be considered for the long run; it is not an option for the short or medium term.

40|$|The cost {{of state}} {{bankruptcy}} in the euro area is incalculable {{due to the}} repercussions for the financial system. As a result of contagion effects, {{there is a risk}} that the entire Monetary Union could be pushed into deep recession. This forces euro area member states to implement rescue packages during periods of crisis, at a high costto taxpayers. The bailout policy adopted during the most recent crisis was an indication that sovereign debt in the euro area would be subject to joint liability. This temporarily eliminated incentives for national budgetary discipline. On this basis, it is argued that enhancing the institutional framework of the euro area in the long term by issuing common bonds would alleviate existing distortions of fiscal incentive effects in the euro area. Such a "safe haven" for the euro area could make a major contribution to stabilizing the financial system during periods of crisis. The positive impact this would have on the banking system could reduce the indirect costs of restructuring government debt which, in turn, would make restructuring debt from public debtors in the euro area economically feasible. This would strengthen the no-bailout rule which, again, is likely to result in an increasingly risk-based approach to interest on national debt. With this in mind, limited joint liability under strict conditions would be a welcome measure since it takes advantage of market incentives to cut public spending and consequently helps alleviate the problem of over-indebtedness in the euro area in the long term. As a prerequisite for creating common bonds, binding fiscal rules must be introduced in order that some sovereignty rights can be delegated to a <b>central</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>authority.</b> In the short term, therefore, the required conditions for common bonds are not in place...|$|E

Initially, in order to fulfill this function, UNMIK established the <b>Central</b> <b>Fiscal</b> <b>Authority</b> (CFA) and then in 2002, CFA was transformed to the Ministry of Finance and Economy (MFE). Although, Kosovo was still under the jurisdiction of UNMIK until 2008, MEF has completed the activities related to the Ministry of Finance in a national level pursuant to the Constitutional Framework and the Law on Management of Public Finances and Responsibilities (LMPFR).

However, Germany 2 ̆ 019 s rising public debt is not due to loose fiscal policy but {{the result of the}} common monetary policy in European Monetary Union (EMU). While Germany has the lowest rate of inflation in EMU, it has to pay the same nominal rate of interest as its competitors, that is, it has to shoulder the by far highest real rate of interest. This in turn has led to economic stagnation, with decreasing tax revenues and, in spite of huge efforts to reduce public expenditures, rising debts. As Germany is still the biggest economy in Europe, its stagnation has decisively contributed to EMU 2 ̆ 019 s slow economic growth. According to the authors, the not so pleasant state of Euroland {{is due to the fact}} that EMU is not an 2 ̆ 018 optimal currency area 2 ̆ 019 (Robert Mundell). EMU does not fulfil one of the most important criteria for optimality: the absence of tremendous differences between its member countries 2 ̆ 019 real rates of interest. In the paper, several measures of how to overcome the German problem are discussed, especially how to reconstruct the Eurosystem, the decentralised central banking system of EMU, to allow for a differentiated monetary policy, with high (low) nominal rates of interest for high (low) inflation countries. Drawing on a proposal by Erik Lindahl in 1930, this would mean to re-establish the European Central Bank (ECB) as the central monetary authority in the Eurosystem, with the monopoly to issue money. In spite of its name, the ECB is not a bank of issue, not to speak of being a lender of last resort, but only a co-ordinating agent between the Council of Governors of the Eurosystem, the decisive institution for monetary policy in EMU, and the twelve national central banks who alone issue the Euro. An alternative proposal discussed is to assign to the strongest central bank in the Eurosystem, the Bundesbank, the role of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in the Federal Reserve System, thereby transforming the Eurosystem into a European Reserve System of Federal States. However, the strengthening of the ECB, or the Bundesbank, needs the support of a <b>central</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>authority</b> in EMU, a role which today 2 ̆ 019 s EG Commission in Brussels cannot shoulder : it disposes only of a tiny amount of EMU 2 ̆ 019 s aggregate tax revenues.

40|$|The recent {{crisis has}} {{shed light on}} the {{weaknesses}} and the drawbacks of the European Monetary Union. In particular, many economists and commentators have suggested the need to complement the existing common monetary policy and stability pacts with some kind of fiscal union, i. e., enhanced supranational fiscal space and coordination, as a way to limit the impacts of idiosyncratic shocks and provide more risk sharing. The economic literature has proposed many solutions along this line, such as the institution of a European Minister of Finance, a <b>central</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>authority,</b> Eurobonds, or a coordinated scheme of unemployment insurance. More specifically, the notion of fiscal union may imply the development of European revenue sources for the EMU budget, the harmonization of taxation within the EMU, a mechanism to increase fiscal discipline at both the union and national levels, building up a union-wide insurance mechanism against financial turbulence, including debt mutualization. Examples of these proposals are Ubide (2015) and Corsetti et al. (2015) which propose Stability Bonds that would give proceeds to member states and could be used to enact counter-cyclical fiscal policies in the Euro Area. Sapir and Wolff (2015) recommend the creation of a Eurosystem of Fiscal Policy (EFP) with two goals: fiscal debt sustainability and an adequate area-wide fiscal position. Guiso and Morelli (2014) propose the creation of a European Federal Institute to which member states would transfer part of their budget, equal to some agreed-upon share {{of the value of the}} EFI’s accumulated debt. Further, Clayes et al. (2014) claim that the EMU should adopt a common system of partially centralized unemployment benefits, coming from the need for counter-cyclical horizontal transfers, which should act as mutual insurance. Moreover, the European Commission (2012) advances the idea of building a centralized Eurozone fund which would provide member states with automatic but temporary fiscal transfers in the case of adverse idiosyncratic shocks (repaid in good times). Many of these proposals are on the table with the goal of reinforcing the overall EU governance. In this work we address two fundamental issues concerning the general Euro Zone architecture and its prospect. One relates to the implementation of a common EMU fiscal policy, its ability to stimulate growth during periods of downturns and to smooth out the effects of adverse shocks, reacting to them at business cycle frequency (aggregate demand management and fiscal multipliers). The other regards shock absorption across state borders and the strengthening of financial markets’ integration (private risk-sharing) and national governments’ intervention into credit markets or supranational institutions arrangements (public risk-sharing). What comes to light is that a unique European fiscal policy may not be as beneficial as it is often claimed, because the fiscal transmission mechanisms are quite different across member states. Indeed, in the first paper of this thesis we show that fiscal multipliers are different across EMU countries (the analysis concerns Belgium, France, Germany, Italy and Spain). The study detects instability in the magnitude of the multipliers and in the slopes of the impulse response functions, both across countries and times, using standard VARs and time varying parameter VARs (TVP-VAR). We claim that the differences are due to transmission mechanisms (in the paper they are captured by the beta coefficients of the TVP-VAR) and driving forces rather than the magnitude and the volatility of national fiscal shocks per se (in the paper they are captured by the standard deviations of the TVP-VAR residuals). We argue that the observed degree of heterogeneity in the fiscal multipliers and in the other response coefficients across EMU countries casts some doubt on the real ability of EMU governments to coordinate their fiscal actions when needed and on the effectiveness of a common EMU fiscal policy in stimulating real economic activity. In the second paper of this dissertation, instead, we study the mechanisms, extent and characteristics of risk sharing across the EMU. How well do international financial markets allow for consumption smoothing in member countries facing idiosyncratic shocks? How effective are public national and supranational institutions in improving risk sharing? Our analysis extends the work and methodology pioneered by Asdrubali et al (1996) by updating results up to 2014 and by identifying the role of the European institutions (like the European Financial Stability Facility (ESFS) or the European Stabilization Mechanism (ESM)) created right after the great recession with the objective of assisting countries with limited market access. As a matter of fact, we find that the role played by public official transfers from these institutions to more vulnerable countries in order to smooth consumption during the great depression is noteworthy: the ESFS and the ESM have increased the amount of risk sharing within the EMU. More specifically, we use the method of variance decomposition first implemented by Asdrubali et al (1996) to identify the main channels of risk sharing (net factor income, international transfers and credit markets) and we split the credit market channel into two parts: smoothing achieved through private institutions (markets) and the public sector (national governments and official European institutions). We find that the European institutions have largely compensated the reduced role of national governments during the recent financial crisis. Based on these contributions, we derive some fiscal policy suggestions and conclusions. First, we think that there are reasons to be skeptical about the effectiveness and feasibility of a common fiscal policy for the purpose of stabilizing the business cycle. The reasons are that the fiscal transmission mechanisms are different among countries; countries need their own fiscal counter-cyclical measures in order to absorb idiosyncratic shocks, and, last but not least, European countries are not ready and willing to give up their sovereignty. Secondly, we suggest another type of coordination for EMU fiscal governance that is based on sharing resources at central level, through well-functioning and participated European institutions (along the lines of the ESM), that provide transfers to countries in exceptional circumstances and during period of downturns. The recent crisis has {{shed light on the}} weaknesses and the drawbacks of the European Monetary Union. In particular, many economists and commentators have suggested the need to complement the existing common monetary policy and stability pacts with some kind of fiscal union, i. e., enhanced supranational fiscal space and coordination, as a way to limit the impacts of idiosyncratic shocks and provide more risk sharing. The economic literature has proposed many solutions along this line, such as the institution of a European Minister of Finance, a <b>central</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>authority,</b> Eurobonds, or a coordinated scheme of unemployment insurance. More specifically, the notion of fiscal union may imply the development of European revenue sources for the EMU budget, the harmonization of taxation within the EMU, a mechanism to increase fiscal discipline at both the union and national levels, building up a union-wide insurance mechanism against financial turbulence, including debt mutualization.

40|$|Prudent fiscal {{management}} {{requires a}} clear delineation between the long-run and short-run behaviour of the government’s budget position. The long-run {{objective of the}} <b>fiscal</b> <b>authority</b> should be to achieve a sustainable fiscal position in which its budget is balanced. This requires a matching of expenditure responsibility with adequate revenue resources so that the “structural” budget position is one of balance. Long-run balanced budgets allow a separation of the <b>fiscal</b> <b>authority</b> from the monetary authority and give the monetary authority the necessary autonomy to pursue long-run price stabilization as its policy objective. Balanced budgets reduce or eliminate <b>fiscal</b> <b>authority</b> reliance on the inflation tax as a revenue source, and this in turn provides the monetary authority with the needed commitment and credibility to achieve an environment of long-run price stability. If government revenues and/or expenditures are sensitive to cyclical fluctuations in economic activity then the budget position of the <b>fiscal</b> <b>authority</b> should respond to these fluctuations in the short run. Surplus budget positions should occur in business cycle upturns and deficit budget positions should occur in business cycle downturns. These short-run cyclical movements in the <b>fiscal</b> <b>authority’s</b> budget are optimal both {{from the perspective of}} traditiona...|$|R

In the first regime, the central bank is subordinate and its budget is integrated into the <b>fiscal</b> <b>authority's</b> budget constraint. In this case, monetary policy influences the revenue mainly through currency seigniorage. In the other regime, the central bank's budget is separated {{from that of the}} <b>fiscal</b> <b>authority.</b> Commitment to a low nominal interest rate forces the central bank to inject money when the primary deficit increases. Thus, even if the budgets are separated, the central bank's actions are constrained by the <b>fiscal</b> <b>authority.</b> Under a "passive" Taylor rule, a reduction in the nominal interest rate lowers the government revenue. ...|$|R
