5|$|At 3400 ton, {{the vessel}} is argued to {{be a small}} frigate rather than a <b>corvette,</b> and poorly armed. It's also been alleged that the Indian Navy wanted a vessel with the {{endurance}} of a 3400-ton frigate and an armament of a 1200-ton <b>corvette.</b>|$|E
5|$|There is {{an option}} on the ship to include surface-to-air {{missiles}} (SAM). But it is unclear as to which SAM will {{be integrated into the}} Kamorta-class <b>corvette.</b> Options include Barak 1 and the Barak 8. The <b>corvette</b> can hold one helicopter, which currently is an Westland Sea King Mk.42B helicopter.|$|E

5|$|As dusk {{began to}} fall on the drying track, the No. 8 Peugeot {{suffered}} from rear wheel hub failures which required two lengthy visits to the garage. This allowed the No. 1 Audi to take over second place. Jacques Villeneuve's No. 7 Peugeot also lost time, which dropped it to two laps behind the No. 2 Audi. The No. 1 Audi had its own brief moment when the No. 63 <b>Corvette</b> clipped the Audi's rear end. The <b>Corvette</b> was forced to take evasive action through the Dunlop Chicane's gravel trap, and the Audi required replacement rear bodywork on its next pit stop.|$|E
5|$|HMS Ceylon {{had been}} {{despatched}} by the British authorities at Madras after the Battle of Grand Port {{to reinforce the}} remains of the squadron under Commodore Josias Rowley on Île Bourbon. Searching for Rowley off Île de France, Ceylon was spotted by French Commodore Jacques Hamelin who gave chase in his flagship Vénus, supported by a <b>corvette.</b> Vénus was faster than Ceylon, and although Captain Charles Gordon almost reached the safety of Île Bourbon, he was run down and forced to engage the French ship during the night, both frigates inflicting severe damage on one another before the wounded Gordon surrendered to the approaching <b>corvette.</b> As dawn broke, Rowley's flagship HMS Boadicea arrived, recaptured Ceylon, drove off the <b>corvette</b> and forced the battered French flagship to surrender, capturing Hamelin. This was the last ship-to-ship action in the region before the successful invasion of Île de France in December 1810: without Hamelin the French squadron, short on supplies and low on morale, did not contest British control of the region and failed to even attempt to disrupt the invasion fleet.|$|E
5|$|In GT1, the No. 63 <b>Corvette</b> {{recorded}} the fastest {{time of the}} day with a 3:49.207, followed by the No. 007 Aston Martin and the second factory <b>Corvette.</b> GT2 was dominated by Porsche, with the top three positions being taken by the new 997s. IMSA Performance Matmut led with a 4:01.598, while Autorlando and Flying Lizard followed behind. The Risi Competizione entry was the fastest Ferrari, in fourth place.|$|E

5000|$|Skjold-class <b>corvettes</b> (skjold means [...] "shield" [...] in Norwegian) are a {{class of}} six large, superfast, stealth missile <b>corvettes</b> in service with the Royal Norwegian Navy. The boats were {{formerly}} classed as MTBs (motor torpedo boats) but, from 2009, the Royal Norwegian Navy has described them as <b>corvettes</b> (korvett) because their seaworthiness is seen as comparable to <b>corvettes,</b> and {{because they do not}} carry torpedoes. They were built at the Umoe Mandal yard. With a maximum speed of , the Skold-class <b>corvettes</b> were the fastest combat ships afloat {{at the time of their}} introduction.|$|R
50|$|Two Ex-Royal Navy Castle-class {{patrol vessels}} were {{equipped}} with anti-ship missiles {{to serve as}} <b>corvettes,</b> named BNS Dhaleshwari and BNS Bijoy.

5|$|Modifications {{were made}} to the circuit from Mulsanne Corner to the <b>Corvette</b> Curves. The circuit was widened on the road {{connecting}} Mulsanne to Indianapolis, and again from Indianapolis to the Porsche Curves, although the kerbs remained in their previous locations. The first corner of the Porsche Curves had a larger run-off area on the outside while SAFER barriers had been installed on the inside wall. The <b>Corvette</b> corner also now featured a gravel run-off.|$|E

5|$|The French <b>corvette</b> {{had been}} {{struggling}} to catch up during the night and did not arrive until dawn approached, revealing the flagship in a damaged state and the British vessel even more stricken. Sailing directly at Ceylon, the <b>corvette</b> was able to manoeuvre around the frigate and place herself in a raking position, from which her cannon could cause heavy damage and casualties to Ceylon without reply. Rather than have his ship destroyed, the wounded Gordon surrendered (although {{it is not clear}} whether Victor opened fire or not before the British surrender). Victors men boarded Ceylon and Gordon and his officers, including Abercromby, were taken to Vénus as prisoners of war.|$|E
5|$|The prize, a 24-gun <b>corvette</b> named Utile, {{was taken}} into service with the Royal Navy as HMS Utile and Lydiard was {{promoted}} and given command of her, a commission confirmed on 22 July 1796.|$|E

5000|$|The K130 Braunschweig class (sometimes Korvette 130) is Germanys newest {{class of}} ocean-going <b>corvettes.</b> Five ships have {{replaced}} the [...] of the German Navy.

The decision was in response to NATO requirements expecting Germany to provide a total of four <b>corvettes</b> at the highest readiness level for littoral operations by 2018, and with only five <b>corvettes</b> just two can be provided.|$|R
5|$|The rain {{eventually}} became heavier, making the conditions treacherous and bringing the safety car back out. This put a temporary stop {{to the battle}} between Aston Martin and <b>Corvette</b> for first and {{second place in the}} GT1 class. The second place <b>Corvette</b> had been quicker in the wet conditions, but it was not allowed to further close on the Aston Martin during the safety period. After problems for both of the Barazi-Epsilon LMP2s, Binnie Motorsports brought its class leading LMP2 car to the garage to ensure that the car was prepared for the weather and could hold on to the lead until the finish.|$|E
5|$|In March 1889, the new <b>corvette</b> Calliope—sent to {{keep the}} peace and protect Britain's {{interests}} in Samoa—joined the competing squadrons of the Imperial German and United States navies at Apia. The harbour there was primitive, small and nearly surrounded by reefs. Perhaps fit for four ships, the anchorage held seven warships and six merchant vessels on 14 March.|$|E
5|$|Jun and Six are {{dispatched}} on {{a covert}} mission {{to assess the}} Covenant's strength and discover an invasion force gathering on the planet. The following morning, Noble Team assists UNSC forces in assaulting a Covenant ground base. When a massive Covenant super-carrier joins the fight, Jorge and Six {{take part in a}} plan to destroy the super-carrier using a makeshift bomb. The Spartans use starfighters to infiltrate a smaller Covenant <b>corvette,</b> prepare the bomb and set the <b>corvette</b> on a docking course with the carrier, but the bomb's timer is damaged. Left with no choice, Jorge stays behind and sacrifices himself to destroy the super-carrier. Moments later, huge numbers of Covenant ships arrive at Reach and begin a full-scale invasion.|$|E

5|$|On {{arrival at}} Port Louis on 18 June, the agents were {{confronted by a}} large body of heavily armed militia opposed to the {{abolition}} of slavery. Although they ordered Magallon to attack the islanders, the general refused and the agents were sent back to sea in a small <b>corvette,</b> eventually returning to Europe. Sercey remained in the East Indies, refitting his ships and joining his squadron to that already at Île de France. This force he divided, sending Preneuse and a <b>corvette</b> to patrol the Mozambique Channel. The remaining six frigates, comprising Vertu, Régénérée, Forte, Seine, Prudente and Cybèle, with the privateer schooner Alerte, Sercey took eastwards on 14 July, towards the Bay of Bengal.|$|E
