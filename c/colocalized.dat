Mass spectrometry-based protein correlation profiling of rat liver organelles and immunofluorescence analysis of the peroxisome candidate Rab proteins revealed Rab 6, Rab 10, Rab 14 and Rab 18 to associate with the peroxisomal membrane. While Rab 14 localized to peroxisomes predominantly in its dominant-active form, other Rab proteins associated with peroxisomes in both their GTP- and GDP-bound state. In summary, our data suggest that Rab 6, Rab 10, Rab 14 and Rab 18 associate with the peroxisomal compartment and similar as previously shown for Rab 8, Rab 18 in its GDP-bound state favors peroxisome proliferation.

40|$|ABSTRACT Poliovirus (PV), a {{model for}} {{interactions}} of picornaviruses with host cells, replicates its genomic RNA in association with cellular membranes. The origin of PV replicationmembranes has not been determined. Hypotheses {{about the origin of}} rep-lication membranes, based largely on localization of viral proteins, include modification of coat protein complex I (COPI) and/or COPII secretory pathway vesicles and subversion of autophagic membranes. Here, we use an antibody against double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) to identify replication complexes by detection of dsRNA replication intermediates. dsRNA signal is de-pendent on virus genome replication and <b>colocalizes</b> with the viral integral membrane protein 3 A, {{which is part of the}} RNA rep-lication complex. We show that early in infection, dsRNA does not <b>colocalize</b> with a marker for autophagic vesicles, making it unlikely that autophagosomes contribute to the generation of PV RNA replicationmembranes. We also find that dsRNA does not <b>colocalize</b> with a marker of the COPII coat, Sec 31, and, in fact, we demonstrate proteasome-dependent loss of full-length Sec 31 during PV infection. These data indicate that COPII vesicles are an unlikely source of PV replicationmembranes. We show that the Golgi resident G-protein Arf 1 and its associated guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), GBF 1, transiently <b>colocalize</b> with dsRNA early in infection. In uninfected cells, Arf 1 nucleates COPI coat formation, although during infection the COPI coat itself does not <b>colocalize</b> with dsRNA.

50|$|Because of {{its role}} in {{mediating}} dysphoria, dynorphin has also been investigated in relation to depression. Newton et al. studied the effects of CREB and dynorphin on learned helplessness (an animal model for depression) in mice. Overexpression of dominant negative CREB (mCREB) in transgenic mice had an antidepressant effect (in terms of behavior), whereas overexpressing wild-type CREB caused an increase in depression-like symptoms. As described previously, CREB increases transcription of prodynorphin, which gives rise to different dynorphin subtypes. Newton et al. supported this mechanism, as the mCREB was <b>colocalized</b> with decreased expression of prodynorphin. Also, direct antagonism of dynorphin caused antidepressant-like effects similar to those seen with mCREB expression. Thus, the CREB-dynorphin pathway regulates mood as well as cocaine rewards.|$|E
