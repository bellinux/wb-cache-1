5|$|In the 1950s and 1960s, the Organization for European Economic Cooperation (now the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) {{had made}} several {{attempts}} {{to create a}} framework for protecting international investments, but its efforts revealed conflicting views on how to provide compensation for the expropriation of foreign direct investment. In 1961, then-General Counsel of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) Aron Broches developed {{the idea for a}} multilateral agreement on a process for resolving individual investment disputes on a <b>case</b> <b>by</b> <b>case</b> basis as opposed to imposing outcomes based on standards. Broches held conferences to consult legal experts {{from all parts of the}} world, including Europe, Africa, and Asia, to discuss and compose a preliminary agreement. The IBRD staff wrote an official draft of the agreement and consulted with legal representatives of the IBRD's board of directors to finalize the draft and have it approved. The board of directors approved the final draft of the agreement, titled Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, and the Bank president disseminated the convention to its member states for signature on 18 March 1965. Twenty states immediately ratified the convention. The convention establishing the ICSID entered into force on 14 October 1966.|$|E

40|$|Many {{molecular}} target {{agents are}} continuously administered at fixed dosages. Imatinib, which {{can control the}} growth of a gastrointestinal stromal tumor, is administrated at 400 mg/day. However, many patients cannot continue treatment because of adverse events, such as neutropenia. To obtain the best therapeutic response while maintaining quality of life, individualization should be considered. Study participants were gastrointestinal stromal tumor patients who required treatment with imatinib. Therapeutic drug monitoring was conducted using high-performance liquid chromatography. In our study, the trough (lowest) concentration that a drug reaches before the next dose is administered differed among patients. The grades of adverse events also differed individually. Moreover, the dosage that was necessary to shrink gastrointestinal stromal tumor differed in <b>cases</b> <b>by</b> <b>cases.</b> Dosage was modified according to the balance between blood concentration and therapeutic responses in order to minimize adverse events for individual patients, and to maximize the effect as the responses differed among patients. It was shown that based on therapeutic drug monitoring, individualization enabled the patients who may not normally continue the typical treatment to tolerate imatinib. According to the therapeutic drug monitoring, individualization of dosage of imatinib could improve the patients’ outcomes in both ends, therapeutic and adeverse responses.    </p...|$|R
