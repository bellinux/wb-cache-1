25|$|A heated {{cylindrical}} billet workpiece is fed {{between two}} convex-tapered rollers, which are rotating {{in the same}} direction. The rollers are usually 6° askew from parallel with the billet's axis. The rollers are {{on opposite sides of}} the billet, and the surface of their largest cross sections are separated by a distance slightly smaller than the outside diameter (OD) of the original billet. The load imparted by the rollers compresses the material and the 6° skew provides both rotation and translation to the billet. The friction between the rollers and the billet is intentionally high, and is sometimes increased by using knurled rollers. This friction establishes stresses varying radially through the billet, with the highest stresses at the OD and the central axis. The stress exceeds the yield strength of the billet and causes circumferential fissures to propagate at various radii near the OD, and a central longitudinal void to form at the axis. A tapered mandrel is set inside and a short distance from the start of the central void. This mandrel forces the material outward and compresses the material against the back side of the tapered rollers. This compressive loading fuses the circumferential fissures and sets the initial internal diameter and OD values. The formed tube is then cooled and can be <b>cold</b> <b>worked</b> to refine the diameters and to achieve the desired yield strengths.|$|E

40|$|Shot-peened nickel-base {{superalloys}} exhibit 1 – 2 % {{increase in}} apparent eddy current conduc-tivity (AECC), {{which can be}} exploited for nondestructive residual stress assessment. Experi-mental evidence indicates that the excess AECC {{is due in part}} to elastic strains, i. e., residual stress, and in part to plastic strains, i. e., <b>cold</b> <b>work.</b> The very fact that the conductivity in-creases rather than decreases was originally thought to indicate that there was no significant <b>cold</b> <b>work</b> contribution to the observed AECC increase. This assumption was also supported by X-ray diffraction (XRD) results on fully relaxed specimens showing that the <b>cold</b> <b>work</b> in-duced widening of the diffraction beam only partially vanishes when both the residual stress and the AECC completely disappear due to thermal relaxation. However, we show in this paper that assuming that the conductivity change is entirely due to residual stress via the piezoresistivity of the material could result in an unacceptable overestimation of the magni-tude of the compressive residual stress. Therefore, we investigated the different mechanisms through which <b>cold</b> <b>work</b> could influence the AECC in surface-treated nickel-base super-alloys.
