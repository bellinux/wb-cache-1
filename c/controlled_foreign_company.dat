40|$|Although it {{exhibits}} {{a series of}} interesting properties including {{putting an end to}} transfer pricing and other losses and profit distribution strategies, the allocation of cross border profits in line with international consolidation and apportionment raises some issues.

Therefore consolidation and apportionment should be supplemented with a serious series of anti-abuse measures, especially provisions against <b>controlled</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>companies.</b> Those imply a revision of the taxation of <b>foreign</b> <b>companies,</b> actually a move from exemption to crediting for participating countries, and a revision of tax treaties accordingly.

It should consider the option of replacing the UK’s complex credit system with the simpler exemption system used in many other EU countries.

Results revealed statistically significant differences in the reported performances of <b>Foreign</b> <b>Controlled</b> Domestic <b>Companies</b> and United Kingdom Domestic Companies operating in the United Kingdom over the five year period. <b>Foreign</b> <b>controlled</b> firms significantly under performed United Kingdom Domestic Companies of comparable size and industry.

40|$|The South African fiscal {{legislators have}} found it {{necessary}} to introduce anti-avoidance legislation which governs controlled foreign companies in order to counteract schemes devised by taxpayers where companies are established outside South Africa for the purpose of diverting income from the South African fiscal net. Whilst the enforcement of such legislation does have merit in that the intention behind the introduction of such domestic legislation is to prevent the erosion of the South African tax base, it is submitted that this does pose a problem from an international perspective. The objective of this treatise is to conduct a critical analysis of how compatible the South African fiscal legislation which governs controlled foreign companies is with the provisions of the double taxation agreement as prescribed in terms of the OECD Model Tax Convention (which was published in July 2010). In addition, the aim {{of this study is to}} deduce whether the purpose of the double taxation agreement is not only the avoidance of juridical double taxation but also that it addresses the avoidance of economic double taxation. This will assist in determining whether domestic <b>controlled</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>company</b> legislation (as embodied in section 9 D of the Income Tax Act 58 of 1962) conflicts with the purpose of the double taxation agreement. By conducting an extensive research study and by depicting a certain scenario which addresses the issue at hand, the following is concluded: The tax treatment of the business profits generated by a <b>controlled</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>company</b> resident in a State outside South Africa and which have been generated from active business operating activities, is held to be in agreement with the provisions of the double taxation agreement. By contrast, the tax treatment of the controlled foreign company’s passive income in the form of interest income, is found not to correlate with the aforesaid agreement. As will be demonstrated in the chapters that follow, the controlled foreign company’s interest income is subjected to economic double taxation in terms of the scenario depicted in this treatise. This means that such income is taxed twice in the hands of two different taxpayers in two different States. As a result of this it is submitted that the following problem arises: Because section 9 D of the Income Tax Act causes economic double taxation to occur (as illustrated in the previous paragraphs) and owing to the fact that the purpose of the double taxation agreement is the avoidance of economic double taxation, it can be shown that the section 9 D domestic legislation conflicts with the terms of the double taxation agreement. This conflict is considered to be an area of concern because a contravention of the purpose of the double taxation agreement is regarded as a breach of the Contracting States’ international obligations in terms of the aforesaid agreement. It is further submitted that paragraph 23 of the OECD Commentary on article 1 and paragraph 14 of the OECD Commentary on article 7 are incorrect when they express the sentiment that domestic <b>controlled</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>company</b> legislation does not conflict with the provisions of the double taxation agreement. It is proposed that this be corrected to state the contrary...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{complements}} a {{small but}} growing literature on the effect of corpo-rate taxes on R&D investment and patent holdings. We provide evidence that patenting strategies are exploited as a device to transfer income to low-tax jurisdictions. Using data on the population of corporate patent applications to the European Patent Office, we show that the location of R&D investment and patent ownership is geographical-ly separated in a non-negligible number of cases. Moreover, our results suggest that this geographical split is partly motivated by tax considerations. We find that coun-tries which levy low patent income taxes attract ownership of foreign-invented patents, especially those patents that have a high quality and earnings potential. Analogously, inventor countries with high patent income tax rates observe ownership relocations of high-quality patents from their borders. Moreover, our results suggest that the probabi-lity for a patent to be owned by a party in a tax haven country significantly decreases if the inventor country has implemented <b>controlled</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>company</b> laws...|$|E

40|$|For eighty-six years up to {{the year}} 2000, I the South African income tax system was based {{primarily}} on the source principle. This meant that only income which was from a source in the Republic or deemed to be from a source in the Republic was taxable {{in the hands of}} residents. The election of a new Government in 1994, and the subsequent relaxation in exchange controls, necessitated a change from the source-based system of taxation to a residence-based system of taxation. The residence-based system of taxation in turn necessitated the introduction of new legislation to ensure that South African residents were taxed on their foreign source income, and appropriate anti-avoidance provisions were in place in order to prevent an erosion of the South African tax base. The residence-based system of taxation was phased into South Africa by the introduction of section 9 C to the Act. Section 9 C was introduced in 1997 as an interim and partial provision which provided for the taxation of foreign passive income 2 on a residence-basis.
