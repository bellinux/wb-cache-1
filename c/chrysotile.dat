25|$|<b>Chrysotile,</b> CAS No. 12001-29-5, is {{obtained}} from serpentinite rocks which are common throughout the world. Its idealized chemical formula is Mg(SiO)(OH). <b>Chrysotile</b> appears {{under the microscope}} as a white fiber.|$|E
25|$|<b>Chrysotile</b> {{has been}} used {{more than any other}} type and {{accounts}} for about 95% of the asbestos found in buildings in America. <b>Chrysotile</b> is more flexible than amphibole types of asbestos, and can be spun and woven into fabric. The most common use was corrugated asbestos cement roofing primarily for outbuildings, warehouses and garages. It may also be found in sheets or panels used for ceilings and sometimes for walls and floors. <b>Chrysotile</b> has been a component in joint compound and some plasters. Numerous other items have been made containing <b>chrysotile</b> including brake linings, fire barriers in fuseboxes, pipe insulation, floor tiles, residential shingles, and gaskets for high temperature equipment.|$|E

25|$|All {{types of}} {{asbestos}} fibers {{are known to}} cause serious health hazards in humans. Amosite and crocidolite are considered the most hazardous asbestos fiber types; however, <b>chrysotile</b> asbestos has also produced tumors in animals and is a recognized cause of asbestosis and malignant mesothelioma in humans, and mesothelioma has been observed in people who were occupationally exposed to <b>chrysotile,</b> {{family members of the}} occupationally exposed, and residents who lived close to asbestos factories and mines.|$|E

25|$|The Grand Canyon {{asbestos}} deposits {{are very}} similar in origin and nature to the asbestos deposits of the Sierra Ancha-Salt River Canyon region of Gila County, Arizona. As {{in the case of}} the Bass Formation, these <b>chrysotile</b> asbestos deposits are of the contact metamorphic type that occur in magnesium-bearing Mesoproterozoic dolomites and limestones altered by basaltic dikes and sills. As {{in the case of the}} Grand Canyon asbestos deposits, dolomite and limestone reacted with silica-bearing fluids, heated by the basalt intrusions, forming the serpentine mineral <b>chrysotile.</b> Much like the Grand Canyon asbestos deposits, these basaltic sills and dikes range in age from 1,050 to 1,140 Ma. Quite unlike, the Grand Canyon asbestos deposits, the asbestos deposits of the Sierra Ancha-Salt River Canyon region have been extremely productive.|$|E
25|$|This {{strata of}} the Lower Paleozoic (approximately 430million years old) {{consists}} predominantly of the serpentine minerals, antigorite, <b>chrysotile,</b> and lizardite, it also contains asbestos and talc.

25|$|While mostly <b>chrysotile</b> {{asbestos}} fibers {{were once}} used in automobile brake pads, shoes, and clutch discs, contaminants of amphiboles were present. Since approximately the mid-1990s, brake pads, new or replacement, have been manufactured instead with linings made of ceramic, carbon, metallic and aramid fiber (Twaron or Kevlarâ€”the same material used in bulletproof vests).|$|E
25|$|Because {{of their}} {{chemical}} structure, phyllosilicates typically have flexible, elastic, transparent layers that are electrical insulators {{and can be}} split into very thin flakes. Micas {{can be used in}} electronics as insulators, in construction, as optical filler, or even cosmetics. <b>Chrysotile,</b> a species of serpentine, is the most common mineral species in industrial asbestos, as it is less dangerous in terms of health than the amphibole asbestos.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of <b>chrysotile</b> asbestos veins in the Bass Formation was first noted in early {{exploration of the}} Grand Canyon by the Powell expedition. Shortly after 1890, mining claims were filed on these asbestos deposits. Later in the early 1900s, William Wallace Bass mined asbestos in the Shinumo Creek-Hakatai Canyon area and John Hance mined asbestos in Asbestos Canyon. Although these deposits had good quality asbestos, little asbestos, at most a few tons, was produced from them because these deposits were fairly small and difficult to access. These asbestos mines are now abandoned and protected as historical sites.|$|E
25|$|Lustre {{indicates}} how light reflects {{from the}} mineral's surface, {{with regards to}} its quality and intensity. There are numerous qualitative terms used to describe this property, which are split into metallic and non-metallic categories. Metallic and sub-metallic minerals have high reflectivity like metal; examples of minerals with this lustre are galena and pyrite. Non-metallic lustres include: adamantine, such as in diamond; vitreous, which is a glassy lustre very common in silicate minerals; pearly, such as in talc and apophyllite, resinous, such {{as members of the}} garnet group, silky which common in fibrous minerals such as asbestiform <b>chrysotile.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{rocks of}} the {{peridotite}} family are uncommon {{at the surface}} and are highly unstable, because olivine reacts quickly with water at typical temperatures of the upper crust and at the Earth's surface. Many, if not most, surface outcrops {{have been at least}} partly altered to serpentinite, a process in which the pyroxenes and olivines are converted to green serpentine. This hydration reaction involves considerable increase in volume with concurrent deformation of the original textures. Serpentinites are mechanically weak and so flow readily within the earth. Distinctive plant communities grow in soils developed on serpentinite, because of the unusual composition of the underlying rock. One mineral in the serpentine group, <b>chrysotile,</b> is a type of asbestos.|$|E
25|$|Industrial scale mining {{began in}} the Thetford hills, Quebec from the 1870s. Sir William Edmond Logan {{was the first to}} notice the large {{deposits}} of <b>chrysotile</b> in the hills in his capacity as head of Geological Survey of Canada. Samples of the minerals from here were displayed in London, and excited much interest. With the opening up of the Quebec Central Railway in 1876, mining entrepreneurs, such as Andrew Stuart Johnson established the asbestos industry in the province. The 50 ton output of the mines in 1878 rose to over 10,000 tons in the 1890s with the adoption of machine technologies and expanded production. For a long time, the world's largest asbestos mine was the Jeffrey mine in the town of Asbestos, Quebec.|$|E

According to a fact sheet from 2003, [...] "current knowledge and modern technology can successfully control the potential for health and environmental harm posed by chrysotile". The <b>Chrysotile</b> Institute, an association partially funded by the Canadian government, also prominently asserted that the use of <b>chrysotile</b> did not pose an environmental problem and the inherent risks in its use were limited to the workplace.|$|E
2500|$|The Canadian {{government}} {{continues to}} draw {{both domestic and}} international criticism for its stance on <b>chrysotile,</b> most recently in international meetings about the Rotterdam Convention hearings regarding <b>chrysotile.</b> [...] The CFMEU pointed out that most exports go to developing countries.

[...] In November, 2011, the Australian Upper House passed a motion to pressure the Canadian government to end policies supporting asbestos exports.|$|E
2500|$|The Harper {{government}} also has drawn sharp international criticism for its stance on asbestos which is heavily mined in Quebec.

2500|$|Basaltic sills and dikes intrude all {{strata of}} the Unkar Group that {{underlie}} the Cardenas Lava. Only sills, whose feeder dikes are not exposed, can be observed intruding the Bass Formation. Where the sills have intruded siliceous dolomites in the Bass Formation, metasomatism and recrystallization have produced <b>chrysotile</b> asbestos, both {{above and below the}} sills.

2500|$|Amphiboles {{have great}} {{variability}} in chemistry, described variously as a [...] "mineralogical garbage can" [...] or a [...] "mineralogical shark swimming {{a sea of}} elements". The backbone of the amphiboles is the 12âˆ’; it is balanced by cations in three possible positions, although the third position is not always used, and one element can occupy both remaining ones. Finally, the amphiboles are usually hydrated, that is, they have a hydroxyl group (âˆ’), although it can {{be replaced by a}} fluoride, a chloride, or an oxide ion. Because of the variable chemistry, there are over 80 species of amphibole, although variations, as in the pyroxenes, most commonly involve mixtures of Ca2+, Fe2+ and Mg2+. Several amphibole mineral species can have an asbestiform crystal habit. These asbestos minerals form long, thin, flexible, and strong fibres, which are electrical insulators, chemically inert and heat-resistant; as such, they have several applications, especially in construction materials. However, asbestos are known carcinogens, and cause various other illnesses, such as asbestosis; amphibole asbestos (anthophyllite, tremolite, actinolite, grunerite, and riebeckite) are considered more dangerous than <b>chrysotile</b> serpentine asbestos.|$|E

50|$|Due to its efficacy, <b>chrysotile</b> {{asbestos}} {{was often}} a component in brake linings.
