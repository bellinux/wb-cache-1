50|$|Adherent cells, {{for example}} many {{mammalian}} cell lines, grow {{attached to a}} surface such as {{the bottom of the}} culture flask. These cell types have to be detached from the surface before they can be subcultured. For adherent cells cell density is normally measured in terms of <b>confluency,</b> the percentage of the growth surface covered by cells. The cells will often have a preferred range of confluencies for optimal growth, for example a mammalian cell line like HeLa or Raw 264.7 generally prefer confluencies over 10% but under 100%, and subculture will normally try to keep the cells in this range. For subculture cells may be detached by one of several methods including trypsin treatment to break down the proteins responsible for surface adherence, chelating calcium ions with EDTA which disrupts some protein adherence mechanisms, or mechanical methods like repeated washing or use of a cell scraper. The detached cells are then resuspended in fresh growth medium and allowed to settle back onto their growth surface.|$|E

One challenge for ex vivo expansion is to decide the appropriate time to perform subculture. Traditionally, this decision has been reliant on human estimation of cell <b>confluency</b> and predicting when <b>confluency</b> will approach a desired threshold. However, the use of human operators results in highly subjective decisionmaking and is prone to inter- and intra-operator variability. Using a real-time cell image analysis system, we propose a datadriven approach to model the cell growth process and predict the cell <b>confluency</b> levels, signaling times to subculture.

Synthetic psoralen was found to have an increasing photosensitising activity with increasing concentration using a logarithmic shift between 0. 5 ppm and 50 ppm.

The importance of cell cycle phase during the nuclear transfer has been a matter of debate since the first mammalian clone was produced. The cell cycle phase of donor cells interferes on maintenance of correct ploidy and genetic reprogramming of the reconstructed embryo. The use of G 0 /G 1 arrested donor cells has been shown to improve nuclear transfer efficiency. The present study was conducted to test the hypothesis that domestic cat foetal fibroblasts cultured up to the fifth passage and submitted to full <b>confluency</b> provide a higher percentage of cells at G 0 /G 1 stage than fibroblasts cultured in serum starved media. Results demonstrated that serum starvation increased (p < 0. 05) the percentage of G 0 /G 1 fibroblasts when compared with control.

40|$|It was {{proposed}} that arresting nuclear donor cells in G 0 /G 1 phase facilitates {{the development of}} embryos that are derived from somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). Full <b>confluency</b> or serum starvation is commonly used to arrest in vitro cultured somatic cells in G 0 /G 1 phase. However, it is controversial as to whether these two methods have the same efficiency in arresting somatic cells in G 0 /G 1 phase. Moreover, {{it is unclear whether}} the cloned embryos have comparable developmental ability after somatic cells are subjected to one of these methods and then used as nuclear donors in SCNT. In the present study, in vitro cultured sheep skin fibroblasts were divided into four groups: (1) cultured to 70 - 80 % <b>confluency</b> (control group), (2) cultured to full <b>confluency,</b> (3) starved in low serum medium for 4 d, or (4) cultured to full <b>confluency</b> and then further starved for 4 d. Flow cytometry was used to assay the percentage of fibroblasts in G 0 /G 1 phase, and cell counting was used to assay the viability of the fibroblasts. Then, real-time reverse transcription PCR was used to determine the levels of expression of several cell cycle-related genes. Subsequently, the four groups of fibroblasts were separately used as nuclear donors in SCNT, and the developmental ability {{and the quality of the}} cloned embryos were compared. The results showed that the percentage of fibroblasts in G 0 /G 1 phase, the viability of fibroblasts, and the expression levels of cell cycle-related genes was different among the four groups of fibroblasts. Moreover, the quality of the cloned embryos was comparable after these four groups of fibroblasts were separately used as nuclear donors in SCNT. However, cloned embryos derived from fibroblasts that were cultured to full <b>confluency</b> combined with serum starvation had the highest developmental ability. The results of the present study indicate that there are synergistic effects of full <b>confluency</b> and serum starvation on arresting fibroblasts in G 0 /G 1 phase, and the short-term treatment of nuclear donor cells with these two methods could improve the efficiency of SCNT...|$|E

Materials and Methods: Four days after rat’s bone marrow culture initiation,medium of the culture was collected and its suspended cells were cultureexpandedin parallel with adherent cells till passage 3. During the cultureperiod, the cells from either group were statistically compared with respect ofthe time required for cell <b>confluency</b> (the stage in which cells cover the entiresurfaces) as an index of growth rate. At the end, the cells from both cultureswere evaluated in terms of their differentiation potential.

The c-Myc protein behaves as a transcription factor, and undoubtedly its role in carcinogenesis involves its ability to affect the {{expression of}} genes involved in cell growth. c-Myc {{has been reported to}} both activate and repress transcription in transient transfection experiments using reporter constructs bearing multiple copies of the c-Myc binding site, CAC (G/A) TG. We investigated these apparently paradoxical effects of c-Myc by determining if they arose from differences in the cell proliferation states of transfected cells. We found that endogenous c-Myc protein levels vary inversely with the degree of cell <b>confluency,</b> such that at low cell <b>confluency,</b> where endogenous levels of c-Myc are high and presumably endogenous levels of Max are limiting, exogenous c-Myc fails to affect basal transcription. In cells at high cell <b>confluency,</b> in which endogenous c-Myc levels are low, exogenous c-Myc augments transactivation by titrating the relative excess endogenous Max.

Hence, in batch culture the increase in GS activity at <b>confluency</b> may be a consequence of the cells either leaving the cell cycle or coming into register at a given point in it, e. g. G 1. Therefore it is desirable to determine if GS activity and adhesion are properties of non-cyclicing as well as actively growing populations. These studies were undertaken to determine if there is a relationship between intercellular adhesion and GS specific activity during the cell cycle and if hydrocortisone effects these parameters.

40|$|To {{investigate}} how cell population density influences the intracellular concentration of cyclic AMP we have measured adenylate cyclase and cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase activities and cyclic AMP levels {{at various stages}} of cell density in normal rat-kidney (NRK) cells, which exhibit contact-inhibition of growth, and in normal chick-embryo fibroblasts (CEF), which do not show contact inhibition of growth under our conditions. Until NRK cells reach <b>confluency,</b> both activities increase with increasing cell population and cyclic AMP levels are low. As NRK cells reach <b>confluency,</b> cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase activity decreases somewhat whereas adenylate cyclase activity continues to rise. This increase in synthetic ability is accompanied by the increase in cyclic AMP levels which occurs in these cells at <b>confluency.</b> In CEF grown in 5 % serum where density-dependent inhibition of growth is not observed, both adenylate cyclase and cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase activities increase proportionately with increasing cell population density. No significant alteration occurs in the ratio between these two enzyme activities and no change is observed in cyclic AMP levels...|$|E
40|$|Stimulation by UV irradiation, TNFalpha, {{as well as}} PDGF or EGF {{activates}} the JNK/SAPK signalling pathway in mouse fibroblasts. This {{results in}} the phosphorylation of the N-terminal domain of c-Jun, increasing its transactivation potency. Using an antibody that specifically recognizes c-Jun phosphorylated at Ser 63, we show that culture <b>confluency</b> drastically inhibited c-Jun N-terminal phosphorylation due to the inhibition of the JNK/SAPK pathway. Transfection experiments demonstrate that the inhibition occurs {{at the same level}} as, or upstream of, the small G-proteins cdc 42 and Rac 1. In contrast, the classical MAPK pathway was insensitive to <b>confluency.</b> The inhibition of JNK/SAPK activation depended on the integrity of the actin microfilament network. These results were confirmed and extended in monolayer wounding experiments. After PDGF, EGF or UV stimulation, c-Jun was predominantly phosphorylated in cells bordering the wound, which are the cells that move to occupy the wounded area. Thus, modulation of the stress-dependent signal cascade by <b>confluency</b> will restrict c-Jun N-terminal phosphorylation in response to mitogenic or chemotactic agents to cells that border a wounded area...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The covalently closed-circular DNA (cccDNA) of {{hepatitis}} B virus (HBV) {{is associated with}} viral persistence in HBV-infected hepatocytes. However, the regulation of cccDNA and its transcription in the host cells at different growth stages is not well understood. Methods We took advantages of a stably HBV-producing cell line, 1. 3 ES 2, and examine the dynamic changes of HBV cccDNA, viral transcripts, and viral replication intermediates in different cellular growth stages. Results In this study, we showed that cccDNA increased suddenly in the initial proliferation phase of cell growth, probably attributable to its nuclear replenishment by intracellular nucleocapsids. The amount of cccDNA then decreased dramatically in the cells during their exponential proliferation similar {{to the loss of}} extrachromosomal plasmid DNA during cell division, after which it accumulated gradually while the host cells grew to <b>confluency.</b> We found that cccDNA was reduced in dividing cells and could be removed when proliferating cells were subjected to long term of lamivudine (3 TC) treatment. The amounts of viral replicative intermediates were rapidly reduced in these proliferating cells and were significantly increased after cells reaching <b>confluency.</b> The expression levels of viral transcripts were increased in parallel with the elevated expression of hepatic transcription factors (HNF 4 α, CEBPα, PPARα, etc.) during cell growth <b>confluency.</b> The HBV transcripts were transcribed from both integrated viral genome and cccDNA, however the transcriptional abilities of cccDNA was less efficient then that from integrated viral genome in all cell growth stages. We also noted increases in the accumulation of intracellular viral particles and the secretion of mature virions as the cells reached <b>confluency</b> and ceased to grow. Conclusions Based on the dynamics of HBV replication, we propose that HBV replication is modulated differently in the different stages of cell growth, and can be divided into three phases (initial proliferation phase, exponential proliferation phase and growth <b>confluency</b> phase) according to the cell growth curve. The regulation of cccDNA in different cell growth phase and its importance regarding HBV replication are discussed. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{identification}} {{of factors that}} define adipocyte precursor potential {{has important implications for}} obesity. Preadipocytes are fibroblastoid cells committed to becoming round lipid-laden adipocytes. In vitro, this differentiation process is facilitated by <b>confluency,</b> followed by adipogenic stimuli. During adipogenesis, a large number of cytostructural genes are repressed before adipocyte gene induction. Here we report that the transcriptional repressor transcription factor 7 -like 1 (TCF 7 L 1) binds and directly regulates the expression of cell structure genes. Depletion of TCF 7 L 1 inhibits differentiation, because TCF 7 L 1 indirectly induces the adipogenic transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ in a manner that can be replaced by inhibition of myosin II activity. TCF 7 L 1 is induced by cell contact in adipogenic cell lines, and ectopic expression of TCF 7 L 1 alleviates the <b>confluency</b> requirement for adipocytic differentiation of precursor cells. In contrast, TCF 7 L 1 is not induced during <b>confluency</b> of non-adipogenic fibroblasts, and, remarkably, forced expression of TCF 7 L 1 is sufficient to commit non-adipogenic fibroblasts to an adipogenic fate. These results establish TCF 7 L 1 as a transcriptional hub coordinating cell–cell contact with the transcriptional repression required for adipogenic competency...|$|E

These GSCs can be implemented in drug screens to detect patient-specific responses, potentially bridging the translational gap to personalized medicine. Since numerous compounds are available, a rapid and reliable readout for drug efficacies is required. This can be done using approaches that measure viability, <b>confluency,</b> cytotoxicity, or apoptosis. To determine which assay is best suitable for drug screening, 10 different assays were systematically tested on established glioma cell lines and validated on a panel of GSCs. General applicability was assessed using distinct treatment modalities, being temozolomide, radiation, rapamycin, and the oncolytic adenovirus Delta 24 -RGD. The apoptosis and cytotoxicity assays did not unequivocally detect responses and were excluded from further testing.

40|$|Despite {{advances}} in cancer treatments, cancer is still ranked the second {{leading cause of}} death. Cancers are started by cancer stem cells (CSCs). CSCs, also called tumor-initiating cells, are found in tumors and {{are responsible for the}} growth of tumors and the spread of cancer {{to other parts of the}} body. CSCs are very resistant, and cannot be killed by chemotherapy or radiation treatments. These cells can come from healthy stem cells. The environment surrounding the healthy stem cells and mature cells can cause mutations in the cellâ€™s genetics, resulting in development of CSCs. The environment can also increase tumor resistance to drugs. During preliminary experiments in our laboratory, we have found how the culture environment leads to mutation of human brain cancer cells. The cancer cells were also found to be drug-resistant and have the ability to change shape to resemble colonies of other stem cells. In this project, we hypothesized that stressful conditions cause normal cells to change into CSCs capable of travelling throughout the body. To test the hypothesis, we attempted to examine which environmental changes cause conversion of cancer cells to CSCs.

These results verify that serum starvation and culture to <b>confluency</b> are efficient means of synchronizing bovine somatic cells in G 0 / G 1, and indicate that a more efficient synchronization of the cells in G 0 / G 1 can be established by incubation for a limited time period after trypsinization of serum-starved or confluent cells...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{relationship}} between the intracellular concentration of various nucleotides as measured by high-performance liquid chromatography analysis, and the differentiation of 2 human colon cancer cell lines was studied. HT- 29 cells were induced to undergo both structural and functional enterocytic differentiation (as determined by electron microscopy {{and the presence of}} brush-border specific enzymes, respectively) by changing the carbon source or adding Na butyrate to standard tissue culture media. This differentiation occurred after the cells reached <b>confluency</b> when they were cultured in galactose, uridine, inosine, or without nucleosides (all in the absence of glucose) and in the presence of glucose plus Na butyrate. Cells cultured in 25 mM fructose or glucose +/- nucleosides did not differentiate. In all culture conditions where HT- 29 cells did not differentite, the intracellular concentrations of 2 compounds which co-migrated with UDP-N-acetylglucosamine and UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine rose approximately equal to 10 -fold at <b>confluency</b> and remained elevated throughout the stationary phase, whereas their concentrations remained constant and low after <b>confluency</b> in cells that underwent differentiation. This indicated that the accumulation of these compounds is associated with the inability of these cells to differentiate since other nucleotides and nucleotide sugars did not change in a similar fashion. Purification of the presumed UDP-N-acetylhexosamines, followed by the identification of the products from their chemical and enzymatic hydrolysis, confirmed the identity of these two peaks. Nucleotide analysis of Caco- 2 cells, which undergo enterocytic differentiation after they reach <b>confluency</b> even when cultured on glucose, revealed the same pattern of UDP-N-acetylhexosamine levels as differentiated HT- 29 cells, with its concentration remaining relatively constant and very low, even after the cells were confluent. The significance of the accumulation of UDP-N-acetylhexosamines in cells unable to differentiate is discussed...|$|E
