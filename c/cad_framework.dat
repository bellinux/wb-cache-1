One of the difficulties in realizing this overall goal is the wide variation in requirements for modeling the information associated with each of these services, and the rough or nonexistent interfaces between them. One such gray area is the conceptual gap between tool invocation and higher level design methodology management. To address this issue, we have introduced the notion of tool-independent CAD tasks as an intermediate representation. A new information model, called the task schema, is used to capture the dependencies between classes of tool and data objects for a given design domain.

40|$|The rising {{complexity}} of interconnect and packaging structures in VLSI systems {{has increased the}} necessity of applying modeling and simulation techniques for analysis and design. To effectively manage design data and CAD tools for modeling and simulations of electronic packaging, a framework which provides different levels of services is essential. This paper discusses a computer-aided design framework for the aforementioned purposes. A <b>CAD</b> <b>framework</b> with a five layered architecture is developed to support the analysis and design for VLSI packaging and interconnects. The first layer of the framework emphasizes the fundamental integration of CAD tools and simulation management. In the second layer of the architecture, design data representation and management are stressed. Two design databases termed the Chip Model Library and the Packaging Model Library are developed and coupled in this layer. We applied an object-oriented approach to implement libraries and encapsulate CAD tools. System level (board level) modeling and simulation are presented in the third layer of the framework. CMOS based multichip modules (MCMs) are used for our discussion. The fourth layer is for the automation of design process by coordinating different CAD tools. The highest layer in the proposed <b>CAD</b> <b>framework</b> is the level for design methodology management.

40|$|We present MEADE, a Modular, Extensible, Adaptable Design Environment. MEADE {{has been}} {{developed}} to answer {{the need for an}} adaptive design framework for encapsulation of Computer Aided Design (CAD) tools and management of the massive amounts of data associated with the design process. Other frameworks have existed but lacked the critical open source requirement that enables rapid adaptation to a rapidly advancing design methodology. While the initial application and development of MEADE is targeted toward ASIC and FPGA design, the MEADE engine can be easily adapted to abstract any procedural application. MEADE allows the definition of procedures, which are defined as some sequence or flow of actions, which can be performed by potentially multiple different agents. With this system, design methodology management is specified in the procedures. Tool interoperability is handled by the action definitions. The unique agents perform tool interchangeability (the use of “best-inclass” tools). All details of procedure implementation are extended outside of the MEADE microkernel to the individual agent modules (Source code control, code builds, multi-user simulations, etc.). With an open, extensible system, the design community will be able to integrate specific design flows and account for sitespecific variances. Additionally, new CAD tools can be rapidly integrated into a design flow for effective evaluation. It is believed that the simple modular interface and open-source philosophy will enable MEADE to succeed where other <b>CAD</b> <b>frameworks</b> have failed...|$|R
40|$|As design {{systems have}} grown in {{complexity}} and clock speeds are constantly increasing, sev-eral limitations to the conceptual framework of synchronous design have begun to be noticed. Some notable problems due to higher performance demand are clock skew, power dissipation, interfacing di culties and worst case performance. It is therefore not a surprise that the area of asynchronous circuits and systems, which generally do not su er from these problems, is experiencing a signi cant resurgence of interest and research activity. However,anumber of important problems have to be solved before asynchronous design methods can be success-fully transferred to the CAD industry. First, asynchronous circuit design {{should be based on}} high level synthesis methods that are based on standard HDLs, the same basis as used for synchronous circuits. Second, tools to synthesize asynchronous circuits should be capable of handling and generating e cient implementations for reasonably large designs, such as the ones found in high-level synthesis benchmarks. This requires a method that o ers exibility to use di erent signaling protocols, to decompose large centralized controllers and to take advantage of advances in standard logic synthesis. Third, where e ciency is critical, {{it should be possible to}} obtain customized complex-gate based circuits.
