In {{this paper}} we present some channel {{measurement}} results of distributed multiple-input multiple-output (D-MIMO) systems inside a MD- 82 aircraft. Channel capacity and spatial correlation are analyzed from the measured channel matrix. Capacity results of 7 different systems (six D-MIMO systems and a SISO system) are discussed. It is found that D-MIMO systems yield significant capacity gains {{as compared to}} SISO system. Spatial correlations among transmitter (Tx) antennas distributed above the <b>cabin</b> <b>aisle</b> are statistically analyzed from the measured data. Result shows that, when receiver (Rx) antenna array {{is placed in the}} front or back of the cabin, some Tx antenna pairs are highly correlative (correlation coefficients are higher than 0. 8). The effect of Tx antenna selection on capacity characteristic of in-cabin D-MIMO system is also studied. It is found that Tx antenna selection can further improve channel capacity and the optimum selected Tx antennas are usually the ones near to the Rx array. 漏 2012 IEEE...|$|E
40|$|Release {{of ammonia}} into the International Space Station (ISS) cabin {{atmosphere}} can occur if the water/ammonia barrier {{breach of the}} active thermal control system (ATCS) interface heat exchanger (IFHX) happens. After IFHX breach liquid ammonia is introduced into the water-filled internal thermal control system (ITCS) {{and then to the}} cabin environment through a ruptured gas trap. Once the liquid water/ammonia mixture exits ITCS, it instantly vaporizes and mixes with the U. S. Laboratory cabin air that results in rapid deterioration of the cabin conditions. The goal of the study is to assess ammonia propagation in the Station after IFHX breach to plan the operation procedure. A Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model for accurate prediction of airflow and ammonia transport within each of the modules in the ISS cabin was developed. CFD data on ammonia content in the <b>cabin</b> <b>aisle</b> way of the ISS and, in particular, in the Russian On- Orbit Segment during the period of 15 minutes after gas trap rupture are presented for four scenarios of rupture response. Localized effects of ammonia dispersion and risk mitigation are discussed...|$|E

50|$|The F24 {{as it was}} proposed, was a {{short-range}} all-metal twin-engine passenger aircraft. It {{was supposed}} to be powered by two Wright Cyclone radial engines of 1,193 kW (1,600 hp) each. Its fuselage was designed for 26 passengers. The single <b>aisle</b> <b>cabin</b> layout had eight rows of two abreast on the right and eight rows of a single seat on the left. A cargo bay was put between the passenger cabin and the cockpit. This cockpit had a layout for a crew of four. In the middle of the passenger cabin was a galley. At the aft side of the cabin was a toilet with another cargo bay.|$|R

Single aisles are handicapped by lengthy boarding and deboarding times. Aircraft with twin <b>aisle</b> <b>cabin</b> layout may alleviate the boarding problem.

40|$|The International Space Station (ISS) United States Operational Segment (USOS) {{has four}} {{permanent}} rack sized ISS Crew Quarters (CQ) providing a private crewmember space. The CQ uses Node 2 cabin air for ventilation/thermal cooling, {{as opposed to}} conditioned ducted air from the ISS Temperature Humidity Control System or the ISS fluid cooling loop connections. Consequently, CQ can only increase the air flow rate to reduce the temperature delta between the cabin and the CQ interior. However, increasing airflow causes increased acoustic noise so efficient airflow distribution is an important design parameter. The CQ utilized a two fan push-pull configuration to ensure fresh air at the crewmember s head position and reduce acoustic exposure. The CQ interior needs to be below Noise Curve 40 (NC- 40). The CQ ventilation ducts {{are open to the}} significantly louder Node 2 <b>cabin</b> <b>aisle</b> way which required significantly acoustic mitigation controls. The design implementation of the CQ ventilation system and acoustic mitigation are very inter-related and require consideration of crew comfort balanced with use of interior habitable volume, accommodation of fan failures, and possible crew uses that impact ventilation and acoustic performance. This paper illustrates the types of model analysis, assumptions, vehicle interactions, and trade-offs required for CQ ventilation and acoustics. Additionally, on-orbit ventilation system performance and initial crew feedback is presented. This approach is applicable to any private enclosed space that the crew will occupy...|$|E
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Mechanical and Nuclear EngineeringMohammad H. HosniByron W. JonesIn 2010, over 786 million {{passengers}} flew {{on commercial}} flights in the United States {{according to the}} Bureau of Transportation Statistics (2011). With the average flight length over 1300 miles for domestic flights, this amounts to billions of hours spent aboard airliners by passengers each year. During these flights, diseases and other harmful contaminates, some malicious, can spread throughout aircraft cabins, harming passengers. Aircraft ventilation systems are designed to remove these harmful contaminates {{as quickly as possible}} to minimize spread in cabin air. Disruptions to the design airflow pattern can hinder the effectiveness of contamination removal efforts. A common form of this airflow disruption is longitudinal air movement through cabin aisles. To examine the effect of contaminate transport down aircraft aisles by a moving body, a motorized beverage cart is past by a contamination source as it traverses the length of the <b>cabin</b> <b>aisle.</b> An experimental study is performed in a mockup Boeing 767 cabin section consisting of eleven rows with seven seats per row. Carbon Dioxide (CO 2) tracer gas is injected at a constant flow rate at a location of interest until concentrations in the cabin reach steady state. Ventilation equipment and flow rates representative of an actual aircraft are used for all experiments. Seats in the mockup are occupied by thermal manikins to simulate passenger heat load. A motorized beverage cart traverses the length of the <b>cabin</b> <b>aisle</b> passing by the injection location. The concentrations of tracer gas displaced by the cart are measured at locations throughout the cabin. Comparing these measurements to baseline readings taken with no cart movement, a map {{of the degree to which}} contaminant transport is affected by the beverage cart is calculated. The cabin mockup is supplied by 100 % outdoor air through actual Boeing supply ductwork and linear diffusers along the cabin length above the aisles. The CO 2 level is measured in the inlet air, measurement locations in the cabin, and exhaust air using nondispersive infrared (NDIR) sensors. Measured results are reported for all (54) seat locations downstream of the cart traverse/injection location for an injection location near the rear of the cabin. Analogous measurements are also conducted examining the effect of variations in cart speed and modified injection location. It was found the beverage cart movement had an effect of up to a 35 % increase in tracer gas concentration relative to the local steady state concentration for several seat locations adjacent to the aisle. This increased concentration continued for only a few minutes in all cases, but was generally less than the steady state exposure one row closer to the injection location. Moving in the lateral direction away from the aisle, the variance in tracer gas concentration due to the cart movement diminished quickly. The significance of increased concentration for such short periods of time in comparison to the length of actual commercial flights may require further biological analysis. The data showed general tracer gas concentration increases due to cart movement in a small section of the cabin mockup which could warrant further analysis, but increases were generally insignificant when considering entire flight contamination exposure levels...|$|E

50|$|The new {{wide-body}} aircraft uses an oval fuselage configuration. The chosen form ensures minimal dimensions for {{the aircraft}} with 300-350 passengers in three <b>cabins,</b> three main <b>aisles,</b> {{no less than}} 500 mm (20 inches) wide and spaces between seats no less than 810 mm (32 inches). In an all-economy layout, the number of seats can be increased to 400. The aircraft can accommodate 302 passengers in a basic three-class layout (Business Class, Premium Economy and Economy). In 2015 the company and project engineers were relocated from Moscow to an undisclosed non-EU European country in order to seek flight certification from EASA rather than Russia, since this offered savings due to the host country determining certification authority. Russian standards are lower and not yet harmonized with EASA/FAA {{and if it was}} based in Russia it would have to repeat at least 30% of qualifying flights for EASA to receive a European flight certification as well as meeting more stringent design standards. If the company were based in an EASA country it could receive EASA and FAA dual certification from a single test program. Sergey Grachev, director of marketing sales for the Frigate Ecojet stated 'It is impossible to develop and create this kind of aircraft here'. The company still intends to perform its first flight in 2018 or 2019 and enter into service in 2021.When moving to Europe the company will also seek to harmonize cockpit design with a competitor to reduce pilot training costs.|$|R
40|$|This work {{assessed}} Hybrid Wing Body (HWB) {{aircraft in}} the context of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) fuel usage and payload/range scalability at three scales: H 1 (B 737), H 2 (B 787) and H 3 (B 777). The aircraft were optimized for reduced fuel burn and airframe noise at approach, based on NASA N+ 3 goals for the 2030 timeframe. Well-to-wake greenhouse gas emissions for LNG from conventional sources were estimated to be 16 % lower than conventional Jet A. Minimally insulated in-wing storage was shown to reduce HWB wing loading and improve fuel burn by 7 - 12 %. Improvements were based on 16 % higher fuel specific energy, 17 % lower skin friction drag through wall cooling on the wing bottom and 11 - 16 % lower SFC through alternative cycles. Considerations were made for 1 % insulation/fuel weight and 39 % additional fuel volume but secondary systems and icing issues were not examined. Though technologically viable, significant developmental hurdles, infrastructure demands and safety risks would need to be overcome before these benefits could be achieved. The global optimization framework was presented using a hybrid genetic algorithm for simultaneous optimization of airframe/propulsion/operations. Due to <b>cabin</b> <b>aisle</b> height restrictions, unusable white" space for the H 1 designs resulted in excessive empty weight fractions. However the design achieves 45 % lower fuel burn than the B 737 - 800 due to its all lifting configuration, advanced propulsion system and assumed structural advancements. The H 2 and H 3 designs mitigated this drawback by carrying increased payload in a larger, more efficiently packaged centerbody with H 3 fuel burn being 52 - 56 % lower than the B 777 - 200 LR. However as airport span constraints for the B 777 class aircraft were reached, the scaling performance was observed to asymptote with lower improvement from H 2 to H 3, as compared from H 1 to H 2. by Pritesh Mody.
