5|$|Justification {{for using}} the Sunnah {{as a source of}} law {{can be found in the}} Qur'an. The Qur'an {{commands}} Muslims to follow Muhammad. During his lifetime, Muhammad made it clear that his traditions (along with the Qur'an) should be followed after his death. The overwhelming majority of Muslims consider the sunnah to be essential supplements to and <b>clarifications</b> of the Qur'an. In Islamic jurisprudence, the Qur'an contains many rules for the behavior expected of Muslims but there are no specific Qur'anic rules on many religious and practical matters. Muslims believe that they can look at the way of life, or sunnah, of Muhammad and his companions to discover what to imitate and what to avoid.|$|E

5|$|The First Folio text of 1623 {{was based}} {{primarily}} on Q3, with <b>clarifications</b> and corrections possibly coming from a theatrical prompt book or Q1. Other Folio editions of the play were printed in 1632 (F2), 1664 (F3), and 1685 (F4). Modern versions—that take into account several of the Folios and Quartos—first appeared with Nicholas Rowe's 1709 edition, followed by Alexander Pope's 1723 version. Pope began a tradition of editing the play to add information such as stage directions missing in Q2 by locating them in Q1. This tradition continued late into the Romantic period.

5|$|The {{historian}} N. J. Higham {{suggests that}} a synod, or ecclesiastical conference to discuss church affairs and rules, was held at London {{during the early years}} of the mission, possibly shortly after 603. Boniface, an Anglo-Saxon native who became a missionary to the continental Saxons, mentions such a synod being held at London. Boniface says that the synod legislated on marriage, which he discussed with Pope Gregory III in 742. Higham argues that because Augustine had asked for <b>clarifications</b> on the subject of marriage from Gregory the Great, it is likely that he could have held a synod to deliberate on the issue. Nicholas Brooks, another historian, is not so sure that there was such a synod, but does not completely rule out the possibility. He suggests it might have been that Boniface was influenced by a recent reading of Bede's work.|$|E

In three Web surveys, the use and positioning of <b>clarification</b> features were tested in open-ended questions, with three different positions being experimentally varied: before the question stem, after the question stem, and after the answer box. Results indicated that contrary to expectations, the optimal position of <b>clarification</b> features did not differ depending on the respective stage of the question-answer process. <b>Clarification</b> features were principally most effective when they were positioned after the question stem, whereas <b>clarification</b> features placed before the question stem were least effective in improving the quality of responses...|$|R

Using a crowd-sourcing tool [7], we collect a dataset of user responses to <b>clarification</b> questions when presented with sentences in which some words are missing. We find that, in over 60 % of cases, users choose to continue the conversation without asking a <b>clarification</b> question. However, when users do ask a question, our findings support earlier research showing that users are more likely to ask a targeted <b>clarification</b> question than a generic question. Using the dataset we have collected, we are exploring machine learning approaches for determining which system responses are most appropriate in different contexts and developing strategies for constructing <b>clarification</b> questions. 1 Index Terms: <b>clarification,</b> questio...|$|R

40|$|We model human {{responses}} to speech recognition errors from a corpus of human <b>clarification</b> strategies. We employ learning techniques to study 1) {{the decision to}} either stop and ask a <b>clarification</b> question or to continue the dialogue without <b>clarification,</b> and 2) the decision to ask a targeted <b>clarification</b> question or a more generic question. Targeted <b>clarification</b> questions focus specifically {{on the part of}} an utterance that is misrecognized, in contrast with generic requests to ‘please repeat’ or ‘please rephrase’. Our goal is to generate targeted <b>clarification</b> strategies for handling errors in spoken dialogue systems, when appropriate. Our experiments show that linguistic features, in particular the inferred part-ofspeech of a misrecognized word are predictive of human <b>clarification</b> decisions. A combination of linguistic features predicts a user’s decision to continue or stop a dialogue with accuracy of 72. 8 % over a majority baseline accuracy of 59. 1 %.
