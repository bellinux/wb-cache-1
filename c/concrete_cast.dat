25|$|Whiteread {{was one of}} the Young British Artists who {{exhibited}} at the Royal Academy's Sensation exhibition in 1997. Among her most renowned works are House, a large <b>concrete</b> <b>cast</b> of the inside of an entire Victorian house, the holocaust memorial sculpture in Judenplatz Vienna and her resin sculpture for the empty plinth in London's Trafalgar Square.|$|E
25|$|House, {{perhaps her}} best known work, was a <b>concrete</b> <b>cast</b> {{of the inside}} of an entire Victorian terraced house {{completed}} in autumn 1993, exhibited {{at the location of}} the original house – 193 Grove Road – in East London (all the houses in the street had earlier been knocked down by the council). It drew mixed responses, winning her both the Turner Prize for best young British artist in 1993 and the K Foundation art award for worst British artist. She was the first woman to win a Turner Prize. Tower Hamlets London Borough Council demolished House on 11 January 1994, a decision which caused some controversy itself.|$|E

Firstly, in order to check the ability ofweldings before casting, tensile tests were performed on specimens reproducing different types of welded joints. Simplified design formulae were used to predict their ultimate strength. Secondly, results obtained by push-out tests on specimen representative of the beambefore and after the <b>concrete</b> <b>casting</b> are presented and discussed. Finally, simplified analytical models proposed by the current European building codewere adapted to the specific typology to roughly predict the ultimate strength obtained by push-out tests on specimens complete with <b>concrete</b> <b>casting...</b>|$|R
40|$|Construction {{injuries}} lead {{to human}} tragedies, disrupt construction processes and adversely affect the cost, productivity, and {{the reputation of}} the construction industry. Therefore, the use of ergonomic production methods to prevent this can have a significant human, social and financial impact. This paper presents a case study of comparative analyses of ergonomic situations for concrete workers performing <b>concrete</b> <b>casting</b> processes. Ergonomic risk assessment methods were used to assess the physical strain, hand-arm vibration and noise affects risks involved in <b>concrete</b> <b>casting</b> work tasks. The combination of technical and managerial factors results in a system where workers are as efficient and safe as possible during their work tasks, and thus, makes the construction work environment sustainable. The preliminary study presented in this paper concludes that the present ergonomic risks emanating from work methods used in the normally vibrated <b>concrete</b> (NVC) <b>casting</b> can be significantly reduced. With the use of self-compacting concrete (SCC) awkward work postures, hand-arm vibration and noise are eliminated. Thus musculoskeletal injuries can be reduced if not eliminated among concrete workers during their <b>concrete</b> <b>casting</b> work tasks. Godkänd; 2009; 20090929 (rorw...|$|R
25|$|Tbilisi obtains {{most of its}} {{drinking}} water from the basin of the Aragvi River north of the city. Groundwater (60% of the total) is pumped from well fields, while surface water (40%) is mostly obtained from the reservoir of the Zhinvali Dam 42km from the city. The water is treated in two plants: the Samgori plant built in the 1950s and the Grmagele plant, located at the Zhinvali Dam, built in the 1980s. The length of the water distribution network in Tbilisi is 3,600km. About 35% of the main network is made of iron pipes and 65% of steel pipes. Polyethylene pipes have been installed only recently. There are 84 reservoirs and 169 pumps. The sewer network consists of 1,600km of pipes made of ceramic, reinforced <b>concrete,</b> <b>cast</b> iron, asbestos cement and polyethylene. The wastewater is transferred by trunk sewer with a length of 72km to the Gardabani {{waste water treatment plant}} commissioned in 1979 with a capacity of 1 million m3/day. The biological treatment at the plant is not in operation due to its high energy consumption and the associated high cost. The untreated wastewater is discharged into the Kura River.|$|E

40|$|This {{report will}} try to {{evaluate}} the use of rented <b>concrete</b> <b>casting</b> moulds, which are used to build walls and system of joists. The evaluation is only examining the economical aspects. The cost of using <b>concrete</b> <b>casting</b> moulds {{is a big part of}} the total production expenses. Therefore it is important that the calculated price not exceeds the final costs of the casting moulds. The calculated price is the price used in the process of making an offer. The evaluation consists of a comparison of the calculated price and the final costs for three building projects. It also evaluates the exploitation of the <b>concrete</b> <b>casting</b> moulds for each project. The report is made by Sven Gynne and Anders Alexandersson at School of Engineering, Jonkoping University, in cooperation with PEAB Jonkoping. The evaluation is strictly based on the calculated price and final cost of rented <b>concrete</b> <b>casting</b> moulds, only the moulds themselves, not the labour costs. Educational visits have been made to the three projects gathering facts. The conclusions we have drawn are that the difference between the calculated price and the final costs are considerable, especially one project have a greater difference than the others. The reasons for that are among other things tight building ground and a complicated building construction...|$|R

40|$|Construction of Micropiles using Pressure TechniquesABSTRACT: This paper {{discusses}} {{the technique of}} <b>casting</b> <b>concrete</b> of Micropiles with pressures and the consequence of comparisons with normal way of <b>casting</b> <b>concrete</b> (<b>casting</b> with gravity). Preliminary geotechnical studies {{have been made in}} specific area in Sudan to predict the soil parameters, and then an experimental work has been done for an estimated number of Micropiles with different diameters and different techniques of placing concrete with various amount of pressure. This study was carried out to learn the usefulness of this technique in the field of structural foundations in Sudan. Capacities of Micropiles were compared in cases of non-pressure casting (normal way of <b>casting</b> <b>concrete)</b> and pressure <b>casting.</b> Through the results, {{it was found that the}} entry of pressure factor in the operation of <b>casting</b> <b>concrete</b> increases the capacities of Micropiles.

Wet <b>cast</b> <b>concrete</b> with 4% to 6% entrained air normally can withstand numerous freeze-thaw cycles without failing. Other types of admixtures such as water-reducers, super plasticizers and the new self-compacting additives can add to improving the strength and durability of wet <b>cast</b> <b>concrete</b> products. <b>Cast</b> stone products manufactured by the wet cast method are required to meet the same standards as VDT cast products.|$|R
