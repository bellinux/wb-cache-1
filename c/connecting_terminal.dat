5|$|State Route 47 (SR 47) is a {{state highway}} in the U.S. state of California, <b>connecting</b> <b>Terminal</b> Island to the {{mainland}} in the Los Angeles area. From its south end at I-110 in San Pedro, it heads east across the Vincent Thomas Bridge to the island {{and the end of}} state maintenance. The state highway begins again at the junction with I-710 on Terminal Island, crossing the Schuyler Heim Bridge north to the mainland and the second terminus, where SR 103 begins. Signage continues along a locally maintained route, mainly Alameda Street, to the Gardena Freeway (SR 91) in Compton, and an unconstructed alignment follows the same corridor to the Santa Monica Freeway (I-10) near downtown Los Angeles.|$|E

In this paper, we examine agent messaging on small devices based on our experiences with MicroFIPA-OS, which is an agent toolkit for small devices. Since agents communicate by sending and receiving messages, it is reasonable to expect that the system should minimize communication latency both within a platform and between agent platforms. We present and discuss different deployment options for <b>connecting</b> <b>terminal</b> agents with the fixed network agent community. The performance measurement focuses on messaging both within the PDA device and between the device and another external agent platform...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} drawing a set of simple paths {{along the edges of}} an embedded underlying graph G = (V, E), so that the total number of crossings among pairs of paths is minimized. This problem arises when drawing metro maps, where the embedding of G depicts the structure of the underlying network, the nodes of G correspond to train stations, an edge connecting two nodes implies that there exists a railway line which connects them, whereas the paths illustrate the lines <b>connecting</b> <b>terminal</b> stations. We call this the metro-line crossing minimization problem (MLCM). In contrast to the problem of drawing the underlying graph nicely, MLCM has received fewer attention. It was recently introduced by Benkert et. al in [4]. In this paper, as a first step towards solving MLCM in arbitrary graphs, we study path and tree networks. We examine several variations of the problem for which we develop algorithms for obtaining optimal solutions...|$|E
