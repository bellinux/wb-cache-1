50|$|Hermetic vs. Water-Proof vs. Water-Resistant {{refers to}} the {{coupling}} seal between the contacts, <b>connector</b> <b>insert</b> and body. A true hermetic connector provides an airtight seal and can support and maintain positive pressure or a vacuum. Waterproof connectors prevent liquid ingress when immersed {{using a variety of}} methods (e.g., molding, potting and encapsulating) to prevent water intrusion at high hydrostatic pressures. Water resistant implies that a coupled connector will prevent water ingress that can lead to shorting in shallow standing water or rain. Typically this is achieved by inserting rubber gaskets and compression seals at the contract region {{as well as at the}} cable entry.|$|E

50|$|PS/2 {{connectors}} are {{not designed}} to be plugged in and out very often, {{which can lead to}} bent or broken pins. PS/2 <b>connectors</b> <b>insert</b> in only one direction and must be rotated correctly before attempting connection. Most but not all connectors include an arrow or flat section which is usually aligned to the right or top of the jack before being plugged in. The exact direction may vary on older or non-ATX computers and care should be taken to avoid damaged or bent pins when connecting devices. This issue is slightly alleviated in modern times {{with the advent of the}} PS/2-to-USB adapter: users can just leave a PS/2 connector plugged into the PS/2-to-USB adapter at all times and not risk damaging the pins this way. A USB-to-PS/2 adapter does not have this problem.|$|R

2500|$|Problems {{with the}} 10NES lockout chip {{frequently}} {{resulted in the}} console's most infamous problem: the blinking red power light, in which the system appears to turn itself on and off repeatedly because the 10NES would reset the console once per second. The lockout chip required constant communication with the chip in the game to work. Dirty, aging and bent connectors would often disrupt the communication, resulting in the blink effect. Alternatively, the console would turn on but only show a solid white, gray, or green screen. Users attempted {{to solve this problem}} by blowing air onto the cartridge <b>connectors,</b> <b>inserting</b> the cartridge just far enough to get the ZIF to lower, licking the edge connector, slapping the side of the system after inserting a cartridge, shifting the cartridge from side to side after insertion, pushing the ZIF up and down repeatedly, holding the ZIF down lower than it should have been, and cleaning the connectors with alcohol. These attempted solutions often became notable in their own right and are often remembered alongside the NES. Many of the most frequent attempts to fix this problem instead ran the risk of damaging the cartridge and/or system.

40|$|Fittings called start {{connectors}} {{are usually}} employed to attach each lateral to its corresponding manifold in microirrigation systems. The protrusion of start connectors’ barbs into the manifold induces pressure losses due to contraction and subsequent enlargement of streamlines. In addition, when water flows from a manifold toward a lateral through a start connector, a sudden contraction followed by expansions of flow streamlines cause pressure loss whose intensity {{is influenced by}} connector’s geometry. Minor losses along manifolds or at laterals inlet due to start connectors may be significant and might be considered on subunits design or while undertaking hydraulic simulations. The objectives of this research were: (a) to develop equations based on dimensional analysis to estimate minor losses due to start connectors; (b) to compare {{the accuracy of the}} developed models against models that are currently used for estimating minor losses; (c) to undertake simulations to assess the relevance of minor losses due to start connectors in hydraulics of subunits. Minor losses due to start connectors were separated into two components. A model was developed and validated to estimate minor losses due to the protrusion of start <b>connectors</b> <b>inserted</b> along a manifold. Two models were developed and validated to estimate minor losses that occur when water flows from a manifold into a lateral line through a start connector. The required data to develop and validate the models were obtained experimentally in laboratory. Although minor losses due to start connectors represented a relative small percentage of total head losses, such effects may be significant while undertaking rigorous hydraulic simulations that require accurate estimation of pressure losses.

5000|$|Due to the {{relatively}} high signal voltages used in SCART, [...] "hot plugging" [...] (connecting or disconnecting devices while they are on) is not recommended. Although there is no risk of personal injury, {{there is the possibility}} of damaging electronics within the devices if the <b>connector</b> is <b>inserted</b> improperly. Also, since many TVs are Class II (double-insulated) rather than earthed, the large exposed shield on the SCART connector will be held at approximately half mains voltage if it is plugged into a powered TV with the other end unplugged. If the cable is then plugged into an earthed device with a metal case, inadvertent contact with the SCART cable shield while the earthed device is touched with the other hand can cause a painful electric shock. For this reason the device end of the cable should always be plugged in first and the TV end plugged in last.|$|R
