Not only does this computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) allow for the customization of mass-produced objects, it also enables a much higher level of precision and fit - qualities critical for modules to be physically joined together.

40|$|Introduction: Diffuse esophageal leiomyomatosis {{is a rare}} disease. Misdiagnosis is {{frequent}} and previous surgeries can complicate surgical management. The only treatment described for severe symptomatic cases is esophagectomy. Presentation of case: We describe a case of diffuse esophageal leiomyomatosis associated with Alport syndrome in a 21 year-old female where endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) with concomitant fluoroscopy and 3 D-gastric computed tomography (3 D-GCT) modified surgical management. Discussion: The diagnosis of diffuse esophageal leiomyomatosis is difficult but <b>can</b> be <b>greatly</b> <b>facilitated</b> by extensive endoscopic and radiologic workup. Esophagectomy should only be entertained after complete anatomic mapping of the lesions, especially after previous surgeries.
