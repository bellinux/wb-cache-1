40|$|Exposure of {{military}} and civilian populations to inhaled toxic chemicals can take place {{as a result of}} deliberate release (warfare, terrorism) or following accidental releases from industrial concerns or transported chemicals. Exposure to inhaled toxic chemicals can result in an acute lung injury, and in severe cases acute respiratory distress syndrome, for which there is currently no specific medical therapy, treatment remaining largely supportive. This treatment often requires intensive care facilities that may become overwhelmed in mass casualty events and may be of limited benefit in severe cases. There remains, therefore, a need for evidence-based treatment to inform both military and <b>civilian</b> medical <b>response</b> <b>teams</b> on the most appropriate treatment for chemically induced lung injury. This article reviews data used to derive potential clinical management strategies for chemically induced lung injury...|$|R
40|$|You can’t {{fight in}} here, {{this is the}} War room! Dr. Strangelove When {{emergency}} situations cross borders, or when newly formed groups need to work together, decision making can suffer from threat rigidity and pertinent information can be bypassed. We describe a Dynamic Delphi system under development that can create and sustain a group “voice ” for an emergency response Community of Practice (CoP). We further describe its intended use for a CoP consisting of local, state and federal government responders, <b>civilian</b> emergency <b>response</b> <b>teams</b> (CERT), and volunteers. Community members can brainstorm, explore ideas, debate and vote iteratively to best reflect the group's opinion at any moment in time. Ongoing studies demonstrate that an online system implementing Dynamic Delphi characteristics along with Thurstone's Law of Comparative Judgment will prove conducive for building a repertoire of ideas, rules, policies or any other aspect of the community's 'voice', {{in such a way}} that the individual voices are juxtaposed in harmony to create a single song. * This paper is based upon a presentation at the Pre-ICIS 07 Workshop Web 2007 : Social Computing Applications...|$|R
