50|$|RESULTS: The {{multiple}} baseline <b>case</b> <b>study</b> <b>design</b> {{was used}} to evaluate the impact of wraparound by assessing whether outcome change occurred with (and only with) the introduction of wraparound at different points in time. The authors tracked occurrence of five behaviors (compliance, peer interactions, physical aggression, alcohol and drug use, and extreme verbal abuse) for each of the youths. Participants began receiving wraparound after 12, 15, 19, and 22 weeks. For all four participants, on all five behaviors, dramatic improvements occurred immediately following the introduction of wraparound.|$|E
50|$|An {{embedded}} {{case study}} is a case study containing more than one sub-unit of analysis (Yin, 2003). Similar to a case study, an embedded case study methodology provides a means of integrating quantitative and qualitative methods into a single research study (Scholz & Tietje, 2002; Yin 2003). However, the identification of sub-units allows {{for a more detailed}} level of inquiry. The embedded <b>case</b> <b>study</b> <b>design</b> is an empirical form of inquiry appropriate for descriptive studies, where the goal is to describe the features, context, and process of a phenomenon. Roland W. Scholz suggests that “case is faceted or embedded in a conceptual grid” which allows to identify key components of human and environmental systems (Scholz 2011, p. 25).|$|E
50|$|The {{results of}} a {{scientific}} study published in 2008reflect a lack of improvement in language using the Tomatis Method for children with autism. However, in 2010 Jan Gerittsen conducted a detailed case analysis of Corbet's reported findings on children on the Autism Spectrum Disorder. Gerittsen showed that for this particular research an individual <b>case</b> <b>study</b> <b>design</b> {{would have been the}} more appropriate research design method. His individual case study analysis captured with higher fidelity the effect of Tomatis Method in each of the participant. Given individual differences of children on the Autism Spectrum a group design study could omit to address the significant improvements which Gerittsen noted occurred in 60 % {{of the participants in the}} areas of language, daily living skills, social interaction and motor skills.|$|E
30|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to highlight similarities and differences across various <b>case</b> <b>study</b> <b>designs</b> and to analyze their respective contributions to theory. Although different designs reveal some common underlying characteristics, a comparison of such <b>case</b> <b>study</b> research <b>designs</b> demonstrates that <b>case</b> <b>study</b> research incorporates different scientific goals and collection and analysis of data. This paper relates this comparison to a more general debate of how different research designs contribute to a theory continuum. The fine-grained analysis demonstrates that <b>case</b> <b>study</b> <b>designs</b> fit differently to the pathway of the theory continuum. The resulting contribution is a portfolio of <b>case</b> <b>study</b> research <b>designs.</b> This portfolio demonstrates the heterogeneous contributions of <b>case</b> <b>study</b> <b>designs.</b> Based on this portfolio, theoretical contributions of <b>case</b> <b>study</b> <b>designs</b> can be better evaluated in terms of understanding, theory-building, theory development, and theory testing.|$|R
30|$|As a result, it is {{unlikely}} that the specified <b>case</b> <b>study</b> <b>designs</b> contribute to theory in a homogeneous manner. This result will be discussed in light of the question regarding how these <b>case</b> <b>study</b> <b>designs</b> can inform theory at several points of a continuum of theory. This analysis will be outlined in the following sections. In a first step, I review the main elements of a theory continuum. In a second step, I discuss the respective contribution of the previously identified <b>case</b> <b>study</b> research <b>designs</b> to the theory continuum.|$|R
30|$|First, {{differences}} between <b>case</b> <b>study</b> research <b>designs</b> are depicted.

These differences result in a portfolio of various <b>case</b> <b>study</b> research <b>designs.</b>|$|R
40|$|Although the {{advantages}} of <b>case</b> <b>study</b> <b>design</b> are widely recognised, its original positivist underlying assumptions may mislead interpretive researchers aiming at theory building.

30|$|A <b>case</b> <b>study</b> <b>design</b> {{was deemed}} to be {{appropriate}} as the research aimed to investigate the specific, contemporary phenomenon of video blogging within a situated context at the university (Yin 2013).

30|$|What {{is missing}} is a {{comparison}} of <b>case</b> <b>study</b> research <b>designs</b> with regard to differences in the contribution to theory. <b>Case</b> <b>study</b> <b>designs</b> have different purposes in theory contribution. Confusing these potential contributions by inconsistently utilizing the appropriate methods weakens the contribution of <b>case</b> <b>studies</b> to scientific progress and, by that, damages the reputation of <b>case</b> <b>studies.</b>|$|R

40|$|Context: A {{case study}} is a {{powerful}} research strategy for investigating complex social-technical and managerial phenomena in real life settings. However, when the phenomenon has not been fully discovered or understood, pilot case studies are important to refine the research problem, the research variables, and the <b>case</b> <b>study</b> <b>design</b> before launching a full-scale investigation. The role of pilot case studies has not been fully addressed in empirical software engineering research literature. Objective: To explore the use of pilot case studies {{in the design of}} full-scale case studies, and to report the main lessons learned from an industrial pilot study. Method: We designed and conducted an exploratory case study to identify new relevant research variables that influence the innovative behaviour of software engineers in the industrial setting and to refine the full-scale <b>case</b> <b>study</b> <b>design</b> for the next phase of our research. Results: The use of a pilot case study identified several important research variables that were missing in the initial framework. The pilot study also supported a more sophisticated <b>case</b> <b>study</b> <b>design,</b> which was used to guide a full-scale study. Conclusions: When a research topic has not been fully discovered or understood, it is difficult to create a <b>case</b> <b>study</b> <b>design</b> that covers the relevant research variables and their potential relationships. Conducting a full-scale case study using an untested case design can lead to waste of resources and time if the design has to be reworked during the study. In these situations, the use of pilot case studies can significantly improve the <b>case</b> <b>study</b> <b>design.</b> Comment: 6 pages in 10 th International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement (ESEM), Ciudad Real, Spain, September 201...|$|E
30|$|The “No Theory First” {{case study}} {{research}} design {{is a classic}} and often cited candidate for building theory. As the phenomenon is new {{and in the absence}} of a theory, qualitative data are inspected for aggregation and interpretation. In instrumental <b>case</b> <b>study</b> <b>design,</b> a number of cases will increase the understanding and support building theories by description, aggregation, and interpretation (Stake 2000). New themes and concepts are revealed by case descriptions, interviews, documents, and observations, and the analysis of the data enables the specific contribution of the <b>case</b> <b>study</b> <b>design</b> through a constructivist perspective in theory-building.|$|E

3000|$|<b>Case</b> <b>study</b> {{research}} <b>designs</b> will {{be analyzed}} regarding their various strengths on a theory continuum. Edmondson and McManus (2007) initiated {{a debate on}} whether the stage of theory fits to research questions, style of data collection, and analyses. Similarly, Colquitt and Zapata-Phelan (2007) created a taxonomy capturing facets of empirical article’s theoretical contributions by distinguishing between theory-building and theory testing. Corley and Gioia (2011) extended this debate {{by focusing on the}} practicality of theory and the importance of prescience. While these papers consider the whole range of methodological approaches on a higher level, they treat <b>case</b> <b>studies</b> as relatively homogeneous. This paper aims to delve into a deeper level of analysis by solely focusing on <b>case</b> <b>study</b> research <b>designs</b> and their respective fit on this theory continuum. This approach offers a more fine-grained understanding that sheds light on the diversity of <b>case</b> <b>study</b> research <b>designs</b> in terms of their differential theory contributions.
