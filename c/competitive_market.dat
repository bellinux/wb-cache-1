5|$|The size of {{the rebound}} effect is {{determined}} by the price elasticity of demand for the good. In a perfectly <b>competitive</b> <b>market</b> where fuel is the sole input used, if the price of fuel remains constant but efficiency is doubled, the effective price of travel would be halved (twice as much travel can be purchased). If in response, the amount of travel purchased more than doubles (i.e. demand is price elastic), then fuel consumption would increase, and the Jevons paradox would occur. If demand is price inelastic, the amount of travel purchased would less than double, and fuel consumption would decrease. However, goods and services generally use more than one type of input (e.g. fuel, labour, machinery), and other factors besides input cost may also affect price. These factors tend to reduce the rebound effect, making the Jevons paradox less likely to occur.|$|E

40|$|Organisations {{continually}} seek {{new ways}} to acquire, retain and increase business, since the cost of losing customers is rising. Service organisations such as hotels need {{to put in place}} <b>competitive</b> <b>marketing</b> strategies to improve their competitiveness and thus retain customers. Once demand is created, a hotel needs to manage this demand as well as its capacity to deliver. This study investigates the importance that hotels attach to executing <b>competitive</b> <b>marketing</b> strategies, as well as managing supply and demand. The study also determines whether or not hotels of different size and ownership type differ in their view of the importance of carrying out these functions. An interviewer-administered in-office survey was used to collect data from hotel managers in Gauteng. Hotel managers across the board consider all <b>competitive</b> <b>marketing</b> strategies as important. Significant correlations exist, however, between the importance attached to certain <b>competitive</b> <b>marketing</b> strategies and the size of hotel – as well as the hotel ownership type.

The first departure restores the traditional view that <b>competitive</b> <b>markets</b> fail.
