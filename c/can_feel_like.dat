5|$|Ron (Nick Offerman) sends Leslie (Amy Poehler) to run {{an errand}} at the DMV in Pawnee Hall's fourth floor, a dark and unsettling place that {{includes}} probation offices and divorce filings. A reluctant and frightened Leslie navigates past reprobates and blood stains {{on the floor and}} spots Tom (Aziz Ansari) leaving the divorce office with his wife Wendy (Jama Williamson). Unaware that their relationship was a green card marriage to prevent Wendy from being deported back to Canada, Leslie later tries to comfort Tom, who insists he is fine. Nevertheless, Leslie persists in her efforts to cheer him up, in part by ordering a singing horse telegram to cheer him up. Ron, who knows about Tom's fake marriage, suggests Tom act sad so Leslie <b>can</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> she cheered him up. When Leslie sets up a social event to cheer him up, Tom suggests a strip club, but Leslie follows Jerry's (Jim O'Heir) suggestion they go to the dinosaur-themed restaurant, Jurassic Fork.|$|E

The transitory lifestyle can hinder potential for constructing concrete relationships with people and developing emotional attachments to specific places, as can the stresses of having a parent deployed to a war zone and also the psychological aftermath of war in dealing with returning veteran parents. In some cases {{there is also the}} loss of a parent in combat, or a drastic change in a parent due to a combat related disability. A military brat may personally know another child or teenager, or even a few other peers, whose parents have become war casualties (wounded or killed). A significant minority of ex-military brats may exhibit symptoms of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Avoidant Personality Disorder, Separation Anxiety Disorder, etc.|$|E

500|$|This episode {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics. James Poniewozik of Time magazine wrote that, Andy's Play' {{was the kind}} of strong, character driven episode I've missed from the show—not just good by later season standards but an actual good Office episode, period." [...] Dan Forcella of TV Fanatic wrote that the episode was a reminder of [...] "what has always been great about this show". Alan Sepinwall of HitFix wrote that the episode [...] "worked largely because it embraced [...] idea" [...] that [...] "the bonds you form at work go deeper than carpet, and that if you work with people long enough they <b>can</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> your family." [...] He ultimately concluded that the episode was one that [...] "makes me happy [...] I spent an evening in the company of these goofballs." ...|$|E
500|$|Cyrus {{believed}} that compared to previous albums, Breakout was [...] "grown-up" [...] and [...] "just {{a little more}} creative." [...] Cyrus aimed to incorporate a sound influenced by rock music, saying [...] "the writing is definitely different...the lyrics mean more than my last couple of records". According to Cyrus, the album documented, in depth, the events that occurred in her life in a year span. Most of the songs were written as Cyrus traveled on the Best of Both Worlds Tour from October 2007 to January 2008. Recording commenced immediately after the tour came to an end, and seized in March 2008, for Cyrus was to film [...] (2009) in Tennessee soon after. She expressed that, through each song, a listener could discover something about her and about themselves. Of connecting with her fans through Breakout, she claimed she wanted [...] "girls to feel {{to be able to}} feel empowered and just feel like they can kind of rock out", going on to say that, [...] "listening to this music, I hope they <b>can</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> a reason to dance and just smile and to have fun. This CD is totally age appropriate, specially for me".|$|E
500|$|Although Canning {{said that}} the {{announcement}} of Kurt as prom queen [...] "effectively caught [...] off guard, right in the gut, as good TV should", others were critical of the story at that moment, including Brown, who {{said that the}}re was no logic to Kurt's victory, no explanation of how it might have happened, and no sense in Figgins acceding to it. Semigran and VanDerWerff also called Figgins's actions into question. The sequence after the announcement was lauded by Fallon and Canning, who were impressed by the spliced presentation of multiple aftermaths. Poniewozik said it led to the episode's [...] "theme of community—that is, that not all these characters' problems may be equal, but that they're best able to handle them when they recognize what they have in common. Everyone ... <b>can</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> an outsider on prom night." [...] VanDerWerff also talked about the sense of community, which [...] "has mostly been absent in season two", and noted that [...] "Glee somehow found a way to show off the best AND worst of high school and worked past its own storytelling issues to capture raw emotion." ...|$|E

500|$|The Guardian {{journalist}} Peter Bradshaw {{felt that}} Contagion blended well {{together as a}} film, although opined that Soderbergh was somewhat unsuccessful on channeling the fears, frights, and [...] "the massive sense of loss" [...] of [...] "ordinary people". To David Denby of The New Yorker, the [...] "brilliant" [...] film was [...] "serious, precise, frightening," [...] and [...] "emotionally enveloping". Despite applauding Soderbergh for [...] "hopscotching" [...] tidily [...] "between the intimate and international", The Atlantic Christopher Orr was disappointed with the film's detached and [...] "clinical" [...] disposition, which led him to conclude that Contagion should have gone with a more inflexible rationale, or a lesson [...] "beyond 'wash your hands often and hope you're lucky'." [...] "For all the craft that went into it, Contagion is ultimately beyond good or bad, beyond criticism. It just is," [...] professed The Atlantic writer. Described as a [...] "smart" [...] and [...] "spooky" [...] installment, Manohla Dargis of The New York Times wrote, [...] "Mr. Soderbergh doesn't milk your tears as things fall apart, but a passion that <b>can</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> cold rage is inscribed in his images {{of men and women}} isolated in the frame, in the blurred {{point of view of the}} dying and in the insistent stillness of a visual style that seems like an exhortation to look." [...] In regards to the story, Salon columnist Andrew O'Hehir avouched that the [...] "crisp" [...] and succinct narrative matched up to the [...] "beautifully composed" [...] visuals of the film. Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter proclaimed that Soderbergh and Burns effectively created anxiety in the [...] "shrewd" [...] and [...] "unsensationalistic" [...] film without becoming exaggerated, a sentiment echoed by Jeanette Catsolis of NPR, who insisted that the duo [...] "weave multiple characters into a narrative that's complex without being confusing, and intelligent without being baffling". Writing for The Village Voice, Karina Longworth thought that Contagion reflected the [...] "self-consciousness" [...] and [...] "experimentation" [...] of some of Soderbergh's previous efforts, such as the Ocean's trilogy and The Girlfriend Experience (2009).|$|E
2500|$|In general, student {{activism}} at Harvard {{is limited}} to official channels. Although many Harvard students are involved in community service or public policy, these avenues for change have been criticized (in {{the words of a}} queer student activist at Harvard) as [...] "technocratic," [...] and oriented towards [...] "research solutions, policy solutions, economic solutions, bureaucratic solutions to all problems rather than any type of social movement." [...] Another student said, [...] "It’s uncomfortable to acknowledge one’s own privilege and position—it <b>can</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> a personal attack." ...|$|E
2500|$|A boulder or ledge in {{the middle}} of a river or near the side can obstruct the flow of the river, and can also create a [...] "pillow"; when water flows {{backwards}} upstream of the obstruction, or a [...] "pour over" [...] (over the boulder); and [...] "hydraulics" [...] or [...] "holes" [...] where the river flows back on itself—perhaps back under the drop—often with fearful results for those caught in its grasp. (Holes, or hydraulics, are so-called because their foamy, aerated water provides less buoyancy and <b>can</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> an actual hole in the river surface.) If the flow passes next to the obstruction, an eddy may form behind the obstruction; although eddies are typically sheltered areas where boaters can stop to rest, scout or leave the main current, they may be swirling and whirlpool-like. As with hydraulics (which pull downward rather than to the side and are essentially eddies turned at a 90-degree angle), the power of eddies increases with the flow rate.|$|E
