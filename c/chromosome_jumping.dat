50|$|In {{the early}} days, {{chromosome}} walking from genetically linked DNA markers {{was used to}} identify and clone disease genes. However, the large molecular distance between known markers and the gene of interest was complicating the cloning process. In 1987, a human <b>chromosome</b> <b>jumping</b> library was constructed to clone the cystic fibrosis gene. Cystic Fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disease affecting 1 in 2000 Caucasians. This was the first disease in which {{the usefulness of the}} jumping libraries was demonstrated. Met oncogene was a marker tightly linked to the cystic fibrosis gene on human chromosome 7, and the library was screened for a jumping clone starting at this marker. The cystic fibrosis gene was determined to localize 240kb downstream of the met gene. <b>Chromosome</b> <b>jumping</b> helped reduce the mapping “steps” and bypass the highly repetitive regions in the mammalian genome. <b>Chromosome</b> <b>jumping</b> also allowed the production of probes required for faster diagnosis of this and other diseases.|$|E

40|$|The jumping {{translocation}} (JT) {{is a rare}} chromosomal abnor-mality {{in which}} a specific chromosomal segment translo-cates onto the ends of various <b>chromosomes</b> (<b>jumps).</b> In most cases, the region distal to 1 q 21 jumps onto numerous different telomeres. Here we report a molecular study of the JT involving 1 q 21 found in a patient with acute myelomono-cytic leukemia that had transformed from myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). This is the first report describing {{the analysis of the}} molecular structure of the JT. We demon-strated the presence of a stretch of telomeric repeats at the breakpoint by means of a fluorescence in situ hybridization experiment, molecular cloning, and nucleotide sequencing of the fused region.

40|$|We {{report a}} case of acute monoblastic leukemia showing a jumping {{translocation}} with the MLL gene in a 17 -year-old male. Classic cytogenetic and spectral karyotyping revealed a complex karyotype, and {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH) demonstrated amplification of the MLL gene followed by translocation to chromosomes 15 q, 17 q, and 19 q. In addition, molecular analyses showed a high expression of AURKA and AURKB genes. It is already known that overexpression of Aurora kinases is associated with chromosomal instability and poor prognosis. The formation of jumping translocations is a rare cytogenetic event and there is evidence pointing toward preferential involvement of the heterochromatin region of donor chromosomes and the telomere ends of recipient <b>chromosomes.</b> <b>Jumping</b> translocation with the MLL gene rearrangement is an uncommon phenomenon reported in leukemia cytogenetics.

40|$|An {{understanding}} of the basic defect in the inherited disorder cystic fibrosis requires cloning of the cystic fibrosis gene and definition of its protein product. In the absence of direct functional information, chromosomal map position is a guide for locating the gene. <b>Chromosome</b> walking and <b>jumping</b> and complementary DNA hybridization were used to isolate DNA sequences, encompassing more than 500, 000 base pairs, from the cystic fibrosis region on the long arm of human chromosome 7. Several transcribed sequences and conserved segments were identified in this cloned region. One of these corresponds to the cystic fibrosis gene and spans approximately 250, 000 base pairs of genomic DNA. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R

50|$|Before 1980 {{very few}} human genes had been {{identified}} as disease loci until advances in DNA technology gave rise to positional cloning and reverse genetics. Discovering disease loci using old forward genetic techniques was a very long and difficult process {{and much of the}} work went into mapping and cloning the gene through association studies and chromosome walking. Cystic fibrosis however demonstrates how the process of forward genetics can elucidate a human genetic disorder. Genetic-linkage studies were able to map the disease loci in cystic fibrosis to chromosome 7 by using protein markers. Afterward, <b>chromosome</b> walking and <b>jumping</b> techniques were used to identify the gene and sequence it. Forward genetics can work for single-gene-single phenotype situations but in more complicated diseases like cancer, reverse genetics is often used instead.|$|R
40|$|Background/aims: Jumping translocations {{are rare}} {{cytogenetic}} aberrations in haematological malignancies, {{the pathogenesis of}} which remains to be fully characterised. We investigated the mechanism of formation of jumping translocations {{in a case of}} adult common acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) positive for the Ph translocation. Methods: Interphase and metaphase fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) was performed using several probe systems. Results were correlated with findings on conventional cytogenetics. Granulocytes, T-cells and leukaemic B-cells in peripheral blood were sorted by immunomagnetic method and the terminal restriction fragment (TRF) length of these cellular populations was determined by Southern blot analysis. Results: Duplicated BCR-ABL fusion signals were found on a dic(14; 22) der(22) t(9; 22) <b>chromosome.</b> Clonal <b>jumping</b> translocations, existing as evolutionary changes, involved the donor chromosomal segment distal to 1 q 12 jumping onto the telomere ends of 11 q, 15 p, 19 p and 20 p. Telomere length was decreased in the neoplastic B-cell population and contributed to the formation of the dicentric chromosome that showed absence of telomere repeats at fusion ends. Subsequent pericentromeric heterochromatin decondensation of chromosome 1 q occurred, and this donor segment was randomly fused to the shortened telomere ends of non-homologous chromosomes. Conclusions: Both telomere shortening and pericentromeric heterochromatin decondensation contribute to the formation of jumping translocations, which is most probably a multi-stage process. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

50|$|In 1991, Zabarovsky et al. {{proposed}} {{a new approach}} for construction of jumping libraries. This approach included the use of two separate λ vectors for library construction, and a partial filling-in reaction that removes {{the need for a}} selectable marker. This filling-in reaction worked by destroying the specific cohesive ends (resulting from restriction digests) of the DNA fragments that were nonligated and noncircularized, thus preventing them from cloning into the vectors, in a more energy-efficient and accurate manner. Furthermore, this improved technique required less DNA to start with, and also produced a library that could be transferred into a plasmid form, making it easier to store and replicate. Using this new approach, they successfully constructed a human NotI jumping library from a lymphoblastoid cell line and a human <b>chromosome</b> 3-specific NotI <b>jumping</b> library from a human chromosome 3 and mouse hybrid cell line.|$|R
50|$|<b>Chromosome</b> <b>jumping</b> (or {{chromosome}} hopping) {{was first}} described in 1984 by Collins and Weissman.At the time, cloning techniques allowed for generation of clones of limited size (up to 240kb), and cytogenetic techniques allowed for mapping such clones {{to a small}} region of a particular chromosome to a resolution of around 5-10Mb. Therefore, a major gap remained in resolution between available technologies, and no methods were available for mapping larger areas of the genome.|$|E
50|$|Jumping {{libraries}} or junction-fragment libraries are {{collections of}} genomic DNA fragments generated by <b>chromosome</b> <b>jumping.</b> These libraries {{allow us to}} analyze {{large areas of the}} genome and overcome distance limitations in common cloning techniques.A jumping library clone is composed of two stretches of DNA that are usually located many kilobases away from each other. The stretch of DNA located between these two “ends” is deleted by a series of biochemical manipulations carried out at the start of this cloning technique.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies of}} subtelomeric regions in Plasmodium berghei {{led to the}} {{identification}} of subtelomeric repeats (2. 3 kb long) present in a variable number at many chromosomal ends. Both loss and increase in 2. 3 kb-repeat copy number are involved in chromosome-size polymorphisms. Subtelomeric losses leading to chromosome-size polymorphisms have been described by several authors in P. falciparum where the structure of subtelomeric regions is not known in detail. We therefore undertook their characterisation, by means of <b>chromosome</b> walking and <b>jumping</b> techniques, starting from the telomere-flanking sequence present in pPftel. 1, the P. falciparum telomeric clone described by Vernick and McCutchan (1988). The results indicate that at least 20 (out of 28) chromosomal ends in P. falciparum 3 D 7 chromosomes share a subtelomeric region, about 40 kb long, covering (but not limited to) the Rep 20 region. Non repetitive, AT-rich portions flanking the Rep 20 region on both sides are also conserved at most chromosomal ends...|$|R
40|$|Choroideremia (tapeto-choroidal dystrophy, TCD), an X chromosome-linked {{disorder}} of retina and choroid, causes progressive nightblindness and central blindness in affected males {{by the third}} to fourth decade of life. Recently, {{we have been able}} to map the TCD gene to a small region of overlap between five different, male-viable Xq 21 deletions that were found in patients with TCD and other clinical features. Two families were identified in which classical, nonsyndromic TCD is associated with small interstitial deletions that are only detectable with probe p 1 bD 5 (DXS 165). To characterize these and two other deletions that were identified more recently, we have used the <b>chromosome</b> walking and <b>jumping</b> techniques to generate a set of five chromosomal-jumping clones flanking the DXS 165 locus at various distances. With these clones, we could localize four of the eight deletion endpoints and the breakpoint on the X chromosome of a female with a de novo X/ 13 translocation and choroideremia. These studies assign the TCD gene, or part of it, to a DNA segment of only 15 - 20 kilobases...|$|R
40|$|Homeotic {{genes are}} {{involved}} in the control of developmental pathways: dominant mutations at the Antennapedia locus of Drosophila, for example, lead to replacement of the antennae on the head of the fly by mesothoracic legs. Using a combination of <b>chromosome</b> walking and <b>jumping,</b> we have cloned a DNA region from Drosophila containing Antennapedia. Five DNA inversion rearrangements which are associated with the Antennapedia mutant phenotype were localized within a 25 -kb region. Genomic DNA sequences from this area were used as hybridization probes to screen cDNA libraries prepared from Drosophila embryonic and pupal poly(A) + RNA. A 2. 2 -kb cDNA sequence (903) was isolated which appears to derive from at least four non-contiguous chromosomal regions that span 100 kb. It includes the positions of the inversion breakpoints. A second cDNA of 2. 9 kb (909) is composed of sequences from at least three chromosomal regions, two of which are similar or identical to sequences contained in the 903 clone but the third is derived from genomic DNA within a putative 903 intron. The unusual size and complexity of this locus are discussed...|$|R
50|$|In <b>chromosome</b> <b>jumping,</b> the DNA of {{interest}} is identified, cut into fragments with restriction enzymes, and circularised (the {{beginning and end of}} each fragment are joined together to form a circular loop). From a known sequence, a primer is designed to sequence across the circularised junction. This primer is used to jump 100 kb-300 kb intervals: a sequence 100 kb away would have come near the known sequence on circularisation. Thus, sequences not reachable by chromosome walking can be sequenced. Chromosome walking can be used from the new jump position (in either direction) to look for gene-like sequences, or additional jumps can be used to progress further along the chromosome.|$|E
40|$|A {{detailed}} {{map of the}} class-II {{region of}} the human MHC has been established by pulsed-field-gel-electrophoresis (PFGE) mapping and cloning in yeast-artificial-chromosome (YAC) vectors. The map revealed CpG islands, which are frequently associated with genes, in the gaps between the known HLA-class-II genes. Using cosmid walking and <b>chromosome</b> <b>jumping,</b> we have cloned 3 of these islands and have identified 5 novel genes, named RINGI- 5. This brief report summarizes our present knowledge of these genes...|$|E
40|$|We {{have used}} a {{combination}} of BsuE methyltransferase (M-BsuE) and NotI restriction enzyme to cut genomic DNA at a subset of NotI sites. The usefulness of this system is shown in a re-examination of the restriction map of the human MHC. Combinations of methylases and restriction enzymes {{can be used to}} generate cuts at different frequencies in genomic DNA, such that they generate ends complementary to NotI ends, and can be used in conjunction with NotI linking clones in <b>chromosome</b> <b>jumping</b> experiments. These enzyme combinations have the potential to produce cutting sites in genomic DNA spaced at intervals favorable for extensive mapping, fragment enrichment, and cloning efforts...|$|E
40|$|Using <b>chromosome</b> <b>jumping</b> {{and walking}} and {{restriction}} fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis, we have defined the region which must contain the cystic fibrosis gene. DNA segments spanning approximately 250 kb {{in the direction}} of the gene were isolated and used to identify several new polymorphisms informative in cystic fibrosis families. These RFLPs include a highly polymorphic, CA/GT repeat, and a 10 bp insertion uncovered using the polymerase chain reaction. By analyzing a family with a recombination near the gene, we can exclude this region as containing the mutation. Data on the extent of linkage disequilibrium of these markers provides additional information on where the gene is located...|$|E
40|$|We {{have used}} <b>chromosome</b> <b>jumping</b> {{technology}} {{to move from}} within a large intron sequence in the Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) gene to a region adjacent to exons of the gene. The single copy jump clone, HH 1, was used to characterise deletions in patients previously shown to be deleted for DNA markers in the 5 ' end of the gene. 12 out of 15 such patients have breakpoints which lie between HH 1 and the genomic locus J- 47. Thus {{the vast majority of}} the deletions in these patients have proximal breakpoints in a similar region distal to the 5 ' end of the gene. HH 1 was mapped with respect to the X; 1 translocation in a DMD female and was shown to lie at least 80 kb from the starting point of the chromosome jump, HIP 25...|$|E
40|$|The {{specific}} (6; 9) (p 23;q 34) {{chromosomal translocation}} {{is associated with}} a defined subtype of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL). The 9 q 34 breakpoint is located at the telomeric side of the c-abl gene. Through a combination of <b>chromosome</b> <b>jumping,</b> long-range mapping, and chromosome walking, the chromosome 9 breakpoints of several t(6; 9) ANLL patients were localized within a defined region of 8 kilobases (kb), 360 kb telomeric of c-abl. Subsequent cDNA cloning revealed that this region represented an intron {{in the middle of a}} gene, called Cain (can), encoding a 7. 5 -kb transcript. Disruption of the can gene by the translocation resulted in the expression of a new 5. 5 -kb can mRNA from the 6 p- chromosome. Isolation of chromosome 6 sequences showed that breakpoints on 6 p 23 also clustered within a limited stretch of DNA. These data strongly suggest a direct involvement of the translocation in the leukemic process of t(6; 9) ANL...|$|E
40|$|The locus {{responsible}} for {{the most common form}} of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (PKD 1) is located on chromosome 16 p 13. 3. Genetic mapping studies indicate that PKD 1 is flanked on the proximal side by the DNA marker 26. 6 (D 16 S 125). Here we show that 26. 6 has undergone a locus duplication and that the two loci are less than 150 kb apart. One of the two loci contains a polymorphic TaqI site that has been used in genetic studies and represents the proximal boundary for the PKD 1 locus. We demonstrate that the polymorphic locus is the more proximal of the two 26. 6 -hybridizing loci. Therefore, four cosmids isolated from the distal 26. 6 -hybridizing locus contain candidate sequences for the PKD 1 gene. These cosmids were found to contain two CpG islands that are likely markers for transcribed regions. A third CpG island was detected and cloned by directional <b>chromosome</b> <b>jumping...</b>|$|E
40|$|Linking clones contain {{sequences}} flanking recognition {{sites for}} enzymes cutting rarely in mammalian DNA. They {{can be used}} to obtain and correlate both physical and genetic mapping information over subregions of mammalian chromosomes. We have constructed and used a NotI linking clone library representing unmethylated NotI sites from HHW 693 DNA, a hamster hybrid cell line containing 4 p 15 - 4 pter and a fragment of 5 p as its only human chromosome contribution. Human clones were identified by hybridisation with a cloned human repeat sequence, and localised further to subregions of human chromosome 4 p 15 - 4 pter using a panel of additional hybrids. Clones from the region distal to the DNA probes (D 4 S 10, D 4 S 43, D 4 S 95) linked to the Huntington's disease mutation, were further analysed. Four markers close to the HD gene: D 4 S 111, D 4 S 113, D 4 S 114 and clone 417 are described here. In addition to serving as markers in physical and genetic mapping experiments, these linking clones provide probes next to cleavable NotI sites, and can therefore be used to screen NotI based <b>chromosome</b> <b>jumping</b> libraries. They also provide indications for potential gene sequences, identifiable as evolutionarily conserved sequences...|$|E
40|$|The {{gene for}} Huntington disease (HD) has been {{localized}} to the distal {{portion of the}} short arm of human chromosome 4 by linkage analysis. Currently, the two closest DNA markers are D 4 S 10 (G 8), located approximately equal to 3 centimorgans centromeric to HD, and D 4 S 43 (C 4 H), positioned 0 - 1. 5 centimorgans from HD. In an effort to move closer to the HD gene, with the eventual goal of identifying the gene itself, we have applied the technique of <b>chromosome</b> <b>jumping</b> to this region. A 200 -kilobase jumping library has been constructed, and a jump from D 4 S 10 has been obtained and its approximate distance verified by pulsed field gel electrophoresis. Two restriction fragment length polymorphisms have been identified at the jump locus, which is denoted D 4 S 81. Linkage analysis of previously identified recombinants between D 4 S 10 and HD or D 4 S 10 and D 4 S 43 shows that in two of five events the jump has crossed the recombination points. This unequivocally orients D 4 S 10 and D 4 S 81 on the chromosome, provides additional markers for HD, and suggests that recombination frequency in this region of chromosome 4 may be increased, so that the physical distance from D 4 S 10 to HD {{may not be as}} large as originally suspected...|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} {{contiguous}} gene deletion syndromes by using reverse genetic techniques provides {{a powerful tool}} for precisely defining the map location of the genes involved. We have made use of individuals with overlapping deletions producing choroideremia as part of a complex phenotype, to define the boundaries on the X chromosome for this gene, as well as for X-linked mixed deafness with perilymphatic gusher (DFN 3). Two patients with deletions and choroideremia are affected by an X-linked mixed conductive/sensorineural deafness; one patient, XL- 62, was confirmed at surgery to have DFN 3, while the other patient, XL- 45, is suspected clinically to have the same disorder. A third choroideremia deletion patient, MBU, has normal hearing. Patient XL- 62 has a cytogenetically detectable deletion that was measured to be 7. 7 % of the X chromosome by dual laser flow cytometry; the other patient, XL- 45, has a cytogenetically undetectable deletion that measures only 3. 3 % of the X chromosome. We have produced a physical map of the X-chromosome region containing choroideremia and DFN 3 by using routine Southern blotting, chromosome walking and jumping techniques, and long-range restriction mapping to generate and link anonymous DNA sequences in this region. DXS 232 and DXS 233 are located within 450 kb of each other on the same SfiI and MluI fragments and share partial SalI fragments of 750 and greater than 1, 000 kb but are separated by at least one SalI site. In addition, DXS 232, which lies outside the MBU deletion, detects the proximal breakpoint of this deletion. We have isolated two new anonymous DNA sequences by <b>chromosome</b> <b>jumping</b> from DXS 233; one of these detects a new SfiI fragment distal to DXS 233 {{in the direction of the}} choroideremia gene, while the other jump clone is proximal to DXS 233 and detects a new polymorphism. These data refine the map around the loci for choroideremia and for mixed deafness with stapes fixation and will provide points from which to isolate candidate gene sequences for these disorders...|$|E
