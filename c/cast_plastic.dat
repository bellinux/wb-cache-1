50|$|On 27 August, Terrell, Glanville and a Dr Lee {{drafted a}} report {{detailing}} their efforts and giving {{a recipe for}} plastic armour - the entire development cycle had taken just ten days. The recipe required 55% granite, 38% limestone and 7% bitumen; {{it was important that}} the stone was carefully graded and free from grit. The backing plate was vital; it would usually be a 0.25 in thick mild steel. Since this was what vital parts of a ship's superstructure were made from, it was possible to <b>cast</b> <b>plastic</b> armour in situ between existing plates and temporary wooden shuttering, usually to a thickness of 4 in. Where this was not possible, armoured plates could be factory made. Wooden backing could also be used when non-magnetic protection was needed near the ship's compass. The war had brought road building to a virtual halt, so there were plenty of suitably qualified workers and machines available for the task of armouring Britain's ships.|$|E

The scintillator counters (SC- 1) of the array are <b>cast</b> <b>plastic</b> scintillators with a wavelength of each SC- 1 detector is 12. 2 × 12. 2 × 3. 0 cm^ 3. 16 SC- 1 detectors are placed in the metal case of 50. 0 × 50. 0 × 13. 0 cm^ 3 dimension. Each case, called SC- 16 detector, contains electronics of preliminary processing of signals and operating mode stabilization. The whole of the array will contain 96 detectors SC- 16. It will make 1536 channels placed in three planes (48 + 24 + 24 detectors).

40|$|Background: Screw {{loosening}} of implant restorations {{continues to}} be a complication in implant prosthodontics. Screw joints are subjected to a loss of initially applied torque because of friction and component misfit. It has been suggested that the loss of applied torque is less in machined metal abutments than in <b>cast</b> <b>plastic</b> abutments. Purpose: This study compared the loss of applied torque (detorque) values in machined titanium and in cast UCLA-type abutments for external hex abutment/implant interface. Materials and Methods: Four groups of 12 samples each were evaluated: (1) machined titanium abutments, (2) premachined palladium abutments cast with palladium, (3) plastic abutments cast with nickel-chromium, and (4) plastic abutments cast with cobalt-chromium. Each abutment was torqued to 30 Ncm according to the manufacturer’s instructions and detorqued three times. The mean loss of applied torque (detorque) was recorded {{as a percentage of the}} torque applied. Group means were calculated and compared using ANOVA and Tukey’s LSD test. Results: Mean detorque values were (1) 92. 3 ± 2. 9 %, (2) 81. 6 ± 5. 0 %, (3) 86. 4 ± 4. 6 %, and (4) 84. 0 ± 7. 0 %. Machined abutments demonstrated significantly greater detorque values compared with all cast groups (p < 0. 05). No significant differences were found among cast groups...|$|E

30|$|The imaging {{techniques}} {{are aimed at}} detecting the cosmic-ray muons and are intricately associated with electronic systems and computers. The function of the scintillator in the imaging systems is to convert the energy deposited along {{the path of the}} high-energy muons into visible light. The experimental arrangement for a real-time volcano monitoring system requires a relatively large detection area to collect a large number of muon events. With these increasing requirements for volcanic imaging equipment, the demands made on the scintillator as the detection material in imaging systems will be enormous. About 320 kg of scintillator is required for a cosmic-ray muon detection system with a size of 2 × 2 m. In principle, an ideal scintillator for muon radiography should have the following properties: (1) high luminous efficiency; (2) short decay time; (3) no after glow; (4) short attenuation length; (5) low cost. However, in general, the choice of a scintillator for any given project is based on a compromise between light output and cost. <b>Cast</b> <b>plastic</b> scintillators may cost between $ 40 – 60 per kilogram. Therefore, the development of new scintillators for cosmic-ray muon radiography will provide a major impulse to research on the diagnosis and monitoring of volcanoes. We report here our development of a new scintillator that is based on a simple “heating-melting method”; this scintillator has a significantly lower price tag than those currently available.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{characterisation}} of water jets {{to be used}} for washing out the filling of explosive ordnance. Water jets have advantages over conventional techniques in that they are non-polluting and can effectively disperse all compositions; pressed, <b>cast,</b> <b>plastic</b> and PBX. The water jets studied are produced by a gas gun consisting of a parallel barrel and a detachable tapered nozzle. Four nozzle designs were tested with exit-diameters ranging from 27 mm to 16 mm. A plastic piston regulates the volume of the water charge. For various combinations of water volume, breech pressure and nozzle diameter, high speed cine photography and flash radiography was used to characterise the water jets in terms of velocity and coherence. Water jets were achieved with jet-tip velocities between 100 and 600 m/s and breech pressures in the range of 30 - 100 MPa. The water jets have been fired at plastic explosive compositions and dispersed the explosive with little chance of initiating a reaction, even when heavily confined. The water jet is capable of penetrating moderate thicknesses of sheet metal so could be used where the explosive filling is directly accessible or thinly covered eg. fuse-well. Continuous water jets with similar characteristics could be used for demolition of unfused ordnance, eg. depot demolition, or following an EOD operation where the fuse(s) has been removed by some other technique. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Objective: In {{an effort}} to limit {{exposure}} to ionizing radiation and fully characterize three dimensional changes in the spine of patients with scoliosis reliable non-invasive methods of spinal back contour analysis (Milwaukee Topographic Scanner) (MTS) have been developed. Study Design: The current study compares spinal topography measurements among different subject positions and evaluates the reproducibility of the system for both inter-rater and intra-rater reliability. Methods: A dummy <b>cast</b> (<b>plastic</b> cast) of one patient with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis was created {{in order to test}} the reliability of the MTS. The dummy cast was positioned and rotated in 3 D while scanned by two investigators using the MTS. A total of twelve parameters including Q-angle (an analog to X-ray’s Cobb angle) were extracted. Results: All measurements of intra-rater and inter-rater reliability were excellent (Intraclass Correlation Coefficients ranging from 0. 89 to 0. 99) with the exception of Pelvic Tilt (intra-rater ICC is 0. 61) and lordosis angle (inter-rater ICC is 0. 82). No significant variability among investigators was observed for all tested metrics. No significant variability due to position was observed for the majority of back contour measurements but there were significant changes in the T 1 -S 1 angle, T 1 -S 1 deviation, T 1 -NC angle, T 1 -NC deviation, and Back Height metric (p< 0. 05). Conclusions: The MTS is a reliable method of raster stereography in the measurement of the back contour, which will help monitor the progression of children with idiopathic scoliosis and reduce the use of X-rays...|$|E
