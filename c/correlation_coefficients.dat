[...] In informal parlance, correlation is synonymous with dependence.

[...] There are several <b>correlation</b> <b>coefficients,</b> often denoted ' or r, measuring the degree of correlation.

In the same way if y always decreases when x increases, the rank <b>correlation</b> <b>coefficients</b> will be −1, while the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient {{may or may not be}} close to −1, depending on how close the points are to a straight line.
