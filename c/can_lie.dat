5|$|A 1994 {{analysis}} of Ramanujan's medical records and symptoms by Dr. D. A. B. Young concluded that his medical symptomsmdash&including his past relapses, fevers and hepatic conditionsmdash&were {{much closer to}} those resulting from hepatic amoebiasis, an illness then widespread in Madras, rather than tuberculosis. He had two episodes of dysentery before he left India. When not properly treated, dysentery <b>can</b> <b>lie</b> dormant for years and lead to hepatic amoebiasis, whose diagnosis was not then well established. Amoebiasis was a treatable and often curable disease at the time.|$|E
5|$|Tessellation or tiling in two {{dimensions}} {{is a topic}} in geometry that studies how shapes, known as tiles, can be arranged to fill a plane without any gaps, according to a given set of rules. These rules can be varied. Common ones are {{that there must be}} no gaps between tiles, and that no corner of one tile <b>can</b> <b>lie</b> along the edge of another. The tessellations created by bonded brickwork do not obey this rule. Among those that do, a regular tessellation has both identical regular tiles and identical regular corners or vertices, having the same angle between adjacent edges for every tile. There are only three shapes that can form such regular tessellations: the equilateral triangle, square, and regular hexagon. Any one of these three shapes can be duplicated infinitely to fill a plane with no gaps.|$|E
5|$|The whitetip reef shark {{is one of}} {{the three}} most common sharks inhabiting the reefs of the Indo-Pacific, the other two being the blacktip reef shark (Carcharhinus melanopterus) and the grey reef shark (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos). The habitat {{preferences}} of this species overlap those of the other two, though it does not tend to frequent very shallow water like the blacktip reef shark, nor the outer reef like the grey reef shark. The whitetip reef shark swims with strong undulations of its body, and unlike other requiem sharks <b>can</b> <b>lie</b> motionless on the bottom and actively pump water over its gills for respiration. This species is most active at night or during slack tide, and spends much of the day resting inside caves singly or in small groups, arranged in parallel or stacked atop one another. Off Hawaii, these sharks may be found sheltering inside underwater lava tubes, while off Costa Rica they are often seen lying in the open on sandy flats.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} negotiation over resources among self-motivated agents. Negotiation occurs over time: {{there are}} time constraints that affect how each agent values the resource. The agents {{also consider the}} possibility that they will encounter each other in future negotiations. We cope with agents having incomplete information, emphasizing probability management techniques. Questions arising in this research are: 1. When is it worth it for an agent to lie? 2. How beneficial <b>can</b> such <b>lies</b> be? 3. Is the system with a lying agent robust? 4. How <b>can</b> <b>lies</b> be discouraged? The main contributions of this work are our ability to deal with multiple encounters among agents, and our treatment of the problem that enables elementary mutual learning. ...|$|R

25|$|During mating, {{the male}} copepod grips the female {{with his first}} pair of antennae, which is {{sometimes}} modified for this purpose. The male then produces an adhesive package of sperm and transfers it to the female's genital opening with his thoracic limbs. Eggs are sometimes laid directly into the water, but many species enclose them within a sac attached to the female's body until they hatch.

25|$|Sumner's proof shows, more strongly, {{that in any}} {{connected}} claw-free graph one {{can find}} a pair of adjacent vertices the removal of which leaves the remaining graph connected. To show this, Sumner finds a pair of vertices u and v that are as far apart {{as possible in the}} graph, and chooses w to be a neighbor of v that is as far from u as possible; as he shows, neither v nor w <b>can</b> <b>lie</b> on any shortest path from any other node to u, so the removal of v and w leaves the remaining graph connected. Repeatedly removing matched pairs of vertices in this way forms a perfect matching in the given claw-free graph.|$|E
25|$|The {{impetus for}} the treaty, {{like that of the}} 1997 Ottawa Treaty to limit landmines, has been concern over the severe damage and risks to civilians from {{explosive}} weapons during and long after attacks. A varying proportion of submunitions dispersed by cluster bombs fail to explode on impact and <b>can</b> <b>lie</b> unexploded for years until disturbed. The sometimes brightly colored munitions are not camouflaged, but have been compared to toys or Easter eggs, attracting children at play. Human rights activists claim that one in four casualties resulting from submunitions that fail to explode on impact are children who often pick up and play with the explosive canisters well after the conflict has ended. The 2006 Lebanon War provided momentum for the campaign to ban cluster bombs. The United Nations estimated that up to 40% of Israeli cluster bomblets failed to explode on impact. Norway organized the independent Oslo process after discussions at the traditional disarmament forum in Geneva fell through in November 2006.|$|E
500|$|Above {{or below}} the circle for manned {{stations}} (automatic stations do not report cloud types) that indicates sky cover <b>can</b> <b>lie</b> one or more symbols indicating cloud types {{in any of the}} low, middle, and high-étages for tropospheric clouds. One predominant cloud type may be depicted for each of three étages, if known. The middle and high-étage types are depicted above the sky cover circle of the station model, while the main low-étage cloud type is indicated below the circle. Since the station model has limited room, it makes no special provision for vertical or multi-level clouds that can occupy more than one étage at a particular time. [...] Consequently, cloud genera with significant vertical development may be coded and plotted as low or middle depending on the altitude at which they normally form. Cumulus and cumulonimbus usually form in the low étage of the troposphere and achieve vertical extent by growing upward into the middle or high étage. Conversely, nimbostratus usually forms in the middle étage of the troposphere and becomes vertically developed by growing downward into the low étage. [...] Although the SYNOP code has no separate formal group classification for vertical or multi-level clouds, the observer procedure for selecting numerical codes is designed to give high reporting priority to those genera or species that show significant vertical development.|$|E

500|$|A larger {{proportion}} of rainfall falls {{in advance of the}} center (or eye) than after the center's passage, with the highest percentage falling in the right-front quadrant. [...] A tropical cyclone's highest rainfall rates <b>can</b> <b>lie</b> in the right rear quadrant within a training (non-moving) inflow band. [...] Rainfall is found to be strongest in their inner core, within a degree of latitude of the center, with lesser amounts farther away from the center. [...] Most of the rainfall in hurricanes is concentrated within its radius of gale-force winds. [...] Larger tropical cyclones have larger rain shields, which can lead to higher rainfall amounts farther from the cyclone's center. [...] Storms which have moved slowly, or loop, lead to the highest rainfall amounts. [...] Riehl calculated that [...] of rainfall per day can be expected within one-half degree, or , of the center of a mature tropical cyclone. [...] Many tropical cyclones progress at a forward motion of 10knots, which would limit the duration of this excessive rainfall to around one-quarter of a day, which would yield about [...] of rainfall. [...] This would be true over water, within [...] of the coastline, and outside topographic features. [...] As a cyclone moves farther inland and is cut off from its supply of warmth and moisture (the ocean), rainfall amounts from tropical cyclones and their remains decrease quickly.|$|E
