40|$|Abstract: There is a {{widespread}} assumption that ancient “cinnamon” and “cassia” {{were the same as}} the spices now known by those names; that is, products obtained from trees of the genus Cinnamomum. This article argues {{that this is not the}} case, but that the “cinnamon” and “cassia” of ancient writers very probably came from plants native to northeast Africa, as several early writers actually state. Possible African sources of ancient “cinnamon” and “cassia” are suggested. The most probable principal source is identified as Cassia abbreviata. It is also argued that alleged identifications of <b>cinnamon</b> or <b>cassia</b> at archaeological sites in the Mediterranean region are questionable. It is shown that <b>cinnamon</b> and <b>cassia</b> did not figure in Southeast Asian and Chinese trade at an early period, and that Austronesian settlement of Madagascar occurred after the Classical period, probably during the second half of the first millennium CE, too late for Southeast Asians to have played any major role in trade with the Roman Empire. There is no good reason to believe that true <b>cinnamon</b> and <b>cassia</b> were traded to the western Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean region at any very early date.   This article truly takes an interdisciplinary approach to its subject: the author is a botanist as well as a historian, and is able to use original Chinese sources. The question of whether ancient “cinnamon” and “cassia” were the same as modern <b>cinnamon</b> and <b>cassia</b> (products of trees of the genus Cinnamomum) is a thorny one, which has been repeatedly debated in the past, usually with no very conclusive result. The most recent thorough discussion of the issue, by Lionel Casson, concluded that the ancient and modern products were the same. This article refutes that view: it is clear that Casson lacked the botanical knowledge necessary to reach a sound conclusion. The article deals with its subject thoroughly, examining archaeological as well as textual evidence, and using a wide range of sources.  </p...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to evaluate the application of commercially available essential oils (EOs) and oleoresins to control bacterial pathogens for ready to eat food. In this study, sixty seven commercial EOs, oleoresins (ORs) and pure compounds were used to evaluate in vitro their antimicrobial activity against six food pathogens. These products were first screened for their antimicrobial activity using disk diffusion assay. Forty one products were then chosen for further analysis to determine their minimum inhibitory concentration against 6 different bacteria. There were 5 different products (allyl isothiocyanate, cinnamon Chinese cassia, cinnamon OR, oregano and red thyme) that showed high antimicrobial activity against all tested bacteria. Further analysis examined the effect of four selected EOs on controlling the growth rate of mixed cultures of Listeria monocytogenes in ham.

40|$|ABSTRACT: An {{array of}} quartz {{crystals}} coated with different room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) is {{proposed for the}} analysis of flavors by quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) measurements. Seven RTILs were adopted as sensing layers, all containing imidazolium or phosphonium cations, differing from one another in the length and branching of alkyl groups and neutralized by different anions. The array was at first applied to the analysis of 31 volatile organic compounds (VOCs), such as alcohols, phenols, aldehydes, esters, ketones, acids, amines, hydrocarbons and terpenes, chosen as representative components {{of a wide variety of}} food flavors. Multivariate data analysis by the principal component analysis (PCA) approach of the set of the corresponding responses led to separated clusters for these different chemical categories. To further prove the good performance of the RTIL-coated quartz crystal array as an “electronic nose”, it was applied to the analysis of headspaces from cinnamon samples belonging to different botanical varieties (Cinnamon zeylanicum and <b>Cinnamon</b> <b>cassia).</b> PCA applied to responses recorded on different stocks of samples of both varieties showed that they could be fully discriminated...|$|E
40|$|Cinnamon {{capsules}} {{are sold}} as food supplements or as dietetic foods to reduce {{blood sugar levels}} in type II Diabetes mellitus, a severe chronic disease. The manufacturers recommend a daily long-term dose in the gram range although {{the safety of a}} cinnamon dose of this amount has not yet been demonstrated. Furthermore, the claimed ability of cinnamon to reduce blood sugar has not been sufficiently proven up to now. The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) was, therefore, asked to assess the daily intake of high amounts of cinnamon from the angle of consumer health protection. Small amounts of cinnamon have been used for thousands of years as a spice without any reports of side effects. By contrast, no reliable data are available on the effects of the daily continuous administration of amounts in the gram range. When it comes to cinnamon a distinction must be made between Ceylon and <b>cassia</b> <b>cinnamon.</b> Unlike <b>cassia</b> <b>cinnamon</b> Ceylon cinnamon hardly contain any coumarin which – when ingested in large amounts – can cause damage to the liver.
