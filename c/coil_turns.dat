The sensor consists of two single-layer coils and a straight micro-channel, and can detect, not only ferromagnetic and non-ferromagnetic particles in oil as an inductive sensor, but also, water droplets and air bubbles in oil as a capacitive sensor. The experiments are carried out at different excitation frequencies, number of <b>coil</b> <b>turns</b> and particle sizes. For the inductance detection, the inductance signals are found to increase with the excitation frequency and the noise is constant; both the inductance signals and the noise increase {{with the number of}} <b>coil</b> <b>turns,</b> but because the noise increases at a faster rate than the signal, the signal-to-noise ratio decreases with the number of <b>coil</b> <b>turns.</b> We demonstrate the successful detection of 40 μm iron particles and 110 μm copper particles using the coil with 20 turns at the excitation frequency of 2 MHz.
