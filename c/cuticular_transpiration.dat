40|$|Cuticles act as solution-diffusion {{membranes}} {{for water}} transport. Diffusion in pores does {{not contribute to}} <b>cuticular</b> <b>transpiration.</b> An extensive literature survey of cuticular permeances (P) and minimum leaf conductances (g(min)) to water is presented. The two variables cannot be distinguished with most experimental techniques. Results from different experiments are in good agreement {{with each other for}} some species, for example, Fagus sylvatica L., but not for others, such as Picea abies (L.) Karst. In a data set of 313 values of P or g(min) from 200 species, distributions of results obtained with different techniques were found to differ significantly. Likely reasons include water loss from incompletely closed or incompletely sealed stomata, and the dependence of P on moisture content of the cuticle and on storage time of isolated cuticles. Contrasting evidence for an interaction between <b>cuticular</b> <b>transpiration</b> and stomatal sensitivity to air humidity is presented. The occurrence of unusually high g(min) in trees growing at the alpine treeline and its physiological significance are discussed. It is shown that g(min) is of little value as a predictor for drought resistance of crops, {{with the possible exception of}} Sorghum bicolor L. Moench.

40|$|An {{attempt was}} made to explain the {{excessive}} wilting tendency of 3 tomato mutants, notabilis, flacca, and sitiens. The control varieties in which these mutations were induced are Rheinlands Ruhm for flacca and sitiens and Lukullus for notabilis. Although all 3 mutants are alleles of separated loci, they seem to react similarly to water stress. The mutants wilt faster than the control plants when both are subjected to the same water stress. It was demonstrated by measurements of water loss from whole plants that all 3 mutants have much higher rates of transpiration than the control varieties, particularly at night. The extent of <b>cuticular</b> <b>transpiration</b> was compared in both kinds of plants by measuring the rate of water loss from detached drying leaves coated with vaseline on the lower surface. The difference in <b>cuticular</b> <b>transpiration</b> between the mutant and the control plants seems to be negligible. However, various facts point to stomata as the main factor responsible for the higher rates of water loss in the mutant plants. The stomata of the latter tend to open wider and to resist closure in darkness, in wilted leaves, and when treated with phenylmercuric acetate. Stomata of the 2 extreme mutants, sitiens and flacca, remain open even when the guard cells are plasmolyzed. The stomata of the mutants also are more frequent per unit of leaf surface and vary more in their size...|$|E

Profile of water vapor density was different from air temperature profile. The difference {{was estimated to be}} caused by stomatal and <b>cuticular</b> resistances for <b>transpiration</b> and appeared in the large gap of water vapor density at leaf surface. Furthermore, differences were found between profiles on adaxial and abaxial surfaces, which were considered to be caused by more turbulent air current and higher transpiration rate on abaxial leaf surface. Air conditions such as temperature, saturation vapor deficit and wind velocity of ambient air outside the boundary layer affected the profile of water vapor density, and these effects of air conditions closely related to stomatal responses which made the stomatal resistance higher at the lower air temperatures, the higher saturation deficits and the higher wind velocities...|$|R
40|$|Desiccation {{resistance}} in insects {{has long been}} thought to covary with environmental water availability, and to involve changes in both <b>cuticular</b> and respiratory <b>transpiration.</b> Here, we adopt a large-scale approach to address both issues. Water loss rate and precipitation are positively related at global scales, A significant proportion (68 %) of the interspecific variation in water loss rate is explained at the genus level or above. The relationship between metabolic rate and water loss rate differs substantially between mesic and xeric species. While these variables covary {{as a consequence of}} their independent covariation with body mass in mesic species, {{this is not the case}} in xeric species. In the latter, there is a strong relationship between the residuals of the water loss rate-body mass and metabolic rate-body mass relationships, and water loss rate is much reduced. Moreover, because metabolic rate does not differ significantly between xeric and mesic species of a similar size, respiratory transpiration constitutes a greater proportion of total water loss in xeric than in mesic species of a similar size. This implies that respiratory transpiration and the extent to which it can be modified must be of considerable importance in xeric insect species, although finer scale studies suggest otherwise. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

This study aims to dissect the contributions of genetic variation and the physiological processes underlying the relationships between fruit growth and the accumulation of dry matter and sugars. Fruit quality traits and physiological parameters were measured on 20 introgression lines derived from the introgression of Solanum chmielewskii into S. lycopersicum, under high (HL, unpruned trusses) and low (LL, trusses pruned to one fruit) fruit load conditions. Inter- and intra-genotypic correlations among traits were estimated and quantitative trait loci (QTL) for size, composition, and physiological traits were mapped. LL increased almost all traits, but the response of sugar content was genotype-dependent, involving either dilution effects or differences in carbon allocation to sugars. Genotype 3 fruit load interactions were significant for most traits and only 30 % of the QTL were stable under both fruit loads. Many QTL for fresh weight and cell or seed numbers co-localized. Eleven clusters of QTL for fresh weight and dry matter or sugar content were detected, eight with opposite allele effects and three with negative effects. Two genotypic antagonistic relationships, between fresh weight and dry matter content and between cell number and cell size, were significant only under HL; the second could be interpreted as a competition for carbohydrates among cells.

40|$|Abstract Background Stomata {{respond to}} vapour {{pressure}} deficit (D) – when D increases, stomata begin to close. Closure {{is the result}} of a decline in guard cell turgor, but the link between D and turgor is poorly understood. We describe a model for stomatal responses to increasing D based upon cellular water relations. The model also incorporates impacts of increasing levels of water stress upon stomatal responses to increasing D. Results The model successfully mimics the three phases of stomatal responses to D and also reproduces the impact of increasing plant water deficit upon stomatal responses to increasing D. As water stress developed, stomata regulated transpiration at ever decreasing values of D. Thus, stomatal sensitivity to D increased with increasing water stress. Predictions from the model concerning the impact of changes in <b>cuticular</b> <b>transpiration</b> upon stomatal responses to increasing D are shown to conform to experimental data. Sensitivity analyses of stomatal responses to various parameters of the model show that leaf thickness, the fraction of leaf volume that is air-space, and the fraction of mesophyll cell wall in contact with air have little impact upon behaviour of the model. In contrast, changes in cuticular conductance and membrane hydraulic conductivity have significant impacts upon model behaviour. Conclusion <b>Cuticular</b> <b>transpiration</b> is an important feature of stomatal responses to D and is the cause of the 3 phase response to D. Feed-forward behaviour of stomata does not explain stomatal responses to D as feedback, involving water loss from guard cells, can explain these responses. </p...|$|E

40|$|Regulation {{of water}} content is {{essential}} for all organisms. In insects, water can be gained through consumption, absorption of atmospheric water vapor and production of water during metabolism (Hadley, 1994). Simultaneously, water is lost through the processes of excretion, <b>cuticular</b> and respiratory <b>transpiration</b> and in bodily secretions. When living in desiccating environments, insects {{must be able to}} maintain water balance by restricting water loss (Edney, 1977). Water conservation is especially challenging for Drosophila melanogaster, {{in which there is no}} absorption of water from the atmosphere and net water loss occurs even in atmospheres exhibiting greater than 90 % relative humidity (Arlian and Eckstrand, 1975). Investigators studying physiological responses in populations of Drosophila melanogaster that have undergone laboratory selection for enhanced desiccation-tolerance have proposed that resistance to dehydration is increased in adults primarily by a reduction in the rate of cuticular water loss and by an increase in body water content (Hoffman and Parsons, 1993; Gibbs et al., 1997; Djawdan et al., 1998). Some additional features, whose functional significances are currently unclear, appear to play a role in the evolution of desiccation-resistance in Drosophila melanogaster. These include changes in the respiratory pattern and behavior during dehydration as well as modifications of the rate of development and of the carbohydrate-to-lipid ratio of storage products (Williams et al., 1998; Williams and Bradley, 1998; Chippindale et al., 1998; Djawdan et al., 1998). On the basis of the above studies, a model has been proposed describing the processes by which Drosophila melanogaster responds to desiccation (Gibbs et al., 1997; Chippindale et al., 1998; Bradley et al., 1999). At 4 days post-eclosion, desiccation-resistant adults are larger than control adults because of an increased water content. This increase in store...|$|R
40|$|Respiratory {{water loss}} in insects is a {{controversial}} topic. Whilst earlier studies considered respiratory transpiration a significant component of overall water loss, {{to the extent}} that it was thought to be responsible not only for the evolution of discontinuous gas exchange cycles (DGCs) but also for variation in DGC patterns, later work repeatedly questioned its importance. In particular, investigations of the proportional contribution of respiratory transpiration to total water loss in species showing DGCs suggested that respiratory transpiration was unlikely to be important in these species. In turn, these studies have been criticized on analytical grounds. In this study we investigated variation in cuticular and respiratory water loss rates in five Scarabaeus dung beetle species, all of which show discontinuous gas exchange cycles, to ascertain the significance of respiratory water loss using modern analytical techniques. In particular, we determined whether there is variation in water loss rates amongst these beetles, whether both respiratory and cuticular water loss rates contribute significantly to variation in the former, and whether metabolic rate variation and variation in the duration of the DGC periods contribute significantly to variation in respiratory water loss rate. Total water loss rate varied such that species from arid areas had the lowest rates of water loss, and both <b>cuticular</b> and spiracular <b>transpiration</b> contributed significantly to variation in overall water loss rate. Moreover, variation in metabolic rate and in the duration of the DGC periods contributed significantly to variation in respiratory water loss rate. By contrast, examination of proportional water loss revealed little other than that it varies between 6. 5 % and 21 %, depending on the species and the temperature at which it was examined. Cuticular water loss scaled as mass 0. 721, but did not differ from that expected from geometric considerations alone. By contrast, respiratory water loss scaled as mass 0. 531, suggesting that gas exchange takes place by diffusion and convection. Our results provide direct evidence that respiratory water loss forms a significant component of water balance, and that changes in both metabolic rate and DGC characteristics contribute to modulation of respiratory water loss.

Separation of epicuticular wax into major components by gas-liquid chromatography indicated that ethofumesate decreased the deposition of n-nonocosane and n-nonocosan- 15 -one on cabbage leaves but increased the deposition of a minor component, the long chain waxy esters. EPTC was less inhibitory to n-nonocosan- 15 -one deposition than was ethofumesate. EPTC did not increase long chain waxy ester deposition. Scanning electron micrographs revealed that ethofumesate almost totally eliminated the epicuticular wax on cabbage leaves while EPTC only diminished it. <b>Cuticular</b> <b>transpiration</b> was increased by ethofumesate but not by EPTC.

We tested whether melanic females and non-melanic males of D. kikkawai have similar mechanisms of desiccation resistance. There is clinal variation in the amount of cuticular lipids per fly in males, but not in females. By contrast, for females, elevational increase in melanization is positively correlated with desiccation resistance and negatively with cuticular water loss, but there is no variation in the amount of cuticular lipids.

40|$|Grasshoppers of {{the species}} Schistocerca nitens (Thiinberg), Locusta migratoria (L.) and Tmethis pulchripennis (Bolivar) are able to {{withstand}} air temperatures higher than lethal internal temperature (48 °C) {{for more than an}} hour, during which time they maintain an internal temperature as much as 8 °C below air temperature.

The rate of evaporation and the ventilation frequency remain relatively constant at temperatures of up to about 45 °C, above which they both increase markedly. The depression of internal temperature thus appears to be caused by increased tracheal ventilation for evaporative cooling. This finding contradicts the common assumption that evaporative cooling is of little adaptive advantage for thermo-regulation in insects. In L. migratoria, the increase in ventilation appears to be achieved almost entirely by an increase in frequency of ventilation, although other species may alter tidal volume as well...|$|E

A role for feedback and peristomatal transpiration has been proposed. In this paper, we apply a recent mechanistic model of stomatal behaviour, and compare model and experimental data for the influence of increasing D on stomatal conductance. We manipulated cuticular conductance (gc) by three independent methods. First, we increased gc by using a solvent mixture applied to both leaf surfaces prior to determining stomatal responses to D; second, we increased gc by increasing leaf temperature at constant D; and third, we coated a small area of leaf with a light oil to decrease gc. In all three experiments, experimental data and model outputs showed very close agreement.

30|$|Indeed, the {{sclerophyllous}} {{character of}} the leaves of oak species made them least shrinkable {{as shown in the}} shrinkage classification table (Table  4). This feature enables the oak leaves to remain turgid as possible and therefore reduces the shrinkage potential. The leaves of Cistus species are less sclerophyllous than those of oaks, though they have a relatively thick cuticle that can mitigate the hydric stress effects (Aranda et al. 2014; Pardos et al. 2009; Bacelar et al. 2004; Bussotti et al. 2002). Therefore, Cistus leaves are classified as moderately shrinkable. The high shrinkage potential of P. pinaster and P. pinea {{can be explained by the}} prominence of two main parameters. Pine needles have, first, thin cuticle, allowing increased <b>cuticular</b> <b>transpiration</b> (Aranda et al. 2014; Pardos et al. 2009) and, secondly, pine needles are less sclerophyllous, depriving thereby the leaf of a mechanism limiting uncontrolled transpiration (Grill et al. 2004). This results in high desiccation susceptibility of the needles (Grill et al. 2004), which increases therefore the shrinkage potential (Bacelar et al. 2004). Otherwise, P. canariensis needles are less shrinkable than the other pine needles (Table  2). Pinus canariensis needles distance themselves from other pine needles through their particular epistomatal chamber, with a narrow aperture, where wax tubes are very dense and their small stomata compared to other pine species (Grill et al. 2004). These characteristics are responsible for the stomata occlusion (Jimenez et al. 2000; Zellnig et al. 2002). Thus, this arrangement of stomata cells inhibits transpiration (Zellnig et al. 2002) in order to limit water loss and then mitigate leaf shrinkage (Bacelar et al. 2004; Bussotti et al. 2002). In addition, <b>cuticular</b> <b>transpiration</b> in P. canariensis needles is the lowest among Pinus species (Pardos et al. 2009), showing even more fitness to keep water inside the needles, decreasing thereby the shrinkage potential (Bussotti et al. 2002). Furthermore, leaf shrinkage in P. canariensis varies significantly from a site to another. This result is in accordance with the following reports Climent et al. (2002), Grill et al. (2004), López et al. (2007) and Pardos et al. (2009) that highlighted a variation in the physiological response to hydric stress of P. canariensis needles from one site to the other. According to Grill et al. (2004), this is due to the variable anatomy of P. canariensis needles, which changes depending on environmental conditions.|$|E

After ABA treatment, imaging in transient nonphotorespiratory conditions (0. 1 % O 2) revealed a heterogeneous decrease of PSII photochemical yield. This decline was fully reversed by a transient high CO 2 concentration (7400 μmol mol− 1) in the leaf atmosphere.

40|$|The cuticular {{membrane}} (CM) of Nicotiana tabacum L., {{including the}} cellin wall (CW), was examined {{to gain more}} information about the nature and chemical constitution of its fine structure for possible inclusion in a model system, as recent literature questions its function as a major water permeability barrier. Different preparation techniques were used and the results evaluated to select a method for future studies on tobacco leaf cuticles. Fixation with OsO included in the primary fixative, either as a vapour or in combination with other agents, followed by OsO as post-fixative, gave good contrast of the CM. The lamellar structure of the tobacco cuticle proper (CP) was revealed by contrasting with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. The fine lamellar structure of the CP was very clearly contrasted when KMnO was included in the primary fixative. This was interpreted as indicating the tobacco CP to be polar. The reticulate fibrillar pattern of the tobacco cuticular layer (CL) containing polysaccharides was well contrasted when either OsO or paraformaldehyde were included in the primary fixative. Cold fixation with glutaraldehyde and dimethyl sulphoxide and post-fixation with OsO revealed electron-opaque material in the outer cutinized, irregularly outlined, region of the CW. These ultrahistochemical reactions are discussed in relation to the known chemical composition and possible water permeability of the CM. # 1996 Annals of Botany Company Key words: Cuticular fine structure, <b>cuticular</b> <b>transpiration,</b> Nicotiana tabacum L...|$|E
40|$|Cataglyphis is {{a fairly}} {{homogeneous}} ant genus which is widespread over the arid regions of the Old World. All Cataglyphis species are thermal specialists which are adapted to extreme environments where they forage at nearly lethal temperatures. This study focusses on two Cataglyphis species which differ considerably in their physical caste systems. These species have developed two alternative mechanisms facing extreme heat. In C. velox, foraging at high surface temperatures is clearly dependent on size: large C. velox workers forage at midday {{and are able to}} withstand higher temperatures than small workers. On the other hand, C. rosenhaueri has not developed great physical specialization, but the workers of this species have achieved physiological (such as low <b>cuticular</b> <b>transpiration</b> and metabolic rate), and behavioural adaptations (such as raising their abdomen to protect the vital organs contained in it from high temperatures) to tolerate thermal stress. The result is that small C. rosenhaueri workers may withstand extreme heat conditions in a similar way to large C. velox workers, and much better than small C. velox workers. The different mechanisms used by these two species to withstand extreme heat could reflect fundamental patterns of independent evolution. In some situations, selection may act to promote a relatively narrow size range of adult workers, all of them able to withstand thermal extremes, while in others it may act by producing different worker sizes with different tolerance to environmental conditions.

40|$|The {{successful}} {{ex vitro}} establishment of Dendrobium plantlets raised in vitro determines {{the quality of}} the end product (cut flowers or potted plants) in commercial production for economic gain. When in vitro Dendrobium plantlets are transplanted from the culture room to greenhouse conditions, they may desiccate or wilt rapidly and can die as a result of changes in the environment, unless substantial precautions are taken to adapt plantlets to a new environment. The acclimatization of in vitro-grown Dendrobium plantlets to an ex vitro environment by gradually weaning them towards ambient relative humidity and light levels facilitates better survival of young and physiologically sensitive plantlets. Dendrobium plantlets raised in vitro must thus undergo a period of acclimatization or transitional development to correct anatomical abnormalities and to enhance their physiological performance to ensure survival under ex vitro conditions. The most common approach to improve the survival of Dendrobium plantlets upon transfer to an ex vitro environment is their gradual adaptation to that environment. Under such conditions, plants convert rapidly from a heterotrophic or photomixotrophic state to an autotrophic growth, develop a fully functional root system, and better control their stomatal and <b>cuticular</b> <b>transpiration.</b> Gradual adaptation is carried out in a greenhouse by decreasing relative humidity using fog or mist chambers and by increasing light intensity using shading techniques. This review details the acclimatization and ex vitro survival of Dendrobium plants produced in vitro. This advice is also useful for other orchids...|$|E
40|$|To better {{understand}} the poor regulation of water loss after leaf development at high relative air humidity (RH), {{the relative importance of}} the physiological and anatomical components was analyzed focusing on cultivars with a contrasting sensitivity to elevated RH. The stomatal responsiveness to three closing stimuli (desiccation, abscisic acid feeding, light/dark transition), as well as several stomatal features (density, index, size and pore dimensions) and the <b>cuticular</b> <b>transpiration</b> rate (CTR) were determined in four rose cultivars, grown under moderate (60 %) and high (95 %) RH. Moreover, the effects of changes in stomatal density and pore dimensions on the stomatal conductance (gs) were quantified using {{a modified version of the}} Brown and Escombe equation. Higher water loss, as a result of plant growth at high RH, was primarily caused by an increase in residual gs, and to a lesser extent due to higher CTR. It was estimated that in leaflets subjected to desiccation the enhanced gs in high RH- as compared to moderate RH-grown plants was mostly due to poor stomatal functionality and to a lesser extent the combined result of higher stomatal density and longer pore length. It is concluded that the reduced degree and, specially, the reduced rate of stomatal closure are the primary causes of the large genotypic variation in the control of water loss in high RH-grown plants. Furthermore, it was found that although changes in stomatal length have no influence on stomatal functionality, changed anatomical features per se represent a significant and direct contribution to the increased water loss...|$|E
40|$|Cuticular waxes play {{a pivotal}} role in {{limiting}} transpirational water loss across the primary plant surface. The astomatous fruits of the tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) ‘MicroTom’ and its lecer 6 mutant, defective in a β-ketoacyl-coenzyme A synthase, which is involved in very-long-chain fatty acid elongation, were analyzed with respect to cuticular wax load and composition. The developmental course of fruit ripening was followed. Both the ‘MicroTom’ wild type and lecer 6 mutant showed similar patterns of quantitative wax accumulation, although exhibiting considerably different water permeances. With the exception of immature green fruits, the lecer 6 mutant exhibited about 3 - to 8 -fold increased water loss per unit time and fruit surface area when compared to the wild type. This was not the case with immature green fruits. The differences in final cuticular barrier properties of tomato fruits in both lines were fully developed already in the mature green to early breaker stage of fruit development. When the qualitative chemical composition of fruit cuticular waxes during fruit ripening was investigated, the deficiency in a β-ketoacyl-coenzyme A synthase in the lecer 6 mutant became discernible in the stage of mature green fruits mainly by a distinct decrease in the proportion of n-alkanes of chain lengths > C 28 and a concomitant increase in cyclic triterpenoids. This shift in cuticular wax biosynthesis of the lecer 6 mutant appears to be responsible for the simultaneously occurring increase of water permeance. Changes in cutin composition were also investigated as a function of developmental stage. This integrative functional approach demonstrates a direct relationship between <b>cuticular</b> <b>transpiration</b> barrier properties and distinct chemical modifications in cuticular wax composition during the course of tomato fruit development...|$|E
40|$|All {{terrestrial}} plants {{are covered with}} a cuticle composed of a cutin polymer and cuticular waxes. Plant cuticles provide protection against both abiotic and biotic stress. In the context of crop plants, protection against water-loss both {{in the field and}} during storage is of particular importance. Although there have been many reports on <b>cuticular</b> <b>transpiration,</b> the correlation between water loss and fruit cuticle is still not well understood. The hollow nature of pepper fruit limits its water storage capacity and severely reduces its shelf-life. Since pepper fruit has no stomata, most water is lost through the cuticle making pepper fruit a perfect model for cuticle transpiration studies. ^ Analysis of post-harvest water loss in near isogenic lines of pepper provided evidence of correlations between water loss and pepper cuticle. A larger analysis of different pepper cultivars from a world collection of peppers within the broader Capsicum genera revealed significant changes in both plant cuticle amount and composition. Providing further evidence that natural selection leads to adaptation of the plant cuticle to different environmental stimuli. ^ Glossy 1 is the Arabidopsis Wax 2 syn. CER 3 homologue in corn and was characterized as a wax mutant in its juvenile stage. Both glossy 1 and wax 2 were shown to have an altered cuticle structure, but neither was characterized as a cutin mutant. We report that both glossy 1 and its wax 2 homologue are indeed cutin mutants. We also report that a wax mutant in sorghum (bm 2) which also has an altered cutin structure is also a cutin mutant. This mutant showed remarkably similar wax and cutin profiles to another cuticle mutant in sorghum: bmlc. We report that bm 2 and bmlc are the same mutation based on rough mapping, allelism tests and cutin analysis. ^ Cowpea like all legumes is deficient in the sulfur containing amino acids, cysteine and methionine. In an attempt to improve its nutritive value, we transformed cowpea with a heterologous sunflower seed albumin gene. We report the results of this transformation. ...|$|E
40|$|Cuticular water {{permeance}} was manipulated in Corylus avellana L., Hypericum androsaemum L. and Populus tremula L. by (1) long-term {{application of}} low doses of various systemic herbicides inhibiting biosynthesis of cuticular waxes, (2) very short-term application of organic solvents to the leaf surface, and (3) exposure to natural strong winds. Treatment effects were very variable, but increased the natural range of permeances {{by a factor}} of 10 or so in undamaged leaves. All species had hypostomatous leaves. Relative change of leaf conductance (g) in response to stepwise increases of leaf-to-air water vapour pressure difference (VPD) was measured for individual leaves (Corylus) or groups of leaves at the shoot or branch tip. Adaxial cuticular water permeance (P) was determined for the same leaves after measurement of the VPD-response. A proportional measure of relative change of g with VPD, d(log(e) g) /dVPD, was then plotted against P. No increase in the strength of the closing response to increasing VPD was found with increasing P, as would have been expected if water loss through the cuticle was involved in stomatal response to changes in VPD via a direct effect on guard cell turgor. By contrast, high P coincided, most clearly in Corylus, with a reduced strength of the stomatal closing response to increasing VPD, i. e. less negative d(log(e) g) /dVPD. As the responses were non-linear, the value of d(log(e) g) /dI/PD changed with VPD. With rising VPD, all three species and a fourth one previously studied showed a decline in the value of d[d(log(e) g) /dVPD]/d(log P), reaching negative values in one species. This is interpreted in terms of two independent and antagonistic effects of increased cuticular water permeance on guard cell response to VPD, one acting by reducing the backpressure exerted on guard cells by the epidermis, and the other one possibly causing greater depression of guard cell turgor through delivery of more chemical messengers (such as abscisic acid) to the guard cells with the <b>cuticular</b> <b>transpiration</b> stream...|$|E
40|$|Today, the world’s {{surface is}} {{strongly}} influenced by human activities and thus the present-day geological era has been termed the Anthropocene. One of the strongest anthropogenic drivers is land use influencing habitats and species worldwide. Additionally, global climate is shaped by human activities, and since climatic conditions have strong effects on the distribution and fitness of organisms, this is the {{also one of the}} most important anthropogenic impacts on ecosystems. Hence, both factors affect diversity of species and habitats, but also ecosystem functioning and services. Analysing species diversity is a well-established method to draw conclusions on ecosystem functioning, because the stability of ecosystems increases with species richness and abundance. It is also possible to measure species’ responses in ecosystems, using functional diversity as a predictor. Species traits are features or measurable properties that may be related to the effect or response of a species in an ecosystem (e. g. nutrition specialisation or distribution) and play an important role to determine functional diversity. In this thesis, I analyse and combine the effects of land use and temperature on arthropods in general but also on moths as a case study, which is an unattended but diverse taxonomic group. I consider different levels as (1) Arthropod communities in general, (2) moths as a functional group, (3) morphological variability of single species, and (4) physiological variability of single individuals and show how specialists and generalists differ in their response and effect traits and how these differences have effects on the different levels. Main parts of this thesis were performed in the Biodiversity-Exploratories, a research platform that focuses on effects of land-use intensity on biodiversity and ecological processes in forests and grasslands in three different regions in Germany The first study focussed on beech herbivory affected by harvesting intensity and beech dominance. For this purpose, we determined leaf damage and collected Arthropod herbivores in three different regions distributed across Germany. The results suggest a general negative effect of intensive land-use on forest herbivores and the strongest negative effect appeared early in the growing season. For the second and third study, we collected more than 5000 moths from the same three regions, and focussed on grasslands. We determined 461 different species, assigned several interspecific life-history traits (describing specialisation on resources or reproductive strategies), and additionally measured morphological traits (body mass and wing area) of more than 2000 individuals. In the second study, we analysed the effect of land-use intensity (as grazing, mowing and fertilisation) on species diversity and trait composition in moth communities. With increasing land-use intensity, a general decrease of species diversity across all regions was apparent, but also a shift to generalised species, which leads to functional homogenisation in ecosystems. Mowing had the strongest negative effect. The third study focused on intraspecific effects based on morphological changes with increasing land-use intensity. We found several species that benefit from the application of fertilisers due to an increasing body mass, which enhances reproduction success of insects. Such species are mostly generalists, but were still not able to increase their abundance in stronger managed habitats in contrast to other species. In the fourth study, we analysed transpiration and metabolic rate from 557 different arthropod individuals of forest and grassland sites. For this I developed a simple and effective method to measure water loss of several samples within a short period, which we describe in detail in this chapter. Specimen from grassland sites, representing arid habitats in contrast to forests, show generally lower water loss rates. These species developed strategies decreasing <b>cuticular</b> <b>transpiration,</b> resulting in a higher effect of respiratory transpiration on total water loss. In the fifth study, we kept caterpillars of 30 species in different temperature treatments analysing the survival and growth rate in response to the surrounding temperature. Additionally we measured transpiration and metabolic rate. All species showed in general a lower survival rate and increasing growth, transpiration and metabolic rate with higher temperature and especially specialists face a higher risk from increasing temperature. Hence, this thesis shows similar effects of land use and climate change, as both drivers lead to a general loss of diversity and a shift towards more generalistic communities. Communities of specialists are, however, important to decrease homogenisation and thus receive ecosystem functions. These results provide important information for national and international policies and to support the development of sustainable land-use methods and to reduce climate change...|$|E
