The key parameter of EHRA is to fix the watercourse <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>flow</b> <b>area</b> corresponding to EHR, by which the relation between parabola shaped <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>flow</b> <b>area</b> and hydraulic radius is deduced. The EHRA not only meets the requirement of flow velocity for adequate fish spawning migration, but also is applicable to the ecological flows in regard with other ecological issues (such as the calculation of the instream flow requirements for transporting sediment and for pollution self-purification, etc.). This essay has illuminated the computational process taking the estimation of ecological water requirement of Zhuba Hydrological Station watercourse in Niqu branch of the Yalong River as an example. Additionally, we compare EHRA with Tennant approach. The result shows that the Zhuba Hydrological Station ecological water requirement calculated by EHRA lies between the minimum and favorable ecological water requirement calculated by the Tennant approach. This {{is due to the}} fact that the ecological flow velocity (such as the fish spawning migration flow velocity) was taken into consideration, producing results applicable to the practical situation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract – The {{determination}} of hydraulic properties of open-channels and rivers {{is very important}} in water resources management and engineering. Geostatistical estimation methods in comparison with direct measurements and/or using mathematical models can be more cost and time effective. The objective {{of this study is to}} evaluate the possibility of applying cokriging and residual kriging methods to estimate some hydraulic parameters of rivers or open-channels. The results indicate that cokriging can be used to estimate <b>flow</b> <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>area,</b> <b>flow</b> velocity and hydraulic radius, while residual kriging can be used to estimate <b>flow</b> <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>area,</b> <b>flow</b> velocity and water surface level elevation. It is concluded that water surface width is preferable to water depth as an auxiliary variable in the cokriging method. The relative error of estimation for geostatistical estimators was about 0. 87 to 22 %. Thus, these methods can be considered appropriate and the user’s expected accuracy is important in choosing the geostatistical estimators for estimation of hydraulic parameters in open-channels or rivers. In general, cokriging and residual kriging can be used to estimate open-channel hydraulic parameters by using 25 % (29 data) of measured data instead of 115 measured cross-sections along the channel or river with minimal cost and the least amount of time...|$|R

40|$|Where rivers {{near the}} coastline, the {{receiving}} basin begins to influence flow, and gradually varied, nonuniform flow conditions arise. The {{section of the}} river affected by nonuniform flow is typically {{referred to as the}} backwater segment, and for large lowland rivers, this portion of the river can extend many hundreds of kilometers above the outlet. River morphology and kinematics vary in the backwater segment; however, these channel properties have not been explicitly related to properties of the flow and sediment-transport fields. This study examines the influence of spatially and temporally varying flow velocity and sediment transport on channel properties for the lower 800 km of the Mississippi River, a section of the river that includes the backwater segment. Survey transects (n = 2650) were used to constrain the cross-sectional area of water flow every ∼ 312 m along the Mississippi River channel for eight successive intervals of water discharge. Assuming conservation of water discharge, the local flow velocity was calculated at each transect by dividing water discharge by the local measurement of <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>flow</b> <b>area.</b> Calculated flow velocity was converted to total bed stress using a dimensionless friction coefficient that was determined by optimizing the match between a predicted and a measured water-surface profile. Estimates for the skin-friction component of the total bed stress were produced from the values for total shear stress using a form-drag correction. These skin-friction bed-stress values were then used to model bed-material transport. Results demonstrate that in the lower Mississippi River, <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>flow</b> <b>area</b> increases downstream during low- and moderate-water discharge. This generates a decrease in calculated water-flow velocity and bed-material transport. During high-water discharge, the trend is reversed: <b>Cross-sectional</b> <b>flow</b> <b>area</b> decreases downstream, producing an increase in calculated water-flow velocity and bed-material transport. An important contribution of this work is the identification of a downstream reversal in the trend for channel cross-sectional area due to variable water discharge. By accounting for the spatial divergences in sediment transport predicted over an average annual hydrograph, we demonstrate the tendency for channel-bed aggradation in much of the backwater reach of the Mississippi River (150 – 600 km above the outlet); however, a region of channel-bed erosion is calculated for the final 150 km. These results help to explain the spatial variability of channel morphology and kinematics for the lower Mississippi River, and they can be extended to other lowland river systems near the coastline...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} varying the <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>flow</b> <b>area</b> of the {{passages}} of a wave rotor is examined {{by means of the}} method of characteristics. An idealized expansion wave, an idealized inlet port, and an idealized compression stage are considered. It is found that area variation does not have a very significant effect on the expansion wave, nor on the compression stage. For the expansion wave, increasing the passage area in the flow direction has the same effect as a diffuser, so that the flow emerges at a lower velocity than it would for the constant area case. This could be advantageous. The inlet is strongly affected by the area variation, as it changes the strength of the hammer shock wave, thereby changing the pressure behind it. In this case, reduction in the passage area in the flow direction leads to increased pressure. However, this result is dependent {{on the assumption that the}} inlet conditions remain constant with area variation. This may not be the case...|$|E
40|$|The genetic {{algorithm}} (GA) technique {{is applied to}} obtain optimal parameter values of the standard rating curve model (RCM) for predicting, in real time, event-based flow discharge hydrographs at sites receiving significant lateral inflows. The standard RCM uses the information of discharge and effective <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>flow</b> <b>area</b> at an upstream station and effective <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>flow</b> <b>area</b> wave travel time later at a downstream station to predict the flow rate at this last site. The GA technique obtains the optimal parameter values of the model, here defined as the GA-RCM model, by minimizing the mean absolute error objective function. The GA-RCM model was tested to predict hydrographs at three different stations, located on the Upper Tiber River in central Italy. The wave travel times characterizing the three selected river branches are, on the average, 4, 8, and 12 h. For each river reach, seven events were employed, four for the model parameters' calibration and three for model testing. The GA approach, employing 100 chromosomes in the initial gene pool, 75 % crossover rate, 5 % mutation rate, and 10, 000 iterations, made the GA-RCM model successfully simulate the hydrographs observed at each downstream section closely capturing the trend, time to peak, and peak rates with, on the average, less than 5 % error. The model performance was also tested against the standard RCM model, which uses, on the contrary to the GA-RCM model, different values for the model parameters and wave travel time for each event, thus, making {{the application of the}} standard RCM for real time discharge monitoring inhibited. The comparative results revealed that the RCM model improved its performance by using the GA technique in estimating parameters. The sensitivity analysis results revealed that at most two events would be sufficient for the GA-RCM model to obtain the optimal values of the model parameters. A lower peak hydrograph can also be employed in the calibration to predict a higher peak hydrograph. Similarly, a shorter travel time hydrograph can be used in GA to obtain optimal model parameters {{that can be used to}} simulate floods characterized by longer travel time. For its characteristics, the GA-RCM model is suitable for the monitoring of discharge in real time, at river sites where only water levels are observed...|$|E
30|$|The annular volute is {{typically}} {{used in a}} slurry pump to reduce the collisions between solid particles and the volute tongue and to achieve a better resistance to blocking.

Experimental tests were conducted to validate the numerical results. The results indicated that, when the volute casing flow area increases, the hydraulic performance decreases marginally under the rated working conditions, but increases at the off-design points, specifically under large flow condition. However, the volute casing with a larger flow area has a wider high-efficiency region. In addition, the increase in the volute casing flow area will decrease the pressure pulsations in the volute, regardless of the working condition, and decrease the radial force on the shaft, therefore, providing an improved pump operational stability. It is anticipated that this study will be of benefit during the design of annular volutes.|$|E
40|$|An {{improved}} type of {{exhaust nozzle}} has been invented to help optimize {{the performances of}} multitube detonative combustion engines. The invention is applicable to both air-breathing and rocket engines used to propel some aircraft and spacecraft, respectively. In a detonative combustion engine, thrust is generated through the expulsion of combustion products from a detonation process in which combustion {{takes place in a}} reaction zone coupled to a shock wave. The combustion releases energy to sustain the shock wave, while the shock wave enhances the combustion in the reaction zone. The coupled shockwave/reaction zone, commonly referred to as a detonation, propagates through the reactants at very high speed. typically of the order of several thousands of feet per second (of the order of 1 km/s). The very high speed of the detonation forces combustion to occur very rapidly, thereby contributing to high thermodynamic efficiency. A detonative combustion engine of the type to which the present invention applies includes multiple parallel cylindrical combustion tubes, each closed at the front end and open at the rear end. Each tube is filled with a fuel/oxidizer mixture, and then a detonation wave is initiated at the closed end. The wave propagates rapidly through the fuel/oxidizer mixture, producing very high pressure due to the rapid combustion. The high pressure acting on the closed end of the tube contributes to forward thrust. When the detonation wave reaches the open end of the tube, it produces a blast wave, behind which the high-pressure combustion products are expelled from the tube. The process of filling each combustion tube with a detonable fuel/oxidizer mixture and then producing a detonation repeated rapidly to obtain repeated pulses of thrust. Moreover, the multiple combustion tubes are filled and fired in a repeating sequence. Hence, the pressure at the outlet of each combustion tube varies cyclically. A nozzle of the present invention channels the expansion of the pulsed combustion gases from the multiple combustion tubes into a common exhaust stream, in such a manner as to enhance performance in two ways: (1) It reduces the cyclic variations of pressure at the outlets of the combustion tubes so as to keep the pressure approximately constant near the optimum level needed for filling the tubes, regardless of atmospheric pressure at the altitude of operation; and (2) It maximizes the transfer of momentum from the exhaust gas to the engine, thereby maximizing thrust. The figure depicts a typical engine equipped with a nozzle according to the invention. The nozzle includes an interface section comprising multiple intake ports that couple the outlets of the combustion tubes to a common plenum. Proceeding from its upstream to its downstream end, the interface section tapers to a larger <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>area</b> for <b>flow.</b> This taper fosters expansion of the exhaust gases flowing from the outlets of the combustion tubes and contributes to the desired equalization of exhaust combustion pressure. The <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>area</b> for <b>flow</b> in the common plenum is greater than, or at least equal to, the combined <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>flow</b> <b>areas</b> of the combustor tubes. In the common plenum, the exhaust streams from the individual combustion tubes mix to form a single compound subsonic exhaust stream. Downstream of the common plenum is the throat that tapers to a smaller flow cross section. In this throat, the exhaust gases become compressed to form a compound sonic gas stream. Downstream of the throat is an expansion section, which typically has a bell or a conical shape. (The expansion section can be truncated or even eliminated {{in the case of an}} air-breathing engine.) After entering the expansion section, the exhaust gases expand rapidly from compound sonic to compound supersonic speeds and are then vented to the environment. The basic invention admits of numerous variations. For example, the combustion tubes can be arranged around the central axin a symmetrical or asymmetrical pattern other than the one shown in the figure. For another example, the <b>flow</b> <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>area(s)</b> of one or more of the intake ports in the interface section, of the common plenum, the throat, and/or the expansion section can be varied, either symmetrically or asymmetrically, to adjust dynamics of the exhaust stream or to direct the thrust vector away from the central axis...|$|R

40|$|Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA) and {{accelerated}} fatigue testing {{were used in}} an attempt to assess the durability of two cardiac value bioprostheses. The LDA system was used to monitor the function of the cardiac valves over time. This was done through flow characterization in an aortic flow chamber, designed to closely simulate in vivo conditions, both in the near vicinity (sinuses of valsalva region) and also somewhat downstream (aortic region) from the values. The accelerated fatigue tester was operated by opening and closing the valves at a rate of 1300 R. P. M., about 18 x the normal rate. The results from the two test valves indicate a definite change in the flow characteristics downstream from the valve after certain accelerated test intervals. The high velocity <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>flow</b> <b>area</b> seems to increase over time in use, causing a decrease in the peak velocity. The tissue became more flaccid in certain areas, and tears were apparent at about 9. 4 million cycles for the Ionescu-Shiley valve and at 24 million cycles for the Carpentier-Edwards valve.

40|$|A new {{methodology}} for estimating the discharge {{starting from the}} monitoring of surface flow velocity, usurf, is proposed. The approach, based on the entropy theory, involves the actual location of maximum flow velocity, umax, which may occur below the water surface (dip phenomena), affecting the shape of velocity profile. The method identifies the two-dimensional velocity distribution in the <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>flow</b> <b>area,</b> just sampling usurf and applying an iterative procedure to estimate both the dip and umax. Five gage sites, for which a large velocity dataset is available, are used as a case study. Results show that the method is accurate in simulating the depth-averaged velocities along the verticals and the mean flow velocity with an error, on average, lower than 12 % and 6 %, respectively. The comparison with the velocity index method for the estimation of the mean flow velocity using the measured usurf, demonstrates that the method proposed here is more accurate mainly for rivers with a lower aspect ratio where secondary currents are expected. Moreover, the dip assessment is found more representative of the actual location of maximum flow velocity {{with respect to the}} one estimated by a different entropy approach. In terms of discharge, the errors do not exceed 3 % for high floods, showing the good potentiality of the method to be used for the monitoring of these events...|$|E
30|$|Another {{important}} point to consider, although sometimes neglected, is the 14 % higher viscosity of helium compared with nitrogen.

This could potentially increase part of the respiratory resistances, because of a larger <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>area</b> <b>flow</b> is mainly laminar in the distal airways, even in obstructive diseases. Moreover, this might have additional clinical implications both for research purpose as well as for care and monitoring, because flow and volume are sometimes measured by methods that need a correcting factor for viscosity (i.e., via pneumotachograph). More generally, useful publications are available that describe the consequences of the use of helium both for mechanical ventilators and for monitoring devices, such as capnometers [2, 3].|$|R

40|$|Ploughed upland drains are {{straight}} prismatic channels of low aspect ratio. The drains are either uniformly or compositely roughened. In compositely roughened drains {{the bed and}} side-walls are differentially roughened although each roughness type is homogeneous. Upland catchments, containing extensive ploughed drainage networks, are particularly prone to flash flooding and increased sediment yield. However, the basic hydraulic data necessary to route flow through the drainage network and improve the engineering design of stable drainage channels are currently unavailable. A logarithmic flow resistance equation is developed for low aspect ratio channels, where the effective Nikuradse equivalent grain size is known. Testing against field data indicates that the relationship successfully predicts the resistance to uniform flow through upland drains. The performance of eight composite roughness formulae to predict the mean velocity in differentially roughened channels is compared. The composite roughness equations involve dividing the <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>flow</b> <b>area</b> {{into a number of}} sub-areas. The different methods of cross-sectional area division are considered and their effect on mean velocity prediction examined. Preferences are indicated concerning composite roughness equations which predict the mean velocity in channels of simple cross-sectional shape. Empirical equations are derived to determine the mean bed and side-wall shear stresses in straight symmetrical trapezoidal and rectangular open channels, with uniform or composite roughness. The model proposed is appropriate for stable sub-critical and super-critical flows. The equations are based on data collected from laboratory channels and should be cautiously applied to larger scale channels.

The measurements were taken on different days for various water depths in the canals. Third, the surface and mean cross-sectional velocities were divided, yielding the surface velocity coefficient, for every measurement {{at each of the}} five locations. Several channel bed elevations were also measured near each location along a distance of 100 m or more, as necessary, to define the average longitudinal bed slope. Linear equations and averages were developed from the relationship between the velocity ratios and critical depth, and between those ratios and the measured water depths. Finally, the approximate cross-sectional velocity profiles for several of the measurement instances were produced using GIS software. All the steps mentioned above were followed to determine surface velocity coefficients for use with the float method. The results in the five locations show that the coefficients are not proportional to the water depth variation, and that the presence of rocks and sediment in the channel bed affect the coefficient values. Consequently, the development of a linear relation among coefficients to correct the surface velocity obtained from float method was difficult to obtain from the available data. In the five measurement locations, the surface velocity coefficients vary from 0. 33 to 0. 81 and the measured water depths during the period of evaluation were from 0. 16 m to 0. 53 m.

The initial tests with 100, 500, and 1, 000 ppm NO in pure nitrogen have shown that a greater than 50 % reduction of NO/NO{sub x} is readily achievable. Different flow rates of the monatomic nitrogen and the gas stream were tested. The flow rate of the monatomic nitrogen did not {{have a significant effect on}} the reduction efficiency, unlike the flow rate of the gas stream. The <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>flow</b> <b>area</b> of the gas stream was varied in order to assess whether the proximity of the gas stream to the arc would affect NO/NO{sub x} reduction. Results of the tests revealed that the smallest cross-sectional area gave the best reduction, but it also had the greatest chance of contacting the arc. The composition of the gas stream was also varied to elucidate the effects of NO{sub 2 } and O{sub 2 } on the NO/NO{sub x} reduction efficiency. When NO{sub 2 } and O{sub 2 } are present in the gas stream, both gases lower the reduction efficiency significantly by creating more NO or NO{sub 2 }.

BackgroundAlthough estrogen reportedly dilates coronary arteries in vitro, the site and mechanisms of its action have not been fully defined in vivo. MethodsEpicardial coronary artery dimensions and coronary flow velocity were assessed using simultaneous intracoronary two-dimensional and Doppler ultrasound. ResultsEstrogen (0. 1 and 1 μmol/liter) induced {{a significant increase in}} coronary <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>area,</b> <b>flow</b> velocity and volumetric blood flow. Estrogen-induced vasodilation was not influenced either by pretreatment with Nω-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME) (100 μmol/liter intracoronary), indomethacin (5 mg/kg body weight intravenously), propranolol (0. 75 mg/kg intravenously) or the classic estrogen receptor antagonist ICI 182, 780 (10 μmol/liter). Balloon denudation of the endothelium did not attenuate estrogen-induced epicardial vasodilation. Pretreatment with glibenclamide (10 μmol/liter) attenuated estrogeninduced vasodilation only in epicardial arteries, as did verapamil (0. 1 μmol/liter). Estrogen had no effect on a phenylephrine dose-response curve in either epicardial coronary arteries or the microcirculation. ConclusionsAcute estrogen-induced dilation in canine coronary arteries is endothelium independent and is not mediated by the classic intracellular estrogen receptor but through nongenomic mechanisms, presumably at the membrane level, which in epicardial arteries may include effects on adenosine triphosphate-sensitive potassium or calcium channels, or both...|$|R
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of N atoms, nitrogen, induced by a pulsed electric arc, in reducing nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO{sub 2 }) was studied. Goal is reduction of nitrogen oxides (NO{sub x}) from automobile emissions by this alternative technique, {{which can be}} cost-effective and {{has the potential to}} reduce NO{sub x} in exhaust containing up to 10 % oxygen. Initial tests with 100, 500, and 1, 000 ppM NO in pure nitrogen have shown that a greater than 50 % reduction of NO/NO{sub x} is readily achievable. At an NO concentration of 100 ppM, a greater than 90 % NO/NO{sub x} reduction was recorded. Different flow rates of the monatomic nitrogen and the gas stream were tested. The flow rate of the monatomic nitrogen did not {{have a significant effect on}} the reduction efficiency, unlike the flow rate of the gas stream. The <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>flow</b> <b>area</b> of the gas stream was varied in order to assess whether the proximity of the gas stream to the arc would affect NO/NO{sub x} reduction. Results of the tests revealed that the smallest cross-sectional area had the best reduction, but also the highest chance of contacting the arc. The composition of the gas stream was also varied to elucidate the effects of N 0 {sub 2 } and 0 {sub 2 } on the NO/NO{sub x} reduction efficiency. When N 0 {sub 2 } and 0 {sub 2 } are present in the gas stream, both gases lower the reduction efficiency significantly by creating more NO or N 0 {sub 2 }. Experiments are continuing to improve the reduction efficiency. The electrical power, a function of pulse frequency, voltage, and current, was treated as a key parameter in the investigation. The power consumption of the high-voltage purser apparatus for a 100 -kW engine was estimated to be 3 kW...|$|E
40|$|The hybrid sulfur process (HyS) {{hydrogen}} electrolyzer {{consists of}} a proton exchange membrane (PEM) sandwiched between two porous graphite layers. An aqueous solution of sulfuric acid with dissolved SO{sub 2 } gas flows parallel to the PEM through the porous graphite layer on the anode side of the electrolyzer. A flow distributor, consisting {{of a number of}} parallel channels acting as headers, promotes uniform flow of the anolyte fluid through the porous graphite layer. A numerical model of the hydraulic behavior of the flow distributor is herein described. This model was developed to be a tool to aid the design of flow distributors. The primary design objective is to minimize spatial variations in the flow through the porous graphite layer. The hydraulic data from electrolyzer tests consists of overall flowrate and pressure drop. Internal pressure and flow distributions are not measured, but these details are provided by the model. The model has been benchmarked against data from tests of the current electrolyzer. The model reasonably predicts the viscosity effect of changing the fluid from water to an aqueous solution of 30 % sulfuric acid. The permeability of the graphite layer was the independent variable used to fit the model to the test data, and the required permeability for a good fit is within the range literature values for carbon paper. The model predicts that reducing the number of parallel channels by 50 % will substantially improve the uniformity of the flow in the porous graphite layer, while maintaining an acceptable pressure drop across the electrolyzer. When the size of the electrolyzer is doubled from 2. 75 inches square to 5. 5 inches square, the same number of channels as in the current design will be adequate, but it is advisable to increase the channel <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>flow</b> <b>area.</b> This is due to the increased length of the channels...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the exergy analysis and optimization of the Stirling engine, which has enormous potential {{for use in}} the renewable energy industry as it is quiet, efficient, and can operate with a variety of different heat sources and, therefore, has multi-fuel capabilities. This work aims to present a method that can be used by a Stirling engine designer to quickly and efficiently find near-optimal or optimal Stirling engine geometry and operating conditions. The model applies the exergy analysis methodology to the ideal-adiabatic Stirling engine model. In the past, this analysis technique has only been applied to highly idealized Stirling cycle models and this study shows its use in the realm of Stirling cycle optimization when applied to a more complex model. The implicit filtering optimization algorithm is used to optimize the engine as it quickly and efficiently computes the optimal geometry and operating frequency that gives maximum net-work output at a fixed energy input. A numerical example of a 1, 000 [*]cm 3 engine is presented, where the geometry and operating frequency of the engine are optimized for four different regenerator mesh types, varying heater inlet temperature and a fixed energy input of 15 [*]kW. The WN 200 mesh is seen to perform best of the four mesh types analyzed, giving the greatest net-work output and efficiency. The optimal values of several different engine parameters are presented in the work. It is shown that the net-work output and efficiency increase with increasing heater inlet temperature. The optimal dead-volume ratio, swept volume ratio, operating frequency, and phase angle are all shown to decrease with increasing heater inlet temperature. In terms of the heat exchanger geometry, the heater and cooler tubes are seen to decrease in size and the cooler and heater effectiveness is seen to decrease with increasing heater temperature, whereas the regenerator is seen to increase in size and effectiveness. In terms of the regenerator mesh type, {{it was found that the}} WN 200 mesh gave a shorter regenerator with greater <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>flow</b> <b>area</b> which gave a smaller pressure drop...|$|E
25|$|Echocardiography is a {{non-invasive}} method of quantifying cardiac output using ultrasound. Two-dimensional (2D) ultrasound and Doppler measurements are used together to calculate cardiac output. 2D {{measurement of the}} diameter (d) of the aortic annulus allows calculation of the <b>flow</b> <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>area</b> (CSA), which is then multiplied by the VTI of the Doppler flow profile across the aortic valve to determine the flow volume per beat (stroke volume, SV). The result is then multiplied by the heart rate (HR) to obtain cardiac output. Although used in clinical medicine, it has a wide test-retest variability. It is said to require extensive training and skill, but the exact steps needed to achieve clinically adequate precision have never been disclosed. 2D measurement of the aortic valve diameter is one source of noise; others are beat-to-beat variation in stroke volume and subtle differences in probe position. An alternative {{that is not necessarily}} more reproducible is the measurement of the pulmonary valve to calculate right-sided CO. Although it is in wide general use, the technique is time consuming and is limited by the reproducibility of its component elements. In the manner used in clinical practice, precision of SV and CO is of the order of ±20%.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a method to}} predict fluid-induced structural vibrations in liquid-conveying pipe systems. A previously reported transfer matrix method has been extended to include predictions for long pipes. The length-diameter ratio of the simulated circuit has been increased from the previously reported value of 17. 5 to 207. When compared to the experimental data from two different pipe conjigurations, excellent agreement {{was found between the}} measured and predicted resonant frequencies. However, at these resonant frequencies, the predicted oscillation levels were overestimated. This problem, which has been overlooked in previous fluid-structural coupling studies, can be resolved by the introduction of frequency-dependent viscosity in thefluid.

40|$|Boiling {{can provide}} several orders of {{magnitude}} higher performance than a traditional air cooled system in electronics cooling application. It can dissipate large quantities of heat while maintaining a low surface temperature to fluid difference. Flow boiling with microchannels has shown a great potential with its high surface {{area to volume ratio}} and latent heat removal. However, flow instabilities and early critical heat flux (CHF) have prevented its successful implementation. A novel flow boiling design based on a mechanistic approach is taken to overcome the above mentioned disadvantages while presenting a very low pressure drop. The design uses open microchannels with tapered manifold (OMM) to provide stable and efficient operation. The tapered manifold above the microchannels provides an increasing <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>area</b> in the <b>flow</b> direction. The extra <b>flow</b> <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>area</b> allows bubbles to emerge from the microchannels and expand in the manifold along the flow direction. Using a 6 % taper and a moderately high inlet liquid flow Reynolds number of 1095, a CHF of 1. 07 kW/cm^ 2 with a heat transfer coefficient of 295 kW/m^ 2 °C and a pressure drop of 30 kPa was recorded. Baseline test with uniform manifold were conducted and compared with tapered geometry. The experimental data was substantiated with pressure drop modeling for the new geometry. High speed visualization was also conducted to understand the underlying mechanism in the tapered configuration...|$|R
