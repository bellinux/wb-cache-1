5|$|Further controversies have {{occurred}} {{because of the}} company's involvement in the Middle East. The opening of a Burger King location in the Israeli-occupied territories led to a breach of contract dispute between Burger King and its Israeli franchise; the dispute eventually erupted into a geopolitical conflagration involving Muslim and Jewish groups on multiple continents over the application of and adherence to international law. The case eventually elicited reactions from {{the members of the}} 22-nation Arab League; the Islamic countries within the League made a joint threat to the company of legal sanctions including the revocation of Burger King's business licenses within the member states' territories. A second issue involving members of the Islamic faith over the interpretation of the Muslim version of Canon Law, Shariah, regarding the promotional artwork on a dessert package in the United Kingdom raised issues of cultural sensitivity, and, with the former example, posed a larger question about the lengths that <b>companies</b> <b>must</b> go to insure the smooth operation of their businesses in the communities they serve.|$|E
5|$|On October 25, 2011, the HDMI Forum was {{established}} by the HDMI founders to create an open organization so that interested companies can participate {{in the development of}} the HDMI specification. All members of the HDMI Forum have equal voting rights, may participate in the Technical Working Group, and if elected can be on the Board of Directors. There is no limit to the number of companies allowed in the HDMI Forum though <b>companies</b> <b>must</b> pay an annual fee of US$15,000 with an additional annual fee of $5,000 for those companies who serve on the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors will be made up of 11 companies who are elected every 2 years by a general vote of HDMI Forum members. All future development of the HDMI specification will take place in the HDMI Forum and will be built upon the HDMI 1.4b specification. Also on the same day HDMI Licensing, LLC announced that there were over 1,100 HDMI adopters and that over 2 billion HDMI-enabled products had shipped since the launch of the HDMI standard. From October 25, 2011, all development of the HDMI specification became the responsibility of the newly created HDMI Forum.|$|E

To become an NAED allied partner a <b>company</b> <b>must</b> be a marketing group, service or technology organization and must meet NAED criteria.|$|R
50|$|The Act puts certain {{restrictions}} on proprietary {{companies such as}} not permitting them {{to have more than}} 50 members (shareholders). Another important restriction relates to fundraising. A proprietary <b>company</b> <b>must</b> not engage in fundraising that would require a disclosure document such as a prospectus, an offer information statement, or a profile statement to be issued (sec.113(3)). The Act states in which circumstances a <b>company</b> <b>must</b> issue a prospectus when attempting to raise funds. This means that a proprietary <b>company</b> <b>must</b> not offer its shares to the public.|$|R

25|$|In March 2016, OSHA officially {{mandated}} that <b>companies</b> <b>must</b> provide certain safety measures for employees {{who work with}} or around silica, {{in order to prevent}} silicosis, lung cancer, and other silica-related diseases.|$|E
25|$|In the U.S., the Credit CARD Act of 2009 {{specifies}} {{that credit}} card <b>companies</b> <b>must</b> send cardholders a notice 45 {{days before they}} can increase or change certain fees. This includes annual fees, cash advance fees, and late fees.|$|E
25|$|In Britain, {{legislation}} {{has been passed}} allowing parents of children under six to request a more flexible work schedule. <b>Companies</b> <b>must</b> approve this request {{as long as it}} does not damage the business. A 2003 Survey of graduates in the UK revealed that graduates value flexibility even more than wages.|$|E
50|$|To {{create a}} planned digital strategy, the <b>company</b> <b>must</b> review their digital {{proposition}} (what you are offering to consumers) and communicate it using digital customer targeting techniques. So, they must define online value proposition (OVP), {{this means the}} <b>company</b> <b>must</b> express clearly what they are offering customers online e.g. brand positioning.|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} {{conditions}} {{that must be}} present for a company to engage in successful price discrimination. First, the <b>company</b> <b>must</b> have market power. Second, the <b>company</b> <b>must</b> be able to sort customers according to their willingness {{to pay for the}} good. Third, the firm must be able to prevent resell.|$|R

25|$|However, {{the notable}} {{developments}} of these <b>companies</b> <b>must</b> {{be seen as}} necessary adaptations to the technological progress of the western film industries whose films they were importing. One example here being {{the establishment of the}} Marmara Dubbing Studio in the early 1930s, when the silent era came to an end in the West and sound films became the standard, prompting the import-dependent companies to adjust themselves to the new technological requirements.|$|E
25|$|Each {{company has}} its own unique {{turnover}} drivers so <b>companies</b> <b>must</b> continually work to identify the issues that cause turnover in their company. Further the causes of attrition vary within a company such that causes for turnover in one department might {{be very different from}} the causes of turnover in another department. Companies can use exit interviews to find out why employees are leaving and the problems they encountered in the workplace.|$|E
25|$|Additional {{provisions}} {{set forth}} by Dodd–Frank in section 972 require public companies to disclose in proxy statements reasons for why the current CEO {{and chairman of the}} board hold their positions. The same rule applies to new appointments for CEO or chairman of the board. Public <b>companies</b> <b>must</b> find reasons supporting their decisions to retain an existing chairman of the board or CEO or reasons for selecting new ones to keep shareholders informed.|$|E

50|$|In the United Kingdom, every <b>company</b> <b>must</b> have {{formally}} appointed company officers. By statute, {{a private}} <b>company</b> <b>must</b> {{have at least}} one director and until April 2008 also had to have a secretary. The company's articles of association may require more than one director. At least one director must be an individual, not another company.|$|R
25|$|Tax rules {{recognize}} that {{some types of}} businesses do not earn income in the traditional manner and thus require special provisions. For example, insurance <b>companies</b> <b>must</b> ultimately pay claims to some policy holders from the amounts received as premiums. These claims may happen years after the premium payment. Computing the future amount of claims requires actuarial estimates until claims are actually paid. Thus, recognizing premium income as received and claims expenses as paid would seriously distort an insurance company's income.|$|E
25|$|In 1997, the City of San Francisco {{passed a}} law that all <b>companies</b> <b>must</b> provide the same {{benefits}} for domestic partners as for their spouses in attempt to extend rights to gay couples and common law heterosexual relationships. Levada objected that this violated Catholic teaching on the unique status of marriage, and circumvented the provisions by stating that unmarried employees of the archdiocese could designate any person sharing the same address as their beneficiary - which meant complying with the statute while in Levada's view avoiding a privileged status for unmarried domestic partnerships.|$|E
25|$|With 51% FDI {{limit in}} multi-brand retailers, {{nearly half of}} any profits will remain in India. Any profits {{will be subject to}} taxes, and such taxes will reduce Indian {{government}} budget deficit. Many years ago, China adopted the retail reform policy India has announced; allowing FDI in its retail sector. FDI-financed retailers in China took between 5 and 10 years to post profits, {{in large part because of}} huge investments initially made. Like China, it is unlikely foreign retailers will earn any profits in India for the first 5 to 10 years. Ultimately, retail <b>companies</b> <b>must</b> earn profits by creating value.|$|E

25|$|England and Wales {{are treated}} as a single entity (companies may be ‘Registered in England and Wales’) with a unified register, {{separate}} from those of Scotland or Northern Ireland. <b>Companies</b> <b>must</b> advise Companies House of their intended registered office (the official address of the company), which may be in England and Wales, in Scotland, or in Wales. Consequently, on incorporation, companies will be either ‘Registered in England and Wales’, ‘Registered in Scotland’, or ‘Registered in Wales’. Effectively, companies in England must register in England and Wales, companies in Scotland must register in Scotland, while companies in Wales may choose to register in either England and Wales, or in Wales.|$|E
25|$|Companies House is the United Kingdom’s {{registrar}} {{of companies}} {{and is an}} executive agency and trading fund of Her Majesty's Government. It falls under the remit of the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) and {{is also a member}} of the Public Data Group. All forms of companies (as permitted by the United Kingdom Companies Act) are incorporated and registered with Companies House and file specific details as required by the current Companies Act 2006. All registered limited companies, including subsidiary, small and inactive <b>companies,</b> <b>must</b> file annual financial statements in addition to annual company returns, which are all public records. Only some registered unlimited companies (meeting certain conditions) are exempt from this requirement.|$|E
25|$|These {{policies}} also {{mandate that}} publicly listed <b>companies</b> <b>must</b> set aside 30% of equity for Bumiputras; discounts {{that must be}} provided for automobile and real estate purchases; a set amount of lots set aside for Bumiputras in housing projects; companies submitting bids for government projects be Bumiputra-owned and that Approved Permits (APs) for importing automobiles be preferentially given to Bumiputras. The equity in the publicly listed companies is disbursed by the Trade Ministry, and sold to selected Bumiputras at substantial discounts. However, the recipients frequently sell their stake in the companies immediately. The policies continued the Bumiputra advantage in higher education. In practice, however, most of these privileges went to Malays, and non-Malay Bumiputras, like the Orang Asli or aboriginal peoples, {{did not appear to}} have benefited much from Article 153 or policies such as the NEP.|$|E

25|$|On January 26, 2009, {{after more}} than a year of talks between the two companies, Pfizer agreed to buy {{pharmaceuticals}} rival Wyeth for a combined US$68billion in cash, shares and loans, including some US$22.5billion lent by five major Wall Street banks. The deal cemented Pfizer's position as the largest pharmaceutical company in the world, with the merged company generating over US$20billion in cash each year, and was the largest corporate merger since AT and BellSouth's US$70billion deal in March 2006. The combined company was expected to save US$4billion annually through streamlining; however, as part of the deal, both <b>companies</b> <b>must</b> repatriate billions of dollars in revenue from foreign sources to the United States, which will result in higher tax costs. The acquisition was completed on October 15, 2009, making Wyeth a wholly owned subsidiary of Pfizer.|$|E
500|$|Baird {{released}} his government's targets for {{greenhouse gas emissions}} in late April 2007. The plan calls for Canada to begin cutting its existing rate of greenhouse gas emissions by 2010 and for cuts to reach 20% by 2020. Under this plan, Canada will reach its Kyoto targets between 2020 and 2025, taking an additional eight to thirteen years longer than Kyoto. The government plan uses production intensity targets instead of hard caps. Baird said that the [...] "plan strikes {{a balance between the}} perfection some environmentalists may be seeking and the status quo that some in industry seek to protect." [...] In December 2007, Baird revealed in a plan that over 700 big-polluter companies, including oil and gas, pulp and paper, electricity and iron and steel <b>companies,</b> <b>must</b> cut greenhouse emissions by six percent between 2008 and 2010. The companies would also have to produce an annual report every May 31 that would include data regarding the level of greenhouses emissions produced each year.|$|E
