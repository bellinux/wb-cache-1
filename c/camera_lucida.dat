5|$|Mathematics has {{directly}} influenced {{art with}} conceptual {{tools such as}} linear perspective, the analysis of symmetry, and mathematical objects such as polyhedra and the Möbius strip. Magnus Wenninger creates colourful stellated polyhedra, originally as models for teaching. Mathematical concepts such as recursion and logical paradox {{can be seen in}} paintings by Rene Magritte and in engravings by M. C. Escher. Computer art often makes use of fractals including the Mandelbrot set, and sometimes explores other mathematical objects such as cellular automata. Controversially, the artist David Hockney has argued that artists from the Renaissance onwards made use of the <b>camera</b> <b>lucida</b> to draw precise representations of scenes; the architect Philip Steadman similarly argued that Vermeer used the camera obscura in his distinctively observed paintings.|$|E
5|$|Research {{work on the}} Book of the Dead {{has always}} posed {{technical}} difficulties thanks {{to the need to}} copy very long hieroglyphic texts. Initially, these were copied out by hand, with the assistance either of tracing paper or a <b>camera</b> <b>lucida.</b> In the mid-19th century, hieroglyphic fonts became available and made lithographic reproduction of manuscripts more feasible. In the present day, hieroglyphics can be rendered in desktop publishing software and this, combined with digital print technology, means that the costs of publishing a Book of the Dead may be considerably reduced. However, a very large amount of the source material in museums around the world remains unpublished.|$|E

25|$|In 2001, British artist David Hockney {{published}} the book Secret Knowledge: Rediscovering the Lost Techniques of the Old Masters, {{in which he}} argued that Vermeer (among other Renaissance and Baroque artists including Hans Holbein and Diego Velázquez) used optics to achieve precise positioning in their compositions, and specifically some combination of curved mirrors, camera obscura, and <b>camera</b> <b>lucida.</b> This {{became known as the}} Hockney–Falco thesis, named after Hockney and Charles M. Falco, another proponent of the theory.|$|E
25|$|After Raymond's few excursions, the Burgess Shale faded {{somewhat}} into obscurity. Walcott's third wife, Mary Vaux, discouraged {{access to}} the collections, which gathered dust on high shelves in the Smithsonian Institution. Harry Whittington, then of Harvard University, was to prove the catalyst that renewed interest in the site. As he showed a visiting trilobite expert around Raymond's collections, {{the necessity of a}} restudy was pointed out to Whittington, who proceeded to lobby the Geological Survey of Canada (GSC) to revisit the locality. They did, and as a leading authority on trilobites, Whittington was the logical choice to head the palaeontological investigations in the arthropod-rich Shale. In the company of Jim Aitken and Bill Fritz, he led a GSC reconnaissance expedition in 1966; fellow trilobitologist David Bruton joined the crew the next year as they went out to quarry in force. Dynamite was used in only the smallest quantities, with closely spaced drill holes used to separate large blocks of rock, and large slabs were collected systematically from the Walcott and Raymond quarries. These were labelled with their stratigraphic level, helicoptered from the mountain face, and returned to Whittington's base at the Sedgwick Museum in Cambridge for further study. The 1967 operation resulted in the description of new animals, including the earliest known crinoid and a complete Anomalocaris. Initially, detailed descriptions were made {{of some of the most}} common arthropod-like organisms: Marrella, Sidneyia and Burgessia. These redescriptions were slow and laborious, making extensive use of the <b>camera</b> <b>lucida</b> technique for microscope drawing, with papers based extensively around detailed drawing of the fossil specimens. It soon became clear that the Burgess Shale was even more exceptional than previously thought - soft tissue was preserved to an exquisite quality, allowing insights into early life that had never before been dreamed of, and preserving a range of non-mineralising taxa which are otherwise invisible in the fossil record. With an overwhelmingly diverse fauna in need of cataloguing, Harry Whittington set his two new graduate students to the task, assigning Derek Briggs and Simon Conway Morris the arthropods and 'worms', respectively. This work began to lift the veil on an unexpectedly diverse ecosystem, with almost as much variety as seen in the modern oceans - the old theory that Cambrian life was simple, straightforwards and slightly dull disintegrated further with each new fossil described. This view was reinforced with the identification of other Burgess Shale-type deposits elsewhere in the world, a search for which was triggered by the discovery of the Chengjiang and Sirius Passet lagerstätten in 1984.|$|E
500|$|The artist David Hockney {{argued in}} his book [...] that artists started using a <b>camera</b> <b>lucida</b> from the 1420s, {{resulting}} in a sudden change in precision and realism, and that this practice was continued by major artists including Ingres, Van Eyck, and Caravaggio. Critics disagree on whether Hockney was correct. Similarly, the architect Philip Steadman argued controversially that Vermeer had used a different device, the camera obscura, to help him create his distinctively observed paintings.|$|E
500|$|One of the {{earliest}} accounts of Maya stelae comes from Diego Garcia de Palacio, a Spanish colonial official who described six of the stelae at Copán {{in a letter to}} king Philip II of Spain written in 1576. Juan Galindo, governor of Petén, visited Copán in 1834 and noted the sculpted high-relief stelae there. Five years later, American diplomat John Lloyd Stephens and British artist Frederick Catherwood arrived in war-torn Central America and set out for Copán, describing fifteen stelae in Stephens' Incidents of Travel in Central America, Chiapas and Yucatán, published in 1841. Stephens and Catherwood noticed the presence of red pigment on some of the Copán stelae. Stephens unsuccessfully attempted to buy the ruins of Quiriguá, and purchased Copán for US$50 ($ in [...] ) with the idea of shipping the stelae to New York for display in a new museum. In the event, he was prevented from shipping the monuments down the Copán River by the discovery of impassable rapids and all the stelae remained at the site. While Stephens was engaged on business elsewhere, Catherwood carried out a brief investigation of the stelae at Quiriguá but found them very difficult to draw without a <b>camera</b> <b>lucida</b> due to their great height. Ambrosio Tut, governor of Petén, and colonel Modesto Méndez, the chief magistrate, visited the ruins of Tikal in 1848 accompanied by Eusebio Lara, who drew some of the monuments there. In 1852 Modesto Méndez went on to discover Stela 1 and Stela 5 at Ixkun. English explorer Alfred Maudslay arrived at Quiriguá in 1881 and cleared the vegetation from the stelae, then travelled on to see the stelae at Copán. In the early 20th century, an expedition by the Carnegie Institution led by American Mayanist Sylvanus Morley discovered a stela at Uaxactun. This period marked a change from the efforts of individual explorers to those of institutions that funded archaeological exploration, excavation and restoration.|$|E
2500|$|In 2008, American {{entrepreneur}} and inventor Tim Jenison {{developed the}} theory that Vermeer had used a camera obscura along with a [...] "comparator mirror", which is similar in concept to a <b>camera</b> <b>lucida</b> but much simpler and {{makes it easy to}} match color values. He later modified the theory to simply involve a concave mirror and a comparator mirror. He spent the next five years testing his theory by attempting to re-create The Music Lesson himself using these tools, a process captured in the 2013 documentary film Tim's Vermeer.|$|E

60|$|Descriptions {{are also}} given of various methods of {{enlarging}} a finger print to a convenient size, {{when it is}} desired to examine it closely. Photography is the readiest of all; {{on the other hand}} the prism (as in a <b>camera</b> <b>lucida)</b> has merits of its own, and so has an enlarging pantagraph, when it is furnished with a small microscope and cross wires to serve as a pointer.|$|E
60|$|A {{piece of}} the {{occipital}} bone, which Schmerling seems to have missed, has since been fitted on {{to the rest of}} the cranium by an accomplished anatomist, Dr. Spring, of Liege, under whose direction an excellent plaster cast was made for Sir Charles Lyell. It is upon and from a duplicate of that cast that my own observations and the accompanying figures, the outlines of which are copied from very accurate <b>Camera</b> <b>lucida</b> drawings, by my friend Mr. Busk, reduced to one-half of the natural size, are made.|$|E
60|$|I have made, by hand, many enlargements with a prism (<b>camera</b> <b>lucida),</b> {{but it is}} {{difficult}} to enlarge more than five times by means of it. So much shade is cast by the head that the prism can hardly be used at a less distance than 3 inches from the print, or one quarter the distance (12 inches) at which a book is usually read, while the paper on which the drawing is made cannot well be more than 15 inches below the prism; so it makes an enlargement of (4 × 15)/12 or five-fold. This is a very convenient method of analysing a pattern, since the lines follow only the axes of the ridges, as in Plate 3, Fig. 5. The prism and attached apparatus may be kept permanently mounted, ready for use at any time, without the trouble of any adjustment.|$|E
6000|$|II. In {{the second}} method the tracing-papers were discarded, and {{the prism of}} a <b>camera</b> <b>lucida</b> used. It threw an image {{three times the size}} of the photo-enlargement, upon a card, and there it was traced. The same general {{principle}} was adopted as in the first method, but the results being on a larger scale, and drawn on stout paper, were more satisfactory and convenient. They are given in the second column of the table. In this and the foregoing methods two different portions of the same print were sometimes dealt with, for it was a little more convenient and seemed as good a way of obtaining average results as that of always using portions of different finger prints. The total number of fifty-two trials, by one or other of the two methods, were made from about forty different prints. (I am not sure of the exact number.) ...|$|E
60|$|I {{may give}} one other case: so {{confidently}} did I {{expect to find}} gradations in important points of structure between the different castes of neuters in the same species, that I gladly availed myself of Mr. F. Smith's offer of numerous specimens from the same nest of the driver ant (Anomma) of West Africa. The reader will perhaps best appreciate the amount of difference in these workers, by my giving not the actual measurements, but a strictly accurate illustration: the difference {{was the same as}} if we were to see a set of workmen building a house of whom many were five feet four inches high, and many sixteen feet high; but we must suppose that the larger workmen had heads four instead of three times as big as those of the smaller men, and jaws nearly five times as big. The jaws, moreover, of the working ants of the several sizes differed wonderfully in shape, and in the form and number of the teeth. But the important fact for us is, that though the workers can be grouped into castes of different sizes, yet they graduate insensibly into each other, as does the widely-different structure of their jaws. I speak confidently on this latter point, as Mr. Lubbock made drawings for me with the <b>camera</b> <b>lucida</b> of the jaws which I had dissected from the workers of the several sizes.|$|E
60|$|We {{have heard}} so much of Monks; everywhere, in real and fictitious History, from Muratori Annals to Radcliffe Romances, these {{singular}} two-legged animals, with their rosaries and breviaries, with their shaven crowns, hair-cilities, and vows of poverty, masquerade so strangely through our fancy; {{and they are in}} fact so very strange an extinct species of the human family,--a veritable Monk of Bury St. Edmunds is worth attending to, if by chance made visible and audible. Here he is; and in his hand a magical speculum, much gone to rust indeed, yet in fragments still clear; wherein the marvellous image of his existence does still shadow itself, though fitfully, and as with an intermittent light! Will not the reader peep with us into this singular <b>camera</b> <b>lucida,</b> where an extinct species, though fitfully, can still be seen alive? Extinct species, we say; for the live specimens which still go about under that character are too evidently to be classed as spurious in Natural History: the Gospel of Richard Arkwright once promulgated, no Monk of the old sort is any longer possible in this world. But fancy a deep-buried Mastodon, some fossil Megatherion, Ichthyosaurus, were to begin to speak from amid its rock-swathings, never so indistinctly! The most extinct fossil species of Men or Monks can do, and does, this miracle,--thanks to the Letters of the Alphabet, good for so many things.|$|E

5000|$|As {{recently}} as a few decades ago, the <b>camera</b> <b>lucida</b> was still a standard tool of microscopists. It is still a key tool {{in the field of}} palaeontology. Until very recently, photomicrographs were expensive to reproduce. Furthermore, in many cases, a clear illustration of the structure that the microscopist wished to document was much easier to produce by drawing than by micrography. Thus, most routine histological and microanatomical illustrations in textbooks and research papers were <b>camera</b> <b>lucida</b> drawings rather than photomicrographs. The <b>camera</b> <b>lucida</b> is still used as the most common method among neurobiologists for drawing brain structures, although it is recognised to have limitations. [...] "For decades in cellular neuroscience, <b>camera</b> <b>lucida</b> hand drawings have constituted essential illustrations. (...) The limitations of <b>camera</b> <b>lucida</b> can be avoided by the procedure of digital reconstruction". Of particular concern is distortion, and new digital methods are being introduced which can limit or remove this, [...] "computerized techniques result in far fewer errors in data transcription and analysis than the <b>camera</b> <b>lucida</b> procedure". It is also regularly used in biological taxonomy.|$|E
5000|$|Published {{two months}} prior to his death in 1980, <b>Camera</b> <b>Lucida</b> is Barthes first and only book devoted to photography. By now his tactics in writing, always {{shifting}} and complex, favouring the dialectical to the morally or politically committed (Sartre), had once again changed. If sentimentality {{can be seen as}} a tactic in the late career of Roland Barthes, then <b>Camera</b> <b>Lucida</b> belongs to such an approach. It is novelistic, in line with the developments towards this new type of writing which Barthes had shown with A Lovers Discourse and Roland Barthes by Roland Barthes. However, the ideas about photography in <b>Camera</b> <b>Lucida</b> are certainly prepared in essays like [...] "The Photographic Message", [...] "Rhetoric of the Image" [...] (1964), and [...] "The Third Meaning" [...] (1971). There is a movement through these three pieces of which <b>Camera</b> <b>Lucida</b> can be seen as the culmination. With [...] "The Third Meaning" [...] there is the suggestion that the photographs reality, aside from all the messages it can be loaded with, might constitute an avant-garde value: not a message as such, aimed at the viewer/reader, but another kind of meaning that arises almost accidentally yet without being simply the material or the accidental; this is the eponymous third meaning. This essay of 1970, ostensibly about some Eisenstein stills, anticipates many of Camera Lucidas ideas and connects them back to still earlier ones. One could almost swap the term third meaning for the punctum of <b>Camera</b> <b>Lucida.</b> Yet the personal note of pain in <b>Camera</b> <b>Lucida</b> is not present in these earlier writings and is unmistakable. Written after his mothers death, <b>Camera</b> <b>Lucida</b> is as much a reflection on death as it is on photography. Barthes died in an automobile accident soon after the publication of <b>Camera</b> <b>Lucida,</b> and many have read the book as Barthes eulogy for himself.|$|E
