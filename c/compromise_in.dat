Consistent with {{his support of}} Clay, he promoted expansion of internal improvements, including the Maysville Road bill vetoed by Jackson.

5|$|Before he died, López Salcedo {{appointed}} contador Andrés de Cerezeda as his successor. Cerezada {{was unable}} to impose his authority over the residents of Trujillo, with two rival claimants struggling for power. Vasco de Herrera {{was supported by the}} town council, and was strong enough to force Cerezeda to agree to a power-sharing <b>compromise.</b> <b>In</b> reality, it was Vasco de Herrera who wielded true authority over the province.|$|E

Many of the moderates who had helped deliver the peaceful <b>compromise</b> <b>in</b> 1318 now began to turn against Edward, making violence ever more likely.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Oslo Sporveier {{announced}} that it would close the Ekeberg, Sinsen, Briskeby and Kjelsås Lines to reduce costs. Only the Kjelsås Line was actually closed and replaced by buses, which occurred 21 November 2002. After local protests, and a <b>compromise</b> <b>in</b> the city council, the Kjelsås Line was reopened on 22 November 2004.|$|E
5|$|Liver {{dysfunction}} as {{a result}} of malaria is uncommon and usually only occurs in those with another liver condition such as viral hepatitis or chronic liver disease. The syndrome is sometimes called malarial hepatitis. While it has been considered a rare occurrence, malarial hepatopathy has seen an increase, particularly in Southeast Asia and India. Liver <b>compromise</b> <b>in</b> people with malaria correlates with a greater likelihood of complications and death.|$|E

5|$|As bishop, Burnell had a wall {{built around}} the cathedral at Wells, which helped to improve the {{security}} of the cathedral and its outlying buildings. He left the court each year at Lent, when he returned to his diocese and attended to its affairs. Peckham appointed Burnell to be his deputy when the archbishop went to Wales in 1282. It was probably Burnell who suggested a <b>compromise</b> <b>in</b> 1285 over the jurisdictions of the royal and ecclesiastical courts, which allowed royal officials to return cases involving only religious matters to the church courts.|$|E
5|$|General {{anesthesia}} {{is often}} administered without tracheal intubation in selected {{cases where the}} procedure is brief in duration, or procedures where the depth of anesthesia {{is not sufficient to}} cause significant <b>compromise</b> <b>in</b> ventilatory function. Even for longer duration or more invasive procedures, a general anesthetic may be administered without intubating the trachea, provided that patients are carefully selected, and the risk-benefit ratio is favorable (i.e., the risks associated with an unprotected airway are believed to be less than the risks of intubating the trachea).|$|E
5|$|Like {{most members}} of Congress during the Era of Good Feelings, Senator Edwards sat {{as a member of}} the Democratic-Republican Party. As his second term drew on, he joined the Adams-Clay faction that would develop into the National Republicans after Edwards left office. Edwards voted for the Missouri <b>Compromise</b> <b>in</b> 1820, a bill that Thomas sponsored. He voted against a law {{reducing}} prices for federal land, which made both Edwards and Representative Daniel Pope Cook targets of criticism at home. On May 6, 1821, Cook married Edwards' daughter Julia.|$|E

5|$|On {{his return}} from France, Edward found his {{political}} position greatly strengthened. After intense negotiation, the earls, including Lancaster and Warwick, came to a <b>compromise</b> <b>in</b> October 1313, fundamentally {{very similar to the}} draft agreement of the previous December. Edward's finances improved, thanks to parliament agreeing to the raising of taxes, a loan of 160,000 florins (£25,000) from the Pope, £33,000 that he borrowed from Philip, and further loans organised by Edward's new Italian banker, Antonio Pessagno. For {{the first time in his}} reign, Edward's government was well-funded.|$|E
5|$|Section116 of the Constitution of Australia precludes the Commonwealth of Australia (i.e., {{the federal}} parliament) from making laws for {{establishing}} any religion, imposing any religious observance, or prohibiting {{the free exercise}} of any religion. Section116 also provides that no religious test shall be required as a qualification for any office or public trust under the Commonwealth. The product of a <b>compromise</b> <b>in</b> the pre-Federation constitutional conventions, Section116 is based on similar provisions in the United States Constitution. However, Section116 is more narrowly drafted than its US counterpart, and does not preclude the states of Australia from making such laws.|$|E
5|$|The {{next few}} months were spent on {{political}} maneuvering. The increasingly insecure communists, who still had military and administrative control over the country, were appeased by a <b>compromise</b> <b>in</b> which Solidarity allowed General Jaruzelski to remain head of state. Jaruzelski barely won {{the vote in the}} National Assembly presidential election of 19 July 1989, even though his name was the only one on the ballot. He won through an informally arranged abstention by a sufficient number of Solidarity MPs and his position was not strong. Jaruzelski resigned as first secretary of the PZPR on 29 July.|$|E

5|$|The vimana {{of their}} temples (tower over the shrine) is a <b>compromise</b> <b>in</b> detail between the plain stepped {{style of the}} early Chalukyas and the {{decorative}} finish of the Hoysalas. To the credit of the Western Chalukya architects {{is the development of}} the lathe turned (tuned) pillars and use of Soapstone (Chloritic Schist) as basic building and sculptural material, a very popular idiom in later Hoysala temples. They popularised the use of decorative Kirtimukha (demon faces) in their sculptures. Famous architects in the Hoysala kingdom included Chalukyan architects who were natives of places such as Balligavi. The artistic wall decor and the general sculptural idiom was dravidian architecture. This style is sometimes called Karnata dravida, one of the notable traditions in Indian architecture.|$|E
5|$|Theobald {{also had}} a dispute with St Augustine's Abbey over {{the right of the}} {{archbishop}} to receive annual payments, and whether those payments were for sacraments performed by the archbishop, which would have been uncanonical, or were for other reasons. The dispute was eventually settled by a <b>compromise</b> <b>in</b> which St Augustine's continued to make the payments but they were specifically stated not to be for sacraments. Another dispute with St Augustine's concerned the right of the archbishops to have a say in the election of new abbots and whether or not the abbots would make a profession of obedience to the archbishops. This was eventually settled by a papal mandate of 1144 instructing the abbots to profess obedience.|$|E
5|$|Accounts differ as to {{the cause}} of death; one version stated that he died by poison only and another view claimed he died by a self-inflicted gunshot while biting down on a cyanide capsule. Contemporary historians have {{rejected}} these accounts as being either Soviet propaganda or an attempted <b>compromise</b> <b>in</b> order to reconcile the different conclusions. One eyewitness stated that Hitler's corpse showed signs of having been shot through the mouth, but this has been proven unlikely. There is also controversy regarding the authenticity of skull and jaw fragments that were recovered. In 2009, American researchers performed DNA tests on a skull that Soviet officials had long believed to be that of Hitler. The tests and examination revealed that the skull was actually that of a woman less than 40 years old. The recovered jaw fragments were not tested.|$|E

5|$|Finally, General Conway {{proposed}} {{what was}} a workable <b>compromise</b> <b>in</b> his opinion: the Fallujah Brigade. Led by former Iraqi Sunni Ba'athists, such as Jasim Mohammed Saleh and Muhammed Latif, and made up largely of insurgents who had been fighting the Marines, the brigade was supposed to maintain order in the city while allowing the US to withdraw and save face. On 10 May, General Mattis formally turned the city over and withdrew the following day. The First Battle for Fallujah had resulted in 51 US servicemen killed and 476 wounded. Iraqi losses were much higher. The Marines estimated that about 800 Iraqis were killed. Reports differed on how many were civilians: the Marines counted 300, whereas the independent organization Iraq Body Count argued that 600 civilians had been killed.|$|E
5|$|France {{formally}} relinquished {{its claim}} to its region of Texas in 1762, when French Louisiana was ceded to the Spanish Empire. The inclusion of Spanish Louisiana into New Spain meant that Texas was no longer essentially a buffer province. The easternmost Texas settlements were disbanded, with the population relocating to San Antonio. However, in 1799 Spain gave Louisiana back to France, and in 1803 Napoléon Bonaparte (and France) sold the territory, known as the Louisiana Purchase, to the United States. U.S. President Thomas Jefferson insisted that the purchase included all land {{to the east of}} the Rocky Mountains and {{to the north of the}} Rio Grande, although its large southwestern expanse was within New Spain. The dispute was not resolved until the Adams–Onís Treaty <b>compromise</b> <b>in</b> 1819, when Spain ceded Spanish Florida to the United States in return for recognition of the Sabine River as the eastern boundary of Spanish Texas and western boundary of the Missouri Territory. The U.S. claims on the vast Spanish territories west of the Sabine River into Santa Fe de Nuevo México province (New Mexico).|$|E
5|$|From the outset, Chamarro {{performed}} a delicate balancing act. Her choice {{to lead the}} Assembly, , {{was rejected by the}} UNO vote, which chose Myriam Arguello and Chamorro kept her word not to go against the vote. Her Vice President-elect Virgilio Godoy was in favor of hard-line policies to exclude the Sandinistas, but Chamorro retained Daniel Ortega's brother, Humberto Ortega, as a military leader, granting herself the position of Defense Minister and naming Humberto to second-in-command as the Chief of Staff. For this, Chamorro's critics accused her of supporting the Sandinistas, but it proved to be a valuable political move, as it demonstrated that, {{for the good of the}} nation, she was willing to <b>compromise</b> <b>in</b> ways that fostered reconciliation. She also appointed three FSLN cabinet members, including one for agrarian reform.|$|E
