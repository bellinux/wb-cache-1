Military Affairs Committees were coordinating groups that liaisoned and coordinated activity with the Central Reunification Department, another <b>coordination</b> <b>body</b> for the complex effort. Each front was a military command but was supervised also by regional Party committees set up by Hanoi's Politburo. The deeper PAVN formations moved into South Vietnam, the more coordination was needed with NLF/VC and regional forces. Hence COVSN was prominent in the southernmost areas, closest to the Cambodian border, where it had its headquarters. COVSN supervised VC forces (Main Force, Regional and Village Guerrilla) in this zone.|$|E

By the end of 1877 the issue of defense of territorial integrity became very difficult. On 13 December 1877, Serbians declared war on Ottoman Empire, so the Montenegro did. They were supported by Russian Army and spread their attacks on the northern parts of Albania. Albanians were unable to defend several regions and cities {{in the northeast and}} northwest of Albania. Upon occupation of these lands, the Ottoman administrators (of mainly Albanian origin) fled the freed territories and/or were expelled. These events influenced the Local Councils for the National Salvation to merge in a single <b>coordination</b> <b>body.</b> Albanians, on December 12, 1877 established in Istanbul the Central Committee for the Defense of Rights of the Albanian Nation.|$|E
40|$|<b>Coordination</b> <b>bodies</b> {{that attempt}} to {{overcome}} coordination barriers in humanitarian relief face many challenges. Among them are general organizational barriers to coordination as well as functionally-oriented barriers arising specifically from information management (IM) and information technology (IT) issues. Based on data collected from three <b>coordination</b> <b>bodies,</b> the research presented here examines IM and IT-related barriers, identifying {{similarities and differences between}} them as well as requirements for resolving them. The research finds that while many similarities exist, resolving IM issues typically requires higher levels of organizational change as compared to IT-related barriers. The research concludes that <b>coordination</b> <b>bodies</b> need to address a mixture of IT and IM related issues both to foster better coordination but also to ensure their efforts are successful...|$|R

Widely regarded as a rising political star, Zhou was said to be a leading candidate for Vice-Premier or entry into the top ranks of the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission (Zhengfawei). The central government was also in need of a tough and uncompromising figure to take reins of China's security system in the post-9/11 global security paradigm. With his quasi-military style training in the oil sector and a reputation for being able to make tough decisions, Zhou got the nod to become Minister of Public Security in December 2002. He also earned a series of powerful posts in the party and government within the span of a few months, including membership in the Politburo, State Councilor, Deputy Zhengfawei Secretary, First Political Commissar of the People's Armed Police (China's paramilitary police force), and Secretary of the party's Central Secretariat (the party's internal policy execution and <b>coordination</b> <b>body).</b>|$|E

Industrial Symbiosis: Early {{experiences}} from a national programme in the UK. ” in a forthcoming issue of Journal of Cleaner Production. Please do not quote without {{the permission of the}} Authors. This article reviews the efforts of developing industrial symbiosis (IS) networks in Humber and Mersey Estuaries and in West Midlands in the UK, where the authors have, to varying degrees, been part of the efforts for identifying and establishing inter-organizational synergistic linkages with environmental and economic gains since Summer 2000. Following a generic review of technical, political, economic, informational, and organisational factors that can have major influences on the development and functioning of IS networks and the role of <b>coordination</b> <b>bodies</b> aiming to catalyse the system developments, major political and institutional elements relevant to IS developments and applicable to all three regions are outlined. Experiences from individual IS programmes are then shared and analysed in light of technical, informational and organisational factors and the attributes of <b>coordination</b> <b>bodies.</b> Such analyses indicate the dominating importance of the organizational factors such as the history of industrial development, intensity of social interactions among relevant parties, and their mental proximity. Experiences also reveal that the perception of regional parties about the coordinating bodies is influential on the effectiveness of development efforts. A set of recommendations drawn from the analysis is intended to inform further similar efforts under National Industrial Symbiosis Programme (NISP). The paper concludes by highlighting the need of aligning the functioning of emerging networks with the requirements of longer term sustainability, which imposes higher challenges on <b>coordination</b> <b>bodies.</b> 1...|$|R
