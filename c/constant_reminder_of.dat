Jonah Jameson as he no longer has control over the newspaper. He also torments Ben Urich and demands a retraction over Urich's exposé of his time as the Green Goblin, providing faked evidence that he never was the supervillain, despite Urich's extensive research.

The paintings are set on a pedestal that represents the realm of the King of Nagas amidst Dakinis (mKha-hgro-ma), and the pinnacle in the painting denotes the domain of Brahma. The paintings also depict Klu (Naga) demigods with a human head and the body of a serpent, which are said to reside in lakes (said to denote that they are guarding the hidden treasures). Allegorically, they mean to represent the spiritual holy writings. The paintings also show what is termed as “Walkers in the Sky” (mKha-hgro-ma).|$|E

25|$|In {{a special}} queer issue of The Stranger in 1999, openly gay author, pundit, and {{journalist}} Dan Savage questioned {{the relevance of}} pride thirty years later, writing that pride was an effective antidote to shame imposed on LGBT people, but that pride is now making LGBT people dull and slow as a group, {{as well as being}} a <b>constant</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> shame. However, he also states that pride in some simpler forms are still useful to individuals struggling with shame. Savage writes that gay pride can also lead to disillusionment where an LGBT individual realises the reality that sexual orientation doesn't say much about a person's personality, after being led by the illusion that LGBT individuals are part of a co-supportive and inherently good group of people.|$|E
25|$|Some manga are {{completely}} drawn in the bishonen style, such as Saint Seiya. Bishōnen manga are generally shōjo manga (girls' comics) or yaoi (girls' comics focused on homosexual relationships between beautiful boys), however shōnen manga (boy's comics) may use casts of bishōnen characters for crossover appeal to female readers. Mainstream shounen and seinen fare also often uses such characters as rivals for a traditional masculine protagonist, {{with some degree}} of comic relief, or for the blander everyman, whether as the embodiment of his insecurities in a grittier realism, or as a more lighthearted <b>constant</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> his less than advantageous social status and the constraints thereof. Comics for younger boys tend to use arrogant bishounen {{in the role of the}} recurring minor rivals readers love to hate, though their effeminate good looks there will often appear older, bigger, stronger, and thus in fact more masculine than the commonly shorter and less mature protagonists.|$|E

He is then confronted by Belle, who now knows he was willing to kill Rumple and believed he still had feelings for her, only to learn that the book was punishment and a <b>constant</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> why he died. He was also shocked to discover Belle is now Gold's wife, and leaves furious. Belle tells Gold and made him promise not to hurt Gaston, but when she tells Gold about what Hades told her he just couldn't accept what Belle wanted. At the docks, Gold uses magic to choke Gaston by the throat, ready to send him to the River of Lost Souls, when Belle pulls the dagger and commands him not to hurt Gaston, and he drops Gaston on the ground. However, Gaston is unable to let his vendetta against Gold go, and when he goes for his arrow, Belle accidentally knockes Gaston out into the River of Lost Souls. Unfortunately, Belle discovers that because she saved Gold but interfered, Hades arrives to tell the couple that the contract allowing him to take their baby was still in effect, as Belle was the one who knocked Gaston into the Acheron, not Gold. He then looks at a withering daisy flower that he picks up, as a sign of hope fading away. The burned flower later shows up at Granny's Diner, as a gift to Zelena from Hades.|$|E

After he signed the bill into law, Carter issued a statement, saying in part that he was confident that [...] "this act—and the new dollar—will substantially improve our coinage system as well as cutting Government coin production costs." [...] He went on to declare his approval of the decision to depict Anthony on the coins:I am particularly pleased that the new dollar coin will—for the first time in history—bear the image of a great American woman. The life of Susan B. Anthony exemplifies the ideals for which our country stands. The 'Anthony dollar' will symbolize for all American women the achievement of their unalienable right to vote. It will be a <b>constant</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> the continuing struggle for the equality of all Americans.|$|E
500|$|As of 2009, the {{congregation}} had approximately five thousand {{two hundred and}} nine parishioners. Mount Saint Peter Church serves {{as a symbol of}} faith and what can be accomplished when people work together for a common belief, hope, and dream. The church's new motto, adopted in 2004, reflected this balance: [...] "to restore all things in Christ...with the fire of love." [...] This motto serves as a <b>constant</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> the history of the parish. The beauty of the Mellon Mansion was restored by {{the congregation}} and turned into a House of God. This was done through a strong love of Christ, faith, and neighbor. The names of the volunteers who helped build the church are carved in the marble inside the main entrance of the church and serve as a token of the congregation's appreciation. Many of today's parishioners are descendants of those volunteers and are proud {{to tell the story of}} their forefathers who gave them this church in which to practice their faith.|$|E

[...] Andrew Sun of South China Morning Post noted the video quality and the predictable structure are <b>constant</b> <b>reminders</b> <b>of</b> that it is a television project.

500|$|The {{presentation}} of Empire City was also {{considered to be}} a significant factor {{of the success of the}} game. The climbing and grabbing aspect was considered well done and avoided a [...] "frustration-fest" [...] that other games with precision jumping generally bring about, according to Miller. However, some reviewers noted that Cole's climbing ability was too touchy, with the character grabbing onto ledges too greedily, making it difficult to fine-tune jumps. In combination with Cole's other powers, Miller cited the game as having the [...] "most original city-traversal mechanics" [...] for an open-world game. The behavior of the city's population and how that was affected by the player's choice in Karma was also seen as a positive, and as a <b>constant</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> the game's setting. The game's story, particularly in the second half of the game, was considered to be strong, enhanced by {{presentation of}} the cut-scenes. However, the quality of these scenes was seen to negatively highlight the poor animation used for in-game generated cut-scenes and the quality of the voice work; Miller considered Cole's voice to be too gravelly for the character.|$|E
500|$|In A Game of Thrones, Jon Snow is {{introduced}} as the 14-year-old bastard son of Eddard [...] "Ned" [...] Stark, Lord of Winterfell, and half-brother to Robb, Sansa, Arya, Bran and Rickon. Jon {{is described as}} having strong Stark features with a lean build, long face, dark brown hair and grey eyes. Jon has the surname [...] "Snow" [...] (customarily used for illegitimate children in the North) and is resented by Ned's wife Catelyn, who views him as a <b>constant</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> Ned's infidelity. Jon is {{the same age as}} Robb and enjoys a warm relationship with his siblings, particularly the tomboy Arya (who resembles Jon and like him does not feel like she fits in). Ned treats Jon as much like his other children as propriety and his honor will allow. Still, as somewhat of an outsider, Jon has learned to be independent and to fend for himself when necessary. Jon idolizes his father, but is wounded by Ned's refusal to tell him about his mother. At the beginning of the story, Jon adopts the albino direwolf that he names Ghost. He later finds that at times he can [...] "inhabit" [...] the wolf and share its experiences.|$|E
500|$|The Bridge on the Drina remains Andrić's {{most famous}} novel and has {{received}} the most scholarly analysis of all his works. Most scholars interpret the eponymous bridge as a metonym for Yugoslavia, which was itself a bridge between East and West during the Cold War, [...] "partaking of both but being neither". However, {{at the time of}} writing, the country did not enjoy the reputation of an inter-civilizational mediator, which was fostered by Tito only after his split with Stalin in 1948. Thus, the novel can be seen as having contributed to the formation of this national self-image. Andrić suggests that the building of roads and bridges by Great Powers is rarely done as a gesture of friendship towards local populations, but rather as a means of facilitating imperialist conquest. Thus, the bridge is both a symbol of unification and division. It is a symbol of unification in that it allows the inhabitants of Višegrad to cross from one bank to the other and in that the kapija serves as a popular meeting place. On the other hand, it divides the town's inhabitants by acting as a <b>constant</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> the Ottoman conquest.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the heavy}} tone, humor is prominent. [...] The work is {{conscious}} {{of its own}} creation—Green's drawing of it frames the narrative proper and there are <b>constant</b> <b>reminders</b> <b>of</b> it throughout. [...] Green patterned the opening after those featuring the Crypt-Keeper in EC Comics' Tales from the Crypt series from the 1950s. [...] Green used the adult Binky as the narrator of the captions and {{as a way to}} tie together the past and present timeframes. There is a disconnect in that the narrator refers to his younger self as [...] "he". [...] Other references to comics include a Sinstopper's Guidebook, which alludes to Dick Tracy's Crimestopper's Textbook and a cartoon by Robert Crumb in the background.|$|R
5000|$|Technological multi-tasking and absorbency- With a rapid {{increase}} in technologically-driven communication {{in the past several}} decades, individuals are increasingly faced with condensed communication in the form of e-mail, text, and social updates. This has, in turn, led to a notable change in the way younger generations communicate and perceive their own self-efficacy to communicate and connect with others. With the ever-constant presence of another [...] "world" [...] in one's pocket, individuals are multi-tasking both physically and cognitively as <b>constant</b> <b>reminders</b> <b>of</b> something else happening somewhere else bombard them.

Kelly recalled the events by saying: [...] "We were all friends and often rode the train together {{to get to the}} studio". RedOne began working with Akon, who had signed Chynn to his record label. Akon and RedOne flew Gaga and Kelly to Los Angeles to write songs for Chynn's second studio album Prima Donna. [...] "Hypnotico" [...] became the first of several songs they had written together. From that trip, according to Kelly, [...] "Akon met, signed and helped launch Lady Gaga's career". Kelly credits the trip as also helping to launch his own songwriting career.

From that CD of tracks he wrote songs for Leona Lewis ("Forgive Me"), Whitney Houston ("Like I Never Left", [...] "I Got You") and Michael Jackson ("Hold My Hand"). According to Kelly, [...] "Hypnotico" [...] is a [...] "symbol of how dreams come true if you work hard, and a <b>constant</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> how far I've come.
