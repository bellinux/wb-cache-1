40|$|Graduation date: 2007 Diffusion bonding {{has been}} widely used within microlamination {{architectures}} for the fabrication of Micro Energy and Chemical Systems (MECS). MECS are microsystems {{with the ability to}} process bulk amounts of fluid within highly-parallel microchannel arrays capable of accelerated heat and mass transfer. Thus far, diffusion bonding of microchannel arrays is commonly done in a vacuum hot press system. The use of the hot press greatly restricts the production rate due to vacuum pump-down time and heating-up and cooling-down periods. Furthermore, larger substrates are gaining interest in the system design of MECS devices and it is not apparent that uniaxial pressing within a hydraulic vacuum hot press will provide the bonding pressure uniformity necessary for large substrate bonding. This thesis presents a novel fabrication approach for the high-volume thermal bonding of large substrate MECS devices with the use of controlled thermal expansion. A large substrate thermal bonding <b>clamp</b> <b>based</b> on the principle of differential thermal expansion was developed with focus on controlling the bonding pressure magnitude, timing, sensitivity and uniformity...|$|R
40|$|This study {{concerns}} the axisymmetric buckling of radially loaded circular Mindlin plates with internal concentric ring supports. The {{edge of the}} plate is either simply supported or <b>clamped.</b> <b>Based</b> on the Rayleigh-Ritz energy approach, buckling factors are determined and tabulated for plates of various thickness to radius ratios and with either one or two internal concentric rigid ring supports at various radii. The {{results show that the}} buckling factors for circular plates with one concentric ring support decrease with increasing thickness-radius ratios due to the increasing shear deformation effect. The effect of shear deformation on the buckling factors for plates with two ring supports is more pronounced than for plates with one ring support. The buckling factors for simply supported circular plates approach those for clamped circular plates when one of the ring supports is located sufficiently close to the edge. The tabulated buckling results should be valuable to designers for some industrial applications. Moreover, accurate and simple buckling formulas are presented for plates without any internal ring support...|$|R

Using calcium imaging and patch <b>clamp</b> <b>based</b> approaches, they showed a response in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons that exposure to cold, 20 °C or cooler, lead to a response in calcium influx. This receptor was shown to respond to both cold temperatures, menthol, and similar now-known agonists of the TRPM8 receptor. It works in conjunction with the TRPV1 receptor to maintain a feasible threshold temperature range in which our cells are comfortable and our perception of these stimuli occurs at the spinal cord and brain, which integrate signals from different fibers of varying sensitivity to temperature. Application of menthol to skin or mucus membranes results directly in membrane depolarization, followed by calcium influx via voltage-dependent calcium channels, providing evidence for the role of TRPM8 and other TRP receptors to mediate our sensory interaction with the environment in response to cold {{in the same way as}} in response to menthol.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{approach}} to control uncertainties in a simple column structure critical to buckling by actively stabilising the column. The buckling behaviour of a slender column, built in vertically at the base and pinned at the upper end is examined with and without additional active stabilisation. When the column is loaded by an axial compressive force equal to its individual critical buckling load, a critically stable equilibrium state occurs. When loaded above its critical buckling load, the passive column may buckle due to imperfections or lateral disturbance forces. The active stabilisation concept {{is based on the}} idea to force the column into its second bending de ection mode which enables the column, theoretically, to carry a load three times higher than the critical buckling load of a straight column with the same constraints. For that, actively controlled forces which are acting close to the column's <b>clamped</b> <b>base</b> increase the column's strength against buckling in real-time. It can be shown that the column can be stabilised in two directions in one plane with a combined feedforward and feedback control, even when the axial compressive force exceeds the original critical buckling load...|$|R

40|$|Buckling is an {{important}} design constraint in light-weight structures as it may result {{in the collapse of}} an entire structure. When a mechanical beam column is loaded above its critical buckling load, it may buckle. In addition, if the actual loading is not fully known, stability becomes highly uncertain. To control uncertainty in buckling, an approach is presented to actively stabilise a slender flat column sensitive to buckling. For this purpose, actively controlled forces applied by piezoelectric actuators located close to the column's <b>clamped</b> <b>base</b> stabilise the column against buckling at critical loading. In order to design a controller to stabilise the column, a mathematical model of the postcritically loaded system is needed. Simulating postbuckling behaviour is important to study the effect of axial loads above the critical axial buckling load within active buckling control. Within this postbuckling model, different kinds of uncertainty may occur: i) error in est imation of model parameters such as mass, damping and stiffness, ii) non-linearities e. g. in the assumption of curvature of the column's deflection shapes and many more. In this paper, numerical simulations based on the mathematical model for the postcritically axially loaded column are compared to a mathematical model based on experiments of the actively stabilised postcritically loaded real column system using closed loop identification. The motivation to develop an experimentally validated mathematical model is to develop of a model based stabilising control algorithm for a real postcritically axially loaded beam column...|$|R
40|$|In {{developing}} micro-spindle units, {{a critical}} problem is miniaturization {{of the tool}} clamp. Approaches for scaling down conventional tool clamps, such as the collet-chuck, hydraulic chuck, and shrink-fit methods may be limited by their inherently complicated mechanisms. This study developed a novel tool <b>clamp</b> <b>based</b> on shape memory alloy (SMA), which allows further miniaturization. The tool clamp can be simplified by using an SMA ring, which {{is all that is}} needed for clamping. The SMA-based tool clamp does not require any collet, and its structural configuration is axisymmetric. Furthermore, the SMA makes it possible to switch between the clamped and unclamped states by using a simple device to regulate small changes in temperature. This paper first describes the operating principle of the SMA-based tool clamp. Second, it presents the finite element method (FEM) analyses that were conducted to investigate the characteristics of the clamping/unclamping operations and the effect of centrifugal force.
