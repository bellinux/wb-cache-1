25|$|The Supreme Court has {{developed}} a four-part analysis to evaluate the constitutionality of time, place and manner (TPM) restrictions.

25|$|The {{number of}} {{one-on-one}} <b>channels</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> grows {{more rapidly than}} the number of workers, thus increasing the time and costs of communication. At some point one-on-one communications between all workers becomes impractical; therefore only certain groups of employees will communicate with one another (e.g. within departments or within geographical locations). This reduces, but does not stop, the increase in unit costs; and also the organisation will incur some inefficiencies due to the reduced level of communication.|$|E

The 1926 Imperial Conference in London recognised the de facto independence of the Dominions, and ended the role of the Governors-General as diplomats and as <b>channels</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> between governments.

After Agos started its publication, the participation of Armenians in the political-cultural life in Turkey increased greatly, and public awareness in Turkey of {{the issues of the}} Armenians started to increase.

25|$|Rav Kook {{tried to}} build and {{maintain}} <b>channels</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> and political alliances between the various Jewish sectors, including the secular Jewish Zionist leadership, the Religious Zionists, and more traditional non-Zionist Orthodox Jews. He believed that the modern movement to re-establish a Jewish state {{in the land of}} Israel had profound theological significance and that the Zionists were agents in a heavenly plan to bring about the messianic era. Per this ideology, the youthful, secular and even anti-religious Labor Zionist pioneers, halutzim, were a part of a grand Divine process whereby the land and people of Israel were finally being redeemed from the 2,000-year exile (galut) by all manner of Jews who sacrificed themselves for the cause of building up the physical land, as laying the groundwork for the ultimate spiritual messianic redemption of world Jewry.|$|E

25|$|The Bhopal medical {{community}} {{was faced with}} 1) the urgent health care needs of the affected community, 2) the non-availability of toxicological and accident-related information, 3) the extreme sensitivity of local and national government bodies toward {{all aspects of the}} disaster, 4) lack of expertise, and 5) the lack of funds available to independent researchers to conduct investigations. Faced with lawsuits and the prospect of bankruptcy, Union Carbideâ€™s efforts to keep open <b>channels</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> were highly inadequate to address these issues and were {{considered by many to be}} a major human rights violation. In addition, the transnational political and legal ramifications served to throw a veil of secrecy around the disaster, thus impeding the discovery of essential pieces of information. Medical, toxicological, and accident-analysis data were not made public, thereby frustrating the efforts of the {{medical community}} to understand the linkage between exposures and health effects and devise appropriate treatment strategies. As an example, the lack of information about whether MIC could thermally decompose to hydrocyanic acid led to years of contentious debate on the merits of treating the gas victims for cyanide poisoning and an unfortunate violation of patient confidentiality.|$|E

[...] She argues that images from afar have taken over much of our everyday reality like an immensely powerful occupation force.

With Baillet-Latour in German-occupied Belgium, Brundage and IOC vice president EdstrÃ¶m {{did their best}} to keep <b>channels</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> open between IOC members; according to Guttmann, [...] "He and EdstrÃ¶m perceived themselves as keepers of the sacred flame, guardians of an ideal in whose name they were ready once again to act as soon as the madness ended." [...] Baillet-Latour died in 1942; EdstrÃ¶m took on the duties of president, although he continued to style himself vice-president. EdstrÃ¶m and Brundage did not await the end of war to rebuild the Olympic movement; Brundage even sent parcels to Europe in aid of IOC members and others in places where food was scarce. With EdstrÃ¶m turning 74 in 1944, the Swede expressed concern as to who would lead the IOC if he should die, and suggested that Brundage become second vice-president, a newly created position. A mail ballot of IOC members who could be reached confirmed the choice the following year. When EdstrÃ¶m was made president by the first postwar IOC session at Lausanne in September 1946, Brundage was elected first vice-president.|$|E
