[...] Allmusic's David Jeffries called album closer [...] "Oldie" [...] epic in nature, stating that Earl Sweatshirt's return was the highlight of the album, summarizing the album as [...] "hype warranted." [...] Beats Per Minute's Craig Jenkin compared the album extensively to prior Odd Future releases, reporting that [...] "it ditches the expansive ooze that made stretches of Tyler’s Goblin a chore, the nihilistic agitprop of MellowHype’s BlackenedWhite, and the lackadaisical drugginess of Mike G’s Ali and Domo’s Rolling Papers in favor of the kind of restless, jerky energy that skyrocketed Bastard into the dialogue months prior." [...] He described the album as something that [...] "mainly sounds like a bunch of dudes in a dank basement <b>cooking</b> <b>up</b> the wildest smack talk possible, with one-upping each other being the primary objective." ...|$|E

[...] Paste ranked it number 34 on their list of the 50 best albums of 2013 saying, [...] "each bar has the ferociousness of a lion smelling the scent of fresh blood.

The production is minimalistic and intelligently doesn't overshadow Pusha's performance. The beats are big and full of bass, giving life to the album and forming a unique theme, with a reunion with Pharrell triggering a nice blast of nostalgia..... My Name Is My Name has substance, style, and passion, and no doubt is an album that will still be appreciated a decade from now.

2500|$|A {{different}} gender-related {{variation in}} folklore transmission {{is seen in}} storytelling.

For an event occurring during the apple harvest, a woman’s narration might include details of the apple butter recipe they were <b>cooking</b> <b>up</b> at the time. In contrast, the man's narration gives only enough detail to [...] "make a point worth telling". This gender-based variance has been studied by both Baldwin and Margaret Yocum within individual family groups.

Once its purpose was fulfilled it {{was ready for the}} trash, only to be dug up if you were really desperate…We became drug buddies: sometimes, you could even just about call us boyfriend and girlfriend. Vanity also taught me how to really freebase: the first time I based was with Tommy when Mötley just started and only a few times after that. So up until then, I’d been mostly snorting or injecting.

As for me, I was entertained at the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church, likewise at a sort of artistic club; made speeches at both, and may therefore be said to have been, like Saint Paul, all things to all men. I have an account of the latter racket which I meant to have enclosed in this.... Had some splendid photos taken, likewise a medallion by a French sculptor; met Graham, who returned with us as far as Auckland. Have seen a good deal too of Sir George Grey; what a wonderful old historic figure to be walking on your arm and recalling ancient events and instances! It makes a man small, and yet the extent to which he approved what I had done--or rather have tried to do--encouraged me. Sir George is an expert at least, he knows these races: he is not a small employé with an ink-pot and a Whitaker.|$|E
