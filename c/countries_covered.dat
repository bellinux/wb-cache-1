In 2013 researchers at the Institute for Economics and Peace harmonized the Global Peace Index database {{to ensure that the}} scores were comparable over time.

25|$|Tariff level. Water and {{sanitation}} tariffs in England and Wales have increased by 44% {{in real terms}} between 1989 and 2008–09 and are {{among the highest in}} the world. The average household water and sewage bill in England and Wales was £330 in 2008-09. According to a 2006 survey by NUS Consulting Group the average water tariff (price) without sewerage in the U.K. for large consumers was the equivalent of US$1.90 per cubic metre. This was the third-highest tariff among the 14 mostly OECD <b>countries</b> <b>covered</b> by the report. A study commissioned by the German industry association BGW in 2006, compared the average household water {{and sanitation}} bill (as opposed to the tariff per cubic metre that the NUS study used as a comparator) in four EU countries. This study showed that water bills in England and Wales were the highest among the four countries. Average water bills (excluding sanitation) were 295 euro per year in England and Wales, higher than in Germany, France (85 euro) or Italy (59 euro).|$|E
