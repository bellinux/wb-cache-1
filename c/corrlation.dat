40|$|The {{problem on}} <b>corrlation</b> between two omni imgaes is discussed, which each omni image {{has the feature}} {{distortion}} due to lens coordinate system. In {{order to make a}} precise correlation between omni images, new some image projection criteria with epipolar line are proposed. At first, a unit sphere is proposed to make a simple relationship between an omni image and a lens coordinate system. Secondly, the epipolar equation on omni images is presented. Thirdly, the variable distortion problem due to lens configuration of omni images has been discussed. Finally, some projection method are proposed and these experiment result show the validity of these new criteria. 1 Introduction The omni vision system had been widely used by several researchers [3]-[10] with a major issue of its benefits, i. e. that a surrounding image can be taken at once. This is very useful for the surveillance system, a video conference over telecommunication, robot vision for autonomous navigation, virtual reality syst [...] ...|$|E

The positive rate of the Paul-Bunnell reaction in serum hepatitis, acute hepatitis and chronic hepatitis were 87. 5 %, 68, 1 %, and 67. 1 % in each and the significant difference was observed on the positive rate of them in comparison {{to that of other}} diseases and normal person. 2. The cases seen the heterophile antibody showing the high agglutination titer mostly had the past history of hepatitis or the liver damage, the higher the agglutination titer showed, the closer was the <b>corrlation.</b> 3. The positive rate of the Paul-Bunnell reaction were high in liver cirrhosis and there were many cases with the past history of hepatitis in the cases of liver cirrhosis with the positive Paul-Bunnell reaction and it was noticed that posthepatitic liver cirrhosis immunologically had a different attitude to the liver cirrhosis attacked by other causes. 4. It was supposed that the heterophile antibody had the considerable relation with auto-liver antibody in hepatitis, but it was necessary to examine more on that the heterophila antibody was produced with the auto-liver antibody by the liver damage...|$|E

Single-j shell calculations reveal that the T = 0 correlations remain up to the highest frequencies. They are more complex than the T = 1 <b>corrlations</b> and cannot be restricted to L = 0 pairs only. Whereas {{it may be difficult to}} find clear evidence for T = 0 pairing at low spins, T = 0 correlations are found to induce a new excitation scheme at high angular momenta...|$|R

40|$|Title ofthe paper: Selection for {{litter size}} in swine The present paper {{deals with the}} {{estimation}} of genetic parameter for litter size of two purebred lines 03 and 04 in order to choose the optimal model for variance component estimation. Data from nucleus and multiplier farms from 1989 to 1997 of a North-German breeding Company were observed. 9, 957 litter records from 3, 423 sows of line 03 and 5, 045 litter records from 2, 009 sows of line 04 were collected. The 404 sires of line 03 {{had an average of}} 8. 5 daughters and the 285 sires of line 04 had an average of 7, 0 daughters. Litter size were different between both lines, 9. 6 (3. 2) and 10. 1 (3. 4) for line 03 and 04, respectively. Genetic correlations between litters of parity 1, 2 and 3 were r g > 0, 81 on high level. Also, in bivariate analysis high correlations r g > 0, 88 were estimated for both lines. This model takes the matemal effect for the first parity and the permanent environment in subsequent parities into account. Due to the results a repeatability model may be appropiate for breeding values of litter size. Estimation of genotype by environment interaction showed different heritabilities between farms. Genetic <b>corrlation</b> was on moderate level (r g = 0, 61) between two farms for line 04, other estimates ranged between r g = 0, 73 and 0, 97...|$|E
40|$|Objective To {{explore the}} {{relevance}} between the level changes of serum neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and neuronal damage in various seizure types {{of children with}} epilepsy. Methods According to the classification criteria of seizure types formulated by International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) in 1981, 190 children with epilepsy were enrolled including tonic-clonic seizure group (41 cases), tonic seizure group (34 cases), clonic seizure group (22 cases), myoclonic seizure group (12 cases), atonic seizure group (17 cases), absence seizure group (22 cases), simple partial seizure group (21 cases) and complex partial seizure group (21 cases), and 64 healthy children were enrolled as control group. The long-range vedio-electroencephalogram (VEEG) was operated and the blood samples were collected from these cases within 72 h after their seizures. Results The serum NSE levels of epileptic children {{were significantly higher than}} control group (P = 0. 000). Among these seizure groups, serum NSE in myoclonic seizure group [(32. 42 ± 6. 62) ng/ml] was significantly higher than the other types, except for tonic-clonic seizure group (P = 0. 062). There was no significant difference among the other types (P > 0. 05, for all). According to rank correlation analysis, there was positive <b>corrlation</b> between serum NSE levels and VEEG abnormal intensity (rs = 0. 613, P = 0. 000). Conclusion The serum NSE were markedly increased in children with epilepsy after seizures, suggesting that a certain degree of neuronal damage may result from seizures; the higher NSE levels were, the more serious neuronal damage caused by epileptiform discharges was. The serum NSE levels in myoclonic seizure group and tonic-clonic seizure group were significantly higher than other seizure types, indicating the two kinds of seizures may result in greater neuronal damage...|$|E
40|$|Background: Leptin, {{a protein}} {{released}} from adipose tissue, could have {{significant role in}} pathogenesis of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate variations in serum leptin levels in non-obese subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM). Patients and Methods: We studied forty-one patients with type 2 diabetes. Fasting lipid profile, Hemoglobin A 1 c (HbA 1 c), serum leptin, insulin, and glucose levels were measured by standard methods. Results: The serum leptin level in type 2 diabetic patients (19. 32 ± 11. 43 ng/mL) was significantly lower than that in non-diabetic subjects (32. 16 ± 11. 02 ng/mL). Serum leptin level was strongly and positively correlated with body mass index (BMI) (r = 0. 658, P < 0. 0001) and calculated body fat percentage (r = 0. 431, P < 0. 0001) in all the study subjects with a better <b>corrlation</b> in the control subjcts compared to control cases (r = 0. 661 for BMI and r = 0. 466 for body fat). On the other hand, leptin showed a positive and significant correlation with insulin and HOMA- β (homeostasis model assessment for β-cell function) in both groups. Furthermore, leptin related to homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (r = 0. 422, P = 0. 006) was observed only in T 2 DM subjects. Leptin showed negative correlation with waist to hip ratio in diabetic (r =- 0. 407, P = 0. 008) and non-diabetic subjects (r =- 0. 318, P = 0. 049). In the regression model, BMI, HOMA-β, and gender were independent predictors of leptin in all subjects. However, in non-diabetic and diabetic subjects, β-cell function and insulin were independent predictors, respectively (P = 0. 01) ...|$|E
40|$|Genetic {{variance}} analysis of 13 head and facial traits is considered in samples of Northwest, Indian and Belgian twins. Modified t tests, {{based on the}} nested structure of twin data, indicate differences between monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) mean values of bigonial diameter in Indian females and in Belgian males, i. e. for only two of 52 instances. Heterogeneity of variance is observed in about 30 % of the craniofacial traits in both samples, invalidating conventional within‐pair genetic variance estimates for these traits. Patterns of environmental bias on zygosities differ between sexes within the same population and also between the two samples. Revised average genetic variance ratios are higher in Indian than in Belgian twins. Male twins manifest, on average, higher genetic variance ratios than female twins in both the samples. There is stronger evidence of enviornmental covariance in MZ than in DZ twins for both Indian and Belgian twins. The pattern of intraclass <b>corrlations,</b> based on average values, is as follows: ♂rMZ > ♀rMZ > ♂rDZ ≥ ♀rDZ in the Indian twins and ♂rMZ > ♀rMZ > ♀rDZ > ♂rDZ in the Belgian twins.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundEosinophilic {{inflammation}} of the airways is a key characteristic of asthma. A defect in eosinophil apoptosis might contribute to the chronic tissue eosinophilia associated with asthma. Objective: Our purpose was to examine whether the occurrence of apoptotic eosinophils in induced sputum from asthmatic patients correlate with interleukin (IL) - 5 and eotaxin. MethodsThirty stable and 30 exacerbated asthmatic patients were recruited. Twenty healthy subjects were enrolled as a control group. Induced sputum was obtained from asthmatic patients and from control subjects. The number of apoptotic eosinophils in sputum was assessed by flow cytometry. In sputum supernatant, eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) was measured by sensitive radioimmunoassay, and IL- 5 and eotaxin by sandwich enzyme linked immunosorbant assay. ResultsLevels of eosinophils, apoptotic eosinophils, IL- 5, ECP and eotaxin from asthmatic patients were higher than those from healthy subjects. Thirty exacerbated asthmatics showed higher proportions of eosinophils (median 29. 3 %, range 13. 4 %– 40. 9 %), more detectable levels of IL- 5 (50. 44, 32. 99 – 67. 01 pg/ml) and eotaxin (644. 6, 197. 4 – 937. 7 pg/ml) in their sputum than the patients with stable asthma (P< 0. 05). There were significant inverse correlations between the levels of sputum IL- 5 {{and the proportion of}} sputum eosinophil apoptosis in patients with exacerbated and stable asthma (r=- 0. 85 and − 0. 79, P< 0. 01 and P< 0. 05, respectively). Also inverse correlations were found between the levels of eotaxin and the proportion of sputum eosinophil apoptosis in exacerbated (r=- 0. 85, P< 0. 01), or stable asthma (r=- 0. 69, P< 0. 05). Additional positive <b>corrlations</b> between the levels of sputum IL- 5 and eotaxin in either exacerbatated (r= 0. 93, P< 0. 01) or stable asthma (r= 0. 82, P< 0. 05) were observed. ConclusionsApoptosis of eosinophils might be suppressed by proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as IL- 5 and eotaxin leading to their accumulation in the lung. Stimulation of eosinophils in airway with IL- 5 and eotaxin may {{play a crucial role in}} allergic inflammation...|$|R

Materials and methods: A high-speed camera taking 300  frames per second observed movements of eight iris-claw intraocular lenses and two angle-supported intraocular lenses. Standardized saccades were {{performed by the}} patients to trigger mass inertia with lens position changes. Freeze images with maximum deviation were used for digital software-based morphometry analysis with ImageJ. Results: Two eyes from each of five patients (median age 32 years, range 28 – 45 years) without findings other than refractive errors were included. The high-speed images showed sufficient usability for further morphometric processing. In the primary eye position, the median decentrations downward and in a lateral direction were - 0. 32  mm (range - 0. 69  to 0. 024) and 0. 175  mm (range - 0. 37  to 0. 45), respectively. Despite {{the small sample size}} of asymptomatic patients, we found a considerable amount of lens dislocation. The median distance amplitude during eye movements was 0. 158  mm (range 0. 02 – 0. 84). There was a slight positive <b>corrlation</b> (r= 0. 39, P< 0. 001) between the grade of deviation in the primary position and the distance increase triggered by movements. Conclusion: With the use of a slit lamp-mounted high-speed camera system and morphometry software, observation and objective measurements of iris-claw intraocular lenses and angle-supported intraocular lenses movements seem to be possible. Slight decentration in the primary position might be an indicator of increased lens mobility during kinetic stress during eye movements. Long-term assessment by high-speed analysis with higher case numbers has to clarify the relationship between progressing motility and endothelial cell damage.
