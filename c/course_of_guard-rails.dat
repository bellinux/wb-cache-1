50|$|In Variation 3, the {{decision}} maker is knowledgeable of the situation but unaware <b>of</b> the proper <b>course</b> <b>of</b> action.

Variation 3 {{takes the form of}} “If… then… (???)” wherein {{the decision}} maker models outcomes of new or uncommon <b>courses</b> <b>of</b> action. The decision maker will cycle through different <b>courses</b> <b>of</b> action until a <b>course</b> <b>of</b> action appears appropriate to the goals and priorities of the situation. Due to the time constraint fundamental to the RPD model, {{the decision maker}} will choose the first <b>course</b> <b>of</b> action which appears appropriate to the situation. Experienced decision makers are likely to develop a viable <b>course</b> <b>of</b> action more quickly because their expert knowledge can rapidly be used to disqualify inappropriate <b>courses</b> <b>of</b> action.|$|R

50|$|The {{present form}} of RPD has three main variations.
