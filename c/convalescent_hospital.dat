5|$|The British Government {{bought the}} house and grounds in 1915, {{intending}} to construct {{a prisoner of war}} camp within the grounds. Local opposition to the plan led to the house becoming the Canadian <b>Convalescent</b> <b>Hospital</b> to care for troops evacuated from the front line during the First World War. The hospital opened on 20 September 1915 and closed on 12 December 1917, having had four commanding officers and five sisters-in-charge.|$|E
5|$|Marquis {{wished to}} be sent to France, but was {{required}} first to take a course in French. In the meantime, he was assigned to a <b>convalescent</b> <b>hospital.</b> Shortly before being sent overseas, Marquis was assigned to Camp Forrest in Lytle, Georgia, an engineering camp, where he found himself treating victims of the beginning of the 1918 flu pandemic. Marquis arrived in England just as the war ended; the flu epidemic, however, had not. He continued to Cannes, where he was assigned the task of determining the capacity of hotels for use as hospitals. In January 1919 he was assigned to the Hotel Metropole as assistant to the attending surgeon. They were soon overwhelmed with influenza cases. Marquis himself came down with flu but continued working. He was reassigned to the Hotel Suisse in Nice, but, still ill, was ordered back to the US. During the long wait for transport home, he took up medical duties in Gironde, finally docking in the US in June.|$|E
5|$|The British Government {{purchased}} the estate in 1915, {{with the intention}} of establishing a prisoner of war camp. The local population strongly opposed the plan, causing the government to relent, and the site instead became the Canadian <b>Convalescent</b> <b>Hospital</b> to care for troops evacuated from the front line during the First World War. The hospital opened on 20 September 1915 and was joined on 19 November 1917 by the Royal Flying Corps Armament School which moved into Hillingdon House with 114 officers and 1156 men, making a donation of £2289, 12s and 9d to the Canadian Red Cross. The RFC used parts of the estate not required by the Canadians, and established firing ranges for the training of recruits in ground gunnery. A total of eight of these ranges were built along the River Pinn; one remains today. The hospital closed on 12 December 1917.|$|E

40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} how much formal caregivers know about caring for stroke patients, {{and whether they}} adequately provide it. Methods Formal caregivers, who worked for stroke patients at 8 hospitals (including 4 university hospitals, 2 rehabilitation <b>hospitals,</b> and 2 <b>convalescent</b> <b>hospitals)</b> participated in this study. The survey {{was based on a}} self-report questionnaire, with 6 categories containing a total of 48 questions about the specific care of stroke patients: the demographic characteristics of the caregivers, bed positioning, the provision of meals, position changes and transfers, the range of motion exercises, and caregiver training. Results A total of 217 caregivers were surveyed, and they were distributed as follows: 41 % came from the university hospitals, 35 % came from the rehabilitation hospitals, and 24 % came from the <b>convalescent</b> <b>hospitals.</b> The percentages of correct answers were distributed as follows: 64. 3 % for bed positioning, 74. 3 % for providing meals, and 62. 4 % for position change and transfer. The total and subscale scores of the caregivers working at <b>convalescent</b> <b>hospitals</b> were significantly lower than those of the caregivers working at the other types of hospital...|$|R

25|$|The <b>Convalescent</b> <b>Hospital</b> was {{established}} at Camp Edwards in 1942. In addition to serving wounded {{coming back from}} both theaters, the hospital became famous for its convalescent trains that crossed the country and for its WAAC training program for New England nurses.

25|$|In the {{contiguous}} United States, navy {{nurses were}} stationed at 263 locations, consisting of both large naval hospital complexes such as USN Hospital San Diego, California and Bethesda, Maryland {{as well as}} at a multitude of smaller naval convalescent hospitals and training station facilities. One of the more colorful convalescent hospitals was the USN <b>Convalescent</b> <b>Hospital</b> located at the Sun Valley Lodge in Idaho. After the lodge – built by the Union Pacific Railroad and its chairman W. Averell Harriman – opened in 1936, it quickly became a hotspot for the rich and famous. Notables included Ernest Hemingway who worked on For Whom the Bell Tolls in room No. 206, Clark Gable, Errol Flynn, Claudette Colbert, Bing Crosby and Gary Cooper. However, as supporting the war became a top priority and recreation secondary, the lodge was converted into a hospital, opening its doors in July 1943. In 1946 it reverted to its intended use. The story of the USN <b>Convalescent</b> <b>Hospital</b> is not unlike a host of other facilities which were converted, including the Averell Harriman estate in the Bear Mountains of the Catskills and the Ahwahnee Hotel at Yosemite National Park.|$|E
