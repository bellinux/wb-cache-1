40|$|Zeolites {{occur in}} a variety of {{geologic}} environments and are used in numerous agricultural, commercial, and environmental applications. It is desirable to understand their stability both to predict future stability and to evaluate the geochemical conditions resulting in their formation. The use of estimated thermodynamic data for measured zeolite compositions allows thermodynamic modeling of stability relationships among zeolites in different geologic environments (diagenetic, saline and alkaline lakes, acid rock hydrothermal, basic rock, deep sea sediments). This modeling shows that the relative cation abundances in both the aqueous and solid phases, the aqueous silica activity, and temperature are important factors in determining the stable zeolite species. Siliceous zeolites (e. g., clinoptilolite, mordenite, erionite) present in saline and alkaline lakes or diagenetic deposits formed at elevated silica activities. Aluminous zeolites (e. g., natrolite, mesolite/scolecite, thomsonite) formed in basic rocks in association with reduced silica activities. Likewise, phillipsite formation is favored by reduced aqueous silica activities. The presence of erionite, chabazite, and phillipsite are indicative of environments with elevated potassium concentrations. Elevated temperature, <b>calcic</b> <b>water</b> conditions, and reduced silica activity help to enhance the laumontite and wairakite stability fields. Analcime stability increases with increased temperature and aqueous Na concentration, and/or with decreased silica activity...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{saline water}} in {{agriculture}} {{has contributed to}} the expansion of irrigated areas, especially in arid and semiarid regions, where water deficits occur during various months of the year. In this context, this study aimed to evaluate the emergence, growth, and flowering of the castor bean cultivar “BRS Energia” {{as a function of the}} cationic composition of irrigation water, including water containing single and multiple types of cations. The experiment was carried out in a greenhouse in the municipality of Campina Grande-PB, Brazil using drainage lysimeters filled with a sandy loam Ultisol. The experiment was set in a randomized block design, with four replicates each of six water salinity treatments: Control; Na+; Ca 2 +; Na+ + Ca 2 +; K+; and Na+ + Ca 2 + + Mg 2, totaling 24 experimental plots, each consisting of five plants. Plants in the control treatment were subjected to irrigation using water having low electrical conductivity (ECw = 0. 6 dS m- 1), while the plants receiving other treatments were irrigated using 4. 5 dS m- 1 water containing different ions. Emergence and growth were more affected by the ECw than by the cationic composition of the irrigation water. The order of the cations in the irrigation water, in terms of negative effects, was Na+ > Na+ + Ca+ > Ca 2 + > Na+ + Ca 2 + + Mg 2 + > K+. The cationic composition of the irrigation water influenced the time interval for inflorescence development and the opening of flower buds of the castor bean cultivar “BRS Energia”, and the most pronounced effects were observed in plants irrigated with <b>calcic</b> <b>water...</b>|$|E

40|$|At Vyrnwy, in mid-Wales, a {{study of}} the {{hydrogeochemistry}} of two small spruce forested catchments, one a control and one felled midway through the study, shows a classic picture of rainfall inputs damped by the catchment and stream waters the chemistry of which varies as functions of flow and particularly of the supply of more acidic and aluminium-bearing soil water and of more basic and <b>calcic</b> ground <b>waters</b> from the zone where weathering reactions with the bedrock are high. The ground waters are most alkaline although pH may be depressed due to high dissolved carbon dioxide pressures. Nitrate concentrations increase in the first year after felling and decrease thereafter below those of the control. Water quality changes due to the dominant hydrogeochemical processes show that harvesting raises no significant water quality management issues.
