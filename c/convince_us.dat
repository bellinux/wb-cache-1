25|$|Another highly {{classified}} U.S. {{study was}} conducted by the CIA's Office of Scientific Investigation (OS/I) {{in the latter half}} of 1952 in response to orders from the National Security Council (NSC). This study concluded UFOs were real physical objects of potential threat to national security. One OS/I memo to the CIA Director (DCI) in December read: the reports of incidents <b>convince</b> <b>us</b> that there is something going on that must have immediate attention... Sightings of unexplained objects at great altitudes and traveling at high speeds in the vicinity of major U.S. defense installations are of such a nature that they are not attributable to natural phenomena or any known types of aerial vehicles. The matter was considered so urgent that OS/I drafted a memorandum from the DCI to the NSC proposing that the NSC establish an investigation of UFOs as a priority project throughout the intelligence and the defense research and development community. It also urged the DCI to establish an external research project of top-level scientists, now known as the Robertson Panel to analyze the problem of UFOs. The OS/I investigation was called off after the Robertson Panel's negative conclusions in January 1953.|$|E

25|$|I cannot {{understand}} why we idle discussing religion. If we are honest—and scientists have to be—we must admit that religion is a jumble of false assertions, with no basis in reality. The very idea of God {{is a product of}} the human imagination. It is quite understandable why primitive people, who were so much more exposed to the overpowering forces of nature than we are today, should have personified these forces in fear and trembling. But nowadays, when we understand so many natural processes, we have no need for such solutions. I can't for the life of me see how the postulate of an Almighty God helps us in any way. What I do see is that this assumption leads to such unproductive questions as why God allows so much misery and injustice, the exploitation of the poor by the rich and all the other horrors He might have prevented. If religion is still being taught, it is by no means because its ideas still <b>convince</b> <b>us,</b> but simply because some of us want to keep the lower classes quiet. Quiet people are much easier to govern than clamorous and dissatisfied ones. They are also much easier to exploit. Religion is a kind of opium that allows a nation to lull itself into wishful dreams and so forget the injustices that are being perpetrated against the people. Hence the close alliance between those two great political forces, the State and the Church. Both need the illusion that a kindly God rewards—in heaven if not on earth—all those who have not risen up against injustice, who have done their duty quietly and uncomplainingly. That is precisely why the honest assertion that God is a mere product of the human imagination is branded as the worst of all mortal sins.|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} development of Andrea produced uniform praise among critics.

[...] "After a season of whining, there {{had to have been}} at least a few fans pulling for the walkers in her early scenes, but she quickly became Linda Hamilton-badass, braining zombies with her foot," [...] he said. Likewise, Kine asserted that [...] "the badass she has tried so hard to <b>convince</b> <b>us</b> all she is finally came across." [...] Ryan thought that Andrea's struggle to survive was a strong way to build up the exodus of the group. She spoke of her scene with Michonne: [...] "She'd fought so hard to live that I wanted Andrea to fend off that final batch of walkers successfully.

[...] Ritkoff expressed that the episode's conclusion was a rational and level-headed resolution to the storyline; [...] "Whatever jealousy he might feel, it would have been absurd for Rick to punish the woman he loves most in the world for post-apocalyptic infidelity under these circumstances." [...] Sepinwall commended Rick's reaction to Lori's confessions, and Goldman felt that their interaction was well acted and perfectly scripted.

Patrick Gann of RPGFan wrote that the second disc, which contains music for cutscenes and special events, was stronger than the first disc's generic town and battle themes.

500|$|According to Nancy Keefe Rhodes of Stone Canoe, a U.S. {{literary}} journal, the film's {{audiences are}} likely to have the preconception that human trafficking is not slavery in the same sense that the Atlantic slave trade was, and many people believe that slavery was abolished a long time ago with such instruments as the U.S. Emancipation Proclamation and Thirteenth Amendment. Rhodes writes that society now uses the word [...] "slavery" [...] in modern contexts only as a metaphor, so that references to actual contemporary slavery can be dismissed as hyperbole, and she describes the film's goal as to [...] "reclaim the original term [...] and <b>convince</b> <b>us</b> that what is happening now is what happened then: highly organized and pervasive, intentional, highly profitable and... fully as coercive and wantonly cruel." [...] Rhodes says that the word [...] "slavery" [...] has started to be used in its original sense again in recent years, but that audiences' views on contemporary slavery are nonetheless influenced by the slave-like imagery in such films as Hustle & Flow (2005) and Black Snake Moan (2007). The Academy Award-winning Hustle & Flow portrays a pimp as the hero, while Black Snake Moan features Christina Ricci as a young nymphomaniac; the marketing for Black Snake Moan centered on evocative, sexualized slave imagery, including a scantily-clad Ricci in chains. According to Rhodes, Bilheimer [...] "rescue modern slaves from representation as exotic creatures, to restore their humanity" [...] and allow audiences to relate to them. For this purpose, Bilheimer tells stories of individuals {{in the context of their}} communities and families. While Bilheimer had previously done extensive social justice work with religious organizations, he did not proselytize in the film, despite the many opportunities the film afforded him to do so.|$|E

Elena Gorgon from Softpedia echoed earlier sentiments, concluding that the song [...] "was powerful, it's heartfelt and it confirms Leona {{as one of the most}} remarkable vocalists of the day." [...] However MSN's Danielle Cheeseman said that [...] "Trouble" [...] being a safe return to what Lewis has always done wasn't necessarily a good thing. In her review, Cheeseman called the song the [...] "same melodrama" [...] as past Lewis songs and that due to the song sounding familiar to Sandé's song [...] "Daddy", [...] "Lewis has yet to find her own stride". Corner featured [...] "Trouble" [...] on his weekly playlist [...] "10 Songs You Need to Hear" [...] for the week beginning 27 August 2012. There he described elaborated that the song was a welcome return for Lewis thanks to [...] "big beats, big strings and even bigger vocals". Whilst the majority of reviews praised Gambino's appearance on the song, Cheeseman described the collaboration as [...] "a saviour" [...] but that it did nothing for Lewis' [...] "credibility". Her review was subtitled [...] "Leona Lewis Tries to <b>Convince</b> <b>Us</b> She's 'Trouble' — We're not buyin' what she's sellin'" [...] and concluded that if the best that Glassheart could preview after all the delays was [...] "Trouble", [...] "it won't be worth the wait."
