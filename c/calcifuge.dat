5000|$|Like most Ericaceae, Erica {{species are}} mainly <b>calcifuges,</b> being limited to acidic or very acidic soils. In fact, the term [...] "ericaceous" [...] is {{frequently}} {{applied to all}} <b>calcifuges,</b> and to the compost used in their cultivation. Soils range from dry, sandy soils to extremely wet ones such as bog. They often dominate dwarf-shrub habitats (heathland and moorland), or the ground vegetation of open acidic woodland.|$|R

50|$|In 2002, a new multistorey complex was built; it {{includes}} a cafe and a large lecture theatre.It has responsibility for the Arboretum at Kilmacurragh, County Wicklow, a centre noted for its conifers and <b>calcifuges.</b> This is located some 50 km south of Dublin.|$|R
50|$|Maquis shrubland is broadly {{similar to}} garrigue, but the {{vegetation}} is more dense, being composed of numerous closely spaced shrubs. Maquis {{is associated with}} siliceous (acid) soils, unlike the relatively alkaline calcareous soils of the garrigue. Its plant communities are often suites associated with holm oak. <b>Calcifuges</b> such as Erica and Calluna {{are present in the}} maquis ecoregion.|$|R
5000|$|While most {{carnivorous}} {{plants are}} <b>calcifuges</b> that cannot tolerate alkaline soils, D. falconeri grows on calcareous sandy soils with high pH values. In the first {{account of this}} species' habitat, the soil pH at the site was recorded as pH 8. [...] At the site where D. falconeri was first discovered, tall dense grass covered the small population.|$|R
50|$|The {{plant is}} a <b>calcifuge,</b> favoring acidic soil, in pine or {{hardwood}} forests, although it generally produces fruit only in sunnier areas. It often grows {{as part of}} the heath complex in an oak-heath forest.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>calcifuge</b> is a {{plant that}} does not {{tolerate}} alkaline (basic) soil. [...] The word {{is derived from the}} Latin 'to flee from chalk'. These plants are also described as ericaceous, as the prototypical <b>calcifuge</b> is the genus Erica (heaths). It is not the presence of carbonate or hydroxide ions per se that these plants cannot tolerate, but the fact that under alkaline conditions, iron becomes less soluble. Consequently, calcifuges grown on alkaline soils often develop the symptoms of iron deficiency, i.e. interveinal chlorosis of new growth. There are many horticultural plants which are calcifuges, most of which require an 'ericaceous' compost with a low pH, composed principally of Sphagnum moss peat.|$|E
50|$|In cultivation, {{like other}} heathers, E. tetralix {{requires}} an acidic soil, {{as it is}} a <b>calcifuge.</b> Numerous cultivars have been developed for garden use, of which E. tetralix f. alba 'Alba Mollis' (a white-flowered variety) have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.|$|E
50|$|The {{underlying}} geology {{ensures that}} most of the site is well drained, favouring lime-loving plants - the calcicoles. There are, however, localised areas with poorer drainage and in which some lime-hating plants can be found - the <b>calcifuges</b> - such as bracken Pteridium aquilinum, as well as plants associated with water-logged conditions such as common valerian Valeriana officinalis and wild angelica Angelica sylvestris.|$|R
50|$|It is very widely {{grown as}} an {{ornamental}} plant for its winter flowering; over 100 cultivars {{have been selected}} for variation in flower and leaf colour. Unlike most species of Erica, which are typically <b>calcifuges,</b> it tolerates mildly alkaline as well as acidic soils, {{making it easier to}} grow in many areas. Like other species within the genus Erica it is often seen as groundcover amongst plantings of dwarf conifers.|$|R
50|$|Chalk heath in {{southern}} Britain includes calcicoles such as salad burnet (Sanguisorba minor), dropwort (Filipendula vulgaris) and common milkwort (Polygala vulgaris), and <b>calcifuges</b> such as bell heather (Erica cinerea), ling heather (Calluna vulgaris), heath grass (Danthonia decumbens), sheep's sorrel (Rumex acetosella) and betony (Stachys officinalis). It also includes plants which can tolerate both acidic and basic conditions, such as common bent (Agrostis capillaris), wood sage (Teucrium scorodonia) and sometimes juniper (Juniperus communis).|$|R
50|$|Both {{subspecies}} are <b>calcifuge,</b> occurring only in siliceous sands {{derived from}} weathered granite. Thus most populations {{are associated with}} granite monadnocks. Though its range is restricted, it is locally common and often dominant. A. sericeus subsp. sphalma is often found in association with Nuytsia floribunda, Kunzea baxteri, and Xanthorrhoea species.|$|E

2500|$|In Japan, bonsai soil mixes {{based on}} {{volcanic}} clays are common. The volcanic clay has been fired {{at some point}} in time to create porous, water-retaining pellets. Varieties such as akadama, or [...] "red ball" [...] soil, and kanuma, a type of yellow pumice used for azaleas and other <b>calcifuges,</b> are used by many bonsai growers. Similar fired clay soil components are extracted or manufactured in other countries around the world, and other soil components like diatomaceous earth can fill a similar purpose in bonsai cultivation.|$|R
40|$|We {{classified}} 747 {{species of}} British and Irish mosses into 10 clusters, {{based on their}} recorded distribution in 10610 km grid squares (hectads). We generated the clusters in a two-stage process using the CLUSTASPEC program, the method that we had earlier used for British and Irish liverworts and hornworts. The clusters are named after the species with distributions which are most {{similar to those of}} the clusters as a whole. Clusters of widespread species (Bryum capillare), southern, lowland species (Rhynchostegium confertum), widespread <b>calcifuges</b> (Pleurozium schreberi), upland species (Blindia acuta), and montane <b>calcifuges</b> (Kiaeria falcata) closely match clusters recognised in the liverworts. The remaining clusters (Tortella flavovirens, Weissia longifolia, Mnium stellare, Encalypta alpina, Mnium lycopodioides) are less similar. The classification of mosses into 15 and 20 clusters generates additional clusters of hyperoceanic and montane mosses which also resemble liverwort clusters. The influence of calcareous bedrock has a more marked effect in determining moss distributions and, unlike the liverworts, the 10 moss clusters include one which is predominantly coastal. Mosses tend to be a less upland group than liverworts; a smaller proportion of their species have northern and western distributions and the lowland clusters are characterised by more extreme environmental conditions. As with the liverworts, geographically restricted clusters of species with predominantly Mediterranean-Atlantic, Arctic-montane and Boreo-arctic Montane world ranges include marked concentrations of threatened species, and species which are not recorded as fruiting in the British Isles...|$|R
2500|$|Although {{different}} species of carnivorous plants have different cultivation requirements in terms of sunlight, humidity, soil moisture, etc., there are commonalities. Most carnivorous plants require rainwater, or water that has been distilled, deionised by reverse osmosis, or acidified to around pH 6.5 using sulfuric acid. Common tap or drinking water contains minerals (particularly calcium salts) that will quickly build up and kill the plant. This is because most carnivorous plants have evolved in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and are consequently extreme <b>calcifuges.</b> They are therefore very sensitive to excessive soil-borne nutrients. Since most of these plants are found in bogs, almost all are very intolerant of drying. There are exceptions: ...|$|R
50|$|Observation of {{predominant}} flora. <b>Calcifuge</b> plants (those that prefer an acidic soil) include Erica, Rhododendron {{and nearly}} all other Ericaceae species, many birch (Betula), foxglove (Digitalis), gorse (Ulex spp.), and Scots Pine (Pinus sylvestris). Calcicole (lime loving) plants include ash trees (Fraxinus spp.), honeysuckle (Lonicera), Buddleja, dogwoods (Cornus spp.), lilac (Syringa) and Clematis species.|$|E
50|$|Chalk heath {{is a rare}} habitat, in the {{temperate}} grasslands, savannas, and shrublands biome, formed of {{a paradoxical}} mixture of shallow-rooted <b>calcifuge</b> ("calcium-hating") and deeper-rooted calcicole ("calcium-loving") plants, growing on {{a thin layer of}} acidic soil over an alkaline substrate. Chalk heath is intermediate between two much more widespread habitats, chalk grassland and heathland.|$|E
50|$|Erica arborea is {{an upright}} {{evergreen}} shrub or small tree with a typical height {{in the wild}} of some 7 m, especially in Africa, but more typically 1 - 4 m in gardens, bearing dark green needle-like leaves and numerous small honey-scented bell-shaped white flowers. It is a <b>calcifuge,</b> preferring acid soil in an open sunny situation.|$|E

40|$|Questions: Effects of soil on {{vegetation}} {{patterns are}} commonly obscured by other environmental factors; clear and general relationships {{are difficult to}} find. How would community assembly processes be affected by a substantial change in soil characteristics when all other relevant factors are held constant? In particular, can we identify some functional adaptations which would underpin such soil-induced vegetation response? Location: Eastern Serbia: fields partially damaged by long-term and large-scale fluvial deposition of sulphidic waste from a Cu mine; subcontinental/ submediterranean climate. Methods: We analysed the multivariate response of cereal weed assemblages (including biomass and foliar analyses) to a strong man-made soil gradient (from highly calcareous to highly acidic, nutrient-poor soils) over short distances (field scale). Results: The soil gradient favoured a substitution of calcicoles by <b>calcifuges,</b> an...|$|R
50|$|However, a plant may be {{intolerant}} {{of a particular}} pH in some soils {{as a result of}} a particular mechanism, and that mechanism may not apply in other soils. For example, a soil low in molybdenum may not be suitable for soybean plants at pH 5.5, but soils with sufficient molybdenum allow optimal growth at that pH. Similarly, some <b>calcifuges</b> (plants {{intolerant of}} high-pH soils) can tolerate calcareous soils if sufficient phosphorus is supplied. Another confounding factor is that different varieties of the same species often have different suitable soil pH ranges. Plant breeders can use this to breed varieties that can tolerate conditions that are otherwise considered unsuitable for that species - examples are projects to breed aluminium-tolerant and manganese-tolerant varieties of cereal crops for food production in strongly acidic soils.|$|R
50|$|Adenanthos sericeus subsp. sericeus occurs mostly around King George Sound, {{extending}} west {{as far as}} Torbay Inlet {{and east}} almost to Cape Riche; it sometimes occurs {{very close to the}} sea. It is <b>calcifuge,</b> occurring only in siliceous sands derived from weathered granite. Thus most populations are associated with granite monadnocks. Though its range is restricted, it is locally common and often dominant.|$|E
50|$|It {{is grown}} as an {{ornamental}} plant, cultivated {{in a wider}} range of colors. It is drought-tolerant and grows well in full sun with well-drained soil. Like most heathers, it is a <b>calcifuge</b> and dislikes alkaline soils (e.g. calcareous) which cause the symptoms of iron deficiency. Like other cultivated heathers, it is often seen as groundcover among plantings of dwarf conifers.|$|E
50|$|Nardus stricta {{occurs on}} heath, moorland, hills, and {{mountains}} on nutrient poor acidic sandy to peaty soils and is strongly <b>calcifuge,</b> avoiding calcareous soils. It can occur from low elevations to over 1000 m, becoming a community-dominant in late snow patches on mountains. Nardus stricta may {{also become a}} dominant species in habitats grazed by cattle or sheep because it is tough and unpalatable.|$|E
50|$|Today camellias {{are grown}} as {{ornamental}} plants for their flowers; about 3,000 cultivars and hybrids have been selected, many with double or semi-double flowers. C. japonica {{is the most}} prominent species in cultivation, with over 2,000 named cultivars. Next are C. reticulata with over 400 named cultivars, and C. sasanqua with over 300 named cultivars. Popular hybrids include C. × hiemalis (C. japonica × C. sasanqua) and C. × williamsii (C. japonica × Camellia saluenensis|C. saluenensis). Some varieties can grow to a considerable size, up to , though more compact cultivars are available. They are frequently planted in woodland settings, alongside other <b>calcifuges</b> such as rhododendrons, and are particularly associated with areas of high soil acidity, such as Cornwall and Devon in the UK. They are highly valued for their very early flowering, often among the first flowers {{to appear in the}} late winter. Late frosts can damage the flower buds, resulting in misshapen flowers.|$|R
40|$|Generalizations about urban bryophytes in European {{cities have}} {{received}} little attention in Britain. Here {{they are treated}} as hypotheses, to be tested against {{the results of a}} detailed survey of King’s Lynn, a town of about 41 000 people in eastern England. During 1999 – 2004 the flora was enumerated in twenty-five 1 -km squares, arranged in a square of side 5 km. The species total for King’s Lynn was 151, with an average of 42 species per 1 -km square. We compared the flora of the town with that of the East Anglian region, from which 345 species have been recorded. Frequency of species in 1 -km squares of King’s Lynn was strongly related to frequency in 5 -km squares in East Anglia. The King’s Lynn flora was, for the region, exceptionally species-rich, with more <b>calcifuges</b> and fewer epiphytes than would be expected from the regional average. In the 1 -km square containing the town centre, 28 species were recorded, of which Bryum caespiticium, Ceratodon purpureus, Funaria hygrometrica and Marchantia polymorpha were more frequent in the town than in the wider countryside...|$|R
40|$|Of {{the many}} {{nutrients}} essential for normal {{growth and development}} of plants, calcium occupies a unique position both chemically and functionally. As excess calcium is toxic to plants the sequestering of incoming calcium as calcium oxalate in epidermal trichomes has been studied in calcicoles from high calcium enriched environments. Much less {{is known about the}} patterns of variation in root structure in calcicoles, <b>calcifuges</b> and non-calcicoles in response to elevated levels of rhizospheric calcium. Six ecotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana, comprising the putative calcicole, Cal- 0, the non-calcicole, Col- 4 and four accessions collected from the wild were subjected to concentrations of rhizospheric calcium ranging from nil to 30 mM. The pattern of root growth, particularly lateral root formation and growth, varied in all the ecotypes according to the concentration of external calcium. In addition, the Glenisla, putative non-calcicole accession displayed a marked reduction in primary root growth at high rhizospheric calcium. In depth analysis of the root structure and morphology is in process. Glenisla also showed a marked difference in fresh weight of both shoots and roots and the shoot to root ratio in comparison to the other ecotypes...|$|R
