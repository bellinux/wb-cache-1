5|$|The cy-près {{doctrine}} {{is the idea}} that, where a charitable trust's purposes are impossible or cannot be fulfilled for whatever reason, the funds should be reapplied to purposes as <b>close</b> <b>as</b> possible to the trust's original goals. This is done through a formal application by the trustees, either to the High Court of Justice or the Charity Commission. This doctrine originated in ecclesiastical law, the name coming as a contraction of the Norman French cy près comme possible (as <b>close</b> <b>as</b> possible), It was originally justified in an ecclesiastical way; charitable gifts were provided to secure entry into heaven, and if the charitable gift failed, {{this would not be}} guaranteed. If it was re-purposed, however, entry would be granted. The local bishop, therefore, would usually simply apply the gift to the nearest possible purpose to the testator's original goals.|$|E

5|$|A port of Titan Quest for mobile devices was {{developed}} under license from Nordic Games by DotEmu, a French developer {{who had previously}} developed a successful mobile port of Ys Chronicles I. The controls and interface were redesigned {{from the ground up}} to work for touchscreen controls, something the team spent months on. Despite the changes, the team worked to make the gameplay as <b>close</b> <b>as</b> possible to the original experience. They also put in additional options for actions such as targeting enemies with mastery abilities and searching for loot It released on May 19, 2016 for iOS.

5|$|Another {{person to}} testify was Robert Havelka, {{who worked as}} a {{security}} guard the night of the incident. Havelka said that the guardrail was too close to the stage, but not so <b>close</b> <b>as</b> to make a platform for climbing the stage. He testified that he pulled one person off the stage and that another person fell off before he could be secured. He further said that the fan's fall might have been helped by someone else, perhaps the singer, though he did not see it precisely.|$|E
5|$|As a boy, Truman was {{interested}} in music, reading, war, and history, all encouraged by his mother, with whom he was very <b>close.</b> <b>As</b> president, he solicited {{political as well as}} personal advice from her. He rose at five every morning to practice the piano, which he studied twice a week until he was fifteen. Truman worked as a page at the 1900 Democratic National Convention at Convention Hall in Kansas City; his father had many friends who were active in the Democratic Party and helped young Harry to gain his first political position.|$|E

Its twin Pioneer 11 visited Jupiter a year later, traveling along a highly inclined trajectory and approaching the planet as <b>close</b> <b>as</b> 1.6RJ.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} 1967, Nixon {{told his}} family he planned to run for {{president}} a second time. Although Pat Nixon did not always enjoy public life (for example, she had been embarrassed by the need to reveal how little the family owned in the Checkers speech), she was supportive of her husband's ambitions. Nixon believed that with the Democrats torn over the issue of the Vietnam War, a Republican had a good chance of winning, although he expected the election to be as <b>close</b> <b>as</b> in 1960.|$|E
5|$|Bootlegs {{should not}} be {{confused}} with counterfeit or unlicensed recordings, which are merely unauthorised duplicates of officially released recordings, often attempting to resemble the official product as <b>close</b> <b>as</b> possible. Some record companies have considered that any record issued outside of their control, and for which they do not receive payment, to be a counterfeit, which includes bootlegs. However, some bootleggers are keen to stress that the markets for bootleg and counterfeit recordings are different, and a typical consumer for a bootleg will have bought most or all of that artist's official releases anyway.|$|E
5|$|Cole {{once again}} found {{himself with a}} chance in the Bayern box, but keeper Oliver Kahn hurried out of his goal to punch the ball to safety. At the other end, Basler came close with another free kick before Alexander Zickler sent a shot just wide {{from the edge of}} the box. As half time approached, United winger Ryan Giggs, playing out of {{position}} on the right, sent a weak header towards Kahn from a Cole cross, but that was as <b>close</b> <b>as</b> they were to come to a goal in the first half.|$|E

5|$|Describing {{the choice}} of {{developing}} a game based on the existing White Wolf property over creating their own, Boyarsky said that although an original property lacked the constraints of an existing one, the downside was {{that it had not}} been tested and could be rejected by its potential audience; an existing property was proven. Troika tried to stay as <b>close</b> <b>as</b> possible to the White Wolf rules, while reducing the number of abilities and disciplines to those relevant to Bloodlines gameplay.|$|E

Brown performed well {{in the southern part of}} the state near Cape Cod. Warren made history by becoming the first woman elected to the U.S. Senate in the state of Massachusetts.|$|E

However, biologists have confirmed isolated sightings of sea otters in these areas since the mid-1990s.|$|E

5|$|It {{was seen}} in Figure2 that Foucault placed the {{rotating}} mirror R as <b>close</b> <b>as</b> possible to lens L so as to maximize the distance between R and the slit S. As R rotates, an enlarged image of slit S sweeps {{across the face of}} the distant mirror M. The greater the distance RM, the more quickly that the image sweeps across mirror M and the less light is reflected back. Foucault could not increase the RM distance in his folded optical arrangement beyond about 20meters without the image of the slit becoming too dim to accurately measure.|$|E

After Leeds posted a fourth-place finish in the league, his {{teammates}} {{then went on to}} lose to Charlton Athletic in the play-off final – Swan missed the game due to his knee injury – this would be as <b>close</b> <b>as</b> Swan would get to reaching the top-flight of English football.|$|E
