5|$|A {{river of}} sea water, called the Atlantic North Equatorial <b>Current,</b> <b>flows</b> westward {{off the coast}} of Central Africa. When this current interacts with the northeastern coast of South America, the current forks into two {{branches}}. One passes into the Caribbean Sea, while a second, the Antilles <b>Current,</b> <b>flows</b> north and east of the West Indies. These two branches rejoin north of the Straits of Florida.|$|E
5|$|Surface {{currents}} only {{affect the}} top few hundred meters (yards) of the sea, {{but there are}} also large-scale flows in the ocean depths caused by the movement of deep water masses. A main deep ocean <b>current</b> <b>flows</b> through all the world's oceans and is known as the thermohaline circulation or global conveyor belt. This movement is slow and is driven by differences in density of the water caused by variations in salinity and temperature. At high latitudes, the water is chilled by the low atmospheric temperature and becomes saltier as sea ice crystallizes out. Both these factors make it denser and the water sinks. From the deep sea near Greenland, such water flows southwards between the continental landmasses {{on either side of the}} Atlantic. When it reaches the Antarctic, it is joined by further masses of cold, sinking water and flows eastwards. It then splits into two streams that move northwards into the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Here it is gradually warmed, becomes less dense, rises towards the surface, and loops back on itself. Some flows back into the Atlantic. It takes a thousand years for this circulation pattern to be completed.|$|E
5|$|The main {{driver of}} Jupiter's {{magnetosphere}} is the planet's rotation. In this respect Jupiter {{is similar to}} a device called a Unipolar generator. When Jupiter rotates, its ionosphere moves relatively to the dipole magnetic field of the planet. Because the dipole magnetic moment points {{in the direction of the}} rotation, the Lorentz force, which appears as a result of this motion, drives negatively charged electrons to the poles, while positively charged ions are pushed towards the equator. As a result, the poles become negatively charged and the regions closer to the equator become positively charged. Since the magnetosphere of Jupiter is filled with highly conductive plasma, the electrical circuit is closed through it. A current called the direct <b>current</b> <b>flows</b> along the magnetic field lines from the ionosphere to the equatorial plasma sheet. This current then flows radially away from the planet within the equatorial plasma sheet and finally returns to the planetary ionosphere from the outer reaches of the magnetosphere along the field lines connected to the poles. The currents that flow along the magnetic field lines are generally called field-aligned or Birkeland currents. The radial current interacts with the planetary magnetic field, and the resulting Lorentz force accelerates the magnetospheric plasma in the direction of planetary rotation. This is the main mechanism that maintains co-rotation of the plasma in Jupiter's magnetosphere.|$|E

By alongshore winds, upwelling <b>current</b> <b>flows</b> to the coast. Near the equator, the East African Coast Current (EACC) flows northward across the equator. The southern Somali <b>Current</b> <b>flows</b> northward {{as an extension of the}} EACC from south to the 3-4°N.|$|E

40|$|In this chapter, {{in order}} to improve the {{electrical}} conduction of Mg-doped p-type GaN contacts, enhancement of hydrogen release from GaN substrates is attempted. The electrical conduction profiles of the p-type GaN/Ni contact annealed at 573 K and 673 K for 3600 s while subjected to <b>current</b> <b>flow</b> show some improvement compared to the contact annealed without applying the <b>current</b> <b>flow.</b> From these results, it can be understood that by applying <b>current</b> <b>flow</b> through the GaN substrates during annealing process, hydrogen release form GaN substrates can be enhanced by even annealing at low temperature. To understand the mechanism of hydrogen release by applying <b>current</b> <b>flow</b> during annealing, the change in current values p-type GaN contacts during annealing has been observed. By using regression analysis and kinetic model, the electrical conduction improvement achieve by applying <b>current</b> <b>flow</b> through GaN substrate during annealing have been analysis.

40|$|The {{computation}} of nodes centrality is {{of great}} importance {{for the analysis of}} graphs. The <b>current</b> <b>flow</b> betweenness is an interesting centrality index that is computed by considering how the information travels along all the possible paths of a graph. The <b>current</b> <b>flow</b> betweenness exploits basic results from electrical circuits, i. e. Kirchhoff 2 ̆ 7 s laws, to evaluate the centrality of vertices. The computation of the <b>current</b> <b>flow</b> betweenness may exceed the computational capability of a single machine for very large graphs composed by millions of nodes. In this paper we propose a solution that estimates the <b>current</b> <b>flow</b> betweenness in a distributed setting, by defining a vertex-centric, gossip-based algorithm. Each node, relying on its local information, in a self-adaptive way generates new flows to improve the betweenness of all the nodes of the graph. Our experimental evaluation shows that our proposal achieves high correlation with the exact <b>current</b> <b>flow</b> betweenness, and provides a good centrality measure for large graphs...|$|R
25|$|If the {{conductors}} {{are separated}} by a material with a small conductivity rather than a perfect dielectric, then a small leakage <b>current</b> <b>flows</b> directly between them. The capacitor therefore has a finite parallel resistance, and slowly discharges over time (time may vary greatly depending on the capacitor material and quality).|$|E
25|$|ESR {{depends on}} {{temperature}} and frequency. For aluminum electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolyte the ESR generally decreases {{with increasing frequency}} and temperature. ESR influences the remaining superimposed AC ripple behind smoothing and may influence circuit functionality. Related to the capacitor, ESR is accountable for internal heat generation if a ripple <b>current</b> <b>flows</b> over the capacitor. This internal heat reduces capacitor lifetime.|$|E
25|$|The {{ignition}} firing sequence {{begins with}} the points (or contact breaker) closed. A steady <b>current</b> <b>flows</b> from the battery, through the current-limiting resistor, through the primary coil, through the closed breaker points and finally back to the battery. This current produces a magnetic field within the coil's core. This magnetic field forms the energy reservoir {{that will be used}} to drive the ignition spark.|$|E
30|$|Pressure {{gradients}} {{are created}} in the magnetosphere which induce electric <b>currents</b> <b>flowing</b> orthogonally to the magnetic field. These pressure gradients are mainly due to the ions, because their pressure {{is larger than the}} one of the electrons. The divergence of these orthogonal electric currents generates electric <b>currents</b> <b>flowing</b> along the magnetic field lines, the so-called field-aligned currents. They close in the ionosphere and induce electric <b>currents</b> <b>flowing</b> horizontally in the ionosphere. They correspond to a second coupling between the magnetosphere and the ionosphere.|$|R
50|$|The Nernst {{equation}} also only applies {{when there}} is no net <b>current</b> <b>flow</b> through the electrode.

50|$|The {{proximity}} effect is {{result of a}} changing magnetic field which influences the distribution of an electric <b>current</b> <b>flowing</b> within an electrical conductor due to electromagnetic induction. When an alternating <b>current</b> (AC) <b>flows</b> through an isolated conductor, it creates an associated alternating magnetic field around it. The alternating magnetic field induces eddy currents in adjacent conductors, altering the overall distribution of <b>current</b> <b>flowing</b> through them.|$|R
25|$|The {{magnetization}} {{state of}} a MTJ {{can be controlled}} by Spin-transfer torque, and can thus, through this intrinsic physical mechanism, exhibit memristive behavior. This spin torque is induced by current flowing through the junction, and leads to an efficient means of achieving a MRAM. However, {{the length of time}} the <b>current</b> <b>flows</b> through the junction determines the amount of current needed, i.e., charge is the key variable.|$|E
25|$|Some systems use Null Current systems (also {{sometimes}} called Null Flux systems). These use a coil that is wound {{so that it}} enters two opposing, alternating fields, so that the average flux in the loop is zero. When the vehicle is in the straight ahead position, no <b>current</b> <b>flows,</b> but any moves off-line create flux that generates a field that naturally pushes/pulls it back into line.|$|E
25|$|Here ε and µ {{denote the}} {{dielectric}} constant and magnetic permeability {{of the medium}} that the conductors are embedded in. There is no electric and no magnetic field inside the conductors (complete skin effect, high frequency). <b>Current</b> <b>flows</b> down on one line and returns on the other.

50|$|In alternating-current circuits, {{opposition}} to <b>current</b> <b>flow</b> occurs because of resistance, {{just as in}} direct-current circuits. However, alternating current circuits also include a second kind of {{opposition to}} current flow: reactance.
