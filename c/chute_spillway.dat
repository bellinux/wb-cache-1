40|$|Flip buckets {{are usually}} {{placed at the}} end of <b>chute</b> <b>spillways</b> or outlet {{conduits}} of high dams. The projected jets from these buckets jump into plunge pools to dissipate the destructive energy of plunging jets. Compound flip bucket is a special bucket with a non-zero degree of cross sectional slope, followed by a curvature in its longitudinal direction. These structures are very suitable for restricted geometries and conditional topographies. Although, studies of flow over flip buckets turn back to many years and there are valuable information for simple buckets, but still there are uncertainties regarding the flow over compound flip buckets. Therefore, in this study the hydraulic parameters such as pressure, velocity and depth of flow on these structures are presented. Two <b>chute</b> <b>spillways</b> with their flip buckets were used to check the pressure distribution and its variation with different hydraulic characteristic along the compound flip buckets. The scaled model of Gotvand dam (south of Iran) at Water Research Institute of Iran was used for this study. The Froude number varies in the range of 3. 5 to 7. 5. The results are presented in the form of dimensionless equation, which was calibrated based on the present results. The location of maximum dynamic pressure and pattern of flow obstruction on the bed of the compound flip bucket is also presented...|$|R

40|$|Cases of damages {{experienced}} in stilling basins {{and on the}} toe of <b>chute</b> <b>spillways</b> are recognized {{to be due to}} global instantaneous uplift force resulting from imbalance between the instantaneous pressure distribution both above and below slabs. The latter is due to pressure fluctuation propagation forced though unsealed slab joints. In the past, several theoretical approaches were developed to estimate the uplift contribution due to pressure transmission underneath the slabs. In the paper, a model is presented, based on unsteady flow analysis of seepage through porous media, that shows that the propagation models proposed in literature are particular cases of this more comprehensive formulation. In addition, the use of the unsteady seepage model makes it possible to account for finite thickness foundation layers, typical in the cases of earth dams, rock-fill dams, and in other dam types, whenever the slabs are posed on alluvial substrates. Experimental results obtained in laboratory facilities, as reported in literature, might underestimate the stable slab thickness due to limits in accurately reproducing the foundation layer...|$|R
