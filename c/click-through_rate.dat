40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{models for}} predicted <b>click-through</b> <b>rates</b> in position auctions that {{take into account}} two possibilities that are not normally considered [...] -that the identities of ads shown in other positions may affect the probability that an ad in a particular position receives a click (externalities) and that some ads may be less adversely affected by being shown in a lower position than others (brand effects). We present a general axiomatic methodology for how click probabilities {{are affected by the}} qualities of the ads in the other positions, and illustrate that using these axioms will increase revenue as long as higher quality ads tend to be ranked ahead of lower quality ads. We also present appropriate algorithms for selecting the optimal allocation of ads when predicted <b>click-through</b> <b>rates</b> are governed by either the models of externalities or brand effects that we consider. Finally, we analyze the performance of a greedy algorithm of ranking the ads by their expected cost-per- 1000 -impressions bids when the true <b>click-through</b> <b>rates</b> are governed by our model of predicted <b>click-through</b> <b>rates</b> with brand effects and illustrate that such an algorithm will potentially cost as much as half of the total possible social welfare.

40|$|This study aims {{to measure}} {{the impact of these}} two {{variables}} on consumers' 'click-through' rates (the number of users that click on the ad compared to the number of times the ad is delivered). The result is as follows. First, search ads {{play a critical role in}} drawing consumers to advertisers' websites. Once search ads are placed, the number of visitors increased tenfold. Secondly, when search ads are keyed to highly-involved words such as 'IDC', 'hosting' and 'co-location', <b>click-through</b> <b>rates</b> significantly fluctuate according to the type of advertising message. In this case, consumers respond much more positively to ads highlighting credibility and product quality than to ads with emphasis on sales and events. Thirdly, the placement of search ads also matters. The ad placed first in the search list overpowers ads in the third or fifth place in terms of <b>click-through</b> <b>rates.</b> However, there was no significant difference of <b>click-through</b> <b>rates</b> between ads in the third place and ads in fifth. Lastly, when estimating which variable plays the bigger role in bringing traffic to advertisers' websites, consumers are more receptive to the substance of the advertising message than to its placement, under the circumstances of high involvement...|$|R
5000|$|The {{move to a}} session-based model {{might even}} give new life to beleaguered metrics such as the click-through. Many {{marketers}} equate a 1% <b>click-through</b> <b>rate</b> with only 1 in 100 visitors clicking on an advertisement. At best, this assumption is slightly imprecise... at worst, it is grossly inaccurate. For example, assume that a particularly [...] "sticky" [...] site averages 11 page views per visitor and a 3% <b>click-through</b> <b>rate.</b> This means that up to 33% of the audience could {{have responded to the}} advertisement, assuming no duplicate clicks.|$|E
5000|$|Click-through {{rates for}} banner ads have {{decreased}} over time. When banner ads first started to appear, {{it was not}} uncommon to have rates above five percent. They have fallen since then, currently averaging closer to 0.2 or 0.3 percent. In most cases, a 2% <b>click-through</b> <b>rate</b> would be considered very successful, though the exact number is hotly debated and would vary depending on the situation. The average <b>click-through</b> <b>rate</b> of 3% in the 1990s declined to 2.4%-0.4% by 2002. [...] Since advertisers typically pay more for a high <b>click-through</b> <b>rate,</b> getting many click-throughs with few purchases is undesirable to advertisers. Similarly, by selecting an appropriate advertising site with high affinity (e.g., a movie magazine for a movie advertisement), the same banner can achieve a substantially higher CTR. Though personalized ads, unusual formats, and more obtrusive ads typically result in higher click-through rates than standard banner ads, overly intrusive ads are often avoided by viewers.|$|E
50|$|Most email {{marketers}} {{use this}} metrics along with open rate, bounce rate and other metrics, {{to understand the}} effectiveness and success of their email campaign. In general there is no ideal <b>click-through</b> <b>rate.</b> This metric can vary based {{on the type of}} email sent, how frequently emails are sent, how the list of recipients is segmented, how relevant the content of the email is to the audience, and many other factors. Even time of day can affect <b>click-through</b> <b>rate.</b> Sunday appears to generate considerably higher click-through rates on average when compared {{to the rest of the}} week.|$|E
40|$|We {{introduce}} {{an exploration}} scheme aimed at learning advertiser <b>click-through</b> <b>rates</b> in sponsored search auctions with minimal effect on advertiser incentives. The scheme preserves both the current ranking and pricing {{policies of the}} search engine and only introduces one parameter which controls the rate of exploration. This parameter can be set so as to allow enough exploration to learn advertiser <b>click-through</b> <b>rates</b> over time, but also eliminate incentives for advertisers to alter their currently submitted bids. When advertisers have much more information than the search engine, we show that although this goal is not achievable, incentives to deviate can be made arbitrarily small by appropriately setting the exploration rate. Given that advertisers do not alter their bids, we bound revenue loss due to exploration...|$|R

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of sponsored search advertising [...] where advertisers {{pay a fee}} to Internet search engines to be displayed alongside organic (nonsponsored) Web search results [...] is gaining ground as the largest source of revenues for search engines. Using a unique six-month panel data set of several hundred keywords collected from a large nationwide retailer that advertises on Google, we empirically model the relationship between different sponsored search metrics such as <b>click-through</b> <b>rates,</b> conversion rates, cost per click, and ranking of advertisements. Our paper proposes a novel framework {{to better understand the}} factors that drive differences in these metrics. We use a hierarchical Bayesian modeling framework and estimate the model using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. Using a simultaneous equations model, we quantify the relationship between various keyword characteristics, position of the advertisement, and the landing page quality score on consumer search and purchase behavior as well as on advertiser's cost per click and the search engine's ranking decision. Specifically, we find that the monetary value of a click is not uniform across all positions because conversion rates are highest at the top and decrease with rank as one goes down the search engine results page. Though search engines take into account the current period's bid as well as prior <b>click-through</b> <b>rates</b> before deciding the final rank of an advertisement in the current period, the current bid has a larger effect than prior <b>click-through</b> <b>rates.</b> We also find that an increase in landing page quality scores is associated with an increase in conversion rates and a decrease in advertiser's cost per click. Furthermore, our analysis shows that keywords that have more prominent positions on the search engine results page, and thus experience higher <b>click-through</b> or conversion <b>rates,</b> are not necessarily the most profitable ones [...] profits are often higher at the middle positions than at the top or the bottom ones. Besides providing managerial insights into search engine advertising, these results shed light on some key assumptions made in the theoretical modeling literature in sponsored search. online advertising, search engines, hierarchical Bayesian modeling, paid search, <b>click-through</b> <b>rates,</b> conversion rates, keyword ranking, cost per click, electronic commerce, Internet monetization...|$|R

40|$|Researchers and {{practitioners}} devote substantial effort to targeting banner advertisements to consumers, but they focus less effort {{on how to}} communicate with consumers once targeted. Morphing enables a website to learn, automatically and near optimally, which banner advertisements to serve to consumers to maximize <b>click-through</b> <b>rates,</b> brand consideration, and purchase likelihood. Banners are matched to consumers based on posterior probabilities of latent segment membership, which are identified from consumers' clickstreams. This paper describes the first large-sample random-assignment field test of banner morphing—more than 100, 000 consumers viewed more than 450, 000 banners on CNET. com. On relevant Web pages, CNET's <b>click-through</b> <b>rates</b> almost doubled relative to control banners. We supplement the CNET field test with an experiment on an automotive information-and-recommendation website. The automotive experiment replaces automated learning with a longitudinal design that implements morph-to-segment matching. Banners matched to cognitive styles, {{as well as the}} stage of the consumer's buying process and body-type preference, significantly increase <b>click-through</b> <b>rates,</b> brand consideration, and purchase likelihood relative to a control. The CNET field test and automotive experiment demonstrate that matching banners to cognitive-style segments is feasible and provides significant benefits above and beyond traditional targeting. Improved banner effectiveness has strategic implications for allocations of budgets among media. Sloan School of ManagementMassachusetts Institute of Technology.

50|$|Modern online {{advertising}} has moved beyond just using banner ads. Popular search engines allow advertisers to display ads {{in with the}} search results triggered by a search user. These ads are usually in text format and may include additional links and information like phone numbers, addresses and specific product pages.

50|$|Typically a {{large number}} of {{customers}} search for a product/service or register as page view on a referring page which is linked to the e-commerce site by a banner ad, ad network or conventional link. Only a small proportion of those seeing the advertisement or link actually click the link. The metric used to describe this ratio is the <b>click-through</b> <b>rate</b> (CTR) and represents the top level of the funnel. Typical banner and advertising click-through rates are 0.02% in late 2010 and have decreased over the past three years. Click-through rates are highly sensitive to small changes such as link text, link size, link position and many others and these effects interact cumulatively.
