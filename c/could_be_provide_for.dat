Thus, the feedback loop to operators is not fast and perhaps also not fully effective. This leads to a recommendation to provide more immediate feedback to operators via run/control charts.|$|R

Here, we focus on a multi-torrent system, and specifically on (a) what incentives <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>provided</b> <b>for</b> nodes to contribute resources as seeds in a multi-torrent environment, and (b) what are the resulting performance consequences. We show why the current BT lacks incentives for nodes to stay as seeds. Motivated by that, we propose a cross torrent based method to encourage nodes to stay as seeds and present an extensive performance study to illustrate the benefits of our approach...|$|R
