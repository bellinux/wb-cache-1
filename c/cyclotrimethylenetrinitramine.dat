RDX crystals physically coated with gold nanoparticles or recrystallised from a solution containing gold nanoparticles were tested for optical sensitisation by micro-imaging with a scanning electron microscope, and high-speed video was used to experimentally observe the enhanced laser ignitibility. The gold nanoparticles achieved effective optical sensitisation and significantly enhanced the laser ignitibility of RDX, reducing the laser ignition threshold power from more than 45 W to as little as 1 W.

40|$|The sensing and {{differentiation}} of explosive molecules is key for both security and environmental monitoring. Single fluorophores are a widely used tool for explosives detection, but a fluorescent array {{is a more}} powerful tool for detecting and differentiating such molecules. By combining array elements into a single multichannel platform, faster results {{can be obtained from}} smaller amounts of sample. Here, five explosives are detected and differentiated using quantum dots as luminescent probes in a multichannel platform: 2, 4 -dinitrotoluene (DNT), 2, 4, 6 -trinitrotoluene (TNT), tetryl (2, 4, 6 -trinitrophenylmethylnitramine), <b>cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine</b> (RDX), and pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN). The sharp, variable emissions of the quantum dots, from a single excitation wavelength, make them ideal for such a system. Each color quantum dot is functionalized with a different surface receptor via a facile ligation process. These receptors undergo nonspecific interactions with the explosives, inducing variable fluorescence quenching of the quantum dots. Pattern analysis of the fluorescence quenching data allows for explosive detection and identification with limits-of-detection in the ppb range...|$|E
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of crimes involving high explosives in Malaysia {{in recent years}} has warrant the need for the analysis of high explosives in post blast samples, particularly residues that could be found on hairs of victims.

Prior to a simulated explosion, a bundle of hair (200 strands) was tightly bound to a metal hook at each point of several pre–determined distances from the bomb seat. Hair samples containing post blast residues were extracted by ultrasonication using acetonitrile. Two analytes of interest, <b>cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine</b> (RDX) and pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) were successfully separated using gas chromatography with electron capture detector (GC–ECD) on an HP 5 –MS capillary column.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that the electronic structure of mesoporous silicon is affected by adsorption of nitro-based explosive molecules in a compound-selective manner. This selective response is demonstrated by probing the adsorption of two nitro-based molecular explosives (trinitrotoluene and <b>cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine)</b> and a nonexplosive nitro-based arematic molecule (nitrotoluene) on mesoporous silicon using soft X-ray spec- troscopy. The Si atoms strongly interact with adsorbed molecules to form Si-O and Si-N bonds, as evident from the large shifts in emission energy present in the Si L 2, 3 X-ray emission spectroscopy (XES) measurements. Furthermore, {{we find that the}} energy gap of mesoporous silicon changes depending on the adsorbant, as estimated from the Si L 2, 3 XES and 2 p X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements. Our ab initio molecular dynamics calculations of model compounds suggest that these changes are due to spontaneous breaking of the nitro groups upon contacting surface Si atoms. This compound-selective change in electronic structure may provide a powerful tool for the detection and identification of trace quantities of airborne explosive molecules.

40|$|We {{discuss the}} design and testing of a {{miniaturized}} explosives preconcentrator {{that can be used}} to enhance the capabilities of man-portable field detection systems, such as those based on ion mobility spectrometry (IMS). The preconcentrator is a smaller version of a similar device that was developed recently at Sandia National Laboratories for use in a trace detection portal that screens personnel for explosives. Like its predecessor, this preconcentrator is basically a filtering device that allows a small amount of explosive residue in a large incoming airflow to be concentrated into a much smaller air volume via adsorption and resorption, prior to delivery into a chemical detector. We discuss laboratory testing of this preconcentrator interfaced to a commercially available IMS-based detection system, with emphasis on the explosives 2, 4, 6 -trinitrotoluene (TNT) and <b>cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine</b> (RDX).

40|$|Nickel {{hydrazine}} nitrate is {{an energetic}} coordination compound having explosive properties in between that of primary and secondary. This compound {{was used to}} develop a new type of detonator by replacing the sensitive primary explosive, lead azide in conventional detonators and keeping RDX (<b>cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine)</b> as the output secondary explosive. The detonator consists of three regions, viz., initiation, deflagration-to-detonation transition (DDT), and output. The initiation and the electrical rating of 1 A/ 1 W no-fire were achieved using a suitable squib. The DDT and the output were taken care of, by pressing requisite quantities of Nickel hydrazine nitrate and RDX, respectively at required densities in a stainless steel stem channel. The detonator assembly involves crimping the squib and the stem channel in a stainless steel housing and applying a suitable resin at the crimped-end for leak tightness. The output was assessed from the dent depth on aluminium plate, volume expansion on lead block, and by achieving veloctiy of detonation of 8200 m/s in mild detonating cords, containing 0. 95 g/m of RDX, which indicates full-order detonation.

Depending on the relative initial concentrations used, concomitant electrospray crystallization of isonicotinamide and caffeine leads to encapsulated particles. Only limited encapsulation was achieved during concomitant cooling crystallization. Concomitant cooling crystallization of <b>cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine</b> (RDX) - 2, 4, 6 -trinitrotoluene (TNT) resulted in separate RDX and TNT particles. Using electrospray crystallization, spherical nano-particles were produced, for which the component distribution within the particles could not be determined.

The GNP were immobilized on a U-bend fibre optic sensor probe of 200 pin core diameter and bend diameter of 1. 5 mm for evanescent field based excitation of localized surface plasmons of the GNP. The immobilized GNP were functionalized with receptor molecules viz. 4 -mercaptobenzoic acid (4 -MBA), L-cysteine and cysteamine to provide the binding sites for the nitro-based explosive molecules. Binding of the explosive analytes to the surface moieties of the GNP was found to elicit refractive index changes in the environment surrounding the nanoparticles.

Here, preliminary results are shown which demonstrate {{the existence of an}} ILDM in a limited region of composition space for the isochoric, isothermal (T = 3000 K) combustion of RDX using a standard detailed kinetics model which accounts for 45 species and 232 elementary reaction steps; while the ILDM method has been used to simulate many problems in hydrocarbon combustion, this is thought to be the first application to systems which derive from solid explosives. The full model predicts the ratio of the time scale of the slowest reactions to those of the fastest reactions to reach values near 10 10, which indicates severe stiffness is present. The ILDM method systematically eliminates most of this stiffness by equilibrating fast time scale events and describing parametrically a low dimensional manifold upon which slow time scale events evolve. The full paper will extend the results shown here to account for adiabatic conditions, and a wider range of composition space. 2. Backgroun...|$|E

The objective was to predict thermodynamic properties for two nitrogen-rich energetic materials which are less harmful for the environment than the conventional ones, namely 3, 6 -di(hydrazino) - 1, 2, 4, 5 - tetrazine (DHT) and 3, 3 ’-azo-bis(6 -amino- 1, 2, 4, 5 -tetrazine) (DAAT) for which no experimental data are available to our best knowledge. COSMO-RS approach {{is a combination of}} quantum chemical and statistical thermodynamic basis, which allow a physically meaningful description of molecular interactions between pure molecules and solvents in solution. Recently, this approach has been used for the prediction of an enormous number of physicochemical properties especially aqueous solubility, Henry’s law constant, vapor pressure and partition coefficient. The vapor pressure of pure compounds {{is one of the most}} important thermodynamic properties required for the chemical process design as well as for the fate assessment of pollutants in the environment. To validate the accuracy of COSMO-RS approach for the two molecules of interest, six reference energetic molecules have been studied, for which experimental data are available, such as cyclotetramethylene-tetranitramine (HMX), 2, 4, 6 -trinitrotoluene (TNT), <b>cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine</b> (RDX), 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 -hexanitro- 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 -hexaazaisowurtzitane (CL- 20), 1, 1 -diamino- 2, 2 -dinitroethylene (FOX- 7) and n-methyl-p-nitroaniline (MNA). From predicted results, a good agreement has been noted. DAAT molecule shows a lower volatility in the medium so that a low detectability compared to the DHT and other reference molecules. Both DHT and DAAT showed negative logarithmic values of Octanol-Water partition coefficients, this means that they don’t have the tendency to enhance the bioaccumulation process in soils...|$|E
