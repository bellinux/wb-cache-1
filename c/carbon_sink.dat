5|$|The Moorland Indicators of Climate Change Initiative {{was set up}} in 2008 {{to collect}} data on climate change in the area. Students {{investigated}} the interaction between people and the moorlands, and their overall effect on climate change, to discover whether the moorlands are a net <b>carbon</b> <b>sink</b> or source, {{based on the fact that}} upland areas of Britain are a significant global carbon store in the form of peat. Human interaction in terms of direct erosion and fire as well as the effects of global warming are the major variables that they considered.|$|E
25|$|The oceans are {{normally}} a natural <b>carbon</b> <b>sink,</b> absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Because {{the levels of}} atmospheric carbon dioxide are increasing, the oceans are becoming more acidic.|$|E
25|$|The 'greening' of {{the continents}} {{acted as a}} <b>carbon</b> <b>sink,</b> and {{atmospheric}} levels of carbon dioxide may have dropped. This may have cooled the climate {{and led to a}} massive extinction event. See Late Devonian extinction.|$|E
40|$|The Kyoto Protocol {{established}} {{the use of}} forest <b>carbon</b> <b>sinks</b> as one way of compensating for forest ecological values. Forest <b>carbon</b> <b>sinks</b> can promote sustainable economic development and help developed nations reduce their GHG emissions. But without proper legal regulation they may influence the local ecological environment and, in particular, they may harm biodiversity. States need to make laws that regulate forest <b>carbon</b> <b>sinks</b> and protect biodiversity. Environmental law urgently needs {{to strike a balance}} between forest <b>carbon</b> <b>sinks</b> and biodiversity conservation. Carbon farming and protecting the biodiversity can be regulated through three legislative stages: previous control, process control and subsequent action. In the first stage, the environmental impact of carbon farming can be assessed and any effect on the biodiversity determined. In the second stage, legislation has to provide tools to supervise the dynamic effects of forest <b>carbon</b> <b>sinks</b> on biodiversity. And in the third stage, some sort of mechanism to sanction the destruction of biodiversity must be established...|$|R

25|$|The {{effect of}} {{plastics}} {{on global warming}} is mixed. Plastics are generally made from petroleum. If the plastic is incinerated, it increases carbon emissions; if it is placed in a landfill, it becomes a <b>carbon</b> <b>sink</b> although biodegradable plastics have caused methane emissions.|$|E
25|$|Oceans are {{at present}} CO2 sinks, and {{represent}} the largest active <b>carbon</b> <b>sink</b> on Earth, absorbing {{more than a quarter}} of the carbon dioxide that humans put into the air. The solubility pump is the primary mechanism responsible for the CO2 absorption by the oceans.|$|E
25|$|Because {{of their}} smaller size and {{relatively}} faster growth rates, {{and because they}} are more evenly distributed throughout more of the world's oceans, copepods almost certainly contribute far more to the secondary productivity of the world's oceans, and to the global ocean <b>carbon</b> <b>sink</b> than krill, and perhaps more than all other groups of organisms together. The surface layers of the oceans are currently believed to be the world's largest <b>carbon</b> <b>sink,</b> absorbing about 2 billion tons of carbon a year, the equivalent to perhaps a third of human carbon emissions, thus reducing their impact. Many planktonic copepods feed near the surface at night, then sink (by changing oils into more dense fats) into deeper water during the day to avoid visual predators. Their moulted exoskeletons, faecal pellets, and respiration at depth all bring carbon to the deep sea.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: With {{the strict}} {{emissions}} control of greenhouse gases, the carbon source enterprises {{have to make}} a choice among the self-energy conservation to reduce emission,allocation of emission right among enterprises and the purchase of forest <b>carbon</b> <b>sinks.</b> To implant forest <b>carbon</b> <b>sinks</b> to the <b>carbon</b> emission trading system, the carbon source enterprises with higher cost of emission reduction can undertake their corresponding emission reduction responsibility and reduce the emission cost, and the carbon source enterprises with lower cost of carbon emission reduction and the suppliers of forest <b>carbon</b> <b>sinks</b> can obtain the corresponding economic benefits. So the value compensation of forest ecological benefit can realized by market, which is beneficial to regulating the carbon emission behavior of carbon source enterprises, and encourages the carbon neutral behavior of forest <b>carbon</b> <b>sinks,</b> and promote the coordination and coupling of economic development and environmental protection...|$|R

25|$|According to a 2016 {{study from}} the Pacific Institute for Climate Solutions rising levels of Carbon Dioxide may cancel out the pine beetle impact in British Columbia by 2020.

25|$|Planktonic copepods are {{important}} to the carbon cycle. Some scientists say they form the largest animal biomass on earth. They compete for this title with Antarctic krill. Because of their smaller size and relatively faster growth rates, however, and because they are more evenly distributed throughout more of the world's oceans, copepods almost certainly contribute far more to the secondary productivity of the world's oceans, and to the global ocean <b>carbon</b> <b>sink</b> than krill, and perhaps more than all other groups of organisms together.

25|$|Several serpentinite {{deposits}} {{are being}} investigated as potentially large scale CO2 storage sinks {{such as those}} found in NSW, Australia, where the first mineral carbonation pilot plant project is underway. Beneficial re-use of magnesium carbonate from this process could provide feedstock for new products developed for the built environment and agriculture without returning the carbon into the atmosphere and so acting as a <b>carbon</b> <b>sink.</b>|$|E
25|$|There are {{substantial}} uncertainties {{in the measurement}} of net carbon emissions. Additionally, there is controversy over how <b>carbon</b> <b>sinks</b> should be allocated between different regions and over time (Banuri et al., 1996, p.93). For instance, concentrating on more recent changes in <b>carbon</b> <b>sinks</b> is likely to favour those regions that have deforested earlier, e.g., Europe.|$|R

25|$|Another {{concern is}} that about {{one third of the}} world's soil-bound carbon is in taiga and tundra areas. When the {{permafrost}} melts, it releases carbon in the form of carbon dioxide and methane, both of which are greenhouse gases. The effect has been observed in Alaska. In the 1970s the tundra was a <b>carbon</b> <b>sink,</b> but today, it is a carbon source. Methane is produced when vegetation decays in lakes and wetlands.|$|E
25|$|Oceans {{and coastal}} {{ecosystems}} {{play an important}} role in the global carbon cycle and have removed about 25% of the carbon dioxide emitted by human activities between 2000 and 2007 and about half the anthropogenic CO2 released since the start of the industrial revolution. Rising ocean temperatures and ocean acidification means that the capacity of the ocean <b>carbon</b> <b>sink</b> will gradually get weaker, giving rise to global concerns expressed in the Monaco and Manado Declarations.|$|E
25|$|In March 1995, Environment Minister Simon Upton in Decision of Hon Simon Upton, Minister for the Environment, Air Discharge Permit Taranaki Combined Cycle Power Station (Wellington, Ministry for the Environment, March 1995) {{accepted}} {{the bulk of}} the board's report and approved the resource consents. Upton made the conditions requiring carbon sequestration more flexible. The offsetting condition would only apply when electricity sector carbon dioxide emissions exceeded the volume emitted when the plant was commissioned. The offsetting condition allowed for either forests to create a <b>carbon</b> <b>sink</b> or greater efficiency elsewhere.|$|E
2500|$|Land-use change, e.g., the {{clearing}} of forests for agricultural use, {{can affect the}} concentration of GHGs in the atmosphere by altering how much carbon flows out of the atmosphere into <b>carbon</b> <b>sinks.</b> Accounting for land-use change {{can be understood as}} an attempt to measure [...] "net" [...] emissions, i.e., gross emissions from all GHG sources minus the removal of emissions from the atmosphere by <b>carbon</b> <b>sinks</b> (Banuri et al., 1996, pp.92–93).|$|R

25|$|A <b>carbon</b> <b>sink</b> is {{a natural}} or {{artificial}} reservoir that accumulates and stores some carbon-containing chemical compound for an indefinite period, such as a growing forest. A negative carbon dioxide emission {{on the other hand}} is a permanent removal of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. Examples are direct air capture, enhanced weathering technologies such as storing it in geologic formations underground and biochar. These processes are sometimes considered as variations of sinks or mitigation, and sometimes as geoengineering. In combination with other mitigation measures, sinks in combination with negative carbon emissions are considered crucial for meeting the 350 ppm target.|$|E
25|$|Together, the Subantarctic Mode Water (SAMW) and Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) {{act as a}} <b>carbon</b> <b>sink,</b> {{absorbing}} atmospheric {{carbon dioxide}} and storing it in solution. If the SAMW temperature increases {{as a result of}} climate change, the SAMW will have less capacity to store dissolved carbon dioxide. Research using a computerized climate system model suggests that if atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration were to increase to 860 ppm by the year 2100 (roughly double today's concentration), the SAMW will decrease in density and salinity. The resulting reductions in the subduction and transport capacity of SAMW and AAIW water masses could potentially decrease the absorption and storage of CO2 in the Southern Ocean.|$|E
25|$|Current {{agricultural}} practices lead to carbon loss from soils. It {{has been suggested}} that improved farming practices could return the soils to being a <b>carbon</b> <b>sink.</b> Present worldwide practises of overgrazing are substantially reducing many grasslands' performance as carbon sinks. The Rodale Institute says that regenerative agriculture, if practiced on the planet’s 3.6 billion tillable acres, could sequester up to 40% of current CO2 emissions. They claim that agricultural carbon sequestration has the potential to mitigate global warming. When using biologically based regenerative practices, this dramatic benefit can be accomplished with no decrease in yields or farmer profits. Organically managed soils can convert carbon dioxide from a greenhouse gas into a food-producing asset.|$|E
40|$|Summary: Carbon dioxide {{is being}} {{released}} into the atmosphere nearly {{twice as fast as}} it is removed by Earth 2 ̆ 7 s <b>carbon</b> <b>sinks,</b> like forests and oceans.   Think of it as a bath tub overflowing. To get atmospheric carbon levels back to manageable levels we not only need to turn off the tap by reducing emissions but also pull the plug by boosting our <b>carbon</b> <b>sinks.</b> We need to find ways to remove that excess carbon from the air. This snapshot explores some key technologies that could move us below zero emissions...|$|R
50|$|Mitigation {{of climate}} change are actions to reduce {{greenhouse}} gas emissions, or enhance the capacity of <b>carbon</b> <b>sinks</b> to absorb GHGs from the atmosphere. There is a large potential for future reductions in emissions {{by a combination of}} activities, including energy conservation and increased energy efficiency; the use of low-carbon energy technologies, such as renewable energy, nuclear energy, and carbon capture and storage; and enhancing <b>carbon</b> <b>sinks</b> through, for example, reforestation and preventing deforestation.A 2015 report by Citibank concluded that transitioning to a low carbon economy would yield positive return on investments.|$|R

25|$|A {{recent report}} by the Australian CSIRO found that {{forestry}} and forest-related options are the most significant and most easily achieved <b>carbon</b> <b>sink</b> making up 105 Mt per year CO2-e or about 75 per cent of the total figure attainable for the Australian state of Queensland from 2010-2050. Among the forestry options, the CSIRO report announced, forestry with the primary aim of carbon storage (called carbon forestry) clearly has the highest attainable carbon storage capacity (77 Mt CO2-e/yr) {{and is one of the}} easiest options to implement compared with biodiversity plantings, pre-1990 eucalypts, post 1990 plantations and managed regrowth. Legal strategies to encourage this form of biosequestration include permanent protection of forests in National Parks or on the World Heritage List, properly funded management and bans on use of rainforest timbers and inefficient uses such as woodchipping old growth forest.|$|E
25|$|In December 2007, after {{a two-year}} debate on a {{proposal}} from Papua New Guinea and Costa Rica, state parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC) agreed to explore ways of reducing emissions from deforestation and to enhance forest carbon stocks in developing nations. The underlying idea is that developing nations should be financially compensated if they succeed in reducing their levels of deforestation (through valuing the carbon that is stored in forests); a concept termed 'avoided deforestation (AD) or, REDD if broadened to include reducing forest degradation (see Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation). Under the free market model advocated by the countries who have formed the Coalition of Rainforest Nations, developing nations with rainforests would sell <b>carbon</b> <b>sink</b> credits under a free market system to Kyoto Protocol Annex I states who have exceeded their emissions allowance. Brazil (the state with the largest area of tropical rainforest) however, opposes including avoided deforestation in a carbon trading mechanism and instead favors creation of a multilateral development assistance fund created from donations by developed states. For REDD to be successful science and regulatory infrastructure related to forests will need to increase so nations may inventory all their forest carbon, show that they can control land use {{at the local level}} and prove that their emissions are declining.|$|E
500|$|Eriophorum angustifolium is {{the most}} common of the four native species of Eriophorum in the British Isles, and has been {{recorded}} as having existed in all vice-counties, thriving particularly well in Ireland and northern and western regions of Great Britain, but less so in southern and eastern areas. In the mires of Northern Ireland and the South Pennines, it considered a ruderal, pioneer and keystone species, because it can quickly colonise and repair damaged or eroded peat, encourage the re-vegetation of its surroundings, and retain sediment and its landscape to serve as a <b>carbon</b> <b>sink.</b> In central and southern counties of England, the species is rare or absent, and was [...] "completely destroyed" [...] in Cambridgeshire, The Broads, The Fens {{and other parts of the}} East of England by human activities such as land reclamation.
