50|$|Adding the <b>user</b> <b>agent’s</b> contact {{information}} to the registered {{contact information}} has many advantages. As the SBC {{does not have to}} keep local registration information this solution is simple to implement and does not require memory for keeping the information. Further, requests destined to the <b>user</b> <b>agent</b> do not necessarily have to traverse the SBC that has processed the <b>user</b> <b>agent’s</b> registration messages. Any SBC that can reach the <b>user</b> <b>agent</b> can correctly route messages destined to the <b>user</b> <b>agent</b> based on the information included in the SIP request. This advantage applies, however, only in some cases. In case the NAT used in front of the <b>user</b> <b>agent</b> accepts traffic only from the IP addresses which the <b>user</b> <b>agent</b> has contacted previously then only the SBC that has processed the <b>user</b> <b>agent’s</b> REGISTER requests will be able to contact the <b>user</b> <b>agent.</b>|$|R
40|$|Cooperative {{transmission}} {{has been}} of growing interest recently where users take advantage of each other's resources for better overall performance. In this paper, coded cooperation for wireless networks is considered and a novel cooperative concatenated coding strategy is proposed. In contrast to previous works, this scheme features additional coding benefits other than spatial diversity. Specifically, we show that remarkable error rate reduction can be achieved even when the receive SNR of all <b>cooperating</b> <b>users</b> is maintained at a specific level. The idea of interleaver gain of concatenated codes is exploited and it is shown that the error rate decreases dramatically {{with the number of}} cooperating nodes. Multiple <b>cooperating</b> <b>users</b> with unequal message sizes can also be supported easily and a reduced-complexity cooperative encoding structure is provided for good inter-user channels. Code design criteria are also investigated, as well as, the performance under various data-block sizes and number of <b>cooperating</b> <b>users...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract Despite the {{popularity}} of watching videos online, challenges still remain in video streaming in many scenarios. Limited home broadband and mobile phone 3 G bandwidths mean many users stream videos at compromised quality. To provide additional bandwidth for streaming, we propose CStream, a system that aggregates bandwidth from multiple <b>cooperating</b> <b>users</b> in a neighborhood environment for better video streaming. CStream exploits the fact that wireless devices have multiple network interfaces and connects <b>cooperating</b> <b>users</b> with a wireless ad-hoc network to aggregate their unused downlink Inter-net bandwidth. CStream dynamically generates a streaming plan to stream a single video using multiple connections, continuously adapting {{to changes in the}} neighborhood and variations in the available band-width. CStream is developed and evaluated on a test bed of computers, allowing for a detailed, controlled evaluation of performance. Analysis of the results shows a linear increase in throughput over single-connection streaming and improved video quality as the number of <b>cooperating</b> <b>users</b> in a neighborhood increase.
