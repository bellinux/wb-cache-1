5|$|After {{visiting his}} ancestral home in Suzhou, Pei created a design {{based on some}} simple but nuanced {{techniques}} he admired in traditional residential Chinese buildings.

Pei's design included a large central atrium covered by glass panels that functioned much like the large central space in his East Building of the National Gallery. Openings of various shapes in walls invited guests to view the natural scenery beyond. Younger Chinese who had hoped the building would exhibit some of Cubist flavor for which Pei had become known were disappointed, but the new hotel found more favour with government officials and architects.|$|E
5|$|At the 1872 Democratic National Convention, Stevenson {{received}} {{the votes of}} Delaware's six delegates for the Democratic vice-presidential nomination, although Benjamin Gratz Brown was ultimately nominated.

Patterson's involvement in the Crédit Mobilier of America scandal. Stevenson and fellow Senator John P. Stockton of New Jersey both asked to be removed from the commission, but the Senate refused to grant their request. On February 27, 1873, the commission recommended Patterson's expulsion from the Senate, but the chamber adjourned on March 4 without acting on the recommendation.

5|$|How the Phylloxera aphid was {{introduced}} to Europe remains debated: American vines had been taken to Europe many times before, for reasons including experimentation and trials in grafting, without <b>consideration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> possibility of the introduction of pestilence. While the Phylloxera was thought to have arrived around 1858, it was first recorded in France in 1863, near the former province of Languedoc. It is argued by some that the introduction of such pests as phylloxera was only a problem after the invention of steamships, which allowed a faster journey across the ocean, and consequently allowed durable pests, such as the Phylloxera, to survive the trip.|$|E
5|$|On 26 February 1793, another vote {{to abolish}} the slave trade was {{narrowly}} defeated by eight votes. The outbreak of war with France the same month effectively prevented any further serious <b>consideration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> issue, as politicians concentrated on the national crisis {{and the threat of}} invasion. The same year, and again in 1794, Wilberforce unsuccessfully brought before Parliament a bill to outlaw British ships from supplying slaves to foreign colonies. He voiced his concern about the war and urged Pitt and his government to make greater efforts to end hostilities. Growing more alarmed, on 31 December 1794, Wilberforce moved that the government seek a peaceful resolution with France, a stance that created a temporary breach in his long friendship with Pitt.|$|E

5|$|Scholastic {{investigation}} of Vithoba's history often begins with <b>consideration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dating {{of the chief}} temple at Pandharpur, which {{is believed to be}} the earliest Vithoba temple. The oldest part of the temple dates to the Yadava period of the 12th and 13thcenturies. Most of the temple is believed to have been built in the 17thcentury, though addition to the temple has never ceased. The date the temple was first established is unclear to Bhandarkar, but he insists there is clear evidence to suggest it existed by the 13thcentury. According to S. G. Tulpule, the temple stood as early as 1189. In fact, a monument dated 1189 records establishment of a small Vithoba shrine at the present location of the temple; thus, Tulpule concludes, the worship of Vithoba predates 1189.|$|E
5|$|The 1989 {{amendments}} to the ISA were challenged before the High Court in Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs (1989).

Therefore, applying the subjective test, the respondents' burden of justifying the legality of the applicant's detention was discharged as the respondents had produced a valid detention order and evidence of the subjective satisfaction of the President, acting on the advice of the Cabinet, that the applicant was a risk to national security.|$|E

Kvale had the Senate-passed bill substituted for the one he had introduced, and it received the House's endorsement without objection or amendment. It was passed into law with the signature of President Calvin Coolidge on March 2, 1925.|$|E
