50|$|<b>Cuniculidae</b> (pacas). One genus and two species.|$|E
5000|$|A paca is {{a member}} of the genus Cuniculus of ground-dwelling, herbivorous rodents in South and Central America. It is the only genus in the family <b>Cuniculidae.</b> [...] They are large rodents with dots and stripes on their sides, short ears, and barely visible tails. They are also {{referred}} to as [...] "gibnuts" [...] or [...] "royal rats".|$|E
50|$|The {{pacarana}} is {{the sole}} extant member of the rodent family Dinomyidae in the infraorder Caviomorpha; the paca that it resembles in appearance is in a different Caviomorph family, the <b>Cuniculidae.</b> Initially, the pacarana {{was regarded as a}} member of the superfamily Muroidea, that includes the true mice, but that view was abandoned in the face of evidence that suggests that the pacarana is in the family Dinomyidae together with extinct animals such as Phoberomys pattersoni and Josephoartigasia monesi, prehistoric giant rodents that lived in South America several million years ago.|$|E
50|$|There is much {{confusion}} in the nomenclature of this and related species; see agouti. In particular, the popular term agouti or common agouti normally refers to species of the distinct Dasyprocta genus (such as the Central American agouti, Dasyprocta punctata). Sometimes the word agouti is also used for a polyphyletic grouping uniting the families <b>Cuniculidae</b> and Dasyproctidae, which, besides the pacas and common agoutis, includes also the acouchis (Myoprocta). Cuniculus is the appropriate genus name instead of Agouti based on a 1998 ruling of the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature as the Lowland Paca's genus.|$|E

40|$|Cuniculus paca (Mammalia: <b>Cuniculidae),</b> or ‘paca’ is a rodent {{species in}} great demand for its meat, {{which has led}} to {{domestication}} and development of paca farms in the Brazilian Amazon region, as well as in other states. Despite the growing consumption of paca meat, knowledge on muscle anatomy is still scarce. An anatomical description of paca forelimbs will form the basis for future zootechnical and veterinary studies, enabling the development of sustainable production in the Amazon region, as well as the preservation of the species. We studied forelimb anatomy in four (04) adult pacas from the Caboclinho Project of Catuaba Experimental Farm (UFAC) under IBAMA authorization n° 509309. Specimens were fixed in 10 % formalin and thoracic limbs were dissected, after which anatomical descriptions and photographic records were generated. We found that paca forelimb musculature {{is similar to that of}} other groups of domestic animals with regard to the origin and muscle insertion...|$|E
40|$|Abstract We updated the {{checklist}} of mammals from Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil based on primary records only. One hundred and sixty-six mammal species were listed as {{occurring in the}} state, 47 of them being medium to large, 47 small mammal and 73 bat species. The listed species are distributed in 31 families: Didelphidae (17 spp.), Dasypodidae (7 spp.), Myrmecophagidae (2 spp.), Cebidae (1 sp.), Callithrichidae (2 spp.), Aotidae (1 sp.), Pitheciidae (1 sp.), Atelidae (1 sp.), Leporidae (1 sp.), Felidae (7 spp.), Canidae (4 spp.), Mustelidae (5 spp.), Mephitidae (2 spp.), Procyonidae (2 spp.), Tapiridae (1 sp.), Tayassuidae (2 spp.), Cervidae (4 spp.), Sciuridae (1 sp.), Cricetidae (22 spp.), Erethizontidae (1 sp.), Caviidae (3 spp.), Dasyproctidae (1 sp.), <b>Cuniculidae</b> (1 sp.), Echimyidae (4 spp.), Phyllostomidae (41 spp.), Emballonuridae (2 spp.), Molossidae (16 spp.), Vespertilionidae (9 spp.), Mormoopidae (1 sp.), Noctilionidae (2 spp.), and Natalidade (1 sp.). These numbers represent an increase of fourteen species with primary records for the state {{in comparison with the}} previously published checklist. However, it is evident the scarcity of information at several regions of the state, and the need of implementation of regional zoological collections. The state of Mato Grosso do Sul represent only 4. 19 % of the Brazilian territory, but the number of mammal species reach 24. 13 % of the known species occurring in the country...|$|E
40|$|Spotted paca (Cuniculus paca) is a rodent {{species from}} the family <b>Cuniculidae,</b> found in South America, from the Orinoco River Basin to Paraguay. Although widely studied with regard to its {{morphological}} and reproductive aspects, still there’re no records on the morphology of the male reproductive system in this species. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate not only the macro and microscopic anatomy of the external genital organs in this species, but also their topography. We studied the external genital organs of 10 adult spotted pacas; 5 specimens, fixed in a 10 % aqueous formaldehyde solution, were macroscopically studied and from 5 specimens we collected fragments from the reproductive system, for microscopic analysis. The testicles showed a parenchyma structured in seminiferous tubules and the germinal epithelium rested on its basal membrane. These organs were located in the abdominal cavity, the inguinal path, or within the scrotum. Penis, fibroelastic, was located in the pubic region, in caudal direction. Its glans, coated by keratinized epithelium, were covered by the prepuce and, below this, we identified a slender cartilaginous structure with serrated edges. A couple of bone spurs was located into a bag ventral to the urethra, whose mucosa was lined by transitional epithelium. The epididymal duct was balled up in the head, had a body and tail, and its head was lined by pseudo-stratified stereociliated epithelium, and the tail by simple cubic epithelium; from this, the deferent duct stemmed, lined by columnar stratified epithelium...|$|E
40|$|Due {{to their}} flexibility, sutures are regions that {{experience}} greater strains than the surrounding rigid cranial bones. Cranial sutures {{differ in their}} degree of interdigitation or complexity. There is evidence indicating that a more convoluted suture better enables the absorption of high stresses coming from dynamic masticatory forces, and other functions. The Order Rodentia is an interesting clade to study this because of its taxa with diverse chewing modes. Due to repeated loading resulting from gnawing and grinding, energy absorption by the sutures might be a crucial factor in these mammals. Species within the infraorder Caviomorpha were chosen {{as a case study}} because of their ecomorphological and dietary diversity. This study compared five sutures from the rostrum and cranial vault across seven caviomorph families, and assessed their complexity by means of the relative length and fractal dimension. Across these rodents, cranial sutures are morphologically quite diverse. We found that the sutures connecting the rostrum with the vault were relatively more interdigitated than those in the cranial vault itself, especially premaxillofrontal sutures. Suture interdigitation was higher in species that display chisel-tooth digging and burrowing behaviors, especially in the families Ctenomyidae and Octodontidae, than those in families Dasyproctidae and <b>Cuniculidae,</b> which have more gracile masticatory systems. The reconstruction of the ancestral character state, on family and species phylogeny, points toward low suture interdigitation (i. e., low length ratio) as a likely ancestral state for interfrontal, premaxillofrontal and maxillofrontal sutures. Interspecific differences in suture morphology shown here might represent adaptations to different mechanical demands (i. e., soft vs. tough foods) or behaviors (e. g., chisel-tooth digging), which evolved in close association with the diverse environments occupied by caviomorph rodents...|$|E
