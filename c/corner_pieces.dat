25|$|The Shoo Fly {{varies from}} the Nine Patch by {{dividing}} {{each of the}} four <b>corner</b> <b>pieces</b> into a light and dark triangle.|$|E
25|$|There are six central pieces {{which show}} one {{coloured}} face, twelve edge pieces which show two coloured faces, and eight <b>corner</b> <b>pieces</b> which show three coloured faces. Each piece shows a unique colour combination, {{but not all}} combinations are present (for example, if red and orange are {{on opposite sides of}} the solved Cube, there is no edge piece with both red and orange sides). The location of these cubes relative to one another can be altered by twisting an outer third of the Cube 90°, 180° or 270°, but the location of the coloured sides relative to one another in the completed state of the puzzle cannot be altered: it is fixed by the relative positions of the centre squares. However, Cubes with alternative colour arrangements also exist; for example, with the yellow face opposite the green, the blue face opposite the white, and red and orange remaining opposite each other.|$|E
50|$|The Tuttminx has a {{total of}} 32 face centre pieces (12 {{pentagon}} and 20 hexagon), 60 <b>corner</b> <b>pieces</b> and 90 edge pieces. The face centres each have a single colour, which identifies the colour of that face in the solved state. The edge pieces have two colours and the <b>corner</b> <b>pieces</b> have three colours. Each hexagonal face contains a centre piece, 6 <b>corner</b> <b>pieces</b> and 6 edge pieces, while each pentagonal face contains a centre piece, 5 <b>corner</b> <b>pieces</b> and 5 edge pieces.|$|E

50|$|Mathematically speaking, {{however, the}} Skewb Ultimate has {{exactly the same}} {{structure}} as the Skewb Diamond. The solution for the Skewb Diamond {{can be used to}} solve this puzzle, by identifying the Diamond's face pieces with the Ultimate's <b>corner</b> <b>pieces,</b> and the Diamond's <b>corner</b> <b>pieces</b> with the Ultimate's edge pieces. The only additional trick here is that the Ultimate's <b>corner</b> <b>pieces</b> (equivalent to the Diamond's face pieces) are sensitive to orientation, and so may require an additional algorithm for orienting them after being correctly placed.|$|E

5000|$|The puzzle can {{be thought}} of as {{twisting}} around its <b>corner</b> <b>pieces</b> - each twist rotates one corner piece and permutates the three face centre pieces around it. An interesting feature is that the face centre pieces go [...] "underneath" [...] <b>corner</b> <b>pieces</b> during a twist.|$|E

50|$|The Pyraminx Duo is {{a puzzle}} {{in the shape}} of a tetrahedron, divided into 4 <b>corner</b> <b>pieces</b> and 4 face centre pieces.

50|$|The Megaminx {{is made in}} {{the shape}} of a dodecahedron, and has 12 face center pieces, 20 <b>corner</b> <b>pieces,</b> and 30 edge pieces.

Each face contains a center piece, 5 <b>corner</b> <b>pieces</b> and 5 edge pieces. The corner and edge pieces are shared with adjacent faces. The face centers can only rotate in place, but the other pieces can be permuted by twisting the face layer around the face center.|$|E

40|$|The {{secondary}} mirror is a circular disc {{provided with a}} shoulder. Three clamps located 120 deg apart support the mirror shoulder. On {{one side of the}} mirror shoulder, a coated graphite-epoxy ring connects the three clamps. Three axial flexures with a low radial compliance extend out from a support platform constructed of coated graphite-epoxy box structs and invar corners, and provide a nominal in-plane zero coefficient of thermal expansion. In each invar <b>corner</b> <b>piece,</b> a ball joint provides a connection to a expansion. In each invar <b>corner</b> <b>piece,</b> a ball joint provides a connection to a six-degree-of-freedom adjustment system that can move the {{secondary mirror}} {{with a high degree of}} precision in defocus, decenter, and tilt. Thermal controls that maintain structural-element temperature variations within specified limits insure that the assembly exceeds stability and figure control requirements on the secondary mirror...|$|R

5000|$|Despite its appearance, {{the puzzle}} {{is in fact}} {{equivalent}} to a shape modification of the original 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube. Its 4 <b>corner</b> <b>pieces</b> on the corners and 4 <b>corner</b> <b>pieces</b> on the face centers together are equivalent to the 8 <b>corner</b> <b>pieces</b> of the Rubik's Cube, its 6 edge pieces are equivalent to the face centers of the Rubik's Cube, and its non-center face pieces are equivalent to the edge pieces of the Rubik's Cube. Thus, the same methods used to solve the Rubik's Cube {{may be used to}} solve the Master Pyramorphix, with a few minor differences: the center pieces are sensitive to orientation because they have two colors, unlike the usual coloring scheme used for the Rubik's Cube, and the face centers are not sensitive to orientation (however when in the [...] "wrong" [...] orientation parity errors may occur). In effect, it behaves as a Rubik's Cube with a non-standard coloring scheme where center piece orientation matters, and the orientation of 4 of the 8 <b>corner</b> <b>pieces</b> do not, technically, matter.|$|E

50|$|The puzzle {{consists}} of 4 <b>corner</b> <b>pieces,</b> 4 edge pieces and 1 centre piece. Each corner piece has four colours each, each edge piece has three colours each, while the centre piece has two colours (on the opposite faces). The puzzle {{can be thought}} of as twisting around its edge pieces - each twist causes one edge piece to rotate 180° in place, and the two adjacent <b>corner</b> <b>pieces</b> to swap positions (while also being rotated).|$|E

50|$|Mechanically, {{the puzzle}} {{is similar to}} the Skewb, with all <b>corner</b> <b>pieces</b> of the Skewb visible (although shaped differently) and all centre pieces hidden.|$|E
50|$|The puzzle has 150 movable pieces: 60 <b>corner</b> <b>pieces,</b> 60 edge {{pieces that}} are {{adjacent}} to a pentagonal face (so-called pentagonal edges) and 30 edge pieces that are not (non-pentagonal edges). Only even permutations of all three types of pieces are possible (i.e. {{it is impossible to}} have only one pair of identical pieces swapped). Thus, there are 60!/2 possible ways to arrange the <b>corner</b> <b>pieces,</b> 60!/2 ways to arrange the pentagonal edges and 30!/2 ways to arrange the non-pentagonal edges.|$|E
50|$|The word is a {{variation}} of scantillon, a carpenter's or stonemason's measuring tool, also used of the measurements taken by it, and {{of a piece of}} timber of small size cut as a sample. Sometimes synonymous with story pole. The Old French escantillon, mod. échantillon, is usually taken to be related to Italian scandaglio, sounding-line (Latin scandere, to climb; cf. scansio, the metrical scansion). It was probably influenced by cantel, cantle, a small <b>piece,</b> a <b>corner</b> <b>piece.</b>|$|R

5000|$|There is also {{a subtle}} {{difference}} between the original version of the puzzle and the version mass-produced by other companies. The original puzzle has an internal mechanism which prevents an isolated edge piece from turning - i.e. an edge piece may only twist if {{there is at least}} one <b>corner</b> <b>piece</b> adjacent to it. The mass-produced version does not feature this mechanism, which allows edge pieces to twist [...] "on their own" [...] - causing the puzzle to be considerably easier.|$|R
