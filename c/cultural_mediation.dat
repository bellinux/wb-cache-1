Utilizing Nisei Week's cultural environment, by centering it {{in the heart of}} Little Tokyo and holding cultural events, Issei hoped to bring Nisei back into the cultural fold of the older generation. Issei also hoped for Nisei to become brokers between Little Tokyo and the dominant society around it. The creation of the Nisei Week Queen, one year after the first Nisei Week in 1935, may be seen as the epitome of <b>cultural</b> <b>mediation</b> and broker between the Japanese community and white America. Mike Haigwara, Nisei Week's 2007 Street Arts and Carnival director, attributes Nisei Week with helping foster Japanese American identity and self-esteem.|$|E

40|$|The {{relationship}} between culture and mass media has received much attention among communication scholars in Latin America, {{especially during the}} 1980 s and 1990 s. This period witnessed a shift from understanding culture and mass communication as domination, to {{an exploration of the}} complex and politically nuanced roles played by the mass media within the cultural and political fabrics of the region. As such, the ideological and deterministic moorings of the old debates were considerably softened, as writers such as Martín-Barbero redefined the media in terms of <b>cultural</b> <b>mediations.</b> From this perspective, <b>cultural</b> <b>mediations</b> shape the manner in which subjects articulate their relationship to modernity.

40|$|We live in {{a context}} of borders that are {{dissolving}} in many senses, of the convergence and hybridisation of technologies, mass media and cultures. The context is the resizing of practical time, of movements and links between the local and the global. In these times of interculturality, communication plays a very important role; not so much in its technological media dimension, but particularly in the dynamics of <b>cultural</b> <b>mediations</b> that are dividing off from mediatised relations. This article aims to reflect on the transformations in present-day communication processes, marked by strong movements of hybridisation, as well as examining how to consider interculturality in the context of <b>cultural</b> <b>mediations,</b> based on dialogue between Latin American and French authors. Also, using media material, the article presents illustrations of the Brazilian cultural scene, which is marked by a long history of hybridisation that is filled with intercultural dynamics...|$|R

We particularly focus on: i. the creation of the presentation fulcrum, ii. the construction of a presentation, iii. the implementation of an ―intelligent‖ module that offers contextualized assistance, able to expand and adapt a presentation to different reception expectations and iv. the indexing/research module.

40|$|This essay {{examines}} some of {{the contours}} of new documentary {{and its relationship to}} war, first characterizing historical and theoretical frameworks while considering the social and spectatorial impact of moving images that have engaged with war themes and imagery. The focus falls on new documentary and representations of the war in Iraq, asking if these <b>cultural</b> <b>mediations</b> of war might indicate shades of an Iraq syndrome in the making. Finally, a close reading of Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9 / 11 considers the film in light of social and representational issues facing new documentary, marking the film's postmodernist and surrealist tendencies. I argue that Moore?s film ends up projecting ambiguous and perhaps self-contradictory conclusions about the US reliance on war as a mechanism for advancing its global social, ideological, and economic agendas. At the same time, the film manages to capture elements of the heterogeneity and instability of Americans' own national and patriotic self-perceptions...|$|R
40|$|This article {{demonstrates}} that the Profumo affair, which obsessed Britain for large parts of 1963, {{was not simply a}} political scandal, but was also an important cultural event. Focussing on the production of The Keeler Affair, a feature film that figured prominently in contemporary coverage of the scandal but which has been largely overlooked since, the article shows that this film emerged from a situation in which cultural entrepreneurs, many of them associated with the satire boom, sought to exploit the scandal for financial gain. Many Profumo-related cultural products found an audience, and thus formed an integral part of, and helped to shape public attitudes towards, the Profumo affair. However, these products did not go uncontested, and resistance to them, and especially to the idea that Keeler might benefit materially from her role in the scandal, speak to concerns about <b>cultural</b> <b>mediations</b> of sex, politics and humour in early- 1960 s Britain...|$|R

40|$|This {{article focuses}} {{on the use of}} Bach’s Goldberg Variations in Christopher Münch’s The Hours and Times (1991), a {{pioneering}} example of New Queer Cinema that takes as its subject matter a trip made by John Lennon and Brian Epstein to Barcelona, infusing it with homoerotic overtones. I unpick the particular <b>cultural</b> <b>mediations</b> at work in this strange assemblage of eighteenth-century keyboard music, 1960 s rock icons, and late twentieth-century identity politics. This leads me to explore Glenn Gould’s post-war popularization of the Goldberg, a metaphorical connection between Bach’s music and Barcelona’s distinctive architecture, and, first and foremost, the emergence of the ‘act of listening to Bach’ as a trope in Ingmar Bergman’s cinema. I show how Münch draws on Bach, and particularly on Bergman’s use of the Goldberg Variations in The Silence (1963), to provide a reading of the Beatles’ story that attempts {{to be sensitive to the}} elusiveness of time and gender...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{present in}} this paper a system able to {{construct}} multiple educational and <b>cultural</b> <b>mediations.</b> This system {{is based on a}} particular approach of the mediation, seen as a special case of interpretation. In the first part we discuss the very concept of mediation, where we see a hermeneutical procedure of accessing cultural topics. The <b>cultural</b> and educational <b>mediation</b> is understood as assistance in reading, interpreting and finally understanding a topic belonging to some artistic, scientific and technical heritage. We show that what is important in mediation is to (learn to) make sense of what we see/read. In the second part we argue that mediation could not (and should not) be the same for all. We argue that it is possible, from a technical point of view, to overcome the constraint of a public considered as a homogeneous learning mass and {{to take into account the}} diversity of profiles, practices, goals and expectations. In the third part we present the basic features of the developed system, in terms of conceptualization and design. We also mention the key elements of the underlying knowledge organization and specify the notions of "learning profile", "point of view", and "knowledge depth levels". We also present the principle of path construction and path coherence. Finally, we conclude with an application example, where we show the adaptability of the system, in terms of content, layout and architecture...|$|R
40|$|This article {{reports the}} {{findings}} of a review and methodological critique of 96 Latin American empirical studies on television reception published between 1992 and 2007 in the most important journals of the region. The analysis compares the studies according to their theoretical approach, the research technique used, their sample size, the type of audience members studied, the type of television content researched and the scholars mentioned the most in their references. Findings show that Cultural Studies {{is by far the most}} popular theoretical approach in Latin American audience research, and that two of the topics covered the most were television and daily life and the importance of social and <b>cultural</b> <b>mediations.</b> The article also concludes that many studies lack a solid methodological base. Morley, Orozco, Martín-Barbero, García-Canclini and Lull were the scholars mentioned the most in the reference sections. The article ends with a diagnosis of the strengths and weaknesses of current Latin American empirical research on television audiences and points out the need for more methodological rigor and more emphasis on the analysis of ideological readings and impact...|$|R
