5|$|The Admiral Nakhimov-class cruisers were a {{group of}} four light cruisers built for the Imperial Russian Navy just before World War I began in 1914. Construction was {{interrupted}} by the Russian Revolution and {{only two of the}} ships were eventually <b>completed</b> <b>well</b> {{after the end of the}} Russian Civil War by the Soviets. Chervona Ukraina was the first ship completed and was built to essentially the original design. Krasnyi Kavkaz was much modified and completed five years after Chervona Ukraina. Both ships participated in the Sieges of Odessa and Sevastopol after the Germans invaded Russia in June 1941. They ferried troops into the cities, evacuated wounded and bombarded the besieging German troops. Chervona Ukraina was bombed and sunk by dive bombers in November during one of these missions and Krasny Kavkaz was badly damaged by the same type of aircraft in January 1942. After her lengthy repairs were completed, the ship transported reinforcements to cities on the Black Sea coast during the Battle of the Caucasus. She was reclassified as a training ship in 1947 before she was sunk as a target in 1956. Chervona Ukraina was salvaged in 1947 and then became a hulked. She became a target ship in 1950.|$|E

According to the newspaper, the bridge was scheduled to be completed by July 1875. During the course of construction, John Ridenour lost a finger while working on the bridge. The new South Branch Bridge was <b>completed</b> <b>well</b> ahead of schedule in October 1874. The October 12, 1874, edition of the South Branch Intelligencer characterized the new bridge as a [...] "complete, handsome and durable structure", and further recounted that [...] "the contractors, Messrs. White & Sons, New Brighton, Pennsylvania 'Penn Bridge & Machine Works,' have given us, in general opinion, a first rate, durable work, and deserve our best commendations.... We are confident that ours will realize a very handsome income and fully vindicate the wisdom of the County Court in voting its construction." ...|$|E

500|$|Speer devoted much of {{his time}} and energy to reading. Though the prisoners brought some books with them in their {{personal}} property, Spandau Prison had no library so books were sent from Spandau's municipal library. From 1952 the prisoners were also able to order books from the Berlin central library in Wilmersdorf. Speer was a voracious reader and he <b>completed</b> <b>well</b> over 500 books in the first three years at Spandau alone. He read classic novels, travelogues, books on ancient Egypt, and biographies of such figures as Lucas Cranach, Édouard Manet, and Genghis Khan. Speer took to the prison garden for enjoyment and work, at first to do something constructive while afflicted with writer's block. He was allowed to build an ambitious garden, transforming what he initially described as a [...] "wilderness" [...] into what the American commander at Spandau described as [...] "Speer's Garden of Eden".|$|E
500|$|The Keep Tower, the Well Tower and the Kitchen Tower {{comprise}} {{a series of}} apartments, of which the main sequence, the Castellan's Rooms, lie within the Keep. They begin weakly, the Banqueting Hall, <b>completed</b> <b>well</b> after Burges's death, being described by Newman as [...] "dilute [...] unfocused" [...] while Crook considers it [...] "anaemic." [...] It contains a colossal chimney piece, carved by Thomas Nicholls. The identity of the central figure in the overmantel is uncertain; Girouard states that it is King David while McLees suggests that it depicts St Lucius. The Drawing Room is a double-height room with decoration that Newman describes as illustrating the [...] "intertwined themes (of) the fecundity {{of nature and the}} fragility of life." [...] A stone fireplace by Nicholls features the Three Fates, spinning, measuring and cutting the thread of life. The murals around the walls draw on Aesop's Fables with delicate drawings of animals in the Aesthetic Movement style.|$|E
500|$|Given {{the task}} of forming the personalities of the Crash Nitro Kart cast through the full-motion videos, the Red Eye Studio artists set certain rules for how each {{character}} would carry itself by default. As animator Thomas Happ noted, [...] "N. Gin, for example, would always default to twitchy, side-to-side glances, while Tiny would often scratch his head in confusion. There {{were a lot of}} scenes where the characters are just standing around listening to Emperor Velo talk, and we had to invent ways to personalize their mannerisms and create a uniquely 'thinking character'." [...] To achieve the bold and deeply saturated colors and textures for the characters and environments, the artists used Maya as well as Adobe Photoshop and Corel Painter. While the artists adapted many of the sets and props in the cinematics from in-game counterparts, they recreated the majority of these objects from scratch in order to add surrealism to the scenery. The cinematics were <b>completed</b> <b>well</b> in advance of the four-month deadline. The console version of Crash Nitro Kart was announced by Vivendi Universal prior to the Electronic Entertainment Expo of 2003, while the N-Gage version was announced on February 16, 2004. Crash Nitro Kart is among the first titles to be developed using the Intrinsic Alchemy middleware technology following Vicarious Visions' purchase of its rights from the defunct Intrinsic Graphics.|$|E

500|$|Years later, after {{consulting}} with another lawyer, Selletti made another attempt at suing Carey and Sony. His lawyer, Jeffrey Levitt, had uncovered {{the fact that}} the film was released in October 1992, a full six weeks prior to the November 22 dating in Carey's notebook. Additionally, [...] "Heart of a Hero", which was written by Luther Vandross for the film, was submitted in January 1992, making it impossible for [...] "Hero" [...] to have been the original choice of song for the soundtrack. After uncovering further tapes from the studio dating to the summer of 1992, recordings provided evidence that Carey and Afansieff had indeed discussed and had parts of the song <b>completed</b> <b>well</b> before the film's October release. Following the evidence from both parties, the judge dismissed the case, ruling in Carey's favor for the second time. Following the dismissal of the case, Rhonda Dimmie, another songwriter and an independent singer, filed a lawsuit against Carey, this time claiming the song to have borrowed heavily from her song [...] "Be Your Own Hero". During the short deposition made by Carey, Afanasieff revealed that they had written the song in two days during the summer of 1992, [...] "within a matter of hours." [...] Soon after, the case was dismissed, with the judge claiming there to not be sufficient evidence on Dimmie's behalf. Following the lawsuits, in 2001 Selletti made further hints to plan another lawsuit, as well as a forensic team of specialists to conduct research on the incident. Following the suits, Cindy Berger, Carey's publicist released the following statement: [...] "This case has been thrown out of court three times. The federal judge after hearing Selletti's story and considering all the evidence ruled the case was a 'complete fabrication' and that it was filed 'to extort a settlement from deep-pocket defendants." ...|$|E

30|$|Moreover, in the {{statistical}} process, {{we find the}} calculated breakthrough volumes of the <b>complete</b> breakthrough <b>well</b> tend to be larger {{than those of the}} numerical simulation results. However, the calculated volumes of the incomplete breakthrough well {{are more likely to be}} smaller than those of the numerical simulation results. This phenomenon might result from the difference of the calculation methods. For the <b>complete</b> breakthrough <b>well,</b> due to the steam override, the variety of the steam and condensate water profiles of different layers is large. For the calculation method of the <b>complete</b> breakthrough <b>well,</b> the steam override is not taken into consideration. For the incomplete breakthrough well, the breakthrough radius is smaller than the well spacing, and this may lead to the calculated breakthrough area being smaller than the real steam and condensate water area. In summary, the precise relation between the calculated breakthrough volume and the numerical simulation results for <b>complete</b> breakthrough <b>wells</b> and incomplete breakthrough wells needs further study.|$|R

50|$|Whether {{natural gas}} {{produced}} by hydraulic fracturing causes higher well-to-burner emissions than gas produced from conventional wells {{is a matter}} of contention. Some studies have found that hydraulic fracturing has higher emissions due to methane released during <b>completing</b> <b>wells</b> as some gas returns to the surface, together with the fracturing fluids. Depending on their treatment, the well-to-burner emissions are 3.5%-12% higher than fore conventional gas.|$|R
