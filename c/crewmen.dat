5|$|On 13 January 1964, a B-52D {{carrying}} two nuclear bombs suffered a structural failure in flight {{that caused the}} tail section to shear off. Four <b>crewmen</b> ejected successfully before the aircraft crashed near Cumberland, Maryland. Two <b>crewmen</b> subsequently perished on the ground because of hypothermia, while another, who was unable to eject, died in the aircraft; both weapons were recovered. This {{was one of several}} incidents caused by failure of the vertical stabilizer.|$|E

5|$|The crew, {{like those}} of the other nine ships involved, {{received}} many accolades for its rescue efforts. After sending the ship a congratulatory telegram {{at the time of the}} rescue, King Albert of Belgium made Capt. Kreibohm a Chevalier (Knight) of the Order of the Crown in January 1914. At the same time, the Belgian government awarded its Third Class Civic Cross to Kroonlands third officer, and First Class Civic Medals to six <b>crewmen</b> and a steward. In March, King George V of the United Kingdom, on recommendation of the Board of Trade, awarded 39 of the ship's crew the Silver Sea Gallantry Medal, along with a £3 award. <b>Crewmen</b> from all ten ships received Sea Gallantry Medals, but no other ship had more medals awarded than Kroonland. Later in March, the United States Congress honored Kreibohm with a gold watch, Kroonlands officers—including Kreibohm—with Congressional Gold Medals, and other <b>crewmen</b> with five silver and 25 bronze medals. In April, the Life Saving Benevolent Association of New York awarded its Life Saving Medal to Kreibohm, four officers, and 35 <b>crewmen.</b> In June 1916, Kreibohm was presented with the American Cross of Honor by Congressman Henry Bruckner.|$|E

2500|$|Whilst {{the sedan}} VZ range {{received}} both {{versions of the}} Alloytec V6, the Ute and <b>Crewman</b> range received just the lower-capacity small 3.6L V6- Alloytec 175 – it was the standard base engine across the entire ute & <b>Crewman</b> range, with a six-speed manual. A 4-speed automatic was also available as an option, however. <b>Crewman</b> vehicles were factory speed limited to 160 km/h due to the long length of driveshaft. The <b>Crewman</b> also suffered a larger turning circle and heavier fuel consumption [...] than the ute, due to the longer, heavier wheelbase chassis. The One Tonner and <b>Crewman</b> ranges shared the same base specification models, as shown below: ...|$|R
50|$|The <b>Crewman</b> {{was also}} {{available}} in Cross 8 form, whilst the VZ range added the <b>Crewman</b> Cross 6, essentially a lower powered V6 version of the Cross 8.|$|R

5|$|OTUs, {{employing}} as {{they did}} warplanes that were more advanced and more powerful than trainers, and teaching combat techniques that often carried high risk, generally suffered higher accident rates than other flying training schools. On 3March 1943, a Wirraway of No.4 OTU crashed near Williamtown, killing both <b>crewmen.</b> Two others died when their Vengeance crashed and burned near Goulburn during a cross-country exercise on 4August. On 16August, a Vengeance flew into trees after apparently pulling out late from a dive, resulting in two fatalities. A Vengeance blew up in flight during dive-bombing practice at Williamtown on 14September, killing both <b>crewmen.</b> On 5October, a Vengeance on a dive-bombing exercise crashed into the sea near Newcastle; both <b>crewmen</b> were reported as missing, believed killed. No.4 OTU suffered two more fatalities when a Vengeance struck a hill near Braidwood during a cross-country flight on 26November 1943. Another Vengeance hit the water and exploded in Nelson Bay on 7April 1944 after failing to recover from a dive, killing the two-man crew.|$|E

5|$|When Quatermass and {{his team}} reach the crash area and succeed in opening the rocket, they {{discover}} that {{only one of the}} three <b>crewmen,</b> Victor Carroon, remains inside. Quatermass and his chief assistant Paterson (Hugh Kelly) investigate the interior of the rocket, and are baffled by what they find: the space suits of the others are present, and the instruments on board indicate that the door was never opened in flight, but {{there is no sign of}} the other two <b>crewmen.</b>|$|E
50|$|The special warfare combatant-craft <b>crewman</b> {{insignia}} is {{a military}} qualification badge of the United States Navy which was first conceived in 1996, though the design was not approved for wear until 2001. The insignia is authorized for wear by volunteer members of special boat teams (formerly special boat units) under U.S. Naval Special Warfare Command. Candidates must pass the SWCC basic <b>crewman</b> training and <b>crewman</b> qualification training.|$|R
50|$|One Department of Defense {{report said}} that one Air Force search and rescue <b>crewman</b> and two {{aircraft}} were lost for every 9.2 recoveries in Vietnam, while the Navy lost a <b>crewman</b> for every 1.8 recoveries.|$|R
5000|$|The VY range marked {{major change}} for Holden's Ute range, with the 2003 {{addition}} {{of two new}} models: {{the return of the}} One Tonner cab-chassis utility after an 18-year hiatus; and the introduction of Holden's first-ever 4-door utility, arriving {{in the form of the}} <b>Crewman.</b> The <b>Crewman</b> brought a longer wheelbase - 3206 mm compared to the 2939 mm of the Ute; and a shorter tray - 1463 mm compared to the 2193 mm of the Ute In December 2003, Holden released an all-wheel drive variant of the <b>Crewman</b> known as the <b>Crewman</b> Cross 8. Powered by a [...] V8 engine, the Cross 8 featured a modified appearance, more suited to an off-road vehicle.|$|R
5|$|While {{officers}} were typically {{allowed to leave}} their ships—with two notable exceptions—civilian technicians (some of them British), machinists, and other integral <b>crewmen</b> were not given the same opportunity. These exceptions came on Minas Geraes, whose {{officers were}} surprised but had time to draw their weapons and defend themselves. The ship's captain, , {{was killed in the}} fighting along with several loyal and rebel <b>crewmen.</b> Any other bloodshed was much more limited: on the cruiser Bahia, the only officer aboard was killed after he shot a rebel crewman, and one lieutenant on São Paulo killed himself.|$|E
5|$|Apart from brief refits in the UK, Canada and Australia, she {{remained}} on this duty until early 1918 {{when she became}} a troopship. During a severe storm off the Isle of Islay in late 1918, she was rammed by another troopship and forced ashore by the storm, killing 470 passengers (American soldiers) and <b>crewmen.</b>|$|E

5000|$|<b>Crewman</b> {{models were}} {{on the other hand}} {{available}} with the same three specifications as the Ute range, and were launched conjointly with the rest of Holden's VY Series 2 range, the major update this time being the addition of [...] to the Gen.3 V8. By December 2003 the <b>Crewman</b> range had expanded to include Holden's very first AWD utility {{in the form of the}} <b>Crewman</b> Cross 8. The Cross 8 received bolstered wheelarches, raised ride height as well as additional equipment, with the sole drivetrain being the recently upgraded Gen.3 V8 connected to a 4-speed automatic. V6-powered versions of the One Tonner & <b>Crewman</b> were only available with automatic transmission. The VY's were superseded by the arrival of the VZ range in August 2004 ...|$|R
5|$|Sabotage by {{a disgruntled}} <b>crewman.</b> While no {{individual}} was {{named in the}} commission's final report, its conclusion was {{that the cause of}} the explosion was most likely a <b>crewman</b> in No. 3 turret who had recently been accused of theft and was believed to be suicidal.|$|R
5|$|It {{was early}} June before UB-10 sank her next ship. The Belgian ship Menapier, {{carrying}} {{a load of}} iron ore from Algiers for Middlesbrough, was torpedoed and sunk off North Foreland by Steinbrinck on the 7th. Of the 23 persons on board the 1,886-ton ship, only 6 were saved. Menapiers master, his wife, and six-year-old daughter, the first mate, the pilot, and 12 other <b>crewmen</b> perished.|$|E
5|$|On 24 January 1963, a B-52C on a {{training}} mission out of Westover Air Force Base, Massachusetts, lost its vertical stabilizer due to buffeting during low-level flight, and crashed {{on the west}} side of Elephant Mountain near Greenville, Maine. Of the nine <b>crewmen</b> aboard, two survived the crash.|$|E
5|$|On 30 July, Winslow {{picked up}} the master and 12 <b>crewmen</b> from SS Whitehall, torpedoed the day before by , and brought them safely into Queenstown.

5000|$|Instructors of the SWCC basic <b>crewman</b> {{training}} course train, develop, and assess SWCC candidates in physical conditioning, water competency, teamwork, and mental tenacity. This course {{starts with a}} three-week indoctrination. The SWCC basic <b>crewman</b> training is eight weeks long. Physical conditioning with running, swimming, and calisthenics grows harder as the weeks progress. Students abilities, mental fortitude and teamwork skills are tested during an arduous 51-hour-long evolution involving little sleep, constant exposure to the elements, underway boat and swimming events, and a test of navigational skills and boat tactics. This test {{is referred to as}} the [...] "tour". SWCC students participate in weekly timed runs, timed obstacle course evolutions, pool, bay and ocean swims, and learn small-boat seamanship. Upon the completion of SWCC basic <b>crewman</b> training, students advance to <b>crewman</b> qualification training.|$|R

5|$|On 5 August 1911, {{the ship}} {{suffered}} {{an explosion in}} one of her 12-inch guns when it failed to fire during gunnery practice. After some time passed, the breech was opened and ignited the propellant; the resulting fire killed 16 <b>crewmen</b> and several officers.|$|E
5|$|On the {{following}} day Huron encountered another sailing ship, the Lebanon, heading for New York. Dorian, the five passengers and twelve of the crew chose to transfer to Lebanon.

5|$|The American {{carriers}} {{launched an}} airstrike shortly after dawn; Zuikaku {{was struck by}} three bombs and one torpedo that started fires in both hangars, damaged one propeller shaft, {{and gave her a}} 29.5° list to port. Fifteen minutes later, the fires were extinguished and the list was reduced to 6° by counterflooding. She was mostly ignored by the second wave of attacking aircraft, but was a focus of the third wave that hit her with six more torpedoes and four bombs. The bombs started fires in the hangars, the torpedoes caused major flooding that increased her list, and the order to abandon ship was issued before Zuikaku sank by the stern. Lost with the ship were 49 officers and 794 <b>crewmen,</b> but 47 officers and 815 <b>crewmen</b> were rescued by her escorting destroyers.|$|E
