5|$|Physically {{abused as}} a child, Judd {{wants to keep}} Shiloh {{because he does not}} {{comprehend}} why people are so interested in rescuing the abused dog. No one <b>cared</b> <b>to</b> rescue Judd when he was harmed throughout his youth. Despite Judd's growing into a harsh man, reviewer Hary Sheehan noted, he preserves a glimmer of empathy. Journalist Kate Cavanaugh wrote that Judds' inability to love and cherish Shiloh is borne because of the love his family nurtured in him.|$|E

25|$|It is {{possible}} that he was closest to Perdiccas, because it was with Perdiccas that {{he went on the}} mission to take Peuceolatis and bridge the Indus. By that time, as Alexander's effective second-in-command, he could doubtless have chosen any officer he <b>cared</b> <b>to</b> name. They accomplished everything they set out to do with great success, which indicates {{that the two of them}} worked well together, and that Hephaestion found the irrepressible Perdiccas a congenial companion. It is notable that their two cavalry regiments in particular were selected by Alexander for the dangerous crossing of the river Hydaspes before the battle with the Indian king, Porus. On that occasion superb teamwork would have been of paramount importance.|$|E

25|$|Cyrus the Great (c. 600 or 576 – 530 BC) {{figures in}} the Hebrew Bible as the patron and {{deliverer}} of the Jews. He is mentioned 23 times by name and alluded to several times more. According to the Bible, Cyrus the Great, king of Persia, was the monarch under whom the Babylonian captivity ended. In {{the first year of}} his reign he was prompted by God to make a decree that the Temple in Jerusalem should be rebuilt and that such Jews as <b>cared</b> <b>to</b> might return to their land for this purpose. Moreover, he showed his interest in the project by sending back with them the sacred vessels which had been taken from the First Temple and a considerable sum of money with which to buy building materials. The existence of the decree has been challenged.|$|E
25|$|In {{its early}} days {{following}} the station's sign-on, KQED broadcast only twice a week for one hour each day. Despite the very limited schedule, the station was still losing money, leading to a decision in early 1955 from its board of trustees to close down the station. Its staff got the board to keep the station {{on the air and}} try to get needed funds from the public in a form of a televised auction, in which celebrities would appear to auction off goods and services donated to the station. While the station still came a little short, it did show that the general public <b>cared</b> <b>to</b> keep KQED on the air. Since then, the auction became a fund-raising tool for many public television stations, though its usage waned in recent years in favor of increased usage of special pledge drives throughout the year.|$|E
25|$|Guðrøðr's {{reliance}} upon Norwegian assistance, {{instead of}} support from his maternal-grandfather, could suggest that the attack upon Galloway was more successful than the compiler of the chronicle <b>cared</b> <b>to</b> admit. Additionally, the account of incessant inter-dynastic strife amongst the ruling family of Galloway, as recorded by the twelfth-century Vita Ailredi, suggests that Fergus may have struggled to maintain control of his lordship by the mid 1150s, and may also explain his failure to come to Guðrøðr's aid following Óláfr's death. Óláfr and Guðrøðr's turn to Ingi occurred {{at about the same}} time that Norwegian encroachment superseded roughly thirty years of Scottish influence in Orkney and Caithness, and could be evidence of a perceived wane in Scottish royal authority in the first years of the 1150s. In November 1153, following the death of David, Somairle seized the initiative and rose in revolt against the recently inaugurated Malcolm IV, King of Scotland (died 1165). The dynastic-challenges faced by Malcolm, and the ebb of Scottish influence in the Isles, may partly account for Guðrøðr's success in consolidating control of the kingdom, and may be perceptible in the seemingly more aggressive policy he pursued as king in comparison to his father.|$|E

500|$|Yet the {{character}} of George I remains elusive; he was in turn genial and affectionate in private letters to his daughter, and then dull and awkward in public.

Violence against any human being, born poor or rich, is wrong believed Gandhi. He stated that mandate theory of majoritarian democracy shouldn't be pushed to absurd extremes, individual freedoms should never be denied, and no person should ever be made a social or economic slave to the [...] "resolutions of majorities".|$|E
500|$|Miller and Hordern's {{collaboration}} {{continued into}} 1969 with King Lear at the Nottingham Playhouse. Hordern immediately accepted {{the title role}} but later {{said that it was}} a character he never much <b>cared</b> <b>to</b> play. Writing about Miller in his autobiography, Hordern stated: [...] "It {{was one of the most}} exhilarating and funny experiences I have had in the theatre." [...] Miller recruited Frank Middlemass to play the fool, but contrary to tradition, Miller made the character an intimate of Lear's as opposed to a servant, something which Shakespearean purists found difficult to accept. Miller decided to further defy convention by concentrating on the relationships between the characters rather than adding detail to scenery and costume; he was eager not to use lavish sets and lighting for the fear of detracting from the characterisations and the sentimentality of the storyline. As such, the sets were bleak and the costumes more so; it was a style that was also used when the play was televised by the BBC later that decade.|$|E
500|$|Conditions {{within the}} keep worsened {{by the day}} and the {{garrison}} were reduced to eating horse flesh. In an attempt to reduce the demand on limited provisions, some members were sent out of the keep, beginning with those least capable of fighting. Some sources record that they had their hands and feet amputated by the besiegers. On 30November the garrison eventually surrendered and were taken captive. Initially John wanted to execute them all as was the custom of the time when a garrison had forced a long and bloody conflict. Savaric de Mauléon, one of John's captains, persuaded the king otherwise, concerned that similar treatment would be shown to royal garrisons by the rebels. Only one person was executed: a crossbowman who had previously been {{in the service of the}} king since childhood was hanged. Many of the rebels were imprisoned, sent to royal castles such as Corfe for safe-keeping. Of the siege the Barnwell chronicler wrote, [...] "Our age has not known a siege so hard pressed nor so strongly resisted... Afterwards few <b>cared</b> <b>to</b> put their trust in castles". Prince Louis of France, son of PhilipII, was invited by the barons to become the new leader of the rebellion and become king in the event of their victory. In 1216 he arrived in England and captured Rochester Castle; it is not known how, however, as no documentary evidence recording the event survives.|$|E

500|$|The single reel drama, {{approximately}} 1,000 feet long, {{was released}} on November 11, 1910. The film was originally planned to be released on November 4, but it was delayed and some advertisements and later listings for the film give the erroneous date. The film received negative reviews in trade publications from even those which typically praised even the weaker productions. Though it was not well-received, the production was not criticized as sharply as Avenged had been. Walton of The Moving Picture News stated that the film was [...] " [...] very feeble echo on Anthony Hope. The throne room staging is ridiculous {{and so is the}} resolution. The flag-waving business is feebly melodramatic. Princes, etc. don't sit on that sort of chair. I'm an admirer of Thanhouser, but this thing is straight, plain punk. In Europe it will be received as a Yankee joke." [...] The reviewer for The Moving Picture World was decidedly neutral, highlighting only the novelty of the plot and refraining from any criticism or praise of the merits of the production. The New York Dramatic Mirror was negative, but not scathing. The reviewer stated, [...] "The narrative is very entertaining - or could be made so, if the producer had <b>cared</b> <b>to</b> trouble himself about details. In its present crude form, its wild impossibility rather grates upon a spectator, because every scene in the film has some inconsistency. At least, it was worth doing well. Unfortunately, neither the acting nor the mounting has any particular merit." ...|$|E
