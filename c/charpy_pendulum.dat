40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{possibility}} of applying optical fibers as sensors for investigating low energy impact damage in laminar thermoplastic composite materials, in real time. Impact toughness testing by a <b>Charpy</b> impact <b>pendulum</b> with different loads was conducted {{in order to determine}} the method for comparative measurement of the resulting damage in the material. For that purpose intensity-based optical fibers were built in to specimens of composite materials with Kevlar 129 (the DuPont registered trade-mark for poly(p-phenylene terephthalamide)) woven fabric as reinforcement and thermoplastic PVB (poly(vinyl butyral)) as the matrix. In some specimens part of the layers of Kevlar was replaced with metal mesh (50 % or 33 % of the layers). Experimental testing was conducted in order to observe and analyze the response of the material under multiple low-energy impacts. Light from the light-emitting diode (LED) was launched to the embedded optical fiber and was propagated to the phototransistor-based photo detector. During each impact, the signal level, which is proportional to the light intensity in the optical fiber, drops and then slowly recovers. The obtained signals were analyzed to determine the appropriate method for real time damage monitoring. The major part of the damage occurs during impact. The damage reflects as a local, temporary release of strain in the optical fiber and an increase of the signal level. The obtained results show that intensity-based optical fibers could be used for measuring the damage in laminar thermoplastic composite materials. The acquired optical fiber signals depend on the type of material, but the same set of rules (relatively different, depending on the type of material) could be specified. Using real time measurement of the signal during impact and appropriate analysis enables quantitative evaluation of the impact damage in the material. Existing methods in most cases use just the intensity of the signal before and after the impact, as the measure of damage. This method could be used to monitor the damage in real time, giving warnings before fatal damage occurs...|$|R

The impact tests were performed {{by means of an}} instrumented <b>Charpy</b> <b>pendulum.</b> During impact testing, the maximum load and the total impact energy, as well as its complementary contributions, the energy at maximum load and the crack propagation energy, were measured. Impact properties were studied as a function of size and shape of the main microstructural features, which were analysed by means of optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The results show that the influence of grain refinement on microstructure involves beneficial and detrimental concurrent effects which strongly affect impact properties. The total impact energy decreases with the addition of all the grain refiners due to a shift from a mixed transgranular–intergranular fracture mode to a more severe transgranular mode. Crack initiation and propagation occur mainly through the fracture of Fe-intermetallics and brittle Si particles, and the mechanism of void coalescence. No direct correlation between grain size and impact properties is found. Moreover, the aspect ratio of eutectic Si particles does not change with grain refinement, implying that there are no mutual poisoning effects between Sr and B. Total impact energy is found to depend on both SDAS and b-platelets size.

MAG, TIG) have not been tested, but it is suspected that similar phenomena are taking place. Originality/value: In this research new method of cooling weld joint during welding was used. At the present time use of micro-jet cooling while MIG is in the testing phase and requires an accurate diagnosis. This method is very promising and capable of industrial application, mainly due to the significant improvement of weld quality and reduces costs...|$|E
40|$|Os estudos de resistência da madeira ao impacto referem-se à eficiência com que este {{material}} absorve energia de um impacto e dissipa-a sem danos a sua estrutura. Dessa forma, o objetivo deste estudo foi avaliar a influência do teor de umidade na resistência ao impacto da madeira de nogueira-pecã (Carya illinoinensis). Para tanto, foram utilizadas árvores procedentes de duas regiões fisiográficas do estado do Rio Grande do Sul. Os corpos de prova, em condições de equilíbrio a 12 % de umidade e saturados, foram submetidos ao impacto utilizando-se pêndulo de CHARPY, e avaliados quanto à resistência oferecida com a aplicação da carga nos planos tangencial e radial e posições de retirada (medula - casca) nas toras, para as duas regiões fisiográficas em cada condição de umidade. Para auxiliar na interpretação dos dados, determinou-se a massa específica aparente a 12 % e saturada, trabalho absorvido, coeficiente de resiliência e a cota dinâmica. Pôde-se verificar, por meio dos resultados, que a madeira de nogueira-pecã é mais resistente ao impacto na condição saturada. The {{studies of}} wood impact strength {{refers to the}} efficiency of this material in absorb impact energy and dissipate it without structural damages. The present study aimed to evaluate the influence of moisture content on the impact strength of nogueira-pecã (Carya illinoinensis) wood. For this, trees from two physiographic regions of state of Rio Grande do Sul were used. The samples, stabilized at 12 % of moisture content and in green conditions (saturated), were submitted to impact tests through a <b>CHARPY</b> <b>pendulum,</b> and were evaluated for the resistance to the application of loads in the tangential and radial sections, and in {{the positions of the}} log (pith-bark) for the two physiographic regions at each moisture condition. Moreover, the apparent specific gravity at 12 % and in green conditions (saturated), the absorbed work, the resilience coefficient and the dynamic quote were determined. The main results showed that the nogueira-pecã wood is more resistant to the impact when it is in green conditions...|$|E
40|$|The work {{described}} in this thesis {{is the result of}} a collaboration between the University of Camerino and the Teuco Guzzini of Montelupone and is born from the demand for the application of chemical research to the development of innovative products; these products are obtained by the polymerization of highly filled methacrylic dispersions containing inorganic fillers. For this reason, the target of part of my work is the study of the rheological parameters of methacrylic composite materials filled with alumina trihydrate and the application of this to obtain some Teuco products; without being limited solely however to the study of the non polymerized compositions but also includes the research of a suitable catalytic system, the study of the phases of the a curing process and the chemical-mechanical characterization of the articles obtained. The work describes the development of an important project, the Cold Cure project, which concerns a process of polymerization conducted at room pressure and temperature and applied in particular to the production of shower trays, but could equally be used for the production of other articles, such is washbasins, sinks, work-tops, ect. For this reason, part of my academic program was developed in the laboratory R&D of Teuco Guzzini, where I had the opportunity to follow the steps of preparation of the dispersions, to effect the rheological study of these dispersions and to perform the mechanical characterization of the products obtained, using specific instruments. These included the viscometer, for the rheological analysis of the material, the Rockwell durometer, the Barcol durometer, the <b>Charpy</b> <b>pendulum,</b> the flexural and tensile dynamometer, the modular measurer of superficial tension and angle of contact and the spectrophotometer, for the mechanical characterization of the manufactured articles. Working in the laboratory R&D Teuco, has also allowed me to carry out the study keeping in mind the commercial demands, for which the results must be compatible each time with the management of time and business costs. The characterization of the moulded articles was also carried out from a chemical point of view, by the determination of the residual monomer, an important parameter to explore the complete reaction of polymerization using an analytical method developed in the Department of Organic Chemistry of the University of Camerino. Further, for the elimination of some defects present on the surface of the shower trays obtained through the Cold Cure technology, the use of SEM spectroscopy is revealed to be particularly useful. All of this with the purpose of applying a catalysis system, used above all for products in polyester, to obtain shower trays in methacrylic resin and to develop an innovative process of polymerization and an innovative type of mould, economical and easy to achieve. Therefore, the experimentation is not limited to laboratory tests for the study of a suitable catalysis system and the analysis of the material and the chemical-mechanical characterizations, but it also includes the study of the productive process, from the step of molding to the workmanship of the manufactured articles.

40|$|The {{first part}} of my thesis {{represents}} {{a contribution to the}} program of the research group of the School of Science and Technology, Chemistry Division, of the University of Camerino, which has for a long time been studying the cerium chemistry and has dedicated itself particularly to the study of new methodologies involving the use of system CeCl 3 · 7 H 2 O with NaI. In many trials, good results have been achieved and the procedures developed are characterized not only by the efficiency of the reactions, but also by chemoselective processes, by a good stereochemical control, by reacting available and inexpensive reagents and, in some cases, from the possibility of recovering the catalytic promoter system used through simple procedures of work-up. One of the objectives of the modern organic synthesis concerns the substitution of chemical processes that use substances dangerous for the environment with eco-friendly methodologies. The system CeCl 3 · 7 H 2 O-NaI is inexpensive, non-toxic, very stable when exposed to water and air, it is able to work under solvent-free conditions and it can be recycled. This means that it is an excellent catalyst in various reactions, contributing in this way to the development of green chemistry, in response to the problem of environmental pollution caused by the difficulty eliminating of the organic solvents. This also means the development of new strategies for the synthesis of natural substances and unnatural with important biological activities, it represents a field of remarkable interest and in continuing development in organic chemistry. This work will be described in the chapters 1 to 3. The second part of my academic program was developed at the Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research in Mainz, Germany, described in chapter 4. The work was carried out in collaboration with Delta s. r. l, producers of kitchen sinks and rose from the market demand of selfcleaning surfaces using nanosized titanium dioxide. Following the pathway of heterogeneous catalysis, the research has been focused on realizing an additive made of PMMA nanoparticles functionalized with TiO 2. The third part of my work is in collaboration between the University of Camerino and Teuco Guzzini s. p. a. and is described in chapters 5 and 6. Teuco {{is one of the most}} important producers for sanitary ware, especially tubs, wash basins, shower trays and boxes, in constant research for innovative materials and design, better performance and quality. The collaboration between University and Teuco was born from the demand for the application of chemical research to the development of innovative materials. The work describes the development of an important project, the Cold Cure project, which concerns a process of polymerization conducted at room pressure and temperature and applied in particular to the production of shower trays, but could equally be used for the production of other articles, such as washbasins, sinks, work-tops, ect. The targets of my work are resumed in the following points: · Technological improvement of the productive process to reduce production time and costs. · Improvement of the esthetical properties to remove the white spots affecting the cured material. · Improvement of the cold curing system to obtain better mechanical and chemical properties. In Teuco, I had the opportunity to follow the steps of preparation of the dispersions, to complete the rheological study of slurries, to perform the mechanical characterization of the products obtained and to develop the productive processes using specific instruments and machines. The lab instruments included a viscometer for the rheological analysis of the material, a Rockwell durometer, a Barcol durometer, a <b>Charpy</b> <b>pendulum</b> and a flexural and tensile dynamometer. The characterization of the moulded articles was also carried out from a chemical point of view, by the determination of the residual monomer, an important parameter to explore the complete reaction of polymerization using an analytical method developed in the School of Science and Technology, Chemistry Division, of the University of Camerino. Furthermore, for the elimination of some defects present on the surface of the shower trays obtained through the cold cure technology, the use of SEM microscopy was particularly useful. The industrial machines used include: injection moulding machines, multi-component dosing, mixing and casting machines. Working in the laboratory R&D Teuco also allowed me to carry out the study keeping in mind the commercial demands, for which the results must be each time compatible with the management of time and business costs.
