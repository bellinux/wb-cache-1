Each class in the game has an individualized SSD, and most expansions revolve around providing new classes and 'variants' of ships to the game, with new SSDs. These displays consist of check-off boxes for all the ship's structure and systems (shields in all six directions, systems and hull damage, how much power the engines produce, how many transporters there are, etc. checked off when damaged) in the general layout of the ship, along with general reference information for that ship (tracks to <b>check</b> <b>off</b> use for weapons in limited supply like drones, shuttles, probes, plus weapons fire resolution tables, firing arcs, and miscellaneous ship data).|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} for IGN, Matt Fowler {{wrote of the}} episode, [...] ""Book of the Stranger" [...] handed us two very lovely, {{satisfying}} moments with the Stark/Snow reunion at Castle Black (and the subsequent vow to defeat Ramsay and rescue Rickon) and Daenerys's conquering of Vaes Dothrak. Both were huge, forward-moving story elements that harkened back to Season 1 and gave viewers something to root for and grab onto as the show itself heads into its final arcs." [...] Fowler also noted, [...] "As a reader of the books with no more books to read, Season 6 {{has been a very}} interesting experience," [...] giving the episode a 9.2 out of 10. Jeremy Egner of The New York Times also praised the scenes at Castle Black and in Vaes Dothrak, writing [...] "Game of Thrones lived up to its billing as A Song of Ice and Fire on Sunday, as there was plenty of action in both of the signature halves of the story." [...] Brandon Nowalk of The A.V. Club wrote, [...] "Now that is how you set the table. [...] "Book Of The Stranger" [...] doesn't just <b>check</b> <b>off</b> plot points.

[...] Brown also amended the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, with Senator Jack Reed (RI), to create a dedicated military liaison office within the newly formed Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which aside from defending against unscrupulous lenders, also ensures protection of military families against fraudulent life insurance policies.

500|$|Muhney {{said in an}} {{interview}} that the plot point of seducing Rafe broadened Adam's horizons. He said, [...] "What it did was move a character who represents a person who lives in Genoa City and moved him outside of a box that you can neatly <b>check</b> <b>off.</b> 'He is straight, he is this, or he is that,' and the fact that some lines are blurred makes him more real. When they did that with this character, I loved the opportunity to play into a different realm which is usually not touched upon on television." [...] Muhney described the character as a [...] "puppeteer" [...] with [...] "survival instinct", but also someone with a conscience. In another interview, when asked what he likes about portraying Adam, Muhney stated: [...] "You want to play a catalytic character. You know a troublemaker is good business. You know someone who doesn't swim with the fishes, who swims upstream in the other direction, is someone who is going to cause friction and turbulence in storyline with other characters. I have been told by many of my cast members that the role to play is Adam. They say, [...] "If I were to have a choice, the character I would want to play is your role, Adam." ...|$|E

2500|$|In some jurisdictions, the {{preprinted}} prescription {{contains two}} signature lines: [...] one line has [...] "dispense as written" [...] printed underneath; the other line has [...] "substitution permitted" [...] underneath. [...] Some have a preprinted box [...] "dispense as written" [...] for the prescriber to <b>check</b> <b>off</b> (but this is easily checked off by anyone {{with access to}} the prescription). [...] Other jurisdictions the protocol is for the prescriber to handwrite one of the following phrases: [...] "dispense as written", [...] "DAW", [...] "brand necessary", [...] "do not substitute", [...] "no substitution", [...] "medically necessary", [...] "do not interchange". In other jurisdictions they may use completely different languages, never mind a different formula of words. [...] In some jurisdictions, it may be a legal requirement to include the age of child on the prescription.
