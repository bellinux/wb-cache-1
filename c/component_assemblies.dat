40|$|The {{component}} approach {{aims for}} the reuse by a coherent and easy <b>components</b> <b>assembly.</b> But obtaining a coherent <b>components</b> <b>assembly</b> {{is not an}} easy exercise. To achieve this, we advocate a contractual approach distinguishing different syntactic, structural, semantic, synchronization and service quality contracts. We have successfully applied this approach on two models of semi-formal contractual components: UML 2. 0 and Ugatze. Indeed, we propose two approaches: VerifComponentUML 2. 0 and VerifComponentUgatze. The VerifComponentUML 2. 0 approach aims the verification of syntactic, structural, synchronization and quality service contracts on a UML 2. 0 <b>component</b> <b>assembly</b> through two formal component models Acme/Armani and Wright. VerifComponentUML 2. 0 has two tools: Wr 2 fdr and Wright 2 Ada. The tool Wr 2 fdr allows translating Wright expression to CSP contracts in order to verify synchronization using the model checker FDR. It is a IDM tool Wright 2 Ada which allow is transforming Wright code to Ada, in order to open UML 2. 0 on static analysis and dynamic tools associated with Ada. VerifComponentUgatze approach provides a frame allowing to check syntactic and structural contracts of an Ugatze <b>component</b> <b>assembly</b> through Acme/Armani.

40|$|Languages are {{increasingly}} being used to reuse computations as components {{as well as to}} express these computations in the first place. However, the expression of computations and component assembly have opposing language requirements: the former requires flexible Turing-complete constructs that can express many interactions while the latter benefits from constructs that instead hide interactions. Accordingly, a simple non Turing-complete language should be used to express <b>component</b> <b>assemblies</b> rather than the general-purpose languages used to express computations. Unfortunately, simple languages often cannot express many kinds of useful <b>component</b> <b>assemblies</b> because they cannot abstract over “space ” in the form of unbounded-size data structures or “time ” in the form of mutable state. We introduce SuperGlue as a simple language that can abstract over space and time without Turing-complete constructs. SuperGlue combines signals, which are values that can change over time, universally quantified rules, SQL-like arrays, and objects to express graphs of component connections that are unbounded in size and can change over time. With these constructs, SuperGlue is easy to use while also being capable of expressing useful programs such as user interfaces that view table-like or tree-like data. We have completed our initial design and implementation of SuperGlue and in this paper report on early experience. 1...|$|E

In addition to protons, ion beams with energy of 440 GeV/charge and total pulse energy of 21 kJ can be provided. The beam parameters can be tuned to match the needs of each experiment.
