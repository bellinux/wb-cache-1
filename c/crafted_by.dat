5|$|Al-Maʿarri is {{controversial}} even today {{as he was}} sceptical of Islam, the dominant religion of the Arab World. In 2013, almost a thousand years after his death, the al-Nusra Front, a branch of al-Qaeda, beheaded a statue of Al-Maʿarri {{during the civil war}} in Syria. The statue had been <b>crafted</b> <b>by</b> the sculptor Fathi Muhammad. The motive behind the beheading is disputed; theories range from {{the fact that he was}} a heretic to the fact that he is believed by some to be related to the Assad family.|$|E

5|$|DuBois rose to {{national}} prominence {{as the leader}} of the Niagara Movement, a group of African-American activists who wanted equal rights for blacks. DuBois and his supporters opposed the Atlanta compromise, an agreement <b>crafted</b> <b>by</b> BookerT. Washington which provided that Southern blacks would work and submit to white political rule, while Southern whites guaranteed that blacks would receive basic educational and economic opportunities. Instead, DuBois insisted on full civil rights and increased political representation, which he believed would be brought about by the African-American intellectual elite. He referred to this group as the Talented Tenth and believed that African Americans needed the chances for advanced education to develop its leadership.|$|E

5|$|East coast trade hummed, with goods {{arriving}} from Golkonda where rice, millet, pulses and tobacco were grown {{on a large}} scale. Dye crops of indigo and chay root were produced for the weaving industry. A mineral rich region, Machilipatnam was the gateway for high quality iron and steel exports. Diamond mining {{was active in the}} Kollur region. The cotton weaving industry produced two types of cottons, plain calico and muslin (brown, bleached or dyed). Cloth printed with coloured patterns <b>crafted</b> <b>by</b> native techniques were exported to Java and the Far East. Golkonda specialised in plain cotton and Pulicat in printed. The main imports on the east coast were non-ferrous metals, camphor, porcelain, silk and luxury goods.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, Cooper {{became the}} third-ever {{recipient}} of the Oxford Cup, an award recognizing outstanding past members of Beta Theta Pi. Also in 1985, he was awarded an honorary doctorate degree from Cumberland College (now the University of the Cumberlands) in Williamsburg, Kentucky. He was named a Distinguished Alumnus of Centre College in 1987. A non-partisan group co-chaired by former Kentucky gubernatorial candidate Larry Forgy raised $60,000 to commission two sculptures of Cooper. A life-sized bronze bust of Cooper sculpted by John Tuska was installed at the Kentucky State Capitol in 1987. The other sculpture, a life-sized bronze statue <b>crafted</b> <b>by</b> Barney Bright, was placed in Fountain Square in Somerset.|$|E
5|$|Reagan's {{campaign}} {{relied on}} a strategy <b>crafted</b> <b>by</b> campaign manager John Sears of winning a few primaries early to damage the inevitability of Ford's likely nomination. Reagan won North Carolina, Texas, and California, but the strategy failed, as he ended up losing New Hampshire, Florida, and his native Illinois. The Texas campaign lent renewed hope to Reagan, when he swept all 96 delegates chosen in the May 1 primary, with four more awaiting at the state convention. Much {{of the credit for}} that victory came from the work of three co-chairmen, including Ernest Angelo, the mayor of Midland, and Ray Barnhart of Houston, whom Reagan as President would appoint in 1981 as director of the Federal Highway Administration.|$|E

5|$|The R-5 Pyramid {{is largely}} {{believed}} to by K'inich Yo'nal Ahk I's tomb, based mostly on evidence from Panel 4, <b>crafted</b> <b>by</b> Itzam K'an Ahk I, which records the new ajaw either dedicating or ceremonially re-opening {{the tomb of}} K'inich Yo'nal Ahk I. The panel itself explicitly names the R-5 pyramid as the muk, or burial, of K'inich Yo'nal Ahk I. However, despite intense efforts, no burial has ever {{been found in the}} pyramid, although the search was complicated by—and eventually abandoned because of—rubble fill left behind by looters. It is probable {{that the majority of the}} pyramid was constructed within the years following the death of K'inich Yo'nal Ahk I, likely under Itzam K'an Ahk I's patronage. Itzam K'an Ahk I later erected six stelae at the base of this pyramid.|$|E
5|$|The {{interiors}} of each wing have separate uses. In {{the west wing}} is the baptistry, in the north is the main altar, the main entrance and a notary area, separated by inside corner walls made of chiluca stone and tezontle. Chiluca, a white stone, covers the walls and floors and the tezontle frames the doors and windows. At the crossing of the structure is an octagonal dome framed by arches that form curved triangles where they meet {{at the top of}} the dome. The principal altar is in the ornate Churrigueresque style and <b>crafted</b> <b>by</b> indigenous artist Pedro Patiño Ixtolinque. It was inaugurated in 1829.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} the Han dynasty, when the state needed to {{accurately}} measure distances traveled throughout the empire, the Chinese relied on a mechanical odometer. The Chinese odometer was a wheeled carriage, its gearwork being driven by {{the rotation of the}} carriage's wheels; specific units of distance—the Chinese li—were marked by the mechanical striking of a drum or bell as an auditory signal. The specifications for the 11th century odometer were written by Chief Chamberlain Lu Daolong, who is quoted extensively in the historical text of the Song Shi (compiled by 1345). In the Song period, the odometer vehicle was also combined with another old complex mechanical device known as the south-pointing chariot. This device, originally <b>crafted</b> <b>by</b> Ma Jun in the 3rd century, incorporated a differential gear that allowed a figure mounted on the vehicle to always point in the southern direction, no matter how the vehicle's wheels turned about. The concept of the differential gear that was used in this navigational vehicle is now found in modern automobiles in order to apply an equal amount of torque to a car's wheels even when they are rotating at different speeds.|$|E

5|$|In June 1951, {{with peace}} talks {{underway}} in Panmunjom, the Ranger company was employed aggressively in offensive roles {{as a means}} to secure a better position for the UN at the bargaining table. After a number of operations north of the 38th parallel with the 7th Division, on 8 June the Rangers were moved to attack Hill 772, an operation <b>crafted</b> <b>by</b> Allen to win a strategically advantageous high ground position along the front line. That morning, the company, with support from 7th Division artillery, advanced on the hill, which was first blanketed with napalm strikes from U.S. Air Force P-51 Mustangs. Chinese forces resisted sporadically but withdrew {{at the end of the}} day having lost eight men killed and another thirty wounded. Against this the Rangers had lost only seven wounded. On 11 July, the Rangers continued the attack, backed by the 31st RCT who seized high ground near Sanying-ni and forced Chinese troops to retreat further. In this attack, one Ranger was killed and eight were wounded.|$|E
5|$|The band joined Blink-182 for a European trek {{in early}} 2004, at the {{recommendation}} of Blink-182's bassist Mark Hoppus. Cain invited Hoppus to produce the band's sophomore album, and he accepted. In late 2004, the band continued touring internationally with Blink-182, this time in Japan. The group accumulated significant buzz, and were regarded as a must-see act on the Warped Tour 2004. The band recorded their second album, Commit This to Memory at Seedy Underbelly Studios, a suburban home converted into a studio in Los Angeles' Valley Village region. The album was written partially in their hometown of Minneapolis and partially in Los Angeles, during {{a period in which}} Pierre was seeking treatment for alcohol abuse. Commit This to Memory was the first album by the band to feature material <b>crafted</b> <b>by</b> each musician in the group, as previous releases had featured songs written in the years prior to each member joining. For this album, the band also had more time and funds create the album. During the recording of the album, the band embarked on their first headlining tour, The Sub-Par Punk Who Cares Tour 2004. By the end of 2004, the band played in over 270 shows that year.|$|E
