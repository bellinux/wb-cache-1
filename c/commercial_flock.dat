50|$|The Clun Forest is a {{breed of}} {{domestic}} sheep originating {{from the area}} surrounding the Clun Forest in Shropshire, England. Similar {{to many of the}} British breeds of upland sheep, Clun Forest are hardy, adaptable, good foragers, and are long-lived. With sleek heads and wide pelvic structures, Clun Forest ewes lamb easily. The breed has a short to medium-length wool and dark brown faces. They are a multi-purpose animal, kept for meat, wool, and milk. Like other dark faced sheep, Clun produce quality lamb and mutton. However, in contrast to more common meat breeds such as Suffolks, their wool is free of undesirable black fibres and kemp, and is suitable for handspinning. The breed's alert and stylish appearance, together with its reputation for hardiness and fecundity have made it popular with hobby farmers and large <b>commercial</b> <b>flock</b> owners alike.The Official Clun Sheep Breeders Society Show & Sale for males and females is held annually in early September at Ludlow livestock market by McCartneys.|$|E

Light Turkey Syndrome (LTS) {{is characterized by}} lower than expected body weights of tom turkey flocks at market. Turkey producers have taken notice of LTS {{over the last five}} years. During brooding from two to three weeks of age is when weight gains begin to fall below what had previously been achieved. Speculation suggests that lighter poults are experiencing a different set of factors than the heavier weight poults in <b>commercial</b> <b>flocks.</b> The hypothesis for the field study was that poults from two weight groups (heavy and light) would have different histopathology scores for the intestine and immune tissue, different pathogens present and different xylose absorption. The objective of the inoculation trial was to determine if inoculated poults raised in research settings would exhibit similar attributes as the poults from the field study. In addition to the factors that had been looked at for the field study; weight gain, feed intake and feed conversion data were also determined. In both studies gut contents was collected for analysis by multiplex RT-PCR for astrovirus, rotavirus, reovirus and by culture methods for Salmonella, Campylobacter, E. coli and total plate counts for aerobic, anaerobic, lactobacilli and heterofermentative lactobacilli. Intestinal tissue was collected for scoring of heterophilic and lymphocytic infiltrates and select immune tissue was also scored. Xylose absorption was measured in plasma samples at zero and 60 minutes post gavage. Samples were collected at one, two and three weeks of age in the field study from four MN <b>commercial</b> <b>flocks,</b> two ND <b>commercial</b> <b>flocks</b> and two MN research flocks. Samples were collected at 14 days of age (seven days post inoculation) in the inoculation trial. For both studies more differences were seen between the different flocks than between the heavy and light weight groups. Salmonella and astrovirus were found in all flocks in the field study but reovirus was only found in two of the MN <b>commercial</b> <b>flocks.</b> In the field study histological differences were seen between weight groups with two flocks having an increased acute immune response in the light weight and heavy poults in all flocks showing increased lymphocytes in the intestinal tissue. For immune tissue lymphocytic necrosis and atrophy of the bursa were present in more light weight poults than heavy weight poults. Xylose absorption was increased in heavy weight poults in three of the <b>commercial</b> <b>flocks</b> when compared to light weight poults. In the inoculation trial control poults had the best weight gain and feed conversion with poults gavaged with the inoculums from <b>commercial</b> <b>flocks</b> having the worst. Heterophilic infiltrates were the highest in the control poults and lymphocytic infiltrates were highest in the light weight poults. Lymphocytic necrosis was found in more of the light weight poults. No differences were seen in xylose absorption between the heavy, light and control groups in the inoculation trial. Light turkey syndrome cannot be easily defined by a specific pathogen’s presence though a few different pathogens may likely {{play a role in the}} reduced weight gain seen in LTS poults. Histologically the gut and immune tissue indicate active immune responses that are decreasing the amount of nutrients available for growth of the bird. Nutrient absorption only appears to be negatively affected if the poult is actively showing signs of disease...|$|R

40|$|Scrapie is one {{of several}} {{transmissible}} spongiform encephalopathies of livestock. Disease susceptibility is linked to polymorphisms in the normal prion protein gene that encodes the mammalian prion precursor. Codon 171 of this gene is a major determinant of scrapie susceptibility. Selection for arginine (R) at codon 171 is encouraged by the USDA to decrease the incidence of scrapie. Objectives of this study were to determine the frequency of R allele variants at codon 171 in a sample of sheep from five breeds (Columbia, Hampshire, Rambouillet, Suffolk, and Targhee) and western white-faced commercial ewes and to determine whether the R allele is associated with ewe and lamb production traits. Genotyping was performed on 532 ewes and 901 lambs from the University of Wyoming flock, in addition to 820 rams from 52 sheep producers from Wyoming and surrounding areas, using a DNA mismatch assay that discriminated the R allele from others at codon 171. Genotyping was performed byDNA sequencing on 127 rams representing all breeds, except Hampshire from the USDA Sheep Experiment Station at Dubois, ID. The 171 R allele was found in all five breeds and in the commercial western white-faced ewes. Genotype frequencies varied (P 3 ̆c 0. 001) by breed in ewe and ram populations. Influence of R-allele frequency on ewe lambing records and individual lamb records was analyzed for Columbia (62, 161, 121), Hampshire (89, 193, 162), Rambouillet (87, 179, 133), Suffolk (67, 178, 161), and commercial sheep (227, 463, 324) for numbers of ewes, total number of ewe production records, and individual lamb records, respectively. Suffolk ewes without the R allele (non-R/non-R) gave birth to more (P ≤ 0. 005) multiple lambs than heterozygous non-R/R ewes. Homozygous non-R/non-R Suffolk ewes weaned lighter (P = 0. 02) individual lambs but more (P = 0. 03) total weight of lamb than heterozygous non-R/R ewes. Although ewes genotyped homozygous non-R/non-R or heterozygous non-R/R at codon 171 from the <b>commercial</b> <b>flock</b> gave birth to more (P ≤ 0. 002) multiple lambs than ewes genotyped R/R, differences were not detected (P = 0. 14) in total weight of lamb weaned.

40|$|A West Nile virus (WNV) {{outbreak}} {{occurred at}} a commercial waterfowl operation in Wisconsin in 2005. Retrospective analysis of dead and live birds was conducted. WNV was detected by PCR in 84. 1 % of 88 dead birds; neutralizing antibodies were found in 14 of 30 randomly sampled asymptomatic or recovered birds. West Nile virus (WNV) is a zoonotic pathogen that cycles naturally between wild birds and mosquitoes. Although hundreds of avian species are susceptible to infection, few instances of disease in commercial flocks of domestic or exotic birds have been reported. WNV infection in domestic geese has been documented in Israel (1), Canada (2), and Hungary (3). These outbreaks were characterized by substantial deaths and high seroprevalence rates.
