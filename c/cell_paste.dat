5000|$|Articular {{cartilage}} stem <b>cell</b> <b>paste</b> grafting {{was initially}} described by Kevin R. Stone M.D., a San Francisco-based orthopedic surgeon, in 1997 [...] The technique was devised {{in response to}} reports {{that many of the}} contemporary cartilage restoration procedures lead to the development of fibrocartilage, not true hyaline articular cartilage. Knowing that fibrocartilage was not as durable as articular cartilage and that its formation yielded only short term clinical benefits, Stone proposed his paste grafting as a means of regenerating hyaline-like cartilage. The hypothesis was that harvesting a mixture of articular cartilage and cancellous bone would combine pluripotent cells of the cancellous bone with cartilage extracellular matrix and growth factors and when exposed to continuous motion, hyaline-like cartilage would be stimulated to form.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} methods of {{grafting}} cartilage defects, including periosteal grafting, osteochondral grafting (mosaicplasty), and articular cartilage stem <b>cell</b> <b>paste</b> grafting. Periosteal grafts are harvested from the perichondrial tissue and grafted to the articular cartilage defect. Given low long-term success rates, perichondrial grafting alone {{has not been}} clinically accepted as a particularly excellent therapy. Mosaicplasty, a form of chondral grafting, is a therapy designed to replace cartilage {{on the surface of}} the knee joint that has been damaged by trauma or arthritis by implanting osteochondral plugs. The implants can be autogenic (autologous) or allogenic. Paste grafting involves replacing damaged cartilage with autologous cartilage and cancellous bone from the intercondylar notch in the center of the knee that is first morselized into a paste (typically with hydroxyapatite) to better fill the defect and more successfully promote chondrocyte activity and cartilage formation. These procedures are often performed arthroscopically.|$|E

The enzyme was induced aerobically by 6 H 2 N (1 mM) in Yeast Nitrogen Base (YNB; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) broth {{containing}} 0.5 % glucose as described [Huang et al. 2011]. Briefly, the yeast was grown at 25 °C for 1 d, with shaking, in 200 -ml {{portions of the}} medium placed in 2 -l flasks. E. coli DH 5 α (Takara Bio, Otsu, Japan) and E. coli BL 21 (DE 3) (Takara Bio) were used for plasmid preparation and sequencing and for expression and purification of recombinant CgPAD, respectively.

40|$|AbstractA {{high-throughput}} screening method {{has been developed}} which enables functional analysis of bacteriorhodpsin in whole <b>cell</b> <b>pastes.</b> Reflectance spectra, from as little as 5 ml of Halobacterium salinarum cells, show close correspondence to that obtained from the purified purple membrane (PM), containing bacteriorhodopsin (BR) as the sole protein component. We demonstrate accurate quantification of BR accumulation by ratiometric analysis of BR (Amax 568) and a membrane-bound cytochrome (Amax 410). In addition, ground-state light- and dark-adapted (LA and DA, respectively) spectral differences were determined with high accuracy and precision. Using cells expressing the BR mutant D 85 N, we monitored transitions between intermediate-state homologues of the reprotonation phase of the light-activated proton pumping mechanism. We demonstrate that phenotypes of three mutants (D 85 N/T 170 C, D 85 N/D 96 N, and D 85 N/R 82 Q) previously characterized for their effect on photocycle transitions are reproduced in the whole cell samples. D 85 N/T 170 C stabilizes accumulation of the N state while D 85 N/D 96 N accumulates no N state. D 85 N/R 82 Q {{was found to have}} perturbed the pKa of M accumulation. These studies illustrate the correspondence between pH-dependent ground-state transitions accessed by D 85 N and the transitions accessed by the wild-type protein following photoexcitation.

The charge transfer catalytic behavior of fibrous CNT/Ti counter electrodes to the iodide/triiodide redox pair was carefully studied by electrochemical impedance and current-voltage measurement. The catalytic activity can be enhanced by {{increasing the amount of}} CNT loading on substrate.

40|$|The {{ability of}} some {{microorganisms}} {{to survive a}} stress treatment such as freeze drying {{has been shown to}} improve when aging the cells is done before drying. Hutton and Shirey (1951) de-scribed the beneficial effects of adding filtrates from aged cultures to <b>cell</b> <b>paste</b> of Brucella abortus before freeze drying. Record and Taylor (1953) showed that an exudate of Escherichia coli offered protection to Escherichia coli and to other organ-isms as well. These investigators have suggested that this biological activity is due to a substance from bacteria and that it is effective in relatively small concentrations. We have studied the action of this viability protective factor (VPF) and have separated it from other constituents of the bacterial exudate. Also it has been partially characterized. The work reported here concerns the extraction of VPF from Brucella abortus and the measurement of its activity upon the survival of this organism during freeze drying.

40|$|Light-induced plating (LIP) {{has been}} used to {{evaluate}} solar cells screen-printed on 28 mm × 28 mm multi-crystalline Si (mc-Si) wafers from experimental silver thick-film pastes A and B. Cells were fabricated from paste A using screens with 60, 80, and 100 μm wide line openings. After firing at optimal temperature and measuring electrical performance, the cells were plated using the LIP process. Cell fill factor and efficiency increased noticeably while cell series resistance decreased. The observed efficiency increase ranged from 0. 4 % to 1. 0 % and was due to improved contact resistivity and decreased conductor line resistance. The mechanism for improved performance was elucidated through conductivity measurements and microstructural investigation using advanced scanning electron microscopy. Surface morphology of the silver conductor line obtained from the LIP process is reported. <b>Cells</b> from <b>paste</b> B were printed with a 100 μm wide opening screen. The efficiency of <b>cells</b> printed with <b>paste</b> B using the 100 μm screen followed by the LIP process did not show an efficiency improvement.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} metals were studied in several {{biological}} systems using XRF microscopy and XAS spectroscopy. In chapter two, I examined the budding yeast Sacchromyces cervisiae using XRF microscopy. Using fluorescent stains {{to identify the}} vacuole and the nucleus, {{we were able to}} determine which elements localized where. We found that phosphorus fluorescence was a reasonable surrogate for the nucleus of the cell. Zinc and iron localized to both the vacuole and the nucleus. Sulfur and potassium typically have smooth distributions, and calcium and manganese localized in the vacuole. These results establish the groundwork for the subcellular elemental distributions of yeast grown under normal conditions, allowing for the later exploration of the subcellular localizations of elements under other conditions. 	In chapter three, we examined the effects of cadmium treatment on yeast. The cadmium-treated yeast showed dramatic localizations of copper in the bud and bud neck. The other elements did not show any significant changes in localization compared to the yeast that had not been exposed to cadmium. While iron and zinc did not change their localizations, they did show a significant increase in concentration. X-ray absorption spectroscopy of zinc in yeast <b>cell</b> <b>paste</b> treated with cadmium shows a shift towards sulfur ligation compared to <b>cell</b> <b>paste</b> that was not treated with cadmium. These results suggest that the cellular damage caused by cadmium is a result of an increase in the cell’s free copper, leading to increased oxidative stress. 	Chapter 4 uses XRF microscopy to examine human erythrocytes that have been infected with the malaria parasite. Infected erythrocytes were found to accumulate zinc 3 - 6 fold in excess when compared to uninfected cells. This accumulated zinc was found to be localized close to, but not overlapping with, the iron localization of the hemozoin crystal.

40|$|A {{nucleic acid}} {{affinity}} matrix containing a short oligodeoxynucleotide ligand has been prepared {{as an example}} of a material which can be used for the rapid and effective isolation of sequence specific DNA binding proteins. Two complementary oligodeoxynucleotides have been employed, one of which contains a small 5 '-spacer arm with a terminal thiol group.

40|$|Diffusing Wave Spectroscopy (DWS) was {{studied as}} a method of {{laboratory}} analysis of sub-micron particles, and developed as a prospective in-line, industrial, process control sensor, capable of near real-time feedback. No sample pre-treatment was required and measurement was via a non-invasive, flexible, dip in probe. DWS relies on the concept of the diffusive migration of light, as opposed to the ballistic scatter model used in conventional dynamic light scattering. The specific requirements of the optoelectronic hardware, data analysis methods and light scattering model were studied experimentally and, where practical, theoretically resulting in a novel technique of analysis of particle suspensions and emulsions of volume fractions between 0. 01 and 0. 4. Operation at high concentrations made the technique oblivious to dust and contamination. A pure homodyne (autodyne) experimental arrangement described was resilient to environmental disturbances, unlike many other systems which utilise optical fibres or heterodyne operation. Pilot and subsequent prototype development led to a highly accurate method of size ranking, suitable for analysis {{of a wide range of}} suspensions and emulsions. The technique was shown to operate on real industrial samples with statistical variance as low as 0. 3 % with minimal software processing. Whilst the application studied was the analysis of TiO_ 2 suspensions, a diverse range of materials including polystyrene beads, <b>cell</b> <b>pastes</b> and industrial cutting fluid emulsions were tested. Results suggest that, whilst all sizing should be comparative to suitable standards, concentration effects may be minimised and even completely modelled-out in many applications. Adhesion to the optical probe was initially a significant problem but was minimised after the evaluation and use of suitable non stick coating materials. Unexpected behaviour in the correlation in the region of short decay times led to consideration of the effects of rotational diffusion coefficient. The inherent instability of high density suspensions instigated high speed analysis techniques capable of monitoring suspensions that were undergoing rapid change as well as suggesting novel methods for the evaluation of the state of sample dispersion.
