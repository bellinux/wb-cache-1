The twenty samples are good enough for the maximum <b>continuous</b> <b>package</b> losses.|$|E
30|$|For the interpolation, it is {{observed}} that in the pre-fault and post-fault states, the lost data can be efficiently estimated (TVE < 1 %), whereas in the faulty state, the estimation error is acceptable only in the scenario of one or two <b>continuous</b> <b>package</b> losses.|$|E
30|$|Further, {{this paper}} takes {{advantages}} of OpenPDC and FNET/GridEye, and shows real-world data quality issues including synchronization signal accuracy, synchrophasor data loss, and latency. The related statistical results and analysis suggest although the data quality issues are random and variable, {{the majority of}} GPS loss events recover within {{a short period of}} time and about 95 % of data loss events involve only one to three <b>continuous</b> <b>package</b> losses. These points will be further discussed, and the potential reasons and solutions will be presented in part II.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with robust stabilization problem for a class of nonaffine pure-feedback systems with unknown time-delay functions and perturbed uncertainties. Novel <b>continuous</b> <b>packaged</b> functions are introduced in advance to remove unknown nonlinear terms deduced from perturbed uncertainties and unknown time-delay functions, which avoids the functions with control law to be approximated by radial basis function (RBF) neural networks. This technique combining implicit function and mean value theorems overcomes the difficulty in controlling the nonaffine pure-feedback systems. Dynamic surface control (DSC) is used to avoid “the explosion of complexity” in the backstepping design. Design difficulties from unknown time-delay functions are overcome using the function separation technique, the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals, and the desirable property of hyperbolic tangent functions. RBF neural networks are employed to approximate desired virtual controls and desired practical control. Under the proposed adaptive neural DSC, the number of adaptive parameters required is reduced significantly, and semiglobal uniform ultimate boundedness {{of all of the}} signals in the closed-loop system is guaranteed. Simulation studies are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design scheme. Min Wang, Xiaoping Liu, and Peng Sh...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} a {{technology}} of <b>continuous</b> <b>packaging</b> machine in the beginning {{from the point of}} risk assessment and design of necessary measures to reduce the risk {{as much as it is}} possible. Here the HRN method was used to quantify every risk factor. Next part documents the implementation of the safety measures and the realization of the safety circuits by using Simatic S 7 – 1500 F safety PLC and Shared device functionality. Safety function which is realized in the Sinamics S 120 drive is Safe Stop 1. Next, it describes the drive dimensioning and the principle of the drive control.

40|$|Modern optical {{analytics}} {{require more}} and more compact and cost-effective modules for analysis of surfaces, solids, thin films, powders, pastes, gels, liquids and alike. Thereby a fast and non-invasive measurement is often necessary. Microsystem technology, more precisely Micro-Opto-Electro-Mechanical System (MOEMS) technology is suitable for the realization of such modules. Different miniaturized optical analyzers employing MOEMS have been developed at the Fraunhofer Institute for Reliability and Microintegration (IZM) {{in collaboration with the}} Center for Microtechnologies (ZfM) and the company COLOUR CONTROL Farbmesstechnik GmbH. These devices are based on the principle of spectral sensing in the infrared range. Due to the requirement of compact dimensions and short optical paths a high packaging accuracy is necessary. In the development process different setups with a <b>continuous</b> <b>packaging</b> improvement have been realized. The first packaging principle was based on particularly assembled laser-cut stainless steel sheets and optical standard components. The design requires exact positioning of the functional elements to attain a sufficient optical resolution. The reduction of the active components by means of monolithic combinations was one improvement. Further progress could be achieved by a package made of aluminum cast, whose models were provided using modern methods of rapid prototyping. Consequently adjustment tolerances will be minimized and the vibration stability will be increased. During the development process, simulations and characterization of the system are essential to obtain necessary improvements. Thereby an evaluation of the packaging accuracy regarding its influence on the defocus was made. According to precision and reproducibility, the optical and electrical performance are being tested...|$|R
30|$|It is {{observed}} from Fig.  9 a and b {{that the data}} loss events randomly occur and are often accompanied by high communication delays. Also, the data loss events display diverse scenarios but 95 % of them only involve one to three <b>continuous</b> <b>package</b> losses. This implies that the large amounts of package losses are small probability events. In addition, it is found from Fig.  9 a and c that the communication delay may vary dramatically in short terms (e.g., one minute) and its probability distribution changes with time periods (i.e. hourly, daily, and weekly). The real-time communication delay presents strong dynamic characteristics.|$|E
40|$|A {{description}} is given of an experimental facility for investigating man-machine system design problems. The facility {{is called the}} COED (Computer Operated Electronic Display). It combines a vety large capacity cathode ray tube (Digitron) with a high-speed computer (IBM 704). The components, programming, and uses of the device are described. Simulators, presenting in a simplified form the basic variables underlying a task, have long been used as training aids and as devices for human factor experimentation. Recently, at the Bendix Systems Division, a simulator facility has been developed for experimentation on very broad classes of man-machine system problems. Requirements for the device were stated as follows: Extreme flexibility to simulate the display configurations and control characteristics of aircraft, helicopters, spaceships, and other man-machine vehicle systems. Ability to present {{a wide variety of}} feed-back dynamics linking operator inputs to the vehicles ’ responses. Ability to respond to operator’s com-mands without appreciable lag. Ability to provide sufficient documenta-tion of the display and control events to permit adequate experimental analyses. COED CONSTRUCTION A block diagram of COED is shown in Fig. 2. The COED system has the following components: A. Cathode ray tube and character generator which provides the display. B. Drum buffer and “Read Drum Continuous ” package which functions as an electronic adapter be-tween the IBM and cathode ray tube equip-ment.

Many <b>continuous</b> modelling <b>packages,</b> particularly finite element (FE) and continuous fluid dynamics (CFD) packages, produce impressive graphical outputs. These outputs can easily lull the viewer into {{a false sense}} of security, and lead the viewer to forget that every measurement should have an associated uncertainty. The need for uncertainties to be associated with model results and visualisations of results leads to two questions that need to be asked for each visualisation: What is the uncertainty associated with the visualisation process? How can uncertainties derived from continuous models be visualised most effectively? This report aims to answer these questions.

A system from the "real world" is used {{as the basis for the}} simulation modelling technique that is presented.

A method is developed that utilizes the discrete simulation ability of a stochastic package (ARENA), in conjunction with a deterministic package (FORTRAN), to model the <b>continuous</b> system.

40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{the analysis of}} experimental data, verifying the applicability of signal analysis techniques for condition monitoring of a packaging machine. In particular, the activity focuses on the cutting process that divides a <b>continuous</b> flow of <b>packaging</b> paper into single packages. The cutting process is made by a steel knife driven by a hydraulic system. Actually, the knives are frequently substituted, causing frequent stops of the machine and consequent lost production costs. The aim {{of this paper is}} to develop a diagnostic procedure to assess the wearing condition of blades, reducing the stops for maintenance. The packaging machine was provided with pressure sensor that monitors the hydraulic system driving the blade. Processing the pressure data comprises three main steps: the selection of scalar quantities that could be indicative of the condition of the knife. A clustering analysis was used to set up a threshold between unfaulted and faulted knives. Finally, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model was applied to classify the technical condition of knife during its lifetime...|$|R

Furthermore UNICOS has been formalized and its supervision layer has been reused in other kinds of applications (e. g. monitoring or supervisory tasks) where a control layer is not necessarily UNICOS oriented. The process control package has been reformulated as the UNICOS CPC <b>package</b> (<b>Continuous</b> Process Control) and a reengineering process has been followed.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Department of Biological Systems Engineering, Washington State UniversityMicrowave heating {{is a novel}} {{technology}} that has advantages in reducing heating time and improving food quality. A 915 MHz single-mode microwave assisted thermal sterilization (MATS) system was developed at Washington State University with ultimate goal of industrial applications. This research addresses several engineering issues in future scaling-up of the MATS technology. A major challenge in developing microwave thermal processing has been non-uniform heating patterns which can result in cold and hot spots. The non-uniform heating pattern {{is caused by the}} uneven electric field distribution. In this study, computer simulation method was used to analyze the electric field distribution and its components in each direction within a MATS system. The dominant electric field component was in y direction which could be reformed by adjusting the dimensions of Ultem window and horn applicator in y direction or placing metal/Ultem bars within the horn applicators. In developing a microwave assisted thermal process, time-temperature profile at the cold spot is recorded to establish the process schedule to control most heat resistant food pathogens. Compared with fragile fiber-optic sensor, a mobile metallic temperature sensor is more suitable for <b>continuous</b> moving <b>packages.</b> However, interaction might occur between the metallic temperature sensor and the electromagnetic field. Thus another main objective of this work was to study the performance of a mobile metallic sensor within microwave environment. Results showed that a mobile metallic temperature sensor could be used for temperature measurement in the MATS system with suitable probe orientation. Certain design features, such as round probe tip and thinner probe diameter, could improve the sensor accuracy used in microwave environment. Dummy loads provide consistent dielectric properties for power delivery and system stability tests of a microwave heating system in production. The low cost bentonite water paste with high thermal stability was used to develop reusable dummy load for industrial microwave heating systems. Dielectric properties of bentonite pastes of various compositions were measured over 300 to 3000 MHz and 20 to 120 ºC. Vegetable oil and salt were used to adjust the dielectric constant and loss factor of bentonite pastes to match dielectric properties of different food materials.

40|$|With the <b>continuous</b> {{increase}} of <b>packaging</b> density, the electronic component size and, in particular, {{the thickness of}} the involved interconnections decrease significantly. In addition, the microsystem interconnects usually include even finer internal structures. The wide range of size differences is a challenge for the in-depth analysis of the reliability of such components. To this end, an interface model has been developed based on micropolar theory, including the concept of regularized strong discontinuity in order to model the interconnections considered as an interface of finite thickness. A second order homogenization strategy has been adopted in the model development, including a Taylor expansion of the displacement field to describe the coupling of the mechanical macro- and micro-responses. The involved representative volume element (RVE) has been chosen according to a typical structure in the adhesive interface. Thereby, the internal length and material parameters of the microstructure of the interconnect are involved in the macroscopic constitutive equations. The multi-scale character of the interconnect problems, such as in anisotropic conductive adhesive (ACA) interconnects, {{plays an important role in}} the proper stress-strain analysis. For model verification, the deformation fields of the plastic ball grid array (PBGA) component joints under thermal loading have been observed by a 4 M interferometer. The comparison between the micropolar model simulation and experimental data shows a good agreement. Finally, a delamination model has been developed for the interconnect degeneration. A cohesive zone model is included to describe the failure process. The crack initiation and propagation of an anisotropic conductive film (ACF) microstructure under thermal cycling has been simulated, and reliability analysis has been made...|$|R
40|$|Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) is not {{commonly}} used to study lake ice, and in general, the ground-based use of radar frequencies greater than 500 MHz in cryosphere geophysics is rare, due to a general interest in deeper stratigraphy {{and the difficulty of}} extensive profiling over rough snow surfaces. Our goal was to find further information on the origin of the deposition and formation of intra-ice layers, bottom topography, and subbottom deposits using GPR with pulses centered near 850 MHz on two permanently ice-covered lakes in the Mc- Murdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica. The profiles were obtained using a one-person sled operation over Lake Bonney, which is typical of lakes in the region, having an ice thickness that ranges between 3 and 5 m, and Lake Vida, where the maximum ice depth is at least 27 m. Lake Bonney exhibits a semicontinuous sediment horizon at approximately a 2 -m depth and several minor horizons. In contrast, Lake Vida contains unconformably eroded and folded <b>continuous</b> reflection horizons, <b>packages</b> of minor horizons between major horizons, evidence of incised fluvial deposition along the bottom, and subbottom penetration of at least 4. 5 m in some areas. Where the ice thickness is less than 20 m, the lake is frozen to the bottom. Most horizon waveform phase attributes indicate relatively lower permittivity than in the surrounding matrix. Consequently, we interpreted these strata to be caused by layers of pure ice embedded within a salty and dirty ice matrix, which were formed during minor flooding. These findings supported previous conclusions that Lake Vida ice formed from surface runoff in combination with periods of ablation...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} ocean {{acidification}} on benthic habitats {{is a major}} preoccupation of the scientific community. However, the natural variability of pCO 2 and pH in those habitats remains understudied, especially in temperate areas. In this study we investigated temporal variations of the carbonate system in nearshore macrophyte meadows of the western Baltic Sea. These are key benthic ecosystems, providing spawning and nursery areas as well as food to numerous commercially important species. In situ pCO 2, pH (total scale), salinity and PAR irradiance were measured with a <b>continuous</b> recording sensor <b>package</b> dropped in a shallow macrophyte meadow (Eckernförde bay, western Baltic Sea) during three different weeks in July (pCO 2 and PAR only), August and September 2011. The mean (± SD) pCO 2 in July was 383 ± 117 µatm. The mean (± SD) pCO 2 and pH(tot) in August were 239 ± 20 µatm and 8. 22 ± 0. 1, respectively. The mean (± SD) pCO 2 and pH(tot) in September were 1082 ± 711 µatm and 7. 83 ± 0. 40, respectively. Daily variations of pCO 2 due to photosynthesis and respiration (difference between daily maximum and minimum) were of the same order of magnitude: 281 ± 88 µatm, 219 ± 89 μatm and 1488 ± 574 µatm in July, August and September respectively. The observed variations of pCO 2 were explained through a statistical model considering wind direction and speed together with PAR irradiance. At a time scale of days to weeks, local upwelling of elevated pCO 2 water masses with offshore winds drives the variation. Within days, primary production is responsible. The results demonstrate the high variability of the carbonate system in nearshore macrophyte meadows depending on meteorology and biological activities. We highlight the need to incorporate these variations in future pCO 2 scenarios and experimental designs for nearshore habitats...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{annual cost}} of {{morbidity}} and mortality due to medication errors‎ in the U. S. has been estimated at $ 76. 6 billion. Information technology implemented systematically has the potential to significantly reduce medication errors that result in adverse drug events ‎(ADEs). ‎ Objective: To develop a computer simulation model {{that can be used to}} evaluate the effectiveness‎ of information technology applications designed to detect and prevent medication errors that result in adverse drug effects. ‎ Methods: A computer simulation model was constructed representing the medication delivery‎ system in a hospital. STELLA, a <b>continuous</b> simulation software <b>package,</b> was used to construct the model. Parameters of the model were estimated from a study of prescription errors on two hospital medical/surgical units and used in the baseline simulation. Five prevention strategies were simulated based on information obtained from the literature. ‎ Results: The model simulates the four stages of the medication delivery system: prescribing, transcribing,‎ dispensing, and administering drugs. We simulated interventions that have been demonstrated in prior studies to decrease error rates. The results suggest that an integrated medication delivery system can save up to 1, 226 days of excess hospitalization and $ 1. 4 million in associated costs annually in a large hospital. The results of the analyses regarding the effects of the interventions‎ on the additional hospital costs associated with ADEs are somewhat sensitive to the distribution of errors in the hospital, more sensitive to the costs of an ADE, and most sensitive to the proportion of medication errors resulting in ADEs. ‎ Conclusions: The results suggest that clinical information systems are potentially a cost-effective means of preventing ADEs in hospitals and demonstrate the importance of viewing medication errors from a systems perspective. Prevention efforts that focus on a single stage of the process had limited impact on the overall error rate. This study suggests that system-wide changes to the medication delivery system are required to drastically reduce mediation errors that may result in ADEs in a hospital setting. ...|$|R
