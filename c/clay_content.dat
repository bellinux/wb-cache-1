5|$|Telopea oreades needs a well-drained {{location}} as well {{as reliable}} moisture to thrive. Soil with some <b>clay</b> <b>content</b> is beneficial. It is more shade-tolerant than the more popular New South Wales waratah, preferring part-shade but tolerating sunny aspects. It tolerates moderate frosts. Plants can be hard-pruned—lopping old stems and branches can rejuvenate mature plants. Plants can benefit from low-phosphorus fertilizer applied in spring and autumn. Propagation is by seed, the germination rates of which fall significantly after several months' storage unless refrigerated, or by cuttings of new growth that has just hardened. Cultivars must be propagated by cutting to make daughter plants identical to the parent.|$|E
5|$|Once in the environment, {{neptunium}} generally oxidizes fairly quickly, {{usually to}} the +4 or +5 state. Regardless of its oxidation state, the element exhibits {{a much greater}} mobility than the other actinides, largely due to its ability to readily form aqueous solutions with various other elements. In one study comparing the diffusion rates of neptunium(V), plutonium(IV), and americium(III) in sandstone and limestone, neptunium penetrated more than ten times {{as well as the}} other elements. Np(V) will also react efficiently in pH levels greater than 5.5 if there are no carbonates present and in these conditions it has also been observed to readily bond with quartz. It has also been observed to bond well with goethite, ferric oxide colloids, and several clays including kaolinite and smectite. Np(V) does not bond as readily to soil particles in mildly acidic conditions as its fellow actinides americium and curium by nearly an order of magnitude. This behavior enables it to migrate rapidly through the soil while in solution without becoming fixed in place, contributing further to its mobility. Np(V) is also readily absorbed by concrete, which because of the element's radioactivity is a consideration that must be addressed when building nuclear waste storage facilities. When absorbed in concrete, it is reduced to Np(IV) in a relatively short period of time. Np(V) is also reduced by humic acid if it is present on the surface of goethite, hematite, and magnetite. Np(IV) is absorbed efficiently by tuff, granodiorite, and bentonite; although uptake by the latter is most pronounced in mildly acidic conditions. It also exhibits a strong tendency to bind to colloidal particulates, an effect that is enhanced when in soil with a high <b>clay</b> <b>content.</b> The behavior provides an additional aid in the element's observed high mobility.|$|E

5|$|The {{western end}} of the area (around Nempnett Thrubwell) {{consists}} of the Harptree Beds which incorporate silicified clay, shale and Lias Limestone. Clifton Down Limestone, which includes Calcite and Dolomitic mudstones of the Carboniferous period, {{is found in the}} adjoining central band and Dolomitic Conglomerate of the Triassic period. There are two main soil types, both generally well-drained. The mudstones around the lakes give rise to fertile silty clay soils that are a dull dusky red colour because of their high iron content. The <b>clay</b> <b>content</b> means that where unimproved they easily become waterlogged when wet, and hard with cracks and fissures during dry periods. The main geological outcrops around the lake are Mudstone, largely consisting of red Siltstone resulting in the underlying characteristic of the gently rolling valley landscape. Bands of Sandstone of the Triassic period contribute to the undulating character of the area. There are also more recent alluvial deposits beside the course of the River Chew. The transition between the gently sloping landscape of the Upper Chew and Yeo Valleys and the open landscape of the Mendip Hills plateau is a scarp slope of 75 to 235 metres (250–770ft). The predominant formation is Dolomitic Conglomerate of the Triassic period. It formed as a result of desert erosion and weathering of the scarp slopes. It takes the form of rock fragments mainly derived from older Carboniferous Limestone cemented together by lime and sand which hardened to give the appearance of concrete. The northern boundary is formed by the sides of the Dundry Plateau where the most significant geological formation is the Inferior Oolite of the Jurassic period found on the higher ground around Maes Knoll. This overlays the Lower Lias Clay found on the adjoining slopes. The clays make a poor foundation and landslips are characteristic on the slopes. This area was once connected to the Cotswolds. The intervening land has subsequently been eroded leaving this outlier with the characteristics of the Cotswold Plateau. The unusual geological features have been recognised as Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) for their geological interest including Barns Batch Spinney, Hartcliff Rocks Quarry and Dundry Main Road South Quarry.|$|E

40|$|Investigating the {{influences}} of soil characteristic factors on dinoseb adsorption parameter with different statistical methods would be valuable to explicitly figure out the extent of these influences. The correlation coefficients and the direct, indirect effects of soil characteristic factors on dinoseb adsorption parameter were analyzed through bivariate correlation analysis, and path analysis. With stepwise regression analysis the factors which had little influence on the adsorption parameter were excluded. Results indicate that pH and CEC had moderate relationship and lower direct effect on dinoseb adsorption parameter due to the multicollinearity with other soil factors, and organic carbon and <b>clay</b> <b>contents</b> {{were found to be}} the most significant soil factors which affect the dinoseb adsorption process. A regression is thereby set up to explore the relationship between the dinoseb adsorption parameter and the two soil factors: the soil organic carbon and <b>clay</b> <b>contents.</b> A 92 % of the variation of dinoseb sorption coefficient could be attributed to the variation of the soil organic carbon and <b>clay</b> <b>contents...</b>|$|R
40|$|Conventional soil {{sampling}} methods to obtain high-resolution soil data are labour intensive and costly. Recently, gamma ray spectrometry {{has emerged as}} a promising technique to overcome these obstacles. The objective of our study was to investigate the prediction of soil <b>clay</b> <b>contents</b> using gamma-ray spectrometry in three marine clay districts in the Netherlands: the southwestern marine district (SMD), the IJsselmeerpolder district (IJPD) and the northern marine district (NMD). The performance of linear regression models was investigated at field (1000 km 2) scales and for all the Dutch marine districts together. For this study, a database was available with 1371 gamma-ray spectra measured on arable fields in marine clay districts during the period 2005 – 2008 and these were all linked to laboratory analyses of <b>clay</b> <b>contents.</b> At the field scale, linear regression models based on 40 K, 232 Th, or a combination of these revealed much smaller root mean squared error (RMSE) values (2 – 3 %) compared with a model based on the field mean (8 – 10 %). At the district scale, the regression models for the SMD and IJPD, which have comparable sediments, performed better than for the NMD. This indicates that the prediction of <b>clay</b> <b>contents</b> in late Holocene marine sediments may be made with gamma-ray spectrometry provided that the origin of the parent material results in a unique fingerprint. Because of the heterogeneous parent material of all marine districts taken together, our study shows that no unique and precise fingerprint exists, and the RMSE of 6 % between <b>clay</b> <b>contents</b> and gamma-ray spectra is not much different from the RMSE of 7 % when using the overall mean as a predictor...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Nanocomposites {{with high}} density {{polyethylene}} (HDPE) /nanoclay/bamboo flour were fabricated by melt compounding.

The addition of compatibilizer also improved the thermal stability of HDPE/bamboo composites, but the effect was less significant than clay. It seems that there is no much difference in the thermal behaviors between HDPE/nanoclay/bamboo systems with and without the addition of compatibilizer. The activation energy values varied very little for different <b>clay</b> <b>contents</b> in the composites.

Much emphasis {{has been placed on}} the chemical properties of soils on which rice is grown while there is sparse information on the effect of soil physical properties on grain yield of rice. Field experiments were conducted on upland and wetland soils as they relate to water management for rice production in Nigeria. Results showed that soils with higher <b>clay</b> <b>contents</b> in the top and sub-soils gave higher grain yields of rice compared with soils that are of sandy texture. In terms of agro-climatic characteristics Nigeria could be classified as being highly suitable (S 1) for rice cultivation. However, considering the top and subsoil <b>clay</b> <b>contents,</b> these soils are only marginally suitable (S 3) for rice production. Soil texture, soil surface relief, groundwater level, as well as number of days of submergence significantly affected the growth and grain yield of rice on lowland soils while <b>clay</b> <b>contents</b> in the subsoil is a significant factor in water retention for upland rice cultivars.

25|$|Laterite soils {{have a high}} <b>clay</b> <b>content,</b> which {{mean they}} have higher Cation Exchange Capacity and water-holding {{capacity}} than sandy soils. However, if the structure of lateritic soils becomes degraded, a hard crust can form on the surface, which hinders water infiltration, the emergence of seedlings, and leads to increased runoff. It is possible to rehabilitate such soils, using a system called the 'bio-reclamation of degraded lands'. This involves using indigenous water-harvesting methods (such as planting pits and trenches), applying animal and plant residues, and planting high-value fruit trees and indigenous vegetable crops that are tolerant of drought conditions. They are good for tea, coffee and cashew cultivation. The International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) has employed this system to rehabilitate degraded laterite soils in Niger and increase smallholder farmers' incomes.|$|E
25|$|Soil {{types are}} highly {{variable}} in the tropics and {{are the result of}} a combination of several variables such as climate, vegetation, topographic position, parent material, and soil age. Most tropical soils are characterized by significant leaching and poor nutrients, however there are some areas that contain fertile soils. Soils throughout the tropical rainforests fall into two classifications which include the ultisols and oxisols. Ultisols are known as well weathered, acidic red clay soils, deficient in major nutrients such as calcium and potassium. Similarly, oxisols are acidic, old, typically reddish, highly weathered and leached, however are well drained compared to ultisols. The <b>clay</b> <b>content</b> of ultisols is high, making it difficult for water to penetrate and flow through. The reddish color of both soils is the result of heavy heat and moisture forming oxides of iron and aluminium, which are insoluble in water and not taken up readily by plants.|$|E

2500|$|Unaided plant roots may {{be unable}} to take up {{nutrients}} that are chemically or physically immobilised; examples include phosphate ions and micronutrients such as iron. One form of such immobilization occurs in soil with high <b>clay</b> <b>content,</b> or soils with a strongly basic pH. The mycelium of the mycorrhizal fungus can, however, access many such nutrient sources, and make them available to the plants they colonize. Thus many plants are able to obtain phosphate, without using soil as a source. Another form of immobilisation is when nutrients are locked up in organic matter that is slow to decay, such as wood, and some mycorrhizal fungi act directly as decay organisms, mobilising the nutrients and passing some onto the host plants; for example, in some dystrophic forests, large amounts of phosphate and other nutrients are taken up by mycorrhizal hyphae acting directly on leaf litter, bypassing the need for soil uptake. [...] Inga alley cropping, proposed as an alternative to slash and burn rainforest destruction, relies upon mycorrhiza within the Inga Tree root system to prevent the rain from washing phosphorus out of the soil.|$|E
