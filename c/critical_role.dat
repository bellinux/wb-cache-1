5|$|Although often inconspicuous, fungi {{occur in}} every {{environment}} on Earth and play very {{important roles in}} most ecosystems. Along with bacteria, fungi are the major decomposers in most terrestrial (and some aquatic) ecosystems, and therefore play a <b>critical</b> <b>role</b> in biogeochemical cycles and in many food webs. As decomposers, they play {{an essential role in}} nutrient cycling, especially as saprotrophs and symbionts, degrading organic matter to inorganic molecules, which can then re-enter anabolic metabolic pathways in plants or other organisms.|$|E

When the NDRC was formed, the Committee on Uranium was placed under it, reporting directly to Bush as the Uranium Committee. Bush reorganized the committee, strengthening its scientific component by adding Tuve, George B. Pegram, Jesse W. Beams, Ross Gunn and Harold Urey. When the OSRD was formed in June 1941, the Uranium Committee was again placed directly under Bush. For security reasons, its name was changed to the S-1 Section.|$|E
5|$|Electrons are {{important}} in cathode ray tubes, which have been extensively used as display devices in laboratory instruments, computer monitors and television sets. In a photomultiplier tube, every photon striking the photocathode initiates an avalanche of electrons that produces a detectable current pulse. Vacuum tubes use the flow of electrons to manipulate electrical signals, and they played a <b>critical</b> <b>role</b> {{in the development of}} electronics technology. However, they have been largely supplanted by solid-state devices such as the transistor.|$|E

In these roles, cell-cell adhesion must be adaptable and, {{depending on the}} biological circumstance, weak, dynamic or strong. Different adhesion structures (adherens junctions, tight junctions, desmosomes) regulate cell-cell adhesion, and each comprises distinct membrane-bound adhesion proteins that interact with the cytoskeleton. Of the proteins that form these adhesion structures, the Ca++-dependent classical cadherins found in adherens junctions have <b>critical</b> <b>roles</b> in controlling the specificity, organization, and dynamics of cell-cell adhesions.

5|$|Histological {{examination}} {{reveals that}} pachycephalosaurid domes {{are composed of}} a unique form of fibrolamellar bone which contains fibroblasts that play a <b>critical</b> <b>role</b> in wound healing, and are capable of rapidly depositing bone during remodeling. Peterson et al. (2013) concluded that taken together, the frequency of lesion distribution and the bone structure of frontoparietal domes, lends strong support to the hypothesis that pachycephalosaurids used their unique cranial structures for agonistic behavior. CT scan comparisons of the skulls of Stegoceras validum, Prenocephale prenes, and several head-striking artiodactyls have also supported pachycephalosaurids as being well-equipped for head-butting.|$|E
5|$|Historian Wilson D. Miscamble {{argues that}} Kennan played a <b>critical</b> <b>role</b> in {{developing}} the foreign policies of the Truman administration. He also states that Kennan {{did not believe in}} either global or strongpoint containment; he simply wanted to restore the balance of power between the United States and the Soviets. Like historian John Lewis Gaddis, Miscamble concedes that although Kennan personally preferred political containment, his recommendations ultimately resulted in a policy directed more toward strongpoint than to global containment.|$|E

5|$|Interstellar {{molecules}} {{are formed}} by chemical reactions within very sparse interstellar or circumstellar {{clouds of dust}} and gas. Usually this occurs when a molecule becomes ionized, often {{as the result of}} an interaction with a cosmic ray. This positively charged molecule then draws in a nearby reactant by electrostatic attraction of the neutral molecule's electrons. Molecules can also be generated by reactions between neutral atoms and molecules, although this process is generally slower. The dust plays a <b>critical</b> <b>role</b> of shielding the molecules from the ionizing effect of ultraviolet radiation emitted by stars.|$|E
5|$|Loss of cell {{viability}} in the jack jumper's venom was researched through cytometry, which measures {{the proportions of}} cells that glow {{in the presence of}} fluorescent dye and 7-Aminoactinomycin D. Examinations of the rapidly reproducing Epstein–Barr B-cells showed that the cells lost viability within minutes when exposed to pilosulin 1. Normal white blood cells were also found to alter easily when exposed to pilosulin 1. However, partial peptides of pilosulin 1 were less efficient at lowering {{cell viability}}; the residue 22 N-terminal plays a <b>critical</b> <b>role</b> in the cytotoxic activity of pilosulin 1.|$|E

5|$|Most natural {{membranes}} are {{a complex}} mixture of different lipid molecules. If {{some of the}} components are liquid at a given temperature while others are in the gel phase, the two phases can coexist in spatially separated regions, rather like an iceberg floating in the ocean. This phase separation plays a <b>critical</b> <b>role</b> in biochemical phenomena because membrane components such as proteins can partition into {{one or the other}} phase and thus be locally concentrated or activated. One particularly important component of many mixed phase systems is cholesterol, which modulates bilayer permeability, mechanical strength, and biochemical interactions.|$|E
5|$|On the Danubian plains {{north of}} Vienna, the summer battles of Aspern-Essling and Wagram shaped {{the outcome of}} the 1809 campaign. Klenau's forces played a <b>critical</b> <b>role</b> at both. At Aspern-Essling, Napoleon's army was decisively {{defeated}} {{for the first time in}} northern Europe, demonstrating that the master of Europe could himself be mastered. After their defeat at Wagram, the Austrians withdrew into Moravia, leaving the French in control of that part of the Danube valley; Wagram was the largest European land-battle to date, engaging 262 battalions and 202 squadrons—153,000 men—for France and her allies, and 160 battalions and 150 squadrons—135,000 men—on the Austrian side.|$|E
5|$|Stephen {{attacked}} the castle in 1139, initially intending to besiege it, as {{the walls were}} considered impregnable to assault. Brien had brought in considerable supplies – contemporaries believed the castle could survive a siege for several years if need be – and Stephen changed his mind, putting up two counter-castles to contain Wallingford {{along the road to}} Bristol, before continuing west. The next year, Miles of Gloucester, possibly acting under orders from Robert of Gloucester, struck east, destroying one of the counter-castles outside Wallingford. The civil war between Stephen and Matilda rapidly descended into an attritional campaign, in which castles like Wallingford played a <b>critical</b> <b>role</b> in efforts by both sides to secure the Thames Valley. After the fall of Oxford to Stephen in 1141, Matilda fled to Wallingford, and the importance of the castle continued to grow.|$|E

In this review, we have summarized the roles of PKC family members in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). CLL is a heterogeneous hematological disorder with survival ranging from months to decades. PKC isoforms are differentially expressed in CLL and play <b>critical</b> <b>roles</b> in CLL pathogenesis. Thus, isoform-specific PKC inhibitors may be an attractive option for CLL treatment...|$|R
