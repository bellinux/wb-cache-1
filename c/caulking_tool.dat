50|$|The {{earliest}} spigot and socket {{cast iron}} pipes were jointed by filling the socket {{with a mixture}} of water, sand, iron filings and sal-ammoniac (ammonium chloride.) A gasket ring was pushed into the socket round the spigot to contain the mixture which was pounded into the socket with a <b>caulking</b> <b>tool</b> and then pointed off. This took several weeks to set and produced a completely rigid joint. Such pipe systems are often to be seen in nineteenth century churches in the heating system.|$|E

This {{had the effect of}} displacing the metal into a close fit with the adjoining piece. Originally done by hand much like wooden vessel <b>caulking,</b> pneumatic <b>tools</b> were later employed. With the advent of electric-arc welding for ship construction, steel ship caulking was rendered obsolete.|$|R
