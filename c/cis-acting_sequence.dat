40|$|Negative {{feedback}} {{is a fundamental}} mechanism of organisms to maintain the internal environment within tolerable limits. Gibberellins (GAs) are essential regulators of many aspects of plant development, including seed germination, stem elongation, and flowering. GA biosynthesis is regulated by the feedback mechanism in plants. GA 3 -oxidase (GA 3 ox) catalyzes the final step of the biosynthetic pathway to produce the physiologically active GAs. Here, we found that only the AtGA 3 ox 1 among the AtGA 3 ox family of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) is under the regulation of GA-negative feedback. We have identified a <b>cis-acting</b> <b>sequence</b> responsible for the GA-negative feedback of AtGA 3 ox 1 using transgenic plants. Furthermore, we have identified an AT-hook protein, AGF 1 (for the AT-hook protein of GA feedback regulation), as a DNA-binding protein for the <b>cis-acting</b> <b>sequence</b> of GA-negative feedback. The mutation in the <b>cis-acting</b> <b>sequence</b> abolished both GA-negative feedback and AGF 1 binding. In addition, constitutive expression of AGF 1 affected GA-negative feedback in Arabidopsis. Our results suggest that AGF 1 {{plays a role in}} the homeostasis of GAs through binding to the <b>cis-acting</b> <b>sequence</b> of the GA-negative feedback of AtGA 3 ox 1...|$|E

Previous {{studies have shown that}} the leader RNA in the DI genome significantly enhances the efficiency of DI subgenomic mRNA transcription, indicating that the leader RNA is a <b>cis-acting</b> <b>sequence</b> for mRNA transcription. To further characterize the <b>cis-acting</b> <b>sequence,</b> we made a series of deletion mutants, all but one of which have an additional deletion of the cis-acting signal for replication in the 5 * untranslated region. This deletion effectively eliminated the replication of the DI-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) -reporter, as demonstrated by the sensitive reverse transcription (RT) -PCR. The ability of these replication-minus mutants to transcribe subgenomic mRNAs was then assessed using the DI RNA-CAT reporter system. Results from both CAT activity and mRNA transcripts detected by RT-PCR showed that a 5 *-proximal sequence of 35 nucleotides (nt) at nt 25 to 59 is a <b>cis-acting</b> <b>sequence</b> required for subgenomic RNA tran-scription, while the consensus repeat sequence of the leader RNA does not have such effect. Analyses of the secondary structure indicate that this 35 -nt sequence forms two stem-loops conserved among MHVs. Deletion of this sequence abrogated transcriptional activity and disrupted the predicted stem-loops and overall RNA secondary structure at the 5 * untranslated region, suggesting that the secondary structure formed by this 35 -n...|$|E

Genetically more complex retroviruses also encode regulatory genes and <b>cis-acting</b> <b>sequences</b> that are essential for their replication. We sought to convert a more complex retrovirus into a simpler retrovirus derivative that can replicate. We constructed novel, hybrid retrovirus vectors to replicate the gag, pol, and env genes of the more complex bovine leukemia virus (BLV) {{in the absence of}} regulatory genes and <b>cis-acting</b> response <b>sequences.</b> Most of the <b>cis-acting</b> <b>sequences</b> involved in the replication and regulation of BLV were replaced by the <b>cis-acting</b> transcriptional control <b>sequences</b> of a simpler retrovirus, spleen necrosis virus.

Studies of duck hepatitis B virus indicated {{the presence of}} <b>cis-acting</b> <b>sequences,</b> distinct from the donor and acceptor sequences for the template switches, which contribute to the synthesis of RC DNA. However, knowledge about cis-acting requirements distinct from the donor and acceptor sites for human hepatitis B virus (HBV) was lacking. In this study, we searched for <b>cis-acting</b> <b>sequences</b> for synthesis of HBV RC DNA by analyzing a set of deletion variants that collectively represent most of the HBV genome. Sequences of epsilon, DR 1, DR 2, 5 ′r, and 3 ′r were not analyzed in the study.

However, Lhx 8 DNA binding sequences are not characterized yet. We aimed {{to identify and}} characterize a <b>cis-acting</b> <b>sequence</b> of germ-cell specific transcriptional factor, Lhx 8. To identify Lhx 8 DNA binding element, Cyclic Amplification of Sequence Target (CAST) Analysis was performed. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA) was processed for the binding specificity of Lhx 8. Luciferase assay was for the transcriptional activity of Lhx 8 through identified DNA binding site. We identified a putative <b>cis-acting</b> <b>sequence,</b> TGATTG as Lhx 8 DNA binding element (LBE). In addition, Lhx 8 binds to the LBE with high affinity and augments transcriptional activity of luciferase reporter driven by artificial promoter containing the Lhx 8 binding element. These findings indicate that Lhx 8 directly regulates the transcription of genes containing Lhx 8 binding element in oocytes during early folliculogenesis...|$|E
40|$|To mate, MTL-homozygous {{strains of}} the yeast {{pathogen}} Candida albicans must switch from the white to opaque phase. Mating-competent opaque cells then release pheromone that induces polarization, a G 1 block and conjugation tube formation in opaque cells of opposite mating type. Pheromone also induces mating-incompetent white cells to become adhesive and cohesive, and form thicker biofilms that facilitate mating. The pheromone response pathway of white cells shares the upstream components of that of opaque cells, but targets a different transcription factor. Here we demonstrate that the genes up-regulated by the pheromone in white cells are activated through a common <b>cis-acting</b> <b>sequence,</b> WPRE, which is distinct from the <b>cis-acting</b> <b>sequence,</b> OPRE, responsible for up-regulation in opaque cells. Furthermore, we find that these white-specific genes play roles in white cell biofilm formation, and are essential for biofilm formation {{in the absence of}} an added source of pheromone, suggesting either an autocrine or pheromone-independent mechanism. These results suggest an intimate, complex and unique relationship between switching, mating and MTL-homozygous white cell biofilm formation, the latter a presumed virulence factor in C. albicans...|$|E

40|$|Hepadnaviruses are DNA {{viruses that}} are found in several {{mammalian}} and avian species. These viruses replicate their genome through reverse transcription of an RNA intermediate termed pregenomic RNA (pgRNA). pgRNA is reverse transcribed by the viral polymerase into a minus-strand DNA, followed by synthesis of the plus-strand DNA. There are multiple <b>cis-acting</b> <b>sequences</b> {{that contribute to the}} synthesis of minus-strand DNA for human hepatitis B virus (HBV). Less is known about the <b>cis-acting</b> <b>sequences</b> of avian hepadnaviruses that contribute to synthesis of minus-strand DNA. To identify <b>cis-acting</b> <b>sequences</b> of duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) and heron hepatitis B virus (HHBV), we analyzed variants containing 200 -nucleotide (nt) deletions. Most variants of DHBV synthesized minus-strand DNA to 50 to 100 % of the wild-type (WT) level, while two variants synthesized less than 50 %. For HHBV, most variants synthesized minus-strand DNA to less than 50 % the WT level. These results differ from those for HBV, where most of the genome can be removed with little consequence. HBV contains a sequence, φ, that contributes to the synthesis of minus-strand DNA. It has been proposed that DHBV has an analogous sequence. We determined that the proposed φ sequence of DHBV does not contribute to the synthesis of minus-strand DNA. Finally, we found that the DR 2 sequence present in all hepadnaviruses is important for synthesis of minus-strand DNA in both DHBV and HHBV but not in HBV. These differences in <b>cis-acting</b> <b>sequences</b> suggest that the individual hepadnaviruses have evolved differences in their mechanisms for synthesizing minus-strand DNA, more so than for other steps in replication...|$|R

By using chromosome transfer, we revealed that de novo activation of a silent PRF 1 locus {{was controlled by}} a 150 kb domain comprised of 16 DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs). These <b>cis-acting</b> <b>sequences</b> included a locus control region (LCR) and conferred developmentally appropriate and lineage-specific expression of human perforin from BAC transgenes. The LCR included four distal DHSs that were required for perforin expression from its natural locus, and their engineered deletion from the PRF 1 BAC transgene abolished LCR function and led to rapid gene silencing. Thus, LCR function is central for regulating the developmental and activation-specific PRF 1 promoter activity characteristic of NK cells and CTL...|$|R

The activity of oriLyt was investigated in a transient replication assay, in which the ability of plasmid constructs to promote DNA replication was tested. Replication of oriLyt-containing plasmids was autonomous and resulted in the generation of high-molecular-mass concatemers of head-to-tail-linked plasmid oligomers. oriLyt-mediated repli-cation was found to depend on viral DNA poly-merase activity supplied by RCMV infection.

Yeast engineered to express APOBEC- 1 and apoB mRNA supported editing under conditions of late log phase growth and stationary phase. The <b>cis-acting</b> <b>sequence</b> requirements and the intracellular distribution of APOBEC- 1 in yeast were similar to those described in mammalian cells.

We review the diverse array of <b>cis-acting</b> <b>sequences</b> present in viral mRNAs that compensate for the absence of a cap, poly(A) tail, or both. We also discuss the <b>cis-acting</b> <b>sequences</b> that control translation strategies that both amplify the coding potential of a genome and regulate the accumulations of viral gene products. Such strategies include leaky scanning initiation of translation of overlapping open reading frames, stop codon readthrough, and ribosomal frameshifting.

RTS 1 regulates the direction of replication at mat 1, optimizing mating-type switching that occurs as a replication-coupled recombination event. Here we show that RTS 1 contains two <b>cis-acting</b> <b>sequences</b> that cooperate for efficient replication termination. First, a sequence of ∼ 450  bp containing four repeated 55  bp motifs is essential for function. Secondly, a purine-rich sequence of ∼ 60  bp without intrinsic activity, located proximal to the repeats, acts cooperatively to increase barrier activity 4 -fold. Our {{data suggest that the}} trans-acting factors rtf 1 p and rtf 2 p act through the repeated motifs and the purine-rich element, respectively. Thus, efficient site-specific replication termination at RTS 1 occurs by a complex mechanism involving several <b>cis-acting</b> <b>sequences</b> and trans-acting factors.

At later stages, locus-dependent expression in distal limbs and the genital eminence was observed, indicating that common regulatory mechanisms are used for several genes. These experiments also illustrated that neighboring genes can share the same <b>cis-acting</b> <b>sequence</b> and that moving genes around in the complex induces novel regulatory interferences.

40|$|In the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila, {{thousands}} of DNA segments of variable size are {{eliminated from the}} developing somatic macronucleus by specific DNA rearrangements. It is unclear whether rearrangement of the many different DNA elements occurs via a single mechanism or via multiple rearrangement systems. In this study, we characterized in vivo <b>cis-acting</b> <b>sequences</b> required for the rearrangement of the 1. 1 -kbp R deletion element. We found that rearrangement requires specific sequences flanking {{each side of the}} deletion element. The required sequences on the left side appear to span roughly a 70 -bp region that is located at least 30 bp from the rearrangement boundary. When we moved the location of the left <b>cis-acting</b> <b>sequences</b> closer to the eliminated region, we observed a rightward shift of the rearrangement boundary such that the newly formed deletion junction retained its original distance from this flanking region. Likewise, when we moved the flanking region as much as 500 bp away from the deletion element, the rearrangement boundary shifted to remain in relative juxtaposition. Clusters of base substitutions made throughout this critical flanking region did not affect rearrangement efficiency or accuracy, which suggests a complex nature for this regulatory sequence. We also found that the right flanking region effectively replaced the essential sequences identified on the left side, and thus, the two flanking regions contain sequences of analogous function despite the lack of obvious sequence identity. These data taken together indicate that the R-element flanking regions contain sequences that position the rearrangement boundaries from a short distance away. Previously, a 10 -bp polypurine tract flanking the M-deletion element was demonstrated to act from a distance to determine its rearrangement boundaries. No apparent sequence similarity exists between the M and R elements. The functional similarity between these different <b>cis-acting</b> <b>sequences</b> of the two elements is firm support for a common mechanism controlling Tetrahymena rearrangement...|$|R

A construct consisting of the entire inverted repeat and several hundred base pairs of flanking DNA on each side was rearranged accurately in vivo and displayed junctional variability similar to the chromosomal Tlr 1 rearrangement.

A second construct with only 51 bp of Tetrahymena DNA flanking the right junction underwent aberrant rearrangement.

Since it is assumed that establishment of the vector is a stochastic event and strongly depends on the nuclear compartment it reaches after transfection, it is of great interest to identify genomic sequences that guide DNA sequences into certain nuclear compartments. Here we inserted genomic <b>cis-acting</b> <b>sequences</b> into pEPI and examined their impact on transgene expression, long-term stability, and vector establishment. We demonstrated that a ubiquitous chromatin-opening element (UCOE) mediated enhanced transgene expression, while an insulator sequence (cHS 4) increased establishment efficiency, presumably via an additional interaction with the nuclear matrix. Thus, besides being a promising alternative to currently used viral vectors in gene therapeutic approaches, pEPI may also serve as a tool to study nuclear compartmentalization; identification of genomic <b>cis-acting</b> <b>sequences</b> that are involved in nuclear organization will contribute {{to our understanding of the}} interplay between transgene expression, plasmid establishment, and nuclear architecture...|$|R

The putative, 5 ′-terminal stem-loop {{structure in}} STNV-C RNA is not essential for productive, plus-strand RNA accumulation but is required for optimal accumulation. Residues 2 and 3 are the minimal <b>cis-acting</b> <b>sequences</b> required for RNA synthesis. The RNA of chimeric mutants, which exchanged 3 ′- and 5 ′-untranslated regions between STNV-C and helper tobacco necrosis virus strain D RNAs, accumulated in protoplasts, implying similar replication mechanisms for both RNAs...|$|R
