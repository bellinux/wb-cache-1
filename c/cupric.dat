5|$|Copper forms a rich {{variety of}} compounds, usually with {{oxidation}} states +1 and +2, {{which are often}} called cuprous and <b>cupric,</b> respectively.|$|E
5|$|Cuprous halides (with chlorine, bromine, and iodine) are known, as are <b>cupric</b> halides with fluorine, chlorine, and bromine. Attempts {{to prepare}} copper(II) iodide yield only cuprous iodide and iodine.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} elements, the {{simplest}} compounds of copper are binary compounds, i.e. those containing only two elements, the principal examples being oxides, sulfides, and halides. Both cuprous and <b>cupric</b> oxides are known. Among the numerous copper sulfides, important examples include copper(I) sulfide and copper(II) sulfide.|$|E
5|$|Polyols, {{compounds}} containing {{more than}} one alcohol functional group, generally interact with <b>cupric</b> salts. For example, copper salts are used to test for reducing sugars. Specifically, using Benedict's reagent and Fehling's solution {{the presence of the}} sugar is signaled by a color change from blue Cu(II) to reddish copper(I) oxide. Schweizer's reagent and related complexes with ethylenediamine and other amines dissolve cellulose. Amino acids form very stable chelate complexes with copper(II). Many wet-chemical tests for copper ions exist, one involving potassium ferrocyanide, which gives a brown precipitate with copper(II) salts.|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{restoration}} {{is a type}} {{of chemical}} milling. Typically, chemical milling is used to slowly remove material to create a desired shape. In serial number restoration, small amounts of metal are removed until the serial number is brought back to the surface. This can be performed due to the depth that serial numbers are engraved into the weapon. However, chemical restoration is limited by that depth and is only successful when the obliteration of the serial number is superficial. Examiners performing a restoration first sand the area where the serial number used to be. This removes any debris from the area left when the serial number was obliterated. The examiner then chooses a chemical, usually an acid, that will be used to slowly bring the number back to the surface. The type of chemical that is used depends on the material the weapon is made of. These acids can range from Fry's Reagent for a magnetic metal, which is a mixture of hydrochloric acid, <b>cupric</b> chloride, and distilled water, to an acidic ferric chloride solution for a non-magnetic, non-aluminum material.|$|E
5|$|Crushed {{minerals}} {{are treated}} with hot concentrated sulfuric acid to produce water-soluble sulfates of rare earths. Thorium precipitates out of solution as hydroxide and is removed. After that the solution is treated with ammonium oxalate to convert rare earths into their insoluble oxalates. The oxalates are converted to oxides by annealing. The oxides are dissolved in nitric acid that excludes {{one of the main}} components, cerium, whose oxide is insoluble in HNO3. Several rare earth metals, including lutetium, are separated as a double salt with ammonium nitrate by crystallization. Lutetium is separated by ion exchange. In this process, rare-earth ions are sorbed onto suitable ion-exchange resin by exchange with hydrogen, ammonium or <b>cupric</b> ions present in the resin. Lutetium salts are then selectively washed out by suitable complexing agent. Lutetium metal is then obtained by reduction of anhydrous LuCl3 or LuF3 by either an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal.|$|E
25|$|Faster {{corrosion}} {{correlates with}} faster inactivation of microorganisms. This {{may be due}} to increased availability of <b>cupric</b> ion, Cu2+, which is believed to be responsible for the antimicrobial action.|$|E
25|$|Copper {{supplements}} {{can prevent}} copper deficiency, but supplements {{should be taken}} only under a doctor's supervision. Different forms of copper supplementation have different absorption rates. For example, the absorption of copper from <b>cupric</b> oxide supplements is lower than that from copper gluconate, sulfate, or carbonate.|$|E
25|$|Many popular vitamin {{supplements}} include copper {{as small}} inorganic molecules such as <b>cupric</b> oxide. These supplements {{can result in}} excess free copper in the brain as the copper can cross the blood-brain barrier directly. Normally, organic copper in food is first processed by the liver which keeps free copper levels under control.|$|E
25|$|The most {{efficient}} separation routine for holmium oxide from the rare-earths is ion exchange. In this process, rare-earth ions are adsorbed onto suitable ion-exchange resin by exchange with hydrogen, ammonium or <b>cupric</b> ions {{present in the}} resin. The rare earth ions are then selectively washed out by suitable complexing agent, such as ammonium citrate or nitrilotracetate.|$|E
25|$|Arsenic forms colorless, odorless, {{crystalline}} oxides As2O3 ("white arsenic") and As2O5 {{which are}} hygroscopic and readily {{soluble in water}} to form acidic solutions. Arsenic(V) acid is a weak acid and the salts are called arsenates, the most common arsenic contamination of groundwater, and a problem that affects many people. Synthetic arsenates include Scheele's Green (<b>cupric</b> hydrogen arsenate, acidic copper arsenate), calcium arsenate, and lead hydrogen arsenate. These three {{have been used as}} agricultural insecticides and poisons.|$|E
25|$|Copper’s {{patination}} {{process is}} complex. It starts immediately on {{exposure to the}} environment with the initial formation of copper oxide conversion films that are noticeable within six months. Weathering may be uneven at first but the film becomes even after about nine months. Within the first few years, cuprous and <b>cupric</b> sulfide conversion films darken the surface to browns and then dull slate gray or dull black. Continued weathering transforms the sulfide films to sulfates, which are the notable blue-green or gray-green patinas.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{long-term}} copper treatment (oral {{intake of}} 8mg copper (Cu-(II)-orotate-dihydrate)) was excluded as {{a risk factor}} for Alzheimer's disease in a noted clinical trial on humans and a potentially beneficial role of copper in Alzheimer's disease has been demonstrated on cerebral spinal fluid levels of Aβ42, a toxic peptide and biomarker of the disease. More research is needed to understand metal homeostasis disturbances in Alzheimer's disease patients and how to address these disturbances therapeutically. Since this experiment used Cu-(II)-orotate-dihydrate, it does not relate to the effects of <b>cupric</b> oxide in supplements.|$|E
25|$|The crushed mineral {{is treated}} with hot {{concentrated}} sulfuric acid to produce water-soluble sulfates of rare earths. The acidic filtrates are partially neutralized with sodium hydroxide to pH 3-4. Thorium precipitates out of solution as hydroxide and is removed. After {{that the solution}} is treated with ammonium oxalate to convert rare earths into their insoluble oxalates. The oxalates are converted to oxides by annealing. The oxides are dissolved in nitric acid that excludes the main components, cerium, whose oxide is insoluble in HNO3. Neodymium oxide is separated from other rare-earth oxides by ion exchange. In this process, rare-earth ions are adsorbed onto suitable resin by ion exchange with hydrogen, ammonium or <b>cupric</b> ions present in the resin. The rare earth ions are then selectively washed out by suitable complexing agent, such as ammonium citrate or nitrilotracetate.|$|E
500|$|Natural alum (aluminum sulfate) is {{the most}} common {{metallic}} salt mordant, but tin (stannous chloride), copper (<b>cupric</b> sulfate), iron (ferrous sulfate, called copperas) and chrome (potassium dichromate) are also used. [...] Iron mordants [...] "sadden" [...] colors, while tin and chrome mordants brighten colors. [...] The iron mordants contribute to fabric deterioration, referred to as [...] "dye rot". Additional chemicals or alterants may be applied after dying to further alter or reinforce the colors.|$|E
500|$|To create green sparks, {{fireworks}} use barium salts, such as barium chlorate, {{barium nitrate}} crystals, or barium chloride, {{also used for}} green fireplace logs. Copper salts typically burn blue, but <b>cupric</b> chloride (also known as [...] "campfire blue") can also produce green flames. Green pyrotechnic flares can use a mix ratio 75:25 of boron and potassium nitrate. Smoke can be turned green by a mixture: solvent yellow 33, solvent green 3, lactose, magnesium carbonate plus sodium carbonate added to potassium chlorate.|$|E
2500|$|Copper(II) acetate, also {{referred}} to as <b>cupric</b> acetate, is the chemical compound with the formula Cu(OAc)2 where AcO− is acetate (...) [...] The hydrated derivative, which contains one molecule of water for each Cu atom, is available commercially. Anhydrous Cu(OAc)2 is a dark green crystalline solid, whereas Cu2(OAc)4(H2O)2 is more bluish-green. Since ancient times, copper acetates of some form have been used as fungicides and green pigments. Today, copper acetates are used as reagents for the synthesis of various inorganic and organic compounds. Copper acetate, like all copper compounds, emits a blue-green glow in a flame.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{aspects of}} copper {{homeostasis}} are {{known at the}} molecular level. Copper's essentiality is due to its ability {{to act as an}} electron donor or acceptor as its oxidation state fluxes between Cu1+(cuprous) and Cu2+ (<b>cupric).</b> As a component of about a dozen cuproenzymes, copper is involved in key redox (i.e., oxidation-reduction) reactions in essential metabolic processes such as mitochondrial respiration, synthesis of melanin, and cross-linking of collagen. Copper {{is an integral part of}} the antioxidant enzyme, copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (Cu,Zn-SOD), and has a role in iron homeostasis as a cofactor in ceruloplasmin. A list of some key copper-containing enzymes and their functions is summarized below: ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{metals in}} the MOF {{structure}} often act as Lewis acids. The metals in MOFs often coordinate to labile solvent molecules or counter ions {{which can be}} removed after activation of the framework. The Lewis acidic nature of such unsaturated metal centers can activate the coordinated organic substrates for subsequent organic transformations. The use of unsaturated metal centers was demonstrated in the cyanosilylation of aldehydes and imines by Fujita and coworkers in 2004. They reported MOF of composition { • (NO3)2 • 4H2O} which was obtained by treating linear bridging ligand 4,4′-bipyridine (bpy) with Cd(NO3)2 [...] The Cd(II) centers in this MOF possesses a distorted octahedral geometry having four pyridines in the equatorial positions, and two water molecules in the axial positions to form a two-dimensional infinite network. On activation, two water molecules were removed leaving the metal centers unsaturated and Lewis acidic. The Lewis acidic character of metal center was tested on cyanosilylation reactions of imine where the imine gets attached to the Lewis-acidic metal centre resulting in higher electrophilicity of imines. For the cyanosilylation of imines, most of the reactions were complete within 1 h affording aminonitriles in quantitative yield. Kaskel and coworkers(BTC)2 |year=2004 |journal=Microporous and Mesoporous Materials |volume=73 |pages=81–85 |doi=10.1016/j.micromeso.2003.12.027 |last1=Schlichte |first1=Klaus |last2=Kratzke |first2=Tobias |last3=Kaskel |first3=Stefan }} carried out similar cyanosilylation reactions with coordinatively unsaturated metals in three-dimensional (3D) MOFs as heterogeneous catalysts. The 3D framework [...] (btc: Benzene-1,3,5- tricarboxylate) (HKUST-1) {{used in this study}} was first reported by Williams et al.(TMA)2(H2O)3]n |year=1999 |journal=Science |volume=283 |page=1148 |doi=10.1126/science.283.5405.1148 |bibcode=1999Sci...283.1148C |last1=Chui |first1=S.

Guy |last5=Williams |first5=Ian D. |issue=5405 }} The open framework of [...] is built from dimeric <b>cupric</b> tetracarboxylate units (paddle-wheels) with aqua molecules coordinating to the axial positions and btc bridging ligands. The resulting framework after removal of two water molecules from axial positions possesses porous channel. This activated MOF catalyzes the trimethylcyanosilylation of benzaldehydes with a very low conversion (<5% in 24 h) at 293 K. As the reaction temperature was raised to 313 K, a good conversion of 57% with a selectivity of 89% was obtained after 72 h. In comparison, less than 10% conversion was observed for the background reaction (without MOF) under the same conditions. But this strategy suffers from some problems like 1) the decomposition of the framework with increase of the reaction temperature due to the reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I) by aldehydes; 2) strong solvent inhibition effect; electron donating solvents such as THF competed with aldehydes for coordination to the Cu(II) sites, and no cyanosilylation product was observed in these solvents; 3) the framework instability in some organic solvents. Several other groups have also reported the use of metal centres in MOFs as catalysts Coordination Site |year=2008 |journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society |volume=130 |page=5854 |doi=10.1021/ja800669j |last1=Horike |first1=Satoshi |last2=Dincǎ |first2=Mircea |last3=Tamaki |first3=Kentaro |last4=Long |first4=Jeffrey R. |issue=18 |pmid=18399629}} Again, electron-deficient nature of some metals and metal clusters makes the resulting MOFs efficient oxidation catalysts. Mori and coworkers reported MOFs with Cu2 paddle wheel units as heterogeneous catalysts for the oxidation of alcohols. The catalytic activity of the resulting MOF was examined by carrying out alcohol oxidation with H2O2 as the oxidant. It also catalyzed the oxidation of primary alcohol, secondary alcohol and benzyl alcohols with high selectivity.
