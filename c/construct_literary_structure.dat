40|$|To {{support the}} {{automatic}} semantic analysis of texts in the humanities, {{it is not}} sufficient to analyze words and evaluate word pairs, because it is necessary to process larger units, such as phrases, sentences, and paragraphs. This study proposes the introduction of intratextuality into a digital archive system. In the future, this method will be developed as the basis for semantic analysis of larger units. Classical <b>literary</b> <b>structures</b> that are used frequently in the Old and New Testaments were digitized as a case study. A <b>literary</b> <b>structure</b> data format for a relational database was also implemented. The <b>literary</b> <b>structures</b> of 39 books in the Old Testament and 27 books in the New Testament were digitized. The total number of digitized <b>literary</b> <b>structures</b> was 1, 507 and the elements of these structures comprised 7, 715 pairs. These data were stored in a Java-based relational database system and a web-based viewer program for rhetorical structures was implemented as a JSP servlet. This web-based program will be combined with an existing digital archive system that can manage intertextuality data. The Java-based relational database system and the JSP servlet will facilitate numerical analyses of the intertextuality and intratextuality of digital archive systems of classical texts, thus making it much easier to conduct scientific analyses of the meanings of texts...|$|R

Instead, it's a skillfully <b>constructed</b> <b>literary</b> IED that brings together the sharpest aspects from multiple genres. It's a Tarantino-esque Heart of Darkness set in war-torn Iraq, filled with absurdism and dark humor, a mash-up of satirical Joseph Heller-style comedy and sci-fi fantasy with a gratuitous mixture of good old-fashioned ultra-violence.-Colby Buzzell, Vice ...|$|R

Rather, the [...] "'grammar' of literature" [...] is converted into <b>literary</b> <b>structures</b> and meaning.

These enchanted, deserted, and haunted gardens function as metaphors for the contested ground on which some key Ming-Qing intellectual issues are debated. The {{article examines}} Pu’s depiction of 'qing'情,an important concept reflecting the philosophical and literary trends of the time, and shows that {{in the process of}} <b>constructing</b> <b>literary</b> gardens, Pu challenges the intellectual issues of his time and dissolves the boundaries between normal and abnormal, reality and ideal, death and life, and order and disorder...|$|R
40|$|This study {{questions}} {{the impact of}} multicultural literature on reader responses. Research declares students are learning from a Eurocentric curriculum cultivated by canonical literature that many African American students do not relate to or understand. Six African American students <b>constructed</b> <b>literary</b> responses and focus group discussions after exposure to several multicultural genres in contrast to mainstream genres exposing the inability to interpret mainstream literature. The cultural disconnect from mainstream literature reinforced how significant cultural identification is for effective literacy development. Cultural validation is acknowledged based on the literature’s cultural relevance activating similar sociocultural experiences to help foster literary interpretations...|$|R

50|$|According to Bart D. Ehrman (1993) {{these two}} verses disrupt the <b>literary</b> <b>structure</b> {{of the scene}} (the chiasmus), they are {{not found in the}} early and {{valuable}} manuscripts, and they are the only place in Luke where Jesus is seen to be in agony. Ehrman concludes that they were inserted in order to counter doceticism, the belief that Jesus, as divine, only seemed to suffer. While probably not original to the text, these verses reflect first-century tradition.|$|R

5000|$|Unlike many of Lovecraft's other tales, [...] "The White Ship" [...] {{does not}} {{directly}} tie into the popularized Cthulhu Mythos. However, the story cannot be entirely excluded from mythos continuity either, since it makes reference to preternatural, godlike beings. The tone and temperament of [...] "The White Ship" [...] speaks largely of the Dream Cycle <b>literary</b> <b>structure</b> that Lovecraft utilized in other stories such as The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath (1926) and [...] "The Cats of Ulthar" [...] (1920).|$|R
25|$|Philosophical in nature, {{his novels}} take {{place during the}} course of just a few days, exhibit little action, and explore a variety of {{concepts}} such as love, duty, racial sensitivities, and the law.

As a result, many contemporary critics regarded his work as old-fashioned or moralistic, and he was viciously attacked as a reactionary by his harshest critics.|$|R
50|$|Another work, the Enconium of Peter the Alexandrian, is {{attributed}} to him. This book survives in five codices. The work can be reconstructed based on the extant fragments and a translation in the History of the Patriarchs.

The author emphasises the Christian nature of the poet’s interpretation of the war and revolution period of 1917. Special attention is paid to the means of the implementation of the author’s idea of the Fall, punishment, and atonement in Russia at that historical moment.

It is shown that Hagar and Ishmael are important literary figures, tied into the book of Genesis through numerous literary devices. The key to reconciling their banishment lies in a previously overlooked pun in Gn 21 : 9...|$|R
50|$|Marulić's Judith {{has none}} of the {{decorative}} epithets typical of folk epics. The epic poem is also notable for the Humanistic treatment of the subject and the author's Petrarchan descriptions of Judith's beauty. Judith is interesting as a cultural monument {{as well as for}} its composition. The author's choice of a subject that simultaneously deals with an act of heroism and a crime shows suggests he privileged the <b>literary</b> <b>structure</b> (plot, drama) of the material, and only then considered its moralistic overtones.|$|R
