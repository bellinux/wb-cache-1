Limited research has examined the effect of OXY on METH-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) and {{little is known about}} the neural mechanisms involved. A Fos immunohistochemistry study recently demonstrated that peripheral OXY administration reduced METH-induced Fos expression within the nucleus accumbens (NAc) core and subthalamic nucleus (STh) in rats. The current study aimed to (i) investigate the effect of systemically administered OXY on METH-induced CPP, (ii) determine the effectiveness of a single-trial CPP procedure with METH, in order to (iii) evaluate whether pretreatment with OXY injected directly into the NAc core or the STh attenuates METH-induced CPP. Results showed that male Sprague Dawley rats learned to associate unique compartmental cues with METH (1. mg/kg, i. p.) such that they spent more time in the METH-paired compartment and less time in the saline-paired compartment.

Thus, the multicast routing problems have received much attention from many researchers. In this paper, we consider a multicast routing problem with multiple multicast sessions under a capacity limited constraint. This problem is formulated as a tree packing problem. We propose two heuristic algorithms, Steiner-tree-based heuristic (STH) algorithm and cut-set-based heuristic (CSH) algorithm, for solving this problem. The simulation {{results show that}} the STH algorithm can "nd a better approximate solution in a shorter computation time compared to CSH. In addition, if the available bandwidth for the service is just enough, the STH and CSH algorithms may fail to "nd a solution even if the solution exists.

40|$|Background: Recently, WHO has {{developed}} a predictive model to evaluate the impact of preventive chemotherapy programs to control the morbidity of soil-transmitted helminths (<b>STHs).</b> <b>To</b> make predictions, this model needs baseline information about the proportion of infections classified as low, moderate and high intensity, {{for each of the}} three STH species. However, epidemiological data available are often limited to prevalence estimates. Methods: We reanalyzed available data from 19 surveys in 10 countries and parameterized the relationship between prevalence of STH infections and the proportion of moderate and heavy intensity infections. Results: The equations derived allow feeding the WHO model with estimates of the proportion of the different classes of infection intensity when only prevalence data is available. Conclusions: The prediction capacities of the STH model using the equations developed in the present study, should be tested by comparing it with the changes on STH epidemiological data observed in control programs operating for several years...|$|R
40|$|Research question: A major {{barrier to}} {{retaining}} existing customers is {{the difficulty in}} knowing who is most at risk of leaving (or ‘churning’). Given the strategic and financial importance of season ticket holders (<b>STH)</b> <b>to</b> professional sport teams, this paper examines {{the effectiveness of a}} range of variables in identifying the STH {{who are most likely to}} churn. Research methods: A longitudinal field study was undertaken to reflect actual conditions. Survey data of a professional sport team STH were collected prior to the conclusion of the season. Actual renewal data were then tracked from team records the following season. This work was replicated across five professional sport teams from the Australian Football League, with renewal predictions made and tracked for over 10, 000 STH. Results and findings: The results suggest that the ‘Juster’ Scale – a simple, one-item purchase probability measure – is an effective identifier of those most at risk of churning, more than 3 months in advance. When combined with ticket utilization and tenure measures, predictive accuracy improves markedly, to the point where these three measures can be used to provide an effective early warning system for managers. Implications: Whilst there is a tendency <b>to</b> view <b>STH</b> as highly loyal, these data reinforce the importance of actively managing all customers to reduce churn. Despite their commitment, STH do churn, but those most likely to can be predicted by examining their patterns of behaviour in the current season.

Analysis of the modified nucleosides and 5 '-terminal cap structures in radiolabeled mRNA by high-pressure liquid chromatography indicated that internal N 6 -methylation of adenosine was reduced by 65 % at 50 microM STH and by 83 % at 500 microM STH.

40|$|Particulate {{photocatalytic}} {{water splitting}} {{is the most}} disruptive and competitive solution for the direct production of solar fuels. Despite {{more than four decades}} of work in the field of photocatalysis using powdered semiconductors decorated with catalyst particles, there is no clear consensus on the factors limiting the solar-to-hydrogen efficiency (<b>STH).</b> <b>To</b> understand the intrinsic limitations of the system, we numerically simulated simplified two-dimensional photocatalytic models using classical semiconductor device equations. This work presents the sensitivity of quantum efficiency (QE) to the various semiconductor properties, such as absorption properties and carrier mobilities, and to the dispersion of catalyst particles, which create heterojunctions, the driving force for charge separation. As a result, a pinch-off effect was prevalent underneath the hydrogen evolution site, suggesting an undesired energetic barrier for electron diffusion to the catalyst. The simulation using the values reported in the literature revealed that the QE was exclusively governed by recombination in the bulk of the photocatalyst particles, hindering the charge separation efficiency before reaching the catalysts on the surface. Using some of the reported parameters, our simulation shows that a typical defective n-type semiconductor particle (∼ 100 nm) ideally exhibits a QE of < 5 % in the visible light range per particle, which reaches only approximately 10 % in a slurry after 4 consecutive absorbing units (1. 4 % STH, from simulated solar irradiation). Although the present model contains rigid limitations, we use these trends as an initial guideline to pursue photocatalysis by a design strategy, which may result in possible alternatives to achieve higher efficiencies. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry...|$|R

Results showed that male Sprague Dawley rats i) formed a preference for the context paired with dopamine (100 nmol/side) administration into the STh, which was prevented by co-administration of ii) the mixed dopamine receptor antagonist fluphenazine (10 nmol/side) or iii) oxytocin (0. 6 nmol/side), with the oxytocin effect on dopamine CPP reversed by the co-administration of the oxytocin receptor antagonist (3 nmol/side).

According to the SES, from 2004 to 2006, only 2, 977 (19. 5 %) of the estimated 15, 288 residents of all ages were examined, of which 396 (13. 3 %) were positive for Schistosoma mansoni. Among these, only 180 (45. 5 %) were treated. According to the SMS, of the 1, 766 examined in the 2003 - 2004 population stool survey 570 (32. 3 %) were children aged 7 - 14 years. One year later, the SRE/Fiocruz school survey revealed that the infection status among those children remained unchanged at 14 %- 15 % prevalence. By 2006, the school-aged population was estimated at 2, 981, of which 2, 007 (67. 3 %) were enrolled as pupils. CONCLUSIONS: It is suggested that in the most troubled municipalities individual diagnosis and treatment should be concentrated in school-aged children rather than the whole population. School-based actions involving teachers and children's families may help the health teams to scale up control actions in order to attain the WHA- 54. 19 minimum goal. This strategy should involve health and education organs and include both enrolled and non-enrolled children...|$|R

According <b>to</b> Aquinas, the extreme circumstance that warrants withholding the Eucharist from a cognitively impaired Christian is if the Christian is entirely incapable of expressing their desire to receive the Eucharist. The worry of Aquinas is that the Eucharist would be forced upon someone who does not want to participate in the sacrament.|$|R

Improvements to water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) likely provide sustained benefit, but few rigorous studies have evaluated the specific WASH components most influential in reducing infection. There {{is a need for}} alternative analytic approaches to help identify, characterize and further refine the WASH components that are most important <b>to</b> <b>STH</b> reinfection. Traditional epidemiological approaches are not well-suited for assessing the complex and highly correlated relationships commonly seen in WASH. Methodology: We introduce two recursive partitioning approaches: classification and regression trees (C&RT) and conditional inference trees (CIT), which can be used to identify complex interactions between WASH indicators and identify sub-populations that may be susceptible <b>to</b> <b>STH</b> reinfection. We illustrate {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} these approaches utilizing school- and household-level WASH indicators gathered as part of a school-based randomized control trial in Kenya that measured STH reinfection of pupils 10 months following deworming treatment. Principal Findings: C&RT and CIT analyses resulted in strikingly different decision trees. C&RT may be the preferred approach if interest lies in using WASH indicators to classify individuals or communities as STH infected or uninfected...|$|R

The aim of this cross-sectional survey was to assess the feasibility of measuring children's physical fitness and to relate it <b>to</b> <b>STH</b> infections. Our study was carried out among school-aged children of the Bulang ethnic group in rural southwest People's Republic of China (P. R. China).
