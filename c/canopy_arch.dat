25|$|The Christopher Turnor {{monument}} sits on {{a black-and-white}} marble-tiled raised level. Within this level is set a worn sculpted medieval monument, supposed the early 14th-century memorial to John de Neville and his wife, with two recumbent figures—the man in chain armour, the woman with a wimple—draped from elbow to ankle and set within a sunken field. A dog lies {{at the feet of}} each figure, and a shield with three Fleur-de-lis lies partly over the man. Set into the raised floor against the north wall is a recessed table tomb with inset panels with angels holding shields, above which is a curved and moulded <b>canopy</b> <b>arch</b> with embedded fleuron repeats and a crocketed top running to a cross-shaped floriate finial. The origin of the monument is unknown. Next to the de Neville monument and set into a marble tile is a lozenge-shaped metal plaque to Florence Amy Laura Neville (died 1934 aged 85 years), daughter of Henry Martin Turnor who was the son of antiquarian Edmund Turnor (1755–1829) and brother of Christopher Turnor (1809–1886).|$|E
2500|$|Late in 1940, a Martin-Baker {{designed}} quick-release canopy mechanism {{began to}} be retroactively fitted to all Spitfires. The system employed unlocking pins, actuated by cables operated by the pilot pulling a small, red rubber ball mounted on the <b>canopy</b> <b>arch.</b> When freed, the canopy was taken away by the slipstream. One {{of the most important}} modifications to the Spitfire was to replace the machine gun armament with wing mounted Hispano 20 mm cannon. In December 1938, Joseph Smith was instructed to prepare a scheme to equip a Spitfire with a single Hispano mounted under each wing. Smith objected to the idea and designed an installation in which the cannon were mounted on their sides within the wing, with only small external blisters on the upper and lower wing surfaces covering the 60 round drum magazine.

50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{is constructed}} of carbon composite materials. The main fuselage and each wing spar {{is a single}} piece. It has a fixed (sprung steel) tricycle undercarriage with spatted wheels, a short nose bearing the 180 hp engine and a 3-bladed variable-pitch propeller. The aircraft was re-certified in 2013 with a new MT Propeller following issues with the previous design. The inverted oil system was also redesigned to improve lubrication during aerobatics. The cockpit features a broad <b>canopy</b> <b>arch</b> and spine. Forward visibility is good. The side-by-side seats are fixed and pilot seating is adjusted with cushions {{as well as a}} rudder bar adjuster. The wings are tapered with square tips and the empennage consists of a large fin and rudder with an oblong tailplane with square tips mid-set to the fuselage.|$|E

With the early cannon installation, jamming was a serious problem. In one engagement, only two of the 12 aircraft had been able to fire off all of their ammunition. Further cannon-armed Spitfires, with improvements to the cannon mounts, were later issued to 92 Squadron, but due to the limited magazine capacity it was eventually decided the best armament mix was two cannon and four machine guns (most of these were later converted to the first Mk VBs).|$|E
5000|$|Beneath {{the window}} on the east wall of the north chapel is an 1896 [...] "fine memorial" [...] sepulchral reredos to Christopher Turnor (1809-1886) and his wife Lady Caroline (Finch-Hatton), {{designed}} by Turnor himself. Christopher Turnor undertook the rebuilding of Stoke Rochford Hall in 1846, was an MP for South Lincolnshire, and was a designer and provider of Lincolnshire farm complexes. Lady Caroline {{was the daughter of}} George Finch-Hatton, 10th Earl of Winchilsea. The memorial is of white marble. The table pedestal is faced with twelve twinned column reliefs, leading to ogee headed and cusped arches, with quatrefoils in circular devices between each. Above are three decorative gabled and pinnacled relief structures supported by slender columns, with inset niches containing saints, inscriptions, and geometric and floriated details, separated by a crocketed frieze. Two panels between contain roundels with profile relief portraits within a circular moulding.The Christopher Turnor monument sits on a black-and-white marble-tiled raised level.

40|$|This Bureau of Mines report {{presents}} a procedure {{for the design}} of an <b>arch</b> <b>canopy</b> for use in rehabilitating a high-roof-fall area. Only dy-namic line loading of an unbackfilled <b>arch</b> <b>canopy</b> at its crown is considered, and the procedure does not account for an asymmetrical loading condition. The evaluation of whether an <b>arch</b> <b>canopy</b> is suitable for a particular installation depends on many variables, including in-mine conditions and the engineering properties of the structure. However, a general evaluation can be based on a comparison of the arch's maximum crown deflection and a prescribed allowable crown deflection. The design procedure is based on the concept that when an <b>arch</b> <b>canopy</b> is sub-jected to impact loading at its crown and deflects from its unloaded state to maximum crown deflection, the structure absorbs strain energy, both elastic and plastic. As a result, this strain energy can be calculated from a static load-displacement diagram for the structure. The significance of this design procedure is that it gives mine personnel an analytical tool to select an <b>arch</b> <b>canopy</b> to meet the dimensional and functional requirements of a mine entry and a prescribed allowable crown deflection...|$|R

5000|$|Several {{buildings}} on the property are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The original pond {{was used as a}} location for cutting and hauling ice. [...] The NRHP historic portion of the property is part of the Pisgah Rural Historic District and lies mostly along Pisgah Pike road. The conforming structures include the original farmhouse from the settlement period, circa 1784-1790, when Virginia families first moved into the region. It had additions built onto it sometime after the Civil War but retains its historic character. A brick smoke house, tobacco barn that was converted to a horse barn, and the spring-fed, stone-lined pond also are listed. Along a portion of the Pisgah Pike that adjoins the property, a natural hedge of Osage orange has grown so tall that it has become a <b>canopy</b> <b>arching</b> over the road, and is also noted on the NRHP as a historically significant feature.|$|R

40|$|This U. S. Bureau of Mines report {{presents}} the results of structural analyses and full-scale physical tests conducted on a steel-set arch and tri-set. The purpose of the analyses and tests was to evaluate the suitability of these structures for use in roof-fall prone areas. The <b>arch</b> <b>canopy</b> test and design procedures previously developed by the Bureau were utilized in this evaluation. Theoretical resistance functions were established for the steel-set arch and tri-set and were representative of the experimental behavior of the structures. The resistance functions were used to determine the energy absorption capacity of the structures and to predict their dynamic response to impact loading. The dynamic tests demonstrated that the <b>arch</b> <b>canopy</b> design procedure is appropriate for tri-sets and yields conservative designs for both steel-set arches and tri-sets. As a result of this work, it is recommended that these two structures may be considered for use in roof-fall prone areas and for rehabilitation work, provided the <b>arch</b> <b>canopy</b> design procedure is utilized for each application and the principles underlying the design procedure are understood...|$|R
