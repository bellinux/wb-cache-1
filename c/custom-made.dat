5|$|Early in his presidency, Reagan started {{wearing a}} <b>custom-made,</b> technologically {{advanced}} hearing aid, {{first in his}} right ear and later in his left ear as well. His decision to go public in 1983 regarding his wearing the small, audio-amplifying device boosted their sales.|$|E
5|$|At {{the taping}} of the episode, {{the cast and}} crew passed around yearbooks, <b>custom-made</b> by the {{production}} staff, and signed them for each other. The cast gave the producers inscribed Cartier SA watches, while the producers gave the cast Neil Lane jewelry. As the sets were broken down, {{the cast and crew}} each got a chunk of the street outside Central Perk in a glass box as a keepsake.|$|E
5|$|Hubble {{data can}} be {{analyzed}} using many different packages. STScI maintains the <b>custom-made</b> Space Telescope Science Data Analysis System (STSDAS) software, which contains all the programs needed to run pipeline reduction on raw data files, {{as well as many}} other astronomical image processing tools, tailored to the requirements of Hubble data. The software runs as a module of IRAF, a popular astronomical data reduction program.|$|E
5|$|Laurer's breast {{implants}} were <b>custom-made</b> for her {{after her first}} implants were ruptured during a wrestling match. She had also complained to her plastic surgeon that their largest implants did not suit her frame {{in the way she}} desired. Laurer's custom implants became the model for the Chyna 2000s, a model of breast implant now marketed to large-framed women and female bodybuilders. Laurer claimed to have paid $6,000 for them.|$|E
5|$|Oslo Sporveier had {{previously}} bought all their new trams <b>custom-made.</b> For the 1995 order, the company instead wanted {{to purchase a}} pre-designed tram. The company {{for a long time}} considered purchasing trams along with Storstockholms Lokaltrafik, who were needing new rolling stock for two light rail systems in Stockholm, Sweden. Three existing trams were tested in Oslo during 1995, and several trams were also tested in Stockholm.|$|E
5|$|The cup {{came to the}} British Museum with a <b>custom-made</b> {{hexagonal}} case {{of leather}} on a wood frame, with iron lock, handles and mounts. This was either made {{at the same time}} or soon after the cup, and has incised and stamped foliate decoration and a blackletter inscription: YHE.SUS.O.MARYA.O.MARYA YHE SUS.|$|E
5|$|The game {{includes}} a random terrain generator, a basic terrain editor {{which allows the}} user to create {{the shape of the}} terrain with brushes, and a more complex terrain-import system which allows the user to import <b>custom-made</b> terrains in image format, which the game automatically converts into playable terrains.|$|E
5|$|After Mellotronics had {{targeted}} them as {{a potential}} customer, the BBC Radiophonic Workshop {{became interested in the}} possibilities of the instrument, hoping it would allow them to increase throughput. The corporation used two <b>custom-made</b> models that employed recorded sound effects throughout 1963 and 1964, but had problems with fluctuating tape speed and found the sound wasn't up to professional broadcast quality. The Mellotron was eventually dropped in favour of electronic oscillators and synthesizers.|$|E
5|$|As of 2010, Big Bear Choppers had {{produced}} seven <b>custom-made</b> motorcycles for Angel, who featured the motorcycle designers {{on his show}} Criss Angel Mindfreak. He also had a Harley Davidson motorcycle built by Orange County Choppers, which he rode in the intro filmed for Criss Angel Mindfreak. As a philanthropist, Angel created the Believe Foundation 'Believe Anything is Possible', and was awarded the Make-A-Wish Foundation award for most supportive celebrity on May 19, 2010. He was also awarded the foundation's Chris Greicius Celebrity Award in 2007. As of 2016, Angel's business interests made about $70 million in revenues annually.|$|E
5|$|Rendering was {{executed}} in Mental Ray, using numerous <b>custom-made</b> shaders to produce lifelike lighting, water and landscapes. Wireframes {{also served as}} a guide to model the backgrounds. In total Riven has over three hours of video and almost five thousand images; rendering was a major bottleneck in production despite the use of 18 dedicated workstations. Some scenes consisted {{of tens of thousands of}} individual models and textures and more than a hundred virtual light sources. Loading a single island model could take two hours. Runtime animation effects were created by Mark DeForest, to add flying insects and simple water ripples.|$|E
5|$|Rush {{set up as}} a {{store-keeper}} in {{the town}} of Rocky Mouth (Maclean). He operated a 'floating store' which was anchored at Chatsworth Island during the sugar-cane harvesting season when hundreds of itinerant labourers moved into the district. His steam launch Jinnie Rush was used as a mobile general store, delivering goods to farmers and villagers along the river. Rush also bought several racing boats, importing ‘riggers’ from England, as well as ordering them <b>custom-made</b> from local boat-builders.|$|E
5|$|The Bond {{character}} is a Secret Service agent, code number 007, residing in London but active internationally. Bond was a composite character who {{was based on a}} number of commandos whom Fleming knew during his service in the Naval Intelligence Division during the Second World War, to whom Fleming added his own style and a number of his own tastes; Bond's name was appropriated from the American ornithologist James Bond. Bond has a number of character traits which run throughout the books, including an enjoyment of cars, a love of food and drink, and an average intake of sixty <b>custom-made</b> cigarettes a day.|$|E
5|$|Bond {{is a heavy}} smoker, at {{one point}} smoking 70 {{cigarettes}} a day. Bond has his cigarettes <b>custom-made</b> by Morland of Grosvenor Street, mixing Balkan and Turkish tobacco and having a higher nicotine content than normal; the cigarettes have three gold bands on the filter. Bond carried his cigarettes in a wide gunmetal cigarette case which carried fifty; he also used a black oxidised Ronson lighter. The cigarettes {{were the same as}} Fleming's, who had been buying his at Morland since the 1930s; the three gold bands on the filter were added during the war to mirror his naval Commander's rank. On average, Bond smokes sixty cigarettes a day, although he cut back to around twenty five a day after his visit to a health farm in Thunderball: Fleming himself smoked up to 80 cigarettes a day.|$|E
5|$|Oligonucleotide {{synthesis}} is {{the chemical}} synthesis of relatively short fragments of nucleic acids with defined chemical structure (sequence). The technique is extremely useful in current laboratory practice {{because it provides}} a rapid and inexpensive access to <b>custom-made</b> oligonucleotides of the desired sequence. Whereas enzymes synthesize DNA and RNA only in a 5' to 3' direction, chemical oligonucleotide synthesis does not have this limitation, although it is, most often, {{carried out in the}} opposite, 3' to 5' direction. Currently, the process is implemented as solid-phase synthesis using phosphoramidite method and phosphoramidite building blocks derived from protected 2'-deoxynucleosides (dA, dC, dG, and T), ribonucleosides (A, C, G, and U), or chemically modified nucleosides, e.g. LNA or BNA.|$|E
5|$|On Nothing, Meshuggah {{abandons}} {{the fast}} tempos of Chaosphere and concentrates on slow, tuned down tempos and grooves. The album {{was intended to}} be recorded using <b>custom-made</b> Nevborn eight-string guitars, but the prototypes were faulty so Thordendal and Hagström used detuned Ibanez seven-string guitars instead. This technique, which involved keeping the instruments untuned during the sessions, created additional problems. When Ibanez provided Meshuggah with special eight-string guitars with two extra-low strings that worked properly after the initial release, the band re-recorded the guitar parts for Nothing and re-released it in 2006. Hagström notes that this allowed the band to go lower sonically and to attain bass sounds on guitars.|$|E
5|$|Pistorius uses <b>custom-made</b> spike pads on the blades. Before {{development}} of the pads, his spikes were changed by roughing up the surface and applying over-the-counter spikes by hand, but the results using this method were inconsistent. Research was conducted in Össur’s Iceland lab using a pressure-sensitive treadmill and film at 500 fps to measure the blade strike, and produced a spike pad which includes a midsole of two machine-molded pieces of foam of different densities to cushion impact, with a carbon fibre plate on the bottom. The developers attached the pad with contact cement, which can be quickly removed with the application of heat when the spike pad needs to be changed.|$|E
5|$|Razer's four-wheeled {{drive train}} used a skid-steering arrangement, whereby the wheels {{on one side}} of the robot rotated faster than those on the other to turn the machine. Also, the weight of the robot was biased towards the rear so that its weapon stayed facing its {{opponent}} as Razer turned. However, the solid rubber rear wheels used in series two provided too much traction and were reluctant to 'swing' the machine. For the third series, Razer used <b>custom-made</b> aluminium drive wheels which incorporated rollers, reducing the amount of force required for simultaneous forward and sideways movement. These wheels were later upgraded with a stronger titanium construction, whilst the level of oversteer in the drive system was reduced through the implementation of an electronic gyroscope. For the series Robot Wars Extreme II, Razer's rubber front wheels were replaced with metal ones bearing small spiked protrusions.|$|E
5|$|Seneb's tomb reliefs and {{the false}} {{door of his}} tomb {{indicate}} his wealth and power. Seneb is described {{as the owner of}} several thousand cattle and is shown in various scenes of domestic life – being carried in a litter, sailing in a boat in the Nile Delta, or receiving his children. The false door shows Seneb carrying out the standard activities of a high-ranking courtier such as inspecting his linen and cattle, receiving accounts and overseeing his retainers. He is shown wearing kilts and a priestly robe made of panther skin, and carrying symbols of his office such as a sceptre and staff. One relief shows him accompanied by two pet dogs, each captioned with a name. He is depicted using what were evidently <b>custom-made</b> items of furniture, such as low stools and a specially adapted litter with a low back and large side-panels to conceal his legs.|$|E
5|$|The four-minute ride uses 85-foot IMAX Dome {{screens and}} Sony Projectors. There are 24 ride cars, each seating eight people, and {{approximately}} 2000 people can ride it per hour. The projection system uses four overlapping Sony SXRD 4K resolution projectors on each dome, using <b>custom-made</b> semi-circular fisheye lenses to project undistorted images {{at a rate}} of 60 frames per second (in comparison, most feature films project at 24 frames per second). The video is projected onto two dome screens which are made of 416 panels (each 4feet by two feet) and are approximately 80feet tall and 85feet wide. The animation in the ride uses computer generated 3D animation rendered by Blur Studio and Reel FX, rather than the traditional 2-D animation seen on The Simpsons and the queue and pre-show of the ride. The animation reference was provided by Film Roman, the animation studio that animates the series. Each car contains 12 speakers and a Dolby 6.1 surround sound, while the domes contain an additional 90 speakers.|$|E
5|$|The visual {{then returns}} to the trailer park setting, where Azalea rides a lowrider bicycle through the area. She wears a {{perforated}} yellow visor, black brassiere, spiked yellow Louboutins and ethnic slim-fit pants. The video then enters a new scene where Azalea arrives at a dive bar and switches a jukebox on. At the bar, Azalea's two friends from the Freightliner Truck scene are seated at a table, and a long-haired man wearing dark sunglasses awaits her on {{a chair in the}} centre of building. Azalea, dressed in a palm tree bikini and yellow neon shorts, performs a lap dance for the man. She then steals his car keys and runs off with her friends, who drive the man's convertible out into the desert. Azalea is seen standing in the car, waving a thin piece of material in the wind. They drive through a day and night period before arriving in Hollywood in the morning. Azalea's friends then drop her off at a sidewalk, where the video ends with her walking in the city. She wears dark sunglasses, striped black-and-white shorts and a <b>custom-made</b> dalmatian-print blazer in the final scene.|$|E
5|$|The tablets are {{arranged}} on the second, {{third and fourth}} of the five rows, with 24 tablets to William De Morgan's original design in the third, central, row, the 24 tablets added in 1908 directly below in the fourth row, and more recent additions above the original tiles in the second row. The first and fifth of the five rows remain empty. The first four tablets, designed and manufactured by DeMorgan and installed in 1900, were each made from two large <b>custom-made</b> tiles. Nine further De Morgan tablets, installed in 1902, were made using standard tiles to reduce costs, and were the last tiles whose installation was overseen by Watts. Eleven further DeMorgan tablets, along with T. H. Wren's memorial to Watts, were added in 1905, completing the central row of tablets. All 24 tablets of the 4th row, designed and manufactured by Royal Doulton, were added as a single batch in August 1908. A single Royal Doulton tablet to PC Alfred Smith was added in June 1919, followed in October 1930 by similar Royal Doulton tablets to three further police officers, and a replacement tablet with the correct details of the East Ham Sewage Works incident of 1895. A single tablet made by Fred Passenger in the original DeMorgan style, honouring schoolboy Herbert Maconoghu, was added in April 1931 {{to fill the gap}} in the centre row left by the removal of the original, incorrect tablet to the victims of the East Ham Sewage Works incident. In 2009 a 54th tablet was added, {{in the style of the}} Royal Doulton tiles, to commemorate print technician Leigh Pitt, the first addition to the wall for 78 years.|$|E
