2500|$|The band {{found some}} new {{popularity}} after signing with Trent Reznor's Nothing Records in the US, and touring with Nine Inch Nails, {{as well as}} having their songs used on the PlayStation game Loaded. In March 1995 the band released the Dos Dedos Mis Amigos remix album Two Fingers My Friends! which featured remixes by The Orb, Apollo 440 and Renegade Soundwave. [...] Crabb left the band in Summer 1995 - originally proposing to contribute in a non-touring capacity due to fatherhood - however, the band decided to replace him with Kerry Hammond on guitar and backing vocals, with Mansell taking over full vocal duties. The band decided to split in May 1996, (with 12 songs recorded and mixed {{in a state of}} near completion), and toured the UK briefly in June 1996 with a final live show at Roskilde. At this point, their set contained several unreleased songs from the unfinished album. Two tracks from this period were released at the time, a cover version of Gary Numan's [...] "Friends", and an instrumental track called [...] "Zero Return" [...] on a magazine sampler. [...] In 2013, the songs from the unfinished album were assembled into a bonus disc with the reissue of [...] "Dos Dedos Mis Amigos", comprising the 'unreleased 1996 album', now titled A Lick of the Old <b>Cassette</b> <b>Box.</b>|$|E

50|$|Early {{machines}} {{such as the}} Commodore 64 were tape-based, {{and hence}} had their games distributed on ordinary cassettes. When more advanced machines moved to floppy disks, the cassette boxes stayed in use for a while (e.g. Treasure Island Dizzy for the Amiga came on a floppy disk in a <b>cassette</b> <b>box).</b>|$|E
50|$|The crew {{took with}} them a {{cassette}} of Pink Floyd's newly released live album Delicate Sound of Thunder (minus the <b>cassette</b> <b>box,</b> for weight reasons) and played it in orbit; this was claimed by David Gilmour {{to have been the}} first rock music recording in space. The tape was left on Mir when the mission crew returned to Earth.|$|E
5000|$|The main {{differentiator}} between Story Teller and Disney'sStorytime was {{the fact}} that the latter featured only Disney characters. Storytime hit newsagents' shelves soon after Story Teller proved to be a bestseller. It was published in 24 parts and customised binders and <b>cassette</b> <b>boxes</b> were produced to house the collection (just like Story Teller). Classic Disney movies, such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) and Sleeping Beauty (1959), were serialised. (Note: the Australian and New Zealand versions of Story Teller were published as Story Time - not to be confused with Disney's Storytime series.) ...|$|R
50|$|Alchemist was {{designed}} and developed by Ian Weatherburn and Paul Lindale, and was Imagine Software's first arcade adventure. This release {{was also the first}} piece of software to be released on a gold-coloured <b>cassette</b> and <b>box.</b>|$|R
50|$|Mastertronic also notably {{pioneered the}} 'colour-coding' for games {{by having a}} {{coloured}} triangle on the top right hand corner of the front inlay and rectangles on the spine with the catalogue number and format, for example ZX Spectrum games were yellow, Commodore 64 were red, Amstrad were orange and MSX were white. This led many software houses to use variations on this theme but keep the colour-coding so people could easily identify the format, Mastertronic for a time went one step further and their 199 Range had the <b>cassette</b> <b>boxes</b> coloured the same. The US releases pioneered the plastic DVD-style cases now common among computer and console games.|$|R

Art Is Over consists of a single octopus tentacle housed in a <b>cassette</b> <b>box.</b> These non-music releases were typically released in even smaller quantities than the actual music releases, in quantities of 50 or less. Similar concepts are rampant throughout the band's catalogue, and often, the more ridiculous the theme or packaging of a release is, the more sought after it is by collectors. Copies of some Gerogerigegege records go for hundreds of dollars.|$|E
5000|$|The TV film {{received}} widely negative {{reviews and}} was criticized by many critics. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly slated the production, especially criticizing the writing and acting, saying: [...] "The actors in 'Birds II' {{have little to}} do except widen their eyes in terror, and even that seems a daunting stretch for Johnson." [...] He also commented on {{the fact that it was}} an Alan Smithee film, the pseudonym used when a director wants to disown the final film, writing [...] "...but the poster and <b>cassette</b> <b>box</b> that Showtime sent along with the review tape clearly state that Rick Rosenthal directed 'Birds II'", before adding [...] "He has good reasons to want his name erased from it. If it were me, I'd sue." ...|$|E

5000|$|At {{some point}} during each episode, they {{administer}} a quick quiz called [...] "Bra Eller Anus" [...] (translates to [...] "Good or Anus") in which the interviewee is presented with an idea, a thing or {{a description of a}} person, and must deem them [...] "bra" [...] or [...] "anus." [...] The quiz is introduced by an absurd theme song which is played on an equally ridiculously pimped-out <b>cassette</b> jam <b>box</b> that has traveled around America with them. The tape player was spectacularly destroyed in the final episode of the second season after it failed to work for an interview at the Knob Creek Gun Range in Kentucky.|$|R
50|$|Originally, most {{cassette}} singles {{were released}} {{in a cardboard}} sleeve that slipped over {{the outside of the}} release. This was then usually shrink wrapped in plastic. Some singles contained one song on each side, much as 45s had done, but others repeated the songs on both sides. In some markets, cassette singles generally used the same packaging as standard <b>cassettes,</b> a plastic <b>box</b> with a paper insert.|$|R
