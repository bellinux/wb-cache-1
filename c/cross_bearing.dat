After a brief stop in Britain, most likely on the Scottish coast, {{they crossed the}} channel and landed in Brittany in 585. At Saint-Malo in Brittany, there is a granite <b>cross</b> <b>bearing</b> the saint's name to which people once came to pray for rain in times of drought. The nearby village of Saint-Coulomb commemorates him in name.|$|E

A free-standing <b>cross,</b> <b>bearing</b> the body of Christ, may stand behind the altar. On the altar are a cloth covering, a large book containing the gospel readings performed during services, an ark containing presanctified divine gifts (bread and wine) distributed by the deacon or priest to those who cannot come to the church to receive them, and several white beeswax candles.|$|E

25|$|In November 1896 Saunière {{commissioned}} prestigious sculptor and painter Giscard of Toulouse (established in 1855) {{to decorate}} his church with new statues of the saints, Stations of the Cross, Baptismal font with statues of John baptising Jesus (bearing Ecce Agnus Dei), a bas-relief of Jesus giving the Sermon on the Mount above the Confessional, and {{a figure of}} a Devil supporting a Holy Water Stoup surmounted by Angels making the Sign of the <b>Cross,</b> <b>bearing</b> the inscriptions BS and Par Ce Signe Tu Le Vaincras ("By this sign you will conquer him"). All these items were chosen by Saunière from Giscard's catalogue. Although the 1896 edition of Giscard's catalogue has not survived, and later catalogues omit the statue of the Devil, its head bears a resemblance to the one found on the statue of the dragon being vanquished by Saint Michael that was also made by Giscard. The total sum involved was 2,500 Francs paid in annual installments of 500 Francs by Saunière beginning {{from the end of}} December 1897.|$|E
500|$|The {{first known}} attempt at European {{colonization}} began when Norsemen settled briefly at L'Anse aux Meadows in Newfoundland around 1000 AD. No further European exploration occurred until 1497, when Italian seafarer John Cabot explored and claimed Canada's Atlantic coast {{in the name}} of King Henry VII of England. Then Basque and Portuguese mariners established seasonal whaling and fishing outposts along the Atlantic coast in the early 16th century. In 1534, French explorer Jacques Cartier explored the Gulf of Saint Lawrence where, on July 24, he planted a [...] <b>cross</b> <b>bearing</b> the words [...] "Long Live the King of France" [...] and took possession of the territory New France {{in the name of}} King Francis I. In general the settlements appear to have been short-lived, possibly due to the similarity of outputs producible in Scandinavia and northern Canada and the problems of navigating trade routes at that time.|$|E
500|$|The Germans {{credited}} Richthofen with {{shooting down}} Ball, {{but there is}} some doubt as to what happened, especially as Richthofen's claim was for a Sopwith Triplane, not an S.E.5, which was a biplane. Given the amount of propaganda the German High Command generated touting the younger Richthofen, a high-level decision may have been taken to attribute Ball's death to him. It is probable that Ball was not shot down at all, but had become disoriented and lost control during his final combat, the victim of a form of temporary vertigo that has claimed other pilots. [...] Ball's squadron harboured hopes that he was a prisoner of war, and the British government officially listed him as [...] "missing" [...] on 18 May. There was much speculation in the press; in France, the Havas news agency reported: [...] "Albert Ball, the star of aviators... has been missing since the 7th May. Is he a prisoner or has he been killed? If he is dead, he died fighting for his forty-fifth victory." [...] It was only {{at the end of the}} month that the Germans dropped messages behind Allied lines announcing that Ball was dead, and had been buried in Annoeullin with full military honours two days after he crashed. Over the grave of the man they dubbed [...] "the English Richthofen", the Germans erected a <b>cross</b> <b>bearing</b> the inscription In Luftkampf gefallen für sein Vaterland Engl. Flieger Hauptmann Albert Ball, Royal Flying Corps ("Fallen in air combat for his fatherland English pilot Captain Albert Ball").|$|E

The Silver Cross was to be made entirely of silver, while the Gold and Commander's crosses where enamelled in white with blue edges. The ribbon consists of five pale blue and white stripes. For each repeat award, a silver 4-millimeter star was added to the ribbon.|$|E

2500|$|In 1914 {{the council}} chairman, Cyril Cobb offered to defray {{the cost of}} obtaining a grant of arms. Following discussions with the College of Arms, a design was {{submitted}} by the general purposes committee to the council on 24 February. The shield or arms featured a <b>cross</b> <b>bearing</b> an imperial crown between {{in the first and}} fourth quarters a depiction of the Tower of London, and {{in the second and third}} an ancient galley. A lion of England was to be shown the chief, or upper third of the shield. The suggested crest was a lion issuing from a mural crown and holding a banner of Saint George. The supporters were to be a Roman officer-of-arms and a Saxon warrior. The Latin motto loci dulcedo nos attinet or the pleasantness of the place holds us was suggested. This was adapted from the Annals of Tacitus, and was stated to be the earliest mention of London in history.|$|E
60|$|Is this so? Titles and badges {{of honor}} are vanity; {{and in the}} American Revolution you have his Excellency General Washington sending back, and with proper spirit sending back, a letter {{in which he is}} not {{addressed}} as Excellency and General. Titles are abolished; and the American Republic swarms with men claiming and bearing them. You have the French soldier cheered and happy in his dying agony, and kissing with frantic joy the chief's hand who lays the little cross on the bleeding bosom. At home you have the Dukes and Earls jobbing and intriguing for the Garter; the Military Knights grumbling at the Civil Knights of the bath; the little ribbon eager for the collar; the soldiers and seamen from India and the Crimea marching in procession before the Queen, and receiving from her hands the <b>cross</b> <b>bearing</b> her royal name. And, remember, there are not only the cross wearers, but all the fathers and friends; all the women who have prayed for their absent heroes; Harry's wife, and Tom's mother, and Jack's daughter, and Frank's sweetheart, each of whom wears in her heart of hearts afterwards the badge which son, father, lover, has won by his merit; each of whom is made happy and proud, and is bound to the country by that little bit of ribbon.|$|E

50|$|They {{are usually}} {{rough-hewn}} slabs or boulders, {{and in a}} few cases well-shaped <b>crosses,</b> <b>bearing</b> lettered and symbolic inscriptions of a rude sort and ornamental designs resembling those found on Celtic scriptures of the Gospels. Their lettered inscriptions are in Latin, Ogam or Scandinavian and Anglican runes, while some are uninscribed. Sculptured stones are usually found near ancient ecclesiastical sites, and their date is approximately fixed according to the character of the ornamentation. Some of these stones date as late as the 11th century. The Pictish stones from Scotland are particularly remarkable for their elaborate decoration and for certain symbolic characters to which as yet no satisfactory interpretation has been found.|$|R
