5|$|The {{most common}} and empirically {{supported}} method for assessing attachment in infants (11 months–17 months) is the Strange Situation Protocol, developed by Mary Ainsworth {{as a result of}} her careful in-depth observations of infants with their mothers in Baltimore, USA (see below). The Strange Situation Protocol is a research tool that was not intended for diagnostic purposes. While the procedure may be used to supplement clinical impressions, the resulting classifications should not be confused with the psychiatric diagnosis 'Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD)'. The clinical concept of RAD differs in a number of fundamental ways from the theory and research driven attachment classifications based on the Strange Situation Procedure. The idea that insecure attachments are synonymous with RAD is, in fact, not accurate and leads to ambiguity when formally discussing attachment theory as it has evolved in the research literature. This is not to suggest that the concept of RAD is without merit, but rather that the clinical and research <b>conceptualizations</b> <b>of</b> insecure attachment and attachment disorder are not synonymous.|$|E

Classifying defence mechanisms according to some of their properties (like underlying mechanisms, similarities or connections with personality) has been attempted. Different theorists have different categorizations and <b>conceptualizations</b> <b>of</b> defence mechanisms. Large reviews of theories of defence mechanisms are available from Paulhus, Fridhandler and Hayes (1997) and Cramer (1991). The Journal of Personality published a special issue on defence mechanisms (1998).|$|E
25|$|Most <b>conceptualizations</b> <b>of</b> group {{development}} are {{predicated on the}} belief that the group is closed, with unchanging membership (Schopler & Galinsky, 1990). The findings of an exploratory study conducted by Schopler and Galinsky (1990) concluded that movement beyond beginnings is possible. However, the impact of open membership is likely to result in a more cyclical pattern of group development with regression occurring when members enter and/or leave the group (Schopler & Galinsky, 1990).|$|E
25|$|Genie's {{is one of}} {{the best-known}} cases of {{language}} acquisition in a child with delayed linguistic development. Curtiss argued that Genie's case supported Chomsky's hypothesis of innate language, but that Genie demonstrated the necessity of early language stimulation in the left hemisphere of the brain to start. Because Genie had learned vocabulary and clearly mastered some principles of grammar Curtiss contended that she definitively disproved more extreme <b>conceptualizations</b> <b>of</b> the critical period hypothesis, which predicted that no or almost no language acquisition of any kind could occur after the end of critical period. Instead, she argued that Genie provided evidence for a gradual variation of it; that although some degree of acquisition can occur beyond puberty, permitting some form of ability to communicate using language, it would never progress into normal-sounding speech.|$|E

25|$|The {{most common}} and empirically {{supported}} method for assessing attachment in infants (12 months – 20 months) is the Strange Situation Protocol, developed by Mary Ainsworth {{as a result of}} her careful in-depth observations of infants with their mothers in Uganda(see below). The Strange Situation Protocol is a research, not a diagnostic, tool and the resulting attachment classifications are not 'clinical diagnoses.' While the procedure may be used to supplement clinical impressions, the resulting classifications should not be confused with the clinically diagnosed 'Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD).' The clinical concept of RAD differs in a number of fundamental ways from the theory and research driven attachment classifications based on the Strange Situation Procedure.

25|$|Embryo {{transfer}} {{may be used}} where a {{woman who}} has eggs but no uterus and wants to have a biological baby; she would require the help of a gestational carrier or surrogate to carry the pregnancy. Also, {{a woman who has}} no eggs but a uterus may utilize egg donor IVF, in which case another woman would provide eggs for fertilization and the resulting embryos are placed into the uterus of the patient. Fertilization may be performed using the woman's partner's sperm or by using donor sperm. 'Spare' embryos which are created for another couple undergoing IVF treatment but which are then surplus to that couple's needs may also be transferred (called embryo donation). Embryos may be specifically created by using eggs and sperm from donors and these can then be transferred into the uterus of another woman. A surrogate may carry a baby produced by embryo transfer for another couple, even though neither she nor the 'commissioning' couple is biologically related to the child. Third party reproduction is controversial and regulated in many countries. Persons entering gestational surrogacy arrangements must make sense of an entirely new type of relationship that does not fit any of the traditional scripts we use to categorize relations as kinship, friendship, romantic partnership or market relations. Surrogates have the experience of carrying a baby that they conceptualize as not of their own kin, while intended mothers have the experience of waiting through nine months of pregnancy and transitioning to motherhood from outside of the pregnant body. This can lead to new <b>conceptualizations</b> <b>of</b> body and self.|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 1970s and the 1980s, stimulated by results from {{mathematical}} logic and by some ideas of Quine, Putnam abandoned his long-standing defence of metaphysical realism—the {{view that the}} categories and structures of the external world are both causally and ontologically independent of the <b>conceptualizations</b> <b>of</b> the human mind. He adopted a rather different view, which he called [...] "internal realism".|$|E

[...] Other members of that school went further, claiming that Arab public opinion was [...] "unknowable, and therefore unfit for serious discussion." [...] A small minority considered the Arab street a concept bound with Pan-Arabism, by then largely discredited, and by extension similarly irrelevant.|$|E

He also mentioned a monster template designed by Matt Sernett that was originally written for the Monster Manual III and had been included in Libris Mortis.|$|E

500|$|In {{an earlier}} 2006 article, Bogaert {{acknowledges}} that {{a distinction between}} behavior and attraction has been accepted into recent <b>conceptualizations</b> <b>of</b> sexual orientation, which aids in positioning asexuality as such. He adds that, by this framework, [...] "(subjective) sexual attraction is the psychological core of sexual orientation", and also addresses {{that there may be}} [...] "some skepticism in [...] the academic and clinical communities" [...] about classifying asexuality as a sexual orientation, and that it raises two objections to such a classification: First, he suggests that there could be an issue with self-reporting (i.e., [...] "a 'perceived' or 'reported' lack of attraction," [...] particularly for definitions of sexual orientation that consider physical arousal over subjective attraction), and, second, he raises the issue of overlap between absent and very low sexual desire, as those with an extremely low desire may still have an [...] "underlying sexual orientation" [...] despite potentially identifying as asexual.|$|E

In contrast, the respondents tended to associate personal failures more to the impoverished than homeless individuals.|$|E
40|$|Despite recent {{advances}} in group cognition research, a clear <b>conceptualization</b> <b>of</b> collective cognition is lacking. In order to assist researchers in their <b>conceptualization</b> <b>of</b> group cognition, a separation between shared cognitions and shared theories is proposed. Shared cognitions can be operationally defined as cognitive functioning shared {{by a set of}} group members (e. g., shared rationale for decision making process), while shared theories can be understood as perceptual beliefs shared by a set of group members (e. g., shared norms, values, identities). Using this dual process model, evidence for a <b>conceptualization</b> <b>of</b> group cognition as shared social theories will be delineated, and implications for understanding past research in group cognition and decision making will be discussed. Just as individual decisions are different from group decisions, the cognitions that underlie those decisions can also vary. Researchers have provided support for such a conclusion by showing that a group’s collective cognition can be separated from each individual’s cognition in the group (e. g., Larson & Christensen, 1993). Despite {{recent advances}} in group cognition research (for a recent review see Mathieu, Maynard, Rapp, & Gilson, 2008), a clear <b>conceptualization</b> <b>of</b> collective cognition is lacking.

2500|$|These {{observations}} and others appear {{to contradict the}} law of effect, and they have prompted some researchers to propose new <b>conceptualizations</b> <b>of</b> operant reinforcement [...] (e.g.) [...] A more general view is that autoshaping is an instance of classical conditioning; the autoshaping procedure has, in fact, {{become one of the}} most common ways to measure classical conditioning. [...] In this view, many behaviors can be influenced by both classical contingencies (stimulus-response) and operant contingencies (response-reinforcement), and the experimenter’s task is to work out how these interact.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{multiple}} <b>conceptualizations</b> <b>of</b> psychopathy, [...] including Cleckleyan psychopathy (Hervey Cleckley's conception entailing bold, disinhibited behavior, and [...] "feckless disregard") and criminal psychopathy (a conception entailing a meaner, more aggressive, disinhibited, with persistent and sometimes serious criminal behavior). The latter conceptualization is typically {{used as the}} modern clinical concept and assessed by the Psychopathy Checklist. The label [...] "psychopath" [...] may have implications and stigma related to decisions about punishment severity for criminal acts, medical treatment, civil commitments, etc. Efforts have therefore been made to clarify {{the meaning of the}} term.|$|E
