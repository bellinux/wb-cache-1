5|$|Several Gibraltar Police officers, {{including}} Special Branch officers, gave {{evidence about}} {{the aftermath of the}} shootings and the subsequent police investigation. Immediately after the shootings, the soldiers' shell <b>casings</b> were removed from the scene (making it difficult to assess where the soldiers were standing when they fired); two Gibraltar Police officers testified to collecting the <b>casings,</b> one for fear that they might be stolen and the other on the orders of a superior. Statements from other police and military witnesses revealed that the Gibraltar Police had lost evidence and that the soldiers did not give statements to the police until over a week after the shootings.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 25 people were shot, six of whom died (including the perpetrator, who shot himself before police arrived). One witness {{reported}} that the gunman shot at least 30 rounds; police later collected 48 shell <b>casings</b> and 6 shotgun shells.|$|E
5|$|Maintenance problems. The {{chain-driven}} {{valve gear}} {{proved to be}} expensive to maintain and subject to rapid wear. Leaks from the oil bath onto the wheels caused oil to splash onto the boiler lagging. Once saturated with oil, the lagging attracted coal dust and ash, which provided combustible material, and sparks from heavy braking would set the lagging on fire underneath the air-smoothed casing. The fires were also attributed to oil overflowing from axlebox lubricators onto the wheels when stationary, to be flung upwards into the boiler lagging in service. In either case, the local fire brigade would be called to put the fire out, with cold water coming {{into contact with the}} hot boiler causing stress to the <b>casings.</b> Many photographs show an un-rebuilt locomotive with warped <b>casings,</b> the result of a lagging fire.|$|E
30|$|A five string <b>casing</b> {{program is}} {{recommended}} for use in these conditions. The five string <b>casing</b> system will include the drive pipe, aquifer <b>casing,</b> coal protection <b>casing,</b> intermediate <b>casing,</b> and production <b>casing.</b> This <b>casing</b> program has been widely used in Marcellus gas well completions in PA and surrounding areas where the well clusters happen to be near coal mines using the longwall mining method. A model has been developed for <b>casing</b> design by including the stress and strain results from our numerical analysis of ground in the longwall mining areas. Our model helps select <b>casing</b> lengths, <b>casing</b> sizes, and bit sizes.|$|R
50|$|In {{petroleum}} production, the <b>casing</b> hanger is {{that portion}} of a wellhead assembly which provides support for the <b>casing</b> string when it is lowered into the wellbore. It serves {{to ensure that the}} <b>casing</b> is properly located. When the <b>casing</b> string has been run into the wellbore it is hung off, or suspended, by a <b>casing</b> hanger, which rests on a landing shoulder inside the <b>casing</b> spool. Casing hangers must be designed to take the full weight of the <b>casing,</b> and provide a seal between the <b>casing</b> hanger and the spool.|$|R
40|$|AbstractCasing {{dislocation}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} serious forms for <b>casing</b> damage in petroleum engineering, especially <b>casing</b> failure in oil field will cause the great economic losses. Aimed at wellbore <b>casing</b> in oil field, dislocation mechanism and fracture theory of <b>casing</b> are introduced. Rupture model and Fracture model for <b>casing</b> failure crossing fault are established by ADINA. According to numerical results, the effects of various factors on <b>casing</b> failure are analyzed, such as the damage level of <b>casing</b> under different <b>casing</b> thickness and the fault angle. Crack propagation of broken <b>casing</b> has been investigated. It can provide theoretical basis for safety production and protection of oil field...|$|R
5|$|The launch was {{the first}} to use a newly {{developed}} high-performance motor for the solid rocket boosters, which gave approximately 7% greater thrust, and the second-last to use the original standard-mass steel <b>casings</b> for the boosters. These had been replaced by a thinner case, saving some , on STS-6 and STS-7, but because of safety concerns the next two flights used the conventional cases.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{problems}} {{with some of}} the more novel features of Bulleid's design, all members of the class were modified by British Railways during the late 1950s, losing their air-smoothed <b>casings</b> in the process.

The two men bragged to a female friend about the shooting; the friend told her mother, who {{notified}} the Haywood County Sheriff's Department. Investigators traced the shell <b>casings</b> to Schlesselman and Cowart, and notified the Crockett County Sheriff's Department, who took the pair into custody after spotting the Swastikas, slurs and 88 and 14 numbers on their car.|$|E
30|$|To {{determine}} {{all types}} of <b>casing’s</b> sizes applied in a well, one needs to start from the smallest <b>casing</b> string to be run in a hole. Once the smallest <b>casing</b> is fixed, other series of <b>casing</b> size and hole sizes can be determined. The smallest <b>casing</b> size is selected based on well testing and logging tools and production tools to be run in the well. In our case, the production <b>casing,</b> which is the smallest <b>casing,</b> is 5 1 / 2 in. Figure  6 shows a typical tubing and bit selection chart. The bit sizes and other <b>casing</b> sizes can be selected according to this chart. After selecting the smaller <b>casing</b> sizes, proper bit and a larger <b>casing</b> string for the following run can be selected.|$|R
50|$|With the <b>casing</b> set depths determined, hole {{sizes and}} <b>casing</b> sizes must follow. The hole drilled for each <b>casing</b> string must {{be large enough}} to easily fit the <b>casing</b> inside it, {{allowing}} room for cement between the outside of the <b>casing</b> and the hole. Also, the inside diameter of the first <b>casing</b> string must {{be large enough to}} fit the second bit that will continue drilling. Thus, each <b>casing</b> string will have a subsequently smaller diameter.|$|R
30|$|The <b>casing</b> {{program is}} the most crucial feature that {{influences}} successful drilling operations and the longevity of the future geothermal fluid production. It implies assessing <b>casing</b> setting depths, a number of <b>casing</b> strings, nominal <b>casing</b> weight, <b>casing</b> material, type of connections and well completion. The main functions of <b>casing</b> programs are preventing <b>casing</b> deformation, supporting blow-out preventers and permanent wellhead, containing drilling and production fluids, preventing groundwater contamination, mitigating drilling fluid losses, protecting wells from corrosion, fracturing and erosion, preventing inter-zonal cross-contamination of geothermal fluids, defining a production zone and providing access to the reservoir (New Zealand Standard 2015). Conventional high-temperature (also called high-enthalpy) geothermal wells consist usually of three–four cemented <b>casing</b> strings. The typical <b>casing</b> program for most geothermal wells incorporates a conductor pipe, a surface <b>casing,</b> an intermediate <b>casing</b> which may serve as an anchor <b>casing</b> (i.e., <b>casing</b> string to which wellhead is attached), a production <b>casing</b> and an optional perforated liner (holed or slotted). All of these <b>casing</b> strings mentioned are cemented from <b>casing</b> shoe to top of <b>casing</b> string to prevent corrosion resulting from migration of reservoir fluids and to control thermal expansion during fluid production. A liner pipe, which is either suspended from a liner hanger or set at the well bottom, is usually left uncemented in the production section of the well. The completion is finalized by assembling a permanent wellhead {{at the top of}} the well. In most cases, it includes an expansion spool placed directly below the first master valve, which allows for expansion of the uppermost parts of the production <b>casing</b> string with respect to the anchor <b>casing</b> to which the permanent wellhead is attached.|$|R
5|$|Since 2012, Federal Cartridge Company {{produces}} a 5.7×28mm round under their American Eagle brand. Designated the AE5728A, this cartridge uses a 40-grain total metal jacket (TMJ) projectile, that is atypical {{in that it}} does not use a copper plated bullet; sectioned pictures show a very thick full copper jacket. The AE5728A <b>casings</b> are of FN manufacture, and the muzzle velocity is slightly lower than that of the SS197SR.|$|E
5|$|Advancements in {{microscopic}} stamping {{have led}} to a push for the inclusion of firing pin microstamping. The microstamp is etched onto the firing pin and is transferred to the cartridge during the firing process. Each firing pin would have a unique serial number allowing investigators to trace <b>casings</b> found at a crime scene to a known firearm. The practice is not in use , although California has enacted legislation that requires microstamping on all newly sold firearms. The law, and microstamping in general, has received significant opposition from gun manufacturers due to increased costs associated with introducing the microstamps into the manufacturing lines.|$|E
5|$|At Sandia Base, three Army officers, Captains Albert Bethel, Richard Meyer, and Bobbie Griffin {{attempted}} {{to re-create the}} Little Boy. They were supervised by Harlow W. Russ, an expert on Little Boy who served with Project Alberta on Tinian, and was now leader of the Z-11 Group of the Los Alamos Laboratory's Z Division at Sandia. Gradually, they managed to locate the correct drawings and parts, and figured out how they went together. Eventually, they built six Little Boy assemblies. Although the <b>casings,</b> barrels, and components were tested, no enriched uranium was supplied for the bombs. By early 1947, the problem caused by the Wigner effect {{was on its way}} to solution, and the three officers were reassigned.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Wear of <b>casing</b> string is {{a common}} {{phenomenon}} {{in the process of}} oil and gas exploitation, and it reduces collapse and burst strength of <b>casing</b> string. Stress of internal wall worn <b>casing</b> string must be analyzed to ensure strength of <b>casing</b> string. In the paper, wear form of <b>casing</b> string is assumed as a crescent-shape, and a half finite element model (FEM) of worn <b>casing</b> string, cement-loop and earth combined system is established using the symmetry. Geometry relationships of wear ratio (or wear depth) and the centre of drill pipe are established. Effects of variables such as wear ratio of <b>casing</b> string, magnification factor of wellbore, elastic modulus of cement-loop and working conditions on <b>casing</b> string stress are discussed respectively. Some conclusions are drawn: maximum stress in <b>casing</b> string increases with increased wear ratio of <b>casing</b> string, and ultimately exceeds the yield limit. Increase of magnification factor of wellbore will improve bearing capacity of <b>casing</b> string, but maximum stress in <b>casing</b> string decreases slower and slower with further increase in magnification factor of <b>casing</b> string, at the same time, stress decreases more in <b>casing</b> string than in cement-loop. Minimum stress in cement-loop increases and maximum stress in cement-loop fluctuates with increased elastic modulus of cement-loop, while both minimum and maximum stress in <b>casing</b> string first increases then decreases, the turning point is related to elastic modulus of <b>casing</b> string and earth, as well as the geometry relationships among them. The bigger pressure difference, the larger maximum stress exists in <b>casing</b> string...|$|R
40|$|Due to high {{operational}} {{and financial}} {{risks associated with}} the investments in the petroleum industry, all precautions are taken by the operators to achieve a safe and cost effective well completion. Casing design of a drilling program is a critical element which contributes greatly to safety and cost of the operation. The objective {{of this research was}} to develop a <b>casing</b> design program which enables the user to evaluate <b>casing</b> design proposed or implemented in a drilling campaign. The developed <b>casing</b> design program consists of sequential criteria to select <b>casing</b> setting depth and establish optimum <b>casing</b> strength. Knowledge on local pore pressure gradient and facture gradient are essential to select the <b>casing</b> setting depths. Since both the factors are regional stratigraphy dependants, <b>casing</b> setting depth selection was designed in the way it allows user to assign variables for these parameters. Developed <b>casing</b> design program was validated with the <b>casing</b> design done by Rahman, S. Sand Chilingar, G. V(1995). Validation results shows that the <b>casing</b> design of Rahman and Chilingar and the <b>casing</b> design done with the use of developed program are having similar <b>casing</b> setting depths except in the case of conductor <b>casing...</b>|$|R

5|$|Following the Palomares and Thule accidents—the only {{cases where}} the {{conventional}} explosives of U.S. nuclear bombs accidentally detonated and dispersed nuclear materials—investigators concluded the high explosive (HE) used in nuclear weapons was not chemically stable enough to withstand the forces involved in an aircraft accident.

5000|$|A rounded profile float shoe with an {{integral}} check valve attached {{to the bottom of}} a <b>casing</b> string prevents reverse flow, or U-tubing, of cement slurry from the annulus into the <b>casing</b> or flow of wellbore fluids into the <b>casing</b> string as it is run.

5|$|George Ivatt's 1945 {{report also}} {{recommended}} {{the removal of}} all streamlining <b>casings</b> and they {{were removed from the}} fitted locomotives from 1946 onwards. It had been found to be of little value at speeds below , and was unpopular with running shed employees as it caused difficulty of access for maintenance. The first step towards de-streamlining was carried out during the Second World War when many of the streamlined tenders had their side sheets cut away {{at the rear of the}} tender. Many photographs exist showing this measure. The removal of the streamlining proper commenced in April 1946 with No. 6235 City of Birmingham. All de-streamlining coincided with the fitting of smoke deflectors. No. 6243 City of Lancaster was renumbered as 46243 in April 1948 and as it was not de-streamlined until May 1949, when it became the only locomotive to carry its British Railways number while streamlined.|$|E
5|$|In Salinas, Genevevo Salinas of Houston had voluntarily gone to {{a police}} station when {{officers}} asked him to accompany them {{to talk about the}} murder of two men. Salinas answered most of the officers' questions, but simply remained silent when they asked him whether shotgun <b>casings</b> found {{at the scene of the}} murders would match his gun. He shifted his feet, and otherwise acted nervously, but did not say anything. Later, at his trial, prosecutors told jurors that his silence in the face of that question showed that he was guilty, that he knew that the shotgun used to kill the victims was his. Salinas' lawyer wanted the Supreme Court to rule that the simple fact of silence during police questioning, when an individual was not under arrest, could not be used against that person at a criminal trial.|$|E
30|$|Local {{buckling}} is buckling {{along the}} <b>casing</b> wall while the center {{line of the}} <b>casing</b> stays straight. This contrasts with column buckling where the center line of the <b>casing</b> bends. It occurs at very short lengths, when the <b>casing</b> is sufficiently well supported to prevent column buckling. Also, {{it is more likely}} to occur in the <b>casing</b> body near the connection. However, if {{there is a lack of}} support, critical column buckling would occur and dominate the <b>casing</b> damage prior to any significant local buckling. So, local buckling is believed to be not a problem for working through the <b>casing.</b> This is especially true if certain provisions are considered in the wellbore completion such as protection <b>casing</b> as will be discussed later in this paper.|$|R

5|$|The London Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) Coronation Class is a {{class of}} express {{passenger}} steam locomotives designed by William Stanier.

The locomotives were specifically designed for power as {{it was intended to}} use them on express services between London Euston and Glasgow Central; their duties were to include the hauling of a proposed non-stop express, subsequently named the Coronation Scot. The first ten locomotives of the Coronation class were built in a streamlined form in 1937 by the addition of a steel streamlined casing. Five of these ten were specifically set aside to pull the Coronation Scot. Although a later batch of five unstreamlined locomotives was produced in 1938, most of the ensuing Coronation class were outshopped as streamliners. Eventually, from 1944 to 1949, all new engines would be built in unstreamlined form and all the streamliners would have their <b>casings</b> removed.
