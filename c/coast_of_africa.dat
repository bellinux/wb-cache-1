5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the <b>coast</b> <b>of</b> <b>Africa</b> on August 24. It developed {{into an area}} of low pressure as it crossed the Atlantic, and organized into Tropical Depression Thirteen on August 28 while 960mi (1550km) east of the Lesser Antilles.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the <b>coast</b> <b>of</b> <b>Africa</b> on August 29. It tracked slowly westward, and first {{showed signs of}} development two days later. On August 31, a second tropical wave exited the <b>coast</b> <b>of</b> <b>Africa</b> at a faster speed than its predecessor. The two waves interacted, and by September 2 combined to form a large area of disturbed weather across the eastern Atlantic Ocean. Convection increased within the system, and it developed a concentrated area of convection {{in conjunction with a}} well-defined low pressure area. By late on September 3, the system maintained a broad closed circulation and enough convective organization to be classified Tropical Depression Six while located about midway between the Lesser Antilles and Africa.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{emerged into}} the Atlantic Ocean off the west <b>coast</b> <b>of</b> <b>Africa</b> {{during the last}} week of July. As it tracked across the Atlantic, it remained a well-defined system, but never organized into a tropical cyclone. On August8, the system entered the Gulf of Mexico, and by the following day, it developed a weak low-level circulation. The circulation became better defined later that day, and was confirmed by Reconnaissance aircraft that afternoon, when it was declared Tropical Depression Eight while east of Tamaulipas.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{exited the}} west <b>coast</b> <b>of</b> <b>Africa</b> and emerged into the Atlantic Ocean on September11. After tracking westward for five days, the wave entered the Caribbean Sea on September16. Convection steadily increased in both coverage and intensity, and by September19, the system reached the southwestern Caribbean Sea. Satellite imagery and surface observations indicated that Tropical Depression Nine formed at 1800UTC on September19, while located 50miles (80km) north-northwest of San Andres Island.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Charley {{began as}} a {{tropical}} wave that moved off the west <b>coast</b> <b>of</b> <b>Africa</b> in early August 2004. Tracking westward, the system gradually organized and was declared a tropical depression on August9 while located roughly 115mi (185km) south-southeast of Barbados. The following day, the depression intensified into a tropical storm and was given the name Charley after entering the eastern Caribbean Sea. Quickly tracking northwest, the small storm intensified.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Darby was {{the fourth}} named storm of the 1992 Pacific {{hurricane}} season. The origins of Darby were from a tropical wave which moved off the <b>coast</b> <b>of</b> <b>Africa</b> on June 19. It traversed the Atlantic, and moved across Mexico, where it re-emerged in the Pacific on June 29 and became a tropical depression on July 2, a tropical storm on July 5, and a hurricane on July 6. The storm remained well offshore, although it killed three people.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Georges {{began as}} a {{tropical}} wave that moved off the <b>coast</b> <b>of</b> <b>Africa</b> during mid-September 1998. Tracking westward, the wave spawned an {{area of low pressure}} two days later, which quickly strengthened into a tropical depression. On September16, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Georges, and to Hurricane Georges the next day. The storm reached its peak intensity on September20 with winds of 155mph (250km/h), just below Category 5 status on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Henri {{developed}} as Tropical Depression Eighteen {{in the extreme}} northwestern Caribbean Sea on September 14 from a tropical wave, which had previously moved off the <b>coast</b> <b>of</b> <b>Africa.</b> The formation of a tropical depression was confirmed by reports from Hurricane Hunters. The depression tracked northward, brushing the eastern portion of the Yucatán Peninsula. After reaching the Gulf of Mexico it turned sharply westward, with a ridge preventing further northward movement. The depression turned southwestward, and intensified into Tropical Storm Henri on September 16.|$|E
5|$|In early August, a {{disturbance}} {{was observed in}} satellite images moving off the <b>coast</b> <b>of</b> <b>Africa</b> on August 4. Moving westward along the Intertropical Convergence Zone at a forward speed of roughly , the disturbance {{showed no signs of}} development until a cloud mass broke away from the ITCZ on August 6. The separated mass began rapidly organizing, becoming Tropical Depression Three late on August 7. The tropical depression continued to gain organization and was upgraded to a tropical storm on August 8, receiving the name Cora.|$|E
5|$|Météo-France's {{meteorological}} office at Réunion (MFR) issued advisories for storms {{in the basin}} during the year. At the time, the MFR area of warning responsibility was from the <b>coast</b> <b>of</b> <b>Africa</b> to 80°E, and the agency primarily used the Dvorak technique to estimate the intensities of tropical cyclones.

5|$|On August 11, 2007, a {{vigorous}} tropical wave moved off the west <b>coast</b> <b>of</b> <b>Africa,</b> producing disorganized showers and thunderstorms.

5|$|On July 16, 1970, a large {{disturbance}} {{separated from}} the Intertropical Convergence Zone near Panama. The broad area of convection dominated the region between Swan Island and western Cuba by July 18. Some sources state that the area of convection was joined by a low-level vortex that entered the area, eventually forming a depression. Others believe that the origins of Becky can be tracked back to a tropical wave that moved off the <b>coast</b> <b>of</b> <b>Africa</b> on July 9.|$|E
5|$|On July 24, a {{tropical}} wave moved off the <b>coast</b> <b>of</b> <b>Africa</b> and tracked westward.
