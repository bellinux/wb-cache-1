However, in 2004, Nathan Mayer Rothschild left the precious metals business in London and sold its place on the fixing to Barclays. From that time onwards, the fixing has taken place via a dedicated <b>conference</b> <b>line.</b> This was clearly a necessity as some banks moved their London operations away from the close proximity to the Bank of England and gravitated to areas such as Canary Wharf.|$|E
5000|$|FEMA {{came under}} intense {{criticism}} {{when it was}} revealed that a press conference on the October 2007 California wildfires was staged. Deputy Administrator Harvey E. Johnson was answering questions from FEMA employees who were posing as reporters. Many of these questions were [...] "soft ball" [...] questions (i.e., [...] "Are you happy with FEMA's response so far?"), intentionally asked {{in a way that would}} evoke a positive response giving the impression that FEMA was doing everything right. In this way, any scrutiny from real reporters (many of whom were only given a 15-minute notice) would have been avoided. Fox News, MSNBC, and other media outlets aired the staged press briefing live. Real reporters were notified only 15 minutes in advance and were only able to call in to a <b>conference</b> <b>line,</b> which was set to [...] "listen-only" [...] mode. The only people there were primarily FEMA public affairs employees.|$|E

The audio signals are converted to a PCM companded eight-bit parallel signal followed by a conversion to a serial signal for transmitting to a remote location and then reconverting each of the companded signals to a first-eight-bit parallel signal. The eight-bit parallel signal is fed to one input of a pre-programmed ROM. This eight-bit signal provides one-half of a sixteen-bit address of a lookup ROM. The other half of the sixteen-bit ROM address is supplied by another suscriber over an identical circuit...|$|E

5000|$|In December 2012, Martell {{announced}} {{that the company has}} introduced <b>conference</b> <b>lines</b> that allowed dial-in initiated by the entrepreneurs and experts themselves to replace the initial function that would contact participants directly at appointment times. Martell explained that the change was necessary due to the increase in demand and had increased Clarity's call-completion rate: [...] "In the early days, we had this idea of a call list, so you could request a call of somebody, and if they were free it would call you back ... Before, our call-completion rate was only around 20 percent, and now it’s around 70 percent”.|$|R

Teams played one team outside of their pod four times, twice at home and twice away, and played {{the rest of the}} teams outside their pod twice, once at home and once away. This resulted in a thirty-game season for each team, and had the additional advantage of reducing travel costs. The season ended a playoff format to crown a league champion.|$|R

40|$|The {{overseas}} freight {{bill for}} New Zealand is estimated {{for the year}} ending 30 June 1980 to be $ 1. 2 billion. The burden of this freight charge predominantly falls on New Zealand exporters and importers. Since a high portion of this 	charge is incurred in foreign exchange, the escalating sea freight bill contributes significantly to New Zealand's poor 	balance of payments position. The paper addresses a number of questions: Q 1. 	Have shipping freight rates increased faster than other costs in our economy? The {{answer to this question}} is yes. Q 2. 	What has led to such high freight rate increases? The answer to this question is associated {{with a high level of}} capital invested in cellular containerships over the past decade and the increasing cost of oil based fuels. There would appear to have been few productivity gains to compensate for such increased costs. Q 3. How do these freight rate increases affect farm gate returns? The answer to this question is that any increase in sea freight rates results in a corresponding drop in farm gate returns. Q 4. 	What are the arguments for and against sole use of the <b>Conference</b> <b>Lines?</b> Seven arguments used in support of sole use are detailed. Two arguments used by those opposed to exclusive use of the <b>Conference</b> <b>Lines</b> follow. In my opinion the balance of argument favours those opposed to sole use but more investigation is required before a specific policy change can be recommended. Q 5. 	What course of action should be pursued? Producer Boards and Government Departments must put New Zealand in a position of strength by investigating alternative shipping systems in a serious manner. Over the next year or so every support should be given to those who are probing the present shipping system...|$|R
