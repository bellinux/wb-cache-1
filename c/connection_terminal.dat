This type of transformer is frequently employed in low power, low voltage transformers in which the tap point often may {{take the form of}} a transformer <b>connection</b> <b>terminal,</b> requiring the input line to be disconnected by hand and connected to the new terminal. Alternatively, in some systems, the process of tap changing may be assisted by means of a rotary or slider switch.|$|E
5000|$|The screw {{terminals}} are hollow and allow up {{to at least}} three 1 mm (CSA) wires, twisted together, to be inserted {{to a depth of}} up to 10 mm and secured with a set screw. The contact terminal set screws are installed at a slight angle to allow easier screwdriver access after the switch mechanism has been installed into a wall-plate - before fixing the wall-plate to the wall. Also shown is a “loop” <b>connection</b> <b>terminal.</b> This terminal plays no part in the action of the switch but, because there is available space, it is provided as an insulated terminal for joining other wires, if required (such as the neutral wires). Each Australian rocker switch mechanism is actually a Single Pole Double Throw (SPDT) Switch, also known as a [...] "two-way switch", and has three terminals.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a “flexbattery” modular battery pack concept that integrates {{the function of}} energy storage, active cell balancing, and bidirectional multilevel power conversion. As a result, the flexbattery pack {{does not have a}} positive or negative terminal, but terminals that can operate at arbitraryvoltage levels, both positive or negative. Since each <b>connection</b> <b>terminal</b> can generate a variable voltage within a certain range, the system can also supply ac voltage. Therefore, with appropriate control this innovative flexbattery could be directly applied to an electrical motor. Also, the flexbattery pack can be charged from any voltage level within the nominal output range of the pack, both dc or ac. The elementary flexbattery unit is introduced and analyzed together with the operation of a pack. Additionally, the concept has been experimentally verified with a 120 W three-unit, nine-level prototype under both ac and dc operation...|$|E
40|$|Generally, {{hand-operated}} and hydraulic compressors use crimping {{of connection}} terminals. However, this equipment often causes compressed defects because non-uniform pressure is {{applied in the}} circumferential direction of the terminal during crimping. A defective terminal often leads to fire in electric equipment due to overheating. Therefore, {{there is a need}} to develop a new crimping process for manufacturing highly durable terminals. MPC (magnetic pulse crimping) uses uniform electromagnetic pressure by a high magnetic field interaction between coil and terminal. This process uses only electromagnetic pressure for crimping, so the terminal can be crimped without physical contact, thereby producing a highly durable <b>connection</b> <b>terminal.</b> In this study, a MPC process was developed to fabricate a prototypical terminal. The result was compared with other crimping processes in terms of durability. The crimped part using MPC has a lower rising temperature and higher tensile strength than those using other crimping process. It is inferred from the experimental results that an optimal charging voltage exists in the MPC proces...|$|E
40|$|This Master's Thesis explores {{possibility}} {{to establish a}} service connection to distributed M 2 M terminal devices. The service connection can not be established directly because terminal devices are connected to networks which use network address translation or firewalls. For this reason, new software components were developed to enable the service connection {{in a way that}} command is given from the server but actual connection is established by the terminal device. The service connection was implemented using reverse tunnel provided by SSH software. SSH solved the network address translation problem but not the firewall problem. To bypass firewalls, the current measurement software was modified {{in a way that it}} is possible to force the terminal device to use GPRS connection instead of Ethernet because GPRS network has no firewalls. In testing phase, a Linux kernel and driver modules in terminal devices was updated using the service <b>connection.</b> <b>Terminal</b> devices were located in eight different countries and were installed on four different types of machinery. As a result, all the terminal devices succeeded to update...|$|E

40|$|Due to the connection-oriented {{nature of}} the {{asynchronous}} transfer mode (ATM), {{one of the challenges}} in mobile wireless ATM (WATM) systems is the management of terminal handovers. When ATM connections are reestablished to follow terminals moving between areas covered by distinct base stations, seamless handover protocols are necessary to guarantee that ATM cells are delivered to terminals in the correct order, with cell loss rate and delay that satisfy the contracted quality of service (QoS). A promising approach to meet QoS requirements is based on the use of handover buffers at the (destination) base station, where transmitted cells are stored while the connection is being reestablished. Up to date, only simulation and experimental results are available to determine the performance of such protocols and buffering schemes. This paper presents the first attempt to develop an analytical modeling approach to estimate the performance of handover protocols making use of handover buffers at the base station. By incorporating several approximations, the proposed models allow designers to simultaneously take into account numerous system parameters, including handover buffer size, sustainable and peak cell rates of the ATM <b>connection,</b> <b>terminal</b> offered load, and time needed to reestablish the ATM connection. Analytical performance predictions are shown to closely match results of detailed simulation experiments, thus demonstrating the suitability of the proposed modeling framework for the selection of the most adequate solution to handle handover and provide the QoS required by end users...|$|E

50|$|With the {{exception}} of flights from destinations with U.S. Customs and Border Protection preclearance, all inbound international flights arrive at Terminal 5, as the other terminals do not have screening facilities. Several carriers, such as American, Iberia, Lufthansa and United, with outbound international flights depart from Terminals 1 and 3. This arrangement requires that passengers disembark at Terminal 5 and then, crews tow the empty plane to another terminal for boarding.
