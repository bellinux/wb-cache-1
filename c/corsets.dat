5|$|Metal medical <b>corsets</b> {{were still}} being made in the twentieth century, whilst, since the late 20th century, fashion {{designers}} such as Alexander McQueen and Issey Miyake have made contemporary metal bodices and <b>corsets</b> from wire and aluminium coils.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the more}} extreme {{examples}} of metal <b>corsets</b> that have survived are now generally thought to be later reproductions designed to appeal to fetishists, rather than garments intended for fashionable wear.|$|E
5|$|Metal <b>corsets</b> {{for medical}} {{purposes}} {{continued to be}} used in the 18th and early 19th century, although equivalent garments made from canvas were increasingly used in their place. In 1894, A.M. Phelps of the American Orthopaedic Association recommended an aluminium corset coated with waterproof enamel for sufferers of Pott disease or curvature of the spine. Made from a cast of the patient's body, the advantages of such a garment were that aluminium was lightweight, durable, thin enough to be worn beneath clothing, and could be worn while bathing. Such <b>corsets</b> were still being recommended in the early 20th century as cheaper and more durable in the longer run than plaster moulds, although their initial expense was greater.|$|E
50|$|The {{straight}}-front <b>corset,</b> {{also known}} as the swan-bill <b>corset,</b> the S-bend <b>corset</b> or the health <b>corset,</b> was worn from circa 1900 to the early 1910s. Its name is derived from the very rigid, straight busk inserted in the center front of the <b>corset.</b> This <b>corset</b> forced the torso forward and made the hips jut out in back.|$|R
50|$|A bondage <b>corset,</b> {{used for}} {{activities}} of or relating to bondage, is a full-figured <b>corset</b> that {{is sometimes called}} a discipline <b>corset.</b>|$|R
50|$|A neck <b>corset</b> (sometimes called <b>corset</b> collar or neck lacer) {{is a type}} of BDSM collar. Unlike {{a normal}} <b>corset</b> which {{compresses}} the waist, a neck <b>corset</b> is usually not used to compress the neck, except in breathplay. It may act as a posture collar that incorporates stays.|$|R
5|$|As {{a medical}} garment, metal <b>corsets</b> endured {{well into the}} 20th century. The Mexican painter Frida Kahlo was a notable wearer of such medical <b>corsets,</b> {{following}} ongoing problems {{as a result of}} a serious road crash she experienced as a teenager. By 1944, Kahlo's doctors had recommended that she wear a steel corset instead of the plaster ones she had mainly worn since the accident; and Kahlo, whose paintings were heavily autobiographical, used the new corset as the basis for one of her best known self-portraits, The Broken Column. In the painting, Kahlo portrays herself weeping with agony, her torso split open revealing that her spine is a crumbling Ionic column, and her damaged body held together by the steel corset. A form of metal corset or orthopaedic brace used in the second half of the 20th century is called a Harris brace after its inventor, R.I. Harris. Harris braces are designed to immobilise the waist whilst healing, and are made with two bendable metal bands worn above and below the waist, and connected with rigid metal supports.|$|E
5|$|Verena Dietzel, {{creator of}} the fashion label V-Couture, who specializes in {{different}} kinds of <b>corsets,</b> were enlisted to create clothing for the video, {{as well as a}} Grammy Awards performance. Dietzel explained that she had initially thought Madonna's e-mail as spam, however after confirmation from the singer's assistant stylist, B. Åkerlund, she started working on the designs. Within 48 hours she sewed a new corset, as well as created two new ones, by basing them on the only information provided to her, that of Madonna's bra-size. She had to search on Google for deducing the rest of the singer's proportions. In total four different <b>corsets</b> were shipped off to Madonna. Lebanese designer Shady Zeineldine was also contacted by Åkerlund, who visited the designer's press conference in Los Angeles, and asked him to send his ideas and sketches for the video. After the deal was finalized, he created a custom made matador jacket which Madonna wore in the video. Another dress was a bodysuit, featuring a nude satin-stretch corset covered in three different types of lace, a black chiffon silk top and a satin tie. There was also a red velvet bolero jacket.|$|E
5|$|A steel corset in the Stibbert Museum, Florence, Italy, is {{dated to}} the mid-16th century, and {{thought to be}} similar to the metal stays {{recorded}} as having been made by a corazzaio mastro (master armour-maker) for Eleanor of Toledo and delivered to her on 28 February 1549. However, as Eleanor's wardrobe records do not list any boned or stiffened <b>corsets,</b> it is thought that her steel bodice was designed for medical or therapeutic reasons rather than worn as a fashionable garment.|$|E

5|$|In 1886, Johann Gottfried Spiesshofer and Michael Braun {{founded a}} factory for the {{production}} of <b>corsets</b> in Heubach (Baden-Wurttemberg). They first employed six people on the same number of sewing machines. That number rose to 150 people in 1890, and in 1894 their first exports were sent abroad, to England. It was only in 1902 that Spieshofer and Braun registered the Triumph brand, which was reminiscent of the Parisian Arc de Triomphe, to which International was later added. After the economic boom in the 1920s, demand for the classic corset declined, which is why the company began parallel production of brassieres. In the 1930s, Triumph International also began producing corselets.|$|E
5|$|Metal <b>corsets</b> {{are found}} {{in a number of}} museum {{collections}} around the world. Some museums, including the Museo Stibbert, and the Kyoto Costume Institute in Japan, present their metal bodices as fashionable late 16th-century garments. The Victoria and Albert Museum in London describes their iron corset (formerly owned by the painter Talbot Hughes) as dating from the 18th century and likely intended for orthopaedic purposes. Others, such as the iron corset in the Fashion Institute of Technology, are presented as fakes.|$|E
5|$|Since the 20th century, actual metal <b>corsets</b> have {{occasionally}} {{been made}} for contemporary wear, although such instances are rare. Steele notes that alongside a 1930s metal corset made for and worn by a fetish corsetiere called Cayne, the late 20th- and early 21st-century tight-lacer Cathie Jung had a silver corset-cover made to wear over her actual laced corset. Between 1933 and 1940 Mrs. Cayne advertised a booklet describing her 14-inch waistline and offered other services in the Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News.|$|E
50|$|There is some {{controversy}} regarding the publication {{and promotion of}} images of <b>corset</b> piercing. Almost all of the photographs of <b>corset</b> piercing are of fresh piercings, which {{have not had the}} time to reject, migrate or otherwise fail to heal properly. Images used in advertising or magazines may be photoshopped or airbrushed to eliminate indications of swelling, redness, or infection, further promoting the illusion that these piercings are easy, or even possible to heal. Photographs of <b>corset</b> piercings done with captive bead rings, which are inappropriate for permanent <b>corset</b> piercings, vastly outnumber photographs of <b>corset</b> piercings done as proper surface piercings. Usually <b>corset</b> piercings are photographed laced, also leading the public to believe that they can be worn laced at all times, which is not possible, even in a well healed, permanent <b>corset</b> piercing.|$|R
25|$|A <b>corset</b> dress (also {{known as}} hobble <b>corset</b> because it {{produces}} similar restrictive effects to a hobble skirt) {{is a long}} <b>corset.</b> It is like an ordinary <b>corset,</b> but it is long {{enough to cover the}} legs, partially or totally. It thus looks like a dress, hence the name. A person wearing a <b>corset</b> dress can have great difficulty in walking {{up and down the stairs}} (especially if wearing high-heeled footwear) and may be unable to sit down if the boning is too stiff.|$|R

5|$|The {{budget for}} the film's costumes was US$1,600, {{far more than the}} stage {{production}} budget, but having to double up on costumes for filming was expensive. For filming, <b>corsets</b> for the finale had to be doubled for the pool scene, with one version drying while the other was worn on set. While many of the costumes are exact replicas from the stage productions, other costumes were new to filming, such as Columbia's gold sequined swallow-tail coat and top hat and Magenta's maid's uniform.|$|E
25|$|In the 1820s, fashion changed again, {{with the}} {{waistline}} lowered back to almost the natural position. <b>Corsets</b> {{began to be}} made with some padding and more boning. Some women made their own, while others bought their <b>corsets.</b> <b>Corsets</b> {{were one of the}} first mass-produced garments for women. <b>Corsets</b> began to be more heavily boned in the 1840s. By 1850, steel boning became popular.|$|E
25|$|<b>Corsets</b> that {{enhanced}} cleavage {{were introduced}} in the mid-16th century. By the late 18th century, cleavage-enhancing <b>corsets</b> grew more dramatic in pushing the breasts upward. The tight lacing of <b>corsets</b> worn in the 19th and early 20th centuries emphasized both cleavage {{and the size of}} the bust and hips. Especially evening or ball gowns were designed to display and emphasize the décolletage.|$|E

5000|$|The {{hourglass}} {{became the}} iconic <b>corset</b> shape. They are {{featured in the}} media; often {{the image of the}} <b>corset</b> shown is of a [...] "woman clutching a bedpost while their maid pulls and pulls at the <b>corset</b> strings". The hourglass <b>corset</b> accentuated slim waists and broadened the bust, shoulders and hips. These elements worked in tandem with very wide skirts, large sleeves, and sloping shoulders to create the wide-slim-wide hourglass figure.|$|R
25|$|Yet, <b>corsets</b> {{have been}} blamed for causing lots of {{diseases}} because of the tight waist bound. Ill condition examples were curvature of the spine, deformities of the ribs and birth defects. As a result, people started to oppose the use of <b>corsets</b> in later times.|$|E
25|$|<b>Corsets</b> {{also began}} to be worn about this time. At first they were called pairs of bodies, which refers to a {{stiffened}} decorative bodice worn {{on top of another}} bodice stiffened with buckram, reeds, canes, whalebone or other materials. These were not the small-waisted, curved <b>corsets</b> familiar from the Victorian era, but straight-lined stays that flattened the bust.|$|E
25|$|With {{the advent}} of metal eyelets, tight lacing became possible. The {{position}} of the eyelets changed. They were situated across from one another at the back. The front was fastened with a metal busk in front. <b>Corsets</b> were mostly white. The <b>corsets</b> of the 1850s–1860s were shorter than the <b>corsets</b> of the 19th century through 1840s. This was because {{of a change in}} the silhouette of women's fashion. The 1850s and 1860s emphasized the hoopskirt. After the 1860s, when the hoop fell out of style, the corset became longer to mold the abdomen, exposed by the new lines of the princess or cuirass style.|$|E
5000|$|In addition, {{the term}} [...] "training corset" [...] may simply {{refer to a}} <b>corset</b> {{which is used to}} {{acclimate}} the body prior to wearing a full <b>corset</b> as an everyday undergarment, or to any <b>corset</b> worn by somebody undertaking training (achieving a desired body shape).|$|R

25|$|During the Edwardian period, the {{straight}} front <b>corset</b> (also {{known as the}} S-Curve <b>corset)</b> was introduced. This <b>corset</b> was straight in front with a pronounced curve at the back that forced the upper body forward and the derrière out. This style was worn from 1900 to 1908.|$|R
25|$|There {{are some}} special types of <b>corsets</b> and corset-like devices which {{incorporate}} boning.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} and {{well-known}} use of <b>corsets</b> is to slim the body and make it conform to a fashionable silhouette. For women, this most frequently emphasizes a curvy figure by reducing the waist and thereby exaggerating the bust and hips. However, in some periods, <b>corsets</b> have been worn to achieve a tubular straight-up-and-down shape, which involved minimizing the bust and hips.|$|E

5000|$|A {{training}} <b>corset</b> {{is generally}} a <b>corset</b> used in body modification. A training <b>corset</b> {{may be used}} for orthopedic reasons (such as to correct a crooked spine) or for cosmetic reasons (to achieve a smaller waistline, commonly called waist training or in more extreme cases tightlacing.) ...|$|R
25|$|In the past, a woman's <b>corset</b> {{was usually}} worn over a chemise, a {{sleeveless}} low-necked gown made of washable material (usually cotton or linen). It absorbed perspiration {{and kept the}} <b>corset</b> and the gown clean. In modern times, a tee shirt, camisole or <b>corset</b> liner may be worn.|$|R
2500|$|In 1828, {{the word}} <b>corset</b> came into general {{use in the}} English language. The word was used in The Ladies Magazine to {{describe}} a [...] "quilted waistcoat" [...] that the French called un <b>corset.</b> It was used to differentiate the lighter <b>corset</b> from the heavier stays of the period.|$|R
