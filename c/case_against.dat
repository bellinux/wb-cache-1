5|$|Henry II's biographer, the {{historian}} W. L. Warren, suggests that Hilary was pressed {{to bring the}} <b>case</b> <b>against</b> Battle Abbey by his cathedral chapter, and that Hilary did not pursue the case vigorously. The historian Henry Mayr-Harting, sees the <b>case</b> <b>against</b> the abbey as the lone exception in Hilary's long career {{of support for the}} royal position against the papacy, and argues that the only reason Hilary opposed the king in this respect was that it was Hilary's own rights as a diocesan bishop that were being flouted. Mayr-Harting also suggests that Theobald of Bec was supporting Hilary's efforts to assert Chichester's rights.|$|E
5|$|In March 1991, the <b>case</b> <b>against</b> Amedo and Dominguez in {{relation}} to the Monbar attack was dropped due to lack of evidence.

5|$|Families of 45 of the 47 {{passengers}} sued Comair for negligence. (Families of {{the other}} two victims settled with the airline before filing litigation.) Three sample cases were due to be heard on August 4, 2008; but the trial was indefinitely postponed after Comair reached a settlement with the majority of the families. Cases brought by Comair against the airport authority and the FAA, arguing each should share in the compensation payments, are now resolved. The <b>case</b> <b>against</b> the airport authority was dismissed on sovereign immunity grounds, and this ruling was upheld by the Kentucky Supreme Court on October 1, 2009. In Comair's <b>case</b> <b>against</b> the United States, a settlement was reached with the United States agreeing to pay 22% of the liability for the crash, while Comair agreed to pay the remaining 78%.|$|E
5|$|In November 1167 Foliot {{was summoned}} to Normandy, then ruled by Henry II, to meet with papal legates and the king. Roger of York, Hilary of Chichester, and Roger of Worcester were also summoned to attend. After some {{discussion}} and argument, Henry appears to have agreed that the legates could judge both the king's <b>case</b> <b>against</b> Becket {{as well as the}} bishops' case. Henry also offered a compromise {{on the subject of the}} Constitutions of Clarendon, that the legates accepted. However, when the legates met with Becket on 18November, it quickly became apparent that Becket would not accept negotiations with the king nor accept the legates as judges of either <b>case</b> <b>against</b> him. As the legates had no mandate to compel Becket to accept them as judges, the negotiations came to an end with the king and bishops still appealing to the papacy.|$|E

As leader of the party, Goebel essentially hand-picked the members of the Election Commission. He chose three staunch Democrats – W. S.

An autopsy showed that Jernigan suffered from coronary atherosclerosis, and heart disease was officially listed as the cause of death. Lexington police determined that there was no evidence to suggest foul play. Jernigan's ex-wife continued to pursue Jernigan's <b>case</b> <b>against</b> Wilkinson, but a Fayette County Circuit Court Judge awarded Wilkinson a summary judgment to dismiss the case in 1986.|$|E
