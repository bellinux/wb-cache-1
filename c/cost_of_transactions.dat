50|$|In {{the chapter}} The Perfect Storm, the authors give an {{overview}} of the economic effects of the kind of transactions Web 2.0 permits. According to the authors, Coase's Law (see Ronald Coase) governs the expansion of a business:A firm will tend to expand until the cost of organizing an extra transaction within the firm become equal to the costs of carrying out the same transaction on the open market.However, because of the changing usage patterns of Internet technologies, the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>transactions</b> has dropped so significantly that the authors assert that the market is better described by an inversion of Coase's Law. That is:A firm will tend to expand until the cost of carrying out an extra transaction on the open market become equal to the costs of organizing the same transaction within the firm. Thus, the authors think that with the costs of communicating dramatically dropping, firms who do not change their current structures will perish. Companies who utilize mass collaboration will dominate their respective markets.|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} {{we carry out the}} first formal {{estimation}} of the social <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>transactions</b> in Costa Rica. The estimation considers transactions in cash and cards, covers the 2008 - 2011 years and is based on the methodology applied by Bergman, Guibourg and Segendorf (2007) for Sweden, with adaptations specific for Costa Rica. We estimate that the social <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>transactions</b> has remained relatively stable as a share of GDP during the years included. We assess that the importance of costs stemming from cash use is high: depending of the assumptions used, our estimations suggest that they are at least as important as those stemming from card transactions. We found that the decisions made by the consumers generate a sizable part of the social costs of using cash. Social costs per transaction are comparable to those calculated in the relevant literature, and they indicate that cash is generally less costly than cards. If the composition of private and social costs is analyzed, {{it can be seen that}} the components of the cost on which the BCCR could have more influence are associated with the withdrawal, holding and use of cash in transactions, all of which affect the private costs of consumers, banks and retailers. An institutional strategy to provide alternative electronic payment systems and to promote its use among consumers and retailers would result in a lower need to withdraw cash, in lower cash stocks to manage by banks and other companies, and in a lower opportunity cost for the cash held. ...|$|E

Instead, it covers all aspect of the business expenses such as managerial, marketing, production and so on. Thus, although E-Commerce may reduce the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>transactions,</b> it may not necessary reduce other expenses incurred in the business, such as cost of production (Garicano & Kaplan, 2001).|$|E
