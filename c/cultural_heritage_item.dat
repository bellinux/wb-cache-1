40|$|Software {{tools for}} photogrametric and multi-view stereo {{reconstruction}} are nowadays of generalized {{use in the}} digitization of architectural cultural heritage. Together with laser scanners, these are well established methods to digitize the three-dimensional geometric properties of real objects. However, the acquired photographic colour mapping of the resulting point clouds or the textured mesh cannot differentiate the proper surface appearance from {{the influence of the}} particular illumination present at the moment of the digitization. Acquisition of the actual surface appearance, separated from the existing illumination, is still a challenge for any kind of <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage</b> <b>item,</b> but very specially for architectural elements. Methods based on systematic sampling with commuting light patterns in a laboratory set-up are not suitable. Immovable and outdoor items are normally limited to the existing and uncontrolled natural illumination. This paper demonstrates a practical methodology for appearance acquisition, previously introduced in (Martos and Ruiz, 2013), applied here specifically for the production of re-illuminable architectural orthoimages. It is suitable for outdoor environments, where the illumination is variable and uncontrolled. In fact, naturally occurring changes in light among different images along the day are actually desired and exploited, producing an enhanced multi-layer dynamic texture that is not limited to a frozen RGB colour map. These layers contain valuable complementary information about the depth of the geometry, surface normal fine details and other illuminationdependent parameters, such as direct and indirect light and projected self-shadows, allowing an enhanced and re-illuminable ortoimage representation...|$|E

With the aim to define potentialities and problems deriving from integration or fusion of metric data acquired with different survey techniques, the elected test case is an outstanding <b>Cultural</b> <b>Heritage</b> <b>item,</b> presenting both widespread and specific complexities connected to the conservation of historical buildings. The site is the Staffarda Abbey, the most relevant evidence of medieval architecture in Piedmont. This application faced {{one of the most}} topical architectural issues consisting in the opportunity to study and analyze an object as a whole, from twice location of acquisition sensors, both the terrestrial and the aerial one. In particular, the work consists in the evaluation of chances deriving from a simple union or from the fusion of different 3 D cloud-models of the abbey, achieved by multi-sensor techniques. The aerial survey is based on a photogrammetric RPAS (Remotely piloted aircraft system) flight while the terrestrial acquisition have been fulfilled by laser scanning survey. Both techniques allowed to extract and process different point clouds and to generate consequent 3 D continuous models which are characterized by different scale, that is to say different resolutions and diverse contents of details and precisions. Starting from these models, the proposed process, applied to a sample area of the building, aimed to test the generation of a unique 3 Dmodel thorough a fusion of different sensor point clouds.

40|$|Background: Nowadays ancient {{cultural}} {{historic sites}} are {{considered as a}} local cultural asset. The cultural historic fabric of Bushehr port {{is one of the}} most unique historical urban sites which is confronting destruction because of speedy urban development. Therefore, the viewpoints of the historic fabric inhabitants were investigated to map its pathological pattern through a multidisciplinary approach. Methods: In a descriptive cross-sectional study, the viewpoints of the inhabitants in the historic cultural fabric of Bushehr port was assessed, through a questionnaire, using random cluster multistage sampling method. The questionnaire was based on four dimensions including: social, sanitary, urban and cultural heritage. Results: A total of 218 residential units of the historic cultural fabric of Bushehr port were surveyed. A portion of one fifth of the inhabitants were familiar with <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage</b> <b>item,</b> yet more than 60 % of them agreed upon a renovation of the historic fabric of Bushehr. Meanwhile, more than 80 % of the residents received no facility to renew their houses. Drug abuses were mentioned as the most important factor regarding insecurity (52. 8 %). The most important prospect of people from the municipality of the historic fabric of Bushehr port was renewal and renovation of the residential units (36. 7 %) and 24. 9 % asked for renovation of pathways and alleys. Providing a sewage collecting network and regular daily gathering of garbage were reported as the most important sanitary need by the inhabitants. Conclusion: The inhabitants of historic cultural fabric of Bushehr port are interested in preserving their residential units as a cultural heritage, but sanitary and urban problems such as sewage and garbage collection system and the lack of patronage from the side of responsible organizations for renovating this Iranian historic fabric architecture are the deep problematic points...|$|E
40|$|Executive summary Geographic {{location}} {{is one of}} the most important attributes of every <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage</b> <b>item.</b> It can describe provenience, the current institution, the location of the event or other related events. The most valuable geographic description is in the form of digital geographic coordinates. Geographic coordinates presented as x, y and possibly z-values define a position in a coordinate system. The added value of the geocoded cultural content is in the browsing of cultural portals efficiently through space and time, searching for content in a more user friendly way, without the necessity of typing geographical names, making it possible to discover overlapping cultural content at the same location but originating from different sources and at different times, mapping the cultural content, performing GIS calculations and simulations, overlapping architectural/archaeological heritage with museum objects and intangible heritage, defining the protected areas of monuments, geovisualisation and historical simulations. This deliverable D 4. 7 “Map enhancement to project website using Europeana API” describes the web application CARARE-mapping [URL] The objective of the CARARE-mapping web application is to demonstrate the functionalities and advantages for displaying and browsing digital cultural content if a user interface is a map. The CARARE-mapping web application proves the mapping as an added value for re-use of Europeana cultural content. The CARARE-mapping web application is in a prototype phase and consists of four main components: 	mapping, 	route planning, 	mobile, 	search.

Significance 2. 0 outlines the theory, practice and many applications {{of the concept of}} significance in collection management. It takes readers through the key concepts and steps in assessing significance, for single items, collections and cross-collection projects. With examples and case studies it shows significance in action, {{in a wide range of}} applications. This is a new and revised edition of Significance; a guide to assessing the significance of cultural heritage collections, published in 2001 by the Commonwealth of Australia on behalf of the Heritage Collections Council. This second edition extends the scope of significance to demonstrate its use with a wide variety of collections across the four major collecting domains—archives, galleries, libraries and museums. Since the publication of the first edition, many collecting organisations across Australia have embraced the concept of significance, using it in many facets of their work—in collection policies, for acquisitions and deaccessioning, in conservation, planning, promotion, advocacy, education, online access, and in innovative collaborative projects. Significance is now widely used by collecting organisations in Australia and it has a growing number of supporters overseas. Who is Significance 2. 0 for? Significance 2. 0 is for anyone who is curious about collections and their meanings. Significance 2. 0 is for all collecting organisations, agencies and owners that manage or hold collections. This includes everyone working with or associated with collections in any capacity—archivists, conservators, curators, educators, heritage managers, librarians, policy officers, interpreters, private owners and collectors, registrars, researchers, scientists, and students, whether as paid workers or volunteers. How can Significance 2. 0 help? Significance 2. 0 is designed to work for all types of collections, giving collection managers throughout Australia a shared framework and standard process to analyse and communicate the meanings and values of collections. Collecting organisations will have different uses for significance, depending on their circumstances and collections. While some collecting organisations are using significance in all aspects of their collection work, others find it useful for occasional or specific applications, such as supporting acquisition proposals to boards, or before conservation work. Some collecting organisations mainly use the single item assessment process, while others will find the whole collection process more useful. This guide provides ideas, examples and suggestions that can be adapted to suit the needs of all kinds of collections. Using Significance 2. 0 This guide explains the concept of significance, the assessment process, how to draft a statement of significance, and gives examples of many different applications of significance. It is designed to work with a suite of online resources including a workbook and e-learning module for developing practical skills in assessing significance, and other supporting online resources. Examples and case studies in Significance 2. 0 are tightly edited and may not fully convey the significance of the item or associated research. Further, more detailed case studies will be added online in the future. The first edition of Significance contains other case studies, and remains available online...|$|E
40|$|Pri svojem terenskem delu sem se velikokrat srečala s sušilnicami za sadje, ki so bile v času od 19. do ½ 20. stoletja, skoraj obvezen gospodarski objekt, na gorskih samooskrbnih kmetijah. Med leti 1950 in 1960 so sušilnice izgubile svojo primarno funkcijo, saj so v njih sušenje sadja opustili. Kljub temu pa so se sušilnice vse do danes ohranile v večjem številu. Evidententirala sem jih nad sedemdeset, vse so opuščene, le ena je še delujoča. V prehrani je imelo sadje na slovenskem zelo pomembno vlogo. Razvijalo se je skozi stoletja in desetletja, čeprav vedno v povezavi s poljedeljstvom in živinorejo. Zato je izročilo in dediščina o sadjarstvu pri nas pestra in bogata bodisi, da je povezana s sadjarskim poklicem ali dejavnostjo. Na sadjarsko dejavnost se navezujejo tudi objekti, ki jih uvrščamo med najmanjša gospodarska poslopja. To so sušilnice za sadje ali pajštve, ki pa sodijo med našo najbolj ogroženo stavbno dediščino, saj jih večina ni več v prvotni funkciji. V raziskavi sem se najprej usmerila v pregled virov in literature, ki predvsem obravnava sadne sušilnice in sušenje sadja. Pomembnejši avtorji so: P. Santonino, J. V. Valvasor, M. Pohlin, S. Rutar, A. Muznik ter Francijscejski kataster. Geografsko obravnavam Posočje. To je svet na zahodu Slovenije, kjer so razmere za gojenje sadnega drevja dokaj ugodne. Sušenje sadja, hrušk, sliv ter jabolk, v sadnih sušilnicah ali krušni peči, pa pretežno v uporabi do ½ 20. stoletja. Posebnost sušenja sliv in fig so Goriška Brda, kjer so sušili in žveplali sadje v t. i. kasonih ali na soncu (zraku). Sušenje na soncu je bilo značilno tudi za Vipavsko dolino. Sadne sušilnice sem evidentirala in inventarizirala med leti 1999 in 2002. Glede na zastavljene kriterije in obdelavo podatkov, pa jih razvrstila v tabele. Osrednji del raziskave pa je posvečen opisu ter tipologiji sušilnic /dimne, brezdimne, elektirične/, pripravam za shranjevanje suhega sadja in uporabi letega. From the {{historical}} {{point of view}} fruit has always had {{an important role in}} nutrition. Up to the mid 20 th century fruit-growing was a complementary activity to cultivation of crops and to stock-farming. The tradition and the heritage of fruit-growing are varied and rich, either those relative to the profession of the fruit-grower and to the activities of fruit-growing or to those relative to the buildings – drying-houses, which are the smallest farm-buildings in Slovenia. From 19 th century to the mid 20 th century the drying-house or "pajštva" was an indispensable part of mountain self-sufficient farms. Drying-houses lost their basic function between 1950 and 1960 when farmers stopped using them for drying fruit. In the introduction of my paper I present the sources and the literature that treat the subject of fruit-growing and drying-houses. Among the most important authors emerge P. Santonino, J. V. Valvazor, M. Pohlin, S. Rutar, A. Muznik and the 19 th century Austro-Hungarian cadastre. For the topography resp. for the recording of drying-houses I chose the region of Posočje. The land of Posočje is rather suitable for fruit-growing and the drying of fruit – – pears, prunes and apples – in drying-houses or ovens for baking bread was extensively practised till the mid 20 th century. A peculiar method of fruit-drying was in use in the area of Goriška Brda. There, fruit was dried and smoked with brimstone in "keson" or air-dried. Air-drying was in use also in the Vipava valley, for ex. apricots in the village of Budanje. I carried out the registration and the inventory of drying-houses between 1999 and 2002. After processing the data I classified the drying-houses and entered them in a table according to the set criteria. In order to make the survey more complete I entered the ruined and the partly ruined drying-houses as well. The table contains the following data: - EŠD (code number of the <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage</b> <b>item</b> if considered cultural heritage or a monument) - name of the drying-house - degree of preservation - typology - TTN (topographic plan) The paper is divided in several chapters. Besides the typology (drying with smoke, without smoke, electrically heated) I also described some old sorts of fruit trees, tools for gathering, picking, drying and storing of fruit and added some recipes for dishes with dried fruit. In the conclusion I describe the only drying-house still in use, namely the one belonging to the farm called "Pri Francu" in Kneške Ravne. The farm lies in an amphitheatre formed by the mountains Žabiški Kum, Vogel and Rodica and the slopes of Masovnik. The farm is situated higher than any other and its owners are proud and faithful to the traditional way of life. Their farm is a symbol of the past, perseverance, tradition and knowledge. The farm-buildings such as the "Kozolec toplar" (double roofed ridge top hay rack), the saw "venecijanka" (vertical frame one band blade saw), the wooden and the stone/brick barns, the basement with a smithy, the joiner 2 ̆ 7 s workshop and the drying-house are venerable buildings and conceal extraordinary technical achievements. The farm is surrounded by meadows, pasture-grounds and woods. At the border of the farm-grounds grow, scattered, old sorts of fruit trees of venerable age for the fruit-growing has been a tradition of the farm for centuries...|$|E

40|$|The authors {{summarize}} {{the results of}} long-term studies of the monuments of civil architecture on {{the territory of the}} Russian Federation. Legislative and engineering aspects of the process of monitoring of the aforesaid monuments are described in the article. Geodetic monitoring is the most efficient method of systematic observations. Unlike traditional geometric leveling that solely contemplates the identification of sediment values for displacement points, geodetic monitoring employs the method of trigonometric leveling. This method makes it possible to conduct systematic observations of both the vertical strain in the points of observation and their horizontal displacement. Thus, trigonometric leveling makes it possible to identify the sediment differences and to determine deviations from design surfaces and their time dependence, which is very important in case of <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage</b> <b>items.</b> The authors describe various methods of geodetic monitoring of civil architecture monuments: linear-and-angular measurements, method of side leveling, use of vertical projection devices, etc. It also provides information concerning methods of measurements of crack opening values. The authors provide references to regulatory documents and sources covering the problems of monitoring (systematic observations over a long time period) of industrial and civil projects; they cover the monitoring of architectural monuments, particularly, in hazardous situations.

40|$|Nowadays, 3 D {{digital imaging}} proposes {{effective}} solutions for preserving {{the expression of}} human creativity across the centuries, as well as is a great tool to guarantee global dissemination of knowledge and wide access to these invaluable resources of the past. Nevertheless, in several cases, a massive digitalisation of <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage</b> <b>items</b> (from the archaeological site up to the monument and museum collections) could be unworkable due to the still high costs in terms of equipment and human resources: 3 D acquisition technologies and the need of skilled team within cultural institutions. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} explore new possibilities offered by growing technologies: the lower costs of these technologies as well as their attractive visual quality constitute a challenge for researchers. Besides these possibilities, {{it is also important to}} consider how information is spread through graphic representation of knowledge. The focus of this study is to explore the potentialities and weaknesses of a newly released low cost device in the <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage</b> domain, trying to understand its effective usability in museum collections. The aim of the research is to test their usability, critically analysing the final outcomes of this entry level technology in relation to the other better assessed low cost technologies for 3 D scanning, such as Structure from Motion (SfM) techniques (also produced by the same device) combined with dataset generated by a professional digital camera. The final outcomes were compared in terms of quality definition, time processing and file size. The specimens of the collections of the Civic Museum Castello Ursino in Catania have been chosen as the site of experimentation...|$|R
40|$|Heritage {{buildings}} are highly prone to long term {{damage from the}} microclimate, scourge and vandalism, which can result in damaged materials, structures, painting and <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage</b> <b>items.</b> This study will focus on finding the displacement of wood structural members {{through the use of}} a 3 D laser scanner and the 4 D concept of time. The results will compare the scans from different periods to find the difference (if any) in the structural member position. Wood structures usually consist of numerous wood members connected to form the structure. However, these members can be damaged in various ways such as physical mechanisms, chemical reactions, and biological corrosion. When damage to the wood structure occurs, the structural displacement can be affected, and if affected severely, can lead to a building collapse. Monitoring of the structural displacement is the best way to discover damage immediately and to preserve the heritage building. However, the <b>Cultural</b> <b>Heritage</b> Preservation Law in Taiwan prohibits the installation of monitoring instruments (e. g strain gauge, accelerometer) in historic structures (heritage buildings). Scanning the wood structure with 3 D lasers is the most non-intrusive method and quickly achieves displacement through visualization. The displacement scan results can be compared with different periods and different members to analyze the severity of damage. Once the 3 D scanner is installed, the whole building is scanned, and point clouds created to build the visual building model. The structural displacement can be checked via the building model and the differences are measured between each member to find the high risk damaged areas or members with large displacement. Early detection of structural damage is the most effective way means of preservation...|$|R
