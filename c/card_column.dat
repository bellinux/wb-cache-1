5000|$|By convention, buffers are {{preceded by}} a word count. The [...] assembles a count word and the {{following}} [...] reserves the required number of words for the buffer. The card buffer requires 80 words, one for each <b>card</b> <b>column.</b> Driver CARD0 reads each <b>card</b> <b>column</b> literally, using 12 of the 16 bits in the buffer word to describe {{whether there is a}} punch in the corresponding row for that column. The pattern of punches typically describes a text character using the Hollerith code. The console keyboard also gives input to the program in the Hollerith code, the only case of two devices using the same character encoding.|$|E
5000|$|Punch magnets Machines {{that could}} punch cards, {{such as a}} {{reproducing}} punch, had hub entries for each <b>card</b> <b>column.</b> An impulse {{to one of those}} entries triggered the electromagnet that initiated the punching of a hole at that column position.|$|E

5000|$|The {{punched card}} was fed from the card hopper and read {{by means of}} an {{electrical}} voltage placed onto a metal ‘Contact Roll’, timing controlled by a ‘Master Circuit Breaker, and 80 ‘Read Brushes’, one brush for each <b>card</b> <b>column,</b> and ‘Wire Contact Relays’ which decoded the data.|$|E
50|$|Control panels had a {{rectangular}} array of holes called hubs which were organized into groups. Wires with metal ferrules {{at each end}} {{were placed in the}} hubs to make connections. The output from some <b>card</b> <b>column</b> positions might connected to a tabulating machine's counter, for example. A shop would typically have separate control panels for each task a machine was used for.|$|E

A 130 <b>column</b> <b>card</b> was also {{available}} - formed {{by dividing the}} card into two rows, each row with 65 columns and each character space with 5 punch positions.

50|$|The {{operation}} of the 407 was directed {{by the use of}} a removable control panel and a carriage tape. Exit hubs (impulse emitting) on the control panel are wired to entry hubs (impulse accepting) for the task to be done (see Wiring of unit record equipment). There are hubs for each <b>card</b> <b>column</b> (at both reading stations), print position, counter digit, and so on. Logic tests were also available.|$|E
5000|$|A signed {{overpunch}} is a code used {{to store}} {{the sign of a}} number by changing the last digit. It is used in COBOL, especially when using EBCDIC. Its purpose is to save a character that would otherwise be used by the sign digit. [...] The code is derived from the Hollerith Punched Card Code, where both a digit and a sign can be entered in the same <b>card</b> <b>column.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{standard}} {{punched card}} code for the groupmark character on the IBM 1401 computer system used punches in rows 12, 7, and 8 of a <b>card</b> <b>column</b> (written as 12-7-8). The older IBM 705 computer used 12-5-8 for this character. An RPQ {{was available for}} the 1401 for compatibility that allowed the system to read or punch the 705 code rather than the standard code. Since not all 1401 users would need this feature it was marketed as an RPQ.|$|E

50|$|The {{basic unit}} of data storage was the punched card. The IBM 80-column card was {{introduced}} in 1928. The Remington Rand <b>Card</b> with 45 <b>columns</b> in each of two tiers, thus 90 columns, in 1930. The method used to store data on punched cards is vendor specific. In general each column represents a single digit, letter or special character. Sequential <b>card</b> <b>columns</b> allocated for a specific use, such as names, addresses, multi-digit numbers, etc., are known as a field. An employee number might occupy 5 columns; hourly pay rate, 3 columns; hours worked in a given week, 2 columns; department number 3 columns; project charge code 6 columns and so on.|$|R
5000|$|Cards with error notches were re-punched (using an 024 or 026) {{usually by}} [...] "duplicating" [...] {{up to the}} column in error, then {{entering}} the correct data. The duplicating function was accomplished by feeding the card through the punch station without punching it. At the next station sensing pins read the holes present in the original card and transferred the data to the punching station and onto a blank <b>card.</b> <b>Columns</b> with errors were corrected instead of being duplicated. The corrected card was then verified to check the data again and be [...] "OK notched".|$|R

5000|$|IBM {{removable}} {{control panels}} ranged {{in size from}} 6 1/4" [...] by 10 3/4" [...] (for machines such as the IBM 077, IBM 550, IBM 514) to roughly one to two feet (300 to 600 mm) on a side and had a rectangular array of hubs. Plugs {{at each end of}} a single-conductor patch cord were inserted into hubs, making a connection between two contacts on the machine when the control panel was placed in the machine, thereby connecting an emitting hub to an accepting or entry hub. For example, in a card duplicator application a <b>card</b> <b>column</b> reading (emitting) hub might be connected to a punch magnet entry hub. It was a relatively simple matter to copy some fields, perhaps to different columns, and ignore other columns by suitable wiring. Tabulator control panels could require dozens of patch cords for some applications.|$|E
