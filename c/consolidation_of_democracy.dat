He sees that as the consequence of Yeltsin's era family-ruled state being unable to pursue [...] "a favorable environment for mid-sized and small businesses". Migranyan sees modern Russia as democracy, at least formally. While [...] "the state, having restored its effectiveness and control over its own resources, has become the largest corporation responsible for establishing {{the rules of the}} game", Migranyan wonders how much might this influence extend in future. In 2004 he saw two possibilities for the Putin regime: either transformation into a consolidated democracy, either bureaucratic authoritarianism. However, [...] "if Russia is lagging behind the developed capitalist nations in regard to the <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> <b>democracy,</b> it is not the quality of democracy, but rather its amount and the balance between civil society and the state." ...|$|E

40|$|This essay aims {{to explain}} why Colombia has not {{consolidated}} into a liberal democracy between the years 1991 to 2015. To examine {{the purpose of this}} essay five interactive arenas are analyzed in order to describe to which extent Colombia is affected by the various arenas. Three questions are being discussed and answered; to which extent have the political society and civil society affected the <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> a liberal <b>democracy,</b> to which extent have rule of law and the state bureaucracy affected the <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> a liberal <b>democracy</b> and, to which extent have the economic society affected the <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> a liberal <b>democracy.</b> The theoretical framework is based upon theories regarding different types <b>of</b> <b>democracy</b> and democratic <b>consolidation.</b> The essay is a theory consuming case study, with descriptive questions and explanatory approach. The framework is used to qualitatively illuminate empirical material to the study research questions. The conclusions of this essay shows that Colombia has not consolidated into a liberal <b>democracy</b> because <b>of</b> large illegal activities, physical attacks from non-state groups, widespread distrust of the political system and absence of conflict resolution through a democratic process...|$|R

30|$|As {{explained}} earlier, {{in increasing}} returns production structures both wages and profits are sustained for longer periods. This {{is a recipe}} for the creation or maintenance of a strong middle class, an important ingredient to the creation and maintenance <b>of</b> <b>democracies</b> (Acemoglu and Robinson 2006). Note that structural transformation to an increasing returns economic structure does not inevitably lead to democratic transitions or consolidation; it simply makes the enforcement of “inclusive” institutions feasible. It is important to underline the difference between our theory of political transitions and the modernization hypothesis (Lipset 1959), which claims that growth in per capita income causes the creation and <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> <b>democracies.</b> There are many non-democratic countries with high per capita incomes but with diminishing returns economic structures—Equatorial Guinea is a case in point. Per capita income is not economic structure. Further, after controlling for country fixed effects, the relationship between per capita income and democracy breaks down (Acemoglu et al. 2008).|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{question}} of how people in rural areas have perceived the change of political system from one-party to multi-party during the 1990 s in Tanzania. Tanzania has to this date performed three general elections but still the ruling party CCM has a strong grip over politics in the country. With landslide victories in the Presidential elections 1995, 2000 and 2005 the party has reinforced its position in the Parliament. With over eighty percent of the seats in the Parliament, the elections illustrate the failure by the opposition to attract voters and to create an alternative political platform to CCM. This thesis explores the challenges <b>of</b> consolidating multiparty <b>democracy</b> in Tanzania leading to the overall question of this thesis: What are the possibilities and constraints for <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> multiparty <b>democracy</b> in Tanzania? Using an anthropological and inductive method, this question is approached by exploring how villagers in two separate villages in rural Tanzania understand and respond to the question <b>of</b> multiparty <b>democracy.</b> As a complement and a parallel set of information, literature and newspapers covering the political development in Tanzania has been used to be compared and analysed for enhanced understanding of the transition process and the <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> multiparty <b>democracy</b> in Tanzania and what factors might be important in a <b>consolidation.</b> The focus <b>of</b> the thesis is on the local/village level, primary on the marginalised pastoralist group of Maasai. As the Maasai has a customary leadership structure that is still strongly manifested in their society and culture, the <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> multiparty <b>democracy</b> has therefore direct impact on their society and the system of electing political leaders. The thesis is divided into three parts. Part I, the arena, is an ethnographic and empirical presentation of the local setting. Part II, towards <b>democracy,</b> is <b>of</b> theoretical character and part III, democracy in local practice, has close relation to the empirical material, leading forward to three main hampering factors working against or making the <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> multiparty <b>democracy</b> not as straightforward as intended. I have categorised these factors into three themes: stability, cultural and educational and logistical and practical. One of the main arguments made is that the ruling party and its leaders on both national and local levels are frequently using the concepts peace, unity and harmony as prime values and existing conditions in the country created by the ruling party CCM and its founding father, Julius Nyerere. The usage of these concepts becomes at the local level arguments against multiparty system. Thus, the multiparty system has been met by people with caution; a political form that must be entered into carefully while keeping a watchful eye on the (still) unknown opposition parties and their qualifications...|$|R
