40|$|Introduction Respiratory infections play a {{deleterious}} role in {{the progression}} of patients suffering from cystic fibrosis. <b>Cross</b> <b>infections</b> and epidemics have been documented in these patients, justifying a rigorous prevention regime. Background This prevention regime concerns all health workers and rests on various recommendations. Segregation of patients and hand hygiene are important factors. Respiratory equipment and, more specifically, nebulisers represent a potential source of bacterial contamination requiring special attention. In the same perspective the risks related {{to the health care}} environment, particularly the lung function laboratory, should not be ignored. The modalities of prevention sometimes have a significant psychological impact that may often be reduced by careful explanation.

MethodsPulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was used to type isolates of A. xylosoxidans. ResultsFour patients infected for 2 – 7 years {{were part of a}} larger epidemic spread involving both Danish CF centres, while 11 patients carried strains with unique genotypes. Longitudinal analysis of isolates from ten patients with multiple preserved isolates showed that each patient persistently carried isolates of a single genotype. Following lung transplantation, two patients showed re-colonisation of the lung grafts with the pre-transplant A. xylosoxidans strain. ConclusionsA. xylosoxidans has been transmitted between patients from our clinic, but the recent increase in incidence is not caused by <b>cross</b> <b>infections...</b>|$|R

In the intermediate host, T. c. cucumerinum develops more slowly than T. c. sisowi.

Furthermore, one farmer reported a large reduction in yield with final harvest only equaling the stocking weight. Upon trapping, one-third of the crayfish regularly died overnight and a further one-third died on the sorting tray during sexing of juveniles (~ 3 mo old). Histopathological examination revealed very light (1 or 2 cells per section) infections with Cherax giardiavirus and sometimes mild atrophy of hepatopancreatic cells. Gene probe analysis with a DIG-labeled spawner-isolated mortality virus (SMV) probe demonstrated extensive positive signals in nuclei of many tissues. The hepatopancreas, the midgut, glands associated with the midgut, the epithelium of seminal ducts and follicle cells surrounding oocytes gave the strongest positive signals.
