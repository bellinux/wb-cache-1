5000|$|A common laboratory-scale {{mechanical}} method for <b>cell</b> <b>disruption</b> uses tiny glass, ceramic or steel beads {{mixed with a}} sample suspended in aqueous media. First developed by Tim Hopkins in the late 1970s, the sample and bead mix is subjected to high level agitation by stirring or shaking. Beads collide with the cellular sample, cracking open the cell to release intercellular components. Unlike some other methods, mechanical shear is moderate during homogenization resulting in excellent membrane or subcellular preparations. The method, often called [...] "beadbeating", works well {{for all types of}} cellular material - from spores to animal and plant tissues. It is the most widely used method of yeast lysis, and can yield breakage of over 50%.

Site-directed mutagenesis defined a LAY motif, positioned on 71 - 73 amino acids of the UBIAD 1 N-terminus, as the ER retention signal of UBIAD 1.

40|$|In {{mammalian}} cells, {{the signal}} recognition particle (SRP) receptor {{is required for}} the targeting of nascent secretory proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. We have identified the Saccharomyces cerevisiae homologue of the alpha-subunit of the SRP receptor (SR alpha) and characterized its function in vivo. S. cerevisiae SR alpha is a 69 -kDa peripheral membrane protein that is 32 % identical (54 % chemically similar) to its mammalian homologue and, like mammalian SR alpha, is predicted to contain a GTP binding domain. Yeast cells that contain the SR alpha gene (SRP 101) under control of the GAL 1 promoter show impaired translocation of soluble and membrane proteins across the ER membrane after depletion of SR alpha. The degree of the translocation defect varies for different proteins. The defects are similar to those observed in SRP deficient <b>cells.</b> <b>Disruption</b> of the SRP 101 gene results in an approximately sixfold reduction in the growth rate of the <b>cells.</b> <b>Disruption</b> of the gene encoding SRP RNA (SCR 1) or both SCR 1 and SRP 101 resulted in an indistinguishable growth phenotype, indicating that SRP receptor and SRP function in the same pathway. Taken together, these results suggest that the components and the mechanism of the SRP-dependent protein targeting pathway are evolutionarily conserved yet not essential for cell growth. Surprisingly, cells that are grown for a prolonged time in the absence of SRP or SRP receptor no longer show pronounced protein translocation defects. This adaptation is a physiological process and is not due to the accumulation of a suppressor mutation. The degree of this adaptation is strain dependent...|$|R
