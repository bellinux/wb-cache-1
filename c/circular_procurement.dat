Several best practice examples in Denmark, Finland, Sweden and Norway illustrate how and in which sectors and product groups <b>circular</b> <b>procurement</b> could be applicable. Different approaches to <b>circular</b> <b>procurement</b> and tendering criteria supporting circular aspects are also illustrated.
