IR and DN may also share common genetic determinants [3 – 6]. The gene encoding PTP 1 B, a tyrosine phosphatase which inhibits insulin signalling, is an excellent <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> <b>IR</b> and related disorders. We recently have identified a 1484 insG variation in the 3 ′-untranslated region (UTR) of the gene which stabilizes PTP 1 B mRNA and associates with IR in the general population [7]. Our aim was to verify whether the PTP 1 B 1484 insG variant [as evaluated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and SacII enzyme digestion] plays a role in the development of DN in patients with T 1 D.

40|$|This chapter {{demonstrates}} {{a new approach}} to manipulate and classify the graphene flake by choosing an optimal frequency of the applied electric field. In recent years, graphene {{has been the subject of}} increasing attention because it has a great potential for use in nano optoelectronics. Graphene is another novel nanomaterial and researchers have found a strong photoresponse near the graphene-metal interfaces. In addition graphene-based photodetectors can potentially be used for high-speed optical communications. The most common fabrication technique used for graphene-based nanostructures can be divided into two steps-first, electron beam lithography (EBL) is employed to pattern metal electrodes on a graphene. Then the resulting structures are etched by an oxygen plasma. However, plasma etching induces localization of charge carriers in graphene and changes its electronic properties. The disadvantages of EBL include its high cost and its low throughput. EBL machines are expensive and they also require substantial maintenance. Moreover, the patterning process takes a long time to complete because the electron beam is required to scan samples pixel by pixel. Discussion correlated the conductivity of the graphene flake with the frequency of the applied electric field. The theoretical prediction agrees well with the experimental results. With the ability to select high-conductivity graphene, the experimental result shows that graphene is a promising <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> <b>IR</b> detection. The present study provides a systematic and reproducible method of selecting and separating high-conductivity graphene, which can also be used to manufacture novel IR nano sensors. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that for {{spatially}} flat FRW cosmologies, the holographic dark energy disfavours the Hubble parameter as a <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> the <b>IR</b> cutoff. <b>For</b> overcoming this problem, we explore the use of this cutoff in holographic ellipsoidal cosmological models, and derive the general ellipsoidal metric induced by a such holographic energy density. Despite the drawbacks that this cutoff presents in homogeneous and isotropic universes, based on this general metric, we developed a suitable ellipsoidal holographic cosmological model, filled with a dark matter and a dark energy components. At late time stages, the cosmic evolution is dominated by a holographic anisotropic dark energy with barotropic equations of state. The cosmologies expand in all directions in accelerated manner. Since the ellipsoidal cosmologies given here are not asymptotically FRW, the deviation from homogeneity and isotropy of the universe on large cosmological scales remains constant during all cosmic evolution. This feature allows studied holographic ellipsoidal cosmologies to be ruled by an equation of state ω=p/ρ, whose range belongs to quintessence or even phantom matter.

40|$|In {{the last}} several years Dr. Stringfellow's group at the University of Utah has {{reported}} success in incorporating over 3 percent Bi in InAs and 1. 5 percent in InAsSb using Organometallic Vapor Phase Epitaxy (OMVPE) growth techniques. For InAs the lattice constant increase is linear with a= 6. 058 + 0. 966 x (InAs(1 -x) Bi(x)), and a decrease in band gap energy of dEg / dx = - 55 meV / at a percentage Bi. Extrapolating this to the ternary minimum band gap at InAs(0. 35) Sb(0. 65), an addition of 1 to 2 percent Bi should drop the band gap to the 0. 1 to 0. 05 eV range (10 to 20 microns). These alloys are direct band gap semiconductors making them <b>candidates</b> <b>for</b> far <b>IR</b> detectors. The current status of the InAsSbBi alloys is that good crystal morphology and x ray diffraction data has been obtained for up to 3. 4 percent Bi.

40|$|We {{consider}} a holographic dark energy model, {{in which both}} the CC energy density rho_Lambda and the Newton constant G_N are varying quantities, to study the problem of setting an effective field-theory IR cutoff. Assuming that ordinary matter scales canonically, we show that the continuity equation univocally fixes the IR cutoff, provided a law of variation for either rho_Lambda or G_N is known. Previous considerations on holographic dark energy disfavor the Hubble parameter as a <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> the <b>IR</b> cutoff (<b>for</b> spatially flat universes), since {{in this case the}} ratio of dark energy to dark matter is not allowed to vary, thus hindering a deceleration era of the universe for the redshifts z>= 0. 5. On the other hand, the future event horizon as a choice <b>for</b> the <b>IR</b> cutoff is being favored in the literature, although the `coincidence problem' usually cannot be addressed in that case. We extend considerations to spatially curved universes, and show that with the Hubble parameter as a choice <b>for</b> the <b>IR</b> cutoff one always obtains a universe that never accelerates or a universe that accelerates all the time, thus making the transition from deceleration to acceleration impossible. Next, we apply the IR cutoff consistency procedure to a RG running CC model, in which the low-energy variation of the CC is due to quantum effects of particle fields having masses near the Planck scale. We show that bringing such a model in full accordance with holography amounts to having such an IR cutoff which scales as a square root of the Hubble parameter. We find that such a setup, in which the only undetermined input represents the true ground state of the vacuum, can give early deceleration as well as late time acceleration. The possibility of further improvement of the model is also briefly indicated. Comment: 13 pages, 1 figure, revised, to appear in Phys. Rev. ...|$|R
40|$|Translated or cross-lingual {{plagiarism}} {{is defined}} as the translation of someone else’s work or words without marking it as such or without giving credit to the original author. The existence of cross-lingual plagiarism is not new, but only in recent years, due to the rapid development of the natural language processing, appeared the first algorithms which tackled the difficult task of detecting it. Most of these algorithms utilize machine translation to compare texts written in different languages. We propose a different method, which can effectively detect translations between language-pairs where machine translations still produce low quality results. Our new algorithm presented in this paper is based on information retrieval (IR) and a dictionary based similarity metric. The preprocessing of the <b>candidate</b> documents <b>for</b> the <b>IR</b> is computationally intensive, but easily parallelizable. We propose a desktop Grid solution for this task.

40|$|International audienceDecreasing glass network {{defects and}} {{improving}} optical transmittance are essential work for material researchers. We studied {{the function of}} halogen iodine (I) acting as a glass network modifier in Ge–Sb–Se–based chalcogenide glass system. A systematic series of Ge 20 Sb 5 Se 75 -xIx (x = 0, 5, 10, 15, 20 at%) infrared (IR) chalcohalide glasses were investigated to decrease the weak absorption tail (WAT) and improve the mid-IR transparency. The mechanisms of the halogen I affecting the physical, thermal, and optical properties of Se-based chalcogenide glasses were reported. The structural evolutions of these glasses were also revealed by Raman spectroscopy and camera imaging. The progressive substitution of I for Se increased the optical bandgap. The WAT and scatting loss significantly decreased corresponding to the progressive decrease in structural defects caused by dangling bands and structure defects in the original Ge 20 Sb 5 Se 75 glass. The achieved maximum IR transparency of Ge–Sb–Se–I glasses can reach up to 80 % with an effective transmission window between 0. 94 μm to 17 μm, whereas the absorption coefficient decreased to 0. 029 cm- 1 at 10. 16 μm.
