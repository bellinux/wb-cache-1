5|$|A {{free agent}} in March 2001, Henderson {{returned}} to the Padres. During the 2001 season, he broke three major league <b>career</b> records and reached an additional major <b>career</b> milestone. He broke Babe Ruth's record of 2,062 <b>career</b> walks, Ty Cobb's record of 2,245 <b>career</b> runs, and Zack Wheat's record of 2,328 <b>career</b> games in left field, and {{on the final day}} of the season collected his 3,000th <b>career</b> hit, a leadoff double off Rockies pitcher John Thomson. That final game was also Padre Tony Gwynn's last major league game, and Henderson had originally wanted to sit out so as not to detract from the occasion, but Gwynn insisted that Henderson play. After scoring the game's first run, Henderson was removed from the lineup. With Gwynn having 3,141 hits, it was just the second time in Major League history that a pair of teammates each had 3,000 <b>career</b> hits; Ty Cobb and Tris Speaker had previously played many games together for the 1928 A's.|$|E
