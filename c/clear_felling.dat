25|$|A {{continuous}} area {{of approximately}} 400 hectares (988 acres) {{is covered with}} woodland or plantation. The forest is managed for timber by United Utilities, using a continuous cover policy (rather than <b>clear</b> <b>felling</b> and restocking). Macclesfield Borough Council plans to increase {{the area of the}} former royal forest that is covered by woodland. The predominant species are Sitka spruce and Japanese Larch, with some Scots Pine, Lodgepole Pine, Corsican pine and Norway Spruce. There are also areas of semi-natural mixed and broadleaved woodland, mainly oak, sycamore and beech; in 2004, broadleaved species made up 23% of the total, although current forestry management aims to increase the proportion. The woodland supports mosses and thirty species of fungi, including fly agaric, stinkhorns, honey fungus and the sickener. The area also includes areas of acidic unimproved upland grassland, including approximately a hectare within the Trentabank nature reserve; this supports species including bluebell, tormentil, pignut, birdsfoot trefoil, foxglove and lesser knapweed, while the reservoir margins support aquatic plants including amphibious bistort, water mint, Water Horsetail and common spikerush.|$|E

40|$|The {{tailed frog}} (Ascaphus truei) is {{designated}} a species 'at risk' or 'of special concern' in California, Oregon, Washington (USA), and British Columbia (Canada). Forest practices often have negative impacts on Ascaphus adults and larvae, including absence from some <b>clear</b> <b>felled</b> areas. Recolonization of logged sites may {{be critical to}} sustaining productive amphibian populations. Given the uncommonly long larval stage of Ascaphus, movements by larvae may be particularly important in the recolonization of managed forests. We investigated movement rates of Ascaphus larvae {{and the influence of}} stream parameters in four stream basins (Ashlu, Elaho, Squamish and Mamquam) transecting recently harvested and unmanaged forests in southwestern British Columbia (1995, 1996 and 1999). Larvae in streams flowing through unmanaged forests moved about 7. 4 times as far as those flowing through <b>clear</b> <b>felled</b> reaches. Streams with high levels of logjams showed low larval movement rates. Recently harvested sites may produce unfavourable conditions impeding recolonization by Ascaphus larvae. High gradient streams also showed low larval movement rates. The role of stream-dwelling larvae in dispersal of Ascaphus is unknown, but this disperal mechanism would be energy-efficient because it can be passive with the stream current.

40|$|Background: Lianas are {{considered}} to be particularly abundant in tropical forests after disturbance; however, information on their regeneration by seedlings, saplings, and sprouts is scarce. Aim: We assessed how primary and secondary forest types with different land use history are related to the density and diversity of liana regeneration. Methods: Liana regeneration (1. 7 m in length) was identified and counted in primary and secondary forest plots in Amazonia, near Manaus, Brazil. The primary forest was non-inundated evergreen tropical lowland forest. Secondary forest types were Vismia (on land formerly <b>clear</b> <b>felled,</b> used for pasture and intensively burned) and Cecropia (on land formerly <b>clear</b> <b>felled,</b> no pasture usage nor intensive fires), with distances between 0. 03 and 1. 2 km to the primary forest edge. Results: The density of woody regeneration (trees, lianas, palms and shrubs) was 50 % lower in the secondary forests than in the primary forest. The share of lianas of woody regeneration (10 - 13 %) hardly differed among forest types. Liana species richness per plot was highest in the primary forest and lowest in the Vismia forest. Accumulated species richness in the Cecropia forest was similar to that in the primary forest. With increasing distance from the primary forest, species richness and the proportion of lianas of woody regeneration decreased. Conclusion: Our results indicate that secondary forest type/land use history influenced liana regeneration diversity but not density. Distance to primary forest influenced both...|$|R
