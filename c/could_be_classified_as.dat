5|$|Throughout May 1972, {{a series}} of weak troughs moved across the eastern United States. In {{the third week of}} the month, an upper-level cutoff low {{developed}} along one of these troughs, located southeast of the United States and removed from the Westerlies. The origins of Alpha were from a surface low northeast of Florida, associated with the larger-scale, cold core upper low. It organized, and late on May 23 it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>classified</b> <b>as</b> a subtropical depression, east of the Georgia/South Carolina border. While southeast of Hatteras, North Carolina, a developing ridge blocked its northeast motion, and so it slowed to turn to the southeast. On May 25, a small, intense low-level center organized rapidly, and by the next day it attained gale force winds, by which time the storm turned southwestward. At 1600 UTC on May 26, the National Hurricane Center initiated advisories on Subtropical Cyclone Alpha, when the storm was about 225 miles south of Cape Hatteras. Around that time, it reached its peak winds of 70mph (110km/h).|$|E

25|$|Dingo-samples {{that have}} been {{collected}} in the 1960s and 1970s indicated {{that half of the}} wild dogs of southern Australia were dingo-hybrids; analyses from the early 1980s supported the trend of increasing interbreeding. Based on skull features researchers found out that the proportion of “pure” dingoes in the highlands of the Southeast decreased from 49% in the 1960s to 17% in the 1980s. During examinations in the year 1985 in Southeast-Australia only 55% of the 407 studied “dingoes” weren’t hybrids. 36% of the dogs were dingo-hybrids and the rest wild dogs of other origin. In the middle of the 1980s the proportion of “pure” dingoes respectively dingo-hybrids in Central Australia was estimated (based on skull features) to be 97.5% and 2.4%. To the contrary, in Southeast-Australia the estimates were 55.3% respectively 33.92%. It was reasoned from these findings that mixed populations can be expected in areas were human settlements exist and wild dogs remain, furthermore that hybrids can be expected to be rarer in remote areas. Broken colour-patterns, red with white, black or bluish spots, completely black, brown or bluish, black-and-white and piebald striped patterns were also more prevalent in the second area (34.8%) than in the first (5.7%). In Southeast-Australia there were no differences between areas near farmlands and forest concerning the frequency of the colorations. Many of these colorations also occurred in breeding experiments of reddish dingoes with variously colored other domestic dogs. All in all about 50% of the populations in Eastern and Southern Australia consisted of hybrids in the 1980s. Depending on the area in Southeast-Australia it was estimated that the proportion of “pure” dingoes was at least 22% and at its most 65%. 100 dog skulls from the Queensland Museum were measured and analysed, to determine the frequency of dingoes in the dog-populations of Queensland. The highest frequency of dingoes (95%) was found among skulls from central Queensland and the highest frequency of other domestic dogs and dingo-hybrids (50%) was found in the Southeast of the state. Fraser Island had only a low frequency of hybrids (17%) that were mostly limited to the southern half of the island. It was estimated back then that the proportion of dingo-hybrids in the continent-wide population was about 78%. At the turn of the millennium only 74% of 180 skulls from seven main areas of Australia <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>classified</b> <b>as</b> dingo-skulls during measurements and none of the populations consisted exclusively of dingoes. According to Laurie Corbett some examined wild dog populations in New South Wales consisted entirely of hybrids.|$|E

DraftKings also entered into an advertising deal with Fox Sports; in exchange for Fox acquiring an $150 million equity stake in the company, DraftKings agreed to buy $250 million in advertising over the next three years.

500|$|The state officially {{labeled the}} All-China Women's Federation an NGO in 1995. Yet how {{applicable}} the term NGO {{is to the}} ACWF has been contested, given the ACWF’s long and continuing relationship with the CPC. Some leaders in the women’s movement opposed the ACWF attending an NGO forum in Manila in 1993 {{because they did not}} believe that it met the criteria of an NGO. Even the ACWF hesitates using the term NGO within China because it has been linked to anti-government groups, although it has embraced the title internationally. International donor agencies generally are more likely to work with NGO's, so the classification of an NGO has helped the ACWF obtain financing from international organizations. [...] Others believe that the ACWF classifies as an NGO because it has separated itself from the government in recent years, and still others believes that ACWF <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>classified</b> <b>as</b> a NGO if the definition was broadened. [...] Those is support of this modified stance believe that complete separation from the government would be impossible and harmful to the ACWF. The ACWF continues to have internal and external debates about the NGO title.|$|E

Wilton Water by Crofton Locks and the Kennet Valley gravel pits provide habitats for breeding and wintering waterfowl. Several species of Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies) and other invertebrates have also been recorded.
