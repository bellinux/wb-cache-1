40|$|Third World hinterlands provide {{most of the}} {{settings}} in which the quality of human life has improved the least over the decade since Our Common Future was published. This {{low quality of life}} promotes a desire for large number of offspring, fuelling population growth and an exodus to the urban centres of the Third World, Enhancing {{the quality of life of}} these people in ways compatible with the health of their environments is therefore the most significant of the challenges from the perspective of sustainable development. Human quality of life may be viewed in terms of access to goods, services and a satisfying social role. The ongoing processes of globalization are enhancing flows of goods worldwide, but these hardly reach the poor of Third World countrysides. But processes of globalization have also vastly improved everybody's access to Information, and there are excellent opportunities of putting this to good use to enhance the quality of life of the people of Third World countrysides through better access to education and health. More importantly, better access to information could promote a more satisfying social role through strengthening grass-roots involvement in development planning and management of natural resources. I illustrate these possibilities with the help of a series of concrete experiences form the south Indian state of Kerala. Such an effort does not call for large-scare material inputs, rather it calls for a culture of inform-and-share in place place of the prevalent culture of <b>control-and-command.</b> It calls for openness and transparency in transactions involving government agencies, NGOs, and national and transnational business enterprises. It calls for acceptance of accountability by such agencies...|$|E

In the United Kingdom a tradable permit system, known as the Producer Responsibility Note (PRN) system, {{is being used to}} incentivise recycling activities {{in order to meet the}} targets of the Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive (94 / 62 /EC). This study examines the possibilities of using a tradable permit system based on the PRN system, but without its legislative backing, in the management of clinical waste. Through a number of interviews with key players in the healthcare, waste management and reprocessing sectors, it aims to assess the feasibility of recycling clinical waste, which has been sterilised by microwave or heat treatment, and of creating an end market for products made from the recyclate. The discussion focuses on issues of segregation of and public perception towards the sterilised waste and explores the influence of these issues on the viability of a tradable permit system for clinical waste. Two approaches of applying a tradable permit system to the recycling of clinical waste are considered, one involving a tight relationship between clinical waste management company and the hospital trust, the other adding the participation of reprocessors to create an open market scenario. The absence of legislative targets for clinical waste management and the uncertainty of an end market for the recyclate necessitate incentivisation of such a system possibly through a government fund, which may undermine the critical factor of reducing the cost of compliance inherent to a tradable permit system. The conclusion emphasises that recycling of sterilised clinical waste is difficult to justify environmentally or financially unless an end market for the recyclate is assured...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the enhancement of the visual feedback for the teleoperator of an all-terrain fast mobile robot. Indeed, remote control trials have shown inferior mobility performances (as speed, accuracy) in relation to direct driving of the same vehicles. Our goal of improving these performances for an operational application needs notably an better visual perception. This article deals with the first step of this goal. Studies showed notably that the teleoperator needs a large field of view. We decide {{to take advantage of the}} rough movement of the camera induced by the robot motion on unstructured ground. We use this environment sweep of the camera to dynamically build an image mosaic which is a way for extending the operator field of view using one camera. The image mosaic is made of the successive video images aligned together to display an coherent and stable environment in spite of the camera motion. The correct alignement is realized using an iterative multiresolution method and points of interest matching. - to reduce the data rate involved between the robot and the <b>control-and-command</b> station,- to reduce costs by using shelf equipment in exploiting at the best their resources,- the robot moves in an all-terrain unstructured environment, which induces a rough movement of the camera. The result of this visual feedback to the operator can be a loss of spatial orientation and motion sickness, wich deteriorates performance even more. According to the foregoing, this first approach consists in exploiting one camera and taking advantage of the camera movement induced by the robot motion on allterrain ground. The camera field of view which scans the environment will be used to extend the field of view displayed to the teleoperator by dynamically compiling an image mosaic. This latter will consist of all the images broadcasted by the robot which are arranged in a coincident way so as to display a coherent environment. ...|$|E
