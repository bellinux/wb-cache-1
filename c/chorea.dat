5|$|<b>Chorea</b> acanthocytosis is an {{autosomal}} recessive disorder caused by mutations in the VPS13A, also called CHAC, on chromosome 9q21. The gene encodes the protein Vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 13A, {{also known as}} chorein. The protein's function is unknown.|$|E
5|$|The 'core' neuroacanthocytosis syndromes are <b>chorea</b> acanthocytosis and McLeod syndrome. Acanthocytes {{are nearly}} always present in these {{conditions}} and they share common clinical features. Some of these features are also seen in the other neurological syndromes associated with neuroacanthocytosis.|$|E
5|$|The 'core' neuroacanthocytosis syndromes, {{in which}} acanthocytes are a typical feature, are <b>chorea</b> acanthocytosis and McLeod syndrome.

50|$|Parkinson's disease {{results in}} loss of dopaminergic {{innervation}} to the dorsal striatum (and other basal ganglia) and {{a cascade of}} consequences. Atrophy of the striatum is also involved in Huntington's disease, <b>choreas,</b> choreoathetosis, and dyskinesias.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} family with {{infantile}} onset of progressive choreoathetosis. The movements affected the legs predominantly and also impaired gait. No dementia, seizures, or rigidity was noted. Inheritance was autosomal dominant. This new familial movement disorder can be differentiated easily from other hereditary <b>choreas...</b>|$|R
40|$|The Task Force for Nomenclature of Genetic Movement Disorders {{recently}} {{proposed a}} new system of naming genetically determined movement disorders. 1 These recommendations apply to a wide spectrum of movement disorders, including parkinsonisms, dystonias, <b>choreas,</b> paroxysmal movement disorders, cerebellar ataxias, and spastic paraplegias. We agree that current genetic classifications are cumbersome and “unsuitable” for accurate and comprehensive categorization of genetic movement disorders...|$|R
5|$|The {{condition}} was formerly called 'Huntington's chorea' but this term {{has been replaced}} by 'Huntington's disease' because not all patients develop <b>chorea</b> and due to the importance of cognitive and behavioral problems.|$|E
5|$|The most {{characteristic}} initial {{physical symptoms}} are jerky, random, and uncontrollable movements called <b>chorea.</b> <b>Chorea</b> may be initially exhibited as general restlessness, small unintentionally initiated or uncompleted motions, lack of coordination, or slowed saccadic eye movements. These minor motor abnormalities usually precede more obvious signs of motor dysfunction {{by at least}} three years. The clear appearance of symptoms such as rigidity, writhing motions or abnormal posturing appear as the disorder progresses. These are signs that the system in the brain {{that is responsible for}} movement has been affected. Psychomotor functions become increasingly impaired, such that any action that requires muscle control is affected. Common consequences are physical instability, abnormal facial expression, and difficulties chewing, swallowing, and speaking. Eating difficulties commonly cause weight loss and may lead to malnutrition. Sleep disturbances are also associated symptoms. Juvenile HD differs from these symptoms in that it generally progresses faster and <b>chorea</b> is exhibited briefly, if at all, with rigidity being the dominant symptom. Seizures are also a common symptom of this form of HD.|$|E
5|$|A second form of neuroacanthocytosis, Levine-Critchley syndrome, was {{discovered}} by the American internist Irvine M. Levine in 1960 and reported in Neurology in 1964, and again in 1968. Subsequently, similar symptoms were identified and described by the British neurologist MacDonald Critchley in 1968. In both cases, the physicians described a hereditary syndrome that combined acanthocytosis with neurological peculiarities but normal serum lipoprotein. Specific symptoms included tics, grimacing, movement disorders, difficulty swallowing, poor coordination, hyporeflexia, <b>chorea,</b> and seizures. Patients often mutilated their tongues, lips, and cheeks. The diseases appeared in both sexes, and were usually diagnosed in infancy.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Huntington's disease (HD) is an {{autosomal}} dominant neurodegenerative disease classified under the <b>choreas.</b> Besides motor symptoms, HD {{is marked by}} cognitive and behavioral symptoms, impacting patients' functional capacity. The progression of cognitive impairment and neuropsychiatric symptoms occur in parallel with neurodegeneration. The nature of these symptoms is very dynamic, and the major clinical challenges include executive dysfunction, apathy, depression and irritability. Herein, we provide a focused updated review on the cognitive and psychiatric features of HD...|$|R
50|$|In the 15th century {{performing}} arts, {{along with}} the arts in general, saw a revival as the Renaissance began in Italy and spread throughout Europe plays, some of which incorporated dance, which were performed and Domenico da Piacenza credited with the first {{use of the term}} ballo (in De Arte Saltandi et <b>Choreas</b> Ducendi) instead of danza (dance) for his baletti or balli. The term eventually became Ballet. The first Ballet per se is thought to be Balthasar de Beaujoyeulx's Ballet Comique de la Reine (1581).|$|R
50|$|In late 1455 he choreographed {{dances for}} the wedding between Ippolita Maria Sforza and Alfonso II. In the 1450s or 1460s he {{published}} De arte saltandi et <b>choreas</b> ducendi about dancing and choreography, {{which was the first}} European guide on dancing and gives instructions on various dances and also outlines what is required to be a good dancer. He identified that successful dance consisted of many techniques: music tempo understanding, step knowledge, manner, agility, motion moderation, body control and speed. Piacenza died in around 1470 in Ferrara, Northern Italy.|$|R
5|$|A veterinarian, Alfred Sewell, {{said the}} system Bayliss was using was {{unlikely}} to be adequate, but other witnesses, including Frederick Hobday of the Royal Veterinary College, disagreed; {{there was even a}} claim that Bayliss had used too much anaesthesia, which is why the dog had failed to respond to the electrical stimulation. Bayliss said the dog had been suffering from <b>chorea,</b> a disease that causes involuntary spasm, and that any movement Lind af Hageby and Schartau had seen was not purposive. Four students, three women and a man, were called by Bayliss's counsel and testified that the dog had appeared to be unconscious.|$|E
5|$|Reported neuropsychiatric manifestations are anxiety, depression, {{a reduced}} display of {{emotions}} (blunted affect), egocentrism, aggression, and compulsive behavior, {{the latter of}} which can cause or worsen addictions, including alcoholism, gambling, and hypersexuality. Difficulties in recognizing other people's negative expressions have also been observed. The prevalence of these symptoms is highly variable between studies, with estimated rates for lifetime prevalence of psychiatric disorders between 33% and 76%. For many sufferers and their families, these symptoms {{are among the most}} distressing aspects of the disease, often affecting daily functioning and constituting reason for institutionalization. Suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts are more common than in the general population. Often individuals have reduced awareness of <b>chorea,</b> cognitive and emotional impairments.|$|E
5|$|About 99% of HD diagnoses {{based on}} the typical {{symptoms}} and {{a family history of}} the disease are confirmed by genetic testing to have the expanded trinucleotide repeat that causes HD. Most of the remaining are called HD-like (HDL) syndromes. The cause of most HDL diseases is unknown, but those with known causes are due to mutations in the prion protein gene (HDL1), the junctophilin 3 gene (HDL2), a recessively inherited unknown gene (HDL3—only found in two families and poorly understood), and the gene encoding the TATA box-binding protein (SCA17, sometimes called HDL4). Other autosomal dominant diseases that can be misdiagnosed as HD are dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy and neuroferritinopathy. There are also autosomal recessive disorders that resemble sporadic cases of HD. These include <b>chorea</b> acanthocytosis and pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration. One X-linked disorder of this type is McLeod syndrome.|$|E

40|$|The word fantasmata, used by Domenico di Piacenza in De arte et saltandi <b>choreas</b> ducendi, {{has been}} {{investigated}} by many scholars and raised many debates. We could summarize the concept of fantasmata in that moment of suspension, full of energy and emotion, between movement and stasis, between {{the power and the}} act, which has many references to classical culture. Another word extremely complex is created by Cesare Brandi to describe an aesthetic phase of the perception of the work of art: the astanza. When the art is manifested to consciousness, condenses it into an image, it create a suspension of existence. Investigating the different meanings and connotations of the concepts of fantasmata and astanza, there are three issues that return strongly: image (with deep connections to the memory), time and space...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the small}} animal imaging {{generally}} requires anesthesia, anesthetic agents can induce unintended effects on animal physiology that may confound {{the results of}} imaging studies [1]. The use of isoflurane and ketamine/xylazine anesthesia is popular in imaging studies of laboratory animals. The striatum is the major input station of the basal ganglia system. It is involved in Parkinson's disease, Huntington’s disease, <b>choreas,</b> choreoathetosis and dyskinesias [2]. Recently, 1 H-MRS studies of common and severe neuropsychiatric disorders (e. g., obsessive-compulsive disorder, schizophrenia, etc.) have reported abnormal metabolite levels in the striatum (cudate and putamen nuclei) [3]. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate alterations in striatum metabolites of rats between anesthetized with isoflurane and with ketamine/xylazine in proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1 H-MRS), and to investigate the appropriateness of anesthetic agents for 1 H-MRS study...|$|R
5|$|Huntington's disease (HD), {{also known}} as Huntington's <b>chorea,</b> is an {{inherited}} disorder that results in death of brain cells. The earliest symptoms are often subtle problems with mood or mental abilities. A general lack of coordination and an unsteady gait often follow. As the disease advances, uncoordinated, jerky body movements become more apparent. Physical abilities gradually worsen until coordinated movement becomes difficult and the person is unable to talk. Mental abilities generally decline into dementia. The specific symptoms vary somewhat between people. Symptoms usually begin between 30 and 50 years of age, but can start at any age. The disease may develop earlier in life in each successive generation. About 8% of cases start {{before the age of}} 20 years and typically present with symptoms more similar to Parkinson's disease. People with HD often underestimate the degree of their problems.|$|E
25|$|Hyperkinesia, more {{specifically}} <b>chorea,</b> is the hallmark symptom of Huntington's disease, formerly {{referred to as}} Huntington’s <b>chorea.</b> Appropriately, <b>chorea</b> {{is derived from the}} Greek word, khoros, meaning “dance.” The extent of the hyperkinesia exhibited in the disease can vary from solely the little finger to the entire body, resembling purposeful movements but occurring involuntarily. In children, rigidity and seizures are also symptoms.|$|E
25|$|<b>Chorea</b> is a continuous, random-appearing {{sequence}} {{of one or}} more discrete involuntary movements or movement fragments. Although <b>chorea</b> consists of discrete movements, many are often strung together in time, thus making it difficult to identify each movement's start and end point. These movements can involve the face, trunk, neck, tongue, and extremities. Unlike dystonic movements, chorea-associated movements are often more rapid, random and unpredictable. Movements are repeated, but not rhythmic in nature. Children with <b>chorea</b> appear fidgety and will often try to disguise the random movements by voluntarily turning the involuntary, abnormal movement into a seemingly more normal, purposeful motion. <b>Chorea</b> may result specifically from disorders of the basal ganglia, cerebral cortex, thalamus, and cerebellum. It has also been associated with encephalitis, hyperthyroidism, anticholinergic toxicity, and other genetic and metabolic disorders. <b>Chorea</b> is also the prominent movement featured in Huntington's disease.|$|E
5|$|Secondary {{causes of}} tics (not related to {{inherited}} Tourette syndrome) are {{commonly referred to}} as tourettism. Dystonias, <b>choreas,</b> other genetic conditions, and secondary causes of tics should be ruled out in the differential diagnosis for Tourette syndrome. Other conditions that may manifest tics or stereotyped movements include developmental disorders, autism spectrum disorders, and stereotypic movement disorder; Sydenham's chorea; idiopathic dystonia; and genetic conditions such as Huntington's disease, neuroacanthocytosis, Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Wilson's disease, and tuberous sclerosis. Other possibilities include chromosomal disorders such as Down syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome, XYY syndrome and fragile X syndrome. Acquired causes of tics include drug-induced tics, head trauma, encephalitis, stroke, and carbon monoxide poisoning. The symptoms of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome may also be confused with Tourette syndrome. Most of these conditions are rarer than tic disorders, and a thorough history and examination may be enough to rule them out, without medical or screening tests.|$|R
50|$|In the 15th century, court festivities in Italy became {{ever more}} elaborate, often {{featuring}} formal dances. One {{of the early}} masters was Domenico da Piacenza (c. 1400-1470) who compiled a manual of dance: De arte saltandi et <b>choreas</b> ducendi. In France, too, professional dancing {{began to take shape}} when dancers performed for Henry III of France at Fontainebleau in the early 1580s. Further presentations were made for Louis XIII, who frequently took the main part himself. But it was, above all, during the reign of Louis XIV (1643-1715) that the foundations were laid for what became known as ballet. The king not only had the rules of dance written down but established the Académie Royale de Danse in 1661, which developed into today's Paris Opera Ballet. Many of the early ballets were created by the Italian-French composer Jean Baptiste Lully and the French choreographer Pierre Beauchamp, often assisted by Molière.|$|R

25|$|<b>Chorea</b> {{is another}} {{condition}} which results from {{damage to the}} basal ganglia. Similar to athetosis, it results from mutations affecting the pallidum inhibition of the thalamus as well as increased dopaminergic activity {{at the level of}} the striatum. Considering the etiology of both disorders are fairly similar, it comes as no surprise that <b>chorea</b> and athetosis can and usually do occur together in a condition called choreoathetosis.|$|E
25|$|In children, primary {{dystonia}} {{is usually}} inherited genetically. Secondary dystonia, however, is most commonly caused by dyskinetic cerebral palsy, due to hypoxic or ischemic {{injury to the}} basal ganglia, brainstem, cerebellum, and thalamus during the prenatal or infantile stages of development. <b>Chorea</b> and ballism {{can be caused by}} damage to the subthalamic nucleus. <b>Chorea</b> can be secondary to hyperthyroidism.

2500|$|Cato wrote both {{vocal and}} {{instrumental}} music, and both sacred and secular: [...] however {{he was most}} famous for his works for lute.

5000|$|In {{contrast}} to the stereotyped movements of other movement disorders (e.g.; <b>choreas,</b> dystonias, myoclonus, and dyskinesias), the tics of Tourette's are temporarily suppressible and preceded by a premonitory urge. [...] Immediately preceding tic onset, most individuals with Tourette syndrome are aware of an urge, [...] {{which is similar to}} the need to sneeze or scratch an itch. Individuals describe the need to tic as the buildup of tension in a particular anatomical location, which they consciously choose to release, as if the subject [...] "had to do it". [...] Examples of the premonitory urge are the feeling of having something in one's throat, or a localized discomfort in the shoulders, leading to the need to clear one's throat or shrug the shoulders. The actual tic may be felt as relieving this tension or sensation, similar to scratching an itch. Another example is blinking to relieve an uncomfortable sensation in the eye. Published descriptions of the tics of Tourette's identify sensory phenomena as the core symptom of Tourette syndrome, even though they are not included in the diagnostic criteria.|$|R
