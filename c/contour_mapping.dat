40|$|The article {{deals with}} the {{features}} of the spatial representation of the location of objects and phenomena on the Earth. One of the types of “cartographic representation” is modeling on the <b>contour</b> <b>map.</b> The advantages of the method are revealed. The application of modeling techniques that allows one to include ethnogeographic data in the content of the characteristics of the territory and reflect them on the <b>contour</b> <b>map.</b> The basis of ethnogeographic modeling is the identification and creation of elements of the material and spiritual culture of peoples by means of conventional signs. Comparison of these elements, their superimposition with respect to each other, as well as their comparison with geographic maps allow us to determine the interrelations and the dependence of the phenomenon. Modeling on <b>contour</b> <b>maps</b> is the basic method of learning in geography. On the one hand, it creates a cartographic image of the studied territory, {{and on the other hand}} it facilitates the creation of “visual supports” on the <b>map.</b> Modeling on <b>contour</b> <b>maps,</b> at the beginning students put the basic geographical names, which will serve as the basic knowledge. Then, by purposefully analyzing and comparing the thematic maps of the atlas or textbook, the students reflect specific ethno-geographical knowledge on <b>contour</b> <b>maps.</b> As a result, <b>contour</b> <b>maps</b> acquire “their own face”, and do not become a simple copy of maps of an atlas or textbook. Also, {{the features of the}} effect of this technique on the formation of spatial representations about the studied object have been analyzed. Thanks to the cartographic model, one can maintain a constant cognitive interest in the material studied. Modeling on the <b>contour</b> <b>map</b> will allow one to present the structure of the links between the elements of the ethnogeographical material. The basis of ethnogeographic modeling on the <b>contour</b> <b>map</b> is the identification and mapping of elements of the material and spiritual culture of peoples. This position is favorable for the compilation of a complex ethnographic characterization of the territory.  </p...|$|R

50|$|The {{combination}} of magnetron, transmit-receive (T-R) switch, small antenna and high resolution allowed small, powerful radars {{to be installed}} in aircraft. Maritime patrol aircraft could detect objects as small as submarine periscopes, allowing aircraft to track and attack submerged submarines, where before only surfaced submarines could be detected. In addition, radar could detect the submarine at a much greater range than visual observation, both in the daylight and at night, when submarines had previously considered themselves safe to surface and recharge their batteries. Centimetric <b>contour</b> <b>mapping</b> radars like H2S, and the even higher frequency American-created H2X, allowed new tactics in the strategic bombing campaign. Centimetric gun-laying radars were much more accurate than the older technology. Allied naval gunnery improved and, along with the proximity fuze, radar made anti-aircraft guns much more effective.
