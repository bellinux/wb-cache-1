25|$|Late 20th century domestic/studio models {{typically}} use up to 200 latch-hook needles to {{hold the}} stitches in fine, standard, mid-gauge or bulky gauge needle. A carriage or <b>cam</b> <b>box</b> is passed across the bed of needles causing the needle movements required to produce each next stitch. By means of various selection methods, e.g. punch cards, particular needles can be caused to travel by alternate pathways through the <b>cam</b> <b>box.</b> Thus needles will knit or not, and the unknitted yarn portions will lie under (slip stitch) or over the needle or {{be held in the}} needle hook (tuck stitch). Needles can be placed in holding position to allow short row shaping. In the most modern machines, punchcards have been replaced by computer control.|$|E
50|$|In service, {{some trouble}} was {{experienced}} with transmission shaft joints and with worn cams and rollers. If the valves were set {{with the engine}} cold, {{there appeared to be}} some distortion under working conditions due to the high temperature of superheated steam which caused deterioration of the valve events. Drivers also reported that, when the engines were standing or moving at very slow speed, it was difficult to reverse since the cam rollers were not readily able to climb over the inclined surfaces leading from one cam to another. Trouble was also experienced with steam leaking past the tappet spindles into the <b>cam</b> <b>boxes</b> where it boiled up the oil and caused it to overflow from the <b>cam</b> <b>boxes.</b> This was overcome by serrating the collars of the spindle bushes to allow the steam to escape and prevent entry into the <b>cam</b> <b>boxes.</b>|$|R
50|$|The rotary cam {{poppet valve}} gear {{consists}} of two admission valves and two exhaust valves per cylinder, operated by a camshaft arranged in a box fixed to each cylinder between the valve chambers. The <b>cam</b> <b>boxes</b> are self-contained and detachable, and replacement <b>cam</b> <b>boxes</b> can be fitted at running sheds within a few hours. The camshafts are driven from the return cranks on the driving wheels through worm wheels and universal propeller shafts, arranged so that the camshafts and the coupled wheels revolve at the same speed.|$|R

5000|$|The ECR {{opened a}} [...] "flag station" [...] at Chesterton Junction on 19 January 1850. It {{remained}} open until October 1850. It was {{situated on the}} north side of Fen Road just before the main line crossed the River <b>Cam.</b> A signal <b>box</b> controlling the junction and level crossing over Fen Road stood at the northern end of the bridge until November 1984.|$|R
50|$|Abstractly {{programmable}} toolpath guidance {{began with}} mechanical solutions, {{such as in}} musical <b>box</b> <b>cams</b> and Jacquard looms. The convergence of programmable mechanical control with machine tool toolpath control was delayed many decades, {{in part because the}} programmable control methods of musical boxes and looms lacked the rigidity for machine tool toolpaths. Later, electromechanical solutions (such as servos) and soon electronic solutions (including computers) were added, leading to numerical control and computer numerical control.|$|R
50|$|ESPN was {{a premium}} sport channel {{offering}} Premier League football among other sports for a monthly fee. The channel could be accessed through a conditional-access module (<b>CAM),</b> set top <b>box</b> with a slot, an IDTV with a slot {{or through a}} Top Up TV Freeview+ box. It replaced Setanta Sports 1 when its parent company went into administration and was closed. Because this channel time-shared with the downloads for the TV Favourites service, it was barred from broadcasting 24 hours a day. Between Setanta Sports 1 closing and ESPN launching, ESPN America filled airtime whilst carriage negotiations were ongoing. The channel is still offered by BT TV under their BT Sport package.|$|R
5000|$|Alex (Ariel Winter) tells Mitch {{that she}} knows exactly how he feels because her mom does the same when she wins {{something}} by displaying Luke's (Nolan Gould) [...] "awards" [...] next to hers. The discussion with Alex makes Mitch realize that he is acting like a 14-year-old girl and he decides to make a display for Cam with all his awards. He goes to the garage and he is surprised of how many awards Cam won as a teenager but he was keeping them hidden to not hurt his feelings. The moment he tries to carry the box with the awards in the house, he sees a mouse and drops it, and starts kicking the <b>box.</b> <b>Cam</b> sees that and he believes that Mitch acts that way because he is jealous of his many awards.|$|R
50|$|Now {{deciding}} to let fate take its course, Chuck puts Cam {{in touch with}} Howard, and the two seem to connect instantly. Stu convinces Chuck to chase after Cam, who is now headed to Antarctica with Howard. After Chuck finds her, Cam reveals that Howard is already married to someone else, and that she's only leaving for a week. Chuck hands <b>Cam</b> a ring <b>box</b> containing a pebble, {{a reference to the}} penguin mating ritual in which a male penguin finds a stone and brings it to the female penguin he wants to be with (therefore, proposing to her). Meanwhile, Anisha is shown pulling a pin out of a voodoo doll, which signifies that Chuck is freed from the curse and has finally gotten the girl of his dreams. A year later, Chuck and Cam are in Antarctica together surrounded by penguins.|$|R
40|$|Evaluation of the {{effectiveness}} of a cheaper newly developed web cam trainer to assist surgeons in developing basic laparoscopic skills in comparison to other inexpensive trainers was our objective to make this study. This newly developed web cam trainer consists of a web cam (equipped with a light source and light sensor), a foam box and a home computer. This homemade trainer was compared to the cardboard trainer developed by End urology Institute, Cedars-Sini Medical Center, which consists of a web <b>cam,</b> a cardboard <b>box,</b> a desk lamp and a home computer. A total of twelve participants at the National Institute of Urology and Nephrology, Cairo, Egypt were divided into two groups each using both trainers to perform basic tasks (pattern cutting and suturing the skin of a raw chicken). Time of the participants to perform each task was used to evaluate {{the effectiveness}} of both trainers (performance time). Statistical analysis of the 3 tasks comparing between this web cam trainer and the cardboard web trainer, developed by end urology Institute, Cedars-Sini Medical Canter, showed no statistical significance between both web trainers during performing task 1 (p = 0. 590), but there was significant statistical difference during performing tasks 2 and 3 (pâ‰¤ 0. 001). We conclude that this web cam pelvitrainer simulates for novice laparoscopists an easier way to develop basic laparoscopy skills without the need for expensive instruments and specialized training centers. In addition, the ability to review recorded tasks allows the trainee to learn their mistakes and how to overcome them. It is also superior to the cardboard trainer in performing tasks requiring complex skills...|$|R
