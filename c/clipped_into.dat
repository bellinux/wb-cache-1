25|$|Sagan {{continued}} his successes by grabbing his first Monument {{victory at the}} Tour of Flanders, shedding his last opponent Sep Vanmarcke on the Paterberg and finishing the last 14 kilometers of the race solo, as the Cancellara-Vanmarcke duet had him in their sight but could not reach him. Sagan dedicated the win to two cyclists who died recently, Antoine Demoitié and Daan Myngheer. A week later, he took part in Paris-Roubaix, finishing eleventh after a split in the peloton occurred. He performed a stunt on a cobbled sector as Cancellara crashed directly before him by executing, a bunny hop over the Swiss' bike and avoided the crash, despite having only one foot <b>clipped</b> <b>into</b> his pedals at the time.|$|E
25|$|Two {{holes at}} the bottom left and right {{indicate}} whether the disk is write-protected and whether it is high-density; these holes are spaced as far apart as the holes in punched A4 paper, allowing write-protected high-density floppies to be <b>clipped</b> <b>into</b> standard ring binders. A notch at top right ensures that the disk is in the correct orientation and an arrow at top left indicating direction of insertion. The drive usually has a button that when pressed ejects the disk {{with varying degrees of}} force, the discrepancy due to the ejection force provided by the spring of the shutter. In IBM PC compatibles, Commodores, Apple II/IIIs, and other non-Apple-Macintosh machines with standard floppy disk drives, a disk may be ejected manually at any time. The drive has a disk-change switch that detects when a disk is ejected or inserted. Failure of this mechanical switch is a common source of disk corruption if a disk is changed and the drive (and hence the operating system) fails to notice.|$|E

500|$|Cancellara and Sagan {{worked hard}} {{together}} {{at the front of}} what was now the second group on the road. Shortly afterwards, the front group was disrupted when three of the four Team Sky riders in the front group – Rowe, Puccio and Gianni Moscon – crashed in just a few corners, leaving Stannard as the team's only rider in the leading group. With [...] remaining and the chasers 37 seconds behind the lead group, the riders crossed the five-star Mons-en-Pévèle cobbles. Cancellara crashed on a muddy section, slipping off the crown of the road. Sagan, riding immediately behind him, managed to bunny hop over him – with only one foot <b>clipped</b> <b>into</b> his bike – and continued in pursuit of the lead group; Cancellara, although able to continue the race, never rejoined the group. Terpstra was also among those to crash in the incident. Cycling Weekly described Sagan's manoeuvre as [...] "unbelievable bike handling".|$|E

[...] Parkland lies on the southeast side of the path, and this is separated from the formal gardens by the ha-ha.

Additionally, the [...] "PlayStation Move Sharp Shooter attachment" [...] is an accessory for the PlayStation Move motion controller that adapts both the motion controller and navigation controller into a submachine gun form, which features an adjustable shoulder support. The motion controller is fitted into the gun barrel so that the motion controller's T trigger is interlocked with the trigger, and the navigation controller is <b>clipped</b> <b>into</b> a holder below this gun barrel. However, the accessory adds several extra buttons and controls (via the EXT connector on the base of the Move Motion Controller).

6000|$|Before I {{reached the}} place I beheld {{symptoms}} of the tranquil character of its inhabitants. A little clump-built boat was in full sail along the lazy bosom of a canal, but its sail consisted of the blades of two paddles stood on end, while the navigator sat steering with a third paddle in the stern, crouched down like a toad, with a slouched hat drawn over his eyes. I presumed him to be some nautical lover {{on the way to}} his mistress. After proceeding a little further I came in sight of the harbor or port of destination of this drowsy navigator. This was the Broeken-Meer, an artificial basin, or sheet of olive-green water, tranquil as a mill-pond. On this the village of Broek is situated, and the borders are laboriously decorated with flower-beds, box-trees <b>clipped</b> <b>into</b> all kinds of ingenious shapes and fancies, and little [...] "lust" [...] houses, or pavilions.|$|E
60|$|The Squire {{receives}} great {{sympathy and}} support, in his antiquated humours, from the parson, of whom I made some mention on my former {{visit to the}} Hall, and who acts {{as a kind of}} family chaplain. He has been cherished by the Squire almost constantly, since the time that they were fellow-students at Oxford; for {{it is one of the}} peculiar advantages of these great universities, that they often link the poor scholar to the rich patron, by early and heart-felt ties, that last through life, without the usual humiliations of dependence and patronage. Under the fostering protection of the Squire, therefore, the little parson has pursued his studies in peace. Having lived almost entirely among books, and those, too, old books, he is quite ignorant of the world, and his mind is as antiquated as the garden at the Hall, where the flowers are all arranged in formal beds, and the yew-trees <b>clipped</b> <b>into</b> urns and peacocks.|$|E

60|$|As they {{examined}} him, {{holding him}} by the arms and hands, and gazing up into his face, the same idea occurred to all of them. Though they knew him very well now, they would hardly have known him had they met him suddenly in the streets. He seemed to have grown fifteen years older during the seven years of his absence. His face had become thin and long and almost hollow. His beard went all round under his chin, and was <b>clipped</b> <b>into</b> {{the appearance of a}} stiff thick hedge--equally thick, and equally broad, and equally protrusive at all parts. And within this enclosure it was shorn. But his mouth had sunk in, and his eyes. In colour he was almost darker than brown. You would have said that his skin had been tanned black, but for the infusion of red across it here and there. He seemed to be in good present health, but certainly bore the traces of many hardships 'And here you are all just as I left you,' he said, counting up his sisters.|$|E
60|$|It was the liveliest {{thing which}} he {{produced}} in the whole conversation. He told us, that his first ode was fifty years older than his last. I {{looked at him with}} much emotion--I considered him as the venerable father of German poetry; as a good man as a Christian; seventy-four years old; with legs enormously swollen; yet active, lively, cheerful, and kind, and communicative. My eyes felt as if a tear were swelling into them. In the portrait of Lessing there was a toupee periwig, which enormously injured the effect of his physiognomy--Klopstock wore the same, powdered and frizzled. By the bye, old men ought never to wear powder--the contrast between a large snow-white wig and the colour of an old man's skin is disgusting, and wrinkles in such a neighbourhood appear only channels for dirt. It is an honour to poets and great men, that you think of them as parts of Nature; and anything of trick and fashion wounds you in them, as much as when you see venerable yews <b>clipped</b> <b>into</b> miserable peacocks.--The author of THE MESSIAH should have worn his own grey hair.--His powder and periwig were to the eye what Mr. Virgil would be to the ear.|$|E
6000|$|We {{had found}} a spot where {{existence}} was a blessing; a spot where to exist was enough; where the [...] "to be" [...] was, for a moment, disjoined from the inexorable [...] "to do," [...] or [...] "to suffer." [...] How agreeable to converse with cultivated and refined artistic minds! How delightful to find people to whom the beautiful has been a study, and art {{a world in which}} they could live, move, and have their being! And yet it was impossible to prevent a shade of deep sadness from resting on all things--a tinge of melancholy. Why?--why this veil of dim and indefinable anguish at sight of whatever is most fair, at hearing whatever is most lovely? Is it the exiled spirit, yearning for its own? Is it the captive, to whom the ray of heaven's own glory comes through the crevice of his dungeon walls? But this is a digression. Returning, we examined the mansion, a fine specimen of the old French chateau; square-built, with high Norman roof, and a round, conical-topped tower at each corner. In front was a garden, curiously laid out in beds, and knots of flowers, with a fountain in the centre. This garden was enclosed on all sides by beech trees, <b>clipped</b> <b>into</b> lofty walls of green. The chateau had once been fortified, but now the remains of the fortifications are made into terraces, planted with roses and honeysuckles.

[...] However, by 1988, an easy to use applicator delivery system was developed, and a functional reloadable endoclip system was described. [...] This consisted of a stainless steel clip (of size approximately 6 mm long and 1.2 mm wide at the prongs) with a metal deployment device (that {{could be used to}} insert the <b>clip</b> <b>into</b> the endoscopic camera, and deployed outside the camera) enclosed in a plastic sheath.

6000|$|In {{some such}} {{insidious}} form {{there is at}} present a strong tendency to this narrow theory of life, and to the pinched and hidebound type of human character which it patronises. Many persons, no doubt, sincerely think that human beings thus cramped and dwarfed, are as their Maker designed them to be; just as many have thought that trees are a much finer thing when <b>clipped</b> <b>into</b> pollards, or cut out into figures of animals, than as nature made them. But if it be any part of religion to believe that man was made by a good being, it is more consistent with that faith to believe, that this Being gave all human faculties {{that they might be}} cultivated and unfolded, not rooted out and consumed, and that he takes delight in every nearer approach made by his creatures to the ideal conception embodied in them, every increase in any of their capabilities of comprehension, of action, or of enjoyment. There is a different type of human excellence from the Calvinistic; a conception of humanity as having its nature bestowed on it for other purposes than merely to be abnegated. [...] "Pagan self-assertion" [...] is one of the elements of human worth, as well as [...] "Christian self-denial."[12] There is a Greek ideal of self-development, which the Platonic and Christian ideal of self-government blends with, but does not supersede. It may be better to be a John Knox than an Alcibiades, but it is better to be a Pericles than either; nor would a Pericles, if we had one in these days, be without anything good which belonged to John Knox.|$|E
60|$|Redclyffe, {{being not}} even yet strong, {{used to spend}} much time, when the day chanced to be pleasant, (which was oftener than his preconceptions of English weather led him to expect,) in the garden behind the Warden's house. It was an {{extensive}} one, and apparently as antique {{as the foundation of}} the establishment; and during all these years it had probably been growing richer and richer. Here were flowers of ancient race, and some that had been merely field or wayside flowers when first they came into the garden; but by long cultivation and hereditary care, instead of dying out, they had acquired a new richness and beauty, so that you would scarcely recognize the daisy or the violet. Roses too, there were, which Doctor Hammond said had been taken from those white and red rose-trees in the Temple Gardens, whence the partisans of York and Lancaster had plucked their fatal badges. With these, there were all the modern and far-fetched flowers from America, the East, and elsewhere; even the prairie flowers and the California blossoms were represented here; for one of the brethren had horticultural tastes, and was permitted freely to exercise them there. The antique character of the garden was preserved, likewise, by the alleys of box, a part of which had been suffered to remain, and was now grown to a great height and density, so as to make impervious green walls. There were also yew trees <b>clipped</b> <b>into</b> strange shapes of bird and beast, and uncouth heraldic figures, among which of course the leopard's head grinned triumphant; and as for fruit, the high garden wall was lined with pear trees, spread out flat against it, where they managed to produce a cold, flavorless fruit, a good deal akin to cucumbers.|$|E
6000|$|... {{and not in}} {{the even}} flow, much less in the {{prominence}} of antithetic vigour, of single lines, which were indeed injurious to the total effect, except where they were introduced for some specific purpose. Klopstock assented, and said that he meant to confine Glover's superiority to single lines. He told us that he had read Milton, in a prose translation, when he was fourteen [77]. I understood him thus myself, and W---- interpreted Klopstock's French as I had already construed it. He appeared to know very little of Milton or indeed of our poets in general. He spoke with great indignation of the English prose translation of his MESSIAH. All the translations had been bad, very bad--but the English was no translation--there were pages on pages not in the original--and half the original was not {{to be found in the}} translation. W---- told him that I intended to translate a few of his odes as specimens of German lyrics--he then said to me in English, [...] "I wish you would render into English some select passages of THE MESSIAH, and revenge me of your countryman!". It was the liveliest thing which he produced in the whole conversation. He told us, that his first ode was fifty years older than his last. I looked at him with much emotion--I considered him as the venerable father of German poetry; as a good man; as a Christian; seventy-four years old; with legs enormously swollen; yet active, lively, cheerful, and kind, and communicative.
