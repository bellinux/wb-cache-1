He gives the first non-inductive proof of the binomial expansion for integer exponent using combinatorial arguments. On a note more distantly related to <b>combinatorics,</b> the second section also discusses the general formula for sums of integer powers; the free coefficients of this formula are therefore called the Bernoulli numbers, which influenced Abraham de Moivre's work later, and which have proven to have numerous applications in number theory.|$|E

Archimedes calculates {{the areas of the}} 14 pieces which can be assembled to form a square.

Dr. Netz calculates that the pieces can be made into a square 17,152 ways. The number of arrangements is 536 when solutions that are equivalent by rotation and reflection have been excluded.

5|$|In {{the field}} of {{statistics}} and applied probability, John Graunt published Natural and Political Observations Made upon the Bills of Mortality also in 1662, initiating the discipline of demography. This work, among other things, gave a statistical estimate {{of the population of}} London, produced the first life table, gave probabilities of survival of different age groups, examined the different causes of death, noting that the annual rate of suicide and accident is constant, and commented on the level and stability of sex ratio. The usefulness and interpretation of Graunt's tables were discussed in a series of correspondences by brothers Ludwig and Christiaan Huygens in 1667, where they realized the difference between mean and median estimates and Christian even interpolated Graunt's life table by a smooth curve, creating the first continuous probability distribution; but their correspondences were not published. Later, Johan de Witt, the then prime minister of the Dutch Republic, published similar material in his 1671 work Waerdye van Lyf-Renten (A Treatise on Life Annuities), which used statistical concepts to determine life expectancy for practical political purposes; a demonstration of the fact that this sapling branch of mathematics had significant pragmatic applications. De Witt's work was not widely distributed beyond the Dutch Republic, perhaps due to his fall from power and execution by mob in 1672. Apart from the practical contributions of these two work, they also exposed a fundamental idea that probability can be assigned to events that do not have inherent physical symmetry, such as the chances of dying at certain age, unlike say the rolling of a dice or flipping of a coin, simply by counting the frequency of occurrence. Thus probability could be more than mere <b>combinatorics.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{splitting}} method {{was defined by}} the author in [Margenstern 2002 a, Margenstern 2002 d]. It is at {{the basis of the}} notion of <b>combinatoric</b> tilings. As a consequence of this notion, there is a recurrence sequence which allows us to compute the number of tiles which are at a fixed distance from a given tile. A polynomial is attached to the sequence as well as a language which can be used for implementing cellular automata on the tiling. The goal {{of this paper is to}} prove that the tiling of hyperbolic 4 D space is <b>combinatoric.</b> We give here the corresponding polynomial and, as the first consequence, the language of the splitting is not regular, as it is the case in the tiling of hyperbolic 3 D space by rectangular dodecahedra which is also <b>combinatoric.</b> 1 Key Words: cellular automata, hyperbolic plan...|$|R

In a recent paper, Perez and Tun presented an ap- proximate <b>combinatoric</b> and an exact recursive formula for the statistical weight of Gentile Statistics, beginning from bosonic and fermionic cases, respectively [1]. In this paper, we obtain two exact, one <b>combinatoric</b> and one recursive, formulae for the statistical weight of Gentile Statistics, by an another approach. The <b>combinatoric</b> formula is valid only for special cases, whereas recursive formula is valid for all possible cases. Moreover, for a given q-maximum number of particles that can occupy a level for Gentile statistics-the recursive formula we have derived gives the result much faster than the recursive formula presented in [1], when one uses a computer program. Moreover we obtained the statistical weight for the distribution proposed by Dai and Xie in Ref. [2].

Here we develop some new <b>combinatoric</b> proofs and extensions of the tree formulas of Brydges and Kennedy, and test them on a series of pedagogical examples. A. 325. 0994 September 1994 I. Introduction Cluster expansions have a reputation of being hard to use; this is largely due to the difficulty to capture them in a single short formula. These expansions were introduced in constructive theory by Glimm, Jaffe and Spencer [GJS 1 - 2] and they were improved or generalized over the years [BF][BaF][Bat][B 1]. For many years the Ecole Polytechnique was happy using a cluster "tree formula" due to Brydges, Battle and Federbush (see [R 1 - 2] and references therein). This formula expresses connected amplitudes more naturally as sums over "ordered trees" rather than regular trees; but a <b>combinatoric</b> lemma due to Battle and Federbush, shows that the sum over all ordered trees corresponding to a given ordinary Cayl [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Many {{people have}} {{proposed}} objective functions, or optimizers, which guide one {{to schedule a}} multi-product single stage production system. In this paper we present a whole new class of optimizers, or solution concepts, which generalizes most of the well-known optimizers to date. Our <b>combinatoric</b> formulations are related to {{a new class of}} solution concepts for n-person games developed by Charnes-Kortanek [Charnes, A., K. O. Kortanek. 1967. On a class of convex and non-archimedean solution concepts for n-person games.

By constructing a <b>combinatoric</b> linear programming problem, where some of the variables are determined by an arbitrary set of permutations, we encompass classical optimizers in one formulation including such concepts as (1) minimizing maximum lateness or tardiness, (2) maximizing minimum lateness or tardiness, (3) minimizing mean lateness or flow time, and (4) random sequencing. More generally, we characterize a new class of optimizers as optimal solutions to specially constructed <b>combinatoric</b> programming problems, including optimizers which are integer in character. ...|$|R
