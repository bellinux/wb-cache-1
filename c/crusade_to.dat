5|$|Both {{the commons}} and King Richard II were {{enthusiastic}} about the launch of a <b>crusade</b> <b>to</b> Flanders, {{for political and economic}} reasons: revenues from the English wool staple (that had ceased following the advance of the French) could be resumed; sending the bishop and not the king or his uncles to Flanders would enable John of Gaunt's unpopular plans for a royal <b>crusade</b> <b>to</b> Castille to be abandoned; French forces would be drawn away from the Iberian peninsula; and Anglo-Flemish relations would be strengthened. Another advantage in approving a crusade was that its cost would be borne by the Church and not by means of government levies: ever since the Peasants' Revolt, the government was fearful of the consequences of imposing a tax to pay for a new war against the French.|$|E

5|$|After {{the death}} of Theobald III, Count of Champagne, the {{leadership}} of the Crusade passed to Boniface of Montferrat, a friend of the Hohenstaufen Philip of Swabia. Both Boniface and Philip had married into the Byzantine Imperial family. In fact, Philip's brother-in-law, Alexios Angelos, son of the deposed and blinded Emperor Isaac II Angelos, had appeared in Europe seeking aid and had made contacts with the crusaders. Alexios offered to reunite the Byzantine church with Rome, pay the crusaders 200,000 silver marks, join the crusade and provide all the supplies they needed to get to Egypt. Innocent was aware of a plan to divert the <b>Crusade</b> <b>to</b> Constantinople and forbade any attack on the city, but the papal letter arrived after the fleets had left Zara.|$|E

5|$|Dangerous or not, Bache {{soon began}} a lifelong <b>crusade</b> <b>to</b> win {{popularity}} for Liszt's works in England. In 1865 {{he began a}} series of annual concerts in conjunction with singer Gustave Garcia. They began modestly, in Collard's Rooms, Grosvenor Street. As they increased in popularity, they were relocated to the more spacious Beethoven Rooms in Cavendish Square, then to the Queen's Concert Rooms in Hanover Square, and finally to St. James's Hall in Regents Square. At first these concerts were of instrumental and chamber works and piano arrangements. In 1868, they had grown to include choral works, which allowed pieces such as Liszt's Soldatenlied and choruses from Wagner's Tannhäuser and Lohengrin to be programmed. By 1871, the concerts had been changed to an orchestral format.|$|E
5|$|Edward I {{became the}} king of England in 1272. Edward had {{extensive}} experience of warfare and sieges, having fought in Wales in 1257, led the six-month siege of Kenilworth Castle in 1266 and joined the <b>crusade</b> <b>to</b> North Africa in 1270. He had seen numerous European fortifications, including the planned walled town and castle design at Aigues-Mortes. On assuming the throne, one of Edward's first actions was to renovate and extend the royal fortress of the Tower of London. Edward was also responsible for building a sequence of planned, usually walled, towns called bastides across Gascony {{as part of his}} attempt to strengthen his authority in the region. Edward also authorised new planned towns to be built across England.|$|E
5|$|Ever {{since the}} Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos (r. 1259–1282) {{recovered}} Constantinople from the Latin Empire in 1261, the restored Byzantine Empire faced {{the threat of}} a Latin <b>crusade</b> <b>to</b> reclaim the city. The antagonistic Greek Despotate of Epirus and the Latin states of southern Greece, fearful of the Byzantine resurgence, sought aid from the Kingdom of Sicily, first under Manfred of Sicily (r. 1258–1266), and after 1266 under the ambitious Charles of Anjou (r. 1266–1285), who quickly established himself as Byzantium's chief antagonist. Countering the Angevin ruler's alliances and efforts to conquer Byzantium would occupy the remainder of Michael VIII's reign.|$|E

5|$|In 1244 {{a band of}} Khwarezmian mercenaries {{travelling}} to Egypt {{to serve}} As-Salih Ismail, Emir of Damascus, seemingly of their own volition, captured Jerusalem en route and defeated a combined Christian and Syrian army at the Battle of La Forbie. In response, LouisIX, king of France, organised a Crusade, called the Seventh <b>Crusade,</b> <b>to</b> attack Egypt, arriving in 1249. It was not a success. Louis was defeated at Mansura and captured as he retreated to Damietta. Another truce was agreed upon for a ten-year period, and Louis was ransomed. Louis remained in Syria until 1254 to consolidate the Crusader states. From 1265 to 1271, the Mamluk sultan Baibars drove the Franks to a few small coastal outposts.|$|E

Mordecai debuted in ring for the SmackDown! brand on May 16, 2004 during the Judgment Day pay-per-view, defeating Scotty 2 Hotty. In later appearances, Mordecai condemned the audience for their sins, and led them in prayer. Fertig's Mordecai character was originally created to have a feud with The Undertaker.|$|E

5|$|According to legend, Skanderbeg {{celebrated the}} event by dining off letnica (Ohrid trout), a fish found in Lake Ohrid {{that was sent}} to the Byzantine {{emperors}} every Friday for their supper meal. The twelve captured officers were ransomed for 40,000 ducats. Skanderbeg distributed this amount through his force, with every man receiving his fair share. He then besieged Ohrid for a short time before returning to Albania; the Venetian Senate hailed the campaign as a victory despite not being able to take Ohrid. The crusade seemed to have gone well for the Christian side but, after Pius' death, the remaining cardinals lost their hope and handed the money raised for the <b>crusade</b> <b>to</b> the Venetians. Mehmed saw Skanderbeg's vulnerability and sent Ballaban Badera, an Albanian janissary, to Albania where they met at Vaikal and he was defeated. Ballaban had replaced Şeremet as the commander in Ohrid after the latter fell out of favor with the sultan. Ballaban would meet Skanderbeg several more times in battle before being mortally wounded in action at the second siege of Krujë.|$|E
5|$|Although the German–Hungarian {{relations}} remained tense, {{no major}} confrontations {{occurred when the}} German crusaders marched through Hungary in June 1147. Two months later, Louis VII of France and his crusaders arrived, along with Boris Kalamanos who attempted {{to take advantage of}} the <b>crusade</b> <b>to</b> return to Hungary. Louis VII refused to extradite Boris to Géza, but prevented the pretender from coming into contacts with his supporters in Hungary and took him to Constantinople. Géza joined the coalition that Louis VII and Roger II of Sicily formed against Conrad III of Germany and the Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Komnenos. The ancestors of the Transylvanian Saxons came to Hungary during Géza's reign. Western European knights and Muslim warriors from the Pontic steppes also settled in Hungary in this period. Géza even allowed his Muslim soldiers to take concubines.|$|E
5|$|Andrew II betrothed Béla to {{an unnamed}} {{daughter}} of Tzar Boril of Bulgaria in 1213 or 1214, but their engagement was broken.

Furthermore, when leaving for a <b>Crusade</b> <b>to</b> the Holy Land in August 1217, King Andrew appointed John, Archbishop of Esztergom, to represent him during his absence. During this period, Béla stayed with his maternal uncle Berthold of Merania in Steyr in the Holy Roman Empire. Andrew II returned from the Holy Land in late 1218. He had arranged the engagement of Béla and Maria, a daughter of Theodore I Laskaris, Emperor of Nicaea. She accompanied King Andrew to Hungary and Béla married her in 1220.|$|E

5|$|As a {{young man}} he studied at Oxford University and held {{numerous}} positions in the English Church. He fought in Italy before being consecrated as a bishop in 1370. Parliament agreed to allow Despenser to lead a <b>crusade</b> <b>to</b> Flanders in 1383, which was directed against Louis II of Flanders, {{a supporter of the}} antipope Clement VII. The crusade was in defence of English economic and political interests. Although well funded, the expedition was poorly equipped and lacked proper military leadership. After initial successes, a disastrous attempt to besiege the city of Ypres forced Despenser to return to England. Upon his return he was impeached in parliament. His temporalities were confiscated by Richard II of England, but were returned in 1385, the year he accompanied the king northward to repel a potential French invasion of Scotland.|$|E
5|$|As {{the first}} son of HenryIII, Edward was {{involved}} {{early in the}} political intrigues of his father's reign, which included an outright rebellion by the English barons. In 1259, he briefly sided with a baronial reform movement, supporting the Provisions of Oxford. After reconciliation with his father, however, he remained loyal throughout the subsequent armed conflict, known as the Second Barons' War. After the Battle of Lewes, Edward was hostage to the rebellious barons, but escaped {{after a few months}} and joined the fight against Simon de Montfort. Montfort was defeated at the Battle of Evesham in 1265, and within two years the rebellion was extinguished. With England pacified, Edward joined the Ninth <b>Crusade</b> <b>to</b> the Holy Land. The crusade accomplished little, and Edward was on his way home in 1272 when he was informed that his father had died. Making a slow return, he reached England in 1274 and was crowned at Westminster on 19August.|$|E
5|$|Before {{leaving for}} Italy, Skanderbeg needed to {{accumulate}} the appropriate finances. Pius ordered the Diocese of Dalmatia {{to give a}} third of what it had raised for the forthcoming <b>crusade</b> <b>to</b> Skanderbeg. The pope also ordered 1,000 florins to be given to Skanderbeg from the Vatican's funds. The Ragusan banks held this amount, but due to the threat of an Ottoman invasion, they refused to continue funding the crusade; Stefan Vukčić of Zeta warned that the Ottomans would soon move into Dalmatia and Albania. They were thus reluctant to fund Skanderbeg's expedition to Italy. Due to issues of finance and the lack of large ships (he had, however, received several smaller ships to transport his troops), Skanderbeg's arrival was delayed while Ferdinand was under siege in Barletta. Before the siege began, however, Ferndinand sent four galleys to the Albanian shores where Skanderbeg and his men were waiting. Skanderbeg had meanwhile sent an unnamed captain to his eastern frontiers to guard against an Ottoman attack and left his wife, Donika, in charge of his affairs.|$|E
