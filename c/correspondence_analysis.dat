25|$|With the {{development}} of statistical techniques and numerical taxonomy in the 1960s, mathematical methods (including Cluster analysis, Principal components analysis, <b>correspondence</b> <b>analysis</b> and Factor analysis) {{have been used to}} build typologies. These techniques provide a qualitative way to articulate the degrees of consistency among particular attributes. Correlation coefficients created by these methods help archaeologists discern between meaningful and useless similarities between artefacts.

It is also used in output-only modal analysis, where the non-scaled mode shapes can be determined from the singular vectors.

Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey on {{a convenience sample of}} 321 consecutive psychiatric outpatients with emotional disorders. All patients completed self-report questionnaires assessing sociodemographic and clinical variables, patients’ preference of participation in decision making, perceived decisional conflict about treatment, adherence to prescribed treatment, and satisfaction with the psychiatric care provided. Multiple <b>correspondences</b> <b>analysis</b> was used to investigate relationships of decisional conflict with the variables of interest. Results: Approximately, two-thirds of psychiatric outpatients self-reported decisional conflict regarding their treatment. Interestingly, the presence of decisional conflict did not influence significantly patients’ preferences of participation or their adherence to prescribed treatment. Patients without decisional conflict registered significantly higher satisfaction. Multiple <b>correspondences</b> <b>analysis</b> evidenced two clear profiles: patients without decisional conflict received the treatment they preferred, mainly psychotherapy or combined treatment, had been under psychiatric treatment for longer than 5 years, and self-reported high satisfaction with health care received; on the other hand, patients with decisional conflict did not receive the treatment they preferred, were treated with pharmacotherapy alone {{for a period of time}} between 1 and 5 years, and self-reported medium satisfaction with received health care. Conclusion: The high level of decisional conflict found in patients with depression and anxiety attending a secondary care service could be an important driving force when personalizing and tailoring information and teaching skills to patients about their illnesses and their treatments.

2500|$|Developments in {{landscape}} ecology illustrate the important relationships between spatial patterns and ecological processes. These developments incorporate quantitative methods that link spatial patterns and ecological processes at broad {{spatial and temporal}} scales. [...] This linkage of time, space, and environmental change can assist managers in applying plans to solve environmental problems. [...] The increased attention in recent years on spatial dynamics has highlighted {{the need for new}} quantitative methods that can analyze patterns, determine the importance of spatially explicit processes, and develop reliable models. [...] Multivariate analysis techniques are frequently used to examine landscape level vegetation patterns. [...] Studies use statistical techniques, such as cluster analysis, canonical <b>correspondence</b> <b>analysis</b> (CCA), or detrended <b>correspondence</b> <b>analysis</b> (DCA), for classifying vegetation.

Results show that: i) aerobic disciplines present more variability than anaerobic ones, ii) mean RT interval are longer in sportsmen than in control subjects, iii) only the low frequencies of the HRV and VRV series are correlated, evidencing the heart rate modulation on ventricular repolarization, iv) the high frequencies of the RT space seem to be inadequate markers for the characterization of the ANS modulation on ventricular repolarization. 1...|$|R

Thirteen essential oils were highly effective, resulting in more than 90 % pinewood nematode mortality at 2 mg/mL, with six of them resulting in 100 % mortality.

Pentadesma butyracea Sabine is a {{tree that}} {{produces}} fruits containing oleaginous seeds from which butter, similar to shea butter, is extracted. This butter, so far insufficiently known, is obtained traditionally by a poorly documented process. Based on a technological investigation in the rural area and a factorial <b>correspondences</b> <b>analysis</b> (FCA), this study contributes to a better knowledge of the traditional technology of the P. butyracea butter production in Benin. P. butyracea butter is extracted by twelve main successive unit operations. The transformers involved in the butter production belong to eight different ethnic groups. Two types of thermal pretreatments, namely cooking with water and roasting in a traditional furnace are applied to P. butyracea seeds. The influence of the ethnic group was reported, especially {{on the type of}} the thermal pretreatment applied to the seeds as well as the various unit operations of transformation implemented from fruit picking up to obtaining butter.
