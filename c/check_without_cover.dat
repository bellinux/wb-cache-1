The removal of moisture percentage was measuredo every four days of interval during storage. The evaporation rate (gm/d) of dahi samples was also calculated by how much amount of water was removed per day during storage. The removal of moisture percentage and evaporation rate (g/d) of dahi samples of with cover group was lower than that of dahi samples of <b>without</b> <b>cover</b> group and evaporation rate of dahi samples of both with <b>cover</b> and <b>without</b> <b>cover</b> group was increased gradually due to incorporation of banana juice.
