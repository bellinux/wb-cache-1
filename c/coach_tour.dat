5|$|Following the {{unsuccessful}} tour to South Africa in 1964, the WRU set up {{a working}} party on coaching. The party recommended that Welsh clubs accept the principle of coaching. David Nash was appointed as the national team's first coach in 1967, but for the 1968 tour of Argentina, the WRU initially planned {{not to have a}} <b>coach</b> <b>tour</b> with the team. Following pressure from the Welsh clubs at the WRU's annual general meeting, the decision was reversed and Clive Rowlands was appointed as coach for the tour. The appointing of a coach for the team coincided with Wales' success in the Five Nations during the 1970s.|$|E

5000|$|Task Review: Tenacity {{arranged}} for their <b>coach</b> <b>tour</b> to visit Blenheim Palace and Oxford and charged high prices for their tickets, {{with the team}} focusing on low costs, which were helped further by Mark's negotiations securing them good discounts at their sites. Their customers gave good feedback on their <b>coach</b> <b>tour,</b> thanks to Lauren's exceptional tour of Blenheim, offsetting both Felipe's rather mediocre tour in Oxford and the substandard refreshments they offered. Meanwhile, Summit {{arranged for}} their <b>coach</b> <b>tour</b> to visit Hever Castle and Canterbury and focused on offering low ticket prices, though had trouble securing discounts as James pushed for one that one site would not agree with. Their <b>coach</b> <b>tour</b> proved to be disastrously bad; despite offering good refreshments, traffic delayed their start, James forced a sing-along upon their customers, Jemma was ill-prepared for the tour of the castle, and the group got lost in Canterbury, cutting their visit to their second site. These mistakes effectively wrecked any chance of the team securing a win.|$|E
