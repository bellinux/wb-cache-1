40|$|AbstractThe billet was {{prepared}} {{by putting the}} aluminum bar into the silver tube, and the silver clad aluminum wire was fabricated through cold hydrostatic extrusion and subsequent drawing. The effects of annealing parameters on the interface and properties of the wires were investigated. The results showed that when the annealing temperature was below 150 °C and annealing time was less than 30 min, no new phase was observed obviously, while new phase could be observed {{when the temperature reached}} above 200 °C. The results of energy spectrum analysis showed that new phase were mainly Ag 3 Al electronic compound (μ phase) which was hard brittle phase with the β-Mn structure. The effects of annealing temperature and time on the interface were different: for any annealing time in this study, the width of the interface rose markedly with the increase of annealing temperature, while annealing time had no significant effect on the width of interface when the temperature was low. Only when the temperature was comparatively high, the increment rate of width of the interface gradually increased with the rise of annealing time. The width of interfaces was 5 ∼ 7 μm, 7 ∼ 9 μm and 10 ∼ 12 μm after annealing treatment under the temperature of 150 °C, 200 °C and 300 °C respectively for 30 minutes. If the annealing temperature was lower than 200 °C, the main way was that silver diffused towards aluminum, but when the annealing temperature was up to 300 °C, the reverse diffusion occurred. When annealing temperature was 150 °C or 200 °C, the tensile strength of <b>composite</b> <b>wire</b> decreased after increased with the increment of annealing time, while when it was 300 °C, the tensile strength always increased.
