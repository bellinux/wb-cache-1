25|$|Cesare Angelotti {{had been}} a wealthy {{landowner}} in Naples and defender of the short-lived Neapolitan Republic. When it fell to the British forces and Ferdinand IV was returned as ruler, he fled to Rome where {{he became one of}} the Consuls of the equally short lived Roman Republic. He is a wanted man, not only for his revolutionary activities but also for a youthful dalliance in London, where he had an eight-day liaison with Emma Hamilton. In those days she {{had been a}} prostitute going by the name of Emma Lyon, but by the time of the play she had become the wife of the British Envoy to Naples, William Hamilton, and was a favourite of Queen Maria Carolina. Determined to avoid a scandal, the Queen demanded that he be returned to Naples and hanged. He was languishing in Rome's Castel Sant'Angelo, when his sister Giulia, the Marquise Attavanti, helped him to escape. According to historian Susan Vandiver Nicassio, Angelotti was partly based on Liborio Angelucci, who had briefly been a Consul of the Roman Republic, although the resemblance in terms of their life histories ends there. Another influence on the <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>surname</b> may have been Nicola Antonio Angeletti (1791–1870), a prominent Italian revolutionary and member of the Carbonari.|$|E

25|$|The Portuguese {{system of}} {{differentiation}} for the noble non-Royal families is {{unlike any other}} cadency system. It {{is true that the}} bruiser personalises the arms, however, since the Portuguese have an arbitrary <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>surnames,</b> they may select any family name from the father's or mother's side of their genealogical table and a coat of arms, which does not have to coincide with it. Thus, the system of differencing only serves to show from which ancestral line the arms are derived. The head of the lineage uses the arms without a difference, but should he be the head of more than one family, the arms are combined by quartering. The heir apparent to the arms of the head of a lineage never uses a mark of difference.|$|R

However, Judith Martin calls response cards [...] "vulgar", as they imply the guest would not reply without being prompted to do so.

50|$|Three minor {{characters}} in La Tosca are real historical figures: Queen Maria Carolina; Prince Diego Naselli, the Governor of Rome; and the composer, Giovanni Paisiello. However, their {{treatment in the}} play is not always historically accurate. On the day the play takes place, Queen Maria Carolina was actually {{on her way to}} Austria and staying in Livorno, not Rome. Paisiello was a Neapolitan court composer, but {{at the time of the}} play he was under suspicion for anti-Royalist sympathies, making him a highly unlikely candidate for Maria Carolina's gathering in Act 2. According to Deborah Burton, another minor character, Princesse Orlonia, is probably based on Princess Torlonia. Although their names and backgrounds contain historical allusions, the four main protagonists, Cesare Angelotti, Mario Cavaradossi, Floria Tosca, and Baron Scarpia are fictional. Their backgrounds are revealed in the conversations between Angelotti and Cavaradossi in Acts 1 and 3.Cesare Angelotti had been a wealthy landowner in Naples and defender of the short-lived Neapolitan Republic. When it fell to the British forces and Ferdinand IV was returned as ruler, he fled to Rome where he became one of the Consuls of the equally short lived Roman Republic. He is a wanted man, not only for his revolutionary activities but also for a youthful dalliance in London, where he had an eight-day liaison with Emma Hamilton.

40|$|In {{this article}} I {{want to address}} more {{directly}} and extensively than previous studies why Bob Dylan chose his stage name. There are three contexts which allow us to arrive at an answer: the first, {{for which there is}} a good deal of evidence; the second, more speculative; and the third, evaluative. The article puts forward the proposition that Bob Dylan’s <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>surname</b> was motivated by the pervasive mythology and enviable cultural capital of Dylan Thomas in the years after his death in 1953. The first question to be addressed is {{why would anyone want to}} adopt the name Dylan in the late 1950 s. Second, attention focuses on Robert Zimmerman in particular and asks why he, given the broader context of the Welshman’s cultural capital, decided to take Dylan Thomas’s Christian name as his surname. The third context is that of poetry and the influence Thomas had upon Bob Dylan’s work. I suggest that Robert Zimmerman’s choice was not because he was influenced by the poetry itself...|$|E
40|$|With {{its origins}} in sociological debates about individualisation, {{personalisation}} and the transformation of intimacy, this research explores the long-neglected subject of the surnames of married women. Drawing on in-depth biographical interviews with 30 married or once-married women, respondents are found to engage in complex negotiations with cultural assumptions about wifehood, motherhood and the family when called to change surnames upon marriage. Through their interviews, women account for their surname ‘choice’ via a range of, often-contradictory, discourses – thereby identifying marital naming as an issue of tension and struggle for wives, {{as well as for}} women considering marriage. Their ‘talk’ frequently calls upon debates of social stability and change, as well as ideas of autonomy and connectedness. Overall, their narratives speak of social control and a dominant institutional structure in life – and women either accepted the norms of naming or dealt with the consequences. This finding was underscored by the responses of 453 people to a street survey. For interviewees, the opposing role of surnames in marking out both individual identity and social connections led to conflicts. Relational identities were often placed in opposition to autonomy. Yet, women more frequently positioned themselves as interdependent negotiators rather than autonomous agents. For interviewees, surname ‘choices’ were imbued with social meanings and were not rated equally – their <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>surname</b> either ‘displayed’ that they were ‘doing gender well’ or ‘doing gender poorly’. However, discussions of gender were largely absent or neutralised in the interviewees’ accounts, while women who kept their maiden names spoke about feeling the need to silence their naming decision. The research concludes that marital naming forms part of women’s exhaustive efforts at ‘relationship work’. Married women were accountable for their surnames as assumptions of marital naming were found to pervade notions about wifehood. Whatever surname an interviewee decided upon, she was responsible for conducting a gendered and classed performance, and her surname ‘choices’ involved both personal sacrifices and gains...|$|E
40|$|This Article {{provides}} {{the first comprehensive}} legal analysis of parents' rights to name their own children. Currently, state laws restrict parental naming rights {{in a number of}} ways, from restrictions on particular surnames, to restrictions on diacritical marks, to prohibitions on obscenities, numerals, and pictograms. Yet state laws do not prohibit seemingly horrific names like "Adolf Hitler," the name recently given to a New Jersey boy. This Article argues that state laws restricting parental naming rights are subject to strict scrutiny under both the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment. This Article concludes that although many restrictions are constitutional, prohibitions on diacritical marks, such as that employed by the state of California, are uncon stitutional. If parents wish to name their child "Lućia" or "Jośe," they have a constitutional right to do so. Similarly, current laws restricting parental <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>surnames</b> fail strict scrutiny review. This Article also considers the constitutionality and desirability of statutory reforms that would address certain harmful names not prohibited by current law...|$|R
40|$|The {{mating pattern}} in a {{population}} determines the next generation gene pool and therefore its genetic structure. Besides socio-cultural and geographic factors, political barriers may influence the formation of couples. The present paper studies how the change of national border affected the mating pattern of Olivenza in Badajoz Province (Spain), which experienced a change of domain from Portugal to Spain in 1801. For the period analysed (17501850), 954 Catholic marriage records were transcribed. Data were sorted by decades {{in order to make}} a temporal study possible and analysed by means of diversity and repeated-pairs <b>of</b> <b>surnames.</b> Following the change of border the mating pattern modified. Coinciding with a larger number of mixed marriages with Spaniards, there was a progressive rise in the diversity <b>of</b> <b>surnames.</b> From 1811 to 1820 the analysis <b>of</b> repeated-pairs <b>of</b> <b>surnames</b> indicates the existence of preferential matings within Spanish and Portuguese lineages. After 1821 the above pattern became less clear due to the disappearance of the SpanishPortuguese restrictions on <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> mate...|$|R
