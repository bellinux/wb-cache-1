50|$|Prebaked anodes {{are divided}} into {{graphitized}} and coke types. For manufacturing of the graphitized anodes, anthracite and petroleum coke are calcined and classified. They are then mixed with <b>coal-tar</b> <b>pitch</b> and pressed. The pressed green anode is then baked at 1200 °C and graphitized. Coke anodes are made of calcined petroleum coke, recycled anode butts, and <b>coal-tar</b> <b>pitch</b> (binder). The anodes are manufactured by mixing aggregates with coal tar pitch to form a paste with a doughy consistency. This material is most often vibro-compacted but in some plants pressed. The green anode is then sintered at 1100-1200 °C for 300-400 hours, without graphitization, to increase its strength through decomposition and carbonization of the binder. Higher baking temperatures increase the mechanical properties and thermal conductivity, and decrease the air and CO2 reactivity. The specific electrical resistance of the coke-type anodes is {{higher than that of}} the graphitized ones, but they have higher compressive strength and lower porosity.|$|E

In this study, the interaction mechanisms of pitch and coke at the mixing stage were studied by a sessile-drop test using two <b>coal-tar</b> <b>pitches</b> as the liquid and three petroleum cokes as the substrate. The results showed that the coke–pitch interactions are related to both pitch and coke chemical compositions. The contact angle of different coke–pitch systems decreased with increasing time and temperature. At high temperatures, decreasing the pitch viscosity facilitated the spreading of pitch and its penetration into the coke bed. The chemical behavior of petroleum cokes and coal tar pitches were studied using the FT-IR spectroscopy and XPS.

40|$|Marine borers, {{particularly}} the shipworms, as destroyers of timber, par excellence, {{are well known}} from very ancient times. They attacked the wooden hulls of ships with such intensity that the weakened bottom planks broke up even due to a mild impact caused by hitting a rock or any floating objects inducing shipwrecks. Even the survival of sunken ships as wrecks depends on the mercy of wood-destroying organisms, which may turn these ‘port-holes’ to history into meaningless junks. The silent saboteurs, involved in several early shipwrecks, are the molluscan and crustacean borers, aided by bacteria and fungi. This paper presents {{an account of the}} marine wood-borers, together with a historical review of literature on their depredation on wooden ships, and on protective methods adopted from antiquity to modern times. The seriousness with which early mariners faced the problem of bio-deterioration and the fear the wood-borers created in their minds have been brought to light with, in some cases, excerpts from their journals and books. The anxiety and concern for protecting the ships from the ravages of wood-borers and for their own safety, as evidenced from their accounts, are discussed. Classification of various groups of marine wood-borers with notes on characters of systematic value and a complete list of species so far recorded in literature have been included under Appendix I and II. Methods employed to prevent damage to the boats included deep-charring, coating with <b>pitch,</b> <b>coal-tar,</b> whale oil and mustard oil with lime; scupper nailing (‘filling’); sheathing with animal skin, hair, tarred paper, wooden boards (untreated or soaked in coal tar, Ferrous sulphate, Copper sulphate or Lead monoxide); sheathing with metals (Lead or Copper sheets); plastic, neoprene coated ply-woods; and painting with Copper oxide, Pentachlorophenol or phenylarsenious oxide. None of these imparts complete protection. Recent archaeological investigations carried out in British waters, especially on ‘Mary Rose’, are also summarised. It is suggested that, though borers are instrumental in inducing ship-wrecks thereby enriching the materials for archaeological studies, excavations at known ship-wreck sites should be augmented to unearth valuable historical data, before they are lost to satisfy the insatiable appetite of these pests...|$|R

This trap was able to throw the targets from 28 to 35 yards. It was operated by a person behind the shooter, who pulled a string and released an elastic spring resulting in the target to be launched. The first automatic trap machine (to launch clay targets) was used in 1909. Following the invention of the automatic trap machines, doubles trap was introduced. It was a big success in the competition community. In the 1912 Olympics, Jay Graham became the first American to win the gold medal in doubles trap.|$|E

40|$|International audienceSince tens of years, sulphur {{is a very}} {{classical}} additive in {{the composition}} of black ceramics because, if added in small amounts (i. e., less than 10 wt. % of the binder), it improves their mechanical properties without strongly degrading their graphitability and their conductivity. Macroscopic properties of black ceramics strongly depend {{on the quality of the}} interfaces between grains of solid filler (graphite, carbon black) and coke originating from the pyrolysis of the binder; thus, the binder should correctly wet the filler prior to the carbonisation process. <b>Coal-tar</b> <b>pitch</b> usually exhibits a high affinity for carbon grains. In the present work, the effect of the amount of sulphur on the viscosity of the molten binder and on the way it wets the solid filler was investigated. For that purpose, the penetration of mixtures of <b>coal-tar</b> <b>pitch</b> and sulphur inside a bed of carbon particles was studied as a function of temperature. The influence of the sulphur content on composition, optical texture, and transport properties of the derived black ceramics, as well as the way it was mixed with the other constituents, were also examined. It was found that the preparation of black ceramics may be achieved easily and in safe conditions, without evolution of H 2 S, using pitch–sulphur mixtures first molten in a bladed mixer, and having sulphur contents within the range 10 – 20 wt. %. The presence of sulphur increases the coke yield but lowers the ability to graphitise, thus limiting the transport properties of the resultant black ceramic.

Some PAH are carcinogenic, and activities such as furnace maintenance may thus represent a risk to workers. Occupational exposure during these operations should therefore be assessed. Methods: In this study, the PAH-related carcinogenic risk associated with furnace maintenance was assessed by monitoring atmospheric levels of benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), a representative marker, alongside urinary levels of 3 -hydroxybenzo[a]pyrene (3 -OHBaP), one of its metabolites. PAH exposure levels were monitored during seven sampling campaigns in four different factories specialized in heat-treatment of mechanical workpieces for the automotive and helicopter industries. Two types of furnace were studied, and 37 individuals were monitored. Results: Values up to 20 -fold the French regulatory value of 150 ng/m 3 for atmospheric BaP, and, for urinary 3 -OHBaP values up to 40 -fold the French biological limit value (BLV) of 0. 35 nmol/mol of creatinine were detected. Very high concentrations of BaP, close to or even exceeding those found in <b>coal-tar</b> <b>pitch</b> (up to about 20 g/kg), were measured in residues (tars, dusts) deposited inside the furnace. Even when adequate and suitable personal protective equipment was used, urinary 3 -OHBaP values often exceeded the BLV. We hypothesize that this exposure is linked to insidious and fortuitous dermal contamination through contact with factory equipment and staining...|$|E
40|$|Carbon {{molecular}} sieves (CMS) and zeolites {{are widely used}} as microporous sieving solids for gas and liquid separations. However, due to hydrophobicity, better thermal stability, and neutrality in both acidic and alkaline media, CMSs have definite advantages over zeolites. In the present work. an effort {{has been made to}} develop suitable process conditions for synthesizing CMSs from the locally available bituminous coal. The coal was crushed, milled. and agglomerated with sulfate pulp waste liquor (SPWL) or <b>coal-tar</b> <b>pitch</b> (CTP) as the binders, and then carbonized in nitrogen atmosphere at 800 -degrees-C for about 60 minutes. In order to narrow down the pore mouth sizes. acetylene and benzene were each cracked separately at 800 -degrees-C to facilitate the deposition of coke on the char. Acetylene and benzene were cracked for 3 to 10 minutes, and 10 to 30 minutes. respectively. Acetylene cracked samples did not show good separation, probably because of over-coking in deeper locations. In contrast. benzene cracked samples were found to be highly suitable for CO 2 -CH 4 separation. The best result (i. e., uptake ratio of 39. 9) was obtained for feed benzene entrainment in N 2 of 1. 27 x 10 (- 4) g/ml, cracking time of 30 minutes, and this ratio was more than 10 times that of non-cocked sample. CMS samples produced using, SPWL as binder showed poor O 2 /N 2 uptake ratios throughout (1 to 1. 5), whereas samples with CTP as binder showed far more encouraging results, the best uptake ratio being 5. 5 for benzene-nitrogen feed stream containing 3. 508 x 10 (- 4) g/ml benzene and 5 minutes cracking time. This ratio is about 5. 5 times more than that of uncoked sample...|$|E
