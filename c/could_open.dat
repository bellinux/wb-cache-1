5|$|During {{the initial}} {{development}} {{stages of the}} film, Pixar revisited their work from the original Toy Story and found that, although they <b>could</b> <b>open</b> the old computer files for the animated 3D models, error messages prevented them from editing the files. This necessitated recreating the models from scratch. To create the chaotic and complex junkyard scene near the film's end, {{more than a year}} and a half was invested on research and development to create the simulation systems required for the sequence.|$|E
5|$|Finless {{porpoises}} have commonly {{been kept}} in Japan, {{as well as}} China and Indonesia. Ninety four in total have been in captivity in Japan, eleven in China, {{and at least two}} in Indonesia. Japan has had three establishments designated for breeding them, and there have been five recorded births. Three calves died moments after their birth, but two survived for several years. This breeding success proved that porpoises can be successfully bred in captivity, and this <b>could</b> <b>open</b> up new conservation options.|$|E
5|$|In 1961, {{she came}} to Singapore {{to live with her}} older sister, Ursula, late {{principal}} of the Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus in Bukit Timah. On seeing her dedication and commitment in helping the poor and sick, Ursula bought her a 0.6-hectare piece of land at Jalan Payoh Lai in 1965, so that Hsu <b>could</b> <b>open</b> the first home for the aged sick in Singapore. The two sisters ran the Home for the Aged Sick for five years. Ursula financed its operations with her pay, while Hsu managed it and made some extra cash by selling the harvest of 10 coconut trees and a dozen banana trees in the backyard.|$|E

5|$|In 1999, NASA {{contracted}} Emerson {{to build}} a knife for use on Space Shuttle missions and the International Space Station. Rather than design a new model from scratch, NASA chose an existing model which already met their specifications, with one additional design requirement. The model is a folding version of the Specwar knife that Emerson had designed for Timberline {{with the addition of}} a guthook cut into the tantō point of the blade with which astronauts <b>could</b> <b>open</b> their freeze dried food packages. The knife is not available for purchase outside of NASA.|$|E
5|$|Just {{two and a}} {{half months}} later, though, the MTA stated that it was unable to open the subway {{extension}} for service until April to July 2015, due to the failure to get the inclined elevators to work properly. Problems with the security and fire alarm systems were also blamed for the delays. A December 2014 New York Post article attributed the delay to Hudson Yards' developer, The Related Companies', need to dig caissons for the foundations, just above the subway station, and the foundation work needed to be complete before the MTA <b>could</b> <b>open</b> the station. Continuing trouble with the fire and security alarms in March 2015 would delay the opening until summer.|$|E
5|$|On February 24, 2016, the MTA {{allocated}} $66 {{million to}} speed up the construction of the first phase so that it <b>could</b> <b>open</b> in December. However, by June, the project was not being built at a rate that would allow a December 2016 completion. Concerns about the line's timely opening persisted through October and November, with key systems such as elevators, escalators, and fire alarms not having been tested. The third rail was energized and test trains began running through the new line on October 9, 2016, with weights to simulate rush hour loads; non-revenue Q trains, taken out of service at 57th Street–Seventh Avenue, started running through the subway in November 2016.|$|E

5|$|Ship's {{regulations}} {{were designed to}} keep third class passengers confined to their area of the ship. The Titanic was fitted with grilles to prevent the classes from mingling and these gates were normally kept closed, although the stewards <b>could</b> <b>open</b> them {{in the event of}} an emergency. In the rush following the collision, the stewards, occupied with waking up sleeping passengers and leading groups of women and children to the boat deck, did not have time to open all the gates, leaving many of the confused third class passengers stuck below decks.|$|E
5|$|In 1914 Elba was {{converted}} {{into the first}} dedicated seaplane tender in the Italian fleet. She was nevertheless {{too small to be}} of real use, and she remained in service for only two years. Puglia was the only ship of the class to {{take an active role in}} the First World War; in 1915, while patrolling off Durazzo she briefly encountered the Austro-Hungarian cruiser , which retreated before either ship <b>could</b> <b>open</b> fire. She covered the withdrawal of elements of the Serbian Army from Durazzo and shelled the pursuing Austro-Hungarian Army. Etruria was deliberately blown up in Livorno on 13 August 1918 to fool Austria-Hungary into believing its espionage network, which had been thoroughly compromised, was still operational. Elba was sold for scrapping in January 1920, followed by her sister Lombardia in July. That month, Puglia became involved in the civil unrest in Split, and the ship's captain and another sailor were murdered by a group of Croat nationalists. Liguria was sold in May 1921 and broken up. The Navy sold Puglia in March 1923, but while she was being dismantled Benito Mussolini donated her bow section to the Vittoriale degli italiani museum.|$|E
5|$|Shion is {{aboard the}} Woglinde running tests on KOS-MOS when the crew {{pick up a}} Zohar Emulator, one of {{thirteen}} replicas of the Zohar. Cherenkov monitors her progress, {{but at the same}} time is a U-TIC spy furthering their goal of finding the original Zohar. Following the Zohar Emulator's retrieval, the Woglinde is attacked by Gnosis. KOS-MOS self-activates and protects Shion's team, in the process killing Federation officer Luis Virgil with friendly fire to save Shion and her assistant Allen. KOS-MOS brings them along with Cherenkov on board the Elsa, which is heading to their destination of Second Miltia. When a Gnosis attacks, chaos' ability to dispel them saves Cherenkov's life. The attack begins mutating Cherenkov, tormenting him with visions of his past as a soldier who failed to adjust to civilian life and killed many people including his wife. During these periods, Shion becomes concerned that KOS-MOS is displaying aberrant behavior, and Allen worries about Shion's emotional state. Alongside these events, the cyborg Ziggy is dispatched to rescue the Realian MOMO from U-TIC, as data stored inside her <b>could</b> <b>open</b> the way to the original planet Miltia, lost in a disaster for which her creator Joachim Mizrahi is blamed. Ziggy rescues MOMO and narrowly escapes, fending off attacks by Margulis. Albedo, who is working with U-TIC for his own goals, sets out in pursuit of MOMO.|$|E

5|$|The fleet {{returned}} to waters off Okinawa on 4 May and renewed its {{attacks on the}} airfields on the Sakishima Islands. Vice-Admiral Bernard Rawlings, second {{in command of the}} BPF, and his staff had determined that bombardment of Japanese gun positions by the heavy guns of battleships and cruisers might be a more effective method of destroying them than aerial attack. They detached King George V and Howe, as well as five cruisers, that morning to bombard Nobara and Hiara airfields while fighters flew a protective CAP over them and spotted the fall of their shells. The loss of the most effective anti-aircraft ships was more important than anticipated and the Japanese were {{able to take advantage of}} the opportunity. The carrier had just launched two Corsairs for bombardment-spotting duties and the deck park of eleven Avengers was being moved forward to allow aircraft to land when an undetected Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighter attacked at 11:31. The Zero first strafed the flight deck before any of Formidables guns <b>could</b> <b>open</b> fire and then turned sharply to dive into the forward flight deck despite the ship's hard turn to starboard. The fighter released a bomb shortly before it would have impacted the deck and was destroyed by the bomb's blast, although the remnants of the Zero struck Formidable.|$|E
5|$|The next {{bridge to}} be {{constructed}} {{at the site}} was an 860-foot (262-meter) steel girder bridge, the third to be named for Cullen. Its first span opened in 1965, and it was widened by the addition in 1976 of a second span slightly {{to the west of}} the first one, the newer span carrying southbound traffic while the older span became one-way northbound. When the first span opened in 1965, the inlet was 23 feet (7 meters) deep, but inlet currents led to scouring of the piers of the bridge, first noticed in the 1980s. By the late 1980s, scouring was severe enough to allow U.S. Army Corps of Engineers divers to swim beneath one of the span's concrete footings. The Corps installed protective riprap around the bridge piers in 1989, but this was only a temporary solution; realizing that the bridge could be compromised by damage from just one severe storm, Delaware officials listed it as structurally deficient and requiring replacement. Scouring had increased the inlet's depth to over 100 feet (30 meters) by 1999, leading the Corps of Engineers and Delaware officials to question the stability of the pilings and their protective riprap. By 2005, various reports gave the bridge an expected lifespan of three to five years and estimated that it would have to be closed sometime between 2008 and 2011 and would collapse sometime between 2008 and 2013. By 2007, the bridge carried 14,000 cars on an average day and an average of 28,000 cars per day during the summer months, and the disruption to traffic if the bridge had to be closed before a replacement <b>could</b> <b>open</b> was of increasing concern.|$|E
