50|$|The {{conventional}} way {{to increase}} turnout speeds is to lengthen the turnout and use a shallower frog angle. If the frog angle is so shallow that a fixed frog cannot support a train's wheels, a swingnose crossing (US: moveable point frog) will be used. Higher speeds are possible without lengthening the turnout by using uniformly <b>curved</b> <b>rail</b> and a very low entry angle; however, wider track centers may be needed.|$|E
50|$|More recently, some <b>curved</b> <b>rails</b> {{have been}} {{produced}} to a modular design so components can be unbolted and used elsewhere, subject to design and safety considerations. In some cases, tubular section rails which are welded during manufacture, are produced by specialist rail companies {{so they can be}} used with a pre-owned carriage, controls, and other components. This is, perhaps, like putting an old locomotive on new railway lines. It provides a lower cost solution than buying a totally new system.|$|R

5000|$|With both tram {{and train}} wheels, this happens {{naturally}} because the tires are cone shaped sloping surfaces: the inside diameter {{is a few}} millimeters larger than the outside. As the track starts to curve, the train tries to run straight. The wheel flange presses {{against the side of}} the <b>curved</b> <b>rail</b> so the [...] "contact point" [...] between rail and wheel moves a few millimeters outwards, making the effective diameter of the outer wheel temporarily larger, and equally opposite: the effective diameter of the inner wheel effectively becomes temporarily smaller. This technique works well on large-radius curves which are canted, but not as well on tight curves and railway switches (also known as [...] "points"). This is because the geometry or cant of the track is more difficult to optimize for every possible combination of vehicle and direction of travel.|$|E
5000|$|Drag Extraction is {{the lightest}} and {{simplest}} egress system available, {{and has been}} used on many experimental aircraft. Halfway between simply [...] "bailing out" [...] and using explosive-eject systems, Drag Extraction uses the airflow past the aircraft (or spacecraft) to move the aviator out of the cockpit {{and away from the}} stricken craft on a guide rail. Some operate like a standard ejector seat, by jettisoning the canopy, then deploying a drag chute into the airflow. That chute pulls the occupant out of the aircraft, either with the seat or following release of the seat straps, who then rides off the end of a rail extending far enough out to help clear the structure. In the case of the Space Shuttle, the astronauts would have ridden a long, <b>curved</b> <b>rail,</b> blown by the wind against their bodies, then deployed their chutes after free-falling to a safe altitude.|$|E

After reviewing some microscopic and macroscopic experimental evidence, a physically-based phenomenological model using four internal state tensor variables is presented. This model can be simplified into several classical phenomenological models in order to take into account either the isotropic or the kinematic hardening or both. The implementation of the proposed models in the in-house finite element code DD 3 IMP is briefly recalled.

40|$|To {{provide stable}} and {{high data rate}} {{wireless}} access for passengers in the train, {{it is necessary to}} properly deploy base stations along the railway. We consider this issue from the perspective of service, which is defined as the integral of the time-varying instantaneous channel capacity. With large-scale fading assumption, it will be shown that the total service of each base station is inversely proportional to the velocity of the train. Besides, we find that if the ratio of the service provided by a base station in its service region to its total service is given, the base station interval (i. e. the distance between two adjacent base stations) is a constant regardless of the velocity of the train. On the other hand, if a certain amount of service is required, the interval will increase with the velocity of the train. The above results apply not only to simple <b>curve</b> <b>rails,</b> like line rail and arc rail, but also to any irregular <b>curve</b> <b>rail,</b> provided that the train is travelling at a constant velocity. Furthermore, the new developed results are applied to analyze the on-off transmission strategy of base stations.

40|$|A tribologist’s {{dream is}} to predict {{the point at which}} a {{lubricant}} film will fail. The precursor to this ideal situation is to predict the decay behaviour of a lubricant film prior to failure. The performance decay of lubricants is of interest to the rail industry for two reasons; first, to predict reapplication rates, and second, to predict the lubricated distance from a lubricant application point. The work discussed in this paper investigated the failure of lubricant films in a simulated <b>rail</b> <b>curve</b> environment. Three <b>rail</b> <b>curve</b> lubricants were tested under traction-limited rolling sliding conditions. New methods for measurement of <b>rail</b> <b>curve</b> lubricant performance were developed and one method, the half life of lubricant is discussed and results presented here. Lubricant half life in this work represents the reduction of sliding performance over time at a defined shear stress level or the time taken for a lubricant to lose half of its sliding performance. Decay of lubricant performance was measured for three different <b>rail</b> <b>curve</b> lubricants under simulated conditions. The rail/wheel simulator used in this research consists o...|$|R
40|$|The gradient-square tensor {{describes}} the orientation {{dependence of the}} squared directional derivative in images. The ratio of eigenvalues {{is a measure of}} local anisotropy. For an area showing shift invariance along some orientation (think of a piece of straight rail track) one of the tensor eigenvalues is zero. In practical situations (think of a piece of <b>curved</b> <b>rail</b> track) rotation invariance (perhaps around a remote center) occurs more often than shift invariance. Then curvature contributes to the smallest eigenvalue. In order to avoid this we deform a local area {{in such a way that}} the rotational symmetry becomes a translational one. Next the gradient square tensor, defined on the transformed area, is expressed in derivatives of the original area. A curvature corrected anisotropy measure is defined. The correction turns out to be simple and straightforward. An average-curvature estimate for the area results as a valuable byproduct. 1...|$|E

40|$|AbstractA {{calculation}} model is put forward {{to analyze the}} effect of a scratch on the running surface of a <b>curved</b> <b>rail</b> on initiation and growth of plastic deformation induced rail corrugation when a wheelset is steadily and repeatedly curving. The numerical method considers a combination of Carter’s two-dimensional contact theory, a two-dimensional elastic–plastic finite element model and a vertical dynamics model of railway vehicle coupled with a curved track. A concept of feedback between the corrugation development and the vertical coupling dynamics of the wheelset and track is involved. The cyclic ratchetting effect of the rail material under repeated contact loadings is taken into account. The numerical results indicate that when a vehicle runs on rails with a scratch the contact vibration between the wheel and rail occurs at large amplitude, and rail corrugation due to plastic deformation initiates and develops. The corrugation has a tendency to move along the running direction and its evolution rate decays as wheelset passages increase. The passing frequencies of the plastic deformation induced corrugation depend on the natural frequencies of the track. The residual stresses stabilize after a limited number of wheelset passages. The residual strains increase at a reduced rate with increasing wheelset passages...|$|E
40|$|Wear of {{railroad}} rolling stock and rails costs {{millions of dollars}} each year in all rail systems throughout the world. The rail industry has attempted to address flange wear using lubricants. The choice of <b>rail</b> <b>curve</b> lubricant is currently not based on a standards approach.

The equipment used to measure <b>rail</b> <b>curve</b> lubricant performance consists of two dissimilar disks, of matching contact profile, rotating in contact with one another.

40|$|In most {{rail wheel}} contact cases, {{especially}} on <b>curved</b> <b>rail</b> tracks, additional stresses {{occur in the}} rail due to potential centrifugal force and cant deficiency. The localised high stress generated on the rail gauge corner of the outer rail region could potentially cause fatigue crack initiation. The {{aim of this study}} is to examine the rail gauge corner of the outer rail region influenced by the lateral (L) and vertical (V) rail wheel contact loads and the contact position. The longitudinal bending stresses in the rail under head radius position are of special interest as tension spikes were found at this location in the field measurements. The study was undertaken by the finite element method (FEM) with a static stress analysis. The analysis revealed that the longitudinal stress at the rail gauge corner of the outer rail region is highly dependent on two factors: the offset of the contact patch location from the rail centreline and the L/V ratio. The peak tensile stress is increased, but the depth below the contact surface at which the stresses become tensile is reduced when increasing the offset of contact patch location and L/V ratio. Both these enhance the tendency for rolling contact fatigue cracks to turn downwards into transverse defects. This is because an increase in tensile bending stresses together with both residual and thermally induced stresses can facilitate crack growth once the crack has reached a critical length...|$|E
40|$|Rolling contact fatigue (RCF) is {{currently}} {{one of the}} principal limitations of railway infrastructure productivity. Head checks in particular are prevalent in curves and switches where flange contact at the gauge corner results in increased slip and decreased wheel-rail contact area. These surface-initiated cracks can lead to complete failure of the rail and potentially derailment. The focus of the EU Fifth Framework project InfraStar is on improving the durability and lifetime of the rail along stretches of track with narrow and moderate radius curve, high-traffic volumes and high axle loads by applying a surface coating to the railhead. The main goal of the project is to develop a railhead with an additional surface layer (the InfraStar two-material rail) which prevents RCF and reduces noise emissions in narrow-radius <b>curved</b> <b>rail.</b> Results are presented here from twin-disc laboratory testing and metallurgical analysis of specimens with the two selected new surface materials. The effects of lubrication, applied load and coating thickness were studied. An eddy current probe was used for crack detection. Both materials survived 200, 000 cycles of water-lubricated twin-disc testing without crack formation, in contrast to UIC (260 grade) 900 A base material which showed severe cracking after only 4000 cycles. Metallurgical investigations show excellent RCF resistance, although one coating developed cracks quickly during water-lubricated testing after 15, 000 dry cycles, and bonding of the tested coatings (delamination occurred at the bonding interface of one coating during high-pressure tests) ...|$|E
