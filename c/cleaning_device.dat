25|$|The {{windshield}} wiper is a bladed device used to wipe rain and dirt from a windshield. In 1903, Mary Anderson {{is credited with}} inventing the first operational {{windshield wiper}}. In Anderson's patent, she called her invention a window <b>cleaning</b> <b>device</b> for electric cars and other vehicles. Operated via a lever from inside a vehicle, her version of windshield wipers closely resembles the windshield wiper found on many early car models. Anderson had a model of her design manufactured. She then filed a patent (U.S. patent number 743,801) on June 18, 1903 that was issued to her by the U.S. Patent Office on November 10, 1903.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} associations of lifestyle with dental health behaviors such as tooth brushing frequency, use of extra <b>cleaning</b> <b>devices,</b> and regular dental visits to a dentist. Methods: Data were collected from 1182 dentate residents 18 years of age or older who resided in a typical farming district. The data included data on the demographic factors, dental health behavior, and various aspects of lifestyle, i. e. mental condition, alcohol consumption, smoking habit, physical activity, social activity, dietary habits, and presence of systemic diseases. Results: Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that subjects in a younger group (18 â€“ 39 years of age) and subjects who had never smoked brushed their teeth more frequently. Experience of social volunteer work and presence of systemic disease were correlated with use of extra <b>cleaning</b> <b>devices.</b> Associations of female gender with frequency of tooth brushing and use of extra <b>cleaning</b> <b>devices</b> were weakly positive.

40|$|With the {{introduction}} of automatic milking (AM) systems, some increases in total bacterial count (TBC) and of free fatty acids (FFA) in milk were observed. Contamination of milk, resulting in elevated TBC, originates from four main sources: inside of the udder, outside of the udder, the milking machine and bulk tank. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the efficacy of teat <b>cleaning</b> <b>devices</b> and to study the effect on milk quality of two and three system cleanings per day. AM systems have special teat <b>cleaning</b> <b>devices.</b> The efficacy of these teat <b>cleaning</b> <b>devices</b> was studied by contaminating the teats first, followed by swabbing the teats before and after teat cleaning. Per brand of AM system on two farms were taken. The effect of system cleaning frequency was studied on 13 farms by performing two or three system cleanings per day. Milk quality was determined on bulk tank samples. All teat cleaning systems showed positive effects. Differences were found between brands of AM systems. The level of housing hygiene influenced the level of teat contamination. Three system cleanings per day resulted in a significant lower TBC (10. 000 vs. 13. 000 cfu/ml), number of coliforms, thermodurics and psychrotrophs compared with two system cleanings per day. In both cases the levels found for TBC were far within the penalty limits...|$|R
50|$|The {{trains are}} powered by three 1.5 V AA batteries, an {{optional}} AC adapter, or a USB plug. The {{direction of the}} train is changed by pressing a button.

50|$|A vacuum {{ceramic filter}} is {{designed}} to separate liquids from solids for dewatering purposes. The device consists of a rotator, slurry tank, ceramic filter plate, distributor, discharge scraper, <b>cleaning</b> <b>device,</b> frame, agitating device, pipe system, vacuum system, automatic acid dosing system, automatic lubricating system, valve and discharge chute. The operation and construction principle of vacuum ceramic filter resemble those of a conventional disc filter, but the filter medium {{is replaced by a}} finely porous ceramic disc. The disc material is inert, has a long operational life and is resistant to almost all chemicals. Performance can be optimized by taking into account all those factors which affect the overall efficiency of the separation process. Some of the variables affecting the performance of a vacuum ceramic filter include the solid concentration, speed rotation of the disc, slurry level in the feed basin, temperature of the feed slurry, and the pressure during dewatering stages and filter cake formation.|$|E
5000|$|The {{washboard}} and frottoir (from Cajun French [...] "frotter", to rub) {{are used}} as a percussion instrument, employing the ribbed metal surface of the <b>cleaning</b> <b>device</b> as a rhythm instrument. As traditionally used in jazz, zydeco, skiffle, jug band, and old-time music, the washboard remained in its wooden frame and is played primarily by tapping, but also scraping the washboard with thimbles. Often the washboard has additional traps, such as a wood block, a cowbell, and even small cymbals. Conversely, the frottoir (zydeco rubboard) dispenses with the frame and consists simply of the metal ribbing hung around the neck. It is played primarily with spoon handles or bottle openers in a combination of strumming, scratching, tapping and rolling. The frottoir or vest frottoir is played as a stroked percussion instrument, often in a band with a drummer, while the washboard generally is a replacement for drums. In Zydeco bands, the frottoir is usually played with bottle openers, to make a louder sound. It tends to play counter-rhythms to the drummer. In a jug band, the washboard can also be stroked with a single whisk broom and functions as the drums for the band, playing only on the back-beat for most songs, a substitute for a snare drum. In a four-beat measure, the washboard will stroke on the 2-beat and the 4-beat. Its best sound is achieved using a single steel-wire snare-brush or whisk broom. However, in a jazz setting, the washboard can also be played with thimbles on all fingers, tapping out much more complex rhythms, as in The Washboard Rhythm Kings, a full-sized band, and Newman Taylor Baker.|$|E

40|$|A major {{challenge}} commonly faced in reproductive studies of teleosts is to cost effectively and safely separate oocytes {{from one another}} and from surrounding ovarian tissue. This challenge is exacerbated when ovarian tissue has been chemically preserved. Using Platycephalus caeruleopunctatus, a platycephalid species found within oceanic waters along {{the east coast of}} Australia, as an example species, within this study we describe and assess the utility of an ultrasonic <b>cleaning</b> <b>device</b> to separate oocytes from preserved ovarian tissue. The ultrasonic <b>cleaning</b> <b>device</b> was observed to separate oocytes from the surrounding ovarian tissue within less than 80. min of treatment and had no deleterious effects on the number of oocytes present. Treatment within the ultrasonic <b>cleaning</b> <b>device</b> reduced oocyte diameters at a constant rate of 3. 9 Î¼m per hour among the samples tested. As the ultrasonic <b>cleaning</b> <b>device</b> was able to separate oocytes from connective tissue within 80. min, this observed rate of reduction in oocyte diameters is unlikely to be detected at the resolution at which oocytes are traditionally measured and is less than that reported to occur using alternate chemically derived methods to separate oocytes from preserved connective tissue. Following the assessment of using an ultrasonic <b>cleaning</b> <b>device</b> to separate oocytes from ovarian tissue for P. caeruleopunctatus, this technique has been successfully employed to separate oocytes from preserved ovarian tissue for a variety of other teleost species including Macquaria colonorum, Platycephalus longispinis and Ratabulus diversidens. The use of an ultrasonic <b>cleaning</b> <b>device</b> to separate oocytes from preserved ovarian tissue will increase the efficiency of future investigations into teleost reproductive biology and potentially in other fields of research where particle separation and analysis are required. 5 page(s...|$|E
