500|$|Jake {{attends a}} $10,000-a-seat fundraiser with Winnie, buying a seat for Gekko to {{facilitate}} a [...] "chance" [...] meeting. Gekko confronts Bretton {{about what he did}} to him and to KZI. Bretton replies that no one <b>cares</b> <b>what</b> Gekko thinks anymore. Gekko also bumps into Bud Fox, and they discuss their shared experience going to jail. Gekko follows Winnie outside, where she explains why she blames him for everything that went wrong, stemming from his affairs and her brother Rudy's suicide. Gekko claims he worked, from prison, to get the best therapists and even paid off a drug dealer to stop selling to Rudy, who died from an overdose. Winnie forgives him.|$|E
500|$|Between 2013 and 2016, Sheen {{starred in}} and {{produced}} Showtime's Masters of Sex. He and Lizzy Caplan portrayed the 1960s human sexuality pioneers Masters and Johnson; the series chronicled [...] "their unusual lives, romance and pop culture trajectory, which saw them {{go from a}} Midwestern teaching hospital to the cover of Time magazine and Johnny Carson's couch". David Sims of The Atlantic described Sheen's portrayal of Masters as [...] "an intensely honest and unsympathetic one" [...] while Sonia Saraiya of The A.V. Club said Sheen played the role [...] "so seamlessly it's hard to remember that there's a British actor there who has played flamboyant news personalities and prime ministers." [...] Sean T. Collins of The Observer described Masters as [...] "a singularly unappealing figure": [...] "It's not that Michael Sheen is bad in the role. On the contrary! Sheen's skill in playing Masters as an asshole who oscillates between headache-inducing self-repression and volcanic rage renders him unpleasant {{to spend more than}} two minutes with at a time." [...] Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter remarked: [...] "Masters has never been very likable. In fact, it's a testament to Sheen's performance — and Caplan's nuanced Johnson offsetting Masters — that anyone still <b>cares</b> <b>what</b> happens to Masters on a personal level." [...] He received a Golden Globe nomination for his performance in late 2013.|$|E

Colin McQuistan from The Huffington Post listed FEMM {{as one of their}} top six acts of 2016; McQuistan stated [...] "I'm talking about FEMM, a deceptively slick production from Japan featuring two very real humans Honey-B and W-Trouble (sigh) who claim to 'stand up for the rights of mannequins worldwide' (double sigh). But who <b>cares</b> <b>what</b> their shtick is; the music is super commercial, catchy and very cleverly written pop." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Lopez, she {{initially}} didn't want [...] "Jenny {{from the}} Block" [...] or [...] "All I Have" [...] {{to be released}} as singles from the album. She felt that the tracks were too similar to her previous singles such as [...] "Ain't It Funny" [...] and [...] "I'm Real"; {{she felt like she}} was [...] "visiting old territory". [...] "Those tracks were like a different era for me, and I didn't want people to perceive it like I'm just trying to capitalize on the same thing. But the record company was like, 'Who <b>cares</b> <b>what</b> they think, those are hits mama!'". Lopez, who stated she [...] "calls the shots", eventually agreed.|$|E
