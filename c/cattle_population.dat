We have genotyped 192 animals, representing 5 <b>cattle</b> <b>populations</b> of Ethiopia, with the Illumina Bovine 8 K SNP BeadChip. These include 1 Sanga (Danakil), 3 zebu (Borana, Arsi and Ambo), and 1 zebu × Sanga intermediate (Horro) breeds. The Hanwoo (Bos taurus) was included for comparison purposes.

In this study, we used genotypes from 27, 612 autosomal single nucleotide polymorphisms to characterize population structure based on 9214 sires representing nine Swiss dairy cattle populations: Brown Swiss (BS), Braunvieh (BV), Original Braunvieh (OB), Holstein (HO), Red Holstein (RH), Swiss Fleckvieh (SF), Simmental (SI), Eringer (ER) and Evolèner (EV). Genomic inbreeding (FROH) and signatures of selection were determined by calculating runs of homozygosity (ROH). The results build {{the basis for a}} better understanding of the genetic development of Swiss dairy <b>cattle</b> <b>populations</b> and highlight differences between the original populations (i. e. OB, SI, ER and EV) and those that have become more popular in Switzerland as currently reflected by their larger populations (i. e. BS, BV, HO, RH and SF). ResultsThe levels of genetic diversity were highest and lowest in the SF and BS breeds, respectively. Based on FST values, we conclude that, among all pairwise comparisons, BS and HO (0. 156) differ more than the other pairs of populations. The original Swiss <b>cattle</b> <b>populations</b> OB, SI, ER, and EV are clearly genetically separated from the Swiss <b>cattle</b> <b>populations</b> that are now more common and represented by larger numbers of cows. Mean levels of FROH ranged from 0. 027 (ER) to 0. 091 (BS). Three of the original Swiss <b>cattle</b> <b>populations,</b> ER (FROH: 0. 027), OB (FROH: 0. 029), and SI (FROH: 0. 039), showed low levels of genomic inbreeding, whereas it was much higher in EV (FROH: 0. 074). Private signatures of selection for the original Swiss <b>cattle</b> <b>populations</b> are reported for BTA 4, 5, 11 and 26. ConclusionsThe low levels of genomic inbreeding observed in the original Swiss <b>cattle</b> <b>populations</b> ER, OB and SI compared to the other breeds are explained by a lesser use of artificial insemination and greater use of natural service. Natural service results in more sires having progeny at each generation and thus this breeding practice is likely the major reason for the remarkable levels of genetic diversity retained within these populations. The fact that the EV population is regionally restricted and its small census size of herd-book cows explain its high level of genomic inbreeding...|$|R

25|$|In {{the early}} 18th century, {{the disease was}} seen as similar to smallpox, due to its {{analogous}} symptoms. The personal physician of the Pope, Giovanni Maria Lancisi, recommended the slaughter of all infected and exposed animals. This policy was not very popular and used only sparingly {{in the first part}} of the century. Later, it was used successfully in several countries, although it was sometimes seen as too costly or drastic, and depended on a strong central authority to be effective (something which was notably lacking in the Dutch Republic). Because of these downsides, numerous attempts were made to inoculate animals against the disease. These attempts met with varying success, but the procedure was not widely used and was no longer practiced at all in 19th-century Western or Central Europe. Rinderpest was an immense problem, but inoculation was not a valid solution: In many cases, it caused too many losses. Even more importantly, it perpetuated the circulation of the virus in the <b>cattle</b> <b>population.</b> The pioneers of inoculation did contribute significantly to knowledge about infectious diseases.

40|$|In {{southern}} African transfrontier conservation areas (TFCAs), people, {{livestock and}} wildlife share space and resources in semi-arid landscapes. One {{consequence of the}} coexistence of wild and domestic herbivores is the risk of pathogen transmission. This risk threatens local livelihoods relying on animal production, public health {{in the case of}} zoonoses, national economies in the context of transboundary animal diseases, and the success of integrated conservation and development initiatives. The level of interaction between sympatric wild and domestic hosts, defining different wildlife/livestock interfaces, characterizes opportunities of pathogen transmission between host populations. Exploring the relationship between infection burden and different types of wildlife/ domestic interfaces is therefore necessary to manage the sanitary risk in animal populations through control options adapted to these multi-host systems. Here, we assessed the infection burdens of sympatric domestic cattle (Bos taurus/Bos indicus) and African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) at an unfenced interface and compared the infection burdens of <b>cattle</b> <b>populations</b> at different wildlife/ livestock interfaces in the Great Limpopo TFCA. Patterns of infection in ungulate populations varied between wild and domestic hosts and between <b>cattle</b> <b>populations</b> at different wildlife/livestock interfaces. Foot-and-mouth disease, Rift Valley fever and theileriosis infections were detected in buffalo and cattle at unfenced interfaces; bovine tuberculosis was only present in buffalo; and brucellosis and lumpy skin disease only in cattle. At unfenced interfaces, <b>cattle</b> <b>populations</b> presented significantly higher Theileria parva and brucellosis prevalence. We hypothesize that <b>cattle</b> <b>populations</b> at wildlife/livestock interfaces face an increased risk of infection compared to those isolated from wildlife, and that the type of interface could influence the diversity and quantity of pathogens shared. Additional host behavioural and molecular epidemiological studies need to be conducted to support this hypothesis. If it is confirmed, the management of wildlife/livestock interfaces will need to be considered through the prism of livestock and public health. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
