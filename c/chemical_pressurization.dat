40|$|A {{large amount}} of fuel cell {{research}} focuses on porous gas diffusion (PGD) fuel cells which currently produce the best power density. However, this sect of fuel cell technology has many obstacles to overcome before becoming a viable large scale source or power. Nevertheless, alternatives to PGD fuel cells exist. Fluidized bed electrodes (FBE), packed bed electrodes, and packed screen electrodes are discussed and analyzed in this thesis. Fluidization provides a number of benefits, but also presents {{a different set of}} obstacles. One of the largest benefits of fluidization is the possibility of using <b>chemical</b> <b>pressurization</b> to increase the reactant concentration. Perfluorocarbons (PFC), currently being used in biomedical applications as oxygen carriers in plasma, can be used to effectively raise the cathode oxygen concentration. This thesis will propose a model of perfluorocarbon emulsions as applied to an oxygen half cell. The model is first developed for the simple case of a rotating disk electrode (RDE). The predictions of this model are then compared with data obtained from a RDE experiment with and without the use of PFC's. The model is then extended to the use of packed screen electrodes. (cont.) The key findings of the model include the relationships between bed length, power output, oxygen concentration, and volumetric flow rate. Finally, the thesis is concluded with a description of the setup created to test the predictions of the model and proposals for future extensions of this research. by Ali Ahmed. Thesis (S. B.)

40|$|International audienceWe {{study the}} {{influence}} of metamorphic dehydration reactions on the stability of slip in a one‐dimensional, spring‐slider model. The equations that govern {{the evolution of the}} velocity of sliding block and of pore pressure and temperature inside the slip zone are deduced from the mass and energy balance of the multiphases saturated medium and from the kinetics of the dehydration reaction. Such reactions induce two competing effects: a direct increase in pore pressure because they release fluid and a limit in temperature increase because part of the frictional heat is absorbed in the endothermic reactions. The effect of the chemical reaction on the stability of stationary slip is studied. Dehydration reactions increase the critical stiffness at which the system becomes unstable. Depending on the sign of the perturbations, it is shown that dehydration reactions can either (1) trigger a catastrophic increase of pore pressure at quasi‐constant temperature leading to vanishing effective stress or (2) trigger an arrest of the fault. Numerical simulations demonstrate the crucial role of initial pore pressure and temperature in the slip zone prior to the onset of the chemical reaction on the subsequent evolution of the system. For highly pressurized fault zones, in which the creep motion of the fault is stable in absence of dehydration reactions, the onset of the reaction can trigger transient slip events induced by <b>chemical</b> <b>pressurization.</b> The magnitude of such events appears to be proportional to the reaction progress. We conclude that metamorphic dehydration reactions strongly modify the nucleation of unstable slip and are a possible origin for slow slip events in subduction zones...|$|E
