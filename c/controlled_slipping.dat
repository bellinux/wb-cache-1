Robots, however, {{have none of}} these capabilities, they simply grasp objects rigidly in their end effectors. To investigate this common form of human manipulation, an analysis of <b>controlled</b> <b>slipping</b> of a grasped object within a robot hand was performed. The Salisbury robot hand demonstrated many of these <b>controlled</b> <b>slipping</b> techniques, illustrating many results of this analysis. First, the possible slipping motions were found {{as a function of}} the location, orientation, and types of contact between the hand and object. Second, for a given grasp, the contact types were determined {{as a function of the}} grasping force and the external forces on the object. Finally, by changing the grasping force, the robot modified the constraints on the object and affect <b>controlled</b> <b>slipping</b> slipping motions...|$|E
40|$|The {{use of an}} {{electronically}} <b>controlled</b> <b>slipping</b> clutch {{is gradually}} increasing for a marine propulsion system. This system can provide a continuous change of propeller revolution even in a lower revolution zone of prime mover. However, it hardy make the decelerating condition, because the slipping clutch itself can not make the negative torque. In this paper, the authors have designed a push-pull control system using two slipping clutches {{in order to improve}} the above disadvantage of the conventional slipping clutch. For the evaluation of this system, the whole propulsion system including prime mover, clutches, propeller and ship are numerically simulated using the precise mathematical model described here. From several accelerating and decelerating simulations, the following results are pointed out. 1) FPP’s revolution can be easily changed in the slipping zone by using this system, although the main engine is governed constant revolution. 2) Astern and ahead maneuvering is also performed by this system. 3) The mathematical model for this simulation including engine, clutch, propeller and ship is useful for the design and evaluation of the whole propulsion system. As the result, this push-pull <b>controlled</b> <b>slipping</b> clutch system will be very useful for a marine propulsion system. 第 6 回舶用機関国際シンポジウム ISME (International Symposium on Marine Engineering) Tokyo 2000, 場所：日本都市センター会館, 会期： 10 月 23 日- 27...|$|E

40|$|Slip control’ braking {{has been}} shown to reduce the {{emergency}} stopping distance of an experimental heavy goods vehicle by up to 19 %, compared to conventional electronic/anti-lock braking systems (EBS). However, little regard has been given to the impact of <b>slip</b> <b>control</b> braking on the vehicle’s directional dynamics. This paper uses validated computer models to show that <b>slip</b> <b>control</b> could severely degrade directional performance during emergency braking. A modified <b>slip</b> <b>control</b> strategy, ‘attenuated <b>slip</b> demand’ (ASD) <b>control,</b> is proposed in order to rectify this. Results from simulations of vehicle performance are presented for combined braking and cornering manoeuvres with EBS and <b>slip</b> <b>control</b> braking with and without ASD control.

However, within the rail industry it is also recognised to be valuable in protecting the wheels from damage during sliding when braking or spinning in traction. This improvement is achieved by regulation of the wheelset velocity in a controlled manner so that it maintains a relatively consistent level of <b>slip.</b> The <b>controlled</b> <b>slip</b> has the effect of conditioning the contamination layer on the rail (scrubbing action) thereby improving the level of friction and enhancing the ability of the train to stop. <b>Controlled</b> wheel <b>slip</b> can also have a limited cleaning action on the rail head along the length of a train.

One of the reasons why no relationship is found is a poor spatial resolution of the afterslip distribution of the 2007 Noto Hanto earthquake. An investigation of afterslip using data from similar earthquakes overcomes this weakness because spatial resolution of the aftershock hypocenters is much higher than that of the afterslip analyzed geodetically.|$|R

40|$|Longitudinal wheel <b>slip</b> <b>control</b> is {{a crucial}} problem in {{automotive}} systems, as it it {{is the basis for}} traction, braking and stability <b>control.</b> As <b>slip</b> dynamics are critically dependent on the vehicle speed, it is interesting to devise an adaptation of the controller parameters with respect to this variable. Specifically, slip dynamics get faster and thus more difficult to govern for the rider as speed decreases: hence, at low speed one would willingly lose tracking performance in exchange for increased safety. To achieve this, we propose a novel Switched Second Order Sliding Mode (S-SOSM) control strategy, which allows to enhance the closed-loop performance and to tune them to the current working condition. Specifically, the S-SOSM control problem is formulated and discussed, and its validity assessed on a specific instance of the wheel <b>slip</b> <b>control</b> problem, that is the traction control of two-wheeled vehicles...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{mechanical}} {{analysis of the}} problem of slip partitioning between the major thrust systems in a collisional range. We focus on two structures in the Himalayas of central Nepal: the Main Himalayan Thrust (MHT) and the Main Central Thrust (MCT). We use finite-element modeling to test the influence of various parameters, such as friction coefficients and surface processes, and we investigate how they affect the distribution of deformation between these two faults. We observe that reproduction of the late Quaternary kinematic pattern across the range with our model requires strict conditions on the friction coefficients, such that the MHT is very weak, whereas the MCT is significantly stronger. The most important parameter that <b>controls</b> <b>slip</b> partitioning appears to be the dip angle of the MCT, with a gentler or steeper MCT promoting or inhibiting slip, respectively. We also show that transient loading and unloading through focused glacial erosion in the higher part of the range can unclamp the MCT and allow a significant increase in slip rates. The results of this mechanical sensitivity investigation have important implications for the dynamics of the Himalayan wedge and point toward along-strike structural variations as a first-order <b>control</b> on <b>slip</b> partitioning. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceField and {{laboratory}} data reveal {{the possibility of}} a significant coupling of elastic and electromagnetic (EM) fields that affect (hamper or initiate) slip. In this work we try to prove experimentally the possibility of <b>controlling</b> the <b>slip</b> regime by relatively weak mechanical or EM impact, in the way it has been done in nonlinear dynamic experiments on the control of chaos. The experimental setup consisted of a system of two plates of roughly finished basalt, where a constant pulling force was applied to the upper (sliding) plate. In addition, the same plate was subjected to mechanical or electric periodic perturbations, which are much weaker when compared to the pulling force. Quite different regimes of slip were excited depending on the amplitude and the frequency of applied weak perturbations. The observed regimes of slip vary from perfect synchronization of slip events, recorded as acoustic emission bursts with the perturbing periodic mechanical or EM impact, to their complete desynchronization. We consider the obtained results as evidence {{that it is possible to}} <b>control</b> <b>slip</b> by the application of weak periodic perturbations.
