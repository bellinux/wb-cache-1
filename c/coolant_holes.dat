40|$|The work {{presented}} in this dissertation is the first numerical investigation conducted to study leading edge film cooling with Large Eddy Simulation (LES). A cylindrical leading edge with a flat after-body represents the leading edge, where coolant is injected with a 30 ˚ compound angle. Three blowing ratios of 0. 4, 0. 8, and 1. 2 are studied. Free-stream Reynolds number is 100, 000 and coolant-to-mainstream density ratio is unity. At blowing ratio of 0. 4, the effect of coolant inlet condition is investigated. Results show that the fully-turbulent coolant jet increases mixing with the mainstream in the outer shear layer but does not influence the flow dynamics in the turbulent boundary layer at the surface. As a result, the turbulent jet decreases adiabatic effectiveness but {{does not have a}} substantial effect on the heat transfer coefficient. At B.

The efficiency of gas turbine can be increased by increasing the inlet gas temperature. The present study aims at numerical investigation of adiabatic film cooling effectiveness over the cylindrical hole exit flat plate test model. The hole inclination angle of 20 ° with stream wise direction is considered. The test model has 35 film cooling holes arranged in two rows in a staggered configuration with the coolant hole length to diameter ratio of 5. 4 and pitch to diameter ratio of 4. During the experimental analysis, the adiabatic film cooling effectiveness is found at five different blowing ratios in the range of 0. 5 to 2. 5 with the coolant to mainstream density ratio at 1. 6. The laterally averaged film cooling effectiveness is calculated along the stream wise direction at these blowing ratios. The realizable k-epsilon turbulence model with enhanced wall function is used to solve the flow field. The CFD obtained results are validated with the experimental results at a blowing ratio of 1. 0. Further, the CFD analysis is done for other blowing ratios in the range of 0. 5 to 4. 0 at density ratios of 1. 6, 1. 8 and 2. 0. From the CFD results, the laterally averaged film cooling effectiveness is found to be increasing with the increase in blowing ratio up to 1. 5 immediately downstream of the <b>coolant</b> <b>holes.</b> For the blowing ratios of 2. 0 to 4, the adiabatic film cooling effectiveness is less immediately downstream of <b>coolant</b> <b>holes</b> up to x/d= 15 and then increases with increase in the blowing ratios considered...|$|E

The study focuses on the effect of impingement jet flow rate, jet angle, and flow exit direction on various target surface heat transfer distributions. A two-channel test section simulates a series of jets impinging on a target surface. This work is mostly experimental.

The number and dimensions of <b>coolant</b> <b>holes</b> are varied to optimize the pressure drop, the inlet velocity, {{and the percentage of}} graphite removed from the PSR to create this inlet path. With the removal of ~ 10 % of the graphite from PSR the PVT is reduced from 541 0 C to 421 0 C.

The dimensions and number of fuel rods and <b>coolant</b> <b>holes,</b> and the triangular pitch have been changed and optimized. Different packing fractions for the new core design have been used to conserve the number of fuel particles. Thermal properties for the fuel elements are calculated and incorporated into these analyses. The inlet temperature, mass flow and bypass flow are optimized to limit the peak fuel temperature (PFT) within an acceptable range. Using both of these modifications together, the PVT is reduced to ~ 350 0 C while keeping the outlet temperature at 950 0 C and maintaining the PFT within acceptable limits. The vessel and fuel temperatures during low pressure conduction cooldown and high pressure conduction cooldown transients are found to be well below the design limits.

The temperature field analysis was performed using our highly accurate boundary integral element code with linearly varying temperature along straight surface panels. Examples of the inverse design applied to internally cooled turbine blades and scram jet struts (coated and non-coated) having circular and non-circular coolant flow passages will be shown...|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} is performed to mathematically model a 550 kWe lunar base power supply {{which uses a}} SP- 100 reactor coupled with Stirling converters. The reactor is placed in an excavation to keep activated <b>coolant</b> in the <b>hole</b> and to allow maintance of the components outside the hole. Two technology levels are considered. They are 1050 and 1300 K heater head Stirling converts. It is found that for a 1050 K converter the total mass which provided 1000 volts dc at 250 m is 14, 366 kg while the 1300 K system mass is 12, 104 kg. The radiation area of the 1050 and 1300 K systems are 641 and 356 sq m respectively. Comparisons are made with Brayton and thermionic systems with both near term and advanced technology considered...|$|R
