40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{the nature}} of debate on “below the line” <b>comment</b> <b>fields</b> at the UK’s Guardian, and how, if at all, such debates are impacting journalism practice. The article combines a content analysis of 3792 comments across 85 articles {{that focused on the}} UN Climate Change Summit, with 10 interviews with journalists, 2 with affiliated commentators, plus the community manager. The results suggest a more positive picture than has been found by many existing studies: debates were often deliberative in nature and journalists reported that it was positively impacting their practice in several ways, including providing new story leads and enhanced critical reflection. However, citizen-journalist debate was limited. The results are attributed to the normalization of <b>comment</b> <b>fields</b> into everyday journalism practice, extensive support and encouragement from senior management, and a realization that <b>comment</b> <b>fields</b> can actually make the journalists’ life a little easier...|$|R

The text string [...] "comment" [...] might be repeated in the label, the HTML tag, in a read function name, a private variable, database DDL, queries, and so on. A DRY approach eliminates that redundancy by leveraging frameworks that reduce or eliminate all those edit tasks excepting the most important one, leaving the extensibility of adding new knowledge variables in one place.|$|E

The enforcement that is implemented in the software code is a strong coercion because the law implemented in the software is difficult to violate. For example, in 2007, when the presidential election was held, Korea’s No. 1 internet portal Naver, who was afraid of the conservative party, blocked the <b>comment</b> <b>field</b> of political news articles.

40|$|Mitochondria, besides {{their central}} role in energy metabolism, have {{recently}} {{been found to be}} involved in a number of basic processes of cell life and to contribute to the pathogenesis of many degenerative diseases. All functions of mitochondria depend on the interaction of nuclear and organelle genomes. Mitochondrial genomes have been extensively sequenced and analysed and data have been collected in several specialised databases. In order to collect information on nuclear coded mitochondrial proteins we developed MitoNuc, a database containing detailed information on sequenced nuclear genes coding for mitochondrial proteins in Metazoa. The MitoNuc database can be retrieved through SRS and is available via the web site [URL] where other mitochondrial databases developed by our group, the complete list of the sequenced mitochondrial genomes, links to other mitochondrial sites and related information, are available. The MitoAln database, related to MitoNuc in the previous release, reporting the multiple alignments of the relevant homologous protein coding regions, is no longer supported in the present release. In order to keep the links among entries in MitoNuc from homologous proteins, a new field in the database has been defined: the cluster identifier, an alpha numeric code used to identify each cluster of homologous proteins. A <b>comment</b> <b>field</b> derived from the corresponding SWISS-PROT entry has been introduced; this reports clinical data related to dysfunction of the protein. The logic scheme of MitoNuc database has been implemented in the ORACLE DBMS. This will allow the end-users to retrieve data through a friendly interface that will be soon implemented...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether a lack of reliability in educational technology contributes to its nonuse by teachers. ^ Little attention has been paid by school systems and educational researchers to the role unreliable technology plays in frustrating teachers and making them fearful of committing to technology use in the classroom. Further, school systems commonly provide inadequate response when technology fails, compounding the problem. Teachers often wait days or more for repairs to be completed. Few public school teachers participating in this study indicated that they are completely satisfied by the support they receive. In the fast-paced classroom of today, technology failures must be dealt with quickly and competently if teachers are to invest time in new ways of teaching that depend on technology. ^ In this study, over 1000 Georgia K- 12 public school teachers completed a Web-based survey form. The survey included an open-ended <b>comment</b> <b>field</b> in which teachers could describe their issues with classroom technology. In addition, seven teachers were interviewed to discover their attitudes about educational technology reliability and support and their experiences with classroom technology. ^ Analysis of the collected data makes several points clear: (1) A lack of reliability of classroom technology affects teacher attitudes about using it in the classroom. (2) If classroom technology were more reliable, teachers would use it more. (3) Many teachers reported inadequate technical support when failures do occur. Repairs can take days or weeks. Such delays affect their attitudes about using technology in the classroom. (4) If technology problems could be resolved quickly, teachers would use classroom technology more. (5) A lack of available technology or old and non-functional technology is a problem in many public K- 12 classrooms. ...|$|E
40|$|Misogyny in gaming culture – a {{qualitative}} discourse {{analysis of the}} reproduction of patriarchal dominance in the gaming culture is based on Teun A. van Dijk's belief that a dominant group continuously produces and reproduces its social dominance over a subordinate group by using the language. The {{members of this group}} do not simply do this by being. A person does not want to risk damaging its reputation which makes the dominant group forced to use various strategies to reproduce its dominance. Extreme behaviors such as misogyny could be one such strategy. With the help of Sylvia Walby’s theories of patriarchy as an oppressive and dominating group and Hillevi Lenz Taguchi’s statements about women and other minorities as inferior against patriarchy, my thesis want to examine how this patriarchal power arises. Previous research has shown that cultures which glorifies violence is in a way a seed for misogyny and that act in turn provides a control over women which keeps them in check. Other research has also shown that there exists an active opposition from private parties against misogyny and discrimination in gaming culture. It examines the dominant groups reproduction on the internet, the specific strategies used for the reproduction, how the material differs depending on the context in which it is written in, how the resistance looks to anti-feminism and misogyny and what kind of strategy exceedance of themes were used. The study has involved analyzing the <b>comment</b> <b>field</b> on a news article and a forum thread on the internet. In total, 272 comments were analyzed. The results have shown that the use of subtle strategies are more common than the use of direct ones. Which shows that the members of the dominant group may be concerned about their social status. However, the extreme behaviors as well as direct reproductive strategies are more common in internet-based contexts which involve a more secluded environment, where the operator is more protected and less publicly undressed for others. Furthermore there was a liaison between van Dijk’s theory and the theory of patriarchy which indicated that when the writers showed reproduction of dominance it was also an indication of patriarchal oppression. Also, three themes were sifted during the analysis of the material. These were used by writers that would legitimize their arguments and were constructed regardless of any strategy used...|$|E

I have therefore taken {{a closer look at}} how the online debate can influence the perception of a news article. Previous research has had a particularly strong focus on whether or not these online debates promote or hinder democratic values.

In a quasi-experimental design, I exposed 545 respondents divided into two groups for the same news topic, but different comment fields: one with a rude- and one with a polite tone towards the news articles’ content, and analyzed how the degree of incivility affects the respondents’ perception. The results shows that the respondents has clear opinions of <b>comment</b> <b>fields</b> in general, and seems to perceive online debates as an arena with a low level of seriousness.
