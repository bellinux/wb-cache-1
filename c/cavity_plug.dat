40|$|This {{document}} identifies {{data that}} can be used for assessing various models embodied in severe accident analysis codes. Phenomena considered in this document, which were limited to those anticipated to be of interest in assessing severe accidents in the USEPR developed by AREVA, include: • Fuel Heatup and Melt Progression • Reactor Coolant System (RCS) Thermal Hydraulics • In-Vessel Molten Pool Formation and Heat Transfer • Fuel/Coolant Interactions during Relocation • Debris Heat Loads to the Vessel • Vessel Failure • Molten Core Concrete Interaction (MCCI) and Reactor <b>Cavity</b> <b>Plug</b> Failure • Melt Spreading and Coolability • Hydrogen Control Each section of this report discusses one phenomenon of interest to the USEPR. Within each section, an effort is made to describe the phenomenon and identify what data are available modeling it. As noted in this document, models in US accident analysis codes (MAAP, MELCOR, and SCDAP/RELAP 5) differ. Where possible, this report identifies previous assessments that illustrate the impact of modeling differences on predicting various phenomena. Finally, recommendations regarding the status of data available for modeling USEPR severe accident phenomena are summarized...|$|E
5000|$|Cavity plate cooling by drilled holes—The {{cavity plate}} is drilled around the <b>cavity</b> insert and <b>plugged</b> with copper or {{aluminum}} taper plugs {{at the ends}} of openings. Using pipe connected at the inlet and outlet ports, water is circulated to cool the mold.|$|R
50|$|This {{species has}} been {{recorded}} has a flight period from May to October in Britain {{and it seems to}} exclusively prey on the crab spider Xysticus cristatus. D.variegatus will utilise almost any kind of pre-existing cavity including dead plant stems, dead wood, masonry cavities and even old snail shells. The nest <b>cavity</b> is <b>plugged</b> with sand grains, soil or plant debris which is bound together by spider silk collected by the female using the maxillar bristles which give the genus Dipogon its name. In small cavities single cells may be constructed but if space permits multiple cells will be built.|$|R
50|$|Other {{containers}} are not {{planted with}} the tree, e.g., Styroblock®, Superblock®, Copperblock®, and Miniblock® container systems, produce Styroplug® seedlings with roots in a cohesive plug of growing medium. The <b>plug</b> <b>cavities</b> vary in volume by various combinations of top diameter and depth, from 39 to 3260 mL, but those most commonly used, {{at least in}} British Columbia, {{are in the range}} 39 mL to 133 mL (Van Eerden and Gates 1990). The BC-CFS Styroblock® plug, developed in 1969/70, has become the dominant stock type for interior spruce in British Columbia (Van Eerden and Gates 1990, Coates et al. 1994). Plug sizes are indicated by a 3-figure designation, the 1st figure of which gives the top diameter and the other 2 figures the depth of the <b>plug</b> <b>cavity,</b> both dimensions approximations in centimetres. The demand for larger plugs has been increasing strongly (Table 6.24; Coates et al. 1994). Stock raised in some sizes of plug can vary in age class. In British Columbia, for example, PSB 415 and PSB 313 plugs are raised as 1+0 or 2+0. PSB 615 plugs are seldom raised other than as 2+0.|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} tests were {{conducted}} to stabilize the combustion of the Fastrac engine thrust chamber. The first few stability tests resulted in unstable combustion due ineffective acoustic cavity designs. The thrust chamber exhibited unstable combustion in the first-tangential mode and its harmonics. Combustion was stabilized by increasing {{the volume of the}} acoustic <b>cavities</b> and by <b>plugging</b> the dump-cooling orifices so that the cavities were uncooled. Although the first few stability tests resulted in unstable combustion, prior and subsequent long-duration performance tests of the Fastrac thrust chamber were spontaneously stable. Stability considerations during the injector faceplate design were based on the Hewitt correlation...|$|R
40|$|CFD {{analyses}} are playing {{an increasingly important}} role in identifying and characterizing flow induced instabilities in rocket engine test facilities and flight systems. In this paper, we analyze instability mechanisms that range from turbulent pressure fluctuations due to vortex shedding in structurally complex valve systems to flow resonance in <b>plug</b> <b>cavities</b> to large scale pressure fluctuations due to collapse of cavitation induced vapor clouds. Furthermore, we discuss simulations of transient behavior related to valve motion that can serve as guidelines for valve scheduling. Such predictions of valve response to varying flow conditions is of crucial importance to engine operation and testing...|$|R
40|$|I {{examined}} the relationship between exotic and native cavity-nesting birds in the Sonoran desert near Tucson, Arizona during 1988 and 1989. I attempted to limit cavity availability in 1989 by <b>plugging</b> <b>cavities</b> that were unused, or used by exotics, in 1988 with rubber test tube stoppers. Numbers of nests of any species did not significantly change between 1988 and 1989. Control plots showed similar results. I found no significant negative correlations between number of nests of European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) and any other cavity-nesting species. Of the cavity characteristics examined, species only differed in size of cavity openings. My data indicate that exotic and native cavity-nesting birds were not competing for nest cavities. An excess of available nest cavities is the probable reason for this lack of competition. Temporal differences in cavity use among species may have helped contribute to the abundance of cavities...|$|R
40|$|Engineers are relying more on {{computational}} predictions {{to aid in}} {{the design}} of multistage compressors. As compressor designs advance to more sophisticated geometries with higher loadings, the predictive tools must be able to capture the effects on secondary flows, those flows not associated with the main compressor through flow. In the rear stages of a compressor where aspect ratios are low, secondary flows associated with endwall boundary layers and shrouded stator leakage flow must be understood. ^ The objective of this research was to investigate the effects of stator leakage flow on compressor performance. All experimental research was conducted at the Purdue 3 -Stage Axial Compressor Research Facility. The axial compressor is a scaled-up representation of the rear stages of a high pressure compressor with engine representative Mach numbers and Reynolds numbers. Computational research was conducted using a steady RANS CFD code with multiple meshes to investigate the sensitivity of computational modeling to stator leakage cavities. ^ Facility specific boundary conditions were acquired experimentally and applied to the computational models. Detailed total pressure and total temperature measurements indicate that the inlet of the compressor is circumferentially uniform allowing for an axisymmetric boundary condition to be applied to both experimental and computational research. ^ The shrouded stator cavity in the third stage of the compressor is open to ambient conditions. Mass flow rate through this cavity is measured using an orifice flow meter, and the <b>cavity</b> can be <b>plugged</b> to prevent any leakage flow. Static pressure measurements were acquired at the exit of the stator 3 cavity so that the leakage flow could be simulated and compared with experimental data. Radial total pressure profiles predicted by the different numerical models are compared with experimental profiles with the <b>cavity</b> open and <b>plugged.</b> ^ The predicted compressor performance at high flow conditions was strongly dependent upon the particular leakage flow model employed. Physically meshing the stator cavities yielded the best comparison of overall performance predictions and radial profiles to experimental data near design loading. Since plugging the stator 3 cavity yielded only small changes in the radial total pressure profile, experimental and computational data suggest the leakage flow through the stator 3 cavity on the Purdue 3 -Stage Axial Compressor has a relatively negligible impact on overall compressor and stage-by-stage performance. ...|$|R
40|$|Culturing of {{microbes}} {{for food}} production, called cultivation mutualism, has been well-documented from eusocial and subsocial insects such as ants, termites and ambrosia beetles, but poorly described from solitary, non-social insects. Here we report a fungal farming in a non-social lizard beetle Doubledaya bucculenta (Coleoptera: Erotylidae: Languriinae), which entails {{development of a}} special female structure for fungal storage/inoculation, so-called mycangium, and also obligate dependence of the insect on the fungal associate. Adult females of D. bucculenta bore a hole on a recently-dead bamboo culm with their specialized mandibles, lay an egg into the internode <b>cavity,</b> and <b>plug</b> the hole with bamboo fibres. We found that the inner wall of the bamboo internode harboring a larva is always covered with a white fungal layer. A specific Saccharomycetes yeast, Wickerhamomyces anomalus ( = Pichia anomala), was consistently isolated from the inner wall of the bamboo internodes and also from the body surface of the larvae. Histological examination of the ovipositor of adult females revealed an exoskeletal pocket on the eighth abdominal segment. The putative mycangium contained yeast cells, and W. anomalus was repeatedly detected from the symbiotic organ. When first instar larvae were placed on culture media inoculated with W. anomalus, they grew and developed normally to adulthood. By contrast, first instar larvae placed on either sterile culture media or autoclaved strips of bamboo inner wall exhibited arrested growth at the second instar, and addition of W. anomalus to the media resumed growth {{and development of the}} larvae. These results strongly suggest a mutualistic nature of the D. bucculenta-W. anomalus association with morphological specialization and physiological dependence. Based on these results, we compare the fungal farming of D. bucculenta with those of social and subsocial insects, and discuss ecological factors relevant to the evolution of fungal farming in a non-social insect...|$|R
40|$|The {{preignition}} {{characteristics of}} the R- 2800 cylinder, as effected by fuel consumption, engine operating variables, and spark plug type and condition, were evaluated. The effects on preignition-limited performance of various percentages of aromatics (benzene, toluene, cumene, xylene) in a base fuel of triptane were investigated. Two paraffins (triptane and S + 6. 0 ml TEL/gal) and two refinery blends (28 -R and 33 -R) were preignition rated. The effect {{of changes in the}} following engine operating variables on preignition limit was determined: inlet-air temperature, rear spark plug gasket temperature, engine speed, spark advance, tappet clearance, and oil consumption. Preignition limits of the R- 2800 cylinder using Champion C 34 S and C 35 S and AC-LS 86, LS 87, and LS 88 spark plugs were established and the effect of spark plug deterioration was investigated. No definite trends in preignition-limited indicated mean effective pressure were indicated for aromatics as a class when increased percentages of different aromatics were added to a base fuel of triptane. Three types of fuel (aromatics, paraffins, and refinery blends) showed a preignition range for this cylinder from 65 to 104 percent when based on the performance of S plus 6. 0 ml TEL per gallon as 100 percent. The R- 2800 cylinder is therefore relatively insensitive to fuel composition when compared to a CFR F- 4 engine, which had a pre-ignition range from 72 to 100 percent for the same fuels. Six engine operating variables were investigated with the following results: preignition-limited indicated mean effective pressure decreased, with increases in engine speed, rear spark plug gasket temperature, inlet-air temperature, and spark advance beyond 20 F B. T. C. and was unaffected by rate of oil consumption or by tappet clearance. Spark plugs were rated over a range of preignition-limited indicated mean effective pressure from 200 to 390 pounds per square inch at a fuel-air ratio of 0. 07 in the following order of increased resistance to preignition: AC-LS 97, AC-LS 88, Champion C 358, AC-LS 86, and Champion C 34 S. Spark plug deterioration in the form of cracks in the porcelain had been broken away from the center electrode and were retained in the spark <b>plug</b> <b>cavity,</b> the preignition limit was decreased as much as 57 percent. When the broken pieces had been removed, the preignition limit increased from that of the undamaged porcelain as the weight of removed porcelain was increased...|$|R
