40|$|In {{the article}} {{the problem of}} bending of {{circular}} axially loaded flexible plate during creep was solved. The solution is reduced {{to a system of}} two nonlinear differential equations. These equations are suitable for arbitrary dependencies between tensions and creep deformations. The system was solved by the method of successive approximations in conjunction with the finite difference method. Calculations were performed with the help of software package Matlab. We considered round rigidly clamped along the <b>contour</b> <b>plate,</b> which was loaded by the load uniformly distributed over the area. Polymer EDB- 10 was taken as a material, which obeys the Maxwell-Gurevich physical law. Creep strains at each point of time were found using linear approximation. In order to verify the correctness of the program, we compared the elastic solution with the result of Professor A. Volmir. He solved this problem by the method of Bubnov-Galerkin only taking into account the geometric nonlinearity. Our results are in good agreement with the solution of. A. Volmir. It is revealed that the calculation excluding geometric nonlinearity gives high values of deflections. The analysis of the equations for t→∞ showed that in linear geometric theory stresses across the thickness of the plate {{at the end of the}} creep change linearly. Also the formula for long cylindrical rigidity was obtained. This formula allows us to find the deflection at the end of the creep process, if we know the elastic solution. It is shown that long cylindrical rigidity depends not only on the long elastic modulus v, but also on short elastic modulus v and Poisson's ratio v. It was also found out that in case of high loads stress distribution across the thickness is nonlinear...|$|E
40|$|Arthrodesis of {{the ankle}} joint {{is still the}} {{traditional}} treatment for symptomatic osteoarthritis. This com-parative study was done to assess the functional out-come of open ankle fusion using either cross screw fixation (group A) or anterior <b>contoured</b> <b>plate</b> and cross screw fixation (group B) in a consecutive series of 22 patients. All the patients had the same inclusion criteria. All the patients in both groups underwent the same operative technique and were operated by the same surgeon. Mean follow-up was 26. 8 months. The mean time to fusion was 18. 8 weeks in group A and 16. 8 weeks in group B (p = 0. 046). The mean American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) Ankle and Hind foot score at the final fol-low-up was 79 in group A and 86 in group B (p = 0. 23). Two patients in group A that went to non-union required re-arthrodesis using <b>contoured</b> <b>plate</b> and cross screw fixation; both attained eventual union. We conclude that anterior <b>contoured</b> <b>plate</b> plus cross screw fixation is a simple and reproducible technique for ankle arthrodesis that gives stable internal fixa-tion and excellent clinical results...|$|R
40|$|Twenty-one {{patients}} having proximal ulna nonunion {{were treated}} with <b>contoured</b> <b>plating.</b> The most proximal hole received an intramedullary 6. 5 -mm cancellous lag screw that extends fixation of the nonunion site. Mean age of the patients was 41. 7 years. Average follow-up period was 22 months. Union occurred in 19 cases after a mean of 9. 6 weeks. Complications were persistent nonunion in two cases, a stiff elbow in one, hardware prominence in two, and a 1 × 1 -cm ulcer over {{the curve of the}} plate in one case. The two unsatisfactory results were related to ulnohumeral arthritis. In conclusion, augmentation of the <b>contoured</b> <b>plate</b> with a 6. 5 -mm intramedullary cancellous lag screw creates a stable construct in treatment of proximal ulna nonunion.

40|$|To {{review the}} results of {{internal}} fixation with a dorsal <b>contoured</b> <b>plate</b> in patients with malalignment after internal fixation of a posterior Monteggia fracture. Seventeen patients with malalignment after surgical treatment of a posterior Monteggia fracture were treated with realignment of the ulna and fixation with a <b>contoured</b> dorsal <b>plate.</b> Fifteen patients had loose fixation and 12 patients had subluxation or dislocation of the ulnohumeral joint. Sixteen patients had fracture of the radial head and 9 patients had fracture of the coronoid process. Nine patients had ancillary procedures on the radial head, 4 had ancillary procedures on the coronoid, 5 had hinged external fixation, and one had fascial arthroplasty. Seven patients had another surgery before the final evaluation related to a complication in 6 patients and a to subsequent injury in 1 patient. At the final evaluation {{at an average of}} 59 months the fracture was healed and the ulnohumeral joint was reduced concentrically in all 17 patients. The average arc of elbow flexion was 108 degrees and the average arc of forearm rotation was 134 degrees. The average American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Elbow Evaluation Score was 88. According to the system of Broberg and Morrey, the final result was rated excellent for 5 patients, good for 9, fair for 2, and poor for 1. One patient had fascial arthroplasty as part of the index procedure and 9 patients had radiographic signs of ulnohumeral arthrosis.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{patients}} managed with plate fixation for {{the treatment}} of an olecranon fracture, the placement of an axial intramedullary screw may obstruct the placement of bicortical screws in the ulnar shaft. To overcome this problem, unicortical screws can be applied with use of a <b>contoured</b> locking compression <b>plate.</b> The present study was designed to assess the effectiveness of this fixation method. METHODS: Nineteen consecutive patients with an acute comminuted olecranon fracture were managed with a <b>contoured</b> locking compression <b>plate</b> and intramedullary screw fixation. Sixteen patients were available for follow-up at a minimum of twelve months after fixation. Patient-based outcomes were assessed, and patient satisfaction and pain were evaluated. RESULTS: All nineteen fractures healed. The mean time to fracture union was four months. The mean Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand score was 13. According to the Mayo Elbow Performance Index and the Broberg and Morrey grading system, fifteen of the sixteen patients with at least one year of follow-up had a good or excellent outcome. Nine patients underwent hardware removal at a mean of twelve months postoperatively. The mean elbow extension deficit in these patients improved significantly from 34 degrees to 10 degrees following hardware removal. The mean flexion improved from 118 degrees to 138 degrees, but this difference was not significant.

40|$|The {{surface of}} a typical {{stringed}} instrument’s arched plate is a complex surface indeed. Experienced plate carvers and first timers possessed of highly refined spatial perception tend to implement these with some ease, while for others even the prospect of rendering such a plate is just too intimidating. This paper proposes a method by which the <b>contours</b> of such <b>plates</b> may be specified. It is a step-by-step design approach which can yield a topographic contour specification such as found in topographic maps * for a plate of arbitrary outline. The resulting specification can be directly transferred to a plate blank which is then rough carved with a router to yield a close approximation of the finished <b>plate’s</b> <b>contours,</b> such that only minor additional carving is necessary. The method described is derived from a feature of advanced Computer Aided Design (CAD) facilities called Parametric Solid Modeling (PSM). Using PSM a designer may completely specify the dimensions of a complex solid by specifying the values of {{a relatively small number}} of parameters. Folks with a non-technical bent need not be put off by the derivation of the contour specification method to be described, as no CAD or math is required to use it. The method described is a modification and simplification of the CAD-based method I use to develop arching profiles for new instruments, modified and simplified so as to be useable with pencil and paper. As CAD software is increasingly used in lutherie, the method is also described such that it can be performed using basic 2 D CAD software as well. The method begins with the specification of the values of a small number of parameters which describe the <b>plate</b> <b>contours.</b> These parameters are: 1. Outline of the plate; 2. Location of the apex (highest point) of the arch; 3. Thickness of the plate at its edge; 4. Height of the apex of the arch; 5.

40|$|Abstract—We have {{observed}} that torsional vibrations can be trapped in elastic plates with circular regions of slightly thicker steps or with smooth convex contoured surfaces. An electromagnetic acoustic transducer (EMAT) was used to generate oscillatory surface traction. The resonant frequencies and Q-values were measured. It was found that these trapped torsional modes have Q-values exceeding 100, 000 with pure inplane motion, which is of practical importance for acoustic sensor applications. In this paper, a set of approximate two-dimensional equations is developed to study vibrations in axisymmetrically contoured or stepped elastic plates. By assuming circumferentially independent motion, the first-order equations are decoupled into four groups, with torsional modes uncoupled from flexural and extensional modes. Analytical solutions for torsional modes are obtained for stepped and linearly <b>contoured</b> circular <b>plates.</b> It is found that the firstorder torsional modes can be trapped in an infinite plate with a stepped or contoured region if critical conditions for the geometrical parameters are met.

40|$|The {{development}} of streamwise vortices and transition of a three-dimensional boundary-layer flow on a curved surface is studied experimentally. The {{model is a}} cylindrical wing shaped body with concave profile segments. It is set at a sweep angle of 30 o. In order to enable comparision with theory quasi two-dimensional flow conditions are approximated by means of <b>contoured</b> end <b>plates.</b> The streamwise pressure gradient leads to the amplificaiton of both Goertler and crossflow instabilities. The disturbance development is measured by means of hot-wire anemometry. Surface hot-films are used for sensoring transition. Streamwise vortices {{are found to be}} strongly amplified along the concave segment in the presence of strong and weak crossflow as well. No characteristic difference is found for the streamwise vortices developing in the two cases. Remarkably, on the convex segment the streamwise vortices are damped, even in the region of strong crossflow instability. Apart from the stationary modes are also traced. A significant difference is observed between the disturbance interactions, appearing on the swept curved model and the swept flat plate used in former experiments. On the curved model, transition occurs under swept conditions earlier than under unswept conditions. This becomes most obvious on the concave profile segment...|$|R
40|$|Pediatric {{subtrochanteric}} femoral fractures {{are rare}} and have received limited {{attention in the}} literature Treatment is controversial. Different treatment options are used: skin traction, 90 / 90 skeletal trac-tion, spica casting, cast bracing, internal fixation and external fixation. The {{aim of this study}} is to present our results with internal fixation of subtrochanteric femoral fractures in children using a reconstruction plate. Between 2000 and 2004, eighteen patients with closed subtrochanteric femoral fractures were treated in the Mansoura Emergency Hospital. The average age at the time of injury was 8. 2 years (range 5. 3 years to 11. 5 years). Pathological fractures and fractures associated with neuromuscular diseases were excluded from this study. Eight patients had head injuries and/or multiple injuries. In all cases a single 4. 5 mm <b>contoured</b> reconstruction <b>plate</b> was used and a 6. 5 mm cancellous screw was inserted through the plate into the femoral neck. Average follow-up was 38 months (range, 12 to 47 months). All fractures united with anatomical alignment with-in an average of 8 weeks (range 6 to 12 weeks). There were no deep infections and no significant limb length discrepancies. At the latest follow-up, no patient had any restriction of activities. Internal fixation with a reconstruction plate appears as a good treatment option for children with sub-trochanteric femoral fractures...|$|R

Sandwich {{plates are}} widely used in various {{branches}} of industry. Thus, the calculation of sandwich structures under static loads is an actual task. Elastic rectangular sandwich plate with uncompressible filler lying on elastic foundation is considered. Kirchhoff?s hypotheses are accepted for description of base layers kinematics. The foundation reaction is described by Winkler?s model. The presence of rigid diaphragm impeding the relative shift of layers is presumed on the <b>contour</b> of the <b>plate.</b> The variational Lagrange?s principle is used for receiving differential system of equilibrium equations. The numerical calculation of th sandwich plate finite element package Femap-NASTRAN. Was determined by the dependence of bending stiffness of the base.

30|$|We {{conclude}} {{that the use of}} one or two lag screws along with a single posteriorly placed 4.5 -mm <b>contoured</b> locking compression <b>plate</b> having at least two locking screws in the distal fragment provides sufficient rigid fixation in distal metaphyseal fractures of the humerus. The dissection does not extend beyond the apex of the olecranon fossa. The implant stops well short of the olecranon fossa. Excellent results can be achieved in these fractures without the use of dual plating and without the need for expensive customized implants or elaborately modified implants. Careful patient selection is important for this technique and indiscriminate use of single-plate fixation should be avoided. Physiologically, young patients with good bone quality and good motivation for post-operative physiotherapy are suitable for this technique. Patients with open fractures, highly comminuted fractures, fractures with intercondylar extensions and pathological fractures are not suitable for this type of fixation.|$|R
