In this paper, necessary and sufficient {{conditions for a}} Banach space to <b>contain</b> <b>an</b> asymptotically isometric copy of l_p(1 ≤ p <∞) or c_ 0 are given by the dual action. In particular, it is shown that <b>a</b> Banach space <b>contains</b> <b>an</b> asymptotically isometric copy of l_ 1 if its dual space <b>contains</b> <b>an</b> isometric copy of l_∞, and if <b>a</b> Banach space <b>contains</b> <b>an</b> asymptotically isometric copy of c_ 0, then its dual space <b>contains</b> <b>an</b> asymptotically isometric copy of l_ 1...|$|R

5|$|According to Renaissance accounts, gigantic, {{triangular}} fossil teeth {{often found}} embedded in rocky formations were once {{believed to be}} the petrified tongues, or glossopetrae, of dragons and snakes. This interpretation was corrected in 1667 by Danish naturalist Nicolas Steno, who recognized them as shark teeth, and famously produced a depiction of a shark's head bearing such teeth. He described his findings in the book The Head of a Shark Dissected, which also <b>contained</b> <b>an</b> illustration of a megalodon tooth.|$|E

5|$|As he {{indicated}} in the title, Kepler thought he had revealed God's geometrical plan for the universe. Much of Kepler's enthusiasm for the Copernican system stemmed from his theological convictions about {{the connection between the}} physical and the spiritual; the universe itself was an image of God, with the Sun corresponding to the Father, the stellar sphere to the Son, and the intervening space between to the Holy Spirit. His first manuscript of Mysterium <b>contained</b> <b>an</b> extensive chapter reconciling heliocentrism with biblical passages that seemed to support geocentrism.|$|E
5|$|By 1942, {{there were}} {{proposals}} for completely buried flame fougasses {{to be used}} as oil mines but by then the emergency was over. Almost all flame fougasses were removed {{before the end of the}} war and in most instances even the slightest traces of their original locations have disappeared. A few instances were missed, and their remains have been found. For example, the rusty remnants of a four-barrel battery, one of which still <b>contained</b> <b>an</b> oily residue, were discovered in 2010 in West Sussex.|$|E
