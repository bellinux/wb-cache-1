5000|$|In RoboCop 2, RoboCop's {{right arm}} {{contained}} a display that alerted personnel to his health status. RoboCop's hands also contain actuators {{strong enough to}} crush every bone in a human hand (about 400 foot pounds). His right hand also contains a spike (referred to by fans as a [...] "dataspike" [...] and by production as the [...] "terminal strip") {{which is used to}} retrieve or display data from any computer bank with a corresponding port. At {{the end of the first}} film, the jack is also used as a stabbing weapon against the antagonist Clarence Boddicker. RoboCop is extremely strong, able to lift the front of the average car over his head with one arm or resist the <b>crushing</b> <b>effort</b> of a car crusher, as seen in the TV series (episodes 5 and 21, respectively). He was designed to be able [...] "to penetrate virtually any building," [...] and breaks locks with ease.|$|E

40|$|The {{cases in}} this report {{describe}} employers 2 ̆ 7 blatant contempt {{for the rights of}} workers to voice their opinions in the workplace. Obsessed with retaining unilateral and total authority over their employees, the owners of companies and their agents {{go to great lengths to}} <b>crush</b> <b>efforts</b> by workers to exercise their right to an independent voice. Employers harass, intimidate, and threaten workers with reprisal so that they will abandon their quest for union representation. Those who emerge as leaders of these attempts at self-organization and those who openly question terms and conditions of employment are singled out for ridicule, assigned onerous tasks, disciplined, and often fired. While management wages a frontal attack on workers, company lawyers manipulate the legal process to delay, frustrate and defeat the campaign for independent representation. As a result, the right to an independent voice for workers has become a mirage...|$|R

50|$|Dunloy {{set about}} {{reducing}} the deficit after the restart with two drilled frees from Gregory O'Kane bringing them within three, however, that {{was as close as}} Dunloy got. Birr gradually imposed their will on the game and the points came more readily. Simon Whelehan had four from frees, Declan Pilkington, Molloy, the two Hanniffys again and impressive sub Stephen Browne with a brace <b>crushed</b> the <b>effort</b> of Dunloy. In the 56th minute Birr were leading by 0-17 to 0-10 when they pounced for a goal. A long Brian Whelahan free hopped off Dunloy 'keeper Gareth McGhee's hand onto the crossbar and rebounded before an alert Declan Pilkington sent it to the net to kill the game.|$|R

40|$|Research is {{reported}} on the recovery of molybdenum and nickel from spent coal liquefaction catalysts. Mo release from spent coal liquefaction catalysts {{has been shown to}} be dependent upon many parameters, but release is dominated by microbial growth. The microbial Mo release is a rapid process requiring less than one week for 90 % of the releaseable Mo to be solubilized from whole washed (THF) catalyst. It could be expected that the rates would be even greater with <b>crushed</b> catalyst. <b>Efforts</b> were centered on optimizing the parameters that stimulate microbial growth and action and further efforts centered on catalyst pre-treatment prior to microbial bio-leaching. Recent experiments suggest that hydrogen peroxide promises to be an effective pre-treatment wash. Hydrogen peroxide was also found to be an effective and economical agent for metals solubilization per se and could promote solubilization without subjecting the catalyst to microbial growth...|$|R
5000|$|During {{this period}} of time, Glubb Pasha's Legionnaires {{dominated}} the tribal country north of Fallujah between the Euphrates and the Tigris, an area known as Jezireh. Lieutenant-General Glubb had been instructed to persuade the local tribes to stop supporting Rashid Ali's government. Using a combination of propaganda and raids against Iraqi government posts, his actions proved to be remarkably successful. [...] The British also used {{this period of}} time to increase air activity against the northern airfields of the Luftwaffe and to finally <b>crush</b> the German <b>effort</b> to support the Iraqis.|$|R
5000|$|The twenty-five-foot train posed problems. According to writer Andrew Morton, in Diana: Her True Story, the gown's {{designers}} realized {{too late}} {{that they had}} forgotten {{to allow for the}} train's length in relation {{to the size of the}} glass coach Diana and her father rode in to the ceremony. They found it difficult to fit inside the glass coach, and the train was badly <b>crushed</b> despite Diana's <b>efforts.</b> This accounted for the visible wrinkles in the wedding gown when she arrived at the cathedral. Diana also had a spare wedding dress, which would have acted as a stand-in if the dress' design was revealed before her big day.|$|R
60|$|With {{regard to}} {{the conduct of the}} last canto, there will be found less of the pilgrim than in any of the preceding, and that little slightly, if at all, {{separated}} from the author speaking in his own person. The fact is, that I had become weary of drawing a line which every one seemed determined not to perceive: like the Chinese in Goldsmith's Citizen of the World,[366] whom nobody would believe to be a Chinese, it was in vain that I asserted, and imagined that I had drawn, a distinction between the author and the pilgrim; and the very anxiety to preserve this difference, and disappointment at finding it unavailing, so far <b>crushed</b> my <b>efforts</b> in the composition, that I determined to abandon it altogether--and have done so. The opinions which have been, or may be, formed on that subject are now a matter of indifference: the work is to depend on itself, and not on the writer; and the author, who has no resources in his own mind beyond the reputation, transient or permanent, which is to arise from his literary efforts, deserves the fate of authors.|$|R

In {{the heart of the}} gigantic rocks of the Cassé Déserte, Bob is arced on his bicycle, his kidneys <b>crushed</b> by the <b>effort</b> and his head, like a heavy, painful balance, oscillates above his handlebars. The sun beats down on him. Around him, the whole mountain smokes like a giant witch's cauldron. As he breathes, what burns his throat and his lungs is the dust that rises around him... Abandoned, alone, without help, streaming with sweat, he has no other weapon against his adversaries but the mountain, the bad weather and his crazy willpower.|$|R
5000|$|The {{military}} {{force of the}} Earth Alliance is called EarthForce. EarthForce has the largest military {{of any of the}} younger races with some estimates and hull markings on Earthships pointing to EarthForce having over 20,000 ships during the Babylon 5 timeframe. EarthForce is the only race to have ever created a [...] "Super Soldier", which could move at incredible speeds and <b>crush</b> others without <b>effort.</b> EarthForce is also the only race to ever have built, and sustain massive amounts of shadow technology. EarthForce created the Omega-Shadow hybrid in season 4, and later on, in the Crusade, EarthForce had built a full blown shadow ship that fired the shadow slicer death ray. EarthForce had ships so powerful due to many black-ops projects and gaining shadow technology, that Earth arguably built the strongest ships of any of the younger races: the Warlock class destroyer and the Shadow Hybrid seen in Crusade.|$|R
40|$|Increasingly finding {{themselves}} in financial straitjackets, {{states have been}} turning to austerity measures, tax increases, privatization of services, and renegotiation of collective bargaining agreements. Absent a federal government bailout, however, states will also need debt relief if their debt burden becomes so <b>crushing</b> that reasonable <b>efforts</b> at fiscal reform will fail to avoid default. Some advocate providing this relief by, effectively, extending municipal bankruptcy law to states. That approach brings in excess baggage, however, engendering political opposition and constitutional concerns. There is a simpler solution: Enable states to work out their debt problems with their creditors. Although the main obstacle to a consensual debt restructuring {{is likely to be}} the creditor-holdout problem, this Article proposes a minimalist legal framework incorporating certain limited bankruptcy protections that would not only help states solve that problem, but would also can help address the political and constitutional concerns. The proposed minimalist framework also would enable a state to obtain needed liquidity during the debt-restructuring process. Although the federal government could provide this liquidity, the proposed framework would enable the liquidity source to be privatized...|$|R

5000|$|Barboncito {{was also}} known as “The Orator” and “Blessing Speaker, and did not {{participate}} in skirmishes amongst the Navajo and White people. In the 1850s, Barboncito was considered a mediator between the two conflicting groups, and proposed peace between them in order to prevent escalating warfare. Despite this, problems reigned on between the White people and the Navajo people. Navajos and whites fought over the grazing lands of Canyon Bonito near Fort Defiance, located in what is now {{the eastern part of the}} state of Arizona. The Navajos had let their horses graze in these pastures for centuries, but the newcomers also wanted the lands for their horses. In 1860, U.S. soldiers slaughtered a number of Navajo horses, leading the Navajos to raid army herds in order to replenish their losses. The White attack on Navajo horses forced Barboncito to take action. Barboncito led one-thousand men to Fort Defiance. Barboncito’s great efforts nearly won the Navajo the fort, but he and his team of warriors were driven off by the US Army into the Chuska Mountains, but there the United States’ forces could not withstand the Navajo hit and run attacks.Stalemated, Indians and whites sat down at a peace-council once again. Barboncito, Manuelito, Delgadito, Armijo, Herrero Grande, and 17 other chiefs met Colonel Edward R. S. Canby at Fort Fauntleroy, 35 miles south of Fort Defiance. They all agreed to the terms of a treaty in 1861. For a time, the Navajos and the whites tried to forge the bonds of friendship. Despite the treaty, an undercurrent of distrust caused conflict between the two groups to continue.The United States led an extensive campaign to [...] "burn-and-imprison" [...] the Navajos, administered by Colonel Christopher [...] "Kit" [...] Carson and Ute mercenaries, traditional enemies of the Navajos. Barboncito made peaceful overtures to General James H. Carleton, Carson's commanding officer, in 1862, but the assault against the Navajo people dragged on.Carson destroyed fields, orchards, and hogans—an earth-covered Navajo dwelling—and he confiscated cattle from the Continental Divide to the Colorado River. Though only 78 of the 12,000 Navajo people were killed, Carson's <b>efforts</b> <b>crushed</b> the Navajo spirit. By 1864, he had devastated Cañon de Chelly, hacking down thousands of peach trees and obliterating acres of corn fields. Eventually, a shortage of food and supplies forced the Navajos to surrender their sacred stronghold.In 1864 Barboncito was captured in his hometown of Canon de Chelly by troops under the command of Colonel Christopher “Kit” Carson. After experiencing the terrible conditions under Colonel Christopher “Kit” Carson, Barboncito escaped with about 500 followers in June 1865.That same year, the [...] "Long Walk" [...] began, in which 8,000 Navajo people—two-thirds of the entire tribe—were escorted by 2,400 soldiers across 300 miles to Bosque Redondo, New Mexico. Almost 200 of the Indians died en route. The remaining 4,000 Navajos escaped west with Manuelito, who eventually surrendered in 1866 (two months before Barboncito). Barboncito was the last Navajo chief to be captured and led to Bosque Redondo. Once he found conditions there worse than imagined, he escaped and returned to Cañon de Chelly, but he was recapturedIn 1868, Barboncito, Manuelito, and a delegation of chiefs traveled to Washington, D.C., after General Carleton had been transferred from Fort Sumner at Bosque Redondo and could no longer inflict his policies on the Navajo. Barboncito was granted great status by the whites—more authority than would have been accorded him by tribal custom. He played a leading role in negotiations with General William T. Sherman and Colonel Samuel F. Tappan, telling them that the creator of the Navajo people had warned the tribe never to go east of the Rio Grande River.|$|R
