40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{feasibility}} of the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) moving {{forward to the next}} step of economic integration, i. e. towards an ASEAN Customs Union (ACU) post- 2015. Effectively, the way to progress towards an ASEAN custom Union is by forming it among ASEAN- 9 members with Singapore maintaining its existing zero tariff against non-members, thereby creating a Partial ACU. Using applied general equilibrium modelling exercise based on GTAP, the findings suggest that there are potential net positive welfare gains to be collectively reaped by ASEAN if it moves from an AFTA to a partial ACU post- 2015. However, not all ASEAN members will individually gain from such an ACU and members may need to potentially devise a mechanism wherein some member country welfare losses in an ACU can be compensated by the members who gain. The paper argues that in spite of political economy challenges due to ASEAN’s unique characteristics and diversity in the levels of economic development among members, such a Partial ACU <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>considere...</b>|$|E
40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} to examine the location of oviposition by the phorid fly Megaselia halterata (Wood) (Diptera: Phoridae) in uncased and cased compost. Clearly, {{a majority of the}} gravid females choose oviposition sites directly after entering the top layer of the compost. In uncased compost, 60 % of all adults emerged from the top of four compost layers of equal thickness. When the compost was covered by a casing layer which was still uncolonized by Agaricus bisporus, oviposition was further concentrated in the top compost layer. In this situation, 91 % of all adults emerged from the top compost layer whereas only 1. 5 % emerged from the casing. When the casing layer was colonized by mushroom mycelium, 45 % of all adults emerged from the casing layer and 53 % emerged from the top compost layer. Further concentration in the top compost layer and the casing layer occurred as a result of upward migration of larvae. When compost was cased after oviposition, up to 43 % of all adults emerged from the casing layer. We concluded that in the control of phorid infestations with insect pathogenic nematodes, applications in uncased compost can be restricted to the upper compost layer. When compost and casing are filled simultaneously, nematode applications in the casing layer only <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>considere...</b>|$|E
40|$|In studies {{exploring}} the patient mixes of general practitioner (GP) trainees, gaps were repeatedly found, {{as there were}} disparities between the patient mixes of GP trainers and trainees. This reduces the opportunities of trainees to acquire enough competence. To investigate whether steering the patient mix can be effectuated by instructing medical receptionist, trainer and trainee, and to {{study the effects of}} this intervention on trainee's self-efficacy (SE) and knowledge. Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT). After a six-month basic registration period, 73 trainees were randomized. Patients with skin conditions and psychosocial conditions were actively assigned to trainees in the intervention group (n= 35) during two successive periods of three months. The patient mix was measured by extracting data from electronic patient records. Learning outcomes were measured by SE questionnaires and by a knowledge test. No increase was found in patient volume and diversity of the steered conditions in the intervention group as compared to the control group. However, the percentual increase of exposure to skin conditions was greater in the intervention group. No difference in skin SE and psychiatric knowledge was found. The increase of psychosocial SE was greater in the intervention group. In a regression analysis, patient volume {{was a significant predictor of}} both skin and psychosocial SE.

The reduction to four dimensions on a 2 -torus has an SL(2, Z) duality symmetry that acts non-trivially on the linearised gravity sector, interchanging the linearised Einstein equations and Bianchi identities and giving a self-duality between strong and weak coupling regimes.

40|$|The Dutch {{evidence-based}} guideline 'Treatment {{of breast}} cancer' has been revised, and {{integrated with the}} guideline 'Screening for and diagnosis of breast cancer'. The guideline {{can be found on}} www. oncoline. nl and on www. cbo. nl. The Internet programme 'Adjuvant!' (www. adjuvantonline. com) can be used to predict both the prognosis and the efficacy of systemic adjuvant therapy for each patient. The indications for adjuvant chemotherapy and endocrine therapy have been widened. The aim is to reduce the absolute probability of death by at least 4 - 5 % within 10 years. The goal of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in operable breast cancer is to enable breast-conserving therapy for large tumours in relatively small breasts. One could consider transferring responsibility for follow-up after 5 years from the hospital to the screening organisation following mastectomy, to the family doctor following breast-conserving therapy, and to an outpatient clinic for hereditary tumours in carriers of gene mutation.

In order to evaluate the antiprotozoal activity of the chloroform extract of Carica papaya seeds during the subacute and chronic phase of infection of Trypanosoma cruzi, doses of 50 and 75 mg/kg were evaluated during the subacute phase, including a mixture of their main components (oleic, palmitic, and stearic acids). Subsequently, doses of 50 and 75 mg/kg in mice during the chronic phase of infection (100 dpi) were also evaluated. It was found that chloroform extract was able to reduce the amastigote nests numbers during the subacute phase in 55. 5 and 69. 7 % (P> 0. 05) {{as well as in}} 56. 45 % in animals treated with the mixture of fatty acids. Moreover, the experimental groups treated with 50 and 75 mg/kg during the chronic phase of the infection showed a significant reduction of 46. 8 and 53. 13 % respectively (P < 0. 05). It is recommended to carry out more studies to determine if higher doses of chloroformic extract or its administration in combination with other antichagasic drugs allows a better response over the intracellular stage of T. cruzi in infected animal models and determine if the chloroform extract of C. papaya <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>considere...</b>|$|E
40|$|Endodontic {{surgery is}} an {{alternative}} therapeutic approach to endodontic treatment. The outcome of the technique is affected by several factors, some {{of which can be}} eliminated by the use of a dental operating microscope. The microscope was used during the performance of 50 apicoectomies, with or without retrograde fillings. For clinical evaluation cases treated with the dental operating microscope were compared to cases treated without it. The postoperative evaluation showed a reduced incidence of symptoms in the cases treated with the dental operating microscope. More important, the dental operating microscope enhanced and facilitated each phase of endodontic surgery. Its use is highly recommended. (ORAL SURG ORAL MED ORAL PATHOL 1993; 75 : 751 - 8) There is no universal agreement on the precise definition of an endodontic treatment failure. Bender et al. ', 2 have proposed criteria for successful treatment, on the basis of clinical, radiologic, and histologic findings. These criteria have been widely accepted. Surgical intervention is a complementary therapeutic approach used when conventional orthograde root canal treatment fails to lead to regression of the pathosis. A surgical approach is also indicated when it is not opportune to try a conventional retreatment. Compared with the results of orthograde root canal treatment, long-te m resul s after endodontic surgery appear to indicate that the percentages of successful treatment decrease. Persson 3 clinically and radiologically evaluated the results of 241 teeth treated with apicoectomy after failure of conventional endodontic treatment.

40|$|Italy is {{considered}} at low incidence of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), and {{the occurrence of}} human cases of TBE appears to be geographically restricted to the north east of the country. However, most information to date derives from case series, with no systematic data collection. To estimate incidence rates (IR) and spatial distribution of TBE cases, we conducted a retrospective study in north-eastern Italy. Data were collected through the infectious disease units and public health districts of three regions (Friuli Venezia Giulia, Trentino Alto Adige and Veneto) between 2000 and 2013. Overall, 367 cases were identified (IR: 0. 38 / 100, 000). The cases' median age was 56 years and 257 (70 %) were male. Central nervous system involvement was reported in 307 cases (84 %). Annual fluctuations in case numbers occurred, with peaks in 2006 and in 2013, when 44 and 42 cases were respectively observed. A strong seasonality effect was noted, with {{the highest number of}} cases in July. In terms of geographical location, three main endemic foci with high TBE IR (> 10 / 100, 000) were identified in three provinces, namely Belluno (Veneto region), Udine (Friuli Venezia Giulia) and Trento (Trentino Alto-Adige). When investigating the whole study area in terms of altitude, the IR between 400 and 600 [*]m was greater (2. 41 / 100, 000) than at other altitudes (p< 0. 01). In conclusion, the incidence of TBE in Italy is relatively low, even considering only the three known affected regions. However, three endemic foci at high risk were identified. In these areas, where the risk of TBEV infection is likely high, more active offer of TBE vaccination <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>considere...</b>|$|E

40|$|To {{compare the}} effects of {{different}} colloid plasma substitutes on blood coagulation and postoperative blood loss. Relevant studies {{were obtained from the}} medical literature. Articles were selected that provided data on {{the effects of}} colloids on hemostasis and postoperative blood loss in humans. Studies comparing different colloids were looked for using MEDLINE and by searching through the references of studies as they were collected. Articles were reviewed and relevant data were extracted and partly presented in comparative tables. Dextran, gelatin, and hydroxyethyl starch (HES) all can induce a specific decrease of von Willebrand factor and factor VIII:c. Blood coagulation is most impaired by dextran and high molecular weight HES, both associated with increased postoperative blood loss. The effects of HES on blood coagulation have been shown to depend on its molecular weight and rate of elimination. Detrimental effects have been shown for high molecular weight HES. Medium molecular weight (MMW) -HES {{with a high degree of}} substitution (HES 200 / 0. 62) and MMW-HES with high C 2 /C 6 hydroxyethylation ratio (HES 200 / 0. 5 / 13) are slowly degradable and have been shown to impair blood coagulation after repeated administration. Rapidly degradable HES 200 / 0. 5 / 6 and gelatin-based plasma expanders appear not to impair hemostasis. However, based on the reviewed literature, all artificial colloids could potentially induce increased bleeding tendency after infusion of very large volumes and especially when given to patients with even mild forms of von Willebrand disease.
