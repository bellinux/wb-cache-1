5|$|There was {{an element}} naming {{controversy}} {{as to what}} the elements from 104 to 106 were to be called; the IUPAC adopted unnilseptium (symbol Uns) as a temporary, systematic element name for this element. In 1994 a committee of IUPAC recommended that element 107 be named bohrium, not nielsbohrium, since there was no precedence for using a scientist's <b>complete</b> <b>name</b> in the naming of an element. This was opposed by the discoverers as there was some concern that the name might be confused with boron and in particular the distinguishing of the names of their respective oxyanions, bohrate and borate. The matter was handed to the Danish branch of IUPAC which, despite this, voted in favour of the name bohrium, and thus the name bohrium for element 107 was recognized internationally in 1997. It was subsequently decided that oxyanions of bohrium should be called bohriates to avoid confusion.|$|E

Each assembly consists {{of one or more}} files, one of which must contain a manifest bearing the metadata for the assembly. The <b>complete</b> <b>name</b> of an assembly (not {{to be confused with the}} file name on disk) contains its simple text name, version number, culture, and public key token.

25|$|On {{the eastern}} part of Dasmariñas, we can find Barangay Burol which is 3 {{kilometers}} away from the city center. The <b>complete</b> <b>name</b> of barrio Burol is Pansol-Burol. Pansol is a Tagalog word meaning aqueduct, while Burol, also a native word, means mound. Even though there are no historical records about its establishment, {{it is safe to say}} that it was formed during the Spanish period due to the presence of ruins of old Spanish houses and sugarmills. The families of Quillao and Beltran are the first ones to settle in this place. This barangay became the hide-out of the Katipuneros/revolucionarios. During the Japanese occupation, there are some Dasmarineños who were killed in this place. They were Alfredo Purificacion, Pedro Calupad, Jose Yñota, Victor de Jesus and Angel Olaes. The Japanese soldiers also planted several cotton trees on the area. Now, this place is considered one of the richest barangay in Dasmariñas. Many schools and colleges can be found here such as the Southern Luzon College, International English Center, Asian Trinity School, and many others. Adjacent to the place is the Emilio Aguinaldo College. Numerous subdivisions and villages are also located here.|$|E

500|$|Gaara's backstory {{became one}} of Kishimoto's {{favorite}} stories from Part I; Kishimoto had to revise his illustrations in such chapters as he wanted readers to understand more of Gaara's mental state. The character was originally {{going to be called}} Kotarou Fuuma, but Kishimoto's editor highly refused to give him that name. As a result, he was given the name Gaara why he felt more suitable to the fact he always uses sand. By 2013, Kishimoto stated he still did not understand why such name was discarded. Nevertheless, he refrained from giving him of giving him a <b>complete</b> <b>name</b> like Gaara Yuzawa. Another early name was a younger child named [...] "Kumomaru" [...] but was avoided by Kishimoto. However, after multiple changes, he became Gaara. Due to his importance in the manga as a result of being Naruto's foil, Kishimoto added the kanji for [...] "love" [...] in his head to complement his name (part of Gaara's name can be read as [...] "love").|$|E

40|$|Network {{renumbering}} in the IP {{world is}} a complicated and expensive procedure {{that has to be}} carefully planned and executed to avoid routing, security (firewall, ACLs) and transport connection integrity problems. The source of most of these issues is in the lack of a <b>complete</b> <b>naming</b> and addressing architecture in the TCP/IP protocol suite. This paper analyses the issues related to IP networks renumbering, identifying its root causes. Then it looks into how these issues affect renumbering in networks based on RINA, a network architecture with a <b>complete</b> <b>naming</b> scheme. Theoretical analysis backed up by experimentation results indicate that renumbering in RINA networks not only is seamless (can be done without impacting existing flows) but also does not require any special mechanisms...|$|R

2500|$|It seems though, that Huni {{undertook}} some building projects.

[...] This is always written with initial upper case and without a separating comma. This practice is rare in Portugal but common in Brazil. Although infrequent, one can find people with the suffixes Sobrinho Neto (grandnephew, literally meaning [...] "nephew grandson") and Bisneto (great-grandson). Even rarer is the use of the further suffixes such as Sobrinho Bisneto (great-grandnephew, literally meaning [...] "nephew great-grandson") and Trineto (great-great-grandson). Further-distant suffixes are almost never seen, but include Tetra Neto (great-great-great-grandson) and Penta Neto (great-great-great-great-grandson) as well as Sobrinho Trineto and Sobrinho Tetra Neto. These conventions are much less common for female names. Roman numerals, such as II, III, IV, etc. for son, grandson, great-grandson, and great-great-grandson are not used, since the practice is not allowed by the law in Brazil and Portugal.|$|E
