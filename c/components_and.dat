Because of conflict between the Air Force and Navy over whose requirements had precedence, McNamara intervened in 1961, declaring that the Air Force desires would override suggestions by the Navy.

5|$|The {{electrostatic}} design does {{away with}} two major weaknesses of boxed speakers: enclosure colourations and signal degradation {{due to the}} crossover. The crossover in the ESL consists merely of resistors which work with the inherent capacitance of the speaker elements to obtain a first-order response. Because it is bipolar, {{both sides of the}} elements are not enclosed, but radiate directly into the air. Thus, colourations due to crossover <b>components</b> <b>and</b> box-induced reflections are minimised.|$|E
