40|$|An almost contact metric {{structure}} is parametrized by {{a section of}} an associated homogeneous fibre bundle, and conditions {{for this to be}} a harmonic section, and a harmonic map, are studied. These involve the <b>characteristic</b> vector <b>field,</b> and the almost complex structure in the contact subbundle. Several examples are given where the harmonic section equations reduce to those for the <b>characteristic</b> <b>field</b> to be a harmonic section of the unit tangent bundle. These include trans-Sasakian structures, and certain nearly cosymplectic structures. On the other hand, we obtain examples where the <b>characteristic</b> <b>field</b> is harmonic but the almost contact {{structure is}} not. Many of our examples are obtained by considering hypersurfaces of almost Hermitian manifolds, with the induced almost contact structure, and comparing the harmonic section equations for both structures.
