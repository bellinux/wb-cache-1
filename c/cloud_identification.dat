The comparison data was used with HIRS (high resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder) data from FIRE (First ISSCP Regional Experiment), CEPEX, and SCAR (Smoke Clouds, Aerosol and Radiation) {{data for the}} development of a two layer cloud CO 2 slicing algorithm and the development of multi-spectral cloud detection algorithms (specifically tri-spectral) for <b>cloud</b> <b>identification.</b> Regarding the latter, a clustering analysis was added to improve <b>cloud</b> <b>identification</b> within the scatter diagram of tri-spectral (8, 11, and 12 microns) brightness temperatures.

40|$|We present BIMA {{observations}} of a 2 ' {{field in the}} northeastern spiral arm of M 31. In this region we find six giant molecular clouds (GMCs) that have a mean diameter of 57 ± 13 pc, a mean velocity width of 6. 5 ± 1. 2 km s^(− 1), and a mean molecular mass of (3. 0 ± 1. 6) × 10 ^ 5 M☉. The peak brightness temperature of these clouds ranges from 1. 6 to 4. 2 K. We compare these clouds to clouds in M 33 observed by Wilson & Scoville using the OVRO millimeter array and some cloud complexes in the Milky Way observed by Dame and coworkers using the CfA 1. 2 m telescope. In order to properly compare the single-dish data to the spatially filtered interferometric data, we project several well-known Milky Way complexes to the distance of Andromeda and simulate their observation with the BIMA interferometer. We compare the simulated Milky Way clouds with the M 31 and M 33 data using the same <b>cloud</b> <b>identification</b> and analysis technique and find {{no significant differences in}} the cloud properties in all three galaxies. Thus, we conclude that previous claims of differences in the molecular cloud properties between these galaxies may have been due to differences in the choice of <b>cloud</b> <b>identification</b> techniques. With the upcoming CARMA telescope, individual molecular clouds may be studied in a variety of nearby galaxies. With ALMA, comprehensive GMC studies will be feasible {{at least as far as}} the Virgo cluster.

In the 0. 8 × 3. 6 kpc mosaicked region, we have detected six distinct, large complexes of molecular gas, most of which lie along the spiral arm dust lane or {{in the vicinity of}} HII regions. The mean properties of these complexes are as follows: D∼ 57 ± 13 pc, ∆V ∼ 6. 5 ± 1. 2 km s − 1, MCO∼ 3. 0 ± 1. 6 × 10 5 M ⊙, peak brightness temperatures∼ 1. 6 – 4. 2 K. We investigate the effects of spatial filtering on the quantitative comparison of Local Group and Milky Way giant molecular clouds properties and distributions. We also discuss different <b>cloud</b> <b>identification</b> techniques and their impact on derived cloud properties. When we employ the same <b>cloud</b> <b>identification</b> method and account for differences in data acquisition for M 31, Milky Way, and M 33, we find that the molecular cloud complexes in all three galaxies are similar.
