5|$|The Uruguay Round of GATT {{multilateral}} {{trade negotiations}} took place from 1986 to 1994, with 123 nations becoming party to agreements achieved throughout the negotiations. Among the achievements were trade liberalization in agricultural goods and textiles, the General Agreement on Trade in Services, and agreements on intellectual property rights issues. The key manifestation of this round was the Marrakech Agreement signed in April 1994, which established the World Trade Organization (WTO). The WTO is a chartered multilateral trade organization, charged with continuing the GATT mandate to promote trade, govern trade relations, and prevent damaging trade practices or policies. It became operational in January 1995. Compared with its GATT secretariat predecessor, the WTO features an improved mechanism for settling trade disputes since the organization is membership-based and not dependent on consensus as in traditional trade negotiations. This function was designed to address prior weaknesses, whereby parties in dispute would invoke delays, obstruct negotiations, or fall back on weak enforcement. In 1997, WTO members reached an agreement which committed to softer restrictions on commercial financial services, including banking services, securities trading, and insurance services. These <b>commitments</b> <b>entered</b> <b>into</b> force in March 1999, consisting of 70 governments accounting for approximately 95% of worldwide financial services.|$|E

40|$|Traditional {{accounts}} {{in both the}} international law and international relations literature largely assume that great powers like the United States <b>enter</b> <b>into</b> international legal <b>commitments</b> in order to resolve global cooperative problems or to advance objective state interests. Contrary to these accounts, this Article suggests that an incumbent regime (or partisan elites within the regime) may often seek to use international legal commitments to overcome domestic obstacles to their narrow policy and electoral objectives. In this picture, an incumbent regime may deploy international law to expand the geographical scope of political conflict across borders in order to isolate the domestic political opposition and increase the influence of foreign groups or governments sympathetic to the regime 2 ̆ 7 s objectives. The political opposition may in turn seek to exploit {{the existence of a}} fragmented system of domestic institutions to thwart both the adoption and enforcement of any international law that strengthens the ruling regime and weakens its own position. Finally, this Article sketches a framework for predicting when distributive international legal commitments are likely to be sustainable across electoral cycles and when they are not. More specifically, the framework suggests that an international legal commitment is likely to be electorally sustainable when the veil of ignorance underlying the commitment is sufficiently thick; in other words, an international <b>commitment</b> <b>entered</b> <b>into</b> by a partisan regime has more staying power if it produces policy outcomes that are favored by some salient groups in the political opposition. The Article uses examples from the United States experience with human rights and international trade to illustrate how partisan dynamics between Republicans and Democrats has helped spawn and restrict the scope of international legal commitments...|$|R

That inconsistency suggests {{a path for}} further study into the variables that might be confounding this relationship. The main purpose {{of this research was}} to test the mediating effect of organisational commitment in the relationship between training and turnover intentions. A sample of 124 participants took part in this study. Training was initially found to have a significant inverse relationship with turnover intentions. However, when organisational <b>commitment</b> was <b>entered</b> <b>into</b> the model as a mediating variable, the effect of training on employee turnover intentions became insignificant, suggesting full mediation. The impact of training on turnover intentions is not straightforward, but works first through the effect of training on attitudes, that is on commitment. The results demonstrate the importance of increasing the commitment of employees to the organisation through training, which can help companies to reduce turnover intentions. PublishedN/...|$|R

40|$|Excerpt] The {{focus of}} this third Global Report on child labour under the {{follow-up}} to the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work is about honouring the commitments made in 2006 with {{the adoption of a}} Global Action Plan. The Action Plan set out time-bound targets for the elimination of child labour. Important obligations and <b>commitments</b> were <b>entered</b> <b>into</b> by ILO constituents. Four years is a short time to ensure major change, but it does, however, permit the Organization to take stock and gauge progress. In particular we need to know whether the world is on track to meeting the target of eliminating all the worst forms of child labour by 2016. To this end, this Global Report adopts the same four-part structure as the two previous Reports. Part I presents a dynamic global picture, updating global trends introduced in the 2006 Global Report and setting out progress in the ratification of ILO standards. Part II reviews the progress made in implementing the Global Action Plan. From this review, Part III examines key challenges and gaps that remain and how these can be addressed. Finally, Part IV sets out an agenda to accelerate progress towards meeting the 2016 target...|$|R

40|$|Yeast {{cells have}} {{developed}} complex mechanisms {{to cope with}} extracellular insults. An increase in external osmolarity leads to activation of the stress-activated protein kinase Hog 1, which is the main regulator of adaptive responses, such as gene expression and cell cycle progression, that are essential for cellular survival. Upon osmostress, the G 1 -to-S transition is regulated by Hog 1 through stabilization of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Sic 1 and the downregulation of G 1 cyclin expression by an unclear mechanism. Here, we show that Hog 1 interacts with and phosphorylates components of the core cell cycle transcriptional ma-chinery such asWhi 5 and the coregulator Msa 1. Phosphorylation of these two transcriptional regulators by Hog 1 is essential for inhibition of G 1 cyclin expression, for control of cell morphogenesis, and for maximal cell survival upon stress. The control of bothWhi 5 andMsa 1 by Hog 1 also revealed the necessity for proper coordination of budding and DNA replication. Thus, Hog 1 regulates G 1 cyclin transcription upon osmostress to ensure coherent passage through Start. Tight regulation of critical transitions through the cell cycle is aconserved characteristic from yeast to mammals. One such transition is the G 1 -to-S transition. In yeast cells, the <b>commitment</b> to <b>enter</b> <b>into</b> S phase, known as Start, is the point when the cyclin CLN gene and some CLB genes are strongly induced. Further-more, transcriptional positive-feedback loops govern this transi-tion (1 – 3). Two transcription factors are responsible for G 1 -spe...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the benefits {{as well as}} the adjustment problems resulting from the proposed accession of the member countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) to the World Trade Organisation (WTO). In the area of trade-related policies, the CIS countries will have to make strategic decisions on policy objectives that have so far been avoided. Necessary adjustments to specific policy instruments will be limited and mostly technical in nature. Similarly, current plans for regional integration among CIS countries are fundamentally in compliance with WTO rules. However, negotiating strategies should be carefully coordinated among CIS countries that are in a de facto, though not necessarily a de jure customs union. Systemic transformation, especially the imposition and further strengthening of financial discipline on formerly socialist enterprises through privatization and elimination of subsidies, will need to be carried forward vigorously. Benefits of WTO accession include the consolidation of recent improvements in market access and, above all else, greater credibility for market-oriented reform policies through the international <b>commitments</b> to be <b>entered</b> <b>into</b> by CIS governments with respect to future trade-related policies. ...|$|R
40|$|When the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) {{was formed}} in 1988, {{administration}} of Australia's major airports passed from a Government department to a corporatised entity. The FAC improved {{the performance of the}} airports sector and it broadened the revenue base through commercial and property development. By 1994, however, policy thinking shifted in favour of privatisation. So far, the Government has sold 17 of the FAC's 22 airports and it has received US$ 2. 6 billion (1998 / 99 values). Four of the remaining airports are in the Sydney region where there are on-going debates about an appropriate site for a second major airport. The paper describes the sales processes and presents details about the new owners, the <b>commitments</b> they have <b>entered</b> <b>into,</b> and the regulatory system that has been established for the post-privatisation era. Price-capping arrangements have been put into place for the major airports, but Australia also introduced legislation to ensure there is competitive access to essential infrastructure.

All the various regulations legally implementing the changes agreed {{can be found in the}} following sources. Comment: The sensitivity of the reform process faced in the sugar sector caused the Commission to refrain from submitting any specific proposals, preferring instead to put forward an 'options paper' for further political discussion. The degree of sensitivity is illustrated by the fact that the EU sugar industry's preferred option (the 'fixed quota' option) was not even mentioned in the Commission's press release since it is not seen as a viable option given the need for fundamental reform and the EU's existing international commitments. It should be borne in mind that the European Commission used the international <b>commitments</b> <b>entered</b> <b>into</b> by the EU under the EBA initiative to push through reforms in the rice sectors in 2003, reforms which only three years previously had been firmly resisted by member states under pressure from industry lobbies.

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} need for cost effective Earth Observation (EO) missions to meet the information requirements of an almost ever growing range of applications. This is perhaps most clearly seen in the many current moves for international co-operation {{in the field of}} environment where measurements from Earth Observing satellites are an essential element. This is especially so where we need to acquire, analyse and use data documenting the condition of the Earth's resources and environment on a long-term (permanent) basis.

40|$|The paper {{argues that}} WTO {{has not been}} {{functioning}} in a transparent manner and {{that the benefits of}} globalisation have not reached all countries. If Seattle is any indication, WTO is in fact 'a rich man's club'. Developed countries have been adopting the strategy of prying open the markets of developing countries while at the same time, erecting barriers that prevent access to markets in their countries to the products emanating from developing countries. In this regard, the paper looks at the 'new issues ' that developed countries are keen to introduce into the WTO agenda through a new round of negotiations and argues that these would act as 'disguised protection'. By themselves, each of these issues represents an area of concern and interest for the developing countries, such as, investment, competition policy, environment, electronic commerce, etc. However, their relationship with trade is complex and this needs to be comprehensively examined in the first instance. The paper argues that it would, therefore, be both premature and inappropriate to agree to the inclusion of these so-called 'new issues' into the WTO agenda and {{that it is important to}} first implement <b>commitments</b> <b>entered</b> <b>into</b> in earlier rounds before taking on board fresh commitments. Much, in other words, could in fact be lost by overloading the WTO agenda.
