25|$|Once a {{fault is}} detected, the circuit breaker {{contacts}} must open {{to interrupt the}} circuit; This is commonly done using mechanically stored energy contained within the breaker, such as a spring or compressed air to separate the contacts. Circuit breakers may also use the higher current caused by the fault to separate the contacts, such as thermal expansion or a magnetic field. Small circuit breakers typically have a manual <b>control</b> <b>lever</b> to switch off the load or reset a tripped breaker, while larger units use solenoids to trip the mechanism, and electric motors to restore energy to the springs.|$|E
25|$|The LCA {{had a long}} central {{well section}} fitted with three benches, one centre, one each port and starboard, for seating troops. The side benches were covered by the top deck. The well was divided from the bow by a {{bulkhead}} fitted with two vertically hinged doors. This pair of forward-opening armour-plate doors led to the ramp, which was lowered and raised by a simple arrangement of pulleys and wire. Two rollers on the leading outboard edge providing some freedom of movement for the ramp when it was grounded. Over this ramp troops could come ashore {{in two to three}} minutes, or less if the soldiers and crews were well trained. Immediately behind the bulkhead were the steering shelter on the starboard, and the Lewis gun shelter on the port. The steering shelter was fitted with a telegraph and voice pipe for communication with the stoker, a featherspray <b>control</b> <b>lever,</b> and a fold-up seat. The shelter was protected on all four sides by non-magnetic bulletproof plate surmounted by a hinged double-door roof. Most LCAs were fitted with a compass.|$|E

500|$|Powered turret {{traverse}} {{was provided}} by the variable speed Boehringer-Sturm L4S hydraulic motor, which was driven from the main engine by a secondary drive shaft. A high and a low speed setting was available to the gunner via a lever on his right. The turret could be rotated 360 degrees at 6º/second in low gear independent of engine rpm, at 19º/second — the same as with the Tiger I — [...] with the high speed setting and engine at 2000 rpm, and over 36º/second at the maximum allowable engine speed of 3000 rpm. The direction and speed of traverse were controlled by the gunner through foot pedals, or a <b>control</b> <b>lever</b> near his left arm. If power was lost, such as when the tank ran out of fuel, the turret could be slowly traversed by hand, assisted by the loader who had an additional wheel, which could manually turn the turret at one-half a degree per 360º turn.|$|E
500|$|On 8 November 1940 his Spitfire {{was badly}} damaged during a {{skirmish}} with several Bf 109s over Beachy Head in East Sussex. The Spitfire was so badly damaged that Lock crash-landed in a ploughed field, but {{was able to}} walk away. On 17 November 1940 No. 41 Squadron attacked a formation of 70 Bf 109s that were top cover for a bomber raid on London. After shooting down one Bf 109, and setting another on fire, Lock's Spitfire {{was hit by a}} volley of cannon shells, which severely injured Lock's right arm and both legs. The rounds also knocked the throttle permanently open by severing the <b>control</b> <b>lever.</b> The open throttle enabled the Spitfire to accelerate swiftly to , leaving the Bf 109s in his wake, without Lock having to attempt to operate it with his injured right arm. At [...] he began to descend and with little control and no means of slowing the fighter down, he could not execute a safe landing. [...] Too badly injured to parachute to safety Lock was in a perilous situation. After losing height to , Lock switched the engine off and found a suitable crash site near RAF Martlesham Heath, Suffolk, into which he glided the stricken fighter for a [...] "wheels down" [...] landing.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the most}} basic sense, {{headlight}} flashing {{is a way of}} attracting attention, for any of a number of purposes. [...] In this way, it can be perceived as the visual equivalent of blowing the horn, again for any of a number of reasons. [...] This equivalency is underscored by some car owner's manuals, which identify the steering column <b>control</b> <b>lever</b> which allows headlight flashing as the [...] "optical horn". Headlight flashing can be used simply to let other drivers know of one's presence, or as a response to acknowledge the presence or actions of other drivers. Some drivers flash their headlights as a signal that they are yielding the right of way to another driver, for example at an intersection controlled by stop signs.|$|E

2500|$|A MV-22B {{experienced}} an uncommanded engine acceleration while ground turning at Marine Corps Air Station New River, NC. Since the aircraft regulates power turbine speed with blade pitch, the reaction caused the aircraft to go airborne with the Torque <b>Control</b> <b>Lever</b> (TCL, or throttle) at idle. [...] The aircraft rose [...] {{into the air}} (initial estimates suggested 20 to 30 feet) and then {{fell to the ground}} causing damage its starboard wing; the damage was valued at approximately US$7 million. [...] It was later found that a miswired Cannon plug to one of the engine's two Full Authority Digital Engine Controls (FADEC) was the cause. The FADEC software was also modified to decrease the time needed for switching between the redundant FADECs to eliminate the possibility of a similar mishap occurring in the future. [...] The aircraft was found to be damaged beyond repair and in July 2009 stricken from Navy list.|$|E
2500|$|The Brazilian {{government}} bought 500 7.63mm M1932 Schnellfeuer machine pistols for the Policia Militar do Distrito Federal (Portuguese: [...] "Federal District Military Police") {{during the}} mid-1930s. The PASAM (Pistola Automática Semi-Automática Mauser, or [...] "Semi-Automatic / Automatic Military Pistol") used the M1932 as its base but {{made a few}} alterations. The controls {{were the same as}} the standard model, except the markings were in Portuguese. The selector switch (found on the left side, above the trigger guard) was marked N for Normal ("Normal" [...] for semi-automatic) and R for Rápido ("Rapid" [...] for fully automatic). The safety <b>control</b> <b>lever</b> (found {{to the left of the}} hammer) was marked S for Seguro ("Safe") and F for Fogo ("Fire"). It was used with Brazilian State Military Police (Polícia Militar) forces in the 1980s. They preferred to use it as a semi-automatic carbine and reserved its full-auto setting for emergencies due to its recoil and muzzle-climb.|$|E
2500|$|The 1948 Citroen 2CV was {{launched}} in France with a manual headlamp leveling system, controlled by the driver with a knob through a mechanical rod linkage. This allowed the driver to adjust the vertical aim of the headlamps {{to compensate for the}} passenger and cargo load in the vehicle. In 1954, Cibié introduced an automatic headlamp leveling system linked to the vehicle's suspension system to keep the headlamps correctly aimed regardless of vehicle load, without driver intervention. The first vehicle to be so equipped was the Panhard Dyna Z. Beginning in the 1970s, Germany and some other European countries began requiring remote-control headlamp leveling systems that permit the driver to lower the lamps' aim by means of a dashboard <b>control</b> <b>lever</b> or knob if the rear of the vehicle is weighted down with passengers or cargo, which would tend to raise the lamps' aim angle and create glare. Such systems typically use stepper motors at the headlamp and a rotary switch on the dash marked [...] "0", [...] "1", [...] "2", [...] "3" [...] for different beam heights, [...] "0" [...] being the [...] "normal" [...] (and highest) position for when the car is lightly loaded.|$|E

40|$|Applications {{executed}} on multicore {{embedded systems}} interact with system software [such as {{the operating system}} (OS) ] and hardware, leading to widely varying thermal profiles which accelerate some aging mechanisms, reducing the lifetime reliability. Effectively managing the temperature therefore requires: 1) autonomous detection of changes in application workload and 2) appropriate selection of <b>control</b> <b>levers</b> to manage thermal profiles of these workloads. In this paper, we propose a technique for workload change detection using density ratio-based statistical divergence between overlapping sliding windows of CPU performance statistics. This is integrated in a runtime approach for thermal management, which uses reinforcement learning to select workload-specific thermal <b>control</b> <b>levers</b> by sampling on-board thermal sensors. Identified <b>control</b> <b>levers</b> override the OSs native thread allocation decision and scale hardware voltage-frequency to improve average temperature, peak temperature, and thermal cycling. The proposed approach is validated through its implementation as a hierarchical runtime manager for Linux, with heuristic-based thread affinity selected from the upper hierarchy to reduce thermal cycling and learningbased voltage-frequency selected from the lower hierarchy to reduce average and peak temperatures. Experiments conducted with mobile, embedded, and high performance applications on ARM-based embedded systems demonstrate that the proposed approach increases workload change detection accuracy by an average 3. 4 ×, reducing the average temperature by 4 °C- 25 °C, peak temperature by 6 °C- 24 °C, and thermal cycling by 7 %- 35 % over state-of-the-art approaches...|$|R
