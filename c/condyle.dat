5|$|Physical {{examination}} often {{begins with}} {{examination of the}} patient's gait. In OCD of the knee, people may walk with the involved leg externally rotated {{in an attempt to}} avoid tibial spine impingement on the lateral aspect of the medial <b>condyle</b> of the femur.|$|E
5|$|Next, the {{examining}} physician may check for {{weakness of the}} quadriceps. This examination may reveal fluid in the joint, tenderness, and crepitus. The Wilson test is also useful in locating OCD lesions of the femoral <b>condyle.</b> The test is performed by slowly extending the knee from 90 degrees, maintaining internal rotation. Pain at 30 degrees of flexion and relief with tibial external rotation is indicative of OCD.|$|E
5|$|While OCD {{may affect}} any joint, the knee—specifically the medial femoral <b>condyle</b> in 75–85% of knee cases—tends {{to be the}} most {{commonly}} affected, and constitutes 75% of all cases. The elbow (specifically the capitulum of the humerus) is the second most affected joint with 6% of cases; the talar dome of the ankle represents 4% of cases. Less frequent locations include the patella, vertebrae, the femoral head, and the glenoid of the scapula.|$|E
40|$|CONTEXT: The {{occipital}} <b>condyles</b> of {{the skull}} articulate with the superior articular facets of the atlas vertebra and form an important junction between the cranium and the vertebral column. The morphological features of occipital <b>condyles</b> are relevant in biomechanical, anatomical and clinical studies. OBJECTIVE: To describe the anatomical profile of unusual occipital <b>condyles</b> detected in a bone specimen. CASE REPORT: The present osteological study provides a detailed morphological description of unusual occipital <b>condyles</b> showing uneven and serrated surfaces and also displaying longitudinal and transverse grooves {{on the left and}} right sides respectively. The case study also discusses the clinical importance of such anomalies. Precise anatomical knowledge of the occipital <b>condyles</b> is important for any craniovertebral operative procedures such as resection of the occipital <b>condyles...</b>|$|R
30|$|The post-surgical {{condylar}} position {{could also}} change {{due to the}} movement of the mandibular distal fragment in a forward or backward direction. According to Will et al., both <b>condyles</b> had a tendency to move superiorly in 41 patients who underwent mandibular advancement surgery using SSRO, and according to Freihofer and Petresevic, both <b>condyles</b> had a tendency to move anteriorly in 38 patients who underwent mandibular advancement surgery using SSRO [13, 14]. Harris et al. reported that when mandibular advancement surgery was performed, the <b>condyles</b> moved inferiorly, superiorly, and posteriorly, and rotated inferiorly, while Hu et al. reported that the <b>condyles</b> were displaced posteriorly and rotated anteriorly in 22 patients who underwent mandibular advancement surgery using SSRO [10, 15].|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{present and}} {{validate}} a semi-automatic segmentation protocol to enable an accurate 3 D {{reconstruction of the}} mandibular <b>condyles</b> using cone beam computed tomography (CBCT). Materials and Methods: Approval from the regional medical ethics review board was obtained for this study. Bilateral mandibular <b>condyles</b> in ten CBCT datasets of patients were segmented using the currently proposed semi-automatic segmentation protocol. This segmentation protocol combined 3 D region-growing and local thresholding algorithms. The segmentation {{of a total of}} twenty <b>condyles</b> was performed by two observers. The Dice-coefficient and distance map calculations were used to evaluate the accuracy and reproducibility of the segmented and 3 D rendered <b>condyles.</b> Results: The mean inter-observer Dice-coefficient was 0. 98 (range [0. 95 - 0. 99]). An average 90 th percentile distance of 0. 32 mm was found, indicating an excellent inter-observer similarity of the segmented and 3 D rendered <b>condyles.</b> No systematic errors were observed in the currently proposed segmentation protocol. Conclusion: The novel semi-automated segmentation protocol is an accurate and reproducible tool to segment and render <b>condyles</b> in 3 D. The implementation of this protocol in the clinical practice allows the CBCT to be used as an imaging modality for the quantitative analysis of condylar morphology...|$|R
5|$|In 2002, Coria and Currie {{found that}} various {{features}} of the rear part of the skull (such as the frontwards slope of the occiput and low and wide occipital <b>condyle)</b> indicate that Giganotosaurus {{would have had a}} good capability of moving the skull sideways in relation to the front neck vertebrae. These features may also have been related to the increased mass and length of the jaw muscles; the jaw articulation of Giganotosaurus and other carcharodontosaurids was moved hindwards to increase the length of the jaw musculature, enabling faster closure of the jaws, whereas tyrannosaurs increased the mass of the lower jaw musculature, to increase the power of their bite.|$|E
5|$|Physical {{examination}} typically reveals {{fluid in}} the joint, tenderness, and crepitus. The tenderness may initially spread, but often reverts to a well-defined focal point as the lesion progresses. Just as OCD shares symptoms with common maladies, acute osteochondral fracture {{has a similar}} presentation with tenderness in the affected joint, but is usually associated with a fatty hemarthrosis. Although {{there is no significant}} pathologic gait or characteristic alignment abnormality associated with OCD, the patient may walk with the involved leg externally rotated in an attempt to avoid tibial spine impingement on the lateral aspect of the medial <b>condyle</b> of the femur.|$|E
5|$|The {{species of}} Paraceratherium are mainly {{discernible}} through skull characteristics. P. bugtiense and P. orgosensis share {{features such as}} relatively slender maxillae and premaxillae, shallow skull roofs, mastoid-paroccipital processes that are relatively thin and placed back on the skull, a lambdoid crest, which extends less back, and an occipital <b>condyle</b> with a horizontal orientation. P. transouralicum has robust maxillae and premaxillae, upturned zygomata, domed frontal bones, thick mastoid-paroccipital processes, a lambdoid crest that extends back, and occipital condyles with a vertical orientation. P. orgosensis is distinguished from the other species by the larger size of its teeth, and distinct crochets of its molars.|$|E
40|$|Morphological {{changes of}} the <b>condyles</b> are often {{observed}} following orthognathic surgery. In addition to clinical assessment, radiographic evaluation of the <b>condyles</b> is required to distinguish the physiological condylar remodelling from pathological condylar resorption. The low contrast resolution and distortion of greyscale values in cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans have impeded an accurate three-dimensional (3 D) rendering of the <b>condyles.</b> The current study proposes a novel semi-automated method for 3 D rendering of <b>condyles</b> using CBCT datasets, and provides a clinical validation of this method. Ten patients were scanned using a standard CBCT scanning protocol. After defining the volume of interest, a greyscale cut-off value was selected to allow an automatic reconstruction of the condylar outline. The condylar contour was further enhanced manually by two independent observers to correct for the under- and over-contoured voxels. Volumetric measurements and surface distance maps of the <b>condyles</b> were computed. The mean within-observer and between-observer differences in condylar volume were 8. 62 mm(3) and 6. 13 mm(3), respectively. The mean discrepancy between intra- and inter-observer distance maps of the condylar surface was 0. 22 mm and 0. 13 mm, respectively. This novel method provides a reproducible tool for the 3 D rendering of <b>condyles,</b> allowing longitudinal follow-up and quantitative analysis of condylar changes following orthognathic surgery...|$|R
30|$|Adaptive {{developmental}} {{changes on}} mandibular <b>condyles</b> [16] and post-developmental degenerative changes of mandibular <b>condyles</b> can create alteration on facial skeleton and occlusion [17, 18]. Also, trauma or developmental deformity causing {{the changes in}} morphology and occlusion, can alter biomechanics of TMJ, consequently develop into TMJ internal derangement (TMD ID) [19].|$|R

5|$|The large orbit {{was shaped}} like an {{imperfect}} ellipse (with the longest axis {{from front to}} back), and faced {{to the side and}} slightly forward. The infratemporal fenestra (opening) behind the eye was narrow and sloped backwards, and the supratemporal fenestra on the top back of the skull was very reduced in size, due to the thickening of the frontoparietal. The basicranium (back part) of the skull was shortened and distanced from the regions below the orbits and around the palate. The occiput sloped backwards and down, and the occipital <b>condyle</b> was deflected in the same direction. The lacrimal bone formed the lower front margin of the orbit, and its surface had rows of node-like ornamentation. The prefrontal and palpebral bones were fused and formed a thick ridge above the orbit. The relatively large jugal bone formed the lower margin of the orbit, extending far forwards and down towards the jaw joint. It was ornamented with ridges and nodes in a radiating arrangement.|$|E
25|$|When the {{mandible}} {{is moved}} into a lateral excursion, the working side <b>condyle</b> (the <b>condyle</b> {{on the side of}} the mandible that moves outwards) only performs rotation (in the horizontal plane), while the balancing side <b>condyle</b> performs translation. During actual functional chewing, when the teeth are not only moved side to side, but also up and down when biting of the teeth is incorporated as well, rotation (in a vertical plane) also plays a part in both condyles.|$|E
25|$|A growth {{center is}} located in the head of each mandibular <b>condyle</b> before an {{individual}} reaches maturity. This growth center consists of hyaline cartilage underneath the periosteum on the articulating surface of the <b>condyle.</b> This is the last growth center of bone in the body and is multidirectional in its growth capacity, unlike a typical long bone. This area of cartilage within the bone grows in length by appositional growth as the individual grows to maturity. Over time, the cartilage is replaced by bone, using endochondral ossification. This mandibular growth center in the <b>condyle</b> allows the increased length of the mandible needed for the larger permanent teeth, {{as well as for the}} larger brain capacity of the adult. This growth of the mandible also influences the overall shape of the face, and thus is charted and referred to during orthodontic therapy. When an individual reaches full maturity, the growth center of bone within the <b>condyle</b> has disappeared.|$|E
40|$|Background: Juvenile {{osteochondritis}} dissecans (OCD) has {{a better}} prognosis than the adult type. Objective : We postulated that the excellent prognosis of juvenile OCD could be explained, at least in part, by the erroneous diagnosis of some developmental variants of ossification as stage-I OCD. Materials and methods : Knee MRIs of 38 children, ages 7. 5 – 17. 7  years (mean and median age 13  years), were retrospectively reviewed to look for features that might separate normal variants of ossification from stage-I OCD. These included age, gender, site, configuration of the lesion, residual cartilaginous model and presence of edema. Results : Twenty-three patients (32 <b>condyles)</b> had ossification defects with intact articular cartilage suggestive of stage-I lesions. No stage-II lesions were seen in the posterior femoral <b>condyles.</b> Accessory ossification centers were seen in 11 / 16 posterior <b>condyles</b> and 3 / 16 central <b>condyles.</b> Spiculation of existing ossification was seen in 12 / 16 posterior condylar lesions and 1 / 16 central <b>condyles.</b> There was a predominance of accessory ossifications and spiculations in the patients with 10 % or greater residual cartilaginous model. No edema signal greater than diaphyseal red-marrow signal {{was seen in the}} posterior <b>condyles.</b> Clinical follow-up ranged from 0. 5 to 38  months, with clinical improvement in 22 out of 23 patients. Conclusion : Inclusion of normal variants in the stage-I OCD category might explain, in part, the marked difference in published outcome between the juvenile and adult forms of OCD. Ossification defects in the posterior femoral <b>condyles</b> with intact overlying articular cartilage, accessory ossification centers, spiculation, residual cartilaginous model, and lack of bone-marrow edema are features of developmental variants rather than OCD...|$|R
30|$|TMD manifesting in {{a variety}} of symptoms, also can apply {{abnormal}} stress to mandibular <b>condyles</b> and affect its growth pattern of mandible. Thus, adaptive developmental changes on mandibular <b>condyles</b> and post-developmental degenerative changes of mandibular <b>condyles</b> can create alteration on facial skeleton and occlusion. The changes of facial skeleton in DFD patients following OGS have an impact on TMJ, masticatory musculature, and surrounding soft tissues, and the changes of TMJ symptoms. Maxillofacial surgeons must remind that any surgical procedures involving mandibular osteotomy can directly affect TMJ symptoms, thus pre-existing TMJ symptoms and diagnoses should be considered prior to treatment planning and OGS.|$|R

25|$|The {{articular}} disc is a fibrous {{extension of}} the capsule in between the two bones of the joint. The disc functions as articular surfaces against both the temporal bone and the condyles and divides the joint into two sections, as already described. It is biconcave in structure and attaches to the <b>condyle</b> medially and laterally. The anterior portion of the disc splits in the vertical dimension, coincident with the insertion of the superior head of the lateral pterygoid. The posterior portion also splits in the vertical dimension, and the area between the split continues posteriorly and {{is referred to as}} the retrodiscal tissue. Unlike the disc itself, this piece of connective tissue is vascular and innervated, and in some cases of anterior disc displacement, the pain felt during movement of the mandible is due to the <b>condyle</b> compressing this area against the articular surface of the temporal bone.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, {{a number of}} {{definitions}} of Reptilia were offered.

The animals singled out by these formulations, the amniotes other than the mammals and the birds, are still those considered reptiles today.|$|E
25|$|Mandibular {{fractures}} {{are typically}} {{the result of}} trauma. This can include a fall onto the chin or a hit from the side. Rarely they {{may be due to}} osteonecrosis or tumors in the bone. The most common area of fracture is at the <b>condyle</b> (36%), body (21%), angle (20%) and symphysis (14%). While a diagnosis can occasionally be made with plain X-ray, modern CT scans are more accurate.|$|E

Rotations of the <b>condyles</b> were assessed on axial MRIs. 16 adult patients with mandibular hypoplasia were studied. The mandibular plane angle (MPA) was 39 ° in Group II (n = 8). All mandibles were advanced with a bilateral sagittal split osteotomy (BSSO). In Group II, BSSO was combined with Le Fort I osteotomy. Pre and postoperative moment arms of MAS, MPM and bite force were used in a two-dimensional model to assess static loading of the <b>condyles.</b> Pre and postoperative data on muscle cross-sectional area, volume and direction were introduced in three-dimensional dynamic models of the masticatory system to assess the loading of the <b>condyles</b> during opening and closing. Postsurgically, small increases of static condylar loading were calculated. Dynamic loading decreased slightly. Minor rotations of the <b>condyles</b> were observed. The results {{do not support the}} idea that increased postoperative condylar loading is a serious cause for condylar resorption or relapse...|$|R

25|$|The {{most common}} {{disorder}} of a temporomandibular joint is disc displacement. In essence, {{this is when}} the articular disc, attached anteriorly to the superior head of the lateral pterygoid muscle and posteriorly to the retrodiscal tissue, moves out from between the <b>condyle</b> and the fossa, so that the mandible and temporal bone contact is made on {{something other than the}} articular disc. This, as explained above, is usually very painful, because unlike these adjacent tissues, the central portion of the disc contains no sensory innervation.|$|E
