5|$|<b>Critics</b> <b>also</b> note Flagg’s {{penchant for}} evil. Tony Magistrale, author of Stephen King: The Second Decade, Danse Macabre to The Dark Half sees Flagg as a Shakespearian villain {{comparing}} him to Iago, Edmund and Richard III, contending that Flagg is an antihero. Magistrale believes that Flagg’s evil {{is based on}} his ability to replace peace with conflict and unity with destruction; although he seeks power, it is merely a resource to achieve a greater level of destruction.|$|E

5|$|<b>Critics</b> <b>also</b> {{pointed out}} that the index could allow the city to reach lethally high levels of carbon {{monoxide}} without any alert if the levels of other pollutants remained low. However, the department had to contend with the fact that no universally accepted standards for recording smog existed at that time, and many of the flaws existed {{for lack of a better}} alternative. During the 1966 smog, one of the former commissioners said he would have readily adopted a better system, if one existed.|$|E

5|$|Reviewers {{complained of}} the game's high price, which was {{nearly double the}} average. Crash {{wondered}} if the cost might lead to more piracy. <b>Critics</b> <b>also</b> noted a bug in two-player mode, repeat screens from elsewhere in the maze, and the frustratingly narrow window in which sabre swings register as enemy hits. CVG recommended drawing {{a map of the}} maze, without which it was easy to get lost.

When Atticus is out of town, Jem locks a Sunday school classmate in the church basement with the furnace during a game of Shadrach. This prompts their black housekeeper Calpurnia to escort Scout and Jem to her church, which allows the children a glimpse into her personal life, as well as Tom Robinson's. Scout falls asleep during the Halloween pageant and makes a tardy entrance onstage, causing the audience to laugh uproariously. She is so distracted and embarrassed that she prefers to go home in her ham costume, which saves her life.|$|E

He also increased funding to human resources and continued his reorganization of the executive branch, creating cabinets for transportation, development, education and the arts, human resources, consumer protection and regulation, safety and justice. He was considered less ruthless than previous governors in firing state officials hired by the previous administration, and expanded the state merit system to cover some previously exempt state workers. Despite the expansion, he was criticized for the replacements he made, particularly that of the state personnel commissioner appointed during the Nunn administration. <b>Critics</b> <b>also</b> cited the fact that employees found qualified by the merit examination were still required to obtain political clearance before they were hired.|$|E

Music journalists and <b>critics</b> <b>also</b> noticed a dubstep influence in several pop artists' work. Around this time, producers also began to fuse elements of the original dubstep sound with other influences, creating fusion genres including future garage, the slower and more experimental post-dubstep, and the harsher electro house and heavy metal influenced brostep, the latter of which greatly contributed to dubstep's rising mainstream popularity in the United States.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Critic</b> <b>also</b> {{frequently}} {{made fun}} of celebrities, sometimes in mean-spirited ways. Drawn to Television cites the fat jokes directed at Marlon Brando or Orson Welles. The <b>Critic</b> <b>also</b> frequently comments on television. For example, one episode criticizes a character's project to colorize a series of classic black-and-white films for broadcast on a cable channel. The process involves making the films [...] "more attractive to a contemporary audience" [...] by [...] "inserting computer-generated happy endings." [...] The article [...] "Ten Frighteningly Prophetic Parodies from ‘The Critic’" [...] explores the show's spoofs that [...] "have come true (or close to true), proving that there really isn’t anything that’s too stupid for Hollywood to make" [...] — an almost meta-satirical statement in that things that the writer thought were too ridiculous to be true at the time, ended up coming to fruition.|$|R
5000|$|Private Eyes {{anonymous}} critic {{complained that}} each Gardner book takes [...] "Bond a further {{step or two}} away from the tall, resourceful ladykiller who first appeared in Casino Royale, and that [...] "the real Bond atmosphere has been dead for upwards of 30 years."

[...] "Gardner manages to remove most of the characteristics that made Bond interesting" [...] and that the book's explosions, throat-cuttings and neck-breakings, [...] "have an odd, perfunctory quality." [...] The novel, [...] "has none of Fleming's ability to build up tension or introduce detail casually. When Gardner talks knowledgeably about aircraft specifications the effect is only to reassure us that he has read the appropriate flight manual." [...] The <b>critic</b> <b>also</b> accuses Gardner of [...] "can't quite bring himself to take it seriously.|$|R
5|$|Windows 10 {{received}} mostly positive reviews {{upon its}} original release in July 2015; critics praised Microsoft's decision {{to provide a}} desktop-oriented interface in line with previous versions of Windows, contrasting the tablet-oriented approach of 8, although Windows 10's touch-oriented user interface mode was panned for containing regressions upon the touch-oriented interface of Windows 8. <b>Critics</b> <b>also</b> praised the improvements to Windows 10's bundled software over Windows 8.1, Xbox Live integration, {{as well as the}} functionality and capabilities of Cortana personal assistant and the replacement of Internet Explorer with Microsoft Edge. However, media outlets have been critical of changes to operating system behaviors, including mandatory update installation, privacy concerns over data collection performed by the OS for Microsoft and its partners, and the adware-like tactics used to promote the operating system on its release.|$|E

The Chicago Film Critics Association also ranked Jurassic Park as the 55th scariest movie of all time and, in 2005, Bravo chose the scene in which Lex and Tim are stalked by two raptors in the kitchen as the 95th scariest movie moment ever.

5|$|Local trade unions, Durham County Council, {{and even}} the Farmers' Union were {{in support of the}} scheme, along with a number of private persons, the general reason being that it would bring a new form of {{employment}} to the city and surrounding areas. Opponents to the station however claimed that the new jobs at the power station would go to specialist technicians brought into the region, and that the positioning of the station near Durham would not be beneficial to the city's electricity supply or make the cost of electricity any cheaper for those living near the station. <b>Critics</b> <b>also</b> claimed that wherever in the region a new power station were to be built, County Durham coal would be used in it, and that despite NESCo's claims, there may be more suitable sites elsewhere. The critics claimed that Durham's functioning as a cultural, educational, administrative and tourist centre, would be ultimately destroyed by heavy industrialisation.|$|E
