40|$|AbstractConstruction {{projects}} {{consist of}} numerous technological operations. The operations can be usually {{arranged in a}} considerable number of alternative ways satisfying induced technological order. Applied arrangement of operations defines project structure. A project structure influences results of <b>construction</b> <b>project</b> schedule optimisation. Identification of adequate structure for a <b>construction</b> <b>project</b> is therefore important for obtaining the best possible schedule. Effects of <b>construction</b> <b>project</b> execution depend on influence of surrounding environment. It is therefore necessary to include local conditions in a building site to derive a reliable <b>construction</b> <b>project</b> schedule. A problem of bi-criteria time-cost optimisation of a <b>construction</b> <b>project</b> structure is dealt with in the paper. Presented optimisation approach includes sensitivity of technological operations to adverse local weather conditions. It is capable of estimating robust Pareto-efficient structures and corresponding schedules for a <b>construction</b> <b>project.</b> Appropriate allocation of alternative execution modes to technological operations satisfying limited availability of manpower, building materials and equipment is applied in this regard...|$|R

Based on {{the study}} of the {{influencing}} law of decision point to cost in the construction process, this paper analyzes the relevance of decision procedure and project cost, establishes integration cost dynamic model of <b>construction</b> <b>project.</b> Based on the model, computer aided decision system can be developed for the cost control of <b>construction</b> <b>project.</b> If the system is applied in the construction practice, overall, whole process and dynamic control of <b>construction</b> <b>project</b> cost can be implemented. The connotation of integration cost dynamic model of <b>construction</b> <b>project</b> The cost of <b>construction</b> <b>project</b> is the total productive fees which happen during the construction process of contracted project. Therefore, the amount of the cost is bound to be influenced by the decisions made at the relevance decision points in construction process. The basic philosophy of integrated management is to establish links between these points and to realize the established aims through integrated plan and control[1]. Integration cost dynamic model of <b>construction</b> <b>project</b> refers to an expressing system for describing the movements of the cost of <b>construction</b> <b>project.</b> Meanwhile, it is also a bridge which links the productive fee influences from the relevance decision points in construction process. The establishment of the model contains four procedures. First of all, based o...|$|R
