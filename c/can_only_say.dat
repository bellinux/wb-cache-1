5|$|A {{soldier on}} {{vacation}} here said he witnessed a terrible atrocity {{in the occupied}} parts of Poland. He watched as naked Jewish {{men and women were}} placed in front of a long deep ditch and upon the order of the SS were shot by Ukrainians {{in the back of their}} heads and they fell into the ditch. Then the ditch was filled with dirt even as he could still hear screams coming from people still alive in the ditch. These inhuman atrocities were so terrible that some of the Ukrainians, who were used as tools, suffered nervous breakdowns. All the soldiers who had knowledge of these bestial actions of these Nazi sub-humans were of the opinion that the German people should be shaking in their shoes because of the coming retribution. There is no punishment that would be hard enough to be applied to these Nazi beasts. Of course, when the retribution comes, the innocent will have to suffer along with them. But because ninety-nine percent of the German population is guilty, directly or indirectly, for the present situation, we <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>say</b> that those who travel together will hang together. , Friedrich Kellner exhibit.

25|$|Acemoglu and Robinson {{counter that}} their theory distinguishes between {{political}} and economic institutions {{and that it is}} not political institutions that contribute to growth directly but economic institutions shaped by the political institutions. In the case of China, even though the political institutions on a higher level are far from inclusive, the incentive to reform Chinese economy does come from political institutions; in 1978 from Deng Xiaoping's Opening up policy {{at the end of the}} internal political feud during the Cultural Revolution. This exactly fits into the theory that the change in political institutions has shaped economic institutions and thus has influenced economic performance. This economic growth is further expected to shape the political institutions in China in the future. One <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>say</b> that China is an outlier to the theory when in the future China becomes as wealthy as U.S. or Germany but still remains an authoritarian regime.|$|E

500|$|This lack {{of convincing}} early {{evidence}} {{is the reason}} many recent historians exclude Arthur from their accounts of sub-Roman Britain. In the view of historian Thomas Charles-Edwards, [...] "at {{this stage of the}} enquiry, one <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>say</b> that there may well have been an historical Arthur [...] the historian can as yet say nothing of value about him". These modern admissions of ignorance are a relatively recent trend; earlier generations of historians were less sceptical. The historian John Morris made the putative reign of Arthur the organising principle of his history of sub-Roman Britain and Ireland, The Age of Arthur (1973). Even so, he found little to say about a historical Arthur.|$|E

5000|$|In other words, {{learning}} is a process by which a person gains specific knowledge, understanding of this knowledge, or a specific skill (ability).

Jillette was originally planning to do an episode of [...] based on Scientology, but Showtime prohibited him from doing so to avoid the possibility of legal action from the Church of Scientology.

500|$|Ramsey was vilified by {{the fans}} and press after the semi-final, with one Spurs {{director}} saying: [...] "Ramsey stupidly gave the goal away. He could have easily kicked {{the ball out of}} play." [...] Ramsey was publicly contrite—"I <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>say</b> I am terribly sorry", he told the Daily Express—but in the Spurs dressing room he analysed the move that had led to Mudie's goal and attempted to identify others as being at fault. This notwithstanding, [...] "for all his reluctance to accept the blame in front of his colleagues, Alf knew he had made a terrible error," [...] McKinstry writes. The error haunted him profoundly. It began to be speculated during the 1953–54 season that he might return to Southampton, who had been relegated to the Third Division South, in a role combining playing duties with coaching. He was not yet finished as a Spurs player, though; indeed in 1954, after Burgess left to join Swansea Town, he was appointed club captain.|$|E
500|$|Various {{authorities}} have treated the taxon {{as either a}} Boletus, Leccinum, or Tylopilus, depending on which morphological characteristics they deemed most significant. Rolf Singer initially considered the species most appropriately placed in Tylopilus {{on account of the}} reddish-brown spore print, a taxonomic opinion shared by Alexander H. Smith and Harry Thiers, who wrote [...] "Concerning whether or not the species should be placed in Leccinum, we <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>say</b> that the color of the stipe ornamentation is merely a reflection of the color of the stipe generally and that it does not change color in a characteristic pattern as it ages. For this reason we exclude it from Leccinum and agree with Singer that it is a Tylopilus." [...] Later however, Singer thought the somewhat scabrous ornamentation of the stipe justified a placement in Leccinum. René Pomerleau had previously (1959) placed the species in Leccinum, but this transfer was invalid, as no basionym was specified.|$|E

Scott compared Django to Tarantino's earlier Inglourious Basterds: [...] "Like Inglourious Basterds, Django Unchained is crazily entertaining, brazenly irresponsible and also ethically serious in a way that is entirely consistent with its playfulness." [...] Designating the film a Times [...] "critics" [...] pick, Scott said Django is [...] "a troubling and important movie about slavery and racism." [...] Filmmaker Michael Moore praised Django, tweeting that the movie [...] "is one of the best film satires ever.
