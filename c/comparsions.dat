40|$|Calculated LW radiances {{based on}} NMC {{profiles}} of temperature and humidities {{for the month}} of July 1985 are obtained using standard procedures for performing radiative transfer calculations, and are within 3 percent (against a standard deviation of 4 percent) for global daytime land <b>comparsions</b> and within 1 percent (against a standard deviation of 1. 5 percent) for a case study located over North America. The calculated values over the global data set show a slight trend with the surface temperature, and since there is no obvious trend with the column amount of water vapor, it is argued that the trend with temperature is evidence that absorption by other components (i. e., CO 2 O 3 and other trace gases not included in these calculations) in the model could be improved...|$|E

40|$|Our {{purpose in}} the present study is to compare {{personality}} structure of women from four occupational groups (teachers, research workers, actresses and business women). Personality structure was measured using the NEO Five-Factor Inventory based on five-factor model of personality. Five-factor model illustrates that personality consists of five relatively independent dimensions (Neuroticism,Extraversion, Openness to Experience, Agreeableness and Conscientiousness), which provide a meaningful taxonomy for studying individual differences. We supposed that personality structure of women from various occupational groups would differ. We found following statistically significant differences between women. Businesswomen scored significantly lower on Neuroticism and higher on Extraversion in <b>comparsion</b> with research workers, actresses, and teachers. Teachers scored significantly higher on Extraversion in <b>comparsion</b> with research workers. Teachers scored significantly lower on Openness to experience in <b>comparsion</b> with actreses and research workers. No significant differences on Agreeableness were found between groups of women.

40|$|A {{study is}} {{reported}} of heat transfer and airflow in an electronic module consisting of {{an array of}} narrowly spaced vertical circuit boards with highly-protruding com-ponents contained in a naturally vented chassis. A two-dimensional simulation model is developed that accounts for heat transfer by conduction, convection, and radiation, and sensitivity studies are performed. Experiments are conducted using a specially constructed test module. <b>Comparsions</b> with the experiments reveal the need to cal-ibrate the model by selecting an effective component height that represents the drag properties of the actual three-dimensional component geometry. The need to account in the model for heat losses in the depth direction is also discussed. The importance of accurate thermophysical properties and of multi-dimensional radiation is shown. Good agreement with measured velocities and local board temperatures is obtained {{over a wide range}} of power levels, and it is concluded that the calibrated model is capable of representing the thermal behavior of the present module. ...|$|E

Setting these stories within {{the historical and}} culture context of post-war Italy, it investigates their author’s commitment to expressing the “truth” {{of the experience of}} the Resistance through fiction. It argues that Fenoglio goes further than his neorealist contemporaries in attempting {{to do so in the}} manner in which he depicts a civil war rather than a war of liberation, and in his unsparingly harsh description of certain aspects of partisan behavior. The essay examines the relationship between Fenoglio’s life and his fiction, putting the case that we should draw clear distinctions between the two, without detracting from the truth of the latter. In conclusion, it draws <b>comparsions</b> between the early stories and Fenoglio’s later novel, Il partigiano Johnny, where the author was able to capture the heroic qualties of the Resistance alongside his depiction of all its contradictory aspects...|$|E

40|$|A Fast Delivery {{processor}} {{has been}} developed to provide GOME total ozone columns within 3 hours after observation. These near-real time ozone columns meets the growing demand for ozone products for purposes like assimilation in numerical weather prediction models and UV radiation forecasts. The FD processor uses Extracted GOME Instrument Header (EGOI) files, containing samples of the raw GOME data. Generally more than 95 % of the retrieved ozone columns are available for the end-users and on Internet within 3 hours after observation. The current FD level 1 -to- 2 processor (version 3) uses the DOAS retrieval method and is an improved version of the ESA/DLR GOME Data Processor (GDP) version 2. 7. The main modifications are {{the use of an}} effective ozone cross-section based on ECMWF temperature forecast for the slant column fit, the use of the DAK radiative transfer model and the Forruin and Kelder ozone climatology for the air mass factor calculations {{and the use of the}} FRESCO cloud algorithm. Due to these differences in the algorithms, the FD and GDP ozone columns differ considerably (up to 10 %). A pole-to-pole validation, involving <b>comparsions</b> with ground-based total ozone observations from about 25 NDSC sites, shows an average agreement within 1 - 4 % at middle latitudes. Around and in the tropics, the FD processor reports systematically higher ozone columns by about 5 %.

40|$|Ninety-three higher adult {{education}} chief administrators served as {{subjects in this}} study which was designed to test {{whether or not there was}} evidence of increased professionalization between 1957 and 1967. Utilizing Hall’s Professionalization Scales and some background scales to measure attitudinal and structural attributes of professionalization, an analysis of variance technique and a chi square analysis were used to determine the difference between the extent of professionalization of three cohorts of Ss. Findings revealed no significant change over time between the three cohorts at the. 05 significance level. The average scores in this study were higher than those reported in previous studies using the Professionalization Scales with other occupations. These unexpected findings were viewed as attributable, at least in part, to characteristics of the field of higher {{adult education}} during the past decade which mitigated against further professionalization of the occupation. Using a supplementary questionnaire, addi-tional <b>comparsions</b> were made between 93 respondents and a sample of the 143 non-respondents to the initial questionnaire. The differences were not significant. BACKGROUND During the past two decades the literature on higher adult educa-tion administration has indicated considerable concern about the extent of professionalization in the occupation. In 1957 a meeting of univer-sity adult education administrators was held in Chicago on the topic: &dquo;Evening College and Extension Administration as a Profession. &dquo; Fol-lowing this meeting, the Winter issue of Adult Education (1) had as its major theme the professionalization of adult educators in general, with two articles specifically on the professionalization of higher adult education administrators.

40|$|Nowadays, at {{the time}} of {{economic}} globalisation and the European labour market formation, it is possible to carry out different analyses which enable <b>comparsions</b> among enterprises from the geopolitical, economical and commercial point of view. In the paper we compare the level of employee motivation in the Slovak enterprises before the beginning of the economic crisis in 2008 and in 2013 when the impact of the crisis has already been felt intensely. The year 2008 was chosen as the starting point of the analyses since the level the level of motivation was not affected by the economic crisis. The reference period was the year 2013 when the crisis, {{on the basis of the}} macroeconomic indicators, continues. Basic research sample is formed by employees of the enterprises (manufacturing and non-manufacturing) operating in the Slovak Republic. Considering the size of the basic sample we could not analyse the motivation of each item of the basic sample. The random sampling was used to choose items from the basic sample. The motivation questionnaire was created on the basis of the knowledge acquired through the long- term research and through the communication with personnel clerks in the enterprises. Motivation factors that affect the employee productivity the most were used in the questionnaire. Following the sizes of selected samples and their independence we used a two-sample t-test to determine the signi fi cance. The null hypothesis testing about equality of means of individual motivation factors in the particular period of time was carried out at the signi fi cance level α = 0. 05. Following the results of analyses we state that employees need to stay motivated also from a long-term point of view. However, essential changes occur in order of importance. We can state that in the circumstances of changed motivation factors in the year 2008 and 2013 the motivation was affected by changes in economic situation and employees are focused on monetary incentives and relationship factors more...|$|E
40|$|Quantifying {{the vocal}} {{repertoire}} {{of a species}} is critical for subsequent analysis of signal functionality, geographic variation and social relevance. Vocalisations of free-ranging common dolphins (Delphinus sp) have not previously been described from New Zealand waters. Herein, I present the first quantitative analysis of whistle characteristics to be undertaken on the New Zealand population. Acoustic data were collected in the Hauraki Gulf, Auckland between February 2008 and May 2009, during surveys from the tour boat Dolphin Explorer. Data were collected from 28 independent dolphin groups using PZ- 1 A hydrophone and MZ-NH 700 digital audio disk. Recordings were analysed using Raven Pro 1. 3 and whistles classified into seven contours containing 29 subtypes. A total of 105. 1 minutes of recordings were collected involving 11, 715 whistles. Vocalisations of New Zealand common dolphins spanned 3. 2 to 23. 00 kHz, with most whistles occurring between 11 and 13 kHz. The shortest and longest whistles recorded were 0. 01 and 4. 00 s (mean = 0. 27, SD = 0. 32), respectively. Of the twelve whistle types recorded, 82 % have previously been recorded within U. K populations. Additional contours, apparently specific to New Zealand Delphinus were also identified. Of the 2, 663 whistles analysed, downsweeps (35. 9 %) were the most frequent whistle type, followed by upsweeps (28. 5 %), constant (16. 4 %) and sine (7. 0 %) contours. Concave and convex contours were least observed within the New Zealand population, accounting for just 6. 1 % each. Of all the whistle types identified in Hauraki Gulf common dolphins, the least modulated subtypes were the most prevalent. Data presented here offer a first insight into the whistle characteristics of New Zealand common dolphins. <b>Comparsions</b> with previously studied populations reveal marked differences in the whistle frequency and modulation of the New Zealand population. Inter-population differences suggest behaviour and the local environment likely {{play a role in}} shaping the vocal repertoire of this species...|$|E

While zinc is an {{essential}} element wich is indispensable for many physiological processes, cadmium in body acts as atissue toxin, that can cause oxidative stress and contribute to cancer development. Recent studies suggest that some species of tapeworms (Cestoda) and Acantocephala are able to absorb in their tissue higher quantity of heavy metals in <b>comparsion</b> with their hosts. Moreover {{it was observed that}} In connection with the increased accumulation of heavy metals in the tissue of tapeworm was decreased amounts of these metals in the organs of the host. The aim of this thesis was to investigate whether the rat tapevorm (Hymenolepis diminuta) causes a decrease in the concentration of Cd and Zn in the organs of rats. A total of 24 Wistar rats (Rattus norvegicus) were divided into 4 groups (n= 6). Groups PT and 0 P take increased doses of kadmium (3, 0 mg/week) and zinc (235, 7 mg/week) for six weeks. This increased intake was achieved by adding Arabidopis halleri to feed. After six weeks rats were killed and concentrations in their tissues (bone, muscle, testes, spleen, intestine, liver kidney) were analyzed. Subsequent statistical tests confirmed lower levels of Cd and Zn in some organs of rats infected with tapeworm compared to rats without infection. For example in kidney, liver ant intestine of infected rats was detected 2, 9; 2, 5 and 1, 8 times lower concentrations of cadmium and zinc in <b>comparsion</b> with uninfected rats.
