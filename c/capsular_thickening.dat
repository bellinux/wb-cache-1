40|$|The aims of {{the current}} study are to {{describe}} gadolinium-enhanced MRI features of an acute flare of established gouty arthritis in different joints and to examine a possible association between serum uric acid and MRI signs indicative of ongoing inflammation and/or structural joint damage as well as association with disease characteristics and laboratory findings. Twenty-seven male patients with established chronic gout agreed to participate, mean age 47. 6 years, and mean disease duration in months 43. 2 (± 31. 8). For all patients, detailed demographic, disease characteristics, and laboratory findings were obtained and correlated with MRI findings. In 27 patients with established gout, a total of 50 MRI studies were performed of the following joints: feet joints (n[*]=[*] 23), ankles (n[*]=[*] 18), knees (n[*]=[*] 5), and hand and wrist joints (n[*]=[*] 4). MRI revealed <b>capsular</b> <b>thickening</b> in 19 patients, bone marrow edema (BME) in 15, soft tissue edema (STE) in 20, joint effusion in 21, bone erosions in 17, cartilaginous erosions in 4, and tenosynovitis in 9 cases. In 17 cases, tophaceous lesions were found. Post contrast MRI showed synovial thickening in seven cases. Positive correlations were observed between serum uric acid levels and the following MRI findings: <b>capsular</b> <b>thickening</b> (r[*]=[*] 0. 552, p[*]=[*] 0. 003), BME (r[*]=[*] 0. 668, p[*]≤[*] 0. 0001), STE (r[*]=[*] 0. 559, p[*]=[*] 0. 002), and tenosynovitis (r[*]=[*] 0. 513, p[*]=[*] 0. 006). Using MRI in chronic gout, important features can be detected like BME, minute cartilaginous erosions, and hypertrophic synovial inflammation in post contrast MR images. Serum uric acid (SUA) was positively correlated with <b>capsular</b> <b>thickening,</b> BME, STE, and tenosynoviti...|$|E
30|$|The {{patient was}} staged with CT (Fig. 3 c). Many {{patients}} with BIA-ALCL have an effusion, mass or lymphadenopathy on CT evaluation [14]. Other findings can include irregularity of implant contour and <b>capsular</b> <b>thickening</b> [10, 14, 15]. The patient underwent bilateral implant removal, with bilateral capsulectomies. Subsequent PET/CT showed complete metabolic remission. Surprisingly, {{the patient had}} bilateral breast implantations the following year, despite being warned {{of the risk of}} BIA-ALCL recurrence. The patient is being closely monitored for evidence of relapse.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background: The {{lymphatic system}} as a key {{component}} in the organism's body can be affected by used drugs. Methylphenidate or Ritalin is widely used for treatment of behavioral disorders in children and some depressed people. This study carried out to examine the immunotoxic effects of Ritalin. Materials and Methods: A total of 16 healthy adult female mice were selected and randomly divided into a control and three experimental groups. The experimental groups received Ritalin as 0. 5, 5 and 50 mg/kg body weight and control groups received distillated water by gavage method for 21 consecutive days. At the end of experiment, the structure and function of the lymphoid organs were evaluated. Results were analyzed by ANOVA and Duncan’s test (p< 0. 05). Results: Significant alterations including {{a reduction in the}} size and number of lymphoid follicles, increasing in the megakaryocytes numbers as well as spleen <b>capsular</b> <b>thickens</b> were seen following Ritalin administration. The atrophy of the lymph nodes together with significant reduction in the number and size of lymph follicles but an increasing in the parenchyma hyperemia were seen. Also lymphocyte numbers increased while the monocytes numbers decreased (p< 0. 05). Conclusion: The consumption of Ritalin could be exerted detrimental effects on the lymphoid organs in the mouse model. ...|$|R

These lesions can have rim-enhancement after iv contrast administration. Biliary ducts dilatation is better depicted on cholangiographic sequences.

40|$|OBJECTIVE—The {{aim of this}} {{pictorial}} {{essay is}} to describe the sonographic guided approach to investigation and local injection therapy of a small joint in a patient with psoriatic arthritis (PA).  METHODS—Sonographic pictures are obtained using a high frequency ultrasonography apparatus equipped with a 13 -MHz transducer.  RESULTS—Ultrasonography allows a careful morphostructural assessment of soft tissue involvement in PA patients. Sonographic findings include joint cavity widening, <b>capsular</b> <b>thickening,</b> synovial proliferation, synovial fluid changes, tendon sheath widening. Ultrasound guided placement of the needle within the joint and injection of corticosteroid under sonographic control can be easily performed.  CONCLUSIONS—High frequency ultrasonography is a quick and safe procedure that allows a useful diagnostic and therapeutic approach in patients with arthritis of small joints. ...|$|E
30|$|The Segond {{fracture}} is {{a subtle}} avulsion fracture from the lateral tibial plateau at the combined attachment site of the iliotibial tract and the anterior oblique band. The anterior oblique band is a <b>capsular</b> <b>thickening</b> that joins the fibular collateral ligament to {{the rim of the}} lateral tibial plateau where it merges with posterior fibres of the iliotibial tract [37]. Nearly all patients with Segond fractures have ACL tears [38] or tibial spine avulsion which is mechanically equivalent in younger children (Fig.  1). The fracture is usually produced by internal rotation and varus stress at the knee [38], which differs from the usual axial rotation/valgus mechanism of ACL tears, likely accounting for its relative rarity. It is subtle on both MRI and radiographs.|$|E
30|$|Elbow {{stiffness}} following peri-articular {{injury is}} a debilitating condition, precluding patients from performing activities from daily living. In order {{for individuals to}} perform 90 % of their daily activities, such as bathing and eating independently, an arc of elbow motion of 100 degrees (30 ° extension to 130 ° flexion; 50 ° pronation to 50 ° supination) is necessary (Agarwal et al. 2017). Furthermore, {{it has been reported}} that a decrease in arc of elbow motion of only 50 %, results in an 80 % loss of elbow function (Morrey et al. 1981). As such, clinicians and basic scientists alike, aim to develop novel therapeutic interventions to prevent and treat elbow stiffness; thereby reducing patient morbidity. However, to date, no murine models have been developed which recapitulate the soft tissue pathology (fibrosis, <b>capsular</b> <b>thickening,</b> or heterotopic ossification) or the functional deficits (elbow stiffness) seen in patients clinically.|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{feasibility}} of delivering a large single dose of intraoperative radiation as an adjuvant to partial hepatic resection. Intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) was delivered to the remaining liver of 84 rats after partial hepatectomy to determine the acute and chronic effects of treatment on blood chemistry values, histology, survival, hepatic regeneration, and cellular appearance of the normal liver. Transient elevations in SGOT, SGPT, and alkaline phosphatase were attributed both to hepatectomy and to liver parenchymal damage induced by IORT. Microscopic examination upon necropsy, performed at frequent intervals post-treatment revealed hepatic <b>capsular</b> <b>thickening</b> with some alteration of liver architecture mainly underneath the capsule, with localized inflammation and some areas of necrosis. Survival in all groups was 100 % at 45 days. Liver weight increase proved to be dose-dependent and displayed a bisphasic pattern. This study demonstrated that IORT is a feasible adjunct to surgical resection of the liver in the rat model...|$|E
30|$|We found a {{demonstrable}} ALL in ten out of 11 specimens {{and in all}} specimens {{where an}} intact ACL was found. This fits with previous studies where this structure has been identified both through anatomical dissection [1, 3, 10, 13, 14, 22] and magnetic resonance imaging [1, 23, 24]. Our findings were that this tissue {{was a part of}} the anterolateral capsule and that, although consisting of obvious bands orientated obliquely and parallel (and which became tight during internal rotation and varus strain), defining the anterior and posterior boundaries was, at times, fairly arbitrary. Our observation that it is a <b>capsular</b> <b>thickening</b> supports previous work [1, 3, 21, 22] and, furthermore, corresponds to our identification of attachment to the lateral meniscus that has also been reported [1, 3, 10, 21]. In contrast, Dodds et al. suggested the presence of an independent structure separate to the capsule [13]. We were unable to find any evidence to support this finding and other authors have suggested that the structure that this group identified was the capsulo-osseous layer of the ITB [1].|$|E
40|$|Capsulosynovectomia genu {{anterior}} totalis {{was performed}} on five cases had marked hydrops and <b>capsular</b> <b>thickening</b> of joints, in which intraarticular injection of hydrocortisone or prednisolone, balneotherapy and hydrotherapy had been repeated in vain for long period with long standing pain and gradual decrease in motor function. The progress was observed for six to seventeen months after the operation, obtaining following results. Rheumatic symptoms were significantly improved after operation and restortion of function was also valuable. No exacerbations in the other joints and general condition were noted with rather improvement in the sign. Further, these operated joints became to react better, differ from preoperative, to balneotherapy and "Fango" with noticeable effects on the restoration of articular function. In histological findings of the resected synovia four cases showed Rs. and one Fr. by T. Kodama's classification. It is, therefore, recommended to appreciate this kind of operation on the cases shown no effects {{in the treatment of}} adrenocortical hormone or hot spring bath, which led to the decrease in gait ability, on the standpoint of medical rehabilitation...|$|E
40|$|In a {{retrospective}} study we have examined all diabetics (66 operated eyes) and {{an equal number}} of non-diabetic matched controls who underwent extracapsular cataract extracation (ECCE) with intraocular lens (IOL) implantation over a two-year period ending in December 1987. Of the diabetic patients' 76 % eyes improved by at least two lines of Snellen acuity postoperatively. Of these patients 68 % eyes and of the control eyes 83 % achieved an acuity of 6 / 12 or better. In the diabetics the visual outcome depended {{on the state of the}} retinopathy and in particular the maculopathy. The diabetic group had a greater incidence of postoperative inflammation, but the major complications were related to continuing neovascularisation. Early postoperative laser photocoagulation may help to prevent these proliferative complications, and, provided a large, adequate capsulotomy is performed for <b>capsular</b> <b>thickening,</b> the presence of an IOL does not interfere with this photocoagulation. We also advise early postoperative assessment, and treatment if necessary, of any maculopathy.

30|$|Stiff elbow {{can result}} from several {{different}} etiologies, including burns, trauma, spasticity, osteoarthritis, and septic arthritis. The most common of these is trauma to the elbow, in which intrinsic changes set causal conditions in motion. The mechanism of posttraumatic elbow contracture is intra-articular effusion, which induces the elbow joint to develop intra-articular adhesion and <b>capsular</b> <b>thickening,</b> limiting flexion, extension, and pronosupination, thus resulting in posttraumatic elbow stiffness, loss of motion, and considerable impairment in daily life. Established contractures should initially be treated with physical therapy and static progressive splinting. Patients who have failed a minimum of six months of nonsurgical management are candidates for a surgical approach [1 – 3]. Less invasive techniques for elbow contracture release have been developed {{in an effort to}} avoid excessive scarring and soft-tissue trauma, which may contribute to contracture recurrence. More recently, arthroscopic release of posttraumatic elbow stiffness has gained acceptance, and has been shown to lead to excellent restoration of elbow motion [4 – 7]. Arthroscopic surgery is a demanding procedure that requires great surgical expertise, and a high risk of severe neurovascular complications has been reported in the literature [4].|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} the study is to obtain dose {{guidelines}} for the delivery of intraoperative radiotherapy to the liver of patients with colorectal liver metastases. Following partial resection of the liver, a single high dose of 10, 20, 25, and 30 Gy intraoperative radiotherapy was applied to both the resection plane as well as a nonsurgically manipulated part of the liver of 25 beagles. The temporal sequence of histological and ultrastructural changes of these irradiated parts of the liver tissue was investigated. Methods and Materials: The feasibility of delivering single large dose of intraoperative electron beam radiotherapy to the normal and partially hepatectomized liver was experimentally investigated in a canine study. Results: There were no postoperative complications, no morbidity or mortality with a minimal follow-up of 1 year. Autopsy performed 3 months following irradiation showed only mild histopathological changes. One year following intraoperative radiotherapy more distinct histopathological changes consisting of <b>capsular</b> <b>thickening,</b> diffuse parenchymal fibrosis and subcapsular hepatocellular atrophy were found. The liver function remained intact. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that intraoperative radiotherapy to part of the liver in the canine model can be safely applied and doses up to 30 Gy are well tolerated...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The histopathological {{changes in}} the canine liver {{following}} single high-dose intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) were investigated {{in order to establish}} the tolerance of liver tissue to IORT, thus providing a framework for clinical IORT treatment of patients with metastatic disease to the liver. Materials and methods: Following partial resection of the liver, IORT in doses of 10, 20, 25, or 30 Gy was applied to the resection plane and a non-surgically manipulated part of the liver of 25 beagles. Results: There were no postoperative complications, and no morbidity or mortality during a maximal follow-up of 5 years. Dogs were killed at. 3 months, and 1, 2, 3 and 5 years folloning IORT. Light microscopic examination revealed <b>capsular</b> <b>thickening,</b> severe parenchymal fibrosis, liver cell atrophy, and bile duct proliferation at the irradiated area 1 - 2 years following IORT. At 3 - 5 years, however, only mild parenchymal changes were found that:consisted of slight periportal fibrosis, an incidental portal-central fibrous septum and vascular changes with endothelial proliferation and focal arteriolar hyalinosis. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that following partial hepatic resection, IORT to the liver in the canine model can be applied safely, without short- or long-term treatment morbidity. Although doses up to 30 Gy resulted in severe local tissue damage 1 - 2 years following IORT, these changes were largely reversible due to hepatic regeneration...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the feasibility of}} delivering a single large dose of intraoperative electron beam radiotherapy (IORT) to the liver of clinically normal and partially hepatectomized beagles, an experimental study was designed, The {{purpose of the study}} was to obtain dose guidelines for the delivery of IORT to the liver of human patients with colorectal cancer metastases to the liver, After partial resection of the liver, IORT in doses up to 30 Gy was applied to the resection plane as well as to a nonsurgically manipulated part of the liver of 25 beagles, The temporal sequence of histologic changes of these irradiated parts of the liver tissue was investigated, There were no postoperative complications and no morbidity or mortality associated with a minimal follow-up of 3 years, Necropsy performed 3 months after IORT revealed only mild histopathologic changes, One year after IORT, more distinct histopathologic changes consisting of <b>capsular</b> <b>thickening,</b> diffuse parenchymal fibrosis, and subcapsular hepatocellular atrophy were found, Three years after IORT, the parenchymal architecture seemed to be restored, although loss of liver tissue was definitive at the irradiation site; liver function remained intact, These results indicate that IORT to part of the liver in the canine model can be safely applied and that, although doses up to 30 Gy can result in severe local tissue damage, wound healing and liver function are not disturbed...|$|E
40|$|Learning Objectives: To {{review the}} {{classification}} of ankle impingement syndromes. To describe and illustrate the spectrum of appearance of ankle impingement syndromes using conventional radiography (CR), multidetector computed tomography (MDCT), ultrasonography (US), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and MR arthrography (MRA). Background: Ankle impingement syndromes are a spectrum of diseases common in both athletic and general population and depend on many causes that can be distinguished {{by the type of}} tissue which determines the conflict (bone, fibrous, synovial). In general, classification of ankle impingement syndromes takes into account the anatomical site relative to the tibio-tarsal joint, and thus they may be classified as anterior, antero-medial, antero-lateral, posterior and postero-medial. Imaging findings: CR alone already suffices to demonstrate a bone impingement in most cases, while there is necessity to use MDCT where the site of impingement is in an anatomical site not clearly demonstrable by CR {{because of the presence of}} superimposed structures. US has the ability to recognize the presence of an anterior impingement and it may assess tendon disorders (stenosing tenosynovitis) which may be an associate sign of an impingement syndrome. MRI is the method of choice to assess synovial or fibrous impingement syndromes thanks to its excellent contrast resolution. MRA is used when there is <b>capsular</b> <b>thickening</b> that could not be detected by simple MRI. Conclusion: Diagnostic imaging has a very important role in the recognition of the cause of impingement and of the anatomical site where such a conflict takes place, thus allowing a correct therapeutic management...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} a study (Zuckner, 1961) {{evaluating}} the therapeutic response of intra-articularly ad-ministered triamcinolone acetonide * (hereafter refer-red to as TActn) and triamcinolone diacetate* (TDac) suggested that large doses of these hormones had a profound systemic effect. The injection of either of these hormones in a dose of 100 mg. into a knee joint affected by rheumatoid arthritis resulted in a generalized anti-inflammatory response, includ-ing improvement in other inflamed joints {{as well as that}} injected. This generalized improvement usually persisted for 2 to 3 weeks. These favourable findings led to further study with these steroids, utilizing the more practical intramuscular route of administration. Procedure The acetonide and diacetate derivatives oftriamcinolone were injected intramuscularly into 36 patients with rheumatoid arthritis. There were 112 injections, 68 of TActn and 44 of TDac. The dose per injection was 100 mg. These steroids were compared with hydro-cortisone acetate (FAc) given by intramuscular injection in the same patients; there were seven injections of the 100 mg. dose of FAc, and eleven of 500 mg. Patients were examined once a week at first in most instances, less often later. Subjective improvement in pain and stiffness and objective evidence of tenderness, heat, swelling, range of motion, <b>capsular</b> <b>thickening,</b> and fluid in involved articulations were determined and an estimated composite percentage recorded.

30|$|In summary, we {{were able}} to {{identify}} a structure that corresponds to the most frequently described ALL. Our work supports that of Caterine et al. [1] who suggest that the ALL represents a <b>capsular</b> <b>thickening</b> similar to the glenohumeral ligaments seen in the shoulder. The dimensions of our specimen mirror this group and others’ [1, 3, 10, 22]. The tibial attachment is consistently seen to lie between GT and the FH, with the femoral origin matching the description of Caterine et al. [1], and lying around the LCL attachment to the lateral femoral epicondyle. It seems logical that, given the orientation of fibres in the ALL and the tightening of this structure during internal rotation of the tibia, this structure plays a role in restraining this abnormal movement. It follows that limiting the “pivot-shift”, by reconstructing the ALL, may have a role in preventing residual instability following intra-articular ACL reconstruction. However, it should be remembered that the majority of intra-articular reconstructions have an acceptable outcome. Thus, further work is required to define the role of additional extra-articular reconstruction and the ways of determining the patients who will benefit from this. Understanding the anatomy of the ALL (and the variations that exist) is pivotal to this work. This study, therefore, is important in adding to the current literature regarding the anatomy of the ALL. The development of a consensus about the attachments of this ligament is important so that reconstructions can recreate these and provide an anatomical restraint without over-constraining the lateral compartment. Choosing to recreate the attachment to the lateral meniscus may be of benefit, and selecting a graft tissue of a similar thickness may prevent complications. Following {{the results of this study}} (and those findings that match other work), it may be that, in selected cases (and perhaps revision), reconstruction of the ALL can be found to be of additional benefit to intra-articular ACL reconstruction.|$|E
