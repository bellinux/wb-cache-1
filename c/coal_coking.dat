The quarterly data of Australian dollar exchange rate with the US dollar, Australian <b>coking</b> <b>coal</b> price and the Australian <b>coking</b> <b>coal</b> export from 1992 – 2009 are employed to examine the relationships. This study reveals that the Australian <b>coking</b> <b>coal</b> export has positive relationships with the exchange rate of A$/US$ and price of Australian <b>coking</b> <b>coal.</b> This study finds that the Australian <b>coking</b> <b>coal</b> exporters lose revenues when the value of Australian dollar is high {{and at the same}} time, the Australian <b>coking</b> <b>coal</b> exporters earns more revenues from the higher price of Australian <b>coking</b> <b>coal.</b> The empirical results of this analysis confirm that for each one cent increase in Australian dollar value against the US$, the Australian <b>coking</b> <b>coal</b> export increases by 249, 724 tonnes and for each one dollar price increase of Australian <b>coking</b> <b>coal,</b> the Australian <b>coking</b> <b>coal</b> export increases by 10, 232 tonnes...|$|R

50|$|Chemically, {{anthracite}} may {{be considered}} as a transition stage between ordinary bituminous coal and graphite, produced by the more or less complete elimination of the volatile constituents of the former, and it is found most abundantly in areas that have been subjected to considerable stresses and pressures, such as the flanks of great mountain ranges. Anthracite is associated with strongly deformed sedimentary rocks that were subjected to higher pressures and temperatures (but short of metamorphic conditions) just as bituminous coal is generally associated with less deformed or flat-lying sedimentary rocks. For example, the compressed layers of anthracite that are deep mined in the folded Ridge and Valley Province of the Appalachian Mountains of the Coal Region of East-central Pennsylvania are extensions of the same layers of bituminous coal that are mined on the generally flat lying and undeformed sedimentary rocks further west on the Allegheny Plateau of Kentucky and West Virginia, Eastern Ohio, and Western Pennsylvania.

Like many writers of that time, Samuel indulged in hyperbole, but his love of the Cascades seems very genuine. Sometime in the period of 1876-78, four large coal veins were discovered and mined near a region known as Carbonado in the Cascade foothills. A small village formed and was named for Samuel after NP extended a rail line there from Tacoma in 1877. He was appointed secretary of the NP board in March 1869. The area became well known for its <b>coal</b> <b>coking</b> ovens as well as the natural sandstone formations that were the source of material for facing the new capitol in Olympia. At one time the town of Wilkeson had a population of about 3,000, but today it hovers around 400.

Both, the experimental data and obtained numerical results show that moisture content determines the coking process dynamics, lagging the temperature increase above the water steam evaporation temperature and in consequence the total coking time.

40|$|Thiocyanate is {{a common}} {{contaminant}} of the gold mining and <b>coal</b> <b>coking</b> industries for which biological degradation generally represents the most viable approach to remediation. Recent studies of thiocyanate-degrading bioreactor systems have revealed new information on the structure and metabolic activity of thiocyanate-degrading microbial consortia.

High throughput sequencing, DNA fingerprinting and targeted gene amplification have now elucidated the genetic and metabolic diversity of these complex microbial consortia. Specifically, this has highlighted the roles of key consortium members involved in sulfur oxidation and nitrification. New insights into the biogeochemical cycling of sulfur and nitrogen in bioreactor systems allow tailoring of the microbial metabolism towards meeting effluent composition requirements.

40|$|A {{coke oven}} battery is not {{considered}} as {{a significant source of}} PCDDs/PCDFs emissions; however, due to small amounts of chlorine in coal dioxins, dibenzofurans may be formed. The paper presents the attempts to determine the level of emission of PCDDs/PCDFs from the COB underfiring system and to confront the obtained results with the calculations based on the mass balance of chlorine in the coking process and reactions of both chlorophenols formation and PCDDs and PCDFs formation from mono- and polychlorophenols. There were PCDDs/PCDFs concentrations measured in flue gases from the underfiring system of two COBs at a Polish coking plant. The measurements included both an old and a new battery. The obtained concentrations of PCDDs/PCDFs were lower than reported in the literature (0. 5 - 1. 7 ng I-TEQ/tcoke), while the results for old COB were on average 3 times higher than for the new one. It was found that PCDD/F emission from COB underfiring system is insignificant and that PCDDs/PCDFs formation during <b>coal</b> <b>coking</b> should consider the mechanisms of their formation from mono- and polychlorophenols, as well as the influence of process parameters on the synthesis...|$|E
