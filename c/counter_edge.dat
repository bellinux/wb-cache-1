The mesh M does not self-intersect) {{and has no}} border (i. e. watertight. Geometrical and topological segmentation methods require a Boundary Representation (BRep) fromM. Building the BRep forM uniforms the triangle orientations, and makes explicit triangle and edge - <b>counter</b> <b>edge</b> adjacency. In the context of Reverse Engineering, the sub-meshes produced by the segmentation are subsequently used to fit parametric surfaces, which are in turn trimmed by the sub-mesh boundaries (forming FACEs). A Full Parametric Boundary Representation requires a seamless set of FACEs, to build watertight SHELLs. The fitting of parametric surfaces to the triangular sub-meshes (i. e. sub-mesh parameterization) requires quasi-developable sub-meshes. As a result, our geometric segmentation places 2 neighboring triangles in the same sub-mesh if their dihedral angle is for a small (angle between their triangle normal vectors is a small angle). On the other hand, our topological segmentation heuristic classifies triangles in a common sub-mesh if {{the value of the}} First eigenfunction of the triangulation graph Laplacian in these triangles falls in the same bin of a histogram formed with the eigenfunction values. The segmentation will obviously depend on the histogram bin distribution. The data sets processed indicate that geometrical segmentation is more convenient for mechanical parts with analytical surfaces. Conversely, topological segmentation works better for organic or artistic shapes. Future work is needed on the tuning of both the dihedral threshold (for geometrical segmentation) and on the bin distributions of the eigenfunction (for topological segmentation) ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{have made}} two {{significant}} discoveries in our {{recent studies of}} quiescent H-mode (QH-mode) plasmas in DIII-D. First, {{we have found that}} we can control the edge pedestal density and pressure by altering the edge particle transport through changes in the edge toroidal rotation. This allows us to adjust the edge operating point to be close to, but below the ELM stability boundary, maintaining the ELM-free state while allowing up to a factor of two increase in edge pressure. The ELM boundary is significantly higher in more strongly shaped plasmas, which broadens the operating space available for QH-mode and leads to improved core performance. Second, {{for the first time on}} any tokamak, we have created QH-mode plasmas with strong edge co-rotation; previous QH-modes in all tokamaks had <b>edge</b> <b>counter</b> rotation. This result demonstrates that <b>counter</b> NBI and <b>edge</b> <b>counter</b> rotation are not essential conditions for QH-mode. Both these investigations benefited from the edge stability predictions based on peeling-ballooning mode theory. The broadening of the ELM-stable region with plasma shaping is predicted by that theory. The theory has also been extended to provide a model for the edge harmonic oscillation (EHO) that regulates edge transport in the QH-mode. Many of the features of that theory agree with the experimental results reported either previously or in the present paper. One notable example is the prediction that co-rotating QH-mode is possible provided sufficient shear in the edge rotation can be created. 1...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} theory of the {{electron}} structure and the Zeeman effect for the helical edge states emerging in two-dimensional topological insulators based on HgTe/HgCdTe quantum wells with strong natural interface inversion asymmetry. The interface inversion asymmetry, reflecting the real atomistic structure of the quantum well, drastically modifies both bulk and edge states. For the in-plane magnetic field, this asymmetry leads to a strong anisotropy of the edge-state effective $g$-factor which becomes dependent on the edge orientation. The interface inversion asymmetry also couples the <b>counter</b> propagating <b>edge</b> states in the out-of-plane magnetic field leading {{to the opening of}} the gap in the edge-state spectrum by arbitrary small fields.

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{scattering}} behavior {{from a single}} non magnetic impurity in a helical liquid. A helical liquid is a one dimensional system {{with a pair of}} <b>counter</b> propagating <b>edge</b> states, which are time reversal partners. In the absence of a magnetic field, time reversal symmetry is conserved and hence single particle scattering is prohibited. However, multi particle processes are possible. We examine the backscattering current and noise, and derive the effective scattering charge. A magnetic field enhances the backscattered current, but reduces the effective scattering charge. We find that the scattering charge can vary between $e$ and $ 2 e$, depending on the strength of electron-electron interactions and the magnetic field. Comment: 9 + pages, 8 figure...|$|R

40|$|Two-dimensional topological {{insulators}} possess two <b>counter</b> propagating <b>edge</b> channels with op- posite spin direction. Recent experimental progress {{allowed to}} create ferromagnetic topological insulators realizing a quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) state. In the QAH state {{one of the}} two edge channels disappears due to the strong ferromagnetic exchange field. We investigate heterostuctures of topological insulators and ferromagnetic topological insulators by means of numerical transport calculations. We show that spin current flow in such heterostructures can be controlled with high fidelity. Specifically, we propose spintronic devices that are capable of creating, switching and de- tecting pure spin currents using the same technology. In these devices electrical currents are directly converted into spin currents, allowing a high conversion efficiency. Energy independent transport properties in combination with large bulk gaps in some topological insulator materials may allow operation even at room temperature. Comment: 9 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} algorithms for inserting monitoring code {{to profile}} and trace programs. These algorithms greatly {{reduce the cost}} of measuring programs with respect to the commonly used technique of placing code in each basic block. Program profiling counts the number of times each basic block in a program executes. Instruction tracing records the sequence of basic blocks traversed in a program execution. The algorithms optimize the placement of counting/tracing code with respect to the expected or measured frequency of each block or edge in a program’s control-flow graph. We have implemented the algorithms in a profiling/tracing tool, and they substantially reduce the overhead of profiling and tracing. We also define and study the hierarchy of profiling problems. These problems have two dimensions: what is profiled (i. e., vertices (basic blocks) or edges in a control-flow graph) and where the instrumentation code is placed (in blocks or along edges). We compare the optimal solutions to the profiling problems and describe a new profiling problem: basic-block profiling with <b>edge</b> <b>counters.</b> This problem is important because an optimal solution to any other profiling problem (for a given control-flow graph) is never better than an optimal solution to this problem. Unfortunately, finding an optimal placement of <b>edge</b> <b>counters</b> for vertex profiling appears to be...|$|R
40|$|InAs/GaSb heterojunctions form bipolar 2 -D layers {{due to the}} {{overlapping}} conduction and valence bands. Such systems have generated considerable interest recently due to the possibilities of gap formation by both excitonic and single particle interactions. The quantum Hall effect in this system shows a digital sequence oscillating from 0 - 1 - 0 conductance quanta and the diagonal resistivity, p. shows re-entrant insulating behaviour due {{to the formation of}} a total gap in the energy spectrum. The origin of the insulating behaviour is thought to be due to the formation of unusual <b>counter</b> propagating <b>edge</b> states where the electron and hole system interact to form closed loops which generate localised states. Cyclotron resonance on this system is found to show an increased effective mass when the electron and hole states approach each other physically and at high magnetic fields the resonances show large splittings which can be strongly temperature dependent...|$|R
40|$|We derive, {{from first}} principles, the {{complete}} Luttinger liquid theory of abelian quantum Hall edge states. This theory includes {{the effects of}} disorder and Coulomb interactions {{as well as the}} coupling to external electromagnetic fields. We introduce a theory of spatially separated (individually conserved) edge modes, find an enlarged dual symmetry and obtain a complete classification of quasiparticle operators and tunneling exponents. The chiral anomaly on the edge and Laughlin’s gauge argument are used to obtain unambiguously the Hall conductance. In resolving the problem of <b>counter</b> flowing <b>edge</b> modes, we find that the long range Coulomb interactions play a fundamental role. In order to set up a theory for arbitrary filling fractions ν we use the idea of a two dimensional network of percolating edge modes. We derive an effective, single mode Luttinger liquid theory for tunneling processes into the quantum Hall edge which yields a continuous tunneling exponent 1 /ν. The network approach is also used to re-derive the instanton vacuum or Q-theory for the plateau transitions...|$|R
40|$|It is well {{established}} that 'density reconstruction' {{at the edge of}} a two dimensional electron gas takes place for 'hole-conjugate' states in the fractional quantum Hall effect (such as ν= 2 / 3, 3 / 5, etc.). Such reconstruction leads, after equilibration between <b>counter</b> propagating <b>edge</b> channels, to a downstream chiral current edge mode accompanied by upstream chiral neutral modes (carrying energy without net charge). Short equilibration length prevented thus far observation of the counter propagating current channels - the hallmark of density reconstruction. Here, we provide evidence for such non-equilibrated counter-propagating current channels, in short regions (l= 4 μm and l= 0. 4 μm) of fractional filling ν= 2 / 3, and, unexpectedly, ν= 1 / 3, sandwiched between two regions of integer filling ν= 1. Rather than a two-terminal fractional conductance, the conductance exhibited a significant ascension towards unity quantum conductance (G_Q=e^ 2 /h) at or near the fractional plateaus. We attribute this conductance rise to the presence of a non-equilibrated downstream ν= 1 channel in the fractional short regions. Comment: 9 pages, 4 figures, supplemental materia...|$|R
40|$|The edge of spin un{{polarized}} or spin polarized ν= 2 / 3 fractional quantum Hall {{states is}} {{predicted by the}} effective theory to support a backward moving neutral mode {{in addition to a}} forward moving charge mode. We study this issue from a microscopic perspective where these states are identified with effective filling factor of 2 of composite fermions, but with an effective magnetic field that is antiparallel to the external field. A simple counting from the composite fermion description suggests that there might be two backward moving edge modes, but explicit calculations show that one of these is projected out of the low energy sector, while the remaining mode provides a good microscopic account of the actual <b>counter</b> propagating <b>edge</b> mode. The forward moving modes are identified as "Schur modes," obtained by multiplying the ground state wave function by the symmetric Schur polynomials.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{dissipative}} conductance of the zero-plateau quantum Hall state appearing in undoped graphene in strong magnetic fields.

At finite temperatures T, R_xx(T) exhibits a crossover from metallic to insulating behavior as K is tuned across a threshold K_MI. For T-> 0, R_xx in the intermediate regime K_MI<K<K_c is finite, but diverges as K approaches K_c. This model provides a natural interpretation of recent experiments.

40|$|The {{fractional}} quantum Hall effect (FQHE) is a canonical {{example of}} a topological phase in a correlated 2 D electron gas under strong magnetic field. While electric currents propagate as chiral downstream edge modes, chargeless upstream chiral neutral edge modes were recently observed only in hole-conjugate states (states filling ν, n+ 1 / 2 <ν<n+ 1, with n= 0, 1, 2, [...] .), and in the even denominator state ν= 5 / 2. It is believed that spontaneous 'density reconstruction' near {{the edges of the}} 2 D gas, leads to multiple <b>counter</b> propagating <b>edge</b> channels, being separated from each other by incompressible strips. Unavoidable disorder induces inter-channel tunneling; accompanied by Coulomb interaction it renormalizes the multiple edge channels to a downstream charge mode and upstream neutral edge mode(s), while maintaining the parity requirements (e. g., the heat conductance along the edge) dictated by the bulk. Here, we report of highly sensitive shot noise measurements that revealed unexpected presence of neutral modes in a variety of non-hole-conjugate fractional states. As already reported previously, we did not observe neutral modes in any of the integer states. In addition to the upstream neutral edge modes, we were surprised to find also neutral energy modes that propagate through the incompressible bulk. While along the edge, density reconstruction may account for the edge modes, we are not aware of a model that can account for the bulk modes. The proliferation of neutral modes, in every tested fractional state, changes drastically the accepted picture of FQHE states: an insulating bulk and 1 D chiral edge channels. The apparent ubiquitous presence of these energy modes may account for decoherence of fractional quasiparticles - preventing observation of coherent interference in the fractional regime...|$|R

40|$|Dedicated {{experiments}} on TF ripple {{effects on the}} performance of tokamak plasmas have been carried out at JET. The TF ripple was found to {{have a profound effect on}} the plasma rotation. The central Mach number, M, defined as the ratio of the rotation velocity and the thermal velocity, was found to drop as a function of TF ripple amplitude (3) from an average value of M = 0. 40 - 0. 55 for operations at the standard JET ripple of 6 = 0. 08 % to M = 0. 25 - 0. 40 for 6 = 0. 5 % and M = 0. 1 - 0. 3 for delta = 1 %. TF ripple effects should be considered when estimating the plasma rotation in ITER. With standard co-current injection of neutral beam injection (NBI), plasmas were found to rotate in the co-current direction. However, for higher TF ripple amplitudes (delta similar to 1 %) an area of counter rotation developed at the edge of the plasma, while the core kept its co-rotation. The <b>edge</b> <b>counter</b> rotation was found to depend, besides on the TF ripple amplitude, on the edge temperature. The observed reduction of toroidal plasma rotation with increasing TF ripple could partly be explained by TF ripple induced losses of energetic ions, injected by NBI. However, the calculated torque due to these losses was insufficient to explain the observed counter rotation and its scaling with edge parameters. It is suggested that additional TF ripple induced losses of thermal ions contribute to this effect...|$|R
