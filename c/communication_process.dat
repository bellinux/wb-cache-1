5|$|Nonviolent Communication (abbreviated NVC, {{also called}} Compassionate Communication or Collaborative Communication) is a <b>communication</b> <b>process</b> {{developed}} by Marshall Rosenberg {{beginning in the}} 1960s. It focuses on three aspects of communication: self-empathy (defined as a deep and compassionate awareness of one's own inner experience), empathy (defined as {{an understanding of the}} heart in which we see the beauty in the other person), and honest self-expression (defined as expressing oneself authentically {{in a way that is}} likely to inspire compassion in others).|$|E
5|$|I {{think it}} is {{important}} that people see that spirituality is at the base of Nonviolent Communication, and that they learn the mechanics of the process with that in mind. It's really a spiritual practice that I am trying to show as a way of life. Even though we don't mention this, people get seduced by the practice. Even if they practice this as a mechanical technique, they start to experience things between themselves and other people they weren't able to experience before. So eventually they come to the spirituality of the process. They begin to see that it's more than a <b>communication</b> <b>process</b> and realize it's really an attempt to manifest a certain spirituality.|$|E
25|$|The {{foundation}} of this theory is {{the concepts of}} text and conversation. Text {{is defined as the}} content of interaction, or what is said in an interaction. Text is the meaning made available to individuals through a face-to-face or electronic mode of communication. Conversation is defined as what is happening behaviorally between two or more participants in the <b>communication</b> <b>process.</b> Conversation is the exchange or interaction itself.|$|E

40|$|In {{this chapter}} {{a case study}} is presented, in which the ethnomethodological {{approach}} is {{used to analyze the}} impact of the implementation of an information system, called Sispes, on organizational <b>communication</b> <b>processes</b> in the residence for elderly Giovanelli (Italy). Sispes is a web based platform which sustains <b>communication</b> <b>processes</b> and knowledge management according to a customized workflow management system. Adopting structuration theories in the analysis of the case study, and taking inspiration from the philosophical tradition, especially in epistemology and in the analytic philosophy of law, an innovative perspective is adopted, which specifically acknowledges the role played by the <b>communication</b> <b>processes</b> in shaping both the attitudes of the involved actors and the social reality in which they are immersed. According to this perspective, three types of <b>communication</b> <b>processes</b> are presented, namely the normative, descriptive and constructive approach. These latter are then applied to a concrete case study. Technology and Organizational <b>Communication</b> <b>Processes...</b>|$|R

25|$|Cell {{signaling}} (cell signalling in British English) {{is part of}} any <b>communication</b> <b>process</b> {{that governs}} basic activities of cells and coordinates all cell actions. The ability of cells to perceive and correctly respond to their microenvironment {{is the basis of}} development, tissue repair, and immunity, as well as normal tissue homeostasis. Errors in signaling interactions and cellular information processing are responsible for diseases such as cancer, autoimmunity, and diabetes. By understanding cell signaling, diseases may be treated more effectively and, theoretically, artificial tissues may be created.|$|E

40|$|Physical environments of {{clinical}} settings {{play an important}} role in health <b>communication</b> <b>processes.</b> Effective medication management requires seamless communication among health professionals of different disciplines. This paper explores how physical environments affect <b>communication</b> <b>processes</b> for managing medications and patient safety in acute care hospital settings. Findings highlighted the impact of environmental interruptions on <b>communication</b> <b>processes</b> about medications. In response to frequent interruptions and limited space within working environments, nurses, doctors and pharmacists developed adaptive practices in the local clinical context. Communication difficulties were associated with the ward physical layout, the controlled drug key and the medication retrieving device. Health professionals should be provided with opportunities to discuss the effects of ward environments on medication <b>communication</b> <b>processes</b> and how this impacts medication safety.

2500|$|Another type of VEP {{used with}} {{applications}} is the P300 potential. The P300 event-related potential {{is a positive}} peak in the EEG that occurs at roughly 300 ms after {{the appearance of a}} target stimulus (a stimulus for which the user is waiting or seeking) or oddball stimuli. The P300 amplitude decreases as the target stimuli and the ignored stimuli grow more similar.The P300 is thought to be related to a higher level attention process or an orienting response Using P300 as a control scheme has the advantage of the participant only having to attend limited training sessions. The first application to use the P300 model was the P300 matrix. Within this system, a subject would choose a letter from a grid of 6 by 6 letters and numbers. The rows and columns of the grid flashed sequentially and every time the selected [...] "choice letter" [...] was illuminated the user's P300 was (potentially) elicited. However, the <b>communication</b> <b>process,</b> at approximately 17 characters per minute, was quite slow. The P300 is a BCI that offers a discrete selection rather than a continuous control mechanism. The advantage of P300 use within games is that the player does not have to teach himself/herself how to use a completely new control system and so only has to undertake short training instances, to learn the gameplay mechanics and basic use of the BCI paradigm.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY: The paper {{reports the}} results of a {{doctoral}} research which analyses the <b>communication</b> <b>processes</b> in building design teams specialised in airport passenger terminal projects working in Italy. The analysis is focused on the <b>communication</b> <b>processes</b> requirements and it was conducted using a structured questionnaire based on reference to a technical standard. The aim of the analysis was to define the basic elements to build a User Profile finalised to plan <b>communication</b> <b>processes</b> in a networked design team. The problem to be solved, structurally affects the Construction Industry where it is necessary to face the complex relationship within the design team, which comprises different organisations, based in various sites or counties and using different languages but, most importantly, being culturally different. The results of the field research show many interesting features: for example we found that certified quality standard organisations often do not plan, carry out checks and properly implement the <b>communication</b> <b>processes.</b> In brief we show evidence about the nonawareness of critical importance of <b>communication</b> <b>processes</b> and their impact on design quality. The so-called Access Era does not allow behaviour such as a Win-Win Strategy. The research aims to face the Design Gap as an identified industrial problem defining a method to draw a User Profile tool and start communicatio...|$|R

The concept of domain is a generalization of protocol layers and transit hops. MDCM includes end point resolution to map source and destination from one domain to the other, such as name/address resolutions, forwarding lookups, and content searching. MDCM integrates these aspects of <b>communication</b> <b>processes</b> and abstracts the core functionality into a simple, recursive model.
