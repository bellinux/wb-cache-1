This research includes {{the study of the}} mining method adopted at Bogala Graphite Mines and its suitability compared with other mining methods used in the mining industry. The mining method adopted in Bogala mines has been assessed through this study. It mainly focus on the rock mechanics and financial aspects with comparisons to the mining methods adhered by the Sri Lankan mining industry. The major graphite occurrence discovered more than hundred years has produced highly valued the world over. In Sri Lanka, graphite mineralizations occur in the form of rich veins with steep dips in the South-Western sector of the island, the vast stretch of area which has been famous for graphite mining with thousands of pits in operation during the high demand of the first and second world wars. Where an outcrop is encountered, a pit had been sunk and the steeply dipping vein had been followed to the depths. At Bogala mines, the adoption of Overhand Cut-and-Fill mining method is influenced by the steeply dipping vein environment with rock intercalations and high water inflows with less <b>competent</b> <b>country</b> rock. Although cut–and–fill mining has been traditionally successful ensuring high recovery and safety, only limited studies has been carried out with an engineering input to evaluate this method. With the use of literature and site visits to Bogala mines, the mining method used at Bogala mines, the underground environment and the other mining methods used in the mining industry both internationally and locally have been studied. In evaluating the most suitable mining method, workability, safety and ore dilution and recovery factors of different mining methods were considered and the most suitable method for Bogala mine was evaluated...|$|E

In the current study, we investigate {{the extent to}} which national variation in perceptions of older people's competence is systematically related to national variation in {{the extent to which}} older people participate in paid and volunteer work.

The paper employs a sectoral system of innovation framework towards understanding the differential outcomes in innovation capability building in the industry achieved by China and India. The countries have pursued widely diverging strategies for developing their domestic innovation capability. India followed a very rigid policy of indigenous development of domestic technologies by establishing a stand-alone public laboratory that developed state-of-the art switching technologies. These were then transferred to manufacturing enterprises in both public and private sectors. The enterprises themselves did not have any in-house R&D capability. The public laboratory was also not given any strategic direction, even though it was technologically speaking, very <b>competent.</b> Consequently the <b>country,</b> despite possessing good quality human resource was unable to keep pace with changes in the technology frontier and the equipment industry has now become essentially dominated by affiliates of MNCs. China, on the contrary, first depended on MNCs for her technology needs in this area. But subsequently encouraged the emergence of three national champions, two of which are erstwhile public laboratories. The country has built up considerable hardware capability in both fixed line and mobile communications technology and has also emerged as a major player in world markets. Although the sectoral system of innovation in both the countries were promoted and nurtured by the state through a variety of instruments, the quality of such interventionist strategy is found to be better in China. The final outcome proves this line of argument. Innovation capability, China, India, Telecommunications industry, Digital switching systems, Mobile telephony...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{increase}} in disease burden {{has continued to}} weigh upon health systems in Africa. The role of the laboratory has become increasingly critical in the improvement of health for diagnosis, management and treatment of diseases. In response, the World Health Organization Regional Office for Africa (WHO AFRO) and its partners created the WHO AFRO Stepwise Laboratory (Quality) Improvement Process Towards Accreditation (SLIPTA) program. SLIPTA implementation process: WHO AFRO defined a governance structure with roles and responsibilities for six main stakeholders. Laboratories were evaluated by auditors trained and certified by the African Society for Laboratory Medicine. Laboratory performance was measured using the WHO AFRO SLIPTA scoring checklist and recognition certificates rated with 1 – 5 stars were issued. Preliminary results: By March 2015, 27 of the 47 (57 %) WHO AFRO member states had appointed a SLIPTA focal point and 14 Ministers of Health had endorsed SLIPTA as the desired programme for continuous quality improvement. Ninety-eight auditors from 17 African <b>countries,</b> <b>competent</b> in the Portuguese (3), French (12) and English (83) languages, were trained and certified. The mean score for the 159 laboratories audited between May 2013 and March 2015 was 69 % (median 70 %; SD 11. 5; interquartile range 62 – 77). Of these audited laboratories, 70 % achieved 55 % compliance or higher (2 or more stars) and 1 % scored at least 95 % (5 stars). The lowest scoring sections of the WHO AFRO SLIPTA checklist were sections 6 (Internal Audit) and 10 (Corrective Action), which both had mean scores below 50 %. Conclusion: The WHO AFRO SLIPTA {{is a process that}} countries with limited resources can adopt for effective implementation of quality management systems. Political commitment, ownership and investment in continuous quality improvement are integral components of the process. </p...|$|R
50|$|The {{surrounding}} area, {{especially to}} the south, is a productive agricultural region known as the Palouse. The Inland Northwest region has also long been associated with farming, especially wheat production where {{it is one of}} the largest wheat producing regions in the United States. Initially, the Palouse region to the south of Spokane was thought to be not suited for wheat production due to the hilly terrain, believing wheat could not be cultivated on the tops of the hills, but the region showed great promise for wheat production when it began in the late 1850’s in part due to the hilltops. Agricultural potential and productivity depends greatly on a region’s soil qualities which in turn is dependent on the climate and amount and timing of rainfall events. The Inland Empire, with its cool, snowy and rainy winters, rainy spring, and hot and dry summers lends itself to a wide variety of farming. The commercial farming activities were greatly enhanced by the founding of two state land-grant universities, Washington State University (as the Agriculture College, Experiment Station and School of Science of the State of Washington) in Pullman and the University of Idaho eight miles away in Moscow. The strategically placed universities and their experiment stations and staff would help industry by improving farm management, conducting research, and teaching students to be better, more <b>competent</b> farmers. Spokane <b>Country,</b> as the Spokane Chamber of Commerce marketed it in 1907 was defined as the area between the Cascade and Rocky Mountains, from British Columbia in the north to the Blue Mountains in the south, was a breadbasket and was able to develop and grow further with the completion of several several railroad networks as well as a highway system that began to center around the city, aiding farmers from around the region in distributing their products to market at low cost. As with mining in the late 1880’s, Spokane was an important agricultural market and trade and supply center. Inland Empire farmers exported wheat, livestock and other agricultural products to the ports such as New York, Liverpool and Tokyo. Today, a large share of the wheat produced in the region is shipped to Far East markets. The growth of the Inland Northwest's rural counties also was the result of the governmental and private efforts to irrigate and develop farmlands in the region. These programs, especially the Big Bend Project, resulted in an estimated 2,000,000 acres of arable farmland worth an estimated value of $50,000,000 in 1920. Wayne D. Rasmussen notes the U.S. Works Progress Administration showed in 1940, “3 flour mills, 5 meat packing plants, 23 creameries, 17 bakeries, and 6 poultry plants” as well as 300 factories operating in the city. Agriculture in Spokane and is very important to the overall economy, and according to Wayne Rasmussen, continued future success of this sector will depend on efficient farm management and support of agricultural research and development at regional universities as well as support to local farmers with information for sound decision making regarding production, financing, and marketing. The four major producing counties on the Palouse are Whitman, Lincoln, Grant, and Adams counties. A number of award-winning wineries and microbreweries also operate in the Spokane area. The largest brewery in Spokane is the No-Li Brewhouse.|$|R
40|$|Presented at the GLOBELICS 2006 {{conference in}} India during 4 - 7 October 2006. Session I- 2 : Sectoral {{innovation}} systemsIndia has pursed {{a policy of}} economic growth with technological self-reliance right through the 1950 s when she embarked on a planned form of development. Two industries that were targeted especially was the manufacturing of drugs and telecommunications equipments. However the final outcomes have been very different. The drug industry has become self sufficient, has emerged as net exporter and has a strong patenting record abroad while the telecommunications industry has increasingly become dependent on MNCs and imports and the industry does not have many patents to boast of. I argue that although the broad external environments obtaining to both industries are roughly similar, the differences in outcomes {{could be explained by}} the differences in their sectoral systems of innovation (SSI). The SSI of the pharmaceutical industry presents an ideal picture where private sector business enterprises occupy the central stage. They have been supported very well by a conducive intellectual property regime, which enabled them to reverse engineer known technologies, and thereby emerge as incremental innovators. On the contrary, a public laboratory dominates the SSI of the telecoms industry and the production enterprises in the system did not have much innovation capability: the enterprises were completely dependent on the public laboratory. The government too did not support the laboratory adequately and very often the public technology procurement- the main instrument pursued by the state supposedly to support domestic technology generation through the laboratory was actually against it. Consequently most of the enterprises constituting the SSI of the telecoms industry have become mere traders- distributing products manufactured elsewhere. The analysis thus brings out important but practical policy prescriptions. The paper is structured into four sections. Section 1 will outline the framework for analysis, which is essentially the sectoral system of innovation propounded by Malerba (2004). The second section provides some numbers on the innovative performance of the two industries. The third section undertakes a detailed mapping out of the sectoral system of innovation of two high tech in the Indian context, namely the pharmaceutical and telecom equipment industries. India’s pharmaceutical industry {{is one of the most}} innovative industries in the country’s manufacturing sector. The innovation system of the industry has three strong pillars: very pro active government policy regime especially with respect to intellectual property right, strong government research institutes and private sector enterprises which have invested in innovation. The TRIPS compliance of the intellectual property right regime making it mandatory for pharmaceutical products to be patented has not reduced the innovation capability of the industry although it has not made them work on R&D projects that may lead to the discovery of drugs for neglected diseases of the developing world. Although the innovation system has the capability to develop new chemical entities the two main components of the innovation system, namely the enterprises and the Government Research Institutes does not appear to be having all the requisite capabilities to bring a new drug to the market. Although the state has been very proactive with respect to this industry, this is an area where public policy support is still required. On the contrary in the case of the telecom equipment industry, India followed a very rigid policy of indigenous development of domestic technologies by establishing a stand-alone public laboratory that developed state-of-the-art switching technologies. These were then transferred to manufacturing enterprises in both public and private sectors. The enterprises themselves did not have any in-house R&D capability.

40|$|Pisciculture has {{not been}} {{developed}} in any major way in Africa. A few ponds have been constructed in some savannah lands, cages {{have been set up}} in rivers, enclosures have been built to try and exploit the potential of the lagoons but, at present, the production of 'farmed' fish has not risen above the 50, 000 tonne mark. This is not much as a fraction of the 45 million tonnes of fish caught in Africa. But these first, tentative efforts show signs of considerable future Potential. In Benin, in the shallow waters of Lake Nokoue, the fishermen build circular enclosures from tens to hundreds of centimetres in diameter, just as their fathers did before them. These are the famous 'acadjas' of the West African coast. The lake-dwellers, who are pisciculturists in the true sense of the word, place all kinds of vegetable matter inside these enclosures, including leaves and branches. The fish flock into these traps, which form a giant hoop-net offering them food and shelter. The branches provide an ideal environment where the fish can hide, for reproduction and egg-laying and the vegetable matter provides food as it decomposes. Once a year the fishermen harvest the fruit of their year's labour - to the beat of the drums, which gives a sort of carnival atmosphere. The time they spend beside their acadjas is well worthwhile - up to five tonnes of fish per hectare can be caught in the nets. These Lake Nokoue fishermen probably don't realize that they are just about the only fisherfolk of the entire African continent to be carrying on a tradition of pisciculture: the Benin acadjas are the nearest thing to true fish farms to be found in Africa. There are, of course, many skilful and <b>competent</b> fishermen in <b>countries</b> such as Mali but fishing {{is not the same thing}} as fish-farming: the production figures prove that. At best, traditional fishing can catch a few hundred kilos/ha, but usually it is much less. But the yields of pisciculture are measured in tonnes per hectare. Unlike the traditions of pisciculture in China or other parts of Asia, which are so ancient that the ponds have become part of the landscape, the rearing of fish in Africa is a relatively recent import. It was probably the Belgians who developed it first in Zaire to solve food shortages during the Second World War. The idea was sufficiently successful that the innovation was tried in neighbouring countries where some ponds were dug in the next few years. But the experiment flopped - either from lack of experience or lack of skill. The ponds were often poorly built and too far from the villages to be properly maintained and supervised, and their limitations soon became apparent. Successful pisciculture depends on a basic understanding of pond construction and maintenance, vigilance on water levels (permanent freshwater creeks are not too plentiful - especially in the Sudan), knowledge of the fish to be reared, their peculiarities, needs and weaknesses. For this reason, specialist organizations such as FAO or CIRAD CTFT (Centre Technique Forestier Tropical) of the Canadian CRDI (Centre de Recherches pour le Developpement International) have set up important research programmes, notably on rearing structures and also on which fish are best suited to aquaculture. Several projects which put into practice the different methods thought suitable for African pisciculture have been set up and are now producing fish. Fish from farm ponds The most widespread technique is rearing in ponds. It is the simplest, the most economic, and probably the best suited to the environment. In Cote d'Ivoire, where this type of pisciculture is taking off in a big way, the ponds seem to make a totally natural addition to the hollows next to the ricefields or just below the little artificial reservoirs built in the last few years for agricultural or pastoral purposes. These ponds fit in well with the landscape and are well adapted to the existing infra structures, and also to the local resources for fish feeding. Fish farmers collect agricultural waste matter or rubbish, and use it for fertilizing the ponds; as it decomposes the vegetable matter produces organisms which make a fish food of unrivalled cheapness and this method of rearing provides farmed fish at probably the lowest possible cost. But from the point of view of return on investment it is not very viable economically. It is for this reason that research has been carried out into other more 'rewarding' methods. If small-scale or industrial agriculture produces by-products - such as ricebran or cottonseed-cake - within easy reach of the fishponds, then these can be used as food. Fish grow faster and bigger on these processed by-products than on untreated vegetable waste as they have a higher nutritive value. They are cheap, and are well adapted to the nutritional needs of the fish and to the climatic conditions. which is not always true of imported food from Europe, which reacts badly to heat and humidity. In Cote d'Ivoire, for example, fish were fed on cottonseed-cake which was completely infested with weevils. The fish ate it as voraciously as usual and their weight gain was comparable to that of the preceding months when the cake was not contaminated. Fishrearing in ponds fits in as well with stock-keeping as with crop-growing. Ponds with small huts built on piles over them housing ducks and chickens,(just as in China) are beginning to make their appearance in the African landscape. They produce up to four tonnes of fish/hectare per annum. But people are still very loath to eat fish fed on poultry droppings, though in some areas the taste of tilapia has overcome this reluctance. More intensive production If fishponds are the simplest and most appropriate means of rearing, they are nevertheless neither flexible, because of the existing infrastructure, nor economical in terms of water use. The new climatic situation created by the drought years has caused some countries to look to other methods of fish-farming which might be better suited to restricted water supply. In Niger, cages have been set up in the river, and in Cote d'Ivoire and Benin attempts havebeen made to exploit their lagoons by building enclosures. Trials have been done to make this technique intensive (10 to 100 fish per cubic metre) while at the same time keeping it smallscale. Both cages and enclosures are lightweight constructions made using simple technology and locally-available materials where possible: wooden rafts, bamboo stakes, 30 -litre plastic drums for getting the fish out, grilles made out of fishing nets or (imported) plastic. These constructions are easy to handle and can be moved by three or four men when necessary. This is still a relatively new field and the different phases in the rearing of the fish, although now defined by research, demand certain technical skills on the part of the fish farmer. Not every problem has yet found an answer. Firstly, the financial return on fish produced in this way is small compared to that on fish caught in their natural environment, and the price of fish-food has a big influence on this. The food must be of assured quality, balanced, and carefully measured. There is an increasing move towards feeding the fish with locally-available by-products, as with the fishpond method, and this would seem to be appropriate in every way. In Niger, for example, the fish in cages are fed mainly on rice-bran and peanut oilcake, and this suits them well. The last weight-month season brought in 500 kg per 20 cube m cage. But despite all this, caged or enclosed fish do not thrive as those in the wild or in a large pool: disease is a greater risk because of the density of numbers, and it can bankrupt the fish farmer. In the enclosures in Benin, stock density has been voluntarily reduced (approximately 10 - 15 fish per cu m) in order to lessen the likelihood of infectious disease. In Niger problems peculiar to that country have been encountered. In the cold season (December-February), when water temperature is lower than 20 C (against 35 C in the hot season). the fish failed to grow or reproduce, and sometimes died. When feeding was adjusted more accurately to the water temperature the fish came through the season much better. At present about 50 Niger fishermen have changed back to aquaculture, using some 200 cages which provide them with their main means of income. In Benin, where 30 or so enclosures have been implanted in Lake Nokoue, the problem is salinity: from 20 g per litre in 1984 the salinity of the water has risen to a maximum of 30 g per litre in 1988 and such an increase can be crucial to freshwater fish. Research is in progress to find new species of hybrids better suited to salt water but in the short-term, the fishermen are looking to the Porto-Novo lagoon where salinity is lower and where the species of tilapia used is in its element. Trials are also going on in Cote d'Ivoire, in the Ebrie lagoon, to try and overcome the salinity problem. The first results of these seem to suggest that the problems in rearing tilapia in lagoons are not just caused by salt: it is a complex environment where other characteristics than salinity may disturb the tilapia. What are they? Can they ever be overcome? Research is in hand that may eventually allow the resources of these large expanses of lagoon on the African coast to be fully exploited. Fish from farm ponds The most widespread technique is rearing in ponds. It is the simplest, the most economic, and probably the best suited to the environment. In Cote d'Ivoire, where this type of pisciculture is taking off in a big way, the ponds seem to make a totally natural addition to the hollows next to the ricefields or just below the little artificial reservoirs built in the last few years for agricultural or pastoral purposes. These ponds fit in well with the landscape and are well adapted to the existing infra structures, and also to the local resources for fish feeding. Fish|$|R
