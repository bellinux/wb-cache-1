40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{sets out}} to discover a new of mode of being for the Pentecostal church which will ensure its survival and continued existence in the contemporary urban environment of the Claremont Central Business District. It is argued that {{the institution of the}} church is under threat in the urban context. The church is in decline and urban land is in demand. The dissertation argues <b>cross-programming</b> the church will ensure its survival within this context by introducing new and diverse revenue streams which reduces dependence on dwindling membership contributions, opens up new dialogues between the church and its context, thus justifying its place within the context by filling gaps within and building on the existing contextual programmatic mix. Central to this programmatic problem the space of the church still needs to hold onto and express the essence of what it is that makes it a sacred space. The initial data gathering was done by site, programmatic and statistical analysis; this data was gathered on site and through various publications. In addition, theoretical and technical research was gathered through various peer reviewed texts and publications. In the process of gathering information, common themes, patterns and connections between the different analyses were made which in turn led to further research or conclusions which assisted the argument and informed the design development of the project. In conclusion, {{it was found that the}} central idea of <b>cross-programming</b> the urban church was workable. Here there would undoubtedly have to be some compromise as each programme presents different requirements, but ultimately the application of the key theoretical theme of verticality brought unity to the scheme. Additionally, there was also need for some unconventional construction techniques to achieve comfortable internal environments. Finally, the result of the incorporation of diverse programming proved to yield greater and more diverse interactions between the church and its context which ultimately ensures its place, role and survival in the contemporary urban context...|$|R

5000|$|When {{it comes}} to {{transforming}} these observations into practice, Koolhaas mobilizes what he regards as the omnipotent forces of urbanism into unique design forms and connections organised {{along the lines of}} present-day society. Koolhaas continuously incorporates his observations of the contemporary city within his design activities: calling such a condition the ‘culture of congestion’. Again, shopping is examined for [...] "intellectual comfort", whilst the unregulated taste and densification of Chinese cities is analysed according to [...] "performance", a criterion involving variables with debatable credibility: density, newness, shape, size, money etc. For example, in his design for the new CCTV headquarters in Beijing (2009), Koolhaas did not opt for the stereotypical skyscraper, often used to symbolise and landmark such government enterprises, but instead designed a series of volumes which not only tie together the numerous departments onto the nebulous site, but also introduced routes (again, the concept of <b>cross-programming)</b> for the general public through the site, allowing them some degree of access to the production procedure. Through his ruthlessly raw approach, Koolhaas hopes to extract the architect from the anxiety of a dead profession and resurrect a contemporary interpretation of the sublime, however fleeting it may be.|$|R

This thesis asks how the cyborg {{can be used}} as a catalyst to reengage the body with architecture. Four key areas are used to explore this proposition; precedent, body, programme and site. Theorist Donna Haraway and Marcos Cruz will be used as precedents to guide this field of inquiry into an architectural form. The design method fluctuates between the analogue and digital, body and machine, and shifting scales. The method is used to design four buildings to test the metaphor of the cyborg through physical models, drawings and digital space. The <b>cross-programming</b> of a biofuel factory with domestic living has been chosen in order to test the translation of the cyborg into architecture. This is explored at different scales; macro, mezzo and micro. At the macro scale, the site of Wellington city, New Zealand, will be explored in terms of rethinking existing parts, as mechanisms, that contribute to the city’s programmatic response to energy generation. The mezzo scale focuses on the translation of the cyborg into usable human scale space. Finally, at the micro scale, the reaction of a surface according to the body will inform the resulting architecture; such as the design of a stair, where the actions of the body are informing the building and vice versa. The conclusion of this thesis is a building that operates as a cyborg which is active to the needs of the human and the city...|$|R
40|$|URBAN RESONANCE {{explores the}} {{connections}} between architectural design and the multifaceted conceptual links {{to the idea of}} resonance in sound. This comparison is made in respect to the fact that a building is somewhat required to resonate with its urban context as well as to orchestrate the resonance relating to systems of people, built form and program, within itself. In using the concept of resonance, it is seen that these three systems, although separately definable, work together in one architectural environment – influencing each other in some way whether beneficial or not. I have chosen these three components of architectural design in response to Johannesburg’s urban and social context, and will explore their integration through celebrating their interstitial spaces of influence and resonance with each other. I seek to allow this idea in design, to produce new meaningful social encounters brought about by the exploration of <b>cross-programming</b> in a building coupled with an architectural response that enforces these social ideas. In the framework of Johannesburg, the question is not necessarily what the systems are but maybe rather how they can be unified and brought together in a building design. Sound is one of the least substantially manipulated and considered parts of building design, yet its relationship to inhabitants and their social connections to each other and space is powerful enough to allow people to perceive their surroundings solely through the things that they hear. URBAN RESONANCE is the explicit exploration of collective social ‘being’ in a building that uses sound and music to unify its programmatic and physical design within the context of Braamfontein, Johannesburg.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{construct}} meaning {{of the world around}} us, we each internalize and react to a peripheral consciousness that we construct with inputs from our senses along with beliefs and values that we maintain. And so I have constructed an understanding of Jamaica Plain, the place where I live, as many things. My understanding encompasses the built place, the green spaces, the pond, the seasons, my own social relations, time, and so on. Jamaica Pond is somehow always central to my mental construction of this place and the annual Jamaica Plain Lantern Festival is a ritual that to me represents a rich celebration of community, life, place, time. [...] My thesis explores this notion of the construction of meaning via a proposed architectural intervention that involves the <b>cross-programming</b> of a park, a public tower, an after-school art center (a home for the lantern parade), and a daycare center - all on a pivotal site at the intersection of Centre and Pond Streets. Centre Street is the 'Main Street' of Jamaica Plain. Pond Street is two blocks long and it connects between Centre Street and the formal entry to Jamaica Pond. Centre Street is a long street that winds through Jamaica Plain (also JP). Along it one finds two main areas of concentrated business activity with a mix of residential, school, non' storefront' commercial, and parking sited in between. I am proposing that a site at the intersection of Pond and Centre Streets would allow for the marking of entry onto Centre Street and thereby define a new entry into Jamaica Plain. In my work, I have attempted to address the above programmatic underpinnings through urbanistic and architectural solutions that maintain complex relationships without the loss of legibility. And there is my hope of creating an architecture that both physically and psychically participates in the ritual of the Jamaica Plain Lantern Festival. by Dejan Miovic-Hillel. Thesis (M. Arch.)

It identifies the need for adequate urban educational facilities and explores the use of existing buildings as schools. An existing educational cluster is identified at {{the eastern edge of the}} inner city, defined by Church, Du Toit and Pretorius Streets, and Nelson Mandela Drive. This city block and the ones surrounding it contain numerous primary, secondary and tertiary educational institutions in a predominant industrial/automotive precinct. An urban design framework is proposed for the precinct. It is envisioned that the precinct may be developed as a mixed-use urban educational campus. Within the existing city block and the urban framework proposal, the Apollo Centre, located on the corner of Church-and Du Toit Street, is selected for an adaptive re-use intervention. The proposed use is an urban primary school. The Apollo project investigates current pedagogical trends, which informed a concept that is largely defined by the idea of contextual learning within a vertical structure. Transparency and integration of education with the urban environment is at the core of the proposal. The traditional notion of horizontal education is explored in a vertical manner. The existing structure is analyzed and a position taken regarding the adaptive re-use process that informs the design. Precedent Studies include existing schools with{{in the inner city}} of Pretoria as well as local and international schools. The process of converting the Apollo Centre into a primary educational facility, that shares its resources on a <b>cross-programming</b> basis, is explored in a series of proposals.

This reduction {{is affected by}} household participation in other Government assistance programs (<b>cross-program</b> effects) and by the wide variation in State-specific reduction rates for earnings in Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF). This study shows that, for food stamp recipients who also received cash benefits through TANF in 2005, an extra dollar of earnings led {{to a change in}} food stamp benefits ranging from a reduction of 36 cents to an increase of 9 cents. On average across all States, the overall reduction rate for food stamp benefits and TANF cash benefits was about 70 percent, or about double the benefit reduction rate for a household that received only food stamp benefits. Even with this high benefit reduction rate, households received larger net incomes by working and earning income. <b>Cross-program</b> effects and State-level variability in food stamp benefits are important considerations in integrating Government assistance programs into a support system for low-income households.

40|$|The {{design of}} general purpose {{processors}} {{relies heavily on}} a workload gathering step in which representative programs are collected from various application domains. Processor performance, when running the workload set, is profiled using simulators that model the targeted processor architecture. However, simulating the entire workload set is prohibitively time-consuming, which precludes considering {{a large number of}} programs. To reduce simulation time, several techniques in the literature have exploited the internal program repetitiveness to extract and execute only representative code segments. Existing so- lutions are based on reducing <b>cross-program</b> computational redundancy or on eliminating internal-program redundancy to decrease execution time. In this work, we propose an orthogonal and complementary loop- centric methodology that targets loop-dominant programs by exploiting internal-program characteristics to reduce <b>cross-program</b> computational redundancy. The approach employs a newly developed framework that extracts and analyzes core loops within workloads. The collected characteristics model memory behavior, computational complexity, and data structures of a program, and are used to construct a signature vector for each program. From these vectors, cross-workload similarity metrics are extracted, which are processed by a novel heuristic to exclude similar programs and reduce redundancy within the set. Finally, a reverse engineering approach that synthesizes executable micro-benchmarks having the same instruction mix as the loops in the original workload is introduced. A tool that automates the flow steps of the proposed methodology is developed. Simulation results demonstrate that applying the proposed methodology to a set of workloads reduces the set size by half, while preserving the main characterizations of the initial workloads...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine current {{approaches}} and challenges to teaching ethics in entry-level Canadian physiotherapy (PT) and occupational therapy (OT) programs. Methods: Educators responsible for teaching ethics in the 28 Canadian PT and OT programs (n= 55) completed an online survey. Results: The quantity of ethics teaching is highly variable, ranging from 5 to 65 hours. Diverse obstacles to ethics teaching were reported, relating to the organization and structure of academic programs, student issues and the topic of ethics itself. Specific challenges included time constraints, large class sizes, a lack of pedagogical tools adapted to teaching this complex subject, a perceived lack of student interest for the subject and a preference for topics related to clinical skills. Of note, 65 % of ethics educators who participated in the survey did not have any specialized training in ethics. Conclusion: Significant <b>cross-program</b> variation in the number of hours dedicated to ethics and the diversity of pedagogical methods used suggests that there is little consensus about how best to teach ethics.

40|$|The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Exploration Systems Development (ESD) Division has {{implemented}} {{an innovative}} approach to Enterprise Risk Management under a unique governance structure and streamlined integration model. ESD's {{mission is to}} design and build the capability to extend human existence to deep space. The Enterprise consists of three Programs: Space Launch System (SLS), Orion, and Ground Systems Development and Operations (GSDO). The SLS is a rocket and launch system that will be capable of powering humans, habitats, and support systems to deep space. Orion {{will be the first}} spacecraft in history capable of taking humans to multiple destinations within deep space. GSDO is modernizing Kennedy's spaceport to launch spacecraft built and designed by both NASA and private industry. ESD's approach to Enterprise Risk Management is commensurate with affordability and a streamlined management philosophy. ESD Enterprise Risk Management leverages off of the primary mechanisms for integration within the Enterprise. The Enterprise integration approach emphasizes delegation of authority to manage and execute the majority of <b>cross-program</b> activities and products to the individual Programs, while maintaining the overall responsibility for all <b>cross-program</b> activities at the Division. The intent of the ESD Enterprise Risk Management approach is to improve risk communication, to avoid replication and/or contradictory strategies, and to minimize overhead process burden. This is accomplished by the facilitation and integration of risk information within ESD. The ESD Division risks, Orion risks, SLS risks, and GSDO risks are owned and managed by the applicable Program. When the Programs have shared risks with multiple consequences, they are jointly owned and managed. When a risk is associated with the integrated system that involves more than one Program in condition, consequence, or mitigation plan, it is considered an Exploration Systems Integration (ESI) Risk. An ESI risk may require visibility and risk handling by multiple organizations. The Integrated Risk Working Group (IRWG) is a small team of Risk experts that are responsible for collaborating and communicating best practices. In addition, the forum facilitates proper integration of risks across the Enterprise. The IRWG uses a Continuous Risk Management approach for facilitating the identification, analysis, planning, tracking, and controlling of ESI Risks. The ESD Division, Programs, and Integrated Task Teams identify ESI Risks. The IRWG maintains a set of metrics for understanding Enterprise Risk process and the overall Risk Posture. The team is also actively involved in the modeling of risk for Enterprise Performance Management.
