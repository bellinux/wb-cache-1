40|$|Australian product coals are {{becoming}} finer-grained, mainly due to {{improvements in the}} performance of ultra-fine coal recovery methods. The finer the product <b>coal</b> <b>size</b> fraction, the more capacity it has to store water during beneficiation and the higher the pressure required to facilitate dewatering to meet the specified moisture. Following the removal of the pressure applied to facilitate dewatering, the particular product <b>coal</b> <b>size</b> fraction is left under a suction equivalent to that applied pressure, providing it with the potential to re-wet on the stockpile under moist conditions. During the dewatering process, the product coal is unsaturated. The relationship between applied pressure (or the equivalent suction felt on the removal of this pressure) and moisture content for a particular product <b>coal</b> <b>size</b> fraction is described by the Soil Water Characteristic Curve (SWCC) of the material, based on unsaturated soil mechanics principles. Such curves have been obtained for different product <b>coal</b> <b>size</b> fractions, from which the effectiveness of dewatering under a range of applied pressures can be estimated. Moisture content versus time data for ultra-fine and fine product coal samples under a constant applied suction have also been obtained for use in estimating the extent of dewatering achievable for a given residence time in a particular piece of dewatering equipment. The SWCCs can be used to supplement conventional methods in deciding the most appropriate dewatering equipment required to obtain a given moisture content for a particular product <b>coal</b> <b>size</b> fraction...|$|E

Various <b>coal</b> particle <b>sizes</b> were tested in addition to 54 mm diameter coal core. The other <b>coal</b> <b>sizes</b> were ± 15 mm (- 5 / 8 + 0. 530 mesh) cubical blocks and coal fragments of ± 1. 18 mm (- 0. 256 + 16 mesh), ± 6. 70 mm (- 5 / 16 + 0. 256 mesh), and ± 8. 00 mm (- 5 / 8 + 5 / 16 mesh). The samples were maintained in specially designed pressure vessels, at constant temperature of 24 °C and subjected to gas pressures up to maximum of 4000 kPa with incremental increasing steps of 500 kPa.

40|$|The {{performance}} of a two stage, coal combustor concept for magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) systems was investigated analytically. The two stage MHD combustor is comprised of an entrained flow, slagging gasifier as the first stage, and a gas phase reactor as the second stage. The first stage was modeled by assuming instantaneous coal devolatilization, and volatiles combustion and char gasification by CO 2 and H 2 O in plug flow. The second stage combustor was modeled assuming adiabatic instantaneous gas phase reactions. Of primary interest was the dependence of char gasification efficiency on first stage particle residence time. The influence of first stage stoichiometry, heat loss, coal moisture, <b>coal</b> <b>size</b> distribution, and degree of coal devolatilization on gasifier performance and second stage exhaust temperature was determined. Performance predictions indicate that particle residence times {{on the order of}} 500 msec would be required to achieve gasification efficiencies in the range of 90 to 95 percent. The use of a finer <b>coal</b> <b>size</b> distribution significantly reduces the required gasifier residence time for acceptable levels of fuel use efficiency.

40|$|In this work, {{bituminous}} coal was co-fired with municipal sewage sludge in a 12 MWth circulating fluidized bed (CFB) research boiler. The fraction of sewage sludge(both wet and dry) in the feed was varied {{in the range}} 0 - 67 % (on dry mass). The impact of co-combustion on ash leaving the boiler, bed material in the furnace and concentrations of O 2, CO 2, CO and total hydrocarbons throughout the furnace was studied. In order to evaluate {{the influence of the}} wide size distribution of the coal on the results, the coal was pre-sieved into a fine and a coarse size fraction and separately burned. The higher ash content in the sewage sludge resulted in increasing fly ash flows and lower combustible content in the fly ash with increasing fraction of sludge in the fuel mix. The bottom ash flow and combustible content were more sensitive to the feed <b>coal</b> <b>size</b> distribution than to the sludge supply. Compared to coal combustion, co-combustion of coal with sewage sludge was found to lead to a higher concentration of fine solids in the furnace, caused by attrition of sludge ash particles. Furthermore, as the density of sewage sludge ash is lower than that of coal ash, coarser sludge ash particles than coal ash particles could be entrained from the bottom bed. These two phenomena contributed to wider solids size distributions throughout the furnace in the case of co-combustion with sewage sludge. The effect of the entering <b>coal</b> <b>size</b> distribution on the size distribution of the inert ashes was negligible compared to the impact of the sludge fraction in the feed. The size distributions of the combustible solids in the bed material, on the other hand, were dependent on variations in feed size distribution of the coal rather than on sludge supply. The introduction of sewage sludge in the fuel mix resulted in greater measured concentrations of CO and total hydrocarbons in the furnace, leading to an increased combustion of volatiles above the bottom bed and higher temperatures {{in the top of the}} furnace...|$|E

The <b>coal</b> <b>size</b> used ranged from fragmented coals, 16 mm, 8 mm, 2. 4 mm, powdered coal of 150 μm and 54 mm core samples. The samples were tested in pressure vessels, known as “bombs”, charged with CO 2 gas at different pressure levels up to a maximum of 4000 kPa. It was found that temperature has a significant influence on the sorption and desorption behaviour of gas in coal. The degree of hysteresis phenomenon was found to be influenced by the coal surface area as well as temperature. Based on the principle of surface chemistry, the method of calculating coal surface energy with sorption parameters was used and the main parameter of surface tension was analysed. The calculation result showed that reduced value of surface tension parameter decreased with increasing temperature. Also the reduced value of surface tension parameter of adsorption is smaller than the desorption.

On the basis of the performance of CO and CO 2 emissions, the effect of various operating parameters, such as reaction temperature, superficial gas velocity, <b>coal</b> particle <b>size,</b> oxygen concentration and coal properties, on the combustion rate was investigated. The yield ratio of CO to CO 2 remained 1 : 1 until the reaction temperature exceeding 850 degrees C and then decreased gradually, indicating that the combustion mechanism changed at such temperature. The increase of superficial gas velocity and oxygen concentration and the reduction of <b>coal</b> particle <b>size</b> had positive effects on promoting the combustion process, but their contributions became feeble as the superficial gas velocity and the oxygen concentration were respectively greater than 0. 10 m/s and 50 vol%, and the <b>coal</b> particle <b>size</b> was smaller than 74 mu m. The relations of reaction rate constant with various operating parameters were established. The kinetic parameters of pulverized coal combustion determined by MFBKA presented the same changing tendency as the results of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), but the former apparent activation energy is relatively lower because of its optimized kinetic conditions.
