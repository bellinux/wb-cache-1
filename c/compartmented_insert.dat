40|$|AbstractProteins of {{all living}} organisms must reach their {{subcellular}} destination {{to sustain the}} cell structure and function. The proteins are transported {{to one of the}} cellular <b>compartments,</b> <b>inserted</b> into the membrane, or secreted across the membrane to the extracellular milieu. Cells have developed various mechanisms to transport proteins across membranes, among them localized translation. Evidence for targeting of Messenger RNA for the sake of translation of their respective protein products at specific subcellular sites in many eukaryotic model organisms have been accumulating in recent years. Cis-acting RNA localizing elements, termed RNA zip-codes, which are embedded within the mRNA sequence, are recognized by RNA-binding proteins, which in turn interact with motor proteins, thus coordinating the intracellular transport of the mRNA transcripts. Despite the rareness of conventional organelles, first and foremost a nucleus, pieces of evidence for mRNA localization to specific subcellular domains, where their protein products function, have also been obtained for prokaryotes. Although the underlying mechanisms for transcript localization in bacteria are yet to be unraveled, it is now obvious that intracellular localization of mRNA is a common mechanism to spatially localize proteins in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes.

40|$|The {{development}} of advanced stimuli-responsive systems for medicine, catalysis, or technology requires compartmentalized reaction spaces with triggered activity. Only very few stimuli-responsive systems preserve the compartment architecture, and none allows a triggered activity in situ.

Nanoreactors with triggered activity were designed by simultaneously encapsulating an enzyme inside polymer <b>compartments,</b> and <b>inserting</b> protein “gates” in the membrane. The outer membrane protein F (OmpF) porin was chemically modified with a pH-responsive molecular cap to serve as “gate” producing pH-driven molecular flow through the membrane and control the in situ enzymatic activity.

40|$|Protein {{secretion}} {{systems in}} prokaryotes are increasingly shifting from being considered as experimental models for ‘more complex’ processes (i. e. eukaryotes) {{to being a}} major source of key biological questions in their own right. The pathways by which proteins move between <b>compartments</b> or <b>insert</b> into membranes in prokaryotic cells are certainly less numerous than in eukaryotes (though not dramatically so). However, the quality and complexity of bacterial protein targeting systems indicate that virtually all mechanistic problems associated with protein traffic were solved very efficiently well before eukaryotes appeared on the Earth crust. Indeed, recent studies have both increased the number of known prokaryotic protein traffic systems and indicated new layers of complexity for those that were already well characterized. This report describes some recent developments in bacterial protein traffic that were presented at two meetings in the autumn of 2003. ...|$|R

40|$|For solar {{process heat}} {{applications}} with steam as the working fluid and varying application parameters, a novel {{latent heat storage}} concept has been developed using an adaptation of a flat plate heat exchanger as the storage concept. Since the pressure level in these applications usually does not exceed 30 bar, an adaptation with storage material chambers arranged between heat transfer medium chambers is possible. Phase change materials are used as the storage medium, so that the isothermal evaporation of steam during discharging of the storage is paired with the isothermal solidification of the storage material. Heat transfer structures can be inserted into the chambers to adjust the power level for a given application. By combining the required number of flat plate heat exchanger <b>compartments</b> and <b>inserting</b> the appropriate heat transfer structure, the design can easily be adjusted for the required power level and capacity for a specific application.

40|$|Background: Quantitative single photon {{emission}} computed tomography (SPECT) is challenging, especially for pancreatic beta cell imaging with 111 In-exendin {{due to high}} uptake in the kidneys versus much lower uptake in the nearby pancreas. Therefore, we designed a three-dimensionally (3 D) printed phantom representing the pancreas and kidneys to mimic the human situation in beta cell imaging. The phantom {{was used to assess}} the effect of different reconstruction settings on the quantification of the pancreas uptake for two different, commercially available software packages. Methods: 3 D-printed, hollow pancreas and kidney <b>compartments</b> were <b>inserted</b> into the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) NU 2 image quality phantom casing. These organs and the background compartment were filled with activities simulating relatively high and low pancreatic 111 In-exendin uptake for, respectively, healthy humans and type 1 diabetes patients. Images were reconstructed using Siemens Flash 3 D and Hermes Hybrid Recon, with varying numbers of iterations and subsets and corrections. Images were visually assessed on homogeneity and artefacts, and quantitatively by the pancreas-to-kidney activity concentration ratio. Results: Phantom images were similar to clinical images and showed comparable artefacts. All corrections were required to clearly visualize the pancreas. Increased numbers of subsets and iterations improved the quantitative performance but decreased homogeneity both in the pancreas and the background. Based on the phantom analyses, the Hybrid Recon reconstruction with 6 iterations and 16 subsets was found to be most suitable for clinical use. Conclusions: This work strongly contributed to quantification of pancreatic 111 In-exendin uptake. It showed how clinical images of 111 In-exendin can be interpreted and enabled selection of the most appropriate protocol for clinical use...|$|R
40|$|The vector pEPI was {{the first}} nonviral and episomally replicating vector. Its {{functional}} element is an expression unit linked to a chromosomal scaffold/matrix attached region (S/MAR). The vector replicates autonomously with low copy number in various cell lines, is mitotically stable {{in the absence of}} selection over hundreds of generations, and was successfully used for the efficient generation of genetically modified pigs. Since it is assumed that establishment of the vector is a stochastic event and strongly depends on the nuclear compartment it reaches after transfection, it is of great interest to identify genomic sequences that guide DNA sequences into certain nuclear <b>compartments.</b> Here we <b>inserted</b> genomic cis-acting sequences into pEPI and examined their impact on transgene expression, long-term stability, and vector establishment. We demonstrated that a ubiquitous chromatin-opening element (UCOE) mediated enhanced transgene expression, while an insulator sequence (cHS 4) increased establishment efficiency, presumably via an additional interaction with the nuclear matrix. Thus, besides being a promising alternative to currently used viral vectors in gene therapeutic approaches, pEPI may also serve as a tool to study nuclear compartmentalization; identification of genomic cis-acting sequences that are involved in nuclear organization will contribute {{to our understanding of the}} interplay between transgene expression, plasmid establishment, and nuclear architecture...|$|R
30|$|Measurements of {{groundwater}} seepage rates are often made using manual seepage meters. Seepage meters were first developed by Israelsen and Reeve (1944) {{to measure the}} water loss from irrigation canals. Lee (1977) designed a seepage meter consisting of steel drum fitted with a sample port and a plastic collection bag. The drum forms a chamber that is inserted open end down into the sediment. Water seeping through the sediment will displace water trapped in the chamber forcing it up through the port into the plastic bag. The change in volume {{of water in the}} bag over a measured time interval provides the flux measurement. Based on the lee type seepage meter we assembled a manual seepage meter (Fig.  2), which is 1  feet high with 1  feet diameter and 0.5  feet radius, one end of the 20 -L steel drum each has a 1 -cm vent hole, left open during placement so that pressure quickly equilibrated with the bay, the small hole was connected to hose and {{the other side of the}} hose is connected to 1 -L plastic bag. The drum forms a <b>compartment</b> that is <b>inserted</b> open end down into the sediment. Water seeping through the sediment will displace water trapped in the compartment forcing it up through the port into the plastic bag.|$|R
40|$|Iron {{absorption}} by intestinal epithelial cells, passage onto plasmatic apotransferrin, {{and regulation}} of the process remain largely misunderstood. To investigate this problem, we have set up an in vitro model, consisting in CaCo 2 cells (a human colon adenocarcinoma line, which upon cultivation displays numerous differentiation criteria of small intestine epithelial cells). Cells are cultivated in a serum-free medium, containing 1 microgram/ml insulin, 1 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 10 micrograms/ml albumin-linoleic acid, 100 nM hydrocortisone, and 2 nM T 3 on new, transparent, Cyclopore polyethyleneterephthalate microporous membranes coated with type I collagen. Cells rapidly adhere, grow, and form confluent monolayers; after 15 days, scanning electron microscopy reveals numerous uniform microvilli. Domes, which develop on nonporous substrata, are absent on high porosity membranes. Culture medium from upper and lower <b>compartments</b> of microplate <b>inserts</b> and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated after labeling with [3 H]glucosamine and leucine; analysis was done by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), followed by autoradiography. [3 H]transferrin is found mainly in the lower compartment and in cells; [3 H]apolipoprotein B is released in both compartments, and fibronectin almost entirely recovered in the lower compartment; [3 H]transferrin receptors and ferritin are only present in cell lysates. Binding experiments also show that transferrin receptors are accessible from the lower compartment. These results suggest that CaCo 2 cells, cultivated in synthetic medium on membranes of appropriate porosity, could provide an in vitro model of the intestinal barrier, with the upper compartment of the culture insert corresponding to the apical pole facing the intestinal lumen and the lower one to the basal pole in contact with blood...|$|R
40|$|The {{intestinal}} {{epithelial cell}} layer represents {{the border between}} the luminal and systemic side of the gut. The decision between absorption and exclusion of substances is the quintessential function of the gut and varies along the gut axis. Consequently, potentially toxic substances may reach the basolateral domain of the epithelial cell layer via blood stream. The mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON) is a Fusarium derived secondary metabolite known to enter the blood stream and displaying a striking toxicity on the basolateral side of polarised epithelial cell layers in vitro. Here we analysed potential mechanisms of apical and basolateral DON toxicity reflected in the gene expression. We used the jejunum-derived, polarised intestinal porcine epithelial cell line IPEC-J 2 as an in vitro cell culture model. Luminal and systemic DON challenge of the epithelial cell layer was mimicked by a DON application from the apical or basolateral <b>compartment</b> of membrane <b>inserts</b> for 72 h. We compared the genome-wide gene expression of untreated and DON-treated IPEC-J 2 cells with the GeneChip® Porcine Genome Array of Affymetrix. Low basolateral DON (200 ng/mL) application triggered 10 times more gene transcripts in comparison to the corresponding apical application (2539 versus 267) despite the intactness of the challenged cell layer as measured by transepithelial electrical resistance. Analysis of the regulated genes by bioinformatic resource DAVID identified several groups of biochemical pathways modulated by concentration and orientation of DON application. Selected genes representing pathways of the cellular metabolism, information processing and structural design were analysed in detail by quantitative PCR. Our findings clearly show that apical and basolateral challenge of epithelial cell layers trigger different gene response profiles paralleled with a higher susceptibility towards basolateral challenge. The evaluation of toxicological potentials of mycotoxins should take this difference in gene regulation dependent on route of application into account...|$|R
