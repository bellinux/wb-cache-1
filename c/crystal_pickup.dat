50|$|Early {{electronic}} phonographs used a {{piezo-electric crystal}} for pickup (though the earliest electronic phonographs used crude magnetic pick-ups), where the mechanical {{movement of the}} stylus in the groove generates a proportional electrical voltage by creating stress within a crystal (typically Rochelle salt). Crystal pickups are relatively robust, and produce a substantial signal level which requires only a modest amount of further amplification. The output is not very linear however, introducing unwanted distortion. It is difficult to make a <b>crystal</b> <b>pickup</b> suitable for quality stereo reproduction, as the stiff coupling between the crystal and the long stylus prevents close tracking of the needle to the groove modulations. This tends to increase wear on the record, and introduces more distortion. Another problem is the hygroscopic nature of the crystal itself: it absorbs moisture from the air and may dissolve. The crystal was protected by embedding it in other materials, without hindering {{the movement of the}} pickup mechanism itself. After a number of years, the protective jelly often deteriorated or leaked from the cartridge case and the full unit needed replacement.|$|E
50|$|The first commercially {{successful}} type {{of electrical}} phonograph pickup {{was introduced in}} 1925. Although electromagnetic, its resemblance to later magnetic cartridges is remote: it contained a bulky horseshoe magnet and employed the same imprecisely mass-produced single-use steel needles which had been standard since the first crude disc record players appeared in the 1890s. Its tracking weight was specified in ounces, not grams. This early type of magnetic pickup completely dominated the market well into the 1930s, {{but by the end}} of that decade it had been superseded by a comparatively lightweight piezoelectric <b>crystal</b> <b>pickup</b> type. The use of short-lived disposable metal needles remained standard. During the years of affluence and long-deferred consumer demand immediately following World War II, as old record players with very heavy pickups were replaced, precision-ground and conveniently long-lasting stylus tips made of sapphire or the exotic hard metal osmium were increasingly popular. However, records made for home use still played at 78 rpm and most of them were still made of the same old abrasive shellac compound formulated to rapidly wear down the points of steel needles to fit the groove.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{investigations}} of fuel injection in spark ignition engines have aroused {{new interest in}} two stroke cycle engines. The performance of such engines is very much affected by the dynamic behaviour of the fresh air introduced and the exhaust leaving the cylinder through ports, receivers and silencers. The present investigation has as its aim the clarification and establishment of trends {{in the performance of}} two stroke engines with particular reference to crank case scavenged engines. The basic relations governing the flow of air and gas through the whole system are investigated one by one and their interdependence is established. The investigation covers: pulsations in the cylinder, accelerations in the ducts, effect of variable port area, effect of throttling in the ports. The basic differential equation for free oscillation of the exhaust gas in the system comprising receiver, exhaust pipe, and silencer is set up and a method is developed which allows calculation of an equivalent length for the system. With this equivalent length, the natural frequency of the system can be calculated. An experimental investigation is presented which was carried out on a single cylinder compression ignition engine with crank case scavenging. The volumetric efficiency of the engine was determined as a function of exhaust system configuration at various brake mean effective pressures and at constant engine speed. The pressure in the exhaust near the port was measured (by means of a quartz and <b>crystal</b> <b>pickup)</b> as a function of crank angle. The results are presented in the form of plots of volumetric efficiencies as function of brake mean effective pressure for various configurations and as photographic records of pressure as a function of crank angle. It is concluded that a simple frequency analysis is insufficient for the determination of the exhaust behaviour. Criteria for good exhaust systems are established. The trends predicted in the theoretical analysis of the report are, in general, well verified. The need for further investigation is indicated and an outline of research is presented...|$|E
25|$|Shure began {{supplying}} replacement <b>crystal</b> <b>pickups</b> {{to various}} manufacturers in 1933 {{and by the}} mid-1940s Shure was the largest supplier of phonograph cartridges in America, supplying record manufacturers like Philco, RCA, Emerson, Magnavox, Admiral, and Motorola. At the peak of Shure's production the company was producing more than 28,000 cartridges per day, with 25,000 produced at Shure's Phoenix plant. While Shure continues to manufacture phono cartridges, the Phoenix facility was closed in the late 1980s due to declining demand.|$|R
25|$|Eventually, when it {{was more}} common for {{electric}} recordings to be played back electrically in the 1930s and 1940s, the overall tone was much like listening to a radio of the era. Magnetic pickups became more common and were better designed as time went on, {{making it possible to}} improve the damping of spurious resonances. <b>Crystal</b> <b>pickups</b> were also introduced as lower cost alternatives. The dynamic or moving coil microphone was introduced around 1930 and the velocity or ribbon microphone in 1932. Both of these high quality microphones became widespread in motion picture, radio, recording, and public address applications.|$|R
50|$|Compared to the <b>crystal</b> and ceramic <b>pickups,</b> the {{magnetic}} cartridge usually gives improved playback fidelity and reduced record wear by tracking the groove with lighter pressure. Magnetic cartridges use lower tracking forces and thus reduce {{the potential for}} groove damage. They also have a lower output voltage than a <b>crystal</b> or ceramic <b>pickup,</b> {{in the range of}} only a few millivolts, thus requiring greater amplification.|$|R
50|$|In high-fidelity systems, <b>crystal</b> and ceramic <b>pickups</b> {{have been}} {{replaced}} by the magnetic cartridge, using either a moving magnet or a moving coil.|$|R
5000|$|The {{tone arm}} {{got its name}} {{before the age of}} electronics. It {{originally}} served to conduct actual sound waves from a purely mechanical [...] "pickup" [...] called a sound box or reproducer to a so-described [...] "amplifying" [...] horn. The earliest electronic record players, introduced at the end of 1925, had massive electromagnetic pickups that contained a horseshoe magnet, used disposable steel needles, and weighed several ounces. Their full weight rested on the record, providing ample tracking force to overcome their low compliance but causing rapid record wear. The tone arms were rudimentary and remained so even after lighter <b>crystal</b> <b>pickups</b> appeared about ten years later. When fine-grooved vinyl records were introduced in the late 1940s, still smaller and lighter crystal (later, ceramic) cartridges with semi-permanent jewel styluses became standard. In the mid-1950s these were joined by a new generation of magnetic cartridges that bore little resemblance to their crude ancestors. Far smaller tracking forces became possible and the balanced arm came into use.|$|R

2500|$|In 1931, RCA Victor {{introduced}} their vinyl-based Victrolac compound as {{a material}} for some unusual-format and special-purpose records. One such was a 16-inch, rpm record {{used by the}} Vitaphone sound-on-disc movie system. In 1932, RCA began using Victrolac in their [...] "home recording" [...] system, with which people could record their own voices at home. By {{the end of the}} 1930s vinyl's advantages of light weight, relative unbreakability, and low surface noise had made it the material of choice for prerecorded radio programming and other critical applications. When it came to ordinary 78rpm records, however, the much higher cost of the raw material, as well as its vulnerability to the heavy pickups and crudely mass-produced steel needles still commonly used in home record players, made its general substitution for shellac impractical at that time. During the Second World War, the United States Armed Forces produced thousands of 12-inch vinyl 78rpm V-Discs for use by the troops overseas. After the war, the wider use of vinyl became more practical as new record players with relatively lightweight <b>crystal</b> <b>pickups</b> and precision-ground styli made of sapphire or an exotic osmium alloy proliferated. In late 1945, RCA Victor began offering special transparent red vinyl De Luxe pressings of some Red Seal classical 78s, at a De luxe price. Later, Decca Records introduced vinyl Deccalite 78s, while other record companies came up with vinyl concoctions such as Metrolite, Merco Plastic, and Sav-o-flex, but these were mainly used to produce [...] "unbreakable" [...] children's records and special thin vinyl DJ pressings for shipment to radio stations.|$|R

5000|$|In 1930, two amateur radio operators, Creed M. Chorpening, W8WR (later W8MJM) and F.H. Woodworth, W8AHW began {{experimenting with}} {{different}} types of microphones for their [...] "ham' stations. Their mutual friend, Charles Semple, worked for Brush Development Company {{where he had been}} experimenting with Rochelle salt crystals. Semple demonstrated some crystal pick-ups that Brush was working with, leading Chorpening and Woodworth to found The Astatic Microphone Laboratory, Inc. in Youngstown, Ohio in 1933. Semple was brought into the company as general manager to manufacture and market the company's model D-104 Crystal Microphone as well as other crystal microphones, <b>crystal</b> phonograph <b>pickups</b> and recording heads. In 1944, Astatic moved operations to Conneaut, Ohio and supplied microphones, <b>pickups</b> and <b>crystal</b> cartridges as well as hydrophone and Sonar devices to the military during World War II.|$|R
50|$|Alan Stivell {{writes in}} his book Telenn, la harpe bretonne of his first dreams of {{electric}} harps {{going back to the}} late 1950s. He designed and had made a solid body (after different electric-acoustic harps) electric harp {{at the turn of the}} 1970s-80s, about the same time as Rudiger Oppermann. Alan Stivell later (early 80s) had a meeting with Joel Garnier who decided to create a model. Alan Stivell went on independently to design and have different single models been made with Leo Goas-Straajer (before the Camac-Alan Stivell last experiment). The first such commercially manufactured instrument was made by Camac, also helped later by the request of jazz-pop harpist Deborah Henson-Conant. The result looked like a light framed Celtic-style harp, but each string had a <b>crystal</b> (Piezo) <b>pickup</b> at its base. They can be plugged into various amplification systems, and players are able to use effects pedals similarly to electric guitar players. Another part of Henson-Conant's request was that she should be able to move around the stage with the harp, and thus the smaller electric harps usually include a system to strap the harp to one's body.|$|R
