5000|$|In 2016 Williams {{signed to}} Provident Label Group - Essential Records {{as a solo}} artist, four years after Zach Williams & The Reformation disbanded. He was also lead singer for both Brothers of Grace, and Zach Williams and the Brothers of Grace. In June 2016 he {{released}} his first solo single, [...] "Chain Breaker" [...] which reached No. 1 on the Hot Christian Songs Chart and the Top 10 on Christian radio. Following the single, Williams released a five-song EP, <b>Chain</b> <b>Breaker,</b> with producers Jonathan Smith and Colby Wedgeworth. Williams also formerly led worship at the Refuge Campus of Central Baptist Church in Jonesboro, Arkansas, where he was on staff from 2014-2017.|$|E
40|$|An {{equation}} for quenching distance {{based on}} the destruction of chain carriers by the surface is derived. The equation expresses the quenching distance {{in terms of the}} diffusion coefficients and partial pressures of the chain carriers and gas phase molecules, the efficiency of the surface as a <b>chain</b> <b>breaker,</b> the total pressure of the mixture, and a constant which depends on the geometry of the quenching surface. Quenching distances measured by flashback for propane-air flames are shown to be consistent with the mechanism. The derived equation is used with the lean inflammability limit and a rate constant calculated from burning velocity data to estimate quenching distances for propane-air (hydrocarbon lean) flames satisfactorily...|$|E
40|$|The ship {{research}} project DESSO (Design for Survival Onboard) aims at improving {{the safety of}} RO/RO (roll-on/roll-off) ferries. The project was organized {{in the autumn of}} 2003 in order to use the research and development resources existing in Sweden, combined with international expertise, for a radical RO/RO concept with a focus on safety. One part {{in the early stages of}} this project was to identify <b>chain</b> <b>breakers</b> from previous accidents, that is, something that would have prevented, stopped, or reduced the consequences of the Incident event, in order to obtain a realistic basis of "working on the right problem. " A systematic and in-depth analysis of a few selected significant and well-documented disasters was made using the event-chain method. The identified <b>chain</b> <b>breakers</b> were further categorized and analyzed to find ideas and concepts that would prevent these events from occurring. These efforts were further developed into a method where the graphics of event <b>chains</b> with <b>chain</b> <b>breakers</b> are used in workshops with experts in two stages. In general, it was found that "Management" in most cases was the initial cause of the events. Often, "Management" was also the reason for the continuing or worsening of the events. As such, education/training and stricter routines were found to be the most effective methods for reducing accidents and are at the same time an inexpensive measure to take. This, together with online stability calculations and decision-support systems, would have prevented most of the accidents analyzed in this work...|$|R
60|$|The {{aspect of}} the river and the {{adjacent}} coast was wild and dangerous. The mouth of the Columbia is upwards of four miles wide with a peninsula and promontory on one side, and a long low spit of land on the other; between which a sand bar and <b>chain</b> of <b>breakers</b> almost block the entrance. The interior of the country rises into successive ranges of mountains, which, {{at the time of the}} arrival of the Tonquin, were covered with snow.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: An {{analysis}} has been performed to derive a frequency weighting {{for the development}} of vibration-induced white finger (VWF). It employs a model to compare health risks for pairs of population groups that are selected to have similar health outcomes from operating power tools or machines with markedly different acceleration spectra (rock drills, <b>chain</b> saws, pavement <b>breakers</b> and motorcycles). The model defines the Relative Risk, RRf(trial), which is constructed from the ratio of daily exposures and includes a trial frequency weighting that is applied to the acceleration spectra. The trial frequency weighting consists of a frequency-independent primary frequency range, and subordinate frequency ranges in which the response to vibration diminishes, with cutoff frequencies that are changed to influence the magnitude of RRf(trial). The frequency weighting so derived when RRf(trial) = 1 is similar to those obtained by other methods (Whf, WhT). It consists of a frequency independent range from about 25 Hz to 500 Hz (â€“ 3 dB frequencies), with an amplitude cut-off rate of 12 dB/octave below 25 Hz and above 500 Hz. The range is compatible with studies of vasoconstriction in persons with VWF. The results provide further evidence that the ISO frequency weighting may be inappropriate for assessing the risk of developing VWF...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} antioxidant enzymes is superoxide dismutase (SOD), which catalyses the dismutation of superoxide radicals to hydrogen peroxide. The enzyme {{plays an important role in}} diseases like trisomy 21 and also in theories of the mechanisms of aging. But instead of being beneficial, intensified oxidative stress is associated with the increased expression of SOD and also studies on bacteria and transgenic animals show that high levels of SOD actually lead to increased lipid peroxidation and hypersensitivity to oxidative stress. Using mathematical models we investigate the question how overexpression of SOD can lead to increased oxidative stress, although it is an antioxidant enzyme. We consider the following possibilities that have been proposed in the literature: (i) Reaction of H 2 O 2 with CuZnSOD leading to hydroxyl radical formation. (ii) Superoxide radicals might reduce membrane damage by acting as radical <b>chain</b> <b>breaker.</b> (iii) While detoxifying superoxide radicals SOD cycles between a reduced and oxidized state. At low superoxide levels the intermediates might interact with other redox partners and increase the superoxide reductase (SOR) activity of SOD. This short-circuiting of the SOD cycle could lead to an increased hydrogen peroxide production. We find that only one of the proposed mechanisms is under certain circumstances able to explain the increased oxidative stress caused by SOD. But furthermore we identified an additional mechanism that is of more general nature and might be a common basis for the experimental findings. We call it the alternative pathway mechanism...|$|E
40|$|Background: Although some {{occupational}} {{sources of}} hand-transmitted vibration (HTV) have been extensively investigated, {{the risks associated}} with others are poorly characterized. Methods: A questionnaire was mailed to a community sample of 12, 240 men aged 16 - 64 years and 906 men from the armed forces. Questions covered current occupation, sources of HTV, numbness or tingling in the fingers in the past week, and finger blanching. In the 5, 364 respondents who had been at work in the past week, associations between symptoms and exposures were examined by logistic regression, with odds ratios converted into prevalence ratios (PRs). Results: Altogether, 513 men (10 %) reported cold-induced finger blanching and 769 (14 %) sensory symptoms in the fingers. The risk of blanching was increased in builders (PR 2. 4, 95 % CI 1. 0 - 5. 2), carpenters and joiners (PR 1. 9, 95 % CI 1. 0 - 3. 4), motor mechanics (PR 2. 3, 95 % CI 1. 1 - 4. 6), and laborers (PR 2. 8, 95 % CI 1. 3 - 6. 0); while the risk of sensory symptoms was elevated in laborers (PR 4. 0, 95 % CI 2. 3 - 6. 6) and plant operatives (PR 3. 5, 95 % CI 1. 9 - 5. 9). Use of hand-guided mowers, concrete <b>breakers,</b> <b>chain</b> saws, and jig saws was significantly associated with symptoms. Conclusions: Little {{attention has been paid to}} the risks of vibration injury in construction workers, woodworkers, motor mechanics, and laborers, or to the risks from mowers, jig saws and several other common vibratory tools. These should be a focus for further investigation and preventive measures...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, {{soldiers}} positioned at Tacoma's military bases provided {{the foundation for}} a growing hip-hop fan base in the Northwest. This increased demand for hip-hop coincided with some of the first hip-hop dances in Seattle, which were held at public-housing recreation centers and featured the Emerald Street Boys and Anthony [...] "Sir Mix-A-Lot" [...] Ray. Simultaneously, [...] "Nasty Nes" [...] Rodriguez launched the Northwest's first all-rap radio program, Fresh Tracks, and soon Nasty Nes began airing self-produced tracks by Sir Mix-A-Lot, as well as the Emerald Street Boys, MC LeRap, PDQ, and Andy Hamlin. Fresh Tracks was a 30-minute show that played on Sunday nights on KKFX 1250 ("KFOX" [...] and formerly KKDZ), and consisted of a mix of new songs and a mastermix created by Nasty Nes (Stranger article). These mixes were made up of songs by The World's Famous Supreme Team, Malcolm McLaren, Run-D.M.C. and others (Stranger article). Due to the show's popularity, the station's producer allowed Nes to expand it to a Monday through Friday, 9pm to midnight show called NightBeat that featured prominent R&B songs as well as intermixed rap songs (Stranger article). As Seattle's music scene evolved, so did the Seattle breakdance and graffiti crews, including B-Boy groups like Silver <b>Chain</b> Gang, Circuit <b>Breakers,</b> and Breaking Mechanism, and graffiti writers such as Spaide, DadOne, and Spraycan. At this time the Northwest was considered an empty canvas, which lagged behind other regions in creating a unique identity that was associated with hip hop. With this space there was room for an eclectic group of identities to form, however none were successful in formulating a Seattle identity.|$|R
