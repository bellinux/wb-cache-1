50|$|Melicertus kerathurus, {{the striped}} prawn or <b>caramote</b> <b>prawn</b> is {{a species of}} tiger prawn from the family Penaeidae which occurs in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea which is an {{important}} species in commercial fisheries. It is the type species for the genus Melicertus.|$|E
40|$|The {{profile and}} {{distribution}} of fatty acids in neutral lipids, phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine of appreciated crustaceans species caught in the Adriatic Sea during the autumn months, namely <b>caramote</b> <b>prawn</b> (Penaeus kerathurus), mantis shrimp (Squilla mantis) and crab (Liocarcinus vernalis), were investigated. The crab’s total fatty acid profile significantly differed from that of <b>caramote</b> <b>prawn</b> and mantis shrimp. Crab was the most valuable dietary source of omega- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n– 3 PUFA), with approximately 2 -fold higher eicosapentaenoic acid content (131. 6 ± 31. 6 mg/ 100 g of edible part) than <b>caramote</b> <b>prawn</b> and mantis shrimp. The <b>caramote</b> <b>prawn</b> presented the highest furan fatty acids (F-acids) level (2. 5 ± 0. 5 mg/ 100 g). All crustaceans preferentially accumulated the n– 3 PUFA in phosphatidylethanolamine fraction. The F-acid distribution among the lipid classes changed according to the crustacean species. Crab presented F-acids mainly in the neutral lipid whereas <b>caramote</b> <b>prawn</b> contained them predominantly in the phospholipids. On the contrary, F-acids were not detected in the phosphatidylcholine of mantis shrimp. These differences in the distribution suggest different nutritional and health properties given by the consumption of the crustaceans investigated. Moreover, the F-acid profile of the different lipid classes {{could be used to}} discriminate these crustaceans...|$|E
40|$|The {{relative}} {{growth of}} eleven body parts (carapace length, height, width, abdominal length, height and width, rostral length and telson length) {{of males and}} females of the <b>caramote</b> <b>prawn</b> Melicertus kerathurus was studied in samples from the Amvrakikos Gulf (Western Greece, E. Mediterranean). In addition to this, the relative growth of the length and the maximum width – and consequently the surface - of the appendix masculina of males was also studied. In general, both sexes showed similar patterns of relative growth. However, the females’ body appendages were significantly greater than those of the males. A negative allometry of escaping appendages (telson), abdomen (related to the metabolic processes, rapid locomotion and reproduction), rostrum, appendix masculina (related to mating and sperm transfer) and carapace height and width was found in both sexes. The biometric studies in this species in the central and western Mediterranean are in agreement with those from {{the eastern part of the}} basin, suggesting that all the populations throughout the Mediterranean could be considered as uniform...|$|E
40|$|A {{fleet of}} 326 bottom {{trawlers}} operate in Greek Seas and their landings represent approximately 30 % {{of the total}} fish production in Greece. In this study, otter trawl landings data were analyzed {{in order to identify}} potential métiers. Landings data between 2002 and 2006 were used, collected from 42 ports in the Aegean and East Ionian Sea. A three-step procedure was applied to identify potential métiers: the first step involved a factorial analysis of the log-transformed landings profiles, the second step a classification of the factorial coordinates, and the third step a further aggregation of clusters based on expert knowledge. In all, six potential métiers were identified in the Aegean Sea, and five in the Ionian Sea. The most important target species were European hake (Merluccius merluccius), deepwater pink shrimp (Parapenaeus longirostris), red mullet (Mullus barbatus), <b>caramote</b> <b>prawn</b> (Melicertus kerathurus), picarel (Spicara smaris), cephalopods, bogue (Boops boops), anglers (Lophiusspp.), and Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus). Otter trawls in Greece use {{more or less the same}} gear with minor modification, and métier selection is basically reflected as a choice of geographical sub-area and hauling depth. The limitations of using landings profiles to identify métiers and the need for further verification are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Penaeid prawn {{are highly}} valued {{throughout}} the Mediterranean Sea where they support artisanal fisheries {{that may be}} affected by coastal fish farming. We {{examined the effects of}} proximity to costal fish farms on body size and stable isotope composition of the <b>caramote</b> <b>prawn</b> Melicertus kerathurus, a species that supports a valuable artisanal fishery. Prawn sampled near fish cages were significantly larger, heavier and more depleted in 13 C than those sampled further away, while laboratory trials confirmed that prawn can readily feed on fish food pellets. Proximity to fish farms had no effect on 15 N isotope values, which became depleted with increasing body size, possibly as a result of organ differentiation during ontogeny. Our results indicate that fish farms can {{have a positive effect on}} the size of prawn in the vicinity of floating cages, possibly by facilitating their growth or by protecting them from the fishery. However, fish farms can also affect the isotope composition of wild prawn, and thus likely their nutritional value. These findings highlight the need to examine the potential effects of fish farms on prawn fisheries in the Mediterranean region, an area where artisanal fisheries and coastal aquaculture need to coexist in the same locations. This study was funded by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitivity (FATFISH project, CTM 2009 - 14362 -C 02 - 01) ...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{the flesh}} yield and {{proximate}} contents of <b>caramote</b> <b>prawn,</b> Penaeus kerathurus, were researched depending on sex and seasons. Furthermore, prawns {{were divided into}} two groups for freshness assessments at two different times. The first group of prawn was completely wrapped with the stretch film and aluminium foil and stored at room temperature. The second group was placed in water with ice and stored at 4 ± 1 °C (ice storage). The shelf-life of P. kerathurus was determined. Trimethylamine-nitrogen (TMA-N) and pH were analysed to determine biochemical quality and total mesophilic count (TMC) was measured to determine the microbial quality. In addition, sensory analyses were also carried out. The flesh yield of P. kerathurus was on average 52 %. It was found that percentages on average moisture, lipid, protein, and ash contents in P. kerathurus were 76. 27 %, 1. 63 %, 16. 52 %, and 1. 98 %, respectively, and these values changed depending on the season (P< 0. 01). Increases in TMA-N, pH, TMC values and changes in the sensory parameters were found statistically significant (P< 0. 05) in prawns throughout storage. According to sensory, chemical, and microbial analyses, it was found that shelf-life of P. kerathurus wrapped with aluminium foil and stretch film and stored at room temperature was 1 day. The shelf-life of P. kerathurus for ice storage was 9 days...|$|E
40|$|The two ovaries of the <b>caramote</b> <b>prawn</b> Melicertus kerathurus lie {{above the}} {{hepatopancreas}} {{and below the}} pericardial sinus and the heart. Both ovaries were reduced in general size with white compact and sickle-shaped contents during January- March. Their contents attain gradually a pale green colour in April- June. This stage is an early maturing in which the ovary increased in size and the anterior and middle lobes are developing. When the ovary is immature the surface is relatively smooth and homogenous, but as the organ grows the surface acquires an increasingly irregular ppearance. They contain oocytes and small spherical ova with light-stained cytoplasm free from granules and a conspicuous nucleus. During July-September, mature stage in which the ovary is in a maximal size and filled with vitellogeneic and ripe oocytes. They were dark green. During October- December, the gonad reverted gradually to the immature condition i. e., the ovary undergoes a spent-recovering and was {{with varying degrees of}} yellow colour. For each season three ovaries were studied carefully through serial histological preparations. The length and width for each histological section was measured using slide micrometer (4 cm & 3 cm) respectively. The different stages of oocyte developmental stages were counted and analyzed in each season through One Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) with p< 0. 05 and Tukey's Multiple Comparison Test. This calibrations clarified that the oogonia predominate the ovary during winter season, the previtellogenic oocytes predominate the ovary during spring season, the vitellogenic oocyte...|$|E
