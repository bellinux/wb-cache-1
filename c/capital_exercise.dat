The 2011 EBA <b>capital</b> <b>exercise</b> provides an almost ideal quasi-natural experiment, which allows us to identify the effect of higher capital requirements using a difference-in-differences matching estimator. We find that treated banks increase their capital ratios not by raising their levels of equity, but by reducing their credit supply.

On the same day, the European Banking Authority (EBA) will also be publishing {{the results of}} its stress test, covering 123 banks across 22 European Economic Area (EEA) countries. For the ECB, it will be a matter of setting the standard for its future task, whereas EBA, seeks to restore the confidence it lost in the 2011 stress test and 2012 <b>capital</b> <b>exercise.</b> Both institutions will need to indicate how they will cooperate in the future in these tasks, and through enhanced disclosure, strengthen the confidence in the European banking system...|$|E

40|$|During recent years, a wide {{spectrum}} of research has questioned whether public services/infrastructure procurement through private finance, as exemplified by the UK Private Finance Initiative (PFI), meets minimum standard of democratic accountability. While broadly agreeing with some of these arguments, this paper suggests that this debate is flawed on two grounds. Firstly, PFI is not about effective procurement, or even about a pragmatic choice of procurement mechanisms which can potentially compromise public involvement and input; rather it is about a process where the state creates new profit opportunities {{at a time when the}} international financial system is increasingly lacking in safe investment opportunities. Secondly, because of its primary function as investment opportunity, PFI, by its very nature, prioritises the risk-return criteria of private finance over the needs of the public sector client and its stakeholders. Using two case studies of recent PFI projects, the paper illustrates some of the mechanisms through which finance <b>capital</b> <b>exercises</b> control over the PFI procurement process. The paper concludes that recent proposals aimed at “reforming” or “democratising” PFI fail to recognise the objective constraints which this type of state-finance capital nexus imposes on political process. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to offer an {{explanation}} of why a developing country may adopt a partial reform under which foreign direct investments are controlled. We consider a country where the ruling elite [referred to as State capital] prevents the entry of Foreign capital and taxes the private sector before reform. The impetus to reform comes from an improved productivity of Foreign capital. The reform diminishes State capital's ability to tax the private sector but allows it to extract payment from Foreign capital for access to its markets. We show that a higher productivity of Foreign capital always increases the attractiveness of a partial reform under which State capital can control the inflow of Foreign capital. In contrast, a higher productivity of Foreign capital can reduce the attractiveness of a full reform under which the entry of Foreign capital is unregulated. Our analysis implies that, under the circumstances where the impetus to reform comes from improvements in Foreign productivity, State <b>capital's</b> <b>exercise</b> of control over Foreign capital's inflow may be a necessary condition for the reform to take place at all. In the absence of such a control, State capital may be reluctant to carry out the efficiency-enhancing reforms. "...|$|R

40|$|The recent {{emergence}} of Sydney as the “gay {{capital of the}} South Pacific” and as an important destination in the itineraries of lesbian and gay tourists has been {{closely tied to the}} growth and development of the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras and to the concomitant expansion and rapid diversification of the Australian gay and lesbian tourism industry, especially since the early 1990 s. Beginning as an evening street parade following a day of political protest in 1978 —a local commemoration of the New York Stonewall riots at a time when male homosexual acts were illegal in New South Wales—and ending that day in a civil riot with at least fifty-three arrests, Mardi Gras has grown into a three-week international cultural festival that was estimated to have generated some AU$ 99 million (U. S. $ 55 million) in 1998 and that seems to attract more tourists to the nation than any other special event, as well as garnering the support of various corporate and government sponsors. This essay examines the contribution that Mardi Gras has made to the construction of Sydney as a world-class gay and lesbian city, a city that has changed from an industrial port to a cosmopolitan, global capital increasingly dependent, for the last two to three decades, on an economy driven by consumption and leisure. In particular, I will focus on the tensions that result from the competing demands placed on Mardi Gras by the needs and desires of its diverse gay and lesbian constituency and from the demands of global <b>capital</b> <b>exercised</b> through the gay and lesbian tourism industry. I will also show that Sydney’s treatment of its gay and lesbian citizens has been and continues to be deeply contradictory.

Controlling for non-discretionary determinants of loan loss provisions, we find that banks reduce provisions when an increase in capital requirements puts pressure on eligible capital for regulatory purposes. Additionally, we find that banks’ regulatory capital position influences provisioning behavior. We show that a stronger regulatory capital position coming into the year yields higher levels of loan loss provisions, while an improvement in regulatory capital position during the year constitutes a reduction in loan loss provisions. When studying SIFI-banks and IRB-banks, we find no evidence indicating that newly enacted regulations are effective in limiting discretionary provisions for regulatory purposes.

50|$|The term “prudential” distinguishes such typical capital control {{measures}} from other general capital controls by emphasizing both the motive of “prudence” and the ex-ante timing. Firstly, the prudence motivation requirement says that such regulation should curb {{and manage the}} excessive risk accumulation process with cautious forethoughts {{for the purpose of}} preventing an emerging financial crisis and economic collapse. Secondly, the ex-ante timing means that such regulation should be taken effectively before the realization of any unfettered crisis as opposed to taking policy interventions after a severe crisis already hits the economy. In addition, prudential capital controls only apply to capital inflows because the excessive risk accumulation process that intrinsically creates the domestic financial vulnerability is usually associated with capital inflow rather than outflow. Neely (1999) summarized some other nonprudential ways of <b>exercising</b> <b>capital</b> controls.

40|$|An {{important}} role for bank capital {{is that of}} a buffer against unexpected losses. As uncertainty about these losses increases, the theory predicts an increase in the optimal level of bank capital. This paper investigates this implication empirically with U. S. Commercial Banks data and finds statistically significant and robust evidence supporting it. A counterfactual experiment suggests that a decline in uncertainty to the lowest level measured in the sample generates an average reduction in bank capital ratios of slightly over 1 percentage point. However, I also find suggestive evidence that the intensity of this precautionary motive is stronger during recessions. From a policy perspective, these results suggest that the effectiveness of countercyclical capital requirements during bad times will be undermined by banks desire to hold more capital in response to increased uncertainty.
