The miller can adjust the amount of <b>cloth</b> <b>spread</b> according {{to the amount of}} wind available and power needed. In medieval mills, the sailcloth was wound {{in and out of a}} ladder type arrangement of sails. Postmedieval mill sails had a lattice framework over which the sailcloth was spread, while in colder climates, the cloth was replaced by wooden slats, which were easier to handle in freezing conditions. The jib sail is commonly found in Mediterranean countries, and consists of a simple triangle of cloth wound round a spar.|$|R

Then Peter and the little man fell to with might and main, and ate till they could eat no more. After they were done, the two tall men took table and dishes and all back into the bottle again, and the little gentleman corked it up.|$|R

60|$|She {{was hardly}} past us, when I could see {{preparations}} making {{to take in}} canvass. At the instant she overshadowed us with her huge wings, this vessel had top-gallant-sails set, with two top-mast, and a lower studding-sail, besides carrying the lee-clew of her main-sail down, and the other customary <b>cloth</b> <b>spread.</b> Up went her main-sail, {{almost as soon as}} the captain made the signal with his arm; then all three of the top-gallant-sails were flying at the same moment. Presently, the yards were alive with men, and the loose canvass was rolled up, and the gaskets passed. While this was doing, down came all the studding-sails together, much as a bird shuts its wings. The booms disappeared immediately after.|$|R

She came and found him {{sweating}} and his sweat falling on the leather <b>cloth</b> <b>spread</b> on her bed. She opened her scent-bag and began to fill the bottles with it.

On each saddle cloth, in similar positions, lay each man’s full equipment of about 25 separate items, all cleaned and polished up to the nines—saddles, stirrups and irons, bridles and bits, water bottles, feed bags, greatcoats, saddle bags, dixies, etc. etc." [...] On Friday 17 August, the Division moved back to El Fukhan.

Rollo put his head {{between two of the}} spectators to see. There was a man seated in the centre, on the ground, with a <b>cloth</b> <b>spread</b> out before him, on which was a monstrous heap of stockings, of all kinds and colors, which he was selling as fast as possible to the men and women that had gathered around him. He sold them very cheap, and the people bought them very fast. He put the money, as fast as he received it, in his cap, which lay on the ground before him, and served him for a cash box.|$|R

50|$|White Roding Windmill {{was built}} in 1877, {{replacing}} a post mill which had stood on the site since 1609. The post mill was destroyed on 1 January 1877 when the main post broke in a gale as the miller had too much <b>cloth</b> <b>spread</b> on the Common sails. A new tower mill was built by Whitmore's the Wickham Market, Suffolk millwrights to replace the post mill. The mill worked by wind until 1926, and then by engine until 1931. The lease on the mill expired that year and was not renewed. In 1937, the mill was purchased by the actor Michael Redgrave, passing to a company in Barrow-in-Furness in 1946. During the 1950s, the mill was derelict and threatened with demolition {{on more than one}} occasion. In the 1970s, millwrights Philip Barrett-Lennard and Vincent Pargeter built a new cap for the mill.|$|R
5000|$|There {{were for}} centuries {{regional}} differences in what constituted a huppah. Indeed, Solomon Freehof {{finds that the}} wedding canopy was unknown before the 16th century. Alfred J. Kolatch notes that {{it was during the}} Middle Ages that the chupa ... in use today became customary. Daniel Sperber notes that for many communities prior to the 16th century, the huppah consisted of a veil worn by the bride. In others, it was a <b>cloth</b> <b>spread</b> over the shoulders of the bride and groom. Numerous illustrations of Jewish weddings in medieval Europe, North Africa and Italy show no evidence of a huppah as it is known today. Moses Isserles (1520-1572) notes that the portable marriage canopy was widely adopted by Ashkenazi Jews (as a symbol of the chamber within which marriages originally took place) in the generation before he composed his commentary to the Shulchan Aruch.|$|R
5000|$|John Edmund Kerrich {{performed}} {{experiments in}} coin flipping {{and found that}} a coin made from a wooden disk {{about the size of}} a crown and coated on one side with lead landed heads (wooden side up) 679 times out of 1000. [...] In this experiment the coin was tossed by balancing it on the forefinger, flipping it using the thumb so that it spun through the air for about a foot before landing on a flat <b>cloth</b> <b>spread</b> over a table. Edwin Thompson Jaynes claimed that when a coin is caught in the hand, instead of being allowed to bounce, the physical bias in the coin is insignificant compared to the method of the toss, where with sufficient practice a coin can be made to land heads 100% of the time. Exploring the problem of checking whether a coin is fair is a well-established pedagogical tool in teaching statistics.|$|R

60|$|Yet {{another type}} of French general takes us round this morning! He, too, is a man apart, an unforgettable man. Conceive {{a man with a}} large broad good-humoured face, and two placid, dark seal's eyes which gaze gently into yours. He is young and has pink cheeks and a soft voice. Such {{is one of the most}} redoubtable fighters of France, this General of Division D. His former staff {{officers}} told me something of the man. He is a philosopher, a fatalist, impervious to fear, a dreamer of distant dreams amid the most furious bombardment. The weight of the French assault upon the terrible labyrinth fell at one time upon the brigade which he then commanded. He led them day after day gathering up Germans with the detached air of the man of science who is hunting for specimens. In whatever shell-hole he might chance to lunch he had his <b>cloth</b> <b>spread</b> and decorated with wild flowers plucked from the edge. If fate be kind to him he will go far. Apart from his valour he is admitted to be one of the most scientific soldiers of France.|$|R
