5000|$|Transparent positives of {{the three}} images were viewed in Ives' Kromskop (a device known generically as a <b>chromoscope</b> or photochromoscope), which used red, green and blue filters and {{transparent}} reflectors to visually combine them into one full-color image. Both monocular and stereoscopic Kromskop viewers were made. Prepared sets of images, called Kromograms, were sold for viewing in them. Alternatively, a Kromskop [...] "triple lantern" [...] projector {{could be used to}} illuminate each image with light of the correct color and exactly superimpose them on a projection screen.|$|E

40|$|With {{the launch}} of the Herschel and Planck {{missions}} coinciding with the International Year of Astronomy, the worldwide publicity for both of these missions is very high. To build on this publicity, the UK outreach activities were arranged by a group consisting of both academics and educators. A major component of the initial outreach was an exhibit at the Royal Society’s Summer Science Exhibition in London, which involved interactive elements described here. The <b>Chromoscope</b> tool, first used at this exhibition, is introduced, and some of the features outlined...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a practical program, called sim 2, for building local alignments of two sequences, {{each of which}} may be hundreds of kilobases long. Sim 2 first constructs n best non-intersecting chains of ‘‘fragments,’ ’ such as all occurrences of identical 5 -tuples in each of two DNA sequences, for any specified n ≥ 1. Each chain is then refined by delivering an optimal alignment in a region delimited by the chain. Sim 2 requires only space proportional {{to the size of the}} input sequences and the output alignments, and the same source code runs on UNIX machines, on Macintosh, on PC, and on DEC ALPHA PC. We also describe an application of sim 2 for aligning long DNA sequences from E. coli. Sim 2 facilitates contig-building by providing a complete view of the related sequences, so differences can be analyzed and inconsistencies resolved. Examples are shown using the alignment display and editing functions from the software tool, <b>ChromoScope...</b>|$|E
40|$|Susanne Liebmann was not {{the first}} to {{experiment}} with equiluminous color stimuli-Alfred Lehmann has examined geometrical illusions in his <b>Chromoscope</b> 24 years earlier and Pleikart Stumpf (see Perception 25 1231 - 1238), Wanda von Lempicka, Vittorio Benussi, and Wilhelmine von Lie 1 (later Benussi-Lid) had all reported some measurements of resolution and illusions at equiluminance (see Liebmann’s article for the references). However, Liebmann was the first to reveal the breadth of strange and curious phenomena that arise when colors are equated for luminance and she did so with astute observations and vivid writing. She had set out to re-examine the claim that irradiation (the expansion of the apparent extent of the lighter areas of the figure) was the underlying cause of several geometrical iltusions such as the Miinsterberg and Zijllner figures. Lefunann had tested this claim in 1904 by presenting the illusions at eqduminance to eliminate the effects of irradiation. He reported that the illusions disappeared at equiluminance and argued that the irradiation theory was correct. Liebmann’s advisor, Wolfgang Kijhler, suggested that she take another look at thes...|$|E
