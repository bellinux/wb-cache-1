Stevenson also recommended that the carrying of <b>concealed</b> <b>weapons</b> be outlawed. The General Assembly passed the requested legislation on March 22, 1871. The law imposed small fines for the first offense, but the amount rapidly increased for subsequent infractions in order to deter repeat offenders.|$|E

5|$|Hoping to {{take the}} stronghold by surprise, on May 7 Pontiac entered Fort Detroit with about 300 men {{carrying}} <b>concealed</b> <b>weapons.</b> The British had learned of Pontiac's plan, however, and were armed and ready. His tactic foiled, Pontiac withdrew after a brief council and, two days later, laid siege to the fort. Pontiac and his allies killed all of the British soldiers and settlers they could find outside of the fort, including women and children. One of the soldiers was ritually cannibalized, as was the custom in some Great Lakes Native cultures. The violence was directed at the British; French colonists were generally left alone. Eventually more than 900 soldiers from a half-dozen tribes joined the siege. Meanwhile, on May 28 a British supply column from Fort Niagara led by Lieutenant Abraham Cuyler was ambushed and defeated at Point Pelee.|$|E

40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this research is}} {{to examine the relationship between}} the relaxation of Virginia 2 ̆ 7 s <b>concealed</b> <b>weapon</b> law, which became effective July 1, 1995, and three crime-related variables. Although there have been two major studies conducted in this area on a national basis, this research represents the first time a study has been conducted in Virginia. A secondary {{objective of this}} research is to examine relevant data to determine if this change in the law influenced the purchasing behavior of citizens regarding handguns and the issuance rate for <b>concealed</b> <b>weapon</b> permits. An interrupted time-series design is employed in examining the data for three crime-related variables over a six-year period, July 1, 1990 through June 30, 1996. Multiple Linear Regression is used to determine the characteristics of the trend data. Additionally, data for the two weapons-related variables are examined over a three-year period, July 1, 1993 through June 30, 1996. The research is an attempt to show that after the relaxing of the <b>concealed</b> <b>weapon</b> law (independent variable), (1) the crime rates for murder, aggravated assault and robbery increased, (2) the number of <b>concealed</b> <b>weapon</b> permits issued by the courts increased and (3) the number of handguns sold by Virginia 2 ̆ 7 s federally licensed firearms dealers increased (dependent variables). Uniform Crime Reporting data were used in the analysis of the crime-related variables for the six-year period of this study. Data from the Firearms Transaction Center of the Department of State Police were used in the examination of the weapon-related variables for the only three years that this data has been collected. Because the effective date of the change in Virginia 2 ̆ 7 s <b>concealed</b> <b>weapon</b> law was July 1, 1995, only one year of data after the change was available for analysis. The study revealed that the change in Virginia 2 ̆ 7 s <b>concealed</b> <b>weapon</b> law had no significant impact on the crime rates for murder, aggravated assault and robbery. The research reflected that the rate of <b>concealed</b> <b>weapon</b> permits issued by the courts increased significantly — over 400...|$|R
