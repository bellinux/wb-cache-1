5|$|The {{most common}} use of {{platinum}} is {{as a catalyst}} in chemical reactions, often as platinum black. It has been employed as a catalyst since the early 19th century, when platinum powder was used to catalyze the ignition of hydrogen. Its most important application is in automobiles as a catalytic converter, which allows the <b>complete</b> <b>combustion</b> of low concentrations of unburned hydrocarbons from the exhaust into carbon dioxide and water vapor. Platinum is also used in the petroleum industry as a catalyst {{in a number of}} separate processes, but especially in catalytic reforming of straight-run naphthas into higher-octane gasoline that becomes rich in aromatic compounds. PtO2, also known as Adams' catalyst, is used as a hydrogenation catalyst, specifically for vegetable oils. Platinum also strongly catalyzes the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen and it is used in fuel cells as a catalyst for the reduction of oxygen.|$|E

50|$|The {{combustion}} chamber formed with the sleeve {{at the top}} of its stroke is ideal for <b>complete,</b> detonation-free, <b>combustion</b> of the charge, as it does not have to contend with compromised chamber shape and hot exhaust (poppet) valves.|$|R
25|$|As {{for other}} <b>complete</b> <b>combustion</b> processes, {{nearly all of}} the carbon content in the waste is emitted as CO2 to the atmosphere. MSW {{contains}} approximately the same mass fraction of carbon as CO2 itself (27%), so incineration of 1 ton of MSW produces approximately 1 ton of CO2.|$|E
25|$|Aside from {{physical}} or chemical analyses {{to determine the}} handling and pollutant profile of a coal, the energy output of a coal is determined using a bomb calorimeter which measures the specific energy output of a coal during <b>complete</b> <b>combustion.</b> This is required particularly for coals used in steam generation.|$|E
25|$|Secondary {{combustion}} air is supplied into the boiler {{at high speed}} through nozzles over the grate. It facilitates <b>complete</b> <b>combustion</b> of the flue gases by introducing turbulence for better mixing and by ensuring a surplus of oxygen.

The improvement by means of which NO{sub x} gases are removed is directed to introducing NO{sub x}-free oxidizing gas such as compressor air into the second, fuel-lean zone and <b>completing</b> <b>combustion</b> with this source of oxidizing gas.

40|$|AbstractSugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) {{and corn}} (Zea mays, Linn.) is widely planted in Thailand. The {{pyrolysis}} {{process has been}} carried out in thermochemical processing of organic decomposition of biomass to increase the value of the biomass. The aim {{of this study was to}} research the probability of sugarcane leaves and corn stover for pyrolysis process. The proximate analysis results indicate that corn stover has a volatile content higher than sugarcane leaves. Sugarcane leaves have a higher ash content than corn stover. The heating value was obtained 14. 47 and 20. 91 MJ/kg for sugarcane leaves and corn stover, respectively. TGA results show 4 stages: dehydration, active pyrolysis passive pyrolysis and <b>completed</b> <b>combustion</b> stage. Furthermore, the thermal degradation of biomass could be considered an optimization of temperature for pyrolysis process...|$|R
25|$|Masonry heaters were {{developed}} to control air flow in stoves. A masonry heater is designed to allow <b>complete</b> <b>combustion</b> by burning fuels at full-temperature with no restriction of air inflow. Due to its large thermal mass the captured heat is radiated {{over long periods of}} time without the need of constant firing, and the surface temperature is generally not dangerous to touch.|$|E
25|$|Propane lacks additives, {{detergents}} {{or other}} chemical enhancements further reducing the exhaust output from the tailpipe. The cleaner combustion also has fewer particulate emissions, lower NOx {{due to the}} <b>complete</b> <b>combustion</b> of the gas within the cylinder, higher exhaust temperatures increasing {{the efficiency of the}} catalyst and deposits less acid and carbon inside the engine which extends the useful life of the lubricating oil.|$|E
25|$|The {{calorific value}} of {{biodiesel}} is about 37.27 MJ/kg. This is 9% lower than regular Number 2 petrodiesel. Variations in biodiesel energy density is {{more dependent on}} the feedstock used than the production process. Still, these variations are less than for petrodiesel. It has been claimed biodiesel gives better lubricity and more <b>complete</b> <b>combustion</b> thus increasing the engine energy output and partially compensating for the higher energy density of petrodiesel.|$|E
25|$|A {{combustor}} {{must contain}} and maintain stable combustion despite very high air flow rates. To do so combustors are carefully designed to first mix and ignite {{the air and}} fuel, and then mix in more air to <b>complete</b> the <b>combustion</b> process. Early gas turbine engines used a single chamber known as a can type combustor. Today three main configurations exist: can, annular and cannular (also referred to as can-annular tubo-annular). Afterburners are often considered another type of combustor.|$|R
40|$|The {{hot blast}} stove {{is one of the}} most {{important}} equipment devices in the blast furnace iron making process. The temperature and duration of hot air are the crucial parameters to assess the performance of the {{hot blast stove}}. In order to sustain the desired high temperature air, it requires rapid <b>completed</b> <b>combustion</b> reaction, stable flue gas flow structure, and uniform temperature distribution throughout the regenerator. In the present work, a 3 D numerical model with all essential turbulence, heat transfer, and combustion considerations has been developed to assess the performance of a typical hot air stove. The flow field of the whole domain and temperature distribution within the regenerator were simulated using the model. The predicted results show that the velocity at each nozzle varies substantially due to the uneven pressure distribution in cavity of the traditional hot blast stove, generating the eccentric vortex that leads to nonuniform temperature distribution in the regenerator. In order to solve this problem, a new structure design of top combustion regenerative hot blast stove is proposed. Numerical simulations were then carried out to compare based on the performance of the new hot blast stove design against the traditional hot blast stove...|$|R
25|$|Due to a 50% longer stroke {{duration}} than a reciprocating four-cycle engine, {{there is}} more time to <b>complete</b> the <b>combustion.</b> This leads to greater suitability for direct fuel injection and stratified charge operation. A Wankel rotary engine has stronger flows of air-fuel mixture and a longer operating cycle than a reciprocating engine, achieving a concomitantly thorough mixing of hydrogen and air. The result is a homogeneous mixture and no hot spots in the engine, which is crucial for hydrogen combustion.|$|R
25|$|The acetyl-CoA {{produced}} by beta oxidation enters the citric acid cycle in the mitochondrion by combining with oxaloacetate to form citrate. This {{results in the}} <b>complete</b> <b>combustion</b> of the acetyl-CoA to CO2 and water. The energy released in this process is captured {{in the form of}} 1 GTP and 11 ATP molecules per acetyl-CoA molecule oxidized. This is the fate of acetyl-CoA wherever beta oxidation of fatty acids occurs, except under certain circumstances in the liver.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{treating}} wood, it {{was also}} used for lighting and fuel. In the beginning, it was only used for lighting needed in harbour and outdoor work, where the smoke that was produced from burning it was of little inconvenience. By 1879, lamps had been created that ensured a more <b>complete</b> <b>combustion</b> by using compressed air, removing the drawback of the smoke. Creosote was also processed into gas and used for lighting that way. As a fuel, {{it was used to}} power ships at sea and blast furnaces for different industrial needs, once it was discovered to be more efficient than unrefined coal or wood. It was also used industrially for the softening of hard pitch, and burned to produce lamp black. By 1890, the production of creosote in the United Kingdom totaled approximately 29,900,000 gallons per year.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the course}} of a season {{creosote}} deposits can become several inches thick. This creates a compounding problem, because the creosote deposits reduce the draft (airflow through the chimney) which increases the probability that the wood fire is not getting enough air for <b>complete</b> <b>combustion.</b> Since creosote is highly combustible, a thick accumulation creates a fire hazard. If a hot fire is built in the stove or fireplace, and the air control left wide open, this may allow hot oxygen into the chimney where it comes in contact with the creosote which then ignites—causing a chimney fire. Chimney fires often spread to the main building because the chimney gets so hot that it ignites any combustible material in direct contact with it, such as wood. The fire can also spread to the main building from sparks emitting from the chimney and landing on combustible roof surfaces. In order to properly maintain chimneys and heaters that burn wood or carbon-based fuels, the creosote buildup must be removed. Chimney sweeps perform this service for a fee.|$|E
50|$|The {{fuel-air}} mixture {{can only}} burn in slow-moving air, so {{an area of}} reverse flow is maintained by the fuel nozzles for the approximately stoichiometric burning in the primary zone. Further compressor air is introduced which <b>completes</b> the <b>combustion</b> process and reduces {{the temperature of the}} combustion products to a level which the turbine can accept. Less than 25% of the air is typically used for combustion, as an overall lean mixture is required to keep within the turbine temperature limits.|$|R

2500|$|With {{traditional}} {{gasoline and}} diesel engines the energy {{density of the}} air-fuel mixture is limited because the liquid fuels do not mix well in the cylinder.

[...] An important part of traditional engine design is designing the cylinders, compression ratios, and fuel injectors such that pre-ignition is avoided, {{but at the same}} time as much fuel as possible can be injected, become well mixed, and still have time to <b>complete</b> the <b>combustion</b> process during the power stroke.|$|R
25|$|The common {{distribution}} of a flame under normal gravity conditions depends on convection, as soot tends {{to rise to}} the top of a general flame, as in a candle in normal gravity conditions, making it yellow. In micro gravity or zero gravity, such as an environment in outer space, convection no longer occurs, and the flame becomes spherical, with a tendency to become more blue and more efficient (although it may go out if not moved steadily, as the CO2 from combustion does not disperse as readily in micro gravity, and tends to smother the flame). There are several possible explanations for this difference, of which the most likely is that the temperature is sufficiently evenly distributed that soot is not formed and <b>complete</b> <b>combustion</b> occurs. Experiments by NASA reveal that diffusion flames in micro gravity allow more soot to be completely oxidized after they are produced than diffusion flames on Earth, because of a series of mechanisms that behave differently in micro gravity when compared to normal gravity conditions. These discoveries have potential applications in applied science and industry, especially concerning fuel efficiency.|$|E
