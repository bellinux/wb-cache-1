40|$|To solve an easy-to-understand {{real world}} problem, we invite {{the reader to}} travel through many useful {{concepts}} related to the important models provided by the <b>compound</b> <b>normal</b> distributions. This class of distributions is a subclass of the multivariate elliptical distributions that allows a clearcut interpretation of a data generating mechanism useful in certain situations. A multivariate elliptical distribution {{is characterized by the}} existence of a particular function phi. In the special case of a <b>compound</b> <b>normal</b> distribution, the function phi appears to be simply the (one-sided) Laplace-Stieltjes transform (LST) of the mixing distribution. This fact allows in particular to easily express the covariance matrix and the kurtosis parameter of the <b>compound</b> <b>normal</b> in terms of derivatives-evaluated at the origin-of the LST of the mixing distributions. An example of application of the results is the asymptotic theory for canonical correlation analysis. The asymptotic distributions of the sample canonical correlation coefficients (and of statistics used for testing hypotheses about the population coefficients) have very simple forms in the case of <b>compound</b> <b>normal</b> distributions. They depend on the LST of the mixing distribution through the kurtosis parameter. Here we focalize our attention on inference on the simple correlation coefficient p of the compounents of bivariate <b>compound</b> <b>normal</b> distributions. We illustrate with a simple example in industrial engeneering how inference on p is affected by the choice of the associated mixing distributio...|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} {{volatility}} forecasting studies {{have led to}} the perception that the ARCH- and Stochastic Volatility-type models provide poor out-of-sample forecasts of volatility. This is primarily based on the use of traditional forecast evaluation criteria concerning the accuracy and the unbiasedness of forecasts. In this paper we provide an analytical assessment of volatility forecasting performance. We use the volatility and log volatility framework to prove how the inherent noise in the approximation of the true- and unobservable-volatility by the squared return, results in a misleading forecast evaluation, inflating the observed mean squared forecast error and invalidating the Diebold-Mariano statistic. We analytically characterize this noise and explicitly quantify its effects assuming normal errors. We extend our results using more general error structures such as the <b>Compound</b> <b>Normal</b> and the Gram-Charlier classes of distributions. We argue that evaluation problems are likely to be exacerbated by non-normality of the shocks and that non-linear and utility-based criteria can be more suitable for the evaluation of volatility forecasts. <b>Compound</b> <b>normal,</b> Expected utility, Forecasting, Gram-Charlier, Mean squared error, Non-normality, Simulation, Stochastic volatility,...|$|R

In order to study changes of pattern at different event horizons, {{as well as}} changes of pattern over time for a given event horizon, we have analysed high-frequency or short-horizon intraday returns up from 20 �s intervals to a full trading day, medium-frequency or medium-horizon daily returns and low-frequency or long-horizon returns with holding period up to 30 days. As for changes of pattern over time, we found that for medium-frequency returns there are relatively long periods of business-as-usual when the return-generating process is well-described by a normal distribution. We also found periods of ferment, when the volatility grows and complex time dependences tend to emerge, but the known time dependences cannot explain the variability of the distribution.
