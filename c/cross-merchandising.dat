40|$|Through the Technology Affiliates Program at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), {{valuable}} modifications {{were made}} to refrigerator displays built by Displaymor Manufacturing Company, Inc. By working with JPL, Displaymor could address stiffer requirements that ensure the freshness of foods. The application of the space technology meant that the small business {{would be able to}} continue to market its cases without incurring expenses that could threaten the viability of the business, and the future of several dozen jobs. Research and development improvements in air flow distribution and refrigeration coil technology contributed greatly to certifying Displaymor's showcases given the new federal regulations. These modifications resulted in a refrigerator case that will keep foods cooler, longer. Such changes maintained the openness of the display, critical to customer visibility and accessibility, impulse buying, and <b>cross-merchandising...</b>|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{presents a}} new approach to derive recommendations for segment-specific, targeted marketing campaigns on the product category level. The proposed methodological framework serves as a decision support tool for customer relationship managers or direct marketers to select attractive product categories for their target marketing efforts, such as segment-specific rewards in loyalty programs, <b>cross-merchandising</b> activities, targeted direct mailings, customized supplements in catalogues, or customized promotions. The proposed methodology requires cus- tomers' multi-category purchase histories as input data and proceeds in a stepwise manner. It combines various data compression techniques and integrates an opti- mization approach which suggests candidate product categories for segment-specific targeted marketing such that cross-category spillover effects for non-promoted categories are maximized. To demonstrate the empirical performance of our pro- posed procedure, we examine the transactions from a real-world loyalty program of a major grocery retailer. A simple scenario-based analysis using promotion responsiveness reported in previous empirical studies and prior experience by domain experts suggests that targeted promotions might boost profitability between 15...|$|E
40|$|Supermarkets ’ {{marketing}} {{and asked to}} make recommendations for possible store improvements. Our mission was to provide evidence to support our recommendations to the corporate office through observations, survey, focus groups and external research. Our goal was to increase revenue by increasing customer awareness of the store and increase items per customer. Our research methods included observations, a survey and a focus group designed to collect data from local Gainesville residents and store customers. Through this research, we have split our recommendations into four main components; cross merchandising, produce, traffic flow and advertising. Cross Merchandising Our first recommendation will focus on improving the <b>cross-merchandising</b> and end-cap displays throughout the store. We will make focused and cohesive displays of complementary items and easy meals that will entice customers to buy more items per visit to the store Traffic Flow Our next recommendation is to alter the traffic flow by directing customers toward the produce department. This will make it more challenging for the customer to walk straight into the deli are...|$|E

2500|$|Since {{the debut}} of the series, Creative Wonders ran various promotional campaigns for the Madeline games. The first entry Madeline and the Magnificent Puppet Show: A Learning Journey was {{released}} {{to coincide with the}} 1995 holiday season, as well as the ABC-TV premiere of the Saturday morning cartoon The New Adventures of Madeline in September; one of various pieces of Creative Wonders software, along with Bump in the Night and Free Willy, to be video game adaptions of ABC's 1995 Fall children's programming lineup. There were numerous promotions upon the launch of Madeline and the Magnificent Puppet Show, in order to <b>cross-merchandise</b> the CD-ROM title with the Madeline television show; one example is the create-your-own-puppet-show-scene contest where the grand prize include a personal Madeline appearance at the winner's puppet show and Madeline dolls from Eden Toys. According to Computer Retail Week, [...] "the initial shipment of CD-ROMs also included a [...] "32-piece kit that contains Madeline's napkins, plates and invitations", while shelf talkers and bookmark give-aways were also part of the promotion. The company used a portion of their marketing budget to fund [...] "eye-catching, stand-alone displays" [...] in the front of retail stores, which consisted of toy, software, doll, book, and video merchandise, in time for the Christmas season. The game was also showcased at the May 1995 Electronic Entertainment Expo, marking Creative Wonders' debut at the event.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{two ways}} to increase sales and customer loyalty {{by taking advantage of}} a store’s installed base of current customers. We propose a classification of products into two types. Products of Type 1 are products for which consumers have a loyalty to a specific retailer and as far as possible always shop that retailer for these products. The other products (Type 2) are not associated with any retailer and are bought at whichever retailer consumers happen to shop when they plan or remember to buy the product. With this in mind, we test the potential of two marketing tools to help retailers increase their share of sales of the Type 2 segment. Using a category destination program we show that one can successfully transform Type 2 into Type 1 products. Using <b>cross-merchandising</b> promotions, we show that one can increase the sales of Type 2 products thereby getting a larger share of discretionary purchases than what one would receive from a straight random allocation. Both series of tests yielded significant increases in sales and profits and were deemed successful by the retailers who implemented them...|$|E
