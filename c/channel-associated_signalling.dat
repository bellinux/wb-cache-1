40|$|This {{document}} specifies an Internet standards track {{protocol for}} the Internet community, and requests discussion {{and suggestions for}} improvements. Please refer to the current edition of the "Internet Official Protocol Standards " (STD 1) for the standardization state and status of this protocol. Distribution of this memo is unlimited. This memo updates RFC 4733 to add event codes for telephony signals used for <b>channel-associated</b> <b>signalling</b> when carried in the telephony event RTP payload. It supersedes and adds to the original assignment of event codes for this purpose in Section 3. 14 of RFC 2833. As documented in Appendix A of RFC 4733, some of the RFC 2833 events have been deprecated because their specification was ambiguous, erroneous, or redundant. In fact, the degree of change from Section 3. 14 of RFC 2833 is such that implementations of the present document will be fully backward compatible with RFC 2833 implementations onl...|$|E
50|$|<b>Channel-associated</b> <b>{{signaling}}</b> (CAS) {{employs a}} signaling channel which {{is dedicated to}} a specific bearer channel.|$|R
50|$|The logical {{alternative}} to CCS is <b>channel-associated</b> <b>signaling</b> (CAS), {{in which each}} bearer channel has a signaling channel dedicated to it.|$|R
50|$|In {{communication}} systems, robbed-bit signaling is {{a scheme}} to provide maintenance and line signaling services on many T1 digital carrier circuits using <b>channel-associated</b> <b>signaling</b> (CAS).|$|R
50|$|Whereas common-channel {{signaling}} {{systems are}} out-of-band by definition, and in-band signaling systems are also necessarily channel-associated, the above metering pulse example demonstrates that there exist <b>channel-associated</b> <b>signaling</b> systems which are out-of-band.|$|R
50|$|By contrast, the L1 {{signaling}} system (which typically employs a 2280 Hz tone of various durations) is an in-band <b>channel-associated</b> <b>signaling</b> system {{as was the}} SF 2600 hertz system formerly used in the Bell System.|$|R
50|$|In-band {{signaling}} {{applies only}} to <b>channel-associated</b> <b>signaling</b> (CAS). In common channel signaling (CCS) separate channels are used for control and data, {{as opposed to the}} shared channel in CAS, so all control is out-of-band by definition.|$|R
50|$|When {{signaling}} {{is performed}} on the same circuit as the conversation of the call, it is termed <b>channel-associated</b> <b>signaling</b> (CAS). This {{is the case for}} earlier analogue trunks, multi-frequency (MF) and R2 digital trunks, and DSS1/DASS PBX trunks.|$|R
50|$|E and M {{signaling}} (E&M) is an out-of-band <b>channel-associated</b> <b>signaling</b> system. The base {{system is}} intended for line signaling, but if decadic pulses are used it can also convey register information. E&M line signaling is however usually paired with DTMF register signaling.|$|R
50|$|DTMF is an in-band, <b>channel-associated</b> {{register}} <b>signaling</b> system. It is not compelled.|$|R
50|$|For <b>channel-associated</b> <b>{{signaling}}</b> (CAS) in Digital Signal 1 (T1) trunks {{that use}} E and M signaling (earth & magneto, or ear & mouth signaling), {{there are only}} two voice channel states. A channel is idle/on hook when there is no call on it or seized/off-hook/energized by an active call. There is no separate state for answered. It mimics an analog loopstart or groundstart line.|$|R
50|$|<b>Channel-associated</b> <b>{{signaling}}</b> (CAS), {{also known}} as per-trunk signaling (PTS), {{is a form of}} digital communication signaling. As with most telecommunication signaling methods, it uses routing information to direct the payload of voice or data to its destination. With CAS signaling, this routing information is encoded and transmitted in the same channel as the payload itself. This information can be transmitted in the same band (in-band signaling) or a separate band (out-of-band signaling) to the payload.|$|R
5000|$|... #Subtitle level 2: <b>Channel-associated</b> versus common-channel <b>signaling</b> ...|$|R
50|$|One {{timeslot}} (TS16) {{is often}} reserved for signalling purposes, to control call setup and teardown {{according to one}} of several standard telecommunications protocols. This includes <b>channel-associated</b> <b>signaling</b> (CAS) where a set of bits is used to replicate opening and closing the circuit (as if picking up the telephone receiver and pulsing digits on a rotary phone), or using tone signalling which is passed through on the voice circuits themselves. More recent systems use common-channel signaling (CCS) such Signalling System 7 (SS7) where no timeslot is reserved for signalling purposes, the signalling protocol being transmitted on a different physical channel.|$|R
