40|$|The study aims {{to analyze}} the sectoral {{marginal}} abatements cost curves {{for a number of}} EU countries as well as to examine the efficiency aspects and the economic impacts for the major sectors of the ETS under different <b>carbon</b> <b>market</b> configurations in 2010 and 2020. To produce a consistent and realistic assessment, we employ sources such as GHG National Inventories, NAPs and POLES world energy model to constitute the sectoral base year and 2010, 2020 emission levels in different countries and regions. We then use the market analysis tool ASPEN, which enables to derive supply and demand from sectoral MACCs produced with the POLES model, and to evaluate the economic impacts on the <b>carbon</b> <b>market</b> participants. The paper shows that, in compliance with the Kyoto targets, the benefits of an enlarged <b>carbon</b> <b>market</b> are significant, since more than 50 % of the abatement in the short term have to be achieved in ETS sectors, which may indeed use CDM or JI credits. A second major conclusion is that in 2020 the new flexibility margins provided by the adjustment of investments in new capacities compensate for the increase in pressure towards stronger emission reductions.

The possible problem of carbon leakage and instruments to tackle it therefore remains an important issue in the European climate policy debate. The reduction of competitive distortions and carbon leakage induced by different CO 2 prices in the EU and important trading partners is one of several reasons for the EU to aim for the establishment of a trading link between the European Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS) and other domestic or regional emissions trading systems in developed and developing countries.

40|$|<b>Carbon</b> <b>emission</b> <b>markets,</b> {{which are}} {{designed}} to reduce emissions of global greenhouse gases (GHGs), have experienced rapid ongoing development even during the recent recession and have attracted considerable attention from policy makers and investors. Therefore, {{it is important to}} understand the time series dynamics of carbon asset prices and the behaviour of trading activities in <b>carbon</b> <b>emission</b> <b>markets.</b> This thesis, using the second commitment period data of the European Union emission trading scheme (EU ETS), examines the underlying dynamics driving <b>carbon</b> <b>emission</b> <b>markets,</b> including the performance of state dependent hedge ratios, the impact of arbitrage opportunities on feedback trading activities, as well as the influence of carbon allowance submission deadlines on the relationship between carbon spot and futures markets. The research models the relationship between carbon spot and futures markets by incorporating state dependent characteristics into the return and volatility processes, and finds that the class of regime switching hedging strategies, particularly the proposed new framework which combines regime switching behaviour and disequilibrium adjustment in the mean with state dependent dynamic volatility process, significantly outperform competing methods for all the measures considered, and for both in-sample and out-of-sample analysis. The results indicate that risk managers using Markov regime switching models to hedge the risk in <b>carbon</b> <b>markets</b> achieve greater variance reduction and better hedging performance. Secondly, this study extends Sentana and Wadhwani’s (1992) feedback trading model by allowing arbitrage opportunities to affect the demand of feedback traders in <b>carbon</b> <b>markets.</b> The results suggest that there is no evidence of feedback trading in the <b>carbon</b> <b>market,</b> where institutional investors dominate, although the effect persists in a few other energy markets. This finding supports the view that institutional investors are not necessarily all feedback traders. Thirdly, when examining the influence of the carbon allowance submission deadline on the time series dynamics of carbon spot and futures markets, it is found that the equilibrium level, mean-reverting speed and no-arbitrage boundaries are affected by the submission deadline. However, the submission of allowances does not change the price discovery process of <b>carbon</b> <b>emission</b> <b>markets,</b> where this thesis finds that both the spot and futures markets Granger-cause each other. Furthermore, there is evidence that the volatility spillover process is different before and after the submission deadline, particularly from the spot market to the futures market. Therefore, in modelling the relationship between carbon spot and futures prices, the difference in the mean-reverting process of futures mispricing before and after the submission deadline should be accounted for. Overall, the thesis finds that the <b>carbon</b> <b>emission</b> <b>markets</b> yield different time series characteristics and trading behaviours from other financial markets. The findings of this thesis are of interest to risk managers, investors and arbitragers operating in the <b>carbon</b> <b>emission</b> <b>market</b> and could aid regulators in improving the mechanisms of the EU ETS in the next commitment period. ...|$|R

These markets are social institutions, designed to solve the transnational collective action problem of climate change. This article explores the development of <b>carbon</b> <b>markets</b> from an institutional perspective to understand how market networks specifically and social institutions in general are constructed. Drawing on seminal work by Richard Scott and Neil Fligstein, this article explores the way in which organizations build the institution of the <b>carbon</b> <b>markets.</b> As this article aims to demonstrate, a number of public and private organizations, rather than regulatory bodies, build and operationalize the market. The article analyzes how organizations develop the three pillars of the <b>carbon</b> <b>market</b> institution: regulative, normative and cultural-cognitive constructs. Since organizations build the institutional pillars of the <b>carbon</b> <b>market</b> network, the strength of the institution cannot be determined by regulation alone. Certainly regulation gives the <b>carbon</b> <b>markets</b> credibility, but their ability to become an institution of common practice relies on the strength and embeddedness of the organizations that build them.

Then we identify the initial composition of the network and the available technology in the upgrade phase as the factors that have the most influence on the ability of a network to meet the energy caps. Finally, we show the intrinsic unfairness of the energy caps, which are imposed to all the networks without taking into account the differences among them. In conclusion, we highlight the fundamental role of <b>carbon</b> <b>markets</b> and <b>emission</b> trading systems to guarantee a measure of fairness between the operators...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Forest {{management}} for carbon sequestration is a low-cost, low-tech-nology, relatively {{easy way to}} help mitigate global climate change that can be adopted now while additional long-term solutions are developed. Carbon-oriented management of forests also offers forest owners an opportunity to obtain {{a new source of}} income, and commonly has environmental co-benefits. The USA is developing climate change policy that recognizes forestry as a source of offsets in <b>carbon</b> <b>markets,</b> and the <b>emissions</b> trading programs and standards that have developed to date offer opportunities for afforestation, reforestation, reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, and improved forest man-agement projects. Private forest owners are key players in <b>carbon</b> <b>markets</b> because they own over half of the forest land in the USA and carbon offsetting from public forest land is rare. However, a number of environmental, economic, and social constraints currently limit <b>carbon</b> <b>market</b> participation by forest owners.
