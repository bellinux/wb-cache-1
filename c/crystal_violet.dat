25|$|MacConkey agar is a {{selective}} and differential medium used {{to differentiate between}} Gram-negative bacteria while inhibiting the growth of Gram-positive bacteria. The addition of bile salts and <b>crystal</b> <b>violet</b> to the agar inhibits the growth of most Gram-positive bacteria, making MacConkey agar selective. Lactose and neutral red are added to differentiate the lactose fermenters, which form pink colonies, from lactose nonfermenters that form clear colonies. An alternative medium, eosin methylene blue serves a similar purpose.|$|E

2500|$|When a {{macrophage}} in the spleen identifies a RBC with a Heinz body, it {{removes the}} precipitate {{and a small}} piece of the membrane, leading to characteristic [...] "bite cells". However, if a large number of Heinz bodies are produced, {{as in the case of}} G6PD deficiency, some Heinz bodies will nonetheless be visible when viewing RBCs that have been stained with <b>crystal</b> <b>violet.</b> This easy and inexpensive test can lead to an initial presumption of G6PD deficiency, which can be confirmed with the other tests.|$|E
50|$|Iron(III) nitrate, or ferric nitrate, is the {{chemical}} compound with the formula Fe(NO3)3. Since it is deliquescent, {{it is commonly}} found in its nonahydrate form Fe(NO3)3·9H2O in which it forms colourless to pale <b>violet</b> <b>crystals.</b>|$|R
50|$|Niobium(IV) chloride, {{also known}} as niobium tetrachloride, is the {{chemical}} compound of formula NbCl4. This compound exists as dark <b>violet</b> <b>crystals,</b> is highly sensitive to air and moisture, and disproportiates into niobium(III) chloride and niobium(V) chloride when heated.|$|R
50|$|Plutonium(III) {{fluoride}} or plutonium trifluoride is {{the chemical}} compound composed of plutonium and fluorine with the formula PuF3.

2500|$|Gram-positive cell {{walls are}} thick and the {{peptidoglycan}} ( [...] {{also known as}} murein) layer constitutes almost 95% of the cell wall in some gram-positive bacteria and as little as 5-10% of the cell wall in gram-negative bacteria. The gram-positive bacteria take up the <b>crystal</b> <b>violet</b> dye and are stained purple. The cell wall of some gram-positive bacteria can be completely dissolved by lysozymes which attacks the bonds between GA and MA. In other gram-positive bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus, the walls are resistant to the action of lysozymes. They have O-acetyl groups on carbon-6 of some MA residues.|$|E

25|$|Monoclinic phosphorus, or violet phosphorus, is {{also known}} as Hittorf's {{metallic}} phosphorus. In 1865, Johann Wilhelm Hittorf heated red phosphorus in a sealed tube at 530°C. The upper part of the tube was kept at 444°C. Brilliant opaque monoclinic, or rhombohedral, <b>crystals</b> sublime. <b>Violet</b> phosphorus can also be prepared by dissolving white phosphorus in molten lead in a sealed tube at 500°C for 18 hours. Upon slow cooling, Hittorf's allotrope crystallises out. The crystals can be revealed by dissolving the lead in dilute nitric acid followed by boiling in concentrated hydrochloric acid. In addition, a fibrous form exists with similar phosphorus cages.|$|R

50|$|After {{billions of}} years, the Zamarons, Guardians, and Controllers evolved (since {{they did not}} reproduce, it was the {{individuals}} themselves who evolved) into different forms. While the Maltusians were originally human-like but blue-skinned, the Zamarons eventually became something else entirely. In their first appearance, they appeared identical to Caucasian Earth women. The Zamarons developed a warrior-like culture, and, unlike the Guardians, preferred to focus on developing their physical abilities over their mental ones. They stored their psionic energies in <b>violet</b> <b>crystals.</b> They also chose a female that resembled their leader {{and gave her a}} <b>violet</b> <b>crystal,</b> turning her into Star Sapphire, with a namesake gem that grants her enormous mental powers, but also takes over her mind (the gem has its own sentient intelligence that controls its user). One of the women chosen was Carol Ferris, lover of the human Green Lantern Hal Jordan. She ended up becoming one of his greatest foes. When she was first transformed the Zamarons commanded her to attack him, as she felt attracted to him and they wanted to prove that men were inferior. He beat her and they removed her memory of the incident, though the persona would resurface many times.|$|R

40|$|UV laser-induced ordered surface {{nanostructures}} in congruent {{lithium niobate}} single <b>crystals.</b> Ultra <b>violet</b> illumination of the -z face of lithium niobate single crystals, under specific conditions, {{results in an}} organized arrangement of submicron etch-resistant features that reflect the illuminating intensity distribution. Consequently, spatially resolved illumination can produce periodic structures with submicron periodicity. Furthermore, a size self-adjustment of the submicron etch resistant features was observed which is related to characteristic lengths (e. g. grating period) of the overall structure. The effect occurs for a narrow range of illuminating intensities and is attributed to a photo-induced electrostatic charge distribution which modifies the electrochemical interaction of the acid with the surface. The size and periodicity of the structures which can be achieved with this method are suitable for the fabrication of 2 D photonic crystal structures in this electro-optically tunable material...|$|R

50|$|Chromium(III) {{phosphate}} is an {{inorganic compound}} with the chemical formula CrPO4.

He sat erect and inscrutable, remote-seeming Bertie watched the static figure of the blind man, the delicate tactile discernment of the large, ruddy hands, and the curious mindless silence of the brow, above the scar.
