50|$|The {{committee}} first resumed {{consideration for}} the canvassing the COCs for Antique, Kuwait, and Iloilo City. The Antique COC was admitted for canvassing after {{the chairman of the}} provincial board of canvassers appeared before the joint committee to explain the discrepancies.

The COC for Iloilo City were canvassed after the chairperson of its city board of canvassers located the COC inside the ballot box that were sent to Congress.

In such cases, you would want to use clone (...) instead of new.|$|R
