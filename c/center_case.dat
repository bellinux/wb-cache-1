The Supreme Court has offered three potential answers to this definitional quandary. This Note uses the Crisis Pregnancy <b>Center</b> <b>cases</b> to demonstrate that courts should use one of these solutions, the factor-based approach of Bolger v. Youngs Drugs Products Corp., to define commercial speech in the Crisis Pregnancy <b>Center</b> <b>cases</b> and elsewhere. In principle and in application, the Bolger factor-based approach succeeds in structuring commercial speech analysis at the margins of the doctrine...|$|R

Guitar Center, the largest retail seller of musical instruments in the United States, accounted for {{about a third of}} all U.S. retail sales of guitars and guitar amplifiers. It was alleged that Guitar Center, a trade association of music retailers, and the five major manufacturers of guitars and guitar amplifiers conspired to set minimum prices at which any retailer could advertise the manufacturers' guitars and guitar amplifiers, in violation of the antitrust laws. The district court dismissed the federal antitrust claim on the pleadings.|$|E

50|$|The lumi {{project was}} started {{in the summer of}} 2006 at the Bioinformatics Core Facility of the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center, Northwestern University. Originally lumi was {{designed}} for the analysis of Illumina Expression BeadArray data. Starting from 2010 (version > 2.0), functions of analyzing Illumina methylation microarray data was added. The project team consists of Drs. Pan Du, Simon M. Lin, and Warren A. Kibbe. The project was started upon a request for collaboration from Dr. Serdar E. Bulun to analyze a set of new Illumina microarray data acquired at his lab on the study of the effect of retinoic acids on cancers. Dr. Pan Du led the software development of the project. lumi was the first software package to utilize the unique design of redundancy of beadArrays for the data transformation and normalization processes. The first release of lumi was on January 3, 2007 through the Bioconductor website. Before its formal release, it was beta-tested at Norwegian Radiumhospital, Leiden University Medical Center, Universiteit van Amsterdam, Università degli Studi di Brescia, UC Davis, Wayne State University, NIH, M.D. Anderson Cancer <b>Center,</b> <b>Case</b> Western Reserve University, Harvard University, Washington University, and Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research.|$|E
