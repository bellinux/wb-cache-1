5|$|Shortly after Mercer {{had arrived}} in the trenches, a massive German {{artillery}} bombardment began, heavy calibre shells destroying trenches and <b>caving</b> <b>in</b> dugouts, killing many Canadian soldiers. Mercer was trapped in a dugout and then stunned by a huge shell burst which wounded most of his staff and the officers of the battalion he was inspecting. The more badly wounded among the officers were transported to an underground field hospital but Mercer was left behind with wounded aide Captain Lynam Gooderham, and so was not present when the hospital was buried by the explosion of four mines which preceded a large-scale German attack. In the confused situation, Mercer and Gooderham attempted to escape the advancing enemy but inadvertently ran into crossfire, where Mercer's leg was broken by a bullet.|$|E

5|$|In plant cells, vacuoles cover {{anywhere}} from 30% to 90% {{of the total}} cell volume. Most mature plant cells contain one large central vacuole encompassed by a membrane called the tonoplast. Vacuoles of plant cells act as storage compartments for the nutrients and waste of a cell. The solution that these molecules are stored in is called the cell sap. Pigments that color the cell are sometime located in the cell sap. Vacuoles can also {{increase the size of}} the cell, which elongates as water is added, and they control the turgor pressure (the osmotic pressure that keeps the cell wall from <b>caving</b> <b>in).</b> Like lysosomes of animal cells, vacuoles have an acidic pH and contain hydrolytic enzymes. The pH of vacuoles enables them to perform homeostatic procedures in the cell. For example, when the pH in the cells environment drops, the H+ ions surging into the cytosol can be transferred to a vacuole {{in order to keep the}} cytosol's pH constant.|$|E

One witness remembered,Proprietors of stores hastened to the falls, taking their clerks with them; bakers deserted their ovens, lumbermen were ordered from the mills, barbers left their customers unshorn; mechanics dropped their tools; lawyers shut up their books or stopped pleading in the courts; physicians abandoned their offices.

25|$|During {{construction}} of the tunnel, on October 5, 1869, the river broke through the thin layer of limestone separating the river's bed from the tunnel. The rushing river scoured the tunnel, <b>caving</b> <b>in</b> parts of Hennepin Island and causing the earth supporting St. Anthony Falls to collapse upstream. There was serious concern that the riverbed would crumble and reduce St. Anthony Falls to a long set of rapids. Within a few weeks, dams were built to divert the river and stop St. Anthony Falls from being washed away. The fix was temporary as the 1870 spring floods damaged {{some of the new}} dams and swept away more of Hennepin Island. By late 1870, the riverbed and banks were stabilized and a wooden apron capped St. Anthony Falls to stop the upstream progression of the collapsing falls. As {{a direct result of the}} collapse of the Hennepin Island tunnel, St. Anthony Falls ultimately received a sloping concrete apron to create an artificial falls that are held out as the only major waterfall on the Mississippi River.|$|E

[...] Entertainment Weekly considered Brown's Brother Justin [...] "delightfully unsettling as the creepy evangelist taking his orders from the wrong superpower", and Variety thought Brown was doing [...] "a superb job straddling the line between stoic and menacing, and there are hints about his weaknesses, conveyed quickly with subtlety." [...] A season 1 DVD review by DVD Talk saw Clancy Brown's performance as [...] "nothing short of brilliant. [...] Brown also has a difficult task capturing the duality of Brother Justin, a man who presents a physically intimidating presence but who wants little more than to be a subdued and loyal servant of his Lord, and he succeeds on every level." [...] DVDverdict stated in a season 2 review that [...] "Brown's presence and charisma is dazzling; he is both likable and frightening.
