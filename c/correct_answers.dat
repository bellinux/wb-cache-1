5|$|The {{third round}} {{consists}} of two questions. In season 1, the first required the team to rank three answers in a stated order and started with a value of $15,000. The second had an opening value of $25,000 and {{any or all of}} the answers could have been correct; the contestants had select all <b>correct</b> <b>answers,</b> and only the <b>correct</b> <b>answers</b> in order to get credit. Starting in season 2, the $15,000 question has two or all three answers being correct, and the team must select all of the <b>correct</b> <b>answers,</b> and only the correct answers; the $25,000 question requires the team to rank the three answers in the correct order.|$|E
5|$|Round two {{consisted}} of five questions posed to the players. The host read a question, {{and one of}} the contestants buzzed-in and provided a response. Their response, along with two other choices, were provided to the other two contestants, who selected one of the choices. <b>Correct</b> <b>answers</b> earned three spins for a buzz-in answer and one spin for a multiple choice answer. After five questions, all three contestants advanced to the final round.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} round, there are again three {{question}}s. Each question {{starts with a}} value of $10,000 and has two correct answers; the team must select both <b>correct</b> <b>answers</b> {{in order to get}} credit. After the second round, the contestants secretly vote on which of them will be eliminated from further play. In order to eliminate a contestant, the other three must agree unanimously. If there is no unanimous agreement, then the contestants are given a 15-second grace period (10 seconds in season one only) before their bank begins to drain. Once there is a unanimous agreement, the chosen contestant is eliminated from the show with no winnings.|$|E
50|$|After no <b>correct</b> <b>answer</b> {{was given}} by viewers, the <b>correct</b> <b>answer</b> was {{revealed}} to be 292.|$|R
3000|$|Too {{similar to}} the <b>correct</b> <b>answer</b> or the target word. Comments {{explicitly}} state that a distractor is too {{similar to the}} <b>correct</b> <b>answer,</b> e.g. “the distractor ‘overcome’ {{is too close to}} the <b>correct</b> <b>answer</b> or ‘refined’ is too similar to the correct answer” [...]...|$|R
30|$|This {{histogram}} represents learners’ response latency {{in accordance}} with their duration of correct responses and their ZPD level. The blue bars manifest learners’ response latency of <b>correct</b> <b>answer</b> in association with the offered mediations, while orange bars depict learners’ ZPD level. Learners with larger ZPD demonstrate to reach the <b>correct</b> <b>answer</b> with shorter response latency. For example, the learners who correctly answered the question with the first attempt (with no mediation) elicited shorter processing information than those who required mediations in arriving at the <b>correct</b> <b>answer.</b> On the other hand, learners who were not able to tackle the <b>correct</b> <b>answer,</b> despite the presentation of all mediations, demonstrated the longest response latency which was the result of longer information processing. As it is apparent in Fig.  2, the hierarchal presentation of mediation via C-DA caused fluctuation in learners’ response latency. Learners who tackled the <b>correct</b> <b>answer</b> through the first mediation, the most implicit one, indicated shorter latency in response for <b>correct</b> <b>answer</b> than those who reached the <b>correct</b> <b>answer</b> with the second and third mediations. With the gradual increase of mediations’ explicitness for failed learners, the learners’ response latency for <b>correct</b> <b>answer</b> gradually increased. Successful learners with the use of fifth mediation, the most explicit one, had the longest response latency of the <b>correct</b> <b>answer</b> while failures (out of ZPD) at the last attempt had the longest latency in responses.|$|R
5|$|Late in its run, the Fox show Greed {{brought back}} some of its {{previous}} winners to try for an extra $1,000,000. Curtis Warren, {{who was part of}} the first team to win $1,000,000 on the show (of which his share was $400,000, plus $10,000 for winning a terminator round), was one of the contestants brought back to do so on February 11, 2000. Warren was given a question about TV shows that had been made into movies, with eight choices (of which he had to identify the four <b>correct</b> <b>answers).</b> He successfully did so, giving himself $1,410,000 and the record for the time being.|$|E
5|$|Mind of a Man is a {{game show}} {{broadcast}} by Game Show Network, with DeRay Davis as host. On each episode, two female contestants attempt {{to figure out what}} men believe about marriage, dating, work, and other subjects. Similar to Family Feud, the questions have previously been answered by a survey of one hundred men. Over the course of four rounds, a celebrity panel consisting of two men and a woman helps the contestants by offering their opinions about the <b>correct</b> <b>answers</b> to the surveys. The winner advances to the bonus round, which features a top prize of $10,000.|$|E
5|$|The X-Mansion {{serves as}} a hub that the team returns to after each mission. While at the mansion, one player {{controls}} Alison Crestmere as she explores, and learns about herself and the other X-Men. Here players can also view loading screen art, cinematics, and comic book covers acquired during gameplay. Biographies of the X-Men and their enemies can be accessed on computers located in the mansion. Players can participate in an X-Men trivia game, which rewards experience points for <b>correct</b> <b>answers.</b> Additionally, players can access the Danger Room's computer to play challenge missions unlocked during gameplay.|$|E
30|$|It was not {{possible}} to compute γ correlations for the condition in which participants originally generated the <b>correct</b> <b>answer</b> and then were provided with the <b>correct</b> <b>answer,</b> because —not surprisingly—participants nearly always got these <b>answers</b> <b>correct.</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{second factor}} is the {{semantic}} similarity between the <b>correct</b> <b>answer</b> and distractors. Distractors in a multiple-choice question act as a lure to distract the test takers from finding the <b>correct</b> <b>answer.</b> The vocabulary question {{used in the present}} study asks for the word with closest meaning to that of the target word; thus, a distracting distractor would be one with a close but different meaning from the <b>correct</b> <b>answer.</b> Hence, the similarity between the <b>correct</b> <b>answer</b> and distractors is considered to be a factor affecting item difficulty.|$|R
50|$|This was {{repeated}} for three mouths and noses, with the partners alternating. The second <b>correct</b> <b>answer</b> added another $50, {{and the third}} <b>correct</b> <b>answer</b> earned another $250 {{for a total of}} $500.|$|R
5|$|X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse {{features}} a central hub that players return to between missions. It is a designated area free from enemies, and its setting changes {{to coincide with}} the current act of the game. Here players can view loading screen art, cinematics, and comic book covers acquired during gameplay. Biographies of the X-Men and their enemies can be accessed here. Players can also participate in an X-Men trivia game which awards experience points for <b>correct</b> <b>answers.</b> Additionally, players can access a virtual combat environment known as the Danger Room to play additional missions unlocked during gameplay.|$|E
5|$|In {{the months}} {{following}} the broadcast of Part One, there was widespread debate among fans of the series as to who shot Mr. Burns. Fox offered a contest to tie in with the mystery where callers who dialed 1-800-COLLECT were eligible and they then guessed who the culprit was. It ran from August 13 to September 10 {{and was one of}} the first contests to tie together elements of television and the Internet. Fox launched a new website, www.Springfield.com, devoted to the mystery which got over 500,000 hits during the summer of 1995. The winner would be animated on an episode of the show. Due to contest regulations, a winner had to be selected out of a random sample of entries. The sample did not contain any <b>correct</b> <b>answers,</b> and so a winner (who had the wrong answer) was chosen at random. However, the winner, Fayla Gibson of Washington D.C., did not watch the show and opted to accept a cash prize in lieu of being animated.|$|E
25|$|The theory test is a multiple-choice test {{consisting}} of randomised questions from a published guidebook. Thus {{the questions and}} <b>correct</b> <b>answers</b> can be studied in advance.|$|E
50|$|All {{four players}} now competed on a toss-up basis with {{the player who}} gave the last <b>correct</b> <b>answer</b> {{selecting}} the half-questions. If a player buzzes in with a <b>correct</b> <b>answer,</b> that player would then {{have a chance at}} a “Double Play” by selecting another half-question to answer on their own. Each <b>correct</b> <b>answer</b> was worth $50 in Round Two and $100 in Round Three.|$|R
50|$|Each <b>correct</b> <b>answer</b> {{is worth}} 10 points. If a student buzzes early with a <b>correct</b> <b>answer,</b> the host will {{acknowledge}} the answer and then summarize {{the reading of}} the question for the viewing audience.|$|R
50|$|The {{contestant}} {{in control}} chose one answer at a time; each <b>correct</b> <b>answer</b> awarded money, while finding a Wipeout reset the score to zero and ended his/her turn. After each <b>correct</b> <b>answer,</b> he/she could either choose again or pass {{control to the}} next contestant. The first <b>correct</b> <b>answer</b> of the round was worth $25, {{and the value of}} each subsequent answer increased by $25, with the last one worth $275.|$|R
25|$|A person (the subject) {{is tested}} for clairvoyance. He is shown {{the reverse of}} a {{randomly}} chosen playing card 25 times and asked which of the four suits it belongs to. The number of hits, or <b>correct</b> <b>answers,</b> is called X.|$|E
25|$|Final Round: A timed round {{for each}} team in turn with play cycling between the team members. When the {{questions}} begin the team's score begins to count {{down and the}} goal is to give five <b>correct</b> <b>answers</b> before their score reaches zero. The team with the most points left is the ultimate victor.|$|E
25|$|All {{students}} receive an analysis sheet {{along with their}} certificate, which records their answers for each question, along with the <b>correct</b> <b>answers.</b> The questions are divided into four categories: arithmetic, algebra, geometry and problem solving, {{and the number of}} questions that the student answered correctly for each category is listed along with the regional mean.|$|E
30|$|Generating a single-word <b>correct</b> <b>answer</b> can be {{achieved}} by simply choosing a synonym of the target word (sense) in WordNet. A multiple-word <b>correct</b> <b>answer</b> is generated by simplifying a gloss of the target word in WordNet 2.|$|R
30|$|Integration of {{question}} with {{assistance in the}} C-DA crystallized the individual differences at the levels of ZAD, ZPD, and response latency. The conspicuous question in assessing learners’ ZAD based on conventional non-dynamic assessment is whether learners correctly answered the question. Without receiving any mediation, six learners demonstrated {{that they had the}} task in their ZAD by reaching the <b>correct</b> <b>answer.</b> The differentiation of these learners in comprehending the passage was perceptible through each learner’s response latency during coming up with the <b>correct</b> <b>answer.</b> Shorter response latency was the result of quicker information processing in learners with stronger ZAD. Learners’ nuances of developed reading comprehension potentiality manifested itself in required processing information for answering the question which was concretely represented itself in the latency of responses. Therefore, the difference in ZAD brought individualistic response latency for each learner. On the other hand, learners’ proximity to the ZAD was measured both by offering ex/implicit mediations and recording their spent time in reaching the <b>correct</b> <b>answer.</b> Although separate consideration of offered mediation could elucidate learners’ ZPD, the difference among those who reached the <b>correct</b> <b>answer</b> with the same mediation remained mysterious. Learners’ response latency demonstrated to be distinctive both for the group of learner and individuals. Those who reached the <b>correct</b> <b>answer</b> through an implicit mediation reflected shorter response latency than those who arrived at the <b>correct</b> <b>answer</b> with the help of explicit mediation. The response latency even differentiates learners who believed to have equal potentiality due to reaching the <b>correct</b> <b>answer</b> with a particular mediation. Each individual manifests particular response latency in arriving at the <b>correct</b> <b>answer.</b> Even each unsuccessful learner in reaching the <b>correct</b> <b>answer</b> (six learners) shows individualistic response latency.|$|R
30|$|Synonym pair. No high-proficiency test takers {{selected}} the distractors {{in this category}} in four out of ten questions. This is most likely because {{they found out that}} a synonym pair in the options could not be a <b>correct</b> <b>answer</b> because a question has only a single <b>correct</b> <b>answer.</b> The distractors in this category should be verified by a human expert before they are used in a real test. One example is the distractors “life-sized” and “lifelike” for a question with the target word “miniature” and the <b>correct</b> <b>answer</b> “small”. No test taker out of 23 chose neither “life-sized” nor “lifelike”. The test takers probably figured out that they were synonym pair, so both could not be the <b>correct</b> <b>answer.</b> This gives evidence that there should not be a synonym pair in the options because the test taker can easily rule them out as a <b>correct</b> <b>answer.</b>|$|R
25|$|Three {{teams of}} two contestants (namely Red, Yellow and Purple) were spotted $500 ($300 {{in the first}} few episodes) to begin the game with. <b>Correct</b> <b>answers</b> were worth $50, and {{incorrect}} answers were penalized by that amount. After two rounds, the team in third place was eliminated, {{and at the end of}} the last round, only one team prevailed.|$|E
25|$|Multi Poll Choice – Charissa {{is given}} four questions, each with four {{possible}} percentages as <b>correct</b> <b>answers,</b> and must predict how the Nation responded. For this segment, Colin wears a red coat {{similar to that}} of Ron Burgundy, while also mimicking his mannerisms which include drinking scotch and making horrible jokes (which the crew still laughs at).|$|E
25|$|From 1974 until 1999, {{the exam}} had 30 {{questions}} and was 90 minutes long, scoring 5 points for <b>correct</b> <b>answers.</b> Originally {{during this time}} period, 1 point was awarded for leaving an answer blank, however it was changed in the late 1980s to 2 points for omitted questions. When the exam was shortened {{as part of the}} 2000 rebranding, the value of a correct answer was increased to 6 points (keeping 150 as a perfect score). In 2001, the score of a blank was increased to 2.5 to penalize guessing. The 2007 exams were the first with only 1.5 points awarded for a blank, to discourage students from leaving a large number of questions blank in order to assure qualification for the AIME. For example, on the AMC 12, a student could advance with only 11 <b>correct</b> <b>answers,</b> presuming the remaining questions were left blank. Now, a student must answer at least 14 questions correctly to reach 100 points.|$|E
50|$|The <b>correct</b> <b>answer</b> is...|$|R
50|$|Throughout the game, {{a team of}} 6 experts {{attempts}} to answer questions sent in by viewers. For each question, the time limit is 1 minute. The questions require a combination of skills such as logical thinking, intuition, insight, etc. to find the <b>correct</b> <b>answer.</b> The person who sent in the question earns a prize if the experts cannot get the <b>correct</b> <b>answer,</b> while the team of experts earns points if they manage to get the <b>correct</b> <b>answer.</b>|$|R
50|$|Some quizzes {{include a}} bonus question, {{in which a}} single answer is {{required}} {{with one or more}} clues given each round making the answer progressively easier to solve. In some variants, the first team to hand in the <b>correct</b> <b>answer</b> wins either a spot prize or additional points to their total score. In others, the questions continue until all teams have the <b>correct</b> <b>answer</b> with each team been given progressively fewer additional points the longer it takes them to submit the <b>correct</b> <b>answer.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{format for}} the bonus round was {{modified}} in 2006. First-night champions would automatically {{be given a}} $50,000 cash jackpot, {{which could not be}} won until at least their seventh night. The Ten in a Row segment was changed so that ten <b>correct</b> <b>answers</b> would add another $50,000 to the jackpot. There was no need to correctly answer the questions consecutively, but at least ten answers had to be answered correctly before time ran out.|$|E
25|$|The theory test {{consists}} of 26 computerized questions, with successful candidates needing {{to score a}} minimum of 22 <b>correct</b> <b>answers.</b> The candidate is automatically eliminated if 5 wrong answers are given. For authenticity, during the computerized examination, the candidate is photographed three times and these pictures are later used {{as evidence that the}} person present at the road test is the same person as the one who was present at the theory test.|$|E
25|$|There are careers {{that come}} with the game that require skills and a certain number of friends in order for promotion. Success in these careers unlocks career rewards and higher {{salaries}} plus bonuses. Sims also receive chance cards. <b>Correct</b> <b>answers</b> to these chance cards creates rewards for Sims while incorrect answers could cause a Sim to lose its job. Nightlife and Apartment Life allow Sims to gain promotions through social interactions with other Sims.|$|E
50|$|Before January 2007, a game {{took place}} during the ad-breaks, where they gave the viewers a {{multiple}} choice question with two silly <b>answers</b> and the <b>correct</b> <b>answer.</b> Viewers then had to call in during the ad-breaks and, if they gave the <b>correct</b> <b>answer,</b> won $50.|$|R
50|$|Three boards {{were played}} in Round 1, with £10 awarded {{for the first}} answer plus an {{additional}} £10 for each subsequent <b>correct</b> <b>answer</b> (up to £110 for the eleventh). In the Monkhouse version, only two boards were played and each <b>correct</b> <b>answer</b> was worth £50.|$|R
50|$|Words {{of eight}} or more letters are {{partitioned}} into {{four or five}} pieces, rearranged and presented to the contestants, who must unscramble them. Only five points per <b>correct</b> <b>answer</b> are scored in this round. In all other rounds, each <b>correct</b> <b>answer</b> scores ten points.|$|R
