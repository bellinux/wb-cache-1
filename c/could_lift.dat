Lindwall took the new ball and felt pain in his groin after {{delivering}} the first ball to Hutton. Despite this, Lindwall persevered, and his first over was a maiden. Seeing Lindwall struggle through the pain barrier, Bradman tossed the ball to Miller at the start off the second over {{to see if he}} <b>could</b> <b>lift</b> and bowl as well. However, Miller threw the ball back to his captain, indicating that his body {{would not be able to}} withstand the strain. This resulted in media speculation that Bradman and Miller had quarrelled.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{had lost}} its UK title, Razer still reigned as {{champion}} of the Extreme All-Stars tournament. Its first battle to defend this title was against twice UK champion Chaos 2 and dual-spinner 13 Black. Razer and 13 Black joined forces to eliminate Chaos 2, in what was its last ever fight on Robot Wars. Razer's next battle against Spawn Again was a rematch from the series five semi-finals. Razer was again the aggressor: it repeatedly punctured Spawn Again's body panels, prompting its constructors to seek safety by driving themselves into the pit. Razer's next battle was one-on-one versus 13 Black. Following an impact with the arena wall, 13 Black stopped spinning for long enough that Razer <b>could</b> <b>lift</b> it with the arm and lower it into the pit. In the All-Stars grand final, Razer faced Firestorm4. Razer manoeuvred its wedge underneath Firestorm4, lowered the arm and immobilised its opponent. Razer was All-Stars champion {{for a second time}} running.|$|E
5|$|For {{the climactic}} tanker chase, the {{producers}} used an entire {{section of a}} highway near Mexicali, which had been closed for safety reasons. Sixteen eighteen-wheeler tankers were used, some with modifications made by manufacturer Kenworth {{at the request of}} driving stunts arranger Rémy Julienne. Most were given improvements to their engines to run faster, while one model had an extra steering wheel {{on the back of the}} cabin so a hidden stuntman could drive while Carey Lowell was in the front and another received extra suspension on its back so it <b>could</b> <b>lift</b> its front wheels. Although a rig was constructed to help a rig tilt onto its side, it was not necessary as Julienne was able to pull off the stunt without the aid of camera trickery.|$|E

5|$|Rural {{families}} that sold a large agricultural surplus {{to the market}} not only could afford to buy more charcoal, tea, oil, and wine, but they could also amass enough funds to establish secondary means of production for generating more wealth. Besides necessary agricultural foodstuffs, farming families could often produce wine, charcoal, paper, textiles, and other goods they sold through brokers. Farmers in Suzhou often specialized in raising bombyx mori to produce silk wares, while in Fujian, Sichuan, and Guangdong farmers often grew sugarcane. In order to ensure the prosperity of rural areas, technical applications for public works projects and improved agricultural techniques were essential. The vast irrigation system of China had to be furnished with multitudes of wheelwrights mass-producing standardized waterwheels and square-pallet chain pumps that <b>could</b> <b>lift</b> water from lower planes to higher irrigation planes.|$|E
25|$|Boxley Abbey had {{a famous}} {{portrait}} of the saint. It was small and of a weight so small a child <b>could</b> <b>lift</b> it but at times became so heavy even strong people could not lift it. According to tradition, the attempt to lift the portrait was a test of a woman's chastity. In practice, those who paid the priest well <b>could</b> <b>lift</b> the portrait with ease, while others could not. Upon the Dissolution of the Monasteries in England, {{it was discovered that}} the portrait was held by a wooden pin by an unseen person behind the portrait.|$|E

25|$|This {{expansion}} did {{not occur}} {{at the expense of}} other sites. East Salamanca was chosen in 1906 for a new roundhouse, enginehouse, and classification yard, thanks to a location convenient to the Buffalo, Middle, and Rochester Divisions. The introduction of the huge Class XX 2-8-8-2 Mallets in 1918 necessitated construction of appropriate shop facilities at East Salamanca. This included electric jacks that <b>could</b> <b>lift</b> the Mallet off the ground.|$|E
25|$|Mitchell {{came from}} Birmingham, England and fought Sullivan in 1883, {{knocking}} {{him down in}} the first round. Their third meeting took place in 1888 {{on the grounds of}} a chateau at Chantilly, France, with the fight held in driving rain. It went on for more than two hours, {{at the end of which}} both men were unrecognisable and had suffered much loss of blood; neither <b>could</b> <b>lift</b> his arms to punch and the contest was considered a draw.|$|E

25|$|Xiang Yu had {{a double}} pupil {{in one of}} his eyes just like the mythical Emperor Shun and Duke Wen of Jin. He was thus seen as an {{extraordinary}} person because his unique double pupil was a mark of a king or sage in Chinese tradition. Xiang Yu was slightly taller than eight chi (approximately 1.85 metres, about 6' 1") and possessed unusual physical strength as he <b>could</b> <b>lift</b> a ding (an ancient Chinese vessel resembling a giant cauldron on tripods).|$|E
25|$|Since 2007 {{the airport}} has {{occasionally}} {{been used by}} BBC motoring TV show Top Gear as the location for various stunts and experiments. The best known was a scene similar to one featured in the film Casino Royale and featured both a Ford Mondeo and a Citroën 2CV parked behind the engines of a Virgin Atlantic Boeing 747-400, in an experiment to investigate whether the thrust from the aircraft's four jet engines really <b>could</b> <b>lift</b> a car off the ground.|$|E
25|$|The first {{purpose built}} stern trawler was Fairtry built in 1953 at Aberdeen. The ship was {{much larger than}} any other {{trawlers}} then in operation and inaugurated {{the era of the}} 'super trawler'. As the ship pulled its nets over the stern, it <b>could</b> <b>lift</b> out a much greater haul of up to 60 tons. Lord Nelson followed in 1961, installed with vertical plate freezers that had been researched and built at the Torry Research Station. These ships served as a basis for the expansion of 'super trawlers' around the world in the following decades.|$|E

25|$|In 1981–82 the Leeward Islands {{made their}} {{debut in the}} Shell Shield with a 57-run win over the Windward Islands (the season after the Combined Islands had won the title), but it was to take eight seasons until they <b>could</b> <b>lift</b> the {{first-class}} trophy – which by then had been renamed the Red Stripe Cup. From 1989–90 to 1997–98, however, the Leeward Islands won five first-class titles (one shared) and four one-day titles (one shared), but since then they have failed to win any major trophy in the West Indies.|$|E
25|$|Charwell was {{commissioned}} in April 1803 under Commander Phillip Dumaresq. In early May Charwell {{was in the}} Hamoaze completely rigged and fitted for sea, but was short a crew. Once he had succeeded in forming a crew, Dumaresque sailed her in the Channel. However, by 1 September {{she was back in}} the Hamoaze. She had grounded on some rocks on the French coast. There she had had to throw her guns overboard to lighten her sufficiently that the next incoming tide <b>could</b> <b>lift</b> her. At Plymouth {{she was going to have}} some of her copper plates removed to permit inspection of her hull.|$|E
25|$|McQueen's next change {{occurred}} {{in that same}} year, when Lindley Evans was appointed as music teacher. McQueen believed that the teachers appointed to his school should not only have great ability in their chosen field, but also have imagination {{and be prepared to}} be innovators. McQueen saw this in Evans and felt that he <b>could</b> <b>lift</b> the standard of music at the school. This did indeed happen. For many years, P.L.C won the coveted 'Dempster Shield' for choral singing. The school won it so many times in fact, that the shield became the permanent property of the school.|$|E

25|$|Through {{the use of}} low wing- and span-loading to {{generate}} greater effectiveness than conventional counterparts, the Islander <b>could</b> <b>lift</b> considerably heavier payloads than the typical aircraft in its power, weight or cost classes. To reduce manufacturing costs, both the wings and tail surfaces maintain a constant chord and thickness, while the ribs within the aircraft's wing are all identical; both rivets and external fishplate joints are used for the same purpose. The type was originally intended to use a fabric-and-steel design. A light alloy monocoque approach was adopted instead. The structure is designed to give rise to and experience low levels of stress, and has an infinite fatigue life without testing.|$|E
25|$|In 1931, {{the first}} powered drum {{was created by}} Laurie Jarelainen. The drum was a {{circular}} device that was set {{to the side of}} the boat and would draw in the nets. Since World War II, radio navigation aids and fish finders have been widely used. The first trawlers fished over the side, rather than over the stern. The first purpose built stern trawler was Fairtry built in 1953 at Aberdeen, Scotland. The ship was much larger than any other trawlers then in operation and inaugurated the era of the 'super trawler'. As the ship pulled its nets over the stern, it <b>could</b> <b>lift</b> out a much greater haul of up to 60 tons.

25|$|As {{they joined}} Emma at Merlin's tree, Arthur and his Knights {{are ready to}} stop Regina and Emma from {{releasing}} Merlin, calling them liars. As Regina unleashed her hand of fire to keep Arthur at bay, she tells Emma to use the spell, which unleashes light and dark magic, freeing Merlin. The now-human sorcerer then calls out Emma, and lashed out at Arthur, telling the King that he - and not Merlin's false prophecies - {{are to blame for}} this mess, and added as long as the dagger and Excalibur are separated Merlin is untouchable. Arthur, however says this is far from over. Merlin later lifted Arthur’s spell off of David and Mary Margaret. Hook asks Merlin if he can he free Emma to remove darkness out of her. Merlin revealed he <b>could</b> <b>lift</b> the darkness from Emma, but there was just one thing he needs from Emma, and that is if Emma's heart was ready to release the darkness from hers.|$|E
