50|$|The 70/15 {{was often}} used as a {{satellite}} processor for larger systems or used as an intelligent terminal for remote job entry. Typical applications of a satellite processor would include <b>card-to-tape</b> conversion, card/tape-to-printer report generation, tape-to-card punching, input pre-processing and verification, or tab-shop tasks like file sorting, merge, and data selection.|$|E
50|$|The 711 was {{relatively}} slow and magnetic tape was much faster, {{so it was}} common for 7000 series installations to include an IBM 1401, with its high speed peripherals, to do <b>card-to-tape</b> and tape-to-line-printer operations off-line, with the 711 mainly used for initial program load of operating systems and diagnostics.|$|E
50|$|A typical UNIVAC I {{installation}} {{had several}} ancillary devices. There were, typically: a printer that read a magnetic tape and printed output on continuous-form paper; a <b>card-to-tape</b> converter, that read punched cards and recorded their images on magnetic tape; and a tape-to-card converter, that read a magnetic tape and produced punched cards. There was no UNIVAC provided operating system. Operators loaded on a UNISERVO a program tape {{which could be}} loaded automatically by processor logic. The appropriate source and output data tapes would be mounted and the program started. Results tapes {{then went to the}} offline printer or typically for data processing into short term storage to be updated with the next set of data produced on the offline card to tape unit. The mercury delay line memory tank temperature was very closely controlled as the speed of sound in mercury varies with temperature. In the event of a power failure, many hours could elapse before the temperature stabilized.|$|E
50|$|While the {{architectures}} differ, {{the machines}} {{in the same class}} share electronics technologies and generally use the same peripherals. Tape drives use 7-track format, with the IBM 727 for vacuum tube machines and the 729 for transistor machines. Both the vacuum tube and most transistor models use the same card readers, card punches and line printers that were introduced with the 701. These units, the IBM 711, 721 and 716, are based on IBM accounting machine technology and even include plugboard control panels. They are relatively slow and it was common for 7000 series installations to include an IBM 1401, with its much faster peripherals, to do <b>card-to-tape</b> and tape-to-line-printer operations off-line. Three later machines, the 7010, the 7040 and the 7044, adopted peripherals from the midline IBM 1400 series. Some of the technology for the 7030 was used in data channels and peripheral devices on other 7000 series computers, e.g., 7340 Hypertape.|$|E
