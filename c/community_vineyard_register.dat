The map of the potential production site for vineyards that was developed and maintained by the Viticultural and Enological Research Institute (SZBKI) on analogue maps showing the production site suitability for vineyards. These maps were created by onsite observation, but at that time the available maps and technology did not provide enough accuracy to demonstrate the research and the know-how. Now by the help of the GIS technology available in the VINGIS the update of this maps become easier and more efficient. At the same time new research opportunities become possible (e. g. : protection of vines with designated origin). Proceeding...|$|R

50|$|The {{peculiarity}} of {{the vineyard}} {{is that the}} vines grow in slightly argillaceous sand soil. This sandy soil produces mild wines with low acidity. In 1991, the vineyard was affiliated as a single vineyard site ("großlagenfreie Einzellage") by the wine growing region of Saale-Unstrut and thus recognized by the EU. The Wachtelberg is now a classified German vineyard {{and can be found}} under the registration 11.1.5.-017 in the <b>vineyard</b> <b>register</b> (Weinbergrolle).

Superiore is a specification for wines produced with a stricter rule of production than other Chianti wines. Chianti Superiore has been authorised since 1996. Chianti Superiore wines can be produced only from grapes cultivated in the Chianti wine areas except from those <b>vineyards</b> that are <b>registered</b> in the Chianti Classico sub-zone. <b>Vineyards</b> <b>registered</b> in Chianti sub-zones other than Classico can produce Chianti Superiore wines but must omit the sub-zone name on the label. Aging is calculated from 1 January after the picking. Chianti Superiore cannot be sold to the consumer before nine months of aging, of which three {{must be in the}} bottle.

The area's thin soils, limited water and warm summers harness Shiraz’s natural vigor and produce intense flavored fruit, and wine with a deep purple color that can last decades in the bottle. McLaren Vale wines are distinguished by their ripeness, elegance, structure, power and complexity. McLaren Vale has 3218 hectares of Shiraz under vine. Other major varieties include Cabernet Sauvignon with 1288 ha planted, Chardonnay with 722 ha planted, and Grenache with 402 ha—much of this dry-grown (non-irrigated) bush vines.

The church, like most of the town was destroyed on 19 January 1667 by an avalanche. [...] It was rebuilt in 1670 in a sheltered location. The population lived mostly through agriculture and livestock (sheep), though many temporarily emigrated for work. On the sun-drenched slopes of the mountains, the <b>community's</b> <b>vineyards</b> are found everywhere below 700 m in elevation. Starting in 1850, the population began to drop drastically.

To prevent the stealing of grapes, special Traubenhüter (grape guards) were employed by the community. In 1661 110 <b>vineyards</b> are <b>registered.</b> The year 1889 is still remembered as a top year, grossing an estimated 100,000 Marks. In the 20th century, however, viticulture in the community went into decline due to infestations of Reblaus. Currently there are no vineyards in Rheinbreitbach.|$|R

40|$|The year 2008 is {{a turning}} point for the {{development}} of eGovernment in the Czech Republic; the acceptance of Government act is awaited; this introduces the obligation of electronic data exchange between state administration and business subjects (government to business- G 2 B). The sphere of agriculture does not stand apart. The Department of Agriculture of the Czech Republic is the central authority of the state administration for agriculture, water resources management, food processing industry, forestry, hunting and fishery. In its administration it has a range of departmental registers. For example: Register of farmland, Register of animals, <b>Register</b> of <b>vineyards,</b> <b>Register</b> of hop-gardens, Register of intensive plantations, Register of agricultural subjects etc. The electronic data exchange between these registers and agricultural entrepreneurs; which will be faster, more effective and more economical than the paper forms; is a big call appeal for the development of eGovernment in the department of agriculture. The current valid legistature obliges the agricultural subjects to hand in the whole range of declarations and announcements to the resort registers. In paper form this means a big ration of duplicate notations which an agricultural company has to fill in, and with this corresponding error rate and work difficulty. Agricultural subjects need also to know data from resort registers; above all, while processing the grants applications. The farmers could gain the needed information only in the form of paper extracts from the registers which constitutes a time demanding and expensive agenda. The abstract deals with the problematics of implementation of electronic <b>register</b> of <b>vineyards,</b> {{as one of the first}} projects of the prepared electronic communication.

40|$|The {{wine sector}} in EU {{is one of}} the most {{complicated}} regarding the legislation and preparations for the wine reform have been long and comprehensive. The wide-ranging EU wine reform was implemented in two phases. The first phase implied retrieval of balance on the wine market and casted out market intervention measures allowing enhanced budget use. The second phase included rules regarding protected designations of origin (PDO), protected geographical indications (PGI), wine making practices and the <b>vineyard</b> <b>register.</b> The primary aim of this paper is contribution to the understanding of the EU wine reform and the next aim is to investigate the impact on Croatia. Using descriptive analysis approach, the quality analysis of the legislation in the European and Croatian wine sector has been conducted. The wine reform in the EU was necessary because of: (i) the structural surplus on the European market, (ii) the steady decline in wine consumption in the EU and (iii) slower growth in EU exports since 1996. Croatia is obligated to harmonize the legislation in the wine sector as one of the preconditions of the EU accession. The adoption of the new EU legislation in Croatian legal framework started in 2010. The most of EU regulations have been adopted in 2010. The rest of it has to be adopted in 2011. Croatia has implemented several regulations concerning wine sector into national law framework. Still, the most challenging part of the EU reform, the system of PDO and PGI is waiting to be revised and adjusted to Croatian circumstances. The implementation should support interests of all parties (producers, government, institutions) ...|$|R
