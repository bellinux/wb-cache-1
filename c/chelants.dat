40|$|Recent {{research}} has shown that chelant-assisted phytoextraction approaches often require a high dosage of <b>chelant</b> applied to soil. The present study focused on optimization of phytoremediation processes to increase the phytoextraction efficiency of metals at reduced <b>chelant</b> applications. Pot experiments were carried out to investigate the effects of increased soil temperature on shoot uptake of heavy metals by corn (Zea mays L.) and mung bean (Vigna radiat L. Wilczek) from heavy metal-contaminated soils. After the application of S,S-ethylenediaminedisuccinic acid or ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid, soils were exposed to high temperatures (50 or 80 °C) for 3 h, which significantly increased the concentration of heavy metals in shoots. The heating treatment 2 d after the <b>chelant</b> addition resulted in higher concentrations of metals compared with those treatments 2 d before or simultaneously with the <b>chelant</b> application. Irrigation with 100 °C water 2 d after the <b>chelant</b> addition, or irrigation with 100 °C <b>chelant</b> solutions directly, also resulted in significantly higher phytoextraction of metals in the two crops compared with 25 °C <b>chelant</b> solutions. In addition, a novel application method to increase soil temperature using underground polyvinyl chloride tubes would increase the chelant-assisted extraction efficiency of Cu approximately 10 - to 14 -fold in corn and fivefold in mung bean compared with those nonheating treatments. In a field experiment, increasing soil temperature 2 d after <b>chelant</b> addition also increased the shoot Cu uptake approximately fivefold compared with those nonheating treatments.

To {{study the effects of}} different <b>chelants</b> on the solubility of heavy metals with time, a batch of soil incubation experiment was conducted. EDTA, EDDS, AES and IDSA of 5 mmol·kg- 1 were singly added to the contaminated soil with no <b>chelants</b> addition as control. After 7 days of incubation, the concentrations of water-soluble Pb, Zn, Cu and Cd increased significantly compared to the control. Pb was increased by 158. 6, 3. 9, 42. 2 and 5. 3 times respectively, Cu was increased by 45. 0, 162. 0, 40. 0 and 53. 6 times respectively, Zn was increased by 6. 2, 5. 6, 9. 4 and 1. 5 times respectively, and Cd was increased by 33. 5, 3. 3, 126. 5 and 38. 0 times respectively. The results showed that EDDS was more effective for Cu desorption, EDTA was more effective for Pb desorption, and AES was more effective for Zn and Cd desorption, IDSA was more effective for Cd desorption, which was our interesting findings. With the time increasing, the soluble metals with EDTA treatment was increased or not changed, while the water-soluble metals with EDDS, AES and IDSA treatments were decreased significantly. The underlying reason for the results may be the different chemical characteristics of the <b>chelants.</b> EDTA, a persistent chelant, can’t be degraded in the environment, while EDDS, AES and IDSA are biodegradable <b>chelants</b> which were degraded with time increasing and the metals were absorbed to the bulk soil again, resulting in water-soluble metals reduced...|$|E

Currently, {{diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid}} (DTPA) is used, along with synergist oxalic acid and potassium hydroxide, {{to remove the}} scale by dissolution. However, the chemical factors affecting this reaction are not known fully, leading to mixed results in terms of treatment effectiveness. This thesis investigates the effect of these factors, by analyzing the change in barite dissolution due to intrinsic factors like variations in formulation composition and extrinsic factors like presence of competing ions. The dissolution reaction is carried out, by taking the barite powder and <b>chelant</b> solution in a teflon round bottom flask and measuring the barite dissolved periodically, with an ICP-OES. The effect of different factors is studied by varying each factor individually and plotting the changes in solubilities. These lab tests show that solubility of barite (0. 01 mM in water), ideally, increases with increasing concentrations of chelating agents, even going as high as 239 mM. However experimental or field constraints lead to significant decrease in dissolution, especially at higher <b>chelant</b> concentrations. Thus, field tests to determine most effective <b>chelant</b> concentrations must precede treatment design. Lab tests also show that combination of DTPA with weaker chelating agents like ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), L-glutamic acid, N,N-diacetic acid (GLDA) or methyl glycine diacetic acid (MGDA) reduces barite dissolution and should be avoided during treatment design. Addition of synergists to the formulations, initially improves dissolution performance, especially for moderate <b>chelant</b> concentrations, but proves detrimental and hence must be avoided, over longer treatments. Finally, presence of competing ions in seawater, calcium sulfate and calcium carbonate, can significantly reduce barite dissolution and must be carefully studied for each formation-fluid system before design of treatments. Thus, this project sets a framework to identify the best <b>chelant</b> formulation and estimate its dissolution profile to ensure, a more informed treatment design for barite scale removal...|$|R

40|$|Phytoextraction is a {{technology}} to remove hazardous metals from soil which has developed {{rapidly in the}} last 20 yearsby using metal-tolerant hyperaccumulating plants or using plants with high biomass production and enhancing metal uptake using <b>chelants.</b> Although phytoextraction of metals is not a routine remediation approach, continued efforts {{have been made to}} refine this "green" technology in the hope that it could replace traditional remediation measures (e. g. excavation, soil washing, etc.), as soil handling less and costs are typically lower, leaving the soil fertile and able to support subsequent vegetation. Currently phytoextraction has not yet had significant success in field applications, due to difficulties in seeking environmental-friendly and effective <b>chelants</b> and low biomass production of many metal-tolerant plants. Conventional <b>chelants</b> enhance metal solubility in soil, but there are concerns over their use due to persistence in the environment and the potential for metal leaching to ground water. Therefore, {{there is a need to}} identify and evaluate <b>chelants</b> with potentially good metal-extraction efficiency and environmental compatibility. Recently, rhamnolipid, a biologically synthesized microbial product, has been used to remove metals from contaminated soils. In particular, rhamnolipid has been used to wash cadmium (Cd) from contaminated soils due to its strong affinity for Cd compared to many other metals. Unlike many conventional <b>chelants,</b> such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), rhamnolipid can form uncharged, lipophilic complexes with metal cations. There is some evidence that the uncharged or lipophilic metal rhamnolipid complexes are equally or more available than the free metal ions for plant uptake. Therefore, rhamnolipid could potentially be useful for Cd phytoextraction. This study therefore investigated the possibility of using rhamnolipid as a potential chelant to enhance the phytoextraction of Cd and its cocontaminant zinc (Zn). As well as cost and availability, the three key attributes of <b>chelants</b> that need to be considered in chelant-assisted phytoextraction are (i) persistence of the <b>chelants</b> in soil; (ii) adsorption behaviour of the <b>chelants</b> and its metal complexes; and (iii) toxicity of the <b>chelants</b> to plants. Chelant biodegradation is of importance to phytoextraction efficiency. Persistence in the environment is not regarded as favourable and too rapid degradation results in poor enhancement of metal availability. Hence rhamnolipid biodegradation in soil was compared with conventional <b>chelants,</b> i. e. EDTA and citric acid, in Chapter 2. Rhamnolipid (applied at low – 2. 0 mmol/kg soil and high – 10. 0 mmol/kg soil concentrations) was found to be biodegradable in soil, but persisted long enough to enable metal mobilisation during phytoextraction. Chapter 3 showed that soil sorption of rhamnolipid was concentration dependent, as was its ability to mobilise metal ions. In soil batch adsorption experiments, rhamnolipid was found to adsorb to soil when applied at low concentrations (< 1. 7 mM applied concentration, equivalent to 8. 5 mmol/kg soil), whereas when the concentration increased to 4. 4 mM (22 mmol/kg soil), rhamnolipid adsorption to soil reduced and Cd desorption was significantly increased. This effect may have been due to the formation of larger rhamnolipid aggregates (e. g. vesicles) at the higher rhamnolipid concentrations. Determination of the octanol/water partition coefficients for metal-rhamnolipid complexes showed that rhamnolipid complexes change their morphology and hydrophilicity with concentration, which could be an alternative reason for the reduced rhamnolipid adsorption in soil. A solution concentration of rhamnolipid ranging from 4 – 5 mM was found to be most promising for Cd and Zn phytoextraction because of the low rhamnolipid sorption to soil. High concentrations of applied rhamnolipid (4 – 5 mM, equivalent to 20 – 25 mmol/kg, as multiple weekly doses or applied as a single dose before harvest) were found to be the most suitable conditions selected for Cd and Zn mobilisation. However, rhamnolipid at those concentrations induced toxicity symptoms in maize (Zea mays). Therefore, the use of high concentrations (≥ 4 mM) was not suitable for phytoextraction. In a subsequent experiment, low concentrations of rhamnolipid (≤ 1. 4 mmol/kg, equivalent to 1 mM in soil solution) were assessed for their ability to enhance Cd uptake by maize (Zea mays) and sunflower (Helianthus annuus). Cadmium uptake was moderately improved (P ≤ 0. 001) following rhamnolipid application at 0. 02 and 0. 2 mmol/kg/week with no observable phytotoxicity. However, in general, rhamnolipid did not dramatically improve Cd and Zn uptake by the plant shoots. An aseptic hydroponic experiment (Chapter 4) was undertaken to understand the effect of rhamnolipid on plant uptake of Cd and Zn at low concentrations (4 – 20 μM). At constant total Cd and Zn concentrations in solution and with increasing EDTA concentrations, plant uptake of Cd decreased, conforming to the free ion activity model. Rhamnolipid complexed Cd and Zn to a lesser extent than EDTA, but enabled a relatively constant Cd and Zn uptake in the root as complexation increased and free ion activities declined. This effect may have been due to the absorption of intact metal-rhamnolipid complexes. At normal Ca concentrations (2 mM, commonly found in soil solutions) in the uptake solutions, Cd translocation from roots to shoots was inhibited compared to low Ca concentrations (0. 035 mM). This indicates that there will be no beneficial effect of rhamnolipid application on Cd phytoextraction in soil where Ca concentrations are several orders of magnitude higher than Cd. The body of the work emphasizes the key criteria for selecting suitable <b>chelants</b> for phytoextraction. Rhamnolipid was deemed to be unsuitable for Cd phytoextraction. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|The {{objective}} of this Ph. D project was to study the role of transition metal ions in oxidative hair colouring. Model systems corresponding to real-life hair colouring conditions were designed to examine copper(II) and iron(III) catalysed decomposition of alkaline hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radical formation. In a chelant-free system, copper(II) ions were more active in decomposing alkaline hydrogen peroxide compared to iron(III) ions. For copper(II) ions, the initial rate of decomposition of hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radical formation increased {{with an increase in}} initial concentration of copper(II) ions. Adding <b>chelants</b> to the reaction solution altered the catalytic activity of metal ions. EDTA and EDDS <b>chelants</b> with iron(III) generated more hydroxyl radical and decomposed higher amounts of hydrogen peroxide than the corresponding complexes of these <b>chelants</b> with copper(II) ions. Most studied <b>chelants</b> supressed catalytic activity of copper(II) ions except HEDP chelant which rapidly decomposed hydrogen peroxide. The results highlight that different metal-chelant systems have different level of catalytic activity in the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide. Adding large excess of calcium ions to the reaction solution influenced the binding of copper(II) ions. Unlike other <b>chelants,</b> only EDDS showed selective binding of copper(II) ions in the presence of calcium and suppressed the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide. Similar results were obtained for copper treated hair fibres, where EDDS again showed strong preference and selectivity for copper(II). This suggests that EDDS is the best chelant to control free radical mediated protein hair damage during oxidative hair colouring. The selectivity of EDDS chelant was explained using speciation plots. Catalytic activity of copper(II) ions was also examined in the presence of aromatic dye precursors. PPD/MAP combination suppressed decomposition of alkaline hydrogen peroxide which suggests that oxidative hair dyeing is likely to induce less protein damage to hair as compared to the bleaching systems. It is believed that some unknown intermediates are formed which chelate copper catalysts changing their chemical activity. Among the <b>chelants</b> examined in the current study, HEDP is an exception as its mixture with copper(II) ions led to rapid decomposition of alkaline hydrogen peroxide and showed a very unusual kinetic profile. A mechanistic study showed that the decomposition reaction proceeds via formation of an active catalyst that degrades the chelant and eventually seeds formation of catalytically-inactive basic copper phosphate/carbonate nanoparticles. The nanoparticles prevent any further catalytic reaction as freshly added Cu 2 + ions quickly adsorb on their surface and do not form active catalyst. In a separate study, human hair samples were analysed to quantify the amount of calcium carbonate present in the bubble shaped structures lying over the hair shaft. SEM Images were analysed to estimate the amount of material present while quantitative gas IR analysis showed that the amount of calcium carbonate increased with increasing bubble count level. Calcium carbonate found by IR analysis was less than the values estimated by image analysis which suggested that calcium carbonate may not be the only material present in the bubble and some other unknown material may also be present...|$|E

Precipitation of iron (III) within the formation can cause formation damage. Chelating agents such as EDTA and NTA are usually added to acids to minimize iron precipitation. Drawbacks of these chelating agents include limited solubility in strong acids and poor environmental profile. Hydroxy EDTA was introduced because of its higher solubility in 15 wt% HCl. However, its solubility in 28 wt% HCl is low and it is not readily biodegradable.

The paper deals with the results from the lab-scale washing treatments of a real sample of metal-contaminated soil for the removal of the ecotoxic metal ions (Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn) using five biodegradable APCs, namely [S,S]-ethylenediaminedisuccinic acid, imminodisuccinic acid, methylglycinediacetic acid, DL- 2 -(2 -carboxymethyl) nitrilotriacetic acid (GLDA), and 3 -hydroxy- 2, 2 '-iminodisuccinic acid. The performance of those biodegradable APCs was evaluated for their interaction with the soil mineral constituents in terms of the solution pH and metal-chelant stability constants, and compared with that of EDTA. Speciation calculations were performed to identify the optimal conditions for the washing process in terms of the metal-chelant interactions as well as to understand the selectivity in the separation ability of the biodegradable <b>chelants</b> towards the metal ions. A linear relationship between the metal extraction capacity of the individual <b>chelants</b> towards each of the metal ions from the soil matrix and metal-chelant conditional stability constants for a solution pH greater than 6 was observed. Additional considerations were derived from the behavior of the major potentially interfering cations (Al, Ca, Fe, Mg, and Mn), and it was hypothesized that use of an excess of chelant may minimize the possible competition effects during the single-step washing treatments.

The MRT gel showed a higher recovery rate compared with other SPE materials at 20 °C using a flow rate of 0. 2 mL min- 1. The effects of solution pH, metal-chelant stability constants and ionic radii were assessed for 32 metals. Compared to the conventional treatment options for such waste solutions, our proposed technique has the advantage of non-destructive separation of both metal ions and <b>chelants.</b> © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|A feasibility/treatability {{study was}} {{performed}} to investigate the leaching potential of heavy metals (particularly lead) from soils at the Grafenw 6 hr Training Area (GTA) in Germany. The study included {{an evaluation of the}} effectiveness of <b>chelant</b> extraction to remediate the heavy-metal-contarninated soils. Batch shaker tests indicated that ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) (0. 01 M) was more effective than citric acid (0. 01 M) at removing cadmium, copper, lead, and zinc. EDTA and citric acid were equally effective in mobilizing chromium and barium from the soil. The batch shaker technique with <b>chelant</b> extraction offers promise as a remediation technique for heavy-metal-contaninated soil at the GTA. Columnar flooding tests conducted as part of the study revealed that deionized water was the least effective leaching solution for mobilization of the heavy metals; the maximum solubilization obtained was 3. 72 % for cadmium. EDTA (0. 05 M) achieved the greatest removal of lead (average removal of 17. 6 %). The difficulty of extraction using deionized water indicates that all of the heavy metals are very tightly bound to the soil; therefore, they are very stable in the GTA soils and do not pose a serious threat to the groundwater system. Columnar flooding probably does not represent a viable remediation technique for in-situ cleanup of heavy-metal-contaminated soils at the GTA...|$|R
40|$|Non-ferrous {{smelting}} dust, especially lead-smelting dust (LSD), contains percent {{levels of}} indium and thus constitutes a novel indium resource. The main difficulty in recovering indium from LSD is the coexisting presence of lead and zinc. In this study, a unique indium separation process was designed, combining techniques that involve washing with a <b>chelant,</b> leaching with acid and precipitation as hydroxide. The {{majority of the}} Pb in the LSD was selectively separated during chelant-assisted washing with ethylenediaminedisuccinate (EDDS), while the residual Pb was diminished through an acid leaching treatment with a mixed solution of sulfuric acid and hydrochloric acid. The <b>chelant</b> washing step also ensures {{a decrease in the}} raw LSD weight at a ratio of approximately 82 % due to the removal of lead and counterions such as sulfate, and the washing step also minimizes the consumption of corrosive acids in the subsequent step. Selective indium separation from LSD is further complicated by the similarity of the behavior of zinc during the acid leaching step. Therefore, hydroxide precipitation at pH 5 has been introduced as the final step, ensuring the maintenance of zinc as a soluble species in the supernatant and the selective separation of indium (~ 88 %) as a hydroxide precipitate. © 2015 Elsevier B.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to assess the extraction efficiency of two different synthetic <b>chelants</b> [Ethelyne diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) and Salicylic acid (SA) ] for desorbing Pb from Pb contaminated soil. Pot experiments were conducted in randomized block designing. First group of plants were treated with different Pb concentrations like 0, 100, 200, 400 and 800 mg/L. Second group of plants were treated with same Pb concentrations along with Chelant EDTA of 2. 4 mM and third group of plants were also treated with same Pb concentrations along with Chelant salicylic acid (2. 4 mM). EDTA and SA were applied after 6 weeks of growth i. e., at rosette stage. Different physical and biochemical parameters were studied. The concentrations of Pb in plant samples were determined by Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer. It was found that Pb accumulation in mustard plant was significantly more enhanced by EDTA than that of SA. <b>Chelants</b> were found to improve Pb uptake by plants. In conclusion, chelate-assisted phytoextraction showed better results than continuous phytoextraction. B. juncea arawali is a suitable candidate for chelate-assisted phytoextraction of Pb...|$|E

40|$|The complex {{formation}} equilibria of Cr 3 + and Fe 3 + ions in {{aqueous solution}} with two biodegradable aminopolycarboxylate <b>chelants</b> (dl- 2 -(2 -carboxymethyl) nitrilotriacetic acid (GLDA) and 3 -hydroxy- 2, 2 '- iminodisuccinic acid (HIDS)) were investigated. The potentiometric data obtained at the constant ionic strengths (I) of (0. 1 and 1. 0) mol·dm- 3 KCl and at (25 ± 0. 1) °C was processed {{with the aid of}} the computer program HYPERQUAD 2008. The formation constants of the proton-chelant and metal-chelant (log KML) species (M = Fe 3 + or Cr 3 +; L = GLDA or HIDS) were determined, and the concentration distributions of complex species in solution were evaluated for both metal ions. In various pH conditions, the interaction between the <b>chelants</b> (L = GLDA or HIDS) and the metal ions (M = Fe 3 + or Cr 3 +) leads to the formation of different complexes formulated as MH 2 L+, MHL, ML-, M(OH) L 2 -, and M(OH) 2 L 3 -. The log KML values at I = 0. 1 mol·dm- 3 KCl (T = (25 ± 0. 1) °C) were 15. 27 (log KFe-GLDA), 14. 96 (log K Fe-HIDS), 13. 77 (log KCr-GLDA), 12. 67 (log K Cr-HIDS), and at I = 1. 0 mol·dm- 3 KCl (T = (25 ± 0. 1) °C) were 14. 79 (log KFe-GLDA), 14. 34 (log K Fe-HIDS), 12. 90 (log KCr-GLDA), 12. 09 (log K Cr-HIDS). The conditional stability constants (log K'ML) of the ML complexes were calculated in terms of pH in the range of 2 to 12 and compared with the same for EDTA and other biodegradable <b>chelants</b> (NTA and EDDS). © 2012 American Chemical Society...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{application}} of phytostabilization and assisted phytoextraction to the remediation of abandoned mining areas {{can be a}} valuable method to reclaim these areas without modifying soil and landscape characteristics. An in situ {{application of}} a continuous phytoextraction techniquewas {{carried out in the}} area of Campo Pisano (Sardinia, Italy), followed by a laboratory assisted phytoextraction test using the biodegradable chelating agents methylglycine diacetic acid (MGDA) and iminodissuccinic acid (IDSA). The plants used were Scrophularia canina subsp. bicolor, Cistus salviifolius and Teucrium flavum subsp. glaucum. RESULTS: The plant that accumulatedmore Pb was T. glaucum (353 mg kg− 1) while C. salviifolius demonstrated better ability to accumulate Zn (1560 mg kg− 1). S. bicolor showed abetter tolerance to metals but accumulated 119 mg kg− 1 of Pb. Accumulation of metals immediately after <b>chelant</b> application was up to 300 mg kg− 1 of Pb and 3000 mg kg− 1 of Zn which did not further increase during the assisted phytoextraction experiment. CONCLUSION: The plant that demonstrated to bemost suitable for phytoremediation applicationwas S. bicolor due to its higher biomass production and tolerance tometals.

30|$|The {{acidizing}} {{system has}} been developed using revised acidizing guidelines that are formation damage specific, and are also specific to rock mineralogical composition and distribution. Traditional guidelines have been modified with respect to certain mineral sensitivities. Specifically, these modifications included more explicit consideration {{for the presence of}} acid-sensitive minerals such as zeolites, chloride, and feldspars, and their distribution in the rock matrix and in the pore space. These guidelines have been also augmented with respect to certain acid blends such as phosphonic acids and acid <b>chelant</b> systems which are more tolerant to temperature, calcium and zeolite presence, and to clay sensitivity.|$|R
