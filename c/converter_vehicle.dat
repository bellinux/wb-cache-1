40|$|The fuel {{optimal control}} of modern {{vehicles}} involves {{the control of}} several components: the automated manual transmission, power split between the engine and secondary power <b>converter,</b> <b>vehicle</b> velocity, clutch position and motor start-stop. These controls are often optimized separate from each other, which leads to suboptimal results. In this paper {{we focus on the}} combined optimization of hybrid system use, gearbox and vehicle velocity. A novel cost function description is used which describes the influence of the automated manual transmission, the potential of brake energy recovery, and the vehicle velocity with one control signal, and, therefore, reduces the computational complexity. The cost is modeled using a piecewise affine continuous function, which has the advantage of the control appearing affine in the Hamiltonian. Besides the standard optimal control solution for systems with an affine cost function, non-smooth optimal control theory is involved to obtain a solution shape that fulfills the necessary conditions of optimality. Since the length and cost of each subarc, that fulfills the necessary conditions of optimality, in travel time and fuel consumption, can analytically be expressed in its start and end state, the fuel optimal control of a vehicle with energy recovery options is rewritten as a nonlinear optimization problem...|$|E

Synthetic diesel fuels can have very low sulfur and aromatic content, and excellent autoignition characteristics. Moreover, synthetic diesel fuels may also economically competitive with California diesel fuel if. roduced in large volumes. Previous engine laboratory and field tests using a heavy-duty chassis dynamometer indicate that synthetic diesel fuel made using the Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) catalytic conversion process is a promising alternative fuel, because it can be used in unmodified diesel engines, and can reduce exhaust emissions substantially. The objective of this study was a preliminary assessment of the emissions from older model transit operated on Mossgas synthetic diesel fuel. The study compared emissions from transit buses operating on Federal no. 2 Diesel fuel, Mossgas synthetic diesel (MGSD), and a 50 / 50 blend of the two fuels. The buses were equipped with unmodified Detroit Diesel 6 V 92 2 -stroke diesel engines. Six 40 -foot buses were tested. Three of the buses had recently rebuilt engines and were equipped with an oxidation catalytic <b>converter.</b> <b>Vehicle</b> emissions measurements were performed using West Virginia University's unique transportable chassis dynamometer. The emissions were measured over the Central Business District (CBD) driving cycle. The buses performed well on both neat and blended MGSD fuel. Three buses without catalytic converters were tested. Compared to their emissions when operating on Federal no. 2 diesel fuel, these buses emitted an average of 5 % lower oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and 20 % lower particulate matter (PM) when operating on neat MGSD fuel. Catalyst equipped buses emitted an average of 8 % lower NOx and 31 % lower PM when operating on MGSD than when operating on Federal no. 2 diesel fuel...|$|E

40|$|Introduction – Transportation {{accounts}} for {{about a quarter of}} energy use [1], so efficiency improvements in energy conversions allow reductions in fuel consumption and pollutant emissions of internal combustion engines used for vehicle propulsion.

A substantial gain in vehicle efficiency is primarily a matter of improved vehicle design and only secondarily depends on engine type and efficiency. In fact measures like reductions of vehicle mass, aerodynamic drag and rolling resistance contribute to less power and mass needed for both engine and drivetrain. The authors are now focused on innovative propulsion systems [6 - 8] in order to achieve greater vehicle efficiency and higher safety in transportation means (i. e. the propelling force is independent of drag between traction wheels and road ― useful especially in bad weather conditions...|$|R

5000|$|Catalytic {{converters}} {{restrict the}} free flow of exhaust, which negatively affects vehicle performance and fuel economy, especially in older cars. Because early cars' carburetors were incapable of precise fuel-air mixture control, the cars' catalytic converters could overheat and ignite flammable materials under the car. A 2006 test on a 1999 Honda Civic showed that removing the stock catalytic converter netted a 3% increase in horsepower; a new metallic core converter only cost the car 1% horsepower, compared to no converter. To some performance enthusiasts, this modest increase in power for very little cost encourages the removal or [...] "gutting" [...] of the catalytic converter. In such cases, the converter may be replaced by a welded-in section of ordinary pipe or a flanged [...] "test pipe", ostensibly meant to check if the converter is clogged, by comparing how the engine runs with and without the converter. This facilitates temporary reinstallation of the converter in order to pass an emission test. In many jurisdictions, it is illegal to remove or disable a catalytic converter for any reason other than its direct and immediate replacement. In the United States, for example, it is a violation of Section 203(a)(3)(A) of the 1990 Clean Air Act for a vehicle repair shop to remove a <b>converter</b> from a <b>vehicle,</b> or cause a converter to be removed from a vehicle, except in order to replace it with another converter, and Section 203(a)(3)(B) makes it illegal for any person to sell or to install any part that would bypass, defeat or render inoperative any emission control system, device or design element. Vehicles without functioning catalytic converters generally fail emission inspections.
