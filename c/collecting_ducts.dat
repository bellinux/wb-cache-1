5|$|Nemertea use organs called protonephridia to excrete soluble waste products, {{especially}} nitrogenous by-products {{of cellular}} metabolism. In nemertean protonephridia, flame cells which filter out the wastes {{are embedded in}} the front part of the two lateral fluid vessels. The flame cells remove the wastes into two <b>collecting</b> <b>ducts,</b> one on either side, and each duct has one or more nephridiopores through which the wastes exit. Semiterrestrial and freshwater nemerteans have many more flame cells than marines, sometimes thousands. The {{reason may be that}} osmoregulation is more difficult in non-marine environments.|$|E
5|$|The {{adrenal gland}} {{produces}} aldosterone, a mineralocorticoid, {{which is important}} in the regulation of salt ("mineral") balance and blood volume. In the kidneys, aldosterone acts on the distal convoluted tubules and the <b>collecting</b> <b>ducts</b> by increasing the reabsorption of sodium and the excretion of both potassium and hydrogen ions. Aldosterone is responsible for the reabsorption of about 2% of filtered sodium in the kidneys, which is nearly equal to the entire sodium content in human blood under normal glomerular filtration rates. Sodium retention is also a response of the distal colon and sweat glands to aldosterone receptor stimulation. Angiotensin II and extracellular potassium are the two main regulators of aldosterone production. The amount of sodium present in the body affects the extracellular volume, which in turn influences blood pressure. Therefore, the effects of aldosterone in sodium retention are important for the regulation of blood pressure.|$|E
25|$|The kidneys of {{reptiles}} {{consist of a}} number of lobules arranged in a broadly linear pattern. Each lobule contains a single branch of the ureter in its centre, into which the <b>collecting</b> <b>ducts</b> empty. Reptiles have relatively few nephrons compared with other amniotes of a similar size, possibly because of their lower metabolic rate.|$|E
40|$|The various {{segments}} of the <b>collecting</b> <b>duct</b> have interesting and important roles in the urinary concentrating mechanism. On one hand, the <b>collecting</b> <b>duct</b> contributes insignificantly to the medullary interstitial concentrating process, {{but on the other}} hand, urinary concentration occurs as the result of water abstraction from the <b>collecting</b> <b>duct</b> as it courses from the cortex to the papillary tip. Thus, the <b>collecting</b> <b>duct</b> seems to do little work for medullary concentration. It, nevertheless, gets credit for regulation of the final urine osmolality. The latter occurs as a consequence of finely tuned mechanisms which regulate the <b>collecting</b> <b>duct's</b> water permeability in an ambience where the interstitial osmolality is controlled by highly integrated mechanisms involving numerous different nephron segments. The {{purpose of this article is}} to review the specific role of each segment of the <b>collecting</b> <b>duct</b> in the urinary concentrating mechanism, while other contributions in this Symposium will discuss the water permeability of the <b>collecting</b> <b>duct</b> and the generation and maintenance of the medullary interstitial osmolality...|$|R

40|$|This review covers {{aspects of}} Na and K {{transport}} along {{the three major}} regions of the collecting duct: the cortical <b>collecting</b> <b>duct</b> (CCD), the outer medullary <b>collecting</b> <b>duct</b> (OMCD), and the inner medullary <b>collecting</b> <b>duct</b> (IMCD). The basic cell models {{that have been developed}} {{over the past several years}} are included with an attempt to integrate some of the newer observations on specific transport processes and their regulation. Heterogeneity along the <b>collecting</b> <b>duct</b> is emphasized as are species differences insofar as they are known. The normal mechanisms of Na and K transport are presented in the context of their long-term regulation by steroid hormones. The enormous increase in the understanding of the subject over the past several years precludes a detailed review of <b>collecting</b> <b>duct</b> function and its hormonal regulation. Mechanisms of Na transport regulation in epithelial models of the <b>collecting</b> <b>duct</b> are mentioned to the extent that they provide illustrative mechanisms.

25|$|The cycling of and {{excretion}} of urea by {{the kidneys}} {{is a vital}} part of mammalian metabolism. Besides its role as carrier of waste nitrogen, urea also plays a role in the countercurrent exchange system of the nephrons, that allows for re-absorption of water and critical ions from the excreted urine. Urea is reabsorbed in the inner medullary <b>collecting</b> <b>ducts</b> of the nephrons, thus raising the osmolarity in the medullary interstitium surrounding the thin descending limb of the loop of Henle, which makes the water reabsorb.|$|E
25|$|The lymphatic vessels, {{also called}} lymph vessels, conduct lymph between {{different}} parts of the body. They include the tubular vessels of the lymph capillaries, and the larger collecting vessels–the right lymphatic duct and the thoracic duct (the left lymphatic duct). The lymph capillaries are mainly responsible for the absorption of interstitial fluid from the tissues, while lymph vessels propel the absorbed fluid forward into the larger <b>collecting</b> <b>ducts,</b> where it ultimately returns to the bloodstream via one of the subclavian veins. These vessels are also called the lymphatic channels or simply lymphatics.|$|E
25|$|ADPKD, {{together}} {{with many other}} diseases that present with renal cysts, can be classified into a family of diseases known as ciliopathies. Epithelial cells of the renal tubules, including all the segments of the nephron and the <b>collecting</b> <b>ducts</b> (with the exception of intercalated cells) show {{the presence of a}} single primary apical cilium. Polycystin-1, the protein encoded by the PKD1 gene, is present on these cilia and is thought to sense the flow with its large extracellular domains, activating the calcium channels associated with polycystin-2, the product of gene PKD2, {{as a result of the}} genetic setting of ADPKD as explained in the genetics sub-section below.|$|E
40|$|AbstractC 57 BL/ 6 J mice {{homozygous}} for the cpk gene exhibit an {{autosomal recessive}} (AR) form of {{polycystic kidney disease}} (PKD), similar to human ARPKD, with massive <b>collecting</b> <b>duct</b> cysts. These cysts are lined by epithelia with an immature phenotype. Since renal expression of epidermal growth factor (EGF) is also significantly decreased in affected mice, we hypothesized that renal EGF is necessary for normal developmental maturation of the <b>collecting</b> <b>duct.</b> To determine if the lack of EGF may be a decisive factor in the initiation and/or growth of <b>collecting</b> <b>duct</b> cysts, we administered exogenous EGF (1 μg/g body wt subcutaneously) daily for Postnatal Days 3 - 9 (a critical period for <b>collecting</b> <b>duct</b> maturation) to C 57 BL/ 6 J-cpk mice. EGF but not sham or albumin treatment retarded the development of PKD, reduced the degree of renal failure associated with the disease, and prolonged the survival of cystic mice. Sulfated glycoprotein- 2 gene expression, a marker of immaturity in <b>collecting</b> <b>duct</b> cells, was reduced in cystic kidney by EGF treatment. This finding indicates that EGF treatment was associated {{with an increase in}} the maturation of the <b>collecting</b> <b>duct</b> epithelial cells. These findings support the view that decreased EGF may {{play a significant role in}} promoting the enlargement of <b>collecting</b> <b>duct</b> cysts in a hereditary model of ARPKD and that PKD involves defective and/or arrested <b>collecting</b> <b>duct</b> cell maturation...|$|R
40|$|P CDAmpl, a new antigen at the {{interface}} of the embryonic <b>collecting</b> <b>duct</b> epithelium and the nephrogenic mesenchyme. In the neonatal rabbit kidney nephrogenesis {{is not yet}} terminated. The ampullar <b>collecting</b> <b>duct</b> epithelium acts as an inducer that generates the nephron anlagen, however, to date the morphogenic mechanisms involved are unknown. A presupposition for successful nephron induction is the close tissue interaction between the basal aspect of the ampullar <b>collecting</b> <b>duct</b> epithelium and the surrounding mesenchyme. To gain new insights in this area we raised monoclonal antibodies (mabs), to identify specific structures localized at the tissue interface. With the generated mab CDAmpl we found an intensive immunohistochemical reaction between the basal aspect of the ampullar <b>collecting</b> <b>duct</b> epithelium and the mesenchyme. The label was most concentrated at the ampullar tip and continuously decreased in the shaft region. In the maturing <b>collecting</b> <b>duct</b> of the neonatal kidney and in the adult renal <b>collecting</b> <b>duct</b> no immunohistochemical reaction was found. The binding pattern of mab CDAmpl {{is different from that}} of all known <b>collecting</b> <b>duct</b> cell markers and from antibodies against known basement membrane compounds such as laminin or collagen type IV. Under in vitro conditions immunoreactivity with mab CDAmpl was obtained using embryonic <b>collecting</b> <b>duct</b> epithelia and perfusion culture. The antigen was present in specimens treated with Iscove's modified Dulbecco's Medium (IMDM) containing 10 % fetal bovine serum. Omittance of serum or hormonal treatment with aldosterone, insulin or vitamin D 3 led to the disappearance of the newly detected antigen, while characteristics of the differentiated <b>collecting</b> <b>duct</b> cells were up-regulated. We conclude that the expression of P CDAmpl is a characteristic feature of the embryonic parts of the <b>collecting</b> <b>duct</b> epithelium. It may play a pivotal role during nephron induction...|$|R
40|$|A graphic {{reconstruction}} {{has been}} made of a submucosal gland from a normal human main bronchus, revealing a <b>collecting</b> <b>duct</b> not previously described. Ciliated respiratory epithelium dips into the gland opening to line {{the first part of the}} duct, the ciliated duct, and then gives way, in the <b>collecting</b> <b>duct,</b> to an epithelium composed of tall, columnar, eosinophilic cells containing numerous large mitochondria. This cell structure suggests that the <b>collecting</b> <b>duct</b> controls ionic and water concentration.

25|$|Vasopressin receptors {{activated}} by vasopressin are {{found on the}} basolateral membrane of the cells lining the <b>collecting</b> <b>ducts</b> of the kidneys. Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage(aSAH) results in hyponatremia which leads to water retention and antidiuretic hormone release causing increase in intracranial pressure and formation of cerebral edema. This can be prevented by administration of conivaptan, a safe FDA approved drug that treats euvolemic hyponatremia. Through the process of aquaresis, conivapten which is a vasopressin receptor antagonist improves serum sodium concentration while eliminating free water without having any negative effect on systolic blood pressure and pulse rate. Since it can decrease cerebral volume and ICP, it has a potential to treat many forms of cerebral edema.|$|E
25|$|In the {{majority}} of vertebrates, the mesonephros persists into the adult, albeit usually fused with the more advanced metanephros; only in amniotes is the mesonephros restricted to the embryo. The kidneys of fish and amphibians are typically narrow, elongated organs, occupying {{a significant portion of}} the trunk. The <b>collecting</b> <b>ducts</b> from each cluster of nephrons usually drain into an archinephric duct, which is homologous with the vas deferens of amniotes. However, the situation is not always so simple; in cartilaginous fish and some amphibians, there is also a shorter duct, similar to the amniote ureter, which drains the posterior (metanephric) parts of the kidney, and joins with the archinephric duct at the bladder or cloaca. Indeed, in many cartilaginous fish, the anterior portion of the kidney may degenerate or cease to function altogether in the adult.|$|E
25|$|Angiotensin I {{is further}} cleaved {{in the lungs}} by endothelial-bound {{angiotensin}}-converting enzyme (ACE) into angiotensin II, the most vasoactive peptide. Angiotensin II is a potent constrictor of all blood vessels. It acts on the smooth muscle and, therefore, raises the resistance posed by these arteries to the heart. The heart, trying to overcome this increase in its 'load', works more vigorously, causing the blood pressure to rise. Angiotensin II also acts on the adrenal glands and releases aldosterone, which stimulates the epithelial cells in the distal tubule and <b>collecting</b> <b>ducts</b> of the kidneys to increase re-absorption of sodium, exchanging with potassium to maintain electrochemical neutrality, and water, leading to raised blood volume and raised blood pressure. The RAS also acts on the CNS to increase water intake by stimulating thirst, as well as conserving blood volume, by reducing urinary loss through the secretion of vasopressin from the posterior pituitary gland.|$|E
40|$|Previously we {{demonstrated}} in rats that chronic hyperkalemia {{had no effect}} on ammonium secretion by the proximal tubule in vivo but that high K+ concentrations inhibited ammonium absorption by the medullary thick ascending limb in vitro. These observations suggested that chronic hyperkalemia may reduce urinary ammonium excretion through effects on medullary transport events. To examine directly the effects of chronic hyperkalemia on medullary ammonium accumulation and <b>collecting</b> <b>duct</b> ammonium secretion, micropuncture experiments were performed in the inner medulla of Munich-Wistar rats pair fed a control or high-K+ diet for 7 - 13 d. In situ pH and total ammonia concentrations were measured to calculate NH 3 concentrations for base and tip <b>collecting</b> <b>duct</b> and vasa recta. Chronic K+ loading was associated with significant systemic metabolic acidosis and a 40 % decrease in urinary ammonium excretion. In control rats, 15 % of excreted ammonium was secreted between base and tip <b>collecting</b> <b>duct</b> sites. In contrast, no net transport of ammonium was detected along the <b>collecting</b> <b>duct</b> in high-K+ rats. The decrease in <b>collecting</b> <b>duct</b> ammonium secretion in hyperkalemia was associated with a decrease in the NH 3 concentration difference between vasa recta and <b>collecting</b> <b>duct.</b> The fall in the NH 3 concentration difference across the <b>collecting</b> <b>duct</b> in high-K+ rats was due entirely to a decrease in [NH 3] in the medullary interstitial fluid, with no change in [NH 3] in the <b>collecting</b> <b>duct.</b> These results indicate that impaired accumulation of ammonium in the medullary interstitium, secondary to inhibition of ammonium absorption in the medullary thick ascending limb, may {{play an important role in}} reducing <b>collecting</b> <b>duct</b> ammonium secretion and urinary ammonium excretion during chronic hyperkalemia...|$|R

40|$|Calmodulin plays a {{critical}} role in regulation of renal <b>collecting</b> <b>duct</b> water permeability by vasopressin. However, specific targets for calmodulin action have not been thoroughly addressed. In the present study, we investigated whether Ca+ 2 /calmodulin regulates adenylyl cyclase activity in the renal inner medullary <b>collecting</b> <b>duct.</b> Rat inner medullary <b>collecting</b> <b>duct</b> suspensions were incubated in {{the presence or absence of}} 0. 1 nM vasopressin and the calmodulin inhibitors, monodansylcadaverine, W- 7, and trifluoperazine followed by measurement of cAMP. Vasopressin-stimulated cAMP elevation was significantly attenuated in the presence of calmodulin inhibitors. Analysis of transglutaminase 2 knockout mice confirmed that these compounds were not acting through inhibition of transglutaminase 2 activity. Calmodulin inhibitors also blocked both cholera toxin- and forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation. In isolated perfused tubules, W- 7 reversibly blocked vasopressin-stimulated urea permeability, a process that requires a rise in intracellular cAMP, but does not appear to involve protein trafficking to the apical plasma membrane. These results suggest that calmodulin is required for vasopressin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in intact inner medullary <b>collecting</b> <b>duct.</b> RT-PCR, immunoblotting, and immunohistochemistry revealed the presence of the calmodulin-sensitive adenylyl cyclase type 3 in rat <b>collecting</b> <b>duct,</b> an isoform previously not known to be expressed in <b>collecting</b> <b>duct.</b> Long-term treatment of Brattleboro rats with a vasopressin analog markedly decreased adenylyl cyclase type 3 protein abundance, providing an explanation for long-term downregulation of vasopressin response in <b>collecting</b> <b>duct.</b> These studies demonstrate the importance of calmodulin in the regulation of <b>collecting</b> <b>duct</b> adenylyl cyclase activity and transport function...|$|R
2500|$|The main {{effector}} organ for fluid homeostasis is the kidney. ADH acts {{by increasing}} water permeability in the <b>collecting</b> <b>ducts</b> and distal convoluted tubules; specifically, it acts on proteins called aquaporins {{and more specifically}} aquaporin 2 in the following cascade. When released, ADH binds to V2 G-protein coupled receptors within the distal convoluted tubules, increasing cyclic AMP, which couples with protein kinase A, stimulating translocation of the aquaporin 2 channel stored in the cytoplasm of the distal convoluted tubules and <b>collecting</b> <b>ducts</b> into the apical membrane.

40|$|Tight {{junctions}} (TJs) play a {{key role}} in mediating paracellular ion reabsorption in the kidney. The paracellular pathway in the <b>collecting</b> <b>duct</b> of the kidney is a predominant route for transepithelial chloride reabsorption that determines the extracellular NaCl content and the blood pressure. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the paracellular chloride reabsorption in the <b>collecting</b> <b>duct</b> are not understood. Here we showed that in mouse kidney <b>collecting</b> <b>duct</b> cells, claudin- 4 functioned as a Cl– channel. A positively charged lysine residue at position 65 of claudin- 4 was critical for its anion selectivity. Claudin- 4 was observed to interact with claudin- 8 using several criteria. In the <b>collecting</b> <b>duct</b> cells, the assembly of claudin- 4 into TJ strands required its interaction with claudin- 8. Depletion of claudin- 8 resulted in the loss of paracellular chloride conductance, through a mechanism involving its recruitment of claudin- 4 during TJ assembly. Together, our data show that claudin- 4 interacts with claudin- 8 and that their association is required for the anion-selective paracellular pathway in the <b>collecting</b> <b>duct,</b> suggesting a mechanism for coupling chloride reabsorption with sodium reabsorption in the <b>collecting</b> <b>duct...</b>|$|R
2500|$|Aldosterone, {{the main}} {{mineralocorticoid}} hormone, is a steroid hormone {{produced by the}} zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex in the adrenal gland.
