40|$|Abstract — Recent {{advances}} {{in the area of}} wireless communica-tions have revealed the emerging need for efficient wireless access in personal, local and wide area networks. Space division multiple access (SDMA) with smart antennas at the base station is recognized as a promising means of increasing system capacity and supporting rate-demanding services. However, the existence of SDMA at the physical layer raises significant issues at higher layers. In this paper, we attempt to capture the impact of SDMA on channel allocation at the media access control (MAC) layer. This impact obtains different forms in TDMA, CDMA and OFDMA access schemes, due to the different cochannel and inter-channel interference instances, as well as the different effect of corresponding <b>channels</b> (<b>time</b> <b>slots,</b> codes or subcarrier frequencies) on user channel characteristics. We follow a unified approach for these multiple access schemes and propose heuristic algorithms to allocate channels to users and adjus...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{alleviate}} interference and contention in a wireless network, we may exploit {{the existence of}} multiple orthogonal <b>channels</b> or <b>time</b> <b>slots,</b> thus achieving a substantial improvement in performance. In this paper we study a joint transmission scheduling and power control problem that arises in wireless networks. The goal is to assign <b>channels</b> (or <b>time</b> <b>slots)</b> and transmitting powers to communication links such that all communication requests are processed correctly, specified Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements are met, {{and the number of}} required <b>time</b> <b>slots</b> is minimised. First, we formulate the problem as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP). Then, we show that the problem considered is NP-hard and subsequently, we propose non-trivial bounding techniques to solve it. Optimisation methods are also discussed, including a column generation approach, specifically designed to find bounds for the transmission scheduling problem. Moreover, we develop optimisation techniques in which the bounding techniques are integrated in order to derive the optimal solution to the problem faster. We close with an extensive computational study, which shows that despite the complexity of the problem, the proposed methodology scales to problems of nontrivial size. Our algorithms can therefore be used for static wireless networks where propagation conditions are almost constant and a centralised agent is available (e. g. cellular networks where the base station can act as a centralised agent or wireless mesh networks), and they can also serve as a benchmark for the performance evaluation of heuristic, approximation or distributed algorithms that aim to find near...|$|R
