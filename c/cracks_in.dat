5|$|A {{few weeks}} after the storm, a severe {{outbreak}} of fire blight, a bacterial infection, occurred in the Annapolis Valley of Nova Scotia, affecting as many as 80 percent of the Valley's apple orchards. The storm was blamed for causing microscopic <b>cracks</b> <b>in</b> leaves, which allowed airborne bacteria to enter the plants.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, {{the mysterious}} {{character}} River Song (Alex Kingston) summons alien time traveller the Doctor (Matt Smith) and his companion Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) to Roman Britain in 102 AD, where underneath Stonehenge lies a fabled prison called the Pandorica that legend tells holds the most fearsome {{being in the}} whole universe. However, it is discovered that the Doctor has been put in a trap by an alliance of his greatest enemies to save the universe from <b>cracks</b> <b>in</b> time that were caused by the Doctor's space-time vessel the TARDIS. Amy's fiancé, Rory (Arthur Darvill), who had previously been erased from existence {{from one of the}} <b>cracks</b> <b>in</b> the universe, makes a return, though he is revealed to be an Auton duplicate outfitted with his consciousness.|$|E
5|$|Kauri gum {{formed when}} resin from kauri trees leaked out through {{fractures}} or <b>cracks</b> <b>in</b> the bark, hardening with {{the exposure to}} air.

5|$|Civil Aeronautics Board {{investigators}} {{concluded that}} the outer portion of the wing had detached {{from the rest of}} the wing. The investigation revealed a fatigue crack 7/8inch long and 3/32inch deep at the point of detachment. Similar cracks were found on the wing root fittings of another Martin 2-0-2 aircraft that flew the same flight path through the same storm shortly after Flight 421. October inspections of three other Martin 2-0-2 aircraft revealed identical fatigue <b>cracks</b> <b>in</b> similar locations.|$|E

40|$|The morphology, distribution, {{geologic}} {{environment and}} relative age of large-scale polygonal trough systems on Mars are examined. The troughs are steep-walled, flat-floored, sinuous depressions typically 200 - 800 m wide, 20 - 120 m deep and spaced 5 - 10 km apart. The mechanics of formation of tension cracks is reviewed {{to identify the}} factors controlling the scale of tension crack systems; special {{emphasis is placed on}} thermal <b>cracking</b> <b>in</b> permafrost. It is shown that because of the extremely large scale of the Martian fracture systems, they could not have formed by thermal <b>cracking</b> <b>in</b> permafrost, dessication <b>cracking</b> <b>in</b> sediments or contraction <b>cracking</b> <b>in</b> cooling lava. On the basis of photogeologic evidence and analog studies, it is proposed that polygonal troughs on the northern plains of Mars are grabens...|$|R
5|$|Early {{aircraft}} {{suffered from}} leaks in wing fuel tanks that required re-sealing after each flight and 85 aircraft {{were found to}} have <b>cracks</b> <b>in</b> outer wing ribs and stringers. There were also problems with aileron control cylinders, electrical connectors, and engine compartment fires. Reconnaissance RF-4Cs made their debut in Vietnam on 30 October 1965, flying the hazardous post-strike reconnaissance missions. The USAF Thunderbirds used the F-4E from the 1969 season until 1974.|$|E
5|$|In June 2009, the National Trust {{announced}} plans to reclad the monument {{at a cost of}} £4 million. The painted fence was replaced by an open wire fence in 2010, aiding visibility, but still denying public access {{to the base of the}} monument. Survey work in 2010 showed the extent of <b>cracks</b> <b>in</b> the stonework. In 2013 it was announced that further funding would be needed for the restoration project. Sensors recording the movement of the tower are also to be installed.|$|E
5|$|Maintenance of the Phantoms was {{undertaken}} by No.482 Squadron and No.3 Aircraft Depot, {{both of which}} were located at Amberley. In addition to routine servicing, these units modified the Phantoms' AN/APQ-120 radars during early 1971. In response to problems detected during maintenance, RAAF technical personnel checked all the aircraft for defects to their emergency flap system in September 1971 and used X-ray testing to detect any <b>cracks</b> <b>in</b> their stabilators during early 1972.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:Using BP Neural Network to {{optimize}} AE characteristic parameters of <b>crack</b> <b>in</b> drawing parts. By detecting the optimized characteristic parameters of <b>crack,</b> the <b>crack</b> <b>in</b> drawing parts are identified. According {{to the quality}} of drawing parts, the output of the network are crack signal and normal signal. Comparing the sensitivity of the input characteristic parameters on the output characteristic parameters, then pick the characteristic parameters which have bigger sensitivity values. Finally, the AE characteristic parameters such as Rise Time, AE Event Counter, Energy, Amplitude, Frequency Centroid can represent the signal of <b>crack</b> <b>in</b> the drawing parts better. These five characteristic parameters can identify the <b>crack</b> signal <b>in</b> the forming process of the drawing parts...|$|R

5|$|Meanwhile, in November 2004 {{engineers}} identified <b>cracks</b> <b>in</b> {{the terrace}} supporting the Memorial Gardens, {{and they were}} {{closed to the public}} as a potential hazard. Eventually in 2009 work began on renovating the gardens. Lutyens's memorial was dismantled and cleaned, and reassembled at a higher level to be visible from the street; it was also rotated 180° to face City Hall, rather than the market. The terrace was strengthened, and the gardens were landscaped around a new sculpture by Paul de Monchaux on the original site of the memorial.|$|E
5|$|On 7 November, {{engineers}} {{determined that}} there was no additional work needed to verify the solid rocket boosters for flight, following discovery of small <b>cracks</b> <b>in</b> the hold-down posts attached to boosters that had flown earlier that year. Close inspections of the STS-74 stack determined that no such cracks were present on the boosters to be used for the mission.|$|E
5|$|Recently the Canning Dam {{has been}} {{subjected}} to considerable cracking of the upper parts of the dam and upper gallery. Investigations have shown that cracking was due to strong AAR (alkali aggregate reactivity) in the concrete. AAR results in swelling of the concrete, which may cause secondary compressive stresses, localised map cracks, and, ultimately structural <b>cracks.</b> <b>In</b> addition, the concrete tensile strength and elasticity significantly decreases. Many old concrete dams are known to suffer from AAR, including Fontana Dam in Tennessee and Pian Telessio dam in Italy among others.|$|E

5|$|The Duck End {{was one of}} {{the poorer}} districts of Aylesbury. Until the end of the 19thcentury it had no sewers or refuse collections. The area had a number of open ditches filled with {{stagnant}} water, and outbreaks of malaria and cholera were common. The cottages had inadequate ventilation and lighting, and no running water. Faeces from the duck ponds permeated the local soil and seeped into the cottages through <b>cracks</b> <b>in</b> the floors.|$|E
5|$|The house stood empty {{until the}} Manhattan Project support {{personnel}} arrived in early 1945. The northeast room (the master bedroom) was designated the assembly room. Workbenches and tables were installed. To keep dust and sand out of instruments and tools, {{the windows were}} covered with plastic. Tape was used to fasten {{the edges of the}} plastic and to seal doors and <b>cracks</b> <b>in</b> the walls.|$|E
5|$|The variable-quality cement {{which had}} been used in the {{construction}} of the Causeway bridges meant that by the early 2000s, they had suffered significant damage, leading to a repair contract being awarded to Kulin Group in 2004. Localised patching of <b>cracks</b> <b>in</b> the piers was undertaken. At the ends of the piers, the cracking was more substantial and had to be tied back with carbon fibre reinforcement. Repairs were then coated with moisture-resistant coating, and were expected to lengthen the life of the bridges by decades.|$|E

5|$|Wastewater {{networks}} may sustain damage {{similar to}} water supply networks. It {{is very difficult}} to exclude ash from the sewerage system. Systems with combined storm water/sewer lines are most at risk.

5|$|AMI Stadium was {{significantly}} damaged during the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake, with <b>cracks</b> <b>in</b> some stands and the playing surface badly damaged by liquefaction {{as well as}} damage to infrastructure and streets surrounding the venue. As {{a result of the}} damage all scheduled 2011 World Cup games to be held in Christchurch were moved to other regions. test rugby returned to Christchurch in 2012 at Rugby League Park. Although the stands at that venue were damaged severely enough that they had to be torn down, infrastructure damage was much less severe than at AMI Stadium, and the playing surface survived relatively intact. The stadium was rebuilt with a permanent capacity of 17,000, with temporary seating allowing for 9,000 more spectators.|$|E
5|$|Continued poor weather drove New Carissa {{closer to}} the shore. Technical teams from two salvage contractors, Smit International and Salvage Master, had {{been working with the}} Coast Guard since February 5 and had drawn up plans to attempt to refloat the vessel, but when <b>cracks</b> <b>in</b> the hull and oil leaks were {{observed}} on February 8, any refloating attempts were precluded by the focus on preventing of a large-scale oil spill. In addition, Salvage Chief, upon her arrival, was unable to reach New Carissa with her tow gear. On February 10, New Carissa suffered major structural failure when the hull breached near the engine room, flooding the engines with seawater (and thus disabling them). The ship's insurers declared the vessel to be a total loss. As a result, New Carissa was no longer a salvageable vessel; instead, she had effectively become a shipwreck.|$|E
