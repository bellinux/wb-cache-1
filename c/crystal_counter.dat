30|$|The {{time control}} is an {{important}} issue for observations. In particular, the sampling timing of the magnetic field is strictly managed with less than 0.1  ms error. The three A/D converters for three axes sample analog signals from the magnetometer at the same timing in parallel and hold them in registers until they are processed. The CPU keeps internal clock time by signals from the <b>crystal</b> oscillator <b>counter,</b> and it controls sampling timing for the sensors. The internal clock time is corrected by synchronizing with 1 PPS signals from the GPS board with its accuracy of less than 0.1  ms, and the time difference before and after the correction is also recorded in the memory. The corrections are conducted before and after every seafloor observation to estimate and correct clock drifts in the entire operation period. The <b>crystal</b> oscillator <b>counter</b> has an additional button battery on the control board to keep the counter survived in case the primary battery power is lost during operations. Even if it would happen, the CPU could automatically recover the internal clock time using the surviving counter when power is supplied again.|$|R

In all cases isotypy with the La 3 Al 11 -type has been confirmed from X-ray powder data. The homogeneity region of the Yb 3 AgxGa 11 -x phase has been established by X-ray powder diffraction analysis and ranges at 600 °C from x = 2. 6 to x = 3. 8. Unit cell parameters in this region reveal a remarkable positive deviation from Vegard's rule corresponding with a partial composition-dependent atomic ordering in the various sites of the La 3 Al 11 -type structure. The occupation mode in the Yb-containing alloys has been studied in detail by full profile X-ray powder analysis for compositions x = 2. 55 and 3. 65 and by X-ray single <b>crystal</b> <b>counter</b> data refinement for the alloy with x = 3. 0, confirming in all cases full consistency with the La 3 Al 11 -type structure with the space group Immm. Throughout the homogeneous range Ag was observed to preferentially occupy the (2 c) sites. The relative increase of the Ag occupancy in (2 c) with increasing content of silver, however, decreases and for compositions x > 3. 0, Ag was found to enter the (81) positions. In correspondence with magnetic susceptibility measurements the peculiar lattice parameter variation observed is due to this complicated mode of Ga/Ag-substitution rather than to a valence change on the ytterbium atom. Magnetic susceptibilities were determined over a temperature range from 4 to 550 K. Above LNT, magnetic behavior of Gd (x = 2. 8), Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, and Tm compounds (x = 3. 8) corresponds to the paramagnetism of ideal tripositive rare earth elements.

Very few applications existed for caesium until the 1920s, when it came into use in radio vacuum tubes, where it had two functions; as a getter, it removed excess oxygen after manufacture, and as a coating on the heated cathode, it increased the electrical conductivity. Caesium was not recognized as a high-performance industrial metal until the 1950s.

40|$|With the {{advancement}} of descriptive cytology brought about by electron microscopy, there has arisen a need for cytochemical methods at high resolution. The method of x-ray scanning microanalysis has already found numerous applications {{in the field of}} metallography (1 - 3), and may also be extended to the study of biological specimens. Recently, Yasuzumi et al. (4) have succeeded in showing an Fe K, ~ spectrum in human erythrocytes, and Boyde et al. (5) in taking images formed by Ca K ~ and Fe K ~ radiations in dental tissue. The method is based upon the principle of x-ray emission spectrography. A very finely focused beam of electrons is projected onto the surface of a specimen, at the point where it is desired to examine its chemical composition. The minute volume of the specimen which is thus irradiated emits a complex x-ray spectrum consisting principally of the characteristic radiations of the elements present in the volume. Measurement of the wavelength and intensity of each component of this spectrum thus affords a simple method of determining the chemical identity and concentration of these elements. The apparatus itself consists of three main parts: an electron optical system, an x-ray spectrograph, and an optical microscope. The specimen is prepared in the usual way as for optical microscopy. The x-radiation, emitted at the focal spot where the electrons strike the specimen, is analyzed with a curved <b>crystal,</b> Geiger-Mtiller <b>counter,</b> and vacuum spectrograph.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{evaluated}} {{the potential of}} counter current spray drying to produce engineered crystalline particles in-situ. One main feature of the counter current spray dryer is in inducing droplet drying history with a progressively increasing drying rate; {{in contrast to a}} co-current spray dryer in which the particle is immediately confronted with high driving force of evaporation. In addition, counter current dryer provides higher residence time for particles within the drying chamber. This work explored the manipulation of these unique features of counter current spray drying to control the crystallinity of the particles formed. Sucrose, lactose and mannitol were spray dried as model materials exhibit contrasting crystallization. Counter current spray drying was suitable in producing well defined crystalline lactose particles mainly due to the higher residence time. The produced lactose particles were composed of agglomeration of fine thin lactose <b>crystals.</b> Surprisingly, the <b>counter</b> current spray drying with relatively lower initial evaporation rate resulted in amorphous mannitol particles. Fully crystalline mannitol was produced when the feed spray temperature was elevated leading to rapid supersaturation. This may be an important strategy to control the crystallinity of mannitol particles particularly for pharmaceutical application. Similar feed pre-heating strategy in conjunction with counter current spray drying was used for sucrose drying. Crystalline sucrose was achieved with relatively lower drying temperature. This will be a valuable strategy for producing free flowing sucrose particles specifically for the food industry...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{recently}} observed that coupling Viedma ripening with a seeded in situ metastable racemic crystal to conglomerate transformation leads to accelerated and complete deracemization: crystal transformation-enhanced deracemization. By {{means of a}} simple kinetic model, we show that the mechanistic pathway of this new process depends profoundly on the interplay between the crystal transformation and racemization processes, which in turn influence the nucleation process of the counter enantiomer. If the nucleation of the counter enantiomer is suppressed (e. g., by sufficiently fast racemization, low amount of racemic compound or gradual feed, low relative solubility between racemic compound and conglomerate), deracemization proceeds via a second order asymmetric transformation (SOAT) and is limited primarily by the dissolution rate of the racemic crystals and {{the growth rate of}} the preferred enantiomer crystals. Breakage and agglomeration accelerate the process, but contrary to conventional Viedma ripening, they are not essential ingredients to explain the observed enantiomeric enrichment. If the nucleation process of the counter enantiomer is not sufficiently suppressed, deracemization is initially controlled by the dissolution rate of the racemic crystals, but Viedma ripening is subsequently required to convert the conglomerate <b>crystals</b> of the <b>counter</b> enantiomer formed by nucleation, resulting in slower deracemization kinetics. In both cases, the combined process leads to faster deracemization kinetics compared to conventional Viedma ripening, while it autocorrects for the main disadvantage of SOAT, i. e., the accidental nucleation of the counter enantiomer. In addition, crystal transformation-enhanced deracemization extends the range of applicability of solid-state deracemization processes to compounds that form metastable racemic crystals...|$|R
