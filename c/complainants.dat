5|$|The Christians {{responded to}} these {{actions of the}} central {{government}} with a fresh wave of fury against the Jews so that in late May violence was in the air. The Jews described many cases in which they were assaulted or beaten by the Greeks, and the sons of the British and the Greek consuls were among those who beat up a number of Jews. When the Jews complained to the governor, he ordered the <b>complainants</b> subjected to four to five hundred blows of the bastinado. The qadi disassociated himself from the actions of the governor, who declared that he had acted upon the demands of the consuls. On top of that, the governor ordered five other Jews arrested.|$|E
25|$|The {{loans from}} Chiang {{were to be}} repaid with the {{proceeds}} {{from the sale of}} the flat. Following this, Mislia asked for two more loans from Chiang, which Shankar helped to arrange. In total, she signed three agreements to borrow a sum of $88,500, consisting of $45,000, $30,000 and $13,500 on three separate occasions. However, Mislia claimed she only received $40,000, consisting of $25,000, $10,000 and $5,000 on each of the occasions. Four years later, the <b>complainants</b> lodged a complaint against Shankar with the Law Society of Singapore. Following an investigation, Shankar was tried by the Disciplinary Committee of the Law Society and convicted of three counts of grossly improper conduct contrary to section 83(2)(b) of the Legal Profession Act. The charges were based on allegations that Shankar had acted for both the <b>complainants</b> and Chiang without advising the <b>complainants</b> of the consequences of this conflict of interest, that he had not taken full instructions from the <b>complainants,</b> that he had asked the <b>complainants</b> to sign documents without properly explaining their effect, and that he had not ascertained whether the sums of money that Chiang paid to Mislia were in line with the loan agreements.|$|E

5000|$|The appellant, John Sansregret and the <b>complainant</b> lived together. Their {{relationship}} {{had been one}} of contention and discord with violence {{on the part of the}} appellant: [...] "slappings" [...] or [...] "roughing up" [...] in his description, [...] "blows" [...] in hers. On September 23, 1982, the <b>complainant</b> decided to end their relationship. A few days later the appellant became furious and attacked the <b>complainant</b> with a file-like object. The <b>complainant</b> managed to calm him down by holding out hope of some sort of reconciliation and engaging in intercourse with the appellant. The <b>complainant</b> reported the incident to the police, but no charges were laid. On October 15, 1982, the appellant again broke into the <b>complainant's</b> house. The appellant picked up a butcher knife and entered the <b>complainant's</b> bedroom. The <b>complainant,</b> fearful for her life, again tried to calm down the appellant by pretending that there was some hope of reconciliation. They engaged in intercourse shortly later, but the <b>complainant</b> stated that she engaged in intercourse only to prevent further violence by the appellant. She later filed charges against the appellant for rape.|$|R
25|$|The <b>complainants,</b> Abdul Malik bin Sukor, an undischarged bankrupt, and his wife, Mislia binte Yusof, {{wished to}} sell their Housing and Development Board flat in Woodlands. They sought {{the help of a}} real estate agent named Rudolph Khoo, who {{informed}} them that Malik would have to be discharged from his bankruptcy before they could sell their flat. Khoo offered to help the <b>complainants</b> obtain a loan of S$25,000, to be repaid upon the sale of the flat. To facilitate these procedures, Khoo introduced a lawyer, Alan Shankar s/o (son of) Anant Kulkarni, to the <b>complainants,</b> who was to assist them in applying for a discharge from bankruptcy on Malik's behalf, acting for them in the sale of their flat, and documenting several loans that they had procured from one Chiang Bin Kwang.|$|E
25|$|Notably, while every {{witness to}} the Commission gave {{evidence}} of frequent corporal punishment, applied contrary to the regulations and therefore criminally, no Church witness came forward to certify a single such case. Difficulties arose where <b>complainants</b> or the accused were involved in parallel criminal or civil cases, such as the vaccine trials performed on inmate children. With such divergent views the CICA's task has been difficult and contentious, but it has agreed with the evidence given by the <b>complainants.</b> Given Mr. Ahern's general apology in 1999, {{it would be hard}} to conclude otherwise.|$|E

25|$|During the Disciplinary Committee hearing, Mislia had {{testified that}} Chiang had issued her cheques {{for the first}} two loans, but that they had gone to Chiang's bank where he had cashed the cheques and then given her only part of the face value of the cheques. To counter this evidence, Shankar had called two bank {{employees}} as witnesses. He claimed that the Disciplinary Committee had questioned the bank witnesses more aggressively than the <b>complainants</b> or Shankar himself, and had essentially cross-examined the witnesses to induce them to make certain factual concessions which weakened Shankar's case.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the first}} {{measures}} of the Long Parliament was to reform the clergy; with this view, a committee was appointed to receive complaints against them. Among the <b>complainants</b> were the inhabitants of Kidderminster. The vicar George Dance agreed that he would give £60 a year, out of his income of £200, to a preacher who should be chosen by certain trustees. Baxter was invited to deliver a sermon before the people, and was unanimously elected as the minister of St Mary and All Saints' Church, Kidderminster. This happened in April 1641, when he was twenty-six.|$|E

25|$|School of the Art Institute of Chicago student David Nelson created Mirth & Girth, a {{painting}} that depicted Washington wearing women's lingerie and holding a pencil, which was briefly displayed in a hallway at the school on May 11, 1988.

Nelson, assisted by the ACLU, subsequently filed a federal lawsuit against the city, claiming that the painting's confiscation and subsequent damaging violated his First Amendment rights. The <b>complainants</b> eventually split a US$95,000 (1994, US$138,000 in 2008) settlement from the city.|$|E

Defendant Wootton argued that the IWW members were such a threat to public safety that necessity demanded their removal. The jury agreed, making this one of the rare times in American law in which the necessity defense was successfully used. After this failure at law, nearly all the remaining civil suits were dropped (although a handful were settled for small sums of money).|$|E
