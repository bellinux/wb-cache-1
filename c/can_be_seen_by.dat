5|$|The {{most likely}} {{cause of the}} distortions of the spiral pattern {{is thought to be}} {{interaction}} with galaxy satellites M32 and M110. This <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> the displacement of the neutral hydrogen clouds from the stars.|$|E
5|$|Man Meets the Sea (Mennesket ved Havet) is a {{monument}} of four 9-metre-tall (27feet) white-coloured men located {{to the west}} of Esbjerg, overlooking Sædding Beach. One of the area's major tourist attractions, the sculpture was designed by Svend Wiig Hansen and installed on 28 October 1995. It was funded by the Esbjerg Municipality authorities, the Kunstfond arts foundation and private sponsors to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the municipality in 1994. The monument <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> ferry leaving or entering Esbjerg.|$|E

5|$|Much {{uncertainty}} remains, especially {{regarding the}} size of limitanei regiments, as <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> the wide ranges of the size estimates. It is also possible, if not likely, that unit strengths changed {{over the course of}} the 4th century. For example, it appears that Valentinian I split about 150 comitatus units with his brother and co-emperor Valens. The resulting units may have been just half the strength of the parent units (unless a major recruitment drive was held to bring them all up to original strength).|$|E
5|$|The {{extent of}} the Illawarra Steam Navigation Company's {{operations}} along the coast <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> their 1870 schedule, {{in which they were}} making the journey to Kiama, Shoalhaven and Gerringong every three days, and to Ulladulla, Clyde, Shoalhaven and Wollongong at about the same rate. Mourya was visited every two weeks, while an additional journey was made to Merimbula and Ulladulla once a week. 1873 saw a simplification of these services, and a weekly run to Merimbula, Eden and Tathra was amongst the changes.|$|E
5|$|Transformation {{into human}} form {{is said to}} be rare, and usually occurs at night. The encantado will often be seen running from a festa, despite protests from the others for it to stay, and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> pursuers as it hurries to the river and reverts to dolphin form. When it is under human form, it wears a hat to hide its blowhole, which does not {{disappear}} with the shapeshift.|$|E

5|$|Among the city's major {{industries}} are shipbuilding, military, and aerospace. Newport News Shipbuilding, owned by Huntington Ingalls Industries, {{and the large}} coal piers supplied by railroad giant CSX Transportation, the modern Fortune 500 successor to the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C). Miles of the waterfront <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> automobiles crossing the James River Bridge and Monitor-Merrimac Memorial Bridge-Tunnel, which is {{a portion of the}} circumferential Hampton Roads Beltway, linking the city with each of the other major cities of Hampton Roads via Interstate 664 and Interstate 64. Many U.S. defensive industry suppliers are based in Newport News, and these and nearby military bases employ many residents, in addition to those working at the shipyard and in other harbor-related vocations.|$|E
5|$|Another {{factor that}} can also {{contribute}} to the self-stability of traditional bike designs is the distribution of mass in the steering mechanism, which includes the front wheel, the fork, and the handlebar. If the center of mass for the steering mechanism is in front of the steering axis, then the pull of gravity will also cause the front wheel to steer {{in the direction of a}} lean. This <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> leaning a stationary bike to one side. The front wheel will usually also steer to that side independent of any interaction with the ground. Additional parameters, such as the fore-to-aft position of the center of mass and the elevation of the center of mass {{also contribute to the}} dynamic behavior of a bike.|$|E
5|$|Early on, manning {{a castle}} was a feudal duty of vassals to their magnates, and magnates to their kings, however this was later {{replaced}} with paid forces. A garrison was usually commanded by a constable whose peace-time role {{would have been}} looking after the castle in the owner's absence. Under him would have been knights who by benefit of their military training would have acted {{as a type of}} officer class. Below them were archers and bowmen, whose role was to prevent the enemy reaching the walls as <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> the positioning of arrowslits.|$|E

This <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>see</b> <b>by</b> stretching a cube on its body-digonal axis. For example, a regular octahedron with two tetrahedra attached on opposite faces constructs a 60 degree trigonal trapezohedron:.|$|R

5|$|The tomb of Ramesses IX, KV6, {{has been}} open since antiquity, as <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> the {{graffiti}} left on its walls by Roman and Coptic visitors. Located {{in the central}} part of the valley, it is between and slightly above KV5 and KV55. The tomb extends a total distance of 105 metres into the hillside, including extensive side chambers that were neither decorated nor finished. The hasty and incomplete nature of the rock-cutting and decorations (it is only decorated for a little over half its length) within the tomb indicate that the tomb was not completed by the time of Ramesses' death, with the completed hall of pillars serving as the burial chamber.|$|E
5|$|After {{many years}} of decline, the Sheffield economy {{is going through a}} strong revival. The 2004 Barclays Bank Financial Planning study {{revealed}} that, in 2003, the Sheffield district of Hallam was the highest ranking area outside London for overall wealth, the proportion of people earning over £60,000 a year standing at almost 12%. A survey by Knight Frank revealed that Sheffield was the fastest-growing city outside London for office and residential space and rents {{during the second half of}} 2004. This <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> the current surge of redevelopments, including the City Lofts Tower and accompanying St Paul's Place, Velocity Living and the Moor redevelopment, the forthcoming NRQ and the recently completed Winter Gardens, Peace Gardens, Millennium Galleries and many projects under the Sheffield One redevelopment agency. The Sheffield economy grew from £5.6billion in 1997 (1997 GVA) to £9.2billion in 2007 (2007 GVA).|$|E
5|$|However, many {{traits that}} appear to be simple adaptations are in fact exaptations: {{structures}} originally adapted for one function, but which coincidentally became somewhat useful for some other function in the process. One example is the African lizard Holaspis guentheri, which developed an extremely flat head for hiding in crevices, as <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> looking at its near relatives. However, in this species, the head has become so flattened that it assists in gliding from tree to tree—an exaptation. Within cells, molecular machines such as the bacterial flagella and protein sorting machinery evolved by the recruitment of several pre-existing proteins that previously had different functions. Another example is the recruitment of enzymes from glycolysis and xenobiotic metabolism to serve as structural proteins called crystallins within the lenses of organisms' eyes.|$|E

5|$|More recent historians, such as Michael Hicks and A. J. Pollard, {{have tried}} to see Warwick {{in light of the}} {{standards}} of his own age, rather than holding him up to contemporary constitutional ideals. The insults Warwick suffered at the hands of King Edward – including Edward's secret marriage, and the refusal of the French diplomatic channel – were significant. His claim to prominence in national affairs was not a product of illusions of grandeur; it was confirmed by the high standing he enjoyed among the princes on the continent. Furthermore, Warwick's cause was not considered unjust by his contemporaries, which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> the earl's popularity exceeding that of the king {{at the time of his}} first rebellion in 1469. On the other hand, while Warwick could not easily suffer his treatment by the king, it was equally impossible for Edward to accept the earl's presence on the political scene. As long as Warwick remained as powerful and influential as he was, Edward could not fully assert his royal authority, and eventual confrontation became inevitable.|$|E
5|$|Since 1879, {{more than}} 300 Victoria Crosses have been {{publicly}} auctioned or advertised. Others have been privately sold. The {{value of the}} VC <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> the increasing sums that the medals reach at auction. In 1955 the set of medals awarded to Edmund Barron Hartley was bought at Sotheby's for the then record price of £300 (approximately £ in present-day terms). In October 1966 the Middlesex Regiment paid a new record figure of £900 (approximately £ in present-day terms) for a VC awarded after the Battle of the Somme. In January 1969, the record reached £1700 (£) for the medal set of William Rennie. In April 2004 the VC awarded in 1944 to Sergeant Norman Jackson, RAF, was sold at auction for £235,250. On 24 July 2006, an auction at Bonhams in Sydney of the VC awarded to Captain Alfred Shout fetched a world record hammer price of A$1 million (approximately £410,000 at then exchange rates).|$|E
