5|$|The Italian {{composer}} Claudio Monteverdi (1567–1643), {{in addition}} to a large output of church music and madrigals, wrote prolifically for the stage. His theatrical works were written between 1604 and 1643 and included ten operas, of which three—L'Orfeo (1607), Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria (1640) and L'incoronazione di Poppea (1643)—have survived with their music and librettos intact. In the case of the other seven operas, the music has disappeared almost entirely, although some of the librettos exist. The loss of these works, written during a <b>critical</b> <b>period</b> of early opera history, has been much regretted by commentators and musicologists.|$|E
5|$|Calvinism gained many {{followers}} {{in the mid}} 16th century {{among both}} the szlachta and the magnates, especially in Lesser Poland and Lithuania. The Calvinists, who led by Jan Łaski were working on unification of the Protestant churches, proposed {{the establishment of a}} Polish national church, under which all Christian denominations, including Eastern Orthodox (very numerous in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Ukraine), would be united. After 1555 Sigismund II, who accepted their ideas, sent an envoy to the pope, but the papacy rejected the various Calvinist postulates. Łaski and several other Calvinist scholars published in 1563 the Bible of Brest, a complete Polish Bible translation from the original languages, an undertaking financed by Mikołaj Radziwiłł the Black. After 1563–1565 (the abolishment of state enforcement of the Church jurisdiction), full religious tolerance became the norm. The Polish Catholic Church emerged from this <b>critical</b> <b>period</b> weakened but not badly damaged (the bulk of the Church property was preserved), which facilitated the later success of Counter-Reformation.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{types of}} {{learning}} are possible, respective to each applicable type of learning, only within a limited age range {{known as a}} <b>critical</b> <b>period.</b> Bowlby's concepts included the idea that attachment involved learning from experience during a limited age period, influenced by adult behaviour. He did not apply the imprinting concept in its entirety to human attachment. However, he considered that attachment behaviour was best explained as instinctive, combined with the effect of experience, stressing the readiness the child brings to social interactions. Over time it became apparent there were more differences than similarities between attachment theory and imprinting so the analogy was dropped.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we discuss {{bifurcation}} of <b>critical</b> <b>periods</b> in an m-th degree time-reversible system, which is a perturbation of an n-th degree homogeneous vector field with a rigidly isochronous center at the origin. We present period-bifurcation functions as integrals of analytic functions which depend on perturbation coefficients and reduce the problem of <b>critical</b> <b>periods</b> to finding zeros of a judging function. This procedure gives not only the number of <b>critical</b> <b>periods</b> bifurcating from the period annulus but also the location of these <b>critical</b> <b>periods.</b> Applying our procedure to the case n=m= 2 we determine {{the maximum number of}} <b>critical</b> <b>periods</b> and their location; to the case n=m= 3 we investigate the bifurcation of <b>critical</b> <b>periods</b> up to the first order in ε and obtain the expression of the second period-bifurcation function when the first one vanishes...|$|R

5|$|The 1st and 2nd Light Horse Brigades {{first made}} contact with the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade by heliograph, after which Royston, {{commanding}} the 2nd Light Horse Brigade, galloped across to explain the situation. Chaytor then moved the Auckland and Canterbury Mounted Rifles Regiments, supported by the Somerset Battery, onto high ground between {{the right of the}} light horse and the Yeomanry, which was shortly afterwards joined by the remainder of the 5th Mounted Brigade under the command of Brigadier General Wiggin. At the most <b>critical</b> <b>period</b> of the day's fighting, when the German and Ottoman force of 2,000 dominated the Romani area from Mount Royston, the five mounted brigades (still less the 5th Light Horse Regiment) began their counterattack at 14:00 from the west towards Mount Royston.|$|E
5|$|The most <b>critical</b> <b>period</b> of the {{fighting}} in the east occurred when the NK 15th Division broke through the ROK 8th Division to Yongch'on. The North Korean division attempted to turn east and southeast and take Task Force Jackson in the rear or on its left flank. But Walker's quick dispatch of the ROK 5th and 11th Regiments from two widely separated sectors of the front {{to the area of}} penetration resulted in destroying the force before it could exploit its breakthrough. Walker was commended for his judgment of the reinforcements needed to stem the North Korean attacks in the Kyongju and Yongch'on areas.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} the amphibious {{landings}} depended on {{the establishment of a}} secure lodgement from which to expand the beachhead to allow the buildup of a well-supplied force capable of breaking out. The amphibious forces were especially vulnerable to strong enemy counter-attacks before the arrival of sufficient forces in the beachhead could be accomplished. To slow or eliminate the enemy's ability to organise and launch counter-attacks during this <b>critical</b> <b>period,</b> airborne operations were used to seize key objectives such as bridges, road crossings, and terrain features, particularly on the eastern and western flanks of the landing areas. The airborne landings some distance behind the beaches were also intended to ease the egress of the amphibious forces off the beaches, and in some cases to neutralise German coastal defence batteries and more quickly expand the area of the beachhead.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we study {{the number of}} {{critical}} points that the period function of a center of a classical Liénard equation can have. Centers of classical Liénard equations are related to scalar differential equations x¨+x+f(x) x˙= 0, with f an odd polynomial, let us say of degree 2 ℓ− 1. We show {{that the existence of}} a finite upperbound on the number of <b>critical</b> <b>periods,</b> only depending on the value of ℓ, can be reduced to the study of slow–fast Liénard equations close to their limiting layer equations. We show that near the central system of degree 2 ℓ− 1 the number of <b>critical</b> <b>periods</b> is at most 2 ℓ− 2. We show the occurrence of slow–fast Liénard systems exhibiting 2 ℓ− 2 <b>critical</b> <b>periods,</b> elucidating a qualitative process behind the occurrence of <b>critical</b> <b>periods.</b> It all provides evidence for conjecturing that 2 ℓ− 2 is a sharp upperbound on the number of <b>critical</b> <b>periods.</b> We also show that the number of <b>critical</b> <b>periods,</b> multiplicity taken into account, is always even...|$|R

5|$|From 20 January 1943, the Partisans {{had been}} hard-pressed by the Axis Case White offensive. Throughout that offensive, Partisan Supreme Headquarters engaged the Germans in {{negotiations}} to gain time {{to cross the}} Neretva river. In late February or early March 1943, the Partisans captured a German officer and about 25 soldiers, who joined about 100 Croatian Home Guards, and 15 Italian officers and 600 soldiers already being held as prisoners of war by the Partisans. Due to their desperate situation {{at this stage of}} Case White, and their need to delay the Axis in order to cross the Neretva river before the Germans struck, they decided to use the recently captured German officer to initiate negotiations. The German historians Ladislaus Hory and Martin Broszat concluded that at this <b>critical</b> <b>period,</b> Tito was also concerned {{that by the end of}} the war the attrition to his Partisan forces would be such that Mihailović's Chetniks would be more powerful. They suggest that Tito may have been willing to agree to a truce with the Germans in order to destroy the Chetniks.|$|E
5|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and intrepidity at {{the risk}} of his life above and {{beyond the call of duty}} while serving as Leader of a Machine-gun Section of Company B, First Battalion, Twenty-Third Marines, Fourth Marine Division, in action against enemy Japanese forces during the assault on Iwo Jima in the Volcano Islands, 19 February 1945. Assailed by a tremendous volume of small-arms, mortar and artillery fire as he advanced with one squad of his section in the initial assault wave, Sergeant Cole boldly led his men up the sloping beach toward Airfield Number One despite the blanketing curtain of flying shrapnel and, personally destroying with hand grenades two hostile emplacements which menaced the progress of his unit, continued to move forward until a merciless barrage of fire emanating from three Japanese pillboxes halted the advance. Instantly placing his one remaining machine gun in action, he delivered a shattering fusillade and succeeded in silencing the nearest and most threatening emplacement before his weapon jammed and the enemy, reopening fire with knee mortars and grenades, pinned down his unit for the second time. Shrewdly gauging the tactical situation and evolving a daring plan of counterattack, Sergeant Cole, armed solely with a pistol and one grenade, coolly advanced alone to the hostile pillboxes. Hurling his one grenade at the enemy in sudden, swift attack, he quickly withdrew, returned to his own lines for additional grenades and again advanced, attacked, and withdrew. With enemy guns still active, he ran the gauntlet of slashing fire a third time to complete the total destruction of the Japanese strong point and the annihilation of the defending garrison in this final assault. Although instantly killed by an enemy grenade as he returned to his squad, Sergeant Cole had eliminated a formidable Japanese position, thereby enabling his company to storm the remaining fortifications, continue the advance and seize the objective. By his dauntless initiative, unfaltering courage and indomitable determination during a <b>critical</b> <b>period</b> of action, Sergeant Cole served as an inspiration to his comrades, and his stouthearted leadership in the face of almost certain death sustained and enhanced the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service. He gallantly gave his life for his country.|$|E
5|$|For {{extraordinary}} heroism {{while serving}} as a Leader of a Machine-Gun Section, Company C, 1st Battalion, 27th Marines, 5th Marine Division, in action against enemy Japanese forces on Iwo Jima in the Volcano Islands, 19 February 1945. Shrewdly gauging the tactical situation shortly after landing when his company's advance was held up by the concentrated fire of a heavily fortified Japanese blockhouse, Gunnery Sergeant BASILONE boldly defied the smashing bombardment of heavy caliber fire to work {{his way around the}} flank and up to a position directly on top of the blockhouse and then, attacking with grenades and demolitions, single handedly destroyed the entire hostile strong point and its defending garrison. Consistently daring and aggressive as he fought his way over the battle-torn beach and up the sloping, gun-studded terraces toward Airfield Number 1, he repeatedly exposed himself to the blasting fury of exploding shells and later in the day coolly proceeded to the aid of a friendly tank which had been trapped in an enemy mine field under intense mortar and artillery barrages, skillfully guiding the heavy vehicle over the hazardous terrain to safety, despite the overwhelming volume of hostile fire. In the forefront of the assault at all times, he pushed forward with dauntless courage and iron determination until, moving upon the edge of the airfield, he fell, instantly killed by a bursting mortar shell. Stouthearted and indomitable, Gunnery Sergeant BASILONE, by his intrepid initiative, outstanding skill, and valiant spirit of self-sacrifice {{in the face of the}} fanatic opposition, contributed materially to the advance of his company during the early <b>critical</b> <b>period</b> of the assault, and his unwavering devotion to duty throughout the bitter conflict was an inspiration to his comrades and reflects the highest credit upon Gunnery Sergeant BASILONE and the United States Naval Service. He gallantly gave his life in the service of his country.|$|E

Since Genie never fully acquired grammar, Curtiss submitted that Genie provided evidence for a weaker variation of the <b>critical</b> <b>period</b> hypothesis. Genie's nonverbal skills were exceptionally good, which demonstrated that even nonverbal communication was fundamentally different from language.
