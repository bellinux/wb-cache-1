50|$|The <b>chalk-browed</b> <b>mockingbird</b> (Mimus saturninus) is a bird {{found in}} most of Brazil, and parts of Bolivia, Uruguay, Paraguay, Argentina, and Suriname. It's a bird of open wooded areas, {{including}} urban and suburban gardens. It feeds on fruits, insects and small vertebrates.|$|E
50|$|The {{bird species}} in the park {{sometimes}} {{have been known to}} feed in the Mexico City metropolitan area due to its proximity to the park. The main bird species observed in the park are: house sparrow, barn swallow, lark, <b>chalk-browed</b> <b>mockingbird,</b> woodpecker, blue jay, black vulture, and golden eagle.|$|E

40|$|The host-parasite {{interactions}} between <b>Chalk-browed</b> <b>Mockingbirds</b> (Mimus saturninus) and Shiny Cowbirds (Molothrus bonariensis) were studied around Villa María, Córdoba, Argentina, between 1979 - 1984. The incidence of parasitism was 81 / 92 or 88, 04 %. Mockingbirds {{in the study}} site accepted Cowbird eggs, even those of the immaculate morph, which are rejected in Buenos Aires. Incubation period for the host was 14 - 15 days, for the parasite 12 - 13 days, with nestling periods of 13 - 14 and 14 - 15 days respectively. Breeding season of host and parasite overlapped almost completety. In a better studied subsample of parasitized nests success for the host was 7, 70 % (ratio Fledglings//eggs of 3 / 39) and for the parasite 6, 45 % (2 / 31). Cowbirds punctured and removed host eggs. Mockingbirds were probably the best local hosts for the Cowbirds...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the costs}} to avian parents of rearing brood {{parasitic}} offspring, many species do not reject foreign eggs from their nests. We show that where multiple parasitism occurs, rejection itself can be costly, by increasing the risk of host egg loss during subsequent parasite attacks. <b>Chalk-browed</b> <b>mockingbirds</b> (Mimus saturninus) are heavily parasitized by shiny cowbirds (Molothrus bonariensis), which also puncture eggs in host nests. Mockingbirds struggle to prevent cowbirds puncturing and laying, but seldom remove cowbird eggs once laid. We filmed cowbird visits to nests with manipulated clutch compositions and found that mockingbird eggs {{were more likely to}} escape puncture the more cowbird eggs accompanied them in the clutch. A Monte Carlo simulation of this 'dilution effect', comparing virtual hosts that systematically either reject or accept parasite eggs, shows that acceptors enjoy higher egg survivorship than rejecters in host populations where multiple parasitism occurs. For mockingbirds or other hosts in which host nestlings fare well in parasitized broods, this benefit might be sufficient to offset the fitness cost of rearing parasite chicks, making egg acceptance evolutionarily stable. Thus, counterintuitively, high intensities of parasitism might decrease or even reverse selection pressure for host defence via egg rejection...|$|R
50|$|Alejo Castex is {{the only}} paved street and it is lined with tall trees and weekend-houses; only can be heard the bird songs of {{thousands}} of rufous-bellied thrushes, <b>chalk-browed</b> <b>mockingbirds,</b> rufous horneros and the far-away roar of tractors working on the farms.Veinte de Junio only counts with a general store, a kindergarten, and a primary and secondary public school; for almost everything the town depends from the nearby city of Pontevedra, in Merlo Partido.For many residents the isolation {{is the cause of}} the lack of development of the town; for many others it’s a blessing because the remoteness makes Veinte de Junio a safe place to live, a place where crime and delinquency are very rare.The town grew around a railway station built {{in the first decade of}} the 20th century by the French-owned company Compagnie Générale de Chemins de Fer dans la Province de Buenos Aires, 4 km from Pontevedra. In fact, by those days the station was known as Estación Pontevedra.The land around the station was urbanized forty years later, in 1947, and it was known as Parque Ibáñez-Estación Pontevedra, but its name changed in 1949 when the partidos boundaries of Merlo and La Matanza were established. The railway station was left within the jurisdiction of La Matanza, while Pontevedra then came within the jurisdiction of Merlo.|$|R
40|$|O sabiá-do-campo (Mimus saturninus) foi estudado em várias localidade do estado de São Paulo, entre agosto de 1993 e janeiro de 1986, sendo dada atenção à alimentação, reprodução, repertório vocal e reação frente a aves de outras espécies. A espécie é onívora e alimenta-se principalmente de insetos (grupos de maior importância: Isoptera, Coleoptera, Formicidae) e de frutos (principalmente silvestres, diâmetro {{inferior}} a 1 cm). À variada dieta corresponde ampla gama de técnicas de forrageiro (as mais utilizadas: ?captura no terreno, durante deslocamento? e ?captura de presas altas em vôo, partindo de poleiro?). A reprodução ocorre entre final de agosto e janeiro. São feitas até quatro posturas, com 3 ou 4 ovos cada. Ocorre a interferência de ?adjudantes? (?helpers?), indivíduos que não fazem parte do casal em reprodução, durante a construção da ninho e durante a alimentação de ninhegos e filhotes, mas não durante a incubação. [...] . Observação: O resumo, na íntegra, poderá ser visualizado no texto completo da tese digitalThe <b>Chalk-browed</b> <b>Mockingbird</b> (Mimus saturninus, Mimidae) was {{studied in}} some lacalites in the State of São Paulo (Brazil) from August 1983 to January 1986. special attention {{was paid to}} diet composition, feeding behaviour, potential as seed disperser, breeding biology, wing-flashing behaviour, vocal repertory and reaction to other species. M saturninus is omnivorous, feeding mainly on insects (most important groups: Isoptera, Coleoptera, Formicidae) and fruits (mainly wild, brightly coloured and with diameter inferior to 1 cm). The diet also includes, although infrequently, terrestrial Gastropoda, Oligochaeta, Araneida, nectar and flowers petals. To the varied diet corresponds a wide gamma of foraging technics. The most utilized for animal preys are ?capturing of preys on the ground during motion? and ?capturing of flying preys on wing, departing from perch?. Small to medium fruits are generally swallowed whole and the seeds eliminated via faeces. The species must be regarded as a potential seed disperser: 10 out of 19 seed species found in faeces were succesful in germinating. Reproduction occurs from late August to January. Nests are open cups constructed with twigs, sometimes thorny, and grass stalks, lined with thin rootlests and other fine materials, and are placed most frequently in shrubs, eventually in tress (average height of nest 1, 22 m). Up to 4 clutches are laid each season, with 3 ? 4 eggs each. Nestling remain in nest 13 ? 14 days and fledglings are still being feed by adults about one month after leaving the nest. Helpers often interfere during nest bulding and feeding of young, but not during icubation. ?Note: The complete abstract is available with the full electronic digital thesis or dissertation...|$|E
40|$|Obligate avian brood parasites show {{dramatic}} {{variation in}} {{the degree to which}} they are host specialists or host generalists. The screaming cowbird Molothrus rufoaxillaris is one of the most specialized brood parasites, using a single host, the bay-winged cowbird (Agelaioides badius) over most of its range. Coevolutionary theory predicts increasing host specificity the longer the parasite interacts with a particular avian community, as hosts evolve defences that the parasite cannot counteract. According to this view, host specificity can be maintained if screaming cowbirds avoid parasitizing potentially suitable hosts that have developed effective defences against parasitic females or eggs. Specialization may also be favoured, even in the absence of host defences, if the parasite's reproductive success in alternative hosts is lower than that in the main host. We experimentally tested these hypotheses using as alternative hosts two suitable but unparasitized species: house wrens (Troglodytes aedon) and <b>chalk-browed</b> <b>mockingbirds</b> (Mimus saturninus). We assessed host defences against parasitic females and eggs, and reproductive success of the parasite in current and alternative hosts. Alternative hosts did not discriminate against screaming cowbird females or eggs. Egg survival and hatching success were similarly high in current and alternative hosts, but the survival of parasitic chicks was significantly lower in alternative hosts. Our results indicate that screaming cowbirds have the potential to colonize novel hosts, but higher reproductive success in the current host may favour host fidelity...|$|R
