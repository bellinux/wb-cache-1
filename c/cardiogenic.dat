5|$|A special but unusual {{consideration}} is <b>cardiogenic</b> shock, where {{the blood pressure}} is decreased not due to dehydration but due to inability of the heart to pump blood through the blood vessels. This situation requires ICU admission, monitoring of the central venous pressure (which requires the insertion of a central venous catheter in a large upper body vein), and the administration of medication that increases the heart pumping action and blood pressure.|$|E
5|$|The heart {{derives from}} splanchnopleuric mesenchyme in the neural plate which forms the <b>cardiogenic</b> region. Two endocardial tubes form here that fuse {{to form a}} {{primitive}} heart tube known as the tubular heart. Between {{the third and fourth}} week, the heart tube lengthens, and begins to fold to form an S-shape within the pericardium. This places the chambers and major vessels into the correct alignment for the developed heart. Further development will include the septa and valves formation and remodelling of the heart chambers. By the end of the fifth week the septa are complete and the heart valves are completed by the ninth week.|$|E
5|$|Myocardial {{infarction}} (MI), {{commonly known}} as a heart attack, occurs when blood flow decreases or stops to {{a part of the}} heart, causing damage to the heart muscle. The most common symptom is chest pain or discomfort which may travel into the shoulder, arm, back, neck, or jaw. Often it occurs in the center or left side of the chest and lasts {{for more than a few}} minutes. The discomfort may occasionally feel like heartburn. Other symptoms may include shortness of breath, nausea, feeling faint, a cold sweat, or feeling tired. About 30% of people have atypical symptoms. Women more often have atypical symptoms than men. Among those over 75 years old, about 5% have had an MI with little or no history of symptoms. An MI may cause heart failure, an irregular heartbeat, <b>cardiogenic</b> shock, or cardiac arrest.|$|E
25|$|Myocardial {{infarction}} {{is associated}} {{with high levels of}} circulating epinephrine and norepinephrine, particularly in <b>cardiogenic</b> shock.|$|E
25|$|Sympathomimetics such as dopamine, dobutamine, nor{{epinephrine}}, and epinephrine {{used for}} severe hypotension (low blood pressure), <b>cardiogenic</b> shock and septicemia.|$|E
25|$|Thrombolytic {{drugs are}} {{contraindicated}} {{for the treatment}} of unstable angina and NSTEMI and {{for the treatment of}} individuals with evidence of <b>cardiogenic</b> shock.|$|E
25|$|In {{overdose}} propranolol {{is associated}} with seizures. Cardiac arrest may occur in propranolol overdose due to sudden ventricular arrhythmias, or <b>cardiogenic</b> shock which may ultimately culminate in bradycardic PEA. Therefore, propranolol should be used with extreme caution in depressed or atypically depressed patients with possible suicidal ideation.|$|E
25|$|From splanchnopleuric mesenchyme, the <b>cardiogenic</b> region {{develops}} cranially and laterally to {{the neural}} plate. In this area, two separate angiogenic cell clusters form {{on either side}} and coalesce to form the endocardial tubes. As embryonic folding continues, the two endocardial tubes are pushed into the thoracic cavity, where they begin to fuse together, and this is completed at about 22 days.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} markers used for risk {{stratification}} {{and these are}} also independent predictors of adverse outcome. These include hypotension, <b>cardiogenic</b> shock, syncope, evidence of right heart dysfunction, and elevated cardiac enzymes. Some ECG changes including S1Q3T3 also correlate with worse short-term prognosis. There have been other patient-related factors such as COPD and chronic heart failure thought to {{also play a role}} in prognosis.|$|E
25|$|On 6 August 2009, in Putrajaya another {{death was}} {{confirmed}} involving a 57-year-old pensioner {{who was a}} diabetic and suffered from hypertension. On 7 August 2009, a 40-year-old obese man who was admitted to Kuala Lumpur Hospital died of acute coronary syndrome and <b>cardiogenic</b> shock. The man was suffering from fever and had been coughing since 28 July 2009. His autopsy result confirmed {{that he is the}} nation's fifteen Influenza A(H1N1) death.|$|E
25|$|Individuals with WPW have an {{accessory}} pathway that communicates between the atria and the ventricles, {{in addition to}} the AV node. This accessory pathway is known as the bundle of Kent. This accessory pathway does not share the rate-slowing properties of the AV node, and may conduct electrical activity at a significantly higher rate than the AV node. For instance, in the example above, if an individual had an atrial rate of 300 beats per minute, the accessory bundle may conduct all the electrical impulses from the atria to the ventricles, causing the ventricles to contract at 300 beats per minute. Extremely rapid heart rates such as this may result in hemodynamic instability or <b>cardiogenic</b> shock. In some cases, the combination of {{an accessory}} pathway and abnormal heart rhythms can trigger ventricular fibrillation, a leading cause of sudden cardiac death.|$|E
25|$|The {{central part}} of <b>cardiogenic</b> area {{is in front of}} the oropharyngeal {{membrane}} and the neural plate. The growth of the brain and the cephalic folds push the oropharyngeal membrane forward, while the heart and the pericardial cavity move first to the cervical region and then into the chest. The curved portion of the horseshoe-shaped area expands to form the future ventricular infundibulum and the ventricular regions, as the heart tube continues to expand. The tube starts receiving venous drainage in its caudal pole and will pump blood out of the first aortic arch and into the dorsal aorta through its polar head. Initially the tube remains attached to the dorsal part of the pericardial cavity by a mesodermal tissue fold called the dorsal mesoderm. This mesoderm disappears to form the two pericardial sinuses the transverse and the oblique pericardial sinuses, which connect both sides of the pericardial cavity.|$|E
2500|$|Emergency {{bypass surgery}} for the {{treatment}} of an acute myocardial infarction (MI) is less common than PCI or thrombolysis. From 1995 to 2004, the percentage of people with <b>cardiogenic</b> shock treated with primary PCI rose from 27.4% to 54.4%, while the increase in coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) was only from 2.1% to 3.2%. [...] Emergency CABG is usually undertaken to simultaneously treat a mechanical complication, such as a ruptured papillary muscle, or a ventricular septal defect, with ensuing <b>cardiogenic</b> shock. In uncomplicated MI, the mortality rate can be high when the surgery is performed immediately following the infarction. If this option is entertained, the patient should be stabilized prior to surgery, with supportive interventions {{such as the use of}} an intra-aortic balloon pump. In patients developing <b>cardiogenic</b> shock after a myocardial infarction, both PCI and CABG are satisfactory treatment options, with similar survival rates.|$|E
2500|$|The {{symptoms}} {{associated with}} MI {{are dependent on}} which phase of the disease process the individual is in. [...] Individuals with acute MI are typically severely symptomatic and will have the {{signs and symptoms of}} acute decompensated congestive heart failure (i.e. shortness of breath, pulmonary edema, orthopnea, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea), as well as symptoms of <b>cardiogenic</b> shock (i.e., shortness of breath at rest). Cardiovascular collapse with shock (<b>cardiogenic</b> shock) may be seen in individuals with acute MI due to papillary muscle rupture, rupture of a chorda tendinea or infective endocarditis of the mitral valve.|$|E
2500|$|Bridge to {{decision}}: A {{decision will}} soon be made {{about what to do}} next (that is, which definitive therapy will come soon), but first the patient needs a bridge to support them until that decision; for example, short-term mechanical circulatory support as a bridge to durable left ventricular assist device implant in refractory <b>cardiogenic</b> shock.|$|E
2500|$|Flecainide {{intoxication}} is rare but serious {{due to the}} <b>cardiogenic</b> {{shock that}} it provokes. Its diagnosis can be difficult in the lack of contributing anamnestic elements. Clinical and paraclinical signs are not specific. Treatment is primarily symptomatic, which gives good results thanks to the hypertonic solution of sodium salts.Organ donation is possible {{in the case of}} braindead ...|$|E
2500|$|In the splanchnopleuric mesenchyme {{on either}} side of the neural plate, a horseshoe-shaped area {{develops}} as the <b>cardiogenic</b> region. This has formed from cardiac myoblasts [...] and blood islands as forerunners of blood cells and vessels. By day 19, an endocardial tube begins to develop in each side of this region. These two tubes grow and by the third week have converged towards each other to merge, using programmed cell death to form a single tube, the tubular heart.|$|E
2500|$|At around 18 to 19 {{days after}} fertilisation, the heart begins to form. This early {{development}} {{is critical for}} subsequent embryonic and prenatal development. The heart is the first functional organ to develop and starts to beat and pump blood at around day 21 or 22. The heart begins to develop near {{the head of the}} embryo in the <b>cardiogenic</b> area. Following cell signalling, two strands or cords begin to form in the <b>cardiogenic</b> [...] region As these form, a lumen develops within them, at which point, they are referred to as endocardial tubes. At {{the same time that the}} tubes are forming other major heart components are also being formed. The two tubes migrate together and fuse to form a single primitive heart tube, the tubular heart which quickly forms five distinct regions. From head to tail, these are the truncus arteriosus, bulbus cordis, primitive ventricle, primitive atrium, and the sinus venosus. Initially, all venous blood flows into the sinus venosus, and contractions propel the blood from tail to head, or from the sinus venosus to the truncus arteriosus. The truncus arteriosus will divide to form the aorta and pulmonary artery; the bulbus cordis will develop into the right ventricle; the primitive ventricle will form the left ventricle; the primitive atrium will become the front parts of the left and right atria and their appendages, and the sinus venous will develop into the posterior part of the right atrium, the sinoatrial node and the coronary sinus.|$|E
2500|$|The {{primitive}} ventricle acts as initial pacemaker. But this pacemaker {{activity is}} actually {{made by a}} group of cells that derive from the sinoatrial right venous sinus. These cells form an ovoid [...] sinoatrial node (SAN), on the left venous valve. After the development of the SAN, the superior endocardial cushions begin to form a pacemaker as known as the atrioventricular node. With the development of the SAN, a band of specialized conducting cells start to form creating the bundle of His that sends a branch to the right ventricle and one to the left ventricle. Most conduction pathways originate from the <b>cardiogenic</b> mesoderm but the sinus node may be derived from the neural crest.|$|E
2500|$|Paramedics in many jurisdictions {{administer}} {{a variety}} of emergency medications; the individual medications vary widely, based on physician (medical director) direction and local law. These drugs may include Adenocard (Adenosine), which stops and resets a heart that is beating too rapidly, and Atropine, which speeds a heartbeat that is too slow. [...] The list may include sympathomimetics like dopamine for severe hypotension (low blood pressure) and <b>cardiogenic</b> shock. Diabetics often benefit {{from the fact that}} paramedics are able to give D50W (Dextrose 50%) to treat hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). They can treat crisis and anxiety conditions. Some advanced paramedics may also be permitted to perform rapid sequence induction; a rapid way of obtaining an advanced airway with the use of paralytics and sedatives, using such medications as Versed, Ativan, or Etomidate, and paralytics such as succinylcholine, rocuronium, or vecuronium. Paramedics in some jurisdictions may also be permitted to sedate combative patients using antipsychotics like Haldol or Geodon. The use of medications for treating respiratory conditions such as, albuterol, atrovent, and methylprednisolone is common. Paramedics may also be permitted to administer medications such as those that relieve pain or decrease nausea and vomiting. Nitroglycerin, baby aspirin, and morphine sulfate may be administered for chest pain. Paramedics may also use other medications and antiarrhythmics like amiodarone to treat cardiac arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation not responding to defibrillation. Paramedics also treat for severe pain, i.e. burns or fractures, with narcotics like morphine sulfate, pethidine, fentanyl and in some jurisdictions, ketorolac. [...] This list is not representative of all jurisdictions, and EMS jurisdictions may vary greatly in what is permitted. Some jurisdictions may not permit administration of certain classes of drugs, or may use drugs other than the ones listed for the same purposes. For an accurate description of permitted drugs or procedures in a given location, it is necessary to contact that jurisdiction directly.|$|E
5000|$|While {{the data}} on {{performing}} interventions on individuals with <b>cardiogenic</b> shock is sparse, trial data suggests a long-term mortality benefit in undergoing revascularization if the individual is less than 75 years old and if {{the onset of the}} acute myocardial infarction is less than 36 hours and the onset of <b>cardiogenic</b> shock is less than 18 hours. [...] If the patient with <b>cardiogenic</b> shock {{is not going to be}} revascularized, aggressive hemodynamic support is warranted, with insertion of an intra-aortic balloon pump if not contraindicated. [...] If diagnostic coronary angiography does not reveal a culprit blockage that is the cause of the <b>cardiogenic</b> shock, the prognosis is poor.|$|E

50|$|Classically it is <b>cardiogenic</b> (left ventricular) but fluid {{may also}} {{accumulate}} due to {{damage to the}} lung. This damage may be direct injury or injury mediated by high pressures within the pulmonary circulation. When directly or indirectly caused by increased left ventricular pressure pulmonary edema may form when mean pulmonary pressure rises from the normal of 15 mmHg to above 25 mmHg. Broadly, the causes of pulmonary edema {{can be divided into}} <b>cardiogenic</b> and non-cardiogenic. By convention <b>cardiogenic</b> refers to left ventricular causes.|$|E

50|$|<b>Cardiogenic</b> shock {{is caused}} by the failure of the heart to pump effectively. This can be due to damage to the heart muscle, most often from a large {{myocardial}} infarction. Other causes of <b>cardiogenic</b> shock include dysrhythmias, cardiomyopathy/myocarditis, congestive heart failure (CHF), contusio cordis, or cardiac valve problems.|$|E
50|$|It is {{possible}} for <b>cardiogenic</b> pulmonary edema to occur together with <b>cardiogenic</b> shock, in which the cardiac output is insufficient to sustain an adequate blood pressure. This can be treated with inotropic agents or by intra-aortic balloon pump, but this is regarded as temporary treatment while the underlying cause is addressed.|$|E
