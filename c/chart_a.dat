5|$|As Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers (SCAP) in Japan, MacArthur and {{his staff}} helped Japan rebuild itself, {{eradicate}} militarism and ultra-nationalism, promote political civil liberties, institute democratic government, and <b>chart</b> <b>a</b> new course that ultimately made Japan one of the world's leading industrial powers. The U.S. was firmly in control of Japan to oversee its reconstruction, and MacArthur was effectively the interim leader of Japan from 1945 until 1948. In 1946, MacArthur's staff drafted a new constitution that renounced war and stripped the Emperor of his military authority. The constitution—which became effective on 3 May 1947—instituted a parliamentary system of government, under which the Emperor acted only {{on the advice of}} his ministers. It included the famous Article 9, which outlawed belligerency as an instrument of state policy and the maintenance of a standing army. The constitution also enfranchised women, guaranteed fundamental human rights, outlawed racial discrimination, strengthened the powers of Parliament and the Cabinet, and decentralized the police and local government.|$|E
5|$|Detached with Nelson's expeditionary {{squadron}} for the expeditionary {{assault on}} Copenhagen on 2 April, Murray {{was given the}} task of leading the British force into the harbour, using channels he had helped to <b>chart</b> <b>a</b> decade earlier. She eventually passed by four Danish ships, taking fire from each one, before anchoring opposite the Jylland, which she engaged {{for the next four}} hours of the battle. By the time the truce was concluded, the Edgar had taken casualties of 31 killed and 104 wounded. During the peace negotiations with the Danish, and the subsequent foray to watch the Swedish forces at Karlskrona, Murray developed a strong rapport with Nelson, who had replaced Parker after the latter's recall to Britain.|$|E

5|$|The {{song was}} well {{received}} by contemporary critics, who noted {{the success of}} the Dragonette-production, in addition to reviewers who called it a good follow-up single to her debut due to the successful pop themes and potential of the track. Commercially the track debuted at number 40 in both the UK Singles Chart and the Scottish Singles <b>Chart.</b> <b>A</b> music video directed by Stephen Agnes was released; the video was filmed in the East Village of New York City and presented Roberts walking down various streets in the city with special effects added to her movements.

5|$|Upon its release, Aphrodite was {{met with}} {{generally}} positive reviews from music critics, many of whom complimented it as a return to form for Minogue. However, critics were divided on its production; many felt Price's production helped make the album cohesive, while some felt it made the album sound too similar to Minogue's previous work and lacked innovation. Commercially, Aphrodite was a success. In Minogue's native country Australia, it peaked at number two on the Australian Albums chart, and was later certified platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association. In the United Kingdom, the album debuted at {{number one on the}} UK Albums <b>chart,</b> <b>a</b> feat accomplished by Minogue's debut studio album Kylie (1988) during the same week 22 years prior. Aphrodite was the fourth studio album by Minogue to peak atop the UK albums chart and made her the first solo artist to have a number one album in four different decades in the region, achieving this in the 1980s, 1990s, 2000s and 2010s. She also became a Guinness World Record-holder for achieving the most consecutive decades with top five albums in the United Kingdom. The British Phonographic Industry certified Aphrodite platinum. The album also achieved strong charting internationally, reaching the top-five in countries like Belgium, France, Greece, Spain and Switzerland. It became Minogue's second highest-charting album in the United States by peaking at number 19 on the Billboard 200 chart.|$|E
