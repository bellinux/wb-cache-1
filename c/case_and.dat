5|$|The {{grammar of}} Quenya is agglutinative and mostly suffixing, i.e. {{different}} word particles {{are joined by}} appending them. It has basic word classes of verbs, nouns and pronouns/determiners, adjectives and prepositions. Nouns are inflected for <b>case</b> <b>and</b> number. Verbs are inflected for tense and aspect, and for agreement with subject and object. In early Quenya, adjectives agree with the noun they modify in <b>case</b> <b>and</b> number, but not in later Quenya, where this agreement disappears. The basic word order is subject–verb–object. Unless otherwise noted, samples in this section refer to Late Quenya as conceived by Tolkien after 1951.|$|E
