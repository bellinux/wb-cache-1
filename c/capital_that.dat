5|$|Carvings in the Decorated Gothic style may {{be found}} in the eastern end of the buildings, where there are many carved bosses. In the chapter house, the carvings of the fifty-one stalls include {{numerous}} small heads of great variety, many of them smiling or laughing. A well-known figure is the corbel of the dragon-slaying monk in the chapter house stair. The large continuous <b>capital</b> <b>that</b> encircles the central pillar of the chapter house is markedly different in style to the stiff-leaf of the Early English period. In contrast to the bold projections and undercutting of the earlier work, it has a rippling form and is clearly identifiable as grapevine.|$|E
5|$|During this time, Khánh spread rumors in the <b>capital</b> <b>that</b> the French {{were behind}} {{a plan to}} install a pro-communist {{government}} that would implement de Gaulle's plans for the neutralization of Vietnam. Helping Khánh in a concerted smear campaign were Khiêm and Thieu. The French Foreign Office had announced that Paris would establish diplomatic relations with Peking on January 28, and Khánh used {{this as an opportunity}} to play on American anti-neutralist sentiment. De Gaulle's attempt to cultivate relations with communist China was tied to his policy of calling on US troops to leave Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{debate whether}} early modern {{individuals}} experienced {{a period of}} youth in the modern sense. For many the early teens were marked by moving away from home to undertake life-cycle service, which was necessary {{so that they could}} build up skills and <b>capital</b> <b>that</b> would enable them to marry and create a separate household. Lower down in society boys might be apprenticed to a trade, or become agricultural servants. Girls might go into domestic or agricultural service. For those higher up in society and increasingly for those lower down, this might be after a period of schooling or even university.|$|E

5|$|Jilotepeque Viejo {{was settled}} by the Chajoma {{in order to}} provide a <b>capital</b> <b>that</b> was safer from attack from the hostile Iximche Kaqchikel kingdom than their {{previous}} capital. In spite of this, the city fell under the domination of Iximche and the city's architecture, spread in a number of fortified groups along a ridge surrounded by deep ravines, shows a mixture of Chajoma and Kaqchikel styles. At the time of the Spanish conquest, the Chajoma of Jilotepeque Viejo may have initially allied themselves with the Spanish together with Iximche and have joined in the general Kaqchikel uprising against the Spanish in 1524. The site was abandoned after the conquest and never reoccupied.|$|E
5|$|The Bone {{military}} leader Petta Panggawae and his Songko' Borrong soldiers invaded Pangala' and sided with Pong Maramba', a minor lord. Panggawae overtook Tiku's capital at Tondon and razed the city, leading Tiku and {{the civilian population}} to abandon the area. Tiku, having sided with the Sidenreng leader Andi Guru, was able to retake {{the remains of the}} <b>capital</b> <b>that</b> night. The war ended in 1890, after Dutch scouts– representing the colonial government on Java– reached Bone. However, the remaining states soon began another series of struggles over the arms and slave trade, where states would exchange weapons for slaves; Tiku also participated in the trade.|$|E
5|$|The {{half century}} {{or so of the}} {{maritime}} fur trade and the North West Coast trade enriched Boston shipowners, creating <b>capital</b> <b>that</b> helped New England's transformation from an agrarian to an industrial society. The trade stimulated the culture of North West Coast natives, made Hawaii famous and nearly overwhelmed the native Hawaiians with foreign influences. It played a role in increased commercial pressure on China at Canton. Fur bearing animals were devastated, especially sea otters. By 1850, sea otters were virtually extinct throughout the North West Coast and found only in the Aleutian Islands and California.|$|E

5|$|With {{a lack of}} {{domestic}} <b>capital</b> <b>that</b> was required for economic growth, the New Order reversed Sukarno's economic self-sufficiency policies and opened selected economic sectors {{of the country to}} foreign investment though the 1967 Foreign Investment Law. Suharto travelled to Western Europe and Japan to promote investment in Indonesia. The first foreign investors to re-enter Indonesia included mining companies Freeport Sulphur Company / International Nickel Company. Following government regulatory frameworks, domestic entrepreneurs (mostly Chinese-Indonesians) emerged in the late 1960s and early 1970s in the import-substitution light-manufacturing sector such as Astra Group and Salim Group.|$|E
5|$|After {{three months}} of {{inactivity}} and regrouping, Kagame decided in January 1991 that the RPF was ready to begin fighting again. The target chosen for the first attack was {{the northern city of}} Ruhengeri, which lies immediately south of the Virunga mountains. The city was the best choice from a practical point of view, being the only provincial <b>capital</b> <b>that</b> could be attacked quickly from the Virungas while maintaining an element of surprise. Kagame also favoured an attack on Ruhengeri for cultural reasons. President Habyarimana, as well as his wife and her powerful family, came from the north west of Rwanda and most Rwandans regarded the region was as the heartland of the regime. An attack there guaranteed that the population would become aware of the RPF's presence, and Kagame hoped the attack would destabilise the government.|$|E
5|$|During {{and after}} the Revolutionary War, Albany County saw a great {{increase}} in real estate transactions. After Horatio Gates' win over John Burgoyne at Saratoga in 1777, the upper Hudson Valley was generally at peace as the war raged on elsewhere. Prosperity was soon seen all over Upstate New York. Migrants from Vermont and Connecticut began flowing in, noting the advantages of living on the Hudson and trading at Albany, while being only a few days' sail from New York City. Albany reported a population of 3,498 in the first national census in 1790, an increase of almost 700% since its chartering. In 1797, the state capital of New York was moved permanently to Albany. From statehood to this date, the Legislature had frequently moved the state capital between Albany, Kingston, Hurley, Poughkeepsie, {{and the city of}} New York. Albany is the tenth-oldest state capital in the United States, but only the second-oldest state <b>capital</b> <b>that</b> is a city, after Santa Fe, New Mexico.|$|E

The results show the <b>capitals</b> <b>that</b> reached 100 % efficiency and also the only three <b>capitals</b> <b>that</b> touched the maximum efficiency over the three years.
