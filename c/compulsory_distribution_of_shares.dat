40|$|This paper {{considers}} dynamic {{efficiency and}} income distribution using an overlapping generation model of economic growth. The issues discussed {{within this framework}} intend {{to shed light on}} an ongoing debate in most developed countries: the reform in funding the retirement pension schemes. Private saving or <b>compulsory</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> income working independently of one another cannot achieve optimality. A flexible framework for policy action hinges on providing a mix of private saving and the adequate <b>share</b> <b>of</b> state sponsored security system. Overlapping generations, consumption-efficiency, Golden Rule, “pay-as-you-go” security system...|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates {{determinants}} <b>of</b> geographic <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>share</b> tenancy and analyzes its efficiency implications in pre-war Iwate prefecture, Japan. The <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>share</b> tenancy was {{attributable to}} risk represented by yield variability, {{which in turn}} was affected by seasonal winds called Yamase and topographic features. That risk raised transaction costs of adopting a fixed-rent tenancy associated with the common custom of rent reduction in Japan that mitigated the problem of risksharing. Estimation results suggest that risk, wealth, and strength of community ties were the main determinants of contract choice. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{statistically}} {{investigate the}} <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>share</b> {{price and the}} <b>distributions</b> <b>of</b> three common financial indicators using data from approximately 8, 000 companies publicly listed worldwide for the period 2004 - 2013. We find that the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>share</b> price follows Zipf's law; that is, it can be approximated by a power law distribution with exponent equal to 1. An examination <b>of</b> the <b>distributions</b> <b>of</b> dividends per <b>share,</b> cash flow per share, and {{book value per share}} - three financial indicators that can be assumed to influence corporate value (i. e. share price) - shows that these distributions can also be approximated by a power law distribution with power-law exponent equal to 1. We estimate a panel regression model in which share price is the dependent variable and the three financial indicators are explanatory variables. The two-way fixed effects model that was selected as the best model has quite high power for explaining the actual data. From these results, we can surmise that the reason why share price follows Zipf's law is that corporate value, i. e. company fundamentals, follows Zipf's law...|$|R

40|$|Conjoined {{twins are}} rare and present a unique {{challenge}} to pediatric surgeons and radiologists. An imaging strategy to accurately define anatomic fusion, vascular anomalies, and other associated abnormalities {{is important for}} surgical planning and prognostic information. A conjoined female twin with a combined weight of 2. 8 [*]kg was born by emergency caeserean. Hence, a computed tomography scan of the thorax and entire abdomen at 1. 25 [*]mm slice thickness was performed to delineate the internal structures of the twins. CT-angiography defined specific vascular supply which determined the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>shared</b> structures between the twins. An echocardiogram showed four heart chambers with atrioventricular septal defect. To further evaluate the heart chambers, the twin was planned for gated cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Unfortunately, they succumbed 6 hours apart due to complication of septicemia. Magnetic resonance imaging and CT scan provide excellent anatomic detail, demonstrating organ position, shared viscera, and limited vascular anatomy, whilst angiography defined specific vascular supply, useful in determining the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>shared</b> structures between the twins in planning for surgery...|$|R
40|$|The article {{presents}} dilemmas {{arising from the}} idea <b>of</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>shares</b> <b>of</b> state - owned companies to all citizens (universal privatisation).

The {{article presents}} also how this concept has taken shape. Subsequently the questions asked in the privatisation referenda of February 18, 1996 are being discussed. In conclusion the article analyses the possible impact of including some ideas of universal privatisation into the general course of transformation of the Polish economy.

40|$|The {{political}} {{integration in}} the EU, made {{the rules of the}} mutual legal assistance insufficient. The old model of mutual assistance was replaced approaching the judicial cooperation within the EU to the cooperation between judges from the same State. For this purpose it was necessary to find a balance between unification and diversity. The selective interoperability between the diverse legal systems of the Member States was the {{solution to the problem of}} the fragmentation of the criminal Justice in the European Union. Not all the judicial decisions are interoperable, but only those that were defined as equivalent resolutions in the European common rules. In this system the recognition is widely guaranteed by establishing a <b>compulsory</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> the competences between executing and issuing judicial authorities, preventing the examination of the internal aspects and basis of the issued resolution by the judge of the executing State, and establishing a strong limitation of the grounds for refusal and of the elements that can be considered by the executing judge. All this together with some limited possibilities offered to the States to reduce the impact of the mutual recognition to protect the national legal identity...|$|R

There is some evidence in previous theoretical and empirical research that market shares under collusion are more stable than in phases of competition.

Using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> market <b>share</b> changes during both the competitive and the collusive phases of ten recently discovered conspiracies is compared.
