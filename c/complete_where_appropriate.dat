40|$|NASA Dryden Flight Research Center {{uses its}} six-degrees-of-freedom (6 -DOF) fixed-base {{simulations}} for mission control room training to improve flight safety and operations. This concept {{is applied to}} numerous flight projects such as the F- 18 High Alpha Research Vehicle (HARV), the F- 15 Intelligent Flight Control System (IFCS), the X- 38 Actuator Control Test (XACT), and X- 43 A (Hyper-X). The Dryden 6 -DOF simulations are typically used through various stages of a project, from design to ground tests. The roles of these simulations have expanded to support control room training, reinforcing flight safety by building control room staff proficiency. Real-time telemetry, radar, and video data are generated from flight vehicle simulation models. These data are used to drive the control room displays. Nominal static values are used to <b>complete</b> information <b>where</b> <b>appropriate.</b> Audio communication is also {{an integral part of}} training sessions. This simulation capability is used to train control room personnel and flight crew for nominal missions and emergency situations. Such training sessions are also opportunities to refine flight cards and control room display pages, exercise emergency procedures, and practice control room setup for the day of flight. This paper describes this technology as it is used in the X- 43 A and F- 15 IFCS and XACT projects...|$|R
