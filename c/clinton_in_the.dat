5|$|Pritzker was {{an early}} {{supporter}} of Obama's political career, helping to finance his 2004 Senate campaign. Early in the democratic presidential primary, Pritzker's financing helped Obama's candidacy survive when Obama was trailing Hillary <b>Clinton</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> polls. Pritzker remained a major fundraiser for Obama during the 2008 democratic primary and raised millions overall for his White House bid. She served as the national finance chair of Obama's 2008 presidential campaign. Under her direction, the campaign reached out to small donors. Pritzker also hosted more lavish fundraisers {{as part of her}} effort to raise money.|$|E
5|$|Ford {{has been}} {{described}} as entertaining, controversial, and politically incorrect. He supported Hillary <b>Clinton</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2008 Democratic presidential primaries and questioned Barack Obama's appeal to white voters. Ford later apologized for his comments, stating that any Democrat could win and that he had supported other African American candidates for president in the past. Ford's comments prompted a primary challenge in 2008 from Charleston lawyer Dwayne Green. In the beginning of his campaign, Green managed to raise double the amount of campaign funds Ford raised, and although Ford's fundraising improved he for the first time attended a candidate forum to receive free publicity, because his campaign had financial difficulty resulting from the contested primary and a fire in his home. Green was defeated in the primary election by a wide margin. Ford praised Obama's election in November 2008, but criticized South Carolina Congressman James Clyburn's family for allegedly attempting to profit off Obama's victory.|$|E
