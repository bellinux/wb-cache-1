40|$|The overall {{objective}} of the thesis is to design a robot <b>chassis</b> <b>frame</b> which is a bearing structure of a vehicle supporting all mechanical components and providing structure and stability. Various techniques and scientific principles were used to design a <b>chassis</b> <b>frame.</b> Design principles were applied throughout the process. By using Solid-Works software,virtual models was made for <b>chassis</b> <b>frame.</b> <b>Chassis</b> <b>frame</b> of overall dimension 1597 * 800 * 950 mm 3 was designed. Center of mass lieson 1 / 3 of the length from front wheel at height 338 mm in the symmetry plane. Overall weight of the <b>chassis</b> <b>frame</b> is 80. 12 kg. Manufacturing drawing is also provided. Additionally,structural analysis was done in FEMAP which gives the busting result for chassis design by taking into consideration stress and deflection on different kind of loading resembling real life case. On the basis of simulated result, selected material was verified. Resulting design is expected to perform its intended function without failure. As a suggestion for further research, additional fatigue analysis and proper dynamic analysis can be conducted to make the study more robust...|$|R
40|$|Thin walled beams warp under {{torsional}} and longitudinal loads. Warping restraint produces high longitudinal stresses. This is {{an analysis}} of the stress distribution in the side members of commercial vehicle <b>chassis</b> <b>frames</b> under the effects of the previously little studied longitudinal loads which may act on a truck chassis through spring hanger brackets. The structure analysed is a model <b>chassis</b> <b>frame</b> consisting of channel section side members and four cross members with different joint connections. The developed theories are incorporated into a special purpose finite element program which may be used in the preliminary stages of <b>chassis</b> <b>frame</b> design. Although the program is only used for the longitudinal load case in this thesis, it is generally applicable for other chassis load cases, including torsion, bending,. [...] etc and combination of these. The theoretical results obtained from the program and the finite element analysis on complete <b>chassis</b> <b>frame</b> models are validated against experiments performed on a strain-gauged <b>chassis</b> <b>frame</b> model constructed with the same dimensions and constructional details as the finite element models with the appropriate loading and boundary conditions. Suggestions for the optimum design and attachment positions for components such as spring hanger bracket which may apply longitudinal loads to the side members of the <b>chassis</b> <b>frame</b> are discussed {{from the point of view}} of longitudinal loadings...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an investigation on {{the cause of}} severe vibration problem of a coach with four-cylinder engine running at an idle state using vibration and impact hammer modal experiments to obtain the main vibration frequency components and the natural characteristics of the coach. The vibration {{results indicate that the}} main vibration component comes from the vibration transmitted from the engine to the <b>chassis</b> <b>frame,</b> which is closely related with the engine idle speed. Based on structural simulation analysis of the coach’s <b>chassis</b> <b>frame</b> and comparison with modal testing, the coach severe vibration problem was due to coupling resonance between the engine idle frequency and the fourth natural frequency of the <b>chassis</b> <b>frame.</b> The solution to eliminate the vibration problem is provided by changing the local structure stiffness of the <b>chassis</b> <b>frame.</b> The contribution of this paper lies in providing a solution to solve similar problems...|$|R

40|$|The <b>chassis</b> <b>frame</b> is an {{important}} part in a truck and it carries the whole load acting on the truck as well as different parts of the automobile. So it must be strong enough to resist the shock, twist, vibration and other stresses. Maximum stress and maximum deflection are important criteria for design of the chassis. The objective of present is to determine the maximum stress, maximum deflection and to recognize critical regions under static loading condition. Static structural analysis of the <b>chassis</b> <b>frame</b> is carried out by FEA Method. The structural <b>chassis</b> <b>frame</b> is modeled using PRO-E wildfire 4. 0 software. The Pre-processing has done with HYPERMESH software; then the problem has been solved through RADIOSS and the post processing was done by HYPERVIEW. The results obtained like maximum shear stress, Von-mises stress and maximum deflections are used for improving design modification.

Sets of parameters for <b>chassis</b> <b>frame</b> variants are designed by employing Response Surface Methodology (RSM) in statistical software, “MINITAB 16 ”. The regression equation for VMS is developed using the Finite Element Analysis (FEA) results of different variants of the <b>chassis</b> <b>frame.</b> The analysis of variance (ANOVA) is performed to statistically analyze the results. The individual effects of parameters and the combined effects of multiple parameters are examined.

50|$|For engineering, {{the rear}} kickup on the <b>chassis</b> <b>frame</b> was {{eliminated}} by {{the adoption of}} a 'banjo' frame. Unlike contemporary practice, the rear axle was placed through large openings {{on both sides of the}} frame, with rubber snubbers to absorb any shock if the car axle should make contact. This in turn permitted a wider body. To help lower the car, the rear springs were mounted on the outer sides of the <b>chassis</b> <b>frame</b> and not under the frame. This idea was eventually copied by other manufacturers - Chrysler, for example, in 1957.|$|R
