25|$|C3 {{consists}} of four sections, three of which provide cyber technical and investigative services, the Cyber Crimes Section (CCS), the Child Exploitation Section (CES), and the Digital Forensic Section (DFS). The fourth section, the Information Technology and Administrative Section (ITAS), provides the technical and *operational infrastructure services necessary to support the other three C3 sections. The center is a co-location of special agents, intelligence research specialists, administrative support, and contractors, {{all of which are}} instrumental in operational and technical continuity. Within each section, there are various program managers assigned to certain programmatic areas. These program managers are responsible for supporting ICE Internet investigations through the generation and the dissemination of viable leads. Program managers are available to provide guidance and training to field agents as well as to other law enforcement (foreign and domestic) upon request. Strategically located HSI Field Offices have their own <b>Cyber</b> <b>Forensics</b> Laboratories staffed by Computer Forensics Agents (CFAs). These CFA's are HSI special agents who have been extensively trained in cyber investigative techniques and protocols.|$|E

In this paper, a study is presented that assessed whether software tools designed to encourage construction of narrative accounts would facilitate <b>cyber</b> <b>forensic</b> analysis. Compared to a baseline condition (i. e., spreadsheet with note-taking capabilities) and a visualization condition, subjects performed best when provided tools that emphasized established components of narratives. Specifically, features that encouraged subjects to identify suspected entities, and their activities and motivations proved beneficial. It is proposed that software tools developed to facilitate <b>cyber</b> <b>forensic</b> analysis and training of cyber security professionals incorporate techniques that facilitate a narrative account of events...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{theoretical}} {{solution to the}} problem of Social Engineering (SE) attacks perpetrated over the phone lines. As a byproduct real time attack signatures are generated, which can be used in a <b>cyber</b> <b>forensic</b> analysis of such attacks. Current methods of SE attack detection and prevention rely on policy and personnel training, which fails because the root of the problem, people, are still involved. The proposed solution relies on computer systems to analyze phone conversations in real time and determine if the caller is deceiving the receiver. This Social Engineering Defense Architecture (SEDA) is completely theoretical as the technologies employed are only in the proof of concept phase, but they are all proven to be tractable problems...|$|R
