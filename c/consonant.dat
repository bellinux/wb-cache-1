5|$|The pulmonic <b>consonant</b> table, which {{includes}} most consonants, is arranged in rows that designate manner of articulation, meaning how the <b>consonant</b> is produced, and columns that designate place of articulation, meaning {{where in the}} vocal tract the <b>consonant</b> is produced. The main chart includes only consonants with a single place of articulation.|$|E

5|$|A pulmonic <b>consonant</b> is a <b>consonant</b> made by obstructing the glottis (the {{space between}} the vocal cords) or oral cavity (the mouth) and either {{simultaneously}} or subsequently letting out air from the lungs. Pulmonic consonants make {{up the majority of}} consonants in the IPA, as well as in human language. All consonants in the English language fall into this category.|$|E
50|$|In {{phonology}} and phonetics, anterior <b>consonants</b> {{refer to}} <b>consonants</b> {{articulated in the}} front of the mouth; they comprise the labial <b>consonants,</b> dental <b>consonants</b> and alveolar <b>consonants.</b> Retroflex and palatal <b>consonants,</b> as well as all <b>consonants</b> articulated further back in the mouth, are usually excluded.|$|R

5000|$|Front {{and back}} vowels are {{also known as}} acute and grave vowels, respectively.For <b>consonants,</b> however, front/back are not {{synonyms}} of acute/grave. Grave <b>consonants</b> include both back <b>consonants</b> and labial <b>consonants,</b> while acute <b>consonants</b> include all of front <b>consonants</b> except labial <b>consonants.</b> This suggests that a three-way division between labial, acute and back (vaguely speaking, [...] "P-like", [...] "T-like" [...] and [...] "K-like", respectively) might be useful in some contexts.|$|R

5|$|Classical Nahuatl {{and most}} of the modern {{varieties}} have fairly simple phonological systems. They allow only syllables with maximally one initial and one final <b>consonant.</b> <b>Consonant</b> clusters occur only word-medially and over syllable boundaries. Some morphemes have two alternating forms: one with a vowel i to prevent <b>consonant</b> clusters and one without it. For example, the absolutive suffix has the variant forms -tli (used after consonants) and -tl (used after vowels). Some modern varieties, however, have formed complex clusters from vowel loss. Others have contracted syllable sequences, causing accents to shift or vowels to become long.|$|E

50|$|Voiced <b>consonants</b> {{are seldom}} {{actually}} aspirated. Symbols for voiced <b>consonants</b> followed by , such as , typically represent <b>consonants</b> with murmured voiced release (see below). In the grammatical tradition of Sanskrit, aspirated <b>consonants</b> are called voiceless aspirated, and breathy-voiced <b>consonants</b> are called voiced aspirated.|$|R

5|$|Greenlandic prosody {{does not}} include stress as an {{autonomous}} category; instead, prosody is determined by tonal and durational parameters. Intonation is influenced by syllable weight: heavy syllables are pronounced {{in a way that}} may be perceived as stress. Heavy syllables include syllables with long vowels and syllables before <b>consonant</b> clusters. The last syllable is stressed in words with fewer than four syllables and without long vowels or <b>consonant</b> clusters. The antepenultimate syllable is stressed in words with more than four syllables that are all light. In words with many heavy syllables, syllables with long vowels are considered heavier than syllables before a <b>consonant</b> cluster.|$|E
50|$|Coronal {{places of}} {{articulation}} include the dental <b>consonants</b> at the upper teeth, the alveolar <b>consonants</b> at the upper gum (the alveolar ridge), the various postalveolar <b>consonants</b> (domed palato-alveolar, laminal alveolo-palatal, and apical retroflex) just behind that, the true retroflex <b>consonants</b> curled back against the hard palate, and linguolabial <b>consonants</b> with the tongue against the upper lip. Alveolo-palatal and linguolabial <b>consonants</b> sometimes behave as dorsal and labial <b>consonants,</b> respectively, rather than as coronals.|$|R
50|$|Laryngeal <b>consonants,</b> a term often {{synonymous with}} guttural, are <b>consonants</b> with their primary {{articulation}} in the larynx: the pharyngeal (including epiglottal) and glottal <b>consonants,</b> {{and for some}} languages uvular (or some uvular) <b>consonants.</b>|$|R

5|$|In {{the naming}} scheme as {{originally}} developed, these substems mostly {{consist of a}} <b>consonant,</b> a vowel, then another <b>consonant.</b> The final letter may be dropped if the resulting name {{would be difficult to}} pronounce otherwise. Examples include -ci(r)- for the circulatory system, -li(m)- for the immune system (lim stands for lymphocyte) and -ne(r)- for the nervous system. The final letter is usually omitted if the following source substem begins with a <b>consonant</b> (such as -zu- or -xi-), but not all target substems are used in their shortened form. -mul-, for example, is never reduced to -mu- because no chimeric or humanized antibodies targeting the musculoskeletal system ever received an INN. Combination of target and source substems results in endings like -limumab (immune system, human) or -ciximab (circulatory system, chimeric, <b>consonant</b> r dropped).|$|E

5000|$|Proto-Edoid is reconstructed {{as having}} a {{contrast}} between oral and nasal <b>consonants</b> and oral and nasal vowels typical for the region. However, in some Edoid languages nasal vowels have been reanalyzed as allophones of oral vowels after nasal <b>consonants,</b> and in others nasal <b>consonants</b> have been reanalyzed as allophones of oral <b>consonants</b> before nasal vowels, {{reducing the number of}} phonemically nasal <b>consonants.</b> Urhobo retains three nasals, , and has five oral <b>consonants</b> with nasal allophones, in Edo this is reduced to one phonemic nasal, , but eight additional <b>consonants</b> with nasal allophones, and in Ukue there are no indisputably phonemic nasals and only two <b>consonants</b> with nasal allophones, [...]|$|R
5000|$|Co-articulated <b>consonants</b> or complex <b>consonants</b> are <b>consonants</b> {{produced}} with two simultaneous places of articulation. They may {{be divided into}} two classes: doubly articulated <b>consonants</b> with two primary places of articulation of the same manner (both stop, or both nasal, etc.), and <b>consonants</b> with secondary articulation, that is, a second articulation not of the same manner.|$|R

5|$|The most {{interesting}} aspects of Irish phonotactics {{revolve around the}} behavior of <b>consonant</b> clusters.

5|$|The {{recognition}} of Beonna {{as a historical}} figure leaves the 'Hun' element in the word Hunbeanna detached. Beanna is itself a hypocoristic form of a two-part name, and the 'nn' in the name has been interpreted as representing a geminate <b>consonant.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Postalveolar <b>consonants</b> (sometimes spelled post-alveolar) are <b>consonants</b> {{articulated}} {{with the}} tongue near or touching {{the back of}} the alveolar ridge, farther back in the mouth than the alveolar <b>consonants,</b> which are at the ridge itself but not {{as far back as the}} hard palate, the place of articulation for palatal <b>consonants.</b> Examples of postalveolar <b>consonants</b> are the English palato-alveolar <b>consonants</b> , as in the words [...] "shill", [...] "chill", [...] "vision", and [...] "Jill", respectively.|$|R
50|$|In Australian linguistics, the {{peripheral}} <b>consonants</b> are a natural class encompassing <b>consonants</b> articulated at {{the extremes of}} the mouth: labials and velars. That is, they are the non-coronal <b>consonants.</b> In Australian languages, these <b>consonants</b> pattern together both phonotactically and acoustically. In Arabic and Maltese philology, the moon letters transcribe non-coronal <b>consonants,</b> {{but they do not}} form a natural class.|$|R
50|$|Most {{languages}} {{have only}} pulmonic <b>consonants.</b> Ian Maddieson, in his survey of 566 languages, {{found that only}} 152 had ejectives, implosives, or clicks (or {{two or three of}} these types) - that is, 73% of the world's extant languages have only pulmonic <b>consonants.</b> See glottalic <b>consonants</b> and click <b>consonants</b> {{for more information on the}} distribution of nonpulmonic <b>consonants.</b>|$|R
5|$|When {{the onset}} or coda of a root {{contains}} a <b>consonant</b> cluster, the consonants in this cluster must be ordered {{according to their}} sonority. The vowel constitutes a sonority peak, and the sonority must progressively rise in the onset and progressively fall in the coda.|$|E
5|$|According to K.C. Aryan, {{the number}} of Matrikas is {{determined}} {{in the structure of}} the Devanagari alphabet. First is the (A) group which contains the vowels, then the (Ka), (Cha), (Ta), (ta), (Pa), (Ya) and (Ksha) groups. The seven mother goddesses (Saptamatrikas) correspond to the seven <b>consonant</b> groups; when the vocalic (A) group is added to it, the eight mother goddesses (Ashtamatrikas) are obtained. The Shaktas hold that the Mothers preside over impurities (mala) and over sounds of the language. The Mothers were identified with fourteen vowels plus the anusarva and visarga– making their number sixteen.|$|E
5|$|Assonance, {{where the}} use of similar vowel sounds within a word rather than similar sounds at the {{beginning}} or end of a word, was widely used in skaldic poetry, but {{goes back to the}} Homeric epic. Because verbs carry much of the pitch in the English language, assonance can loosely evoke the tonal elements of Chinese poetry and so is useful in translating Chinese poetry. Consonance occurs where a <b>consonant</b> sound is repeated throughout a sentence without putting the sound only at the front of a word. Consonance provokes a more subtle effect than alliteration and so is less useful as a structural element.|$|E
