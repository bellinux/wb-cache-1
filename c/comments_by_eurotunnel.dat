25|$|Three {{separate}} investigations were conducted. The {{first was}} a French judicial inquiry into {{the cause of the}} fire, the second was an internal inquiry <b>by</b> <b>Eurotunnel</b> and the third was an inquiry by the Channel Tunnel Safety Authority (CTSA), a bi-national body formed of personnel from British and French railway safety bodies, fire brigades and government departments.|$|R
50|$|On 6 June 2013, the UK Competition Commission {{ruled that}} Eurotunnel, which leased the three MyFerryLink vessels to the SCOP, {{could no longer}} operate ferry {{services}} from Dover, due to {{the proportion of the}} cross-Channel market that they held as a result. The ruling was appealed <b>by</b> <b>Eurotunnel,</b> allowing sailings operated by the company to continue as normal.|$|R

50|$|Samphire Hoe Country Park is {{a country}} park {{situated}} 3 km west of Dover in Kent in southeast England. The park was created by using 4.9 million cubic metres of chalk marl from the Channel Tunnel excavations and is found {{at the bottom of}} a section of the White Cliffs of Dover. The site is owned <b>by</b> <b>Eurotunnel</b> Ltd., and managed by the White Cliffs Countryside Project.|$|R
5000|$|Cheriton Hill was the {{location}} of the discovery of the Late Spider orchid in the 19th century. At one point the number of known plants at Folkestone/Cheriton declined to just six, but with improved management of the chalk grassland <b>by</b> <b>Eurotunnel</b> and the [...] White Cliffs Countryside Project, the population is now much healthier, estimated in 2008 to be 165 plants, some 30% of the UK population.|$|R
50|$|MS Nord Pas-de-Calais is {{a freight}} ferry owned and {{operated}} <b>by</b> <b>Eurotunnel.</b> She was built in 1987 by Chantiers du Nord et de la Mediterranee, Dunkirk (Yard No 325) for Societe Nationale des Chemin de Fer Francais (SNCF), Paris as a multi-purpose passenger and roll-on roll-off ferry for lorries and railway vehicles. After the introduction of Eurotunnel {{there was no need}} for a train ferry, so SNCF were losing money running her. She was acquired by SNAT and Stena Sealink in 1989 who operated the Nord Pas-de-Calais until 31 December 1995. From 1 January 1996 SNAT operated as SeaFrance. The vessel was renamed SeaFrance Nord Pas-de-Calais. SeaFrance operated until November 2011, and were liquidated on 9 January 2012. Eurotunnel won the bid for the three of the former SeaFrance vessels the original name of the vessel was restored, dropping the SeaFrance prefix. MyFerryLink started running on 20 August 2012, although Nord Pas-de-Calais joined in November 2012 following a refit. Following the end of operations by MyFerryLink, the ship has been retained <b>by</b> <b>Eurotunnel</b> for transporting hazardous freight.|$|R
50|$|A second English {{channel tunnel}} with a road has been {{proposed}} <b>by</b> <b>Eurotunnel,</b> the motorway beneath the sea to link Britain and France could be built in the next 25 years under proposals. The ambitious project would involve {{the construction of the}} longest tunnel {{of its kind in the}} world, containing two 46 km-long carriageways, one on top of the other, which would allow motorists to complete the journey in about 30 minutes.|$|R
50|$|The {{appendices}} to the Agreement cover specific aspects, {{including the}} purchase {{and sale of}} land, insurance obligations and exercise {{of the right of}} substitution. The right of substitution provides for the temporary transfer of operation to two entities {{under the control of the}} lenders who financed the Tunnel to allow them to be reimbursed. Substitution may only be exercised under specific cases of default <b>by</b> <b>Eurotunnel</b> and requires the non-objection of the two governments.|$|R
500|$|Various track {{recording}} trains run as necessary, including {{visits by}} the New Measurement Train. On {{the night of}} 4/5 May 2011 the SNCF TGV Iris 320 laboratory train took over, being hauled from Coquolles to St Pancras and back, towed <b>by</b> <b>Eurotunnel</b> Krupp locomotives numbers 4 and 5. The Iris 320 runs [...] for Network Rail (High Speed) are {{an extension of the}} [...] monitoring cycle already undertaken by SNCF International since December 2010 for Eurotunnel every two months.|$|R
50|$|Much of Folkestone Downs {{is owned}} <b>by</b> <b>Eurotunnel</b> and managed <b>by</b> the White Cliffs Countryside Project. Grazing was {{abandoned}} after the Second World War {{resulting in an}} invasion of coarse grasses and scrub. This resulted in a reduction of the grassland flora, particularly after the rabbit population was reduced by myxamatosis in the 1950s. Cattle grazing was resumed in 1990. Much of the downland is designated as open access land following the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000.|$|R

50|$|Five {{locomotives}} were built, numbered 0001-0005. They carry {{a yellow}} and grey livery {{and are used}} <b>by</b> <b>Eurotunnel</b> for rescuing trains in the Channel Tunnel, and for propelling service trains in the channel tunnel. They are cleared to travel to Calais, Ashford, or St. Pancras; since 2007 they have been authorised to rescue trains on High Speed 1 {{in the event of}} a power failure. They have also been used to haul the SNCF TGV Iris 320 test train through the Channel Tunnel.|$|R
50|$|As part {{of their}} holiday {{packages}} Eurocamp provide their own kidsâ clubs and bespoke accommodation as well as optional travel for holidaymakers, <b>by</b> ferry, <b>Eurotunnel</b> or plane.|$|R
25|$|The {{design and}} {{construction}} {{was done by the}} ten construction companies in the CTG/F-M group. The French terminal and boring from Sangatte was undertaken by the five French construction companies in the joint venture group GIE Transmanche Construction. The English Terminal and boring from Shakespeare Cliff was undertaken by the five British construction companies in the Translink Joint Venture. The two partnerships were linked by TransManche Link (TML), a bi-national project organisation. The MaÃ®tre d'Oeuvre was a supervisory engineering body employed <b>by</b> <b>Eurotunnel</b> {{under the terms of the}} concession that monitored project activity and reported back to the governments and banks.|$|R
50|$|During 2000 Eurostar (UK) {{offered their}} seven {{members of the}} class (92020 / 021 / 032 / 040 / 044-046) for sale being surplus to {{requirements}} with the non-commencement of sleeper services through the Channel Tunnel. However no buyer could be found so they were decommissioned and stored at Crewe International electric depot. Five of these locomotives have now been purchased <b>by</b> <b>Eurotunnel</b> to be used by their Europorte 2 rail freight undertaking for short haul rail traffic in France. In July 2011 Europorte 2/Eurotunnel purchased the five remaining locomotives that had belonged to SNCF, bringing Eurotunnel's total up to sixteen Class 92s.|$|R

50|$|The {{opening of}} the Channel Tunnel in 1994 allowed direct goods trains to run between the UK and the {{continent}} for the first time. Freight services are also offered <b>by</b> the <b>Eurotunnel</b> Truck Shuttles.|$|R
2500|$|Ideas for a cross-Channel fixed link {{appeared}} {{as early as}} 1802, but British political and press pressure over the compromising of national security stalled attempts to construct a tunnel. An early attempt at building a Channel Tunnel {{was made in the}} late 19th century, on the English side [...] "in the hope of forcing the hand of the English Government". The eventual successful project, organised <b>by</b> <b>Eurotunnel,</b> began construction in 1988 and opened in 1994. At Â£5.5 billion (1985 prices), it was at the time the most expensive construction project ever proposed. The cost finally came in at Â£9 billion ($21 billion), well over its predicted budget.|$|R
2500|$|Where {{demand for}} travel by road vehicle to a {{disconnected}} island or mainland settlement is high, roll-on/roll-off ferries are commonly available if the journey is relatively short. [...] For long-distance trips, passengers usually {{travel by air}} and rent a car upon arrival. [...] If facilities are available, vehicles and cargo can also be shipped to many disconnected settlements by boat, or air transport at much greater expense. [...] The island of Great Britain {{is connected to the}} European road network <b>by</b> <b>Eurotunnel</b> Shuttle - an example of a car shuttle train which is a service used in other parts of Europe to travel under mountains and over wetlands.|$|R
