40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present work is to {{accurately}} measure the neutron cross sections of samarium. The most significant isotope is {sup 149 }Sm, which has a large neutron absorption cross section at thermal energies and is a {sup 235 }U fission product with a 1 % yield. Its cross sections are thus of concern to reactor neutronics. Neutron capture and transmission measurements were performed by the time-of-flight technique at the Rensselaer Polytechnic institute (RPI) LINAC facility using metallic and liquid Sm samples. The capture measurements were made at the 25 meter flight station with a multiplicity-type capture detector, and the transmission total cross-section measurements were performed at 15 - and 25 -meter flight stations with {sup 6 }Li glass scintillation detectors. Resonance parameters were determined by a combined analysis of six experiments (three capture and three transmission) using the multi-level R-matrix Bayesian code SAMMY version M 2. The significant features of this work are as follows. Dilute samples of samarium nitrate in deuterated water (D{sub 2 }O) were prepared to measure the strong resonances at 0. 1 and 8 eV without saturation. Disk-shaped spectroscopic quartz cells were obtained with parallel inner surfaces to provide a uniform thickness of solution. The diluent feature of the SAMMY program was used to analyze these data. The SAMMY program also includes multiple scattering corrections to capture yield data and resolution functions specific to the RPI facility. Resonance parameters for all stable isotopes of samarium were deduced for all resonances up to 30 eV. Thermal capture cross-section and <b>capture</b> <b>resonance</b> integral calculations were made using the resultant resonance parameters and were compared to results obtained using resonance parameters from ENDF/B-VI updated through release 3. Extending the definition of the <b>capture</b> <b>resonance</b> integral to include the strong 0. 1 eV resonance in {sup 149 }Sm, present measurements agree within estimated uncertainties with EnDF/B-VI release 3.

The DEAP method is demonstrated with data obtained with a Roman bronze water tap excavated in Nijmegen (The Netherlands).

40|$|The {{concept of}} energy pumping is to passively reduce the {{vibrations}} on a primary system (linear or nonlinear) by attaching to it an essentially nonlinear damped oscillator also named Nonlinear Energy Sink (NES).

The concept has been extensively studied from theoretical and numerical point of views. These studies include transient and steady state dynamic analysis. In contrast to the classical linear vibration absorber, which is effective only for narrow frequency ranges, a properly designed NES is able to absorb vibrational energy of general broad band transient excitations, provided that the input energy is above a certain threshold.

In an effort to assess the interest of this experimental data to validate modern nuclear data and improve their uncertainties, a preliminary re-analysis of selected configurations was conducted with Monte-Carlo codes (MCNP 6 /SERPENT 2) and modern nuclear data libraries (ENDF/B-VII. 0, JEFF- 3. 1. 1 and JENDL- 4. 0).
