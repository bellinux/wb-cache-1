40|$|The {{knee joints}} of mice {{can be used}} as a model for {{studying}} the effects of interventions on knee laxity. The goal of this study was to quantify knee joint laxity in vitro. Three devices were developed: a positioning- and cementing device, an anterior-posterior (AP) laxity tester and a varus-valgus (VV) laxity tester. The positioning and cementing device was used to position the joint in a reproducible way and to attach <b>clamping</b> <b>pins</b> to the proximal femur and distal tibia using PM MA. The <b>clamping</b> <b>pins</b> were used to fix the joint to the AP- and VV-testers. In both testers the load was applied by means of a spindle-actuated spring while load and displacements were measured simultaneously. The load [...] displacement data were used to calculate displacement and compliance parameters. The performance of the testers was evaluated by testing 5 normal knee joints of 5 mice. Total AP-translation at + or - 0. 8 N was 0. 43 (+ or - 0. 16 S. D.) mm with compliances of 0. 14 (+ or - 0. 05 S. D.) mm N(1) and 0. 12 (+ or - 10. 05 S. D.) mm N(- 1) at 0. 8 N posterior and anterior force, respectively. Total VV-rotation at + or - 4 Nmm was 17. 2 (+ or - 2. 6 S. D.) degrees with compliances of 0. 9 degrees Nmm(- 1) (+ or - 0. 2 degrees Nmm(- 1) S. D.) and 1. 0 Nmm(- 1) (+ or - 0. 4 degrees Nmm(- 1) S. D.) at 4 Nmm valgus and varus moment, respectively. The contributions of the deformations of the bones and the fixtures to the rotations were negligible in the VV-test. In the AP-test they account for approximately 0. 07 (+ or - 0. 03 S.

30|$|Factors which {{determine}} the stiffness of a fixator construct depend on its two main constituents: the device material and configuration {{on one hand}} and the pins on the other. Fixator rigidity is directly proportion to pin stiffness that is increased by: firstly improving material properties; secondly by increasing pin diameter—but not to exceed one-third of the bone diameter—and thirdly a decreased pin offset (the free bending length of pins which is the distance between the bone surface and the external <b>pin</b> <b>clamp).</b> Other <b>pin</b> factors that add to fixator rigidity are increased pin spread (length of the fractured bone involved in fixation), increased pin numbers and levels and lastly, increased pin divergent angle in the axial plane [7, 11, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25]. Considering the aforementioned factors, the design of the external fixator used in this study can be considered as a modification of the Catagni and Cattaneo module in 1986 [11, 12] but where the distal rings are replaced by femoral arches.|$|R

40|$|A Rayleigh type {{analysis}} involving chosen {{modes of}} the panel as degrees of freedom is used to treat the flutter of a two-dimensional flat panel supported at its {{leading and trailing edges}} and subjected to a middle-plane tensile force. The panel has a supersonic stream passing over its upper surface and still air below. The aerodynamic forces due to the supersonic stream are obtained from the theory for linearized two-dimensional unsteady flow and the forces due to the still air are obtained from acoustical theory. In order to study the effect of increasing the number of modes in the analysis, two and then four modes are employed. The modes used are the first four natural modes {{of the panel}} in a vacuum with no tensile force acting. The analysis includes these variables: Mach number, structural damping, tensile force, density of the still air, and edge fixity (<b>clamped</b> and <b>pinned).</b> For certain combinations of these variables, stability boundaries are obtained which can be used to determine the panel thickness required to prevent flutter for any panel material and altitude...|$|R
40|$|Fluid {{passing through}} a {{cylindrical}} shell causes both lateral displacements and deformation of the cross-section. Studies have shown that this applies to both the cantilevered and clamped-clamped shells. The effect of boundary conditions was examined and {{it was concluded that}} a system with identical end conditions (<b>clamped</b> or <b>pinned)</b> is conservative; thus, at sufficiently high flow, it loses stability by divergence, followed by coupled-mode flutter at a slightly higher flow velocity. This thesis focuses on the systems of clamped-pinned and pinned-clamped shells. Initially using two different theories, the standing wave analysis and the travelling wave analysis, small dampings (negative or positive) are found in a system of clamped-pinned (and pinned-clamped) ends before the flow reaches the critical divergence velocity. The same result is obtained based on an analysis of an elastically constrained shell. Upon further examination, it is found that the small dampings observed in the first two cases are simply numerical artifacts: the magnitude of these dampings tends to zero as the accuracy of the computation is improved Hence, it is concluded that the clamped-pinned and pinned-clamped systems are conservative...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} effect of {{localized}} Joule heating on the mechanical properties of doubly clamped nanowires under tensile stress. Local heating results in systematic variation of the resonant frequency; these frequency changes result from thermal stresses that depend on temperature dependent thermal conductivity and expansion coefficient. The change in sign of the linear expansion coefficient of InAs {{is reflected in the}} resonant response of the system near a bath temperature of 20 K. Using finite element simulations to model the experimentally observed frequency shifts, we show that the thermal conductivity of a nanowire can be approximated in the 10 - 60 K temperature range by the empirical form κ=bT W/mK, where the value of b for a nanowire was found to be b= 0. 035 W/mK^ 2, significantly lower than bulk values. Also, local heating allows us to independently vary the temperature of the nanowire relative to the <b>clamping</b> points <b>pinned</b> to the bath temperature.

The space of interpolants of variable length is shown to be a smooth manifold. If the length is fixed, and there are no nodes, then the space of interpolants is a manifold. When {{there is at least one}} node, and at least one node is not on the line segment between the endpoints, then the space of interpolants of fixed length is a smooth manifold. Sufficient conditions are given which ensure the space of interpolants continues to be a smooth manifold in the presence of additional constraints such as <b>clamping</b> and <b>pinning.</b> A new fundamental finite-dimensional equation is derived. When it is solved it yields all nonlinear splines, and every nonlinear spline appears in this way. An important feature is that the same symbolic equation is used for all possible combinations of the constraints considered. It is shown how to take the solutions of the fundamental equation and use them to express the corresponding nonlinear splines in terms of a pair of elliptic functions. An inequality is derived that specifies which elliptic function appears along each section of the spline. The nonlinear splines are in a unified way shown to beC 2 for all possible combinations of the constraints considered...|$|R

30|$|The {{principles}} of biomechanical stability of external fixation {{would indicate that}} pin diameter, number and spread combined with <b>pin</b> <b>clamp</b> and clamp–bar interfaces {{need to be addressed}} individually and together in order to achieve a maximally performing construct in the clinical setting. In the standard cantilever-loaded mode, the monolateral fixator is at risk of pin loosening and breakage. During failure the distractive force is lost and the desired biological effect reduced. Modifications of this frame have been developed to counter this problem by which fixation is supplemented by additional lateral pins or by extending the fixation to the iliac crest [14]. In this study {{we have been able to}} show that it is possible to introduce three 6 -mm pins into the peri-acetabular region with an angular separation of 55 °. Studies by Johnson and Fischer [20] showed that as angular separation increases from 0 ° to 90 °, the bending stiffness also increases. The increased insertion angle of the post capital pin reduces the risk of sciatic nerve damage and improves the stability of fixation by increasing the angular separation between pins.|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} a single/double layer model to explain horizontal shifting of measured D-E hysteresis loops (imprint) for ferroelectric thin films. Such phenomenon {{can be explained by}} considering three mechanisms or their multiple effects: (1) stress induced by film/electrode lattice mismatch or <b>clamping,</b> (2) domain <b>pinning</b> induced by, e. g., oxygen vacancies, or (3) degradation of ferroelectric properties in film/electrode surface layers. First, it is found that hysteresis loops under the influence of stress exhibit large horizontal shifts with magnitudes comparable to those observed in experiments. Second, a pseudo-non-switching layer with a large coercive field is assumed to be present at the film/electrode interface in an otherwise homogeneous ferroelectric thin film, and in this case our simulation also shows a large imprint effect. Third, it is also found that time-dependent space-charge-limited conduction is likely to be one origin for the occurrence of imprint.

40|$|This Thesis investigates {{theoretically}} and experimentally the dynamical behaviour and {{the stability}} of a cylindrical shell coaxially located in a rigid cylindrical pipe and subjected to internal or annular flow. In the theoretical study, the shell could be <b>clamped</b> or <b>pinned</b> at both ends and the fluid flow in the inner shell and the annulus {{is assumed to be}} viscous and incompressible. The fluid forces consist of two parts: (i) steady viscous forces which determined using turbulent fully-developed theory; (ii) unsteady viscous forces which are derived by means of linearized Navier-Stokes equations. Shell motions are described by Flugge's modified shell equations. Two methods of solution are employed to formulate the problem. (1) Fourier transform techniques. (2) Travelling wave solutions. The objectives are to investigate the effects of unsteady viscous forces as the dynamical behaviour and stability of the system in the presence and absence of steady forces. Calculations have been conducted with a steel shell conveying water with different gap-to-radius ratios g/a$ sb{ rm i}$ = 1 / 10 and 1 - 100. First, the system is subjected to unsteady viscous forces only. It is found that, for internal flow and annular flow for g/a$ sb{ rm i}$ = 1 / 10, the effects of viscosity on {{the stability of}} the system are insignificant; however, for the smaller gap (g/a$ sb{ rm i}$ = 1 / 100), those effects are more pronounced, rendering the system more stable. When both steady and unsteady viscous forces are applied, the results are quite different from the previous case. For internal flow, the system becomes more annular flow, the system loses stability at much lower velocities for both gap-systems. In the experimental study, the flow is only annular. The shell could be clamped at both ends or clamped at one end and free at the other. For the clamped-clamped shell, the system loses stability by divergence (buckling) as predicted by linear theory. However, coupled-mode flutter was never observed experimentally. Clamped-free shells, on the other hand, lose stability by flutter...|$|R
40|$|The {{cruciate}} ligaments contain mechanoreceptors which putatively {{contribute to}} knee function and dysfunction. However, {{the interpretation of}} studies showing neural responses to traction loads applied to the cat cranial cruciate ligament (CCL-analogous to the anterior cruciate ligament in humans) depends upon demonstrating that non-CCL periarticular receptors are not stimulated. We assessed the capability to rigidly fix the knee against traction loads applied to the feline CCL. The tibia and femur were fixed either with <b>clamps</b> or Steinmann <b>pins.</b> Motion of the bones was monitored with liquid metal strain gauges (LMSG) and {{the activity of the}} posterior articular nerve (PAN) was recorded while traction loads of up to 20 - 30 N were applied to the CCL. Joint afferents recorded from the PAN were insensitive to the CCL loads in the rigidly fixed preparation. Motion of the proximal tibia and distal femur was less than 100 micrometers for both methods of fixation, with neither method demonstrating more rigid fixation. In contrast, we observed vigorous discharges with focused light pressure on the capsule and under conditions allowing 200 - 500 micrometers of tibial displacement on the femur. This suggests that clinically undetectable instability may give rise to aberrant mechanoreceptor activity contributing to dysfunction...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{advances}} in plastic surgery have significantly improved {{the outcome of}} severe open tibial fractures. An improved understanding of cutaneous blood supply combined with {{advances in}} microsurgical techniques has led to reliable coverage of large soft tissue defects by either local or free tissue transfer, and {{a significant reduction in}} the incidence of deep infection. The method of skeletal stabilization of open tibial fractures remains controversial. Although intramedullary nailing (IMN) is increasingly used for the stabilization of both closed and open tibial diaphyseal fractures, we advise caution in the use of IMN in severe open fractures because of the high risk of deep sepsis. We believe that external fixation continues to have {{a key role in the}} stabilization of the more severe open tibial fractures, particularly heavily contaminated injuries, fractures associated with significant bone loss, and cases associated with a high risk of infection. However, the use of external fixation in open fractures demands a close cooperation between orthopaedic and plastic surgeons to maximize wound access without compromising skeletal stability. We advocate unilateral external fixation with individual <b>pin</b> <b>clamps</b> and multiple longitudinal bars for stable open fractures with minimal bone loss. Improved materials, modern surgical techniques, and close postfixation monitoring of fracture healing have reduced the incidence of problems such as pin-site infection and loosening, delayed union, and malunion. The advent of the Ilizarov method and small wire circular external fixation has rationalized the management of the open tibial fracture associated with significant bone loss and reduced the need for autogenous bone grafting. We prefer local or free tissue transfer by plastic surgeons rather than the transport of poor quality soft-tissues that accompanies the Ilizarov method. The ability to reliably reconstruct large soft-tissue and bone defects allows an aggressive debridement, similar to a radical tumor resection, which is essential to prevent deep infection...|$|R
40|$|The {{aeroelastic}} {{stability of}} beams and plates in three-dimensional flows is explored as the elastic and aerodynamic parameters are varied. First principal energy methods {{are used to}} derive the structural equations of motion. The structural models are coupled with a three-dimensional linear vortex lattice model of the aerodynamics. An aeroelastic model with the beam structural model is used to explore the transition between different fixed boundary conditions {{and the effect of}} varying two non-dimensional parameters, the mass ratio μ and aspect ratio H^*, for a beam with a fixed edge normal to the flow. The trends matched previously published theoretical and experimental data, validating the current aeroelastic model. The transition in flutter velocity between the <b>clamped</b> free and <b>pinned</b> free configuration is a non-monotomic transition, with the lowest flutter velocity coming with a finite size spring stiffness. Next a plate-membrane model is used to explore the instability dynamics for different combinations of boundary conditions. For the specific configuration of the trailing edge free and all other edges clamped, the sensitivity to the physical parameters shows that decreasing the streamwise length and increasing the tension in the direction normal to the flow can increase the onset instability velocity. Finally the transition in aeroelastic instabilities for non-axially aligned flows is explored for the cantilevered beam and three sides clamped plate. The cantilevered beam configuration transitions from an entirely bending motion when the clamped edge is normal to the flow to a typical bending/torsional wing flutter when the clamped edge is aligned with the flow. As the flow is rotated the transition to the wing flutter occurs when the flow angle is only 10 deg from the perfectly normal configuration. With three edges clamped, the motion goes from a divergence instability when the free edge is aligned with the flow to a flutter instability when the free edge is normal to the flow. The transition occurs at an intermediate angle. Experiments are carried out to validate the beam and plate elastic models. The beam aeroelastic results are also confirmed experimentally. Experimental values consistently match well with the theoretical predictions for both the aeroelastic and structural models. Thesi...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2004 Steel {{wire rope}} is the {{accepted}} standard in logging. It is strong, durable, stiff, and dependable in the logger's arsenal. However, {{steel wire rope}} has several disadvantages: its strength to weight ratio is low; it is difficult and time-consuming to splice; and used wire ropes contain jaggers. Ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMW-PE) braided rope has potential to replace steel wire rope. The offshore mooring and shipping industries have appreciated it for years. Characteristics such as a specific gravity less than one (it floats!), high flexibility, low stretch, and ease of splicing make the synthetic rope useful. At equivalent diameters, synthetic rope has an equal or greater breaking strength to that of steel wire rope, but at 1 / 7 the weight. This thesis is {{an investigation of the}} end connectors for the unique physical, mechanical, and thermal properties of UHMW-PE 12 -strand braided rope that make this technology of interest in logging applications. This studied focused on three diameter classes of the synthetic rope that are common to logging operations: 3 / 8 ", 9 / 16 ", and 5 / 8 ". Within each diameter class there were five different spools representing separate production runs. A randomized complete block design was used with each diameter class and the corresponding five spools a separate population. Following the laboratory tests, the breaking strengths were compared to the buried eye splice. Three types of end connectors were evaluated during this pilot study. They are identified as spliced, adhesives, and dry hardware. Spliced end connections provided consistent performance in breaking strengths. The end connections with adhesives had variable strength performance laboratory tests and are therefore not recommended. Within the dry hardware end connections, the pinned nubbin and knuckle link provided the highest breaking strength relative to the buried eye splice. This project has accomplished its objectives. It was the first extensive study on end connections specifically designed for synthetic rope. New end connections were developed and steel wire rope connections were modified to meet the strength and usability criteria for timber harvesting operations. Suitable end connections for forest operations were: buried eye splice, Whoopie Sling, long splice, rope <b>clamps,</b> knuckle link, <b>pinned</b> nubbin, and Y-splice. These end connections suitable for use with forest operations were identified and recommended user guidelines were given.

30|$|Bilateral CT scan is the {{available}} method {{to confirm the}} incongruence of the lateral malleolus in the incisura fibularis tibiae [9, 13]. The radius of the distal fibula increases distally of the incisura fibularis tibiae, leading to lateralization of the external malleolus and widening of the ankle mortise [9]. Fibular malrotation is difficult to visualize on plain radiographs. If rotational malalignment is suspected, a CT scan with three-dimensional reconstruction should be considered [2, 8, 20, 23, 27, 28]. MRI examination is not necessary, but it can detect interposition of soft tissue, which may also be detected perioperatively. MRI has {{the added benefit of}} articular cartilage assessment [8, 9, 28]. Secondary reconstruction is indicated in the presence of reasonable ankle function and even in the presence of arthritic changes [7, 9]. The optimal time to perform reconstruction has not been defined clearly. Arthritic changes may be severe already after several months or may be minimal even after 2 or 3  years [12, 17, 26]. The period between the initial trauma and correction is not affecting clinical outcome, but correcting the malunion soon after the diagnosis and before osteoarthritis has developed is recommended. (Table  5) [20, 26, 28] The goal of any reconstructive intervention for malunion is to restore the anatomical alignment, joint congruency and joint stability of the ankle. Reconstruction may reduce the progression of degenerative changes and can decrease the symptoms of arthritis by decreasing instability and load on the arthritic locations of the joint [8, 12, 17, 28]. In most cases, reconstructive surgery consists of lengthening and derotation of the distal fibula. Three types of osteotomies have been described. Oblique or Z-osteotomies of the fibula are advised for correction of shortening and external rotation less than 10 °. An oblique osteotomy through the old fracture is only indicated for a Weber B fracture and allows better correction but is difficult to perform. Transverse osteotomy is indicated for malunion after Weber C fracture and is always performed above the syndesmosis [8]. If external rotation is exceeding 10 °, a transverse osteotomy allows an easier derotation and another benefit of the transverse osteotomy is the significant amount of lengthening that can be achieved [12, 17, 28]. A laminar spreader, a <b>pin</b> <b>clamp</b> and an AO compression device can be used as distractors for fibular lengthening [7, 9, 12, 17, 28, 31]. The secret of a successful reconstruction is the anatomic positioning of the external malleolus in the incisura fibularis tibiae. Debridement of the syndesmotic scar tissue is absolutely necessary to be able to lengthen the fibula, otherwise the fibula cannot be pushed downwards to the tibiofibular joint. After debridement, if there are still remaining fibres of the syndesmosis, the ankle may be stable, otherwise a syndesmotic position screw has to be placed, e.g., through the plate used to fix the osteotomy. If syndesmotic injury is suspected on direct visualization during surgery or by C-arm stress views, syndesmotic fixation by noncannulated fully threaded cortical screws through four cortices is recommended [8, 9, 20]. Bone grafts are advised to fill an osteotomy gap of more than 3  mm [20]. Choices of bone grafts vary between structural allografts or iliac crest structural autografts or cancellous bone autografts [32]. Cancellous graft out of the supramalleolar area is most often sufficient.|$|R
