50|$|The PM {{modulation}} index is small, {{on the order}} of 1 radian, so the modulated signal more closely resembled double sideband amplitude modulation (AM) except for the carrier phase. A PM signal can be approximated for analysis purposes as an AM signal with the carrier (and only the carrier) rotated 90 degrees from its original phase. One important difference is that in AM, the <b>carrier</b> <b>component</b> has a constant amplitude as the sidebands vary with modulation while in PM the total signal (the envelope) is constant amplitude. This means that PM shifts power from the carrier to the information-carrying sidebands with modulation, and at some modulation indices the carrier can disappear completely.

50|$|In telecommunications, {{a carrier}} wave, carrier signal, or just carrier, is a {{waveform}} (usually sinusoidal) that is modulated (modified) with an input signal {{for the purpose}} of conveying information. This carrier wave usually has a much higher frequency than the input signal does. The purpose of the carrier is usually either to transmit the information through space as an electromagnetic wave (as in radio communication), or to allow several carriers at different frequencies to share a common physical transmission medium by frequency division multiplexing (as, for example, a cable television system). The term is also used for an unmodulated emission {{in the absence of any}} modulating signal. Most radio systems in the 20th century used frequency modulation (FM) or amplitude modulation (AM) to make the carrier carry information. The frequency of a radio or television station is actually the carrier wave's frequency. However, because the information transmitted by a radio signal is not at the carrier frequency itself but contained in sidebands on either side of the carrier, the energy of the <b>carrier</b> <b>component</b> is not useful in transmitting the information. Therefore, in many modern modulation methods the carrier is not transmitted. For example, in single-sideband modulation (SSB), the carrier is suppressed (and in some forms of SSB, eliminated). The carrier must be reintroduced at the receiver by a beat frequency oscillator (BFO).|$|E

Several works have been proposed in the literature to address Carrier Components assignment to mobile users in LTE-A using Channel Quality Indicator, quality of service and traffic types.
