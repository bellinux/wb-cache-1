During southwest monsoon, which occurs from May - September, wind blows from southwesterly direction bringing copious rain to India and the surrounding regions. Subsequently wind gradually reverses and the northeast monsoon sets in during November - February. As a result of these, the oceanographic conditions also undergo changes. During southwest monsoon, the currents in the Arabian sea and the Bay of Bengal broadly follow a <b>clockwise</b> <b>direction,</b> which results in southward flow along west coast and northward flow along east coast of India. During northeast monsoon, currents become <b>counter</b> <b>clockwise</b> and the <b>direction</b> of coastal currents also reverses...|$|R

40|$|Transducing {{frequencies}} of phage P 22 lysates prepared from Salmonella typhimurium exponential cultures in minimal and nutrient broth media were compared. The {{assumption is that}} cells grown in a minimal medium will have one replication fork per replication unit, but cells in nutrient broth will have multiple replication forks; therefore, the frequency of genetic markers near the origin of replication will be higher in the nutrient broth culture. Analysis of transduction showed a gradient of marker frequencies from the highest (the cysG-ilv region) to the lowest (purE-trpB region) in both <b>clockwise</b> and <b>counter</b> <b>clockwise</b> <b>directions.</b> This supports our previous observation that chromosome replication proceeds bidirectionally from the origin between cysG (109 min on S. typhimurium map) and ilv (122 min) to a terminus in purE-trpB region (20 to 53 min). Since this method avoids possible artifacts of other methods, the results are assumed to reflect the sequence of chromosome replication in exponentially growing cells. Evidence {{for the existence of}} multiple replication forks in nutrient broth-grown cells was supported by the following: (i) the marker frequency data fitted the assumption of multiple replication fork formation; (ii) residual deoxyribonucleic acid increase after inhibition of protein synthesis to complete a round of chromosome synthesis which was 44 % in cells grown in a minimal medium and 82 % in those in nutrient broth; (iii) segregation patterns of the 3 H-thymidine-labeled chromosome strands during subsequent growth in non-radioactive medium were studied by autoradiography, and the number of replication points per chromosome per cell was estimated as 5. 6 for the nutrient broth culture and 2. 5 for the minimal medium culture. These data support a model of symmetrical and bidirectional chromosome replication...|$|R
40|$|The DC Motor is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used actuator for producing continuous movement whose speed of rotation can easily be controlled, making them ideal for use in applications where speed control, servo type control, and/or positioning is required. In many applications, DC motor is required to be rotated in <b>clockwise</b> and <b>counter</b> <b>clockwise</b> <b>directions.</b> For this purpose H Bridge is designed. H-Bridge circuits are popular circuit for Direct Current (DC) Motor and make it turn. It’s called H- Bridge because it looks like the capital “H” on classical schematics. The ability of H-bridge circuit is that motor can be driven forward or backward at any speed. Although lots of work has been done on development of H-bridge controller for electrical drives but during analysis it has been found that, during direction change of electrical drives using H-bridge controller drive suffers from oscillations in the steady state. Different strategies are available for the speed regulation of electrical drives but cannot able to provide efficient regulation in case of H-bridge controller. The main cause behind this deficiency, found during analysis is the harmonics presented in the armature current. This paper presents a technique for efficient harmonics reduction based three arms H-bridge speed controller for DC motor speed control using Hysteresis Controlled Synchronized Pulse Generator (HCSPG) technique. This paper first presents the development of Hysteresis Controlled Synchronized Pulse Generator (HCSPG) technique for three phase operation using Matlab Simulink, which then interfaced with the three arms H bridge controlled DC motor using the Matlab Simulink. The speed of DC motor is controlled through the controlling of firing angles of power semiconductor switch using HCPPG. The proposed techniques basically deals with the generation of controlled voltage for three arms H bridge followed by HCSPG which generates controlled pulses with reference to speed obtained at the output for firing. The model developed uses controlled pulses generated by HCSPG hence shows the ability to provide high harmonics reduction efficiency. We also concluded that the proposed controller will achieve the shorter settling time and also lower overshoot and steady state error...|$|R
40|$|Continuous {{models for}} a fluted twist drill are {{developed}} to study its static and dynamic bending characteristics. The static model is numerically simulated within Matlab for point loads at the free {{end of a}} twist drill. The bending curves are plotted and the bending stiffness of a twist drill is estimated. Effect of orientation of the spirally fluted cross-section at the fixed end on end deflection is studied. Characteristic bending curves for one pitch length of drill are plotted and region of minimum deflection is identified. Dynamic model is numerically simulated in Matlab over a range of rotating speeds and the first two natural frequencies and corresponding mode shapes are identified for the twist drill. New formulation for estimation of work stiffness is proposed considering the interaction of drill with the hole-wall. A new lumped mass model for studying lateral vibration behavior of the twist drill is developed using this work stiffness. The bending stiffness and fundamental natural frequency estimated using continuous models above and work stiffness calculated using proposed formulation are used in this new model. This model is numerically simulated in Matlab for different set of parameters and drill orbital motions are obtained. Results are analyzed to study the influence of various parameters on dynamics of drill and an explanation is given for generation of lobed holes and drill wandering phenomenon and surface roughness. Torsional stiffness of set of twist drills in <b>clockwise</b> and <b>counter</b> <b>clockwise</b> <b>directions</b> are measured experimentally in order to verify the stiffness symmetry. Appearance of cutting resistance when direction of twist coincides with the direction of cutting leads to periodic change in torsional stiffness of the twist drill during actual drilling. Lumped mass model is developed wherein {{the effect of this}} periodic change in torsional stiffness on torsional vibration is studied. Numerical simulations are carried out in Matlab for stiffness change of bilinear and combined linear and half sinusoidal nature. Lateral deflection of drill against hole wall is always associated {{with a small amount of}} angular twist. Lumped mass model to study bending-torsional coupling is developed. Numerical simulations are carried out in Matlab and results are compared with results for uncoupled torsional model...|$|R

50|$|Nappes of the Flysch Belt were thrusted due to {{subduction}} {{of their}} basement and later formed and fold and thrust belt. Character of the lithosphere in former Flysch basins (oceanic, suboceanic or continental) {{is a matter}} of debate. Deformation of the belt was gradual. Area of the Magura Basin was deformed in the Upper Oligocene to Badenian (Middle Miocene). Silezian and Ždánice units were deformed in Karpatian to Lower Badenian. Moldavide Flysch was deformed since Burdigalian, especially in Sarmatian and Badenian. Internal nappes show older Upper Cretaceous deformation. Subduction of the Flysch Belt basement was generally south verging, internal units were therefore thrust over the external ones from the south to north (in the Western sector) or West to East (in Eastern sector). The Tertiary shortening of Flysch Belt is approximately 130-135 km. Closure of the basins was connected with motion of Inner Carpathian crustal blocks so called leteral extrusion to the East and Northeast and intensive Calc-alkaline volcanism in the Carpathian internal zones. Extrusion together with the movement into the “Carpathian embayment” was coeval with prominent rotation of Western Carpathian units in <b>counter</b> <b>clockwise</b> <b>direction</b> (up to 90°) and clockwise rotation of Eastern Carpathian units. Loading of Flysch zone nappes forced subsidence in its foreland causing formation of Carpathian foredeep.

5000|$|The beta angle (...) is a {{measurement}} {{that is used}} most notably in spaceflight. The beta angle determines the percentage of time an object such as a spacecraft in low Earth orbit (LEO) spends in direct sunlight, absorbing solar energy. Beta angle {{is defined as the}} angle between the orbital plane of the spacecraft and the vector to the sun (i.e., which direction the Sun is shining from). The beta angle is the smaller angle (there are two angles) between the Sun vector (where the Sun is shining from in the sky) and the plane of the object's orbit. Note that the beta angle does not define a unique orbit plane; all satellites in orbit with a given beta angle at a given altitude have the same exposure to the Sun, even though they may be orbiting in completely different planes around the Earth. The beta angle varies between +90° and −90°, and the direction the satellite revolves around the body it orbits determines whether the beta angle sign is positive or negative. An imaginary observer standing on the Sun defines a beta angle as positive if the satellite in question orbits in a <b>counter</b> <b>clockwise</b> <b>direction</b> and negative if it revolves clockwise. The maximum amount of time that a satellite in a normal low Earth orbit mission can spend in the Earth's shadow occurs at a beta angle of zero.
