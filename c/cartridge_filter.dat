50|$|<b>Cartridge</b> <b>filter</b> {{technology}} {{was invented in}} the mid-1960s, cartridge filters have a large surface areas enabling them to operate for long periods. <b>Cartridge</b> <b>filter</b> systems also permit better water flow - thus, placing less strain on the filter pump. These types of filters are also easiest to clean by using a flow of high-pressure water from a hose. The filters are made of polyester or other material that can provide a superfine filtering surface. The pleats {{are the key to}} the filter's operation. The tight pleats, or folds, allow for a large amount of material to be used in a small container. The more material used, the larger the surface area available to capture dirt or debris from the water. The fabric catches and holds the impurities until the filter can be cleaned or replaced. There 3 parts to a <b>cartridge</b> <b>filter</b> construction,end caps (made of plastic) core structure to provide strength (most often PVC) and the pleated media (most often polyester with a continuously graded fixed pore structure, these cartridges provide pre- and final filtration within the same cartridge resulting in lower overall filtration and disposal cost.|$|E

The original pressure drops of these filters were similar but the pressure drops at a steady state were different. Fractional efficiency was used to study the separation performance of <b>cartridge</b> <b>filters.</b> Droplets at the outlet of the filters had small diameters, no more than 3 µm, but were very numerous. The effect of filtration velocity on gas-liquid separation performance was analyzed. Higher filtration velocity indicated better gas-liquid separation performance.

40|$|Transparent exopolymer {{particles}} (TEP), natural organic matter, and bacterial {{concentrations in}} feedwater are important {{factors that can}} lead to membrane biofouling in seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) systems. Two methods for controlling these concentrations in the feedwater prior to pretreatment have been suggested; use of subsurface intake systems or placement of the intake at a greater depth in the sea. These proposed solutions were tested at two SWRO facilities located along the Red Sea of Saudi Arabia. A shallow well intake system was very effective in reducing the algae and bacterial concentrations and somewhat effective in reducing TEP concentrations. An intake placed at a depth of 9. m below the surface was found to have limited impact on improving water quality compared to a surface intake. The algae and bacteria concentration in the feedwater (deep) was lower compared to the surface seawater, but the overall TEP concentration was higher.

5000|$|Chemical {{treatment}} of sediment, commonly called an active treatment system, {{is a relatively}} new form of sediment control for the construction industry. It is designed to reduce turbidity in nearby water bodies and involves collection of sediment-laden stormwater in a basin or tank, and adding a chemical flocculant. An example video of chemical dosing on slow settling solids is on YouTube. [...] This causes the sediment to settle so it can be more easily removed from the water. Some of the flocculent chemicals used for sediment treatment are chitosan and polymers such as polyacrylamide. The water is then pumped through a removal system, such as a Siltbuster, sand or <b>cartridge</b> <b>filter,</b> prior to discharge. Chemical sediment control is currently used on some construction sites around the United States and Europe, typically larger sites where there is a high potential for damage to nearby streams.|$|E

40|$|Pleated {{membrane}} <b>cartridge</b> <b>filters</b> {{are used}} extensively throughout a typical bioprocess. They {{are exposed to}} a range of operating conditions and feedstocks. Discrepancies between the performance of the flat sheet membrane and pleated membrane have previously been identified, although little has been done to fully characterise the effects of pleating. As current scale-up techniques use the flat sheet membrane to predict the performance of the large-scale pleated cartridge, the discrepancy in performance between flat sheet and pleated cartridge leads to inaccuracy in scale-up. This inaccuracy is accounted for by over-sizing of the equipment. In turn this reduces the efficiency of the bioprocess and increases capital costs. At the present time no accurate and reliable scale-up methodology exists that accounts for the effects of pleating. A systematic investigation into the effect of pleating has been conducted. By varying the key pleat characteristics: pleat height, type and packing density, the impact upon cartridge performance of these characteristics has been determined.

40|$|Serious {{membrane}} fouling has been experienced in a seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) plant {{situated on the}} Red Sea coast of Saudi Arabia. Four different operation trials were made (in four phases under normal and modified process conditions) {{to find out the}} optimum conditions that would minimize {{membrane fouling}}. The first trial included normal plant operation, where the coagulant (polyelectrolyte) is dosed upstream and sodium metabisulfite (SBS) downstream the media filter, ahead of the micron <b>cartridge</b> <b>filter</b> (CF). During the second trial the coagulant dosing point was shifted close to the seawater intake pump providing increased residence time for proper coagulation prior to filtration.

The virus concentrator system consists of four cartridge filters, in which the three first one are clarifiers, where the contaminants are removed physically, without significant virus loss at this stage. The last <b>cartridge</b> <b>filter</b> is impregnated with ferric hydroxide gel, where the virus is adsorbed. After the required volume of water has been processed, the last filter is removed from the system and the viruses are recovered from the gel, using 1 liter of glycine/NaOH buffer, at pH 11. Immediately the eluate is clarified through series of cellulose acetate membranes mounted in a 142 mm Millipore filter. For the second step of virus concentration, HC 1 1 N is added slowly to the eluate to achieve pH 3. 5 - 4.
