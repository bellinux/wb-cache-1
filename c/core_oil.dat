This study explores the socio-economic and infrastructural role that Sekondi-Takoradi, the nearest big city to the Jubilee oil field, is playing to facilitate oil activities offshore, although it has no formal government recognition as Ghana’s oil city. Cluster theory and structural functionalist theory are used together with the concepts of cities and infrastructure to analyze results. The study uses the snowballing method to select 23 informants from a network of oil companies and oil service providers, government institutions and relevant associations. Interview guides were used to obtain primary data while observation and figures were used for elaboration. Findings indicate that Sekondi-Takoradi is evolving as a location for an oil industry cluster.

40|$|A {{study on}} high-viscosity {{oil-water}} flow in horizontal pipes {{has been conducted}} applying experimental, mechanism analysis and empirical modelling, and CFD simulation approaches. A horizontal 1 inch flow loop was modified by adding a designed sampling section to achieve water holdup measurement. Experiments on high-viscosity oil-water flow were conducted. Apart from the data obtained in the present experiments, raw data from previous experiments conducted in the same research group was collated. From the experimental investigation, {{it is found that}} that the relationship between the water holdup of water-lubricated flow and input water volume fraction is closely related to the <b>oil</b> <b>core</b> concentricity and <b>oil</b> fouling on the pipe wall. The water holdup is higher than the input water volume fraction only when the <b>oil</b> <b>core</b> is about concentric. The pressure gradient of water-lubricated flow can be one to two orders of magnitude higher than that of single water flow. This increased frictional loss is closely related to oil fouling on the pipe wall. Mechanism analysis and empirical modelling of oil-water flow were conducted. The ratio of the gravitational force to viscous force was proposed to characterise liquid-liquid flows in horizontal pipes into gravitational force dominant, viscous force dominant and gravitational force and viscous force comparable flow featured with different basic flow regimes. For viscous force dominant flow, an empirical criterion on the formation of stable water-lubricated flow was proposed. Existing empirical and mechanistic models for the prediction of water holdup and/or pressure gradient were evaluated with the experimental data; the applicability of different models is demonstrated. Three-dimensional CFD modelling of oil-water flow was performed using the commercial CFD code Fluent. The phase configurations calculated from the CFD model show a fair agreement with those from experiments and mechanism analysis. The velocity distribution of core annular flow is characterised with nearly constant velocity across the <b>oil</b> <b>core</b> when the <b>oil</b> viscosity is significantly higher than the water viscosity, indicating that the high-viscosity <b>oil</b> <b>core</b> flows inside the water as a solid body.

30|$|The extreme {{heterogeneity}} of carbonate reservoirs {{in the form}} of fracture corridors and super-permeability thief zones present challenges to the efficient sweep of oil in both secondary and tertiary recovery operations. In such reservoirs, conformance control is crucial to ensure injected water and any EOR chemicals optimally contact the remaining oil with minimal throughput. Foam-based conformance control is a relatively new technology especially its use for deep diversion in high-salinity and high-temperature conditions. In this work, a laboratory study was conducted to develop and evaluate a foam-based conformance control technology for application in a high-salinity and high-temperature carbonate. Foaming agents (surfactants) were first screened for their suitability with regard to reservoir temperature and salinity where properties such as foamability and foam stability were measured. The best performing surfactants were then used to study the foam-induced mobility reduction across a core composite. The experiments were conducted at reservoir conditions. Foam stability and decay were also investigated in those permeability reduction experiments. Brine and crude oil were injected after foam formation where observed pressure drops allowed quantification of foam stability and decay; hence, the sustainability of mobility reduction. Finally, the potential improvement in reservoir contact and hence oil recovery were examined by oil displacement experiments conducted in specially prepared heterogeneous composites. For the studied conditions of high salinity and high temperature, foaming agents of the amphoteric family as well as one manufacturer proprietary surfactants blend were found suitable in terms of salt tolerance and foam stability. Using the proprietary blend and without oil in core, the generated foam reduced fluids mobility by a factor of 12. The attained mobility reduction was lower in presence of oil but was still acceptable for flow diversion purposes. Using the proprietary blend and with oil in core, the generated foam reduced fluids mobility by a factor of 6 (compared to 12 without oil in <b>core).</b> <b>Oil</b> recovery improvement with foam placement was also found to be significant. These results demonstrate the potential of foams for carbonates with harsh salinity and temperature conditions.|$|E
40|$|Transportation of very viscous fluids through {{pipelines}} {{is a real}} challenge. With {{the depletion}} of light oils in reservoirs, it becomes economically favourable to harvest heavy crude oils to contribute to meeting the ever growing energy demand. A suitable candidate for the transportation of these very viscous oil is by means of core-annular flow. Core-annular flow is a flow regime of liquid-liquid two-phase flow, where a low viscous fluid in the annulus (water) is used to lubricate a high viscous fluid in the <b>core</b> (<b>oil).</b> The pressure drop is considerably reduced compared to single phase oil flow at the same oil flow rate. In this study {{the influence of the}} oil viscosity on oil-water core-annular flow through a horizontal pipe is investigated experimentally. The fixed oil flow rate is set at 0. 35 l/s at which the watercut is varied between 9 % and 25 % and the oil kinematic viscosity is altered by heating up the oil in a range from 3000 cSt at 20 °C to 400 cSt at 50 °C. Pressure drop measurements for stable core-annular flow are recorded with an electronic pressure transducer and are scaled with the calculated pressure drop of single phase oil flow. Results for the scaled pressure drop at room temperature are compared to results by Ingen Housz et al. It is concluded that for increasing oil-water viscosity ratio, the scaled pressure drop decreases. At the highest considered viscosity ratio, the scaled pressure drop is almost independent of the watercut. Two models to predict the pressure drop (by Brauner and by Bannwart) are evaluated and deviations between the models and measurements are discussed. Visualisation by means of high-speed camera is applied, where a mirror is placed on top of the visualisation section to capture the front and top view simultaneously.

40|$|The {{existence}} of an optimum injection rate for wormhole propagation, and face dissolution at low injection rates during matrix acidizing are well established. However, little has been documented that describes how the presence of residual oil affects carbonate acidizing. This study demonstrates the impact of oil saturation on wormholing characteristics while acidizing field and outcrop cores under reservoir conditions (200 ?F). Knowledge {{of the effect of}} different saturation conditions on acid performance will contribute towards designing more effective acid treatments. Coreflood experiments at flow rates ranging from 0. 5 to 20 cm 3 /min were performed to determine the optimum injection rate for wormhole propagation when acidizing homogeneous calcite and dolomite reservoir cores, and low permeability Indiana limestone cores of dimensions 3 and 6 in. length and 1. 5 in. diameter. Absolute permeability of the cores ranged from 1 to 78 md. The study involved acidizing cores saturated with water, oil, and waterflood residual oil using 15 wt% HCl. The viscosity of the crude oil used was 3. 8 cP at 200 ?F. CAT scans were used to characterize wormholes through the cores. The concentrations of the dissolved calcium and magnesium ions were measured using Inductively Coupled Plasma?Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES) and the effluent samples were titrated to determine the concentration of the acid. HCl was effective in creating wormholes with minimal branches for <b>cores</b> with residual <b>oil</b> (Sor= 0. 4 - 0. 5) at injection rates 0. 5 to 20 cm 3 /min. Compared to brine and <b>oil</b> saturated <b>cores,</b> waterflood residual <b>oil</b> <b>cores</b> took less acid volume to cause breakthrough. Additionally, the wormholing efficiency of regular acid improved with increases in acid injection rates in the presence of residual oil.

Unlike brine saturated and <b>oil</b> saturated <b>cores,</b> waterflood residual <b>oil</b> <b>cores</b> showed no face dissolution at low acid injection rates.
