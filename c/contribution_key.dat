40|$|Chronological age {{can be an}} {{unsatisfactory}} {{method of}} discriminating between older people. The lay concept of how old people actually feel may be more useful. The aim of the analyses reported in this paper was to investigate indicators of age-identity (or subjective age) among a national random sample of people aged 65 or more years living at home in Britain. Information was initially collected by home interview and a follow-up postal questionnaire 12 – 18 months later. The age that respondents felt was a more sensitive indicator than chronological age of many indicators of the respondents ’ health, psychological and social characteristics. Multiple regression analysis showed that baseline health and functional status, and reported changes in these at follow-up, explained 20. 4 per cent of the vari-ance in self-perceived age. Adding baseline mental health (anxiety/depression), feelings and fears about ageing at follow-up explained a further 0. 8 per cent of the variance, making the total variance explained 21. 2 per cent.

40|$|Abstract. The microlensing {{candidates}} {{found in}} the first DUO season are presented here. Statistical tests show that these candidates stand well above the noise distribution. The analysis of their colours shows in addition {{that they are not}} related with pulsating variable stars. We also conclude that they are unlikely to be associated with cataclysmic variables. Unless a new class of variable objects has been discovered here, microlensing appears as the best explanation of their light curves. The latitude distribution of these candidates is different from the distribution of the other stars: it shows a large gradient which is well reproduced by a microlensing model. We conclude that this is a good signature of microlensing. The large fraction of short duration events among these candidates is rather puzzling, and cannot be reproduced, within a standard microlensing model, without a large number of brown dwarfs. However, a more sophisticated model including the amplification of unresolved stars can well reproduce the observed rates without any brown dwarfs. Consequently, we demonstrate with these data the great importance of modeling the amplification rates of unresolved stars. It is also concluded that any satisfactory study of the mass function at the faint end, should include this kind of <b>contribution.</b> <b>Key</b> words: dark matter – graviatational lensing – stars: lowmass, brown dwarfs – stars: binaries – stars: planetary systems 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{conventional}} experimental {{approaches to}} assessing pore structure characteristics (e. g. mercury intrusion porosimetry) in cement paste have difficulties in providing reliable results. This {{problem can be}} approached by geometrical statistical and mathematical methods, e. g. stereological analysis and mathematical morphological measurements. This paper deals with the application of these methods to section images of cement paste specimens and presents a representative set of results of size characterization of pore structure in cement pastes with various water cement ratios and degrees of maturity. The size characterization of pore space allows direct prediction of paste permeability with empirical relationships. However, only porosity, pore size, and eventually porosity connectivity (i. e. connected fraction of porosity) {{are taken into account}} in the conventional models for estimating permeability of cement pastes, such as the Kozeny-Carman equation and the Katz-Thompson equation. These simplified models cannot provide accurate estimation of paste permeability without significant improvements. Accurate predictions of cement paste permeability and of other transport properties require incorporating information on how the pores are interconnected, i. e., on topology characteristics of pore structure. This requirement can be fulfilled by pore network modelling, which reflects pore size distribution and the complex situation of connectivity in pore space. Potential applications of mathematical morphology methods for constructing the pore network model and thereby estimating transport properties of cement paste are also discussed in this <b>contribution.</b> <b>Key</b> words: Size characterisation, pore structure, transport properties. ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Ultraclean {{field and}} {{laboratory}} procedures {{were used to}} examine trace element concentrations in northern Alaskan snow. Sixteen soluble trace elements and total mercury were determined in snow core samples representing the annual snowfall deposited during the 1993 – 94 season at two sites in the Prudhoe Bay oil field and nine sites in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (Arctic NWR). Results indicate there were two distinct point sources for trace elements in the Prudhoe Bay oil field—a source associated with {{oil and gas production}} and a source associated with municipal solid-waste incineration. Soluble trace element concentrations measured in snow from the Arctic NWR resembled concentrations of trace elements measured elsewhere in the Arctic using clean sample-collection and processing techniques and were consistent with deposition resulting from widespread arctic atmospheric contamination. With the exception of elements associated with sea salts, there were no orographic or east-west trends observed in the Arctic NWR data, nor were there any detectable influences from the Prudhoe Bay oil field, probably because of the predominant easterly and northeasterly winds on the North Slope of Alaska. However, regression analysis on latitude suggested significant south-to-north increases in selected trace element concentrations, many of which appear unrelated to the sea salt <b>contribution.</b> <b>Key</b> words: snow, Prudhoe Bay, Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, trace element concentrations, point sources RÉSUMÉ.
