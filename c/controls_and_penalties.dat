50|$|Following World War I, the Hague Conference and The Treaty of Versailles {{began to}} set {{international}} agreements on drug laws (Berridge, 1999). Britain signed the treaties {{on behalf of}} Australia, and from this point on, Australia's State and Territory governments have created their own laws and policies relating to illicit drug use. In the 1920s and 1930s, there was an increasingly internationalist approach to drug policy, overseen by the League of Nations, with Australia enacting a series of increasingly strict drug laws (Mandelson, 1987), despite the low incidence of illicit drug use in Australia during this period. Although Australia was initially influenced by the strict illicit drug <b>controls</b> <b>and</b> <b>penalties</b> promoted by the League of Nations, and subsequently the United Nations; {{following the end of}} the World War 2, Australia's illicit drug policies became increasingly influenced by the United States, due to the United States' increasingly pro-active participation in United Nations policy making and large financial contribution to United Nations budgets. Hence, the strong British influence on Australia's drug policies waned, and Australia's illicit drug policies shifted from a health and social focus to an increased focus on law enforcement and criminal justice.|$|E
40|$|After {{centuries in}} which control and {{punishment}} {{formed the basis}} of policies designed to combat tax evasion, the results in many world economies are far from expected. Paying taxes is a resisted action, a few people are predisposed to do so voluntarily and that bias is reduced if people perceive inefficiencies from the State. When that happens, <b>controls</b> <b>and</b> <b>penalties,</b> although necessary, become insufficient and it is necessary to create parallel incentives. This research shows evidence of the usefulness of positive incentives and the need to replace the traditional control scheme and penalties for a control scheme, punishments and rewards.

The work selected as a subject of the study agri-environmental contract and its characteristics and other institutions, of which maturity influence the effects of that policy. The main goal was to identify these characteristics of contract and assess their balance in relation to the purpose and subject of the contract and long term benefit of both sides of the contract. Attitudes on the maturity of the contract characteristics have been collected between farmers and state administrators in survey (as sites of the contract) on national level and also in four regional case studies. It was revealed that most of the contract characteristics were not mature enough to serve to long term benefit for both sides of the contract, which decreases potential effectiveness of the agri-environmental policy. These are for example: information availability, trust between sides of the contract, tendencies to strategic behaviour, power distribution in the contract, sharing risks in the contract, adequacy of compensation level. <b>Control</b> <b>and</b> <b>penalty</b> system was regarded as rather adequate. Not mature institutions and characteristics of the contract increase transaction costs of both sides of the contract and decrease willingness to renew the contracts in future.

40|$|Introduction. Dependent {{behavior}} {{represents a}} strong homeostasis {{of the family}} of an addict. Objective. The aim of our research is to record and explore irregularities during the addicts’ growth, as well as the specific type of family relations in the addicts’ family. Methods. For research purposes a general questionnaire was used on growth and development, and GRADIR questionnaire on the assessment of family relationships. Results. Our results indicate that delinquent behavior is often found with the addicts before the occurrence of abuse. A significant dysfunctional family of addicts was detected. Families with an addict were not substantially damaged or altered in terms of emotional exchange, but in their structure that enhanced dysfunction leading to addictive behavior. Conclusion. Emotional investments without <b>control,</b> prohibitions <b>and</b> <b>penalties,</b> contribute to a lack of consciousness that disturbs the process of socialization. Due to the apparent <b>control</b> <b>and</b> the apparent support, the addicts do not have structured organization and socialization.

30|$|Some {{proponents of}} the {{rainforest}} policy suggest taking the business as usual path of deforestation emissions as a reference point, using deforestation rates of the past 5 – 10  years adjusted by {{the current state of}} politics. In this case, the country would not have to change its politics much at all, and relatively vague, the approach offers opportunities for manipulations. The US proposition, therefore, would set into place a stricter standard. The permissible deforestation quantity would be continually lowered over time until zero emission was reached after 20  years. This annual decline of the emissions would induce both a high binding effect with regard to the conservation strategy as well as involving the rainforest country in global climate policy. It would require forest rights be reformed. Illegal forest clearings would have to be stopped and legal deforestations limited. Instruments to accomplish this could include defining conservation areas, clarifying and restricting individual deforestation rights, more effective <b>controls</b> of, <b>and</b> <b>penalties</b> against, breaking the law, limiting government funding of logging as well as creating a sustainable infrastructure and settlement policy.|$|R

For definiteness, flow past a circular cylinder is considered, but the design approach presented here is applicable to other flow control problems. Two finite-dimensional lower order models based on proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) of dimension N with N actuators are considered. Models I and II are obtained using <b>control</b> function <b>and</b> <b>penalty</b> function methods, respectively. Control action {{can be achieved by}} a combination of suction, injection, and synthetic jets. For the design of controllers, it is assumed that the system matrices of the POD models are unknown. Nonlinear adaptive control systems for the two models are derived. For model I, nontrivial zero-error dynamics exists, which {{play a key role in}} the stability of the closed-loop system. But for model II, global adaptive trajectory control is achieved. In the closed-loop system, the mode amplitudes asymptotically follow the reference trajectories. Simulation results for a 4 -mode POD model obtained using the penalty function method are presented. These results show that in the closed-loop system, unsteadiness in the mode amplitudes can be suppressed in spite of large uncertainties in the flow model...|$|R

40|$|In Vietnam, as in {{many other}} rapidly-developing {{countries}} in Southeast Asia, industrial estates have sprung up to provide the infrastructure that factories need. Such estates can reduce the environmental impact of the industries they support, by providing central wastewater pollution control facilities. Since there are economies of scale in wastewater treatment, sharing common facilities should reduce costs. Unfortunately, wastewater treatment is often not practised and Vietnam is currently experiencing a lot of water pollution from the factories in its industrial zones. Now a new report has highlighted why many industrial estates in Vietnam have not invested in wastewater treatment plants and why many companies still fall far short of the necessary compliance. It finds that fines for polluters are ineffective and that factors such as a lack of investment capital, and a perception that the fees charged for waste treatment are unfair, are stopping many firms from investing in wastewater treatment. It makes a number of recommendations on how this situation can be improved. These include tightening pollution monitoring and assessment and imposing stricter legislative <b>controls</b> <b>and</b> stiffer <b>penalties</b> to deter polluters. water pollution, Vietnam...|$|R

Also highlighted in the report are the serious risks resulting from mixing the drug with alcohol, MDMA, amphetamines, ephedrine and certain foods.

We study the optimal stationary distribution of the controlled process as the variance of the noise becomes vanishingly small. It is shown that depending on the relative magnitudes of the noise variance and the `running cost' for control, one can identify three regimes, in each of which the optimal control forces the invariant distribution of the process to concentrate near equilibria that can be characterized according to the regime. We also obtain moment bounds for the optimal stationary distribution. Moreover, we show that {{in the vicinity of the}} points of concentration the density of optimal stationary distribution approximates the density of a Gaussian, and we explicitly solve for its covariance matrix.
