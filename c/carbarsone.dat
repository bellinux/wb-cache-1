40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversitySeveral culture {{media were}} tested. The trichomonads multiplied only in gastric mucin-Loeffler's dried blood serum {{dissolved}} in a slight modification of Drbohlav's modified Ringer's solution. 	Among the species of intestinal trichomonads {{of the golden}} hamster that were studied only T. microti and T. wenyoni grew in the artificial culture medium. 	Several techniques of determining {{whether or not the}} hamsters were infected with trichomonads, methods of obtaining population counts, and several staining methods were presented. 	Protozoa other than T. microti and T. wenyoni were successfully cultured in the modified culture medium. 	Bacteria-free cultures of trichomonads were assured by adding to the culture medium penicillin and streptomycin in combination, and also terramycin. 	Cysts induced artificially and those found in the animal's feces were activated by placing them in a warm place or by using aqueous pancreatin solution. These cysts multiplied in the modified culture medium. 	The resistance of the intestinal trichomonads of the golden hamster to physical and chemical agents was discussed. Many antiseptics, ultraviolet light, high temperatures and low temperatures are lethal for the trichomonads. The trichomonads are resistant to X-rays. Hypotonic or hypertonic solutions of sodium chloride are destructive for these trichomonads. 	Experiments in vitro, with penicillin, streptomycin, terramycin, aureomycin, ahloromycetin, <b>Carbarsone,</b> Chiniofon, copper sulfate, Phenothiazine were described. 	Experiments in vivo, with <b>Carbarsone,</b> Chinifon, Phenothiazine, copper sulfate, Vioform, terramycin, and aureomycin were described. <b>Carbarsone</b> showed the best trichomonadicidal action per os. 	The hamsters are extremely resistant to high doses of <b>Carbarsone.</b> Prolonged administration of <b>Carbarsone</b> is harmful to animals. 	The pathogenicity of the intestinal trichomonads of the golden hamster was examined. These trichomonads are not pathogenic for man or for the hamsters. The author swallowed a mixed culture of T. microti and T. wenyoni, but no digestive abnormalities were observed subsequently...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted with}} Large White turkeys from day-old to 28 days of age. The maximum safe dietary level of <b>carbarsone</b> was at least 0. 32 percent or greater. This was {{the highest level of}} drug tested, and it did not significantly (P< 0. 05) affect any response parameter in young turkeys. Most drug levels slightly increased body weight gain, percent bone ash and improved feed efficiency as compared to the control; however, no differences among treatments were statistically significant (P< 0. 05). Data from this study clearly indicate a safety margin of at least nine or ten fold concerning the present use of <b>carbarsone</b> in turkey diets for histomoniasis or blackhead prevention...|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} 8 {{kinds of}} antitrichomonal drugs {{were examined in}} vitro for growth inhibiting effect upon 2 strains (S and H strains) of Trichomonas Vaginalis: 3 antibiotics (trichomycin, pimaricin, and azalomycin F) and 5 synthetic chemicals (<b>carbarsone,</b> chlordantoin, piperanitrozole, metronidazole and rimovazole). The parasites were inoculated in each tube containing the V-bouillon medium and different concentrations of drugs. After the incubation for 48 hours at 37 ℃, the numbers of active parasites were counted using Burker-Turk's haemacytometer, and the percentages of growthinhibition by the drugs were calculated by comparison with data in the control where no drug was added into the culture medium. The percentage data were transformed into Probit value to calculate a regression line for each strain and each drug. Then, 99. 9 % inhibiting dose (ID_) and 50 % inhibiting dose (ID_) of the drugs {{were obtained from the}} regression lines. Among the drugs tested <b>carbarsone</b> and pimaricin had rather higher ID_ and ID_, whereas trichomycin, piperanitrozole, metronidazole and nimovazole showed lower ID_ and ID_. There were statistically {{no significant difference between the}} two strains tested in ID_ as well as ID_ for each drug. In vivo experiments were also carried out to examine the therapeutic effect of drugs against the experimental abscess-formation caused by the subcutaneous inoculation of Trichomonas vaginalis to the back of mice. After the parasite inoculation the following drugs were orally treated: trichomycin, piperanitrozole, metronidazole and nimovazole. Trichomycin showed unexpectedly low therapeutic effect against the abscessformation whereas it was highly toxic to mice. On the other hand, piperanitrozole, metronidazole and nimovazole showed noticeable therapeutic effect without toxicity at a dosage of 50 mg/kg/day for 5 days...|$|E
40|$|Excystment agents (extract of Escherichia coli, living E. coli and glutamic acid) {{failed to}} cause excystment of Schizopyrenus russelli cysts in the {{presence}} of either emetine or compounds I and I 1 (structurally based on emetine). A very high percentage of the cysts excysted {{in the presence}} of the excystment agents after the removal of emetine, showing that the treated cysts were viable. Ninhydrin reaction, using a fixed amount of glutamic acid and increasing concentrations of emetine, showed progressive inhibition of colour development. This suggests the possible binding of excystment factor to emetine, thus preventing excystment. Excystment inducing property of the excystment agents could not be prevented {{in the presence of}} <b>carbarsone.</b> When the cysts were treated with sodium lauryl sulphate and then with emetine or with sodium lauryl sulphate and emetine together, there was hardly any excystment.

40|$|AbstractDientamoeba fragilis {{belongs to}} the trichomonad group of {{protozoan}} parasites {{and it has been}} implicated as a cause of gastrointestinal disease with world-wide prevalences ranging from 0. 5 % to 16 %. The majority of patients with dientamoebiasis present with gastrointestinal complaints. Chronic symptoms are common with up to a third of patients exhibiting persistent diarrhoea. Numerous studies have successfully demonstrated parasite clearance, coupled with complete resolution of clinical symptoms following treatment with various antiparasitic compounds. Treatments reported to be successful for dientamoebiasis include <b>carbarsone,</b> diphetarsone, tetracyclines, paromomycin, erythromycin, hydroxyquinolines and the 5 -nitroimidazoles, including metronidazole, secnidazole, tinidazole and ornidazole. It is of note that most current treatment data is based only on small number of case reports. No large scale double blind randomised placebo controlled trials testing the efficacy of antimicrobial agents against D. fragilis has been undertaken highlighting the need for further study. In addition there is very little in vitro susceptibility data available for the organism making some current treatment options questionable. The aim of this review is to critically discuss all treatment options currently available for dientamoebiasis...|$|E
40|$|THIS is {{to report}} 15 cases of amebic {{dysentery}} treated with neoarsphen-amine intravenously during the Japanese internment of American Prisoners of War at Camp No. 1, Cabanatuan, Philippine Islands. This drug {{was not the}} drug of choice but rather the only drug at hand {{before the arrival of}} Red Cross medical supplies in December, 1943. Although neoarsphen-amine had never been used to any appreciable extent for amebiasis, it was felt that the arsenic derived therefrom should be effective in eradicating the ameba and cysts. Arsenic is also a well known alterative, and it was be-lieved that it would stimulate the appetite which was later found to be true. Up to 1935, in a review of cases of amebiasis treated at the Mayo Clinic, it is stated that 38 patients received arsphenamine with no untoward reac-tions. 1 Six weekly doses of arsphenamine were given in those instances in which <b>carbarsone,</b> vioform or other drugs had failed to eradicate the ameba. An in vitro study of mapharsen and seven other compounds has been recently conducted. 2 It was found that of the group of chemicals studied...|$|E
40|$|A {{high-performance}} {{liquid chromatography}} (HPLC) method with UV detection was developed for the simultaneous determination of arsanilic acid, roxarsone, nitarsone, and <b>carbarsone</b> in the feeds of swine and chicken. Feed samples were extracted with methanol/ 1 % acetic acid (90 : 10, v/v) in an ultrasonic bath and the protein was precipitated with 2 % Cu(2) SO(4). The samples were further purified by solid phase extraction (SPE) on SAX cartridges. Separation was performed on a Zorbax SB-Aq C 18 HPLC column using an isocratic procedure with methanol and 1 % acetic acid (3 : 97, v/v) at a flow-rate of 0. 7 mL min(- 1), and the UV detector was set at a wavelength of 260 nm. The recoveries of organoarsenic compounds spiked at levels of 2. 20 and 200 mu g g(- 1) ranged from 81. 2 % to 91. 3 %; the inter-day relative standard deviation values were less than 7. 0 %. The limits of quantification for four organoarsenic compounds were 1. 0 - 2. 0 mu g g(- 1). This simple and fast method {{could be applied to}} the determination of multi-residues of organic arsenic compounds in animal feeds. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
30|$|Monoclonal {{antibody}} (mAb) has higher specificity {{and better}} repeatability than polyclonal antibody. Therefore, {{it is more}} suitable for the detection of the substance of a particular structure. By virtue of benefits drawn from their specific, sensitive, rapid, simple, and high-throughput characters, mAbs can be widely used in practical testing. Despite being useful, it also has some disadvantages. The approaches for preparing antibodies are mostly empirical and guided by nonstandardized protocols and individual experience [46]. During the experiment, great care has to be exercised to dilution factors and cultivation conditions {{such as the use of}} feeder cells [47]. Moreover, screening for single hybridoma cell clones that produce high-quality antibody is mainly done by ELISA. When using this method to isolate target cells, a large number of cells would be lost. This makes the whole process extremely time consuming and labor intensive [48]. Furthermore, the characteristic of antibody is vulnerable to be impacted by the feature of antigen. For example, the extent and yield of the antigen against protein’s chemical conjugation may be very important to mAb. Acevedo et al. [49] proved that combining double-chemically modified carrier proteins with hetero-functional crosslinkers allows preparing tailor-made hapten protein carrier conjugates. Wang et al. [50] prepared a generic mAb and developed a sensitive ic-ELISA for detecting phenothiazines in animal feed. The limit of detections of the method ranged from 1.1 to 15.3  μg/kg. Han et al. [51] produced an mAb with broad specificity to nitroimidazoles, dimetridazole, ipronidazole, ronidazole hydroxydimetridazole, and hydroxyipronidazole, with the IC 50 values of 4.79, 0.47, 5.97, 23.48, and 15.03  μg/L, respectively. Peng et al. [52] used arsanilic acid as a hapten, and produced the suitable mAb for simultaneously determining organoarsenic compounds including nitarsone, <b>carbarsone,</b> and arsanilic acid in animal tissue and feed.|$|E
