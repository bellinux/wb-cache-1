40|$|BACKGROUND The <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> inhaler is {{difficult}} to use correctly, synchronising actuation with inhalation being the most important problem. A breath actuated pressurised inhaler, designed to help patients with poor inhaler technique, was compared with a conventional <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> inhaler in terms of aerosol deposition and bronchodilator response. METHODS Radioaerosol deposition and bronchodilator response to 100 micrograms salbutamol were measured in 18 asthmatic patients, who inhaled from a conventional <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> inhaler by their own chosen <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> inhaler technique, from a conventional <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> inhaler by a taught <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> inhaler technique, and from a breath actuated pressured inhaler (Autohaler). RESULTS In the 10 patients who could coordinate actuation and inhalation of the inhaler on their own deposition of aerosol in the lungs and bronchodilator response were equivalent on the three study days. By contrast, in the eight patients who could not coordinate the mean (SEM) percentage of the dose deposited in the lungs with their own inhaler technique (7. 2 % (3. 4 %] was substantial lower than those attained by the taught <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> inhaler technique (22. 8 % (2. 5 %] and by Autohaler (20. 8 % (1. 7 %]. CONCLUSION Although of little additional benefit to asthmatic patients with good coordination, the Autohaler is potentially a valuable aid to those with poor coordination, and {{should be considered in}} preference to a conventional <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> inhaler in any patient whose inhaler technique is not known to be satisfactory...|$|R

With this device, regular manually operated <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> inhalers become automatic. During the study, an inhalation simulator was designed and tested with the newly developed mechatronic system. By adjusting the volume and the pressure of the vacuum tank, most human inhalation waveforms were able to simulate. As an example, regular quick-deep and slow-deep waveforms were matched within reasonable accuracy. Finally, with the help of dynamic image processing, the aerosol-release time (Tr) was carefully measured and fully discussed, including the switch-on time (Ts), the mechatronics-hysteresis (Tm) and the intentional-delay (Ti). Under slow-deep inhalation condition which is suitable for <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> inhaler medicine delivery, the switch-on flow-rate could reach as low as 10 [*]L/min, and the corresponding switch-on time was approximately 0. 20 [*]s. While the mechatronics-hysteresis depended on the brand of <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> inhaler, assuming there was no intentional-delay, the aerosol-release time could be as low as 0. 40 and 0. 60 [*]s, respectively, for two commercially available <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> inhalers studied in this article.

40|$|To {{provide better}} {{data on the}} {{production}} of secondary particles as input for treatment planning systems for carbon ion therapy, experimental studies on 12 C fragmentation in water phantoms were performed at GSI. This included also measurements on the dose contribution of secondary neutrons. Systematic data on the neutron dose behind a water target were obtained in previous measurements[1], using a WENDI-II neutron dose meter[2]. Recent studies on carbon fragmentation[3, 4] have shown that more charged particels than neutrons emerge from the target at small forward angles. At 0 ◦, the ratio of He- to H-fragments to neutrons is about 2. 6 : 1. 2 : 1. This means that a neutron <b>dose</b> <b>meter</b> placed at 0 ◦ is exposed to a mixed radiation field of charged particles and neutrons. The response of the neutron <b>dose</b> <b>meter</b> to charged particles is therefore an important question. Response functions of WENDI-II for n, p, and 4 He were calculated using the PHITS code[5]. The response {{was assumed to be}} proportional to the energy deposition in the 3 He proportional counter in the core of WENDI-II.

40|$|Following a {{literature}} survey into neutron detection methods, a conceptual {{design for a}} novel <b>dose</b> <b>meter</b> was proposed consisting {{of a pair of}} CdlnTe (ClT) detectors with a thin sandwiched layer of 6 LiF between, achieved by coating one of the detectors with 6 LiF. A detector was constructed using two 10 x 10 x 2 mm ClT detectors, of which one was coated with a 4 I-Im 6 LiF layer. Coincidence counting of the alpha particle and triton arising from the 6 U (n, a) 3 H reaction was used to reduce the gamma background. Development of this design was carried out by undertaking experimental work on a simple prototype and by conducting Geant 4 simulations. The Geant 4 simulation work included comparison of simulations with experimental data to validate the modelling work carried out. Results from this work show that neutron detection is possible using this technique, using a 6 UF layer of a few microns thickness, and that inference of neutron energy from the detector response is possible in principle. Also identified {{as a result of the}} modelling work were drawbacks and limitations with the use of ClT, notably the opacity of the 2 mm thick detectors used in the experimental work to thermal neutrons. This affected detector performance significantly, leading to detector separation playing a key role in detector efficiency, with efficiency also varying strongly with neutron field direction. The presence of neutrons was detected in a mixed neutron and gamma field, although 5 cm of lead shielding was required in order to detect a response above background. A review of the different methods of neutron detection is also presented with a discussion on their applicability to monitoring worker dose in the workplace. Having reviewed the performance of available <b>dose</b> <b>meters,</b> it has been concluded that there is scope for improved novel instruments as the response of existing instruments available has a strong energy dependence.

40|$|Exposure to arsenic has {{a number}} of known {{detrimental}} health effects but impact on pregnancy outcomes is not as widely recognized. This narrative review examines existing epidemiological evidence investigating the association between arsenic exposure via drinking water and adverse pregnancy outcomes. We reviewed published epidemiological studies from around the world on impact of chronic arsenic exposure on spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, post neonatal death, low birth weight and preterm baby. Plausible mechanisms of arsenic toxicity causing adverse pregnancy outcomes were also determined through literature review. There is convincing evidence to support the association between high inorganic arsenic exposure (> 50 ppb) and spontaneous abortion, stillbirth and low birth weight. Limitations of certain studies include study design, small sample size, recall constraints and exposure assessment. There needs to be further research investigating the <b>dose</b> <b>metered</b> impact of arsenic exposure on pregnancy outcomes. Further research on impact of low–moderate arsenic concentration exposure on pregnancy outcomes will allow for appropriate public health policy recommendations...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the work: the {{development}} of the theoretical and experimental methods of design of the gaseous equipment working processes and creating the effective constructions of the gaseous equipment on its base. Developed have been the methods of design of the constructive and functional parameters of structural elements (the reduction gear, evaporator, <b>dose</b> <b>meter,</b> mixture unit, shut-reducing equipment), the graphoanalytical model of the evaporator, matched with two-stage gaseous reducer. The industrial manufacture in the PA "Compressor" of the sets of gaseous equipment for the operation on thethinned fuel and compressed natural gas has been developed and run in.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine the}} {{influence}} of inhalation device (Autohaler versus <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> inhaler) and patients' subjective opinion towards the different devices, as well as daily frequency and duration of treatment on medication compliance. DESIGN: Prospective study measuring compliance in the same patients of the Autohaler twice daily with the <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> inhaler twice daily, as well the Autohaler twice daily with the Autohaler four times daily. SETTING: Primary health care. SUBJECTS: 34 subjects with asthma. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patients preference and compliance. RESULTS: Patients preferred the Autohaler. The percentage of patients with a negative opinion towards the <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> inhaler was 38 % compared with 12 % towards the Autohaler. The median values of the compliance rate of the Autohaler with twice and four times daily frequency were 90. 8 % (25 - 75 th percentile 61. 6 - 98. 0 %) and 78. 5 % (25 - 75 th percentile 49. 0 %- 91. 2 %), respectively (p < 0. 001). The duration of treatment period had a significant negative influence on compliance when four times daily dosage frequency was prescribed (p = 0. 05). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the devices (<b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> inhaler and Autohaler) and the patients' opinion about the devices did not significantly contribute to the compliance rates. Compliance towards the medication treatment, however, is negatively influenced by a high daily frequency...|$|R
