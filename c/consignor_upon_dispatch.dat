50|$|<b>Upon</b> <b>dispatch,</b> {{the train}} takes a slight {{downward}} grade through a right {{turn into the}} 65' lift hill. The ride's initial drop is the largest at 63' 6". This {{is followed by a}} short airtime rise, then the second hill which has the 90° right turn at the top. Two small airtime rises precede the steeply banked 180° turnaround. The returning course takes the coaster parallel to {{the first half of the}} ride, traveling through a series of bunny hills, the brake run and a short turn into the station. The total duration of the ride is about one minute with a top speed of 35 mph.|$|R
5|$|Upon {{reaching}} {{the end of}} the second queue, guests were loaded into test cars. <b>Upon</b> <b>dispatching</b> from the loading dock, the car was brought through an accelerated hill climb. Next, the car's suspension was tested over different types of road surfaces, including German and Belgian blocks & cobblestones. Next, the car's anti-lock braking system was turned off and the car tried to navigate a course of cones, knocking many over in the process. The anti-lock brakes were then turned back on and a similar cone course was navigated easily. Guests were shown a video overlay of the difference. Then, the cars were brought through 3 environmental chambers: a heat chamber, a cold chamber, and a corrosion chamber.|$|R
40|$|A GIS is a {{computer}} system capable of capturing,storing, analyzing, and displaying geographically referencedinformation. GIS works by relating information from differentsources. The power of a GIS comes from the ability to relatedifferent information in a spatial context and to reach aconclusion about this relationship. Most of the information wehave about our world contains a location reference, placing thatinformation at some point on the globe.. GeographicInformation System (GIS) {{plays an important role}} in crimemapping and analysis. GIS uses geography andcomputer-generated maps as an interface for integrating andaccessing massive amounts of location-based information. GISallows police personnel to plan effectively for emergencyresponse, determine mitigation priorities, analyse historicalevents, and predict future events. GIS can also be used to getcritical information to emergency responders <b>upon</b> <b>dispatch</b> orwhile en route to an incident to assist in tactical planning andresponse. GIS helps identify potential suspects to increaseinvestigators suspect base when no leads are evident. This paperpresents a survey on how GIS is implemented in various crimeactivities...|$|R
40|$|Distributed rate-based {{real-time}} systems, such as {{process control}} and avionics mission computing systems, {{have traditionally been}} scheduled statically. Static schedul-ing provides assurance of schedulability prior to run-time and can be implemented with low run-time overhead. However, static scheduling is brittle {{in the face of}} unantici-pated overload, and treats invocation-to-invocation variations in resource requirements inflexibly. As a consequence, processing resources are often under-utilized in the aver-age case, and the resulting systems are hard to adapt to meet new real-time processing requirements. Dynamic scheduling offers relief from the limitations of static scheduling. How-ever, dynamic scheduling often has a higher run-time cost because certain decisions are enforced on-line. Furthermore, under conditions of overload tasks can be scheduled dynamically that may never be <b>dispatched,</b> or that <b>upon</b> <b>dispatch</b> would miss their dead-lines. We review the implications of these factors on rate-based distributed systems, and posits the necessity to combine static and dynamic approaches to exploit the strengths and compensate for the weaknesses of either approach in isolation...|$|R

5000|$|The second Racer was {{designed}} by John Miller in 1927 and built by Charile Mach. Because they liked John Miller's previous work, Kennywood hired him {{to build a new}} twin or racing coaster. Brady McSwigan wanted a [...] "snappy ride that wasn't too much for mothers and children to ride." [...] It cost more than $75,000, because Miller didn't use the topography as effectively as he had with the Jack Rabbit and Pippin. The highest hill of the Racer was built in a ravine and much more lumber was required. The moebius layout is caused by the setup of the station, where the trains turn away from each other <b>upon</b> <b>dispatch.</b> When the trains meet again at the lift hill, they are already on opposite sides {{than they were in the}} station, and the tracks do not split for the remainder of the ride. The new Racer's trains were locked onto the tracks, which permitted banked curves as well as curves on the dips. Andy Vettel took the final hill out of the coaster in 1949. The loading platform's facade was redesigned in 1946 by Hindenach and in 1960 by architect Bernard Liff of Liff, Justh and Chetlin. The original front was restored in 1990.|$|R

30|$|It is to {{be noted}} that fixed cost for various Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) {{incurred}} due to primary equipment cost and installation does not depend <b>upon</b> power <b>dispatch</b> and can {{be treated as a}} constant. Also for DERs which requires a converter for AC/DC conversion the cost of converters is included in the fixed costs. The main aim of the cost function formulation is to consider the cost of dispatchable units, such as diesel generator, cost of non dispatchable units, e.g. PV, wind, battery storage and cost of power purchased or sold to grid. The operational cost of the microgrid is the sum of all cost incurred in the system [13]. Also, hourly emission from each DER unit is considered to optimize the carbon footprints and levels of pollution from the operating microgrid.|$|R

6000|$|Another {{instance}} of the unceasing growth of Borgia history is afforded {{in connection with this}} Sebastiano Pinzone by Dr. Jacob Burckhardt (in Der Cultur der Renaissance in Italien) who, {{in the course of the}} usual sweeping diatribe against Cesare, mentions [...] "Michele da Corella, his strangler, and Sebastiano Pinzone, his poisoner."

Dr. Burckhardt felt, no doubt, the necessity of linking Pinzone to the Borgias, that the alleged guilt of the former may recoil upon the latter, and so he accomplished it in this facile and irresponsible manner.|$|R
40|$|Constructing interactive, {{animated}} 3 D graphics applications {{has been}} notoriously difficult {{for well over}} twenty years. Even though significant advances in the state-of-the-art have been made, this situation persists. The system described here simplifies the programmatic construction of geometry in ways {{that we have not}} seen elsewhere, and does so within the framework of an accepted production language, C++. It has been our experience that the resulting programs are quite succinct and comprehensible, and execute efficiently. The programmer is presented with a simple, general interface that is both declarative and conforms to the functional programming paradigm. Pursuing a functional interface for developing interactive 3 D applications is a novel concept that, in our experience, has been successful in providing a simple, powerful interface and a relatively straightforward implementation. The implementation of the system is highly object-oriented, relying heavily <b>upon</b> multiple <b>dispatching.</b> The system itself is extensible and adding new geometric primitives and operations is straightforward.

40|$|Abstract — Throughout {{the world}} {{significant}} development is being encouraged in wind energy for electricity generation. A complete {{cost benefit analysis}} has been conducted in this paper on the impacts of grid connected wind generation. A dispatch model is {{used to determine the}} <b>dispatches</b> <b>upon</b> which the costs and benefits can be ascertained for different wind capacities, plant mixes and loads. These costs and benefits are then used to generate net benefit curves for wind generation and the level where the costs exceed the benefits is established.

A large number of assumptions are tested and it was found that increased interconnection, high CO 2 prices and a flexible plant mix are particularly beneficial for wind generation, and that there are positive net benefits for wind energy penetrations of 17 % and higher under the chosen set of assumptions for the test system...|$|R
