50|$|Synthesis of <b>chromium</b> <b>carbide</b> can be {{achieved}} through mechanical alloying. In this type of process metallic chromium and pure carbon {{in the form of}} graphite are loaded into a ball mill and ground into a fine powder. After the components have been ground they are pressed into a pellet and subjected to hot isostatic pressing. Hot isostatic pressing utilizes an inert gas, primarily argon, in a sealed oven. This pressurized gas applies pressure to the sample from all directions while the oven is heated. The heat and pressure cause the graphite and metallic chromium to react with one another and form <b>chromium</b> <b>carbide.</b> Decreasing the percentage of carbon content in the initial mixture results in an increase in the yield of the Cr7C3, and Cr23C6 forms of <b>chromium</b> <b>carbide.</b>|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} {{different}} crystal structures for <b>chromium</b> <b>carbide</b> {{corresponding to the}} three different chemical compositions.

40|$|International audienceThe high {{temperature}} behavior of three iron-based alloys rich in chromium and containing HfC carbides was studied {{in comparison with}} two ternary Fe-Cr-C alloys. All these alloys, contain 25 wt. % Cr, 0. 25 or 0. 50 wt. % C, and additionally 3. 7 to 5. 6 wt. % Hf for three of them. All alloys were produced in a foundry. They were exposed to air at 1200 degrees C for 46 h. Their microstructures in the as-cast state and after exposure to {{high temperature}} were characterized using X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy and image analysis. The alloys were also subjected to indentation tests in their as-cast states and in their aged states.

50|$|<b>Chromium</b> <b>carbide</b> {{is useful}} in the surface {{treatment}} of metal components. <b>Chromium</b> <b>carbide</b> is used to coat the surface of another metal in a technique known as thermal spraying. Cr3C2 powder is mixed with solid nickel-chromium. This mixture is then heated to very high temperatures and sprayed onto the object being coated where it forms a protective layer. This layer is essentially its own metal matrix composite, consisting of hard ceramic Cr3C2 particles embedded in a nickel-chromium matrix. The matrix itself contributes to the corrosion resistance of the coating because both nickel and chromium are corrosion resistant in their metallic form. After over spraying the coating, the coated part must run through a diffusion heat treatment to reach the best results in matter of coupling strength to the basemetal and also in matter of hardness. Another technique utilizes <b>chromium</b> <b>carbide</b> {{in the form of}} overlay plates. These are prefabricated <b>chromium</b> <b>carbide</b> coated steel plates, which are meant to be welded onto existing structures or machinery in order to improve performance.Chromium carbide is used as an additive in cutting tools made out of cemented carbides, in order to improve toughness by preventing the growth of large grains. The primary constituent in most extremely hard cutting tools is tungsten carbide. The tungsten carbide is combined with other carbides such as titanium carbide, niobium carbide, and <b>chromium</b> <b>carbide</b> and sintered together with a cobalt matrix. Cr3C2 prevents large grains from forming in the composite, which results in a fine-grained structure of superior toughness.|$|E

When <b>chromium</b> <b>carbide</b> crystals are integrated into {{the surface of a}} metal it improves the wear resistance and corrosion resistance of the metal, and maintains these properties at elevated temperatures. The hardest and most commonly used composition for this purpose is Cr3C2.|$|E

Cast austenitic stainless steels may represent a good choice in this context but the existence of concentrated <b>chromium</b> <b>carbides</b> can generate undesirable results. A good combination of heat treatments can be applied to cast heat-resistant austenitic stainless steels, in an effort to achieve the dispersion of fine carbides, consequently improving their microstructure, mechanical properties and creep resistance. In this work, an austenitic stainless steel usually used in high temperature applications was characterized and subjected to solution annealing and aging heat treatments. The material analyzed was the austenitic cast stainless steel HK 30 and the goals of the work were to evaluate the effects of solution annealing heat treatments on the dissolution of grain boundary <b>chromium</b> <b>carbides</b> and the effects of aging treatments on creep resistance.
