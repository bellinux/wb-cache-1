40|$|The {{performance}} {{and characteristics of}} a <b>cyclone</b> <b>gasifier</b> for gasification of sawdust has been studied and evaluated. The system applied a technique to gasify sawdust through the concept of cyclonic motion driven by air injected at atmospheric pressure. This study covers the results obtained for gasification of ground sawdust from local furniture industries with size distribution ranging from 0. 25 to 1 mm. It {{was found that the}} typical wall temperature for initiating stable gasification process was about 400 °C. The heating value of producer gas was about 3. 9 MJ m - 3 that is sufficient for stable combustion in a dual-fuel engine generator. The highest thermal output from the <b>cyclone</b> <b>gasifier</b> was 57. 35 kW T. The highest value of mass conversion efficiency and enthalpy balance were 60 and 98. 7 %, respectively. The highest efficiency of the <b>cyclone</b> <b>gasifier</b> obtained was 73. 4 % and this compares well with other researchers. The study has identified the optimum operational condition for gasifying sawdust in a <b>cyclone</b> <b>gasifier</b> and made conclusions as to how the steady gasification process can be achieved...|$|E
40|$|The {{current work}} aims {{to make a}} {{foundation}} for an engineering design of a <b>cyclone</b> <b>gasifier</b> to be able not only to predict its flow field with a suitable accuracy but also to investigate {{a large number of}} design alternatives with limited computer resources. A good single-phase flow model that can form the basis in an Euler-Lagrange model for multi-phase flow is also necessary for modelling the reacting flow inside a <b>cyclone</b> <b>gasifier.</b> The present paper provides an objective comparison between several popular turbulence modelling options including standard k-ε and SST with curvature corrections, SSG-RSM and LES Smagorinsky models, for the single-phase flow inside cyclone separators/gasifiers that can serve as a guide for further work on the reacting multi-phase flow inside cyclone gasifiers and similar devices. A detailed comparison between the models and experimental data for the mean velocity and fluctuating parts of the velocity profiles are presented. Furthermore, the capabilities of the turbulence models to capture the physical phenomena present in a <b>cyclone</b> <b>gasifier</b> that affects the design process are investigated.

40|$|The {{potential}} of cane residuals {{as a source}} of energy could help many developing countries to improve their balance of payments by decreasing fossil fuels imports and increasing the electrical power production. A substantial increase of the electricity output in the sugar industry could be achieved by using a combined gas turbine/steam turbine integrated with gasifier supplying combustible gas to the gas turbine combustor. The problem is {{to find a way to}} avoid those ash-forming elements in the solid fuel that cause erosion, corrosion and deposits in the gas turbine. A method for avoiding excessive amounts of alkali compounds and particles in producer gas from gasification of cane residues has been studied and evaluated. Powderised cane residue is gasified in a <b>cyclone</b> <b>gasifier.</b> The <b>cyclone</b> <b>gasifier</b> works as a particle separator as well. The advantage with this technique is that the gasification temperature might be kept at a level where the volatilisation of corrosive elements such as sodium and potassium will not occur which could be separated from the product gas in the cyclone. A comparative study between the <b>cyclone</b> <b>gasifier</b> and a bench-scale fluidised bed gasifier have been conducted to evaluate which gasification process is most attractive as regards alkali separation/retention, and to try to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the retention.

The model includes the technical characteristics of all the components (<b>gasifier,</b> <b>cyclone,</b> exchangers, piping, etc.) of the plant and works in accordance with its actual main control logics. Simulation results accord with those obtained during an extensive experimental activity. After the model validation, the influence of operating parameters such as the equivalent ratio, the biomass moisture content and the gasifying air temperature on syngas composition have been analyzed {{in order to assess}} the operative behavior and the energy performance of the experimental plant.

40|$|A wet {{chemical}} sampling method using acidic absorbing solutions {{was used to}} determine levels of ammonia (NH 3) in syngas from a biomass gasifier. Before syngas is bubbled into the absorbing solutions, a quartz thimble filter is used to filter ash from the gas stream at 450 °C followed by heavy tar removal at about 100 °C. When gasifying corn, good precision was observed for multiple samples collected on any given day of testing. Tests on producer gas obtained from gasification of switchgrass revealed important conditions for successfully sampling NH 3. During gasification of switchgrass, high solids loading in the syngas caused the primary <b>cyclone</b> at the <b>gasifier</b> exit to plug, resulting in abnormally high ash loading in the thimble filter in the sampling system. While gasifying the switchgrass, the NH 3 levels showed a continuous decline throughout the day. It is suspected that NH 3 reacts with the ash in the thimble filter, confounding attempts to accurately measure NH 3 in the syngas...|$|R

40|$|This study presents, the {{characterization}} of sawdust residues from Malaysian furniture industries for <b>cyclone</b> <b>gasifier.</b> The characterization of sawdust has been studied and evaluated to determine its potential utilization as a biomass fuel for <b>cyclone</b> <b>gasifier.</b> The raw sawdust was produced by cutter, sawing, sieve and sanding. The types of species of wood sawn timber used by the factory were Meranti (dark red, light red and red). The raw sawdust was pre-treated throughout a grinding process into smaller sizes of particles and sieve with three different mesh sizes (3. 5, 1. 2 and 0. 6 mm). The sample of ground sawdust was analyzed for its biomass fuel characteristics. The results of proximate analysis shows that the ground sawdust with moisture content of 8. 25 % (wet basis) contains 14. 04 % of fixed carbon, 76. 23 % of volatile matter and 1. 49 % of ash on dry basis. The High Heating Value (HHV) of sawdust {{was found to be}} about 18. 23 MJ kg - 1 while the Low Heating Value (LHV) was about 16. 54 MJ kg - 1. The result of ultimate analysis validates both ash and moisture content which are found to be 1. 49 and 8. 25 %, respectively. Other elemental compositions determined by the ultimate analysis are carbon (42. 38 %), hydrogen (5. 27 %), nitrogen (0. 14 %) and oxygen (42. 41 %). There is no sulphur detected in the sawdust. The study has identified that the sawdust from local furniture industries is comparable with other types of biomass and therefore, making it very potential as a source of fuel for the cyclone gasification system...|$|E
40|$|Air-blown cyclone {{gasification}} is an entrained flow gasification {{process in}} which biomass powder fuel is burnt in a gasifier that operates similarly to a cyclone separator. Cyclone separators are widely used in industry to separate a dispersed solid phase (e. g. particles) from a continuous flow of gas based on density differences. Due to its simple design, the cyclone is a reliable apparatus with low cost for manufacture and maintenance. The performance of an isothermal cyclone separator can be predicted satisfactorily with the model developed by Muschelknautz et al. However, the flow in a non-isothermal <b>cyclone</b> <b>gasifier</b> has additional complexities, e. g. the production of gas from the fuel particles, that are {{outside the scope of}} the Muschelknautz model. In order to incorporate these effects more advanced modeling based on Computational Fluid Dynamics is needed. One problem with the CFD approach in combination with turbulent heat transfer and chemical reactions is that the complexity of the global model makes it difficult to assess the accuracy of the sub-models. Recently published models are based on relatively simple eddy-viscosity turbulence models. The agreement between these models and experiments has been encouraging but one cannot {{rule out the possibility that}} the apparently good performance of the model is a lucky coincidence due to cancellation of errors in the different sub models. The present paper is focusing on the fluid dynamics modeling of the flow in a <b>cyclone</b> <b>gasifier</b> in order to develop a better foundation for continued modeling. Since simulation of dispersed phase behavior is based on a precise modeling of the continuous phase flow field, it is valuable to assess different numerical approaches to find the most promising one for simulating the turbulent gas phase flow. Due to the complexity of turbulent swirling flow in a <b>cyclone</b> <b>gasifier,</b> a careful selection of turbulence models is needed to fulfill accurate numerical calculations of flow parameters. Two families of turbulence models are supposed to be tested: the two-equation eddy viscosity models including k-epsilon and k-omega, and the Reynolds stress model. For the k-epsilon model, steady-state and transient simulations are implemented. The gas cyclone of Obermair et al. with relevant operating conditions was chosen as a benchmark. The simulation results are compared to the Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA) velocity measurements of the gas cyclone. The simulations are implemented in the commercial CFD (computational fluid dynamics) code ANSYS CFX 14. 5; which uses an element-based finite volume approach. The method involves discretization of the spatial domain using a three-dimensional mesh to build up finite volumes over which relevant quantities like mass, momentum, and energy are conserved. In all, the capability of the mentioned approaches for representing the flow field in general and the precessing vortex core and its related fluctuations in particular will be discussed.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a result of {{experimental}} studies carried out {{as a part of the}} efforts made in Sweden and within the European Union to develop a technology that will make it technically and economically possible to use biomass as a gas turbine fuel. The process that has been studied is based on cyclone gasification of biomass powder and no further cleaning of the product gas from the gasifier. The study covers four issues that are important for assessment of the possibilities to develop such a process to commercialisation: The feeding of biomass to the gasifier The efficiency of the gasification process The product gas quality The integration of the gas turbine and the gasifier. The studies of the feeding system are presented in papers 1, 2 and 3. Screw feeders were used to control the fuel flow and ejectors driven by pressurised air or pressurised steam were used for injection of the powder into the cyclone. Two approaches for achieving feeding with small temporal variations were studied. One is based on use of a vibrator device in the feeding train, the other on use of a brush-like device positioned after the metering screws. Both systems were found to work reliably during the feeding tests and the subsequent gasification experiments. The gasification tests aimed at determination of the quality of the gas produced from the <b>cyclone</b> <b>gasifier.</b> Stable operating ranges, generation of char residue, heating value of the product gas and amounts of contaminants in the product gas were studied. The results were compared with gas quality criteria provided by ABB Stal. Experiments were made at atmospheric pressure and elevated pressure. The atmospheric gasification tests covered five different biomass powders. The results of these tests are shown in paper 4. Two of the fuels appeared as less suitable in the type of <b>cyclone</b> <b>gasifier</b> that was used. The pressurised gasification tests included commercial Swedish wood powder fuel only. The results of the tests are shown in paper 5. For this fuel, stable gasification could be attained both at the atmospheric and elevated pressure. The gas quality fulfilled the criteria with exception for the amount of large particles (above 8 µm). The implications of this will depend on the particle properties. The experiences from attempts to operate the <b>cyclone</b> <b>gasifier</b> integrated with a gas turbine are presented in paper 6. Many difficulties where encountered during these tests. Stable operation of the gas turbine could be however achieved on a few occasions. The longest uninterrupted operation period was 34 minutes. Pressure transients appearing upon ignition in the combustion chamber of the gas turbine and design of the char discharge system at the cyclone bottom are the main unresolved problems.

40|$|The {{characterization}} of rice husk from local rice mills {{has been studied}} and evaluated to determine its potential utilization as a biomass fuel for a <b>cyclone</b> <b>gasifier.</b> The raw rice husk was pre-treated throughout a grinding process into smaller sizes of particles which is within a range of 0. 4 to 1 mm and the sample of ground rice husk was analyzed for its fuel characteristics. The result of proximate analysis shows that the ground rice husk with size distribution within 0. 4 to 1 mm contains 13. 4 % of fixed carbon, 62. 95 % of volatile matter and 18. 5 % of ash on dry basis. The moisture content {{of the sample was}} measured and determined as 10. 4 % (wet basis) and the calorific value was found to be approximately 14. 8 MJ kg - 1 with bulk density of 91. 46 kg m - 3.

Other elemental compositions determined by the ultimate analysis are carbon (37. 9 %), hydrogen (5. 2 %), nitrogen (0. 14 %), sulfur (0. 61 %) and oxygen (27. 7 % by difference).

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} an exploratory experimental and theoretical study of gasification of wood powder in a <b>cyclone</b> <b>gasifier.</b> The generated gas {{could be used}} to operate a gas turbine in a combined cyclone power plant. The objective has been to develop the understanding of cyclone gasification by experimental studies of the performance of a cyclone designed in principle as a separation cyclone and by comparisons between the experimental results and theoretical predictions. The experiments were carried out with commercial Swedish wood powder fuels, injected with air or steam/air mixture through two diametrically opposite tangential inlets and gasified at atmospheric pressure in cyclones of two different configurations with a volume of about 0. 034 m 3. The studies show that stable gasification of this fuel can be obtained for a specific fuel feeding rate of about 5 MW/m 3 cyclone volume for equivalence ratios above 0. 15 and that the equivalence ratio had to be kept below about 0. 4 in order to avoid material temperatures above 950 oC. A cyclone with a short outlet pipe, designed as a conventional separation cyclone was found to give lower char conversion than a modified cyclone with a long outlet pipe. The heating value of the gas was found to be approximately 4. 5 MJ/kg. The dust load in the product gas was measured to between 1000 and 2500 mg/Nm 3. It was possible to separate at least 40 - 60 % of the potassium and 60 - 90 % of the sodium supplied with the wood. The alkali that left the cyclone with the product gas appear to be in solid or melted phase in the unseparated char particles and consequently not vaporised during gasification. As the K and Na were assumed to remain within the particles during gasification, it was concluded that {{to reduce the amount of}} alkali metals in the product gas it would be necessary to improve the particle separation efficiency. The results of the theoretical modelling, using the existing models in the commercial software CFX 4. 2, show with 3 -dimensional modelling of the cyclone flow that RSM turbulence models give better agreement between predicted and observed velocity distributions than k-e models. Nevertheless, the latter give acceptable predictions as regards particle separation. Comparisons between predicted and experimental performance of cyclone gasifiers show that the heating value is over-predicted and the carbon conversion and alkali carry over are under-predicted. The results show that further development of the theoretical models is necessary. Godkänd; 1999; 20061117 (haneit...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the energy}} {{consumption}} {{in the world is}} increasing together with an increase of greenhouse gas emission it is of importance to find alternatives to fossil fuels. Biomass is one of the alternative energy sources which is both renewable and CO 2 neutral. However, due to the large variability of biomass and the influence from different types of contaminations it is important to find processes that can work with a range of biomass and preferably transform the energy in the biomass into higher value energy forms. Gasification {{is one of the most}} robust processes that can achieve this by transforming solid biomass (e. g. wood, bark or rice husks) or liquid byproducts from the forest products industry (black liquor) into a uniform synthesis gas that can be further upgraded into electric power or synthetic motor fuels. This thesis is focused on a specific class of gasifiers called entrained flow gasifiers that converts the biomass to syngas in a reactor where the fuel is entrained in a gas flow. In entrained flow gasification, small fuel particles are gasified together with an oxidizing medium like air or pure oxygen. The fuel particles are either formed a priori by milling of solid biomass or in situ by atomisation of a liquid fuel. In both cases the fuel is thoroughly mixed with a carrier gas and distributed into a hot gasification reactor. One type of entrained flow gasification that is of high relevance for countries with a significant pulp and paper industry is black liquor gasification. Black liquor is a by-product from pulping that is available in large quantities in chemical pulp mills. The energy in the black liquor is normally utilized for steam production in the mill but this steam can easily be produced from low grade biomass, thereby freeing the black liquor for other purposes. The most interesting process is when black liquor is gasified with pure oxygen at high temperature. This process creates a clean synthetic gas with very low concentration of tars that is suitable for catalytic conversion into transportation fuels, e. g. dimethyl ether or methanol. One of the key parts in a black liquor gasifier is the burner nozzle that is used to produce a spray of fine black liquor droplets inside the gasifier. This is a difficult task since black liquor has a very high viscosity. The black liquor atomisation process has therefore been studied with high speed photography to be able to visualize the process and thereby making it possible to optimize the burner nozzle so that it produces a spray with near uniform particle size and appropriate distribution in space. The results show that the fuel particles formed from the considered nozzle consisted of non-spherical and stretched ligaments that in some cases were further broken down into more spherical droplets. The experiments with black liquor were difficult and hazardous since the black liquor is caustic and hot since it needs to be preheated to around 120 °C before it can be atomised. It is therefore of interest to find non-hazardous substitute liquids that will have the same behaviour as black liquor in a nozzle. In a comparison between black liquor at 120 °C and a syrup/water mixture with equal viscosity and surface tension at room temperature it was found that the syrup/water mixture behaved nearly identical to the black liquor in a real burner nozzle. Connected to the atomisation studies, measurements of gas composition in a 3 MW black liquor gasifier were made for different black liquor preheat temperatures. The results showed that preheating of black liquor had a significant influence on the syngas composition and the conclusion when this was combined with the results from spray visualization was that the main reason for the observed differences is the smaller droplet size that is achieved with higher preheating temperatures. In a large syngas plant where the goal is to catalytically convert the syngas into motor fuels or chemicals in a catalytic process, the raw syngas from the gasifier must be cleaned and conditioned in several steps. In all contemporary downstream processes the gas must be much colder than when it leaves the gasifier. Hence, gas cooling is an important unit operation in the syngas process. In order to optimize the overall efficiency of the syngas plant it is very important to recover the latent heat in the syngas at the highest possible temperature. One way to do this is to use a counter current condenser that cools the syngas and condenses most of the steam that is mixed with the syngas while at the same time steam that can be used by other processes is produced. The sizing of counter current condensers is therefore of high importance and one part of the thesis work was to develop a computational model that can be used for optimization of these units. In order to validate the code, measurements were carried out in the counter-current condenser in the 3 MW black liquor gasification pilot plant that was mentioned above. The predictions from the model were found to be in very good agreement with the temperature measurements from the pilot plant for the cases that were investigated. Another type of entrained flow gasification process is air-blown cyclone gasification where biomass powder is gasified in a cyclone shaped reactor. This gasification process can be used in combination with a gas engine to produce both heat and power that can be used in district heating applications or as prime mover and heat source in industrial processes where low grade biomass is available at low cost. This type of gasifier has the possibility to operate with ash rich fuels since it operates below the ash melting temperature and the majority of the ash is separated in the bottom of the cyclone. One of the objectives in this thesis was to evaluate the fuel flexibility of the <b>cyclone</b> <b>gasifier</b> by experiments with different fuels in a 500 kW pilot gasifier. From the gasification test it was found that torrefied spruce, peat, rice husk, bark and stemwood powder can be used as fuel to produce a syngas that can be used as fuel in a gas engine. To be able to understand the cyclone gasification process and be able to optimize different sizes of cyclone gasifiers a computational fluid dynamics model of the process has been developed and compared against experimental measurements, both in a 500 kW plant and a 4 MW plant. The results show that the model predicts the main gas species in the product gas and the amount of unconverted fuel reasonably well. It also predicts the effect of increased gasifier size and fuel power well. Therefore the model could be used as a tool for designing cyclone gasifiers in arbitrary sizes and to optimise operating parameters in existing gasifiers.
