OKW <b>chipped</b> in some divisions from other theatres. By February, Kesselring was able to take the offensive at Anzio but his forces were unable to crush the Allied beachhead, for which Kesselring blamed himself, OKW and von Mackensen for avoidable errors.|$|E
5|$|<b>Chipped</b> {{stone tools}} found at Zemun {{show that the}} area around Belgrade was {{inhabited}} by nomadic foragers in the Palaeolithic and Mesolithic eras. Some of these tools belong to the Mousterian industry, which are associated with Neanderthals rather than modern humans. Aurignacian and Gravettian tools have also been discovered there, indicating occupation between 50,000 and 20,000 years ago.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn the {{aeronautical}} field, {{some parts}} are forged and consequently some fibers orientation occurs. However, the thin walls {{are hard to}} get with forging method. Consequently, some machining operations are done to get a thin wall and reduce the weight of part. However, {{because of the size}} of part of the volume of <b>chips</b> can be significant. The ratio between the final weight of part and the final weight of <b>chips</b> is approximately 80 %. To improve the economical and the environmental sustainability, a method consists of recycling directly the <b>chip</b> after machining operations. However, studies show a great impact of different points on <b>chip</b> recyclability like <b>chip</b> thickness, <b>chip</b> roughness, or <b>chip</b> density. Consequently, control of the <b>chip</b> morphology is a first point in ensuring a good recyclability. This article concerns the relationship between the cutting conditions, the cutting tool geometries, the lubricant conditions, and the <b>chips</b> morphology. This analysis is decomposed on several points: <b>chip</b> length, <b>chip</b> morphology, <b>chip</b> thickness, and the <b>chip</b> formation.

Belle returns to Rumpelstiltskin's castle and the Dark one asks why {{she came back to}} him. She replies that she wasn't going to return but something changed her mind. After a moment of silence between the two, they both share true love's kiss, the magic starts to turn him back into an ordinary man, but becomes furious and shakes off the magic, accusing Belle of conspiring with The Evil Queen. Rumpelstiltskin yells in a rage that no one will love him, and The Evil Queen will never take away his power. He throws Belle in his dungeon and smashes every cup against the wall but he cannot bring himself to destroy the <b>chipped</b> one.
