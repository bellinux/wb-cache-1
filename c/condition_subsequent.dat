50|$|A {{right in}} land may be cut off by a <b>condition</b> <b>subsequent.</b> When land rights are subject to a <b>condition</b> <b>subsequent,</b> this creates a defeasable fee called a Fee simple subject to <b>condition</b> <b>subsequent.</b>|$|E
50|$|A <b>condition</b> <b>subsequent</b> is {{an event}} or state of affairs that brings an end to {{something}} else. A <b>condition</b> <b>subsequent</b> is often used in a legal context as a marker bringing an end to one's legal rights or duties. A <b>condition</b> <b>subsequent</b> may be either an event or a state of affairs that must either (1) occur or (2) fail to continue to occur.|$|E

50|$|This {{may also}} refer to {{contingent}} conditions, which come under two categories: condition precedent and condition subsequent.Conditions precedent are conditions {{that have to}} be complied with before performance of a contractWith <b>conditions</b> <b>subsequent,</b> parties have to perform until the condition is not met.Failure of a condition repudiates the contract this is not to necessarily discharge it.

50|$|Here, O is the {{original}} owner. She grants A a fee simple subject to the subsequent condition that he doesn't accept a candy bar from C. But unlike a fee simple subject to a <b>condition</b> <b>subsequent,</b> Blackacre goes to a third party (B) instead of the grantor (O) if the condition is met. Also unlike a fee simple subject to a <b>condition</b> <b>subsequent,</b> B then automatically gains the interest in Blackacre and does not only have a mere right to sue for re-entry.|$|E

5000|$|In such a fee, {{the future}} {{interest}} {{is called a}} [...] "right of reentry" [...] or [...] "right of entry."There, the fee simple subject to <b>condition</b> <b>subsequent</b> does not end automatically upon the happening of the condition, but if the specified future event occurs, the grantor {{has a right to}} retake his property (as opposed to it reverting to him automatically). Again, the right of entry is not automatic, but rather must be exercised to terminate the fee simple subject to <b>condition</b> <b>subsequent.</b> To exercise right of entry, the holder must take substantial steps to recover possession and title, for example, by filing a lawsuit.|$|E

50|$|Having {{evolved from}} a Roman castrum in Celtic Britain. In the Victorian era, Manchester {{was the site of}} one of the world's first {{passenger}} railway station and many scientific achievements of great importance. Manchester also led the political and economic reform of 19th century Britain as the vanguard of free trade. The mid-20th century saw a decline in Manchester's industrial importance, prompting a depression in social and economic <b>conditions.</b> <b>Subsequent</b> investment, gentrification and rebranding from the 1990s onwards changed its fortunes, and reinvigorated Manchester as a post-industrial city with multiple sporting, broadcasting and educational institutions.|$|R

5000|$|A {{fee simple}} {{subject to a}} <b>condition</b> <b>subsequent</b> is created when {{the words of a}} grant support the {{conclusion}} that the grantor intends to convey a fee simple absolute but has attached a condition to the grant so that if a specified future event happens the grantor will get its fee simple absolute back, provided that the grantor exercises his right of entry (or power of termination). Thus, a fee simple subject to <b>condition</b> <b>subsequent</b> does not end automatically upon the happening of the condition. The future interest is called a [...] "right of reentry" [...] or [...] "right of entry," [...] and the property only reverts to the original grantor if he exercises this right.|$|E

The approach combines estimation of propagation <b>conditions,</b> <b>subsequent</b> appropriate channel modelling and optimisation feedback to the used positioning algorithm.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{presents}} a comparative analysis of communicative breakdowns experienced by participants collaboratively performing a task in three communication environments: face-to-face, mediated by an audio connection, and mediated by both an audio {{and a video}} connection. A quantitative analysis showed significantly less breakdown in the copresent condition than in {{either of the two}} technologically-mediated conditions; no differences were found between audio-only and audio-video <b>conditions.</b> <b>Subsequent</b> qualitative analysis revealed that breakdowns in the audio-video environment stemmed from pragmatic deficiencies in the access to nonverbal displays afforded by a remote video image in task-oriented scenarios...|$|R

50|$|Two other {{techniques}} {{to prevent the}} assignment of contracts are rescission clauses or clauses creating a <b>condition</b> <b>subsequent.</b> The former would give the other party to the contract the power to rescind the contract if an assignment is made; the latter would rescind the contract automatically in such circumstances.|$|E
50|$|Right {{of entry}} refers to one's {{right to take}} or resume {{possession}} of land, or {{the right of a}} person to go onto another's real property without committing trespass.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{trading and}} price behavior when some investors receive information before others. It shows that early-informed investors trade more intensely {{on the information}} they share with late-informed investors at first to exploit it before the latter can do so. They reverse their trading strategy in the second round. The paper also shows that price and price moves are positively correlated with information. More interestingly, it discovers that under some <b>conditions,</b> <b>subsequent</b> price changes are positively correlated. Finally, it shows that early-informed investors may behave like contrarians. ...|$|R
