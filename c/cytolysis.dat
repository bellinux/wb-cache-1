25|$|Enclosing {{the cell}} is the cell {{envelope}} – generally {{consisting of a}} plasma membrane covered by a cell wall which, for some bacteria, may be further covered by a third layer called a capsule. Though most prokaryotes have both a cell membrane and a cell wall, there are exceptions such as Mycoplasma (bacteria) and Thermoplasma (archaea) which only possess the cell membrane layer. The envelope gives rigidity to the cell and separates {{the interior of the}} cell from its environment, serving as a protective filter. The cell wall consists of peptidoglycan in bacteria, and acts as an additional barrier against exterior forces. It also prevents the cell from expanding and bursting (<b>cytolysis)</b> from osmotic pressure due to a hypotonic environment. Some eukaryotic cells (plant cells and fungal cells) also have a cell wall.|$|E
25|$|In humans the metacyclic promastigotes are {{injected}} by sandfly {{through the}} skin during its blood meal. When sandfly bites using its proboscis it ejects the parasites that are stored inside the hollow tube. Some promastigotes may enter the blood stream directly where some are destroyed by macrophagic <b>cytolysis.</b> But many are also taken up through phagocytosis by mononuclear phagocytes in liver, spleen and bone marrow. Inside the cells they undergo spontaneous transformation into oval-shaped amastigotes. Granulocytes selectively kill the promastigotes by oxidative mechanism, while amastigotes are resistant. Then the surviving amastigotes undergo cell division using simple binary fission. Multiplication continues until the host cell can no longer hold and ruptures. In a fully congested cell there can {{be as many as}} 50 to 200 amastigotes, which are released into tissue cavities. Each individual amastigote is then capable of invading fresh cells. As a result, the entire tissue is progressively infected and destroyed. A number of free amastigotes then enters the blood stream where many are phagocytosed by macrophages. These free and phagocytosed amastigotes in peripheral blood are then sucked up by blood-feeding sandfly.|$|E

The proteins account for 5% of the serum globulin fraction. Most of these proteins circulate as zymogens, which are inactive until proteolytic cleavage.|$|E
50|$|Tr1 {{cells can}} both express Granzyme A and granzyme B. It was shown recently, that Tr1 cells, in vitro and also ex vivo, {{specifically}} lyse cells of myeloid origin, but not other APC or T or B lymphocytes. <b>Cytolysis</b> indirectly suppresses immune response by reducing numbers of myeloid-origin antigen presenting cells.|$|E
5000|$|The suppressing and tolerance-inducing {{effect of}} Tr1 cells is {{mediated}} mainly by cytokines.

[...] In vivo Tr1 cells {{need to be}} activated, {{to be able to}} exert their regulatory effects.|$|E
50|$|Different {{cells and}} organisms have adapted {{different}} ways of preventing <b>cytolysis</b> from occurring. For example, the paramecium uses a contractile vacuole, which rapidly pumps out excessive water to prevent the build-up of water and the otherwise subsequent lysis. Additionally, these protists have cell membranes which are less permeable to water than some other species.|$|E
50|$|Other organisms pump solutes out {{of their}} cytosol, which brings the solute {{concentration}} closer to that of their environment and slows down the process of water's diffusion into the cell, preventing <b>cytolysis.</b> If the cell can pump out enough solutes so that an isotonic environment can be achieved, {{there will be no}} net movement of water.|$|E
50|$|Polyclonal {{antibodies}} inhibit T lymphocytes {{and cause}} their lysis, {{which is both}} complement-mediated <b>cytolysis</b> and cell-mediated opsonization followed by removal of reticuloendothelial cells from the circulation in the spleen and liver. In this way, polyclonal antibodies inhibit cell-mediated immune reactions, including graft rejection, delayed hypersensitivity (i.e., tuberculin skin reaction), and the graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), but influence thymus-dependent antibody production.|$|E
5000|$|Tumor {{necrosis}} factor (TNF) (also {{known as}} cachectin [...] or TNF alpha) is a cytokine {{that has a}} wide variety of functions. It can cause <b>cytolysis</b> of certain tumor cell lines; it is involved in the induction of cachexia; it is a potent pyrogen, causing fever by direct action or by stimulation of interleukin-1 secretion; it can stimulate cell proliferation and induce cell differentiation under certain conditions.|$|E
50|$|Plasmolysis is {{the process}} in which cells lose water in a {{hypertonic}} solution. The reverse process, <b>cytolysis,</b> can occur if the cell is in a hypotonic solution resulting in a lower external osmotic pressure and a net flow of water into the cell. Through observation of plasmolysis and deplasmolysis, {{it is possible to}} determine the tonicity of the cell's environment as well as the rate solute molecules cross the cellular membrane.|$|E
50|$|Activating receptors {{have lower}} {{affinity}} for their ligands than do inhibitory receptors. Although {{the purpose of}} this difference in affinity is unknown, {{it is possible that the}} <b>cytolysis</b> of target cells occurs preferentially under conditions in which the expression of stimulating MHC class I molecules on target cells is high, which may occur during viral infection. This difference, which is also present in Ly49, the murine homolog to KIR, tips the balance towards self-tolerance.|$|E
50|$|Natural killer cell <b>cytolysis</b> {{of target}} cells and {{cytokine}} production {{is controlled by}} a balance of inhibitory and activating signals, which are facilitated by NK cell receptors. NK cell inhibitory receptors are part of either the immunoglobulin-like (IgSF) superfamily or the C-type lectin-like receptor (CTLR) superfamily. Members of the IgSF family include the human killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) and the Immunoglobulin-like transcripts (ILT). CTLR inhibitory receptors include the CD94/NKG2A and the murine Ly49, which is probably analogous to the human KIR.|$|E
50|$|When a {{biological}} cell is in a hypotonic environment, the cell interior accumulates water, water flows across the cell membrane into the cell, {{causing it to}} expand. In plant cells, the cell wall restricts the expansion, resulting in pressure on the cell wall from within called turgor pressure. Turgor pressure allows herbaceous plants to stand upright. It is also the determining factor for how plants regulate the aperture of their stomata. In animal cells excessive osmotic pressure can result in <b>cytolysis.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{complement}} {{system is a}} biochemical cascade of the innate immune system that helps clear pathogens from an organism. It is derived from many small blood plasma proteins that work together to disrupt the target cell's plasma membrane leading to <b>cytolysis</b> of the cell. The {{complement system}} consists of more than 35 soluble and cell-bound proteins, 12 of which are {{directly involved in the}} complement pathways. The complement system is involved in the activities of both innate immunity and acquired immunity.|$|E
50|$|Perforin has {{structural}} and functional similarities to complement component 9 (C9). Like C9, this protein creates transmembrane tubules and {{is capable of}} lysing non-specifically a variety of target cells. This protein {{is one of the}} main cytolytic proteins of cytolytic granules, and it is known to be a key effector molecule for T-cell- and natural killer-cell-mediated <b>cytolysis.</b> Perforin is thought to act by creating holes in the plasma membrane which triggers an influx of calcium and initiates membrane repair mechanisms. These repair mechanisms bring perforin and granzymes into early endosomes.|$|E
50|$|YopE {{functions}} as a GTPase-activating protein {{for members of the}} Rho family of GTPases such as RAC1. YopT is a cysteine protease that inhibits RhoA by removing the isoprenyl group, which is important for localizing the protein to the cell membrane. It has been proposed that YopE and YopT may function to limit YopB/D-induced <b>cytolysis.</b> This might limit the function of YopB/D to create the pores used for Yop insertion into host cells and prevent YopB/D-induced rupture of host cells and release of cell contents that would attract and stimulate immune system responses.|$|E

50|$|The {{enzymes that}} hydrolyze the {{peptidoglycan}} cross-links continue to function, even while those that form such cross-links do not. This weakens the cell {{wall of the}} bacterium, and osmotic pressure becomes increasingly uncompensated—eventually causing cell death (<b>cytolysis).</b> In addition, the build-up of peptidoglycan precursors triggers the activation of bacterial cell wall hydrolases and autolysins, which further digest the cell wall's peptidoglycans. The small size of the penicillins increases their potency, {{by allowing them to}} penetrate the entire depth of the cell wall. This is in contrast to the glycopeptide antibiotics vancomycin and teicoplanin, which are both much larger than the penicillins.|$|E
50|$|As cell {{membranes}} {{in general are}} freely permeable to water, the osmolality of the extracellular fluid (ECF) is approximately {{equal to that of}} the intracellular fluid (ICF). Therefore, plasma osmolality is a guide to intracellular osmolality. This is important, as it shows that changes in ECF osmolality have a great effect on ICF osmolality — changes that can cause problems with normal cell functioning and volume. If the ECF were to become too hypotonic, water would readily fill surrounding cells, increasing their volume and potentially lysing them (<b>cytolysis).</b> Many poisons, medications and diseases affect the balance between the ICF and ECF, affecting individual cells and homeostasis as a whole.|$|E
50|$|In addition, the type-III {{secretion}} system (T3SS) allows Y. pestis {{to inject}} proteins into macrophages and other immune cells. These T3SS-injected proteins, called Yersinia outer proteins (Yops), include Yop B/D, which form pores {{in the host}} cell membrane and {{have been linked to}} <b>cytolysis.</b> The YopO, YopH, YopM, YopT, YopJ, and YopE are injected into the cytoplasm of host cells by T3SS into the pore created in part by YopB and YopD. The injected Yops limit phagocytosis and cell signaling pathways important in the innate immune system, as discussed below. In addition, some Y. pestis strains are capable of interfering with immune signaling (e.g., by preventing the release of some cytokines).|$|E
5000|$|Granulysin is a {{substance}} released by cytotoxic T cells (CD8) {{when they are}} attached to infected body cells. It functions to create holes in the target cell membrane and destroy it. Granulysin is able to induce apoptosis in target cells and also has antimicrobial action [...]Granulysin is a cytolytic and proinflammatory molecule first identified by subtractive hybridization during a search for genes expressed by human cytotoxic T lymphocytes 3-5 days after their activation. It is expressed in cytolytic granules with perforin, a pore forming protein, and granzymes that are also involved in <b>cytolysis.</b> Granulysin is broadly antimicrobial, killing microbes that cause, for example, tuberculosis and malaria, and can destroy some tumors. A series of peptides generated from the amino acid sequence of granulysin are potential antibiotics.|$|E
