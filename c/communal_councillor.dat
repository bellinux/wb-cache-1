50|$|The {{massacre}} in Kibilira began on October 11, 1990, {{ten days after}} {{the beginning of the}} civil war, in a commune where Tutsi and Hutu had previously lived a relatively peaceful co-existence. At a meeting of <b>communal</b> <b>councillors,</b> the assistant prefect showed two dead bodies to the members present and claimed they were Hutu killed by Tutsi. He told the councillors to go home “sensitize the population” to the necessity of security measures. Authorities then incited civilians to burn the homes of Tutsi, under the pretext that there was a larger plan to exterminate the Hutu. Some councillors spread false rumours about military authorities being murdered and a fabricated story of a Tutsi killing children at local schools.|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} project {{was carried out}} in order to obtain more knowledge of the attitudes of people living in the mountain areas of Switzerland towards forests, forestry and forest politics. A questionnaire was sent to 2160 private individuals and 72 <b>communal</b> <b>councillors</b> responsible for the forest in their own communes. It contained both questions which the respondents were asked to answer in their own words, and questions, for which they were asked to select from a number of pre-set options. Answers were returned by well over 600 members of the general public and some 60 councillors, thus providing a basis for evaluation. The questionnaire was sent to 6 communes in each of 6 different cantons in the Alps, Pre-Alps and the Jura. The paper presents selected findings of the final {{research project}} report which, in the option of the authors, confirm some of the assumptions bur also provide new and unexpected insights. This refers in particular to the concepts and knowledge of the respondents; their associations with the term of forests; their judgements on the distribution of forest areas and on the state of forests; their views on the role and activities of forest owners; their reactions to current practices of protecting forests and of funding forestry; and to the opinions of com-munal council representatives in forestry matters...|$|R

It had a significant number of <b>communal</b> and county <b>councillors,</b> and even mayors in localities with a sizeable German component. Brandsch, between 23 April 1931 and 20 October 1932, and Hans Otto Roth, between 4 July and 4 September 1940, were respectively Undersecretary of State and Minister for Minorities.
