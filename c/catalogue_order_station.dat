This was originally intended primarily for industry use in databases and {{as a part of}} stock-keeping identifiers and <b>catalogue</b> <b>ordering</b> numbers, but later users have also expressed a desire to use compact codes for customer communication. Writing out all the centimetre figures of all the primary and secondary measures from EN 13402-2 can – in some cases – require up to 12 digits. The full list of centimetre figures on the pictogram contains a lot of redundancy and the same information can be squeezed into fewer characters with lookup tables.

A general description of data protection legislation in the UK is followed by a brief overview of the aspects which involve personal data in libraries. The result of an impact survey of UK university libraries ranging in size are reported in detail and discussed. Institutional experiences are noted, including the penetration of information technology (IT) into library activities, together with the organisation of data protection responsibilities and practice. Almost all institu-tions are registered under the Data Protection Act 1984 and many have someone specially designated to oversee data protection. There is extensive use of IT in the libraries surveyed, particularly for <b>cataloguing,</b> <b>ordering</b> and circu...|$|R

40|$|The two sensory systems {{discussed}} use similar algorithms for {{the synthesis}} of the neuronal selectivity for the stimulus that releases a particular behavior, although the neural circuits, the brain sites involved, and even the species are different. This stimulus selectivity emerges gradually in a neural network organized according to parallel and hierarchical design principles. The parallel channels contain lower <b>order</b> <b>stations</b> with special circuits {{for the creation of}} neuronal selectivities for different features of the stimulus. Convergence of the parallel pathways brings these selectivities together at a higher <b>order</b> <b>station</b> for the eventual synthesis of the selectivity for the whole stimulus pattern. The neurons that are selective for the stimulus are {{at the top of the}} hierarchy, and they form the interface between the sensory and motor systems or between sensory systems of different modalities. The similarities of these two systems at the level of algorithms suggest the existence of rules of signal processing that transcend different sensory systems and species of animals...|$|R

40|$|Various organizations, from <b>catalogue</b> <b>order</b> {{companies}} to {{credit card and}} insurance institutions, employ direct-mail-response as a core marketing strategy. As the demand of a given random selection of prospects is uncertain, many of these corporations use data mining techniques to characterize good prospects in their target audiences and improve the likelihood of response. Conventional approaches to model and target size selection {{in the field of}} data mining assume fixed marginal costs, and consequently static profit-to-cost ratios. In reality, however, marginal costs vary as a result of economies of scale or bulk discounts from suppliers. In this paper, we investigate the impact of variable marginal costs on profit-optimal model and target size selection. We prove analytically that profit-optimal target size selection depends on profit-to-cost ratios. Finally, we show that, to maximize profits, model and targetsize selection should be cognizant of variable marginal costs...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Two {{assembly}} line balancing problems are addressed. The first problem (called SALBP- 1) is to minimize number of linearly <b>ordered</b> <b>stations</b> for processing n partially ordered operations V = 1, 2, [...] ., n within the fixed cycle time c. The second problem (called SALBP- 2) is to minimize cycle time for processing partially ordered operations V on the fixed set of m linearly <b>ordered</b> <b>stations.</b> The processing time ti of each operation i ∈ V is known before solving problems SALBP- 1 and SALBP- 2. However, {{during the life}} cycle of the {{assembly line}} the values ti are definitely fixed only for the subset of automated operations V V Ȧnother subset V ⊆ V includes manual operations, for which it is impossible to fix exact processing times during the whole life cycle of the assembly line. If j V, ∈ then operation times tj can differ for different cycles of the production process. For the optimal line balance b of the assembly line with operation times t 1, t 2, …, tn, we investigate stability of its optimality j...|$|R
