5|$|Only Lion was {{completed}} {{to the original}} design, which had the fore funnel placed between the forward superstructure and the tripod foremast. This meant that hot <b>clinkers</b> and flue gases from the boilers made the spotting top on the foremast completely unworkable when the ships were steaming at high speed, that the upper bridge could easily be rendered uninhabitable, depending on the wind, and that the signal flags and halyards were at risk of burning. Both ships were altered to correct this problem, Lion before being commissioned, and Princess Royal as she was fitting out, at a total cost of £68,170. The fore funnel was moved aft, the original fore and mainmasts exchanged position, and the foremast was now just a pole mast, not a tripod. The spotting tower {{at the rear of}} the conning tower was removed, the conning tower enlarged, the nine-foot Argo rangefinder was moved from the foremast spotting top to the roof of the conning tower, and all the funnels were raised to the same height. As part of these modifications, the two 4-inch guns mounted above the forward group of casemates were enclosed in casemates of their own to protect the gun crews from weather and enemy action.|$|E

40|$|Hydration of <b>clinker</b> {{particles}} is since long a {{topic of}} interest in both designing and optimizing cement composition and its quantity used in concrete. The interest for carefully observing and also quantifying the type or stage of <b>clinker</b> hydration in hardened cement paste is twofold. Firstly, {{the characteristics of the}} hydration features can give useful information on the actual hydration mechanisms (e. g., diffusion versus dissolution). Secondly, considering the different hydration stages more quantitatively can help to study for example the amount of hydration or hydration rate in different types of concrete. In this paper, it is shown that polarization and fluorescent light microscopy (PFM) and backscattered electron microscopy (BSE) can be used to quantify different <b>clinker</b> hydration types in hardened cement paste. Different stages or types of hydration could be distinguished in the <b>clinker</b> grains: (A) unhydrated <b>clinker</b> core without a visible hydration rim, (B) hydrated <b>clinker</b> ‘imprint’, (C) hydrated <b>clinker</b> core with an unhydrated <b>clinker</b> rim and (D) unhydrated <b>clinker</b> core with a clear hydration rim. These different types of <b>clinker</b> hydration can be quantified using point counting. In fluorescent light, the hydrated <b>clinker</b> zones contain more fluorescent dye compared to the unhydrated <b>clinker</b> parts and also {{to the rest of the}} cement paste. This suggests that the <b>clinker</b> may have partly or fully dissolved, creating porosity and that the hydration products have precipitated further away from the <b>clinker</b> particle, resulting in a less porous hardened cement paste. In other words, dissolution and precipitation processes might play a role in the hydration mechanism. Quantifying these different <b>clinker</b> types could also be useful for estimating for example the amount of hydration that took place, or for quantifying the ‘overcapacity’ of unhydrated <b>clinker.</b> The latter gives interesting information to possibly reduce the amount of <b>clinker</b> and as such lower the CO 2 footprint of concrete...|$|R
40|$|To devise {{low-carbon}} cement <b>clinker</b> product, in-depth {{knowledge about}} the variation mechanism of cement <b>clinker</b> CO 2 emissions is the prerequisite. The determinants of cement <b>clinker</b> CO 2 emissions in Chinese cement industry have been inquired by several researches recently. However, the impacts and abatement effect of <b>clinker</b> quality on cement <b>clinker</b> CO 2 emissions have not been identified yet. In technological sense, there lacks an integrated quantitative model that can elucidate the dynamic mechanism between cement <b>clinker</b> CO 2 emissions and <b>clinker</b> quality. To fill this gap, this paper devises a CO 2 emission accounting framework integrated with optimization model to explore the dynamic mechanism between cement <b>clinker</b> CO 2 emissions and <b>clinker</b> quality. Based on survey data of 2 typical cement <b>clinker</b> production lines in China, the accounting framework is validated with measured data. Through numerical simulation within this framework, a set of sensitivity analysis is conducted. The results indicate that if the target KH (lime saturation ratio) of both production lines climb from - 5 % to + 5 %, the process CO 2 emission factor will give rise to an increase of about 16. 4 and 14. 8 kg CO 2 /t <b>clinker,</b> respectively. With the same variation, the fuel CO 2 emission factors of two production lines will gain 17. 2 and 13. 7 kg CO 2 /t <b>clinker,</b> respectively. Obviously, controlled decrease of <b>clinker</b> quality can reduce CO 2 emission of <b>clinker</b> manufacturing. The results of sensitivity analysis are robust and highlight the remarkable role of <b>clinker</b> quality in both process and fuel emissions. Besides, the integrated framework can provide in-depth investigation into the dynamic mechanism between CO 2 emissions and the other determinants. Using this framework, cement plants or industry can develop optimal <b>clinker</b> quality standards on a quantitative basis to achieve low-carbon <b>clinker.</b> (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V.

25|$|Block {{lava flows}} {{are typical of}} andesitic lavas from stratovolcanoes. They behave {{in a similar manner}} to ʻaʻā flows but their more viscous nature causes the surface to be covered in smooth-sided angular {{fragments}} (blocks) of solidified lava instead of <b>clinkers.</b> Like in ʻaʻā flows, the molten interior of the flow, which is kept insulated by the solidified blocky surface, overrides the rubble that falls off the flow front. They also move much more slowly downhill and are thicker in depth than ʻaʻā flows.|$|E
25|$|The loose, broken, and sharp, spiny {{surface of}} an aā flow makes hiking {{difficult}} and slow. The clinkery surface actually covers a massive dense core, {{which is the}} most active part of the flow. As pasty lava in the core travels downslope, the <b>clinkers</b> are carried along at the surface. At the leading edge of an aā flow, however, these cooled fragments tumble down the steep front and are buried by the advancing flow. This produces a layer of lava fragments both at the bottom and top of an aā flow.|$|E
500|$|Born on 10August 1886 at <b>Clinkers</b> Hill near Castlemaine, Victoria, Harrison {{was the son}} of printer and {{stationer}} Joseph Harrison, and his English-born wife Ann.

Gaining employment as an instructor for Bristol, he taught flying on behalf of the company in Spain and Italy, as well as in Halberstadt, Germany, where he became aware first-hand of that country's militarism; some of the students he trained and examined later served as pilots in the Luftstreitkräfte during World WarI.|$|E
40|$|The use of <b>clinker</b> {{microscopy}} as a {{tool for}} quality control in cement manufacturing is not new in cement industries. Mineralogical and chemical studies on <b>clinker</b> will provide information about <b>clinker</b> characteristics and about conditions occurring at various stages of the manufacturing process. Reflected light microscopy that commonly used for this purposes provides more information on the mineralogy of the <b>clinker</b> such as: determination of the main phases, degree of crystallization, alite crystal size, microcracks within the alite crystals and belite clusters. Understanding the <b>clinker</b> microstructure is very crucial in cement manufacturing. It can be a powerful technique that can improve <b>clinker</b> production and quality.

The King George V class also used the same arrangement and they were altered while under construction to remedy the problem at a cost of approximately £20,000 per ship. The fore funnel was moved aft and a makeshift foremast was built from one of the struts of the original tripod mast.

40|$|Cement is an {{important}} construction ingredient produced in virtually all countries. Carbon dioxide (CO 2) is a byproduct of a chemical conversion process used {{in the production of}} <b>clinker,</b> a component of cement, in which limestone (CaCO 3) is converted to lime (CaO). CO 2 is also emitted during cement production by fossil fuel combustion and is accounted for elsewhere. However, the CO 2 from fossil fuels is accounted for elsewhere in emission estimates for fossil fuels. The Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (IPCC Guidelines) provide a general approach to estimate CO 2 emissions from <b>clinker</b> production, in which the amount of <b>clinker</b> produced is multiplied by the <b>clinker</b> emission factor. The IPCC Guidelines recommend two possible methods for calculating the <b>clinker</b> emission factor. The first method is to use the IPCC default value for the fraction of lime in <b>clinker.</b> The second method is to calculate the average lime concentration in <b>clinker</b> by collecting data on <b>clinker</b> production and lime fraction by type. The IPCC Guidelines state that the difference between the default value and a value based on collected data is expected to be small.

In addition, XRD diffractogram of EFB <b>clinker</b> showed two highest peaks at around 2 θ = 27. 2 ° and 31. 5 °, which can be attributed to CaO and K 2 O species, respectively. This finding was also consistent with XRF analysis where potassium (K) and calcium (Ca) were positively identified. Subsequently, methane dry reforming studies revealed that Ni/EFB <b>clinker</b> catalyst always yielded higher formation rates of H 2 and CO.
