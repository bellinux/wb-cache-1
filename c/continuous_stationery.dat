50|$|Continuous form {{paper of}} all types remains in production, {{although}} largely supplanted {{with the introduction of}} fast laser printers with single-sheet feed. <b>Continuous</b> <b>stationery</b> printed on a suitable printer is typically cheaper than laser printing although the output is of lower quality. If an impact printer is used multiple simultaneous copies can be printed on multipart forms. Many laser printers can print {{on both sides of the}} paper (duplex printing), not possible with <b>continuous</b> <b>stationery.</b>|$|E

50|$|Stationery is a mass noun {{referring}} to commercially manufactured writing materials, including cut paper, envelopes, writing implements, <b>continuous</b> <b>stationery,</b> and other office supplies. Stationery includes materials {{to be written}} on by hand (e.g., letter paper) or by equipment such as computer printers.|$|E
50|$|<b>Continuous</b> <b>stationery</b> (UK) or {{continuous}} form paper (USA) is paper {{which is}} designed for use with dot-matrix and line printers with appropriate paper-feed mechanisms. Other names include fan-fold paper, sprocket-feed paper, burst paper, tractor-feed paper, and pin-feed paper. It can be single-ply (usually woodfree uncoated paper) or multi-ply (either with carbon paper between the paper layers, or multiple layers of carbonless copy paper), often described as multipart stationery or forms. <b>Continuous</b> <b>stationery</b> is often used when the final print medium is less critical {{in terms of the}} appearance at the edges, and when continuously connected individual sheets are not inconvenient for the application. Individual sheets can be separated at the perforation (leaving a slight serration), and sheets also have edges with punched holes, which also can be removed at the perforation (one typical format).|$|E
5000|$|LocoScript {{allowed the}} user to edit one {{document}} while printing another, so that the relative slowness of the bundled dot matrix printer seldom caused difficulties. Users could ask for all of a document to be printed or a range of pages, set the print quality to [...] "high quality" [...] or [...] "draft", and set the paper used to single-sheet or <b>continuous</b> <b>stationery.</b> LocoScript automatically adjusted the size of margins so that {{the same number of}} lines per page appeared on both single-sheet and <b>continuous</b> <b>stationery.</b> Since the printer only accepted one sheet of single-sheet paper at a time, LocoScript displayed a prompt {{at the end of each}} page when in single-sheet mode. The program also had the ability to resume at a specified page after a paper jam. In addition to printing LocoScript documents, the program had a [...] "direct printing" [...] mode which operated like a typewriter, printing each piece of text after the user pressed RETURN. This could be used for completing forms.|$|E
5000|$|The {{paper is}} then fed onto reels {{if it is}} to be used on web {{printing}} presses, or cut into sheets for other printing processes or other purposes. The fibres in the paper basically run in the machine direction. Sheets are usually cut [...] "long-grain", i.e. with the grain parallel to the longer dimension of the sheet. Continuous form paper (or <b>continuous</b> <b>stationery)</b> is cut to width with holes punched at the edges, and folded into stacks.|$|E
50|$|Dot matrix {{printers}} {{are still}} {{commonly used in}} low-cost, low-quality applications such as cash registers, or in demanding, very high volume applications like invoice printing. Impact printing, unlike laser printing, allows {{the pressure of the}} print head to be applied to a stack of two or more forms to print multi-part documents such as sales invoices and credit card receipts using <b>continuous</b> <b>stationery</b> with carbonless copy paper. Dot-matrix printers were being superseded even as receipt printers {{after the end of the}} twentieth century.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the standard character set, a rich set of graphic symbols and a comprehensive set of control characters were supported in teletex. The set of control characters helped in preparation and reproduction of documents. In particular, they permitted the positioning of the printing element, specification of page orientation, left and right margins, vertical spacing {{and the use of}} underlining. The page control feature allowed standard A4 size papers to be used for receiving messages instead of the <b>continuous</b> <b>stationery</b> used in conventional telex systems.|$|E
50|$|Carbonless {{copy paper}} was first {{produced}} by the NCR Corporation. Formerly, the options were to write documents more than once or use carbon paper, which was inserted between the sheet being written upon and the copy. Carbonless paper was used as business stationery requiring one or more copies of the original, such as invoices and receipts. The copies were often paper of different colors (e.g. white original for customer, yellow copy for supplier's records, and other colors for subsequent copies). Stationery with carbonless copy paper can be supplied collated either in pads or books bound into sets, or as loose sets, or as <b>continuous</b> <b>stationery</b> for printers designed to use it.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, most {{mainframes}} had no explicitly interactive interface, but only accepted sets of punched cards, paper tape, or magnetic tape to transfer data and programs. They operated {{in batch mode}} to support back office functions such as payroll and customer billing, much of {{which was based on}} repeated tape-based sorting and merging operations followed by a print run to preprinted <b>continuous</b> <b>stationery.</b> In cases where interactive terminals were supported, these were used almost exclusively for applications (e.g. airline booking) rather than program development. Typewriter and Teletype devices were also common control consoles for system operators through the 1970s, although ultimately supplanted by keyboard/display devices.|$|E
5000|$|The {{dot matrix}} printer had a sheet feed for short {{documents}} and a tractor attachment for long reports on <b>continuous</b> <b>stationery.</b> [...] This unit could print 90 characters per second at draft quality and 20 characters per second at higher quality, and could also produce graphics. However it had only 9 printing pins and even its higher quality did not match that of 24-pin printers. The {{dot matrix printer}} was not very robust as its chassis was made entirely of plastic. Users who needed to support higher print volumes or to produce graphics could buy a daisy-wheel printer or graph plotter from Amstrad. The daisy-wheel printer could not produce graphics.|$|E
50|$|The first {{commercial}} {{implementation of a}} laser printer was the IBM 3800 in 1976. It was designed for data centers, where it replaced line printers attached to mainframe computers. The IBM 3800 was used for high-volume printing on <b>continuous</b> <b>stationery,</b> and achieved speeds of 215 pages per minute (ppm), at a resolution of 240 dots per inch (dpi). Over 8,000 of these printers were sold. The Xerox 9700 was brought to market in 1977. Unlike the IBM 3800, the Xerox 9700 was not targeted to replace any particular existing printers; but, it did have limited support for the loading of fonts. The Xerox 9700 excelled at printing high-value documents on cut-sheet paper with varying content (e.g. insurance policies).|$|E
5000|$|One often-overlooked {{application}} for dot-matrix printers {{is in the}} field of IT security. Copies of various system and server activity logs are typically stored on the local filesystem, where a remote attacker - having achieved their primary goals - can then alter or delete the contents of the logs, in an attempt to [...] "cover their tracks" [...] or otherwise thwart the efforts of system administrators and security experts. However, if the log entries are simultaneously output to a printer, line-by-line, a local hard-copy record of system activity is created - and this cannot be remotely altered or otherwise manipulated. Dot-matrix printers are ideal for this task, as they can sequentially print each log entry, one entry at a time, as they are added to the log. The usual dot-matrix printer support for <b>continuous</b> <b>stationery</b> also prevents incriminating pages from being surreptitiously removed or altered without evidence of tampering.|$|E
5000|$|Multipart or {{multi-part}} stationery is {{paper that}} is blank, or preprinted {{as a form}} to be completed, comprising a stack of several copies, either on carbonless paper or plain paper interleaved with carbon paper. The stationery may be bound into books with tear-out sheets to be filled in manually, <b>continuous</b> <b>stationery</b> (fanfold sheet or roll) for use in suitable computer printers, or as individual stacks, usually crimped together. The purpose is to produce multiple simultaneous copies of a document produced by handwriting with a pen that applies pressure, such as a ballpoint pen, or with an impact printer. [...] The pressure of writing or impact printing on the carbon or carbonless paper transfers the content to the copy sheets. Depending upon requirements, up to typically four copies of the original can be made, with the quality and readability decreasing towards the bottom copies.This type of stationery can be used whenever multiple copies are required, of quality adequate for the purpose, usually noticeably inferior to, for example, laser-printed output. Typically a company may need a document such as an invoice to give to a customer (original), with a copy for their own accounting department (first copy), and possibly further copies for other purposes. The paper stock used is typically of low weight—thin—to transfer more printing pressure. The different copies can be on paper of different colour to distinguish them, and preprinted content may vary between copies.|$|E
