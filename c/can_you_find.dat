500|$|The ninth season {{received}} more positive reviews, Rob Salem of Toronto Star called it [...] "a solid return to form." [...] Brad Williams writing for What Culture praised the show's development over the season saying, [...] "Grey's Anatomy has {{developed into a}} fine example of how a TV show can mature beyond its initial purpose." [...] calling it [...] "something almost anyone can watch and enjoy." [...] Praising the friendship between Cristina and Meredith of Entertainment Weekly wrote, [...] "There's still one good reason to keep watching: Where else <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> such deep friendships between female co-workers". The tenth season was also marked with praise, Annie Barrett for Entertainment Weekly wrote [...] "There's true sorrow here along with the passion, which keeps their dynamic so intriguing to me." [...] Caroline Siede from The A.V. Club wrote in her review for the 10th season [...] "At its best, Grey's Anatomy is about everyday bravery, sacrifice, and courage. At its worst, it's a melodramatic, moralizing soap opera. Both sides are on display as the show heads confidently into its 10th season." [...] Many sources, including Rachel Simon of Bustle and Nicole Pomarico of Wetpaint, claimed that Sandra Oh's performance during her final season on Grey's Anatomy is worthy of an Emmy nomination.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} a pink mailbox with the song's title on the front written in {{different}} fonts. The video {{is set in a}} playhouse esque brightly coloured house. Minaj spits her first verse in a spacious room filled with antler heads and wacky windows, Minaj is seen standing on a zebra print carpet. Minaj's second appearance saw her in a bathtub, partially clothed - wearing only Alexander McQueen “Armadillo” jewel encrusted 12-inch stiletto shoes. She also wore a green, Marilyn Monroe inspired wig. There is also a scene with all three rappers. After the hook, Rick Ross is seen sitting at a gold banquet table reciting his rap, shirtless, whilst gold maniquins ascend behind him. For Cam'ron's verse the scene is located on a staircase of moving photos of the three rappers. Nicki's Young Money labelmate, Tyga also made a brief cameo appearance in the video. The video garnered positive reviews from critics, noting its high energy, fun and wackiness. MTV's Rob Markman gave the video a positive review saying, [...] "Only in a Nicki Minaj video <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> two of rap's hardest street figures performing in such a wacky setting, but it's the juxtaposition that [...] "I Am Your Leader" [...] offers which makes it so fun." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{computer}} animation {{used throughout the}} film was more complex than anything DreamWorks had done before. When the head of production handed the script to VFX Supervisor Markus Manninen, she reportedly laughed and wished him [...] "good luck". [...] "When we started talking," [...] said Manninen, [...] "the movie was still a high concept. But for everyone that looked at it, it screamed complexity. We launched off saying, how can you make this movie tangible? How <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> smart ways to bring this world to life {{in a way that}} makes it a great movie and not feel like the complexity becomes the driver of the story, but the story and the emotion being the driver?" [...] In preparation, the animators took a six-hour kung fu class.|$|E
