25|$|Sati is an old, almost {{completely}} defunct custom among some <b>communities,</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the widow was immolated alive on her husband's funeral pyre. Although {{the act was}} supposed to be voluntary on the widow's part, its practice is forbidden by the Hindu scriptures in Kali yuga, the current age. After the foreign invasions of Indian subcontinent, this practice started to mark its presence, as women were often raped or kidnapped by the foreign forces. It was abolished by the British in 1829. There have been around forty reported cases of sati since independence. In 1987, the Roop Kanwar case in Rajasthan led to The Commission of Sati (Prevention) Act.|$|E
25|$|A lot {{of modern}} {{criticism}} {{tries to find}} hidden structure or some unifying principle within the odes. 19th century criticism favoured 'gnomic unity' i.e. that each ode is bound together {{by the kind of}} moralizing or philosophic vision typical of archaic Gnomic poetry. Later critics sought unity in the way certain words or images are repeated and developed within a particular ode. For others, the odes are just celebrations of men and their <b>communities,</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the elements such as myths, piety, and ethics are stock themes that the poet introduces without much real thought. Some conclude that the requirement for unity is too modern to have informed Pindar's ancient approach to a traditional craft.|$|E
25|$|The {{religion}} {{entered a}} new phase of activity when a message of the Universal House of Justice dated 20 October 1983 was released. In December 1983 the national assembly registered with the government as an NGO.

World-wide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. In 1980, the Haitian Bahá'í community started an elementary school (Anís Zunúzí), later joined by a forest protection program, and a variety of village kindergartens.|$|E

Physical and mental ailments plaguing older adults can be healed through the simple act of helping others; however, one must be performing the good deed from a selfless nature. There are barriers that can prevent older adults from participating in volunteer work, such as socio-economic status, opinions held by others, and even current health issues. However, these barriers can be overcome so that if one would like to be involved in volunteer work they can do so. Volunteering improves not only the <b>communities</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> one serves, but also the life of the individual who is providing help to the community.|$|E
25|$|In 1692, the Spanish, led by Don Diego de Vargas, reconquered New Mexico. This time colonizers {{were able}} to coexist with the Pueblo Indians. The Spanish {{established}} many <b>communities</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> Catholicism and the Spanish language combined with the culture and myths of the Pueblo Indians. New Mexico gained independence from Spain in 1821 and eventually achieved independent statehood in the United States of America in 1912. The mixed cultural influences and {{a long history of}} intermarriage among the Hispanos and the indigenous peoples (i.e.,the mestizaje) remained largely intact throughout rural New Mexico well into the 20th century. The colonization of New Mexico by Spanish colonists resulted, therefore, in a combination of indigenous myths with Catholicism. As the Hispano community's beliefs and ways of doing things interacted with those of the Native Americans a cultural pattern where indigenous myth maintained importance alongside Catholic doctrine evolved.|$|E
