30|$|Variables {{related to}} DO 2 may <b>correlate</b> <b>with</b> NIRS parameters. Rres <b>correlates</b> <b>with</b> cardiac output {{and to a}} lesser extent with blood lactate levels in septic {{patients}} [34], whereas StO 2 does not <b>correlate</b> <b>with</b> lactate or base deficit [67]. A low StO 2 predicts a very low DO 2 in early sepsis with high sensitivity and specificity [76]; however, moderately low DO 2 does not <b>correlate</b> <b>with</b> StO 2. Neither was change in Rres correlated to change in cardiac output in septic patients. Finally, StO 2 did not <b>correlate</b> <b>with</b> the severity of illness [67], but a StO 2 < 78 % in resuscitated patients predicted mortality [77]. Low Rres <b>correlates</b> <b>with</b> organ failure [31] and Rres is lower in nonsurvivors than survivors [34].|$|R

50|$|The {{ground state}} Ψ12Ψ22 of 1,3-butadiene <b>correlates</b> <b>with</b> the ground state σ2π2 of cyclobutene as {{demonstrated}} in the MO correlation diagram above. Ψ1 <b>correlates</b> <b>with</b> π and Ψ2 <b>correlates</b> <b>with</b> σ. Thus the orbitals making up Ψ12Ψ22 must transform into the orbitals making up σ2π2 under a conrotatory mechanism. However, the state ES-1 does not <b>correlate</b> <b>with</b> the state ES-1' as the molecular orbitals do not transform into each other under the symmetry-requirement seen in the molecular orbital correlation diagram. Instead as Ψ1 <b>correlates</b> <b>with</b> π, Ψ2 <b>correlates</b> <b>with</b> σ, and Ψ3 <b>correlates</b> <b>with</b> σ*, the state Ψ12Ψ2Ψ3 attempts to transform into π2σσ*, which is a different excited state. So ES-1 attempts to <b>correlate</b> <b>with</b> ES-2'=σπ2σ*, which is higher in energy than Es-1'. Similarly ES-1'=σ2ππ* attempts to <b>correlate</b> <b>with</b> ES-2=Ψ1Ψ22Ψ4. These correlations can not actually take place due to the quantum-mechanical rule known as the avoided crossing rule. This says that energetic configurations of the same symmetry can not cross on an energy level correlation diagram. In short, this is caused by mixing of states of the same symmetry when brought close enough in energy. So instead a high energetic barrier is formed between a forced transformation of ES-1 into ES-1'. In the diagram below the symmetry-preferred correlations are shown in dashed lines and the bold curved lines indicate the actual correlation with the high energetic barrier.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore how an individual’s {{religion}} relates to their time orientation. Specifically, we hypothesized a) intrinsic orientation would positively <b>correlate</b> <b>with</b> future orientation, b) extrinsic orientation would positively <b>correlate</b> <b>with</b> present hedonistic orientation, c) quest orientation would positively <b>correlate</b> <b>with</b> present hedonistic and future orientations, d) orthodox orientation would positively <b>correlate</b> <b>with</b> past positive orientation, and e) secularism would positively <b>correlate</b> <b>with</b> past negative orientation, present-fatalistic and future orientations. Participants (n = 150) completed an online survey of time orientation and religious orientation. The results showed that perceptions of the past are strongly linked to religious orientation, with more positive perceptions being linked to the more traditional orientations, and less positive perceptions linked to the looser and secularist orientations...|$|R
5|$|Modulation {{of neural}} {{responses}} may correlate with phenomenal experiences. In {{contrast to the}} raw electrical responses that do not correlate with consciousness, the modulation of these responses by other stimuli correlates surprisingly well with {{an important aspect of}} consciousness: namely with the phenomenal experience of stimulus intensity (brightness, contrast). In the research group of Danko Nikolić {{it has been shown that}} some of the changes in the subjectively perceived brightness <b>correlated</b> <b>with</b> the modulation of firing rates while others <b>correlated</b> <b>with</b> the modulation of neural synchrony. An fMRI investigation suggested that these findings were strictly limited to the primary visual areas. This indicates that, in the primary visual areas, changes in firing rates and synchrony can be considered as neural correlates of qualia—at least for some type of qualia.|$|E

50|$|To {{determine}} symmetry and asymmetry {{with respect}} to σ1 and σ2, the starting material molecular orbitals {{must be considered in}} tandem. The figure to the right shows the molecular orbital correlation diagram for the π2s+π2s cycloaddition. The two π and π* molecular orbitals of the starting materials are characterized by their symmetry {{with respect to}} first σ1 and then σ2. Similarly, the σ and σ* molecular orbitals of the product are characterized by their symmetry. In the correlation diagram, molecular orbitals transformations {{over the course of the}} reaction must conserve the symmetry of the molecular orbitals. Thus πSS <b>correlates</b> <b>with</b> σSS, πAS <b>correlates</b> <b>with</b> σ*AS, π*SA <b>correlates</b> <b>with</b> σSA, and finally π*AA <b>correlates</b> <b>with</b> σ*AA. Due to conservation of orbital symmetry, the bonding orbital πAS is forced to <b>correlate</b> <b>with</b> the antibonding orbital σ*AS. Thus a high barrier is predicted.|$|R
25|$|A {{large scale}} survey of {{residents}} of Great Britain found that average levels {{of all the}} Big Five, including conscientiousness, vary across regional districts in England, Wales and Scotland.
