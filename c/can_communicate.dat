5|$|KSAT {{operates}} two polar ground stations {{optimized for}} low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites, the other being TrollSat at Troll in Antarctica. These {{are the only}} two ground stations able to see a polar-orbiting satellite on every revolution. By using both stations, customers <b>can</b> <b>communicate</b> with a satellite twice per orbit.|$|E
5|$|The Terrestrial Trunked Radio {{network has}} three {{components:}} the core net, {{which is a}} centralized computer center based on an Internet Protocol structure; the transmission net, which connects the core net, the radio net and other connection points with high-capacity lines; and the radio net, which consists of base stations with antennas in masts, on buildings and in some tunnels. The network is controlled by Motorola. In case a base station no longer <b>can</b> <b>communicate</b> with the core net, the base station can still relay communication within its range. Should the base station fall out or operations occur in areas without coverage, the terminals <b>can</b> <b>communicate</b> directly with each other.|$|E
5|$|In the manga The Saga of Darren Shan, the titular {{character}} is fascinated by spiders. He kept them as pets until he killed {{one that he}} got when he was nine years old. He used {{to let them go}} into his mouth and he'd imagine them eating him from the inside out. Normally, the spiders would stay with him for about a day or two, but some lasted longer. Later on, we find out that he <b>can</b> <b>communicate</b> with spiders.|$|E

40|$|Basic pairs {{and their}} morphisms {{are the most}} {{elementary}} framework in which standard topological notions can be defined. We present here a new interpretation of topological concepts as those which <b>can</b> be <b>communicated</b> faithfully {{between the two sides}} of basic pairs. In particular, we prove that the subsets which <b>can</b> be <b>communicated</b> faithfully (in the suitable way) are exactly open subsets and closed subsets. We also prove that a relation (and in particular a function) between two sets of points <b>can</b> be <b>communicated</b> faithfully if and only if it is continuous...|$|R

5|$|Some mammals are intelligent, {{with some}} {{possessing}} large brains, self-awareness and tool use. Mammals <b>can</b> <b>communicate</b> and vocalize {{in several different}} ways, including the production of ultrasound, scent-marking, alarm signals, singing, and echolocation. Mammals can organize themselves into fission-fusion societies, harems, and hierarchies, but can also be solitary and territorial. Most mammals are polygynous, but some can be monogamous or polyandrous.|$|E
5|$|Watney {{takes the}} rover to {{retrieve}} the nearby Pathfinder probe, which fell silent in 1997. Using the lander's camera, he establishes rudimentary communication with Earth, first with plastic bin lids, and then using hexadecimals. NASA instructs Watney to partially modify the rover's code to link with Pathfinder so they <b>can</b> <b>communicate</b> via text. Watney becomes angry when he learns that the crew has not been told of his survival (and openly expresses it), and Sanders reluctantly lets Henderson finally inform them.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} time the player defeats the Elite Four, one of the members, Lorelei, disappears. After gaining access to the Sevii Islands, an entirely new region, the player discovers Lorelei in her house and convinces her to come back with him. Once more, the protagonist must thwart the Team Rocket's plans on several occasions, recover two artifacts, the Ruby and the Sapphire, {{and put them in the}} main {{computer}} at One Island. After that, the player <b>can</b> <b>communicate,</b> battle, trade, etc., with Ruby and Sapphire.|$|E

5|$|Heathen deities are {{not seen}} as perfect, omnipotent, and omnipresent, and are instead viewed as having their own {{strengths}} and weaknesses. Many practitioners believe that these deities will one day die, as did, for instance, the god Baldr in Norse mythology. Heathens view their connection with their deities not as being that of a master and servant but rather as an interdependent relationship akin {{to that of a}} family. For them, these deities serve as both examples and role models whose behavior is to be imitated. Many practitioners believe that they <b>can</b> <b>communicate</b> with these deities, as well as negotiate, bargain, and argue with them, and hope that through venerating them, practitioners will gain wisdom, understanding, power, or visionary insights.|$|E
5|$|Human {{language}} is also unique {{in being able}} to refer to abstract concepts and to imagined or hypothetical events as well as events {{that took place in the}} past or may happen in the future. This ability to refer to events that are not at the same time or place as the speech event is called displacement, and while some animal communication systems can use displacement (such as the communication of bees that <b>can</b> <b>communicate</b> the location of sources of nectar that are out of sight), the degree to which it is used in human {{language is}} also considered unique.|$|E
5|$|Kiarostami's films often {{reflect upon}} {{immaterial}} {{concepts such as}} the soul and afterlife. At times, however, {{the very concept of}} the spiritual seems to be contradicted by the medium itself, given that it has no inherent means to confer the metaphysical. Some film theorists have argued that The Wind Will Carry Us provides a template by which a filmmaker <b>can</b> <b>communicate</b> metaphysical reality. The limits of the frame and the representation through dialogue with another that is not represented, physically become metaphors for the relationship between this world and those that may exist apart from it. By limiting the space of the mise en scène, Kiarostami expands the space of the art.|$|E

5|$|Sheldon Plankton {{is married}} to a {{supercomputer}} named Karen Plankton, who is also his sidekick and best friend. Karen is Plankton's own invention, assembled from a calculator and a mass of wires. She was Plankton's first invention when he was in grade school, and they dated before he became evil. Her system is built into most of Plankton's machines (including the Chum Bucket itself) so that she and Plankton <b>can</b> <b>communicate</b> while the latter is on a mission. She is a Mark II Surplus UNIVAC with 256 gigabytes of random-access memory.|$|E
5|$|The site is {{only able}} to {{communicate}} with LEO satellites in ten of their fourteen orbits, unlike SvalSat and TrollSat which <b>can</b> <b>communicate</b> in all orbits. All three stations are interconnected and communicate with the Tromsø Network Operations Center, {{which is part of the}} TSS complex. This allows for redundancy as TSS, SvalSat and TrollSat can be used to communicate with all satellites connected to the system. The operation center is responsible for backup, scheduling and conflict resolution, in addition to network planning, customer support and ground station control. The facilities use interoperability and shared ground services, such as a common protocol for communication and similar design of the antennas, to increase flexibility and reduce costs and risk.|$|E
5|$|Through SMS, users <b>can</b> <b>communicate</b> with Twitter {{through five}} gateway numbers: short codes for the United States, Canada, India, New Zealand, and an Isle of Man-based number for {{international}} use. There {{is also a}} short code in the United Kingdom which is only accessible to those on the Vodafone, O2 and Orange networks. In India, since Twitter only supports tweets from Bharti Airtel, an alternative platform called smsTweet {{was set up by}} a user to work on all networks. A similar platform called GladlyCast exists for mobile phone users in Singapore and Malaysia.|$|E

Since birth, Jodie has had a psychic connection with a mysterious entity named Aiden, with whom she <b>can</b> <b>communicate</b> and perform telepathic acts, such as possessing peoples' minds and manipulating certain objects. After an incident with some neighbourhood kids results in Aiden almost killing one of them, Jodie's foster parents seek help {{to care for her}} condition, permanently leaving her under the custody of doctors Nathan Dawkins (Willem Dafoe) and Cole Freeman (Kadeem Hardison) of the United States Department of Paranormal Activity.|$|E
5|$|Green <b>can</b> <b>communicate</b> {{safety to}} proceed, as in traffic lights. Green and red were {{standardized}} as {{the colors of}} international railroad signals in the 19th century. The first traffic light, using green and red gas lamps, was erected in 1868 {{in front of the}} Houses of Parliament in London. It exploded the following year, injuring the policeman who operated it. In 1912, the first modern electric traffic lights were put up in Salt Lake City, Utah. Red was chosen largely because of its high visibility, and its association with danger, while green was chosen largely because it could not be mistaken for red. Today green lights universally signal that a system is turned on and working as it should. In many video games, green signifies both health and completed objectives, opposite red.|$|E
5|$|In Shin Megami Tensei, players {{take the}} role of an unnamed protagonist, a teenage boy who <b>can</b> <b>communicate</b> with demons using a {{computer}} program. The gameplay {{is similar to that of}} other games in the series: players make their way through dungeons and fight against demons in a first-person perspective. The protagonist uses a variety of weapons and items, with the primary weapons being swords and guns. Such items are bought from merchants scattered around the world map. In special areas, the protagonist can use the in-game currency to restore health and magic points for themselves and their demons, remove status ailments, and revive fallen demons. Special Terminals scattered across the world map allow the player to save their game, and they can use them to teleport between terminals in different areas of Tokyo.|$|E

5|$|In {{a parody}} of The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, Homer begins to {{decorate}} the house for Halloween and is reaching for a decoration in a box. Unfortunately, {{there is a real}} Black Widow spider in the box and when Homer grabs what he thinks is a plastic spider, he is bitten by it. The bite leaves Homer paralyzed and unable to speak. When Lisa reads for him, she discovers that he <b>can</b> <b>communicate</b> through farting. The Simpson family is amazed at the result and Lisa helps Homer tell Marge how he feels about her. When he is again bitten by another spider (a radioactive one this time), he gains the ability to shoot spider webs out of his rear end and have the same abilities as Spider-Man, though he is still unable to move or talk.|$|E
