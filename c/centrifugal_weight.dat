50|$|The {{final drive}} has two pulleys with {{moveable}} conical drums. The {{distance between the}} drums {{is controlled by the}} engine vacuum in the inlet manifold and engine RPM, through <b>centrifugal</b> <b>weights</b> inside the drums. Between the two pulleys runs a drive belt. As a result of change in the distance of the conical drums in both pulleys, the diameters and so also the reduction ratio changes continuously.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} Autobike {{was equipped}} with a system of <b>centrifugal</b> <b>weights</b> on the rear wheel with a rear derailleur attached to them. When the rider started pedaling it would cause the weights to spin outwards, which shifted the derailleur to a higher gear. When the rider stops pedaling and the bike comes to a stop, the weights {{would return to the}} centre position, shifting the bike into its lowest gear to get started.|$|R
50|$|Three {{methods are}} used to vary the pitch. Engine oil {{pressure}} is the usual mechanism used in commercial aircraft and the Continental and Lycoming engines fitted to light aircraft. Alternatively, or additionally, <b>centrifugal</b> <b>weights</b> may be attached directly to the propeller as in the Yakovlev Yak-52. Small, modern engines with a CSU, such as the Rotax 912, may use either the traditional hydraulic method or an electrical pitch control mechanism. A pilot requires some additional training and, in most jurisdictions, a formal signoff before being allowed to fly aircraft fitted with a CSU. CSUs {{are not allowed to}} be fitted to aircraft certified under light-sport aircraft regulations in the United States.|$|R
50|$|Invented by Dutch {{millwright}} Ten Have of Vorden, Ten Have sails have a {{small number}} of wide longitudinal shutters, operating by <b>centrifugal</b> <b>weights</b> and often also by the miller at the tail of the mill similar to patent sails. This way the sail can be adjusted without stopping the mill. The leading edge is commonly streamlined by the Van Bussel system. Ten Have shutters are normally only used on one stock as the wide Ten Have shutters standing open on a vertical stock would leave this stock vulnerable to side winds during a storm.Beckers sails are an alternative to Ten Have sails. Only two mills in the Netherlands were fitted with them.|$|R
50|$|The Bilau {{system uses}} sails with a {{streamline}} covering of the stock, {{coupled with a}} full length air brake on the trailing edge, together forming an airfoil. The airbrake is opened by <b>centrifugal</b> <b>weights</b> in the sails but can also be operated by the miller similar to the patent system. When opening the airbrake disturbs the airfoil shape thereby slowing the mill. It was invented by German airplane engineer Kurt Bilau early {{in the twentieth century}} and became quite popular in Germany where it was fitted to over 140 mills. A similar system was invented by a millwright by the name of Van Riet of Goes where the leading edge and the airbrake together form a more complete airfoil.|$|R

50|$|The 600 was {{the first}} {{production}} car after the 1920s Clyno to have a continuously variable transmission (CVT) system - the innovative DAF Variomatic. The DAF Variomatic employs engine speed, via <b>centrifugal</b> <b>weights,</b> to shift the transmission and is enhanced by an engine manifold vacuum. It was the only car ever produced which went faster by the simple expedient of gently and gradually releasing the accelerator once top speed had been reached. This increased manifold vacuum which helped the variable pulleys shift to an even higher ratio so even though the engine RPM stays the same, the transmission increases the car's speed, {{in the case of}} the DAF 600, from 60 mi/h km/h to nearly 70 mi/h km/h given enough time and level road.|$|R

Considering twist angle of blade, <b>centrifugal</b> force, <b>weight</b> of blade, weight of tower and nacelle, turbine inertia, traditional transfer matrix theory is amended and applied in the mode analysis of wind turbine in this paper. Applying amended transfer matrix theory, the mode analysis of a real wind turbine is made and the analysis results are compared with the calculation results from NREL Mode program. The comparison results show that amended transfer matrix theory takes wind turbine inertia into account and have higher accuracy...|$|R

5000|$|The {{solution}} {{developed for}} high-speed steam engines was the [...] "automatic" [...] governor. Rather than controlling the flow rate of steam, it controlled the timing or 'cut-off' of the inlet valves. This governor was interspersed between the crankshaft and the eccentric driving the valve gear. It was often made {{as part of}} the engine's flywheel. A <b>centrifugal</b> bob <b>weight</b> in the governor moved out against a spring with increasing speed. This caused the eccentric's position to shift relative to the crank, changing the valve timing and causing an early cut-off. As this control acted directly at the cylinder port, rather than through a long pipe from a throttle valve, it could be very fast-acting.|$|R
50|$|The DAF 600 was {{the first}} car to have a {{continuously}} variable transmission (CVT) system - the innovative DAF Variomatic., the same system was carried over to the 750 and its variants. The DAF Variomatic employs <b>centrifugal</b> <b>weights</b> to control the drive ratio of the transmission and is enhanced by the engine manifold vacuum. The action of the bob weights and inlet vacuum combined to pull together the cheeks of two, variable diameter, driving pulleys, driven directly from the engine. These were connected, by rubber 'V' belts, to two similar driven pulleys, connected to the drive wheels. The cheeks of the driven pulleys were held together by spring tension, which was progressively overcome as the drive pulleys expanded and the tension of the belts increased. The DAF Variomatics were thereby the only cars ever produced which went faster by the simple expedient of gently and gradually releasing the accelerator once top engine speed had been reached, as the increased vacuum took over from the reducing bob weight speed. The Variomatic also permitted increased engine braking by operating a switch on the dashboard which reversed {{the action of the}} vacuum on the pulley's diaphragm, seeking a lower ratio with increased manifold vacuum. Two separate transmissions ran the two driving wheels, eliminating the need for a differential. The two transmissions could provide different drive ratios, permitting the wheels to rotate at different speeds. The duplication also provided redundancy. If one belt broke, the vehicle could still be driven.An interesting feature: putting the car in reverse reversed the entire drive system. This enabled the vehicle, at least the earlier examples, in theory to reach the same top speed in reverse as forward.|$|R

40|$|Track 2 Nanofluids - Session: 2. 2 Production and Characterization of Nanofluids: MNHMT 2009 - 18282 The {{preparation}} of nanofluids with good suspending stability {{is an important}} premise for further scientific research and engineering application. However, previous studies mainly focused on the stability of nanofluids in static situation without any flow, and seldom discussed the suspending stability of nanofluids in flow. The objective {{of this study is}} to investigate the suspending stability of nanofluids in flow using TiO 2 -water nanofluids flowing through a circular tube as an example. The study uses the <b>centrifugal</b> sedimentation <b>weight</b> of supernatant suspending solution to characterize the stability of nanofluids. The bigger <b>centrifugal</b> sedimentation <b>weight</b> represents the better stability. This study also characterization of particle size distribution of nanofluids by Malvern laser particle size analyzer. In the present experiment conditions, TiO 2 -water nanofluids with the mass fraction of 0. 5 % are driven by a peristaltic pump and flows through a circular tube with 4. 8 mm inner diameter. In the present experimental conditions, the volume flow rate of TiO 2 -water nanofluids is slightly lower than that of pure water. The size distribution of nanoparticle in fluid after circulating flow 2 hours behaves more uniformly than that in a fluid after maintaining static situation 2 hours. with the increasing of Reynolds number of fluid in circulating flow, the suspending stability of nanofluids in circulating flow is significantly higher that that in static situation. When the Reynolds number is up to 2000, the suspending status of nanoparticles in the base fluid is nearly the same as the initial status of sample before circulating. Despite its preliminary, this work demonstrates that the flow pattern is one of influence factors on the suspending stability of nanofluids, which should not be ignored in the study of the suspending stability and heat transfer performance of nanofluids. This study may give some inspiration for further research on relative fields such as the {{preparation of}} nanofluids for heat transfer enhancement and so on. © 2009 by ASME. link_to_subscribed_fulltextThe ASME 2 nd International Conference on Micro/Nanoscale Heat and Mass Transfer (MNHMT 2009), Shanghai, China, 18 - 21 December 2009.

50|$|A {{rotating}} system of mass is in dynamic balance when the rotation {{does not produce}} any resultant centrifugal force or couple. The system rotates without requiring the application of any external force or couple, other than that required to support its weight. If a system is initially unbalanced, to avoid the stress upon the bearings caused by the <b>centrifugal</b> couple, counterbalancing <b>weights</b> must be added.This is seen when a bicycle wheel gets buckled. The wheel will not rotate itself when stationary due to gravity as it is still statically balanced, but will not rotate smoothly as the centre of mass is {{to the side of}} the centre bearing. The spokes on a bike wheel need to be tuned in order to stop this and keep the wheel operating as efficiently as possible.|$|R
40|$|Medicinal use {{of honey}} has re-emerged {{recently}} indicating that honey accelerates wound healing activity. Honey {{has been shown}} to stimulate TNF-α production from monocytes and macrophages which is apparently correlated with a high molecular weight fraction, and not lipopolysaccharide (LPS, an immunostimulatory endotoxin) levels. Cytokine production by honey has been attributed to the endotoxin content. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the ability of Comvita sourced honeys to elicit a TNF-α cytokine response from acute monocytic leukemia (THP- 1) cells as well as identify the responsible component. Five honey samples were used together with sugar and methylglyoxal controls. The samples were incubated with THP- 1 cells, with and without LPS. After incubation, the cell culture supernatants were collected and TNF-α was measured by the enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay (ELISA). The most active honey samples were further heat-treated to remove enzyme/protein/peptide-like stimulation; the samples were treated with polymixin [i. e. polymyxin] B (PmB) to remove LPS-like stimulation and not protein fraction. The samples were then filtered by molecular <b>weight</b> <b>centrifugal</b> filters to separate constituents according to their size and the fractions were re-analysed. All five honey samples in the absence of LPS stimulated TNF-α release from THP- 1 cells, whereas untreated, sugar- and methylglyoxal-treated cells did not. The cytokine production was partially inhibited by heating, but mostly by PmB. In the filtered honey samples, the activity was observed in the > 30 kDa fraction. These results suggest that the activity may be associated with one or more components which are partially heat-labile, LPS-like stimulated with a high molecular weight. Further, honey samples were analyzed for the concentration of LPS present. The tests revealed that the cytokine stimulation was higher than would be expected from the concentration of LPS present in the honey. The possibility that this component was a plant-derived ß-glucan, which is known to have LPS-like activity and can interfere with detection of LPS in the LAL assay, was investigated. Subsequent analyses confirmed the presence of arabinogalactan, a large complex carbohydrate. The data presented in this study suggests that arabinogalactans in honey may stimulate inflammatory responses and the release of cytokines that are crucial in regulating wound- healing. This heralds a significant advancement in the usage and understanding of medicinal honey...|$|R
