5|$|A white dwarf, {{also called}} a {{degenerate}} dwarf, is a stellar core remnant composed mostly of electron-degenerate matter. A white dwarf is very dense: its mass is <b>comparable</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of the Sun, while its volume is <b>comparable</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of Earth. A white dwarf's faint luminosity {{comes from the}} emission of stored thermal energy; no fusion {{takes place in a}} white dwarf wherein mass is converted to energy. The nearest known white dwarf is Sirius B, at 8.6 light years, the smaller component of the Sirius binary star. There are currently thought to be eight white dwarfs among the hundred star systems nearest the Sun. The unusual faintness of white dwarfs was first recognized in 1910. The name white dwarf was coined by Willem Luyten in 1922.|$|E
5|$|Among the tetrahedrally bonded semiconductors, it {{has been}} stated that ZnO has the highest {{piezoelectric}} tensor, {{or at least one}} <b>comparable</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of GaN and AlN.

5|$|Chaucer's Criseyde is {{swayed by}} Diomedes playing on her fear. Pandarus is now her uncle, more worldly-wise and {{more active in}} what happens and so Troilus is more passive.

Troilus' repeated emotional paralysis is <b>comparable</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of Hamlet {{who may have been}} based on him.

5|$|Chemistry {{experiments}} {{have confirmed that}} lawrencium behaves as a heavier homolog to lutetium in the periodic table, and is a trivalent element. It thus could also be classified as {{the first of the}} 7th-period transition metals: however, its electron configuration is anomalous for its position in the periodic table, having an s2p configuration instead of the s2d configuration of its homolog lutetium. This means that lawrencium may be more volatile than expected for its position in the periodic table and have a volatility <b>comparable</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of lead.|$|E
5|$|Conversely, {{there are}} no records of a {{large-scale}} Greek slave revolt <b>comparable</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of Spartacus in Rome.

Individual acts of rebellion of slaves against their master, though scarce, are not unheard of; a judicial speech mentions the attempted murder of his master by a boy slave, not 12 years old.|$|E
5|$|Culverhouse was {{initially}} lauded for bringing professional football to the Tampa Bay area, but eventually {{came to be}} blamed for the team's struggles.

It further led to the belief that Culverhouse was unconcerned with fielding a winning team, {{as long as it was}} financially profitable.
