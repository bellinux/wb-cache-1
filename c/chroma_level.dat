40|$|With the {{development}} of wide-gamut display technology, the need is clear for understanding the required {{size and shape of}} color gamut from the viewers' perspective. To that end, experiments were conducted to explore color-gamut requirements based on viewers' preferred level of chroma enhancement of standard-gamut images. Chroma preferences were measured for multiple hues using single-hue images, and a corresponding hue-dependent preferred chroma enhancement was successfully applied to natural, multi-hue images. The multi-hue images showed overall success, though viewers indicated that reds could be decreased even further in colorfulness, and yellows could be increased, which may argue in favor of multi-primary displays. Viewer preferences do vary within the population, primarily in overall <b>chroma</b> <b>level,</b> and the differences can be largely accounted for with a single parameter for chroma-level adjustment that includes the preferred hue dependence. Image content dependencies were also found, but they remain too complex to model. The huedependent chroma preference results can be applied to display design and color-enhancement algorithms. © Copyright 2010 Society for Information Display...|$|E

[EN]: The {{developing}} conspicuous ornaments {{has been}} hypothesized {{to be related}} to higher individual genetic quality. However, the relationship among multicomponent sexual signals and individual heterozygosity is poorly understood. In this study, we examined whether ornaments indicators of male quality as song (repertoire size and length of bout) and plumage coloration (yellow breast and blue crown) reflect individual genetic variability in blue tit (Cyanistes caeruleus) male. To do this, we employ 26 microsatellite markers that were classified as functional (12 loci) and as neutral (14 loci) to test differences between subset. We found males with higher carotenoid <b>chroma</b> <b>level</b> on the breast, brighter blue crown and longer singing were more heterozygous at functional loci. No other study on this species has reported an association between genetic diversity and song or breast coloration in males. These traits reveal information about genetic quality individual of males and could be important on sexual selection. We found no effect of heterozygosity at specific loci, thereby positive correlations are better explained by multilocus heterozygosity. Our results indicate functional markers are valid to report HFC and should not be discarded in research about individual genetic diversity. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|A visual {{experiment}} {{was performed to}} generate suprathreshold tolerances sampling the direction of CIELAB hue, thereby extending the RIT-Dupont dataset. Thirty nine color centers including three complete hue circles at different lightness or <b>chroma</b> <b>levels</b> and three CIE recommended colors (red, green, blue) were evaluated for hue discrimination. Forty five observers participated in the pass/fail experiments. A total of 32, 226 visual observations were made. The statistical method, logit analysis with 3 -dimensional normit function, {{was used to determine}} the hue discrimination suprathreshold for each color center. The results indicated that the hue discrimination suprathresholds of observers varied with hue angle. The suprathreshold also increased with the chroma position of a given color center. The results were compared with current color-difference formulae, CMC, BFD and CIE 94. A mathematical equation was derived from the present dataset...|$|R
40|$|In the {{previous}} paper (Part 1), {{the effect of}} hue on impulsivity and arousal were studied. From those results, yellow, red and orange were selected for further investigation since participants’ performance was consistent with a low arousal state (high error rate and long response time) on the yellow background and high arousal state (low error rate and short response time) on the red background whereas orange was the color that tended to result in high impulsivity. This paper will mainly investigate the fundamental theory of how chroma influences people’s impulsivity and arousal states. The same as in {{the previous}} paper, the two main factors used to measure impulsivity and arousal in this paper are also response time and error rate for each colored background. In the psychophysical experiment, participants were looking at backgrounds in three hues (red, yellow and orange) with different <b>chroma</b> <b>levels</b> on screen to complete a range of psychometric tests. During the experiment, participants gave their response to the psychometric test as quickly and accurately as possible. From the results {{it can be seen that}} chroma has a significant influence on participants’ response time and error rate, and influences impulsivity and arousal. Gender difference will also been discussed in this paper...|$|R

5000|$|The two FM audio {{channels}} {{occupied the}} disc spectrum at 2.3 and 2.8 MHz on NTSC formatted discs and each channel had a 100 kHz FM deviation. The FM audio carrier frequencies {{were chosen to}} minimize their visibility in the video image, so that even with a poorly mastered disc, audio carrier beats in the video {{will be at least}} ‑35 dB down, and thus, invisible. Due to the frequencies chosen, the 2.8 MHz audio carrier (Right Channel) and the lower edge of the chroma signal are very close together and if filters are not carefully set during mastering, there can be interference between the two. In addition, high audio levels combined with high <b>chroma</b> <b>levels</b> can cause mutual interference, leading to beats becoming visible in highly saturated areas of the image. To help deal with this, Pioneer decided to implement the CX Noise Reduction System on the analog tracks. By reducing the dynamic range and peak levels of the audio signals stored on the disc, filtering requirements were relaxed and visible beats greatly reduced or eliminated. The CX system gives a total NR effect of 20 dB, but in the interest of better compatibility for non-decoded playback, Pioneer reduced this to only 14 dB of noise reduction (the RCA CED system used the [...] "original" [...] 20 dB CX system). This also relaxed calibration tolerances in players and helped reduce audible pumping if the CX decoder was not calibrated correctly.|$|R

40|$|Colour has the {{potential}} to influence people’s emotions and behaviour. However, there is little empirical research exploring in depth how colour influences performance. This study focuses on exploring the impact of colour on two particular responses: impulsivity and arousal. Response time and error rate were used as two indicators to define the levels of impulsivity and arousal. The impact of colour on impulsivity, arousal, and emotions were investigated in detail. To achieve this goal, three psychophysical experiments were conducted to explore the impact of hue and chroma on impulsivity and arousal; and how colour influences impulsivity, arousal and colour emotions such as colour heat. The hue and chroma experiments were designed to determine whether, in a particular colour environment, response time and error rate of the participants were different across different hues and <b>chroma</b> <b>levels.</b> Participants were required to complete a range of screen-based psychometric tests with different colour backgrounds. During the experiment, participants were asked to give their responses to each test as quickly and accurately as possible. The results showed that background hue and chroma differences significantly influence response time and error rate. This suggests that colour has a distinctive influence on impulsivity and arousal. Hue has a greater influence on arousal than impulsivity while chroma affect impulsivity more than arousal. The impact of colour on impulsivity and arousal were also considered with different psychometric test types, different genders and colour preference. To explore the impact of colour on impulsivity, arousal and emotions, the emotion experiment was designed to study ten emotion scales. Participants were asked to report their emotional responses to 20 colours both on cardboard and textile fabric based on ten emotion scales. The reliability of Ou’s (2004) colour emotion models for single colour have been verified using the experimental data in this study. This result suggested that colour influence on impulsivity and arousal can be linked with other emotions. The finding from this study can be applied in various affective design, such as product packaging, consumer purchasing, education efficiency and so forth...|$|R
40|$|The soil color {{components}} of 127 samples from five Arizona Agricultural Research Centers and 52 WEPP samples occurring {{in various parts}} of the U. S. A. were evaluated using a Minolta Chroma Meter. This instrument is designed to minimize the variability in color determination utilizing a built-in light source to generate a primary source of radiation. Simple and multiple linear regression equations relating Hue, Value, and Chroma color components were obtained to predict the organic carbon and iron content of these soils. The results show that using global data is less reliable than specific groupings of soils. Moist value and moist chroma moist are the two most important color components in estimating the organic carbon content of soils. Chroma and Hue were highly correlated to iron at all moisture <b>levels.</b> <b>Chroma</b> was least affected by soil moisture, but Value and Hue consistently decreased for all soils...|$|R
5000|$|Chroma is the [...] "colorfulness {{of an area}} {{judged as}} a {{proportion}} of the brightness of a similarly illuminated area that appears white or highly transmitting". [...] A note accompanying this definition in effect implies that an object with a given spectral reflectance exhibits approximately constant <b>chroma</b> for all <b>levels</b> of illumination, unless the brightness is very high. Thus if a uniformly colored object is unevenly lit, it will generally exhibit greater colorfulness where it is most strongly lit, but will be perceived to have the same chroma over its entire surface. While colorfulness is an attribute of the color of the light reflected from different parts of the object, chroma is an attribute of the color seen as belonging to the object itself (called an object color),and describes how different from a grey of the same lightness such an object color appears to be.|$|R
50|$|The filter {{operates}} {{on the edges}} of each 4×4 or 8×8 transform block in the luma and chroma planes of each picture. Each small block's edge is assigned a boundary strength based on whether it is also a macroblock boundary, the coding (intra/inter) of the blocks, whether references (in motion prediction and reference frame choice) differ, and whether it is a luma or <b>chroma</b> edge. Stronger <b>levels</b> of filtering are assigned by this scheme where there is likely to be more distortion. The filter can modify as many as three samples on either side of a given block edge (in the case where an edge is a luma edge that lies between different macroblocks and {{at least one of them}} is intra coded). In most cases it can modify one or two samples on either side of the edge (depending on the quantization step size, the tuning of the filter strength by the encoder, the result of an edge detection test, and other factors).|$|R
