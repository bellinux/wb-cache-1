40|$|The {{evolution}} of population color categorization systems formed on the Farnsworth-Munsell 100 Hue Test continuum is investigated in populations of artificial agents using realistic constraints from human populations: namely, (i) varying amounts of normal observer heterogeneity, and (ii) varying degrees {{and forms of}} observer color deficiency. These constraints are made operational in agent categorization and communication games. They produce a number of interesting consequences for stable, shared categorization solutions that are evolved in agent populations. It is found that the confusion patterns associated with {{a small fraction of}} color deficient agents break symmetries in population categorization solutions, and confine the boundaries of color categories to a small subset of available locations. Further, confusion pattern variations across different types of deficient agents lead to changes in category size and number that depend on the form of deficiency represented. In particular, stimulus pairs forming global confusion axes for dichromats tend to attract color boundaries, and local <b>confusion</b> <b>regions</b> characteristic of both dichromats and anomalous trichromats tend to repel color boundaries. Furthermore, the concurrent presence of normal agents and several different kinds of deficient agents produces novel constrained solutions that optimize successful categorization performance in population communication games involving color. c ○ 2008 Optical Society of Americ...|$|R

However, without a clear definition of the port <b>region,</b> <b>confusion</b> remains between a group of neighboring ports (e. g. façade, range) or an inland service area of a given port (e. g. hinterland). Considering the socio-economic characteristics of regional units around ports is proposed as a possible solution for international comparison.

40|$|Isolines {{have proved}} to be a highly {{effective}} way of conveying the shape of a surface (most commonly in the form of height contours to convey geographical landscape). Selecting the right contour interval is a compromise between showing sufficient detail in flat regions, whilst avoiding excessive crowding of lines in steep and morphologically complex areas. The traditional way of avoiding coalescence and <b>confusion</b> across steep <b>regions</b> has been to manually remove short sections of intermediate contours, while retaining index contours. Incorporating humans in automated environments is not viable. This research reports on the design, implementation and evaluation of an automated solution to this problem involving the automatic identification of coalescing lines, and removal of line segments to ensure clarity in the interpretation of contour information. Evaluation was made by subjective comparison with Ordnance Survey products. The results were found to be very close to the quality associated with manual techniques...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} fast but {{effective}} user-guided colorization algorithm. The main difficulty with colorization is its intensive computational cost. And the color sometimes diffuses from one region to others. We make {{full use of}} the information given by the gray-scale images, including the edge, gradient and gradient direction, to propagate color over regions from the user’s scribbles. We introduce a novel local distance definition which reduces the color <b>confusion</b> between two <b>regions</b> obviously. Two-Dimensional Programming is used to get the minimum distance from the scribbles to every pixel, and every pixel is blended by the chrominance with top three minimum distances. This speeds up the colorization process. Our algorithm can also be extended to recolorization and movie colorization. Experimental results show that our algorithm outperforms many state-ofthe- art algorithms from small amount of user scribbles. Besides, the implementation require less than 1 second on the image with 320 * 240 pixels...|$|R

The word 'city' {{has a certain}} meaning for investors. ... The requirement for a town {{to be called a}} city is that it be a seat of government or a cathedral town. Sligo is sometimes called a town and sometimes a city. This leads to <b>confusion</b> and the <b>region</b> falls between both stools. An official declaration of Sligo as a millennium city would have major significance for the entire area. The word city has a certain meaning for investors. It presumes a certain level of services and a status towards which the world reacts very favourably. The Fitzpatrick report established Sligo as a future growth centre. Even officials of Sligo Corporation are confused because in certain instances Sligo is called a town and in others a city.|$|R

This study reviews the worldwide {{variation of the}} incidence, investigations, management and outcome of patients with XGC. MethodsData from 29 studies, cumulatively containing 1599 patients, were reviewed and results summarized by geographical region (Europe, India, Far East and Americas) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) to present variability within regions. The main study outcomes were incidence, association with GB Ca and treatment of patients with XGC. ResultsOverall, the incidence of XGC was 1. 3 – 1. 9 %, {{with the exception of}} India where it was 8. 8 %. The incidence of GB Ca associated with XGC was lowest in European studies (3. 3 %) varying from 5. 1 – 5. 9 % in the remaining <b>regions.</b> <b>Confusion</b> with or undiagnosed GB Ca led to 10. 2 % of patients receiving over or under treatment. ConclusionsXGC is a global disease and is associated with GB Ca. Characteristic pathological, radiological and clinical features are shared with GB Ca and contribute to considerable treatment inaccuracy. Tissue sampling by pre-operative endoscopic ultrasound or intra-operative frozen section is required to accurately diagnose gallbladder pathology and should be performed before any extensive resection is performed...|$|R

We have used the heterodyne array receiver HARP on JCMT to make deep 12 CO 3 - 2 maps of submm cores in Perseus, extending and deepening our earlier study with RxB and bringing {{the total number of}} SCUBA cores studied up to 83. Our survey includes 23 / 25 of the Dunham et al. (2008) Spitzer low-luminosity objects believed to be embedded protostars, including three VeLLOs. All but one of the cores identified as harbouring embedded YSOs have outflows, confirming outflow detections as a good method for identifying protostars. We detect outflows from 20 Spitzer low-luminosity objects. We do not conclusively detect any outflows from IR-quiet cores, though <b>confusion</b> in clustered <b>regions</b> such as NGC 1333 makes it impossible to identify all the individual driving sources. This similarity in detection rates despite the difference in search methods and detection limits suggests either that the sample of protostars in Perseus is now complete, or that the existence of an outflow contributes to the Spitzer detectability, perhaps through the contribution of shocked H 2 emission in the IRAC bands. For five of the low-luminosity sources, there is no protostellar envelope detected at 350 microns and the Spitzer emission is entirely due to shocks.
