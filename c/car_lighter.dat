50|$|The long-stroke, 12-valve CVCC-II for Japan and 8-valve for Europe and Asia ER {{four-cylinder engine}} was only {{used in the}} AA/VF/FA series City/Jazz (1981-86).

The Japanese market CVCC engine was also known as COMBAX, an acronym of COMpact Blazing-combustion AXiom. The E-series were tuned for economy, with higher gearing and later on with computer-controlled variable lean burn.

5000|$|On the way home, Megan {{stops in}} her car to smoke a cigarette. When her <b>car</b> <b>lighter</b> will not work, a {{stranger}} (A.J. Bowen) suddenly appears out of nowhere, startling her, and lights her cigarette for her. When Megan reveals {{that she is not}} the babysitter hired by the Ulmans, she is abruptly shot and murdered by the stranger. After ordering a pizza, Samantha dances around the house while listening to her Walkman, accidentally breaking a vase in the process. While cleaning up the mess, she discovers a cupboard filled with old family photographs. In one photograph a different family than the Ulmans stands next to the Volvo she and Megan saw upon pulling up to the house. An additional peculiar detail is that the family in the photograph has a young son. This seems unlikely as the Volvo is a new car and Mr. Ulman stated that although they had a child he was now grown.|$|E
5000|$|The 356 {{was created}} by Ferdinand [...] "Ferry" [...] Porsche (son of Ferdinand Porsche, founder of the German company), who founded the Austrian company with his sister, Louise. Like its cousin, the Volkswagen Beetle (which Ferdinand Porsche Sr. had designed), the 356 is a four-cylinder, air-cooled, rear-engine, rear-wheel drive car with {{unitized}} pan and body construction. The chassis was a completely new design as was the 356's body which was designed by Porsche employee Erwin Komenda, while certain mechanical components including the engine case and some suspension components were based on and initially sourced from Volkswagen. Ferry Porsche described the thinking behind {{the development of the}} 356 {{in an interview with the}} editor of Panorama, the PCA magazine, in September 1972. [...] "….I had always driven very speedy cars. I had an Alfa Romeo, also a BMW and others. ….By the end of the war I had a Volkswagen Cabriolet with a supercharged engine and that was the basic idea. I saw that if you had enough power in a small car it is nicer to drive than if you have a big car which is also overpowered. And it is more fun. On this basic idea we started the first Porsche prototype. To make the <b>car</b> <b>lighter,</b> to have an engine with more horsepower…that was the first two seater that we built in Carinthia (Gmünd)". [...] The first 356 was road certified in Austria on June 8, 1948, and was entered in a race in Innsbruck where it won its class. Porsche re-engineered and refined the car with a focus on performance. Fewer and fewer parts were shared between Volkswagen and Porsche as the 1950s progressed. The early 356 automobile bodies produced at Gmünd were handcrafted in aluminum, but when production moved to Zuffenhausen, Germany in 1950, models produced there were steel-bodied. The aluminium bodied cars from that very small company are what are now referred to as [...] "prototypes". Porsche contracted Reutter to build the steel bodies and eventually bought the Reutter company in 1963. The Reutter company retained the seat manufacturing part of the business and changed its name to [...] "Recaro".|$|E

40|$|PCR-based {{methods are}} the most common {{technique}} for sex determination of birds. Although these methods are fast, easy and accurate, they still require special facilities that preclude their application outdoors. Consequently, there is a time lag between sampling and obtaining results that impedes researchers to take decisions in situ and in real time considering individuals’ sex. We present an outdoor technique for sex determination of birds based on the amplification of the duplicated sex-chromosome-specific gene Chromo-Helicase-DNA binding protein using a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). We tested our method on Griffon Vulture (Gyps fulvus), Egyptian Vulture (Neophron percnopterus) and Black Kite (Milvus migrans) (family Accipitridae). We introduce the first fieldwork procedure for sex determination of animals in the wild, successfully applied to raptor species of three different subfamilies using the same specific LAMP primers. This molecular technique can be deployed directly in sampling areas because it only needs a voltage inverter to adapt a thermo-block to a <b>car</b> <b>lighter</b> and results can be obtained by the unaided eye based on colour change within the reaction tubes. Primers and reagents are prepared in advance to facilitate their storage at room temperature. We provide detailed guidelines how to implement this procedure, which is simpler (no electrophoresis required), cheaper and faster (results in c. 90  min) than PCR-based laboratory methods. Our successful cross-species application across three different raptor subfamilies posits our set of markers as a promising tool for molecular sexing of other raptor families and our field protocol extensible to all bird species.

40|$|Citation: Grabendike, Frank W. The {{consolidated}} {{system of}} electric <b>car</b> <b>lighting.</b> Senior thesis, Kansas State Agricultural College, 1907. Introduction: Electric <b>Car</b> <b>Lighting</b> has today passed beyond the experimental stage and has established for itself, {{an important and}} recognized place {{in the realm of}} electrical engineering. The subject of <b>car</b> <b>lighting</b> is one with which every energetic railway manager has to deal and the electrical <b>lighting</b> of railway <b>cars</b> is demanding the attention of most of the railroads throughout the world. The success of an invention depends upon two things, first upon its capacity for accomplishing the results for which it was designed; and secondly,the demand created for the invention, when it is placed upon the market or put into general service. Electric <b>car</b> <b>lighting</b> fulfills both of these conditions and its success today is proven without a doubt. Electricity is universally admitted to be the best means of supplying light providing it can be produced and regulated successfully. Many systems of regulation and control have been devised and are now in operation on the trains of various railway companies. The success of electric lighted trains may also be attributed to the fact, that the travelling public demand the best service from our railroad companies. The public is no longer content to ride in cars where the furniture is covered with grease and dirt from old oil lamps, nor does any one enjoy inhaling the obnoxious gases, so common to <b>cars</b> <b>lighted</b> with gas, when competitors are offering for the same rate, elegantly furnished cars, free from dirt, grease or odor, and brilliantly and evenly lighted with the modern incadescent lamp. The electric <b>lighting</b> of <b>cars</b> is accomplished by means of many different systems. Each system must have a source of power, a means of regulating and controlling this power and lastly an efficient means of distribution. In the last few years, marked improvements have been made in various systems of <b>car</b> <b>lighting</b> over some of the earlier types...|$|R
