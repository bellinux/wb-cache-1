40|$|Abstract Background Platelet-mediated <b>clumping</b> of Plasmodium falciparum -infected {{erythrocytes}} (IE) is {{a parasite}} adhesion phenotype {{that has been}} associated with severe malaria in some, but not all, field isolate studies. A variety of experimental conditions have been used to study <b>clumping</b> in vitro, with substantial differences in parasitaemia (Pt), haematocrit (Ht), and time of reaction between studies. It is unknown whether these experimental variables affect the outcome of parasite <b>clumping</b> assays. Methods The effects of Pt (1, 4 and 12 %), Ht (2, 5 and 10 %) and time (15 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h) on the <b>clumping</b> of P. falciparum clone HB 3 were examined. The effects of platelet freshness and parasite maturity were also studied. Results At low Ht (2 %), the Pt of the culture has a large effect on <b>clumping,</b> with significantly higher <b>clumping</b> occurring at 12 % Pt (mean 47 % of IE in <b>clumps)</b> compared to 4 % Pt (mean 26 % IE in <b>clumps)</b> or 1 % Pt (mean 7 % IE in <b>clumps)</b> (ANOVA, p = 0. 0004). Similarly, at low Pt (1 %), the Ht of the culture has a large effect on <b>clumping,</b> with significantly higher <b>clumping</b> occurring at 10 % Ht (mean 62 % IE in <b>clumps)</b> compared to 5 % Ht (mean 25 % IE in <b>clumps)</b> or 2 % Ht (mean 10 % IE in <b>clumps)</b> (ANOVA, p = 0. 0004). Combinations of high Ht and high Pt were impractical because of the difficulty assessing <b>clumping</b> in densely packed IE and the rapid formation of enormous <b>clumps</b> that could not be counted accurately. There {{was no significant difference in}} <b>clumping</b> when fresh platelets were used compared to platelets stored at 4 °C for 10 days. <b>Clumping</b> was a property of mature pigmented-trophozoites and schizonts but not ring stage parasites. Conclusion The Pt and Ht at which in vitro <b>clumping</b> assays are set up have a profound effect on the outcome. All previous field isolate studies on <b>clumping</b> and malaria severity suffer from potential problems in experimental design and methodology. Future studies of <b>clumping</b> should use standardized conditions and control for Pt, and should take into account the limitations and variability inherent in the assay. </p...|$|R

Antisera prepared against encapsulated (coagulase-positive, <b>clumping</b> factor-negative) variants, as well as against nonencapsulated wild-type (coagulase-positive, <b>clumping</b> factor-positive) S. aureus strains, contained high titers of clumping-inhibiting antibody. When coagulase-negative, <b>clumping</b> factor-negative mutants were the immunizing agents, antisera contained no demonstrable clumping-inhibiting antibody. Phenol extracts of all coagulase-positive strains tested precipitated fibrinogen, regardless of the ability of cells to <b>clump</b> in the presence of fibrinogen. Polysaccharide extracts of encapsulated, <b>clumping</b> factor-negative strains inhibited this fibrinogen-precipitating activity, whereas similar extracts of nonencapsulated staphylococci did not inhibit the fibrinogen reaction. From these results, it appeared that the coagulase-positive, encapsulated staphylococci which do not <b>clump</b> in fibrinogen solution possess <b>clumping</b> factor, but that their capsular polysaccharide inhibits <b>clumping</b> activity. These findings suggested a closer association of <b>clumping</b> factor and coagulase than is now recognized...|$|R
40|$|We analyse stellar {{masses of}} <b>clumps</b> {{drawn from a}} {{compilation}} of star-forming galaxies at 1. 1 <z< 3. 6. Comparing <b>clumps</b> selected in different ways, and in lensed or blank field galaxies, we {{examine the effects of}} spatial resolution and sensitivity on the inferred stellar masses. Large differences are found, with median stellar masses ranging from ~ 10 ^ 9 Msun for <b>clumps</b> in the often-referenced field galaxies to ~ 10 ^ 7 Msun for fainter <b>clumps</b> selected in deep-field or lensed galaxies. We argue that the <b>clump</b> masses, observed in non-lensed galaxies with a limited spatial resolution of ~ 1 kpc, are artificially increased due to the clustering of <b>clumps</b> of smaller mass. Furthermore, we show that the sensitivity threshold used for the <b>clump</b> selection affects the inferred masses even more strongly than resolution, biasing <b>clumps</b> at the low mass end. Both improved spatial resolution and sensitivity appear to shift the <b>clump</b> stellar mass distribution to lower masses, qualitatively in agreement with <b>clump</b> masses found in recent high-resolution simulations of disk fragmentation. We discuss the nature of the most massive <b>clumps,</b> and we conclude that it is currently not possible to properly establish a meaningful <b>clump</b> stellar mass distribution from observations and to infer the existence and value of a characteristic <b>clump</b> mass scale.

40|$|Abridged) The {{properties}} of stellar <b>clumps</b> in star forming galaxies and their evolution over the redshift range 2 ≲ z ≲ 6 are presented and {{discussed in the}} context of the build-up of massive galaxies at early cosmic times. We use HST/ACS images of galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts from the VIMOS Ultra Deep Survey (VUDS) to identify <b>clumps</b> within a 20 kpc radius. We find that the population of galaxies with more than one <b>clump</b> is dominated by galaxies with two <b>clumps,</b> representing ∼ 21 - 25 % of the population, while the fraction of galaxies with 3, or 4 and more, <b>clumps</b> is 8 - 11 and 7 - 9 %, respectively. The fraction of clumpy galaxies is in the range ∼ 35 - 55 % over 2 <z< 6, increasing at higher redshifts, indicating that the fraction of irregular galaxies remains high up to the highest redshifts. The large and bright <b>clumps</b> (M_∼ 10 ^ 9 up to ∼ 10 ^ 10 M_) are found to reside predominantly in galaxies with two <b>clumps.</b> Smaller and lower luminosity <b>clumps</b> (_ 10 (M_/M_) < 9) are found in galaxies with three <b>clumps</b> or more. We interpret these results as evidence for two different modes of <b>clump</b> formation working in parallel. The small low luminosity <b>clumps</b> are likely the result of disc fragmentation, with violent disc instabilities (VDI) forming several long-lived <b>clumps</b> in-situ, as suggested from simulations. A fraction of these <b>clumps</b> is also likely coming from minor mergers. The <b>clumps</b> in the dominating population of galaxies with two <b>clumps</b> are significantly more massive and have properties akin to those in merging pairs observed at similar redshifts; they appear as more massive than the most massive <b>clumps</b> observed in VDI numerical simulations.

In the DYNAMO- HST sample we measure <b>clump</b> diameters spanning the range d_clump∼ 100 - 800 pc, and individual <b>clump</b> star formation rates as high as ∼ 5 M_ yr^- 1. DYNAMO <b>clumps</b> have very high SFR surface densities, Σ_SFR∼ 15 M_ yr^- 1 kpc^- 2, ∼ 100 × higher than in H ii regions of nearby spirals. Indeed, SFR surface density provides a simple dividing line between massive star forming <b>clumps</b> and local star forming regions, where massive star forming <b>clumps</b> have Σ_SFR> 0. 5 M_ yr^- 1 kpc^- 2. When degraded to match the observations of galaxies in z∼ 1 - 3 surveys, DYNAMO galaxies are similar in morphology and measured <b>clump</b> properties to clumpy galaxies observed in the high-z Universe. Emission peaks in the simulated high-redshift maps typically correspond to multiple <b>clumps</b> in full resolution images. This clustering of <b>clumps</b> systematically increases the apparent size and SFR of <b>clumps</b> in 1 kpc resolution maps, and decreases the measured SFR surface density of <b>clumps</b> by as much as a factor of 20 ×. From these results we can infer that <b>clump</b> clustering is likely to strongly effect the measured properties of <b>clumps</b> in high-z galaxies, which commonly have kiloparsec scale resolution.

40|$|Platelet-mediated <b>clumping</b> of Plasmodium falciparum -infected {{erythrocytes}} (IEs) is {{a common}} property of field isolates associated with severe disease (Pain, Ferguson et al. 2001). Platelet receptors CD 36 (Pain, Ferguson et al. 2001), P-Selectin (Wassmer, Taylor et al. 2008) and gC 1 qR (Biswas, Hafiz et al. 2007) mediate <b>clumping.</b> To characterize the molecular specificities of the <b>clumping</b> phenotype, I cloned <b>clumping</b> parasite line IT/C 10 by limiting dilution. I characterized var gene expression in the IT/C 10 clones using generic primers for the DBL tag region (Bull, Berriman et al. 2005). <b>Clumping</b> assays were conducted {{in the presence of}} specific reagents to delineate host factors hypothesized to contribute to development of the <b>clumping</b> phenotype.

The evolution of an individual <b>clump</b> is found to be sensitive to its initial colunm density, the temperature of the heated surface and the ratio of the "turn-on time" t_FUV of the heating flux on a <b>clump</b> to its initial sound crossing-time t_c. In this paper, we use spherical 1 -D numerical hydrodynamic models as well as approximate analytical models to study the evolution of turbulence-generated and pressure-confined <b>clumps</b> in PDRs. Turbulent <b>clumps</b> evolve so that their column densities are equal to a critical value determined by the local FUV field, and typically have short photoevaporation timescales, ∼ 10 ^ 4 - 5 years for a 1 M_ <b>clump</b> in a typical star-forming region. <b>Clumps</b> that are confined by an interclump medium may either get completely photoevaporated, or may preserve a shielded core with a warm, dissociated, protective shell that absorbs the incident FUV flux.

The evolution also depends on whether a confining interclump medium exists, or whether the interclump region has negligible pressure, as is the case for turbulence-generated <b>clumps.</b> In this paper, we use spherical 1 -D numerical hydrodynamic models as well as approximate analytical models to study the dependence of <b>clump</b> photoevaporation on the physical parameters of the <b>clump,</b> and to derive the dynamical evolution, mass loss rates and photoevaporative timescales of a <b>clump</b> for a variety of astrophysical situations. Turbulent <b>clumps</b> evolve so that their column densities are equal to a critical value determined by the local FUV field, and typically have short photo evaporation timescales, approx. 10 (exp 4 - 5) years for a 1 M(solar mass) <b>clump</b> in a typical star-forming region (Nc 0 = 10, upsilon = 10). <b>Clumps</b> with insufficient magnetic pressure support, and in strong FUV fields may be driven to collapse by the compressional effect of converging shock waves. We also estimate the rocket effect on photoevaporating <b>clumps</b> and find that it is significant only for the smallest <b>clumps,</b> with sizes much less than the extent of the PDR itself. <b>Clumps</b> that are confined by all interclump medium may either get completely photoevaporated, or may preserve a shielded core with a warm, dissociated, protective shell that, absorbs the incident FUV flux. We compare our results with observations of some well studied PDRs: the Orion Bar, M 17 SW NGC 2023 and the Rosette Nebula. The data are consistent with both interpretations of <b>clump</b> origin. turbulence and pressure confinement, with a slight indication for favouring the turbulent model for <b>clumps</b> over pressure-confine...|$|R
