40|$|Semi-volatile organic {{compounds}} (SVOCs) are indoor air pollutants {{that may have}} significant adverse effects on human health. Although emissions of volatile chemicals from building materials and consumer products are usually characterized in small chambers, few chamber studies have been <b>conducted</b> <b>for</b> SVOCs <b>due</b> to the challenges associated with analysis {{and the lack of}} validation procedures. There is an urgent need for a reliable and accurate chamber test method to verify these measurements. A reference method employing a specially-designed chamber has been developed and is undergoing extensive evaluation. A pilot inter-laboratory study (ILS) has been conducted with six laboratories performing chamber tests under identical conditions for di- 2 -ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP). Results from this study showed inter-laboratory variations of 24 % for DEHP emission rates, with closer agreement observed among intra-laboratory measurements for most of the participating laboratories. A mechanistic emission model fits well to the measured concentration profiles, demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed reference method to independently assess laboratory performance and validate SVOC emission tests.

40|$|The radial {{spreading}} of {{density currents}} {{arising from the}} impingement of submerged round turbulent dense jets on a horizontal bottom is investigated. Experiments were <b>conducted</b> <b>for</b> spreading <b>due</b> to (i) the return {{on the bottom of}} negatively buoyant jets discharged upwards at four different angles, namely 45 degrees, 60 degrees, 75 degrees and 85 degrees to the horizontal and (ii) the impingement of positively buoyant jets discharged horizontally or vertically downwards to the bottom from a submerged nozzle. The jet fluid was colored saltwater solution issuing at a constant rate in a calm freshwater ambient and the spreading was recorded by means of a video camera. For the inclined negatively buoyant jets and the vertical positively buoyant ones the outer visual boundary of the density current is found to be almost circular. The radial distance from the impingement point to the outer boundary is estimated and found to correlate with time to a power of about 1 / 2, indicating a balance between buoyancy and drag forces. The radial distance is normalized by time and by the initial or local jet flow parameters and its variation with the discharge angle and the densimetric Froude number is presented.

40|$|Mergers and {{acquisitions}} (M&A) {{have become an}} important strategy for international expansion, even though numerous acquisitions fail to achieve their financial and strategic objectives. The risk associated with transactions partly depends {{on the extent to}} which the insight into the target company actually holds true. Due diligence is performed to eliminate this information asymmetry. Due diligence is an audit conducted prior to the planned transaction. It can be described as a purposeful and systematic investigation of business opportunity and risk during on-going sale negotiations. The <b>importance</b> of <b>due</b> diligence is emphasized widely in the academic literature as well as among M&A practitioners. On the other hand, researches and practitioners have differing views on what and how much is enough <b>for</b> a <b>due</b> diligence audit. Therefore, this study examines the role of due diligence in a cross-border acquisition process. The main objective of the research is fulfilled by examining the reasons <b>for</b> <b>conducting</b> <b>due</b> diligence, recognizing the elements affecting effective due diligence and analyzing the need and opportunities for enhancing the utilization of <b>due</b> diligence. <b>For</b> the empirical part of this qualitative study five expert interviews were conducted among experienced Finnish acquirers and advisors. In addition, five expert interviews <b>conducted</b> <b>for</b> a distinct study were utilized as a secondary source of data. The results of this study present fundamental reasons <b>for</b> <b>conducting</b> <b>due</b> diligence. However, conducting due diligence is not always self-evident. Doubtful attitude towards due diligence exists, though it is exceptional. Carefully planning the focus of due diligence and compiling and managing the team conducting due diligence are identified as the main elements affecting effective due diligence. Altogether, due diligence can have plural roles which in this study are categorized as the confirmatory, preparative, and cross-functional roles of due diligence. The older academic literature tends to emphasize the confirmatory role whereas the current academic discussion also supports the preparative role of due diligence. It can be argued that the roles of due diligence differ among experienced due diligence practitioners based on several factors. In attempt to increase the value of <b>due</b> diligence <b>for</b> acquirers, more than one role of due diligence is likely to exist. As a result of the different approaches and the controversy regarding the concept of due diligence, the demand for a new, wider definition of due diligence can be claimed to exist...|$|R
40|$|Polyaniline (PANI) {{has become}} an {{important}} <b>conducting</b> polymer <b>for</b> sensing <b>due</b> to its morphological and electrical properties. However, the processing of polyaniline {{in the form of}} nanostructured thin films is often limited by the low solubility of the polymer in water. We synthesized nanostructured polyaniline (N-PANI) aimed at improving its solubility to form layer-by-layer (LbL) thin films in conjunction with poly(vinyl sulfonic acid) (PVS) as counter ion. N-PANI was characterized via spectroscopic measurements and SEM images. After assembled as LbL thin films onto gold (Au) substrates, the PVS/N-PANI were employed as separative extended gate pH sensing membrane in FET-based devices presenting pH sensitivity around 58 mV/pH with small voltage drift. The results suggest that N-PANI can be easily processed to form suitable thin films for pH sensing and can be combined with biomolecules to be applied in FET-based biosensors. CAPESCNPqFAPES...|$|R

30|$|Tin oxide (SnO 2) nanostructure, on {{the other}} hand, is a {{well-known}} transparent <b>conducting</b> oxide <b>for</b> nano-electronics <b>due</b> to high μn (10 – 125 cm 2 V− 1 s− 1) and wider band gap (~ 3.6  eV) [118, 119, 120, 121]. However, its conduction band minimum occurs at an energy {{lower than that of}} TiO 2 [72] and, therefore, DSSCs with SnO 2 electrode usually give low open circuit voltages (VOC ≤  600  mV) [122]. Recently, VOC up to ~ 600  mV has been achieved by preparing the SnO 2 core/shell electrodes and/or making composite electrode with other wide-band-gap semiconductors [123, 124, 125]. To increase the PCE of SnO 2 based DSSCs, several approaches have been considered which includes: (i) modifying the electrode surface [126], (ii) modifying electrolyte composition [126, 127], (iii) combining with other MOS nanoparticles [125], and (iv) by using a core–shell configuration of suitable energy band-matched MOS [125, 128, 129].|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: Renal {{impairment}} (RI) {{studies are}} conducted {{to estimate the}} impact of RI on pharmacokinetics (PK). In some disease areas, these studies {{can be difficult to}} <b>conduct,</b> <b>for</b> instance <b>due</b> to the limited number of eligible patients. The objective of this analysis was to evaluate bias and precision of population PK parameters, and the dose adjustment error (DAE) for RI studies i) with different levels of study design imbalance in the stratification of subjects across RI categories, and ii) that include additional patients in the control arm of RI studies, that may be available from previously conducted PK studies. METHODS: Study designs were simulated and re-estimated using a hypothetical 2 -compartmental PK model with varying magnitude of the fraction of renal elimination (FR) and magnitude of between-subject variability (BSV). The DAE was computed based on the difference between the theoretical necessary dose adjustment versus the empirical estimated dose adjustment to reach a similar exposure as controls. RESULTS: Although some design imbalance may still lead to DAEs of acceptable magnitude (DAE[*]<[*]- 11. 05 - 14. 44 inter-quartile range, IQR), at least some patients are necessary in the more severe RI groups. When 100 additional patients with normal renal function were included in a sub-informative design, the DAE changed from[*]<[*]- 7. 63 - 16. 64 IQR to[*]<[*]- 8. 89 - 8. 69 IQR. CONCLUSIONS: We quantified the impact of study design imbalance on bias and precision of PK parameters and DAE, as may occur for RI studies in some indications. Adding additional data from earlier studies to the analysis dataset improves the bias and precision of PK parameters...|$|R
