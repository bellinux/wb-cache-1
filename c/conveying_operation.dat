40|$|ZPL is a {{parallel}} array language designed for high performance scientific and engineering computations. Unlike other parallel languages, ZPL {{is founded on}} a machine model (the CTA) that accurately abstracts contemporary MIMD parallel computers. This {{makes it possible to}} correlate ZPL programs with machine behavior. As a result, programmers can reason about how code will perform on a typical parallel machine and thereby make informed decisions between alternative programming solutions. This paper describes ZPL's performance model and its syntactic cues for <b>conveying</b> <b>operation</b> cost. The what-you-seeis -what-you-get (WYSIWYG) nature of ZPL operations is demonstrated on the IBM SP- 2, Intel Paragon, SGI Power Challenge, and Cray T 3 E. Additionally, the model is used to evaluate two algorithms for matrix multiplication. Experiments show that the performance model correctly predicts the faster solution on all four platforms for a range of problem sizes. 1. Introduction High-level programming [...] ...|$|E

There are a range of tools available to study dust generation, with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) becoming more prevalent due to the rapid improvements in the technology in recent years. However, by itself it is not very well suited to study granular multiphase flows as there are inherent limitations when modelling the solid particle phase as a fluid. In this study, we have combined a continuum approach [1] as well as the discrete element method (DEM) to study granular flow through a simple transfer to gain flow and porosity information to then input into the CFD software to study the resulting air flows...|$|R

40|$|Dust {{control in}} belt <b>conveying</b> <b>operations</b> is {{becoming}} increasingly important due {{to a number of}} reasons, most notably the increasing emphasis on health and safety and also the conservation of the environment. The primary objective is to reduce dust emissions by passive means without the need for external energy as associated with dust extraction systems. Pilot scale tests followed by proven industrial applications have confirmed that very effective passive dust control is achievable by maintaining streamlined flow of the bulk solid through the conveyor transfer system. This experience provides the background to the present paper which focuses on the modelling of chute flow aimed at achieving optimum performance. The work presented in this paper involves an initial study of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to investigate the granular flow through a typical transfer chute with a view to reducing dust emissions. Experiments using a scale model test rig are described and the test results are compared with the computed results obtained by the CFD/continuum model. As a final discussion the integration of CFD with a well established continuum model (Roberts, 2003) is considered...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} checking whether the operations of an organization conform to a body of regulation. The immediate motivation comes from {{the analysis of the}} U. S. Food and Drug Administration regulations that ap-ply to bloodbanks- organizations that collect, process, store, and use donations of blood and blood components. Statements in such regulations <b>convey</b> constraints on <b>operations</b> or sequences of operations that are performed by an organization. It is natural to express these constraints in a temporal logic. There are two important features of regulatory texts that need to be accommo-dated by a representation in logic. First, the constraints conveyed by regulation can be obligatory (required) or permitted (optional). Second, statements in regu-lation refer to others for conditions or exceptions. An organization conforms to a body of regulation if and only if it satisfies all the obligations. However, permis-sions provide exceptions to obligations, indirectly affecting conformance. In this paper, we extend linear temporal logic to distinguish between obligations and permissions, and to allow statements to refer to others. While the resulting logic allows for a direct representation of regulation, evaluating references be-tween statements has high complexity. We discuss an empirically motivated as-sumption that lets us replace references with tests of lower complexity, leading to efficient trace-checking algorithms in practice. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceParticle {{segregation}} usually {{appears as}} the counterpart of any mixing operation involving particles of different physical properties. However, {{little attention has}} been paid in the literature to this problem and especially to quantifying the stability of powder mixtures to segregation during the <b>conveying</b> and handling <b>operations</b> following a mixing process. This paper gives a theoretical definition of the `robustness' of a powder mixture based on knowledge of the quality of a mixture before and after a segregation test. Specific attention is paid to the problem of homogeneity estimation through sampling. A simple static segregation device, specially developed for this study, is then used for evaluating the robustness of pharmaceutical powder mixtures. The effect of using an excipient, of the same chemical nature but different physical properties, is investigated {{from the point of view}} of size and shape of the particles. In the experiments performed here it is found that particle size has practically no influence on robustness, but it is demonstrated that particle shape has an important effect. Replacing irregular‐shaped particles in a powder mixture by spherical‐shaped particles (such as those produced by spray‐drying) can provoke a dramatic disruption of the structure of a mixture by a simple pouring. Finally, the static segregation device is used as a relative measurement of homogeneity of complex blends consisting of animal feed and aroma. The evaluation of the effect of a premix step leads to the conclusion that the process time devoted to premixing should be optimized with respect to the overall mixing...|$|R
40|$|Market {{interest}} rates on sovereign debt issued by the 12 Eurozone national governments differ very little from each other, despite the credit ratings of these governments ranging from triple A to single A, and despite significant differences among their objective indicators of fiscal-financial sustainability. We argue that this market failure is {{at least in part}} due to a policy failure: the operational practices of the European Central Bank {{and the rest of the}} Eurosystem in its collateralised open market <b>operations</b> <b>convey</b> the message that the Eurosystem views the debt of the 12 Eurozone sovereigns as equivalent. The euro-denominated debt instruments of all twelve Eurozone governments are deemed to be eligible for use as collateral in collateralised lending by the Eurosystem. They are in addition allocated to the same (highest) liquidity category (Tier One, Category 1) as the debt instruments of the Eurosystem itself and subject to the lowest 'valuation haircut' (discount on the market value). Haircuts also increase with the remaining time to maturity. This discourages the use as collateral of longer maturity debt which would be more likely to reveal differences in sovereign default risk. We propose that the size of the haircut on each debt instrument be related inversely to its credit rating. A further re-enforcement of the market’s ability to penalise and constrain unsustainable budgetary policies would be to declare the sovereign debt of nations that violate the conditions of the Stability and Growth Pact to be ineligible as collateral in Eurosystem Repos. collateralised loans; Eurosystem; sovereign default risk...|$|R

While considerable information is available on seed grains, {{little is known about}} the aerodynamic behavior of corn (Zea mays L.) silage. In this re-search, the weighed mean terminal velocity of a sample representative of the entire bulk mass was determined using Wolf and Tatepo’s method. The terminal velocity of various particle types (leaf, stalk and corncob pieces) of chopped forage corn plants, which were kept in silo for six months, at different moisture contents (40 - 50, 50 - 60 and 60 - 70 % w. b.) was also studied. The terminal velocity was determined by measuring the air velocity re-quired to suspend a particle in a vertical air stream using a wind tunnel. A 3 × 3 factorial treatment arrangement with 30 replications in a completely randomized design was used to study the effect of moisture content and particle type on the terminal velocity. The mass mean terminal velocities of the corn silage at 40 - 50, 50 - 60 and 60 - 70 % moisture con-tents were 7. 1, 7. 3 and 7. 8 m/s, respectively. The results showed that only the effect of par-ticle type on the terminal velocity of corn silage was significant. The mean values of the terminal velocity of corn leaf, stalk and cob pieces were 3. 8, 6. 8 and 8. 8 m/s, respectively. For each particle type at a given moisture content, the terminal velocity was best de-scribed by means of the equation of velocity squared in terms of weight...|$|R
40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) To access {{interactive}} systems, {{blind and}} visually impaired users can leverage their auditory senses by using non-speech sounds. The current structure of non-speech sounds, however, is geared toward <b>conveying</b> user interface <b>operations</b> (e. g., opening a file) rather than large theme-based information (e. g., a history passage) and, thus, is ill-suited to signify the complex meanings of primary learning material (e. g., books and websites). In order to address this problem, this dissertation introduces audemes, a new category of non-speech sounds, whose semiotic structure and flexibility open new horizons for facilitating the education of {{blind and visually}} impaired students. An experiment with 21 students from the Indiana School for the Blind and Visually Impaired (ISBVI) supports the hypothesis that audemes increase the retention of theme-based information. By acting as memory catalysts, audemes can {{play an important role in}} enhancing the aural interaction and navigation in future sound-based user interfaces. For this dissertation, I designed an Acoustic EDutainment INterface (AEDIN) that integrates audemes as a way by which to vividly anticipate text-to-speech theme-based information and, thus, act as innovative aural covers. The results of two iterative usability evaluations with total of 20 {{blind and visually impaired}} participants showed that AEDIN is a highly usable and enjoyable acoustic interface. Yet, designing well-formed audemes remains an ad hoc process because audeme creators can only rely on their intuition to generate meaningful and memorable sounds. In order to address this problem, this dissertation presents three experiments, each with 10 blind and visually impaired participants. The goal was to examine the optimal combination of audeme attributes, which can be used to facilitate accurate recognitions of audeme meanings. This work led to the creation of seven basic guidelines that can be used to design well-formed audemes. An interactive application tool (ASCOLTA: Advanced Support and Creation-Oriented Library Tool for Audemes) operationalized these guidelines to support individuals without an audio background in designing well-formed audemes. An informal evaluation conducted with three teachers from the ISBVI, supports the hypothesis that ASCOLTA is a useful tool by which to facilitate the integration of audemes into the teaching environment...|$|R

Years ago our {{assessment}} of corporate culture focused primarily on whether management actively discouraged their operators -- in aviation, that would be pilots -- from following the established company and government rules and procedures. Yet, considering how much we have learned about corporate culture, {{it is difficult to}} accept the fact that accidents occurred because some companies actually encouraged rule breaking. For example, on May 30, 1979, a DeHavilland Twin Otter, operated by Downeast Airlines, a regularly scheduled commuter flight from Boston, crashed near Rockland, Maine, while the pilot was attempting to land in restricted visual conditions. Both pilots and all but one of the 16 passengers were killed in the accident.The investigation found that the visibility was so poor that the pilot could not have been able to see the airport at the point, known as the decision height, at which he was required to abandon the approach if he could not see the airport. Why then did he attempt to land anyway, given the known hazards and prohibitions against such attempts? Well, further investigation found a corporate culture in place at that airline that not only did not enhance safety but actively discouraged it. The owner of the airline, who as president directed its day to day <b>operations,</b> <b>conveyed</b> to the captain and to all pilots his expectations that they would cut corners in the interest of saving money. In fact, he criticized and threatened them when they did not.In addition, we learned that the captain believed that he had no real authority to stand up to the company president and, moreover, feared for his job if he did not satisfy the president's wishes. Although this accident was certainly not the first one in which an abusive or threatening management style adversely affected flight safety, it was the first we could recall in which the Safety Board explicitly addressed the role of management in the cause of an accident. The lessons of this accident were unmistakable: a management climate that pressures pilots to ignore flight rules and safe operating practices, and threatens pilots if they do not conform to these practices, adversely affects the safety of the operation." ...|$|R
