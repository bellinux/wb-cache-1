5|$|In 1886, Johann Gottfried Spiesshofer and Michael Braun {{founded a}} factory for the {{production}} of corsets in Heubach (Baden-Wurttemberg). They first employed six people on the same number of sewing machines. That number rose to 150 people in 1890, and in 1894 their first exports were sent abroad, to England. It was only in 1902 that Spieshofer and Braun registered the Triumph brand, which was reminiscent of the Parisian Arc de Triomphe, to which International was later added. After the economic boom in the 1920s, demand for the classic corset declined, which is why the company began parallel production of brassieres. In the 1930s, Triumph International also began producing <b>corselets.</b>|$|E
2500|$|With the corset all but extinct by the mid-1930s, the companyâ€™s new {{leadership}} focused on developing new products. [...] In 1937, {{the company that}} revolutionized corsetry revolutionized the brassiere by assigning letters to various cup sizes. The ABC Alphabet Bra {{set the standard for}} bra sizing that is still used today. By the early 1940s, the company was profitable again, bringing in $1 million by 1947. Sales of bras, girdles, and the cross-promotion of the Merry Widow line of <b>corselets</b> with the 1952 Lana Turner movie of the same name, led to record profits.|$|E

"But the Persians {{were deeply}} vexed at the outcome and sent forth another {{horseman}} {{for the same}} purpose, a manly fellow and well favoured as to bodily size, but not a youth, {{for some of the}} hair on his head already shewed grey. This horseman came up along the hostile army, and, brandishing vehemently the whip with which he was accustomed to strike his horse, he summoned to battle whoever among the Romans was willing. And when no one went out against him, Andreas, without attracting the notice of anyone, once more came forth, although he had been forbidden to do so by Hermogenes. So both rushed madly upon each other with their spears, and the weapons, driven against their <b>corselets,</b> were turned aside with mighty force, and the horses, striking together their heads, fell themselves and threw off their riders. And both the two men, falling very close to each other, made great haste to rise to their feet, but the Persian was not able to do this easily because his size was against him, while Andreas, anticipating him (for his practice in the wrestling school gave him this advantage), smote him as he was rising on his knee, and as he fell again to the ground dispatched him. Then a roar went up from the wall and from the Roman army as great, if not greater, than before; and the Persians broke their phalanx and withdrew to Ammodios, while the Romans, raising the paean, went inside the fortifications; for already it was growing dark. Thus both armies passed that night." ...|$|E

50|$|The <b>corselet,</b> {{also known}} as a breastplate, is an oval or {{rectangular}} collar-piece resting on the shoulders, chest and back, to support the helmet and seal it to the suit, usually made from copper and brass, but occasionally steel. The helmet is usually connected to the suit by placing the holes around the rubberised collar of the suit over bolts along the rim of the <b>corselet,</b> and then clamping the brass straps known as brailes against the collar with wing nuts to press the rubber against the metal of the <b>corselet</b> rim to make a water-tight seal. An alternative method was to bolt the bonnet to the <b>corselet</b> over a rubber collar bonded {{to the top of the}} suit.|$|R

Sir Reginald might have said somewhat to cheer her, but at that instant little Arthur darted into the hall with news that the armourer was come from Taunton, with two mules, loaded with a store of goodly helmets, swords, and <b>corselets,</b> which he was displaying in the court.|$|E
60|$|It {{was served}} {{up in the}} great hall of the castle. Around the walls hung the hard-favored portraits of the heroes {{of the house of}} Katzenellenbogen, and the trophies which they had gained in the field, and in the chase. Hacked <b>corselets,</b> {{splintered}} jousting-spears, and tattered banners were mingled with the spoils of sylvan warfare: the jaws of the wolf and the tusks of the boar grinned horribly among crossbows and battle-axes, and a huge pair of antlers branched immediately over the head of the youthful bridegroom.|$|E
60|$|The vanguard was {{composed}} of Swiss and German mercenaries--tall fellows, these professional warriors, superb in their carriage and stepping {{in time to the}} beat of their drums; they were dressed in variegated, close-fitting garments that revealed all their athletic symmetry. A fourth of them were armed with long, square-bladed halberts, new to Italy; the remainder trailed their ten-foot pikes, and carried a short sword at their belts, whilst to every thousand of them there were a hundred arquebusiers. After them came the French infantry, without armour save the officers, who wore steel <b>corselets</b> and head-pieces. These, again, were followed by five thousand Gascon arbalisters, each shouldering his arbalest--a phalanx of short, rude fellows, not to be compared with the stately Swiss. Next came the cavalry, advancing in squadrons, glittering and resplendent in their steel casings; 2,500 of these were in full heavy armour, wielding iron maces and the ponderous lances that were usual also in Italy. Every man-at-arms had with him three horses, mounted by a squire and two valets (four men going to the lance in France). Some 5,000 of the cavalry were more lightly armed, in <b>corselets</b> and head-piece only, and they carried long wooden bows in the English fashion; whilst some were armed with pikes, intended to complete the work of the heavier cavalry. These were followed by 200 knights--the very flower of French chivalry for birth and valour--shouldering their heavy iron maces, their armour covered by purple, gold-embroidered surcoats. Behind them came 400 mounted archers forming the bodyguard of the king.|$|E
5000|$|Historically, {{deep sea}} diving helmets {{ranged from the}} no bolt to two bolt to four bolt helmets; helmets with six, eight, or 12 bolts; and Two-Three, Twelve-Four, and Twelve-Six bolt helmets. Bolts being the method of {{securing}} the helmet to the diving suit. The helmet could also be secured to the breastplate (<b>corselet)</b> by bolts {{as in the case}} of US twelve-four helmets (12 bolts to the suit, four bolts seal helmet to <b>corselet).</b> The no bolt helmet used a spring-loaded clamp to secure the helmet to <b>corselet</b> over the suit. Swedish helmets were distinctive for using a neck ring instead of a <b>corselet,</b> a pioneer of modern diving equipment but hugely cumbersome and uncomfortable for the diver. This equipment is commonly referred to as [...] "heavy gear." ...|$|R

60|$|When {{the pursuit}} {{was over the}} marques of Cadiz and his {{followers}} reposed themselves upon {{the banks of the}} Guadalete, where they divided the spoil. Among this were found many rich <b>corselets,</b> helmets, and weapons, the Moorish trophies of the defeat in the mountains of Malaga. Several were claimed by their owners; others were known to have belonged to noble cavaliers who had been slain or taken prisoners. There were several horses also, richly caparisoned, which had pranced proudly with the unfortunate warriors as they sallied out of Antiquera upon that fatal expedition. Thus the exultation of the victors was dashed with melancholy, and many a knight was seen lamenting over the helmet or corselet of some loved companion-in-arms.|$|E
60|$|Here the Countess and Wayland {{found the}} {{gate at the}} end of this avenue, which opened on the Warwick road, guarded by a body of the Queen's mounted yeomen of the guard, armed in <b>corselets</b> richly carved and gilded, and wearing morions instead of bonnets, having their carabines resting with the {{butt-end}} on their thighs. These guards, distinguished for strength and stature, who did duty wherever the Queen went in person, were here stationed under the direction of a pursuivant, graced with the Bear and Ragged Staff on his arm, as belonging to the Earl of Leicester, and peremptorily refused all admittance, excepting to such as were guests invited to the festival, or persons who were to perform some part in the mirthful exhibitions which were proposed.|$|E
60|$|The {{great hall}} of the castle is sixty-two feet in length and forty in breadth, ornamented with a richly carved Gothic roof, in which figures largely the family {{cognizance}} of the bear and ragged staff. There is a succession of shields, on which are emblazoned the quarterings of successive Earls of Warwick. The sides of the wall are ornamented with lances, <b>corselets,</b> shields, helmets, and complete suits of armor, regularly arranged as in an armory. Here I learned what the buff coat is, which had so often puzzled me in reading Scott's descriptions, as there were several hanging up here. It {{seemed to be a}} loose doublet of chamois leather, which was worn under the armor, and protected the body from its harshness.|$|E

The helmet neck thread is placed onto {{the neck of}} the <b>corselet</b> facing the divers left front, where the threads do not engage, and then rotated forward, engaging the thread and seating on a leather gasket to make a watertight seal. The helmet usually has a safety lock which prevents the bonnet from rotating back and separating underwater. Other styles of connection are also used, with the joint secured by clamps or bolts (usually three). Some helmets were made with the bonnet and <b>corselet</b> in one piece and secured to the suit in other ways.|$|R

The wardrobe of the queen was entirely destroyed, {{and there was an}} immense loss in plate, jewels, costly stuffs, and sumptuous armor of the luxurious nobles. The fire at first had been attributed to treachery, but on investigation it proved to be entirely accidental. The queen on retiring to her prayers had ordered her lady in attendance to remove a light burning near her couch, lest it should prevent her sleeping. Through heedlessness, the taper was placed {{in another part of the}} tent near the hangings, which, being blown against it by a gust of wind, immediately took fire.|$|E

His companion, who carried at his saddle-bow a shield blazoned with heraldic devices in scarlet and gold, was of still greater height, and very slight; his large keen eyes, hair and moustache, black as jet; and his complexion dark brown, with a well-formed aquiline nose, and a perfect and very white set of teeth.|$|E

60|$|Pleasure.--We {{have had}} a fine time in the Gilbert group, though four months on low islands, which {{involves}} low diet, is a largeish order; and my wife is rather down. I am myself, up to now, a pillar of health, though our long and vile voyage of calms, squalls, cataracts of rain, sails carried away, foretopmast lost, boats cleared and packets made on the approach of a p. d. reef, etc., has cured me of salt brine, and filled me with a longing for beef steak and mangoes not to be depicted. The interest has been immense. Old King Tembinoka of Apemama, the Napoleon of the group, poet, tyrant, altogether a man of mark, gave me the woven <b>corselets</b> of his grandfather, {{his father and his}} uncle, and, what pleased me more, told me their singular story, then all manner of strange tales, facts, and experiences for my South Sea book, which should be a Tearer, Mr. Burlingame: no one at least has had such stuff.|$|E

6000|$|Reichel and Mr. Leaf, however, {{think that}} [...] "bronze chitoned" [...] is {{probably}} [...] "a picturesque expression... and {{refers to the}} bronze- covered shield."

The process of evolution might be from a padded linen chiton ([Greek: linothooraes]) worn by Teucer, and on the Trojan side by Amphius (as by nervous Protestants during Oates's [...] "Popish Plot"), to a leathern chiton, strengthened by rings, or studs, or scales of bronze, and thence to plates. [Footnote: Ridgeway, Early Age of Greece, vol. i. pp. 309, 310.] Here, in this armoured chiton, would be an object that a poet might readily call [...] "a chiton of bronze." [...] But that, if he lived in the Mycenaean age, when, so far as art shows, CHITONS were not worn at all, or very little, and scarcely ever in battle, and when we know nothing of bronze-plating on shields, the poet should constantly call a monstrous double- bellied leather shield, or any other Mycemean type of shield, [...] "a bronze chiton," [...] seems almost unthinkable.
