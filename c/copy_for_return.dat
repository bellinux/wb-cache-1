50|$|Zaid {{and other}} Companions {{prepared}} {{between five and}} seven copies. One of these was sent to every Muslim province with the order that all other Quranic materials, whether fragmentary or complete copies, be burnt. When standard copies were made and were widely available to the Muslim community everywhere, then all other material was burnt voluntarily by Muslim communities themselves. This was important in order to eliminate variations or differences in the dialect from the standard text of the Quran. The Caliph Uthman kept a <b>copy</b> <b>for</b> himself and <b>returned</b> the original manuscript to Hafsah.|$|R

30|$|In the {{analytical}} sensitivity estimations, {{we found a}} wide linear range of detection for our RT-qPCR assays and LODs of 35.30 <b>copies</b> <b>for</b> DENV, 33.50 <b>copies</b> <b>for</b> WNV, 11.19 <b>copies</b> <b>for</b> Rickettsia and 27.43 <b>copies</b> <b>for</b> Leptospira.

We have confirmed the selectivity using in silico tests, thus ruling out possible amplifications due to DNA of other microorganisms. Additionally, primers for DENV reported by Lai et al. showed no amplifications when tested against non-DENV RNA. Although our work has shown promising results so far to diagnose DENV and Leptospira spp., {{we have not been}} able to analyze this assay with positive samples from patients positive to Rickettsia spp. and WNV.|$|R
