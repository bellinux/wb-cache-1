50|$|The alpha {{particles}} are {{also able to}} eject electrons from the inner shell (K- and L-shell) of an atom. These vacancies are filled by electrons from outer shells, which results in the emission of a <b>characteristic</b> <b>X-ray.</b> This process is termed particle-induced X-ray emission and {{is relatively easy to}} detect and has its best sensitivity and resolution for the heavier elements.|$|E
50|$|Following {{capture of}} an inner {{electron}} from the atom, an outer electron replaces the electron that was captured {{and one or}} more <b>characteristic</b> <b>X-ray</b> photons is emitted in this process. Electron capture sometimes also results in the Auger effect, where an electron is ejected from the atom's electron shell due to interactions between the atom's electrons {{in the process of}} seeking a lower energy electron state.|$|E

40|$|<b>Characteristic</b> <b>X-rays</b> have {{recently}} been explored as a method for the detection and identification of ions in accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) [H. Artigalas et al., Nucl. Instr. and Meth. B 92 (1994) 227; M. Wagner et al., Nucl. Instr. and Meth. B 89 (1994) 266]. After analysis in the AMS spectrometer, the ions stop in an appropriately chosen target and the induced X-rays identify the ions by atomic number.

50|$|If {{an inner}} {{electron}} has absorbed {{more than the}} binding energy (so that the atom ionizes), then a more outer electron may undergo a transition to fill the inner orbital. In this case, a visible photon or a <b>characteristic</b> <b>x-ray</b> is emitted, or a phenomenon known as the Auger effect may take place, where the released energy is transferred to another bound electron, causing it {{to go into the}} continuum. The Auger effect allows one to multiply ionize an atom with a single photon.|$|E

50|$|Low-energy {{electrons}} {{are produced}} from a tungsten filament, a lanthanum hexaboride crystal cathode or a field emission electron source and accelerated by a positively biased anode plate to 3 to 30 thousand electron volts (keV). The anode plate has central aperture and electrons that pass through it are collimated and focused {{by a series}} of magnetic lenses and apertures. The resulting electron beam (approximately 5 nm to 10 μm diameter) may be rastered across the sample or used in spot mode to produce excitation of various effects in the sample. Among these effects are: phonon excitation (heat), cathodoluminescence (visible light fluorescence), continuum X-ray radiation (bremsstrahlung), <b>characteristic</b> <b>X-ray</b> radiation, secondary electrons (plasmon production), backscattered electron production, and Auger electron production.|$|E
50|$|<b>Characteristic</b> <b>X-rays</b> {{can be used}} to {{identify}} the particular element from which they are emitted. This property is used in various techniques, including X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, particle-induced X-ray emission, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and wavelength-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy.|$|R
25|$|In {{secondary}} electron imaging, or SEI, the {{secondary electron}}s are emitted from {{very close to}} the specimen surface. Consequently, SEM can produce very high-resolution images of a sample surface, revealing details less than 1 nm in size. Back-scattered electrons (BSE) are beam electrons that are reflected from the sample by elastic scattering. They emerge from deeper locations within the specimen and consequently the resolution of BSE images is less than SE images. However, BSE are often used in analytical SEM along with the spectra made from the <b>characteristic</b> <b>X-rays,</b> because the intensity of the BSE signal is strongly related to the atomic number (Z) of the specimen. BSE images can provide information about the distribution of different elements in the sample. For the same reason, BSE imaging can image colloidal gold immuno-labels of 5 or 10nm diameter, which would otherwise be difficult or impossible to detect in secondary electron images in biological specimens. <b>Characteristic</b> <b>X-rays</b> are emitted when the electron beam removes an inner shell electron from the sample, causing a higher-energy electron to fill the shell and release energy. These <b>characteristic</b> <b>X-rays</b> are used to identify the composition and measure the abundance of elements in the sample.|$|R

5000|$|In 1922 de Hevesy co-discovered (with Dirk Coster) {{the element}} hafnium (72Hf) (Latin Hafnia for [...] "Copenhagen", the {{home town of}} Niels Bohr). Mendeleev's {{periodic}} table in 1869 put the chemical elements into a logical system, however there was missing a chemical element with 72 protons. On the basis of Bohr's atomic model Hevesy {{came to the conclusion}} that there must be a chemical element that goes there. The mineralogical museum of Norway and Greenland in Copenhagen furnished the material for the research. <b>Characteristic</b> <b>X-ray</b> spectra recordings made of the sample indicated that a new element was present. Later, in 1943, this would earn Hevesy the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. This account has been disputed by the likes of Mansel Davies and Eric Scerri who attribute the prediction that element 72 would be a transition element to the chemist Charles Bury.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1970s, {{dedicated}} X-ray astronomy satellites, such as Uhuru, Ariel 5, SAS-3, OSO-8 and HEAO-1, {{developed this}} {{field of science}} at an astounding pace. Scientists hypothesized that X-rays from stellar sources in our galaxy were primarily from a neutron star in a binary system with a normal star. In these [...] "X-ray binaries," [...] the X-rays originate from material traveling from the normal star to the neutron star in a process called accretion. The binary nature of the system allowed astronomers to measure {{the mass of the}} neutron star. For other systems, the inferred mass of the X-ray emitting object supported the idea of the existence of black holes, as they were too massive to be neutron stars. Other systems displayed a <b>characteristic</b> <b>X-ray</b> pulse, just as pulsars had been found to do in the radio regime, which allowed a determination of the spin rate of the neutron star.|$|E
5000|$|Specifically, the {{extensive}} {{analyses of the}} data that relate to hard x-ray generating collisions {{have resulted in a}} universal law (Z2-dependency) of the binding energy of the homonucleus MIMS bound by K-shell electrons (K-MIMS). Here Z is the atomic number of the constituent atoms of the K-MIMS. Bae further developed a unified theory to elucidate the Z2-dependent behavior of the homonucleus K-MIMS, which behaves much like the helium excimer molecule: He2*. [...] The MIMS theory also predicted a 1/Z dependency law for the bond length of the homonucleus K-MIMS. Based on the MIMS theory the uranium K-MIMS, for example, is predicted to have a 100 times smaller bond length, a 2,000 times larger binding energy, and a 5,000 times larger <b>characteristic</b> <b>x-ray</b> energy than the He excimer molecule. [...] The predicted bond lengths of the bismuth and uranium K-MIMS are in excellent agreement with that estimated from the experimental results by researchers at the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research in Darmstadt, Germany ...|$|E
40|$|Accelerator mass {{spectrometry}} (AMS) is an ultra-sensitive method for counting atoms, both radionuclides and stable nuclides. When using small tandem accelerators to measure heavy isotopes, interfering isobars are often troublesome. One {{way to reduce}} this interference is to combine AMS with the detection of <b>characteristic</b> <b>X-rays</b> of the projectile. After analysis in the AMS system {{it is possible to}} identify ions of different atomic number by their <b>characteristic</b> <b>X-rays,</b> by slowing down the ions in a suitable target. In this paper, the detection limit of Ni- 59 at the Land AMS facility is reported. A method for the chemical extraction of nickel from stainless steel, combined with a purification step to reduce the cobalt content in the sample by several orders of magnitude, is also described.

50|$|Palladium-103 is a {{radioisotope}} of {{the element}} palladium that has uses in radiation therapy {{for prostate cancer}} and uveal melanoma. Palladium-103 may be created from palladium-102 or from rhodium-103 using a cyclotron. Palladium-103 has a half-life of 16.99 days and decays by electron capture to rhodium-103, emitting <b>characteristic</b> <b>x-rays</b> with 21 keV of energy.|$|R
50|$|When an {{electron}} {{from the inner}} shell of an atom is excited by the energy of a photon, it moves to a higher energy level. When it returns to the low energy level, the energy which it previously gained by the excitation is emitted as a photon which has a wavelength that is characteristic for the element (there could be several characteristic wavelengths per element). Analysis of the X-ray emission spectrum produces qualitative results about the elemental composition of the specimen. Comparison of the specimen's spectrum with the spectra of samples of known composition produces quantitative results (after some mathematical corrections for absorption, fluorescence and atomic number). Atoms can be excited by a high-energy beam of charged particles such as electrons (in {{an electron}} microscope for example), protons (see PIXE) or a beam of X-rays (see X-ray fluorescence, or XRF). These methods enable elements from the entire periodic table to be analysed, {{with the exception of}} H, He and Li.In electron microscopy an electron beam excites X-rays; there are two main techniques for analysis of spectra of <b>characteristic</b> <b>X-ray</b> radiation: energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and wavelength dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (WDS).|$|E
5000|$|Isaac Asimov also speculated that, in {{the event}} that he had not been killed while {{in the service of the}} British Empire, Moseley might very well have been awarded the 1916 Nobel Prize in Physics, which, along with the prize for chemistry, was not awarded to anyone that year. Additional {{credence}} is given to this idea by noting the recipients of the Nobel Prize in Physics in the two preceding years, 1914 and 1915, and in the following year, 1917. In 1914, Max von Laue of Germany won the Nobel Prize in Physics for his discovery of the diffraction of X-rays by crystals, which was a crucial step towards the invention of X-ray spectroscopy. Then, in 1915, William Henry Bragg and William Lawrence Bragg, a British father-son pair, shared this Nobel Prize for their discoveries in the reverse problem — determining the structure of crystals using X-rays (Robert Charles Bragg, William Henry Bragg's other son, had also been killed at Gallipoli, on 2 September 1915). Next, Moseley used the diffraction of X-rays by known crystals in measuring the X-ray spectra of metals. This was the first use of X-ray spectroscopy and also one more step towards the creation of X-ray crystallography. In addition, Moseley's methods and analyses substantially supported the concept of atomic number, placing it on a firm, physics-based foundation. Moreover, Charles Barkla of Great Britain was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1917 for his experimental work in using X-ray spectroscopy in discovering the <b>characteristic</b> <b>X-ray</b> frequencies emitted by the various elements, especially the metals. [...] "Siegbahn, who carried on Moseley's work, received one 1924 Nobel Prize in Physics." [...] Moseley's discoveries were thus of the same scope as those of his peers, and in addition, Moseley made the larger step of demonstrating the actual foundation of atomic numbers. Ernest Rutherford commented that Moseley's work, [...] "Allowed him to complete during two years at the outset of his career a set of researches that would surely have brought him a Nobel prize".|$|E

30|$|There {{are several}} {{advantages}} of HEGP over MEGP for Ra- 223 imaging. First, {{according to the}} energy spectra using the LEHR, MEGP, and HEGP collimators, HEGP had the lowest detection count, followed by MEGP and then LEHR (Fig. 1). The results of a cylindrical phantom revealed that the spectral differences were due to the differences of the shielding effect between these collimators (Fig.  3). Second, the counts of the vial or hot rod around 84  keV were similar or even greater with HEGP despite the shielding effect. This is because the greatest peak of the Ra- 223 energy spectrum is coincidentally close to the peaks of these <b>characteristic</b> <b>X-rays.</b> The use of a thicker collimator would contribute to the efficient yield of <b>characteristic</b> <b>X-rays.</b> For these reasons, HEGP would give a higher image contrast than MEGP.
