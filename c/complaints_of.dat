5|$|There {{can be no}} more <b>complaints</b> <b>of</b> {{inactivity}} of the government. The forward march {{movement into}} Virginia, indicated in my despatches last night, {{took place at the}} precise time this morning that I named, but in much more imposing and powerful numbers.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{countries}} expressed concern about unliveable conditions, with The Times of India reporting that the Scottish delegation apparently submitted {{a photograph of a}} dog defecating on a bed in the Games Village. Secretary general of the Organising Committee Lalit Bhanot countered the <b>complaints</b> <b>of</b> poor sanitation when he claimed that cultural differences accounted for differing standards of cleanliness in India and the western world. He was subsequently ridiculed by both the Indian and international media.|$|E

5|$|By 13 August, North Korean {{troops were}} {{operating}} in the mountains west and southwest of Yongil Airfield. U.S. Air Force commanders—wary of enemy attack—evacuated the 45 P-51s of the 39th and 40th Fighter Squadron from the airstrip, against <b>complaints</b> <b>of</b> General MacArthur. However, the airstrip remained {{under the protection of}} UN ground forces and never came under direct North Korean fire. The squadrons were moved to Tsuiki on the island of Kyushu, Japan.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Daniels {{continued}} {{his effort to}} reduce state operating costs by signing into law a bill privatizing the enrollment service for the state's welfare programs. Indiana's welfare enrollment facilities were replaced with call centers operated by IBM. In mid-2009, after <b>complaints</b> <b>of</b> poor service, Daniels canceled the contract and returned the enrollment service to the public sector.|$|E
5|$|Oral {{analgesia}} is {{the cheapest}} and simplest mode of delivery. Other delivery routes such as sublingual, topical, transdermal, parenteral, rectal or spinal {{should be considered}} if the need is urgent, or in case of vomiting, impaired swallow, obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract, poor absorption or coma. Current evidence for the effectiveness of fentanyl transdermal patches in controlling chronic cancer pain is weak but they may reduce <b>complaints</b> <b>of</b> constipation compared with oral morphine.|$|E

5|$|The Judicial Nominating Commission is {{responsible}} for recruiting and interviewing applicants to fill vacancies on the Indiana Supreme Court, the Court of Appeals, and the Tax Court. It then sends three nominees for each vacancy to the governor. The Judicial Qualification Commission investigates <b>complaints</b> <b>of</b> judicial misconduct and files charges where appropriate. Both commissions have the same members and are chaired by the chief justice.|$|E
5|$|The PlayStation 3 port {{received}} less favorable reviews {{than the other}} two versions, but still had positive reviews overall. It contained a different longer bonus mission than the one included in the Xbox 360 port, but the chief <b>complaints</b> <b>of</b> the negative reviewers were downgraded graphics and long loading times. GameSpot has given the port a 7.1, making it the third lowest rating of the F.E.A.R. franchise in GameSpot.|$|E
5|$|The fire {{resulted}} in 244people requiring medical aidmainly {{on the first}} day of the fire. From those 117 had symptoms attributable to the incident, of whom 38 were members of the public. The majority of those visiting hospitals were from the rescue services and attended for precautionary check ups. Most of them had no symptoms, except for 63 emergency workers who suffered respiratory <b>complaints,</b> <b>of</b> which half were sore throats.|$|E
5000|$|In the play's final climactic scene, {{the other}} odd law of Candy comes into play. Cassilanes comes before the Senate with a <b>complaint</b> <b>of</b> ingratitude against his son; and Antinous, {{resigned}} to death, refuses to defend himself. But Erota makes a similar <b>complaint</b> <b>of</b> ingratitude against Cassilanes [...] - [...] which provokes Antinous {{to make the}} same complaint against her, in a sort of round-robin festival of egomania. The solution to this tangle comes when Annophel enters and makes her own <b>complaint</b> <b>of</b> ingratitude...against the Senate of Candy, for its treatment of her father.|$|R
50|$|In a 1983 {{report by}} the Cosmetic Ingredient Review, {{shampoos}} containing up to 31% ALS registered 6 health <b>complaints</b> out <b>of</b> 6.8 million units sold.

5|$|Although many aborigines assumed Han {{religious}} practices, several sub-groups sought {{protection from}} the European missionaries, who had started arriving in the 1860s. Many of the early Christian converts were displaced groups of Plains Aborigines that sought {{protection from the}} oppressive Han. The missionaries, under the articles of extraterritoriality, offered a form of power against the Qing establishment and could thus make demands on the government to provide redress for the <b>complaints</b> <b>of</b> Plains Aborigines. Many of these early congregations have served to maintain aboriginal identity, language and cultures.|$|E
5|$|De Saulles {{created the}} new florin {{in this manner}} to {{distinguish}} the coin from the half crown, as there had been <b>complaints</b> <b>of</b> confusion. He probably based the design on his British trade dollar (1895). The sitter for the design was Susan Hicks-Beach, the daughter of Michael Hicks-Beach, 1st Earl St Aldwyn who had served as Chancellor of the Exchequer and ex officio Master of the Mint. The modern-day Britannia coinage, bullion pieces struck by the Royal Mint for investors and collectors, has a reverse that strongly resembles that of the Edwardian florin.|$|E
5|$|General Bell {{had been}} the manager {{of one of the}} coal mines in Cripple Creek where the strike was taking place. It wasn't any {{surprise}} to Haywood that soldiers seemed to be working {{in the interests of the}} employers; he had seen that situation before. But when the Colorado legislature acknowledged the <b>complaints</b> <b>of</b> organized labor and passed an eight hour law, the Colorado supreme court declared it unconstitutional. So the WFM took the issue to the voters, and 72 percent of the state's voters approved the referendum. But the Colorado government ignored the results of the referendum.|$|E

5|$|In 1333, John de Montecorvino {{was officially}} {{replaced}} by Nicolaus de Bentra, who {{was chosen by}} Pope John XXII. There were <b>complaints</b> <b>of</b> {{the absence of the}} archbishop in 1338. Toghon Temür (the last Mongol ruler of the Yuan dynasty in China before their retreat to Mongolia to form the Northern Yuan dynasty) sent an embassy including Genoese Italians to Pope Benedict XII in 1336, requesting a new archbishop. The pope answered by sending legates and ecclesiastical leaders to Khanbaliq in 1342, which included Giovanni de Marignolli.|$|E
5|$|In {{common with}} most Maunsell designs, the Q class {{locomotives}} were reliable, {{but there were}} <b>complaints</b> <b>of</b> poor steaming when used on main-line trains (for which they were never designed). In 1940 Bulleid fitted {{one member of the}} class with a Lemaître blast pipe in an attempt to improve their efficiency. This proved to be successful and the remainder of the class were so fitted between 1946 and 1949. During the 1950s further experiments were carried out by the fitting of a British Railways Standard Class 4 plain blast pipe and small stovepipe chimney to no. 30549 in 1955, resulting in further improvements in both steaming and fuel consumption; in 1958–61, six more received the same blast pipe with a BR Standard Class 4 chimney.|$|E
5|$|In late 1982, Atari ported Pac-Man {{to its new}} console, the Atari 5200. This {{version was}} a more {{accurate}} conversion of the original arcade game and was a launch title for the console, along with eleven other games. The port was also followed by conversions of Pac-Mans arcade sequels, Ms. Pac-Man and Jr. Pac-Man, for the Atari 2600. Both were better received than Atari's first Pac-Man title and addressed many critics' <b>complaints</b> <b>of</b> Pac-Man, but {{at the cost of}} excluding a two-player mode and requiring larger ROM cartridges.|$|E

5|$|Laffoon {{responded to}} the {{economic}} crisis by declaring a four-day banking holiday to begin on March 1, 1933. He twice extended the holiday, which finally ended on March 18. Responding to <b>complaints</b> <b>of</b> low prices by farmers, he closed burley tobacco markets in December of that year. At {{the end of the}} 1932 fiscal year, figures showed that the state incurred a $2 million deficit. Kentucky was also unable to secure significant financial assistance under President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal because the state was often unable to raise the required matching funds.|$|E
5|$|Released {{as part of}} a shift by Microsoft towards regular yearly major updates for its {{software}} platforms and services, Windows 8.1 aims to address <b>complaints</b> <b>of</b> Windows 8 users and reviewers on launch. Visible enhancements include an improved Start screen, additional snap views, additional bundled apps, tighter OneDrive (formerly SkyDrive) integration, Internet Explorer 11, a Bing-powered unified search system, restoration of a visible Start button on the taskbar, and the ability to restore the previous behavior of opening the user's desktop on login instead of the Start screen. Windows 8.1 also added support for such emerging technologies as high-resolution displays, 3D printing, Wi-Fi Direct, and Miracast streaming, as well as the ReFS file system.|$|E
5|$|Resident Evil 5 had {{a mostly}} {{positive}} reception, {{although it was}} criticized for problems with its controls. The game received some initial <b>complaints</b> <b>of</b> racism, but {{an investigation by the}} British Board of Film Classification found the complaints were unsubstantiated. Resident Evil 5 was re-released for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in June 2016. As of June 2017 it has sold over 7.2 million units, making it Capcom's best-selling game and the best-selling game of the Resident Evil franchise. A special edition of the game, Resident Evil 5: Gold Edition, has sold an additional 2.3 million units. A sequel, Resident Evil 6, was released in 2012.|$|E
