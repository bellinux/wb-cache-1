40|$|This study {{examines}} management control systems (MCS) in two major {{companies in the}} brewing industry, and how these systems adapted in response to significant changes in their operating environments. During {{the period of the}} study, the brewing industry in question shifted from an oligopoly in which co-operative behaviour occurred to one in which more market-based competitive action is evident. These changes took place in the context of considerable deregulation of the entire economy and the dismantling of trade barriers with a major neighbouring trading partner. In addition, there were significant changes in societal and political attitudes towards alcohol products. The study involves a comparative analysis of the two companies over the period 1986 to 1990. The use of a broader framework for conceptualizing the relationship between <b>contingent</b> <b>variables</b> and MCS, coupled with the use of multiple methods of data collection including field studies, provided richer insights into the relationships between several <b>contingent</b> <b>variables</b> and MCS, how changes in MCS actually occur in response to changes in <b>contingent</b> <b>variables</b> and the relative effectiveness of these responses. This focus upon the processes by which MCS change is a departure from previous studies which have largely relied on data collected through structured questionnaires when analysing the relationships between MCS and <b>contingent</b> <b>variables.</b> Our results support the contingency fit notion, in particular, the importance of matching structure to changes in the external environment.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the public {{perceptions of the}} goals {{of the criminal justice system}} and attitudes towards juvenile delinquency. Public attitudes and criminal justice policies towards juvenile delinquents have continued to cycle between a rehabilitative and punitive response. These changes to policies have raised the question of whether the community continues to support the idea of saving young offenders or whether we should increase the length of sentences for juvenile offenders. Additionally, this study compared the relationship between socio-demographic variables and a child-saving attitude. Based on previous methodology used in the United States this study uses a <b>contingent</b> <b>variable</b> methodology to compare community attitudes towards rehabilitation and incarceration. The results indicate that that respondents are willing to spend as much on rehabilitation of juvenile offenders as they are on the incarceration of juvenile delinquents. Furthermore, participants in this study provided support for rehabilitative and utilitarian goals within the criminal justice system. The findings of this thesis suggest that the ideal of child-saving has persisted within the community and that policies should include rehabilitative and prevention intervention programmes for juvenile offenders...|$|E
40|$|Advanced Management Accounting (AMA) {{techniques}} {{have been the}} focus of many studies over the last decades.

This, allied to an increasing importance of SMEs around the world especially in developing countries, is the motivation for this research. This paper explores the uptake of a broad range of MAPs in 160 Malaysian SMEs firms in the manufacturing sector. The study finds that both Malaysian small and medium firms made extensive use of traditional MAPs and only selectively use modern MAPs such as non-financial performance measures related to internal processes and to customers. Results for all MAPs also indicate that a higher usage by medium firms as opposed to small firms. In most part of MAPs, medium firms adopted as twice as many small firms. The most significant differences relate to the use of decision support system and strategic management accounting. The employment of high qualified accounting staff by medium firms may as well lead the relatively higher uptake of MAPs by medium firms. Besides, the increased uptake of sophisticated management accounting practices by larger firms is in line with size being a <b>contingent</b> <b>variable</b> for explaining the use of such practices...|$|E
40|$|Aim – This {{empirical}} study {{explores the}} association between competition, business strategy, and the uses of a multiple performance measurement system in Bangladesh manufacturing firms. Design/methodology – The study uses a questionnaire survey of 50 manufacturing companies. Data were analyzed using multiple regression analysis and other descriptive statistics. Findings – The results suggest that greater emphasis on multiple measures for performance evaluation is associated with businesses that are facing high competition. The practices of multiple performance measures are also {{significantly related to the}} types of business strategy being followed. Specifically, firms pursuing a prospector strategy have relied more on multiple performance measures to rate business performance than the firms pursuing a defender strategy. Practical implications – The article notes that the designers of performance measurement systems need to consider contingent factors that affect an organizations' control system. Originality/value – Substantiating the connection between <b>contingent</b> <b>variables</b> and the use of multiple performance measures in manufacturing firms facilitate a better acceptance of firms' tendency toward new measurement tools.

40|$|Management {{control systems}} (MCS) {{can be defined}} as a set of {{procedures}} and processes that influence the behavior of managers to help ensure that they act {{in the best interest of}} the organization and its goals. In the extant literature the choice of MCS has primarily been studied from a contingency perspective. According to this perspective, a firm’s MCS choice is determined by the context in which the firm operates. Context is traditionally measured by <b>contingent</b> <b>variables</b> like the firm’s external environment, strategy, technology, size and industry. With this PhD dissertation I respond to Chenhall’s (2003) plea to study MCS choice not only from a contingency perspective, but to complement this perspective with alternative approaches to organizational functioning. To this end I extend the traditional contingency framework with an additional contingent variable: historical performance (chapter 3), and I combine the traditional contingency framework with ideas from upper echelons theory (chapter 4) and agency theory (chapter 5). I use survey-based evidence from small and medium-sized enterprises to test a number of hypotheses, which are grounded in contingency, upper echelons and agency theory.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the marketing-supply chain {{management}} (SCM) interface in new product development (NPD) processes through a contingent approach. Design/methodology/approach: The study endorses Thompson's taxonomy of interfaces - pooled interdependence, sequential interdependence and reciprocal interdependence - to classify the approaches observed through case study research on two innovation processes within the same unit. A number of <b>contingent</b> <b>variables</b> is hypothesized as possible factors impacting on the very interface adopted by the company. Thompson's taxonomy and the <b>contingent</b> <b>variables</b> constitute the conceptual framework of the study. Findings: Results show that the conceptual framework provides encouraging results in interpreting the marketing-SCM interface design by companies, even if some refinements, especially as far as the interface taxonomy are concerned, appear necessary to provide a comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon. Research limitations/implications: Since the study is based on two cases, outcomes cannot be generalized. Nonetheless, the preliminary results and the rich understanding of the phenomenon provided by the in-depth case studies suggested a number of research proposition to frame future research on the topic. Originality/value: The paper observes the marketing-SCM interface in a contingent way, providing a new interpretive framework for its analysis and design, and showing how the encouraged view in literature towards marketing-SCM integration may be problematic and counterproductive in specific circumstances...|$|R
40|$|To {{shed light}} on the {{relationship}} between technology and organisation, this article examines the classic work of Joan Woodward (1970; 1980) and her pioneering research conducted in 100 firms in South Essex. This work is rightly famous for its identification of technology (defined as 'production system') as the principal <b>contingent</b> <b>variable</b> in organisational structure and behaviour. After a brief review of salient points from this work we then discuss some more contemporary literature. Our focus is with those studies that examine the potential for organisational and business transformation through advances in Information, Computing and Telecommunications technologies (ICTs). The view that organisations can be embodied within a 'virtual reality' constituted through electronic interactions is questioned and the consequence of such a stance for our understanding of work is discussed. For more managerialist writers, it is shown how these possibilities have been presented as servicing the empowerment of both the employee and the customer (Hammer and Champy 1993). For critics, they often signal new and more pervasive possibilities for surveillance, control and the invasion of privacy [...] a trend captured by the concept of the electronic panopticon (Foucault 1977; Sewell and Wilkinson 1992). We shall suggest that both these positions owe a considerable amount to misinterpretations of Woodward's pioneering work and the tendency to elevate the determining characteristics of technology. However, we shall question what we term the 'South Essex' legacy of the technology/organisation relationship. To do so we will draw upon the distinction made by Castells (1996; 2000) between 'virtual reality' and 'real virtuality'. This, we argue, suggests a rather different way of conceptualising the possibilities for organisational transformation through the application of 'virtual technologies'. The insights gained have, we believe, considerable potential practical implications for both organisational and system designers...|$|E

The outcome of this study helps identify the contingency variables that explain the risk management challenges faced by Islamic bankers in Kazakhstan with respect to other Islamic markets, such as Indonesia and Malaysia. In order to explore the contingency variables influencing the risk management process and performance, this study utilised multiple layers and sources of information. Firstly, using semi-structured protocols, we interviewed top, middle and operation-level risk managers from large and small Islamic and conventional banks of Kazakhstan. We extended the surveys to Indonesia and Malaysia to learn from already established risk management system. Secondly, we find that several risk related financial ratios to strengthen our findings. Risk management system {{is influenced by the}} type of risks and a number of contingency variables. Credit, operational and market risks are the three major risks for Islamic banks in Kazakhstan. Limited know-how of risk management and limited use of technology are the two most important firm specific contingency variables. Limited secondary market, limited regulatory assistance, and limited use of derivatives are the three most important industry specific contingency variables that have great influence on the risk management of Islamic banks. The influence of industry-specific factors is apparently bolder than the influence of firm specification limitations. We also find that the size of the market influences all the stages of enterprise risk management, which has been identified as a <b>contingent</b> <b>variable</b> by previous studies on non-financial sector. The results are vitally important for Kazakhstan as the country is planning to turn the economy into a hub of Islamic finance in the Central Asia.

40|$|This {{research}} {{attempts to}} study the influence of organisational culture (OC) on the acceptance, importance and use of performance measurement systems (PMS) in Libyan higher education. To achieve the objectives of this research, a contingency theory is adopted. Organisational culture as a <b>contingent</b> <b>variable</b> was identified from the literature and appropriate statistical tests were undertaken to ascertain its influence. The organisational culture assessment instrument (OCAI) devised by Cameron & Quinn (2011) was chosen to be the conceptual model for determining the organisational culture type of institutions. Using the OCAI, an organisational culture profile could be verified by determining the organisation's dominant culture type characteristics. The Competing Values Framework (CVF) model developed by Cameron & Quinn (2011) was chosen to be a measurement tool for Organisational Culture (OC) to examine aspects of dominant organisational culture types in the Libyan higher education sector. A mixed methods quantitative and qualitative) approach, involving a survey questionnaire and interviews, was adopted. Descriptive statistics, which include frequencies and percentages, were utilized to present the main characteristics of the sample, the profiles of organisations’ cultural types, and the information gained {{in relation to the}} acceptance, importance and use of performance measurement systems. The sample of this study consists of three types of Libyan higher education (universities, higher institutions and technical collages). The intended participant lists covered the entire population of all groups in Libyan higher education. The study revealed that the three types of Libyan higher education are not homogeneous. In addition, the study showed that job titles and positions, experience and education levels are among the factors that influence organisational culture and thereby PMS acceptance, importance and use. While Libyan higher education in general, which includes public universities and technical colleges, was dominated by a Hierarchy culture that favours a centralised management style, the private and higher institutions were dominated by a Clan culture which is often found in ‘family-type’ organisations. Hierarchy culture exhibited a significant negative direct relationship with the acceptance and importance of performance measurement systems in Libyan universities. On the other hand, Clan culture exhibited a significant negative direct relationship with the acceptance and use of performance measurement systems in Libyan higher institutions. The contingency theory of performance measurement systems {{is based on the assumption}} that there is no universally appropriate use of performance measurement systems that applies equally to all organisations in all circumstances and the findings of this thesis are consistent with this contingency theory assumption. Therefore, organisational culture as a factor of contingency theory has influence on some aspects of performance measurement systems and does not influence others, and this depends on a given organisation’s circumstances...|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} within {{the health care industry}} to investigate the relationship between <b>contingent</b> <b>variables,</b> management accounting systems (MAS) information, and managerial performance. The proposed research framework utilizes the foundations of contingency and work performance theory to determine the <b>contingent</b> <b>variables</b> that influence the extent of use of MAS information; namely, technology, organizational structure, and perceived environmental uncertainty. In addition, it investigates how the appropriate fit between these <b>contingent</b> <b>variables</b> and MAS information characteristics (scope, timeliness, aggregated, and integrated information), which serve as the mediator, would enhance the managerial performance of Egyptian managers in health care. Finally, it examines the effect of hospital size on the relationship between the research contextual variables, MAS information, and managerial performance. Due to its complexity and continuous inept administration despite years following its reform, the Egyptian hospital industry was chosen as the ideal setting to investigate these relationships. In addition, the data analysis of this study used 200 responses from the managers of departments within Egyptian hospitals. Using partial least squares (PLS), the results reveal that the absence or partial support for the positive relationship between technology and MAS information may give attention to re-organize the Egyptian hospitals to make fit between the two variables. In addition, centralization needs to be deemphasized and greater attention should be given to decentralization instead. Moreover, the cognizance of both the internal and external environment in which Egyptian hospitals operate should be considered in designing MAS. Despite MAS information characteristics, such as broad scope, timeliness, and integrated information may provide motivation for Egyptian managers to enhance their managerial iii performance. The absence of the mediating role of MAS information in Egyptian hospitals explains the resistance within Egyptian hospitals (especially among physicians) against MAS that have been provided during healthcare reform. Therefore, MAS designers and Egyptian policy makers should pay attention to eliminate any constraints that limit the professional power of physicians and decentralize decision making via delegating sufficient authority to lower level managers to influence the design of the accounting systems. Finally, the partial support for the existing positive effect for hospital size provides motivation to determine the appropriate hospital size, for both the private and government sectors, that will gain advantage from using more sophisticated accounting systems...|$|R

This, allied to an increasing importance of SMEs around the world especially in developing countries, is the motivation for this research. This research explores the uptake of a broad range of MAPs in Malaysian SMEs; identifies the roles of MAPs in the management of SMEs; determines factors that affect the extent of use of MAPs in SMEs and lastly examines the relationship between the use of MAPs and organizational performance of SMEs. A postal questionnaire was conducted to 1, 000 Malaysian SMEs in manufacturing sector which elicited 160 useable responses. The results show that the majority of respondents have used the five management accounting areas identified. Use of the costing system, budgeting system and performance evaluation system are significantly higher than for the decision support system and strategic management accounting, which indicates that the uptake of traditional MAPs is greater than for sophisticated MAPs. The results indicate that medium sized firms make greater use of all MAPs as opposed to small sized enterprises. The most significant differences relate to the use of decision support system and strategic management accounting. The increased uptake of sophisticated MAPs by larger firms is in line with size being a <b>contingent</b> <b>variable</b> explaining the use of such practices. The results also suggest that MAPs were perceived as playing very important roles in the management of Malaysian SMEs. Performance evaluation and controlling activities were the major roles of MAPs in the management of SMEs. Overall the study suggests 4 that MAPs are perceived by SMEs as relevant and useful in their management processes. Further, the study found that four out of five contingent factors; size of the firm, intensity of market competition; participation of the owner/manager in the development of MAPs in firm and advanced manufacturing technology have a positive and statistically significant relationship with the use of certain MAPs. The research however found weak support for the positive relationship between the use of MAPs and organizational performance of SMEs. This study enriches the existing body of knowledge of management accounting by providing information as to the use of MAPs in SMEs in Malaysia. The findings can be specifically informative for policy makers intent on developing management accounting skills among Malaysian SMEs. This research will provide valuable insights into the nature of MAPs in SMEs in a developing country and will promote interest among Malaysian researchers as well as researchers of other countries to make the SME sector a focus of interest in management accounting research...|$|E

40|$|Although {{management}} accounting research based on contingency theory has a relatively long tradition, many {{recent studies have}} called for additional work {{in order to increase}} the understanding of possible contingency factors that explain the adoption of {{management accounting}} practices (MAPs). This, in addition to a general lack of knowledge of MAPs, especially in developing countries, is the motivation for this research study. The main focus of this research is to investigate the state of MAPs within Libyan companies and identify and explain the relationships between these MAPs and contingent factors. To capture these relationships in sufficient depth, a theoretical contingency model which includes 14 variables was developed based on an extensive review of the relevant literature and the examination of various possible forms and levels of fit. This model adopts both congruency and contingency approaches of fit and considers mediated relationships between <b>contingent</b> <b>variables,</b> MAPs and organisational performance. Primary data were collected by means of a survey questionnaire from 123 companies and face-to-face interviews with senior managers in 10 of these companies. The results of this study show that the adoption rates of most MAPs in Libyan companies are lower than those found in other countries as reported in the literature (e. g. USA, UK, Australia and India). MAPs in these Libyan companies also seem to serve a narrow range of purposes. In addition, budgeting practices are more popular and take precedence in the respondent companies. The testing of hypothesised direct and mediated relationships using regression analysis indicates that there is no single variable that has a significant effect on all three types of MAP (i. e. cost, budgets and measurement performance). Nine of the 14 <b>contingent</b> <b>variables</b> are statistically links to the type of MAP; seven of these (i. e. build strategy, differentiation strategy, prospector strategy, formalisation, product diversity, size and ownership type) to budgeting and performance measurement practices, and the other two (i. e. formalisation and ownership type) to cost and budgeting practices. Of significance also is the result that MAPs play a mediating role between many <b>contingent</b> <b>variables</b> and organisational performance. While most interviewees acknowledged the importance of <b>contingent</b> <b>variables</b> in relation to MAPs, they mentioned several reasons for not having MAPs that fully encompass the business environment. The reasons include lack of knowledge about MAPs, shortage of financial resources, the company being newly established, lack of top management support, absence of the culture of using MAPs and fear of change. Finally, this study represents a most comprehensive survey and explanation of MAPs in a developing country, namely Libya, which is an emerging economy. It contributes to enriching our understanding of how MAPs can be adopted more effectively and efficiently from a contingency perspective, through identifying the impact of this relationship on organisation effectiveness in developing countries, and to bridging the gap in MAPs literature. However, this study not only contributes to the inspiration and helps to identify whether there are differences in the relationship between contingent factors and MAPs between industrialised and developing countries, but also gives a more in-depth understanding of these relationships for discerning the individual impacts of the various <b>variables</b> of <b>contingent</b> factors on various MAPs (i. e. cost, budgets and measurement performance) ...|$|R

The study examines corporate social performance by referencing the influence of <b>contingent</b> <b>variables,</b> both internal and external, such as the business model, organizational culture, leadership, total quality management, cultural diversity, and research and theory, and highlights the role of these factors in enhancing corporate social performance and eases the process of ranking organizations with an important role in emerging markets based on social performance...|$|R

However, this direct relationship does not seem to be empirically conclusive. Therefore, dependent variables that are more directly sensitive to entrepreneurial orientation, and <b>contingent</b> <b>variables</b> should therefore be considered. In this paper we suggest, firstly, that innovation performance acts as a mediating variable between entrepreneurial orientation and firm performance; secondly, that entrepreneurial orientation is positively related to organizational learning capability; and thirdly, organizational learning capability plays a significant role in determining the effects of entrepreneurial orientation on innovation performance. KEY WORDS: entrepreneurial orientation, organizational learning capability, innovation performance, firm performance...|$|R

A model of the new venture control process is distilled and explored in six new venture cases. The control processes were traced through {{an examination of the}} everyday language of venture principals to determine a grounded lower order model. Integrating these models into contingency theory locates strategic risk reduction choices as the crucial link between <b>contingent</b> <b>variables</b> and organizational control packages. In this sense the process of organizing is seen as a tiered process of risk reduction: successful firms analyze and control risks. The control package is the organization...|$|R

The article reviews the main contribution made on compensation, performance measurement and risk topics by the academic literature and suggests some interesting directions for the future research: the building of a comprehensive theory of compensation systems; the need of a deeper knowledge of existing practices and an assessment of their consistency with theories; empirical findings of cause and effect relationships between <b>contingent</b> <b>variables,</b> compensation systems features and performance; the choice of better performance indicators, more compliant of different stakeholders' perspectives and needs...|$|R

Descriptive statistics, bi-variate regression analysis and moderated regression analysis were used to analyze data. The findings revealed moderate prevalence of Interactive control mean 2. 86, std dev 0. 83. The most prevalent strategic orientation was the reactor (60...|$|R
40|$|The {{democratic}} institutions, {{especially the}} electoral institutions for converting votes into seats that were chosen during independence negotiations, {{have been the}} key to democratic stability in Mauritius. These institutions emerged out of strategic bargaining structured around a combination of contextual and <b>contingent</b> <b>variables.</b> Conflicting political interests reflecting a combination of class, sectarian and communal interests influenced the institutional preferences of Mauritian elites involved in independence negotiations, leading them to converge on institutional designs that they expected would protect and promote those interests in the new democratic polity. Once in place, the new institutions represented equilibrium outcomes, creating incentives for all actors, engendering a learning curve in peaceful accommodation of inter-group conflicts, and establishing the political basis for social stability, democratic consolidation, and economic development...|$|R

To attain these objectives, the research used a questionnaire method; 64 valid questionnaires were returned, giving a 67. 3 % response rate. Several statistical analyses were used to analyse the responses, namely, descriptive analysis and bivariate correlation analysis (Kendall`s tau test). The research reveals that newly formed companies that have operated in the Jordanian financial sector in terms of their age, net sale growth, number of employees. In terms of budgeting practices, the research revealed that the traditional budgeting practices are the most heavily used in the Jordanian financial sector, for example budgeting for planning. In terms of examine the association between each contingency variables and the extent of usage of budgeting practice in the Jordanian financial sector, the research indicated that there is a positive association between following <b>contingent</b> <b>variables</b> and the extent of usage of budgeting practices, namely; age of the company (number of years since establishment); net sale growth, number of employees; sophistication of operations; and professional certificates. The research provides a broad overview of budgeting practices in the Jordanian financial sector, indicates a lack of using budgeting practices in the developing countries and indicates the improvement which would take place in the Jordanian financial sector in terms of the adoption of more sophisticated or advance budgeting practices. In addition, the research informs practitioners of the main variables that influence the usage of budgeting practices and of those variables that need {{to be taken into account}} when planning the adoption or development of budgeting practices.
