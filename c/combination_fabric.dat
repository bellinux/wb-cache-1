50|$|Union dyeing is “a {{method of}} dyeing a fabric {{containing}} {{two or more}} types of fibers or yarns to the same shade so as to achieve {{the appearance of a}} solid colored fabric”. Fabrics can be dyed using a single or multiple step process. Union dyeing is used to dye solid colored blends and <b>combination</b> <b>fabrics</b> commonly used for apparel and home furnishings.|$|R

50|$|Cross dyeing is “a {{method of}} dyeing blend or <b>combination</b> <b>fabrics</b> {{to two or}} more shades {{by the use of}} dyes with {{different}} affinities for the different fibers”. The cross dyeing process can be used to create heather effects, and plaid, check, or striped fabrics. Cross dyed fabrics may be mistaken for fiber or yarn dyed materials as the fabric is not a solid color, a characteristic considered typical of piece dyed fabrics. It is not possible to visually differentiate between cross dyed fabrics and those dyed at the fiber or yarn stage. An example is cross dyeing blue worsted wool fabric with polyester pin stripes. When dyed, the wool yarns are dyed blue, whereas the polyester yarns remain white.|$|R

30|$|In this study, three {{clothing}} was produced using a <b>combination</b> of <b>fabric</b> and 3 D printout. In {{the case of}} Design 1, stiff fabric such as PVC was used to support the 3 D printout while maintaining its shape, but the combined weight of the 3 D printout and the fabric made a wearer uncomfortable.

Therefore, soft fabric had a limitation when being used with 3 D printout.|$|R

50|$|The basic {{reinforcement}} {{material for}} this process is glass-fibre rovings, which are chopped to a length of 10 to 40 mm and then applied on the mould. For improved mechanical properties, a <b>combination</b> of <b>fabric</b> and chopped fibre layers is used. The most common material type is E-glass, but carbon and Kevlar rovings can also be used. Continuous strand mat, fabric, and various types of core materials are embedded by hand whenever required. The weight fraction of reinforcement in this process is typically 20 to 40% of the total weight of the part. The most common resin system used for the spray-up process is general purpose or DCDP polyester; isophthalic polyesters and vinylesters are also sometimes used. Fast-reacting resins with a pot life of 30 to 40 minutes are typical. The resin often contains {{a significant amount of}} filler. The most common fillers are calcium carbonates and aluminium trihydrates. In filled resin systems, fillers replace some of the reinforcements; 5 to 25% filler is used by weight.|$|R

40|$|Under the {{direction}} of Trevor Little.) The apparel design process involves gathering and analyzing information on fashion trends, markets, past line sales and editing ideas for successful <b>combinations</b> of <b>fabric,</b> style and price. These ideas {{are the result of}} creativity. Creativity is most often the modeled as a problem solving process involving complex chaotic systems. In the fields of architecture and software design, pattern languages have been developed to help understand the various fundamental components and dynamics of complex systems by using a series of related generic problem-solving patterns empirically proven to be successful in a specified context of forces. Patterns record existing knowledge to make it rapidly and easily accessible and communicated between different users. The research objective of this dissertation was to develop a pattern language describing the initial creative phase of the apparel design process. First, an archetype of the initial creative process in apparel design was constructed based on the literature reviewed to integrate the intervening marketing and design components, and suggest a set of links between these components and the various stages of the process.
