50|$|The {{festival of}} Lycaea {{involved}} human sacrifice to Zeus.

According to Pausanias the werewolf could once again live as a man provided he abstained from human flesh for nine years; if however the wolf tasted the flesh of a man he would remain a beast forever. Augustine and Pliny agree with the main aspects of the story but <b>claim</b> the requisite <b>waiting</b> <b>period</b> was ten years, not nine. The story is briefly alluded to in Plato’s masterpiece, The Republic, however in Plato's version there is no suggestion that the change could be undone.|$|R

We provide evidence that the <b>waiting</b> <b>period</b> is also strongly related to leverage, investment and managerial incentives. Controlling for other potential determinants, we show that the probability of switching syndicate size in subsequent SEOs is strongly related to <b>waiting</b> <b>periods</b> and underwriter switches.

40|$|STUDY QUESTION: What is {{the effect}} of the {{positive}} reappraisal coping intervention (PRCI) on anxiety in women awaiting the outcome of an IVF/ICSI cycle? SUMMARY ANSWER: Women reported significantly more anxiety during the <b>waiting</b> <b>period</b> than before treatment, but the use of the PRCI did not significantly reduce anxiety during the <b>waiting</b> <b>period.</b> WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Waiting for the outcome of IVF/ICSI treatment after embryo transfer {{is one of the most}} stressful periods of fertility treatments. At present, no evidence-based coping interventions are available to assist women though this <b>waiting</b> <b>period.</b> The PRCI has been designed to address this unmet need by promoting positive reappraisal coping. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: A three-armed randomized controlled trail (RCT) was designed to evaluate the PRCI in women undergoing IVF/ICSI. Data were collected between October 2010 and June 2012. A total of 377 participants were randomized to receive either the PRCI and emotional monitoring, emotional monitoring only, or routine care. Only the PRCI-monitoring group received the coping intervention, comprising an explanatory leaflet and ten statements to be read at least once in the morning and once in the evening. PARTICIPANT, MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: To capture the general impact of the PRCI, all three groups completed questionnaires at three time points: just before the <b>waiting</b> <b>period</b> (time 1 : stimulation phase), on Day 10 of the 14 -day <b>waiting</b> <b>period</b> (time 2 : <b>waiting</b> <b>period)</b> and 6 weeks after the start of the <b>waiting</b> <b>period</b> (time 3 : 6 -week follow-up). In addition, to capture the specific impacts of the PRCI on the days of the <b>waiting</b> <b>period,</b> the PRCI-monitoring group and the monitoring-control group also rated their emotions and reactions daily, for the 14 -day <b>waiting</b> <b>period.</b> MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Of the women who agreed to participate and who met eligibility criteria, 377 were randomized. All study participants reported significantly more anxiety and depression during the <b>waiting</b> <b>period</b> than before treatment (P < 0. 001). The mean difference in anxiety between time 1 versus time 2 was 1. 465 (95 % CI 1. 098 - 1. 832). The mean difference in depression between time 1 versus time 2 was 0. 514 (95 % CI 0. 215 - 0. 813). Use of the PRCI did not significantly reduce anxiety or depression, or daily negative emotions during the <b>waiting</b> <b>period.</b> However, patients randomized to the PRCI reported significantly more positive emotions during the <b>waiting</b> <b>period</b> (P < 0. 001) than the monitoring-control group, and reported the intervention to be easy to use, and as having a positive psychological effect. No significant differences were found between the groups in treatment outcome. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The lack of difference observed in the present study for anxiety levels between the PRCI and the monitoring-control group could have been due to the effects of monitoring itself or its ability to attenuate or obscure the effects of the PRCI intervention in unknown ways. A randomized group of women who used only the PRCI without daily monitoring would provide more insight. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The PRCI was shown to help women reinterpret the demands of the <b>waiting</b> <b>period</b> in a more positive way. These results are consistent with previous studies showing that positive reappraisal coping is a useful strategy for unpredictable and uncontrollable situations represented by a medical <b>waiting</b> <b>period.</b> This simple low cost self-help coping intervention increases positive affect during the <b>waiting</b> <b>period</b> in an IVF/ICSI treatment.

40|$|Evaluation of two {{dairy herd}} {{reproductive}} performance indicators that are adjusted for voluntary <b>waiting</b> <b>period</b> Emma Löf 1, 2 *, Hans Gustafsson 2, 3 and Ulf Emanuelson 1 Background: Overall reproductive performance of dairy herds is monitored by various indicators. Most {{of them do}} not consider all eligible animals and do not consider different management strategies at farm level. This problem can be alleviated by measuring the proportion of pregnant cows by specific intervals after their calving date or after a fixed time period, such as the voluntary <b>waiting</b> <b>period.</b> The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate two reproductive performance indicators that consider the voluntary <b>waiting</b> <b>period</b> at the herd. The two indicators were: percentage of pregnant cows in the herd after the voluntary <b>waiting</b> <b>period</b> plus 30 days (PV 30) and percentage of inseminated cows in the herd after the voluntary <b>waiting</b> <b>period</b> plus 30 days (IV 30). We wanted to assess how PV 30 and IV 30 perform in a simulation of herds with different reproductive management and physiology and to compare them to indicators of reproductive performance that do not consider the herd voluntary <b>waiting</b> <b>period.</b> Methods: To evaluate the reproductive indicators we used the SimHerd-program, a stochastic simulation model...|$|R

The income and expenditure analysis of the sickness insurance helps to reveal that the costs of sickness insurance have decreased, which was also due to the implementation of the <b>waiting</b> <b>period.</b> This work evaluates data, which indicate that the short-term morbidity has decreased as well as the work incapacity. There are detailed calculations in the conclusion which show how adjustments in the sickness insurance changed the amount of wage compensation and the sick benefits.

40|$|Background The aim of {{this study}} was to {{understand}} how women with single or recurrent miscarriages cope during the <b>waiting</b> <b>periods</b> after miscarriage – waiting for pregnancy or waiting for pregnancy confirmation – and to investigate their perception of a ‘positive reappraisal’ coping intervention designed for these <b>waiting</b> <b>periods.</b> Positive reappraisal is a cognitive strategy to change the meaning of a situation, specifically reinterpreting the situation in a more positive way. Methods A qualitative methodology was used. Data were obtained from two focus groups comprising nine women with one or more miscarriages. Results Two core categories, ‘uncertainty’ and ‘bracing’, were highlighted during the <b>waiting</b> <b>period</b> for confirmation of an ongoing pregnancy. Women who had experienced a single miscarriage appraised this <b>waiting</b> <b>period</b> as benign and used distraction and coping by social support. Women with recurrent miscarriages could not confidently appraise the <b>waiting</b> <b>period</b> as one that would bring hope or joy and used bracing for the worst as their coping strategy to manage this ambivalence. With this strategy, women tried to control their current emotions, and looked into the future to try to minimise their distress if a further miscarriage occurred. Although all women thought that a ‘positive reappraisal’ coping intervention would be practical and applicable during <b>waiting</b> <b>periods,</b> only women with recurrent miscarriages actually wanted to use such an intervention. Conclusions Coping interventions targeting reappraisal of the <b>waiting</b> <b>period</b> stressor situation could help women to cope as they wait for a subsequent pregnancy to be confirmed as ongoing. Coping interventions may need to be tailored, but before any strategy is introduced, further study is needed to identify the most appropriate approach...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} when {{to start}} and stop breeding cows in their lactation. First, {{a review of the}} literature on the optimal voluntary <b>waiting</b> <b>period</b> (when to start breeding cows) shows that there is not much consensus on how long the economically optimal voluntary <b>waiting</b> <b>period</b> is. Secondly, the paper then describes a computer program that calculates the insemination value (IN$) for cows in a herd to support breeding decisions. The insemination value is the expected profit from breeding the cow compared to not breeding her when a breeding opportunity arises. Cows with an insemination value less than $ 0 should not be bred. Early in lactation this implies that the voluntary <b>waiting</b> <b>period</b> for cows with an insemination value less than $ 0 should be extended. The program showed that high producing persistent cows should have an extended voluntary <b>waiting</b> <b>period.</b> On the other hand, extending the voluntary <b>waiting</b> <b>period</b> for low producing cows could be costly. Insemination values are illustrated for the cows at the University of Florida Dairy Research Unit.
