By 1972, forty years of protectionism and fifteen years of export promotion induced the coexistence of large <b>exporting</b> <b>plants</b> with import competing plants within 4 -digit industries. During trade liberalisation we document persistent horizontal waves of creative destruction, a decline in traditional import competing plants and an expansion in <b>exporting</b> <b>plants,</b> within each sector.

40|$|Exporting {{is often}} {{touted as a}} way to {{increase}} economic growth. This paper examines the interaction between exporting and productivity growth in U. S. manufacturing. While <b>exporting</b> <b>plants</b> have substantially higher productivity levels, {{there is no evidence that}} <b>exporting</b> increases <b>plant</b> productivity growth rates. The higher productivity of exporters largely predates their entry into exporting. However, within the same industry, exporters do grow faster than non-exporters in terms of both shipments and employment. Exporting is associated with the reallocation of resources from less efficient to more efficient plants. In the aggregate, these reallocation effects are quite large, making up over 40 % of total factor productivity growth in the manufacturing sector. Half of this reallocation to more productive plants occurs within industries and the direction of the reallocation is towards <b>exporting</b> <b>plants...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates whether {{exporting}} generates positive productivity spillover {{effects on}} other {{plants in the}} same industry and on plants in vertically related industries. Using data for Chilean manufacturing plants from 1990 to 1999, we find strong evidence that domestic as well as foreign-owned <b>exporting</b> <b>plants</b> improve productivity of local suppliers. We also find some evidence of horizontal spillovers from exporting but these are mainly generated by plants with foreign ownership. These results suggest that positive productivity spillovers are not only generated {{by the presence of}} foreign-owned <b>exporting</b> <b>plants</b> but also by exporting activity of domestic firms. The results are robust to controls for agglomeration of economic activity, the importance of non-exporting foreign-owned plants, and plant unobserved heterogeneity...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} trade liberalization on plant scale, production-run length and product diversification. We first develop a model of trade in differentiated products with multi-product plants. We then present empirical evidence using a large panel of Canadian manufacturing plants and their experience with the 1989 Canada-U. S. Free Trade Agreement (FTA). The model predicts that the bilateral tariff reduction reduces the product diversification of <b>exporting</b> <b>plants,</b> increases the production-run length and has an ambiguous effect {{on the size of}} those plants. It also reduces the product diversification and size of non-exporting plants, and has no effect on the production-run length of those plants. The empirical evidence on non-exporting plants provides broad support for the model. The evidence on <b>exporting</b> <b>plants</b> shows that exporters reduce product diversification, and increase production-run length and plant size, but those changes {{do not appear to be}} related to tariff cuts. Once in the <b>export</b> markets, <b>plants</b> respond to forces other than tariff cuts. Further tariff cuts have less effect on those plants.
