25|$|On December 22, 2011, Wisconsin {{offensive}} coordinator Paul Chryst was introduced {{as the head}} coach and lead the Panthers in their final season of the Big East which included another appearance in the BBVA <b>Compass</b> <b>Bowl</b> and a 6–7 final record. Chryst was the Panthers' fourth head football coach since December 2010 (sixth counting interims).|$|E
25|$|Mariners' {{compasses}} {{can have}} two or more magnets permanently attached to a compass card, which moves freely on a pivot. A lubber line, {{which can be a}} marking on the <b>compass</b> <b>bowl</b> or a small fixed needle, indicates the ship's heading on the compass card. Traditionally the card is divided into thirty-two points (known as rhumbs), although modern compasses are marked in degrees rather than cardinal points. The glass-covered box (or bowl) contains a suspended gimbal within a binnacle. This preserves the horizontal position.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the 2010 season, Pitt was {{selected}} as the preseason favorite to win the Big East and was ranked fifteenth in the preseason polls. However, Pitt stumbled out of the gate with an overtime loss at Utah and dropped out of the polls {{for the remainder of the}} season. Although they claimed a share of the Big East championship (along with Connecticut and West Virginia), Pitt ended the regular season with a disappointing 7–5 record and an invitation to the BBVA <b>Compass</b> <b>Bowl.</b> This prompted Dave Wannstedt's resignation as head coach on December 7, 2010, with defensive coordinator Phil Bennett taking over for the bowl game.|$|E
50|$|A {{limitation}} {{imposed by}} a compass' construction {{is that the}} balancing bowl's pin, which is connected to a pivot point, only allows, in most <b>compasses,</b> the <b>bowl</b> to tilt by approximately 18 degrees before it will touch {{the side of the}} casing. When this happens its freedom to rotate is lost and the compass becomes unreliable.|$|R
25|$|It {{is unknown}} whether {{the idea for}} the setting came from Graham or Hogarth, though Hogarth had already {{produced}} a similarly composed conversational piece for John Hervey, 2nd Baron Hervey, entitled Lord Hervey and His Friends. Hogarth reworked the concept for a naval setting, though he probably also drew inspiration from a 1732 painting by Bartolomeo Nazari. Nazari produced a similar cabin scene showing Lord Boyne and his companions during a voyage to Lisbon from Venice. A number of elements, such as the hanging <b>compass,</b> punch <b>bowl,</b> and the presence of animals, were included in Hogarth's work. Nazari's work had been popular, resulting in a large number of copies, and Hogarth knew Boyne, having painted his portrait.|$|R
50|$|Other {{innovations}} {{included the}} square-pallet bilge pump, which {{was adopted by}} the West during the 16th century for work ashore, the western chain pump, which was adopted for shipboard use, being of a different derivation. Junks also relied on the compass for navigational purposes. However, as with almost all vessels of any culture before the late 19th century, the accuracy of magnetic compasses aboard ship, whether from a failure to understand deviation (the magnetism of the ship's iron fastenings) or poor design of the compass card (the standard drypoint compasses were extremely unstable), meant that they did little to contribute to the accuracy of navigation by dead reckoning. Indeed, a review of the evidence shows that the Chinese embarked magnetic pointer was probably little used for navigation. The reasoning is simple. Chinese mariners were as able as any and, had they needed a compass to navigate, they would have been aware of the almost random directional qualities when used at sea of the water <b>bowl</b> <b>compass</b> they used. Yet that design remained unchanged for some half a millennium. Western sailors, coming upon a similar water bowl design (no evidence as to how has yet emerged) very rapidly adapted it in a series of significant changes such that within roughly a century the water bowl had given way to the dry pivot, a rotating compass card a century later, a lubberline a generation later and gimbals seventy or eight years later. These were necessary because in the more adverse climatic context of north western Europe, the compass was needed for navigation. Had similar needs been felt in China, Chinese mariners would also have come up with fixes. They didn't.|$|R
25|$|On September 13, 2010 BBVA {{became an}} {{official}} {{sponsor of the}} NBA. From 2011 to 2014, BBVA sponsored the Birmingham Bowl, a postseason college football game played in Birmingham, Alabama, during which time the game {{was known as the}} BBVA <b>Compass</b> <b>Bowl.</b> For the first three editions under the sponsorship contract, the game featured teams from the Big East Conference and Southeastern Conference. Following the 2013 split of the Big East along football lines, the former Big East berth was inherited by that conference's football-sponsoring offshoot, the American Athletic Conference. On May 12, 2012, BBVA Compass Stadium opened in downtown Houston, Texas. It was built as the home for the Houston Dynamo soccer team, and from its opening has also hosted the Texas Southern University football team. Since 2014, the stadium has also hosted home games of the Houston Dash, a team in the National Women's Soccer League that is owned and operated by the Dynamo.|$|E
500|$|The 2010 PapaJohns.com Bowl was {{the final}} game by that name. [...] Although Papa John's had an option to renew its {{sponsorship}} for two years, it decided not to because of rising costs. The company instead opted to refocus its marketing dollars on the NFL and its sponsorship of Louisville's home field, Papa John's Cardinal Stadium. The game's name changed to the BBVA <b>Compass</b> <b>Bowl</b> starting with the 2011 contest.

2500|$|Former Wildcat wide {{receiver}} and longtime assistant coach Joker Phillips was formally named head coach January 6, 2010 after Brooks' retirement. [...] Phillips took Kentucky to the BBVA <b>Compass</b> <b>Bowl</b> in Birmingham, Alabama {{in his first}} season as a head coach, losing to Big East Conference co-champion Pittsburgh 27-10. However, the Wildcats would not return to a bowl in either of the next two seasons. The main highlight of those years came in 2011, when Kentucky defeated Tennessee {{for the first time since}} 1984. Phillips was fired in November 2012, effective at season's end.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to joining Conference USA, SMU {{had only}} one winning season since {{returning}} from the [...] "death penalty", in 1997. In 2009, the Mustangs made their first bowl appearance since 1984, a 45-10 victory over Nevada in the Hawaii Bowl. They succeeded in winning the C-USA West Division in 2010, giving them their first shot at winning a conference since 1984, but they lost in the Conference USA Championship to UCF, 17-7. They did receive a second consecutive bowl bid, however. SMU was {{invited to participate in}} that year's Armed Forces Bowl to face Army in what amounted to another home game for SMU: because of construction at the game's primary site, Amon G. Carter Stadium in Fort Worth, the game was held at SMU's Gerald J. Ford Stadium. They would end losing this game despite playing it on home turf by a score of 16-14. In 2011, the Mustangs were invited to the BBVA <b>Compass</b> <b>Bowl</b> in Birmingham, Alabama—the first time they'd made three consecutive bowl appearances since the glory years of the early 1980s. The game was played on January 7, 2012, the first January bowl game for SMU since their appearance in the Cotton Bowl in 1983. By coincidence, they played Pittsburgh, the team they had defeated in that Cotton Bowl game, in the BBVA <b>Compass</b> <b>Bowl</b> and defeated them 28-6 for their second bowl win in three seasons. They moved to the American Athletic Conference in 2013.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the bowl}} win, Pitt {{announced}} Tulsa head coach Todd Graham {{as the new}} {{head coach of the}} Panthers. At his introductory press conference, Graham talked about how Pitt was a [...] "dream come true" [...] and that he would work hard every day to [...] "gain everyone's trust" [...] and that he would coach his players to do the same. Graham instituted a sweeping change of offensive and defensive philosophies but staggered to a 6–6 regular season. However, major news for the university was announced in September of that season when Pitt accepted an invitation to join the Atlantic Coast Conference effective [...] July 1, 2013. On December 14, 2011, less than one year after being hired, Graham shocked Pitt when he resigned to take the head coaching position at Arizona State. Defensive coordinator Keith Patterson was named as the interim head coach for the BBVA <b>Compass</b> <b>Bowl,</b> which the Panthers lost to Southern Methodist by a score of 28–6.|$|E
