25|$|Rayburn {{also had}} a knack for {{dressing}} to suit his occasion. While in Washington, D.C., he would sport expensive suits, starched shirts, and perfectly shined shoes. However, while back in his poorer district in Texas, Rayburn would wear simple shirts, blue jeans, cowboy boots, and cowboy hats. Several politicians have imitated this pattern, including Ronald Reagan's famous example of <b>clearing</b> <b>brush</b> when at home in California, while wearing fine suits in Washington.|$|E
25|$|The land {{transfer}} {{took place}} during the Great Depression. The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) was a work relief program for young men from unemployed families, established in 1933. As part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal legislation, it was designed to combat unemployment during the 1930s. The CCC operated in every U.S. state. The CCC had several camps in Alabama including one at Geneva State Forest. The young men of the CCC worked to revitalize the forests of Geneva County and southern Alabama. They did this by <b>clearing</b> <b>brush,</b> building access roads and hand planting thousands of tree seedlings.|$|E
500|$|Despite that speed, not {{everything}} {{went in the}} engineers' favor. Barnard's report indicates [...] "the sites of Fort... Stanton and others were entirely wooded, which, {{in conjunction with the}} broken character of the ground, has made the selection of sites frequently very embarrassing and the labor of preparing them very great." [...] The experience of surveying and preparing the site of Fort Stanton would serve the engineers well in the construction of future forts around Washington and in service to the Army of the Potomac. <b>Clearing</b> <b>brush</b> and forest away from the site of Fort Stanton allowed for clear fields of fire for the fort's cannon for several hundred yards in each direction, a technique that would be applied (and later used) to great effect at Fort Stevens.|$|E

500|$|Jean has himself {{admitted}} {{in an interview}} that The Simpsons is of [...] "liberal bent". In the DVD commentaries, creator Matt Groening and the majority of people who work on the show state several times that they are very liberal, but some, such as John Swartzwelder (the writer of this and many other The Simpsons episodes), are conservative. In his book The Really Inconvenient Truths: Seven Environmental Catastrophes Liberals Don't Want You to Know About- Because They Helped Cause Them, Iain Murray described [...] "The Frying Game" [...] as [...] "subversively conservative", and wrote that it shows [...] "The best popular explanation of the liberal environmentalist model for endangered species." [...] In the episode, Homer buys a koi pond for Marge, only to find a screamapillar has taken residence in their garden. When Homer tries to squash it, an EPA official tells him that allowing an endangered species to die is a federal offense, under the [...] "Reversal of Freedoms Act of 1994." [...] Homer is forced to coddle the screamapillar, and when he accidentally squashes it, Homer is found guilty of [...] "attempted insecticide and aggravated buggery." [...] The [...] "Reversal of Freedoms Act" [...] is a reference to the Endangered Species Act, an environmental law that Murray opined had [...] "indeed become the Reversal of Freedoms Act." [...] He continued, [...] "Landowners who happened to have threatened or endangered species on their lands or who simply have habitat that might be used by endangered species are routinely prevented from using their lands or property. They are stopped from undertaking such activities as harvesting their trees, grazing their cattle, irrigating their fields, <b>clearing</b> <b>brush</b> along fence lines, disking firebreaks around their homes and barns, or building new homes.|$|E

And I work cheaper than anyone I could hire to do it." [...] Selleck has also stated he dislikes avocados.|$|E

50|$|Agent Purple {{was used}} {{only in the}} {{earliest}} stages of the spraying program, between 1962 and 1965 {{as well as in}} earlier tests conducted by the US military outside of Vietnam. About 500,000 gallons were sprayed in Vietnam total. (~1.9 million liters). When the need to <b>clear</b> <b>brush</b> around CFB Gagetown in Canada arose, quantities of Agent Purple and Agent Orange were also sprayed there in a testing program during 1966 and 1967.|$|R
50|$|He founded KKGO (at {{first the}} call letters were KBCA) in 1959, on limited funds, helped greatly {{by the fact}} that he was able to buy a used FM {{transmitter}} for $1500 from a Michigan station which had gone off the air. The station's original antenna was built in a garage for $300. He <b>cleared</b> <b>brush</b> with a rented tractor on land that he rented from the U.S. Forest Service for $350 a year.|$|R
50|$|In the 1940s {{the roads}} that become Secondary Highways were only dirt trails. Farmers {{would have to}} use axes to <b>clear</b> the <b>brush</b> of the boreal forest from the road allowance, and use plows and {{machinery}} pulled by horses to maintain the roads and fill in low spots that filled with water during spring melt and summer rains. These were not all weather roads, there were no snow ploughs to keep the roads clear over the winter months, so in the 1950s the larger farm trucks could only make it through {{a few months of}} the year. By 1957, the road saw an application of gravel to the surface, and was graded. A formal surveying crew came through in 1963 to <b>clear</b> <b>brush</b> and mark the path of the highway which was constructed in 1964.|$|R
