40|$|Understanding <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> <b>passengers</b> 2 ̆ 7 loyalty has {{received}} growing research attention, given {{its potential to}} inform the long-term market management of a <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> service. However, the nature of <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> <b>passengers</b> 2 ̆ 7 loyalty is arguably yet to be fully understood concerning its relationship to passengers 2 ̆ 7 captivity and attitudes towards private car use, and their intentions to change their modal use. Hence questions remain largely unexplored that: Is <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> <b>passengers</b> 2 ̆ 7 loyalty {{a result of a}} preferred or constrained choice? And does their loyalty have the potential to encourage more sustainable transport modal use patterns? Drawing on the busway network in Brisbane, Australia, as the case study, this paper aims to broaden the research on <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> <b>passengers</b> 2 ̆ 7 loyalty by addressing these questions. Through developing a series of linear regression models, our findings highlight: (1) busway passengers were influenced by preferential (the experience of riding the busway service), moral (pro-environmental concerns) and constraint (cost of busway and car use) considerations; and (2) the potential of loyalty to alleviate busway passengers 2 ̆ 7 intentions to shift to private car use for their trip-making. Through these findings, a series of implications are developed with the potential for the improvement of busway service and travel demand management to encourage more sustainable transport especially within a highly motorised context.

Sc. in Eng., PhD Student, DTU Transport, mkl@transport. dtu. dk Knowledge about actual route choices for <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> <b>passengers</b> is important when assessing generated choice sets for route choice modelling. An objective measure of relevant routes in actual networks does not exist {{and assessment}} of the choice sets is often based on the experience {{and knowledge of the}} analyst. Route choices for car traffic have attracted a lot of attention in the research literature, but limited knowledge exists on the route choices of <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> <b>passengers</b> and the need for insight into these choices motivates the work described in the paper. This paper describes a method to collect data for <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> <b>passengers</b> by using internet and telephone interviews. The route choice questions are formulated and added to the existing Danish Travel Survey (Transportvaneundersøgelsen, TU) and tested in a pilot study at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU). Afterwards, the questions are implemented in the national TU survey and, since February 2009, more than 4, 000 route choices in public transportation have been collected. The method of collecting public route choices proves to be successful since it collects actual route choice data for a large number of travellers and it allows reproducing observed choices in a GIS network for choice set assessment purposes. ...|$|R

40|$|Direct {{observation}} of human behaviour {{is used in}} many disciplines. Ethnographic observation, a qualitative method, has been used successfully in <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> <b>passenger</b> studies. Structured observation is an unobtrusive method which can yield large amounts of quantitative data. This paper discusses structured observation as a research method with <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> <b>passengers.</b> Designing a structured observation study requires decisions about (1) sampling: what kinds of passengers to observe, what modes and routes, times of day, week, and season to conduct observations; (2) categories: what behaviours and factors to observe; (3) data collection: how will behaviours and other data be recorded; and (4) analysis and reporting. The paper compares and critiques four recent studies which used structured observations to examine passengers’ travel time activities: by Timmermans and Van der Waerden (2008); Ohmori and Harata (2008); Thomas (2009); {{and the author of}} this paper (Russell, In Press). One of the areas of practical difficulty is data collection. Observing seated passengers on a long train or ferry journey may be relatively easy, but the crowding and intense activity on a rush-hour bus make methodical data collection very challenging. A structured observation study of <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> <b>passengers</b> can only answer questions about manifest behaviour; it tells us nothing about motivations, feelings or attitudes. Those topics can only be deeply understood through non-observational research methods. But as well as providing extensive data, the experience of structured observation field work gives an excellent background to researchers wishing to understand the everyday experiences of passengers...|$|R
