60|$|Both tide {{and wind}} were dead against {{them as they}} issued from {{the shelter of the}} pier and met the storm, but the steamer was very powerful; it buffeted the billows bravely, and {{gradually}} gained the neighbourhood of the Sands, where the breakers and <b>cross</b> <b>seas</b> beat so furiously that their noise, mingled with the blast, created a din which {{can only be described as}} a prolonged and hideous roar.|$|E
60|$|All {{this time}} the {{lifeboat}} had been rushing, surging, and bounding {{in the wake of}} her steamer. The seas not only roared around her, but absolutely overwhelmed her. She was dragged violently over them, and sometimes right through them. Her crew crouched almost flat on the thwarts, and held on to prevent being washed overboard. The stout cable had to be let out to its full extent to prevent snapping, so that the mist and rain sometimes prevented her crew from seeing the steamer, while <b>cross</b> <b>seas</b> met and hurled her from side to side, causing her to plunge and kick like a wild horse.|$|E

40|$|This work {{presents}} a theoretical and experimental investigation on the statistical {{properties of the}} surface elevation in a special case of <b>crossing</b> <b>sea</b> conditions. The special case considered {{is the case of}} two irregular wave trains propagating in opposite directions, with the same characteristic frequency and wave number. The modulational instability of two crossing Stokes waves according to two coupled nonlinear Schrödinger equations describing the problem is investigated. Experiments are performed in the Hydrodynamic Laboratory at the University of Oslo, Blindern. The stability analysis shows that the unstable domain of the perturbation is reduced {{in the case of a}} <b>crossing</b> <b>sea</b> compared to a non-crossing sea, at the same time as the growth rates are reduced. Such behaviour is usually interpreted as an indication that the occurrence of extreme events is reduced. Experimental results show that the kurtosis, a measure of the probability of the occurrence of extreme events, is generally lower for <b>crossing</b> <b>sea</b> than non-crossing sea. Results of both the stability analysis and the experiments were in contradiction to the wide-spread mindset that <b>crossing</b> <b>sea</b> is more dangerous than non-crossing sea. The work presented in this thesis has demonstrated the need of further investigation, in order to fully understand the occurrence of freak waves in <b>crossing</b> <b>sea</b> with counterpropagating wave systems...|$|R

60|$|As they {{ploughed}} {{through the}} foam together, the tug was frequently obliged to ease-steam and give herself {{time to recover}} from the shock of those heavy <b>cross</b> <b>seas.</b> Suddenly a bright flaring light was observed in the vicinity of a shoal called the Break, which lies between the Goodwins and the shore. It went out in a few seconds, but not before the master of the tug had taken its bearings and altered his course. At the same time signal-guns and rockets were observed, both from the North sandhead light-vessel and the Gull, and several flaring lights were also seen burning on or near the Goodwin sands.|$|E

On the other hand, when he recalled his conversation with Pancks, and the little reason he had to suppose that there was any likelihood of that strange personage being on that track at all, there were times when he wondered that he made so much of it.

On passing the shelter of the pier-head the boat and her crew were met not only by the tumultuous surging of <b>cross</b> <b>seas,</b> but by a blast which caught the somewhat high bow and almost whirled them into the air; while in its now unbroken force the cold blast seemed to wither up the powers of the men. Then, in the dark distance, an unusually huge billow was seen rushing down on them. To meet it straight as an arrow and with all possible speed was essential. Failure here--and the boat, turning side on, would have been rolled over and swept back into the harbour, if not wrecked against the breakwater.|$|E

60|$|The caravel was now {{drifting}} at {{the mercy}} of the winds and waves, the term scudding being scarcely applicable to the motion of a vessel so low, and which was so perfectly sheltered from the action of the wind by the height of the billows. Had the latter possessed their ordinary regularity, the low vessel must have been pooped; but, in a measure, her exemption from this calamity was owing to an irregularity that was only the source of a new danger. Still, the Niña drove ahead, and that swiftly, though not with the velocity necessary to outstrip the chasing water, had the waves followed with their customary order and regularity. The <b>cross</b> <b>seas</b> defeated this; wave meeting wave, actually sending those crests, which otherwise would have rolled over in combing foam, upward in terrific jets d'eau.|$|E
60|$|In {{previous}} chapters enough {{has been}} told, I think, {{to prove that}} our lifeboats deserve earnest and thoughtful attention, not only as regards their work, but in reference to their details of construction. It {{has been said that}} the lifeboat possesses special qualities which distinguish it from all other boats. Chief among these are the self-righting and self-emptying principles. Stability, resulting from breadth of beam, etcetera, will do much to render a boat safe in rough seas and tempestuous weather, but when a boat has to face mighty rollers which turn it up until it stands straight on end, like a rearing horse, and even tumble it right over, or when it has to plunge into horrible maelstroms which seethe, leap, and fume in the mad contention of <b>cross</b> <b>seas,</b> no device that man has yet fallen upon will save it from turning keel up and throwing its contents into the water.|$|E
60|$|Under this {{soothing}} reflection I composed {{myself to}} slumber; and awoke, {{to my surprise}} and annoyance, in a miserable flutter of the nerves. And this fretfulness increased with the hours, so that from Amiens to the coast Mr. Romaine must have had the devil of a time with me. I bolted my meals at the way-houses, chafing all the while at {{the business of the}} relays. I popped {{up and down in the}} calèche like a shot on a hot shovel. I cursed our pace. I girded at the lawyer's snuff-box, and could have called him out upon Calais sands, when we reached them, to justify his vile methodical use of it. By good fortune we arrived to find the packet ready with her warps, and bundled ourselves on board in a hurry. We sought separate cabins for the night, and in mine, as in a sort of moral bath, the drastic <b>cross</b> <b>seas</b> of the Channel cleansed me of my irritable humour, and left me like a rag, beaten and hung on a clothes-line to the winds of heaven.|$|E
5000|$|In surface navigation, a <b>cross</b> <b>sea</b> is a {{sea state}} with two wave systems {{traveling}} at oblique angles. This may occur when water waves from one weather system continue despite {{a shift in}} wind. Waves generated by the new wind run {{at an angle to}} the old, creating a shifting, dangerous pattern. Two weather systems that are far from each other may create a <b>cross</b> <b>sea</b> when the waves from the systems meet, usually at a place far from either weather system. Until the older waves have dissipated, they create a sea hazard among the most perilous. This sea state is fairly common and a larger percentage of ship accidents were found to have occurred in this state.|$|R
40|$|Two coupled {{nonlinear}} equations {{are derived}} describing {{the evolution of}} two broader bandwidth surface gravity wave packets propagating in two different directions in deep water. The equations, being derived for broader bandwidth wave packets, are applicable to more realistic ocean wave spectra in <b>crossing</b> <b>sea</b> states. The two coupled evolution equations derived here {{have been used to}} investigate the instability of two uniform wave trains propagating in two different directions. We have shown in figures the behaviour of the growth rate of instability of these uniform wave trains for unidirectional as well as for bidirectional perturbations. The figures drawn here confirm the fact that modulational instability in <b>crossing</b> <b>sea</b> states with broader bandwidth wave packets can lead to the formation of freak waves...|$|R

On our return northwards we landed upon Nu'mán, whose name derives from the red-flowered Euphorbia retusa; bathed, despite the school of sharks occupying the waters around; collected botany, and examined the ground carefully. Like the Dalmatian Archipelago, it once formed part of the mainland, probably separated by the process that raised {{the maritime}} range. The rolling sandy plateau and the dwarf Wadys are strewed with trap and quartz, neither of which could have been generated by the new sandstones and the yellow corallines. It has two fine bays, facing the shore and admirably defended from all winds; the southern not a little resembles Sináfir-cove.|$|E

40|$|The Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) onboard the European Satellite ERS- 2 is {{operated}} in wave mode over the global oceans, whenever no image mode data acquisition is requested. In {{the scope of}} the Wave Atlas Project, ESA provided a two-year wave mode dataset of ERS- 2 SAR raw data mainly collected during 1999 and 2000, which was reprocessed to single-look-complex (SLC) imagettes at DLR using the BSAR processor. The processed dataset contains daily between 1300 and 1500 images of 5 km (azimuth direction) by 10 km (range direction) size acquired over the global ocean. In the present paper new algorithms to derive sea state developed at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) are briefly introduced and used to determine SAR derived individual and spectral sea state parameters. As an example, a severe North Pacific storm, which produced significant wave height (SWH) above 10 m along the northern great circle shipping route, is presented.
