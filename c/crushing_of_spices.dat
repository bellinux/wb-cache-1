The academic spinoffs <b>of</b> <b>SPICE</b> include XSPICE, developed at Georgia Tech, which added mixed analog/digital [...] "code models" [...] for behavioral simulation, and Cider (previously CODECS, from UC Berkeley/Oregon State Univ.) which added semiconductor device simulation. The integrated circuit industry adopted SPICE quickly, and until commercial versions became well developed many IC design houses had proprietary versions <b>of</b> <b>SPICE.</b>|$|R

40|$|Bee honey is nutritious and has {{numerous}} health benefits, but its {{taste is}} {{for many people}} too bland. Honey with addition <b>of</b> <b>spices</b> could be important to the food industry as a functional product with positive health image and interesting taste. Such product would definitely meet health-driven consumers’ expectations. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was to evaluate the effect of addition <b>of</b> selected <b>spices</b> on sensory, antimicrobial, and antioxidant properties of honey. Results showed that the addition <b>of</b> <b>spices</b> significantly affected the taste and the smell of honey (p< 0, 05) and that honey with the cinnamon was the most desired and easily accepted product by the consumers. The addition <b>of</b> <b>spices</b> had no significant effect on texture and appearance. All tested samples showed the ability to inhibit the growth of bacteria and, contrary to the assumptions, the addition <b>of</b> <b>spices</b> did not cause an increase of antimicrobial activity. The results also showed that the kind and amount <b>of</b> added <b>spice</b> significantly affected the antioxidant activity: ability to scavenge free radicals and total phenolics content. The highest antioxidant activity revealed the honey with cinnamon and the lowest revealed the honey with cardamom addition...|$|R
