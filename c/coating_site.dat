We present the bench scale study that was conducted to select the most appropriate oxidant. Ozone and catalyzed hydrogen peroxide (Fenton's reaction) were discarded since they were incompatible with plant activity. Permanganate, activated percarbonate and activated persulfate were tested. Batch experiments were run with groundwater and groundwater-chalk slurries with these three oxidants. Total BTEX degradation in groundwater was reached with all the oxidants. The molar ratios [oxidant]:[Fe(2 +) ]:[BTEX] were 100 : 0 : 1 with permanganate, 100 : 100 : 1 with persulfate and 25 : 100 : 1 with percarbonate. Precipitation of either manganese dioxide or iron carbonate (siderite) occurred. The best results with chalk slurries were obtained with permanganate at the molar ratio 110 : 0 : 1 and activated persulfate at the molar ratio 110 : 110 : 1. To avoid precipitation, persulfate was also used without activation at the molar ratio 140 : 1. Natural Oxidant Demand measured with both oxidants was lower than 5 % of initial oxidant contents. Activated percarbonate was not appropriate because of radical scavenging by carbonated media. Permanganate and persulfate were both effective at oxidant concentrations of ca 1 g kg(- 1) with permanganate and 1. 8 g kg(- 1) with persulfate and adapted to site conditions. Activation of persulfate was not mandatory. This bench scale study proved that ISCO remediation of a chalky aquifer contaminated by mainly xylenes was possible with permanganate and activated or unactivated persulfate...|$|E

This coating has been developed to overcome the shortcomings, such as implant loosening and lack of adherence, of uncoated titanium implant. An electrophoretic deposition technique was used to coat apatite-wollastonite/chitosan on titanium implants. The present study was designed to evaluate the bone response of coated as compared to uncoated titanium implants in an animal model. After an implantation period of 14 (group A), 21 (group B), 35 (group Q and 42 days (group D), the bone-implant interfaces and defect site healing was evaluated using radiography, scintigraphy, histopathology, fluorescence labeling and haematology. Radiography of defect <b>sites</b> treated with <b>coated</b> implants suggested expedited healing. Scintigraphy of <b>coated</b> implant <b>sites</b> indicated faster bone metabolism than uncoated implant sites. Histopathological examination and fluorescence labeling of bone from <b>coated</b> implant <b>sites</b> revealed higher osteoblastic activity and faster mineralization. Faster bone healing in the case of <b>coated</b> implant <b>sites</b> is attributed to higher cell adhesion on electrostatically charged chitosan surfaces and apatite-wollastonite-assisted mineralization at bone-implant interfaces. Haernatological studies showed no significant differences in haemoglobin, total erythrocyte and leukocyte counts, done using one way-ANOVA, during the entire study period. Our results show that AW/chitosan-coated implants have the advantages of faster bone healing, increased mechanical strength and good bone-implant bonding...|$|R

40|$|Conductive polymer {{coatings}} {{can be used}} {{to modify}} traditional electrode recording sites with the intent of improving the long-term performance of cortical microelectrodes. Conductive polymers can drastically decrease recording site impedance, which in turn is hypothesized to reduce thermal noise and signal loss through shunt pathways. Moreover, conductive polymers can be seeded with agents aimed at promoting neural growth toward the recording sites or minimizing the inherent immune response. The end goal of these efforts is to generate an ideal long-term interface between the recording electrode and surrounding tissue. The goal {{of this study was to}} refine a method to electrochemically deposit surfactant-templated ordered poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) films on the recording sites of standard ‘Michigan’ probes and to evaluate the efficacy of these modified sites in recording chronic neural activity. PEDOT-coated site performance was compared to control sites over a six-week evaluation period in terms of impedance spectroscopy, signal-to-noise ratio, number of viable unit potentials recorded and local field potential recordings. PEDOT sites were found to outperform control sites with respect to signal-to-noise ratio and number of viable unit potentials. The benefit of reduced initial impedance, however, was mitigated by the impedance contribution of typical silicon electrode encapsulation. <b>Coating</b> <b>sites</b> with PEDOT also reduced the amount of low-frequency drift evident in local field potential recordings.

The product of synthesis consists of discrete DNA fractions of different length, including transcripts longer than 1, 000 nucleotides. The coat protein inhibits DNA synthesis if it is initiated at its binding site, but has no effect on DNA synthesis initiated at the coat protein cistron. It has been suggested that, in this system, the initiation of DNA synthesis by synthetic primers is topographically specific. The MS 2 <b>coat</b> protein binding <b>site</b> (an RNA fragment of 59 nucleotides) serves as a template for polydeoxyribonucleotide synthesis in the presence of octanucleotide primer and reverse transcriptase. The product of synthesis is homogenous and its length corresponds to the length of the template.

40|$|BACKGROUND: A new {{technique}} to deposit calcium phosphate (CaP) coatings onto titanium substrates {{has been developed}} recently. This electrostatic spray deposition (ESD) technique {{seems to be very}} promising. It appears to have clinical advantages such as an inexpensive and simple set-up, high deposition efficiency and the possibility to synthesize layers with a defined surface morphology. OBJECTIVE: The aim {{of this study was to}} examine biological properties and osteoconductivity of ESD CaP coatings when inserted into the femoral condyle of a goat. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-four implants with two gaps, i. e. 1 or 2 mm, were inserted into the femoral condyles of six goats. The implants were coated on one side with either a commercially available plasma-sprayed hydroxyapatite (HAPS) coating or an ESD carbonate apatite (CAESD) coating. The other side of the implant was always left uncoated (Ti). Twelve weeks after implantation the animals were sacrificed and the characteristics of bone ingrowth and bone contact were evaluated. Results: At 3 months, histological and quantitative histomorphometrical measurements demonstrated more bone ingrowth and bone contact for <b>coated</b> <b>sites</b> as compared with uncoated sites. Statistical testing revealed that for both the 1 and 2 mm gaps HAPS (plasma-sprayed hydroxyapatite) as well as CAESD (ESD carbonate apatite) -coated surfaces always had a significantly higher (P< 0. 05) amount of bone contact than uncoated Ti surfaces. On HAPS surfaces always significantly more bone was present than on CAESD surfaces. Further statistical testing revealed a significant difference in bone ingrowth between the HAPS as well as CAESD and Ti 1 + 2 mm gap specimens (P< 0. 05). Further, HAPS 1 mm gaps showed more bone ingrowth than CAESD 1 mm gaps. No significant difference existed between HAPS and CAESD 2 mm gaps. CONCLUSION: On the basis of our observations, we conclude that the used ESD technique is a promising new method to deposit CaP coatings onto titanium substrates. On the other hand, plasma-spray HA-coated implants have a still more favourable effect on the bone response...|$|R

Transcriptome analysis of par mutants and MtPAR-expressing hairy roots, coupled with yeast one-hybrid analysis, revealed that MtPAR positively regulates genes encoding enzymes of the flavonoid–PA pathway via a probable activation of WD 40 - 1.

Althoughmany {{studies have}} been done on seeds with {{physical}} dormancy, i. e. water-impermeable seed or fruit <b>coat,</b> theprimary <b>site</b> ofwater entry into seeds after dormancy-breaking treatments is still controversial. In thiswork, the role of the lens in physical dormancy breaking was examined. The present study investigated the primary site of water entry and changes in seed-surface features for seeds of Sophora alopecuroides L. following various periods of scarification with sulfuric acid, hot-water treatments, and exposure to field conditions. Most seed coats first cracked in the hilumwhenpre-treatedwith sulfuric acid and after field exposure, but they cracked in both the hilumand extrahilar regionswhen treatedwith hotwater. After pre-treatment, seeds first became slowly permeable in the hilum or extrahilar region and not in the lens. Acid scarification for 35 or 50 min caused the lens to crack, thus causing seeds to enter a fast imbibition stage. Seeds exposed to field conditions had further damage to the hilum, causing them to enter a fast imbibition stage. Imbibition time is a keypoint that determines theprimary site ofwater entry into seed, and at least inpart explains various results and interpretations {{about the role of the}} lens in physical dormancy in previous research...|$|R

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the performance and}} durability of solar reflector surfaces in the atomic oxygen environment typical of low Earth orbit (LEO), one must expose the reflector surface either directly to LEO or to ground-laboratory atomic oxygen environments. Although actual LEO exposures are most desired, such opportunities are typically scarce, expensive, and of limited duration. As a result, ground-laboratory exposures must be relied upon as the most practical long-term durability evaluation technique. Plasma ashers are widely used as LEO simulation facilities by producing atomic oxygen environments for durability evaluation of potential spacecraft materials. Atomic oxygen arrival differs between ground and space exposure in that plasma asher exposure produces isotropic arrival and space solar tracking produces sweeping arrival. Differences in initial impact reaction probability occur, dependent upon the energy and species existing in these environments. Due to the variations in ground-laboratory and space atomic oxygen, quantification of in-space performance based on plasma asher testing is not straightforward.

We have identified the integral membrane protein Mst 27 p as a strong suppressor of sec 21 - 3 and ret 1 - 1 mutants.

The transport of these proteins requires the localization and activity of proteins that create ER exit <b>sites,</b> <b>coat</b> proteins to collect cargo and {{to reshape the}} membrane into a transport container, and address labels-SNARE proteins-to target the vesicles specifically to the Golgi apparatus. In addition some proteins may need export chaperones or export receptors to enable their exit into transport vesicles. ER export factors, SNAREs, and misfolded Golgi-resident proteins must all be retrieved from the Golgi to the ER again. This retrieval {{is also part of}} the organellar homeostasis pathway essential to maintaining the identity of the ER and of the Golgi apparatus. In this review, I will discuss the different processes in retrograde transport from the Golgi to the ER and highlight the mechanistic insights we have obtained {{in the last couple of}} years...|$|R
40|$|The {{durability}} {{and maintenance of}} pavements depend on several factors. One {{of the most influential}} is the bond between layers. This bond is responsible for ensuring all layers behave as a single entity, reducing cracks and deformation of the pavement. Several methods, developed by different authors over the past 30 years, to measure bonding between layers are analyzed in this paper. Different research lines are discussed, concluding that the most influential variables are: tack coat type, dosage, mixture type, surface characteristics, temperature, and emulsion breaking time. In order to reach the highest bond strength values, the following factors should be considered: high values of surface macro-texture, low temperatures, the use of heat-adhesive emulsion, a dosage from 300 to 450 g/m 2 of residual bitumen and the compaction after emulsion break. Moreover, a non-destructive test method to assess tack <b>coat</b> dosage on <b>site</b> is proposed...|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} {{of research on}} magnetic nanoparticles has focused on optical, electrical, and magnetic storage areas. Recently, the application of magnetic nanoparticles as magnetically separable nanovehicles for chemical or biological species has become an area of intensive research but with rather different challenging criteria that are yet to be addressed. For example, the enhancement of intrinsically weak magnetic properties, avoidance of magnetic interactions among particles, and improvement of {{the stability of the}} nanoparticles remain key issues. Here, it is demonstrated using sequential nanochemistry preparation techniques that exchange-coupled nanomagnets, such as FePt-Fe 3 Pt or FePt-Fe 3 O 4 with dramatically enhanced magnetization, can be placed inside a silica nanosphere. The advantages of enhanced magnetization and the provision of protective <b>coating</b> and anchored <b>sites</b> on the silica shell surface render these new coated particles suitable for use in magnetic separation. © 2007 American Chemical Society...|$|R
40|$|The {{coat protein}} of {{bacteriophage}} GA, a group II RNA phage, binds {{to a small}} RNA hairpin corresponding to its replicase operator. Binding is specific, with a Ka of 71 microM - 1. This interaction differs kinetically from the analogous coat protein-RNA hairpin interactions of other RNA phage and also deviates somewhat in its pH and salt dependence. Despite 46 of 129 amino acid differences between the GA and group I phage R 17 coat proteins, the binding sites are fairly similar. The essential features of the GA <b>coat</b> protein binding <b>site</b> are a based-paired stem with an unpaired purine and a four nucleotide loop having an A at position - 4 and a purine at - 7. Unlike the group I phage proteins, the GA coat protein does not distinguish between two alternate positions for the unpaired purine and does not show high specificity for a pyrimidine at position - 5 of the loop...|$|R
40|$|The {{decision}} between lytic and lysogenic {{development of}} temperate DNA bacteriophages is determined largely by transcriptional regulation through DNA-binding proteins. To {{determine whether a}} heterologous RNA-binding activity could control the developmental fate of a DNA bacteriophage, a derivative of P 22 was constructed in which the chosen developmental pathway is regulated by an RNA-binding molecule interacting with its RNA target site located in a phage mRNA. In the example presented, lysogenic development of the phage relies upon R 17 coat protein expression in the susceptible host cell {{and the availability of}} a suitable <b>coat</b> protein binding <b>site</b> encoded by the phage genome. Through the analysis of phage mutants that are able to grow lytically in susceptible cells that express the coat protein, additional insights were obtained regarding the specific interaction of the R 17 coat protein with its RNA binding site. This study also suggests a novel and extremely sensitive strategy for selecting RNA-binding activities in vivo...|$|R
