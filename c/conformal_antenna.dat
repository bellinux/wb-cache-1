50|$|A <b>conformal</b> <b>antenna</b> is a {{phased array}} {{in which the}} {{individual}} antennas, instead of being arranged in a flat plane, are mounted on a curved surface. The phase shifters compensate for the different path lengths of the waves due to the antenna elements' varying position on the surface, allowing the array to radiate a plane wave. Conformal antennas are used in aircraft and missiles, to integrate the antenna into the curving surface of the aircraft to reduce aerodynamic drag.|$|E
50|$|In a {{conventional}} phased array the individual antenna elements are {{mounted on a}} flat surface. In a <b>conformal</b> <b>antenna,</b> they are mounted on a curved surface, and the phase shifters also compensate for the different phase shifts caused by the varying path lengths of the radio waves due {{to the location of}} the individual antennas on the curved surface. Because the individual antenna elements must be small, conformal arrays are typically limited to high frequencies in the UHF or microwave range, where the wavelength of the waves is small enough that small antennas can be used.|$|E

50|$|Boeing's {{strategy}} for {{a competitive advantage}} was to offer substantially lower manufacturing and life-cycle costs by minimizing variations between the different JSF versions. The X-32 therefore was designed around a large one piece carbon fiber composite delta wing. The wing had a span of 9.15 meters, with a 55-degree leading edge sweep and could hold up to 20,000 pounds of fuel. The purpose of the high sweep angle was {{to allow for a}} thick wing section to be used while still providing limited transonic aerodynamic drag, and to provide a good angle for wing-installed <b>conformal</b> <b>antenna</b> equipment.

50|$|The folded {{inverted}} <b>conformal</b> <b>antenna</b> (FICA) {{belongs to}} the microstrip antenna family. The FICA placement on the handset board and its feeding mechanisms {{are similar to those}} used currently for the great majority of handsets with internal planar inverted-F antenna (PIFA) components. Whereas multiband PIFAs exhibit two resonant modes, which operate by sharing the same available antenna volume, the FICA structure is synthesised in order to sustain three resonant modes that better reuse the volume. The implementation of volume reuse allows spreading of the reactive electromagnetic energy associated with each resonant mode across the entire antenna volume. This results in FICA modes exhibiting a lower Q factor and a wider fractional bandwidth than the corresponding PIFA modes.|$|E
5000|$|In radio {{communication}} and avionics a <b>conformal</b> <b>antenna</b> or conformal array is a flat radio antenna {{which is designed}} to conform or follow some prescribed shape, [...] for example a flat curving antenna which is mounted on or embedded in a curved surface.

As the cost of the required processing technology comes down, they are being considered for use in civilian applications such as train antennas, car radio antennas, and cellular base station antennas, to save space and also to make the antenna less visually intrusive by integrating it into existing objects.|$|E

40|$|<b>Conformal</b> <b>antennas</b> and antenna arrays (arrays) {{have become}} {{necessary}} for vehicular communications where {{a high degree}} of aerodynamic drag reduction is needed, like in avionics and ships. However, the necessity to conform to a predefined shape (e. g., of an aircraft’s nose) directly affects antenna performance since it imposes strict constraints to the antenna array’s shape, element spacing, relative signal phase, and so forth. Thereupon, it is necessary to investigate counterintuitive and arbitrary antenna shapes in order to compensate for these constraints. Since there does not exist any available theoretical frame for designing and developing arbitrary-shape antennas in a straightforward manner, we have developed a platform combining a genetic algorithm-based design, optimization suite, and an electromagnetic simulator for designing patch antennas with a shape that is not a priori known (the genetic algorithm optimizes the shape of the patch antenna).

40|$|Spiral antennas have a {{wide range}} of {{applications}} in communications because they are circularly polarized with broadband characteristics with respect to both input impedance and radiation pattern. However, a spiral <b>antenna</b> that is <b>conformal</b> to a multilayered cylindrical media has not been reported in earlier studies. This thesis presents in depth analysis of such antennas using a full wave Method of Moments model. There are two crucial issues involved in such model: developing efficient spatial domain Green's function expressions, and then linking the Green's functions with the Method of Moments. An efficient algorithm to compute Dyadic Green's functions in stratified cylindrical media has been developed firstly. The convergences of the Green's functions have been greatly accelerated by employing a single asymptotic extraction in the spectral domain and the counterparts of those subtracted components in the spatial domain have been derived into compact closed-forms. On the other hand, two different methods to link the Green's functions and Method of Moments have been developed: look-up-tables and segment based approach. The look-up-table approach is efficient for modeling <b>conformal</b> <b>antennas,</b> while the segment based approach is especially suitable to model <b>conformal</b> <b>antennas</b> with a probe feed. The whole method has been validated by comparing computed results with those from CST or equivalent planar geometries.
