Green birefringence under polarized light was used for evaluation of {{the average number of}} senile plaques and cross-sectional vessel profiles containing amyloid in five fields per slide, at a magnification of X 100. Fields were selected that had large numbers of neurofibrillary tangles, also counted on the basis of green birefringence. The vascular involvement by amyloid was expressed as the ratio of amyloid positive to amyloid negative profiles. A negative correlation was found between Congophilic plaques or tangles {{on the one hand and}} vascular amyloid content on the other. In other words, cases with large numbers of Congophilic plaques had fewer Congophilic vessels, and vice versa: congophilic plaques = - 3 (vessel amyloid) + 2. 2, Spearman correlation coefficient, - 0. 61, P less than 0. 01; tangles = - 3. 7 (vessel amyloid) + 15. 6, Spearman correlation coefficient, - 0. 05, P greater than 0. 05. When the slides were reexamined, using only fields with at least one Congophilic vessel, the negative correlation for plaque versus vessel amyloid remained highly significant, whereas that for tangles versus vessel amyloid became highly significant: Congophilic plaques = - 1. 2 (vessel amyloid) + 2. 3, Spearman correlation coefficient, - 0. 48, P less than 0. 01; tangles = - 5 (vessel amyloid) + 19, Spearman correlation coefficient, - 0. 48, P less than 0. 01.

However, there are also significant problems with frequentism, particularly its inability to assign probability scores to single events. Popper thus proposed an alternative objectivist view of probability, called propensity theory, which he allies to a theory of corroboration; but this too has significant problems, in particular, it may not successfully avoid induction.

A sample preparation method that enables high reproducibility and throughput is key in reliably identifying proteins present or proteins responding to conditions such as a diet, health or genetics. Using skim milk samples from Jersey and Holstein-Friesian cows, we compared three extraction procedures which have not previously been applied to samples of cows’ milk. Method A (urea) involved a simple dilution of the milk in a urea-based buffer, method B (TCA/acetone) involved a trichloroacetic acid (TCA) /acetone precipitation and method C (methanol/chloroform) involved a tri-phasic partition method in chloroform/methanol solution. Protein assays, SDS-PAGE profiling, and trypsin digestion followed by nanoHPLC-electrospray ionisation-tandem mass spectrometry (nLC-ESI-MS/MS) analyses were performed to assess their efficiency.

In the absence of insecticides, both predators exhibited a type II functional response when feeding on eggs of the moth Ephestia kuehniella. N. tenuis seems to be a more efficient predator than M. pygmaeus, as model estimated handling time was significantly lower for the former than for the latter.
