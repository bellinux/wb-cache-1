His first trip outside Nigeria {{was an opportunity to}} advance his technical production skills, and to solicit feedback on his novel (which was later split into two books). In London, he met a novelist named Gilbert Phelps, to whom he offered the manuscript. Phelps responded with great enthusiasm, asking Achebe if he <b>could</b> <b>show</b> it to his editor and publishers. Achebe declined, insisting that it needed more work.|$|E

5|$|Although {{originally}} developed mainly for Western riding and stock uses, {{it has also}} been seen competing in endurance riding, three-day eventing, show hunter, and driving. It jumps well, and can be used for dressage. Originally, breed club shows did not allow people over the age of 16 to show POAs under saddle; adults could, however, show them in halter or driving classes. In 1973, the age limit for riders was raised to 18, and in 1987 it was decided that adults 19 and over <b>could</b> <b>show</b> horses two to four years old under saddle.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of Rivens development, {{publisher}} Brøderbund was facing falling revenues as development costs rose. Two years into the project, Cyan still had nothing they <b>could</b> <b>show</b> them. Brøderbund's stock dropped from $60 a share to $22 in 1996, because of a delay in the publishing of Riven. The plan had been to ship the game {{in time for the}} 1996 holiday season; Riven was finally published on October 29, 1997. Even though Rivens sales were expected to be higher than any other game that holiday season, Brøderbund launched a $10million marketing campaign and developed a retail marketing partnership with Toshiba America. Anticipation for the game was high even among non-gamers, helped by web-based word of mouth and well-placed media coverage.|$|E

The property was to be sold and invested until the sum of $25,000.00 was raised to fund {{a home for the}} poor and destitute.

5|$|Of {{particular}} emphasis was the children's fascination with Maurice Richard. Montreal's star player from 1942 until 1960, Richard was a prolific goal scorer. In the 1944–45 season– {{one year before}} the events of The Hockey Sweater– Richard became the first player in National Hockey League history to score 50 goals in a 50-game season. Richard attended the 1980 premiere of The Sweater in Montreal, and according to Carrier, was moved to tears by the film. Richard also requested copies so that he <b>could</b> <b>show</b> it to his own children.|$|E
5|$|Powell Clayton, a 35-year-old former Brigadier General in the Union Army who {{remained}} in Arkansas after marrying an Arkansas woman, was elected governor as a Republican in April, 1868. The election was scarred with irregularities. For example, the return of votes in Pulaski County exceeded the number of registered voters. Also, the registrars, who controlled the distribution of ballots, admitted that they had given ballots to voters from other counties if they <b>could</b> <b>show</b> a valid registration certificate. Both sides claimed election fraud and voter intimidation: armed parties had been stationed on roads to keep voters away from the polls. General Gillem, commander of the military district that included Arkansas, wrote to General Grant {{that it would take}} months to sort out which side had committed the greater election fraud.|$|E

5|$|In November 2008, after Sakurai {{was given}} the go-ahead to develop Uprising, he rented out an office in Takadanobaba, a {{district}} of Tokyo. At this stage, due to the game's platform still being in early development, there were no development tools available for Sakurai to use. Between November and March 2009, Sakurai finalized his vision for the game. During this period, to help design the game's settings and characters, Sakurai hired several outside illustrators to work on concept art: these artists were Toshio Noguchi, Akifumi Yamamoto and Masaki Hirooka. The art style was inspired by manga. In January 2009, development studio Project Sora was established for Uprisings development. At its inception, it had a staff of 30. With the start of active recruitment in March 2009, the game officially entered development: at the time, {{it was the very}} first game to be in development for the new platform. During this early stage, {{due to the lack of}} platform specific development tools, the team were developing the game on Wii hardware and personal computers. The changing specifications of the developing hardware resulted in multiple features undergoing major revisions. This hardware instability led to a protracted development cycle: in the event, the team managed to fully utilize the platform's capabilities, doing detailed work on how many enemies they <b>could</b> <b>show</b> on the screen at any one time. Debugging also took a long time due to the size and variability of gameplay built into Uprising.|$|E
5|$|Old-style serif typefaces by Garamond and {{his colleagues}} finally fell out of use {{altogether}} {{with the arrival of}} what is now called the Didone style of printing in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, promoted by the Didot family in France and others. This favoured a much more geometric, constructed style of letter which <b>could</b> <b>show</b> off the increasingly refined paper and printing technologies of the period. Mosley comments: The upheavals of the Revolution coincided with the major shift in the style of printing types that is associated with the family of Didot, and the stock of old materials abruptly lost its value, except as scrap. Punches rust, and the copper of matrices is recyclable. All traces of the early types that had been {{in the hands of the}} trade typefounders like Le Bé, Sanlecque and Lamesle in Paris vanished completely. No relics of them were saved anywhere, except in commercial centres that had become relative backwaters, like Antwerp, where the Plantin-Moretus printing office piously preserved the collection of its founder... the term caractères de l'Université became attached by default to the set of apparently early matrices that had survived, its provenance forgotten, in the mixed stock of materials of the national printing-office.|$|E

5|$|There {{were now}} four {{possible}} actions for theft, by the victim: the action furti itself and three complementary actions. The actio furti concepti was available against the occupier {{of the building}} in which the stolen goods were found, regardless of his knowledge of them and brought three-times damages. The actio furti prohibiti could be pursued against anyone who declined a search with witnesses, with four-times damages. The actio furti non exhibiti could be brought if the respondent did not bring the thing to court, although its penalty is unclear. There was a further action available to the respondent of an actio furti concepti who had been found liable: he could sue the person who gave it to him, for {{the extent of his}} own liability. That the victim could sue both the thief and handler, if he <b>could</b> <b>show</b> who the thief was, which would have difficult without the presence of the thing. This was both penal, and an attempt to give the plaintiff enough actions to compensate him, because the thief, at least was not usually solvent.|$|E
5|$|While visiting Nintendo {{for other}} work, celebrity {{copywriter}} Shigesato Itoi pitched to the company's lead designer Shigeru Miyamoto, his {{idea for a}} role-playing game set in contemporary times. The modern setting worked against role-playing genre norms, and while Miyamoto liked the idea, he was hesitant until Itoi <b>could</b> <b>show</b> full commitment to the project. Itoi reduced his workload, formed a team, and began development in Ichikawa, Chiba. Nintendo tried to accommodate Itoi's ideal work environment to feel more like an extracurricular club of volunteers. Itoi wrote the game's script. Mother was developed by Ape, published by Nintendo, and released in Japan on July 27, 1989 for the Famicom (known as the Nintendo Entertainment System outside Japan). The game was slated for an English-language localization as Earth Bound, but was abandoned when the team chose to localize Mother 2 instead. Years later, the complete localization was recovered by the public and distributed on the Internet, where it became known as EarthBound Zero. Mother received its English language debut in June 2015 as EarthBound Beginnings for the Wii U Virtual Console.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} the fermentation and purification of two dehydrins {{as well as with}} their functions. The focus is on analyzing the function of DH 10, also known as LTI 29 or ERD 10. It <b>could</b> be <b>shown</b> that the dehydrin DH 10 is a membrane-protective protein. It protects thylakoid membranes against both, freezing damage and the influence of high salt concentrations. It could be demonstrated that DH 10 avoids the precipitation of calcium sulfate crystals and changes their shape. Moreover, a thermal hysteresis, which is increased by high salt concentrations, <b>could</b> be <b>shown.</b> For the dehydrin Rab 18, a membrane protective function from high salt concentrations <b>could</b> be <b>shown</b> as well. The effect was less distinctive than with DH 10. Rab 18 showed no cryoprotective activity...|$|R
