The scattering medium for the shower is considered to be the spectrum of low energy photons originating from the inner region of the disk. It is found that at completion of the cascade, power-law energy spectra of relativistic electrons and positrons and of gamma-rays emerge under appropriate conditions.

40|$|Bremsstrahlung photon beams {{produced}} by medical linear accelerators are currently {{the most commonly}} used method of radiation therapy for cancerous tumors. Photons with energies greater than 8 - 10 MeV potentially generate neutrons through photonuclear interactions in the accelerator's treatment head, patient's body, and treatment room ambient. Electrons impinging on a heavy target generate a <b>cascade</b> <b>shower</b> of bremsstrahlung photons, the energy spectrum of which shows an end point equal to the electron beam energy. By varying the target thickness, an optimum thickness exists for which, at the given electron energy, maximum photon flux is achievable.
