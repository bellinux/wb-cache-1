40|$|A {{review of}} {{literature}} on {{the area of the}} behaviour of thin-walled coldformed steel structural members was carried out with an emphasis on the phenomenon of web <b>crippling</b> of beam members. Web <b>crippling</b> is a common mode of failure experienced by web elements of thin-walled beams under concentrated loads or reactions. Most of the studies done on web <b>crippling</b> behaviour are experimental and based on compression testing of beams to determine the ultimate web <b>crippling</b> strength. It has been identified that the theoretical investigation of web <b>crippling</b> behaviour is rather complicated due to localised collapse behaviour. However, some {{attempts have been made to}} develop theoretically based models to predict web <b>crippling</b> behaviour, and to obtain better understanding of the failure modes. Different theoretical studies, especially on elastic and plastic behaviour of plate elements were investigated with the intention of developing an analytical model to describe web <b>crippling</b> behaviour. It was found that almost all of the design codes around the world make design recommendations to predict the load at which web <b>crippling</b> would occur, based on equations obtained from web <b>crippling</b> tests conducted by various researchers...|$|R
40|$|Lipped channel beams (LCBs) are {{commonly}} used as floor joists and bearers in the construction industry. These thin-walled LCBs are subjected to specific local and global failures, one of them being web <b>crippling.</b> Several experimental and numerical {{studies have been conducted}} in the past to study the web <b>crippling</b> behaviour and capacities of different cold-formed steel sections under different concentrated load cases. However, {{due to the nature of}} the web <b>crippling</b> phenomenon and many factors influencing the web <b>crippling</b> capacities, capacity predictions given by most of the cold-formed steel design standards are either unconservative or conservative. Therefore a detailed experimental study was conducted to study the web <b>crippling</b> under End Two-Flange (ETF) and Interior Two-Flange (ITF) load cases based on the new AISI S 909 standard web <b>crippling</b> test method [1]. Finite element models were developed and validated using the test results. These models were then used in a detailed parametric study to investigate the web <b>crippling</b> capacities of a wide range of LCB sections including different sectional geometric parameters such as section depth, inside bent radius, thickness and bearing length. This paper presents the details of the numerical study of LCBs subject to web <b>crippling</b> under ETF and ITF load cases. Using the extensive web <b>crippling</b> capacity data obtained from both numerical and experimental studies, improved unified web <b>crippling</b> design equations were developed. Suitable web <b>crippling</b> design rules were also developed under the direct strength method format...|$|R
40|$|Web <b>crippling</b> is {{a common}} failure mode in cold formed sections. Interaction between bending and web <b>crippling</b> reduces the load {{carrying}} capacity and may control the design. In this research, numerical study on web <b>crippling</b> and interaction between bending and web <b>crippling</b> are performed considering the material and geometric nonlinearities. The study is performed on channel sections subjected to web <b>crippling</b> under interior one flange (IOF) loading conditions. Finite element models are verified against experimental tests, and then extended to predict the web <b>crippling</b> strength of the studied channel sections. FE is used to investigate the interaction between bending and web <b>crippling</b> in C-sections. FE results are employed to investigate the effect of different parameters on sections resistance. It was found that, the strengths predicted by design codes are generally inadequate for channels with a practical web slenderness range. Therefore, modifications were proposed to improve the strength predicted by codes...|$|R
