5|$|Religious {{intolerance}} was {{one particular}} {{factor in the}} decline of the Pax Mongolica. In Rus', the Mongols (known as the Golden Horde), gradually lost power and territory due to intolerance specifically geared towards different religions. The Rus' Mongols <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> <b>Islam</b> and joined the Egyptian Mamluks for political reasons. At one point in the war the Golden Horde even fought the Persian Mongols. The eastern part of the Golden Horde, White Horde, had friendly relations with the Ilkhanate and the Great Khan. The decentralisation occurred because communication was so difficult due to the collapsing trade system and the rivalry between Mongol princes. Eventually, the Persian Mongol leader Ghazan <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> <b>Islam</b> in 1295. This contributed to the growing power of Nawruz; a Muslim Oirat general.|$|E
5|$|The {{emergence}} of Tablighi Jamaat also coincided {{closely with the}} rise of various Hindu proselytizing movements such as Shuddhi (purification) and Sanghatan (consolidation) which launched massive efforts {{in the early twentieth century}} to reconvert Hindus who had <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> <b>Islam</b> and Christianity.|$|E

25|$|Women {{make up a}} disproportionately {{large or}} rising share of <b>converts</b> <b>to</b> <b>Islam</b> in {{numerous}} Western countries. According to researchers based at Swansea University, of the approximately 100,000 people who entered the Muslim faith in the United Kingdom between 2001 and 2011, 75% were women. In the United States, more Hispanic women <b>convert</b> <b>to</b> <b>Islam</b> than Hispanic men; the share of overall female <b>converts</b> <b>to</b> <b>Islam</b> in the US rose from 32% in 2000 to 41% in 2011. Young females constitute an estimated 80% of <b>converts</b> <b>to</b> <b>Islam</b> in Lithuania. According to Susanne Leuenberger of the Institute of Advanced Study in the Humanities and the Social Sciences at the University of Bern, females make up around 60-70% of conversions <b>to</b> <b>Islam</b> in Europe.|$|R
5|$|According to Russian {{scholars}} Ivan Yastrebov and Pavel Rovinski, {{the cross}} was originally {{kept in the}} Prečista Krajinska Church, in which Kosara had interred Vladimir. The peak of Islamization of the Krajina region was reached {{at the end of}} 18th century. The church was torn down, though it is uncertain when and by whom, but the cross was preserved by the people of the region. They believed that it could protect against evil and ensure a rich harvest, and kept it as sacred, although they had <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> <b>Islam.</b> The cross was later taken from them by the neighboring clan of Mrkojevići. As they too <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> <b>Islam,</b> they entrusted the cross to the Andrović family—their Orthodox Christian neighbors. The Mrkojevići considered it more appropriate for the cross to be kept in a Christian home, rather than in a Muslim one.|$|E
5|$|After the Muslim {{conquest of}} Persia, Zoroastrians were given dhimmi status and {{subjected}} to persecutions; discrimination and harassment began {{in the form of}} sparse violence.

Zoroastrians who were captured as slaves in wars were given their freedom if they <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> <b>Islam.</b>|$|E
5|$|During the occupation, {{approximately}} 4,000 {{children were}} forcibly {{removed from their}} families by Indonesian soldiers {{as well as by}} state and religious organizations. Although some were well-treated, others were subjected to various forms of abuse, including sexual abuse. Some were <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> <b>Islam.</b> A number of soldiers who kidnapped these children still hold senior positions within the Indonesian military.|$|E
25|$|A non-Muslim {{person who}} wishes to marry a Muslim person must <b>convert</b> <b>to</b> <b>Islam</b> before the {{marriage}} can be recognised as legally valid.

50|$|Most Uyghur {{inhabitants}} of the Besh Balik and Turpan regions did not <b>convert</b> <b>to</b> <b>Islam</b> until the 15th century expansion of the Yarkand Khanate, a Turko-Mongol successor state based in western Tarim. Before <b>converting</b> <b>to</b> <b>Islam,</b> Uyghurs were Tengriist, Manichaeans, Buddhists, or Nestorian Christians.|$|R

5|$|After the {{disappearance}} of Olubei from the scene ca. 1458, no princes are known by name until Isaac in 1465, possibly Olubei's son. Isaac was overthrown in 1475 by his brother Alexander due to his pro-Ottoman stance. His reign was brief, as the Ottoman Empire laid siege and conquered Theodoro itself in December. Alexander {{and his family were}} taken captive to Constantinople, where the prince was beheaded, his son was forcibly <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> <b>Islam,</b> and his wife and daughters became part of the Sultan's harem.|$|E
5|$|Chinese {{who married}} local Javanese women and <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> <b>Islam</b> created a {{distinct}} Chinese Muslim Peranakan community in Java. Chinese rarely had {{to convert to}} Islam to marry Javanese abangan women but {{a significant amount of}} their offspring did, and Batavian Muslims absorbed the Chinese Muslim community which was descended from converts. Adoption of Islam back then was a marker of peranakan status which it no longer means. The Semaran Adipati and the Jayaningrat families were of Chinese origin.|$|E
5|$|In 1282, Michael Palaeologus {{died and}} his son Andronicus II took power. The death of the old Byzantine Emperor came as a relief for the society at large; his policy of Latin {{appeasement}} to the Church in Rome, heavy taxation and military expenditure placed a severe burden on the people. As the Ottoman Turks began taking land from the Empire, they were seen as liberators of Anatolians and many soon <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> <b>Islam</b> undermining the Byzantine's Orthodox power base.|$|E

Generally Han of both sexes have <b>to</b> <b>convert</b> <b>to</b> <b>Islam</b> before marrying. This practice helped increase the population of Hui. In northwest China, intermarriages mostly involve Han women. A case of switching nationality occurred in 1972 when a Han man married a Hui and was considered a Hui after converting.|$|R

5|$|The {{majority}} of Byzantine Greeks lived in Asia Minor, the southern Balkans, and Aegean islands. Nearly {{all of these}} Byzantine Greeks fell under Turkish Muslim rule by the 16th century. Many retained their identities, eventually comprising the modern Greek and Cypriot {{states as well as}} the Cappadocian Greek and Pontic Greek minorities in Asia Minor. Other Byzantine Greeks, particularly in Anatolia, <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> <b>Islam</b> and underwent Turkification over time.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the inhabitants today are Muslim, but there are small Christian and Samaritan communities as well. Much of the local Palestinian Muslim population of Nablus {{is believed to be}} descended from Samaritans who <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> <b>Islam.</b> Certain Nabulsi family names are associated with Samaritan ancestry – Muslimani, Yaish, and Shakshir among others. According to the historian Fayyad Altif, large numbers of Samaritans converted due to persecution and because the monotheistic nature of Islam made it easy for them to accept it.|$|E
5|$|Abaqa died in 1282 and {{was briefly}} {{replaced}} {{by his brother}} Tekuder, who had <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> <b>Islam.</b> Tekuder reversed Abaqa's policy of seeking an alliance with the Franks, offering instead an alliance to the Mamluk Sultan Qalawun, who continued his own advance, capturing the Hospitaller fortress of Margat in 1285, Lattakia in 1287, and the County of Tripoli in 1289. However, Tekuder's pro-Muslim stance was not popular, and in 1284, Abaqa's Buddhist son Arghun, {{with the support of}} the Great Khan Kublai, led a revolt and had Tekuder executed. Arghun then revived the idea of an alliance with the West, and sent multiple envoys to Europe.|$|E

5|$|Isabelle Wilhelmine Marie Eberhardt (17 February 1877– 21 October 1904) was a Swiss {{explorer}} and writer.

After an invitation from photographer Louis David, Eberhardt moved to Algeria in May 1897. She dressed as a man and <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> <b>Islam,</b> eventually adopting the name Si Mahmoud Saadi. Eberhardt's unorthodox behaviour made her an outcast among European settlers in Algeria and the French administration.|$|E
5|$|The {{first group}} of {{converts}} to Islam in Medina were the clans without great leaders; these clans had been subjugated by hostile leaders from outside. This {{was followed by the}} general acceptance of Islam by the pagan population of Medina, with some exceptions. According to Ibn Ishaq, this was influenced by the conversion of Sa'd ibn Mu'adh (a prominent Medinan leader) to Islam. Medinans who <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> <b>Islam</b> and helped the Muslim emigrants find shelter became known as the ansar (supporters). Then Muhammad instituted brotherhood between the emigrants and the supporters and he chose Ali as his own brother.|$|E
