30|$|To {{cope with}} the crisis of global climate change, the {{electric}} power industries {{around the world are}} transiting to sustainable energy systems with increasing <b>capacities</b> <b>of</b> renewable <b>energy</b> <b>sources,</b> such as the wind and solar power plants [1]. Besides, some other <b>energy</b> <b>sources</b> such as the natural gas fired power plants (NGFPs) also show great potentials, as the natural gas (NG) generally enjoys higher efficiency and lower costs over other fossil fuels such as coal and petroleum [2]. Recent development and commercialization of power-to-gas (PtG) plants complete the close loop between electric power systems and the NG networks, making the coordinated operation of multi-energy system become a reality. The combined gas-electricity energy sector demonstrates the trend of the future sustainable multi-energy systems [3, 4].|$|R

In future work, the study results might be employed for designing very specific regulatory policies. The recommendations developed in this study focus primarily on the regulatory framework for smart grids and contains a quite detailed description of how the German electricity markets evolved. It also focuses on the effects of ambitiously expanding generation <b>capacities</b> <b>of</b> renewable <b>energy</b> <b>sources</b> (RES) on established electricity markets.

50|$|Renewable <b>energy</b> <b>sources</b> such as solar, wind, tidal, hydro, biomass, and {{geothermal}} {{have become}} significant sectors <b>of</b> the <b>energy</b> market. The {{rapid growth of}} these sources {{in the 21st century}} has been prompted by increasing costs of fossil fuels as well as their negative environmental impacts. While the average <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> renewable <b>energy</b> <b>sources</b> was only 7% globally in 2010, most installation <b>of</b> new <b>capacity</b> has been with renewables. Few new installations were from fossil fuel-based power plants. The trend towards new power capacity by renewables is expected to continue through 2020. Since renewable energy supplies offset the amount of fossil fuels that need to be combusted in power plants, the use of renewables indirectly helps to reduce CO2 emissions. Hence, renewable energy supplies enable societies to progress towards lower-carbon-based economies.|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} <b>capacities</b> <b>of</b> renewable <b>energy</b> <b>sources</b> and {{the opportunities}} emerging from the smart grid technology lead to new challenges for energy forecasters. Energy output fluctuates stronger compared to conventional power production. More time series data is available through the usage of sensor technology. New supply forecasting approaches are developed to better address those characteristics, but meaningful benchmarks of such solutions are rare. Conducting detailed evaluations is time-intensive and unattractive to customers as this is mostly handwork. We define and discuss requirements for e cient and reliable benchmarks <b>of</b> renewable <b>energy</b> supply forecasting tools. To cope with those requirements, we introduce the automated benchmark framework ECAST as our proposed solution. The system’s capability is demonstrated on a real-world scenario comparing the performance of di↵erent prediction tools against a naive method. 1...|$|R
40|$|A high {{increase}} in the installed <b>capacities</b> <b>of</b> Renewable <b>Energy</b> <b>Sources</b> (RES) is expected by 2020 and beyond in Europe, and power systems planners and regulators {{have to make sure}} that the power systems are designed and operated to make optimal use of the potential <b>of</b> these clean <b>energy</b> <b>sources.</b> This paper investigates the consequences of integrating large-scale solar and wind power in the future Northwestern European power system. A zonal market model is used, where unit commitment and economic dispatch simulations for a given development scenario of load and generation, including wind power and solar power time series and inter-zonal transmission constraints, are with hourly resolution. The ability of the power system to absorb the available 2 ̆ 2 green 2 ̆ 2 energy is assessed.

This {{means that the}} vehicle must contain a significant electric <b>energy</b> <b>source.</b> The large <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>energy</b> <b>source</b> causes the vehicle to either sacrifice {{a large part of}} its up time to charge the source or apply a higher charge power at the cost of power losses and lifetime <b>of</b> the <b>energy</b> <b>source.</b> This thesis contains a pre-study of high-power DC-charge of hybrid batteries from existing infrastructure suited to electric hybrid cars. Following parts are included in the thesis: modeling of a battery pack and a DC-DC converter, formulation of a MPC controller for the battery pack, analysis of charging strategies and battery restrictions through simulations. The thesis results shows that a longer charging time increases the energy efficiency and reduces the degradation in the battery. It also shows that a charging strategy similar to constant-current-constant-voltage charging should be used for a full charge of an empty battery...|$|R

Such cases often occur in various regions, including Indonesia. This problem can be solved through observation and measurement in the power systems using a data logger. Data logger is the electronic equipment which can record the formation of data accurately. In this paper, the current and voltage formation of solar-wind hybrid power system which is recorded by the data logger will be analyzed. The results then {{will be used for}} resizing strategy of the plant, especially which was established but still showed indications of inefficiency. Furthermore, by using the Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE), the system energy cost before and after resizing will be compared.

30|$|Among the {{renewable}} <b>energy</b> <b>sources,</b> {{solar power}} {{has the highest}} increase capacity. In 2014, solar power generation capacity increased by 14.1 % compared with 2013 [1]. Although {{there is a significant}} increase in the installed <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> solar <b>energy</b> <b>sources,</b> the percentage <b>of</b> solar <b>energy</b> in the total installed capacity is still limited. Understanding and modeling the solar energy capacity can enhance the solar energy production. The factors and the relations among the solar energy generation are uncertain, complex and vague. Fuzzy cognitive maps are excellent tools for dealing with complexity and ambiguity inherent in modeling problems [2]. Hesitant fuzzy sets are the extensions of fuzzy sets where more than one membership value of an element can be defined [3, 4]. Hesitant fuzzy sets and hesitant linguistic term sets enable better expressing the experts’ evaluations [4, 5, 6]. In this study, hesitant fuzzy cognitive maps are used for modeling solar energy generation capacity.|$|R

Energy storages for EV applications are rated on the basis of three parameters namely, specific energy, energy density and specific power.

Both methods are used for designing the overhead power line (OHPL), choosing the optimum conductor type and cross-section {{as well as other}} main line parameters such as the height, type and coordinates of towers, the line route, the line fittings, etc. Moreover, the paper presents a new approach for implementing a stochastic optimization procedure with a statistical representation of the electricity prices, ambient temperature and load currents in the transmission network. The problem is formulated as minimization of the total annual costs for the transmission line (TL) construction project.

40|$|The study {{presents}} a cost effective electricity generation portfolio for six island {{states for a}} 20 -year period (2015 - 2035). The underlying concept investigates whether adding sizeable power <b>capacities</b> <b>of</b> renewable <b>energy</b> <b>sources</b> (RES) options could decrease the overall costs and contribute to a more sustainable, indigenous electricity generation at the same time. Often, island states rely on fossil fuels which apart from dependence on foreign resources also includes an additional, significant transport cost. This is an extra motive to study the extent in which island states represent primary locations for RES technologies. For {{the aims of the}} present study an optimization model has been developed and following numerous runs the obtained results show that installing PV and battery capacities can delay-reduce the huge investments in fossil options in early periods. Thus, investment on RES can have a positive, long-term effect on the overall energy mix. This prompt development can happen without adding new subsidies but {{there is a need to}} address the existing socio-economic barriers with intelligent design of financing and economic instruments and capacity building as discussed in the conclusions.

40|$|Abstract — According {{to recent}} projections, the {{installed}} <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> renewable <b>energy</b> <b>sources</b> and interconnectors will increase significantly in GB power system. With {{such a large}} scale of penetration <b>of</b> converter-interfaced renewable <b>energy</b> <b>sources</b> and HVDC interconnectors, the existing power system, which is predominately supplied by synchronous generation presently, will face system operation challenges which are currently attracting the urgent attention of both industry and researchers.

There has been a lack of investigation of the individual factors {{and the degree to which}} these factors influence the non-synchronous generation limit. While the general term penetration level is often used as an annual average rather than an instantaneous operational value in many papers, it has not been fully defined or a standard definition agreed to date. In this paper, different definitions of penetration level will be introduced and discussed. System operational issues associated with angular stability will be analysed through simulation results. It will also be illustrated that the conventional analysis method for angular stability is not applicable for future power systems with high penetration levels of NSG.

30|$|From the {{technical}} perspective, the overall {{efficiency of the}} electricity-gas-electricity process is leveled around 30 %– 40 % nowadays [29]. But the introduced gas to electricity process provides an alternative way to utilize the NG converted by the PtG plants. As discussed in the previous sections, the electricity market prices are volatile, especially with increased <b>capacities</b> <b>of</b> intermittent renewable <b>energy</b> <b>sources.</b> The coordinated PtG and NGFP operation will be profitable if the maximum electricity price is at least 2.5  times higher than the minimum price, if the overall efficiency is 40 %. Compared with the isolated PtG operation which only becomes cost efficient under negative electricity prices, the coordinated PtG and NGFP operation appears more reliable. Besides, the PtG efficiency could be significantly improved {{with the development of}} PEM & BM technologies. The overall electricity-gas-electricity efficiency will be as high as 60 % in the future. It is foreseeable that the coordinated PtG and NGFP will become a feasible solution for large-scale integration of PtG plants.|$|R
40|$|In recent years, major industrialized {{countries}} {{have begun to}} be concerned about the need for developing strategies on the integration and protection of the growing power <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> renewable <b>source</b> <b>energies,</b> attracting back their interest on the development and understanding of superconducting fault current limiters (SFCLs). The reasons for this are simple: An SFCL may offer a rapid, reliable, and effective current limitation, with zero impedance during normal operation, and an automatic recovery after the fault. Nowadays, most of the R&D projects have turned toward the study of resistive-type SFCLs due to their potential to be small and the likely decrease in price of 2 G coated conductors. Thus, in this paper, we provide an updated review on the state of the art of resistive-type SFCLs, emphasizing on the different approaches for the numerical modeling of their local physical properties, as well as on the already-tested experimental concepts. Comparison between the properties and characteristics of different resistive-type SFCLs using different superconducting materials is presented. Peer-reviewedPost-prin...|$|R

40|$|In Germany, the {{installed}} <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> renewable <b>energy</b> <b>sources,</b> {{especially that}} <b>of</b> wind and photovoltaic energy, has {{increased over the}} past few years and will continue to increase in the future. Due to errors in forecasting wind and photovoltaic energy, the control reserve needed to balance the electricity system will correspondingly increase if control reserves will be sized statically for several months or one year as it is done in most countries today [1 - 3]. That is because sizing control reserves this way does not consider the fact that there will be hours with a high penetration of wind and photovoltaic which cause a different demand for control reserves than hours with a lower penetration. Therefore, in this work, we present a new probabilistic dynamic method that sizes control reserves for the single hours of the following day making use of forecasts of the power feed-in of wind and photovoltaic. In contrast to similar approaches [2, 3] forecast errors of wind and photovoltaic power are not modeled as normal distributions, which does not reflect reality [4 - 6], but by kernel density estimation to get more realistic distributions. Under a 100 % renewable energy scenario for Germany, the control reserve that would be allocated by the dynamic method is compared with the control reserve that would be allocated by a static method. The static method is similar to the probabilistic Graf-Haubrich method, which is applied in Germany today, but can, in contrast to this method, be applied to future scenarios. It is shown that the dynamic method halves the average required control reserve...|$|R

40|$|Power Quality {{has been}} an {{important}} concept since the inception of power systems. With more and more sensitive equipment being used in the industries, the requirement of standards of power quality has been highlighted. Power quality related problems that result in loss of production in critical processes create a dilemma for both the serving utility and the customer. This research is based on giving proposals to solve a specific power quality problem involving voltage sags in one of the large scale customers of Ceylon Electricity Board i. e. Merbok MDF Lanka (Pvt) Ltd. The customer has installed considerable amount of sensitive equipment in his large scale manufacturing processes including PLC equipments, variable speed drives, etc. The customer has faced frequent power interruptions and subsequent production losses due to the said power quality problem. Data was obtained from the customer prermses and from the Horana GSS. After analyzing the data it was revealed that most of the Voltage sags are due to fault conditions in the nearby distribution feeders. Voltage sags having 0. 8 to 0. 9 p. u. magnitude and 0. 5 to 3 s duration are the most common. When giving a solution for the problem both system level improvements and device level mitigation solutions are proposed. In data analysis it is found that pattern of tripping is highly weather dependent. This is considered in system improvement proposals and regular way leave clearance of identified feeders is found to be executed. In addition to that installing auto reclosers at the Horana gantry is proposed {{in order to reduce the}} fault clearance time and to improve system reliability as it will directly reduce number of unnecessary tripping at the grid substation. As a device level mitigation several options such as static transfer switch (STS), uninterruptible power supply (UPS), shunt connected voltage source converter (STATCOM), series connected voltage source converter (SVC) cum dynamic voltage restorer (DVR) are discussed. DVR is proposed as the best solution for this situation as it r can provide voltage support for individual loads. The power rating of the DVR and the <b>capacity</b> requirement <b>of</b> the <b>energy</b> <b>source</b> is calculated.
