25|$|An issue {{likely to}} come into play will be a {{provision}} in the Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-134), which places a US$200 million cap on the aggregate of all passengers' damage claims in a railroad accident against a passenger railroad, including punitive damages. Bloomberg News reported that this event would likely be the first legal test of this law, according to a former House rail committee staffer who helped write the law, who predicted that given the number of casualties, the cap is almost <b>certainly</b> <b>going</b> to be an issue in pending litigation. An attorney representing two of the victims agreed, saying payouts could range from $5 million to $10 million per death or serious injury. Metrolink reportedly has insurance coverage totaling $150 million.|$|E
500|$|Although {{officials}} {{downplayed the}} level of threat the trio presented to Obama, they said they planned further investigations into how a gang of supposedly small-time criminals collected such a massive arsenal. Authorities believed the men had at least some white supremacist involvement, although experts at the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks the radical right, said no evidence existed linking any of them to a white supremacist group. Nevertheless, the possible connections prompted FBI officials, who originally considered the threat [...] "relatively minor", to develop stronger concerns about whether the motives from the three plotters could have been connected to a larger organization. The FBI stated that with an African American candidate for president, [...] "you are <b>certainly</b> <b>going</b> {{to look at the}} general threat picture against any candidate and factor in the threats posed by those who preach hate and racism." ...|$|E
500|$|Andrew Goodlife, a {{professor}} of geological sciences at the University of Alabama, believes the state is at [...] "high" [...] risk from earthquakes. He claims that [...] "If there is an earthquake {{in one of the}} zone areas, North Alabama is <b>certainly</b> <b>going</b> to feel it. There's going to be damage and some perhaps major. If one occurred in the zone close to Memphis, it would be devastating because buildings are not made to withstand earthquakes. Places like San Francisco are aware of earthquake risks and structures are built to withstand them." [...] By his definition, the state's earthquakes are [...] "insignificant". Emergency planner Bill Thomison feels skeptical about a major earthquake, stating, [...] "I don't believe there are any major faults (interface of rocks) here. It depends on the magnitude of the earthquake and the Richter scale. You could have a No. 4 (magnitude) earthquake in California and not damage anything, but the same type in New York could be devastating because the building codes don't factor in earthquakes." ...|$|E

[...] Idolator blogger Sam Lansky commented that, for the fans, [...] "Something New" [...] is [...] "a welcome relief to [...] have an injection of fresh energy into the stagnant girl group scene," [...] and concluded that, [...] "given that this may be the group's final single before disbanding for good, they're <b>certainly</b> <b>going</b> out on a high note, with a track that feels quintessentially Aloud but retooled for 2012." [...] Rebecca Twomey of Marie Claire said that the group is [...] "on key with the current trend for dance music with their new song," [...] while noting that they have [...] "clearly taken inspiration from Cheryl's Call My Name." [...] Katy Brand of The Daily Telegraph was critical towards the song. Brand said that the lyrics [...] "are the usual post-Spice fare," [...] but commented that [...] "the images weren't quite matching the words. I was hearing the battle cry of enraged queens who will be oppressed no longer; I was watching five young women wearing identical orange mini-dresses, strutting up and down in perfect synchronicity, like catwalk models." ...|$|E
500|$|The music video, {{directed}} by Yankovic's manager Jay Levey, is a near shot-for-shot {{parody of the}} original video for [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit", which depicts the band playing {{at a high school}} concert while it descends into riot. Yankovic is present on guitar and vocals as Kurt Cobain, with Steve Jay on bass as Krist Novoselic, and Jon [...] "Bermuda" [...] Schwartz on drums as Dave Grohl. All three wear clothing and long-haired wigs to imitate the look of Nirvana in [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit". Yankovic's video uses many of the same props, actors and camera angles; in particular, the video was shot in the same Culver City, California sound stage as Nirvana's video, several of the cheerleaders and audience members were from the original video, and Tony De La Rosa reprises his role as the janitor. Levey stated {{that they were able to}} recreate much of the same setting with help of the producers of the original Nirvana video once they were aware that the song had Cobain's blessing. Yankovic had a brief conversation with Samuel Bayer, the original director of [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit" [...] in preparation for the video shoot. Although Yankovic noted that [...] "he was <b>certainly</b> <b>going</b> along with it", he felt that Bayer was [...] "the least enthused" [...] because [...] "he was a true artiste" [...] and was reluctant to see his work parodied.|$|E

2500|$|Belief in {{the afterlife}} varies among Wiccans, and does not occupy a central place within the religion.

Although there are practitioners who do not believe in any form of afterlife, it is nevertheless a common belief among Wiccans that human beings have a spirit or soul that survives bodily death. Understandings of what this soul constitutes vary among different traditions, with Feri Wicca for instance having adopted a belief from Hawaiian religion that the human being has three souls.|$|E

2500|$|Jesperson {{was arrested}} on 30 March 1995, {{for the murder of}} Winningham. He had been {{questioned}} by police a week before, but they had no grounds to arrest him after he refused to talk. In the days following, Jesperson decided that he was <b>certainly</b> <b>going</b> to be arrested, and after two failed suicide attempts, he turned himself in hoping it would result in leniency during his sentencing. While in custody, Jesperson began revealing details of his killings and making claims of many others, most of which he later recanted. Also, a few days before his arrest, he wrote a letter to his brother. In it, he confessed to having killed eight people over the course of five years. This led police agencies in several states across the country to reopen old cases, many of which were found to be possible victims of Jesperson.|$|E
2500|$|Andrea Towers of Entertainment Weekly said, [...] "Much {{like the}} first season of the fairytale show, it looks like we'll spend most of 5A looking back at what {{actually}} happened in those missing six weeks, how Emma became the Dark One, {{and what it means}} for Storybrooke. It'll be interesting to see where this season lands overall. Last year, we spent months entombed in a Frozen arc that seemed to stretch on for so long, it made even the warmest of fans feel icy. Putting Emma in the spotlight as the Dark One seems like an attempt to bring some focus back to the show's themes as well as its central characters, despite the fact there are <b>certainly</b> <b>going</b> to be many new ones popping in (and out) over the season.

2500|$|Traffic {{congestion}} {{problems on the}} roadways, as with elsewhere in Southern California, {{is the result of}} the demand for driving exceeding the available capacity, especially on area freeways. Many of the existing freeways were completed in the late 1970s, with the exception of the segment of the Foothill Freeway, State Route 210 (SR 210) between San Dimas and San Bernardino completed in July 2007. New freeways or highways [...] "fix-ups" [...] are being planned, such as the expansion of the length of the 215 freeway around Inland Center Mall. However, other problems exist, one being the jobs vs. housing imbalance. The Inland Empire population grew as a result of affordable housing, at least relative to the rest of Southern California. But most of the higher paying jobs are located in Los Angeles, San Diego and Orange counties. Thus, many workers must drive daily from the Inland Empire to their jobs in these counties -sometimes up to two hours each direction, and even longer if by public transportation. As the population increases, the problem is most <b>certainly</b> <b>going</b> to get worse. Forbes magazine recently ranked the area first in its list of most unhealthy commutes in the United States, beating out every other metropolitan area in the country, as Inland area drivers breathe the unhealthiest air and have the highest rate of fatal auto accidents per capita.|$|E
