500|$|The 19 bracelets {{buried in}} the hoard include three sets of four {{matching}} gold bracelets. Though many similar bracelets have survived, sets of four are most unusual; {{they may have been}} worn two on each arm, or possibly were shared by two related women. One set has been decorated by <b>corrugating</b> the gold with lateral and transverse grooves; the other two sets bear pierced-work geometric designs. Another five bracelets bear hunting scenes, common in Late Roman decorative art. Three have the designs executed in pierced-work, whereas two others are in repoussé. One bracelet is the sole gold item in the hoard to carry an inscription: it reads [...] "" [...] in Latin, meaning [...] "Use [...] happily, Lady Juliane". The expression utere felix (or sometimes uti felix) is the second most common inscriptional formula on items from Roman Britain, and is used to wish good luck, well-being and joy. The formula is not specifically Christian, but it sometimes occurs in an explicitly Christian context, for example, together with a Chi-Rho symbol.|$|E

60|$|And little Elsie? did {{the grim}} Doctor love her as well? Perhaps not, for, {{in the first}} place, there was a natural tie, though not the nearest, between her and Doctor Grimshawe, which made him feel that she was cast upon his love: a burden which he {{acknowledged}} himself bound to undertake. Then, too, there were unutterably painful reminiscences and thoughts, that made him gasp for breath, that turned his blood sour, that tormented his dreams with nightmares and hellish phantoms; {{all of which were}} connected with this innocent and happy child; so that, cheerful and pleasant as she was, there was to the grim Doctor a little fiend playing about his floor and throwing a lurid light on the wall, as the shadow of this sun-flickering child. It is certain that there was always a pain and horror mixed with his feelings towards Elsie; he had to forget himself, as it were, and all that was connected with the causes why she came to be, before he could love her. Amid his fondness, when he was caressing her upon his knee, pressing her to his rough bosom, as he never took the freedom to press Ned, came these hateful reminiscences, compelling him to set her down, and <b>corrugating</b> his heavy brows as with a pang of fiercely resented, strongly borne pain. Still, the child had no doubt contrived to make her way into the great gloomy cavern of the grim Doctor's heart, and stole constantly further and further in, carrying a ray of sunshine in her hand as a taper to light her way, and illuminate the rude dark pit into which she so fearlessly went.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} study, a flow {{visualization}} and heat transfer investigation {{is carried out}} computationally on a flat plate with 10 x 1 array of impinging jets from a corrugated plate. This corrugated structure is an Anti-Cross Flow (ACF) technique which is proved to nullify {{the negative effects of}} cross-flow thus enhancing the overall cooling performance. Governing equations are solved using k-omega Shear Stress Transport (SST) turbulence model in commercial code FLUENT. The parameter variation considered for the present study are (i) three different heights of ACF <b>corrugate</b> (C/D= 1, 2 & 3) and (ii) two different jet-to-target plate spacing (H/D= 1 & 2).). The dependence of ACF structure performance on the <b>corrugate</b> height (C/D) and the flow structure has been discussed in detail, therefore choosing an optimum <b>corrugate</b> height and visualizing the three-dimensional flow phenomena are the main objectives of the present study. The three-dimensional flow separation and heat transfer characteristics are explained with the help of skin friction lines, upwash fountains, wall eddies, counter-rotating vortex pair (CRVP), and plots of Nusselt number. It is found that the heat transfer performance is high at larger <b>corrugate</b> heights for both the jet-to-plate spacing. Moreover, the deterioration of the skin friction pattern corresponding to the far downstream impingement zones is greatly reduced with ACF structure, retaining more uniform heat transfer pattern even at low H/D values where the crossflow effects are more dominant in case of the conventional cooling structure. In comparison of the overall heat transfer performance, the difference between C/D= 3 & C/D= 2 for H/D= 2 is significantly less, thus making the later as the optimal configuration in terms of reduced channel height...|$|R

However, the experimental results were not exciting. They were not as the simulation results we expected. The reasons were analyzed through this article. Finally a rivet-relative model was created considering the influence of riveting. This model was proved to be accurate by comparing with experimental results.

40|$|Abstract Beneficial Reuse of Corrugated Paperboard in Civil Engineering Applications Gregory Michael Stone An {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} explore the potential for reuse of corrugated paperboard. Corrugated paperboard represents a large fraction of the municipal solid waste generated and discarded in the United States. Alternative applications for reuse can provide a significant benefit by reducing the volume of waste being disposed and by reducing the use of raw materials. Four civil engineering applications were examined for potential beneficial reuse of corrugated paperboard: slurry trench construction, vertical drilling, directional drilling, and controlled low strength materials (CLSM). For {{the purpose of this}} project, corrugated paperboard was pulped and added to bentonite slurry or CLSM mixtures. Bentonite slurry mixtures were tested for viscosity, density, filtrate loss, and permeability. The behavior of the bentonite slurries was greatly influenced by interaction and interlocking of <b>corrugate</b> fibers; in general resulting in increased viscosity, filtrate loss, and permeability and decreased density. CLSM mixtures were tested for flow consistency, unit weight, air content, and compressive strength. CLSM mixtures prepared with corrugated paperboard showed an increased water demand due to high absorption of the <b>corrugate.</b> The higher water content was a significant factor contributing to decreased unit weight and compressive strength. CLSM mixtures containing corrugated paperboard also exhibited increased air contents, possibly due to entrapment of air within the <b>corrugate</b> pulp. Corrugated paperboard was used to successfully replace up to 27 % of bentonite for slurry trench applications, 60 % of bentonite for vertical drilling applications, and 59 % of bentonite for directional drilling applications while maintaining acceptable engineering properties. For CLSM mixtures up to 1 % of fine aggregate was replaced with corrugated paperboard while maintaining satisfactory engineering properties. Incorporation of corrugated paper board into bentonite slurry, CLSM, and drilling fluid applications provides a viable option for beneficial reuse...|$|R

40|$|Background: Perianal abscess {{which can}} lead to a devastating complications. The {{management}} of perianal abscess involves incision and drainage by different methods one of them is packing the cavity. Aim of the study: The aim is using <b>Corrugate</b> Rubber drain as an alternative to other methods. Patients and methods: This study was an observational retrospective review of 137 'case series' of patients with perianal abscess over a fifteen-year period from January 2000 to December 2015. 67 patients in group A were managed by Corrugated Rubber drain and 70 patients in group B were managed by packing. In group A, males were 92. 53 % more than females (7. 46 %) while group B, males were 85. 71 % and the rest were females. Outcome measures were assessed; time to cavity healing, pain scoring, abscess recurrence, fistula formation, analgesic requirement and skin disfigurement. Results: The mean time of abscess healing in group A and B were 8. 50  ±  0. 49 and 8. 90  ±  0. 23 days respectively. Their pain score using <b>Corrugate</b> Rubber drain postoperative were 2 / 10 in group A while group B was 8 / 10. Most of patients in group A needed mild analgesia (52 / 67) (77. 61 %).
