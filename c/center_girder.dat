40|$|The Utah Transportation Center (UTC), in {{partnership}} with the Mountain Plains Consortium (MPC), sponsored a study to investigate the differences in prestress losses and temperature gradients in a concrete deck bulb tee girder bridge. The Millville Bridge was built as an access point to the Ridgeline High School in Millville, Utah. The bridge was built in 2016 and presently supports two lanes of traffic. Changes in prestress were measured with a total of 16 vibrating wire strain gauges located at four cross-sections. Temperature gradients were measured with a total of 50 thermocouples located at five cross-section locations, four of which were shared locations with the vibrating wire strain gauges. These instruments were placed at the mid-span and end of an exterior and <b>center</b> <b>girder</b> to effectively measure the bridge response in one quarter of the bridge superstructure. These instruments were placed in the precast plant and tied to the reinforcing steel before the concrete was poured. The prestress loss recordings were initiated before the prestressing strands were released. The thermocouple data for Girder 1 began to be recorded before the initial casting of the girder concrete. The thermocouple data for Girder 5 was not recorded during casting and curing of the girder concrete, but was started before the curing blanket was removed in the casting yard. All data was recorded until February 29, 2016. Prestress losses at the girder mid-span and temperature gradients were compared with code recommended values according to the AASHTO bridge design specifications...|$|E

KramerStrut-and-Tie {{models are}} useful in {{designing}} reinforced concrete structures with discontinuity regions where linear stress distribution is not valid. Deep beams are typically short girders with a large point load or multiple point loads. These point loads, {{in conjunction with the}} depth and length of the members, contribute to a member with primarily discontinuity regions. ACI 318 - 08 Building Code Requirements for Structural Concrete provides a method for designing deep beams using either Strut-and-Tie models (STM) or Deep Beam Method (DBM). This report compares dimension requirements, concrete quantities, steel quantities, and constructability of the two methods through the design of three different deep beams. The three designs consider the same single span deep beam with varying height and loading patterns. The first design is a single span deep beam with a large point load at the <b>center</b> <b>girder.</b> The second design is the deep beam with the same large point load at a quarter point of the girder. The last design is the deep beam with half the load at the midpoint and the other half at the quarter point. These three designs allow consideration of different shear and STM model geometry and design considerations. Comparing the two different designs shows the shear or cracking control reinforcement reduces by an average 13 % because the STM considers the extra shear capacity through arching action. The tension steel used for either flexure or the tension tie increases by an average of 16 % from deep beam in STM design. This is due to STM taking shear force through tension in the tension reinforcement through arching action. The main advantage of the STM is the ability to decreased member depth without decreasing shear reinforcement spacing. If the member depth is not a concern in the design, the preferred method is DBM unless the designer is familiar with STMs due to the similarity of deep beam and regular beam design theory...|$|E

40|$|The Utah Transportation Center (UTC) {{as well as}} the Mountain Plains Consortium, {{sponsored}} a study to investigate the long-term performance of a deck bulb tee girder bridge. The bridge in question is located in Nibley, Utah and was erected in early 2016. Temperature and prestress losses were analyzed from embedded instrumentation placed within two of the bridge girders before casting. These two girders contained a total of 50 thermocouples and 16 vibrating wire strain gauges. These instruments were placed at the mid-span and end of an exterior girder and the mid-span, quarter-span, and end of a <b>center</b> <b>girder</b> in order to effectively monitor the bridge response in one quarter of the bridge superstructure. The monitoring performed with the thermocouples included the temperature of the girders during curing, weekly maximum and minimum temperatures compared to methods for predicting the average bridge temperature, maximum and minimum thermal gradients at each of the five selected cross sections compared to Code thermal gradients, and thermal camber by measured temperature compared to models to predict thermal gradients. The 16 strain gauges measured prestress losses at four girder cross-sections, which were compared to two predictive methods provided by AASHTO as well as a method by PCI. An additional comparison of the equations provided by AASHTO and a newly available equation used for determining the modulus of elasticity of concretes with a compressive strength of 6, 000 â€“ 12, 000 psi was performed. Additional exterior instrumentation were provided by Bridge Diagnostics Inc. (BDI) in order to monitor short-term changes within the bridge. A total of 8 strain gauges were attached to the exterior of the girders with 6 attached at the bottom face of 6 girders and 2 attached at the centroid of 2 girders. These sensors {{as well as the}} software and wireless data acquisition provided a method to measure the magnitude and frequency of the ranges of strain experienced by the Nibley Bridge...|$|E
40|$|As part of {{a project}} at the University of Minnesota to {{investigate}} the application of high-strength concrete in prestressed girders, four shear tests were performed on high-strength concrete prestressed girders. Originally constructed in August 1993, the girders, Minnesota Department of Transportation (Mn/DOT) 45 M sections were 45 inches deep. Each girder utilized 46 0. 6 -inch diameter prestressing strands on 2 -inch <b>centers.</b> The <b>girders</b> were designed assuming a 28 -day compressive strength of 10, 500 psi. Later, a 4 -foot-wide and 9 -inch-thick composite concrete deck was added to each girder using unshored construction techniques. The shear test results were compared with predicted results from ACI 318 - 95 Simplified Method, ACI 318 - 95 Detailed Method (AASHTO 1989), Modified ACI 318 - 95 Procedure, Modified Compression Field Theory (AASHTO LRFD 1994), Modified Truss Theory, Truss Theory, Horizontal Shear Design (AASHTO 1989), and Shear Friction (AASHTO LRFD 1994). The calculated shear capacities were in all cases conservative compared to the actual shear capacity. Minnesota Department of Transportatio...|$|R
5000|$|The Talbot Avenue {{bridge in}} Montgomery County, Maryland, is an {{historic}} one-lane metal girder bridge that connects Lyttonsville and downtown Silver Spring. Originally built in 1918, {{with a new}} deck added in 1986, it crosses the CSX railroad tracks between Hanover Street and Lanier Drive. The structure is 106 feet long and 14.5 feet wide, from timber curb to curb and an out-to-out width of 18 feet. The greater structure consists of a through-plate <b>girder</b> in the <b>center</b> span, rolled <b>girders</b> in the end spans, timber floor beams, a wood plank deck and a timber railing. A 1993 inspection report indicated the structure was in fair to poor condition with cracking, corrosion and section loss. The wood and steel on the bridge has been in disrepair, making it a hard keep intact.|$|R
50|$|The {{bridge is}} a bascule bridge in a Scherzer {{rolling lift bridge}} configuration. The bridge's three spans are steel deck girders; the <b>center</b> span has <b>girders</b> of varying depth while the {{approach}} spans have uniform-depth <b>girders.</b> The <b>center</b> bascule span is 70 ft long, flanked by two 42 ft spans. The approach span road surface {{is a mixture of}} asphalt and concrete while the center span is a steel mesh. The 40 ft roadway is flanked by 5 ft sidewalks and standard moderne metal guard rails. On the downstream side of the north pier is the single-story bridge tender's house. When raised, a 60 ft navigable channel is available for marine vessels. The concrete abutments are founded on timber pilings and the two concrete piers rest on concrete footings supported by compact gravel 27 ft below the river surface. The piers are protected by angled cutwaters and cylindrical fenders upriver. The bridge was notable for its safety features. It has six light standards (three to a side) along its length for illumination. Traffic gates and traffic lights warn traffic when the bridge will rise for vessels.|$|R
40|$|Since 2009 an Alignment Diagnostic System (ADS) {{has been}} {{operating}} at the undulator of the new Linac Coherent Light Source at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. The undulator spans a distance of 132 meters and is structured into 33 segments. Each segment is equipped with four hydrostatic leveling sensors and four wire position monitors. This report describes the set up and reflects the experience gained with the ADS. UNDULATOR SYSTEM The purpose of the undulator system is to enable the Self Amplified Spontaneous Emission (SASE) process, {{which is based on}} the interaction between an electron bunch and its spontaneous undulator radiation [1]. The undulator system comprises 33 girders each containing one undulator magnet and one quadrupole. The undulator magnet can be moved {{in and out of the}} beam with so called x-translation stages and the whole girder can be moved in five degrees of freedom with cam movers. Each girder is equipped with four hydrostatic leveling sensors (HLS) and four wire position monitors (WPM), see Fig. 1. The solution was to track the X, Y and Roll parameters for both ends of each girder and calculate the deviations relative to the least square fit of all girders with a resolution of one micrometer over a time period of several weeks. Building Blocks of the ADS The HLS sensors â€  measure the vertical position of the sensors relative to the water surface of a half filled 2 inch diameter pipe running along the <b>center</b> of the <b>girders.</b> Three of the sensors are capacitance based and one is ultrasound based. The WPM sensors â€¡ measure their position relative to a stretched wire. Two wires are stretched along the entire undulator length of 140 meters. The wire- embedded inside a conductive tube- works as an RF transmitter while the sensor consists of four RF receivers. Comparing the RF receiver responses allows calculation of the vertical and horizontal wire position relative to the sensor. Undulator magne...|$|R
