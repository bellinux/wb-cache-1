40|$|Equilibrium {{transport}} {{properties of}} a single-level quantum dot tunnel-coupled to ferromagnetic leads and exchange-coupled {{to a side}} nonmagnetic reservoir are analyzed theoretically in the Kondo regime. The equilibrium spectral functions and conductance through the dot are calculated using the numerical renormalization group (NRG) method. It is shown that in the antiparallel magnetic configuration, the system undergoes a quantum phase transition with increasing exchange coupling $J$, where the conductance drops from its maximum value to zero. In the parallel configuration, on the other hand, the conductance is generally suppressed due to an effective spin splitting of the dot level caused {{by the presence of}} ferromagnetic leads, irrespective of the strength of exchange constant. However, for $J$ ranging from J= 0 up to the corresponding critical value, the Kondo effect and quantum critical behavior can be restored by applying properly tuned <b>compensating</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field.</b> Comment: (8 pages, 8 figs) to appear in PR...|$|E

40|$|Nonlinear {{effects from}} {{insertion}} devices are potentially a limiting {{factor for the}} electron beam quality of modern ring-based light sources, i. e., the on and off-dynamical aperture, leading to reduced injection efficiency and beam lifetime. These effects can be modelled by e. g. kick maps ({approx} 1 /{gamma}{sup 2 }) and controlled by e. g. first-order thin or thick magnetic kicks introduced by 'magic fingers,' 'L-shims,' or 'current strips'. However, due to physical or technological constraints, these corrections are typically only partial. Therefore, a precise model is needed to correctly minimize the residual nonlinear effects for the entire system. We outline a systematic method for integrated design and rapid prototyping based on evaluation of the 3 D <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> {{and control of the}} local trajectory with RADIA, and particle tracking with Tracy- 3 for validation.

The control and the power stages of the driver, both based on a push-pull configuration with high-speed transistors, are separated, allowing for a protection of the control electronics. Moreover, the coil current can be set by an analog voltage, a feature that makes possible both fast and adiabatic switching of the quadrupole <b>magnetic</b> <b>field.</b> In order to <b>compensate</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> transients induced by eddy currents, the driver allows a quick reversal of the quadrupole coil current providing {{in such a way}} the required magnetic flux compensation. From a fit to the measured <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> transients, we have extracted the decay constants which confirm the efficiency of the compensation. Furthermore, we measured the influence of eddy currents on a sample of cold caesium atoms, testing {{at the same time the}} ultimate performance of the driver for our applications.

40|$|While a {{torsion balance}} in vacuum can easily measure the {{momentum}} transfer from a gas beam impinging on a surface {{attached to the}} balance, this measurement depends on the accommodation coefficients of the atoms with the surface {{and the distribution of}} the recoil. A torsion balance is described for making absolute flux measurements independent of recoil effects. The torsion balance is a conventional taut suspension wire design and the Young modulus of the wire determines the relationship between the displacement and the applied torque. A <b>compensating</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> is applied to maintain zero displacement and provide critical damping. The unique feature is to couple the impinging gas beam to the torsion balance via a Wood's horn, i. e., a thin wall tube with a gradual 90 deg bend. Just as light is trapped in a Wood's horn by specular reflection from the curved surfaces, the gas beam diffuses through the tube. Instead of trapping the beam, the end of the tube is open so that the atoms exit the tube at 90 deg to their original direction. Therefore, all of the forward momentum of the gas beam is transferred to the torsion balance independent of the angle of reflection from the surfaces inside the tube...|$|E
40|$|The SHiP {{experiment}} (Search for Hidden Particles) is a {{beam dump}} experiment proposed at the CERN SPS with the submission of a Technical Proposal in April 2015. SHiP aims at {{the observation of}} long lived particles very weakly coupled with ordinary matter. These particles are mostly produced in the decay of charmed hadrons whose production is therefore enhanced through {{the definition of the}} characteristics of both the beam and the proton target. This makes the SHiP experiment a Standard Model neutrino factory too, in particular of tau neutrinos produced by the Ds decay chain. My studies have mainly focused on the design of the neutrino detector and on the evaluation of its performances. The Neutrino Detector is placed in a magnetic field and it exploits the Emulsion Cloud Chamber Technology with the micrometric position resolution needed to disentangle the tau lepton decay vertex from the neutrino interaction vertex. This peculiarity, together with the high electron identification efficiency, makes this detector also suitable to search for sub-GeV Dark Matter (produced in the decay of the dark photon) through its scattering with the electrons in the emulsion target. The main unit of the Neutrino Detector is the brick (lead plates interleaved with emulsion films) followed downstream by a Compact Emulsion Spectrometer (CES, 3 emulsion films interleaved with light material) needed to measure the charge and momentum of hadrons produced in neutrino interactions and short lived particles decays. A Muon Magnetic Spectrometer is placed immediately downstream to measure the charge and the momentum of muons produced in charged current muon neutrino interactions or in tau to muon decays. In this thesis the signal and background yield for all the different neutrino flavours are presented: more than twenty thousand nutau and nutau-bar charged current interactions are expected in five years of data taking. This unprecedented statistics of tau neutrinos will allow to measure the structure functions F 4 and F 5 entering the neutrino-nucleon cross section. The SHiP performances in the measurement of the tau neutrino anomalous magnetic moment are also reported with the estimation of the background yield for this searches. A preliminary estimate of the background events expected for LDM searches is also shown. Detailed studies will be performed with more general assumptions on the dark photon and the dark matter masses. Thanks to the large flux of electron and muon neutrinos interacting in the neutrino target, the measurement of the strange quark content of the nucleon has also been studied. The second to last chapter of the thesis is devoted to the description of the optimisation studies which are on going in view of the production of a Comprehensive Design Report to hand in to the CERN SPS Committee by the end of 2018. In this optimised version of the SHiP detector, the Neutrino Detector is roughly 20 m closer to the proton target, with a resulting increment in the incoming neutrino flux. However, being closer to the proton target has also generated the need for a complete redesign of the detector layout to fit the muon free region. A study of muon background rates on the Neutrino Detector and on the downstream Muon Magnetic Spectrometer is also reported. The last chapter describes the Test Beam activities conducted at CERN to study the performances of both the Compact Emulsion Spectrometer and of the gaseous electronic detectors (GEM) which complement the Neutrino Detector. The data analysis was carried out in the Napoli Emulsion Laboratory. The test beam for the CES has led us to discard the option of using the Rohacell as a light material interleaved to the emulsion films. The test beam with the GEM-emulsion coupled detector has shown a rapid degradation of the GEM performances in terms of position resolution when dealing with inclined tracks also in absence of magnetic field. The degradation is enhanced when the polarisation of the magnetic field contributes to the avalanche displacement. In case of a <b>compensating</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field,</b> the position resolution shows the same behaviour as in absence of field, except for a phase-shift of 15 degrees corresponding to the Lorentz angle of the generated electron avalanche...|$|E

40|$|Axisymmetric mirrors have no {{collision}} free radial transport, but such <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> may {{have problems with}} plasma stability (the tearing instability in particular). There are some means to improve plasma stability in axisymmetric mirrors by magnetic expander tanks or axisymmetric divertors, but plasma stability can still be a challenge in axisymmetric mirrors. An alternative is to use quadrupolar <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> as a robust method to overcome the stability issues. A price may then be increased radial transport if the <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> design is done without strict consideration of asymmetries, which could result from manufacturing errors. The computations have been done with a hybrid reactor scenario in mind. Such a case have less demands for confinement, but the demands are still challenging. Confinement for about 200 longitudinal bounces is required in a hybrid reactor. The computations carried out here have confirmed that axial asymmetry may become dangerous for plasma confinement in quadrupolar mirror machines. Asymmetry {{in the range of}} a few percentage relative error will almost surely result in a too strong radial leakage (at least without a radial electric field). The computational results made in this paper may suggest that if the manufacturing error is kept below 0. 15 % relative error throughout the plasma confinement region, there is then a some margin for sufficient radial confinement quality.

However, for different parameter sets (l_ 1,l_ 2), this "local-type" reduced bispectrum oscillates around different asymptotic values in the high-l_ 3 regime because of the effect of the Lorentz force, which is exerted by the primordial <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> on the charged baryons.

In the high-l regime, this amplitude is approximately equal to that of the first estimator, but with a reversal phase. Comment: 37 pages, 11 figures, version published in JHE...|$|R
