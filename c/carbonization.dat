25|$|NASA {{assumed the}} torn metal would be bright. Surprisingly, the Solwind pieces {{turned out to}} appear so dark as to be almost undetectable. Only two pieces were seen. NASA Scientists theorized that the {{unexpected}} Solwind darkening was due to <b>carbonization</b> of organic compounds in the target satellite; that is, when the kinetic energy of the projectile became heat energy on impact, the plastics inside Solwind vaporized and condensed on the metal pieces as soot.|$|E
25|$|In {{fulguration}} mode, {{the electrode}} is held {{away from the}} tissue, {{so that when the}} air gap between the electrode and the tissue is ionized, an electric arc discharge develops. In this approach the burning to the tissue is more superficial, because the current is spread over the tissue area larger than the tip of electrode. Under these conditions, superficial skin charring or <b>carbonization</b> is seen over a wider area than when operating in contact with the probe, and this technique is therefore used for very superficial or protrusive lesions such as skin tags. Ionization of an air gap requires voltage in the kV range.|$|E
25|$|Coal {{can also}} be {{converted}} into synthetic fuels equivalent to gasoline or diesel by several different direct processes (which do not intrinsically require gasification or indirect conversion). In the direct liquefaction processes, the coal is either hydrogenated or carbonized. Hydrogenation processes are the Bergius process, the SRC-I and SRC-II (Solvent Refined Coal) processes, the NUS Corporation hydrogenation process and several other single-stage and two-stage processes. In the process of low-temperature <b>carbonization,</b> coal is coked at temperatures between 360 and 750°C (680 and 1,380°F). These temperatures optimize the production of coal tars richer in lighter hydrocarbons than normal coal tar. The coal tar is then further processed into fuels. An overview of coal liquefaction and its future potential is available.|$|E
25|$|At {{various times}} in the {{geologic}} past, the Earth had dense forests in low-lying wetland areas. Due to natural processes such as flooding, these forests were buried underneath soil. As more and more soil deposited over them, they were compressed. The temperature also rose as they sank deeper and deeper. As the process continued the plant matter was protected from biodegradation and oxidation, usually by mud or acidic water. This trapped the carbon in immense peat bogs that were eventually covered and deeply buried by sediments. Under high pressure and high temperature, dead vegetation was slowly converted to coal. As coal contains mainly carbon, the conversion of dead vegetation into coal is called <b>carbonization.</b>|$|E
25|$|This {{downward}} trend {{has been demonstrated}} by the conflicts between various agencies and levels of government. This has allowed wood traders to shop for export clearance among the authorities that regulate it. As {{a result of this}} bribery to open periodic trade windows, large-scale exports of illegal precious woods clear customs without much difficulty. Because of the incredibly lucrative nature of recent trades, reports have indicated that government officials have significantly increased the price of export certificates to make more money for themselves. This however has not stopped exporters from re-using single-use export certificates for two or three containers of rosewood. Furthermore, some of the certificates and authorizations from various government agencies bear titles found nowhere in any legal text, such as permis de ramassage and permis de carbonisation (collection permit and <b>carbonization</b> permit respectively). Such authorizations are not supported by and clearly conflict with Malagasy law.|$|E

2500|$|Chemical activation: Prior to <b>carbonization,</b> the raw {{material}} is impregnated with certain chemicals. [...] The chemical is typically an acid, strong base, or a salt (phosphoric acid, potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, calcium chloride, and zinc chloride 25%). Then, the {{raw material}} is carbonized at lower temperatures (450–900°C). It is believed that the <b>carbonization</b> / activation step proceeds simultaneously with the chemical activation. Chemical activation is preferred over physical activation owing to the lower temperatures and shorter time needed for activating material.|$|E
2500|$|Activated carbon can be {{manufactured}} from carbonaceous material, including coal (bituminous, subbituminous, and lignite), peat, wood, or nutshells (e.g., coconut). The manufacturing process {{consists of two}} phases, <b>carbonization</b> and activation. The <b>carbonization</b> process includes drying and then heating to separate by-products, including tars and other hydrocarbons from the raw material, {{as well as to}} drive off any gases generated. The process is completed by heating the material over [...] in an oxygen-free atmosphere that cannot support combustion. The carbonized particles are then [...] "activated" [...] by exposing them to an oxidizing agent, usually steam or carbon dioxide at high temperature. This agent burns off the pore blocking structures created during the <b>carbonization</b> phase and so, they develop a porous, three-dimensional graphite lattice structure. The size of the pores developed during activation {{is a function of the}} time that they spend in this stage. Longer exposure times result in larger pore sizes. The most popular aqueous phase carbons are bituminous based because of their hardness, abrasion resistance, pore size distribution, and low cost, but their effectiveness needs to be tested in each application to determine the optimal product.|$|E
2500|$|With {{respect to}} wood preservatives, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) {{considers}} the term creosote {{to mean a}} pesticide {{for use as a}} wood preservative meeting the American Wood Protection Association (AWPA) Standards P1/P13 and P2. The AWPA Standards require that creosote “shall be a pure coal tar product derived entirely from tar produced by the <b>carbonization</b> of bituminous coal.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The rise of {{the steel}} {{industry}} during the Industrial Revolution brought about an exponential increase in the demand for coke, a fuel derived from the <b>carbonization</b> of coal that was used primarily {{in the production of}} pig iron. [...] The Dunlap coke facility, which converted coal mined atop Fredonia Mountain into coke for use in blast furnaces in nearby Chattanooga, brought drastic change and modernization to Dunlap and the central Sequatchie Valley, the economy of which had long been based on subsistence agriculture. [...] While the ovens themselves are all that remain from Dunlap's coke production operations, the Sequatchie Valley Historical Society has redeveloped the coke ovens area into a substantial public park and museum.|$|E
2500|$|These {{people were}} all {{caught on the}} former {{seashore}} by the first surge and died of thermal shock but not of <b>carbonization,</b> although some were partly carbonized by later and hotter surges. The arched vaults were most likely boathouses, as the crossbeams in the overhead were probably for the suspension of boats. No boats have been found, indicating {{they may have been}} used for the earlier escape of some of the population. The rest were concentrated in the chambers at a density of as high as 3 persons per square meter. As only [...] of the coast have been excavated, the casualties waiting to be excavated may well be as high as the thousands.|$|E
2500|$|Laser {{medicine}}: {{medicine and}} especially dentistry have found many new uses for diode lasers. The shrinking size {{and cost of}} the units and their increasing user friendliness makes them very attractive to clinicians for minor soft tissue procedures. Diode wavelengths range from 810 [...] to 1,100 nm, are poorly absorbed by soft tissue, and are not used for cutting or ablation. Soft tissue is not cut by the laser’s beam, but is instead cut by contact with a hot charred glass tip. The laser’s irradiation is highly absorbed at the distal end of the tip and heats it up to 500°C to 900°C. [...] Because the tip is so hot, {{it can be used}} to cut soft-tissue and can cause hemostasis through cauterization and <b>carbonization.</b> Diode lasers when used on soft tissue can cause extensive collateral thermal damage to surrounding tissue.|$|E
2500|$|Appropriately {{applied with}} electro {{surgical}} forceps, desiccation and coagulation {{result in the}} occlusion of blood vessels and halting of bleeding. While the process is technically a process of electrocoagulation, the term [...] "electrocautery" [...] is sometimes loosely, nontechnically and incorrectly used to describe it. The process of vaporization {{can be used to}} ablate tissue targets, or, by linear extension, used to transect or cut tissue. While the processes of vaporization/ cutting and desiccation/coagulation are best accomplished with relatively low voltage, continuous or near continuous waveforms, the process of fulguration is performed with relatively high voltage modulated waveforms. Fulguration is a superficial type of coagulation, typically created by arcing modulated high voltage current to tissue that is rapidly desiccated and coagulated. The continued application of current to this highly impedant tissue results in resistive heating and the achievement of very high temperatures - enough to cause breakdown of the organic molecules to sugars and even carbon, thus the dark textures from <b>carbonization</b> of tissue.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{diesel car}} engines are {{suitable}} {{for the use of}} straight vegetable oil (SVO), also commonly called pure plant oil (PPO), with certain modifications. Principally, the viscosity and surface tension of the SVO/PPO must be reduced by preheating it, typically by using waste heat from the engine or electricity, otherwise poor atomization, incomplete combustion and <b>carbonization</b> may result. One common solution is to add a heat exchanger and an additional fuel tank for the petrodiesel or biodiesel blend and to switch between this additional tank and the main tank of SVO/PPO. [...] The engine is started on diesel, switched over to vegetable oil as soon as it is warmed up and switched back to diesel shortly before being switched off to ensure that no vegetable oil remains in the engine or fuel lines when it is started from cold again. In colder climates it is often necessary to heat the vegetable oil fuel lines and tank as it can become very viscous and even solidify.|$|E
60|$|But, in one and {{the same}} slice, every {{transition}} can be observed from this structure to that which has been described as characteristic of ordinary coal. The latter appears to rise out of the former, by the breaking-up and increasing <b>carbonization</b> of the larger and the smaller sacs. And, in the anthracitic coals, this process appears to have gone to such a length, as to destroy the original structure altogether, and to replace it by a completely carbonized substance.|$|E

50|$|<b>Carbonization</b> (or carbonisation) is {{the term}} for the {{conversion}} of an organic substance into carbon or a carbon-containing residue through pyrolysis or destructive distillation. It is often used in organic chemistry {{with reference to the}} generation of coal gas and coal tar from raw coal. Fossil fuels generally are the products of the <b>carbonization</b> of vegetable matter. The term <b>carbonization</b> is also applied to the pyrolysis of coal to produce coke. <b>Carbonization</b> is also a stage in the charcoal making process, and is considered the most important step of all since it has such power to influence the whole process from the growing tree to the final distribution of charcoal to various sources.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the most}} common {{variables}} of the biomass briquette production process is the way the biomass is dried out. Manufacturers can use torrefaction, <b>carbonization,</b> or varying degrees of pyrolysis.

50|$|Coal is {{introduced}} {{from the top}} to produce an even layer of about 60 - 90 cm deep. Air is supplied initially to ignite the coal. <b>Carbonization</b> starts and produces volatile matter, which burns inside the partially closed side door. <b>Carbonization</b> proceeds {{from top to bottom}} and is completed in two to three days. Heat is supplied by the burning volatile matter so no by-products are recovered. The exhaust gases are allowed to escape to the atmosphere. The hot coke is quenched with water and discharged, manually through the side door. The walls and roof retain enough heat to initiate <b>carbonization</b> of the next charge.|$|E
5000|$|The typical {{example of}} <b>carbonization</b> is the Karrick process. In this {{low-temperature}} <b>carbonization</b> process, coal is heated at [...] to [...] {{in the absence}} of air.
