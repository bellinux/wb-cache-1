5|$|Black {{adopted a}} {{narrower}} {{interpretation of the}} Fourth Amendment than {{many of his colleagues}} on the Warren Court. He dissented from Katz v. United States (1967), in which the Court held that warrantless wiretapping violated the Fourth Amendment's guarantee against unreasonable search and seizure. He argued that the Fourth Amendment only protected tangible items from physical searches or seizures. Thus, he concluded that telephone <b>conversations</b> <b>were</b> not within the scope of the amendment, and that warrantless wiretapping was consequently permissible.|$|E
5|$|This {{was not an}} {{encouraging}} start for the operation but despite this, the LCS decided {{to continue with the}} deception. Colonel Thornton's trip was approved and he travelled to Stockholm toward the end of April. Thornton spent two weeks in Sweden, meeting {{with the head of the}} Royal Swedish Air Force, General Bengt Nordenskiöld. The conferences were treated with a high degree of secrecy in the hope this would emphasise their importance. It had the required effect; Thornton's <b>conversations</b> <b>were</b> recorded by a pro-German chief of police and forwarded to Germany. Despite siding with the Allies, Nordenskiöld communicated very little sensitive information to Thornton. Nordenskiöld was convinced that the Allies intended to invade Norway, but he kept this conviction to himself, contrary to Allied hopes. Thornton returned to England on 30 April.|$|E
25|$|Some of the <b>conversations</b> <b>were</b> {{little more}} than gossip, and they spoke of their contemporaries without restraint. When the <b>conversations</b> <b>were</b> published, some of those contemporaries were outraged. Northcote denied the words were his; and Hazlitt was {{shielded}} from the consequences to a degree by his residing in Paris, where he was at work on what he thought would be his masterpiece.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. One of {{the primary}} tools of {{collective}} intelligence <b>is</b> <b>conversation.</b> Conversation takes many forms, from interactive storytelling, to an emerging lingua franca of structured conversation, Issue-based information systems (IBIS) and related forms of contested discourse. Conversation federation facilitates improved collective intelligence for sensemaking and for decision making. Federating <b>conversations</b> <b>is</b> performed through topic mapping processes where <b>conversations</b> <b>are</b> organized around the subjects they entail. While each <b>conversation</b> <b>is,</b> itself, a subject, each <b>conversation</b> <b>is</b> about one or more subjects. Structured conversations created in IBIS settings are typically rooted in a central topic or central question (issue). Where <b>conversations</b> <b>are</b> about the same topic or issue, they federate—that is, they are combined through a topic mapping merge process that maintains a well-organized map of the combined conversations. A goal that animates collective intelligence is collective wisdom; making wise decisions. We describe a platform aimed to serve such a goal...|$|R

25|$|The Post Office {{commenced}} its telephone {{business in}} 1878, however {{the vast majority}} of telephones were initially connected to independently run networks. In December 1880, the Post Master General obtained a court judgement that telephone <b>conversations</b> <b>were,</b> technically, within the remit of the Telegraph Act. The General Post Office then licensed all existing telephone networks.|$|E
25|$|Furtwängler {{was offered}} the {{principal}} conductor's post at the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, which was then the most desirable and best paid position in international musical life. He was to have followed Arturo Toscanini, who had declared that Furtwängler was the only man to succeed him. Furtwängler accepted the post, but his telephone <b>conversations</b> <b>were</b> recorded by the Gestapo.|$|E
25|$|In 1929 Ramsey and Wittgenstein {{regularly}} discussed {{issues in}} mathematics and philosophy with Piero Sraffa, an Italian economist who {{had been brought to}} Cambridge by Keynes after Sraffa had aroused Benito Mussolini's ire by publishing an article critical of the Fascist regime in the Manchester Guardian. The contributions of Ramsey to these <b>conversations</b> <b>were</b> acknowledged by both Sraffa and Wittgenstein in their later work.|$|E
50|$|Playful {{and happy}} <b>conversation</b> <b>is</b> {{the main focus}} of {{activity}} in third places, although it is not required to be the only activity. The tone of <b>conversation</b> <b>is</b> usually light hearted and humorous; wit and good natured playfulness are highly valued.|$|R
25|$|The {{foundation}} of this theory is {{the concepts of}} text and <b>conversation.</b> Text <b>is</b> defined as the content of interaction, or what is said in an interaction. Text is the meaning made available to individuals through a face-to-face or electronic mode of communication. <b>Conversation</b> <b>is</b> defined as what is happening behaviorally between two or more participants in the communication process. <b>Conversation</b> <b>is</b> the exchange or interaction itself.|$|R
40|$|An online <b>conversation</b> <b>is</b> {{not very}} {{different}} from the <b>conversations</b> people have <b>been</b> having for thousands of years. Topics are introduced, ideas are shared, and sometimes enlightenment is forthcoming. The difference <b>is</b> that these <b>conversations</b> <b>are</b> sometimes recorded and archived for future use. The knowledge that is created and shared in <b>conversations</b> can therefore <b>be</b> preserved and later accessed by people who did not participate in the original discussion. Another difference is that many non-verbal cues that we are used to interpreting in faceto-face <b>conversations</b> <b>are</b> missing. Contextual information about where <b>conversation</b> partners <b>are</b> located and what they are doing is also reduced. Consequently, the knowledge that we exchange via online textual <b>conversations</b> <b>is</b> primarily explicit; tacit knowledge tends to be thin if present at all. Examples of &quot;on-line conversations &quot; include personal electronic mail, mailing lists, instant messaging (IM), Short Message Service (SMS) notes, chat rooms, Usenet newsgroups, threaded Web-based discussion lists, and massive multi-player on-line role playing games (MMORPG).

25|$|In March 2006, {{immediately}} after allegations emerged that Falun Gong prisoners were being targeted for organ harvesting, overseas investigators began placing {{phone calls to}} Chinese hospitals and police detention centers. The callers posed as prospective transplant recipients or organ brokers and inquired about the availability of Falun Gong organs. In several instances, they obtained recorded admissions that organs could be procured from Falun Gong prisoners. A selection of these <b>conversations</b> <b>were</b> cited as evidence in the report by David Kilgour and David Matas.|$|E
25|$|The National Football League (NFL) {{was also}} {{interested}} in placing a team at the Met. <b>Conversations</b> <b>were</b> had with Violet Bidwill Wolfner, owner of the Chicago Cardinals, about moving her team to the stadium. The Cardinals moved two of their regular season home games against the Philadelphia Eagles (October 25) (att: 20,112) and New York Giants (November 22) (att: 26,625) to Bloomington for the 1959 NFL season. A preseason football game was held each year at the Met from 1956 to 1960.|$|E
25|$|According to an {{internal}} police report leaked in 2007, Fantino, as superintendent of detectives in 1991, had ordered a wiretap of lawyer Peter Maloney a police critic and friend of Susan Eng, chair of the Toronto Police Services Board, the body overseeing the Toronto Police service. Conversations between Maloney and Eng were illegally recorded despite a court order that only the first minute of Maloney's <b>conversations</b> <b>were</b> to be monitored so as {{to determine whether the}} individual who he was talking to was on the list of those being investigated.|$|E

25|$|The matrix in the {{following}} table shows how Brasel and colleagues found that the teachers combined these four questions to learn about two dimensions of teaching: student thinking and instruction. The authors found that while the most productive collaborative discussions—that allowed the teachers {{to learn more about}} mathematics content, students and pedagogy—focused more on why and how, the teachers tended to address only the first two questions, what and to whom. While these <b>conversations</b> <b>were</b> helpful in identifying students in need of remediation, they did little in the way to improve instruction in the long run.|$|E
25|$|Prisoners {{who were}} thought to possess {{significant}} technical or strategic information were brought to specialist intelligence-gathering facilities at Fort Hunt, Virginia or Camp Tracy, California. After arriving in these camps, the prisoners were interrogated again, and their <b>conversations</b> <b>were</b> wiretapped and analysed. Some of the conditions at Camp Tracy violated Geneva Convention requirements, such as insufficient exercise time being provided. However, prisoners at this camp were given special benefits, such as high quality food and access to a shop, and the interrogation sessions were relatively relaxed. The continuous wiretapping at both locations may have also violated {{the spirit of the}} Geneva Convention.|$|E
25|$|In 1439 Fra Angelico {{completed}} one of {{his most}} famous works, the San Marco Altarpiece at Florence. The result was unusual for its time. Images of the enthroned Madonna and Child surrounded by saints were common, but they usually depicted a setting that was clearly heaven-like, in which saints and angels hovered about as divine presences rather than people. But in this instance, the saints stand squarely within the space, grouped in a natural way as if they were able to converse about the shared experience of witnessing the Virgin in glory. Paintings such as this, known as Sacred <b>Conversations,</b> <b>were</b> to become the major commissions of Giovanni Bellini, Perugino and Raphael.|$|E

25|$|The 10 German {{scientists}} {{were held at}} Farm Hall in England. The facility had been a safe house of the British foreign intelligence MI6.

The transcripts were released in 1992. Bernstein has published an annotated version of the transcripts in his book Hitler's Uranium Club: The Secret Recordings at Farm Hall, along with an introduction {{to put them in}} perspective. A complete, unedited publication of the British version of the reports appeared as Operation Epsilon: The Farm Hall Transcripts, which was published in 1993 by the Institute of Physics in Bristol and by the University of California Press in the US.|$|E
25|$|Kapuściński's {{views on}} his craft were {{published}} in 2000 in the book in Italian Il cinico non è adatto a questo mestiere: conversazioni sul buon giornalismo (A Cynic wouldn't Suit This Profession: Conversations about Good Journalism), the book in Spanish from 2003 (distributed for free) Los cinco sentidos del periodista (estar, ver, oír, compartir, pensar) (The Journalist’s Five Senses: Witnessing, Seeing, Listening, Sharing and Thinking) and in his Polish book Autoportret reportera (A Reporter's Self Portrait) published the same year. In 1987 Marek Miller talked with Kapuściński {{on the art of}} reportage and his life. These <b>conversations</b> <b>were</b> published in Poland in 2012 in the book Pisanie (Writing) but broadcast in Canada on Kalejdoskop Polski TV as early as 1988.

25|$|John Dean {{testified in}} June 1973 that Nixon was deeply {{involved}} in the Watergate cover-up, and mentioned that he suspected White House <b>conversations</b> <b>were</b> taped. Staff of the United States Senate Watergate Committee thereafter began to routinely ask witnesses appearing before the committee if they knew of any taping system. Senate Watergate Committee staff then asked the White House for a list of dates on which the President had met with Dean. About June 20 or 21, Special White House Counsel for Watergate J. Fred Buzhardt provided the committee's Chief Minority (Republican) Counsel, Fred Thompson, with a document intended to impugn Dean's testimony. Buzhardt's document included almost verbatim quotations from meetings Nixon had with Dean. Thompson initially violated an agreement under which the majority and minority staff would share all information. When committee Majority Investigator Scott Armstrong obtained the document, he realized the document indicated the existence of a taping system.|$|E

25|$|While {{these two}} methodologies did help to {{eliminate}} {{some of the}} possible biases of the original studies, they still operated {{under the assumption that}} there is a causal link between the emotional experience and the development of the process of social sharing. Therefore, a true experimental method was used to study the phenomenon. In these studies, two friends came together to the laboratory, and they were then split up. One of the subjects watched an excerpt of one of three films: either from a documentary about animals (weak emotion), a violent scene between animals (moderate emotion), or a scene depicting humans committing cruel acts towards animals (strong emotion). During this time, the other subject was given a trivial task to complete. Then, the two subjects were reunited and asked to wait a few minutes for the next part of the experiment. During this time, their <b>conversations</b> <b>were</b> recorded and analyzed for the presence of social sharing. All of these methods produced similar results; social sharing was found to occur for 88–96% of emotional events.|$|E

500|$|Famitsu was {{positive}} {{on how the}} new narrative elements and support <b>conversations</b> <b>were</b> incorporated into the existing narrative. RPGamer's Mike Moehnke felt the additional dialogue unnecessary, as the story's complexity had not noticeably increased over the original version. He also positively noted how the Avatar was incorporated into the story, with the added chapters revolving around them making them [...] "far more than a throwaway". 4Gamer.net's Kojiro Nishioka likewise praised {{the inclusion of the}} BS Fire Emblem chapters and the new prologue and side chapters, but felt that those who had not played Shadow Dragon would be unable to understand some of the characters.|$|E
50|$|Conversations follow {{rules of}} {{etiquette}} because <b>conversations</b> <b>are</b> social interactions, and therefore depend on social convention.
