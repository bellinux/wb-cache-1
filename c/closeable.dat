50|$|The Jewish {{graveyard}} in Bretzenheim {{might have}} been laid out {{as long ago as}} the 17th century. It was supposedly expanded sometime towards the middle of the 18th century. Other information, however, points to the graveyard’s beginnings falling in “Prussian times” (after the Congress of Vienna and before Unification, and thus between 1815 and 1871), especially as the graveyard’s area is precisely one Prussian Morgen. The oldest preserved gravestone bears the date 25 November 1863, whereas the newest bears the date 24 September 1932. Still preserved at the graveyard are ten single graves and three double graves. In the time of the Third Reich, the graveyard was not removed: the then mayor, Karl Schmidt, after statements made by Hedwig Graf née Schweig, a Jewish woman married to an Evangelical man and who survived the Nazis in Bretzenheim, opposed the authorities’ demands to obliterate the graveyard. Nevertheless, in 1941/1942, the gravestones were overturned, some of them were stolen, and then in the village they were used as flooring or paving stones. In early 1945, 38 concentration camp prisoners were buried at the graveyard, having died as {{part of a group of}} some 500 other prisoners who found themselves doing forced labour in the Bad Kreuznach area towards the end of the war. These prisoners were nationals of various European nations, and some were prisoners of war. They had to do their work, commanded by an SS building brigade, under catastrophic living and dietary conditions. Many died of hunger or illnesses, or were murdered. The people who had been buried at the Bretzenheim Jewish graveyard were exhumed and newly buried at a graveyard of honour at the Bad Kreuznach town cemetery in October 1948, and then in August 1952 at their own graveyard of honour, one for the victims of fascism at the French cemetery. The Bretzenheim Jewish graveyard had to be reconstructed in January 1946 - by former Nazi Party members. Overturned gravestones were once again set upright, trees were trimmed, hedges were removed and the path was made passable once more. In 1951, the graveyard was transferred to the Jewish worship community for the districts of Kreuznach and Birkenfeld. In 1959, the makeshift fence that had been standing at the graveyard was replaced with a trelliswork fence and a <b>closeable</b> gate was installed. The graveyard’s area is, according to different sources, 2 186 or 2 255 m², the latter being one Prussian Morgen. The graveyard lies at the municipal limit between Bretzenheim and Bad Kreuznach in the zone known as “Johanneshohl” (in the rural cadastral area called “Auf dem Galgen”).|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Two new concepts, closeability {{with respect}} to a set of pe-riodic points and linkability of a set of {{periodic}} points of a dynamical system are introduced. Examples are provided to show that closeabil-ity and linkability are independent properties. Both properties together imply that the set of invariant measures is either a single periodic orbit or the Poulsen simplex — the unique non-trivial Choquet simplex in which extreme points are dense. Moreover, under these conditions ev-ery invariant measure has a generic point and an extension of Sigmund’s theorem about generic properties of invariant measures still holds. The periodic specification property implies closeability and linkability for the set of periodic points. The methods apply beyond systems with specification, because all beta-shifts, all S-gap shifts, and many other dynamical systems are <b>closeable</b> {{with respect to}} some linkable sets of periodic points.

40|$|Insects show a large {{variety in}} prey capture strategies, with a {{correspondingly}} large diversity in predatory adaptations. We studied {{a specific type}} of predatory claws, these can for example be found in praying mantis species. The claw is <b>closeable</b> over its entire length and the prey is fixed between the femur (upper arm) and the tibia (lower arm) of the insect leg. The morphology of these predatory claws is diverse. Some species have straight claws covered with spines, while other species have smooth, curved claws. We have studied the mechanics of this femur-tibia type of predatory insect claws, by making a physical model, eventually trying to explain why in some insect species the claws are curved instead of straight. The main results are (1) when comparing curved claws to straight claws, curvature leads to a strong reduction of forces driving the prey away from the pivoting point, thereby reducing the need for friction generating structures. (2) In the curved claw model a position exists where the resulting force on the prey is exactly zero. This is because the normal forces on the femur and tibia are opposed, and in line. At this position the prey is perfectly clamped and not driven out of the claw. This feature does not exist in straight claws. (3) In the curved claw, the prey cannot be placed at a position further than a certain maximum distance from the pivoting point. Near this maximum position, the resulting force on the prey reaches high values because moment arms are near zero. (4) Between the zero position and the maximum position the resulting force is directed toward the pivoting point, which stabilizes prey fixation...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a new {{concentrating solar power}} central receiver system with integral thermal storage. Hillside mounted heliostats direct sunlight into a volumetric absorption molten salt pool, which also functions as a single tank assisted thermocline storage system. Concentrated light penetrates the molten salt and is absorbed over a depth of several meters; the molten salt free surface tolerates high irradiance levels, yet remains insensitive {{to the passage of}} clouds. Thermal losses to the environment are reduced with a refractory-lined domed roof and a small, <b>closeable</b> aperture. The molten salt and cover provide high and low temperature heat sources that can be optimally used to maximize energy production throughout the day, even when the sun is not shining. Hot salt is extracted from the upper region of the tank and sent through a steam generator, then returned {{to the bottom of the}} tank. An insulated barrier plate is positioned vertically within the tank to enhance the natural thermocline which forms and maintain hot and cold salt volumes required for operation. As a result, continuous, high temperature heat extraction is possible even as the average temperature of the salt is declining. Experimental results are presented for sodium-potassium nitrate salt volumetric receivers optically heated with a 10. 5 kilowatt, 60 -sun solar simulator. Designs, construction details and performance models used to estimate efficiency are presented for megawatt-scale molten salt volumetric receivers capable of operating with low cost nitrate or chloride salt eutectics at temperatures approaching 600 'C and 1000 'C, respectively. The integral storage capabilities of the receiver can be sized according to local needs, thereby enabling power generation on demand. by Daniel Shawn Codd. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Modifications {{to local}} and state codes are seen as an {{appropriate}} strategy {{for the prevention of}} residential air distribution system leakage and its impacts. A model code element has been developed to assist this strategy. Recent field studies of Florida residences by Cummings, Tooley and Moyer have revealed a mean leakage of 11 percent for the air distribution systems of central, fan-force heating and air conditioning systems. Such leakage may cause an estimated 20 percent increase in energy consumption for air conditioning, as well as a 50 percent increase in peak cooling load and an 80 percent increase in peak heating load. In addition, building air leakage may be expected to be several times greater when duct leakage is present or when avenues of air egress from <b>closeable</b> rooms are absent. The model duct construction element presented here contains all of the standards, definitions and code language needed to replace the current duct construction element of the local or state code. The content of this paper was used as a principal source for language adopted for the 1991 Florida Energy Efficiency Code For Building Construction. Addressed are the most appropriate standards required for the closure and sealing of metal duct, rigid fibrous glass duct, and nonmetallic flexible duct. Also addressed are (1) detailed requirements for the sealing of mechanical closets when they function as plenum chambers, (2) detailed requirements for the sealing of enclosed support platforms or air handlers and furnaces when they function as return duct, (3) detailed requirements for the sealing of uninhabitable cavities of the building structure, when they function as duct, and (4) detailed requirements for the egress of air from enclosed rooms which receive supply air.

40|$|Title: The closeability {{property}} for algebras of bounded linear operators on a complex Banach space. Abstract: Let A be an algebra of bounded linear operators on a complex Banach space X. A {{is said to}} have the closeability property (cp) if every densely defined linear operator which commutes with A is <b>closeable.</b> A bounded linear operator T on X {{is said to have}} the cp if the strong closure of the algebra of polynomials in T has the cp. We shall discuss progress on the following two conjectures. (Some of the progress is in joint work with T. Oikhberg and V. Troitsky.) Conjecture 0. 1 Let A have the cp. Then either A has a nontrivial invari-ant subspace, or A is strongly dense in L(X). (An invariant subspace of A is called nontrivial if it is closed, linear non-zero, and not all of L(X).) Note that if this conjecture holds, then every bounded linear operator on X with the cp has nontrivial hyperinvariant subspaces. In a remarkable seminal paper in the 60 ’s, W. Arveson proved that ifX = H, separable infinite dimensional Hilbert space, then if A contains a MASA or if A contains the unilateral shift, A satisfies the conclusion of Conjecture 1. Arveson also established that MASA’s and the unilateral shift both have the cp (although he didn’t use this terminology). Recently, answering a question of mine, Bercovici, Douglas, Foias and Percy, in joint work, showed that the bilateral shift fails the cp. Conjecture 0. 2 There exists a strongly closed proper subalgebra of L(H) containing the bilateral shift which has no non-trivial invariant subspaces. Of course an affirmative answer to this conjecture solves the famous transi-tive algebras problem, posed by R.

40|$|In {{the recent}} years, {{research}} has focused the attention {{on the use of}} substances able to improve both animal health and meat quality. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the effect of dietary supplementation with natural extracts in rabbit does on reproductive parameters. Natural extracts have been widely reported to have potent antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobic activities related especially to their phenolic content (Pereira et al., 2009). In rabbit production, does are normally inseminated 11 days after parturition, with kits being weaned at 35 days (Rebollar et al., 2006). The reproductive phase is a critical period because the animals have few days to reconstitute their body reserves (Castellini et al., 2003).   Therefore, the interaction between nutrition and reproduction is crucial in this specie (Butler, 2000; Roche et al., 2000). The trial was performed at the Research Institute for animal production in Nitra (Slovak Republic). Sixty does were randomly selected, artificially inseminated and divided into three experimental groups. The first fed a basal diet (C), the second one (T 1) received 0. 3 % of natural extracts mixture and the third one (T 2) an integration of 0. 6 % of natural extracts mixture for gestation and lactation period (65 days) The animals were allocated in individual flat-deck cages with a <b>closeable</b> nest box. At parturition, the total number of kits born and stillborn and litters weights were recorded. The data were analyzed by one way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) using SPSS (IBM. -SSPS Statistics 24). Dietary supplementation did not affect (P> 0. 05) number of kids born (8. 0 ± 1. 0 C vs 7. 3 ± 0. 97 T 1 and 7. 4 ± 1. 0 T 2) and birth weight (63 ± 2. 0 g C vs 60. 1 ± 2. 3 g T 1 and 61. 0 ± 2. 4 g T 2).   The administration of natural extract in does did not improve (P> 0. 05) the kits average daily gain (20. 54 ± 1. 3 g/d C vs 21. 92 ± 0. 5 g/d T 1 and 20. 93 ± 0. 9 g/d T 2) and body weight at weaning (829 ± 16. 6 g C vs 834 ± 26. 6 g T 1 and 826 ± 26. 8 g T 2). These preliminary data showed that at the present dosage, the natural extracts mixture is not able to affect does reproductive performance. However, further research is needed to confirm the present data and explore the mechanism of action of this natural mixture...|$|E
40|$|In {{addition}} to the traditional development goals like reliability, emission behaviour and energetic efficiency, the competition between the systems used for warming heating and drinking water is compelling the manufacturers of oil-fired heating systems to take increasingly into account product requirements such as adjustability, space requirements and operating noises, which {{have in the past}} been ignored. Above all, increasing importance is placed on reducing the lower power limit - which is at the moment around 15 kW for spray burners - against the background of a continuously falling need for heating energy. On the basis of these constraints, the pre-mixing surface burner for EL heating oil, developed as part of this work, provides a promising approach to a solution which links the possibility of metering minimal fuel mass flow rates with favourable emission behaviour, output dynamics and the virtually noiseless operation of this type of burner. To create the aerosol a superheated fuel jet is injected into the pre-mixing section of the burner via a <b>closeable</b> nozzle. As a result of the reduction in pressure at the nozzle outlet, vapour bubbles form with the injected jet, which is surrounded by air. The rapid growth of these vapour bubbles tears the liquid open. In addition, the kinetic forces of the internal turbulence and the sheer forces cause the liquid film to break up along the edges of the jet. In contrast to traditional methods of atomizing a liquid fuel much smaller drops are formed {{as a result of the}} overlaying of thermal and kinetic jet fragmentation. The injection device is designed as a volume-controlled metering system. A piston pump moves the fuel from a storage tank to the fuel heater. The injection nozzle is located at the outlet end of the fuel heater. Given a constant stroke volume the quantity of fuel which is injected is determined by the stroke frequency of the piston pump. Before the burner starts operating an electrical heating element heats the fuel to the required injection temperature. After the heater has operated for a brief period of time the hot reaction zone supplies the energy needed to heat up the fuel. The electrical heating element is either switched off, or activated at intervals in order to maintain a pre-set injection temperature. The fuel is heated under pressure in order to prevent the depositing of coke-like substances resulting from the liquid fuel phase. In order to provide a technical evaluation of the approach, a test burner with a power output of 2 - 10 kW was developed and examined on the basis of the following criteria: pollutant emission, flame stability, modulating operation, electrical energy requirement, noises and reliability. The results show that the nitrogen oxide emission and the surface burner noise level are considerably lower than those of conventional spray burners. (orig.)

The pupils were examined in their classrooms with a dental mirror and a tongue depressor by daylight. The front teeth were photographed in end-to-end occlusion. The urine was collected in sterile and <b>closeable</b> containers. The comparison of both areas showed that the ingestion of highly fluoridated water in Pol Dascht had a positive effect on caries prevalence (DMFT of 12 -year-old: 0. 9 and of 16 -year-old: 1. 6). In Orumiyeh both results were higher (DMFT of 12 -year-old: 1. 7 and of 16 -year-old: 4. 6). The difference between male and female pupils - amongst all ages - regarding DMFS/DMFT was not significant. In Pol Dascht more pupils did not suffer under dental caries compared to Orumiyeh. Additionally a lower level of sanitation (UNT = 78 - 100 %) was observed amongst all pupils in Pol Dascht. Furthermore 76 % of all examined pupils in Pol Dascht had a TFI-value of 3 or higher on their upper anterior teeth. Students who moved to Pol Dascht from other areas had much lower TFI-values. In Orumiyeh fluorosis did not impact the dental enamel but the risk to suffer under dental caries was 3. 1 times higher than in Pol Dascht. The relative risk to show a TFI-value of more than three was 1. 8 times higher for students that did not visit any dentist and it was 2. 9 times higher for those that did not brush their teeth compared to those students that brushed their teeth at least once a day. The average fluoride excrete in urine in Pol Dascht was very high with 7. 18 mg F/l compared to Orumiyeh with 1. 05 mg F/l. Children with a urine fluoride excrete of more than 1. 5 mgF/l had a 4 times higher risk to show a TFI-value of more than 3 on their upper anterior teeth. Those children had even a two times higher risk showing a TFI-value of more than seven. The study shows that the ingestion of highly fluoridated water (in Pol Dascht) is verifiable by examining the students´ teeth and their urine. The fluoride concentration in piped drinking water should be reduced drastically and controlled on a regular basis in Pol Dascht. A reduction of consumption of piped water and an increased usage of bottled water from other regions seem advisable in Pol Dascht...|$|E
40|$|O objetivo foi analisar como se constituem os espa??os sociais para vivenciar a velhice e as sociabilidades que geram identidade e pot??ncia aos idosos, transformando-os em atores sociais. O referencial metodol??gico foi qualitativo. Os sujeitos foram vinte e dois idosos. Os entrevistados foram indicados por conhecidos, via m??todo bola de neve: cada entrevistado apresentou refer??ncias/indica????es de outros indiv??duos eleg??veis para participarem do estudo em quest??o. O instrumento foi um roteiro de pesquisa com quest??es abertas, e a interpreta????o foi a partir de an??lise de conte??do. A partir dos resultados afirma-se que os idosos vivenciam diferentes din??micas de vida e n??o querem ser vistos como doentes ou coitadinhos. Os tipos ideais encontrados foram: Idosas Vi??vas e Solit??rias; Idosos Militantes Pol??ticos; Idosos engajados em movimentos culturais;Idosos espiritualizados e solid??rios e Idosos que trabalham e estudam a quest??o do envelhecimento. Mas s??o os espa??os de sociabilidades que permitem a que os idosos se potencializem e adquiram identidade pela suas a????es. ?? nos processos de intera????o (socia????o), que se constituem como sujeitos atuantes e constroem as diferentes velhices (tipos ideais) que se encontra hoje na esfera p??blica. Os idosos, que participam de diferentes socia????es enriquecem o seu c??rculo social e tamb??m seu pr??prio desenvolvimento, intensificando diferentes intera????es, seja na forma pol??tica, {{cultural}} ou religiosa. A movimenta????o na esfera p??blica acontece quando suas a????es impulsionam-se pela subjetividade, possibilitando maior reflexividade, a partir dos movimentos sociais. Essa reflexividade lhe estimula para suas escolhas, para o engajamento e participa????o pol??tica ou para o hedonismo e a religiosidade e os conselhos de direitos t??m o dever e obriga????o de possibilitar acesso a esses conhecimentos, assim como tamb??m ??s Universidades. Os idosos detentores de engajamento pol??tico, apresentam uma lideran??a e um carisma que os potencializa para a a????o em suas comunidades, que constituem seus territ??rios de a????o e trazem esse conhecimento a m??o em suas trajet??rias de vida. O idoso ainda ?? representado por pol??ticos, intelectuais e demais pessoas interessadas em tirar proveito da quest??o social do envelhecimento. Aos poucos v??o se acordando para essa realidade e iniciam sua participa????o, mas pelo elevado n??mero de idosos do Brasil, essa participa????o pol??tica ainda ?? irris??ria e por isso se diz que os idosos ainda n??o s??o legitimamente protagonistas na esfera p??blica, pois a sua movimenta????o ainda ?? uma novidade at?? mesmo entre os pr??prios idosos. The {{purpose was}} to analyze how the social spaces are constituted to experience the old age and the sociability that generate identity and power to the elderly, transforming them into social actors. The methodological referential was qualitative. The subjects were 22 elderly. The interviewed were indicated by known people, via snow ball method: each interviewed showed references/indications from other <b>closeable</b> individuals {{to participate in the}} study in question. The instrument was a research guide with open questions and the interpretation was from analyzes of categories. From the results we can affirm that the elderly experience different dynamics of life and they don?t want to be seen as sick or poor people. The ideal types found were: lonely and widow female elderly; Military Politician elderly; elderly engaged in cultural movements; spiritualized and solidary elderly and elderly who work and study the question of aging. But the sociability spaces are what allow that the elderly who potentiate and acquire identity by their actions. Its in the interaction processes (association) that are going to be constituted as acting subjects and building the different old ages (ideal kinds) that we find today in the public sphere. The elderly who participate in different associations enrich their social circle and also their own development, intensifying different interactions, in the political, cultural or religious means. The movement in the public sphere happens when its actions are boosted by the subjectivity, what enable it to have more reflectivity, from the social movements. This reflectivity stimulates it to its choices, to the engagement and political participation or to the hedonism and the religiosity and the advices of right have duty and the obligation to enable the access to this knowledge, as well as the Universities. The elderly who have political engagement present a leadership and charisma that potentiate them to the action and bring this knowledge to the hand on their life journey. The elderly is still represented by politicians, intellectuals and other people interested in benefiting from the aging social question. Few people are going to waking up to this reality and they start their participation, but by high number of elderly in Brazil, this political participation is still negligible and so we can say that the elderly aren?t the real protagonists in the public sphere yet, because their movementaction is still something new even among the elderly themselves...|$|E
