40|$|The finite <b>cell</b> <b>method</b> is an {{embedded}} domain method, {{which combines}} the fictitious domain approach with higher-order finite elements, adaptive integration, and weak enforcement of unfitted essential boundary conditions. Its core {{idea is to}} use a simple unfitted structured mesh of higher-order basis functions for the approximation of the solution fields, while the geometry is captured by means of adaptive quadrature points. This eliminates the need for boundary conforming meshes that require time-consuming and error-prone mesh generation procedures, and opens the door for a seamless integration of very complex geometric models into finite element analysis. At the same time, the finite <b>cell</b> <b>method</b> achieves full accuracy, i. e. optimal rates of convergence, when the mesh is refined, and exponential rates of convergence, when the polynomial degree is increased. Due to the flexibility of the quadrature based geometry approximation, the finite <b>cell</b> <b>method</b> can operate with almost any geometric model, ranging from boundary representations in computer aided geometric design to voxel representations obtained from medical imaging technologies. In this review article, we first provide a concise introduction to the basics of the finite <b>cell</b> <b>method.</b> We then summarize recent developments of the technology, with particular emphasis on the research topics in which we have been actively involved. These include the finite <b>cell</b> <b>method</b> with B-spline and NURBS basis functions, the treatment of geometric nonlinearities for large deformation analysis, the weak enforcement of boundary and coupling conditions, and local refinement schemes. We illustrate the capabilities and advantages of the finite <b>cell</b> <b>method</b> with several challenging examples, e. g. the image-based analysis of foam-like structures, the patient-specific analysis of a human femur bone, the analysis of volumetric structures based on CAD boundary representations, and the isogeometric treatment of trimmed NURBS surfaces. We conclude our review by briefly discussing some key aspects for the efficient implementation of the finite <b>cell</b> <b>method...</b>|$|E
40|$|Ameloblastoma is {{a common}} and {{unpredictable}} odontogenic tumor with high relapse rates. Several studies assessing the proliferative capacity of these neoplasms have been published, mainly using the protein Ki- 67. Cell counts must be completed to determine the cell proliferation rate.

Here, we compared manual <b>cell</b> counting <b>methods</b> with automated <b>cell</b> counting (ImmunoRatio) to determine the relative effectiveness of these methods. The results suggest that ImmunoRatio, a free software tool, may be highly advantageous and provide results similar to manual <b>cell</b> counting <b>methods</b> when used with the appropriate calibration. However, ImmunoRatio has flaws that may affect the labeling index results.
