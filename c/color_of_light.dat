He did not doubt the accuracy of Newton's experiments quoted by Dollond.|$|E

50|$|In many {{examples}} of 3D optical data storage systems, several wavelengths (<b>colors)</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> are used (e.g. reading laser, writing laser, signal; sometimes even two lasers are required just for writing). Therefore, as well as coping with the high laser power and variable spherical aberration, the optical system must combine and separate these different <b>colors</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> as required.|$|R

50|$|This {{provides}} two superficially opposite {{but actually}} complementary descriptions of black. Black is the absorption <b>of</b> all <b>colors</b> <b>of</b> <b>light,</b> or an exhaustive combination <b>of</b> multiple <b>colors</b> <b>of</b> pigment. See also primary colors.|$|R
5000|$|For {{the human}} eye, the best primary <b>colors</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> are red, green, and blue. Combining the {{wavelengths}} <b>of</b> <b>light</b> {{we see as}} these colors produces the greatest range <b>of</b> visible <b>color.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Through a {{thickness}} of 10 meters or more, however, the intrinsic color of water (or ice) is visibly turquoise (greenish blue), as its absorption spectrum has a sharp minimum at the corresponding <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> (1/227 m−1 at 418nm). [...] The color becomes increasingly stronger and darker with increasing thickness. (Practically no sunlight reaches {{the parts of}} the oceans below 1000 meters of depth.) Infrared and ultraviolet light, on the other hand, is strongly absorbed by water.|$|E
2500|$|When light {{travels through}} thin clouds {{made up of}} nearly uniform sized water or aerosol {{droplets}} or ice crystals, diffraction or bending of light occurs as the light is diffracted by {{the edges of the}} particles. [...] This degree of bending of light depends on the frequency (<b>color)</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> {{and the size of the}} particles. [...] The result is a pattern of rings, which seem to emanate from the Sun, the Moon, a planet, or another astronomical object. The most distinct part of this pattern is a central, nearly white disk. This resembles an atmospheric Airy disc but is not actually an Airy disk. It is distinct from rainbows and halos, which are mainly caused by refraction.|$|E
2500|$|The {{refractive}} {{indices of}} ianbruceite {{are similar to}} that of ordinary window glass, with nα = 1.601, nβ = 1.660 and nγ = 1.662. [...] The refractive index varies with the wavelength (<b>color)</b> <b>of</b> <b>light,</b> so the positions of the optic axes in biaxial crystals, and the angle 2V between them, will change when the color of the incident light is changed. This effect may be expressed in the form r > v, indicating that the angle 2V is greater for red than for violet light, or vice versa. [...] For ianbruceite 2V is greater for violet light than for red light, v > r. [...] The angle 2V has been measured as 18°; it can also be calculated from the values of the refractive indices α, β and γ, giving a value of 20°. [...] The mineral does not fluoresce in ultraviolet light.|$|E

2500|$|The {{practice}} of naming kinds of noise after colors started with white noise, a signal whose spectrum has equal power within any equal interval of frequencies. [...] That name {{was given by}} analogy with white light, which was (incorrectly) assumed {{to have such a}} flat power spectrum over the visible range. Other color names, like pink, red, and blue were then given to noise with other spectral profiles, often (but not always) in reference to the <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> with similar spectra. Some of those names have standard definitions in certain disciplines, while others are very informal and poorly defined. Many of these definitions assume a signal with components at all frequencies, with a power spectral density per unit of bandwidth proportional to 1/f'β and hence they are examples of power-law noise. [...] For instance, the spectral density of white noise is flat (β = 0), while flicker or pink noise has β = 1, and Brownian noise has β = 2.|$|E
2500|$|When {{considering}} lighting for an aquarium, {{there are}} generally two factors to consider: wattage and color temperature. Depending {{on the type}} of lighting (i.e. fluorescents, metal halide, etc.) the wattage of light emitted may vary considerably, from tens of watts to several hundred watts in a lighting system. Wattage, while not indicative of color, is equivalent to power and essentially determines how brightly the light will shine. Due to the scattering of light in water, the deeper one's tank is, the more powerful the lighting required. Color temperature, measured in kelvins (albeit slightly unrepresentively) refers to the <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> being emitted by the lamp and is based on the concept of blackbody radiation. [...] Light from the sun has a color temperature of approximately 5900 K and lighting systems with color temperatures >5000 K tend to be best for growing plants in both the marine and freshwater setting. 10,000 K light appears bluish-white and emphasizes coloration in fishes and corals. Higher up on the spectrum there are 14,000 K and 20,000 K bulbs that produce a deep blue tint which mimic the lighting conditions underseas, creating an optimal ambience for invertebrates and livestock present.|$|E
2500|$|Wharton was a {{scientist}} {{interested in the}} natural world, and wrote scientific papers {{on a variety of}} topics including astronomy and metallurgy, presenting several to the American Philosophical Society. In the winter of 1883–1884 there was a period of several months when sunsets were extraordinarily red worldwide. Some imagined that the red color was from dust dispersed in the atmosphere worldwide by the volcano Krakatoa which had recently erupted. Others imagined that the reddish hue might come from iron and steel furnaces because they were known to create a reddish-brown dust. Wharton was curious, and one morning when a light snow was falling, collected some from a field near his house, melted and evaporated it, studying the remaining particles under a microscope which he had on hand for metallurgy. The particles looked like [...] "irregular, flattish, blobby" [...] glass particles. He visited a ship that had come to port in Philadelphia, having sailed from Manila, a course that had taken it a few hundred miles from Krakatoa. It had been slowed by a huge amount of pumice floating in the ocean, evidently spewed out by Krakatoa. Wharton obtained some pumice from one of the ship's crew, compared it with the dust he had collected, and found almost identical particles. In 1893 he presented a paper about the dust to the 150th anniversary meeting of the American Philosophical Society. Wharton also wrote a paper about the use of the Doppler effect on the <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> emitted by binary stars to determine their distance from Earth, and made the analogy to a train whistle which changes tone as it passes. Wharton {{was one of the most}} accomplished metallurgists in America during his lifetime, certainly the most widely known.|$|E

60|$|Fancy her, then, if you please, {{about five}} feet four inches high--fancy her in the family <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> blue, a little scarf {{covering}} the most brilliant shoulders in the world; {{and a pair of}} gloves clinging close round an arm that may, perhaps, be somewhat too large now, but that Juno might have envied then. After the fashion of young ladies on the continent, she wears no jewels or gimcracks: her only ornament is a wreath of vine-leaves in her hair, with little clusters of artificial grapes. Down on her shoulders falls the brown hair, in rich liberal clusters; all that health, and good-humor, and beauty can do for her face, kind nature has done for hers. Her eyes are frank, sparkling, and kind. As for her cheeks, what paint-box or dictionary contains pigments or words to describe their red? They say she opens her mouth and smiles always to show the dimples in her cheeks. Psha! she smiles because she is happy, and kind, and good-humored, and not because her teeth are little pearls.|$|E
60|$|These six {{qualities are}} the only {{perfectly}} legitimate sources of pleasure in execution; but I might have added a seventh--strangeness, which in many cases is productive of a pleasure not altogether mean or degrading, though scarcely right. Supposing the other higher qualities first secured, it adds in no small degree to our impression of the artist's knowledge, if the means used be such as we should never have thought of, or should have thought adapted to a contrary effect. Let us, for instance, compare {{the execution of the}} bull's head in the left hand lowest corner of the Adoration of the Magi, in the Museum at Antwerp, with that in Berghem's landscape, No. 132 in the Dulwich Gallery. Rubens first scratches horizontally over his canvas a thin grayish brown, transparent and even, very much the <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> wainscot; the horizontal strokes of the bristles being left so evident, that the whole might be taken for an imitation of wood, were it not for its transparency. On this ground the eye, nostril, and outline of the cheek are given with two or three rude, brown touches, (about three or four minutes' work in all,) though the head is colossal. The background is then laid in with thick, solid, warm white, actually projecting all round the head, leaving it in dark intaglio. Finally, five thin and scratchy strokes of very cold bluish white are struck for the high light on the forehead and nose, and the head is complete. Seen within a yard of the canvas, it looks actually transparent--a flimsy, meaningless, distant shadow; while the background looks solid, projecting and near. From the right distance, (ten or twelve yards off, whence alone the whole of the picture can be seen,) it is a complete, rich, substantial, and living realization of the projecting head of the animal; while the background falls far behind. Now there is no slight nor mean pleasure in perceiving such a result attained by means so strange. By Berghem, on the other hand, a dark background is first laid in with exquisite delicacy and transparency, and on this the cow's head is actually modelled in luminous white, the separate locks of hair projecting from the canvas. No surprise, nor much pleasure of any kind, would be attendant on this execution, even were the result equally successful; and what little pleasure we had in it, vanishes, when on retiring from the picture, we find the head shining like a distant lantern, instead of substantial or near. Yet strangeness is not to be considered as a legitimate source of pleasure. That means which is most conducive to the end, should always be the most pleasurable; and that which is most conducive to the end, can be strange only to the ignorance of the spectator. This kind of pleasure is illegitimate, therefore, because it implies and requires, in those who feel it, ignorance of art.|$|E
