40|$|Abstract: Faults in the DC <b>collector</b> <b>circuits</b> of a {{photovoltaic}} plant are a {{cause for}} major concern due to the damage they may cause to equipment. Fault protection is required for ground faults, line-to-line faults and arc faults. Typically, the magnitude of short-circuit currents of PV modules are {{similar to that of}} load currents which makes fault detection and protection difficult to carry out on the DC system. The DC collectors of a PV plant consist of combiner boxes where PV arrays are connected and inverter DC buses where combiner boxes are connected. This paper investigates the fault contribution from the PV modules on the combiner boxes and inverter DC buses in relation to typical PV module data on an isolated section of the DC network of a plant using the ETAP simulation tool. A fault detection and protection scheme for the main faults in a DC PV system is proposed based on previous research, for complete protection of the DC <b>collector</b> <b>circuits...</b>|$|R

50|$|Because {{the pull-up}} {{resistor}} is external {{and does not}} need to be connected to the chip supply voltage, a lower or higher voltage than the chip supply voltage can be used instead.

The first system type is a so-called compact system, designed to produce a drinking water output of 100-120 l/day from sea-or brackish water. The main aim of the system design is a simple, self-sufficient, low maintenance and robust plant for target markets in arid and semi-arid areas of low infrastructure.The second system type is a so-called two-loop plant with a capacity of around 2000 l/day.

40|$|Wind farm <b>collector</b> <b>circuits</b> {{generally}} comprise several {{wind turbine}} generators (WTG’s). WTG’s are connected in parallel to a substation. This connection acts as the point-of-connection to the national electricity grid. The electrical load in these circuits is close to component (power cables and accessories) ratings. The objective {{of this paper is}} to identify cable joint failure paths; and, develop an understanding of specific contributing factors. All findings presented were established from literature review involving data analysis and discussion with industry experts working across the wind industry. Application of forces, inadequate workmanship, incorrect thermal resistance or other contributing factors, all contribute to high conductor operating temperatures. High conductor operating temperatures highlight issues including insufficient environmental heat transfer due to the use of inadequate cable trenching materials. This in turn results in the imbalanced application of force, experienced at the cable joint, as a direct result of frequent thermal expansion and contraction. For most cable joint failures, the root cause is insulation breakdown due to sustained deterioration of the cross-linked polyethylene insulation. This is a direct result from excessive operating temperatures...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{obstacles}} to economic profitability of solar water heating systems is the investment cost. Retrofitting existing domestic hot water heaters when a new solar hot water system is installed can reduce both the installation and material costs. In this study, retrofitting existing water heaters for solar water heating systems in Swedish single-family houses was theoretically investigated using the TRNSYS software. Four simulation models using forced circulation flow with different system configurations and control strategies were simulated and analysed in the study. A comparison with a standard solar thermal system was also presented based on the annual solar fraction.

40|$|AbstractThermochromic {{absorber}} coatings, which switch their emissivity for {{thermal radiation}} depending on temperature, are developed {{to reduce the}} stagnation temperature of solar thermal collectors: In the operating range of the collector, the surface exhibits a low emissivity (ɛ = 10 %). At higher temperatures, the emissivity is increased by a multiple (ɛ = 35 %). Thus, the collector heat losses raise and the stagnation temperature is reduced. Efficiency measurements on a prototype collector employing this thermochromic absorber show, that below the switching temperature the efficiency is nearly identical {{to that of a}} conventional collector with a highly selective absorber plate. Due to the increased emissivity in the switched state of the coating, the stagnation temperature is lowered by more than 30 K. System simulations exhibit, that the performance of the system is not significantly affected: in a combined system for space heating and domestic hot water preparation the conventional energy demand of the gas boiler is increased by 1. 5 % to 4. 5 % using the thermochromic collector instead of a standard collector. In contrast, the duration when formation of vapour in the <b>collector</b> <b>circuit</b> occurs, is reduced by 70 % to 75 %. By further optimizing thermochromic collectors, the formation of vapour in the solar circuit could be completely prevented during stagnation. This would allow the use of lower cost materials in the solar circuit and reduce the cost of installation and maintenance of the solar circuit significantly...|$|E
40|$|The {{solar thermal}} market is growing, {{and more and}} more {{large-scale}} facilities are being installed. This results in more products and shorter cycles of innovation. R&D departments in industry and testing institutes need high-end test stands for their research and quality control. The new PSE indoor simulator includes the following innovations: All operations are centrally controlled by a touch screen panel PC. All parameters defining the test conditions are saved by the centralized control. This means a significant improvement in documentation and, therefore, repeatability. Eight metal halide lamps are mounted in four rows which can be moved electrically. Each lamp can be dimmed and positioned individually. In this way, different test areas can be illuminated at different intensities and optimum homogeneity. The collector support structure, the thermostat, the complete <b>collector</b> <b>circuit</b> and the measurement equipment are mounted on the electrically positioned test platfor m. A two axis scanner is installed on the test surface. The scanner can be equipped with various sensors (e. g. pyranometer, pyrgeometer, solar cell, anemometer).

40|$|The European Union {{appointed}} in 2007 an objective {{to reduce the}} energy consumption with 20 % and increase the utilization of renewable energy resources with 20 % within year 2020. This master thesis analysed a passive house kindergarten in Trondheim built in 2013 with a heat supply system based on renewable heat sources, solar collectors combined with a ground source heat pump. The possibility of storing solar heat seasonally in energy wells was also taken into consideration. The kindergarten was modelled in the simulation program IDA ICE, in order to perform simulations and analyse the building s heat supply system. The model was initiated through the author s preliminary project thesis. As {{the aim was to}} make the model as realistic as possible, all documentation used as basis for the input data was received from Rambøll, who did the projecting of the heat supply system. Issues particularly of interest were the resulting net annual energy need of the building, heating loads and the performance of the heat plant. Indoor environment in the occupied zones and ventilation control strategies were also examined. Parameters regarding system design and operation were changed in order to study how this affected the results. At last, an economic evaluation of the heat supply system was carried out too see whether the heat supply system was economically preferable. The net annual energy need according to IDA ICE was 57, 4 kWh/m 2, in which the heating need was 33, 1 kWh/m 2. Judging by IDA ICE results, the installed radiators at Haukåsen kindergarten have oversized capacity, while the heating coil and domestic hot water load was dimensioned with too low heating load. Out of the net annual heating need, the results showed that the heat pump covered 81, 5 %, the boiler 12, 5 % and the solar collector 6 %. As the heat pump coverage was found to be only 24 % of the heating load, the high coverage of the net annual heating need indicated an oversized capacity in the heat pump. This may cause earlier wear out of the compressor due to part-load operation most of the time. The results related to analysis of the solar collector showed that the solar collector contribution was 1 608 kWh/year, but the theoretical efficiency implied that a contribution of 4 241 kWh/year could be expected. Either doubling of the collector area or optimization of the tilting angle gave noticeably higher contribution. Neither did changing of the shape factor for the hot water tank. Thus the default control strategy of the solar <b>collector</b> <b>circuit</b> in IDA ICE was questioned, and ought to be further studied. As the zones in the kindergarten have demand controlled ventilation based on temperature, presence and CO 2 concentration, different ventilation control macros were developed and implemented in the IDA ICE model. This resulted in more energy efficient ventilation and 1 388 kWh was saved each year due to decreased energy need for fan operation. Realization of night set-back contributed to decrease the net annual heating need with 5 969 kWh/year. Nevertheless, the low annual energy need was at the sacrifice of the indoor environment. The night set-back implied too low zone air temperatures during wintertime, while the occupancy controlled ventilation led to excess temperature during summertime. Simulation of underground thermal energy storage was carried out by changing the IDA ICE plant macro. A ground heat exchanger ensured transfer of heat from the solar <b>collector</b> <b>circuit</b> to the brine return pipeline. The result showed a 78 % increase in annual solar heat contribution and 0, 08 °C increase in ground temperature over a year. This indicated that the heat pump COP would remain high for a longer time period than in the model without the ground heat exchanger. To confirm this, further studies on the subject should involve simulations over longer time periods. The economic analysis showed that the existing heat plant in the kindergarten has a global cost of 452 892 NOK and a pay-off period of 25 years. If the solar collector had not been installed, 25 667 NOK could have been saved in global cost and 1, 3 years in pay-off period. Nevertheless, installation of solar collectors was a deciding factor when the building received the label Very good according to the building classification system BREEAM. On this basis the solar collector was considered a valuable investment. Sensitivity analysis showed that an increase in real interest rate gave lower global costs and a higher pay-off period...|$|E
40|$|Dynamic system {{test methods}} for heating systems were {{developed}} and applied by the institutes SERC and SP from Sweden, INES from France and SPF from Switzerland already before the MacSheep project started. These test methods {{followed the same}} principle: a complete heating system – including heat generators, storage, control etc., is installed on the test rig; the test rig software and hardware simulates and emulates the heat load for space heating and domestic hot water of a single family house, while the unit under test has to act autonomously to cover the heat demand during a representative test cycle. Within the work package 2 of the MacSheep project these similar – but different – test methods were harmonized and improved. The work undertaken includes:  • Harmonization of the physical boundaries of the unit under test. • Harmonization of the boundary conditions of climate and load. • Definition of an approach to reach identical space heat load in combination with an autonomous control of the space heat distribution by the unit under test. • Derivation and validation of new six day and a twelve day test profiles for direct extrapolation of test results.   The new harmonized test method combines {{the advantages of the}} different methods that existed before the MacSheep project. The new method is a benchmark test, which means that the load for space heating and domestic hot water preparation will be identical for all tested systems, and that the result is representative for the performance of the system over a whole year. Thus, no modelling and simulation of the tested system is needed in order to obtain the benchmark results for a yearly cycle. The method is thus also applicable to products for which simulation models are not available yet. Some of the advantages of the new whole system test method and performance rating compared to the testing and energy rating of single components are:  • Interaction between the different components of a heating system, e. g. storage, solar <b>collector</b> <b>circuit,</b> heat pump, control, etc. are included and evaluated in this test. • Dynamic effects are included and influence the result just as they influence the annual performance in the field. • Heat losses are influencing the results in a more realistic way, since they are evaluated under "real installed" and representative part-load conditions rather than under single component steady state conditions.   The described method is also suited for the development process of new systems, where it replaces time-consuming and costly field testing with the advantage of a higher accuracy of the measured data (compared to the typically used measurement equipment in field tests) and identical, thus comparable boundary conditions. Thus, the method can be used for system optimization in the test bench under realistic operative conditions, i. e. under relevant operating environment in the lab.   This report describes the physical boundaries of the tested systems, as well as the test procedures and the requirements for both the unit under test and the test facility.

Electrodynamic Shields (EDS) have been targeted as a technology to help mitigate degradation of power output caused by dust deposition on various solar <b>collectors.</b> Though printed <b>circuit</b> board based EDS prototypes have shown promising dust removal efficiencies, an inexpensive method of transparent EDS fabrication must be realized before the EDS technology is adopted by the solar industry. Development of a screen-printing process is presented as a scalable, low-cost method of EDS fabrication. The process is established using a silver-based ink on borosilicate glass substrates and then adapted to incorporate transparent conductive PEDOT:PSS and ITO nanoparticle solutions. Successful EDS prototypes are characterized and integrated with photovoltaic cells and second surface mirrored substrates. Removal efficiencies of the screen-printed EDS are tested by measuring the restoration in specular reflection and transmission in integrated EDS-mirror and EDSPV modules after dust depositions. Finally, a cost analysis of the EDS screen-printing process is performed in order to predict the economic viability of the EDS technology when used in conjunction with solar collecting technologies. 2031 - 01 - 0...|$|R
