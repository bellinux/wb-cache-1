30|$|This {{paper is}} {{organized}} as follows. In Sect.  2, we first introduce the modeling of encoding of temporal stimuli with <b>complex</b> <b>cells.</b> We provide a detailed review of decoding of stimuli and the functional identification of <b>complex</b> <b>cells</b> {{and point out}} the current algorithmic limitations. In Sect.  3, we provide sparse decoding algorithms that achieve high accuracy and are algorithmically tractable. We then explicate the dual relationship between sparse functional identification and decoding and provide examples for the identification of low-rank temporal DSP kernels of <b>complex</b> <b>cells.</b> In Sect.  4, we extend sparse decoding methodology to spatio-temporal stimuli and functional identification of spatio-temporal <b>complex</b> <b>cells.</b> Using novel stimuli, we provide evaluation examples of the identification algorithms in the input space and compare them with other state-of-the-art methods.

40|$|A {{previous}} study {{has suggested that}} <b>complex</b> <b>cells</b> perform a MAX-like operation on their inputs: when two bar stimuli are presented within the receptive field, regardless of their relative separation, the cell’s response is similar in amplitude to {{the larger of the}} responses elicited by the individual stimuli. This description of <b>complex</b> <b>cells</b> seems at odds with the classical energy model in which <b>complex</b> <b>cells</b> receive input from multiple simple cells with overlapping receptive fields. The energy model predicts, and experiments have confirmed, that bar stimuli should facilitate or suppress one another depending on their relative separation. We have recorded intracellularly from a population of <b>complex</b> <b>cells</b> and studied their responses to paired bar stimuli in detail. A wide range of behavior was observed, from the more classical separation-dependent interactions to purely MAX-like responses. We also found that the more MAX-like a cell was, the broader its spatial-frequency tuning as measured with drifting gratings. These observations are consistent with energy models in which classical <b>complex</b> <b>cells</b> receive input from simple cells with similar preferred spatial frequencies, and MAX-like <b>complex</b> <b>cells</b> receive input from simple cells with disparate preferred spatial frequencies.

30|$|The {{nonlinear}} transformations {{taking place}} in the DSP of <b>complex</b> <b>cells</b> lead to loss of phase information.

With this in mind, we formulate the reconstruction of stimuli encoded with <b>complex</b> <b>cells</b> as a phase retrieval problem [22] and, in search of tractable algorithms, utilize recent developments in optimization theory of low-rank matrices [22 – 24].

5000|$|The {{stereo model}} is an energy model that {{integrates}} both the position-shift {{model and the}} phase-difference model. [...] The position-shift model suggests that the receptive fields of left and right simple cells are identical in shape but are shifted horizontally relative to each other. This model was proposed by Bishop and Pettigrew in 1986. [...] According to the phase-difference model the excitatory and inhibitory sub-regions of {{the left and right}} receptive fields of simple cells are shifted in phase such that their boundaries overlap. This model was developed by Ohzawa in 1990. [...] The stereo model uses Fourier phase dependence of simple cell responses, and it suggests that the use of the response of only simple cells is not enough to accurately depict the physiological observations found in cat, monkey, and human visual pathways. [...] In order to make the model more representative of physiological observations, the stereo model combines the responses of both simple and complex cells into a single signal. How this combination is done depends on the incoming stimulus. As one example, the model uses independent Fourier phases for some types of stimuli, and finds the preferred disparity of the complex cells equal to the left-right receptive field shift. [...] For other stimuli, the <b>complex</b> <b>cell</b> becomes less phase sensitive than the simple cells alone, and when the complex cells larger receptive field is included in the model, the phase sensitivity is returns to results similar to normal physiological observations. [...] In order to include the larger receptive fields of complex cells, the model averages several pairs of simple cells nearby and overlaps their receptive fields to construct the <b>complex</b> <b>cell</b> model. This allows the <b>complex</b> <b>cell</b> to be phase independent for all stimuli presented while still maintaining an equal receptive field shift to the simple cells it is composed of in the model.|$|E

40|$|<b>Complex</b> <b>cells</b> {{in primary}} visual cortex exhibit highly {{nonlinear}} receptive field properties such as phase-invariant direction selectivity and antagonistic interactions between individually excitatory stimuli.

Using a biophysically detailed model of recurrently connected cortical neurons, we show that complex cell-like direction selectivity may emerge without antecedent simple cell inputs, as a consequence of spike-timing dependent synaptic plasticity during visual development. The directionally-selective receptive fields of model neurons, as determined by reverse correlation gnd 2 -bar interaction maps, were similar to those obtained from <b>complex</b> <b>cells</b> in awake monkey {{primary visual cortex}}.

Unlike simple cells, the receptive field of <b>complex</b> <b>cells</b> have a mix of regions that respond to light and dark stimuli. The prevailing theory of how simple and <b>complex</b> <b>cells</b> interact is that cells in the lateral geniculate nucleus stimulate simple cells, and simple cells in turn stimulate <b>complex</b> <b>cells</b> where then a combination of <b>complex</b> <b>cells</b> create depth perception.
