25|$|In February 2016, the Académie française {{decided to}} remove the <b>circumflex</b> from about 2000 words, a plan that had been {{outlined}} since 1990. However, usage of the <b>circumflex</b> would not be considered incorrect.|$|E

25|$|In Adûnaic, the Black Speech, and Khuzdul, {{constructed}} {{languages of}} J. R. R. Tolkien, all long vowels are transcribed with the <b>circumflex.</b> In Sindarin long vowels in monosyllabic words take the <b>circumflex</b> and long vowels in longer words take the acute.|$|E
25|$|The <b>circumflex</b> has {{its origins}} in the polytonic orthography of Ancient Greek, where it marked long vowels that were {{pronounced}} with high and then falling pitch. In a similar vein, the <b>circumflex</b> is today used to mark tone contour in the International Phonetic Alphabet.|$|E
25|$|Long syllables, that is, those {{containing}} a long vowel, a diphthong, or a mixed diphthong which {{ends in a}} sonorant, may have one of two types of accents: the acute or the <b>circumflex.</b> In an unstressed position, the opposition of the two accents is neutralized and reflected by a <b>circumflex</b> accent.|$|E
25|$|Overlong vowels {{appear with}} <b>circumflexes,</b> e.g. ô. In other {{literature}} {{they are often}} denoted by a doubled macron, e.g. ō̄.|$|R

2500|$|Turkish. According to Turkish Language Association orthography, düzeltme işareti [...] "correction mark" [...] over a, i and u marks a long vowel to disambiguate similar words. For example, compare ama [...] "but" [...] and âmâ [...] "blind", şura 'that place, there' and şûra [...] "council". In general, <b>circumflexes</b> {{occur only}} in Arabic and Persian loanwords as vowel length in early Turkish was not phonemic. However, this {{standard}} was never applied entirely consistently {{and by the}} early 21st century many publications had stopped using <b>circumflexes</b> almost entirely.|$|R
25|$|In general, vowels {{bearing the}} <b>circumflex</b> accent were {{historically}} long (for example, through compensatory lengthening {{associated with the}} consonant loss described above). Vowel length is no longer distinctive in most varieties of modern French, {{but some of the}} older length distinctions now correspond to differences in vowel quality, and the <b>circumflex</b> can be used to indicate these differences orthographically.|$|E
25|$|In certain words, the <b>circumflex</b> is idiopathic, {{and has no}} precise {{linguistic}} role.|$|E

50|$|The {{operators}} used {{in quantum}} mechanics are {{collected in the}} table below (see for example,). The bold-face vectors with <b>circumflexes</b> are not unit vectors, they are 3-vector operators; all three spatial components taken together.|$|R
50|$|Writers {{with more}} {{linguistic}} knowledge sometimes employed symbols such as ŋ or ġ for , ñ for , macrons (¯) or <b>circumflexes</b> (^) for long vowels, breves (˘) for short vowels, {{but these were}} often applied inconsistently.|$|R
25|$|Long vowels are {{indicated}} by a <b>circumflex</b> accent: long o is written ô.|$|E
25|$|The <b>circumflex</b> accent marks a long vowel in the orthography or {{transliteration}} {{of several}} languages.|$|E
25|$|The mixed diphthongs {{starting}} in i, u {{and a simple}} diphthong ui are commonly pronounced without noticeable intensifying {{of one of the}} appropriate elements in both acute as well as <b>circumflex</b> cases. It is easy to intentionally intensify the second part in the <b>circumflex</b> accent, but it is common too, {{that it is impossible to}} extract, hear out them from the standard language, the sounds are pronounced without an attention on emphasizing some accentual oppositions. In a case of the mixed diphthongs {{starting in}} a, e the opposition can be understood at least by different quantity of these sounds: lengthened in the acute case, and not lengthen in the <b>circumflex.</b> Such lengthening helps to hold the two accents in the simple diphthongs (au, ai, ei) too (for example, in an ui case, where the first element is short, the opposition between accents is usually lost in a standard language), but in this case the lengthening, emphasis of the second element in the <b>circumflex</b> accentuation (similarly to the emphasis of the first element in the acute accentuation) is characteristic, not unusual.|$|E
5000|$|The acute {{initially}} {{arose in}} the syllables closed by a laryngeal, partly from the retraction of word-final accent onto such syllables, which were phonologically long (Hirt's law). Other long syllables, if they bore the accent, were <b>circumflexed,</b> with later falling tone.|$|R
50|$|In East Slavic and the Lechitic {{branch of}} West Slavic, {{the outcome was}} {{dependent}} upon the Proto-Slavic accent: in acuted syllables, the output {{was the same as}} in South Slavic and Czech-Slovak, but on <b>circumflexed</b> syllables, the metathesized vowel did not lengthen.|$|R
50|$|In Proto-Slavic, the {{operation}} of Meillet's law converted acute roots to <b>circumflexed</b> in mobile nominals, {{so there is no}} split like there is for Lithuanian. All nominals with mobile accentuation in Balto-Slavic belong to one accent paradigm in Slavic, accent paradigm c.|$|R
25|$|Akkadian. In the {{transliteration}} of this language, the <b>circumflex</b> {{indicates a}} long vowel resulting from an aleph contraction.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, a <b>circumflex</b> accent is {{also used}} in some French loanwords, {{including}} enquête (survey), and gênant (embarrassing).|$|E

40|$|ENERGETIC INTERPRETATION OF PHONETIC NATURE OF TONEMES IN NORTH- ŽEMATIAN DIALECT Summary The {{acoustic}} and auditive {{experiments have}} shown that the main invariant differential feature of tonemes (syllable accents) of the North-Žemaitian dialect (and, maybe, of Lithuanian in general) is the concentration of the common spectral energy (intensity) and nature of its change. The energy of the acute (sharp, broken) stressed syllables is concentrated in one definite point of a vowel or a diphthong and decreases very sharply; the energy of the <b>circumflexed</b> (smooth, ascending) syllables is diffused in the whole syllable and changes gradually. These processes are accompanied by similar changes of formant structure. In general, the timbre of acute vowels changes abruptly and is more tense than the timbre of corresponding <b>circumflexed</b> vowels. </p...|$|R
5000|$|Owing to the {{difficulty}} of entering diacritics like macrons or <b>circumflexes</b> with standard keyboards (as well as the ambiguity of ō, etc., which in Hepburn can represent either おう or おお) long vowels are almost universally entered following kana spelling rules; thus, kou for こう and koo for こお.|$|R
25|$|The {{contrast}} between the accents in diphthongs starting in a, e (au, ai, ei; a, e + l, m, n, r) {{is based on the}} quantity and quality. In acute accented cases, the first element is emphasized: it lengthens, is more tensed, open than the respective element in the <b>circumflex</b> cases. The second element of acute simple diphthongs is more open and less tensed than the respective element of the <b>circumflex</b> diphthongs.|$|E
25|$|In {{music theory}} and musicology, a <b>circumflex</b> above a numeral {{is used to}} make {{reference}} to a particular scale degree.|$|E
25|$|In the <b>circumflex</b> cases, {{articulation}} is like in a, e starting diphthongs: {{the second}} element is emphasized and lengthened.|$|E
5000|$|Towards {{the end of}} the Committee's meeting, {{committee}} members received a proposal by an anonymous author identified as [...] "Ido" [...] (I.D. in Esperanto, possibly for Internacia Delegacio International Delegation, but also meaning [...] "offspring" [...] in Esperanto). The proposal reformed Esperanto in a number of ways, including removing <b>circumflexed</b> letters, dropping the mandatory accusative ending and reforming the plural. The reforms were endorsed by Esperanto's representative, de Beaufront.|$|R
2500|$|Since 2009 it {{has been}} very easy to add key {{combinations}} for accented Esperanto letters to one's usual keyboard layout, at least in Gnome and KDE. No download is required. The keyboard layout options can be modified under System Preferences. The options to choose are [...] "Adding Esperanto <b>circumflexes</b> (supersigno)" [...] and the appropriate keyboard layout (Qwerty or Dvorak). A third level shift key is also required: under [...] "Key to choose 3rd level", e.g. LeftWin.|$|R
2500|$|The script resembles Western Slavic Latin alphabets but uses of <b>circumflexes</b> {{instead of}} carons for the letters ĉ, ĝ, ĥ, ĵ, and ŝ. Also, the non-Slavic bases {{of the letters}} ĝ and ĵ, rather than Slavic dž and ž, help {{preserve}} the printed appearance of Latinate and Germanic vocabulary such as ĝenerala [...] "general" [...] (adjective) and ĵurnalo [...] "journal". The letter v stands for either v or w of other languages. The letter ŭ of the diphthongs aŭ and eŭ resemble the Belarusian Łacinka alphabet.|$|R
