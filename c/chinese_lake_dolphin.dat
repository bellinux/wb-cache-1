40|$|Recent {{crisis in}} clean water supply in China Harmful algal blooms are {{a serious threat}} to safe {{drinking}} water and recreational use of beaches and lake waters. In particular, the toxins of cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) can lead to human and animal illness and mortality, reduction of fisheries production as well as many environmental and recreational related problems. These will have potential impacts on ecosystem functioning, services and eventually local economic development. Recently, reemergence of widespread algal blooms in <b>Chinese</b> <b>lakes</b> and rivers has deepened the crisis of clean water supply in China and raised a wide public concern. A survey result of monitored rivers and lakes in 2007 indicated more than 50 % of rivers and large lakes were heavily polluted (Fu 2008). Last year, the outbreaks of blue-green algae in one of the five largest <b>Chinese</b> <b>lakes,</b> Taihu, covering {{about a third of the}} lake surface, caused several million people in Wuxi city to go without access to drinkable water for more than one week.

40|$|Fish removal {{has been}} used to restore {{temperate}} lakes, and positive effects on ecological state and water clarity have frequently been recorded in many lakes. Recently, a supplementary measure, transplantation of submerged macrophytes after fish removal, has been applied to restore warm <b>Chinese</b> shallow <b>lakes</b> in order to compensate for the expected lack of increasing grazing control of phytoplankton after the biomanipulation. These measures have successfully shifted turbid warm lakes to a clear water state, but {{little is known about the}} responses to restoration of key physico-chemical variables. We analyzed the seasonal variation in nutrient concentrations in two subtropical and one tropical biomanipulated shallow <b>Chinese</b> <b>lakes</b> subjected to restoration. In all three lakes, a marked decline occurred in the concentrations of lake total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), total suspended solids (TSS), and chlorophyll a (Chl a), while the transparency (SD:WD ratio, Secchi depth to water depth ratio) increased. A clear water state was established, lasting so far for 7 to 23 months, and TN, TP, Chl a, and TSS levels in the three restored lakes decreased to, on average, 49 %, 58 %, 41 %, and 18 % of the level prior to restoration and/or the level in a reference lake, respectively, while the annual mean SD:WD ratio exhibited a 1. 5 – 4 fold increase. In conclusion, lake restoration by transplantation of submerged macrophytes after fish removal had major positive effects on the physico-chemical variables in our study lakes. However, continuous control of omnivorous and herbivorous fish biomass is recommended as the fish typically present in warm, shallow lakes to some extent feed on submerged macrophytes, when available...|$|R
40|$|Water quality {{evaluation}} entails both randomness and fuzziness. Considering that water eutrophication evaluation in volves many ind ic es, different classifications and interval values, fuzzy variable sets theory {{was developed to}} Lake Baiyangdian as a study case. Taking reference to eutrophication standard of <b>Chinese</b> <b>lakes</b> and local characteristic of Lake Baiyangdian, eutrophication degree of lake was divided into 8 level s. Total phosphorus, total nitrogen, and COD Mn were selected as evaluation ind ic es in this research. Based on the measured data, index feature value matrix of sample was built. Index weights were determined by means of pure threshold value method. Relative membership de gree of each index to each classification was calculated with relative difference function model.

40|$|The {{water quality}} of L. Wuli and L. Mei 1 iang of L. Taihu in China, and the {{possibility}} of water cleaning by plants floating culture system were examined. The eutriphication of lake water are strongly affected by both domestic and industrial wastewater because of the about 90 % of wastewater without any treatments. Eutrophication has increased in most of the <b>Chinese</b> <b>lake</b> by high anthropogenic input of nutrients with the rapid progress human activity after the 1980 s. For almost elements of water of L. Wuli were more polluted compared with those of L. Meiliang. The relation of nitrogen concentration of water was NH(3 -) N > NO(3 -) N> N 0 (2 -) N in L. Wuli, and NO(3 -) N > NH(3 -) N > NO(2 -) N in L. Meiliang, respectively. From the results of water quality analysis, the nutrient concentrations were increased, but not polluted by some heavy metals and slightly increased by surfactants, anionic surface active agents. It seemed to be able to clean the lake water by plant floating culture methods with using many kinds of plants by the data of another experiments in phytotron and in natural field...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{seeks to}} address two {{specific}} questions. First, does {{the existence of}} polluted waters impact on the levels of satisfaction experienced by visitors to <b>Chinese</b> <b>lakes?</b> Second, does the local tourism industry (represented by a sample of hotel managers) correctly assess the importance of place attributes as assessed by visitors? The data pre- sented are obtained from a sample of 913 visitors to four polluted lakes that are holiday or day visit locations and from 121 managers of hotels in those same areas. The evidence suggests that polluted areas can still function successfully as tourist locations because visitors in these instances view the lakescapes {{as part of a}} wider attraction that includes a built environment but that the hotel industry over-emphasises the importance of that built structure as a contributor to tourist place experience. Limitations to the research include the role played by an aesthetic gaze, which may have more importance within a Chinese culture than among Western counterparts because, particularly for the older Chinese, concepts of harmonization with nature are directed through the visual senses and references to classical literature rather than physical participation in water-based sports.

40|$|Abstract Freshwater {{microbial}} diversity {{is subject to}} multi-ple stressors in the Anthropocene epoch. However, the effects of climate changes and human activities on freshwater proto-zoa remain poorly understood. In this study, the diversity and distribution of testate amoebae from the surface sediments were investigated in 51 <b>Chinese</b> <b>lakes</b> and reservoirs along two gradients, latitude and trophic status. A total of 169 taxa belonging to 24 genera were identified, and the most diverse and dominant genera were Difflugia (78 taxa), Centropyxis (26 taxa) and Arcella (12 taxa). Our analysis revealed that biomass of testate amoebae decreased significantly along the latitudinal gradient, while Shannon-Wiener indices and spe-cies richness presented an opposite trend (P< 0. 05). The rela-tionship of diversity and latitude is, we suspect, an artifact of the altitudinal distribution of our sites. Furthermore, biomass-based Shannon-Wiener index and species richness of testate amoebae were significantly unimodally related to trophic status (P< 0. 05). This is the first large-scale study showing the effects of latitude and trophic status on diversity and distribution of testate amoebae in China. Therefore, our results provide valuable baseline data on testate amoebae and contribute to lake management and {{our understanding of the}} large-scale global patterns in microorganism diversity...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyzed}} the {{spatial distribution of}} lake and reservoir water quality in China, and the trends from 2005 to 2010, based on monitoring data from 28 large <b>Chinese</b> <b>lakes</b> and reservoirs. We used a comprehensive water pollution index (WPI) to describe water quality and also identified the major pollutants. Using GDP data, we {{analyzed the}} relationships between economic factors and water quality. We found that although the water quality of large reservoirs is improving or remaining stable, despite economic growth, the water quality of most lakes either did not change or worsened. The outlook is pessimistic, as water quality in most lakes has decreased to Grade V or worse. The water quality was lowest for northern lakes and highest for southern lakes due {{to a combination of}} the local industrial structure and lower rainfall in the north. The primary pollutants generally remained stable during the study period. For some lakes, fluoride and volatile phenols became the primary pollutants, indicating more diverse sources of contamination. We divided the 28 bodies of water into four types based on the median WPI and GDP. The dominant combinations were low WPI with low GDP and high WPI with high GDP, {{as a result of the}} balance among economic development, the natural environment and environmental policy...|$|R
50|$|Thanks to his {{translation}} of this largely forgotten work, van Gulik {{became interested in}} Chinese detective fiction. To the translation he appended an essay on the genre in which he suggested that {{it was easy to}} imagine rewriting some of the old Chinese case histories with an eye toward modern readers. Not long afterward he himself tried his hand at creating a detective story along these lines. This became the book The Chinese Maze Murders (completed around 1950). As van Gulik thought the story would have more interest to Japanese and Chinese readers, he had it translated into Japanese by a friend (finished in 1951), and it was sold in Japan under the title Meiro-no-satsujin. With the success of the book, van Gulik produced a translation into Chinese, which was published by a Singapore book publisher in 1953. The reviews were good, and van Gulik wrote two more books (The Chinese Bell Murders and The <b>Chinese</b> <b>Lake</b> Murders) over the next few years, also with an eye toward Japanese and then Chinese editions. Next, van Gulik found a publisher for English versions of the stories, and the first such version was published in 1957. Later books were written and published in English first; the translations came afterwards.|$|R
