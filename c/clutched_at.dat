5|$|During a {{train ride}} to New York, the {{conductor}} {{told her to}} move into the smoking car. She refused, explaining her government service. He cursed at her and grabbed her, but she resisted and he summoned two other passengers for help. While she <b>clutched</b> <b>at</b> the railing, they muscled her away, breaking her arm in the process. They threw her into the smoking car, causing more injuries. As these events transpired, other white passengers cursed Tubman and shouted for the conductor to kick her off the train.|$|E
25|$|A {{soldier in}} Hancock's {{division}} reported {{movement in the}} Confederate line that led some {{to believe that the}} enemy might be retreating. Despite the unlikeliness of this supposition, the V Corps division of Brig. Gen. Andrew A. Humphreys was ordered to attack and capitalize on the situation. Humphreys led his first brigade on horseback, with his men moving over and around fallen troops with fixed bayonets and unloaded rifles; some of the fallen men <b>clutched</b> <b>at</b> the passing pant legs, urging their comrades not to go forward, causing the brigade to become disorganized in their advance. The charge reached to within 50 yards before being cut down by concentrated rifle fire. Brig. Gen. George Sykes was ordered to move forward with his V Corps regular army division to support Humphreys's retreat, but his men were caught in a crossfire and pinned down.|$|E
500|$|In 2005 David Crane {{published}} a new Scott biography {{in which he}} comes to the conclusion that Scott is possibly the only figure in polar history except Lawrence Oates [...] "so wholly obscured by legend". According to Barczewski, he goes some way towards an assessment of Scott [...] "free from the baggage of earlier interpretations". What has happened to Scott's reputation, Crane argues, derives from the way the world has changed since the [...] "hopeless heroism and obscene waste" [...] of the First World War. At the time of Scott's death, people <b>clutched</b> <b>at</b> the proof he gave that the qualities that once made Britain great were not extinct, but with the knowledge what lay only two years ahead, the ideals of duty, self-sacrifice, discipline, patriotism and hierarchy associated with his tragedy take on a different and more sinister colouring. Crane's main achievement, according to Barczewski, is the restoration of Scott's humanity, [...] "far more effectively than either Fiennes's stridency or Solomon's scientific data." [...] Daily Telegraph columnist Jasper Rees, likening the changes in explorers' reputations to climatic variations, suggests that [...] "in the current Antarctic weather report, Scott is enjoying his first spell in the sun for twenty-five years". The New York Times Book Review was more critical, pointing out Crane's support for Scott's account regarding the circumstances of the freeing of the Discovery from the pack ice, and concluded that [...] "For all the many attractions of his book, David Crane offers no answers that convincingly exonerate Scott from a significant share of responsibility for his own demise." ...|$|E

2500|$|When Wyatt {{and his men}} approached, the two men ran. Stilwell {{may have}} {{stumbled}} or been wounded, allowing Wyatt to reach him. Wyatt later said he shot Stilwell as Stilwell attempted to push the barrel of Earp's shotgun away. Wyatt, quoted in the Denver Republican, said [...] "I ran straight for Stilwell. It was he who killed my brother. What a coward he was! He couldn't shoot when I came near him. He stood there helpless and trembling for his life. As I rushed upon him he put out his hands and <b>clutched</b> <b>at</b> my shotgun. I let go both barrels, and he tumbled down dead and mangled at my feet." ...|$|E
2500|$|The attack {{occurred}} {{shortly after}} a Riesel radio broadcast. [...] Barry Gray, radio station WMCA's overnight talk radio host, had asked Riesel {{to substitute for}} him. Riesel invited two IUOE Local 138 leaders who were challenging the DeKonings {{for control of the}} local union to join him for the broadcast. The broadcast originated from Hutton's Restaurant at 47th Street and Lexington Avenue shortly after midnight on April 5, and concluded at 2 AM. Afterward, Riesel and his secretary went to Lindy's restaurant, located on Broadway between 49th Street and 50th Street. They had coffee, and departed Lindy's at 3 AM to walk to the secretary's automobile. Riesel removed his eyeglasses, which he did by habit when in public. A slender, black-haired man in blue and white jacket stepped out of the shadows of the entrance to the Mark Hellinger Theatre and threw a vial of sulphuric acid into Riesel's eyes. Riesel shouted, [...] "My gosh! My gosh!", and <b>clutched</b> <b>at</b> his face. While the secretary and others rendered assistance and dragged Riesel into Lindy's, the assailant walked calmly away.|$|E
2500|$|The {{second half}} opened with Illinois kicking off to Michigan. [...] Kirk caught {{the ball at}} either the 15-yard line, or the 20-yard line, and {{returned}} it 80 or 85 yards for a touchdown. [...] Illinois quarterback Dawson <b>clutched</b> <b>at</b> Kirk's ankles at the 12-yard line, but Kirk was able to shake free and fell into the end zone. [...] When Kirk fell across the goal line, the steel and concrete stands at Ferry Field vibrated vociferously as the crowd reacted to the play. [...] Bullion wrote that Kirk's 80-yard return [...] "will take rank with the most brilliant football achievements of any of Michigan's illustrious sons of the gridiron." [...] Michigan's third touchdown came on a fourth-down pass from Ray Knode to Herb Steger. [...] Steger {{was reported to have}} been standing across the goal line [...] "as clean as a hound's tooth unguarded." [...] Extra points were kicked by Paul Goebel and Ray Knode (2). [...] Goebel also kicked a field goal. [...] Michigan was penalized twice in the game, once for off-side and once for [...] "unnecessary holding." ...|$|E

2500|$|By 1978, Wood's {{depression}} had worsened, {{and he and}} {{his wife}} Kathy had become alcoholics. They were evicted from their Hollywood apartment on Yucca Street on Thursday, December 7, 1978 in total poverty. The couple moved into the North Hollywood apartment of their friend actor Peter Coe. Wood spent the weekend drinking vodka. Around noon on Sunday, December 10, Wood felt ill and went to lie down in Coe's bedroom. From the bedroom, he asked Kathy to bring him a drink which she refused to do. A few minutes later he yelled out, [...] "Kathy, I can't breathe!", a plea Kathy ignored as she later said she was tired of Wood's bossing her around. After hearing no movement from the bedroom for 20 minutes, Kathy sent a friend to check on Wood, who discovered him dead from a heart attack. Kathy later said, [...] "I still remember when I went into that room that afternoon and he was dead, his eyes and mouth were wide open. I'll never forget the look in his eyes. He <b>clutched</b> <b>at</b> the sheets. It looked like he'd seen hell." ...|$|E
