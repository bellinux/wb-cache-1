Overall, merchandise sales were 11 {{percent higher than the}} original targets, according to Rio 2016 spokesperson Mario Andrada. Two products, a hat in the shape of Vinicius's head and a pair of Havaianas bearing Vinicius, were, respectively, the best-selling and second-best-selling merchandise items during the 2016 Summer Olympics. Reporting for state broadcaster China Central Television (CCTV), Lucrécia Franco at what was CCTV America back then commented that merchandise of the mascots, among other Olympic merchandise, has contributed to strengthened trade relations between China and Brazil.|$|E
5|$|During {{preparations}} for the , Ron Dennis, the McLaren CEO and Chairman, noted that the team was encouraged by the aerodynamic data they had collected on the chassis, particularly its mid-corner speeds which he claimed {{were similar to those}} produced by other teams. He further added that the car's performance issues could be traced back to a lack of outright power and poor fuel efficiency from the engine. Éric Boullier, the team principal, further suggested that the main problem that the team faced was improving the efficiency of the RA615H's energy recovery systems, both in harvesting and deploying the additional power, and that by developing these areas, the car <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> several seconds on lap time, enough for the car to compete regularly for podium finishes.|$|E
5|$|Game {{designer}} Shigeru Miyamoto considers Space Invaders to be {{the game}} that revolutionized the video game industry; he was never interested in video games before seeing it. Hideo Kojima also described it as the first video game that impressed him and got him interested in video games. John Romero and John Carmack cited Space Invaders as their introduction to video games. Several publications ascribed {{the expansion of the}} video game industry from a novelty into a global industry {{to the success of the}} game. Edge magazine attributed the shift of video games from bars and arcades to more mainstream locations like restaurants and department stores to Space Invaders. Its popularity was such that it was the first game where an arcade machine's owner <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> for the cost of the machine in under one month, or in some places within one week.|$|E

5|$|The Japanese Combined Fleet {{was also}} seeking to draw Allied naval forces {{into what was}} hoped to be a decisive battle. Two fleet {{carriers}}— and —and one light carrier——arrived at the main Japanese naval base at Truk Atoll from Japan in early October and joined Shōkaku and Zuikaku. With five carriers fully equipped with air groups, plus their numerous battleships, cruisers, and destroyers, the Japanese Combined Fleet, directed by Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, was confident that it <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> for the defeat at the Battle of Midway. Apart {{from a couple of}} air raids on Henderson Field in October, the Japanese carriers and their supporting warships stayed in the northwestern area of the Solomon Islands, out of the battle for Guadalcanal and waiting for a chance to approach and engage the U.S. carriers. With the Japanese Army's next planned major ground attack on Allied forces on Guadalcanal set for 20 October, Yamamoto's warships began to move towards the southern Solomons to support the offensive and to be ready to engage any Allied (primarily U.S.) ships, especially carriers, that approached to support the Allied defenses on Guadalcanal.|$|E
25|$|While Germany had {{decreased}} its {{dependence on}} imported food from 35% in 1927 to 13% in 1939, 40% of its fat and oil food requirements had to be met by imports. Moreover, Germany's food requirements would grow further if it conquered nations that were also net food importers. Soviet imports of Ukrainian grains or Soviet trans-shipments of Manchurian soybeans <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> the shortfall.|$|E

25|$|AV actresses {{are usually}} {{recruited}} by scouts in Tokyo neighborhoods such as Roppongi, Shinjuku and Matahine. These scouts are affiliated with talent agencies who then hire the actresses to the AV production companies. Some women wishing {{to appear in}} AVs apply to the production companies, but they are usually referred to the talent agencies. The production companies are typically charged ¥1.5 million (US$15,000) or more for an actress to appear in a video. AV actresses make between ¥200,000 and 4 million yen per video. Steve Scott, president of Third World Media, an importer of Japanese adult movies to the United States, estimated a top-tier AV star <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> to nearly ¥36 million for an eight-picture deal.|$|E

500|$|As of March 2012 {{there was}} no {{labeling}} of the product, and only a USDA Organic label would have indicated that beef contained no [...] "pink slime". Per BPI, the finished product is 94% to 97% lean beef (with a fat content of 3% to 6%) has a nutritional value comparable to 90% lean ground beef, is very high in protein, low in fat, and contains iron, zinc and B vitamins. U.S. beef that contains up to 15% of the product can be labeled as [...] "ground beef". Up to 2005, filler <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> to 25% of ground meat. In an Associated Press review, food editor and cookbook author J.M. Hirsh compared the taste of two burgers: one supposedly containing LFTB and one traditional hamburger. He described the LFTB-containing burgers as smelling the same, but being less juicy and with not as much flavor.|$|E
500|$|The {{lack of a}} clear, defined {{expedition}} {{objective was}} aggravated by the failure to call at Cape Town on the way south, which meant that important equipment was not picked up. On South Georgia, Wild found little that <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> for this loss—there were no dogs on the island, so no sledging work could be carried out, which eliminated Wild's preferred choice of a revised expedition goal, an exploration of Graham Land on the Antarctic Peninsula. The death of Shackleton {{before the beginning of}} serious work was a heavy blow, and questions were raised about the adequacy of Wild as his replacement. Some reports imply that Wild drank heavily—"practically an alcoholic", according to Huntford. Mills suggests [...] that even if Shackleton had lived to complete the expedition, it is arguable whether under the circumstances it could have achieved more than it did under Wild's command.|$|E
500|$|Massa {{responded to}} Alonso's quick pace with his fastest lap time to {{increase}} the gap by four-tenths of a second. Button ran wide at the first corner and fell further [...] behind sixth-place driver Webber. Hamilton set a slow time which allowed Webber to close the gap to the former. Vettel became the first driver to make a scheduled pit stop for the hard-compound tyres on the 12th lap, and rejoined in sixth in front of Kubica. It was part of a strategy by Red Bull to place him into clear air in the hopes that he <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> some time on the leading Ferrari cars. Alguersuari drove alongside Yamamoto over the start/finish line and the Alguersuari passed Yamamoto for 19th entering the first corner on the same lap. Ferrari responded to Red Bull's decision by bringing Alonso and Massa in for their stops in quick succession, handing the lead to Button. Alonso rejoined ahead of Vettel, and was followed by Webber, but he exited the pit lane among a pack of slower cars and was immediately challenged by Kobayashi. Massa began to struggle with tyre temperatures and locked-up at turn two, and lost the balance of his car at the turn six hairpin.|$|E

2500|$|However, logistically, the Germans were {{starting}} to suffer serious problems in supplying their frontline just four weeks into the campaign. Richthofen lamented, [...] "the Germans are good at fighting but weak at logistics". While German production <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> for losses at the front, it took time to get aircraft to the sector. The common operating strength by late summer was 50 to 60 percent, including Fliegerkorps VIII. Between 19 July and 31 August, the Luftwaffe had lost 725 aircraft. Before the operations in the Soviet Union, scant attention {{had been made to}} logistical operations in the east, primarily because of German over-confidence.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the late}} 1930s, because an autarkic {{economic}} approach or {{an alliance with}} Britain were impossible, Germany needed to arrange closer relations with the Soviet Union, if not just for economic reasons alone.

[...] Moreover, Germany's food requirements would grow further if it conquered nations that were also net food importers. Soviet imports of Ukrainian grains or Soviet transshipments of Manchurian soybeans <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> the shortfall.
