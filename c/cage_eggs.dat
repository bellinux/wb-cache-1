In terms of sustainability, animal welfare is just one aspect that needs to be considered. Social aspects as well as environmental and economic factors need to be included as well. In this study, we assessed the sustainability of enriched cage, barn, free-range, and organic egg production systems following a predefined protocol. Indicators were selected within the social, environmental, and economic dimensions, after which parameter values and sustainability limits were set for the core indicators in order to quantify sustainability. Uncertainty in the parameter values as well as assigned weights and compensabilities of the indicators influenced the outcome of the sustainability assessment. Using equal weights for the indicators showed that, for the Dutch situation, enriched <b>cage</b> <b>egg</b> production was most sustainable, having the highest score on the environmental dimension, whereas free-range egg production gave the highest score in the social dimension (covering food safety, animal welfare, and human welfare). In the economic dimension both enriched <b>cage</b> <b>egg</b> and organic egg production had the highest sustainability score. When weights were attributed according to stakeholder outputs, individual differences were seen, but the overall scores were comparable to the sustainability scores based on equal weights. The provided method enabled a quantification of sustainability using input from stakeholders to include societal preferences in the overall assessment. Allowing for different weights and compensabilities helps policymakers in communicating with stakeholders involved and provides a weighted decision regarding future housing systems for laying hens...|$|R

40|$|The {{shell of}} the egg is {{essential}} in providing shape to the egg and ensuring safe packaging of the internal contents; however, shell defects {{have been shown to}} increase the risk of microbial contamination of eggs. Eggs were collected from commercial cage and free-range flocks at the ages of 25, 35, 45, 55, 65, and 75 wk. From each collection per flock, 30 eggs were processed for the eggshell and egg internal quality determination, 30 eggs for cuticle estimation, 30 eggs for mammillary layer ultrastructural features scoring, and 60 eggs for egg microbial enumeration. Translucency score and shell reflectivity were significantly higher in free-range eggs and increased with flock age in both production systems. Egg weight, shell weight, percentage shell, shell thickness, albumen height, Haugh unit, and yolk color were higher for <b>cage</b> <b>eggs.</b> The amount of cuticle was higher in <b>cage</b> <b>eggs</b> and fluctuated with flock age in both production systems. For the mammillary layer ultrastructural variables, a significant effect of production system and flock age was observed for early fusion, Type A bodies, and Type B bodies, whereas aragonite, depression, erosion, and hole were rarely observed. Variability of mammillary cap size, the incidence of poor mammillary cap quality, incidence of late fusion, alignment, Type A bodies, Type B bodies, and cubic cone formation were greater in the free-range versus cage system and increased with flock age in both production systems. The incidence of confluence and early fusion were greater in <b>cage</b> <b>eggs</b> and decreased with age in both production systems.

40|$|New Zealanders {{are among}} the highest egg {{consumers}} per capita in the world. Approximately 3. 4 million hens produce more than one billion eggs every year, the majority of which are produced in conventional cages. In recent {{years there has been}} a shift in consumer attitudes which has resulted in an increase in the demand for free range eggs. A trip to any supermarket reveals the premium consumers pay for free range eggs, compared with <b>cage</b> <b>eggs.</b> This paper analyses the regulation of free range eggs in New Zealand, focusing on how the regulation affects consumers. Most consumers choose to purchase free range eggs for ethical reasons believing that the hens enjoy a better standard of life. However unfortunately this is not always the case. The current regulation is fragmented and flawed which is allowing egg producers to deceive consumers. When it comes to free range eggs consumers are forced to rely on the honesty of producers as it is impossible to detect deception. This paper advocates for regulation reform through labelling. The introduction of an enforceable labelling standard is advocated for, which would hold producers accountable for their carton claims and ensure consumers are able to make informed product decisions...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT A two phase {{experiment}} {{was conducted with}} Leghorn pullets to study the effect of graded levels (0 to 18 Mg/kg feed) of vitamin D 3, 25 -OH-D 3, l, 25 -(OH) 2 -D 3, and la-OH-D 3 on production parameters and hatchability of eggs. Phase 1 was conducted with 21 -week-old pullets {{for a period of}} 13 weeks. There were 10 treatments with four replicates of 10 hens in each <b>cage.</b> <b>Eggs</b> were incubated weekly for a period of 8 weeks beginning when the hens were 26 weeks of age. Another phase of the {{experiment was}} started when the first phase was terminated and all hens in the different treatments were fed the same basal diet continuing with 1100 ICU D 3 /kg feed for a period of 12 days to study the daily changes and recovery in hatchability and egg production. The results of the first phase showed that egg production, egg shell weight, egg weight, and the percentage of eggs with soft shells were similar for all treatments. Only the highest level (9 Mg/kg feed) of both 1, 25 -(OH) 2 -D 3 and la-OH-D 3 showed slightly lower egg production and feed con-sumption. Vitamin D 3 and 25 -OH-D 3 supported excellent hatchability of eggs. In contrast, both levels of l, 25 -(OH) 2 -D 3 and the lower level of la-OH-D 3 were ineffective in improving hatch-ability over that obtained with the unsupplemental diet. During the recovery phase (phase 2), egg production and hatchability of eggs from pullets previ-ously fed the vitamin D 3 deficient diet recovered to normal after 8 and 10 days, respectively.

40|$|Dietary vitamin D may {{compensate}} for inadequate sun exposure; however, {{there have been}} few investigations into the vitamin D content of Australian foods. We measured vitamin D 3 and 25 -hydroxyvitamin D 3 (25 (OH) D 3) in four species of white fish (barramundi, basa, hoki and king dory), and chicken eggs (cage and free-range), purchased from five Australian cities. Samples included local, imported and wild-caught fish, and eggs of varying size from producers with a range of hen stocking densities. Raw and cooked samples were analysed using high performance liquid chromatography with photodiode array. Limits of reporting were 0. 2 and 0. 1 μg/ 100 g for vitamin D 3 and 25 (OH) D 3, respectively. The vitamin D 3 content of cooked white fish ranged from < 0. 1 to 2. 3 μg/ 100 g, and the 25 (OH) D 3 content ranged from 0. 3 to 0. 7 μg/ 100 g. The vitamin D 3 content of cooked <b>cage</b> <b>eggs</b> ranged from 0. 4 to 0. 8 μg/ 100 g, and the 25 (OH) D 3 content ranged from 0. 4 to 1. 2 μg/ 100 g.

If, as has been suggested, 25 (OH) D 3 has five times greater bioactivity than vitamin D 3, one cooked serve (100 g) of white fish, and one cooked serve of cage or free-range eggs (120 g) may provide 50 % or 100 %, respectively, of the current guidelines for the adequate intake of vitamin D (5 µg) for Australians aged 1 – 50 years...|$|E
40|$|We {{first tried}} {{to monitor the}} {{critical}} points for eggshell breakage in different logistic chains. Second, we examined {{whether there was a}} difference in eggshell strength among eggs produced in different housing systems. Finally, we developed a model to investigate the relation between eggshell strength and the likelihood of an egg cracking during handling and grading. Four logistic chains with different housing systems (battery cages, furnished cages, aviary, and free-range), all housing Bovans Goldline chickens in their mid-lay (45 wk), were compared. In every chain, a randomized set of 1, 500 eggs was sampled, and the strength was defined. At every critical point in every logistic chain, the eggs were reexamined for breakage. The classic and furnished cage systems showed the highest percentage of breakage directly at point of lay (6. 73 and 10. 72 %), whereas the other systems showed lower breakage (1. 94 % in the aviary and 1. 99 % in the free-range system). Further, in the logistic chain, grading and packing of the eggs generated the second highest percentage of breakage (from 1. 50 to 2. 65 %). Breakage due to transportation ranged from 0. 16 to 2. 65 %. There was a significant difference among the eggshell strength (shell stiffness and damping ratio) of eggs from chickens in different housing systems, showing eggs from chickens in the aviary system to be stronger than <b>cage</b> <b>eggs</b> (classic and furnished) and free-range eggs to be weaker than the other eggs. A significant correlation was found between eggshell strength and the likelihood of breakage in the production chains. In conclusion, it was first shown that, besides the laying, packing of the eggs is a critical point in the logistic chain of consumption eggs; second, the strength of the eggs in the different housing systems differed, and, finally, the eggshell stiffness and damping ratio of consumption eggs are an acceptable measure for rapid eggshell quality assessment and could provide a good predictive value for eggshell breakage in all types of table egg production chains. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Background: A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the effect of indoxacarb applied to cats on adult cat fleas, Ctenocephalides felis, flea egg production and adult flea emergence. Methods: Sixteen cats were selected for the study and allocated to two treatment groups. Eight cats were treated with a 19. 5 % w/v topical spot-on solution of indoxacarb on day 0 and eight cats served as untreated controls. Each cat was infested with 50 fleas on Days − 2, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 and 42. On Days 1, 2, and 3, and at 2 and 3 days after each post treatment reinfestation flea eggs were collected from the pan under each cat <b>cage.</b> <b>Eggs</b> were counted and viability assessed by evaluating adult flea emergence 28 days after egg collection. Three days after treatment or infestation, each cat was combed to remove and count live fleas. Results: Treatment with indoxacarb provided 100 % efficacy following infestations on day − 2, 7, 14, 21 and 28 and efficacy was 99. 6 % following infestations on days 35 and 42. Egg production from indoxacarb treated cats was reduced by 99. 9 % within 72 hours of treatment. For subsequent infestations no eggs were produced from treated cats from day 8 through day 30. Egg production was still reduced by ≥ 95. 8 % through day 45. Indoxacarb treatment also reduced adult flea emergence from eggs for 5 weeks after treatment. The combination of reduction in egg numbers and egg viability from indoxacarb treated cats reduced predicted flea emergence by 100 % from days 2 – 31 and 99. 9 %, 100 %, 96. 4 % and 99. 0 % on days 37, 38, 44 and 45, respectively. Conclusions: A topical spot-on formulation of indoxacarb provided ≥ 99. 6 % efficacy against flea infestations on cats for 6 weeks following a single treatment. Indoxacarb also eliminated or markedly reduced egg production for the entire evaluation period and reduced the viability of the few eggs that were produced from Day 1 through Day 38.

In the same fields, collections of naturally laid egg masses display different types of parasitized egg masses: only by T. basalis, only by O. telenomicida and by both species. The outcomes showed that T. basalis achieves a higher impact on the host population than O. telenomicida, even when multiparasitism occurs. Semi-field trials were conducted from July to September 2011, using pepper plants covered with mesh net {{in order to create}} small cages with five plants inside. In each <b>cage,</b> <b>egg</b> masses were placed on four plants located near to the cage corners and then T. basalis and O. telenomicida were released individually or simultaneously on the central plants. Egg masses were recollected after one week. The results showed that T. basalis achieves a high parasitization level when released alone but suffers competition by O. telenomicida when both species were simultaneously released...|$|R

Results clearly indicate, under conditions of this study, that performance as measured by egg production, egg weight, and mortality significantly deteriorated in a linear fashion progressing from the bottom to the top in three and four tier cages. Causes may be related to fear associated with differences in light intensity or differences in exposure to visual stimuli between the tiers.
