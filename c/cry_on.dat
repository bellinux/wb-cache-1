5|$|Principal {{photography}} for {{the pilot}} took place in Los Angeles, though subsequent episodes of the series are filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia to save money. The bridge sequences were shot at Lake Piru, near a War of the Worlds filming location, and the library and phone booth scenes were filmed at an elementary school. Triplet babies portrayed Sam in the episode's teaser, and production {{found it difficult to}} get them to <b>cry</b> <b>on</b> cue. Though a real house served as the first-story level in the teaser, the upstairs was constructed on a sound stage because of the special effects required for Mary's fiery death. Script rewrites for the opening sequence—a better introduction for Sam was needed—required reshoots on the set of The O.C. two months after principal photography.|$|E
5|$|Stephen Boyd {{was cast}} as the antagonist, Messala, on April 13, 1958. William Wyler {{originally}} wanted Heston for the role, but sought another actor after he moved Heston {{into the role of}} Judah Ben-Hur. Because both Boyd and Heston had blue eyes, Wyler had Boyd outfitted with brown contact lenses as a way of contrasting the two men. Marie Ney was originally cast as Miriam, but was fired after two days of work because she could not <b>cry</b> <b>on</b> cue. Heston says that {{he was the one who}} suggested that Wyler cast Martha Scott as Miriam, and she was hired on July 17, 1958. Cathy O'Donnell was Wyler's sister-in-law, and although her career was in decline, Wyler cast her as Tirzah.|$|E

25|$|Director Steven Spielberg said McQueen was {{his first}} choice for the {{character}} of Roy Neary in Close Encounters of the Third Kind. According to Spielberg, in a documentary on the Close Encounters DVD, Spielberg met him at a bar, where McQueen drank beer after beer. Before leaving, McQueen told Spielberg {{that he could not}} accept the role because he was unable to <b>cry</b> <b>on</b> cue. Spielberg offered to take the crying scene out of the story, but McQueen demurred, saying that it was the best scene in the script. The role eventually went to Richard Dreyfuss.|$|E
25|$|On 16 January 2015, Defoe joined Premier League club Sunderland after {{agreeing to}} a three-and-a-half-year deal, {{as part of}} a player {{exchange}} deal sending Jozy Altidore to Toronto FC, after completing only 11 months of his four-year deal with Toronto. He made his Sunderland debut the following day against former club Tottenham. Defoe started the match but was goalless when he was substituted after 75 minutes, ending his record of scoring on his first appearance for every club he has played for. Defoe scored his first Sunderland goal on his home debut in a 2–0 victory over Burnley on 31 January 2015. His second goal came the following week on 7 February 2015, where he scored the opening goal in a 1–1 draw away to Swansea City. On 5 April, he scored the only goal in the Tyne–Wear derby victory over Newcastle with a 22-yard volley to end a sequence of eight matches without a win, and their first victory under the management of Dick Advocaat. The emotion of scoring the goal caused him to <b>cry.</b> <b>On</b> 9 May, Defoe scored his fourth goal of the season in a 2–0 win against Everton at Goodison Park, a result which moved Sunderland out of the relegation zone and gave Everton their first home defeat of 2015.|$|E

25|$|Lou has a tempestuous {{relationship}} with her children-in-law Kathy and Arthur, blaming Kathy for Pete's first divorce (something Lou regards as unnatural, despite her fervent dislike of Pat), and showing displeasure at Arthur's unemployment; nothing he does is ever good enough for her daughter Pauline. In February 1985, she is furious to discover that Pauline is pregnant for the third time, her family already financially crippled by Arthur's long stint of unemployment. Lou isn't adverse to speaking her mind or scolding her family if she disapproves of their actions, but she soon comes to celebrate her grandson Martin's (Jon Peyton Price) birth – although she would have preferred him to be named Albert after her late husband. She is a strict traditionalist and moralist but she believes in strong family-values most of all, and will defend her family if any outsider dares to criticise them. She provides a warm shoulder to <b>cry</b> <b>on</b> when 16-year-old Michelle finds out she is pregnant in late 1985 and is supportive of her favourite grandchild, Ian, on his plans {{to work within the}} catering trade rather than following in his father's footsteps in a more masculine occupation. Lou collapses in late 1985, prompting Dr Legg to send Lou into hospital for some tests and she is diagnosed with angina. The family have to make changes within the household to accommodate Lou's health problems, such as moving her bedroom downstairs, however, Lou doesn't take well to the changes.|$|E
25|$|Wyler {{typically}} {{cast the}} Romans with British actors and the Jews with American actors to help underscore {{the divide between}} the two groups. The Romans were the aristocrats in the film, and Wyler believed that American audiences would interpret British accents as patrician. Marie Ney was originally cast as Miriam, but was fired {{after two days of}} work because she could not <b>cry</b> <b>on</b> cue. Heston says that {{he was the one who}} suggested that Wyler cast Martha Scott (who had played the mother of Heston's Moses in The Ten Commandments, and with whom he'd worked on Broadway) as Miriam. Scott was hired on July 17, 1958. Cathy O'Donnell was Wyler's sister-in-law, and although her career was in decline (Ben-Hur would be her last screen performance) Wyler cast her as Tirzah. More than 30 actresses were considered for the role of Esther. The Israeli actress Haya Harareet, a relative newcomer to film, was cast as Esther on May 16, 1958, after providing a 30-second silent screen test. Wyler had met her at the Cannes Film Festival, where she impressed him with her conversational skills and force of personality. Sam Jaffe was cast as Simonides on April 3, 1958, primarily because he had become famous for his roles as a wise old patriarch in a number of films. Finlay Currie was cast as Balthasar the same day as Jaffe. Wyler had to persuade Jack Hawkins to appear in the film, because Hawkins was unwilling to act in another epic motion picture so soon after The Bridge on the River Kwai. Wyler's efforts at persuasion were successful, and Hawkins was cast on March 18, 1958. Hugh Griffith, who gained acclaim in the post-World War II era in Ealing Studios comedies, was cast as the comical Sheik Ilderim. Finlay Currie had worked with Zimbalist before on Quo Vadis, playing St. Peter, was cast as Balthasar.|$|E

It was written by Carey, Bryan-Michael Cox, Adonis Shropshire and Kendrick Dean, and produced by the former two. [...] "I Stay in Love" [...] was released through Island Records on October 28, 2008, as the fourth and final single from the album. [...] Drawing influence from the [...] R music genre, the song features a piano and keyboard-driven melody, and a strong accompanying drum-beat. Lyrically, the song finds Carey getting [...] "her <b>cry</b> <b>on</b> with the connect-the-dots break-up track." [...] She describes the old time she shared with her love interest.

500|$|Richard Dreyfuss as Roy Neary, an {{electrical}} lineman in Indiana who encounters and forms {{an obsession with}} unidentified flying objects. Steve McQueen was Spielberg's first choice. Although McQueen {{was impressed with the}} script, he felt he was not right for the role as he was unable to <b>cry</b> <b>on</b> cue. Dustin Hoffman, Al Pacino and Gene Hackman turned down the part as well. Jack Nicholson turned it down because of scheduling conflicts. Spielberg explained when filming Jaws, [...] "Dreyfuss talked me into casting him. He listened to about 155 days' worth of Close Encounters. He even contributed ideas." [...] Dreyfuss reflected, [...] "I launched myself into a campaign to get the part. I would walk by Steve's office and say stuff like 'Al Pacino has no sense of humor' or 'Jack Nicholson is too crazy'. I eventually convinced him to cast me." ...|$|E
500|$|Bruce, {{and those}} close to him, blamed Markham for this omission. The matter was raised, repeatedly, with anyone thought to have influence. Robert Rudmose Brown, chronicler of the Scotia voyage and later Bruce's first biographer, wrote in a 1913 letter to the President of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society that this neglect was [...] "a slight to Scotland and to Scottish endeavour". Bruce wrote in March 1915 to the President of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, who agreed in his reply that [...] "Markham had much to answer for". After Markham's death in 1916 Bruce sent a long letter to his Member of Parliament, Charles Price, {{detailing}} Sir Clements's malice towards him and the Scottish expedition, ending with a heartfelt <b>cry</b> <b>on</b> behalf of his old comrades: [...] "Robertson is dying without his well won white ribbon!

500|$|Kate McCann's {{appearance}} and demeanour were widely discussed, {{with much of}} the commentary coming from other women, including Booker Prize-winner Anne Enright in the London Review of Books. Kate was deemed cold and controlled, too attractive, too thin, too well-dressed, too intense. She had apparently been advised by abduction experts not to <b>cry</b> <b>on</b> camera because the kidnapper might enjoy her distress, and this led to more criticism: the Portuguese tabloid Correio da Manhã cited sources complaining that she had not [...] "shed a single tear". Journalism professor Nicola Goc argued that Kate had joined a long list of mothers deemed killers because of unacceptable maternal behaviour. Commentators compared her experience to that of Lindy Chamberlain, convicted of murder after her baby was killed by a dingo. Like Kate, she was suspected, in part, because she did not weep in public. There was even a similar (false) story about supposedly relevant Bible passages the women were said to have highlighted. Chamberlain asked: [...] "How can you apologise to me and do this again to someone else?" ...|$|E
500|$|... "I Stay in Love" [...] is a [...] "beat-driven" [...] and [...] "piano-laced" [...] ballad, that is {{influenced}} by pop and R music genres. The song's instrumentation is derived from a piano melody, and is backed by a strong computerized drum-beat. It is composed in the key of D major, with Carey's vocals spanning from the low note of D3 to the high note of G5. The song moves at a slow tempo of 65 beats per minute in cut time, and it follows a chord progression of D–Bm7–G–A. [...] The song features a [...] "double voice" [...] effect during its final chorus, where Carey's normal singing tone {{throughout the rest of}} the song is combined with her raised pitch. She raises the pitch one octave, and layers it over her normal tone. Lyrically, the song finds Carey getting [...] "her <b>cry</b> <b>on</b> with the connect-the-dots break-up track." [...] She describes the old time she shared with her lover. She also admits that even though they did attempt to save their relationship, and that she knows that it is definitely over, she still [...] "stays in love with him".|$|E
500|$|Literary scholar Patricia Lee Yongue {{identifies}} Lincoln as {{the falling}} star. Further, she contrasts {{the dialectic of}} the [...] "powerful western falling star" [...] with a [...] "nascent spring" [...] and describes it {{as a metaphor for}} Lincoln's death meant to [...] "evoke powerful, conflicting emotions in the poet which transport him back to that first and continuously remembered rebellion signaling the death of his own innocence." [...] Biographer Betsy Erkkila writes that Whitman's star is [...] "the fallen star of America itself", and characterizes Whitman's association as [...] "politicopoetic myth to counter Booth's <b>cry</b> <b>on</b> the night of the assassination—Sic Semper Tyrannis—and the increasingly popular image of Lincoln as a dictatorial leader bent on abrogating rather than preserving basic American liberties". The star, seemingly immortal, is associated with Lincoln's vision for America—a vision of reconciliation and a national unity or identity that could only survive the president's death if Americans resolved to continue pursuing it. However, Vendler says that the poem dismisses the idea of a personal immortality through the symbol of the star, saying: [...] "the star sinks, and it is gone forever." ...|$|E
