5|$|According to British writer Errol Fuller, aviculturalists are rumoured to have bred birds {{similar in}} {{appearance}} to the <b>Cuban</b> macaw. These birds, however, are reportedly larger in size than the <b>Cuban</b> macaw, having been bred from larger macaw species.|$|E
5|$|All {{but one of}} {{the major}} iguana {{concentrations}} are either partially or fully protected by the <b>Cuban</b> government. Although no captive-breeding program exists within Cuba, the Centro Nacional de Areas Protegidas (the National Center for Protected Areas) has suggested it will explore this route in the future. In 1985 the <b>Cuban</b> government issued a commemorative peso depicting a <b>Cuban</b> iguana on the head side of the coin in an attempt to raise awareness for this animal.|$|E
5|$|At a {{press conference}} {{arranged}} by <b>Cuban</b> authorities on 30 July, Modig and Carromero stated that the crash was an accident and no other car was involved. Speaking in 2013 to the Washington Post, Carromero denied this version of events, stating {{that he had been}} drugged and threatened by <b>Cuban</b> authorities who had forced him to make a false statement. He stated instead that the car had been rammed by another vehicle with <b>Cuban</b> government license plates, causing the fatal crash.|$|E

50|$|In recent years, Puerto Rico {{has become}} a major {{drop-off}} point for <b>Cubans</b> trying to reach the United States illegally. As a U.S. Commonwealth, Puerto Rico is seen as a stepping stone for <b>Cubans</b> {{trying to get to the}} continental U.S., though Puerto Rico itself is home to a number of <b>Cubans.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Cubans</b> cannot read books, {{magazines}} or newspapers {{unless they}} have been approved/published by the government. <b>Cubans</b> can not receive publications from abroad or from visitors.|$|R
5|$|Austin Hobart Clark {{reported}} that juvenile <b>Cuban</b> macaws were green, {{though he did}} not provide any source for this claim. It is unclear whether green birds spotted on the island were in fact juvenile <b>Cuban</b> macaws or if they were instead feral military macaws (Ara militaris).|$|E
5|$|Betances also {{promoted}} {{direct intervention}} of Puerto Ricans in the <b>Cuban</b> independence struggle, which eventually {{happened in the}} <b>Cuban</b> War of Independence (1895–98). Spain had promoted political reform in Puerto Rico, and the local political climate was not conducive to a second revolution at the time. Therefore, Betances and the Puerto Rican revolutionaries ceded their caches of firearms hidden in Saint Thomas, Curaçao and Haiti to the <b>Cuban</b> rebels in October 1871, since their struggle was deemed as a priority.|$|E
5|$|Cuba {{has been}} the most {{successful}} team, winning the most gold and silver medals and never finishing outside the podium. <b>Cuban</b> pitcher Pedro Luis Lazo is the most successful individual athlete, winning four medals—two gold and two silver—from 1996 to 2008. Nine other <b>Cuban</b> players won three medals; no player from any other nation accomplished this feat. From the 25 athletes who won two medals in baseball, 18 were <b>Cuban,</b> while the remaining seven included 4 South Korean and 3 Japanese players.|$|E

5|$|In May 2002, Payá {{presented}} NAPP with 11,020 signatures {{calling for}} a referendum on safeguarding {{freedom of speech and}} assembly, allowing private business ownership, and ending one-party rule. On 3 October 2003, he delivered an additional 14,000 signatures. Former U.S. president Jimmy Carter endorsed the petition when granted a chance to speak on <b>Cuban</b> television, bringing Payá's efforts to the attention of a wide <b>Cuban</b> audience. <b>Cuban</b> President Fidel Castro described the petition drive as a U.S.-backed conspiracy to overthrow his government.|$|E
5|$|James Buchanan {{was easily}} elected President in 1856. Although he {{remained}} committed to <b>Cuban</b> annexation, he was hindered by popular opposition {{and the growing}} sectional conflict.

5|$|The 1999 Baltimore Orioles– <b>Cuban</b> {{national}} {{baseball team}} exhibition series {{consisted of two}} exhibition games played between the Baltimore Orioles of Major League Baseball (MLB) and the <b>Cuban</b> national baseball team on March 28 and May 3, 1999. The first game took place in Havana, while the second was held in Baltimore. This series {{marked the first time}} that the <b>Cuban</b> national team had faced a squad composed solely of major league players and the first time an MLB team played in Cuba since 1959.|$|E
5|$|The 310 series (the Model 318) {{also saw}} transatlantic service with Cubana de Aviación {{starting}} in 1958, {{in spite of}} the <b>Cuban</b> Revolution the airline had a special accord with British aircraft manufacturers to maintain this model of aircraft. In 1975 <b>Cuban</b> Britannias were used to transport hundreds of soldiers of the <b>Cuban</b> Revolutionary Armed Forces to Angola in Operation Carlota, a proxy war. Cubana de Aviación continued using various Britannias until March 1990.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Cuban</b> iguana is {{distributed}} throughout the rocky southern coastal areas of mainland Cuba and its surrounding islets with a feral population thriving on Isla Magueyes, Puerto Rico. A subspecies is found on the Cayman Islands of Little Cayman and Cayman Brac. Females guard their nest sites and often nest in sites excavated by <b>Cuban</b> crocodiles. As a defense measure, the <b>Cuban</b> iguana often makes its home within or near prickly-pear cacti.|$|E
25|$|However, the United States, {{rather than}} Latin America, was {{the frame of}} {{reference}} for educated <b>Cubans.</b> <b>Cubans</b> travelled to the United States, read American newspapers, listened to American radio, watched American television, and were attracted to American culture. Middle-class <b>Cubans</b> grew frustrated at the economic gap between Cuba and the US. The middle class became increasingly dissatisfied with the administration, while labour unions supported Batista until the very end.|$|R
50|$|Midway {{through the}} 1945 season, Santiago left the Black Crackers and {{signed with the}} New York <b>Cubans</b> of the Negro National League. He played second base and shortstop for the <b>Cubans</b> in 1945 and 1946.|$|R
50|$|The European {{heritage}} of <b>Cubans</b> comes primarily from one source: the Spaniards (including Canarians, Asturians, Catalans, Galicians and Castilians).The native white population are nearly all {{descendants of the}} Spaniards and most non-white <b>Cubans</b> also have Spanish ancestry.|$|R
5|$|The <b>Cuban</b> {{national}} team next {{played in the}} United States during the 2006 World Baseball Classic (WBC). President George W. Bush attempted to prevent the <b>Cuban</b> team from participating in the tournament, but other nations promised to withdraw if Cuba was barred. The next American team to travel to Cuba were the Tampa Bay Rays, who will play an exhibition against the <b>Cuban</b> {{national team}} in March 2016.|$|E
5|$|The {{second game}} {{was held at}} Oriole Park at Camden Yards in Baltimore on May 3, 1999, in front of 47,940 fans. By May 3, the Orioles had a 7–17 win-loss record in the 1999 MLB season. The <b>Cuban</b> {{national}} team, meanwhile, was stronger than during the first game, as the 1998–99 <b>Cuban</b> National Series had concluded and players who were not available for {{the first game of}} the exhibition joined the <b>Cuban</b> team. A 300-person delegation accompanied the <b>Cuban</b> team, including members of the <b>Cuban</b> media, students, and retired players. MLB requested the Federal Aviation Administration clear the airspace above Camden Yards for the game, in response to an attempt by a Miami-based pilot and veteran of the Bay of Pigs invasion, to drop anti-Castro leaflets over Estadio Latinoamericano during the first game.|$|E
5|$|The series {{created a}} good deal of criticism, {{especially}} among the <b>Cuban</b> American community. MLB umpire Rich Garcia, who is of <b>Cuban</b> descent, opposed the series. MLB umpires filed a grievance against MLB attempting to block them from being sent to umpire the game in Cuba, and refused to officiate the game in Baltimore. Rafael Palmeiro, an Oriole player of <b>Cuban</b> descent, also opposed the series and did not make the trip to Cuba. The <b>Cuban</b> American National Foundation protested the series.|$|E
5000|$|The Long Branch <b>Cubans</b> (also {{known as}} the Newark <b>Cubans</b> and the Jersey City <b>Cubans)</b> were a {{professional}} baseball team that played from 1913 to 1916. It was the first U.S. minor league baseball team composed almost entirely of <b>Cubans.</b> Several players, including Dolf Luque and Mike González, went on {{to play in the}} major leagues. The <b>Cubans</b> played in Long Branch, New Jersey from 1913 to 1915, except {{for the first half of}} the 1914 season, when they played in Newark, New Jersey. In 1916, they started the season playing in Jersey City, New Jersey as the [...] "Jersey City Cubans." [...] Later that summer, they moved their home games to Poughkeepsie, New York, where they were usually referred to as the [...] "Long Branch Cubans." [...] In late July 1916 they briefly moved to Harlem and finally to Madison, New Jersey in August.|$|R
50|$|The 2011 Uruguayan census {{revealed}} 456 people declaring Cuba {{as their}} country of birth. As of 2013, there are just 6 <b>Cubans</b> registered in the Uruguayan social security. Official sources show that over 1,700 <b>Cubans</b> entered Uruguay in 2016.|$|R
50|$|It is {{estimated}} that 268,000 <b>Cubans</b> worked to eliminate illiteracy during the Year of Education, and around 707,000 <b>Cubans</b> became literate by December 22, 1961. By 1962, the country’s literacy rate was 96%, {{one of the highest}} in the world.|$|R
5|$|Anarchism as {{a social}} {{movement}} in Cuba held great influence with the working classes during the 19th and early 20th century. The movement was particularly strong following {{the abolition of slavery}} in 1886, until it was repressed first in 1925 by President Gerardo Machado, and finally by Fidel Castro's Marxist–Leninist government following the <b>Cuban</b> Revolution in the late 1950s. <b>Cuban</b> anarchism mainly took the form of anarcho-collectivism based on the works of Mikhail Bakunin and, later, anarcho-syndicalism. The Latin American labor and by extension the <b>Cuban</b> labor movement itself was at first more influenced by anarchism than Marxism.|$|E
5|$|Betances openly hated Estrada when {{he first}} met him in the late 1870s, but grew more {{tolerant}} of him with time, and even defended Estrada's actions as leader when he assumed control of the <b>Cuban</b> Revolutionary Party. The Puerto Rican affiliates to the Party viewed Estrada's leadership with great skepticism, since Estrada sympathized {{with the idea of}} having the United States intervene in the <b>Cuban</b> independence war to have the Spanish evicted from Cuba. They suspected that his weak leadership allowed opportunists to profit from an invasion and even suggest that the United States keep Puerto Rico in exchange for independence for Cuba. Some written evidence points to the truth of their affirmations, at least to the extent of wanting to have the Puerto Rican section of the <b>Cuban</b> Revolutionary Party shut down, which eventually did happen.|$|E
