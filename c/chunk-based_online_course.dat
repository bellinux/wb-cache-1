40|$|Dissertation[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] This interpretative phenomenological {{case study}} {{examined}} emerging phenomenon of <b>online</b> <b>course</b> migration across different LMSs for virtual high school K- 12 students. Rapid growth of K- 12 e-learning demands a powerful Learning Management System (LMS) for <b>online</b> <b>course</b> delivery. When legacy <b>online</b> <b>courses</b> were moved from early generation LMSs to more advanced LMSs, <b>online</b> <b>course</b> migration processes {{were needed to}} be understood by stakeholders (e. g. LMS vendors, school administrators, instructional designers, instructors, and students). In this study, 175 self-paced <b>online</b> <b>courses</b> and 31 semester-based <b>online</b> <b>courses</b> were migrated from two previous LMSs into Canvas LMS. A wide range of data were collected and analyzed to identify instructional designers’ experience in this <b>online</b> <b>course</b> migration process. Key {{findings of this study}} identified <b>online</b> <b>course</b> migration processes in five categories: project planning and management, course migration exploration, course migration enactment, course migration evaluation, and project reflection. Further, the differences and similarities between self-paced and semester-based <b>online</b> <b>course</b> migrations were identified focusing on course migration procedures and the Canvas LMS feature. The findings of this study will be helpful for relevant stakeholders to understand on how instructional designers migrated <b>online</b> <b>courses</b> from different LMSs to Canvas, and what supports need to be provided for <b>online</b> <b>course</b> migration practice. In addition, results from this study will be helpful to other virtual high schools that are migrating <b>online</b> <b>courses</b> and seeking examples of how instructional designers apply tools, skills, and strategies to <b>online</b> <b>course</b> migration for K- 12 e-learning...|$|R

As the number of students taking <b>online</b> <b>courses</b> {{have increased}}, so has {{the number of students who}} have dropped or failed an <b>online</b> <b>course.</b> According to the literature, <b>online</b> <b>courses</b> may have higher drop rates than traditional, face-to-face courses. The number of students who fail an <b>online</b> <b>course</b> is, also, of concern. As <b>online</b> <b>courses</b> may continue to grow over the next few decades, studies on persistence in <b>online</b> <b>courses</b> may benefit students, administrators, instructional designers, educators, and researchers. Although previous research studies have addressed persistence in <b>online</b> <b>courses,</b> very few examine it from the perspectives of students who were unsuccessful in their courses. These students may have unique insights about the online experience that may have related to their lack of success. The purpose of this study was to understand the experiences of university students who have failed or dropped an <b>online</b> <b>course</b> through the lenses of transactional distance theory and Kember’s model of dropout in distance education. Transactional distance theory discusses the dialog, structure, and learner autonomy involved in an <b>online</b> <b>course,</b> while, Kember’s model presents categories that may relate to dropping an <b>online</b> <b>course.</b> Together, the theory and model may help in understanding the experiences of students who have dropped or failed an <b>online</b> <b>course.</b> In this study, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 participants from a large Southeastern university in the United States. Based on the participants’ responses, the data was sorted and ranked according to the amount of transactional distance in their courses, as well as the categories of Kember’s model. Many of the participants who experienced low or high transactional distance have, also, expressed an issue with the goal commitment category of Kember’s model. Additionally, there were important differences in the student characteristics of those who dropped or failed an <b>online</b> <b>course.</b> Furthermore, suggestions for improving <b>online</b> <b>courses</b> were given by the participants. Some of these suggestions included more student-instructor interactions, the use of more technology tools in their <b>online</b> <b>course,</b> and for orientations to the online environment to be offered. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to propose {{measures}} of <b>online</b> open <b>course</b> success for non-commercial institutional providers of massive open <b>online</b> <b>courses</b> (MOOCs) and other scaleable open <b>online</b> <b>courses</b> (SOOCs). Design/methodology/approach – The measures are derived from the characteristics of open <b>online</b> <b>courses,</b> existing knowledge about open <b>online</b> <b>course</b> providers and users and their motivations, and current practice in MOOC evaluation and data analytics. Findings – Current practices for evaluation of open <b>online</b> <b>courses</b> are dominated by MOOC analytics which provide insights into user demographics and behaviour with some implications for evaluation of reach and course design but leaving many unknowns. Measures for evaluation of success at the institutional level can be derived from institutional goals for open <b>online</b> <b>courses.</b> Success from the point of view of teachers and technical teams involved in design, development and delivery of open <b>online</b> <b>courses</b> can be derived from team members’ expectations, resources and satisfaction as well as measures of cost and effort compared to budget and benchmarks.
