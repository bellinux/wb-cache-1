5|$|It is {{most common}} amongst the kwongan heath of the Geraldton Sandplains north of Jurien; {{it has a}} fairly <b>continuous</b> <b>distribution</b> there, often as the {{dominant}} species, and extends inland to around the 350mm isohyet. On the Swan Coastal Plain to the south, its distribution is discontinuous, being largely confined to patches of suitable sand in the narrow transition zone where tuart forest gives way to jarrah forest. With {{the exception of a}} population at Point Walter (32°00′S), it does not occur on the sandplain south of the Swan River.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{the spotted}} hyena was {{widespread}} throughout Sub-Saharan Africa. It {{is present in}} all habitats save for the most extreme desert conditions, tropical rainforests {{and the top of}} alpine mountains. Its current distribution is patchy in many places, especially in West Africa. Populations are concentrated in protected areas and surrounding land. There is a <b>continuous</b> <b>distribution</b> over large areas of Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Botswana, Namibia and the Transvaal Lowveld areas of South Africa. During the 1770s and 1780s the species was still widespread in southern and western South Africa, being recorded i.a. on the Cape Peninsula and Cape Flats, and near present-day Somerset West, Riviersonderend, Mossel Bay, George, Joubertina, Gamtoos River, Jansenville, Cannon Rocks, Alice, Onseepkans and Augrabies Falls.|$|E
25|$|When the {{probability}} density {{function of a}} <b>continuous</b> <b>distribution</b> has multiple local maxima {{it is common to}} refer to all of the local maxima as modes of the distribution. Such a <b>continuous</b> <b>distribution</b> is called multimodal (as opposed to unimodal).|$|E

25|$|The normal {{distribution}} {{is the only}} absolutely <b>continuous</b> <b>distribution</b> whose cumulants beyond the first two (i.e., other than the mean and variance) are zero. It is also the <b>continuous</b> <b>distribution</b> with the maximum entropy for a specified mean and variance. Geary has shown, assuming that the mean and variance were finite, that the {{normal distribution}} is the only distribution where the mean and variance are independent. This theorem was later reproved by Lukas who only assumed that the variance was finite.|$|E
25|$|Until recently, {{biologists}} {{considered the}} red deer and elk or wapiti (C. canadensis) the same species, forming a <b>continuous</b> <b>distribution</b> throughout temperate Eurasia and North America.

25|$|In reality, {{there is}} {{interaction}} between the electrons {{with each other and}} the atomic cores of the crystal. This has several consequences: For example, the unambiguous relation between energy and momentum of an electronic state is broken and an electronic band structure is formed. Measuring the momentum of one electronic state gives a distribution of momenta which are all separated by reciprocal lattice vectors. Hence, an ACAR measurement on a solid with completely filled bands (i.e. on an insulator) gives a <b>continuous</b> <b>distribution.</b> An ACAR measurement on a metal has discontinuities where bands cross the Fermi level in all Brillouin zones in reciprocal space. This discontinuous distribution is superimposed by a <b>continuous</b> <b>distribution</b> from the entirely filled bands. From the discontinuities the Fermi surface can be extracted.|$|E

2500|$|When it's {{convenient}} {{to work with}} a dominating measure, the Radon-Nikodym theorem is used to define a density as the Radon-Nikodym derivative of the probability distribution of interest with respect to this dominating measure. [...] Discrete densities are usually defined as this derivative with respect to a counting measure over the set of all possible outcomes. [...] Densities for absolutely <b>continuous</b> <b>distributions</b> are usually defined as this derivative with respect to the Lebesgue measure. [...] If a theorem can be proved in this general setting, it holds for both discrete and <b>continuous</b> <b>distributions</b> as well as others; [...] separate proofs are not required for discrete and <b>continuous</b> <b>distributions.</b>|$|R
25|$|The Compton {{distribution}} is a <b>continuous</b> <b>distribution</b> that is present up to channel 150 in Figure 1. The distribution arises because of primary gamma rays undergoing Compton scattering within the crystal: Depending on the scattering angle, the Compton electrons have different energies and hence produce pulses in different energy channels.|$|E
25|$|The {{first term}} is the angular {{momentum}} {{of the center of}} mass relative to the origin. Similar to Single particle, below, it is the angular momentum of one particle of mass M at the center of mass moving with velocity V. The second term is the angular {{momentum of the}} particles moving relative to the center of mass, similar to Fixed center of mass, below. The result is general — the motion of the particles is not restricted to rotation or revolution about the origin or center of mass. The particles need not be individual masses, but can be elements of a <b>continuous</b> <b>distribution,</b> such as a solid body.|$|E
