25|$|After the £10 Airport Development Fee was {{introduced}} {{at the start}} of 2009, a new airline was sought to replace Ryanair on its very popular route to Dublin. Aer Arann were their successors and commenced operations shortly after. The short hop over the Irish Sea is operated 4 times a week by either an ATR 42 or the larger ATR 72 turboprop aircraft. The route has proven to be very popular and has the possibility of catching a <b>connecting</b> <b>flight</b> to New York directly from Dublin.

25|$|Busy Bee started {{flights to}} Molde on 3 March 1980, using a F-27 to fly post to Oslo. Passengers were {{introduced}} on these flights from 1985. Braathens SAFE sold their F-28s in 1986. The West Coast route saw only an average 32 passengers {{to and from}} Bergen and Stavanger, and 23 to Kristiansund per day. Too small for Boeings, Braathens subcontracted the operations to is regional affiliate, Busy Bee, from March 1986. Patronage to Oslo increased sufficiently that Braathens the same year eliminated all stop-overs in Ålesund. The first proposals for charter flights were launched by Gullivers Reisebyrå in January 1986. They intended to fly a <b>connecting</b> <b>flight</b> to Oslo Airport, Gardermoen and from there onwards to the Mediterranean. Although a contract was signed with Busy Bee, noting came of the plans due to limited interest. Widerøe withdrew from services at Molde in 1987.|$|E
25|$|With the 1952 World Championship {{being run}} to Formula Two specifications, Alfa Romeo {{were unable to}} use their {{supercharged}} Alfettas and withdrew.

Fangio had agreed to drive for Maserati in a non-championship race at Monza {{the day after the}} Dundrod race, but having missed a <b>connecting</b> <b>flight</b> he decided to drive through the night from Paris, arriving half an hour before the start. Badly fatigued, Fangio started the race {{from the back of the}} grid but lost control on the second lap, crashed into a grass bank, and was thrown out of the car as it flipped end over end. He was taken to hospital with multiple injuries, the most serious being a broken neck, and spent the rest of 1952 recovering in Argentina.|$|E
25|$|Over the {{following}} days, Chikatilo confessed to a further 22 killings {{which had not}} been connected to the case, either because the murders had been committed outside the Rostov Oblast, because the bodies had not been found, or, {{in the case of}} Yelena Zakotnova, because an innocent man had been convicted and executed for the murder. (Aleksandr Kravchenko received a posthumous pardon for Yelena Zakotnova's murder.) As had been the case with the victims compiled upon the initial list of charges, Chikatilo was able to provide details of these additional killings only the perpetrator could have known: one of these additional victims, 14-year-old Lyubov Volobuyeva, had lived in south-western Siberia, and had been killed in a sorghum field near Krasnodar Airport on 25 July 1982. Chikatilo recalled that he had killed Volobuyeva in a millet field, and that he had approached the girl as she sat in the waiting rooms at Krasnodar Airport. Volobuyeva, Chikatilo stated, had informed him she lived in the Siberian city of Novokuznetsk, and was awaiting a <b>connecting</b> <b>flight</b> at the airport to visit relatives.|$|E

500|$|The {{muscles that}} control flight in insects {{can take up}} to 10% to 30% of the total body mass. The muscles that control flight vary with the two types of flight found in insects: {{indirect}} and direct. Insects that use first, indirect, have the muscles attach to the tergum instead of the wings, as the name suggests. As the muscles contract, the thoracic box becomes distorted, transferring the energy to the wing. There are two [...] "bundles" [...] of muscles, those that span parallel to the tergum, the dorsolongitudinals, and those that are attached to the tegum and extend to the sternum, the dorsoventrals. In direct muscle, the connection is directly from the pleuron (thoracic wall) to individual sclerites located {{at the base of the}} wing. The subalar and basalar muscles have ligament attachments to the subalar and basalar sclerites. Here resilin, a highly elastic material, forms the ligaments <b>connecting</b> <b>flight</b> muscles to the wing apparatus.|$|E
