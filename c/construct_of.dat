5|$|Unlike {{the regular}} Sharingan, which appears {{identical}} from user to user, the Mangekyō Sharingan's tomoe seal differs between individuals. Its abilities were usually derived from Japanese mythology, hence giving the interpretation {{that they are}} one of the divine and most powerful ninja techniques ever used. Also, the Mangekyō seems to grant different kinds of abilities to each of its users, though some might share the same jutsu, as Sasuke and Itachi share the ability to perform Amaterasu, while all members have the potential to construct a Susanoo. Features of the Mangekyō Sharingan include Tsukuyomi and Amaterasu. When the user has mastered the full power of both of their eyes, regardless of what kind of Mangekyō abilities they have, the user gains the ability to create a <b>construct</b> <b>of</b> chakra called a Susanoo. Other Mangekyō abilities include Kamui and , awakened in Shisui's Mangekyō Sharingan, which granted him the ability to control other people's minds without them knowing.|$|E

30|$|The {{stages of}} {{implementation}} were {{developed from the}} static <b>constructs</b> <b>of</b> the CFIR. Some constructs related to specific implementation stages, whereas others transcended several stages. Firstly, the <b>constructs</b> <b>of</b> the Intervention Characteristics domain formed the designing stage. Secondly, the <b>constructs</b> <b>of</b> External Settings varied; Patients’ Needs and Resources generally related to the designing stage, whereas External Policy and Incentives {{were part of the}} purpose stage. The <b>constructs</b> <b>of</b> the domains of Inner Setting and Personal Characteristics related to the preparing stage. Finally, the constructs related to the domain of Process transcended the stages.|$|R

They contain augite and olivine crystals. Their crystallization ages, compared to a crater count chronology of different regions on Mars, suggest the nakhlites formed on the large volcanic <b>construct</b> <b>of</b> either Tharsis, Elysium, or Syrtis Major Planum.|$|E
25|$|David Spiegel {{also argued}} that Rind et al.'s {{suggestion}} of relabeling some forms of sexual encounters between adults and children/adolescents as adult-child (or adult-adolescent) sex is fundamentally flawed, because children cannot give meaningful consent to sexual relations with an adult. Some critics {{also argued that}} using value-neutral terminology would normalize CSA and that redefining terminology {{is not in the}} interest of the general public because it confuses the underlying moral issues. Rind et al. replied that the <b>construct</b> <b>of</b> consent used in their study was misinterpreted by critics; they only asserted that children/adolescents are capable of simple consent (willingness) as opposed to informed consent used in legal contexts, and used this as a variable in their study simply because it was used in the original studies - where it had predictive validity. Thus, they conclude that although the <b>construct</b> <b>of</b> willingness might be morally unacceptable, it is a scientifically valid term. A similar argument was put forward by Oellerich, who stated that considering all adult/non-adult sexual behavior as abusive and lacking consent can lead to bias in scientific research in the area, and that recognizing this distinction does not necessarily lead to considering adult/non-adult sexual interactions as morally permissible.|$|E

25|$|The {{rise of the}} Finnish {{language}} to an increasingly prevalent position in society was, at the outset, mainly a <b>construct</b> <b>of</b> eager promoters of the Finnish language from the higher strata of society, mainly with Swedish-speaking family backgrounds. A later development, especially {{at the beginning of}} the 20th century, was the adoption or translation or modification of Swedish surnames into Finnish (fennicization). This was generally done throughout the entire society. In upper-class families it was predominantly in cadet branches of families that the name translations took place.|$|E
25|$|Some feminists contend that, as {{with other}} women saints such as Joan of Arc, the image of Mary is a <b>construct</b> <b>of</b> the patriarchal mind. They argue that Marian dogmas and doctrines and the typical forms of Marian devotion {{reinforce}} patriarchy by offering women temporary comfort from the ongoing oppression inflicted on them by male dominated churches and societies. In the feminist view, old gender stereotypes persist within traditional Marian teachings and theological doctrines. To that end books on feminist Mariology have been published to present opposing interpretations and perspectives.|$|E

25|$|Methodologically, social {{complexity}} is theory-neutral, {{meaning that}} it accommodates both local and global approaches to sociological research. The very idea of social complexity arises out of the historical-comparative methods of early sociologists; obviously, this method is important in developing, defining, and refining the theoretical <b>construct</b> <b>of</b> social complexity. As complex social systems have many parts {{and there are many}} possible relationships between those parts, appropriate methodologies are typically determined to some degree by the research level of analysis differentiated by the researcher according to the level of description or explanation demanded by the research hypotheses.|$|E
