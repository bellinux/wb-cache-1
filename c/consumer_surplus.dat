5|$|Gernot Klepper, in an {{analysis}} similar to Krugman and Baldwin, has also used the Brander Spencer and other models to analyze the effects of entry into the transport aircraft industry. He included the effects of learning during the production process which depends {{on the scale of}} production. His calibrated model suggested that per unit production costs can fall by as much as 20% if total production is doubled. In that case, the entry of another firm (in this case, Airbus) into the market would decrease per firm output and reduce the learning and scale effects. In his analysis, the entry of Airbus would cause an increase in <b>consumer</b> <b>surplus,</b> but this would be smaller than the resulting loss in producer surplus.|$|E
5|$|In {{his book}} which {{presented}} {{the model to}} the general public, Paul Krugman used {{the example of the}} aircraft industry, with the two players being Airbus and Boeing. In fact, Krugman and Baldwin examined the industry for wide bodied aircraft {{in the context of the}} model in a 1988 paper. The authors calibrate an extended version of the model in order to examine the effect of a subsidy to Airbus by European governments, and its presence in a market which can only support two firms at most, worldwide. They find that the subsidy had an unambiguously negative effect on welfare of the United States and a positive effect on rest of the world, which benefits from lower prices. The result for Europe hinges on price elasticity of demand; for relatively inelastic demand the net effect of subsidy is positive with most of the benefits accruing to European consumers, but for elastic demand, social welfare in Europe goes down. Importantly, unlike in the baseline Brander and Spencer model, Krugman and Baldwin find that the changes to <b>consumer</b> <b>surplus</b> resulting from the subsidy and entry, dominate the effect of changes in firm profits in social welfare calculations.|$|E

[...] Boston UniversityIn this {{dissertation}} I {{review the}} history {{and the development of}} the concept of the <b>consumer's</b> <b>surplus.</b> My purpose is to give focus to the role of this concept in equilibrium determination for consumer demand and production theory and thus to point up the welfare significance of certain consumer and producer decisions. My method is basically illustrative. I draw my principal conclusion [...] that <b>consumer's</b> <b>surplus</b> is an analytical tool of great utility and therefore merits its recent rehabilitation [...] from an examination of the meaning of consumer equilibrium. This I do by, first, defining surplus, and attempting a classification of it. Then I proceed to a consideration of the connection between major surplus concepts and of the unique role of the <b>consumer's</b> <b>surplus.</b> Having done this, I look into the development of consumer demand theory to see how <b>consumer's</b> <b>surplus</b> plays its role there. My next step is the outlining of the welfare systems of major economists as these systems involve a <b>consumer's</b> <b>surplus.</b> Lastly, after a consideration of two problems of ideal out put in production theory, I give attention to the criticisms of the <b>consumer's</b> <b>surplus</b> and summarize my conclusions regarding the use of the concept...|$|R

2500|$|In {{this paper}} Ramsey's {{contribution}} to economic theory was the elegant concept of Ramsey pricing. This is applicable {{in situations where}} a (regulated) monopolist wants to maximise <b>consumer</b> <b>surplus</b> whilst {{at the same time}} ensuring that its costs are adequately covered. This is achieved by setting the price such that the markup over marginal cost is inversely proportional to the price elasticity of demand for that good. Like its predecessor this paper was published in The Economic Journal in 1927. Ramsey poses the question that is to be solved {{at the beginning of the}} article: [...] "a given revenue is to be raised by proportionate taxes on some or all uses of income, the taxes on different uses being possibly at different rates; how much should these rates be adjusted in order that the decrement of utility may be a minimum?" [...] (Ramsey 1927). The problem was suggested to him by the economist Arthur Pigou and the paper was Ramsey's answer to the problem.|$|E

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} properties, good and bad, of social {{evaluations}} based on four money measures of well-being or changes in well-being: compensating variations, money metrics, extended money metrics, and welfare ratios. Consistency of social rankings (transitivity, asymmetry of preference), {{the possibility of}} incorporating inequality aver-sion, independence of the choice of reference prices, and the ethics implicit in the eval-uations are considered. In addition, these procedures are contrasted with utility aggre-gation using equivalence scales. Key words: <b>consumer's</b> <b>surplus,</b> money metrics, willingness to pay. Cost-benefit analysis and other applications of welfare economics employ money measures of well-being or changes in well-being and evaluate economic states of affairs with aggregates of these measures-usually simple sums. The most favored measure is the compensating variation or willingness to pay. It is an index of welfare change for a household or individual. The equivalent variation (another Hicksian <b>consumer's</b> <b>surplus)</b> "measures " welfare change as well.
