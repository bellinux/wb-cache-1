40|$|The mass {{separation}} of the radioactive isotopes of an element is often an essential preparation {{for a study of}} the radiations. When neighbouring isotopes have similar disintegration periods, the assignment of observed radiations to a particular isotope is otherwise difficult. Accurate yield curves, or <b>cross</b> <b>bombardment</b> with different particles, can make assignments more probable. Careful "milking off" of daughter activities by chemical means may also be very helpful...|$|E
40|$|The new isotope /sup 162 /Hf (T/sub 1 / 2 /=(37. 6 +or- 0. 8) s) is {{produced}} in a /sup 142 /Nd (/sup 24 /Mg, 4 n) reaction. The activities produced in this reaction are transported to a measuring station by use of a He- jet system. Decay properties are observed with alpha -, gamma -, and gamma - gamma -spectroscopy. The Z-assignment of the new isotope {{is based on a}} <b>cross</b> <b>bombardment</b> on /sup 141 /Pr target and on the results of a gamma -X-ray coincidence measurement. The mass assignment is deduced from the excitation function measurements. From the measured alpha -decay energy E/sub alpha /= 4308 (10) keV new mass values are derived for /sup 162 /Hf, /sup 166 /W, /sup 170 /Os, /sup 174 /Pt, and /sup 178 /Hg. These new mass values make it possible to establish systematics of two-proton and one-proton binding energies far from stability. (20 refs) ...|$|E
40|$|Delayed proton {{emission}} {{has been}} observed following bombardment of stable isotopes among the elements between nitrogen and silicon using both the external and internal proton beams of the McGill 100 Mev synchrocyclotron. The protons are emitted from virtual states excited by the beta decay of highly neutron deficient nuclides. Charged particle spectroscopy, <b>cross</b> <b>bombardment</b> and reaction Q values have allowed the identification of several new radioactive neutron deficient nuclides as the precursors of the proton emission. The delayed proton precursors (and their half-lives in msec where measured) are O¹³, Ne¹⁷ (103 ± 7), Mg²¹ (118 ± 4), and Si²⁵ (225 ± 6), all having A = 4 n + 1 and Tz = - 3 / 2. The lowest energy T = 3 / 2 state bas been located in the Tz = - 1 / 2 daughter nuclides Na²¹, and A 1 ²⁵. These states are excited by superallowed beta decay of the respective precursor and their de-excitation is by isotopic spin forbidden proton emission. [ [...] . ...|$|E

40|$|In a {{first attempt}} to confirm data on superheavy {{elements}} obtained in Dubna using hot fusion reactions [1] we studied the reaction 48 Ca + 238 U => 286 112 *. Although the cross-section of (2. 5 + 1. 8 − 1. 1) pb is not the highest one measured for hot fusion reactions at the Dubna gasfilled separator (DGFRS), the reaction with the relatively stable and easy to handle 238 U target was favored for technical reasons. Four events were measured in our SHIP experiment [2], which fully confirms the data measured at the DGFRS. Another independent confirmation of the Dubna data was obtained by chemical means {{in the case of}} decay chains starting at the isotope 287 114 [3]. On the basis of the positive results from both confirmation experiments and consistent results of the various reactions (including <b>cross</b> <b>bombardments)</b> and decay chains up to element 118 measured in Dubna [1], we planned and performed an experiment to search for element 120 using the reactio...|$|R
40|$|In 2004, the FLNR scientiˇc {{programme}} on heavy-ion physics included {{experiments on}} {{the synthesis of}} heavy and exotic nuclei using ion beams of stable and radioactive isotopes and studies of nuclear reactions, acceleration technology, and heavy-ion interaction with matter. These lines of investigations were represented in 15 laboratory and all-institute projects: • Synthesis of new nuclei and study of nuclear prop-erties and heavy-ion reaction mechanisms (9 projects); • Radiation effects and modiˇcation of materials, ra-dioanalytical and radioisotopic investigations using the FLNR accelerators (5 projects); • Development of the FLNR cyclotron complex for producing intense beams of accelerated ions of stable and radioactive isotopes (2 projects); • Development of the U 400 +U 400 M+MT 25 cyclotronÄmicrotron complex {{for the production of}} ra-dioactive ion beams (the DRIBs project). In 2004, the operation time of the FLNR U 400 and U 400 M cyclotrons was nearly 8000 hours, which is in accordance with the plan. Due to this, new experiments in low- and medium-energy ranges were possible. Synthesis of New Elements By employing the Dubna Gas-Filled Recoil Separa-tor, the dependence of the production cross sections of the isotopes 286 − 288114 on the excitation energy of the compound nucleus 290114 at four energies of 48 Ca projectiles was studied (see Fig. 1). The proper-ties of 286 − 288114 and their α-decay descendants coin-cide in full with those determined previously in <b>cross</b> <b>bombardment</b> reactions 244 Pu(48 Ca, 4 − 5 n) 287, 288114, 245 Cm(48 Ca, 2 − 3 n) 290, 291116 α → 286, 287114 and 249 Cf(48 Ca, 3 n) 294118 α → 290116 α → 286114 [1]. The evenÄodd isotope 287114 undergoes mostly se-quential α-α-SF decay with a typical total decay time of about 2 Ä 20 s. The SF nuclide 279110 undergoes α decay with a probability of about 10 % which ends with spontaneous ˇssion of 271 Sg and 267 Rf. Their long lifetimes are caused by the inuence of the deformed shells at Z = 108 and at N = 162...|$|E
50|$|On September 14 in the morning, the Germans {{tried to}} capture the city in a frontal attack, but were halted by machine gun fire and artillery. Main {{fighting}} {{took place in the}} south, where Germans, after artillery <b>bombardment,</b> <b>crossed</b> the San and attacked the village of Kruhel Maly, which now is a district of Przemyśl. After a Polish counterattack, in which bayonets were used, the situation there stabilized in the evening. In the north, German attacks also failed.|$|R
50|$|On September 17, 1944, Cook, now a major, {{jumped into}} the Netherlands near the Maas-Waal Canal. After {{assisting}} in securing the canal crossing, his unit marched to Nijmegen. Major General Gavin, commanding the 82nd Airborne, had ordered a crossing of the Waal River during daylight hours so the Americans could outflank the German defenders, who were dug in around the city’s crucial bridges. Cook {{was put in charge}} of the crossing, was in the first wave across the river. As Cook’s first wave began their <b>crossing,</b> the Allied <b>bombardment</b> began. The wind blew away the smokescreen, leaving the men in the water open and visible to the German guns. As a devout Catholic, Cook loudly recited Hail Mary during the crossing, spurring his men on under the withering fire. He took charge of the boats, redirecting those who were disoriented and pushing the men along. Once ashore, the 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment cleared the river bank, moved north and assaulted the railway bridge over the highway leading to the main road bridge in the village of Lent. Cook was subsequently awarded the Distinguished Service Cross.|$|R
