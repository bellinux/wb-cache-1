5|$|Analyses of extinct adapiforms postcranial skeletons {{suggest a}} variety of {{locomotor}} behavior. The European adapids Adapis, Palaeolemur, and Leptadapis shared adaptations for slow climbing like the lorises, although {{they may have been}} quadrupedal runners like small New World monkeys. Both Notharctus and Smilodectes from North America and Europolemur from Europe exhibit limb proportions and joint surfaces comparable to vertical <b>clinging</b> and leaping lemurs, but were not as specialized as indriids for vertical <b>clinging,</b> suggesting that they ran along branches and did not leap as much. Notharctids Cantius and Pronycticebus appear to have been agile arboreal quadrupeds, with adaptations comparable to the brown lemurs.|$|E
5|$|Ruffed lemurs are {{considered}} arboreal quadrupeds, {{with the most}} common type of movement being above-branch quadrupedalism. While in the canopy leaping, vertical <b>clinging,</b> and suspensory behavior, are also common, while bridging, bimanual movement, and bipedalism are infrequently seen. When moving from tree to tree, ruffed lemurs will look over the shoulder while <b>clinging,</b> launch themselves into the air, and twist mid-air so that their ventral surface lands on the new tree or limb. Suspensory behavior is more common in ruffed lemurs than in other lemur species. When ruffed lemurs come down to the ground, they continue to move quadrupedally, running with bounding hops and the tail held high.|$|E
5|$|Living strepsirrhines are {{predominantly}} arboreal, {{with only the}} ring-tailed lemur spending considerable time on the ground. Most species move around quadrupedally (on four legs) in the trees, including five genera of smaller, nocturnal lemurs. Galagos, indriids, sportive lemurs, and bamboo lemurs leap from vertical surfaces, and the indriids are highly specialized for vertical <b>clinging</b> and leaping. Lorises are slow-moving, deliberate climbers.|$|E

It enables exploratory programming with rapid edit / run cycles. The ROOT team has more than 15 years of experience with C++ interpreters, {{and this has been}} fully exploited in the design of <b>cling.</b> However, matching the concepts of an interpreter to a compiler library is a non-trivial task; we will explain how this is done for <b>cling,</b> and how we managed to implement <b>cling</b> as a small (10, 000 lines of code) extension to the clang and llvm libraries. The resulting features clearly show the advantages of basing an interpreter on a compiler. Cling uses clang's praised concise and easy to understand diagnostics. Building an interpreter {{on top of}} a compiler library makes the transition between interpreted and compiled code much easier and smoother. We will present the design, e. g. how <b>cling</b> treats the C++ extensions that used to be available in CINT. We will also present the new features, e. g. how C++ 11 will come to <b>cling,</b> and how dictionaries will be simplified due to <b>cling.</b> We describe the state of <b>cling's</b> integration in the ROOT Framework...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effectiveness of}} mirror <b>cling</b> reminder cues in increasing tooth brushing for preschool children enrolled in local Head Start programs. Although a lot of social marketing programs use stickers and mirror <b>clings</b> as reminder cues, {{there is very little}} research that tests their effectiveness over the long term. This study consisted of a 6 -week program where parents were sent a mirror <b>cling</b> of Roger the Red Robot, and asked to place it on their bathroom mirror where their child brushes their teeth. Through responsive text messages periodically over a 6 -week period, parents were asked to report the number of times they brushed their child’s teeth, and whether they or their child suggested the tooth brushing. They also responded to a follow up question three months later asking whether their mirror <b>cling</b> was still up, and how often they were currently brushing their child’s teeth. Although results indicate that parents liked the mirror <b>cling,</b> {{there is no evidence that}} it increased the frequency of tooth brushing for the duration of the study. When it came to the perception of the mirror <b>cling,</b> however, parents reported that they felt the mirror <b>cling</b> helped to remind both themselves and their child to brush twice a day.

40|$|High {{retention}} {{forces are}} the basic requirements on stretch films for agricultural or pallet wrapping of goods and significantly influenced by <b>cling</b> properties (autohesion) that are essential for a reliable load stability during transportation and storage. Low molecular weight polyisobutylene (PIB) has tacky properties and is immiscible with polyethylene. Blended with ethylene/-olefin copolymers in coextruded stretch films, PIB can migrate to the film surfaces and cause <b>cling</b> properties. Cling and adhesion forces were investigated using the mechanical <b>cling</b> test, atomic force, and scanning electron microscopy and infrared spectroscopy. The molecular weight of the PIB as well as density and crystallinity of the matrix material have strong influences on migration kinetics and therefore, on the <b>cling</b> forces. Cling forces increase with increasing aging time, having a maximum after 2 weeks of production. The following slight decrease of the <b>cling</b> force might be correlated with a beginning degradation process of the UV sensitive PIB. Polyisobutylene with higher molecular weight diffuses slower through a {{linear low density polyethylene}} (LLDPE) matrix than lower molecular weight PIB, but can cause higher <b>cling</b> forces on the film surfaces...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} {{the validity of}} covering a corneal contact transducer probe with <b>cling</b> film as protection against the transmission of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). Methods: The anterior chamber depth, lens thickness and vitreous chamber depth of the right eyes of 10 subjects was recorded, under cycloplegia, with and without <b>cling</b> film covering over the transducer probe of a Storz Omega Compu-scan Biometric Ruler. Measurements were repeated on two occasions. Results: Cling film covering did not influence bias or repeatability. Although the 95 % limits of agreement between measurements made with and without <b>cling</b> film covering tended to exceed the intrasessional repeatability, they did not exceed the intersessional repeatability of measurements taken without <b>cling</b> film. Conclusions: The results {{support the use of}} <b>cling</b> film as a disposable covering for corneal contact A-scan ultrasonography to avoid the risk of spreading CJD from one subject to another. © 2003 The College of Optometrists...|$|R

5|$|As an adult, {{the house}} sparrow mostly feeds on {{the seeds of}} grains and weeds, but it is {{opportunistic}} and adaptable, and eats whatever foods are available. In towns and cities, it often scavenges for food in garbage containers and congregates in the outdoors of restaurants and other eating establishments to feed on leftover food and crumbs. It can perform complex tasks to obtain food, such as opening automatic doors to enter supermarkets, <b>clinging</b> to hotel walls to watch vacationers on their balconies, and nectar robbing kowhai flowers. In common with many other birds, the house sparrow requires grit to digest the harder items in its diet. Grit can be either stone, often grains of masonry, or the shells of eggs or snails; oblong and rough grains are preferred.|$|E

5|$|Ideally, {{these social}} skills become {{incorporated}} into the internal working model {{to be used with}} other children and later with adult peers. As children move into the school years at about six years old, most develop a goal-corrected partnership with parents, in which each partner is willing to compromise in order to maintain a gratifying relationship. By middle childhood, the goal of the attachment behavioural system has changed from proximity to the attachment figure to availability. Generally, a child is content with longer separations, provided contact—or the possibility of physically reuniting, if needed—is available. Attachment behaviours such as <b>clinging</b> and following decline and self-reliance increases. By middle childhood (ages 7–11), there may be a shift toward mutual coregulation of secure-base contact in which caregiver and child negotiate methods of maintaining communication and supervision as the child moves toward a greater degree of independence.|$|E

5|$|Locomotor {{behavior}} in lemurs, both living and extinct, is highly varied and its diversity exceeds that of anthropoids. Locomotor postures and behaviors have included vertical <b>clinging</b> and leaping (including saltatory behavior), seen in indriids and bamboo lemurs; slow (loris-like) arboreal quadrupedal locomotion, once exhibited by Mesopropithecus; fast arboreal quadrupedal locomotion, seen in true lemurs and ruffed lemurs; partially terrestrial quadrupedal locomotion, {{seen in the}} ring-tailed lemur; highly terrestrial quadrupedal locomotion, once exhibited by monkey lemurs such as Hadropithecus; and sloth-like suspensory locomotion, once exhibited {{by many of the}} sloth lemurs, such as Palaeopropithecus. The Lac Alaotra gentle lemur (Hapalemur alaotrensis) has even been reported to be a good swimmer. Sometimes these locomotor types are lumped together into two main groups of lemurs, the vertical clingers and leapers and the arboreal (and occasionally terrestrial) quadrupeds.|$|E
