5|$|I-87 takes a northerly track from US11, {{crossing}} the Great Chazy River and briefly entering the village limits, where it runs past {{a series of}} homes and businesses built up along nearby US9. As both roads head north out of the village, US9 connects to the Northway one last time at exit43, the last interchange on I-87 before the <b>Canadian</b> <b>border.</b> Past the exit, the highway doubles in width, becoming eight lanes wide as it begins to run past the customs facilities on the American side of the border. The Northway and I-87 end shortly thereafter at the <b>Canadian</b> <b>border,</b> where the highway continues past the Champlain-St. Bernard de Lacolle Border Crossing into Quebec as A-15.|$|E
5|$|Although most of NY37 in {{the town}} of Bombay is {{contained}} within the reservation, a short portion east of Hogansburg and the St. Regis River and west of Tarbell Road is located outside the reservation limits. Within this stretch, NY37 meets both the eastern end of NY37C and the northern terminus of NY95. East of the reservation, NY37 roughly parallels the CSX Transportation-owned Montreal Subdivision northeast to Fort Covington, where NY37 crosses the railroad line and intersects Water Street (unsigned NY970T), a connector to Quebec Route132 on the northern side of the <b>Canadian</b> <b>border.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the {{original}} plan for the U.S. Highway System, as approved by the Bureau of Public Roads in November 1926, US7 was defined as beginning in New York City and designated on the alignment of NY22 to Amenia, where it shifted northeast into Sharon, Connecticut to use old New England Route4 through Massachusetts and Vermont {{all the way to}} the <b>Canadian</b> <b>border.</b> Apparently New York State did not approve this plan, and by mid-1927 the official route log published by AASHO (now known as AASHTO) had been amended so that the southern end of US7 began in Norwalk, Connecticut instead.|$|E

5|$|The {{first set}} of posted routes in New York were {{assigned}} in 1924. Two of the routes assigned at this time were NY6, a north–south route extending from the New York City line to the <b>Canadian</b> <b>border,</b> and NY30, another north–south route connecting NY6 in Mechanicville to the Vermont state line west of Fair Haven. NY6 left Albany on modern NY32 and followed it to Mechanicville, where NY6 veered westward on what is now NY67 and NY30 picked up the current alignment of NY32. NY30 continued north on modern NY32 to Glens Falls, at which point it went east to Hudson Falls via Warren and River streets. It headed northward from there to Vermont on modern US4. From Mechanicville to Schuylerville, NY30 utilized the alignment of legislative Route44. By 1926, NY30 was rerouted north of Whitehall to continue north toward the <b>Canadian</b> <b>border.</b> The old alignment of NY30 between Whitehall and Vermont was not assigned a new number. Meanwhile, an alternate route of NY6 {{on the east side}} of the Hudson River between NY5 (now US20) in East Greenbush and NY6 in Waterford was designated as NY6B by 1926.|$|E
5|$|The highway through Keene Valley from Underwood to Keene {{was built}} by 1846. At its {{southern}} end, it connected to a major stagecoach road that connected Albany to the <b>Canadian</b> <b>border.</b> The route fostered the rise of local lumber and tanning industries; up to 40 wagon loads of timber used the stagecoach route daily. Various hotels and taverns opened {{in the nearby town}} of North Hudson to serve travelers along the route.|$|E
5|$|Historically, Arlington {{developed}} along several railroads {{that have}} since been abandoned or re-purposed. The Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway, which spurred the establishment of Arlington in the 1880s, ran north–south through Arlington on its main line between Snohomish and the <b>Canadian</b> <b>border.</b> In 1892, it was acquired by the Northern Pacific Railway, which was acquired by Burlington Northern in 1970. Burlington Northern abandoned the railroad in 1972, favoring a parallel route to the west through Marysville, and it was converted into the Centennial Trail in the 1990s and 2000s. A Northern Pacific branch to Darrington, following the modern-day State Route 530, was built in 1901 and abandoned in 1990; the county government {{plans to use the}} right of way for the Whitehorse Trail, a multi-purpose trail.|$|E

5|$|Interstate 69 (I-69) {{is a part}} of the Interstate Highway System {{that will}} {{eventually}} run from the Mexican border in Texas to the <b>Canadian</b> <b>border</b> at Port Huron, Michigan. In Michigan, it is a state trunkline highway that enters the state south of Coldwater and passes the cities of Lansing and Flint in the Lower Peninsula. A north–south freeway from the Indiana–Michigan border to the Lansing area, it changes direction to east–west after running concurrently with I-96. The freeway continues to Port Huron before terminating in the middle of the twin-span Blue Water Bridge while running concurrently with I-94 at the border. There are four related business loops for I-69 in the state, connecting the freeway to adjacent cities.|$|E
5|$|The first {{change to}} the routing of NY10 came by 1926 when NY10 was {{extended}} northeastward over modern NY3 to Plattsburgh, where it terminated at NY30 (now NY22). The route was truncated one year later when US9W {{was assigned to the}} portion of NY10 between New Jersey and Albany. NY10 was subsequently truncated to the former western terminus of its overlap with NY5 in Schenectady. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, NY10 was significantly reconfigured to begin in Deposit and end at the <b>Canadian</b> <b>border</b> north of Malone. The only segment of NY10 not altered by the realignment, which utilized a combination of previously numbered routes and unsigned roadways, was the piece between Long Lake and Lake Clear Junction.|$|E
5|$|The modern routing of NY186 was {{originally}} designated {{as part of}} NY10 when {{the first set of}} posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924. In the 1930 renumbering, NY10 was rerouted east of Lake Clear to follow modern NY30 north to the <b>Canadian</b> <b>border.</b> The former routing of NY10 between Lake Clear and Harrietstown was incorporated into NY86, a new route extending from Lake Clear to Jay. NY86 remained on this alignment until March28, 1989, when the NY192 designation was deleted. NY86 was then rerouted to follow the former routing of NY192 northwestward to Paul Smiths. The Lake Clear–Harrietstown roadway, vacated by NY86, was redesignated as NY186.|$|E

5|$|The {{segment of}} NY22 north of US11, named Hemmingford Road, was state-maintained until September1, 1988, when {{ownership}} {{and maintenance of}} {{that part of the}} route was transferred to Clinton County as part of a highway maintenance swap between the county and the state of New York. Following the swap, it was co-designated as CR34 by Clinton County. In 2008, the signed northern terminus of NY22 was moved to the east end of its overlap with US11 in Mooers. The official alignment of NY22 was not changed, however, as the New York State Department of Transportation still considered the <b>Canadian</b> <b>border</b> to be NY22's northern terminus until ca. July 2014.|$|E
5|$|In 1924, Warren Street in Glens Falls and River Street in Hudson Falls {{became part}} of NY30, a highway that {{initially}} extended from Mechanicville to the Vermont state line near Fair Haven by way of Glens Falls and Whitehall.

The highway serves Benton Harbor–St. Joseph near Lake Michigan before turning inland toward Kalamazoo and Battle Creek on the west side of the peninsula. Heading farther east, I-94 passes through rural areas in the middle of the southern Lower Peninsula, crossing I-69 in the process. I-94 then runs through Jackson, Ann Arbor, and portions of Metro Detroit, connecting Michigan's largest city to its main airport. Past the east side of Detroit, the Interstate angles northeasterly through farmlands in The Thumb to Port Huron, where the designation terminates on the Blue Water Bridge at the <b>Canadian</b> <b>border.</b>|$|E

25|$|When {{the first}} set of posted routes in New York were {{assigned}} in 1924, the north half of legislative Route22—from modern NY8 near Riparius north to the <b>Canadian</b> <b>border</b> at Rouses Point—became part of NY6. In 1927, U.S. Highways were first signed in New York, at which time NY6 was mostly absorbed into the new US9, including within the town of Champlain. US9 was realigned in the mid-1940s to bypass Rouses Point to the west and proceed north through the village of Champlain on its way to Canada. Its former alignment to Rouses Point was redesignated as NY9B, which initially continued north along Lake Street to the <b>Canadian</b> <b>border</b> by way of an overlap with US11.
