40|$|Abstract: Getting {{adequate}} {{sleep is}} a healthy lifestyle activity that {{is important for the}} body to function optimally both physically and mentally. Unfortunately, 70 million Americans suffer from chronic sleep loss or sleep disorders. Secondary causes of sleep disorders are often overlooked and can occur from the consumption of social or medicinal drugs. Common social drugs that <b>can</b> disrupt <b>sleep</b> include alcohol, caffeine, and nicotine. Certain medications can also have side-effects that <b>can</b> induce <b>sleep</b> disruptions. This article briefly reviews common social drugs and prescription medications that <b>can</b> negatively impact <b>sleep...</b>|$|R

5|$|Shiryou Sensen: War of the Dead, a 1987 title {{developed}} by Fun Factory {{and published by}} Victor Music Industries for the MSX2, PC-88 and PC Engine platforms, is considered the first true survival horror game by Kevin Gifford (of GamePro and 1UP) and John Szczepaniak (of Retro Gamer and The Escapist). Designed by Katsuya Iwamoto, the game was a horror action RPG revolving around a female SWAT member Lila rescuing survivors in an isolated monster-infested town and bringing them to safety in a church. It has open environments like Dragon Quest and real-time side-view battles like Zelda II, though War of the Dead departed from other RPGs with its dark and creepy atmosphere expressed through the storytelling, graphics, and music. The player character has limited ammunition, though the player character can punch or use a knife if out of ammunition. The game also has a limited item inventory and crates to store items, and introduced a day-night cycle; the player <b>can</b> <b>sleep</b> to recover health, and a record is kept of how many days the player has survived. That same year saw the release of Laplace no Ma, another hybrid of survival horror and RPG, though with more traditional RPG elements such as turn-based combat. It is mostly set in a mansion infested with undead creatures, and the player controls a party of characters with different professions, including a scientist who constructs tools and a journalist who takes pictures. In 1988, War of the Dead Part 2 for the MSX2 and PC-88 abandoned the RPG elements of its predecessor, such as random encounters, and instead adopted action-adventure elements from Metal Gear while retaining the horror atmosphere of its predecessor.|$|E

40|$|How does {{depression}} affect <b>sleep?</b> Depressed mood <b>can</b> significantly impact <b>sleep.</b> Some {{people find}} it difficult to fall asleep or stay asleep. Others find that they wake up much earlier than usual and have trouble falling asleep. Some people find that they are sleeping much more than usual. Depression <b>can</b> also make <b>sleep</b> less restorative (or restful), so you wake up feeling fatigued. How can a lack of sleep affect physical health? Fatigue due to inadequate <b>sleep</b> <b>can</b> worsen mood symptoms. It can be much more difficult to motivate yourself to engage in necessary self-care when you are feeling exhausted. It has been shown that improved <b>sleep</b> <b>can</b> help our bodies recover from physical health conditions. What causes poor sleep? There is a two-way relationship: stress and low mood often disrupt sleep, and <b>sleep</b> disruption <b>can</b> lead to further stress and fatigue. Some medications for mood <b>can</b> impact <b>sleep,</b> making sleep less restorative or restful. Some people can become dependent on over-the-counter medications for <b>sleep.</b> Health conditions <b>can</b> also affect <b>sleep</b> due to underlying symptoms (such as pain), the treatments that are used to treat those conditions (such as medications), and worry about the health condition. What is the economic burden associated with poor sleep? Poor sleep is associated with the increased use of health care services and products. Poor sleep and insomnia are associated with absenteeism and productivity loss a...|$|R

25|$|Animals that {{hibernate}} {{are in a}} {{state of}} torpor, differing from sleep. Hibernation markedly reduces the need for sleep, but does not remove it. Some hibernating animals end their hibernation a couple of times during the winter so that they <b>can</b> <b>sleep.</b> Hibernating animals waking up from hibernation often go into rebound sleep because of lack of sleep during the hibernation period. They are definitely well-rested and are conserving energy during hibernation, but need sleep for something else.|$|E

25|$|The neurobiological {{background}} for unihemispheric sleep is still unclear. In experiments on cats {{in which the}} connection between {{the left and the right}} halves of the brain stem has been severed, the brain hemispheres show periods of a desynchronized EEG, during which the two hemispheres <b>can</b> <b>sleep</b> independently of each other. In these cats, the state where one hemisphere slept NREM and the other was awake, as well as one hemisphere sleeping NREM with the other state sleeping REM were observed. Interestingly, the cats were never seen to sleep REM sleep with one hemisphere while the other hemisphere was awake. This is in accordance with the fact that REM sleep, as far as is currently known, does not occur unihemispherically.|$|E
25|$|The {{correlates}} of sleep found for mammals are valid for birds as well i.e. bird sleep {{is very similar}} to mammals and involves both SWS and REM sleep with similar features, including closure of both eyes, lowered muscle tone, etc. However, the proportion of REM sleep in birds is much lower. Also, some birds <b>can</b> <b>sleep</b> with one eye open if there is high predation risk in the environment. This gives rise to the possibility of sleep in flight; considering that sleep is very important and some bird species can fly for weeks continuously, this seems to be the obvious result. However, sleep in flight has not been recorded, and is so far unsupported by EEG data. Further research may explain whether birds sleep during flight or if there are other mechanisms which ensure their remaining healthy during long flights in the absence of sleep.|$|E
