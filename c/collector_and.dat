He acquired the works of some of Australia's most highly regarded artists, such as Russell Drysdale, Albert Tucker and John Brack.

This situation was compounded when the proceeds from the second edition of his book, published in 1859, were less than anticipated because of competition from Grindon's Manchester Flora published in the same year.|$|E

At that time Isabeau intervened between Orléans and Burgundy, preventing bloodshed and the outbreak of civil war.|$|E

5|$|The {{tower was}} built for William Thomas Beckford, a rich novelist, art <b>collector</b> <b>and</b> critic, to designs by Henry Goodridge and {{completed}} in 1827. Beckford {{used it as a}} library and a retreat, with the cupola at the top acting as a belvedere providing views over the surrounding countryside. The Italianate building {{at the base of the}} tower housed drawing rooms and a library. Extensive grounds between Beckford's house in Lansdown Crescent were landscaped and planted to create Beckford's Ride.|$|E

In 2008 announced his intention to bequeath the house as a museum, but discussions with Kensington and Chelsea council stalled after {{they were unable to}} meet the £15 million cost of purchasing the freehold of the property, which expires in 2046. The freehold is owned by the Ilchester Estate.|$|E
5|$|A {{native of}} Pitești, Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești {{was the son}} of a {{landowner}} from Olt, and, on his father's side, the descendant of immigrants from the Epirote area of Ioannina, whose ethnicity was either Aromanian or Albanian. His father became a local leader of the Conservative Party. His mother was a boyaress, and, as art <b>collector</b> <b>and</b> memoirist Krikor Zambaccian recounted, may have been a descendant of the Balotescu boyar clan. Bogdan-Pitești also had a sister, Elena Constanța Bogdan; both she and her mother reportedly survived his death. As one of his eccentricities, Bogdan-Pitești encouraged the—unsustainable—rumor that he was a direct descendant of an ancient Wallachian ruling house, the Basarab Princes.|$|E
