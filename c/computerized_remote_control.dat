This project is {{known as one of}} the robot {{platform}} that can be more develop into advance autonomous robot. The main feature of this project is it can be controlled wireless by using Android device. Android device nowadays have built in Bluetooth technology and one of the main our daily needs. This Bluetooth technology has been one of the most platforms in smartphone that was use in android system to develop an application to control all kind s of peripheral device like servo, DC gear motor, and others. RoboRemo software {{is the one}} of the software that can be use in developing Android app. The main objective of this project is to control the RC car and robot arm by using Android device through the Bluetooth communication. RoboRemo software will be installed on the Android device to create an application that can control the RC car and robot arm through Bluetooth. The implementation of the Android device for controlling RC car will solve a frequency problem that occurs while using RF transmitter. As the implantation of the Android device as controller of RC car can be apply by developing application using RoboRemo software...|$|E
40|$|A <b>computerized</b> <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> for a Siemens ZXT {{treatment}} couch {{was implemented}} and its characteristics were investigated to establish its feasibility for on-line setup corrections, using portal imaging. Communication with {{the table was}} obtained by connecting it via a serial line to a work station. The treatment couch enables "goto" commands in the three main directions and around the isocenter. The accuracy of the movements after giving such a command was checked and the time for each movement was recorded. First, the movements into a single direction were studied (range of - 4 to + 4 cm and - 4 degrees to + 4 degrees). Each command was repeated four times. Second, the table was moved into the three main directions simultaneously. For this experiment a clinically relevant three-dimensional (3 -D) normal distribution of shifts was used [N = 200, standard deviation (SD) 5 mm in the three main directions]. This latter experiment was done twice: without and with rotations (a distribution with SD 1 degrees). During the first experiment, with shifts into one direction, no systematic deviations were found. The overall accuracy of the shifts was 0. 6 mm (1 SD) in each direction and 0. 04 degrees (1 SD) for the rotations. The time required for a translation ranged between 4 and 13 s and for the rotation between 8 and 20 s. The second experiment with the 3 -D distribution of setup errors yielded an error in the 3 -D vector length equal to 0. 96 mm (1 SD), independent of rotations. Shifts were performed in less than 11 s for 95 % of the cases without rotations. When rotations were also performed, 95 % of the movements finished in less than 16 s. In conclusion, the table movements are accurate and enable on-line setup corrections in daily clinical practic...|$|E

25|$|Radio <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> (RF <b>remote</b> <b>control)</b> is used {{to control}} distant objects {{using a variety of}} radio signals {{transmitted}} by the <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> device. As a complementary method to infrared <b>remote</b> <b>controls,</b> the radio <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> is used with electric garage door or gate openers, automatic barrier systems, burglar alarms and industrial automation systems. Standards used for RF remotes are: Bluetooth AVRCP, ZigBee (RF4CE), Z-Wave. Most <b>remote</b> <b>controls</b> use their own coding, transmitting from 8 to 100 or more pulses, fixed or Rolling code, using OOK or FSK modulation. Also, transmitters or receivers can be universal, meaning they are able to work with many different codings. In this case, the transmitter is normally called a universal <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> duplicator because it is able to copy existing <b>remote</b> <b>controls,</b> while the receiver is called a universal receiver because it works with almost any <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> in the market.|$|R
