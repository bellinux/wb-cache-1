40|$|The {{traditional}} {{choices of}} asset allocation include: stocks, bonds, liquidity and also real estate. In {{the last five}} years, in consequence {{of the effects of}} the speculative bubble and of the new growth of interest rate, the attention of the managers of the portfolio is focalised on alternative assets, like hedge funds, private equity, credit derivatives, <b>commodities,</b> to <b>research</b> extra return. The commodities, traded on spot and forward markets, are characterised by the presence of negative correlation with traditional asset classes; therefore they help to obtain the search of the "alpha", which expresses the non systematic risk. The commodities have reached a meaningful performance in the last two years, especially the most important commodities index: Reuters/Jeffries-CRB (<b>Commodities</b> <b>Research</b> <b>Bureau)</b> <b>Index</b> and Standard & Poor's Commodity Index (S&P GSCI) have reached returns on over 15 %. In this paper we will examine the relationship between the portfolio returns with the presence of commodities or with traditional asset classes (stocks, bonds and liquidity) ...|$|R

2500|$|A {{commodity}} {{index fund}} is a fund whose assets are invested in financial instruments based on or {{linked to a}} commodity index. In just about every case the index {{is in fact a}} Commodity Futures Index. The first such <b>index</b> was the <b>Commodity</b> <b>Research</b> <b>Bureau</b> (CRB) <b>Index,</b> which began in 1958. Its construction made it unuseful as an investment index. The first practically investable commodity futures index was the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index, created in 1991, and known as the [...] "GSCI". The next was the Dow Jones AIG Commodity Index. It differed from the GSCI primarily in the weights allocated to each commodity. The DJ AIG had mechanisms to periodically limit the weight of any one commodity and to remove commodities whose weights became too small. After AIG's financial problems in 2008 the Index rights were sold to UBS and it is now known as the DJUBS index. Other commodity indices include the Reuters / CRB index (which is the old CRB Index as re-structured in 2005) and the Rogers Index.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Problem statement: Forecasting is a {{function}} in management to assist decision making. It is also described as the process of estimation in unknown future situations. In a more general term it {{is commonly known as}} prediction which refers to estimation of time series or longitudinal type data. Gold is a precious yellow commodity once used as money. It was made illegal in USA 41 years ago, but is now once again accepted as a potential currency. The demand for this commodity is on the rise. Approach: Objective {{of this study was to}} develop a forecasting model for predicting gold prices based on economic factors such as inflation, currency price movements and others. Following the melt-down of US dollars, investors are putting their money into gold because gold plays an important role as a stabilizing influence for investment portfolios. Due to the increase in demand for gold in Malaysian and other parts of the world, it is necessary to develop a model that reflects the structure and pattern of gold market and forecast movement of gold price. The most appropriate approach to the understanding of gold prices is the Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) model. MLR is a study on the relationship between a single dependent variable and one or more independent variables, as this case with gold price as the single dependent variable. The fitted model of MLR will be used to predict the future gold prices. A naive model known as “forecast- 1 ” was considered to be a benchmark model in order to evaluate the performance of the model. Results: Many factors determine the price of gold and based on “a hunch of experts”, several economic factors had been identified to have influence on the gold prices.

The second model considered the following four independent variables the (CRB lagged one), (EUROUSD lagged one), (INF lagged two) and (M 1 lagged two) to be significant. In terms of prediction, the second model achieved high level of predictive accuracy. The amount of variance explained was about 70 % and the regression coefficients also provide a means of assessing the relative importance of individual variables in the overall prediction of gold price...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} we compare the time series {{correlation}} modeling techniques, and document the effectiveness of various correlation forecasting models for different asset types, using a broad database from <b>Commodity</b> <b>Research</b> <b>Bureau</b> (CRB) and Bloomberg. First, we examine time varying correlations computed from different moving windows (rolling window moving average- RWMA) and pairs of assets. We document distinct patterns {{in the behavior of}} the RWMA estimates across window lengths for different pairs of assets. As the window length increases, average daily correlation between most stock indices and short- (long-) term bond yields increases from positive but negligible to substantially positive (is negative and flat), whereas the correlation between short and long term interest rates decreases, and the correlation amongst various equity and various commodity or precious metals indices exhibits different non-monotonic patterns. Then we build time series models to forecast correlation at different holding periods, the Engle (2002) dynamic conditional correlation (DCC) model, and compare the properties of these to the RWMA estimates.

40|$|We {{construct}} an equally-weighted index of commodity futures monthly returns {{over the period}} between July of 1959 and December of 2004 in order to study simple properties of commodity futures as an asset class. Fully-collateralized commodity futures have historically offered the same return and Sharpe ratio as equities. While the risk premium on commodity futures {{is essentially the same}} as equities, commodity futures returns are negatively correlated with equity returns and bond returns. The negative correlation between commodity futures and the other asset classes is due, in significant part, to different behavior over the business cycle. In addition, commodity futures are positively correlated with inflation, unexpected inflation, and changes in expected inflation. * We thank Dimitry Gupalo and Missaka Warusawitharana for research assistance, and AIG Financial Products and the Q-Group for financial support.
