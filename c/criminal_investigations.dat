5|$|Because the Bill of Rights did not {{initially}} {{apply to the}} states, and federal <b>criminal</b> <b>investigations</b> were less common {{in the first century}} of the nation's history, there is little significant case law for the Fourth Amendment before the 20th century.

5|$|While the Self-Incrimination Clause {{primarily}} implicates {{the law of}} <b>criminal</b> <b>investigations,</b> the Clause also {{protects against}} self-incrimination that may occur at trial. Plainly, the Clause prevents the government from compelling the defendant to testify against himself or herself at trial. Further, if the defendant chooses to testify, the Clause prevents the state from requiring her to testify first. But, if the defendant testifies, she cannot claim the privilege against self-incrimination with respect to cross-examination {{within the scope of}} the direct examination.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the Court's decision in Schmerber, many legal scholars feared the ruling {{would be used to}} limit civil liberties. Other scholars, including Nita A. Farahany, Benjamin Holley, and John G. New, have suggested courts may use the ruling in Schmerber to justify the use of mind reading devices against criminal suspects. Because the Court's ruling in Schmerber prohibited the use of warrantless blood tests in most circumstances, some commentators argue that the decision was responsible for the proliferation of breathalyzers to test for alcohol and urine analyses to test for controlled substances in <b>criminal</b> <b>investigations.</b>|$|E

5|$|In May 2005, {{opposition}} MP Gurmant Grewal accused Dosanjh and the Prime Minister's Chief of Staff, Tim Murphy, {{of attempting}} to bribe him with an ambassadorship and a senate seat for his wife, Nina Grewal, if he would cross the floor or abstain from a crucial upcoming vote. Grewal released tapes he secretly recorded of the conversation between Dosanjh, Grewal, and Murphy. Dosanjh claimed innocence and accused Grewal of altering the tapes to imply wrongdoing and the Prime Minister dismissed calls to remove Dosanjh from cabinet. Audio analysis concluded that the tapes were altered and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police did not pursue any <b>criminal</b> <b>investigations.</b> Nevertheless, fellow MP John Reynolds {{filed a complaint with}} the Law Society of British Columbia accusing Dosanjh of violating the Criminal Code and the society's Professional Conduct Handbook. The Law Society reviewed the affair and concluded that Grewal had attempted to elicit rewards for his compliance but cleared Dosanjh and Murphy of misconduct charges.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of Powell v. Alabama in 1932, the United States Supreme Court held that the court must provide counsel to {{defendants}} in capital trials, that is trials where capital punishment was a possible sentence, if the defendants were too poor to afford their own counsel. In Johnson v. Zerbst (1938), the Supreme Court expanded this principle to cover all federal trials, and in Gideon v. Wainwright (1963) the Court held that under the Fourteenth Amendment, the principle also applied to State courts. More recently, the Supreme Court has recognised the right of people to have counsel at other stages of <b>criminal</b> <b>investigations.</b> For example, the court has affirmed the right of indigent defendants to have counsel provided for them in interrogation {{after they have been}} arrested (Miranda v. Arizona), and for line-ups (United States v. Wade).|$|E
