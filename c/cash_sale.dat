NBC traded ownership of KCNC-TV in Denver, Colorado, KUTV in Salt Lake City, Utah and the VHF channel 4 allocation in Miami to Group W to solve the problem, with the two O swaps and the Miami channel swap taking place on September 10 of that year. Westinghouse merged with CBS in August 1995, resulting in these stations becoming owned-and-operated by CBS, with Group W becoming CBS Corporation by early 1997 (KUTV would later be sold to Four Points Media Group in 2008).|$|E

Under weak conditions the participation contract will induce more investment than the giveaway scheme, and it may even share the cash sales' virtue of incentive compatibility.

The possibility of holding consumers liable for indirect tax evasion is also investigated. This reveals the importance of levying new fines on consumers. Simply transferring to them a share of the penalty liability currently borne by the firm is more likely to increase evasion. Copyright 1990 by Royal Economic Society. ...|$|R
