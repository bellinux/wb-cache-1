40|$|The {{treatment}} of advective fluxes in high-order finite volume models is well established, {{but this is}} not the case for diffusive fluxes, due to the conflict between the discontinuous representation of the solution and the continuous structure of analytic solutions. In this paper, a derivative reconstruction approach is proposed in the context of spectral volume methods, for the approximation of diffusive fluxes, aiming at the reconciliation of this conflict. Two different reconstructions are used for advective and diffusive fluxes: the advective reconstruction makes use of the information contained in a spectral cell, and allows the formation of discontinuities at the spectral cells boundaries; the diffusive reconstruction makes use of the information contained in contiguous spectral cells, imposing the continuity of the reconstruction at the spectral cells boundaries. The method is demonstrated by a number of numerical experiments, including the solution of shallow-water equations, complemented with the advective-diffusive transport equation of a <b>conservative</b> <b>substance,</b> showing the promising abilities of the numerical scheme proposed...|$|E
40|$|In {{ecosystems}} network, structure determines adjacent (direct) and non-adjacent (indirect) pathways {{over which}} energy, mat-ter, and information can flow. The more pathways, the more possible ways the <b>conservative</b> <b>substance</b> can move in zero-sum transactions between network nodes that the pathways interconnect, {{and the more}} possible non-conservative, nonzero-sum relations can be secondarily derived from these. Structural analysis is a tool we employ, {{from a family of}} input–output methods for exploring zero- and nonzero-sum attributes of environmental networks, to count pathways of varying length between network nodes. In this paper, we examine the relationship between pathway length (k) and number (Pk) as deter-mined by system size (n, number of nodes) and extent and pattern of connectance (C). We develop a measure (ma) of path-way growth in numbers with increasing length, and then normalize this to the maximum rate possible (ma/mc) for a given system size. These measures apply to two pathway types—paths, ma(0) and ma(0) /mc(0), which forbid adjacent node repeti-tions, and walks, ma(1) and ma(1) /mc(1), which allow them. We find that network size has a curvilinear effect on the path-way number versus length relationship, and extent and pattern of connectance are convolved. Values computed for the paths and walks of three ecosystem models (oyster reef, freshwater marsh, and reservoir cove) are used to compare their pathway structure...|$|E
40|$|Coastal lagoons provide {{important}} ecosystem services worldwide but {{are subject to}} high and multiple environmental stresses. Little information exists on the inner creeks of low-flow coastal lagoons, where the low-exchange rates may exacerbate anthropogenic impacts. In this work, we used a model with high spatio-temporal resolution to describe the hydrodynamics and to estimate the accumulation of conservative contaminants in the upper estuary of the Urias sub-tropical coastal lagoon, in northwestern Mexico. The lagoon shows a weak anti-estuarine behavior and its hydrodynamics is governed by astronomical tides and topography. The mean steady-state water age in the three lagoon areas was ∼ 15, ∼ 30 and ∼ 70 days in the Harbor, Intermediate and Upper Areas, respectively. Thus, the Upper Area, which shelters a mangrove forest, is the most vulnerable to pollution due to the high potential for accumulation. As a best case scenario, the simulation of the release of <b>conservative</b> <b>substances</b> in the Upper area indicated that, 50 days after the release started, conservative pollutants mostly remained in the Upper Area and were not significantly exported to the open ocean. This methodology {{can be used to}} model the impact of <b>conservative</b> <b>substances</b> in coastal lagoons worldwide, and can be complementary and useful for the optimization of long-term coastal zone management activities...|$|R

The eSEA is applied to a simplified region used for crop farming. The {{extent to which the}} region concentrates or dilutes nitrogen compounds is expressed as the change in statistical entropy (DH).

Vertical salinity distribution in the narrow deep river varied from well mixed to stratified, both spatially and temporally. Comparison of estimated freshwater inputs to ADCP transport calculations indicates that the surrounding wetlands have the capacity to store and release a substantial amount of water to the river. The models are particularly useful in defining steady-state concentration distributions of dissolved <b>conservative</b> <b>substances</b> entering the river at a given flux. Spring and late summer residence times varied with river flow, as expected, from 52 to 102 days. The exception was 395 days during the summer drought of 1999...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to get an {{understanding}} of the transport of contaminants in a water distribution system, using the Model EPANET, in order to meet water quality regulations and customer expectations. For the application of the model a rural water supply system, having two probable water sources, an elevated tank, three schools and a hospital was selected. The transport of a <b>conservative</b> <b>substance</b> introduced at source, within the system was analysed by varying the hydraulic and water quality parameters for a predetermined demand pattern. The model was also used to design an effective operating program in a two-source distribution system in which pumping schedules were changed to get the contaminant levels below the maximum permissible values. Another application that was studied was the travel of a contaminant introduced at a point in the distribution system other than the source. Here, the study was confined to the behavior of a conservative tracer introduced at the hospital node. Finally, the behavior of a non <b>conservative</b> <b>substance</b> entering the system at source was studied. Here the substance considered was residual chlorine, and the decay of the residual chlorine introduced at the source with time and distance was studied. This is helpful in determining the lowest residual chlorine levels in the system, which is a useful parameter in maintaining a safe water supply. It was revealed that, under average demand conditions, time of travel of a contaminant to any point within the distribution system is the same irrespective of the contaminant concentration: and also it was observed that, if the contaminant is removed promptly the maximum concentration appearing at the nodes in the distribution system can be reduced to a great extent. Thus it was concluded that close monitoring of the source is extremely important in protecting the water supply from contamination. In the application of the model to the pollution tracing situation, the observation was that, under average flow conditions, the maximum concentration was reached at all nodes located downstream of the node at which the contaminant entered within about 3 hrs, irrespective of the concentration of contaminant. In the two source supply situation, it was observed that the water quality at the critical points in the system could be maintained below the permissible fluoride levels when the pump drawing water from the high fluoride content source was operated during the reak demand period of 13 to 24 hrs only. (with the assumed pump characteristics). When the behaviour of residual chlorine in the system was studied, it was observed that the model can be used to find out the chlorine booster points to maintain the required minimum residual chlorine content at the distribution ends. Thus it was concluded that the Model EPANET can satisfactorily be used to study the behaviour of contaminants in a water distribution system, and also we can use this to get an effective operating program in a multy-source system which satisfy the water quality requirements...|$|E
40|$|Mangroves are {{extremely}} important from the ecological and socio-economic perspectives, but are degrading {{at an alarming}} rate nowadays. Besides direct clearance, hydrological alterations or climatic changes, chemical pollution could be a significant contributor of mangrove degradation. To understand chemical pollution in mangroves, the input and output (mass balance) of pollutants within a region need to be assessed. To identify critical situations that cause high concentrations of contaminants in the mangrove wetland, residence time was defined as the time required for flushing out pollutants from a determined region, and evaluated through numerical modeling. This concept was applied to a pollutant mass balance in the Sungei Buloh mangrove system in Singapore, using actual measured inflow concentrations and hydrodynamic modelling of tide in- and outflows. Delft 3 D was used to model the hydrodynamics and pollutants (as <b>conservative</b> <b>substance)</b> transport. The model was forced at its offshore boundaries by harmonic constituents and residual flows and also by multiple canal discharges at the landward boundaries. The pollutant transport model provided comprehensive data to analyse the behaviour of flow dynamics with pollutants. Several scenarios (i. e. high and low tides, spring and neap conditions) were assessed for their influence on pollutant dynamics. Residence time was confirmed low during high tide and spring period, and high during low tide and neap period. This study provides a better understanding on the residence time and transport of pollutants due to tidal variation within the mangrove. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
40|$|Modelling {{contaminants}} in the Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve using Delft 3 D-WAQ results in useful data on residence times. Since measurements {{in the field}} are often not possible due to either safety hazards or ecological implications, the water quality model provides comprehensive data to analyse the behaviour of flow and contaminants and with that the residence time of these contaminants. The goal of this research was to define a workable definition of the residence time for {{contaminants in}} Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve and to use Delft 3 D to identify several situations in which concentration would become dangerously high or remain high {{for an extended period of}} time, to start with a simple <b>conservative</b> <b>substance.</b> The residence time is the time it takes for 95 % of the mass input to leave the control region without returning at a later phase of the tide. The control region is defined as the Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve, covering the wetland areas and channels and leaving out the sea. In order to identify critical situations, several scenarios were set up and assessed for their influence on the flow of the contaminants. A conservative contaminant was modelled. The scenarios comprised several possible important tidal factors – release during high or lower water, spring or neap tide – and the importance of the entrance location of the contamination. In addition, the model representation of the vegetation was changed from the use of a higher Manning roughness value to the use of a directional point model. The results show that in general, the residence time of contaminants is lower when the discharge happens with high water and during spring tide, while a discharge of contamination with low water and during neap tide increases the residence time. The use of the directional point model instead of an adapted Manning’s roughness representation generally decreases the residence times. Although only a conservative tracer was modelled, it is possible to say something about other tracers by superposition of properties; interest in detailed behaviour of specific substances could demand further exploration of these substances though. The water quality model used in this research can be used for that. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
40|$|A {{modification}} to {{the well-known}} water quality model 'Quality Simulation Along River Systems' (QUASAR) is presented, extending its utility to real-time forecasting {{applications such as}} the management and control of pollution incidents. Two aggregated dead-zone (ADZ) parameters, namely time delay and dispersive fraction, are incorporated into the existing model formulation, extending the current continuously stirred tank reactor based model processes to account for advective and active mixing volume dispersive processes. The resulting river water quality model combines {{the strengths of the}} QUASAR model, which has proven non-conservative pollutant modelling capabilities, with the accurate advection and dispersion characterisation of the ADZ model. A discrete-time mathematical representation of the governing equations is developed that enables efficient system identification methods of parameter estimation to be utilised. The enhanced water quality model and associated methods of parameter estimation are validated using data from tracer experiments conducted on the River Mimram. The revised model produces accurate predictions of observed concentration-time curves for <b>conservative</b> <b>substances...</b>|$|R

The model is able to give a highly detailed description of all the phenomena that may arise in the water system, such as: mixing, transportation of the inlet substances (through advection, eddy diffusion, molecular diffusion), volatilisation in the tanks, reactions with substances contained in the water and/or present on the pipes' internal walls. The capabilities of the proposed model in order to evaluate the concentrations, in steady-state conditions, of non <b>conservative</b> <b>substances</b> in a water system have been already illustrated (Pianese et al., 1997).

40|$|Chronic {{urticaria}} (CU) {{is defined}} as the occurrence of spontaneous wheals for a duration of more than 6 weeks and is the most frequent skin disease, with prevalence ranging between 15 and 25 %, and is a seriously disabling condition, with social isolation and mood changes causing a significant degree of dysfunction and quality of life impairment to many patients. The main clinical features of CU are the repeated occurrence of transient eruptions of pruritic wheals or patchy erythema on the skin that last less than 24 hours and disappear without sequelae. CU is often defined as Chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) because the causes of CU remain unknown in the great majority (70 - 95 %) of patients. Drugs, food, viruses, alimentary <b>conservative</b> <b>substances</b> or inhalant substances often seem to be involved in determining CIU skin flare. Despite a general agreement that bacteria infections and parasitic infestations can be involved in the pathogenesis of CIU, proven evidence of these relationships is lacking.

Provision of aerobic conditions offers several advantages including accelerated leachate stabilization, increased landfill airspace recovery {{and a reduction}} in greenhouse gas emissions. Air injection was applied over 130 days to bench-scale bioreactors containing fresh and aged MSW representative of newly constructed and pre-existing landfill conditions. In the fresh MSW simulation bioreactors, aeration reduced the aver-age time to stabilization of leachate pH by 46 days, TSS by 42 days, TDS by 84 days, BOD 5 by 46 days and COD by 32 days. In addition, final leachate concentrations were consistently lower in aerated test cells. There was no indication of a gradual decrease in the concentration of ammonia, and it is likely this high ammonia concentration would continue to be problematic in bioreactor landfill applications. This study focussed only on biodegradability of organics in the solid waste. The concentrations of the nonreactive or <b>conservative</b> <b>substances</b> such as chloride and/or heavy metals remain in the bioreactor landfills due to the continuous recir-culation of leachate.

Dispersive coefficients that are fixed in time were able to reproduce the observed salinity distributions {{very well in the}} Westerschelde. They were obtained by calibration on observed chlorinities. It is argued that the apparent relationship of dispersive coefficients with freshwater flow, which is observed in certain studies, could (partly) reflect the deviation from steady state conditions which are required assumptions to calculate these dispersive coefficients directly from salinity profiles.

40|$|The {{transport}} of solutes in rivers {{is influenced by}} the exchange of water between the river and the underlying hyporheic zone. The residence times of solutes in the hyporheic zone are typically much longer than traveltimes in the stream, resulting in a significant delay in the downstream propagation of solutes. A new model for this process is proposed here {{on the basis of the}} continuous time random walk (CTRW) approach. The CTRW is a generalization of the classic random walk that can include arbitrary distributions of waiting times, and it is particularly suited to deal with the long residence times arising from hyporheic exchange. Inclusion of suitable hyporheic residence time distributions in the CTRW leads to a generalized advection-dispersion equation for in-stream concentration breakthrough curves that includes the effects of specific hyporheic exchange processes. Here examples are presented for advective hyporheic exchange resulting from regular and irregular series of bedforms. A second major advantage of the CTRW approach is that the combined effects of different processes affecting overall downstream transport can be incorporated in the model by convolving separate waiting time distributions for each relevant process. The utility of this approach is illustrated by analyzing the effects of local-scale sediment heterogeneity on bedform-induced hyporheic exchange. The ability to handle arbitrarily wide residence time distributions and the ability to assess the combined effects of multiple transport processes makes the CTRW model framework very useful for the study of solute transport problems in rivers. The model presented here can be easily extended to represent different types of surface-subsurface exchange processes and the {{transport of}} both <b>conservative</b> and nonconservative <b>substances</b> in river...|$|R
40|$|The {{thesis is}} a {{treatise}} of {{the quantity and}} quality aspects of potable water in distribution systems. The privatisation of the UK Water Industry in 1989 has seen the requirement for the Water Companies in England and Wales to be responsible for the delivery of good quality water that meets the demand of all consumers. In respect of the quantity of supply, there have been many previous studies that have examined the hydraulic performance of distribution systems and there are now many proprietary mathematical models that have been successfully used in this study. However, in respect of water quality the literature review has highlighted that the modelling approach is not so well advanced, as water quality is a function of many concepts, processes and parameters that include the source and age of water, the condition and deterioration of the assets in the system, the microbiological, chemical and physical processes and the network hydraulic performance, including pressure transients. These processes are highly interactive and complex. In an attempt to better understand these processes a programme of research has been completed that has involved a field evaluation of the performance of a live system, including the development of instrumentation to continually measure water quality, {{and the development of a}} mathematical model to describe the processes associated with the age of water and the propagation of <b>conservative</b> and non-conservative <b>substances.</b> An initial attempt has also been made to develop a micro-biological model and a sediment transport model.

Lacking testing {{information can be}} replaced by non-testing information such as Quantitative Structure Activity Relationships (QSARs), but even though this latter information comes with lower reliability, this is seldom {{taken into account in}} the forthcoming assessments. The difficulty to meet standards for best information calls for strategies to handle data gaps which take varying reliability in information into account. Using safety factors when reliability is low can be problematic since this result in more <b>conservative</b> evaluations of <b>substances</b> for which information is of low reliability and an unknown level of risk aversion in the assessment. An alternative is to reflect lower reliability using probability distributions representing the expected error in the information and propagate this uncertainty in the forthcoming assessments using Monte Carlo analysis. It is even possible to let the error to expect from QSARs depend to what extent a substance falls inside the models domain of applicability. QSARs cannot fill all gaps in data. Default values can be used instead of leaving substances out of assessments, but if so, these should reflect low reliability as well. We demonstrate the practical implications of four strategies to handle varying reliability in information on algal toxicity in a Life Cycle Impact Assessment on 159 plastic additives of concern using emissions from societal plastic materials in Sweden. A review concluded that a small amount of these substances had toxicity data for algae Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata. A QSAR was constructed which provided non-testing algal information of substances inside and on the border of the models domain of applicability evaluated by PmodXPS.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Increased {{levels of}} proinflammatory cytokines seem {{to play a}} pivotal role in the {{development}} of back pain in a subpopulation of patients with degenerative intervertebral disc (IVD) disease. As current treatment options are mostly limited to surgical interventions or <b>conservative</b> treatment, anti-inflammatory <b>substances</b> might offer a novel, more target-orientated therapeutic approach. Triptolide (TPL), a natural substance found in the Chinese medicinal herb Tripterygium wilfordii Hook, has been demonstrated to possess anti-inflammatory effects in various cells, but no studies exist so far for the IVD. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the effects of TPL on human IVD cells by analyzing changes in gene expression and underlying molecular mechanisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In order to investigate the anti-inflammatory, anabolic and anti-catabolic effect of TPL, dose-dependency experiments (n = 5) and time course experiments (n = 5) were performed on IL- 1 β prestimulated human IVD cells and changes in gene expression of IL- 6 /- 8, TNF-α, PGE 2 S, MMP 1 / 2 / 3 / 13, aggrecan and collagen-I/-II were analyzed by real-time RT-PCR. The molecular mechanisms underlying the effects observed upon TPL treatment were investigated by analyzing involvement of Toll-like receptors TLR 2 / 4 (real-time RT-PCR, n = 5), NF-κB, MAP kinases p 38, ERK and JNK (immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry, n = 4) as well as RNA polymerase II (immunoblotting, n = 3). RESULTS: Results showed that 50 nM TPL exhibited an anti-inflammatory, anti-catabolic and anabolic effect on the mRNA level for IL- 6 /- 8, PGE 2 S, MMP 1 / 2 / 3 / 13, aggrecan, collagen-II and TLR 2 / 4, with most pronounced changes after 18 h for proinflammatory cytokines and MMPs or 30 h for TLRs and matrix proteins. However, we also observed an up-regulation of TNF-α at higher concentrations. The effects of TPL did not seem to be mediated via an inhibition of NF-κB or a decrease of RNA polymerase II levels, but TPL influenced activity of MAP kinases p 38 and ERK (but not JNK) and expression of TLR 2 / 4. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, TPL may possess promising potential for the treatment of inflammation-related discogenic back pain in vitro, but its analgetic effect will need to be confirmed in an appropriate in vivo animal model...|$|R
