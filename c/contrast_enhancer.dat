40|$|Abstract: The {{contrast}} of any {{image is a}} very important characteristic by which the image can be judged as good or poor. In this paper, we introduce a simple approach for the process of image contrast enhancement using the sigmoid function in spatial domain. To achieve this simple contrast enhancement, a novel mask based on using the input value together with the sigmoid function formula in an equation that will be used as <b>contrast</b> <b>enhancer.</b> This new <b>contrast</b> <b>enhancer</b> is passing over the target image, operates on its pixels, one by one. The new <b>contrast</b> <b>enhancer</b> is a scaled version of the input that is performed by applying a sigmoid function to the signal itself. The intensity value of each pixel in the output image is computing according to a specific formula. The parameters of the sigmoid function were determined by using three different methods. The effect of gain’s value on the contrast enhancement process was studied. The new enhancing approach has been successfully, applied in several gray scale images. We proved that it works efficiently in different dark and bright images adjusting their contrasts. Moreover, the new enhancing approach was effective in dealing with colored images resulting in high-quality outputs. Our proposed algorithm is a simple approach that can be used successfully, in various applications suffering from different image’s contrast problems...|$|E

We show that sound scattering and "active" emission of sound from oscillating bubbles are not contradictory, but are just two different aspects derived from the same physics. Treating the bubble as a nonlinear oscillator, we arrive at general formulas for scattering and absorption cross-sections. We show that several well-known formulas are recovered in the linear limit of this ansatz. In the case of strongly nonlinear oscillations, however, the cross-sections can be larger than those for linear response by several orders of magnitude.

In this study, we show that adenovirus E 1 A expression in the highly differentiated human hepatoma line Huh 6 strongly inhibits HBV enhancer 2 -stimulated transcription while having no effect on HBV enhancer 1 activity. A sequence motif in HBV enhancer 2 which is essential for its enhancer function is the target for E 1 A-mediated repression. The repression of HBV enhancer 2 activity is mediated through the N-terminal region of the E 1 A proteins known to bind a 300 -kDa cellular protein.

Although {{it is known that}} lineage specification depends on cell-specific gene expression, which in turn is driven by promoters, enhancers, insulators and other cis-regulatory DNA sequences for each gene 1, 2, 3, the relative roles of these regulatory elements in this process are not clear. We have previously developed a chromatin-immunoprecipitation-based microarray method (ChIP-chip) to locate promoters, enhancers and insulators in the human genome 4, 5, 6. Here we use the same approach to identify these elements in multiple cell types and investigate their roles in cell-type-specific gene expression. We observed that the chromatin state at promoters and CTCF-binding at insulators is largely invariant across diverse cell types.

40|$|Dual energy imaging {{has made}} it {{possible}} to enhance contrast in medical images using images containing different energy information, by combining low and high energy images. Dual energy data can either be acquired using double exposures or splitting the energy spectrum into two images using one exposure. This thesis presents investigations of dual energy imaging using a detector solution developed by XCounter which provides dual energy images in a single exposure with a threshold separating low and high energy images. Phantom experiments with phantoms of aluminum and plexiglas were performed using weighted logarithmic subtraction and basis material decomposition to produce dual energy images. Methods were validated and images were evaluated in terms of signal difference in noise ratio to find the threshold and tube voltage combination for optimum energy spectrum separation. The methods were also tested on biological materials using bone, soft tissue and iodine solution as <b>contrast</b> <b>enhancer,</b> to investigate K-edge imaging.   Optimal separation of plexiglas and aluminum were found at 70 kVp and the threshold parameter set within a range of 8 to 9, which corresponds to approximately 30 to 34 keV.

Analysis of mutant enhancer constructs identified two elements, beta E 2 and beta E 3, conferring phorbol ester inducibility. Multimerized beta E 2 acted in isolation as a phorbol ester-responsive element. Both beta E 2 and beta E 3, which contain a consensus Ets-binding site, were shown to bind directly to {{the product of the}} c-ets- 1 protooncogene. Both regions also bound a second factor, core-binding factor. Mutation of the beta E 2 Ets site abolished the inducibility of the beta E 2 multimer. beta E 2 and beta E 3 Ets site mutations also profoundly affected activity and inducibility of the enhancer.

New, oleate-covered, iron oxide particles {{have been prepared}} either by co-precipitation or thermal decomposition methods and incorporated into poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles (PLGA-Fe-NPs) to improve their biocompatibility and in vivo stability. Moreover, the PLGA-Fe-NPs have been loaded with paclitaxel to pursue an MFH-triggered drug release. Remarkably, {{it has been found}} that the nanoparticle formulations are characterized by peculiar H- 1 nuclear magnetic relaxation dispersion (NMRD) profiles that directly correlate with their heating potential when exposed to an alternating magnetic field. By prolonging the magnetic field exposure to 30 min, a significant drug release was observed for PLGA-Fe-NPs {{in the case of the}} larger-sized magnetic nanoparticles. Furthermore, the immobilization of lipophilic Fe-NPs in PLGA-NPs also made it possible to maintain Neel relaxation as the dominant relaxation contribution in the presence of large iron oxide cores (diameters of 15 - 20 nm), with the advantage of preserving their efficiency when they are entrapped in the intracellular environment. The results reported herein show that NMRD profiles are a useful tool for anticipating the heating capabilities of Fe-NPs designed for MFH applications...|$|R

We first employ modified phase functions generated with a weighting scheme that accounts for the relative scattering strengths of unlabeled tissue and nanoparticles. To present a comparative analysis, we repeat ourMCsimulations with simplified functions that only approximate the angular scattering properties of labeled tissues. The results obtained for common optical sensor geometries and biologically relevant labeling schemes indicate that the exact form of the phase function used as model input {{plays an important role}} in determining the reflectance response and approximating functions often prove inadequate in predicting the extent of contrast enhancement due to labeling.

We carry out Monte Carlo simulations to model photon propagation through normal tissues, unlabeled precancerous tissues, and precancerous tissues labeled with gold nanospheres and we compute the spectral reflectance response {{of these different}} tissue states. The results indicate that nanoparticle-induced changes in the spectral reflectance profile of tissues depend {{not only on the}} properties of these particles but also on the source-detector geometry used. When the source and detector fibers are oriented side by side and perpendicular to the tissue surface, the reflectance intensity of precancerous tissue is lower compared to that of normal tissue over the entire wavelength range simulated and addition of nanospheres enhances this negative contrast. When the fibers are tilted toward each other, the reflectance intensity of precancerous tissue is higher compared to that of normal tissue and labeling with nanospheres causes a significant enhancement of this positive contrast. The results also suggest that model-based spectral analysis of photon propagation through nanoparticle-labeled tissues provides a useful framework to quantify the extent of achievable contrast enhancement due to external labeling and to assess the diagnostic potential of nanoparticle-enhanced optical measurements. © 2011 SPIE-OSA...|$|R

Transient transfection experiments revealed that both the viral enhancer region in the U 3 region of the long terminal repeat {{as well as a}} repressor element coincident with the primer binding site of Moloney leukemia viruses are limiting for expression in hematopoietic cells in a differentiation-dependent manner. Within the group of Moloney leukemia virus-related viruses, only the myeloproliferative sarcoma virus showed high enhancer activity in myeloid (including ery-throid) cells.

On the basis of these results, two types of novel retroviral hybrid vectors were developed; they combine the U 3 regions of either the Friend mink cell focus-forming virus family or the myeloproliferative sarcoma virus with the primer binding site of the murine embryonic stem cell virus.

The crucial issues include inadequate treatment efficacy due to ineffective targeting of cancer deposits, systemic toxicities, suboptimal cancer detection and disease monitoring. This {{has led to the}} quest for clinically relevant, innovative multifaceted solutions such as development of targeted and traceable therapies. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have the intrinsic ability to “home” to growing tumors and are hypoimmunogenic. Therefore, these can be used as (a) “Trojan Horses” to deliver gene therapy directly into the tumors and (b) carriers of nanoparticles to allow cell tracking and simultaneous cancer detection.

For all these applications there is a recognised need for improved synthetic methods that are capable of yielding SPIONs of uniform size, geometry and stoichiometry. Microfluidic reactors offer an attractive route to nanoparticle synthesis due to the superior control they provide over reaction conditions and particle properties relative to traditional bulk methods. In 2002 Edel et al. 1 proposed the use of microfluidic reactors for nanoparticle synthesis due to the high levels of control they provide over key reaction parameters such as temperature, reagent concentrations and reaction time. Since that report a diversity of metal, metal oxide, compound semiconductor and organic nanomaterials have been successfully synthesised in microfluidic systems. Most reports of nanoparticle synthesis in microreactors have involved single-phase mode of operation, in which continuous streams of miscible fluids are manoeuvred through microscale channels where nucleation and growth take place. Such reactors, however, are poorly suited to the synthesis of SPIONs due to their high susceptibility to fouling. An alternative approach is to use droplet-based reactors in which an immiscible liquid is injected alongside the reaction mixture, causing the latter to spontaneously divide into a series of near identical droplets. In this thesis microfluidic synthesis of SPIONs in a controlled and reproducible manner is described.

The aim of these new techniques is to provide more information about a certain lesion in order to differentiate these lesions into benign and malignant. Although definitive differentiation is still a matter of histology, these new techniques are able to greatly increase the chance of correct diagnosis. Elastography is a technique which allows the estimation of the hardness of a lesion. The major problem of the technique is, however, that a hard structure is not necessarily malignant. Contrast-enhanced high mechanical index color Doppler endosonography was introduced shortly after {{the development of the}} ultrasound <b>contrast</b> <b>enhancer.</b> It provides the endosonographist vital information about the macrovessel system of the pancreas and can therefore discriminate inflammatory from malignant pancreatic lesions {{with a high degree of}} certainty.

Because there are some cancerous lesions with an intact microvessel system, the degree of certainty is not as high as the high mechanical index version; however, it is still useful for clinical practice. The best results with the method can be achieved by using it for discrimination of cystic pancreatic lesions because of the excellent resolution of the method. Both methods can be used for a simultaneous three-dimensional (3 D) reconstruction. The 3 D reconstruction helps to mark the outlines of a lesion, and the data can be used to scroll through the lesion after the procedure is finished.

In addition, two-photon fluorescence microscopy is a potential tool for non-invasive skin cancer diagnostics, which also is a topic of this thesis. In order to acquire quantitative data, two-photon fluorescence microscopy has been combined with fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (TPFCS). This is {{to the best of my}} knowledge the first time TPFCS has been applied to study the diffusion and distribution of fluorescent molecules in human skin. By the use of this method a reactive compound, acting as a contact allergen, has been demonstrated to bind to proteins in the top epidermal layers of the skin, resulting in a significantly slower diffusion. It has been proposed that endogenously formed protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) can be applied to improve contrast when performing two-photon fluorescence microscopy for diagnostics of non-melanoma skin cancer. In this thesis, it is demonstrated that detection of two-photon excited fluorescence of endogenous PpIX in human skin is not possible. Instead, it is preferable to use a slightly shorter wavelength, i. e. 710 nm, to induce one-photon anti-Stokes fluorescence. This finding is of great importance for continued work in the field, bringing non-linear optical microscopy into the clinics. Plasmonic noble metal nanoparticles, e. g. gold nanoparticles, have been proposed as <b>contrast</b> <b>enhancers</b> for several biomedical applications. In this thesis, gold nanoparticles have been explored with respect to their multiphoton induced luminescence when combined with non-linear optical microscopy. By investigating 10 nm gold nanoparticles deposited on glass plates, it is here demonstrated that aggregation and short inter-particle distances are prerequisites in order to detect multiphoton induced luminescence. Thus detection of single particles in a biological environment is unlikely, and future work should be undertaken to explore how the clustering can be controlled in a biological environment to, e. g, be used as a contrast mechanism...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe nuclear {{receptor}} peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) is a {{transcription factor}} whose expression is induced during adipogenesis {{and that is}} required for the acquisition and control of mature adipocyte functions. Indeed, PPAR induces the expression of genes involved in lipid synthesis and storage through enhancers activated during adipocyte differentiation. Here, we show that PPAR also binds to enhancers already active in preadipocytes as evidenced by an active chromatin state including lower DNA methylation levels despite higher CpG content. These constitutive enhancers are linked to genes involved in the insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling pathway that are transcriptionally induced during adipogenesis but to a lower extent than lipid metabolism genes, because of stronger basal expression levels in preadipocytes. This is consistent with the sequential involvement of hormonal sensitivity and lipid handling during adipocyte maturation and correlates with the chromatin structure dynamics at constitutive and activated enhancers. Interestingly, constitutive enhancers are evolutionary conserved and can be activated in other tissues, in <b>contrast</b> to <b>enhancers</b> controlling lipid handling genes whose activation is more restricted to adipocytes. Thus, PPAR utilizes both broadly active and cell type-specific enhancers to modulate the dynamic range of activation of genes involved in the adipogenic process...|$|R
40|$|There is an {{increasing}} interest for nanomaterials in biomedical applications and in this work, nanoparticles of gadolinium oxide (Gd 2 O 3) have been investigated as a novel contrast agent for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Relaxation properties have been studied in aqueous solutions {{as well as in}} cell culture medium and the nanoparticles have been explored as cell labeling agents. The fluorescent properties of the particles were used to visualize the internalization in cells and doped particles were also investigated as a multimodal agent that could work as a fluorescent marker for microscopy and as a <b>contrast</b> <b>enhancer</b> for MRI. Results show that in aqueous solutions, there is a twofold increase in relaxivity for Gd 2 O 3 compared to commercial agent Gd-DTPA. In cell culture medium as well as in cells, there is a clear T 1 effect and a distinct increase in signal intensity in T 1 mapped images. Fluorescent studies show that the Gd 2 O 3 nanoparticles doped with 5 % terbium have interesting fluorescent properties and that these particles could work as a multimodal contrast agent. This study shows that Gd 2 O 3 nanoparticles possess excellent relaxation properties that are retained in more biological environments. Gd 2 O 3 particles are suitable as a T 1 contrast agent, but seem also be adequate for T 2 enhancement in for instance cell labeling experiments. iii ivAcknowledgements First of all, I would like to thank my supervisor, Maria Engström, for all your support, knowledge, encouragement, ideas and patience.

40|$|The retrospektive data {{analysis}} of 403 patients with focal nodular hyperplasia {{of the liver}} proved that women are concerned by the FNH 12 times more often than men and the tumour is diagnosed predominantly between the 3. - 4 th life decade. At this time the diameter amounts to 5 - 6 cm. The FNH more often appears in the right one than in the left liver cloth and causes with 15 % of untypical discomfort. With 30 % of the patients several lesions exist. 98 % of the FNH have a central scar, 97 % are cauliflower-like lobulated. In 60 % the thing appears poor in echo. An appearance poor in echo {{is associated with a}} fatty degeneration of the liver which exists with 90 % of the men, but only with 27 % of the women. With 240 cases the natural course of a FNH could be pursued in the observation period of 1 - 18 years - on an average 4. 7 years. The FNH has shrunk in the observation period with 50 %, has stayed the same with 30 % and with 20 % grown. With 363 patients the contrast behave of the FNH has been examined after intravenÃ¶ser injection of an echo signal enhancer. In 92 % we could see a classical contrast-behave of the FNH. In 8 % appeared an atypical picture after injection of an <b>contrast</b> <b>enhancer.</b> The {{data analysis}} of 193 cases shows that the FNH is in 95 % a tumor rich in vessels whose bringing artery branches out in the centre of the FNH (vascular type Ia, 85 %). 10 % of the FNH own an eccentric branching out of the central artery(type Ib). The vascular type II is rare. The FNH of the classical kind can be diagnosed with the help of echo signal amplifiers sonographial certainly and needs with unobtrusive anamnesis of no additional cut picture diagnostics. A biopsy is unnecessary if the criteria specific for contrast medium of the FNH are to be proved. Because the forecast is not affected by a FNH, discomfort hardly appears, complications seems to be extremely seldom and the FNH shrinks in half of the cases from the 40 th year, a waiting behaviour under occasional sonographic course controls is justified and enough...|$|E
40|$|Figure 2 (not included) {{shows in}} short the most {{important}} parts of an MRI measurement. First the protons in the patient’s body are excited by an RF pulse, which causes the spins to flip from the Z-direction along the external field to the XY-plane. Directly after that, the relaxation process starts and the spins return to their original state. This relaxation creates a signal that can be measured by receiver coils. Due to the controlled gradients in the magnetic field strength, protons at different spatial positions have a slightly different frequency and phase. Frequency dependent measurements of this signal can be transformed into an MRI. Contrast is the possibility to distinguish an object from another object or the background, as for example the letters of this text can be distinguished from the background or the red arrows in figure 2 (not included) {{from the rest of}} the figure. The contrast of an object (tissues/organs) to another object or background depends on differences in intrinsic and extrinsic parameters. We can alter the extrinsic parameters easily by changing the measurement parameters (echo time, repetition time, etc), but if this is not enough we also can introduce a contrast agent. This contrast agent will alter the intrinsic relaxivity parameters and this can alter the contrast between tissues significantly. Many kinds of contrast agents are available, like gadolinium, manganese and iron oxide core particles. These contrast agents can be divided in several classifications, like T 1 or T 2 enhancers and paramagnetic or superparamagnetic particles. A very important point is that contrast agents used in MRI themselves will not generate any signal. It is their influence on neighbouring nuclei what explains the extra contrast that is produced when contrast agents are used. The contrast agents will enhance the local relaxation by shortening T 1 and T 2 for protons in the proximity. One of {{the most important}} contrast agents for MRI is the contrast agent that has an iron oxide core. The iron core particles can be used as a T 1 and a T 2 <b>contrast</b> <b>enhancer.</b> The usability of the iron oxide particle as a contrast agent depends on many physical factors, like size, shape, applied magnetic field and iron concentration. At the moment iron oxide contrast agents are developed that are more than just an iron oxide core with a simple shell: new smart contrast agents have functional groups in the shell so they are guided to specific tissue. In other current research the contrast agent is added to drugs or human cells, like stem cells, that can be used as a therapy...|$|E
40|$|SummaryTranscription-factor-induced {{somatic cell}} {{conversions}} are highly relevant for both basic and clinical research yet their mechanism {{is not fully}} understood and {{it is unclear whether}} they reflect normal differentiation processes. Here we show that during pre-B-cell-to-macrophage transdifferentiation, C/EBPα binds to two types of myeloid enhancers in B cells: pre-existing enhancers that are bound by PU. 1, providing a platform for incoming C/EBPα; and de novo enhancers that are targeted by C/EBPα, acting as a pioneer factor for subsequent binding by PU. 1. The order of factor binding dictates the upregulation kinetics of nearby genes. Pre-existing enhancers are broadly active throughout the hematopoietic lineage tree, including B cells. In <b>contrast,</b> de novo <b>enhancers</b> are silent in most cell types except in myeloid cells where they become activated by C/EBP factors. Our data suggest that C/EBPα recapitulates physiological developmental processes by short-circuiting two macrophage enhancer pathways in pre-B cells...|$|R
40|$|Inhibition of {{neuronal}} {{activity in}} networks of the mammalian {{central nervous system}} is essential for all fundamental brain functions, ranging from perception, to consciousness, to action. Both exacerbation and diminution of inhibition dramatically affect our behavioral capacities, indicating that, in the healthy brain, strength and dynamics of inhibition must be precisely balanced. Inhibitory functions are primarily accomplished by neurons releasing the neurotransmitter GABA. According to their wide variety of functions, GABAergic neurons show a tremendous diversity in morphological, biochemical and functional characteristics. The combination of these diverse properties allows the brain to generate interneurons acting as, for examples, filters, co-incidence detectors or <b>contrast</b> <b>enhancers.</b> GABAergic signaling in thalamus plays {{an essential role in}} controlling sensory information flow from the periphery to the cortical processing centers, and in generating sleep-related neuronal rhythms. Surprisingly, however, the diversity of GABAergic neurons is remarkably limited in thalamic networks. Both functions mentioned have been tightly associated with two homogeneous groups of GABAergic neurons arising within thalamic nuclei or within the nucleus reticularis, a shell of inhibitory nuclei surrounding the dorsal thalamus. The results arising from the present thesis challenge the view that the diversity of GABAergic signaling in thalamus is comparatively limited and proposes that, to fully understand GABAergic signaling in thalamus, at least two additional aspects have to be considered. First, it shows that GABAergic signaling arising from the nucleus reticularis can {{have a profound effect on}} the synthesis of second messenger compounds that are important in the control of neuronal rhythmicities and in the statedependent control of gene expression. Second, it demonstrates the functional relevance of a previously undescribed extrathalamic and extrareticular inhibitory pathway that arises within the anterior pretectal nuclei, indicating that the architecture of GABAergic signaling in thalamus has to be complemented by a conceptually novel, powerful afferent pathway. The first part investigates the modulation of cAMP synthesis by GABA in thalamocortical neurons through the activation of the Gi-coupled GABAB receptors. GABAB receptors can provide two different cAMP signals in the neurons. First, GABAB receptor activation depresses the level of cAMP inside thalamocortical neurons. However, a large and long cAMP signal is observed when GABAB receptors are activated concomitantly with b-adrenergic receptors, which are Gscoupled receptors. In the presence of GABAB receptor agonists, the moderate cAMP increase produced by b-adrenergic receptor activation is transformed into a large synthesis of cAMP. Remarkably, the activation of the GABAB receptors at the synapses between reticular neurons and thalamocortical neurons also potentiates the effects of b-adrenergic receptors. Thus, GABAB receptors modulate cAMP signals at synapses that are important for the regulation of the state of arousal. The second part provides the first electrophysiological description of synaptic connections between the anterior pretectum group and the thalamic higher-order nuclei. Electric stimulation in the anterior pretectum group evoked inhibitory postsynaptic responses (IPS) in the thalamocortical neurons of the higher-order nuclei. We showed that the IPS responses were mediated via the GABAA receptors activated through monosynaptic connections between the APT and the higher-order nuclei. Functionally, the anterior pretectum modulated the discharge properties of the thalamocortical neurons, suggesting an important role of this nucleus in the dialogue between the thalamus and the cortex...|$|R
40|$|SummaryThe core pluripotency factor Oct 4 plays {{key roles}} in somatic cell {{reprogramming}} through transcriptional control. Here, we profile Oct 4 occupancy, epigenetic changes, and gene expression in reprogramming. We find that Oct 4 binds in a hierarchical manner to target sites with primed epigenetic modifications. Oct 4 binding is temporally continuous and seldom switches between bound and unbound. Oct 4 occupancy {{in most of}} promoters is maintained throughout the entire reprogramming process. In <b>contrast,</b> somatic cell-specific <b>enhancers</b> are silenced in the early and intermediate stages, whereas stem cell-specific enhancers are activated in the late stage in parallel with cell fate transition. Both epigenetic remodeling and Oct 4 binding contribute to the hyperdynamic enhancer signature transitions. The hierarchical Oct 4 bindings are associated with distinct functional themes at different stages. Collectively, our results provide a comprehensive molecular roadmap of Oct 4 binding in concert with epigenetic rearrangements and rich resources for future reprogramming studies...|$|R
