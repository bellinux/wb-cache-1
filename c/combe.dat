5|$|Allen {{acquired}} the stone quarries at <b>Combe</b> Down and Bathampton Down Mines. He used the unique honey-coloured Bath stone, {{used to build}} the Georgian city, {{and as a result}} made a second fortune. Allen built a railway line from his mine on <b>Combe</b> Down which carried the stone down the hill, now known as Ralph Allen Drive, which runs beside Prior Park, to a wharf he constructed at Bath Locks on the Kennet and Avon Canal to transport stone to London. Following a failed bid to supply stone to buildings in London, Allen wanted a building which would show off the properties of Bath stone as a building material.|$|E

5|$|A postwar {{review of}} {{inadequate}} housing {{led to the}} clearance and redevelopment of {{areas of the city}} in a postwar style, often at variance with the local Georgian style. In the 1950s the nearby villages of <b>Combe</b> Down, Twerton and Weston were incorporated into the city to enable the development of housing, much of it council housing. In the 1970s and 1980s it was recognised that conservation of historic buildings was inadequate, leading to more care and reuse of buildings and open spaces. In 1987 the city was selected by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site, recognising its international cultural significance.|$|E
5|$|One last raid {{was carried}} out on the 14 June—the day Paris fell—and the {{squadron}} abandoned France as Allied resistance crumbled. They landed at Houssay airfield. They then took off for RAF Driffield in Yorkshire. As they crossed over England MacLachlan took a detour to do a low fly-past over his old school at Monkton <b>Combe</b> near Bath.

5000|$|In fact, it {{was invented}} in 1667 by a Jesuit {{historian}} who had not read any of those accounts. Fr. Francisco <b>Combés,</b> S.J., had read three works that refer to the Mazaua episode: by Giovanni Battista Ramusio, who said the port was [...] "Buthuan", and this <b>Combés</b> adopted; by Antonio de Herrera, who said it was [...] "Mazaua", which <b>Combés</b> rejected; and by Fr. Francisco Colín, S.J., who said the island was Butuan. Colín pointed to another island he called Dimasaua to signify it is not (di is Bisaya for not) the isle where an Easter mass was celebrated. The island is Pigafetta's Gatighan. In the case of <b>Combés,</b> who wrote five years after Colín, he did not adopt Dimasaua because his story does not mention any mass at all.|$|R
