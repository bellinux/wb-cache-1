5|$|Groomed trail skiing {{occurs at}} facilities, such as Nordmarka (Oslo), Royal Gorge Cross Country Ski Resort and Gatineau Park, Quebec, where trails {{are laid out}} and groomed for both classic and skate-skiing. Such {{grooming}} and track setting (for classic technique) requires specialized equipment and techniques that adapt to the <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> snow. Trail preparation employs snow machines that tow snow compaction, texturing and track-setting devices. Groomers must adapt such equipment to the <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> snow—crystal structure, temperature, degree of compaction, moisture content, etc. Depending on the initial <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> snow, grooming may achieve an increase in density for new-fallen snow or a decrease in density for icy or compacted snow. Cross-country ski facilities may incorporate a course design that meets homologation standards for such organizations as the International Olympic Committee, the International Ski Federation or national standards. Standards address course distances, degree of difficulty with maximums in elevation difference and steepness—both up and downhill, plus other factors. Some facilities have night-time lighting on select trails—called lysløype (light trails) in Norwegian and elljusspår (electric light trails) in Swedish. The first lysløype were opened in 1946 in Nordmarka and at Byåsen (Trondheim).|$|E

There are few health conditions that absolutely preclude placing implants although there are certain conditions that can increase the risk of failure. Those with poor oral hygiene, heavy smokers and diabetics are all at greater risk for a variant of gum disease that affects implants called peri-implantitis, increasing the chance of long-term failures. Long-term steroid use, osteoporosis and other diseases that affect the bones can increase the risk of early failure of implants.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: A fluorogenic peptide probe-immobilized {{diagnostic}} kit {{was used to}} analyze MMP activity in the synovial fluids (SFs) from patients with osteoarthritis (OA) and acute inflammatory <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> knee joint. Methods: The MMP {{diagnostic kit}} containing a polymer-conjugated MMP probe immobilized on a 96 -well plate was utilized for high-throughput screening of MMP activity in SFs from OA patients (n = 33) and patients with acute inflammatory <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> knee joint (n = 5). Results: Compared to SF from OA patients, SF from patients with acute inflammatory <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> knee joint presented stronger NIR fluorescent signals. In gelatin zymography, most samples from patients with acute inflammatory <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> knee joint also displayed 92 kDa (pro-form) MMP- 9 and faint 84 kDa (active form) MMP- 9, while SF from OA patients did not display detectable MMP- 9 activity. Conclusion: <b>The</b> presence <b>of</b> a strong fluorescence signal from the MMP diagnostic kit corresponded well with patients with acute inflammatory <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> knee joint. The results suggest that our MMP diagnostic kit {{can be useful in}} differentiation between early stages of OA and acute inflammatory <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> knee joint. </p...|$|R

5|$|After Margaret's death, {{the castle}} {{continued}} to be owned by the Dacre family until the death of Randal Dacre in 1634, when it passed briefly to the Crown. By 1675 the castle had become derelict and was restored by the then Lord Dacre, Thomas Lennard. A new entrance to the castle was constructed and square, 17th-century windows installed. After Thomas's death in 1715 the castle was sold to Edward Hassell.
