5|$|By 1988, {{building}} costs had increased from NOK 88 to 131 million. The municipalities had co-signed {{for a foreign}} loan, and were forced to pay NOK 3.5 million annually just in interest, {{in addition to the}} operating cost of the airport; these were aggravated by not only the loss of the sole scheduled service, but also considerably less <b>charter</b> <b>traffic</b> than estimated. In 1990, the airport company was forced to refinance, and NOK 61 of 85 million in dept was refinanced, and the obligations transferred from the airport company to the municipalities and the county. However, by 1991, passenger numbers were above 20,000, three quarters coming from <b>charter</b> <b>traffic.</b> On 1January 1996, Fagernes Airport was nationalized, along with 25 other regional airports, and put {{under the control of the}} Norwegian Airport Authority (now Avinor). Following the closure of Geilo Airport, Dagali in 2003, Fagernes experienced an increase in <b>charter</b> <b>traffic.</b>|$|E

5|$|During the 1960s, a {{political}} debate started concerning {{whether or not}} a new main airport should be built for Oslo and Eastern Norway. A government report launched in 1970, suggested surveys for five locations: Gardermoen, Hurum, Askim, Nesodden and Ås. Hobøl was preliminarily selected and areas reserved for a future airport. During the 1970s, the Labour Party became concerned that Hobøl was located too centrally in relation to the growth areas around Oslo, and instead wanted to use Gardermoen, in an attempt to force the population growth further north. Commercial interests and the airlines supported Hobøl. In 1983, Parliament decided to abandon the plans for Hobøl and continue with a divided solution. Fornebu would be expanded, and all <b>charter</b> <b>traffic</b> be moved to Gardermoen. From 1988, all international traffic would also be moved, making Fornebu a purely domestic airport.|$|E

5|$|The {{agreements}} with Spanish authorities allowed only airlines {{from the country}} of origin or from Spain to fly charter flights. But because of the SAS-cooperation, an agreement was made where any Scandinavian airline could fly to Spain {{from any of the}} three Scandinavian countries. Domestically, Braathens SAFE received strong competition from Sterling Airways, {{but on the other hand}} this allowed Braathens SAFE to fly charter flights from Sweden. In 1968, the large Swedish–Danish charter airline Internord went bankrupt, giving Braathens SAFE increased <b>charter</b> <b>traffic.</b> The company also started purchasing a larger share of Altas Resor, until it took over all the whole company in 1978. In Sweden, Braathens SAFE used its partners to sell charter flights to Norway, and then continue their flights using scheduled flights. Braathens SAFE was hindered by the charter regulations from making intercontinental flights, as well as flights between the Scandinavian capitals. The rules also forced business travelers to use scheduled flights.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{decision}} to sell the two 767s, management also decided to sell the four remaining F-28s. This would allow Braathens to operate a fleet of pure 737-200, giving lower operating costs. One 737 {{was taken out of}} service in 1984, and the four F-28s sold in 1986. The same year, seven more 737-200s were delivered, along with two more in 1987 and 1988. By then, Braathens SAFEs entire fleet consisted of nineteen 737-200s. At the same time, Boeing had launched the 737-300, a slightly larger aircraft with new CFM-56 engines. Braathens SAFE considered the new aircraft, but where concerned that it used a traditional mechanical cockpit. The airline also needed larger aircraft for the <b>charter</b> <b>traffic,</b> and smaller aircraft for the domestic routes. The airline also considered the McDonnell Douglas MD-80 and the Airbus A320, but settled on the 737 following the announcement of the stretched 737-400, with 156 seats, and the shortened 737-500, with 124 seats. These had glass cockpits, and Braathens SAFE would be among the first airlines to receive both models. To finance the purchase, the airline sold all but two of the 737-200s and leased them back. For some of the aircraft, they received more money than they had paid.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, the {{management}} of Braathens SAFE decided that it needed larger aircraft if the company was to stay competitive on charter flights. Larger aircraft could be put into service on the main services from Oslo, Gothenburg and Stockholm, while the 737s {{could be used to}} smaller destination and from other cities. On 25 February 1980, the company announced that it had ordered two Boeing 767-200 planes, with an option for two addition craft. The cost of the two firm orders was about NOK500 million. This would allow the aircraft to be used for both domestic scheduled flights and for charter, and was configured with 242 seats. This was less than charter-only airlines, for instance Britannia had their planes configured with 273 seats. Braathens SAFE's planes were delivered on 23 March and in November 1984. The following year showed increasing <b>charter</b> <b>traffic,</b> although it only made up 25% of the company's revenue. The company had considered the smaller Boeing 757, but did not have sufficient range. Also the Airbus A310 was close to being chosen.|$|E

Air transport movements increased by 0.8% to 27,220. Cargo volume increased by 27.3% to 8,409 metric tonnes. Key to continuing growth in passenger traffic was the increase in long-haul traffic (which in turn drove the increase in cargo traffic). This was driven by additional passengers travelling to and from Hong Kong (+64%), New York (+49.9%) and Tianjin (+28.4%). The increase in short-haul traffic was driven by growth in passenger traffic to and from Paris (+30.7%) and Milan (+3.4%).|$|E

On the other hand, scheduled services generated inadequate revenues, which were insufficient to support the airline. Simultaneous development of new scheduled services and integration of existing regional operations in the Channel Islands and on the Isle of Man with the vehicle ferry network proved a costly distraction for overburdened senior sales and commercial managers, taking up a disproportionate amount of their time. Although revenues and the workforce had doubled between 1962 and 1968, total output had risen by less than half over the same period. This translated into a substantial fall in output per employee within that time span and resulted in a weak trading position.|$|E
500|$|Construction of {{a runway}} {{expansion}} from [...] {{was started in}} 1988, allowing the airport to be served by jet aircraft in international <b>charter</b> <b>traffic.</b> The 15.3 million Norwegian krone (NOK) investment was financed through a municipal and county-guaranteed loan.

Geilo never received such status, unlike the nearby Fagernes Airport, Leirin which opened in 1987. By 1992, the mayors of Hol and Nore og Uvdal, the municipalities who owned the airport, admitted that it had been a mistake to build the airport. There were less than 1,000 passengers annually, and the scheduled traffic with Coast Air cost the municipalities NOK 1 million per year. In addition came the operating deficit of the airport itself.

5|$|A {{site for}} the London {{terminus}} near Waterloo had been suggested by Sir Richard Broun.

The arches of the huge brick viaduct carrying the LSWR into Waterloo Bridge station (now London Waterloo station) were easily converted into mortuaries. Broun also felt that the journey out of London from Waterloo Bridge would be less distressing for mourners: while most of the rail routes out of London ran through tunnels and deep cuttings, or through densely populated areas, at this time the urban development of what is now south London had not taken place and the LSWR route ran almost entirely through parkland and countryside.

5000|$|North Carolina {{for example}} {{established}} a DMV motor vehicle theft investigations unit in 1921 to combat a rising problem with car theft, {{but the state}} realized {{a need for a}} larger, uniformed highway patrol agency to solely enforce traffic laws statewide.

Thus, the NC State Highway Patrol was established on July 1, 1929. Its original command staff was sent to the Pennsylvania State Police Academy for training. Upon completion, these lieutenants and a captain returned to NC and started the SHP with a training camp for new recruits at Camp Glenn, a WW1 abandoned army post in Morehead City. <b>Chartered</b> to enforce <b>traffic</b> laws only, in the early 1930s the NCSHP had added in its charter that it had powers to deal with among other crimes, bank robbery.

40|$|The Mediterranean Sea {{is home to}} over 2 / 3 of the world’s <b>charter</b> boat <b>traffic</b> and hosts an {{estimated}} 1. 5 million recreational boats. Studies elsewhere have demonstrated marinas as important hubs for the stepping-stone transfer of non-indigenous species (NIS), but these unique anthropogenic, and typically artificial habitats have largely gone overlooked in the Mediterranean as sources of NIS hot-spots. From April 2015 to November 2016, 34 marinas were sampled across the following Mediterranean countries: Spain, France, Italy, Malta, Greece, Turkey and Cyprus to investigate the NIS presence and richness in the specialized hard substrate material of these marina habitats. All macroinvertebrate taxa were collected and identified. Additionally, fouling samples were collected from approximately 600 boat-hulls from 25 of these marinas to determine if boats host diverse NIS not present in the marina. Here, we present data revealing that Mediterranean marinas indeed act as major hubs for the transfer of marine NIS, and we also provide evidence that recreational boats act as effective vectors of spread. From this wide-ranging geographical study, we report here numerous new NIS records at the basin, subregional, country and locality level. At the basin level, we report three NIS new to the Mediterranean Sea (Achelia sawayai sensu lato, Aorides longimerus, Cymodoce aff. fuscina), and the re-appearance of two NIS previously known but currently considered extinct in the Mediterranean (Bemlos leptocheirus, Saccostrea glomerata). We also compellingly update the distributions of many NIS in the Mediterranean Sea showing some recent spreading; we provide details for 11 new subregional records for NIS (Watersipora arcuata, Hydroides brachyacantha sensu lato and Saccostrea glomerata now present in the Western Mediterranean; Symplegma brakenhielmi, Stenothoe georgiana, Spirobranchus tertaceros sensu lato, Dendostrea folium sensu lato and Parasmittina egyptiaca now present in the Central Mediterranean, and W. arcuata, Bemlos leptocheirus and Dyspanopeus sayi in the Eastern Mediterranean). We also report 51 new NIS country records from recreational marinas: 12 for Malta, 10 for Cyprus, nine for Greece, six for Spain and France, five for Turkey and three for Italy, representing 32 species. Finally, we report 20 new NIS records (representing 17 species) found on recreational boat-hulls (mobile habitats), not yet found in the same marina, or in most cases, even the country. For each new NIS record, their native origin and global and Mediterranean distributions are provided, along with details of the new record. Additionally, taxonomic characters used for identification and photos of the specimens are also provided.

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityInevitably, {{government}} is reaching {{more and more}} into fields of industry, human relations, and social welfare. The trend toward centralization is all too obvious to many of our citizens. It seems that the states were adequately {{equipped to deal with}} the nation's economic and social problems of the nineteenth century, but they have not proved themselves adequate to deal with many of those same problems of the twentieth century. Many people seem to forget that to a large degree this growth of the Federal government has been due to the inability of the states to handle their problems to and to cooperate among themselves. So it is evident that we must pursue the remedy of interstate cooperation in order to revive our "drooping" federalism and to preserve the sovereign rights of the States. The writer's basic assumption is that "federalism" is still alive and that the sovereignty of the States is no mere fiction. Furthermore, he assumes that interstate cooperation and uniform state action can revive and save "federalism. " The present work represents an attempt to survey the scope and to analyze the significance and possibilities of interstate relations as pertaining to New England with particular emphasis on Massachusetts. It is an attempt to show briefly the nature and accomplishments of such cooperative relations and reciprocal agreements as have come to exist at the present time. The thesis and problem then, is to discover how interstate cooperation and uniform policies can be achieved in New England, to find out what has and is being done in this field, and then, to evaluate the good and bad points. The methods used to gather this material were the historical research and the interview methods for the most part, although some statistical studies were included. The greater part of the material was obtained from the Massachusetts State House Law Library, the Kirsten Better Business Library, and the Massachusetts Commission on Interstate Cooperation. The need for legislative uniformity and cooperation in New England was found to be very great. First, the lack of uniform laws pertaining to insurance, marriage and divorce, the issuance of corporate <b>charters,</b> <b>traffic</b> control, public health, aviation, as well as many other subjects, as found to be all too obvious. Second, there are matters that are of common concern to all the New England states, such as river pollution control, flood control, forest fire prevention, etc If the states can solve these problems by themselves, {{it seems as if the}} Federal government would be less likely to step in, consequently, the move toward centralization might be checked. It was found that use of the interstate compact as an instrument to facilitate joint action between two or more states in New England has been used very sparingly. One of the most important agencies of interstate cooperation now at work in New England is the interstate cooperation commission. Each of the six states has a commission, Massachusetts being the first to establish one in 1937. Their functions are to advance cooperation between the states by formulating proposals for and by facilitating the adoption of interstate compacts, the enactment of uniform or reciprocal legislation, and the adoption of uniform or reciprocal administrative rules and regulations. The achievements of the commissions are impressive. New England states now have general uniform motor laws, flood control compacts are in the process of being enacted, a forest fire compact has just recently been passed, and many other subjects have been solved through the efforts of the commissions. Several administrative organizations were found to be contributing to better cooperation between the states. The New England Governors' Conference is one of the foremost in this group. At these conferences many recommendations have been made which have later led to more uniform administrative policies. The now defunct New England Regional Planning Commission and the Joint Railroad Committee were organizations that could have been very helpful at the present time. A very important unofficial organization working to provide the region's agencies of business and government with the stimulus and the means for working together in a cooperative manner on common problems is the New England Council. A brief summary of its main activities reveals that the council maintains contact with the governors and frequently takes up matters with them. At least once a year it brings the governors together in an annual conference to discuss methods of perfecting and coordinating the economic growth of the entire area. The council maintains executive offices with a staff who carry on work in such fields as agriculture, industry, recreational development, publicity, research, etc. The Council's efforts are largely stimulative. The Council has promoted uniformity in agricultural administration, in motor vehicle regulation, and in many other fields. Through its publicity activities it has tried to acquaint New England with the Council's work in order to promote cooperation. The Council's Committees on aviation, atomic energy, community development, industry, etc., have made important contributions to the coordinated growth of New England. Despite the Council's good work, it does have a rather glaring weakness since it seems to voice the opinion of big business in general, and does not adequately represent the small businessman or the consumer. Of all the organizations working for interstate cooperation and uniform laws in New England, the interstate cooperation commissions appear to be doing the most effective work. The New England Council and the Governors' Conferences are also doing fine work, but too often it is with very little action. Thus, it seems most imperative that the New England states continue to develop, aid, and strengthen these commissions by giving them more funds, technical assistance, etc. Finally, the writer would like to propose his own program for achieving uniform laws and cooperation between the New England states. First, it wou 1 d seem both possible and desirable for the six states to form a regional assembly of state administrative officers. These would include executive officers from various leading industries in New England, from the state government offices, and also some of the heads of the colleges. From these men with their wide experience, it should be possible to form a representative assembly which can study the existing situation in the region, evaluate methods, and devise ways and means of furthering interstate cooperation in New England. It would have a permanent secretariat such as the United Nations has, to handle various specialized tasks. Second, the effort must be made to stimulate interest and enthusiasm in the idea of cooperation and uniformity among those who have the power to act, namely, public officials, both legislators and administrators. Third, an educational program in the interests of uniformity and cooperative state action in New England must be unaugurated. The states all have funds which are used for propaganda activities and these could be used in a campaign to enlighten the young people, the white collar worker, and the ordinary laborer, of the seriousness of the move toward centralization. Fourth, and to the writer the most important method that the states should rely on to achieve cooperation, is the use of the interstate compact. The compact offers a way of constructive cooperation. It is binding, it provides for joint action, it need not be merely a legislative declaration; it may extend to any form of activity, executive, administrative, judicial, as well as legislative; and an interstate compact may be permanent, it cannot be brushed lightly aside. The compact could be utilized in many fields in New England, such as labor, penal problems, flood control, irrigation projects, conservation, etc. In whatever fields compacts are used, the complexities arising between subjects and between regions require a systematic approach. There must be a plan to prevent the hurried negotiation of emergency compacts made without reference to a coordinated program, since this would result in very unfortunate perceived legislative action. The regional assembly suggested by the writer offers one instrument for the coordination of compact programs as do the interstate commissions on cooperation. The accomplishments to date have been limited because we have not sensed fully the significance of the problem, and because we have not organized ourselves effectively to solve it. The policy of drift has failed. It is time to take stock of our needs, gather our resources, and proceed toward a more satisfactory solution. If we do not do this, we have only ourselves to blame if as many people fear, the states are ultimately reduced to mere administrative units in a vast centralized machine...|$|R
