50|$|The {{subthalamic nucleus}} {{is a small}} lens-shaped nucleus in the brain where it is, from a {{functional}} point of view, part of the basal ganglia system. In terms of anatomy, it is the {{major part of the}} subthalamus. As suggested by its name, the subthalamic nucleus is located ventral to the thalamus. It is also dorsal to the substantia nigra and medial to the internal capsule. It was first described by Jules Bernard Luys in 1865, and the term <b>corpus</b> <b>Luysi</b> or Luys' body is still sometimes used.|$|E
40|$|The Author {{researched}} the Conduction Pathways of Epileptic Convulsion on dogs by Marchi method. The results were as follows: 1. The descending fibers from the areas 4 a, b of the cerebral cortex reach the homolateral lentiform nucleus and other neurons reach the lateral and ventral nuclei of the homolateral thalamus. The neurons moreover reach {{in the head}} and tail of the homolateral caudate nucleus. 2. The caudate nucleus and the lenticular nucleus are connected closely with the numerous fiber bundles crossing the internal capsule. 3. The fibers from the lenticular nuculeus descend through the lenticular fasciculus and Ansa lenticularis and reach the homolateral substantia nigra. The other neurons connect with <b>Corpus</b> <b>Luysi,</b> nucleus ruber, Cajal's interstitial nucleus, Darkschewitsch's nucleus, Westphal-Edinger's nucleus, oculomotor nucleus, and superior colliculus. 4. The descending fibers from the substantia nigra reaching the homolateral pyramis, fascicullus praedorsalis, fibrae arcuatae lateralis, nucleus funiculi lateralis are recognized. These fibers pass the Decussatio pyramidum, run down in the Funiculus lateral and reach the nucleus anterior spinalis. 5. The ascending fibers from the cerebellar cortex (lobus lunatus anterior, lobus lunatus inferior, lobus semilunaris superior, lobus semilunaris inferior) reach the dentate nucleus and pass through the brachium conjunctivum to reach the contralateral ventral nucleus of the thalamus and then connect with the descending pathways from the cerebral cortex. 6. The communication between both cerebellar hemispheres and thalami are revealed...|$|E
40|$|Globus pallidus, putamen and the {{adjacent}} part of internal capsule, head of caudate nucleus and lateral part of thalamus were surgically destroyed in cats, and degeneration of nerve fibres {{was seen in}} the internal capsule, cerebral peduncle, thalamus, espcially lamina medullaris externa, stratum reticulatum thalami, ansa lenticularis, pedunculus thalami inferior, <b>corpus</b> <b>Luysi,</b> Darkschewitsch' nucleus, Cajal' interstitial nucleus, radiatio tegmenti, brachium colliculi caudalis, Forel' and Meynert' decussation, bilateral red nuclei, tractus tegmenti medialis, fasciculus praedorsalis, substantia nigra, lemniscus medialis, stratum fibrosum pontis etc. Eleven parts were selected for investigation among these parts of degeneration, i. e. capsula interna (or pes pedunculus cerebri), lamina medullaris externa, pedunculus thalami inferior, stratum reticulatum thalami, rediatio tegmenti, nucleus ruber minocellularis, nucleus ruber magnocellularis, lemniscus medialis, brachium colliculi caudalis, substantia nigra, and stratum fibrosum pontis and the diameter of the nerve fibres of these selected parts was measured. Most of the fibres are thicker and the mean diameter of these parts are ranged in the following order from the thicker to the thinner: capsula interna (or pes pedunculus cerebri), nucleus ruber magenocellularis, lemniscus medialis, brachium colliculi caudalis, lamina medullaris externa, nucleus ruber minocellularis, stratum fibrosum pontis, pedunculus thalami inferior, radiatio tegmenti, stratum reticulatum thalami and substantia nigra. The extrapyramidal nerve fibres are mostly thinner than the pyramidal ones in these parts. When the thickness of the nerve fibre of the peripheral and spinal nerves reported in literature, the peripheral nerve fibres are the thickest and those in the brain are the thinnest and a marked difference between them is oberserved...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} know the {{mechanisms}} of tolerance to the depressor actions of hypotensive agents, Hexamethonium chloride (C_ 6), Regitine hydrochloride (Rg.) and Apresoline hydrochloride (Ap.), the present author has investigated changes in the response of blood pressure to various drugs by means of both direct and indirect measurements of blood pressure and moreover changes in {{the diameter of the}} central artery of the ear, pupil and blood histamine content in addition to histopathological changes in rabbits which were made tolerant to the depressor actions by the repeated administration of the agents. The results thus obtained were as follows: 1. The hypotensive effects of C_ 6, Rg. or Ap. decreased and finally became pressor following the daily intravenous injection of constant doses respectively {{for a long time to}} normal rabbits. Thus, tolerance was demonstrated for their depressor effects in the normotensive animals. 2. C_ 6 -, Rg. - or Ap. -tolerant rabbits showed cross-tolerance to several different hypotensive drugs. In the animals, these drugs exerted, on the contrary, pressor effects. 3. Blood pressure in C_ 6 -, Rg. - or Ap. -tolerant rabbits was raised much more sensitively with Adt enaline; Noradrenaline, Privina, Atropine, Acetylcholine, Nicotine, Strychnine, Atonine, Barium chloride, various kinds of antihistaminic drugs, 2987 R. P. and Chlorpromazine than that in normal rabbits. Such blood pressure rises were strikingly inhibited with Phenobarbital but were not affected with Urethane. 4. In the rabbits that had become tolerant to the depressor action of C_ 6, Rg. or Ap., the peripheral vasodilating action of the agents decreased and the relaxing effect of Sodium nitrite on the smooth muscles in vascular wall diminished. 5. In the rabbits that had received C_ 6 or Rg. repeatedly, tolerance to their mydriatic action developed. When Ap. was given repeatedly, tolerance to its miotic action developed. 6. In the rabbits that had been given C_ 6 repeatedly, no tolerance was demonstrated for the action of C_ 6, which was of interference with pupillary light reaction. 7. There was no great difference in the blood histamine content between C_ 6 -, Rg. - or Ap. -tolerant and nontolerant rabbits. 8. Histopathological researches on the C_ 6 -, Rg. - or Ap. -tolerant rabbits revealed distinct changes in the places which seemed to be the sites of action of the agents; in sympathetic ganglia for the C_ 6 -tolerant rabbits, in the medullary cells of the adrenal glands for the Rg. -tolerant rabbits and in vascular wall for the Ap. -tolerant rabbits. And moreover the researches revealed findings from which an increased function in nerve cells in the hypothalamus, especially in the <b>corpus</b> subthalamicum <b>Luysi</b> was supposed. 9. The development of tolerance to the hypotensive actions of C_ 6, Rg. or Ap. is due to compensatory hypersensitivities in the adrenergic effector cells, vasomotor centrum and smooth muscles in vascular wall, which cause easily rise in blood pressure. Moreover, the diencephalon plays an important role in the phenomenon...|$|R
