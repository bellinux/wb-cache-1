40|$|Abstract — Perceived <b>conversational</b> speech <b>quality</b> {{is a key}} {{quality of}} service (QoS) metric for voice over IP (VoIP) applications. Speech quality is mainly {{affected}} by network impairments, such as delay, jitter and packet loss. Playout buffer algorithms are used to compensate for jitter, based on a tradeoff between delay and loss, but can {{have a significant effect}} on perceived quality. The main aim in this paper is to assess how buffer algorithms affect perceived speech quality and how to choose the best algorithm and its parameters to obtain optimum perceived speech quality (in terms of an objective Mean Opinion Score). The contributions of the paper are three-fold. First, we introduce a new methodology for predicting <b>conversational</b> speech <b>quality</b> (<b>conversational</b> Mean Opinion Score or MOSc) which combines the latest ITU-T speech quality measurement algorithm (PESQ) and the concepts of the E-model. Second, we assess different playout buffer algorithms using the new MOSc metric on Internet trace data. Our findings indicate that, in general, end-to-end delay has a major effect on the selection of a buffer algorithm and its parameters. For small end-to-end delays, an algorithm that seeks to minimise loss is preferred, whereas for large end-to-end delays, an algorithm that aims at a minimum buffer delay is best. Third, we propose a modified buffer algorithm together with an adaptive parameter adjustment scheme. Preliminary results show that this can achieve an “optimum ” perceived speech quality for all the traces considered. The results are based on Internet trace data measurement...|$|R

Our limited subjective tests show that we can improve the perceptual quality when the network connections are lossy and have large delay disparities. Because it is impossible to conduct subjective tests under all possible conditions, we have developed a classifier that learns to select the best equalization algorithm using learning examples derived from subjective tests under limited network and conversational conditions.

40|$|The <b>conversational</b> <b>quality</b> of a VoIP {{communication}} {{is dependent on}} several {{factors such as the}} coding process used, the network conditions and the type of error cor-rection or concealment employed.

Assessing this kind of {{communication is}} a very difficult problem, and most of the studies avail-able in the literature simplify the issue by restricting the analysis to only one or two parameters. However, the number of potentially affecting factors is typically higher, and their joint effect on quality is complex.

The current Internet is unreliable, and it degrades the <b>conversational</b> <b>quality</b> of real-time multi-party conferencing. Delay disparities may cause unbalanced silence periods, and losses and jitters may affect the intelligibility of speech segments received. We collect real Internet traces from the PlanetLab and classify them into different categories according to the traffic behavior. After studying the conversational dynamics in the multi-party system, we identify user-observable metrics that affect the perception of <b>conversational</b> <b>quality</b> and study their trade-offs. Based on the dynamics and the Internet traces, we design the transmission topology to reduce delay variations and to avoid links with high losses and jitters.

40|$|Abstract—Over the years, {{the quality}} in Voice over IP (VoIP) {{applications}} {{has been defined}} {{from the perspective of}} VoIP service providers but not necessarily from the perspective of end-users. <b>Conversational</b> <b>quality</b> as perceived by end-users is affected by a wide variety of factors that are not exclusive to network performance. While service providers focus their efforts on Quality of Service (QoS) in VoIP, end-users expect improvement in Quality of Experience (QoE). The measurement of QoE is significantly challenging due to the diverse nature of factors that collectively determine QoE. It is highly desired to have a more comprehensive and accurate quality measurement model that can provide objective measurement of QoS in real-time while simultaneously offering QoE measurement as well. Thus, unveiling the relevance of various factors in a quality measurement model is crucial. In this paper, we study a commonly used ITU-T recommended quality measurement model: the E-model with a focus on how an important but ignored parameter jitter playout buffer affects the measurement accuracy by conducting an analytical and experimental approach. Our study shows that adaptive jitter playout buffering does affect the measurement of end user perceived VoIP quality. Thus, the E-Model that excludes the impact of the dynamic jitter playout buffer cannot provide accurate measurement on how an user perceives <b>conversational</b> <b>quality</b> in VoIP application...|$|E

The success of this conversational video service will depend on the <b>conversational</b> video <b>quality</b> achieved in the multicell wireless indoor scenarios.

This paper analyzes the handover decision based on the probability calculation of handover events in the case of relative signal strength with hysteresis threshold (RSSHT) approach, and it proposes a new handover decision mechanism, variable hysteresis, to avoid unnecessary handovers. The paper presents the impact of the number of handovers and their duration time on the video's effective frame rate. Moreover, the effect of video stream modification during a short handover is also analyzed. Probability and handover duration approaches are combined and a new simple method for video quality evaluation is caused by the handovers in multicell indoor WLAN scenarios.

This study focuses in particular {{on the use of}} language and the role that other communicative modes play in Web 2. 0 -mediated interactions and the possible implications they might have on brand-consumer power relations. This thesis adopts a critical inter-disciplinary approach, and is designed to inform the emerging field of digital commercial communications. More specifically, by applying social and cultural theories of new media with the social Web, this study sets out to contribute to emerging literature and debates on the socio-economic implications of Web 2. 0 communications in the context of advertising. Critical theories of advertising and new media have been utilised to shape a framework for analysing communications in collaborative and often interactive digital advertising settings. This, and a body of primary research through first-hand interviews, plus analysis of exemplar of Web 2. 0 -mediated brand-consumer communications, enables me to consider more broadly the ways in which capitalism has been repositioned within the new digital environment. To achieve this, this study has appropriated two research methods in it’s handling of primary evidence. The first part of analysis appraises eight semi-structured interviews I conducted with digital strategy makers and ‘brand ambassadors’ working within the contemporary international advertising industry, acting on behalf of multinational brands. The second part analyses the content of brand-consumer communications within Web 2. 0 platforms, notably Twitter, through four different sectors spanning service, product and cause sectors. Cases are of Starbucks Coffee (fast moving consumer goods), Dell Computers (IT sector), Burberry (luxury fashion) and Yes Scotland (a political cause). The overarching aim is to assess product or service-driven digital advertising strategies that have most effectively exploited (or best lend themselves to) social Web platforms to leverage their ideology and generate social supports. The results of my analysis suggest that although Web 2. 0 -mediated communications between brands and consumers exhibit some characteristics of participatory culture, the actual nature of the <b>conversational</b> <b>qualities</b> and the types of interaction spans a much wider spectrum.
