40|$|SUMMARY. TWO {{different}} spinels, {{analyses of}} which are given, occur in the layered ultramafic rocks at Dawros. <b>Chrome</b> <b>spinel</b> occurs both as gravity-stratified cumulates and a complex orbs, while an Al-rich spinel isboth in rocks of the main Dawros magmatic sequence and in an ssociation with an aluminous bronzite, which mayoriginate by recrystallization. It is concluded that while the <b>chrome</b> <b>spinel</b> is certainly of magmatic origin, the aluminous spinel is probably partly of magmatic and partly of reerystallization origin. Two markedly different spinels occur in the Dawros intrusion (Rothstein, r 957, I 958) of western Ireland (53 ~ 33 ' 50 " N, 9 ~ 58 ' o " W). The first, a chrome-rich variety, occurs principally in a cumulate of olivine (now altered to serpentine) and <b>chrome</b> <b>spinel,</b> associated with Ca-poor and Ca-rich pyroxenes; this spinel is an accessory mineral in many Dawros ultramafic rocks. The second spinel is mainly light green, aluminous, and occurs either with olivine plus diopsidic pyroxene or with aluminous bronzite. The <b>chrome</b> <b>spinel</b> occurs in cumulates with pronounced gravity stratification, wedge bedding, and evidence of rhythmic precipitation (Rothstein, I 957), with, in one newly described outcrop, a layer of chromite with a complex orbicular texture, consistin...|$|E
40|$|The Murray Basin {{region of}} southeastern Australia {{represents}} {{the remains of}} a shallow inland sea and contains heavy mineral sand placer deposits typically comprising the primary economic minerals ilmenite (FeTiO 3), altered ilmenite, rutile (TiO 2), and zircon (ZrSiO 4). Rutile and zircon are easily separable from the bulk heavy mineral concentrate and are currently extracted from deposits. The ilmenite component remains largely unexploited due to its wide spectrum of chemical alteration (making a clean separation difficult) and the presence of impurity mineral grains; mainly, <b>chrome</b> <b>spinel</b> (general formula AB 2 O 4; A 2 + = divalent cation e. g. Fe, Mg, Mn; B 3 + = trivalent cation e. g. Cr, Al, Fe 3 +). The presence of even a minor amount of chromia (Cr 2 O 3 < 0. 05 %) in the ilmenite product downgrades its market value. While magnetic separation is usually an effective method to achieve a clean separation between ilmenite and <b>chrome</b> <b>spinel,</b> this procedure is not effective for the Murray Basin material as there is a considerable overlap in the magnetic susceptibility properties of both mineral phases [1]. Pownceby et al. [2] recently suggested a potential method for separating chrome spinels from ilmenite which involved changing the physical properties of the individual <b>chrome</b> <b>spinel</b> grains through a sulphidising roast treatment. The aim of the current work is to analyse the sulfidation treatment of <b>chrome</b> <b>spinel</b> as a new route for <b>chrome</b> <b>spinel</b> removal from the Murray Basin ilmenite concentrates. This study comprises two phases of investigation: (1) a systematic thermodynamic assessment of equilibrium reactions in the Fe-Cr-Ti-O-S system to evaluate the effect of composition, temperature, and partial pressures of sulfur and oxygen, and, (2) selected experimental investigations using natural ilmenite and chromite samples to test the findings from the thermodynamic calculations...|$|E

Its geology, the massive sulfide deposits and the paleomagnetism are treated in special publi-cations (Güner, in press). The present paper reports work done on <b>chrome</b> <b>spinels</b> and ore minerals from the Küre rocks. Spinels, in which chromium is a major component, occur in peridotite, serpen-tinite, and metasomatites. Geologically, they play an important part as a connecting link between the Küre basaltoids and their alteration products (Güner, in press).

40|$|Models {{that support}} a single {{collision}} scenario for India and Eurasia are {{incompatible with the}} evidence that an intra-oceanic island arc (IOIA) existed within the Neotethyan Ocean. Understanding the spatial and temporal extent of any IOIA is crucial for India-Eurasia collision studies as the entire ocean, including any intra-oceanic features, must have been consumed or emplaced prior to continental collision. Here, we review {{what is known about}} the Neotethyan IOIA and report evidence from sedimentary successions in NW India and southern Tibet to constrain when and where it was emplaced. We use detrital mineral geochemistry and supporting provenance and age data to identify the source of the sediments and compare the timing of erosion of IOIA-derived material in both regions. Detrital <b>chrome</b> <b>spinels,</b> extracted from distinct sedimentary horizons in southern Tibet (Sangdanlin) and NW India (Ladakh), exhibit similar average geochemical values (TiO =  0. 09 and 0. 24 %, Cr# =  0. 66 and 0. 68 and Mg# =  0. 45 and 0. 53, respectively) and supra-subduction zone (SSZ), forearc peridotite signatures. Furthermore, they overlap with in-situ <b>chrome</b> <b>spinels</b> reported from the Spongtang Ophiolite in NW India and the Sangsang Ophiolite in southern Tibet. As with many of the ophiolitic remnants that crop out in and adjacent to the Yarlung-Tsangpo and Indus suture zones (YTSZ and ISZ respectively), the Spongtang and Sangsang ophiolites formed in an IOIA setting. Linking the source of the detrital <b>chrome</b> <b>spinels</b> to those analysed from remnant IOIA massifs in the YTSZ and ISZ is strong evidence for the emplacement of the IOIA onto the Indian margin. The timing of the IOIA collision with India is constrained by the depositional ages of the chrome spinel-bearing sediments {{to the end of the}} Paleocene (Thanetian) in southern Tibet and the Early Eocene in NW India. This indirectly provides a maximum age constraint of Late Paleocene-Early Eocene for intercontinental collision between India and Eurasia. Additionally, this study highlights the importance of targeting distinct sedimentary horizons in collision zones to find evidence for discrete tectonic events that may be obfuscated by later collisions...|$|R

40|$|With {{high-grade}} ilmenite (FeTiO 3) ores becoming scarce, {{there is}} a need to process lower-grade and more weathered ilmenite ores. These alternative sources provide complexities in terms of physical characteristics, mineral compositions, and impurity levels, all of which can significantly affect the subsequent processing route. In the production of high purity white pigment from ilmenite, chromia (Cr 2 O 3) -containing impurities such as chrome-rich spinets need to be removed from the ilmenite concentrates down to commercially accepted levels. Existing magnetising roast processes currently used in the industry do not allow a clean separation of the chrome-rich spinets from the ilmenite due to overlapping physical properties. It has been suggested that selective sulfidation of chrome-rich spinels could be a potential route for chromia separation from ilmenite. However, the detailed conditions under which the selective sulfidation can occur are not well known. This work focuses on a systematic study of selective sulfidation of chromite FeCr 2 O 4 (one end member of the spinel series) for the purpose of chromia impurity removal from a weathered ilmenite concentrate. Detailed thermodynamic assessment and experimental studies have been carried out to determine the conditions at which selective <b>chrome</b> <b>spinel</b> sulfidation occurs. The results suggest that there are two regimes (Area- 1 and Area- 2) where selective <b>chrome</b> <b>spinel</b> sulfidation is possible. Area- 1 is in the range of pO(2) approximate to 2. 37 x 10 (- 09) atm to 5. 01 x 10 (- 15) atm, while Area- 2 is at lower pO(2) (<= 6. 92 x 10 (- 19) atm) and pS(2) (<= 1 x 10 (- 06) atm) region relative to Area- 1. Targeted experimental analyses of the two regimes revealed that selective sulfidation of <b>chrome</b> <b>spinel</b> occur only under the reaction conditions at Area- 2. It is suggested that the lack of selective <b>chrome</b> <b>spinel</b> sulfidation under Area- 1 conditions is the change in activity of iron (a(Fe)) due to weathering action on chrome spinet grain...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. The ultramafic-hosted disseminated nickel {{sulphide}} deposit at Mount Keith, Western Australia, originally consisted of sulphide droplets and <b>chrome</b> <b>spinels</b> interstitial toolivine.

40|$|This article {{presents}} the results of structural, petrographic, mineralogical and chemical studies of dunite veinlets in spinel peridotite from the Kraka ophiolites. It is demonstrated that plastic deformation of polycrystalline olivine, which form dunite, was accompanied by precipitation of impurities (aluminum and chrome) as newly formed chrome spinels. The thinnest acicular inclusions of 0. 3 - 0. 5 micron thick are aligned in olivine grains along [010] axis. Bigger elongated irregular <b>chrome</b> <b>spinel</b> grains usually occur along grain and sub-grain olivine boundaries, and, occasionally, inside the grains along [100] axis. Alteration from the fine xenomorphic grains of chrome spinels to the bigger idiomorphic crystals was observed. Analogically to dynamic ageing (dispersion hardening) in metals, the structural and chemical alterations in dunites are interpreted as deformation induced segregation of impurities. It is suggested that the euhedral <b>chrome</b> <b>spinel</b> grains typical for ophiolitic dunites were formed by coalescence and spheroidization.

40|$|This study {{provides}} {{an assessment of}} the high temperature thermochemical reactions of ilmenite and chromite with sulphur and uses the information to analyse the possibility of selective sulphidation of chrome-bearing spinels as a new route for chromite removal from ilmenite concentrates. The work includes both systematic thermodynamic assessment and targeted experimental investigations. Thermodynamic calculation results studying the effect of reactants composition, temperature and different sulphur sources (H 2 S and elemental S) showed that chromite can be selectively sulphidised at a controlled atmosphere of partial pressure of oxygen (pO 2) below 10 &# 8722; 10 atm and partial pressure of sulphur (pS 2) above 10 &# 8722; 6 atm. The addition of carbon with sulphur was found to be useful for the chromite sulphidation reaction. The optimum quantity of sulphur reactant to carbon was found to be 3 : 1 (in mole) for 1 mol of chromite. Sulphidation experiments on a mixture of natural ilmenite and chromite at 1100 &# 0176;C for 5 h using 5 %H 2 S as a sulphur source showed that the ilmenite was preferentially sulphidised first, which was also in a good agreement with the thermodynamic assessment.

40|$|Graduation date: 1972 Heavy {{minerals}} {{can contain}} potentially economic amounts of metals as both matrix and trace constituents. Such minerals appear as unconsolidated black sands on the continental shelf off southwest Oregon {{and along the}} Oregon coast. Two diverse energies are considered in this investigation. Environmental energy of the depositional regimen, Part I; energy involved in crystallization of transition metals from a magma, Part III. In Part II, an analytical scheme {{for the evaluation of}} opaque oxides is proposed, and an examination of the results as applied to two samples is presented. Part I The unconsolidated black sands on the Oregon continental margin have been profoundly affected by tectonic uplift aid by cyclic erosive transgression and regression. Progressive enrichment in heavy minerals from the Klamath Mountains has apparently occurred during each glacio-eustatic regression of the Pleistocene seas, each regression a period of intensified erosion and sediment transport. Subsequent erosive transgressions selectively sort and redistribute these heavy minerals into paralic beach and nearshore deposits. Uplift of the coast and shelf implies that the heavy minerals were reworked during the Holocene transgression into concentrations of greater extent and higher ore tenor than relict deposits of earlier transgressions in upraised Pleistocene terraces. Extrapolation of ore reserve values from the terraces by "Mirror Image" concepts might seriously underestimate the potential of offshore deposits. Offshore heavy mineral concentrations should be coincident with observed submarine terraces. Part II An analytic scheme was developed to investigate opaque oxides in two samples; one from the Pleistocene terraces; the other from near the present shelf edge. Analyses involving X-ray diffraction techniques, atomic absorption and neutron activation established the mineralogy and elemental distribution in magnetically separated diagnostic splits. <b>Chrome</b> <b>spinel,</b> ilmenite and magnetite comprise the opaque oxide fraction in both samples. Correlation studies of these analyses suggest: (1) Chromium is a matrix metal of <b>chrome</b> <b>spinel</b> and is diadochic into magnetite. (2) Iron appears in all opaque oxides and in increasing amounts with increasing magnetic susceptibility. (3) Titanium is a matrix metal in ilmenite, and diadochic into <b>chrome</b> <b>spinel</b> and magnetite. (4) Nickel and ruthenium are diadochic into and correlated to the spinel structure; i. e. to <b>chrome</b> <b>spinel</b> and magnetite. (5) Osmium appears to be correlated to chromium. (6) Zinc is limited to spinel in these samples. Part III Goldschmidt's and Ringwood's criteria for diadochy often fail to explain the distribution of the transition metals because crystal field effects are not considered. Favored d[superscript n] configurations, e. g. octahedrally coordinated, low spin d⁶ cations in the spinel minerals, result in shortened interatomic distance and significantly strengthened cation-ligand bonds, possibly affecting the distribution of such metal cations. The octahedral site preference energy parameter (OSPE) has been used to explain distributional behavior of the first (3 d) transition series metals. OSPE calculations for four low spin d⁶ cations - Co(III), Ru(II), Rh(III), and Pt(IV) - give significantly high values for this parameter. High OSPE valued transition metal cations possibly form stable proto-mineral oxide complexes in the magma which persist through crystallization. These associations predetermine the enrichment of transition metals in oxide minerals and act as nuclei during cooling and solidification. Subduction of oxidized and hydrolyzed near-surface rocks down a Benioff zone provides progressively higher Eh in the magma, a variety of cation oxidation states, and water for sepentinization of ultramafic rocks. The distribution of the platinum metals in a strongly reducing magma environment should be different than in the oxidizing magma proposed for the Klamath ultramafics. The OSPE parameter offers an explanation for the observed distribution of platinum group metals in spinel minerals from this investigation, in chromites from Uralian dunitic massifs and the Stillwater complex; and of iridium from the Great Lake Doleritic Sheet, Tasmania. <b>Chrome</b> <b>spinel</b> from Oregon had twice the concentration of ruthenium, and one-third the amount of osmium as similar Uralian chromite deposits.

Chromespinels from the Indo-Myanmar ophiolite belt occurring {{in the form of}} podiform chromitites associated with the mantle sequence and associated volcanic rocks are studied to characterise their geochemical composition. We have measured major and trace element concentrations of the chrome-spinels. Cr/(Cr+Al) (Cr#) and Mg/(Mg+Fe²⁺) (Mg#) range from 66 to 70 and 66 to 69 respectively in the chromitite and 47 to 56 and 67 to 70 in volcanic spinel. The computed crystallization conditions show that the studied samples crystallized in an upper mantle environment. Using the <b>chrome</b> <b>spinel</b> compositions, parental magma for the chromitite rock is calculated as boninite, and a MORB for the volcanic sample. Minor and trace element (Ga, Ni, Zn, Co, Mn, V, Sc) concentrations in the analysed spinels are comparable to other podiform chromitites hosted in the mantle section of the ophiolite complexes. Chrome-spinel compositions of the two rocks are used to recognize the probable crystallization condition and nature of the parental magma. 8 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Resolution of the petrotectonic history f Blue Ridge ophiolites of the Southern Appalachian Orogen has {{remained}} enigmatic because of metamorphism and tectonic fragmentation f ultramafic bodies. Understanding of this history is confounded {{by the presence}} of five partial metamorphic overprints and by similar Ti enrichments in spinels from Blue Ridge and modem mid-ocean ridge basalt ultramafic rocks that result from different processes. <b>Chrome</b> <b>spinels</b> from oceanic ultramafic lithosphere show increases in Ti caused by metasomatism induced by passing mafic melts, which create both dunite melt channels within harzburgite wall rocks and associated troctolite impregnation zones. In the Blue Ridge Belt, the oldest metadunite mineral association generally lacks high-Ti spinel, whereas the higher Ti spinels are relatively low in A 1 and Mg and occur in three amphibolite- to greenschist-facies retrograde metamorphic associations that occur in deformed, metasomatized ultramafic bodies with high aspect ratios. Some spinel compositions in the oldest mineral association are similar to those from arc-suprasubduction zone ultramafic lithosphere. Together, available data are consistent with the hypothesis that: (1) the Blue Ridge ophiolites are fragmented, metamor-phosed, very slow-spreading ridge, Xigaze-type ophiolites, consisting of mafic rocks, mino...|$|R

The fine-grained olivine pyroxenite at the sill margins con-sists of elongate, skeletal titanaugite crystals (up to 3 mm long), which are continuously zoned, subhedral, skeletal olivine microphenocrysts (up to o' 8 mm diameter; FoBs), and euhedral <b>chrome</b> <b>spinels</b> (~- ~ o'o 5 mm diameter; 2 + z+ 9 Mg 0. 62 Fe 0. 41 Cq. 17 A 10. ~ 3 Fe 0. 04 T 10. o 30 ~).

The Jinchuan i trusion contains Mg-poor chromites with widely varying TiO 2 contents, howing many fea-tures that are typical of chromites innormal tholeiitic layered intrusions. Wide compositional v riance occurs on the scale of single thin sections, and is attributed to reaction between cumulus chromite and trapped inter-cumulus liquid. This process operated extensively, even on grains that were armored by cumulus olivine crys-tals. Different reaction paths correlate with the abundance ofsulfides in the rock. The unmineralized intrusions show similar eaction trends, but are offset from the Jinchuan trends. Yejili spinels are generally higher in A 1 and Ga, while Zangbutai chromites are systematically higher in Fe 3 +. Jinchuan spinel-olivine pairs record equilibration temperatures well below the solidus, and are slightly but significantly lower than blocking temperatures recorded at Yejili.

40|$|Glass, Billy P. Martin, Ronald E. There {{is minimal}} {{physical}} evidence {{in only a}} few of the ??? 17 Precambrian spherule layers to support an impact origin. A search was done for shock-metamorphosed grains in the following spherule layers: Carawine, Jeerinah, and Bee Gorge (formerly Wittenoom) in Western Australia, Monteville in South Africa, and Gr??nses?? in South-West Greenland. Samples went through acid digestion, and the residues were wet sieved. The 63 - 125 ??m (?? 125 - 250 ??m) size fractions went through heavy liquid separation. For most samples, the heavy mineral assemblages consist predominantly of anatase, rutile, tourmaline, and zircon (?? <b>chrome</b> <b>spinel)</b> grains. Using micro-Raman spectroscopy, the high-pressure, ??-PbO 2 -structured polymorph of TiO 2 (TiO 2 II) was identified in 27 buff rutile grains from the Carawine, Jeerinah, Bee Gorge, and Monteville spherule layers. For three of the layers, rutile + TiO 2 II grains were found only in their upper parts. For a sample or stratigraphic subdivision within a sample, rutile + TiO 2 II grains comprise ??? 1 - 5 % of the rutile population. The TiO 2 II polymorph is interpreted as a shock-induced phase that is syngenetic with respect to its host spherule layer. The rutile + TiO 2 II grains provide physical evidence to support an impact origin for these four spherule layers. Using a universal stage microscope, measurements of the crystallographic orientations of planar microstructures in three quartz grains from the Carawine spherule layer support the interpretation that the microstructures are shock-induced planar deformation features. No unequivocal evidence of shock metamorphism was found in the white opaque zircon grains; instead, these grains appear to have varying degrees of metamictization. The physical properties of the <b>chrome</b> <b>spinel,</b> rutile, and zircon grains support the previously proposed hypothesis that the Carawine, Jeerinah, and Monteville spherule layers are parts of a single spherule layer that is older than the Bee Gorge spherule layer. This study has documented, apparently for the first time, a shock-induced, high-pressure polymorph (TiO 2 II) from Archean terrestrial rocks. The Gr??nses?? spherule layer (??? 145 cm thick) is a dolomixtite that predominantly contains spherules and mm-to-dm-sized chert and carbonate intraclasts in a dolomitic matrix, and it records a singular debris flow within a low-energy marine environment.

The most magnesian melt inclusions of each geochemical type were used to estimate the temperature-pressure conditions for primary boninites, which range from 1345 °C at 0. 56 GPa to 1421 °C at 0. 85 GPa for the 48 - 46 Ma low-Si and high-Si boninites, and 1381 °C at 0. 85 GPa for the 45 Ma low-Si boninite. The onset of the Pacific slab subduction at 52 Ma forced upwelling of depleted mid-oceanic ridge basalt mantle (DMM) to yield proto-arc basalt (PAB). With the rise of DMM, refractory harzburgite ascended without melting. At 48 - 46 Ma, introduction of slab fluids induced melting of the PAB residue and high-temperature harzburgite, resulting in the low-Si and high-Si boninites, respectively. Meanwhile, convection within the mantle wedge brought the less-depleted residue of PAB and DMM into the region fluxed by slab fluids, which melted to yield the less-depleted low-Si boninite at 45 Ma, and fertile arc basalts, respectively...|$|E
40|$|The Neoarchean layered anorthositic {{complex at}} Sittampundi in {{southern}} India {{is known for}} its chromitite layers that are mostly associated with anorthosite (An(90 - 100)). The chromitites contain FeAl-rich chromites concentrated in layers between amphibole-rich layers with a dominant mineralogy of amphibole-spinel-plagiocase+/-sapphirine. The chromite-rich layers contain only amphibole and plagioclase. Mineral compositions illustrated by X-ray composition maps and profiles show subtle chemical differences. The <b>chrome</b> <b>spinels</b> are of refractory grade with Cr 2 O 3 and Al 2 O 3 contents varying between 34 - 40 wt. % and 23 - 28 wt. %. The chromite compositions are noticeably different from those in layered igneous intrusions of the Bushveld-Stillwater type. The existence of original highly calcic plagioclase, FeAl-rich chromite, and magmatic amphibole is consistent with derivation from a parental magma of hydrous tholeiitic composition that was most likely generated in a supra-subduction zone arc setting. In terms of mineralogy and field relations, the Sittampundi chromitites are remarkably similar to anorthosite-hosted chromitites in the Neoarchean Fiskensset anorthositic complex, Greenland. We propose that the Sittampundi chromitites formed by partial melting of unusually aluminous harzburgite in a hydrated mantle wedge above a subduction zone. This melting process produced hydrous, aluminous basalt, which fractionated at depth to give rise to a variety of high-alumina basalt compositions from which the anorthositic complex with its cumulate chromite-rich and amphibole-rich layers formed within the magma chamber of a supra-subduction zone arc.

40|$|The {{formation}} {{and evolution of}} mantle magmas remain a topical problem in geochemistry and petrology. During the past decade, a considerable contribution to this problem {{was related to the}} investigation of melt inclusions in minerals, which provided insight into the composition of the parental melts of igneous rocks. Owing to these investigations, extensive new evidence was obtained on the compositions and evolution of melts from subduction zones, island arcs, active continental margins, ocean spreading zones, and mantle plumes generating ocean islands. Much less is known about the conditions of generation and compositions of melts related to continental intraplate complexes. In particular, {{there are only a few}} determinations for the Cenozoic complexes of Central Asia. This contribution reports the results of an investigation of the primary magmas of basic rocks composing a number of “lava rivers ” of considerable dimension in the periphery of the Southern Baikal volcanic belt (SBVB). The lavas of these rivers were very mobile, which allowed their flow for distances up to 175 km from the eruption center. The compositions of these magmas and conditions of their crystallization are of special interest for the characterization of the sources of intraplate magmatism, which has occurred widely in the Central Asia Fold Belt. The SBVB comprises several fields of Late Cenozoic basalts at the southwestern coast of L. Baikal over an area of 350 × 450 km. The volcanic rocks are basalts, trachybasalts, and, occasionally, basanites and basaltic trachyandesites. The magmatic activity of this area was dominated by fissure eruptions of basalts. Crystalline and primary melt inclusions were found in olivine phenocrysts from the basalts. Their compositions correspond to the forsterite mole fraction Fo 81 - 60.
