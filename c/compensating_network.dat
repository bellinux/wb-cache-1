40|$|Inductor {{current sensing}} is very {{important}} in the control and monitoring of switching power converters. Traditional low cost implementation using a sensing resistor in series with the inductor will reduce the overall efficiency of the power converter. Conventional Hall effect current sensor could also be used to detect the inductor current. However, it will significantly increase the production cost of power converters. One simple and low cost implementation is to add a resistor-capacitor (RC) network in parallel with the inductor so that the inductor current can be derived from the added circuitry. The problem with RC sensing network is that the sensed variable is very sensitive to temperature variations. In this paper, a novel inductor current sensor using low cost negative temperature coefficient (NTC) thermistors to compensate the variation in the parasitic resistance of the inductor due to temperature changes is proposed. The changes in the cutoff frequency and steady state gain are also compensated by the added NTC thermistor circuit. With the <b>compensated</b> <b>network,</b> the sensed inductor current derived from the modified RC network will be independent of temperature variations.

40|$|Abstract. This chapter {{presents}} a conceptual and selective {{review of the}} relationship between social support and cardiovascular illness and death. It is argued that cardio-vascular health is not only determined by biological factors but also by social and psychological factors. For decades, epidemiological studies have linked mortality rates to marital status and social networks, thus indicating a beneficial effect of such social factors on longevity. Moreover, studies on cardiac patients have attributed increased survival rates to the existence of close social bonds. In the case of conjugal loss, for example, widowers are at risk of illness and death {{in the absence of a}} <b>compensating</b> <b>network</b> of support providers. Health psychology is looking for the mediating mechanisms that help explain such epidemiological associations. For this purpose, social support is distinguished from social integration, and further differentiations are made to better understand the quality and function of interaction processes that result in favorable health outcomes. Physiological, behavioral, and psychological pathways are distinguished in the etiology of disease, signifying differences in how people may respond to stressful encounters and critical life changes...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} six individual studies {{with the overall}} aim to contribute to understanding value creation in interorganizational relationships (IORs), which firms establish to achieve innovation. The six research papers address several specific research questions focusing on different aspects of IORs by using qualitative, quantitative and conceptual methods. The dissertation {{is divided into two}} parts. Part I is an introductory chapter to the six research papers. This part briefly introduces the research questions, methods, paper overviews, and provides some generaldiscussions not emphasized in the specific papers. Part II consists of the six research papers, each presenting a unique inquiry, literature framework, and method. In brief, the six papers of this dissertation are:Paper I presents the benefits of working with the same partners in multiple (different) innovative processes. Paper II tests the influence between relationship characteristics (knowledgetransfer, interorganizational trust, and relationship diversity) and networking firms' corporate entrepreneurship. Paper III tests the indirect effects of partner fit on networking firms' corporate entrepreneurship. Paper IV identifies and tests important factors for innovative performance in firm networks. Paper V tests the influence of <b>compensating</b> <b>network</b> board members on network performance. Paper VI theorizes how and why interorganizational trust can cause rigidities, which may be particularly bothersome in some kinds of IORs. Some general conclusions of the six studies are that they demonstrate the relevance of acknowledging social processes in studies of knowledge exchange; they also recognize that while literature suggesting that social aspects such as trust may be powerful in reducing perceived relational risks, research takes a biased path if it does not also properly acknowledge the risks and costs associated with it; and finally indicate that in discussions of trade-offs between flexibility and stability in IORs it may be useful to consider the dimension of exchange flexibility, that is, how flexible the partners are in what they exchange and when they do this. Some specific conclusions are that the studies demonstrate both antecedents to and consequences of corporate entrepreneurship (CE) in an IOR setting: in terms of antecedents, they explain why partner fit has an indirect effect on knowledge transfer and why CE has a direct effect on knowledge transfer, and in terms of consequences, they explain why knowledge transfer positively influences CE. The studies also suggest that when partners try to create conditions where they do not believe they might be exploited, there is a risk that rigidities in resources and routines develop. Further, they also show that design aspects, such as how the network is formed, configured, and governed, as well as compensation of network board members affect network performance.

40|$|Networked {{control system}} is a special type of {{distributed}} control system where control loop is enclosed by communication medium. Networked Control System (NCS) suffers from the networked induced delay which may be induced in the forward path {{as well as in}} the feedback path. This delay is variable in nature. So if a controller is designed without considering the delays or considering the fixed delay then system performance will be degraded and in the worst case the system become unstable. To <b>compensate</b> the <b>network</b> induced variable transporting delay,a number of methods have been proposed in the literature such as robust control, Smith Predictor and Inteligent control theory. But there are few works reported in literature that employ Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) to <b>compensate</b> the <b>networked</b> induced delays. Firstly an LQR controller is designed to <b>compensate</b> the <b>networked</b> induced variable delay which is varied up to a maximum value. Then an LQG controller is designed to <b>compensate</b> the <b>networked</b> induced delay in noisy environment. Here the controller is the same controller used in LQR technique. Only difference between the standard LQR and the LQG controller said now is that it uses Kalman Filter to estimate the plant output using noisy measurement. Then an Model Predictive Controller (MPC) controller is designed using Laguerre network considering the constraints on control input and on the rate of control input. An integrator plant is considered for simulation where the above three controllers are applied. From the simulation result, it is observed that LQR gives a better step response but MPC has better disturbance rejection capacity. To validate the controllers in real-time, an experiment has been conducted in the Labrotory. In the experimental setup using one PC is considered as controller and other one is considered as plant. They are connected through an Ethernet network. From the real time experiment results it is seen that LQR exibits superior delay compensation performance...|$|R

The ac side filters are also employed to <b>compensate</b> <b>network</b> requested reactive power. Among {{different types of}} filters, double tuned passive filters have been widely utilized in HVDC stations, yet these filters are still not considered well developed. This paper presents an algorithm for design of the conventional and damped-type double tuned filters to reduce harmonic distortion and improve power factor in electrical systems. Firstly, the conventional double tuned filters are comprehensively studied, and an algorithm for precisely determining the parameters {{of this type of}} filters is presented. Next, the proposed design algorithm is developed for damped-typed double tuned filters. Using this method, the parameters of damped-type double tuned filters are calculated based on the tuned frequencies, the parallel resonance frequency, and the reactive power compensation capacity etc. Finally, the performance of the design algorithm is tested for a 6 -pulse HVDC converter simulated on the MATLAB. The results clearly show the effectiveness of proposed design method in harmonics elimination and power factor correction.

The temporal behavior of network packets and controller performance are characterized and compared against those obtained using a local controller. A method is proposed to <b>compensate</b> <b>network</b> delays and recover the performance of the networked controller. The networked control system is basically composed of two nodes: the robot interface and the controller. The functionalities implemented on both nodes are based on RTAI LXRT hard real-time tasks. In order to test the proposed delay compensation method under various network load conditions, a trac emulator was developed. The trac emulator imposes delays to selected packets. These delays are generated accordingly to a statistical model of the network load resembling real network trac. The trac emulator is a program based on LXRT that processes network packets queued by Netlter. A scheduler/dispatcher architecture is used to cope with the statistical nature of delays imposed to packets. Details of the application protocol are discussed and the paper concludes by presenting results comparing control system performance with and without delay compensation for some representative network load conditions. ...|$|R

Acute and chronic brain damage disrupts brain connectivity producing neurological signs and/or symptoms. In several neurological diseases, particularly in Multiple Sclerosis (MS), structural imaging studies cannot always demonstrate a clear association between lesion site and clinical disability, originating the “clinico-radiological paradox. ” The discrepancy between structural damage and disability can be explained by a complex network perspective. Both brain networks architecture and synaptic plasticity may play important roles in modulating brain networks efficiency after brain damage. In particular, long-term potentiation (LTP) may occur in surviving neurons to <b>compensate</b> <b>network</b> disconnection. In MS, inflammatory cytokines dramatically interfere with synaptic transmission and plasticity. Importantly, in addition to acute and chronic structural damage, inflammation could contribute to reduce brain networks efficiency in MS leading to worse clinical recovery after a relapse and worse disease progression. These evidence suggest that removing inflammation should represent the main therapeutic target in MS; moreover, as synaptic plasticity is particularly altered by inflammation, specific strategies aimed at promoting LTP mechanisms could be effective for enhancing clinical recovery. Modulation of plasticity with different non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques has been used to promote recovery of MS symptoms.
