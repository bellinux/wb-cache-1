50|$|Preventative {{conservation}} is key. Some damage to {{works of art}} on paper is irreversible, {{but there are some}} methods of restoration {{that can be used to}} treat damages such as structural tension in the paper created by previous restoration treatments. This may include removal of the secondary and adhering a new support or even an internal <b>cardboard</b> <b>support.</b>|$|E
50|$|Google {{provides}} three {{software development}} kits for developing Cardboard applications: {{one for the}} Android operating system using Java, one for the game engine Unity using C#, {{and one for the}} iOS operating system. After initially supporting only Android, Google announced iOS support for the Unity plugin in May 2015 at the Google I/O 2015 conference. Third-party apps with <b>Cardboard</b> <b>support</b> are available on the Google Play store and App Store for iOS. In addition to native Cardboard apps, there are Google Chrome VR Experiments implemented using WebGL; phones, including Apple's, that support WebGL can run Google's web experiments. A port of the Google Cardboard demonstration app to iOS was released at Google I/O 2015. In January 2016, Google announced that the software development kits would support spatial audio, a virtual reality effect intended to simulate audio coming from outside of the listener's head located anywhere in 3D space.|$|E
50|$|Damage to Watercolor and Gouache {{paintings}} can {{be prevented}} and mitigated by maintaining temperature and relative humidity within acceptable ranges, and low light conditions. As with pastel works, watercolor and gouache paintings should be mounted and framed. Damage that may occur are disfiguring brown spots from mold growth, paper turning brown and brittle from <b>cardboard</b> <b>supports,</b> yellow stains from adhesive tapes, and cockling and undulations.|$|R
30|$|The {{activities}} {{developed during}} the workshop supported results related to the different content presentation and interface design. The criteria for ordering the cards helped the decision about which filters should be offered and which criterion should be the default to organize the announcements. The results suggest that users not familiar with technology use their life experience to organize the information, considering for example thematic groups to filter announcements. The design with the <b>cardboards</b> <b>supported</b> comparisons regarding interface elements chosen or created, their position and size pointing out opportunities for tailoring. This activity emphasized the need of tailorable systems once different elements and shapes were adopted by the participants.|$|R
500|$|In 1983, {{the cousins}} {{admitted}} {{in an article}} published in the magazine The Unexplained that the photographs had been faked, although both maintained that they really had seen fairies. Elsie had copied illustrations of dancing girls from a popular children's book of the time, Princess Mary's Gift Book, published in 1914, and drew wings on them. They said they had then cut out the <b>cardboard</b> figures and <b>supported</b> them with hatpins, disposing of their props in the beck once the photograph had been taken. But the cousins disagreed about the fifth and final photograph, which Doyle in his The Coming of the Fairies described in this way: ...|$|R
5000|$|Almost {{as soon as}} Blakelock {{went into}} the first {{psychiatric}} hospital, his works began to receive recognition. Within a few years the paintings he had once sold for next to nothing were resold for several thousand dollars. In 1916, Blakelock was made an Academician of the National Academy of Design. [...] Meanwhile, Blakelock languished in the mental asylum of Middletown State Homeopathic Hospital, whose administration and staff were unaware of his fame as an artist, and who viewed his belief that his paintings were in major museums as one more sign of his illness. While confined he continued to paint in ink, painting {{on the backs of}} <b>cardboard</b> and various <b>supports,</b> substituting bark and his own hair for brushes.|$|R
5000|$|It {{was only}} in the 19th century that the hood took a very petite shape known today as the Riegelhaube form. It is worn on the upswept hear on the back. The crown should be covered {{together}} with the hair knot of a wound braid. It consists of a stiff <b>cardboard</b> base that <b>supports</b> precious metals, a padding, and a layer of brocade, velvet, silver or gold fabric, more or less embroidered with silver or gold thread. In the vernacular the Riegelhaube was also called [...] "Gei√üeuterl" [...] (goat udders) because of its two downward pointing points. In the time of the Empire and the Biedermeier it was worn with fashionable clothing. August Lewald wrote in 1835: [...] "The so very popular Riegelhaube, which can be seen especially on the young Munichers' delicates faces, is a very peculiar headdress, which shows no similarity to any other in Germany." ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe are {{interested}} in how to create digital tools to support informal sketching and prototyping of physical objects by novices. Achieving this goal first requires {{a deeper understanding of}} how non-professional designers generate, explore, and communicate design ideas with traditional tools, i. e., sketches on paper and hands-on prototyping materials. We describe a study framed around two all-day design char-rettes where participants perform a complete design process: ideation sketching, concept development and presentation, fabrication planning documentation and collaborative fabrication of hand-crafted prototypes. This structure allows us to control key aspects of the design process while collecting rich data about creative tasks, including sketches on paper, physical models, and videos of collaboration discussions. Participants used a variety of drawing techniques to convey 3 D concepts. They also extensively manipulated physical materials, such as paper, foam, and <b>cardboard,</b> both to <b>support</b> concept exploration and communication with design partners. Based on these observations, we propose design guidelines for CAD tools targeted at novice crafters...|$|R

An earlier riser of more mature age is seen on the right possessing abundant hair and wonderful wings. Her slightly denser body can be glimpsed within her fairy dress.|$|R
