40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the findings from}} an Australian study in which forty-one people, who self-identified as having a psycho-social disability {{as a result of}} mental health problems, spoke about their priorities for treatment, care and support within a personalised funding context. The research enabled an improved understanding of the choices about support that people with psycho-social disabilities would make if offered individualised funding packages. Participants prioritised specific supports to improve their health, financial situation, social <b>connection,</b> <b>housing</b> and personal relationships. A relationship with a support worker with a range of skills was identified as a key facilitator of these life goals, but people with psycho-social disabilities also valued opportunities to have discretionary funds to directly address the major problems they face, including stigma, discrimination and poverty. The paper argues that social workers can potentially fill a range of roles and are well placed to work in partnership with people with psycho-social disabilities. Particularly, they have skills in co-production of services, negotiation and advocacy that are required if individual funding is to be maximised for user control, social justice and personal recovery outcomes...|$|E

40|$|It {{remains unknown}} how lateral <b>house</b> <b>connections</b> affect the {{performance}} of the sewer system, since the assessment of serviceability is mainly based {{on the state of the}} main sewer system. Further insight into the contribution of lateral <b>house</b> <b>connections</b> to the overall level of service provided can aid to target investments to parts of the system where it is most effective. To this end, techniques from the reliability theory were applied to a commercial sewer maintenance database to quantify the impact of lateral <b>house</b> <b>connections</b> on the serviceability of sewer systems. Analysis of the data showed that the failures follow a Poisson distribution. A comparison of the derived failure rate with values obtained from a different study revealed that the blockage rate of lateral <b>house</b> <b>connections</b> is an order of magnitude greater than the failure rate of the dominant mechanism of main sewer systems, thereby making the impact of lateral <b>house</b> <b>connections</b> on the serviceability of sewer systems substantial.

Tablas Island Electric Cooperatives (TIELCO) serves the power needs of Tablas Island including San Jose. It operates a 5.070 MW diesel power plant in Odiongan and 1.740 MW power barge in San Agustin. The electric cooperative serves a total of 21,097 <b>house</b> <b>connections.</b> Romblon Electric Cooperative (ROMELCO) supplies the capital town of Romblon through a 1.720 MW diesel power plant and a 1.30 MW power barge. It also serves Sibuyan Island using a 3.006 MW diesel power plant in San Fernando. ROMELCO has 5,288 <b>house</b> <b>connections</b> in Romblon and 5,150 <b>house</b> <b>connections</b> in the three municipalities located in Sibuyan Island or a total of 10,438 <b>house</b> <b>connections</b> in their franchise area.

40|$|The {{anterior}} part of {{the sewer}} system consists {{of a system of}} gully pots and lateral (<b>house)</b> <b>connections</b> that drain to main sewers. The total length of lateral <b>house</b> <b>connections</b> can be similar to the total length of the sewers they drain to. In addition, there are 7 million gully pots with corresponding lateral connections in the Netherlands alone. Considering the potential consequences of a lateral <b>house</b> <b>connection</b> blockage, proper functioning of these system components is essential. Analysis of literature on main sewer infrastructure strongly related to lateral (<b>house)</b> <b>connections</b> indicate these components to be more susceptible to shared failure mechanisms. Both incorrect use by citizens and the structural condition seem to influence the blockage propensity. Furthermore, recent research has revealed gully pot blockages to make larger contributions to flooding in public spaces than intense storm events and main sewer blockages. Gully pots are equipped with a sand trap to prevent solids from being transported to the downstream water infrastructure. The continuous trapping of solids may eventually impair the hydraulic performance. Lack of knowledge on the condition of the anterior part of a sewer system has led to the prevalence of reactive strategies, where activities are undertaken after the consequences of an operational failure becomes apparent. Next to being more costly, these strategies expose citizens to the consequences of a failure such as tangible damages and health risks. Alternatively, proactive strategies are characterised by activities that are undertaken before a failure occurs. Preserving the functionality of lateral (<b>house)</b> <b>connections</b> and gully pots, given the available resources, calls for knowledge on the effectiveness of proactive strategies and information on blockage prone components to balance proactive and reactive activities. To this end, the general objective of this thesis is to provide a methodology that supports the optimisation of management strategies for the anterior {{part of the}} sewer system.
