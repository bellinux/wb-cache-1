To prevent the development of silica related disease, the exposure to silica dust should be kept as far below the time weighted average (TWA) occupational exposure level (OEL). Exposure below the TWA OEL {{is considered to be}} safe. The silica content of platinum ore is low and exposure below the TWA OEL (Stanton et al., 2006), however studies have shown evidence of silicosis in workers that had no other exposure to silica outside of the platinum industry (Nelson and Murray., 2012). Objectives: To evaluate the silica exposure levels of 4 different high risk tasks at a platinum mine. To evaluate the sufficiency of the current South African OEL. To compare the differences in protocols used by the mine to NIOSH method 7602. Methods: Dust sampling was conducted by means of two cyclone samplers (aspirated at 2. 2 L/min) in the breathing zone of each of the 48 workers in 4 different areas. Two cyclone samplers were used to compare two different protocols. The first protocol reflected the method used by the mine and the second was done in accordance with the NIOSH method 7602 (NIOSH, 2003). Sampling was done in the vamping, development <b>cleaning,</b> <b>belt</b> attendant and grout plant areas. A 25 mm MCE filter was used to capture the respirable fraction. The quartz content of the filter was determined by a SANAS accredited laboratory using qualitative infrared spectroscopy in accordance with NIOSH method 7602. Additional bulk samples were taken to be analysed for silica as well. Results: Most of the samples were below the respective OELs of 0. 1 mg/m 3 (MHS, 1996), 0. 05 mg/m 3 (NIOSH, 2002) and 0. 025 mg/m 3 (ACGIH, 2012). A single sample in the development cleaning area in the Merensky reef had a value of 0. 032 mg/m 3. Nearly {{no significant differences were found}} in the exposure levels between the two protocols, the two reefs or the different underground areas. Although the differences in protocol are not statistically significant the protocol implemented by the mine yielded lower exposure values. The grout plant had the lowest silica exposure levels. Conclusions: Upon evaluating the silica exposures of platinum mine workers there does not seem to be a health or safety risk involved at these low levels. The implemented control measures are sufficient in preventing the development of applicable health and safety risks. However if any new cases of severe illness (e. g. silicosis) occur it may be necessary to re-evaluate the risks involved with silica exposure. Recommendations: The goal of silica monitoring should be to obtain accurate data that represents the actual exposure levels experienced by a worker during a working shift. Accurate data gives insight into the safety of the worker. To achieve this, the monitoring should be done as accurately as possible to adhere to the prescribed methods. Employees/workers should be trained in order to assist in identifying and correcting problems that may occur during sampling. Master...|$|E

30|$|Sanding {{treatment}} was performed with a Costa wide-belt sander provided with closed coat paper-backed sanding belts. The boards were sanded with aluminium oxide sandpaper. Three sanding programs were tested: 80 -, 80 - 100 - and 80 - 100 - 120 -grit stages. The 80 -grit, 100 -grit, and 120 -grit sanding belts {{worked with a}} 0.5, 0.3, and 0.2  mm removal depth, respectively. All sanding belts were installed onto a drum and feeding was carried out fiberwise. Three feed speeds were used: 4, 10.5, and 17  m/min. The linear velocity of drums was kept constant at 20  m/min for all sanding programs. Oscillating blowers performed cooling and <b>cleaning</b> of the <b>belt</b> during sanding.|$|R
40|$|Persistent Listeria monocytogenes {{contamination}} of food industry equipment {{is a difficult}} problem to solve. Ultrasonic cleaning offers new possibilities for cleaning conveyors and other equipment that {{are not easy to}} clean. Ultrasonic cleaning was tested on three conveyor belt materials: polypropylene, acetal, and stainless steel (cold-rolled, AISI 304). Cleaning efficiency was tested at two temperatures (30 and 45 degrees C) and two cleaning times (30 and 60 s) with two cleaning detergents (KOH, and NaOH combined with KOH). Conveyor belt materials were soiled with milk-based soil and L. monocytogenes strains V 1, V 3, and B 9, and then incubated for 72 h to attach bacteria to surfaces. Ultrasonic cleaning treatments reduced L. monocytogenes counts on stainless steel 4. 61 to 5. 90 log units; on acetal, 3. 37 to 5. 55 log units; and on polypropylene, 2. 31 to 4. 40 log units. The logarithmic reduction differences were statistically analyzed by analysis of variance using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software. The logarithmic reduction was significantly greater in stainless steel than in plastic materials (P< 0. 001 for polypropylene, P= 0. 023 for acetal). Higher temperatures enhanced the cleaning efficiency in tested materials. No significant difference occurred between cleaning times. The logarithmic reduction was significantly higher (P= 0. 013) in cleaning treatments with potassium hydroxide detergent.

40|$|The {{spillage}} that accumulates under {{conveyor belt}} lines presents a possible fire and explosion hazard fomiinqjetsoruiel, especially {{to those who}} must clean up the spillage. The U. S. Bureau of Mines conducted research to reduce this hazard by identifying and investigating the parameters affecting the efficiency of conveyor <b>belt</b> <b>cleaning.</b> The amount of material carried back under the conveyor and the wear rates of metal cleaning blades decreased with increasing blade-to-belt pressure to a limiting value, after which the carryback and wear rates remained essentially constant. The optimum blade-to-belt pressure {{was found to be}} 11 to 14 psi for the research conveyor system. Greater pressures increased the blade-belt friction without improving either cleaning or blade life. The modes of blade wear were three-body abrasion and slurry erosion caused by the sand-lime test mixture. Wear rates were reduced by increasing the metal hardness, opti-mizing the pressure, and removing conveyor belt imperfections. Corrosion was not observed to affect the wear of various steels in tests of less than 34 h. The results of this study should allow mine operators to run their conveyors under conditions that will maximize cleaning and minimize equipment wear...|$|R

Surface samples were collected of two types of conveyor belt (modular and smooth) which passed through two processes (with and without water spray), in four times (T 0, T 1, T 2 and T 3). The samples were subjected to mesophilic and enterobacteria count, and research of L. monocytogenes. Cultures of L. monocytogenes were serotyped and submitted to PFGE. Ten replicates of the experiment were performed on each processing line. The results demonstrated that the effect of the use of spraying with water was dependent on several factors, such as the processing line, product type, equipment design and the type of conveyor <b>belt.</b> The <b>cleaning</b> spray is not the primary factor in ensuring the elimination of L. monocytogenes, because the pathogen was isolated independent of the type of conveyor belt and processing line, moreover, PFGE demonstrated the dissemination in the processing lines. Thus, the decision to remove the water from the <b>cleaning</b> of conveyor <b>belts</b> must be preceded by a study to ensure that the absence of this procedure does not influence the safety of products of animal originO presente estudo teve como objetivo avaliar o efeito do uso de aspersão de água como forma de higiene operacional em esteiras sanitárias condutoras de cortes de frango em quatro linhas de processamento. Em cada linha de processamento, foram coletadas amostras de dois tipos de esteiras (modular e lisa) higienizadas com água e não higienizadas, em quatro tempos distintos (T 0, T 1, T 2 e T 3). As amostras foram submetidas à contagem de mesófilos, enterobactérias e pesquisa de L. monocytogenes. Culturas de L. monocytogenes foram submetidas à sorotipagem e a PFGE. Foram realizadas dez repetições do experimento em cada linha de processamento. Com base nos resultados foi possível observar que o efeito da utilização da aspersão com água foi dependente de diversos fatores, tais como a linha de processamento, tipo de corte, design do equipamento e o tipo de esteira. A higienização por aspersão não foi o fator primordial para garantir a eliminação de L. monocytogenes, uma vez que o patógeno foi isolado independente da linha de processamento e tipo de esteira, além disso, os pulsotipos encontrados evidenciaram a disseminação do patógeno nas linhas de processamento avaliadas. Deste modo, a decisão de retirar a água do processo de higienização de esteiras condutoras deve ser precedida de um estudo criterioso para garantir que a sua ausência não venha influenciar na inocuidade dos produtos de origem anima...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} assess the {{microbiology}} of food and hand contact surfaces in the retail environment {{and the potential for}} these surfaces to act as vehicles for the spread of foodborne pathogens. During the survey, 10 stores in the Republic of Ireland (ROI) were visited by student Environmental Health Officers (EHOs) who took swab samples from four surfaces: conveyor belts, long-life shopping bags, shopping trolley handles and keypads on card payment units. The swab samples were examined for the presence of the pathogens Salmonella, Campylobacter and Listeria. The Aerobic Colony Counts, as well as the levels of E. coli and Enterobacteriaceae, were also determined. In addition, structured questionnaires were used with retailers to establish the storesâ€™ regimes for the <b>cleaning</b> of conveyor <b>belts.</b> Similarly, shoppers donating their long-life shopping bags for sampling were questioned about how they normally use these bags, and the results were compared with those from the microbiological survey. The results indicated that the hygiene of the surfaces sampled was good, with Salmonella, Campylobacter and Listeria not detected in any of the samples, and levels of both Enterobacteriaceae and E. coli were below the limits of detection in all but one sample. Aerobic Colony Counts varied but none of the results obtained would be deemed â€˜unacceptableâ€™ or â€˜unsatisfactoryâ€™ under guidelines for ready-to-eat food...|$|R
40|$|Continuous process {{improvement}} and automation {{have proven to}} be powerful tools for the wood processing industries in order to obtain better final product quality and thus increase profits. Abrasive machining represents an important and relevant process in the manufacturing and processing of wood products, which also implies high cost of materials and labor; therefore, special attention to this process is necessary. The objective of this work was to evaluate and demonstrate a process control system for use in the abrasive machining of wood and wood-based products. A control system was created on LabView® to integrate the monitoring process and the actions required, depending on the abrasive machining process conditions. The system acquires information from the optical sensor to detect loading and activate the cleaning system. The system continuously monitors the condition of the abrasive belt (tool wear) by using an acoustic emission sensor and alerts the operator of the status of the belt (green, yellow, and red lights indicating satisfactory, medium, and poor belt condition). The system also incorporates an additional safety device, which helps prevent permanent damage to the belt, equipment, or workpiece by alerting the operator when an excessive temperature has been reached. The process control system proved that automation permits enhancement in the consistency of the <b>belt</b> <b>cleaning</b> technique by the elimination of the human errors. Furthermore, this improvement also affects the cost by extending the life of the belt, which reduces setup time, belt cost, operation cost, as well as others...|$|R
