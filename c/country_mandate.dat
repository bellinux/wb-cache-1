"Special procedures" [...] is {{the general}} name given to the {{mechanisms}} established by the Human Rights Council to gather expert observations and advice on human rights issues {{in all parts of}} the world. Special procedures are categorized as either thematic mandates, which focus on major phenomena of human rights abuses worldwide, or <b>country</b> <b>mandates,</b> which report on human rights situations in specific countries or territories. Special procedures can be either individuals (called [...] "Special Rapporteurs" [...] or [...] "Independent Experts"), who are intended to be independent experts in a particular area of human rights, or working groups, usually composed of five members (one from each UN region). As of September 30, 2016 there were 43 thematic and 14 <b>country</b> <b>mandates.</b>|$|R

40|$|Compulsory school {{laws have}} existed {{for more than}} a hundred years, and {{policies}} to mandate further education continue to be discussed. The implications of these laws, however, are not well understood. Historical changes to compulsory schooling in Canada permit an examination of their effects on would-be-dropouts under very different circumstances than those during changes in other <b>countries.</b> <b>Mandating</b> education substantially increased adult income and substantially decreased the likelihood of being below the low-income cut-off unemployed, and in a manual occupation. These findings suggest significant gains from this legislation, which seem unlikely offset by the costs incurred while having to remain in school. ...|$|R
50|$|The term DSM {{was coined}} {{following}} {{the time of}} the 1973 energy crisis and 1979 energy crisis. Governments of many <b>countries</b> <b>mandated</b> performance of various programs for demand management. An early example is the National Energy Conservation Policy Act of 1978 in the U.S., preceded by similar actions in California and Wisconsin. Demand Side Management was introduced publicly by Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) in the 1980s. Nowadays, DSM technologies become increasingly feasible due to the integration of information and communications technology and the power system, new terms such as Integrated Demand-Side Management (IDSM), or smart grid.|$|R

2500|$|Prompted by {{legislation}} in various <b>countries</b> <b>mandating</b> increased bulb efficiency, new [...] "hybrid" [...] incandescent bulbs {{have been introduced}} by Philips. The [...] "Halogena Energy Saver" [...] incandescents can produce about 23 lm/W; about 30 percent more efficient than traditional incandescents, by using a reflective capsule to reflect formerly wasted infrared radiation back to the filament from which it can be re-emitted as visible light. This concept was pioneered by Duro-Test in 1980 with a commercial product that produced 29.8 lm/W. More advanced reflectors based on interference filters or photonic crystals can theoretically result in higher efficiency, up to a limit of about 270 lm/W (40% of the maximum efficacy possible). Laboratory proof-of-concept experiments have produced as much as 45 lm/W, approaching the efficacy of compact fluorescent bulbs.|$|R
50|$|To improve {{motorcycle}} safety many <b>countries</b> <b>mandate</b> {{the wearing of}} personal protective equipment such as protective clothing and helmets. Protective clothing may include certain types of jackets, gloves, boots, and pants. Jackets meant for motorcyclists are typically made of leather or specialized man-made fabrics like cordura or Kevlar. These jackets typically include heavy padding on the elbow, spine, and shoulder regions. Gloves are generally made of leather or Kevlar and some include carbon fiber knuckle protection. Boots, especially those for sport riding, include reinforcement and plastic caps on the ankle and toe areas. Pants are usually leather, cordura, or Kevlar. Except for helmets, none of these items are required by law in any state in the USA, or {{in any part of}} the UK but are recommended by many of those who ride.|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe United States Navy plans to decommission several classes of warships {{in the next}} decade. Each of the major Southern Cone countries of Latin America (Argentina, Brazil, and Chile) perceives a geopolitically-driven need for a blue-water navy. Each of these navies needs frigates and destroyers to achieve blue-water status. This thesis examines U. S. ship transfer policy to the Southern Cone. It concludes that the Adams -. Coontz -. and Knox -class ships that the U. S. navy is beginning to decommission should be leased to the Southern Cone navies in order to bolster their naval forces and to support mutual maritime security interests. The poor economic status of these <b>countries</b> <b>mandates</b> that the lease terms be made as favorable as possible and that the annual number of ship leases be kept to a few.
