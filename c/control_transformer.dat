40|$|Abstract- DC current {{unbalance}} in the windings of a transformer may initiate a runaway process and ultimately drive the transformer into saturation. Such a situation could arise in a transformer coupled resonant converter {{that does not}} include a series capacitor. This issue was explored in this study theoretically, by simulation and experimentally. A method is proposed for automatically adjusting the transformer’s DC current to zero by correcting the asymmetry of the drive. This balancing control is facilitated by a signal obtained from a DC/AC current sensor which senses the transformer’s primary and secondary currents such that they cancel each other for the no DC case. The proposed method was tested on a self oscillating, parallel loaded DC-DC resonant converter of 12 V input voltage 500 V output voltage and 700 W power level. The proposed approach allows the design of resonant converters without DC decoupling capacitors which could lead to a significant cost and size reduction.

We approximate measurements results of electrical resistance sensor as an exponential function of two variables ? temperature and humidity oil. Using the proposed method, we calculate the coefficients of samples and humidity sensor. The calculations reveal that measurement of the temperature of transformer oil and impedance sensing element can help determine moisture content of transformer oil in which it is located. We outline the results and recommend how main characteristics of the humidity sensor of this type of transformer oil can be calculated.
