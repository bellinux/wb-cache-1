5000|$|Produced by Volvo Aero (now GKN Aerospace Engine Systems), the RM12 is a {{derivative}} of the General Electric F404-400. Changes {{from the standard}} F404 includes greater reliability for single-engine operations (including more stringent birdstrike protection), increased thrust, and {{the adoption of a}} full authority digital engine control (FADEC) system. Several subsystems and components were also redesigned to reduce maintenance demands. [...] The air intakes of the engine were designed to minimize radar reflection from the compression fan, reducing the radar cross section of the aircraft overall. The F404's analogue Engine Control Unit was replaced with the Digital Engine Control - jointly developed by Volvo and GE - which communicates with the cockpit through the digital data buses and, as redundancy, mechanical calculators controlled by a single wire will regulate the fuel-flow into the engine. These mechanical backup systems remain in the new Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC) which Volvo began developing in 1996. General Electric produces 50% of the engine. Elements such as the fan/compressor discs and case, <b>compressor</b> <b>spool,</b> hubs, seals, and afterburner are manufactured in Sweden, final assembly also taking place there.|$|E

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{simulation model}} of a novel rotating <b>spool</b> <b>compressor</b> is presented. The <b>spool</b> <b>compressor</b> provides a new rotating compression mechanism with easily manufactured components. Compared with other rotary <b>compressors,</b> the <b>spool</b> <b>compressor</b> presents the additional advantage of relocating the face sealing surfaces to the outer radius of the device. A detailed analytical geometry model of the <b>spool</b> <b>compressor</b> is presented which includes the geometry of the vane. This geometry model is included in a comprehensive model that includes submodels for friction, leakage, and heat transfer. The results of the comprehensive model were validated using experimental data from a prototype compressor. The prototype compressor has an overall displacement of 23. 9 cm 3, and was operated at rotational speeds between 1750 and 3250 rpm and pressure ratios between 2. 1 and 2. 9 using R 410 A as the working fluid. The model predicts the volumetric and overall isentropic efficiencies of the prototype compressor to within 6. 3 % and 11. 2 % MAE, respectively. The trends and spread in the data indicate that additional effort should {{be focused on the}} operation of the active sealing elements within the compressor...|$|R
40|$|This paper makes {{comparisons}} between CFD computations and experimental measurements of heat transfer for the axial throughflow of {{cooling air in}} a high-pressure <b>compressor</b> <b>spool</b> rig and a plane cavity rig. The heat transfer measurements are produced using fluxmeters and by the conduction solution method from surface temperature measurements. Numerical predictions are made by solving the Navier-Stokes equations in a full three-dimensional, time-dependent form using the finite-volume method. Convergence is accelerated using a multigrid algorithm and turbulence modeled using a simple mixing length formulation. Notwithstanding systematic differences between the measurements and the computations, the level of agreement {{can be regarded as}} promising in view of the acknowledged uncertainties in the experimental data, the limitations of the turbulence model and, perhaps more importantly, the modest grid densities used for the computations...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{gas turbine}} engine {{internal}} air system provides cooling and sealing air {{to a series of}} critical subsystems and components such as high pressure gas turbine blades, as well as controlling the thrust load on the turbine and <b>compressor</b> <b>spool</b> assembly. Many potential variations for the internal air system are possible, depending on the requirement, expertise and command of intellectual property. Some subsystems, such as rim seals, pre-swirl systems, and rotating cavities {{have been the subject of}} extensive development and analysis leading to robust design solutions. Nevertheless there remains scope for further consideration of the overall system design, and this paper explores the use of a decision analysis tool called morphological analysis applied to the internal air system. Morphological analysis provides an effective means for tackling issues where there is uncertainty, as is the case with many design scenarios, including the internal air system, with some specific parameters and information not available until later in the design phase, after the key geometry has been defined. The problem space comprising seven principal parameters, and a cross consistency matrix which allows identification of compatible and incompatible states are presented...|$|E
40|$|The {{high power}} densities {{expected}} for the MIT microengine (silicon MEMS-based micro-gas turbine generator) require the turbine and <b>compressor</b> <b>spool</b> to rotate {{at a very}} high speed at elevated temperatures (1300 to 1700 K). However, the thermal softening of silicon (Si) at temperatures above 900 K limits the highest achievable operating temperatures, which in turn significantly compromises the engine efficiency. Silicon carbide (SiC) offers great potential for improved microengine efficiency due to its high stiffness, strength, and resistance to oxidation at elevated temperatures. However, techniques for microfabricating SiC to the high level of precision needed for the microengine are not currently available. Given the limitations imposed by the SiC microfabrication difficulties, this thesis proposed Si-SiC hybrid turbine structures, explores key process steps, identified, and resolved critical problems in each of the processes along with a thorough characterization of the microstructures, mechanical properties, and composition of CVD SiC. Three key process steps for the Si-SiC hybrid structures are CVD SiC deposition on silicon wafers, wafer-level SiC planarization, and Si-to-SiC wafer bonding. Residual stress control in SiC coatings is of the most critical importance to the CVD process itself {{as well as to the}} subsequent wafer planarization, and bonding processes since residual stress-induced wafer bow increases the likelihood of wafer cracking significantly. Based on CVD parametric studies performed to determine the relationship between residual stresses in SiC and H 2 /MTS ratio, deposition temperature, and HCl/MTS ratio, very low residual stress (less than several tens of MPa) in thick CVD SiC coatings (up to - 50 pm) was achieved. (cont.) In the course of the residual stress study, a general method for stress quantification was developed to isolate the intrinsic stress from the thermal stress. In addition, qualitative explanations for the residual stress generation are also offered, which are in good agreement with experimental results. In the post-CVD processes, the feasibility of SiC wafer planarization and Si-to-SiC wafer bonding processes have successfully been demonstrated, where CVD oxide was used as an interlayer bonding material to overcome the roughness of SiC surface. Finally, the bonding interface of the Si-SiC hybrid structures with oxide interlayer was verified to retain its integrity at high temperatures through four-point flexural tests. by Dongwon Choi.

Another novel feature was a turbine which passed alternately through the combustion chamber efflux and cooling air tapped from the bypass flow. By the Summer of 1942 design goals had been revised down and the new engine was given the designations ZTL6001(company) and DB 007 / ZTL 109-007 (RLM), ZTL being an acronym for Zweikreiststurbinen-Luftstrahltriebwerk (two-circuit turbojet engine).|$|R
5000|$|A pulse {{detonation}} engine (PDE) {{is a type}} of {{propulsion system}} that uses detonation waves to combust the fuel and oxidizer mixture. The engine is pulsed because the mixture must be renewed in the combustion chamber between each detonation wave and the next. Theoretically, a PDE can operate from subsonic up to a hypersonic flight speed of roughly Mach 5. An ideal PDE design can have a thermodynamic efficiency higher than other designs like turbojets and turbofans because a detonation wave rapidly compresses the mixture and adds heat at constant volume. Consequently, moving parts like <b>compressor</b> <b>spools</b> are not necessarily required in the engine, which could significantly reduce overall weight and cost. PDEs have been considered for propulsion since 1940. [...] Key issues for further development include fast and efficient mixing of the fuel and oxidizer, the prevention of autoignition, and integration with an inlet and nozzle.|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. An experimental investigation {{has been carried out}} to determine the aerodynamic performance of an annular S-shaped duct representative of that used to connect the compressor spools of aircraft gas turbine engines. Measurements of both the mean flow and turbulent structure have been obtained using both 5 hole pressure probes and a 3 component Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA) system. The measurements indicate that development of the flow within the duct is complex and significantly influenced by the combined effects of streamwise pressure gradients and flow curvature. For inlet conditions in which boundary layers are developed along an upstream entry length the static pressure, shear stress and velocity distributions are presented. The data shows {{that as a result of}} flow curvature significant streamwise pressure gradients exist within the duct, with this curvature also affecting the generation and suppression of turbulence. The stagnation pressure loss within the duct is also assessed and is consistent with the measured distributions of shear stress. More engine representative conditions are provided by locating a single stage compressor at inlet to the duct. Relative to the naturally developed inlet conditions the flow within the duct is less likely to separate, but mixing out of the compressor blade wakes increases the measured duct loss. With both types of inlet conditions the effect of a radial strut, such as that used for carrying loads and engine services, is also described both in terms of the static pressure distribution along the strut and its contribution to overall loss. The effects of inlet swirl on the flow field that develops within an annular S-shaped duct have also been investigated. By removing the outlet guide vanes from an upstream single stage compressor swirl angles in excess of 30 ° were generated. Results show that within the S-shaped duct tangential momentum is conserved, leading to increasing swirl velocities through the duct as its radius decreases. Furthermore, this component influences the streamwise velocity as pressure gradients are established to ensure the mean flow follows the duct curvature. Consequently in the critical region adjacent to the inner casing, where separation is most likely to occur, higher streamwise velocities are observed. Within the duct substantial changes also occur to the turbulence field which results in an increased stagnation pressure loss between duct inlet and exit. Data is also presented showing the increasing swirl angles through the duct which has consequences both for the design of the downstream <b>compressor</b> <b>spool</b> and of any radial struts which may be located within the duct...|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{environmental}} awareness, uncertain economic climates and fluctuating {{fuel prices}} {{have led to}} airlines investigating the means to lower aircraft fuel burn, emissions and noise, while maintaining the highest possible safety standards. This is done {{in order to reduce}} operating costs as well as a desire to offer customers more environmentally responsible transport options. The jet engine has been a fundamental part of passenger aircraft travel and has evolved to become more efficient and quiet. With an aim to improve the overall efficiency of the gas turbine, the industry has consistently sought to improve thermal and propulsive efficiency. Higher thermal efficiencies have been achieved through increased overall pressure ratios and the turbine entry temperatures, while higher propulsive efficiencies has been achieved through increase in bypass ratios. Conventional technology is however reaching the limits of any further improvements. This study seeks to investigate these design limits for the conventional aero gas turbine and focusses on the propulsion system of short to medium range jet aircraft, specifically catering to low cost airline operations in Europe. A techno-economic risk analysis approach was followed through the utilisation of a flexible multi-disciplinary framework. This allows a multitude of critical parameters and factors to be investigated and their effects established. Some of the key parameters investigated include the effect of design optimisation on SFC, mission fuel burn, engine sizes and weights. By first quantifying the current design parameters and associated constraints for the selected conventional propulsion system, an optimisation study is carried out to identify the possible design limits to which the conventional technology may be pushed. It is therefore possible to then quantify the maximum benefit available to this mature technology and also to further identify which future technologies may offer the most benefits for a particular airline market strategy. The key contribution to knowledge from this study is to therefore provide a techno-economic risk assessment of an optimised conventional high bypass ratio turbofan and establish the design limits that may be needed to achieve further benefits from conventional designs. The study is undertaken from an operator/airline perspective and further quantifies {{the point at which the}} investment opportunity of a novel technology justifies the risks associated with it. This study has shown that there is still potential for fuel burn improvement from the evolution of the conventional turbofan. This improvement could be up to 15 - 20 % when compared to technology of the year 2000. This is shown to be achieved through improvement material and design of the high pressure <b>compressor</b> <b>spool,</b> aimed at essentially reducing weight and diameters.

40|$|The {{gas turbine}} {{industry}} has a continued interest in improving engine performance and reducing net operating and maintenance costs. These goals are being realized because of advancements in aeroelasticity, materials, and computational {{tools such as}} CFD and engine simulations. These advancements aid in increasing engine thrust-to-weight ratios, specific fuel consumption, pressure ratios, and overall reliability through higher speed, higher temperature, and more efficient engine operation. Currently, rolling element bearing and squeeze film dampers are used to support rotors in gas turbine engines. Present ball bearing configurations are limited in speed (< 2 million DN) and temperature (< 5 OO F) and require both cooling air and an elaborate lubrication system.

40|$|This {{paper is}} in closed access. In a {{multistage}} intermediate pressure compressor an efficiency benefit may {{be gained by}} reducing reaction in the rear stages, and allowing swirl to persist at the exit. This swirl must now be removed within the transition duct that is situated between the intermediate and high pressure <b>compressor</b> <b>spools,</b> in order to present the downstream compressor with suitable inlet conditions. This paper presents the numerical design and experimental validation of an initial concept which uses a lifting strut to remove tangential momentum from the flow within an S-shaped compressor transition duct. The design methodology uses an existing strut profile with the camber line modified to remove a specified amount of the inlet tangential momentum. A linear strut loading was employed in the meridional direction with a nominally constant loading in the radial direction. This approach was applied to an existing aggressive S-duct configuration in which approximately 12. 5 ° of swirl remains at OGV exit. 3 D CFD predictions were used for preliminary assessment of duct loading and {{to determine how much}} swirl could be removed. Consequently, a fully annular test facility incorporating a 1 1 / 2 stage axial compressor was used to experimentally evaluate four configurations; an unstrutted duct, a non-lifting strut and lifting struts designed to remove 50 % and 75 % of the inlet tangential momentum. Despite the expected large increase in loss caused by the introduction of struts there was not a significant additional loss measured with the inclusion of turning. No evidence of flow separation was observed and the data suggested that {{it may be possible to}} remove more swirl than was attempted. Although the turning struts did not remove the entire targeted swirl due to viscous deviation the data still confirm the feasibility of using a lifting strut/duct concept which has the potential to off-load the rear stages of the upstream compressor...|$|R
40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{study of}} the influence of scaling is presented for the rotating <b>spool</b> <b>compressor.</b> This study uses the previously developed comprehensive compressor model for the rotating <b>spool</b> <b>compressor</b> developed by Bradshaw and Groll (2013). Using this model a {{study of the}} influence of the compressor volumetric displacement is performed. This study relies on a set of scaling rules to determine the size of the compressor features as the compressor displacement changes. The study finds that as the volumetric displacement increases, the volumetric efficiency asymptotically increases. It is also found that there is an optimum in overall isentropic efficiency as the volumetric displacement increases which suggests a trade-off between sealing and port restrictions. The compressor aspect ratio (axial length to bore diameter) is varied between roughly 0. 2 and 3. 5 at eccentricity ratios (rotor diameter to bore diameter) of 0. 825, 0. 85, 0. 893, and 0. 92. It is found that for a given eccentricity ratio, there exists an optimum aspect ratio that maximizes sealing. Additionally, the eccentricity ratio shows a high level of sensitivity to the overall performance of the compressor. As the eccentricity ratio decreases, the overall isentropic efficiency of the compressor increases until an eccentricity ratio of 0. 85. Below an eccentricity ratio of 0. 85 the overall isentropic efficiency does not increase despite an increase in volumetric efficiency...|$|R

40|$|Because of {{the many}} air-conditioning, refrigeration, and heating {{applications}} that utilize vapor compression equipment, the vapor compression cycle {{has been the focus}} of significant research. The combination of rising energy costs and increasing environmental awareness motivates the development of more efficient cycle components, including higher performance compressors, heat exchangers, and expansion devices for recovering work. However, modifications to the basic vapor compression cycle also show potential for significantly improving cooling cycle performance through increased cooling capacity and COP. ^ The current study investigates the performance improvements that can be achieved through the use of intercooling and economizing. A basic cycle model that uses a compressor with a fixed isentropic efficiency is developed in EES to study these configurations. The model first considers two-stage compression with intercooling between the stages, which does not improve the cooling capacity but provides an increase in COP as a result of decreased compressor work. ^ The basic cycle model considers two different approaches for economizing with two-stage compression. The first approach uses a flash tank to supply saturated vapor to the compressor between the stages. Drawing off the saturated vapor in the flash tank to mix with the first-stage compressor discharge gas not only cools the compression gas, reducing the compression work, but also results in an increased cooling capacity. Therefore, flash tank economization provides a significantly greater improvement in COP compared to intercooling under the same operating conditions. ^ The second approach to economizing uses an intermediate heat exchanger (IHX) to supply two-phase or vaporized refrigerant to the compressor at the intermediate pressure. The IHX achieves results identical to those for flash tank economization if the IHX has an effectiveness of 100 %, but the performance of the system with IHX economizing degrades significantly as the heat exchanger effectiveness decreases. ^ Therefore, the cycle with flash tank economization is selected for further study. The basic cycle model with two-stage compression and flash tank economization is modified to consider an increasing number of injection points and a flash tank that can supply two-phase refrigerant. The decrease in the enthalpy of the injected refrigerant and the increased number of injection ports moves the compression process closer to the liquid-vapor dome and therefore decreases the compression work. The number of injection points is then increased to approach the limiting case of continuous injection, which minimizes the compressor power consumption by maintaining a saturated vapor state in the compressor. ^ To improve the accuracy of these cycle model predictions, two comprehensive compressor models are developed. A thermodynamic model of a two-stage rolling piston compressor is developed with consideration for leakage and heat transfer in the compressor. The compressor model is validated by experimental testing of a prototype two-stage rolling piston, and is then used to study the effect of intercooling on the compressor performance. ^ While the two-stage rolling-piston compressor operates with two separate compression chambers in series, the benefits of staging can also be realized by injecting economized refrigerant through ports in a single-stage rotary compressor. Therefore, a model of a novel rotary <b>spool</b> <b>compressor</b> with refrigerant injection is developed to study the effect of multiple injection ports on compressor and cycle performance. The model without injection is validated through experimental testing of a prototype <b>spool</b> <b>compressor</b> and provides a valuable tool for improving the prototype compressor design. ^ The model is then used to predict the compressor performance with a single injection port while varying the port diameter, port location and injection pressure. For an R- 22 cycle operating with an evaporating temperature of – 7. 2 °C, a suction temperature of 7. 6 °C and a condensing temperature of 48. 8 °C, the model predicts that a single injection port will increase the COP of the basic vapor compression cycle by up to 12 %. Incorporating a second injection port increases the COP of the cycle by 16 % over the baseline value without injection. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{conceptual}} design of a two <b>spool</b> <b>compressor</b> for the NASA Large Civil Tilt Rotor engine, which has a design-point pressure ratio goal of 30 : 1 and an inlet weight flow of 30. 0 lbm/sec. The compressor notional design requirements of pressure ratio and low-pressure compressor (LPC) and high pressure ratio compressor (HPC) work split {{were based on a}} previous engine system study to meet the mission requirements of the NASA Subsonic Rotary Wing Projects Large Civil Tilt Rotor vehicle concept. Three mean line compressor design and flow analysis codes were utilized for the conceptual design of a two-spool compressor configuration. This study assesses the technical challenges of design for various compressor configuration options to meet the given engine cycle results. In the process of sizing, the technical challenges of the compressor became apparent as the aerodynamics were taken into consideration. Mechanical constraints were considered in the study such as maximum rotor tip speeds and conceptual sizing of rotor disks and shafts. The rotor clearance-to-span ratio in the last stage of the LPC is 1. 5 % and in the last stage of the HPC is 2. 8 %. Four different configurations to meet the HPC requirements were studied, ranging from a single stage centrifugal, two axi-centrifugals, and all axial stages. Challenges of the HPC design include the high temperature (1, 560 deg R) at the exit which could limit the maximum allowable peripheral tip speed for centrifugals, and is dependent on material selection. The mean line design also resulted in the definition of the flow path geometry of the axial and centrifugal compressor stages, rotor and stator vane angles, velocity components, and flow conditions at the leading and trailing edges of each blade row at the hub, mean and tip. A mean line compressor analysis code was used to estimate the compressor performance maps at off-design speeds and to determine the required variable geometry reset schedules of the inlet guide vane and variable stators that would result in the transonic stages being aerodynamically matched with high efficiency and acceptable stall margins based on user specified maximum levels of rotor diffusion factor and relative velocity ratio...|$|R
