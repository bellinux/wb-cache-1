5|$|Entry to {{the cell}} begins through {{interaction}} of the trimeric envelope complex (gp160 spike) and both CD4 and a <b>chemokine</b> receptor (generally either CCR5 or CXCR4, but others are known to interact) on the cell surface. gp120 binds to integrin α4β7 activating LFA-1 the central integrin involved {{in the establishment of}} virological synapses, which facilitate efficient cell-to-cell spreading of HIV-1. The gp160 spike contains binding domains for both CD4 and <b>chemokine</b> receptors.|$|E
5|$|The {{first step}} in fusion {{involves}} the high-affinity attachment of the CD4 binding domains of gp120 to CD4. Once gp120 is bound with the CD4 protein, the envelope complex undergoes a structural change, exposing the <b>chemokine</b> receptor binding domains of gp120 and allowing them {{to interact with the}} target <b>chemokine</b> receptor. This allows for a more stable two-pronged attachment, which allows the N-terminal fusion peptide gp41 to penetrate the cell membrane. Repeat sequences in gp41, HR1, and HR2 then interact, causing the collapse of the extracellular portion of gp41 into a hairpin. This loop structure brings the virus and cell membranes close together, allowing fusion of the membranes and subsequent entry of the viral capsid.|$|E
5|$|The term {{viral tropism}} {{refers to the}} cell types a virus infects. HIV can infect a variety of immune cells such as CD4+ T cells, macrophages, and microglial cells. HIV-1 entry to macrophages and CD4+ T cells is {{mediated}} through interaction of the virion envelope glycoproteins (gp120) with the CD4 molecule on the target cells and also with <b>chemokine</b> coreceptors.|$|E
50|$|Fifty <b>chemokines</b> {{have been}} {{discovered}} so far, and most bind onto CXC and CC families.

5|$|Inflammation in DPB is {{also caused}} by the <b>chemokine</b> MIP-1alpha and its {{involvement}} with CD8+ T cells. Beta defensins, a family of antimicrobial peptides found in the respiratory tract, are responsible for further inflammation in DPB when a pathogen such as P.aeruginosa is present. If present with DPB, the human T-lymphotropic virus, type I, a retrovirus, modifies DPB pathogenesis by infecting T helper cells and altering their effectiveness in recognizing the presence of known or unknown pathogens involved with DPB.|$|E
5|$|Attachment is a {{specific}} binding between viral capsid proteins and specific receptors on the host cellular surface. This specificity determines the host range of a virus. For example, HIV infects a limited range of human leucocytes. This is because its surface protein, gp120, specifically interacts with the CD4 molecule – a <b>chemokine</b> receptor – which is most commonly found {{on the surface of}} CD4+ T-Cells. This mechanism has evolved to favour those viruses that infect only cells in which they are capable of replication. Attachment to the receptor can induce the viral envelope protein to undergo changes that results in the fusion of viral and cellular membranes, or changes of non-enveloped virus surface proteins that allow the virus to enter.|$|E
25|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} where a point mutation was inserted into the gene encoding the <b>chemokine</b> receptor CXCR2; mutated cells underwent a malignant transformation due to the expression of CXCR2 in an active conformation {{despite the absence of}} chemokine-binding.

This property, combined with some additional inflammatory and growth-regulatory activities, demonstrate their {{crucial role in the}} immune system. <b>Chemokines</b> are low molecular weight proteins and possess a typical positioning of four conserved cysteines. This family is further subdivided in two subfamilies depending on whether the first two cysteines are adjacent or not (CC and CXC <b>chemokines,</b> respectively).

40|$|AbstractAntimicrobial {{peptides}} are {{a diverse}} family of small, mostly cationic polypeptides that kill bacteria, fungi {{and even some}} enveloped viruses, while <b>chemokines</b> are a group of mostly cationic small proteins that induce directed migration of leukocytes through interactions {{with a group of}} seven transmembrane G protein-coupled receptors. Recent studies have shown that antimicrobial peptides and <b>chemokines</b> have substantially overlapping functions. Thus, while some antimicrobial peptides are chemotactic for leukocytes, some <b>chemokines</b> can kill a wide range of bacteria and fungi. Here, we examined a possible direct antiviral activity of <b>chemokines</b> against an enveloped virus HSV- 1. Among 22 human <b>chemokines</b> examined, <b>chemokines</b> such as MIP- 1 α/CCL 3, MIP- 1 β/CCL 4 and RANTES/CCL 5 showed a significant direct antiviral activity against HSV- 1.

40|$|Background—Although <b>chemokines</b> {{have been}} {{suggested}} {{to play an important}} role in Helicobacter pylori associated gastritis, few studies have investigated the role of <b>chemokines</b> other than interleukin 8 (IL- 8) in gastric mucosa.  Aims—To investigate the expression and production patterns of various <b>chemokines</b> using gastric biopsy specimens.  Methods—In 192 patients, expression patterns of C-X-C <b>chemokines</b> (IL- 8 and growth regulated α (GROα)) and C-C <b>chemokines</b> (regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and presumably secreted (RANTES), monocyte chemotactic and activating factor (MCAF), macrophage inflammatory protein 1 α (MIP- 1 α), and MIP- 1 β) were examined using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). cagA gene was identified using PCR.  Results—H pylori infection was associated with increased rates of expression of mRNA for IL- 8, GROα, RANTES, and MIP- 1 α and with increased levels of mucosal IL- 8 and GROα. IL- 8 and GROα levels correlated with the density of H pylori in both the antrum and corpus. The levels of these <b>chemokines</b> correlated with cellular infiltration in the antrum but not the corpus. cagA gene positive H pylori infection was associated with increased rates of expression of mRNA for IL- 8 and GROα and with increased levels of these <b>chemokines.</b>  Conclusion—H pylori infection is associated with increased expression rates and production of C-X-C <b>chemokines</b> (IL- 8 and GROα), but not with increased production of C-C <b>chemokines.</b> Although H pylori infection is associated with increased C-X-C <b>chemokines</b> in the antrum and corpus, there is a difference in the inflammatory response between these two areas of the stomach. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Chemotactic cytokines (<b>chemokines)</b> are {{a family}} of small {{proteins}} inducing directed cell migration (chemotaxis), via specific G-protein coupled receptors. Initially described as molecules regulating leukocyte recruitment at sites of inflammation, in the last decade, {{it has become increasingly}} clear that <b>chemokines</b> mediate several other functions and therefore are more than simple traffick controllers. <b>Chemokines</b> are produced by many different cell types, including tumor cells. Indeed, tumors are major producer of <b>chemokines</b> and have represented an invaluable source for their identification and characterization. In the tumor microenvironment <b>chemokines</b> are crucial regulators of the levels of tumorinfiltrating leukocytes. In addition, these mediators control a variety of biological activities, such as production and deposition of collagen, activation of matrix-digesting enzymes, stimulation of cell growth, inhibition of apoptosis and promotion of neo-angiogenesis. The expression of <b>chemokines,</b> therefore, is of potential advantage for tumor cells and may endow them with enhanced ability to proliferate and disseminate. The complex network of <b>chemokines</b> and their receptors in the tumor microenvironment is currently the object of an intense investigation aimed at targeting these molecules for therapeutic interventions...|$|R

25|$|Experimental and {{epidemiologic}} research {{over the}} past several years has indicated close associations among ROS, chronic inflammation, and cancer. ROS induces chronic inflammation by the induction of COX-2, inflammatory cytokines (TNFα, interleukin 1 (IL-1), IL-6), chemokines (IL-8, CXCR4) and pro-inflammatory transcription factors (NF-κB). These chemokines and <b>chemokine</b> receptors, in turn, promote invasion and metastasis of various tumor types.|$|E

40|$|In this study, we {{demonstrate}} that the CXC family of <b>chemokines</b> displays disparate angiogenic activity depending upon {{the presence or absence}} of the ELR motif. CXC <b>chemokines</b> containing the ELR motif (ELR-CXC <b>chemokines)</b> were found to be potent angiogenic factors, inducing both in vitro endothelial chemotaxis and in vivo corneal neovascularization. In contrast, the CXC <b>chemokines</b> lacking the ELR motif, platelet factor 4, interferon gamma-inducible protein 10, and monokine induced by gamma-interferon, not only failed to induce significant in vitro endothelial cell chemotaxis or in vivo corneal neovacularization but were found to be potent angiostatic factors in the presence of either ELR-CXC <b>chemokines</b> or the unrelated angiogenic factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, Additionally, mutant interleukin-g proteins lacking the ELR motif demonstrated potent angiostatic effects in the presence of either ELR-CXC <b>chemokines</b> or basic fibroblast growth factor, In contrast, a mutant of monokine induced by gamma-interferon containing the ELR motif was found to induce in vivo angiogenic activity, These findings suggest a functional role of the ELR motif in determining the angiogenic or angiostatic potential of CXC <b>chemokines,</b> supporting the hypothesis that the net biological balance between angiogenic and angiostatic CXC <b>chemokines</b> may play an important role in regulating overall angiogenesis. status: publishe...|$|R
