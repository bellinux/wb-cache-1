5|$|A {{laboratory}} test showed how males of P. fimbriata from Queensland minimise {{the risk of}} meeting each other, by recognising fresh pieces of blotting paper, some <b>containing</b> their own silk draglines and some <b>containing</b> another male's draglines. Males also were attracted by fresh blotting paper <b>containing</b> females' draglines, while females {{do not respond to}} fresh blotting paper <b>containing</b> males' draglines. This suggested that the males usually search for females, rather than vice versa. Neither sex responded to one week-old blotting paper, irrespective of whether it contained males' or females' draglines. A similar series of tests showed that P. labiata showed the same patterns of responses between the sexes.|$|E
