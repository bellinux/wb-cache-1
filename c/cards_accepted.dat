In September 1958, Bank of America launched the BankAmericard in Fresno, California, which would become the first successful recognizably modern credit card. This card succeeded where others failed by breaking the chicken-and-egg cycle in which consumers did not want to use a card that few merchants would accept and merchants did not want to accept a card that few consumers used. Bank of America chose Fresno because 45% of its residents used the bank, and by sending a card to 60,000 Fresno residents at once, the bank was able to convince merchants to accept the card. It was eventually licensed to other banks around the United States and then around the world, and in 1976, all BankAmericard licensees united themselves under the common brand Visa. In 1966, the ancestor of MasterCard was born when a group of banks established Master Charge to compete with BankAmericard; it received a significant boost when Citibank merged its own Everything Card, launched in 1967, into Master Charge in 1969.|$|E

The bill compels states to begin redesigning their driver's licenses to comply with federal security standards by December 2009. Federal agencies would reject licenses or identity cards that do not comply, which would force Americans accessing everything from airplanes to national parks and courthouses to have the federally mandated cards. At airports, those not having compliant licenses or cards would simply be redirected to a secondary screening location.

40|$|MBA 2013 ABSTRACT Card {{acceptance}} and processing {{as a form}} factor for payment processing is {{a significant part of}} the South African retail payments landscape. For South African banks, the success of the service delivery model of card payment services to their retail merchants is of critical importance to their success and long term shareholder return on equity, this is as a result of the effect improved service levels has on long term customer loyalty and advocacy. This paper assesses what are the customer service expectations of <b>card</b> <b>accepting</b> merchants in South Africa. With the main objective being to determine using SERVQUAL model (Parasuraman, Zeithaml & Berry, 1990) what are the service attributes that are important in meeting <b>card</b> <b>accepting</b> merchant’s service expectations. A web based self-administered survey was used to gather the data findings, to which 87 merchants completed the questionnaire. The data was analysed for means test ranking using the stochastic search algorithm means test methodology (Stacey, 2006). The ranking was analysed to determine the service attributes from the respondents as ranked by order of importance, further to that significance testing (significance level: 0. 05) was performed on the service attribute means to determine significance of ranking. The findings show that indeed the service attributes and expectation for <b>card</b> <b>accepting</b> merchants do differ to those of other banking services as documented in previous studies. <b>Card</b> <b>accepting</b> merchants rated the following 8 service attributes as the most important in meeting their service expectations;  The Bank performs the service right the first time  Employees of the Bank are knowledgeable and can address my questions appropriately  The Bank's employees are professional  Device uptime & communication systems  Employees of the Bank give you prompt service  The employees of my Bank understand my needs as well as that of my business  You feel safe in your as well as your customer’s transactions with the Bank  The Bank has my best interests at heart as well as that of my business The service dimension Reliability was found to be the most important service dimension as rated by the <b>card</b> <b>accepting</b> merchants. The result also found that some of the service attributes were insignificant in the delivery and meeting of merchants customer service expectations. For example service attributes like “The Bank has operating hours convenient to my business' needs and The Bank's employees provide me with personal attention as their client” were found to be insignificant Customer service expectations are not static and differ based on business segment and demographics (Sureshchandar, Rajendran & Anantharaman, 2003 and Reichfield, 2003), the findings of this research also confirm the need for banks to constantly assess the changing needs of their customers and merchants and built service models with attributes that aims to meet or exceed on the service expectation...|$|R

40|$|Many {{public transit}} {{agencies}} are considering direct acceptance of contactless credit and debit cards (collectively contactless bankcards) at gates in rail stations and on board buses. Concerns {{have been raised}} about riders {{who may not have}} or may not want to use contactless bankcards for transit fare payments. This thesis presents contactless prepaid cards as a potential fare payment option {{to meet the needs of}} these riders, and assesses customer attitudes toward contactless prepaid cards and bankcards. Two case studies are presented of transit agencies planning to implement contactless bankcard fare collection systems: Transport for London and the Chicago Transit Authority. A framework for evaluation of transit prepaid card options addresses two independent policy decisions: card function, or how the prepaid card may be used, and program management, the companies that partner with transit agencies to provide prepaid cards. The two card function options are: open loop <b>cards,</b> <b>accepted</b> at any merchant, or closed loop cards, used only for transit. Five possible program management options are addressed: the transit agency, bill payment companies, prepaid card companies, general payment card companies, and financial institutions. Options are analyzed along three primary dimensions: customer experience, cost, and geographic coverage of card servicing locations. The results show that closed loop and open loop cards may potentially have comparable costs for both the Chicago Transit Authority and Transport for London, although there is substantial uncertainty since no programs have yet been implemented. The cost and revenue uncertainties are higher for open loop cards than for closed loop cards. For all program management options, both transit agencies appear to face a tradeoff between costs and geographic coverage. Transit agency survey data is used to assess demand for contactless prepaid and bankcards. The results show that a small percentage of riders lacks both credit and debit cards and may have to use prepaid cards. Moreover, the majority of riders in London prefer closed loop prepaid cards, and most riders in Chicago prefer current fare media over bankcards. Discrete choice models are used to analyze factors influencing the choice between bankcards, prepaid cards, and other fare media for riders in London and Chicago. While trends among ridership groups are not strong, age and availability of payment instruments appear to influence fare media choice. by Candace Elizabeth Brakewood. Thesis (S.

The Discover Card was also noteworthy for being the only credit <b>card</b> <b>accepted</b> by the U.S. Customs Service to pay customs duty, effective Feb. 19, 1987.
