40|$|Buildings {{constitute}} {{a very large}} part of the total energy consumption in the world. In order to avoid heat losses according to stricter regulations, building envelope thicknesses are increasing continually when applying traditional thermal insulation materials. Vacuum insulation panels (VIPs) allow the combination of high thermal insulation and thin building envelopes, but unfortunately VIPs are suffering from ageing effects and lack of flexibility and robustness. This work investigates the possibilities of inventing and developing innovative and robust highly thermal insulating materials. That is, within this work the objective is to go beyond VIPs and other current state-of-the-art technologies. New concepts are introduced, e. g. vacuum insulation materials (VIMs), nano insulation materials (NIMs), gas insulation materials (GIMs) and dynamic insulation materials (DIMs). These materials may have <b>closed</b> <b>pore</b> structures (VIMs and GIMs) or either open or <b>closed</b> <b>pore</b> structures (NIMs). The DIMs aim at controlling the thermal conductivity. Fundamental theoretical studies aimed at developing an understanding of the basics of thermal conductance in solid state matter at an elementary and atomic level have been addressed. The ultimate goal is to develop tailor-made novel high performance thermal insulation materials and dynamic insulation materials, the latter one enabling to control and regulate the thermal conductivity in the materials themselves, i. e. from highly insulating to highly conducting. Furthermore, requirements of the future high performance thermal insulation materials and solutions have been proposed. Currently, the NIMs seem to represent the best high performance low conductivity thermal solution for the foreseeable future, while DIMs, if they can be made robust and practical, have great potential due to their thermal insulation regulating abilities. status: publishe...|$|E
