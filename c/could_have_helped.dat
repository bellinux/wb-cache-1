5|$|Historians {{have varied}} interpretations of Marshall's vice presidency. Claire Suddath rated Marshall {{as one of}} the worst vice presidents in American history in a 2008 Time {{magazine}} article. Samuel Eliot Morison wrote that had Marshall carried out his constitutional duties, assumed the presidency, and made the concessions necessary for the passage of the League of Nations treaty in late 1920, the United States would have been much more involved in European affairs and <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>helped</b> prevent the rise of Adolf Hitler, which began in the following year. Morison {{and a number of other}} historians claim that Marshall's decision was an indirect cause of the Second World War. Charles Thomas, one of Marshall's biographers, wrote that although Marshall's assumption of the presidency would have made World War II much less likely, modern hypothetical speculation on the subject was unfair to Marshall, who made the correct decision in not forcibly removing Wilson from office, even temporarily.|$|E
5|$|In North Indian manuscripts of the Ramayana, some interpolations {{elaborate}} Tara's lament. Tara {{mentions the}} hardships of widowhood and prefers death to it. She blames Rama for unjustly killing Vali and tells him {{that if they had}} forged an alliance, Vali <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>helped</b> him recover Sita. Tara invokes the power of her chastity and curses Rama so that he will soon lose Sita after he regains her. She declares that Sita will return to the earth. The curse also appears in the North-western Indian manuscripts. In several vernacular adaptations of the Ramayana like the Oriya Vilanka Ramayana by Sarala Dasa, Tara's curse is reiterated. Apart from the usual curse to Rama of his separation from Sita, in the Bengali Krittivasi Ramayana, Tara additionally curses Rama that in his next birth, he will be killed by Vali. The Mahanataka and the Ananda Ramayana narrate that Vali is reborn as the hunter who kills Krishna, Rama's next birth.|$|E

5|$|Miles, {{who just}} wants a normal life, is unhappy about having these abilities, and {{initially}} nauseated {{at the idea}} of risking his life to engage in superheroics, a reaction that Bendis wrote to further contrast Miles with Parker. However, after witnessing Spider-Man's death {{at the hands of the}} Green Goblin, the guilt-ridden Miles realizes he <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>helped.</b> After Ganke suggests he assume the mantle of Spider-Man, and learns from Gwen Stacy why Parker did what he did, Miles is inspired to try his hand at costumed crimefighting. During his first foray into costumed superheroics, he is confronted not only by those who feel his use of the Spider-Man costume is in bad taste, but also by Spider-Woman, a member of the government superhuman team, the Ultimates, over his use of the Spider-Man identity.|$|E
5|$|Plague doctors traversed {{the streets}} {{diagnosing}} victims, {{although many of}} them had no formal medical training. Several public health efforts were attempted. Physicians were hired by city officials and burial details were carefully organized, but panic spread through the city and, out of the fear of contagion, people were hastily buried in overcrowded pits. The means of transmission of the disease were not known but thinking they might be linked to the animals, the City Corporation ordered a cull of dogs and cats. This decision may have affected the length of the epidemic since those animals <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>helped</b> keep in check the rat population carrying the fleas which transmitted the disease. Thinking bad air was involved in transmission, the authorities ordered giant bonfires to be burned in the streets and house fires to be kept burning night and day, in hopes that the air would be cleansed. Tobacco was thought to be a prophylactic and it was later said that no London tobacconist had died from the plague during the epidemic.|$|E
5|$|The {{blunt and}} short claws of Deinocheirus {{are similar to}} those of the therizinosaur Alxasaurus, which {{indicates}} the long arms and claws were used for digging and gathering plants. The blunt claws of the feet <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>helped</b> the animal from sinking into substrate when wading. The robust hind limbs and hip region indicates the animal moved slowly. The large size of the animal may have helped it against predators such as Tarbosaurus, but in turn it lost the running ability of other ornithomimosaurs. The long neural spines and possible tail fan may have been used for display behaviour. Deinocheirus was likely diurnal (active during the day), since the sclerotic rings of the eyes were relatively small in comparison with its skull length. The hand had good mobility relative to the lower arm, but was capable of only a limited flexing motion, unable to close in grasping.|$|E

5|$|Darwin's {{interest}} on the biology of reef organisms was focussed on aspects related to his geological idea of subsidence; in particular, {{he was looking for}} confirmation that the reef building organisms could only live at shallow depths. FitzRoy's soundings at the Keeling Islands gave a depth limit for live coral of about 20fathoms (37m), and taking into account numerous observations by others, Darwin worked with a probable limit of 30fathoms (55m). Modern findings suggest a limit of around 100m, still {{a small fraction of the}} depth of the ocean floor at 3000â€“5000m. Darwin recognised the importance of red algae, and he reviewed other organisms that <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>helped</b> to build the reefs. He thought they lived at similarly shallow depths, but banks formed at greater depths were found in the 1880s. Darwin reviewed the distribution of different species of coral across a reef. He thought that the seaward reefs most exposed to wind and waves were formed by massive corals and red algae; this would be the most active area of reef growth and so would cause a tendency for reefs to grow outwards once they reach sea level. He believed that higher temperatures and the calmer water of the lagoons favoured the greatest coral diversity. These ecological ideas are still current, and research on the details continues.|$|E
5|$|At {{his trial}} in Clearwater, Florida, Chandler {{said that he}} met the Rogers women and gave them directions, but he never saw them again except in {{newspaper}} coverage and on billboards. He never told the authorities {{that he had seen}} the women again. He acknowledged that he was on Tampa Bay that nightthe police had evidence of three ship-to-shore telephone calls made from his boat to his home during the time frame of the murdersbut Chandler maintained that he was fishing alone. He claimed that he had returned home late because his engine would not start, which he attributed to a gas line leak. He said that he had called the Coast Guard and the Florida Marine Patrol, and had flagged down a patrol boat, but both were too busy to help. He said that he subsequently fixed the line with duct tape and returned safely to shore. However, there were no records of distress calls from Chandler to either the Coast Guard or the Marine Patrol that night, nor were there any Coast Guard boats on the bay the following morning that <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>helped</b> him. According to a boat mechanic, who testified for the prosecution, Chandler's explanation of repairing the boat's alleged gas leak was not tenable because the fuel lines in his boata Baylinerwere directed upward. A leak would have sprayed fuel into the air rather than into the boat, and the corrosive gasoline would have eaten away the adhesive properties of the duct tape Chandler maintained he had used to repair the purported leak. Under interrogation from Pinellas County prosecutor, Douglas Crow, Chandler then said he could not remember.|$|E

25|$|Although {{there are}} reports of an {{eruption}} {{at the time of the}} earthquake, most sources suggest that the volcano had been inactive since the destructive eruption of 1669. Analysis of the relationship between eruptions and earthquakes has found that earthquakes are followed by long periods without activity in the 'rift zones' that extend out to north and south from the summit. Estimates of coulomb stress transfer due to the dyke intrusion in the rift zones associated with the 1669 eruption, suggest that this <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>helped</b> to trigger the 1693 earthquake, by increasing stress levels on the faults.|$|E
25|$|Nopcsa {{theorized that}} {{increasing}} {{the surface area}} of the outstretched arms <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>helped</b> small cursorial predators keep their balance, and that the scales of the forearms elongated, evolving into feathers.

Nopcsa also proposed three stages in the evolution of flight. First, animals developed passive flight, in which developing wing structures served as a sort of parachute. Second, they achieved active flight by flapping the wings. He used Archaeopteryx as an example of this second stage. Finally, birds gained the ability to soar.|$|E

25|$|Peretz saw an {{intrinsic}} connection between {{a solution to}} the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the resolving of Israel's internal social tensions. He argued that the resources allotted to the settlements in the West Bank had diverted funds that <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>helped</b> to solve social problems throughout Israel. He described the conflict as having mutated Israeli politics, so that the traditional left-right distinctions did not hold. Instead of supporting a social-democratic left that would advance their cause, the lower classes, mostly of Middle Eastern Jewish origins, were diverted to the right by the fanning of nationalist tendencies. Concurrently, the left in Israel was usurped by the well-to-do, so that the Labor party had ironically become elitist. Peretz also backed direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian movement Hamas.|$|E
25|$|While a {{proposal}} to bring pro football back to the Los Angeles area {{was still in the}} works (at the time), there had been little action taken in recent times of bringing an NFL team to the Coliseum.

25|$|British {{historian}} Richard J. Evans {{wrote that}} although the expulsions of ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe was done in an extremely brutal manner {{that could not be}} defended, the basic aim of expelling the ethnic German population of Poland and Czechoslovakia was justified by the subversive role played by the German minorities before World War II. Evans wrote that under the Weimar Republic the vast majority of ethnic Germans in Poland and Czechoslovakia {{made it clear that they}} were not loyal to the states they happened to live under, and under the Third Reich the German minorities in Eastern Europe were willing tools of German foreign policy. Evans also wrote that many areas of eastern Europe featured a jumble of various ethnic groups aside from Germans, and that it was the destructive role played by ethnic Germans as instruments of Nazi Germany that led to their expulsion after the war. Evans concluded by positing that the expulsions were justified as they put an end to a major problem that plagued Europe before the war; that gains to the cause of peace were a further benefit of the expulsions; and that if the Germans had been allowed to remain in Eastern Europe after the war, West Germany would have used their presence to make territorial claims against Poland and Czechoslovakia, and that given the Cold War, this <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>helped</b> cause World War III.|$|E
