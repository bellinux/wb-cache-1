I am sure that if the letter writers would consult the facts, they would join with all others not only in hoping this act would become law but in working for its speedy passage and approval.|$|E
2500|$|In 1950, Darcel had a Vaudeville act, {{which was}} panned {{by at least}} one reviewer. About Darcel's {{performance}} 5 May 1950, at the Strand in New York, the Billboard review said: [...] "Denise Darcel showed her well-stacked chassis ... but her heavily accented English sounded like so much gibberish; it got laughs instead of attention. ... her singing is inadequate, her over-use of hands and arms is clumsy and she shows herself <b>completely</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> in handling hecklers." ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs Griffith, for {{the first}} time in her life, was <b>completely</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> for words.|$|E
60|$|All this time, {{the mate}} {{was holding his}} peace; and Wilson, now <b>completely</b> abashed, and <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> what to do, took him by the arm, and walked across the deck. Returning to the cabin-scuttle, after a close conversation, he {{abruptly}} addressed the sailors, without taking any further notice of what had just happened.|$|R
6000|$|... "It was {{a terrible}} affair," [...] he admitted, [...] "and, as Mr. Bellamy has told you, it {{occurred}} within a few steps of my office. So far, too, the police seem <b>completely</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> loss." ...|$|R
60|$|She hesitated. She {{had not yet}} {{learned to}} use the word patronize in the social sense, and she was <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> to {{describe}} the attitude of Mrs. Duncan and her daughter, though her instinct had registered it. She was <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> to account for Mr. Worthington's attitude, too. Mr. Sutton's she bitterly resented.|$|R
60|$|Joseph was <b>completely</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> what to say. He {{began to}} show evident marks of embarrassment and confusion.|$|E
60|$|He was <b>completely</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> to {{understand}} what she meant, and he said so plainly. Instead of explaining herself, she put a question.|$|E
60|$|Stanley had {{not thought}} of this point and, for a time, was <b>completely</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss.</b> His own hair was now short, and could not {{possibly}} be turned up.|$|E
60|$|I was <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> to {{know whether}} this were coquetry or innocence.|$|R
60|$|Jet was wholly <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> to {{know what}} course should be pursued.|$|R
60|$|MORELL (quite <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss).</b> Yes. No. I don't {{know what}} you mean.|$|R
60|$|She {{never spoke}} {{of it to}} anyone except to her confessor, and he, a simple-minded man of great {{learning}} and a total {{lack of knowledge of}} the world, was <b>completely</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> how to advise.|$|E
60|$|He {{had often}} dealt with such {{situations}} in his books, {{and now that}} one had come true was <b>completely</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss.</b> He could not even begin to remember what was usually said or done, and he only made little soothing noises.|$|E
60|$|There was {{no mistaking}} the earnestness with which he made that reply. It proved his innocence as nothing else could have proved it. Lady Janet drew back a step--utterly bewildered; <b>completely</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> what to say or what to do next.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Rushworth, who {{saw nothing}} but her son, was quite <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss.</b>|$|R
50|$|Bagatelle {{closed in}} September 2014 after having {{operated}} <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> for several years.|$|R
60|$|Again Mrs. Banks <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> for words, {{looked at}} her {{daughter}} for assistance.|$|R
60|$|Dan {{took the}} paper with the written {{directions}} upon it, feeling more <b>completely</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> {{to know how to}} proceed than he had before, and it was in a dazed way that he listened to the instructions as to how he should find the nearest Hardy.|$|E
60|$|Cassandra, too, gave an indescribably slight {{movement}} {{which seemed}} to draw {{the three of them}} into alliance together. Katharine's tone and glance made Mr. Hilbery once more feel <b>completely</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss,</b> and in addition, painfully and angrily obsolete; but in spite of an awful inner hollowness he was outwardly composed.|$|E
6000|$|VALENTINE (turning {{near the}} door). Because I am mortally afraid of her; {{and it looks}} as if she were mortally afraid of me. (He turns to go and finds himself face to face with Gloria, who has just entered. She looks steadfastly at him. He stares helplessly at her; then round at Mrs. Clandon; then at Gloria again, <b>completely</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss.)</b> ...|$|E
60|$|PAUL. But I'm still <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> to {{know exactly}} what you're talking about.|$|R
60|$|Raymond smiled, and Madam Rachel seemed <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> to {{know what}} to say.|$|R
60|$|The three stood <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss.</b> She {{kept the}} two men hesitating near her.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] Cassandra allowed once more. She was <b>completely</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss.</b> In her {{forecast}} {{of the interview}} she had taken {{it for granted that}} Katharine, after an outburst of incredulity, would agree that Cassandra must return home as soon as possible. But Katharine, on the contrary, accepted her statement at once, seemed neither shocked nor surprised, and merely looked rather more thoughtful than usual. From being a mature woman charged with an important mission, Cassandra shrunk to the stature of an inexperienced child.|$|E
6000|$|Now {{that he had}} his chance, he was <b>completely</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss.</b> The {{sight of}} the face {{emerging}} from that lump of 'putty stuff' had quite unnerved him. The notion of this young man working at it up here all by himself, {{just because he was}} away an hour or two from the original, touched him. How on earth to say what he had come to say? It was altogether different from what he had thought. And it suddenly flashed through him--Dolly was right! She's always right--hang it! ...|$|E
6000|$|... “We shall soon know,” I exclaimed; and at {{the same}} moment I stepped forward towards our guides, and pronouncing the two names interrogatively, and {{pointing}} to the lowest part of the valley, endeavoured to come to the point at once. They repeated the words after me again and again, but without giving any peculiar emphasis to either, so that I was <b>completely</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> to understand them; for a couple of wilier young things than we afterwards found them to have been on this particular occasion never probably fell in any traveller’s way.|$|E
5000|$|... {{transfers}} of value, <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> to the donor, {{have been made}} to certain trusts ...|$|R

60|$|All {{the other}} reporters being away on their duties, the editor was <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss.</b>|$|R
60|$|There was {{a passion}} of mature grief in this tone of appeal. And yet she {{remained}} as touching and helpless as a distressed child. It {{had all the}} simplicity and depth of a child’s emotion. It tugged at one’s heart-strings in the same direct way. But what could one do? How could one soothe her? It was impossible to pat her on the head, take her on the knee, give her a chocolate or show her a picture-book. I found myself absolutely without resource. <b>Completely</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss.</b>|$|E
6000|$|With {{all their}} {{national}} aptitude at expedient and resource, Wyeth {{and his men}} felt themselves <b>completely</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> {{when they reached the}} frontier, and found that the wilderness required experience and habitudes of which they were totally deficient. Not one of the party, excepting the leader, had ever seen an Indian or handled a rifle; they were without guide or interpreter, and totally unacquainted with [...] "wood craft" [...] and the modes of making their way among savage hordes, and subsisting themselves during long marches over wild mountains and barren plains.|$|E
60|$|One of the {{partners}} in the legal firm had called that morning, to see Regina on a matter of business. Mrs. Farnaby had appeared at the office on the previous day, and had briefly expressed her wish {{to make a small}} annual provision for her niece, in case of future need. Declining to enter into any explanation, she had waited until the necessary document had been drawn out; had requested that Regina might be informed of the circumstance; and had then taken her departure in absolute silence. Hearing that she had left her husband, the lawyer, like every one else, was <b>completely</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> to understand what it meant.|$|E
5000|$|... that I {{can neither}} agree to nor deny; I am <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> what to say.|$|R
