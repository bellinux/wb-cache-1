25|$|An {{important}} aspect of the preparation of soul food was the reuse of cooking lard. Because many cooks could not afford to buy new shortening to replace what they used, they would pour the liquefied cooking grease into a container. After <b>cooling</b> <b>completely,</b> the grease re-solidified and could be used again the next time the cook required lard.|$|R
50|$|After {{the bell}} and {{equipment}} has <b>cooled</b> <b>completely,</b> the mould, containing the newly cast bell, is raised from the pit by the projecting trunnions {{of the bell}} case. The core plate is unclamped and the core broken out. The bell is then carefully extracted from the case. At this stage, any remaining loam still adhered to the bell is brushed away and flash (excess metal), which may have formed below the bell rim—owing to mould contraction {{in the presence of}} hot metal—is trimmed off. This completes the casting process.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} manufacture of water refrigeration for magneto clutch. MR clutch cooling problem was solved by designing of several variants of which was finally chosen the best. Model of water cooling was developed and subsequently made. The cooling is consolidated on a stator of MR clutch. <b>Cooling</b> <b>completely</b> surrounds the body of an MR clutch and thus achieves a high heat transfer between the cooling system and cooled. The proposal was developed {{with a view to}} good foldability, so its use is not complicated...|$|R
50|$|The {{winter melon}} picked should be plump {{enough to hold}} {{sufficient}} flesh and juice. The winter melon is then later on peeled, sliced, and its seeds are completely removed. The winter melon slices are stirred and cooked in boiling water with brown sugar and caramel for many hours. This mixture of soup will be filtered by net or gauze, ridding it of the dregs and impurities. Once the clean, brown liquid <b>cools</b> <b>completely,</b> it is then refrigerated, canned and sold as concentrated winter melon punch. It can also be dehydrated and cut into solid cubes known and sold as winter melon punch cubes.|$|R
50|$|Spatter cones and spatter ramparts are {{typically}} formed by lava fountaining associated with mafic, highly fluid lavas, {{such as those}} erupted in the Hawaiian Islands. As blobs of molten lava, spatter, are erupted into the air by a lava fountain, they can lack {{the time needed to}} <b>cool</b> <b>completely</b> before hitting the ground. Consequently, the spatter are not fully solid, like taffy, as they land and they bind to the underlying spatter as both often slowly ooze {{down the side of the}} cone. As a result, the spatter builds up a cone that is composed of spatter either agglutinated or welded to each other.|$|R

30|$|Another {{problem of}} this surgery is {{dissection}} of the adhesion {{of the heart}} with its pericardium {{and that of the}} functioning grafts with surrounding tissue. Impairment of living grafts during the re-sternotomy or the dissection of adhesions might result in lethal complications [2, 3] such as myocardial infarction, perioperative circulatory insufficiency, or postoperative low-output syndrome. A low-output electrocautery is very effective in dissention of adhesion. We could dissect completely the adhesion of the heart with its pericardium and all length of functioning grafts in an appropriate time without any injury. The entire dissection of the heart adhesion with its pericardium could make the effects of topical <b>cooling</b> <b>completely,</b> which is another key factor of myocardial protection than cardioplegia and might play a considerable role in our success in this operation.|$|R
