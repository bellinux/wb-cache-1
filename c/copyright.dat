5|$|Another {{range of}} {{extensions}} came {{in relation to}} what could be copyrighted. The Statute only referred to books, and being an Act of Parliament, {{it was necessary to}} pass further legislation to include various other types of intellectual property. The Engraving <b>Copyright</b> Act 1734 extended <b>copyright</b> to cover engravings, statutes in 1789 and 1792 involved cloth, sculptures were copyrighted in 1814 and the performance of plays and music were covered by <b>copyright</b> in 1833 and 1842 respectively. The length of <b>copyright</b> was also altered; the <b>Copyright</b> Act 1814 set a <b>copyright</b> term of either 28 years, or the natural life of the author if this was longer. Despite these expansions, some still felt <b>copyright</b> was not a strong enough regime. In 1837, Thomas Noon Talfourd introduced a bill into Parliament to expand the scope of <b>copyright.</b> A friend of many men of letters, Talfourd aimed to provide adequate rewards for authors and artists. He campaigned for <b>copyright</b> to exist {{for the life of the}} author, with an additional 60 years after that. He also proposed that existing statutes be codified under the bill, so that the case law that had arisen around the Statute of Anne was clarified.|$|E

5|$|Moral {{rights in}} United Kingdom law {{are parts of}} <b>copyright</b> law that protect the {{personal}} interests of {{the author of a}} copyrighted work, as well as the economic interests protected by other elements of <b>copyright.</b> Found in the <b>Copyright,</b> Designs and Patents Act 1988, the moral rights are the right to be identified as the author of a work, known as the right of paternity, the right to object to derogatory treatment of a work, known as the right of integrity, the right not to be identified as the author of someone else's work, and the right to privacy. The right of paternity exists for the entire <b>copyright</b> term, and requires individuals who commercially broadcast, sell, perform or exhibit literary, dramatic, musical or artistic works to identify the author of the work – but this does not apply to things such as typefaces, encyclopaedias or works subject to crown <b>copyright.</b>|$|E

5|$|On 9 February 1733, Faulkner advertised {{his future}} {{publication}} of Swift's collected works in four volumes in the Dublin Journal.

In the 1980s, Apple litigated two <b>copyright</b> cases with central issues that included the question of whether object code (as contrasted with source code) of a computer program is subject to <b>copyright</b> laws. A third case in which Apple was not a party but that involved the Apple decisions followed in New Zealand. The specific cases were Computer Edge Pty. Ltd. v Apple Computer Inc. (1986, Australia) ("Computer Edge"), Apple Computer Inc. v Mackintosh Computers Ltd., (Canada, 1987) ("Apple v. Mackintosh"), and IBM v. Computer Imports Ltd. ("IBM v.

5|$|In these {{conflict}} of laws cases, Apple met with conflicting international judicial opinions: an Australian court decision conflicted with a Canadian court decision on the copyrightability of object code. In IBM v. Computer Imports, the High Court of New Zealand then considered these prior decisions and sided with the Canadian decision in ruling that, although object code is not an original literary work in its own right, it is a reproduction of source code in material form and therefore an infringement of <b>copyright</b> takes place if it is copied without the authorization of the <b>copyright</b> owner. Such legal conflicts affected not only Apple, but all other software companies as well, and the conflicts remained unresolved until {{the creation of an}} international legal regime embodied in further changes to national <b>copyright</b> laws, which ultimately made object code subject to <b>copyright</b> law. These revisions of law in favor of making object code subject to <b>copyright</b> law are still controversial. The revisions also form the technical underpinnings (via the Digital Millennium <b>Copyright</b> Act (DMCA) and the Electronic Communications Privacy Act) for the legal notions of electronic privacy violation and computer trespass, as well as the further development of anti-hacking law-making such as the Patriot Act and the Convention on Cybercrime.|$|E

5|$|Once {{registration}} {{had been}} completed and the deposits were made, the author was granted an exclusive right to control the copying of the book. Penalties for infringing this right were severe, with all infringing copies to be destroyed and large fines {{to be paid to}} both the <b>copyright</b> holder and the government; there was only a three-month statute of limitations on bringing a case, however. This exclusive right's length was dependent on when the book had been published. If it was published after 10 April 1710, the length of <b>copyright</b> was 14 years; if published before that date, 21 years. An author who survived until the <b>copyright</b> expired would be granted an additional 14-year term, and when that ran out, the works would enter the public domain. <b>Copyright</b> under the Statute applied to Scotland and England, as well as Ireland when that country joined the union in 1800.|$|E
