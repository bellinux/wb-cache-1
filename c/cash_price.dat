25|$|In 1851 Bishop Edward Field {{describes}} Battle Harbour as {{probably the}} oldest, {{as well as}} the largest settlement on the Labrador coast. The men who came and stayed there were generally from the Island of Newfoundland that used to bring with them servants from Dorset. Some of the first permanent residents were fishermen, carpenters and coopers from Poole, Dorset, Fogo Island and New World Island. As the community grew, there became an increasing need for supplies and merchants took full advantage of that where in some cases local residents paid as much as 100% beyond the regular <b>cash</b> <b>price</b> for goods. The exclusive monopoly was not challenged until 1918, when Battle Harbour's first co-operative was set up, through the initiative of Dr. Wilfred Grenfell.|$|E
25|$|Expiry (or Expiration in the U.S.) is {{the time}} and the day that a {{particular}} delivery month of a futures contract stops trading, as well as the final settlement price for that contract. For many equity index and Interest rate future contracts (as well as for most equity options), this happens on the third Friday of certain trading months. On this day the t+1 futures contract becomes the t futures contract. For example, for most CME and CBOT contracts, at the expiration of the December contract, the March futures become the nearest contract. This is an exciting time for arbitrage desks, which try to make quick profits during the short period (perhaps 30 minutes) during which the underlying <b>cash</b> <b>price</b> and the futures price sometimes struggle to converge. At this moment the futures and the underlying assets are extremely liquid and any disparity between an index and an underlying asset is quickly traded by arbitrageurs. At this moment also, the increase in volume is caused by traders rolling over positions to the next contract or, in the case of equity index futures, purchasing underlying components of those indexes to hedge against current index positions. On the expiry date, a European equity arbitrage trading desk in London or Frankfurt will see positions expire in as many as eight major markets almost every half an hour.|$|E

40|$|This study applies linear and {{nonlinear}} Granger causality {{tests to}} examine the dynamic relation between London Metal Exchange (LME) <b>cash</b> <b>prices</b> and three possible predictors. The analysis uses matched quarterly inventory, UK Treasury bill interest rates, futures <b>prices</b> and <b>cash</b> <b>prices</b> for the commodity lead traded on the LME. The effects of cointegration on both linear and nonlinear Granger causality tests is also examined. When cointegration is not modelled, evidence is found of both linear and nonlinear causality between <b>cash</b> <b>prices</b> and analysed predictor variables. However, after controlling for cointegration, evidence of significant nonlinear causality is no longer found. These results contribute to the empirical literature on commodity price forecasting by highlighting the relationship between cointegration and detectable linear and nonlinear causality. The importance of interest rate and inventory as well as futures <b>price</b> in forecasting <b>cash</b> <b>prices</b> is also illustrated. Failure to detect significant nonlinearity after controlling for cointegration may also go some way to explaining {{the reason for the}} disappointing forecasting performances of many nonlinear models in the general finance literature. It may be that the variables are correct, but the functional form is overly complex and a standard VAR or VECM may often apply. ...|$|R

2500|$|With {{respect to}} items {{that may be}} sold with vendor financing, for example, {{automobile}} leasing, the notional cost of the good may effectively be hidden and the APR subsequently rendered meaningless. An example {{is a case where}} an automobile is leased to a customer based on a [...] "manufacturer's suggested retail price" [...] with a low APR: the vendor may be accepting a lower lease rate as a trade-off against a higher sale price. Had the customer self-financed, a discounted sales price may have been accepted by the vendor; in other words, the customer has received cheap financing in exchange for paying a higher purchase price, and the quoted APR understates the true cost of the financing. In this case, the only meaningful way to establish the [...] "true" [...] APR would involve arranging financing through other sources, determining the lowest-acceptable <b>cash</b> <b>price</b> and comparing the financing terms (which may not be feasible in all circumstances). For leases where the lessee has a purchase option {{at the end of the}} lease term, the cost of the APR is further complicated by this option. In effect, the lease includes a put option back to the manufacturer (or, alternatively, a call option for the consumer), and the value (or cost) of this option to the consumer is not transparent.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this project {{was to determine if}} cash purchased supreme alfalfa hay in Tulare, CA could be cross-hedged by dairy farmers with a single commodity that is exchanged on the board in order to manage the volatility of alfalfa prices. The first objective was to find commodities that are traded on the board that could potentially be used to cross-hedge cash purchased or grown alfalfa. Three commodities that are similar to alfalfa were selected. The commodities were soybeans, soybean meal, and No. 2 yellow corn. The fourth commodity used was crude oil because fuel is a large cost in the farming of alfalfa. Monthly average futures contract prices and monthly average <b>cash</b> <b>prices</b> of all of the commodities were found from 2005 to 2013. The monthly average <b>cash</b> <b>prices</b> paid to farmers in California and the U. S., the monthly average <b>cash</b> <b>prices</b> paid for alfalfa in the U.
