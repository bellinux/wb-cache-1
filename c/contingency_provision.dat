40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{document}} parent presentation of the Lidcombe Program verbal contingencies and model potential relationships between <b>contingency</b> <b>provision</b> and treatment duration. Methods: Forty parent-child pairs undertaking the Lidcombe Program participated, 26 of whom completed Stage 1. All participants were included in the analyses. Parents completed weekly audio-recordings of treatment during practice sessions and a diary of treatment during natural conversations. The number and types of contingencies provided during practice sessions were counted for 520 recordings. Accelerated failure time modeling was used to investigate associations between <b>contingency</b> <b>provision</b> during the first 4 weeks of treatment and duration of time to complete Stage 1. Results: During practice sessions 91 % of contingencies were for stutter-free speech, 6. 8 % were for stuttering and 2. 7 % were incorrectly applied. Parents often combined several verbal contingencies into one. During natural conversations, the number of verbal contingencies reportedly provided across the day was low, an average of 8. 5 (SD = 7. 82) contingencies for stutter-free speech and 1. 7 (SD = 2. 43) for unambiguous stuttering. There was a positive, significant relationship between the number of verbal contingencies for stuttering provided during the first 4 weeks of treatment and time taken to complete Stage 1. Conclusion: Parents mostly provided the expected types of contingencies but the number was lower than expected. An unexpected association was found between number of verbal contingencies for stuttering and treatment duration. Further research is required to explore the relation between rates of parent verbal contingencies, treatment process duration, and treatment outcome...|$|E
40|$|In {{this article}} we {{introduce}} a relatively new method for deciding <b>contingency</b> <b>provisions</b> in insurance ratemaking {{by the use of}} proportional hazard(PH) transforms. This method is easy to understand, simple to use, and supported by theoretical properties as well as economic jnstification. After an introduction of the PH-transform method, we show through examples how it can be used in pricing ambiguous risks, excess-of-loss coverages, increased limits, and risk portfolios with dependency risk. We also show how a minimum rate-on-line can be achieved. As well, we propose a right-tail index for insurance risks. 292...|$|R
40|$|The {{implications}} of uncertainty {{for the design}} of contracts and of remedies for their breach are studied. After characterizing complete contingent contracts, incomplete contracts are examined. Specifically, in view of difficulties in making contingent provisions (costs of enumeration and of bargaining; verification of occurrence of events), it is shown for which <b>contingencies</b> <b>provisions</b> are made. Then, in the major part of the paper, two important implicit substitute for contingent terms are analyzed. The first is provided by remedies for breach of contract; for when a party must pay damages for breach, he will be induced to fulfill his obligations in approximately those contingencies which would have been agreed upon under the terms of a detailed contract. The second substitute for contingent terms lies in the opportunity for renegotiation in light of circumstances, since renegotiation will occur in more or less those contingencies where the contract terms would have differed under a more detailed agreement. ...|$|R

However, cost overruns are a worldwide phenomenon and pose {{a serious threat}} to the development of telecommunication infrastructure, which is the platform for ICT. It is imperative to examine the possible factors that could lead to cost overruns, in order to avert the associated catalytic effects on the development of other sectors of the economy. This study involves a questionnaire survey of 42 factors that were identified as having the potential to cause cost overruns in 53 telecommunication projects that are scattered over the six geopolitical zones in Nigeria. The results indicated that construction-related factors top the list of categories that cause cost overruns in telecommunication projects. The following factors were identified as major causes of cost overruns and are ranked in their order of importance: the lack of contractor experience on the telecommunication projects, the high cost of imported materials and the fluctuation in the prices of materials that are necessary for the telecommunication projects. The study recommends that <b>contingency</b> <b>provisions</b> should be put in place to mitigate these factors at the project conception stage...|$|R
40|$|Outsourcing of IT {{services}} has received much {{attention in the}} information systems literature. However, there has been considerably less attention paid to actual contract structures used in IT outsourcing. Examining contract structures yields important insights into how the contracting parties structure the governance provisions and the factors or transaction risks that influence them. Based on insights from prior literature, from practicing legal experts and through in-depth content analysis of actual contracts we develop a comprehensive coding scheme that captures contract provisions across four major dimensions: monitoring, dispute resolution, property rights protection, and <b>contingency</b> <b>provisions.</b> We then develop an empirical dataset describing the contract structures across these distinct dimensions using a sample of 112 ITO contracts from the SEC database in the period 1993 - 2003. Drawing on transaction cost, agency and relational exchange theories we hypothesize the effects of transaction and relational characteristics on the specific contractual provisions {{as well as on}} overall contract extensiveness. Further, we examine how these associations vary under conditions of fixed price and time and materials pricing structures. The results provide good support for the main hypotheses of the study and yield interesting insights about contractual governance of IT outsourcing arrangements...|$|R

After the election, Jefferson and Burr both obtained a majority of electoral votes but tied one another with 73 votes each.

40|$|Trade {{liberalisation}} in {{the livestock}} sector {{is not likely}} to benefit to any great degree from the trade negotiations on agriculture at the WTO that commenced in the spring of 2000. This is because the major barriers to trade in livestock and red meat are not related to tariffs and other traditional border measures that restrict trade or subsidisation; rather, they are governed by the WTO's SPS Agreement and the GATT's <b>contingency</b> protection <b>provisions</b> relating to dumping and countervailing duties. Negotiations on these issues will have to await a general WTO negotiating round. As SPS and contingency protection questions have many interested sectors, progress is likely to be slow and the prospects for further formal liberalisation remote in the near future. In these circumstances, private sector initiatives to defuse trade problems before they start is a strategy that should be continued and expanded. antidumping, Argentina, countervail, red meat, SPS, International Relations/Trade,...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{dissertation}} is {{to examine}} critical issues that pharmaceutical industry currently facing through lenses of corporate finance theories. Tirole (2006) suggest that the pharmaceuticals market is primarily an innovation market; thus, each firm must develop new technology and know-how in order to enter and serve the market. A firm’s profit, when it succeeds in a development, depends on whether it faces a competitor, that is, whether the other firm also succeeds. A common theme in the essays stems from a role corporate finance decisions are playing in the interactions of a pharmaceutical firm with its strategic partners and/or competitors. The modern theoretical Corporate Finance research asks how the agency problems, asymmetric information, signaling and incomplete contracting affect corporations’ optimal investing and financing activities while taking into consideration also the strategic behavior of other market participants. This research {{is a collection of}} three empirical studies of economics of pharmaceutical industry, while three theoretical corporate finance models, i. e. incomplete contracting, asymmetric information and signaling render frameworks for the three essays respectively. I explore the impact of corporate finance decisions by addressing three broad questions. First: How the ownership and control over assets are allocated within drug development partnerships; and how contracts are designed to incorporate <b>contingency</b> <b>provisions,</b> such as a drug failure in clinical trials and monitoring problems? Second: What are determinants of the settlements of pharmaceuticals’ patents litigations and whether settlements can help alleviate the costs of the informational asymmetry problem (i. e. a patent’s validity) ? Third: Can a firm, by signaling high barriers to entry and commitment to behave aggressively, effectively deter potential market entrants? This thesis contributes to the several lines of literature by increasing the knowledge as to how the drug development partnerships’ contracts are structured, what are determinants and benefits of the settlements of pharmaceuticals’ disputes as well as sheds the light on biologic drugs competitive strategies. The problems being examined are focused on the specific strategic interactions (events) of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms, and because the dissertation’s issues all are relatively little analyzed, the study is very relevant. More specific knowledge of the issues that pharmaceutical firms face plausibly increases the intelligence of the practitioner and, thus, leads to better finance and investment decisions, as well as, increased value creation in corporate world...|$|R

The first duty of the General of the Army on taking up his office was to choose a man to succeed him, reserving to himself the power to change that man for another, should he see good reason for such a course. In short, his choice is secret, and being unhampered by any law of heredity or other considerations except those that appeal to his own reason and judgment, not final. He nominates whom he will.|$|R
40|$|Restricted until 13 July 2009. The {{objective}} of this dissertation is to explore whether contractual experience can improve a firm's ability to write more effective contracts. Using a longitudinal dataset consisting of 352 contracts written by Compustar, a supplier of information technology (IT) services {{with a set of}} 140 buyers over a period of 12 years, I examine learning in the selection of the type of contract and in two types of contractual <b>provisions,</b> <b>contingency</b> planning and task description. Adopting a split-sample design, I compare the way Compustar crafted its contracts when it first started offering IT services and later on, after the company had acquired more experience in crafting IT services contracts. The analysis reveals changes over time in the way Compustar designs its contracts that cannot be accounted for by changes in the attributes of the transactions. These findings, I argue, reflect learning processes at the organizational level with respect to the effective management of interfirm exchange...|$|R
40|$|Revelations of ill-treatment {{of prisoners}} by American forces at Abu Ghraib and the {{publication}} of memoranda showing that Bush administration lawyers have been seeking to narrow {{the application of the}} Convention against Torture and other similar provisions – these developments make it necessary for us to think afresh about the character and significance of the various legal prohibitions on torture. This paper argues that the prohibition on torture is not just one rule among others, but a legal archetype – a rule which is emblematic of our larger commitment to break the link between law and brutality. Characterizing the prohibition as a legal archetype affects how we think about the implications of authorizing torture (or interrogation methods that come close to torture); it affects how we think about issues of definition in regard to torture; and it affects how we think about the fragility and <b>contingency</b> of the <b>provisions</b> of positive law that stand between us and barbarism...|$|R
40|$|The {{social risk}} {{literature}} examines {{the extent to}} which states have provided social protection against the ‘old’ social risks of the post-war era and the ‘new’ social risks affecting post-industrial capitalist states. In this paper the <b>contingency</b> of the <b>provision</b> of informal care to people aged 65 and over is discussed. The paper deconstructs the concept of social risk to determine the characteristics and processes which contribute to states recognising specific contingencies as social risks which require social protection. This conceptualisation is applied {{to make the case that}} care related risks associated with the informal care of older people should be recognised and treated as social risks by states. Data from a qualitative study of the English care policy system provide empirical evidence that informal care related risks are recognised, but not treated, as social risks in England. The findings reveal informal carers and the older people they care for receive inadequate and inconsistent statutory protection against the poverty and welfare risks they face, furthermore the design and operationalisation of the English care policy system generates risks for care relationships...|$|R
