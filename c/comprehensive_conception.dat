The political and personal relations of the Genoese nobility; the luxurious splendour, the intrigues, the feuds, and jarring interests, which occupy them, are made visible before us: we understand and may appreciate {{the complexities of the}} conspiracy; we mingle, as among realities, in the pompous and imposing movements which lead to the catastrophe. The catastrophe itself is displayed with peculiar effect. The midnight silence of the sleeping city, interrupted only by the distant sounds of watchmen, by the low hoarse murmur of the sea, or the stealthy footsteps and disguised voice of Fiesco, is conveyed to our imagination by some brief but graphic touches; we seem to stand in the solitude and deep stillness of Genoa, awaiting the signal which is to burst so fearfully upon its slumber. At length the gun is fired; and the wild uproar which ensues is no less strikingly exhibited. The deeds and sounds of violence, astonishment and terror; the volleying cannon, the heavy toll of the alarm-bells, the acclamation of assembled thousands, 'the voice of Genoa speaking with Fiesco,'—all is made present to us with a force and clearness, which of itself were enough to show no ordinary power of close and <b>comprehensive</b> <b>conception,</b> no ordinary skill in arranging and expressing its results.|$|E

When we discover how far the most admirable community ever framed was removed from that perfection to which human society is impelled by some active power within each bosom to aspire, how great ought to be our hopes, how resolute our struggles! For the Greeks of the Periclean age were widely different from us. It is to be lamented that no modern writer has hitherto dared to show them precisely as they were. Barthelemi cannot be denied the praise of industry and system; but he never forgets {{that he is a}} Christian and a Frenchman. Wieland, in his delightful novels, makes indeed a very tolerable Pagan, but cherishes too many political prejudices, and refrains from diminishing the interest of his romances by painting sentiments in which no European of modern times can possibly sympathize. There is no book which shows the Greeks precisely as they were; they seem all written for children with the caution that no practice or sentiment, highly inconsistent with our present manners, should be mentioned, lest those manners should receive outrage and violation. But there are many to whom the Greek language is inaccessible, who ought not to be excluded by this prudery from possessing an exact and <b>comprehensive</b> <b>conception</b> of the history of man; for there is no knowledge concerning what man has been and may be, from partaking of which a person can depart, without becoming in some degree more philosophical, tolerant, and just.|$|E

If you will take a Lilliputian cedar tree for a model, and build a dozen imitations of it with the stiffest article of telegraph wire--set them one foot apart and then try to walk through them, you'll understand (provided the floor is covered 12 inches deep with sand,) what it is to wander through a sage-brush desert. When crushed, sage brush emits an odor which isn't exactly magnolia and equally isn't exactly polecat but is a sort of compromise between the two. It looks a good deal like grease-wood, and is the ugliest plant that was ever conceived of. It is gray in color. On the plains, sage-brush and grease-wood grow about twice as large as the common geranium--and in my opinion they are a very good substitute for that useless vegetable. Grease-wood is a perfect--most perfect imitation in miniature of a live oak tree-barring the color of it. As to the other fruits and flowers of the country, there ain't any, except [...] "Pulu" [...] or [...] "Tuler," [...] or what ever they call it,--a species of unpoetical willow that grows on the banks of the Carson--a RIVER, 20 yards wide, knee deep, and so villainously rapid and crooked, that it looks like it had wandered into the country without intending it, and had run about in a bewildered way and got lost, in its hurry to get out again before some thirsty man came along and drank it up. I said we are situated in a flat, sandy desert--true. And surrounded on all sides by such prodigious mountains, that when you gaze at them awhile,--and begin to conceive of their grandeur--and next to feel their vastness expanding your soul--and ultimately find yourself growing and swelling and spreading into a giant--I say when this point is reached, you look disdainfully down upon the insignificant village of Carson, and in that instant you are seized with a burning desire to stretch forth your hand, put the city in your pocket, and walk off with it.|$|E

40|$|Social life is {{inherently}} risky. Who should bear {{the costs of}} accidental harm? That issue has been traditionally addressed in tort legal doctrine under the concept of breach of the negligence standard of care. Trial courts provide juries with instructions that, put roughly, direct the jury {{to decide whether the}} defendant’s conduct fell below what a reasonably prudent person would have done if in the defendant’s circumstances. Without further judicial direction on that issue, the jury effectively has excessive discretion in rendering a verdict. Such discretion, opens the door for at least two kinds of potential injustice. Juries could treat like cases differently, and juries can easily ignore or fail to give due consideration to a society’s diverse, irreconcilable, and competing conceptions of the good as to what constitutes reasonable prudence. To mitigate such, I have created “democratic standard theory. ” I claim that a theory based on the overarching moral and political commitments of the Kantian tradition can only specify what constitutes negligent breach if it incorporates, as facts, the actual values of the individuals subject to the risk at issue. Since individuals’ <b>comprehensive</b> <b>conceptions</b> of the good conflict, majority rule, constrained by constitutional essentials, should determine what constitutes breach of the negligence standard of care. Thus, in each dispute over negligence in tort, democratic standard theory sets the stakes of negligent risk, especially the costs of accidental harm, in accordance with the values of as many as possible of the individuals locally affected by the particular kind of act at issue. ...|$|R

40|$|What role {{does and}} should {{religion}} {{play in the}} legal sphere of a modern liberal democracy? Does religion threaten to create divisions that would undermine {{the stability of the}} constitutional order? Or is religious disagreement itself a force that works to create consensus on some of the core commitments of constitutionalism [...] liberty of conscience, toleration, limited government, and the rule of law? This essay explores these questions from the perspectives of contemporary political philosophy and constitutional theory. The thesis of the essay is that pluralism [...] the diversity of religious and secular conceptions of the good [...] can and should work as a force for constitutional consensus and that such a consensus is best realized through commitment to an ideal of public legal reason instantiated by the practice of legal formalism. The case for these claims is made in six parts. After the introduction, Part II, The Fact of Pluralism in the Context of Contemporary Religious Division, explores the idea of religious division in light of an important notion in political philosophy [...] the idea that John Rawls calls the fact of reasonable pluralism. Part III, Public Legal Reason, argues that the fact of pluralism has important normative consequences for the foundations of normative legal theory and argues for an ideal of public legal reason. Part IV, Legal Formalism, contends that this idea is best realized in constitutional practice through a formalist approach to constitutional interpretation [...] one that deliberately eschews direct reliance on religious and secular <b>comprehensive</b> <b>conceptions</b> of the good. Part V, Feasibility and Positive Theory, discusses the question whether this ideal of public legal reason and corresponding conception of constitutional formalism are realistic, given the constraints imposed by democratic politics under contemporary conditions. Finally, Part VI, Religious Division Revisited: From Pluralism to Formalism, brings the discussion to a close...|$|R

If we, as the citizenry, cannot agree about a core meaning of freedom, equality, dignity, democracy, accountability, transparency and integrity, then our constitution will remain a text with no more significance than a document of historical curiosity.

This work assesses the original Rawls' work, the criticism that emerged in the twenty years after its publication and the answer provided by Rawls in his next book, the Political Liberalism, published in 1992, trying to help in the task of determinating what exactly Rawls' work demands, what room is left for the development of <b>comprehensive</b> <b>conceptions</b> of the good, what is the impact of individualism in this theory and which criticisms may be emerged due to misunderstandings caused by his first book. Key-words: John Rawls, liberalism, A Theory of Justice, communitarianism, perfectionism, Political Liberalism, justice as fairness, {{priority of the}} just over the good...|$|R
40|$|Procedure {{is merely}} the means of {{co-ordinating}} effort, of harmonizing differences, of offering every one equality of opportunity in offense and defense before the law. Without it there would be confusion, favoritism, and injustice. If the subject were viewed in this fundamental way, and were studied conscientiously as an incident and aid to the development and determination of the merits of controversies, the criticisms now so fiercely directed against it would largely disappear. In its use it is indispensable, in its abuse only does it cause trouble. A professional conscience to curb that abuse, and professional learning and skill to direct its proper use, are the two needs of the time. Perhaps the law schools have a part {{to play in the}} attainment of both these ends. For law and ethics are twin sisters. But the primary problem of the schools is to develop true and <b>comprehensive</b> intellectual <b>conceptions.</b> So far as procedure is concerned, it seems clear that they have failed to appreciate the magnitude of the task and have done little to correct the deficiencies which the public is so insistently pointing out...|$|R

For this purpose, we tracked nascent entrepreneurs who began the start-up process (by communicating their intentions to start a business) in order to find out whether or not they finally went into active business (= founding success). In order to explain founding success, we defined four influencing dimensions: (1) the entrepreneur (person), (2) resources, (3) the environment and (4) the (start-up) process. Our analysis is based on a longitudinal study in which 290 nascent entrepreneurs in Austria were surveyed over a period of three years (1998 – 2001). After that period, 159 (54. 9 %) of them had already started business activities, while 131 (45. 2 %) had not. A binary logistic regression revealed that variables in all four influencing dimensions constitute significant predictors. Among those predictors, the most influential are intrapreneurial experience (human capital), organizational efforts (process), cohabitation (person) and the aim of a full-time start-up (process). Our results support the assumption that using as <b>comprehensive</b> a <b>conception</b> as possible (reflecting all four influencing dimensions) is useful for the purpose of explaining founding success...|$|R
