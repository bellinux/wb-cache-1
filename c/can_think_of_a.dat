5|$|In the B-model of topological string theory, the D-branes {{are complex}} submanifolds of a Calabi–Yau {{together}} with additional data that arise physically from having charges at the endpoints of strings. Intuitively, one <b>can</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> submanifold as a surface embedded inside the Calabi–Yau, although submanifolds can also exist in dimensions different from two. In mathematical language, the category having these branes as its objects {{is known as}} the derived category of coherent sheaves on the Calabi–Yau. In the A-model, the D-branes can again be viewed as submanifolds of a Calabi–Yau manifold. Roughly speaking, they are what mathematicians call special Lagrangian submanifolds. This means among other things that they have half the dimension of the space in which they sit, and they are length-, area-, or volume-minimizing. The category having these branes as its objects is called the Fukaya category.|$|E

500|$|The {{television}} {{show that the}} Simpson family watches {{at the beginning of}} the episode, in which the two reviewers discuss the latest McBain film, is a parody of the American television series Siskel & Ebert & the Movies. In the flashback sequence, Homer is seen singing along to the 1973 song [...] "The Joker" [...] by the Steve Miller Band while driving to school. Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin posters hang on the wall of Homer's 1974 bedroom. The 1970 song [...] "(They Long to Be) Close to You" [...] by The Carpenters is heard when Homer sees Marge for the first time. Homer eats a bucket of Shakespeare Fried Chicken when he reveals his feelings towards Marge to Grampa. At the debate, Homer disagrees about the idea of lowering the United States national speed limit to 55mph (90km/h), arguing that [...] "Sure, it'll save a few lives, but millions will be late!" [...] This is a reference to the National Maximum Speed Law provision of the 1974 Emergency Highway Energy Conservation Act that prohibited speed limits higher than 55mph. Barney asks a girl named Estelle if she wants to go to the prom with him, but she tells him that she would not go to the prom with him even if he were American actor Elliott Gould. Artie says he <b>can</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dozen highly cogent arguments to why Marge should accept his prom offer, one of which is from a Time magazine titled [...] "America's Love Affair with the Prom: Even wallflowers can look forward to one date a year," [...] a reference to the American magazine Time. Songs played in the episode include [...] "The Streak" [...] by Ray Stevens , [...] "Goodbye Yellow Brick Road" [...] by Elton John, [...] "Colour My World" [...] by Chicago, [...] "Pick Up the Pieces" [...] by Average White Band, and [...] "The Hustle" [...] by Van McCoy.|$|E

Named in honor of George and Ira Gershwin, this new award recognizes the profound and positive effect of popular music on the world's culture. On being notified of the honor, Simon said, [...] "I am grateful to be {{the recipient of the}} Gershwin Prize and doubly honored to be the first. I look forward to spending an evening in the company of artists I admire at the award ceremony in May. I <b>can</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> few who have expressed my words and music far better than I. I'm excited at the prospect of that happening again. It's a songwriter's dream come true." [...] Among the performers who paid tribute to Simon were Stevie Wonder, Alison Krauss, Jerry Douglas, Lyle Lovett, James Taylor, Dianne Reeves, Marc Anthony, Yolanda Adams, and Ladysmith Black Mambazo. The event was professionally filmed and broadcast and is now available as Paul Simon and Friends.|$|E

50|$|An {{absolute}} {{horizon is}} only defined in an asymptotically flat spacetime — a spacetime which approaches flat space as one moves {{far away from}} any massive bodies.

50|$|As {{mentioned}} above, {{there are}} many methods of analysis developed specifically for LTI systems. This is due to their simplicity of specification. An LTI system is completely specified by its transfer function (which is a rational function for digital and lumped analog LTI systems). Alternatively, we <b>can</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> LTI system being completely specified by its frequency response. A third way to specify an LTI system is by its characteristic linear differential equation (for analog systems) or linear difference equation (for digital systems).
