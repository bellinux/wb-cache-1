5|$|Cocktails {{similar to}} the pisco sour include the Chilean Piscola and the Peruvian Algarrobina <b>Cocktail.</b> Piscola is made by mixing pisco with cola. The Algarrobina <b>Cocktail</b> is made from pisco, {{condensed}} milk, and sap from the Peruvian algarroba tree. Another similar <b>cocktail,</b> from the United States, is the Californian pisco punch, originally made with Peruvian pisco, pineapples, and lemon.|$|E

30|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to highlight {{the impact of the}} cellulase and some hemicellulases activities in various contrasted enzymatic <b>cocktails</b> during hydrolysis of Avicel, of xylans, and simultaneous hydrolysis of both substrates. Furthermore, combinations of different enzymatic <b>cocktails</b> were evaluated in order to improve the global efficiency of <b>cocktails</b> for cellulose hydrolysis. All <b>cocktails</b> tested in our study were complete <b>cocktails</b> produced by T. reesei onto various carbon sources more or less enriched in C 5 and C 6 sugars.|$|R

5|$|A pisco sour is an {{alcoholic}} <b>cocktail</b> of Peruvian origin that {{is typical of}} the cuisines from Chile and Peru, considered also a South American classic. The drink's name comes from pisco, which is its base liquor, and the <b>cocktail</b> term sour, in reference to sour citrus juice and sweetener components. The Peruvian pisco sour uses Peruvian pisco as the base liquor and adds freshly squeezed lime juice, syrup, ice, egg white, and Angostura bitters. The Chilean version is similar, but uses Chilean pisco and pica lime, and excludes the bitters and egg white. Other variants of the <b>cocktail</b> include those created with fruits like pineapple or plants such as coca leaves.|$|E

30|$|The {{strategy}} {{developed in}} the present study was based on the use of enzymatic <b>cocktails</b> obtained from T. reesei. In this context, various enzymatic <b>cocktails</b> were prepared from T. reesei after cultivation with different sugars sources and ratios. This allowed obtaining <b>cocktails</b> containing various levels of cellulases and hemicellulases activities. These <b>cocktails</b> were tested for hydrolysis of Avicel. The effect of the presence of added xylans during the hydrolysis of Avicel was also investigated. Experiments were conducted at high substrate loading and with low enzymes loading in order to mimic the conditions of an industrial process.|$|R

5|$|Although the {{preparation}} of pisco-based mixed beverages possibly {{dates back to the}} 1700s, historians and drink experts agree that the <b>cocktail</b> as it is known today was invented in the early 1920s in Lima, the capital of Peru, by the American bartender Victor Vaughen Morris. Morris left the United States in 1903 to work in Cerro de Pasco, a city in central Peru. In 1916, he opened Morris' Bar in Lima, and his saloon quickly became a popular spot for the Peruvian upper class and English-speaking foreigners. The pisco sour underwent several changes until Mario Bruiget, a Peruvian bartender working at Morris' Bar, created the modern Peruvian recipe of the <b>cocktail</b> {{in the latter part of}} the 1920s by adding Angostura bitters and egg whites to the mix.|$|E
5|$|During Prohibition, Pflueger {{designed}} {{bars for}} private clubs {{such as the}} Stock Exchange Luncheon Club where members kept their personal bottles in small lockers behind the bar, and two bars for The Family, one at the Family Farm in Woodside and one at the clubhouse in San Francisco. Pflueger created a <b>cocktail</b> bar and nightclub for Frank Martinelli and Tom Gerun in 1931, the Bal Tabarin, featuring a stage for live music and colorful indirect lighting from above metal fins in the ceiling and behind curved metal strips upstage. When Prohibition ended in December 1933, Bal Tabarin received an immediate renovation by Pflueger along with a liquor license from the state. Pflueger was then asked to design <b>cocktail</b> lounges for several hotels, completing the Cirque for the Fairmont Hotel in 1935, adorned with finely painted murals by Esther Bruton, and in 1939, both the Patent Leather Bar for the St. Francis Hotel and the Top of the Mark for the Mark Hopkins Hotel. The Patent Leather Bar used a metal-finned ceiling much like that which Pflueger had installed above the audience at the Paramount Theatre in Oakland. A padded, serpentine bar snaked through the room's mirror, chrome and black leather decor. Ansel Adams was retained by C. Templeton Crocker {{to show off the}} new <b>cocktail</b> lounge in photographs.|$|E
5|$|Each {{year the}} event has a theme, and {{includes}} a <b>cocktail</b> hour and a formal dinner. During the <b>cocktail</b> hour, guests arrive {{to walk on the}} red carpet, tour the year's special themed exhibition, and be seated before the dinner party that includes entertainment from the preeminent entertainers of the day. The theme not only sets the tone for the annual exhibit, but also for the guests who attempt to dress to uphold the theme of the year, oftentimes causing runs on certain fashion themes among the world's leading fashion retailers. Sometimes, such as in 2013, the theme is a bit befuddling because it does not provide a clear stylistic directive, while at other times, such as 2014 the theme may be far more challenging to one gender than the other.|$|E

30|$|In our study, T. reesei strains {{modify their}} enzymatic {{activities}} levels produced {{according to the}} sugar nature present as carbon sources. Hydrolysis of Avicel with the various <b>cocktails</b> was more important when <b>cocktails</b> were rich in FPU activity and when ratio FPU/β-glucosidase was low. The presence of xylans during Avicel hydrolysis impacted negatively the efficiency of cellulases for glucose release. By mixing TR 1 and TR 5 <b>cocktails,</b> improved yield of Avicel hydrolysis in presence of xylans was obtained demonstrating the importance of combining hemicellulases and cellulasic activities. These results highlight the importance of optimizing the enzymatic activities levels to obtain efficient enzymatic <b>cocktails</b> for complex substrates hydrolysis.|$|R

5|$|In October 2016, the U.S. {{state of}} Ohio {{announced}} that it would resume executions in January 2017, using a <b>cocktail</b> of midazolam, vecuronium bromide and potassium chloride but this was blocked by a Federal judge. On 25 July 2017, Ronald Phillips was executed with a three-drug <b>cocktail</b> including midazolam after the Supreme Court refused to grant a stay. Prior to this, the last execution in Ohio had been that of Dennis McGuire. Murderer Gary Otte's lawyers unsuccessfully challenged his Ohio execution, arguing that midazolam might not protect him from serious pain when the other drugs are administered. He died without incident in about 14 minutes on September 13, 2017.|$|E
30|$|Various enzymatic <b>cocktails</b> were {{produced}} from two Trichoderma reesei strains, a cellulase hyperproducer strain and a strain with β-glucosidase activity overexpression. By using various carbon sources (lactose, glucose, xylose, hemicellulosic hydrolysate) for strains growth, contrasted enzymatic activities were obtained. The enzymatic <b>cocktails</b> presented {{various levels of}} efficiency for the hydrolysis of cellulose Avicel into glucose, in presence of xylans, or not. These latter were also hydrolyzed with different extents according to <b>cocktails.</b> The most efficient <b>cocktails</b> (TR 1 and TR 3) on Avicel were richer in filter paper activity (FPU) and presented a low ratio FPU/β-glucosidase activity. <b>Cocktails</b> TR 2 and TR 5 which {{were produced}} on the higher amount of hemicellulosic hydrolysate, possess both high xylanase and β-xylosidase activities, and were the most efficient for xylans hydrolysis. When hydrolysis of Avicel was conducted in presence of xylans, a decrease of glucose release occurred for all <b>cocktails</b> compared to hydrolysis of Avicel alone. Mixing TR 1 and TR 5 <b>cocktails</b> with two different ratios of proteins (1 / 1 and 1 / 4) resulted in a gain of efficiency for glucose release during hydrolysis of Avicel in presence of xylans compared to TR 5 alone. Our results demonstrate the importance of combining hemicellulase and cellulase activities to improve the yields of glucose release from Avicel in presence of xylans. In this context, strategies involving enzymes production with carbon sources comprising mixed C 5 and C 6 sugars or combining different <b>cocktails</b> produced on C 5 or on C 6 sugars are of interest for processes developed {{in the context of}} lignocellulosic biorefinery.|$|R
