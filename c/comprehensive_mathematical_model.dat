40|$|Introduction: Our skin {{is exposed}} daily to substances; {{many of these}} are neutral and safe but others are {{potentially}} harmful. In order to estimate the degree of toxicity and damage to skin tissues when exposed to harmful substances, skin toxicology studies are required. If these studies are coupled with suitably designed <b>mathematical</b> <b>models,</b> they can provide a powerful tool that allows appropriate interpretation of data. This work reviews <b>mathematical</b> <b>models</b> that can be employed in skin toxicology studies. Areas covered: Two types of <b>mathematical</b> <b>models</b> and their suitability for assessing skin toxicology are covered in this review.
