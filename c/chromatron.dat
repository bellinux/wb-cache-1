25|$|Similar {{concepts}} {{were common}} through the 1940s and 1950s, differing {{primarily in the}} way they re-combined the colors generated by the three guns. The Geer tube was similar to Baird's concept, but used small pyramids with the phosphors deposited on their outside faces, instead of Baird's 3D patterning on a flat surface. The Penetron used three layers of phosphor {{on top of each other}} and increased the power of the beam to reach the upper layers when drawing those colors. The <b>Chromatron</b> used a set of focusing wires to select the colored phosphors arranged in vertical stripes on the tube.|$|E
25|$|RCA used Valensi's {{concept as}} the basis of all of its developments, believing it to be the only proper {{solution}} to the broadcast problem. However, RCA's early sets using mirrors and other projection systems all suffered from image and color quality problems, and were easily bested by CBS's hybrid system. But solutions to these problems were in the pipeline, and RCA in particular was investing massive sums (later estimated at $100 million) to develop a usable dot-sequential tube. RCA was beaten to the punch by the Geer tube, which used three B tubes aimed at different faces of colored pyramids to produce a color image. All-electronic systems included the <b>Chromatron,</b> Penetron and beam-index tube that were being developed by various companies. While investigating all of these, RCA's teams quickly started focusing on the shadow mask system.|$|E
50|$|In {{spite of}} these problems, {{the promise of the}} <b>Chromatron</b> system was so great that a number of {{companies}} continued development of the system throughout the 1950s. The <b>Chromatron</b> design was also licensed for a variety of other uses; Litton Industries used the <b>Chromatron</b> with a two-color display (blue-red) as the basis for an Identification Friend or Foe system.|$|E
50|$|In {{spite of}} Sony's move to Trinitron, {{a limited number}} of 7-inch <b>Chromatrons</b> were built and offered for sale in the United States {{starting}} in April 1968 as the KV 7010U. These were replaced three months later by the KV 7010UA using a Trinitron tube.|$|R

50|$|Ernest Lawrence {{developed}} a similar system known as <b>Chromatron</b> that used {{a grid of}} fine wires behind the screen to electrically deflect the beam, but it suffered from the same basic problem as RCA's approach. In spite of years of development, no one was able to produce a commercially viable version. Sony's attempt to produce a practical <b>Chromatron</b> inspired {{the development of their}} Trinitron aperture grille system.|$|E

5000|$|Morita {{arranged}} {{a deal with}} Paramount Pictures, who was paying for Chromatic Labs' development of the <b>Chromatron,</b> taking over the entire project. In early 1963, Senri Miyaoka was sent to Manhattan to arrange {{the transfer of the}} technology to Sony, which would lead to the closing of Chromatic Labs. He was unimpressed with the labs, describing the windowless basement as [...] "squalor". The American team was only too happy to point out the serious flaws in the <b>Chromatron</b> system, telling Miyaoka that the design was hopeless. By September 1964, a 17-inch prototype had been built in Japan, but mass-production test runs were demonstrating serious problems. Sony engineers were unable to make a version of <b>Chromatron</b> that could be reliably mass-produced.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Chromatron</b> is a color {{television}} {{cathode ray tube}} design invented by Nobel prize-winner Ernest Lawrence and developed commercially by Paramount Pictures, Sony, Litton Industries and others. The <b>Chromatron</b> offered brighter images than conventional {{color television}} systems using a shadow mask, but a host of development problems kept it from being widely used in spite of years of development. Sony eventually abandoned it in favor of their famous Trinitron system using an aperture grille.|$|E
50|$|Early successes at Autometric {{included}} {{the invention of}} the <b>Chromatron</b> which was subsequently sold to Sony and used prior to developing the Trinitron.|$|E

50|$|When {{sets were}} finally made {{available}} in late 1964, {{they were put}} on the market at a competitive 198,000 yen ($550), but cost the company over 400,000 yen to produce. Ibuka had bet the company on <b>Chromatron</b> and had already {{set up a new}} factory to produce them with the hopes that the production problems would be ironed out and the line would become profitable. After several thousand sets had shipped, the situation was no better, while Panasonic and Toshiba {{were in the process of}} introducing sets based on RCA licenses. By 1966, the <b>Chromatron</b> was breaking the company financially.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Chromatron</b> {{also had}} several disadvantages. One {{was that there}} was a {{fundamental}} ratio between the acceleration provided by the grid and the electron gun {{at the back of the}} tube; in order to ensure that the grid could successfully control the beam, it had to have a significant proportion of the overall power. Unfortunately the mechanical layout of the grid limited it to voltages of about 5000 V or less, which in turn limited the electron gun to relatively low voltages around 8000 V. Thus the overall power in the <b>Chromatron</b> was less than in conventional tubes, offsetting its natural brightness to some degree.|$|E
5000|$|In March 1961 Ibuka, Akio Morita and Nobutoshi Kihara {{attended}} the IEEE trade {{show at the}} New York Coliseum. This was Kihara's {{first visit to the}} U.S., and he spent considerable time wandering the show floor. At the small Autometric booth he saw the <b>Chromatron</b> being displayed, and hurried to find Morita and Ibuka to show them. When Morita saw the display he immediately started negotiating a meeting for the next morning to visit the Chromatic labs in Manhattan. By the end of the meeting the next day, Morita had secured a license to produce [...] "a <b>Chromatron</b> tube and color television receiver utilizing it." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{basic concept}} that defined the <b>Chromatron</b> was the near-screen {{focusing}} system, which provided the beam resolution needed to accurately hit the individual colored phosphor strips. The grid both focused the signal {{as well as}} guided it to the correct colors.|$|E

50|$|The {{combination}} of three-in-one electron gun and {{the replacement of}} the shadow mask with the aperture grille resulted in a unique and easily patentable product. In spite of Trinitron and <b>Chromatron</b> having no technology in common, the shared single electron gun has led to many erroneous claims that the two are very similar, or the same.|$|E
5000|$|One {{example of}} an [...] "instantaneous recording" [...] machine, {{available}} to the home recording enthusiast by about 1929 or 1930, was the [...] "Sentinel Chromatron" [...] machine. [...] The Sentinel <b>Chromatron</b> recorded on a single side of uncoated aluminum; its records were read with a fibre needle. It was [...] "rather unstable technology" [...] which produced poor sound quality in comparison to shellac records and was rarely used after 1935.|$|E
5000|$|Yet another {{advantage}} of the near-screen focusing was that the electron beam was bent to hit the phosphors on the tube's faceplate at right angles {{no matter what the}} angle of the beam was behind the focuser. This allowed the tubes to be built with much higher deflection angles than conventional tubes [...] - [...] 72 degrees as opposed to a more typical 45. <b>Chromatron</b> tubes thus had much less depth for any given horizontal size.|$|E
5000|$|In early 1963 Senri Miyaoka {{was sent}} to the Chromatic labs to arrange the {{transfer}} of the technology to Sony, which would lead to the closing of Chromatic.

By September 1964, a 17 inch prototype had been built in Japan, but mass-production test runs were demonstrating serious problems.|$|E
50|$|The {{other similar}} design is the Trinitron. The Trinitron {{combined}} the vertical stripes of the beam-index and <b>Chromatron</b> tubes {{with a new}} single-gun three-beam cathode and an aperture grille shadow mask. The result was a design with the mechanical simplicity of the shadow mask design and the bright images of the beam-index system. Trinitron was a major product for Sony for several decades, representing the high-point of conventional color TV displays until the widespread introduction of plasma displays and LCD televisions in the 21st century.|$|E
50|$|It {{would be}} years before any of these systems {{made their way into}} production. The Penetron never worked for color TV, but found niche roles in aerospace. Sony tried the <b>Chromatron</b> in the 1960s, but gave up and {{developed}} the Trinitron instead. The Apple tube re-emerged in the 1970s and had some success. But it was RCA's success with the shadow mask that dampened most of these efforts. Until 1968, every color television sold used the RCA shadow mask concept, in the spring of that year Sony introduced their first Trinitron sets.|$|E
5000|$|The {{production}} {{problems were}} never solved, {{and led to}} increasing tension between Ibuka and Morita. In November 1966 Kazuo Iwama told Susumu Yoshida {{that the company was}} close to ruin, and that the team had to improve the yields {{by the end of the}} year, or the product would have to be cancelled. Meanwhile, RCA was making great progress improving their shadow mask technology, and new entrants like General Electric's [...] "Porta-Color" [...] offered other advantages. Sony was clearly falling behind the rest of the market by following the <b>Chromatron</b> approach.|$|E
50|$|Similar {{concepts}} {{were common}} through the 1940s and 1950s, differing {{primarily in the}} way they re-combined the colors generated by the three guns. The Geer tube was similar to Baird's concept, but used small pyramids with the phosphors deposited on their outside faces, instead of Baird's 3D patterning on a flat surface. The Penetron used three layers of phosphor {{on top of each other}} and increased the power of the beam to reach the upper layers when drawing those colors. The <b>Chromatron</b> used a set of focusing wires to select the colored phosphors arranged in vertical stripes on the tube.|$|E
50|$|Single-gun {{systems like}} the <b>Chromatron</b> create color by varying the {{intensity}} of the beam to adjust the brightness for each color component, and then using a second system to ensure that instantaneous signal ends up on the correct phosphor. The beam-index tube uses an alternate solution which allows the beam to scan normally as in a black and white television with no secondary focussing system, and instead rapidly varies {{the intensity of}} the beam when it knows it is over the correct color. To do this, the tube requires some way to accurately time the beam's passage along the tube, with enough accuracy to ensure the proper color is hit.|$|E
50|$|In {{practice}} the design proved to have serious problems. Since the focusing system had to quickly move the beam {{to generate the}} correct colors, very high voltages and powers had to be used, leading to arcing problems and radio frequency (RF) noise. The latter was particularly annoying when {{used as the basis}} of a television, as the noise interfered with the radio receivers that picked up the broadcasts. The University eventually abandoned their interest in <b>Chromatron,</b> but Paramount continued development as a system for displaying film during editing, which meant that the RF noise did not present a problem. Development was still continuing in the early 1960s when their work was bought by Sony.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{contender}} was General Electric's Penetron, {{which used}} three stacked layers of phosphor {{and attempted to}} change {{the power of the}} electron beam to write to the correct one. More common were attempts to use a secondary focussing arrangement just behind the screen to produce the required accuracy. Paramount Pictures worked long and hard on the <b>Chromatron,</b> which used a set of wires behind the screen as a secondary [...] "gun", further focussing the beam and steering it towards the correct color. Philco's [...] "Apple" [...] tube used additional stripes of phosphor that released a burst of electrons when the electron beam swept across them, by timing the bursts it could adjust the passage of the beam and hit the correct colors.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1966, Ibuka finally gave in, and {{announced}} he would personally lead {{a search for a}} replacement for <b>Chromatron.</b> Susumu Yoshida was sent to the U.S. to look for potential licenses, and was impressed with the improvements that RCA had made in overall brightness by introducing new rare earth phosphors on the screen. He also saw General Electric's [...] "Porta-color" [...] design, using three guns in a row instead of a triangle, which allowed a greater portion of the screen to be lit. His report was cause for concern in Japan, where it seemed Sony was falling ever-farther behind the U.S. designs. They might be forced to license the shadow mask system if they wanted to remain competitive.|$|E
50|$|RCA used Valensi's {{concept as}} the basis of all of its developments, believing it to be the only proper {{solution}} to the broadcast problem.

5000|$|In 1961, a Sony {{delegation}} {{was visiting}} the IEEE trade show in New York City, including Ibuka, Akio Morita (Sony's other co-founder) and Nobutoshi Kihara, who was promoting his new CV-2000 home video tape recorder. This was Kihara's first trip abroad {{and he spent}} much of his time wandering the trade floor, where he came across a small booth by the small company Autometric. They were demonstrating a new type of color television based on the <b>Chromatron</b> system, which used a single electron gun and a mask of thin wires instead of a shadow mask. The resulting image was far brighter than anything the RCA design could produce, and lacked the convergence problems that required constant adjustments. He quickly brought Morita and Ibuka to see the design, and Morita was [...] "sold" [...] on the spot.|$|E
50|$|The beam-index tube bears some {{resemblance}} to two {{other types of}} television tubes which also used vertical stripes of colored phosphor instead of dots or grids. The <b>Chromatron</b> used two sets of fine wires suspended behind the display area to electrically focus its single beam, one set of wires pulling the beam towards the red side and the other towards the blue. The grids were aligned so the beam would normally focus onto the green stripe in the middle, but by varying the relative voltage between the two the beam could accurately hit the colored stripes. In practice the wires were difficult to keep aligned with the phosphors, and gave off electrical noise that interfered with the radio receivers in a television application. It saw some use in military settings, including some commercial television use in the Yaou, Sony 19C 70 and the Sony KV 7010U.|$|E
5000|$|As {{early as}} 1940, Baird had started {{work on a}} fully {{electronic}} system he called Telechrome. Early Telechrome devices used two electron guns aimed at {{either side of a}} phosphor plate. The phosphor was patterned so the electrons from the guns only fell {{on one side of the}} patterning or the other. Using cyan and magenta phosphors, a reasonable limited-color image could be obtained. He also demonstrated the same system using monochrome signals to produce a 3D image (called [...] "stereoscopic" [...] at the time). A demonstration on 16 August 1944 was the first example of a practical color television system. Work on the Telechrome continued and plans were made to introduce a three-gun version for full color. However, Baird's untimely death in 1946 ended development of the Telechrome system.Similar concepts were common through the 1940s and 1950s, differing primarily in the way they re-combined the colors generated by the three guns. The Geer tube was similar to Baird's concept, but used small pyramids with the phosphors deposited on their outside faces, instead of Baird's 3D patterning on a flat surface.
