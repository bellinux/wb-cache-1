40|$|Not {{all those}} who write {{philosophy}} are recognized as philosophers. In this paper I argue that Dutch writer Isabelle de Charrière, usually known as a novelist, is actually engaged in doing moral philosophy. In {{the second half of}} the eighteenth century, Char-rière wrote novels about characters who endorsed moral theories and commitments. Her novels track the dilemmas that these characters face in trying to live according their moral theories and commitments. I consider the case for treating fi <b>ction</b> as philosophically valuable, and argue that Charrière’s novels fall into the category of philosophically valuable fi <b>ction.</b> This article considers the philosophical interest of the fi <b>ction</b> of Isabelle de Charrière, today known primarily as a novelist. The well-educated daughter of minor Dutch nobility, Charrière (1740 – 1806) lived fi rst in the Netherlands and then in Switzerland. She read widely, mingled with philosophers, novelists, and other intellectuals, and published several novels, as well as many short stories. Some of her fi <b>ction,</b> principally the novella Three Women, 1 explores themes from contemporary moral and political philosophy, although this aspect of her fi <b>ction</b> is not yet widely recognized. 2 Charrière did not write philosophical treatises; but she did write fi <b>ction</b> that engaged with the philosophical, and specifi cally the moral, topics of her time, including particular theories in moral and political philosophy. Works that cover such ground are Les lettres de Mistriss Henley (Charrière 1980 a), Honorine d’Userche (Charrière 1981 a), and Sir Walter Finch et son fi ls William (Charrière 1981 b). Charrière’s fi <b>ction</b> explores a range of themes in this area, including the difficulties that individuals face in following moral theories, weaknesses in the moral theories themselves, and individuals ’ tendency to apply moral theorie...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we examine}} Donna Haraway’s {{idea of a}} {{liberating}} potential of cyborgization {{in the light of}} popular culture products related to organized work. We consider two different takes on this issue: women as technology and technology as women, and we start with the successive versions of Stepford Wives (the novel, the 1975 movie and the 2004 movie), and continue by tracing the evolution of the character of a cyberwoman, from William Gibson’s Neuromancer (1984) and Idoru (1996), to Trinity from the Matrix trilogy. We show that cyborgization does not automatically denote liberalization, and suggest that the much greater popularity of the Matrix fi lms compared to the intellectual projects of William Gibson means that stereotypes and strong plots survive, fi nding ever new forms of expression. We end the paper by pointing out the relevance of popular culture models for work in contemporary homes and other workplaces.

During Fluorox run FBR- 22, 90. 4 % of the theoretical amount of UF/sub 6 / formed was collected in cold traps and chemical traps. Toroid tests of flame calcined mixed Th-U oxide showed low corrosion rates, small changes in particle size and a low solubilization of uranium, while denitration of uranyl nitrate in a fluidized bed resulted in particle growth with uniform layers of uranium oxide. A half-time of 30 min for uranium anion exchange was measured in differential bed studies of uranium sorption on Dowex 21 K. The Darex Reference flowsheet operation resulted in chloride removal to less than 50 ppm in solvent extraction feed from APPR head- end treatment. Unirradiated prototype Consolidated Edison pins were dejacketed with 6 M H/sub 2 /SO/sub 4 / with uranium losses to the dejacketing solution of approximately 0. 2 %.
