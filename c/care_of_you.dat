[...] Mozart's older, seven-year-old son Karl was present at his father's death and later wrote, [...] "Particularly remarkable is in my opinion the fact that a few days before he died, his whole body became so swollen that the patient was unable to make the smallest movement, moreover, there was stench, which reflected an internal disintegration which, after death, increased to the extent that an autopsy was impossible." ...|$|E
