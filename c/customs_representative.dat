50|$|Danish painter Wilhelm Freddie's entries {{never made}} it to the exhibition, as they were confiscated by British <b>Customs</b> <b>representatives</b> for being pornographic. According to ruling law at the time, the works had to be destroyed, but this was avoided at the last minute and they were {{despatched}} back to Denmark.|$|R
5000|$|Until 1996, the school's {{teams were}} called [...] "The Indians;" [...] they {{featured}} an Indian mascot. This was changed among controversy of the mascot being racist in nature. In 1996, local Connecticut students, all native American and actively {{involved with their}} culture, visited Newtown High School and explained that the pep rally and game activities—the war chants, tomahawk chants, the Indian costumes and dancing—trivialize religious <b>customs.</b> <b>Representatives</b> from other local tribes explained that mascots should not depict a race or ethnic group because it is dehumanizing. They were renamed the Newtown Nighthawks.|$|R

50|$|As the {{relationship}} between the colonists and England deteriorated, Charleston became a focal point in the ensuing American Revolution. In protest of the Tea Act of 1773, which embodied the concept of taxation without representation, Charlestonians confiscated tea and stored it in the Exchange and <b>Custom</b> House. <b>Representatives</b> from all over the colony came to the Exchange in 1774 to elect delegates to the Continental Congress, the group responsible for drafting the Declaration of Independence; and South Carolina declared its independence from the crown {{on the steps of the}} Exchange. Soon, the church steeples of Charleston, especially St. Michael's, became targets for British warships causing rebel forces to paint the steeples black to blend with the night sky.|$|R
50|$|One dish {{appreciated}} {{by many of}} the citizens of the area is grilled trout taken directly from the Vomano river. The gastronomy of Montorio is perhaps best characterized by homemade pastry products assembled in accordance with ancient local <b>customs.</b> A <b>representative</b> dish is the well known Bocconotti, made in the traditional manner of Abruzzo using fresh eggs, almonds, olive oil, lemons and grape preserves. In order to enhance its flavor, the delecacy is typically accompanied by a refreshing glass of the local red wine. Pizza Dolce is a cake with a velvety cream frosting and is commonly garnished with crushed sweet almonds, cinnamon, and bitter chocolate. It can often be found at wedding celebrations.|$|R
5000|$|The Phaeton {{entered the}} harbour on 14 October surreptitiously under a Dutch flag. Despite {{the arrival of}} the [...] "Dutch" [...] ships being later in the season than normal, the Japanese and Dutch representatives didn't seem to suspect {{anything}} suspicious. So, as was the <b>custom,</b> Dutch <b>representatives</b> from the Nagasaki trading enclave of Dejima rowed out to welcome the visiting ship, but as they approached, Phaeton lowered a tender to capture the Dutch representatives, while their Japanese escorts jumped into the sea and fled. The Phaeton, threatening to execute the Dutch representatives, demanded that supplies (water, food, fuel) be delivered to her in exchange for their lives. The Phaeton also fired cannons and muskets to press her demands, and threatened to destroy the Japanese and Chinese ships in the harbour. Because the harbor cannon defenses were so old, and most couldn't even fire, the meager Japanese forces in Nagasaki were seriously outgunned and unable to intervene.|$|R
50|$|By 1382 an {{agreement}} {{for managing the}} country had been agreed to, with Philip, Duke of Burgundy left to manage the administration. After several failed attempts to have taxation approved by the councils and estates general of the numerous French principalities, the Duke resolved to reimpose the gabelle, a sales tax on salt, and the aides, a <b>customs</b> duty. The <b>representatives</b> of Paris were summoned before the King on January 16 and individually pressured to approve the imposition of the new tax. Under duress they agreed, but the news only gradually became known to the public. The Duke, as was customary at the time, appointed tax farmers to collect the tax.|$|R
5000|$|In December 2015, Trump {{proposed}} a temporary ban on foreign Muslims entering the United States (the U.S. admits approximately 100,000 Muslim immigrants each year) [...] "until {{we can figure}} out what's going on". In response to the 2015 San Bernardino shooting, Trump released a statement on [...] "Preventing Muslim Immigration" [...] and called for [...] "a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can {{figure out what the}} hell is going on". In a December 2015 interview, the host Willie Geist repeatedly questioned Trump if airline <b>representatives,</b> <b>customs</b> agents or border guards would ask a person's religion. Trump responded that they would and if the person said they were Muslim, they will be denied entry into the country.|$|R
40|$|The term Indian encapsulates {{diversity}} of region, language, religion, <b>custom</b> and tradition <b>representative</b> {{of the complexity}} of Indian ethnicity d the pluralism within India itself The history of the Indian diaspora has resulted in people of Indian origin emigrating once, twice, and in some cases even thrice within a generation to countries whose host cultures were different, even hostile. The tenacity with which these individuals of Indian origin have retained their cultural identity and define their Indianness in terms of their religious, regional, linguistic and cultural influences is surprising. But can this phenomenon continue in pluralistic societies uch as Australia given the further integration of future generations into mainstream Australia?

50|$|In April 1818, the United States {{passed a}} law prohibiting the import of slaves into any port in the United States. The law left several loopholes, giving {{permission}} to any ship to capture a slave ship, regardless of the country of origin. Slaves captured in such actions who were {{turned over to the}} customs office would be sold within the United States, with half the profits going to the people who turned them in. Lafitte worked with several smugglers, including Jim Bowie, to profit from the poorly written law. Lafitte's men identified slave ships and captured them. Smugglers would purchase the slaves for a discounted price, march them to Louisiana, and turn them in to <b>customs</b> officials. A <b>representative</b> of the smuggler would purchase the slaves at the ensuing auction, and the smuggler would be given half of the purchase price. The smuggler became the lawful owner of the slaves and could resell them in New Orleans, or transport them for sale {{in other parts of the}} Deep South, which was the major market of the time.|$|R
40|$|Phase and {{antigenic}} variation are mechanisms used by microbial pathogens to stochastically change their cell surface composition. A related property, {{referred to as}} phenotypic switching, has been described for some pathogenic fungi. This phenomenon is best studied in Candida albicans, where switch phenotypes vary in morphology, physiology, and pathogenicity in experimental models. In this study, we report an application of a <b>custom</b> Affymetrix GeneChip <b>representative</b> of the entire C. albicans genome and assay the global expression profiles of white and opaque switch phenotypes of the WO- 1 strain. Of 13, 025 probe sets examined, 373 ORFs demonstrated a greater than twofold difference in expression level between switch phenotypes. Among these, 221 were expressed at a level higher in opaque cells than in white cells; conversely, 152 were more highly expressed in white cells. Affected genes represent functions as diverse as metabolism, adhesion, cell surface composition, stress response, signaling, mating type, and virulence. Approximately one-third {{of the differences between}} cell types are related to metabolic pathways, opaque cells expressing a transcriptional profile consistent with oxidative metabolism and white cells expressing a fermentative one. This bias was obtained regardless of carbon source, suggesting a connection between phenotypic switching and metabolic flexibility, where metabolic specialization of switch phenotypes enhances selection in relation to the nutrients available at different anatomical sites. These results extend our understanding of strategies used in microbial phase variation and pathogenesis and further characterize the unanticipated diversity of genes expressed in phenotypic switching...|$|R
