5|$|A {{decade after}} the fact, during {{the second round of}} child abuse allegations, Jackson's lawyers would file a memo stating that the 1994 {{settlement}} was made without his consent. A later disclosure by the FBI of investigation documents compiled over nearly 20 years led Jackson's attorney to suggest that no evidence of molestation or sexual impropriety from Jackson toward minors existed. According to reports, the Department of <b>Children</b> <b>and</b> <b>Family</b> Services (Los Angeles County) investigated Jackson beginning in 1993 with the Chandler allegation and again in 2003. Reports show the LAPD and DCFS did not find credible evidence of abuse or sexual misconduct.|$|E
5|$|Before {{releasing}} the documentary, Madonna invited {{a select group}} of friends and co-workers to watch a rough three-hour cut of the film at a local theater in Notting Hill. The film was trimmed after negative feedback regarding excessive details about Kabbalah. For the promotion and premiere of the film, Madonna appeared at Q sessions with the press and also gave a speech to film students at New York's Hunter College. Critical response to I'm Going to Tell You a Secret was mixed, with reviewers complimenting the live performances and the scenes involving her <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>family,</b> but criticizing the self-indulgent and preachy nature. I'm Going to Tell You a Secret was released in a two-disc format, a CD with 14 songs from the show and a DVD with the documentary film. It received a positive response from critics but was a moderate success commercially.|$|E

Pfeiffer handed her producing partner Guinzburg one final film to produce under the Via Rosa Productions header. The film was called, Original Sin (2001).

The film was produced by her company, but instead starred Angelina Jolie and Antonio Banderas.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to Voyagers {{exposure to the}} swarm, Kes (Jennifer Lien) begins eating abnormally, including insects and soil. In sickbay, she has a fever, a dangerously elevated pulse and blood pressure, and a tumorous growth on her back. She resists the ’s (Robert Picardo) treatment and locks herself in his office, finally relenting only to explain to Captain Janeway that she's undergoing the elogium: the Ocampa mating cycle. This process only happens once and usually affects Ocampa between four and five years old—but Kes is not even two. Neelix (Ethan Phillips) and Kes agonize over whether to have children and the ramifications of becoming parents. After discussing <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>family</b> with Lieutenant Tuvok (Tim Russ), Neelix decides he's ready to be a father, while Kes has instead decided against it. Ultimately, because the Doctor believes the elogium was artificially induced by the creatures' proximity to the ship, it may come upon her again later in her life when she is ready.|$|E
5|$|On 5 May 2016, James Reilly, then Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, {{announced}} that the Irish Government had approved {{the publication of the}} Adoption (Amendment) Bill 2016. The bill would amend the Adoption Act 2010 and the <b>Children</b> <b>and</b> <b>Family</b> Relationships Act 2015 and give legislative effect to the Thirty-first Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland (the children referendum). The purposes of the bill are to allow children to be adopted by their foster carers, where they have cared for the child for at least 18 months, and to allow two people regardless of marital status to adopt children, thus granting married same-sex couples the right to adopt. The bill also allows for the adoption of a child by civil partners and cohabiting couples and gives children a greater say in the adoption process, among many other reforms to the adoption system. The bill passed the Dáil on 30 November 2016, and received approval by the Seanad on 13 June 2017. The bill was signed into law by President Michael D. Higgins on 19 July 2017, becoming the Adoption (Amendment) Act 2017. The commencement order was signed by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Katherine Zappone, on 18 October and the law went into effect the following day.|$|E

5|$|The Re-Invention World Tour was {{the sixth}} concert tour by Madonna. It {{supported}} her ninth studio album American Life, and visited North America and Europe. Madonna {{was inspired to}} create the tour, after taking part in an art installation called X-STaTIC PRo=CeSS, directed by photographer Steven Klein. She incorporated the images from the installation in the tour, whose name was in reality a dig at Madonna's critics. A number of songs were rehearsed for the tour, with twenty-four of them making the final setlist. The tour was divided into five segments: French Baroque-Marie Antionette Revival, Military-Army, Circus-Cabaret, Acoustic and Scottish-Tribal. The tour garnered positive reception from contemporary critics. The tour was chronicled in the documentary titled I'm Going to Tell You a Secret. Originally called The Re-Invented Process {{in reference to the}} world tour it documents and the exhibition, it was filmed during Madonna's visit to North America and Europe during May 24 to September 14, 2004, and was directed by Jonas Åkerlund. Critical response towards the documentary was mixed, with one group of reviewers complimenting the live performances from the tour and the scenes involving her <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>family,</b> while others criticized the self-indulgent nature of the documentary and the preaching nature of Madonna's commentary in the film.|$|E

40|$|Background: Australia has a {{well-established}} universal <b>child</b> <b>and</b> <b>family</b> health service predominately staffed by specialist/qualified <b>child</b> <b>and</b> <b>family</b> health nurses. Two common and interrelated concerns are {{the need for}} nurses {{to be ready for}} practice after completing a nursing education program and the means to ensure ongoing nursing competence. Objective: To investigate the readiness of CFH nurses to practise after qualification and their continuing engagement with learning. Design: The study used an interpretive descriptive approach. Setting: This paper presents data from four questions from a larger survey of <b>child</b> <b>and</b> <b>family</b> health nurses across Australia. Participants: 1098 <b>child</b> <b>and</b> <b>family</b> health nurses responded to the survey. Method: Qualitative survey responses from the four education questions were analysed using inductive thematic content analysis. Results: Five significant themes were identified: hands-on experience (student clinical practice/placement); drawing on prior experience; learning on the job; learning (learning over time); and barriers to learning. Conclusion: This paper provides insights into nurses 2 ̆ 7 readiness for practice at the completion of a postgraduate <b>child</b> <b>and</b> <b>family</b> health nursing qualification and their maintenance of competence and specialist knowledge. It highlights: the need for clinical placement to be retained and enhanced; the significant contribution of more experienced <b>child</b> <b>and</b> <b>family</b> health nurses mentoring newly graduated <b>child</b> <b>and</b> <b>family</b> health nurses; the need for minimum education standards; the importance of reviewing education courses in relation to graduates 2 ̆ 7 readiness for <b>child</b> <b>and</b> <b>family</b> health nursing practice; the importance of supporting ongoing professional development; and the removal of barriers to accessing education opportunities...|$|R

25|$|A recent law journal note {{summarized}} the justifications for regulating payday lending. The summary notes {{that while it}} is difficult to quantify the impact on specific consumers, there are external parties who are clearly affected by the decision of a borrower to get a payday loan. Most directly impacted are the holders of other low interest debt from the same borrower, which now is less likely to be paid off since the limited income is first used to pay the fee associated with the payday loan. The external costs of this product can be expanded to include the businesses that are not patronized by the cash-strapped payday customer to the <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>family</b> who are left with fewer resources than before the loan. The external costs alone, forced on people given no choice in the matter, may be enough justification for stronger regulation even assuming that the borrower him or herself understood the full implications of the decision to seek a payday loan.|$|E
