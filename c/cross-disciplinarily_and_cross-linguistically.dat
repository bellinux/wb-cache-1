40|$|Many {{theories}} of phonology {{assume that the}} sound structure of language {{is made up of}} distinctive features, but there is considerable debate about how much articulatory detail distinctive features encode in long-term memory. Laryngeal features such as voicing provide a unique window into this question: while many languages have two-way contrasts that can be given a simple binary feature account [±VOICE], the precise articulatory details underlying these contrasts can vary significantly across languages. Here, we investigate a series of two-way voicing contrasts in English, Arabic, and Russian, three languages that implement their voicing contrasts very differently at the articulatory-phonetic level. In three event-related potential experiments contrasting English, Arabic, and Russian fricatives along with Russian stops, we observe a consistent pattern of asymmetric mismatch negativity (MMN) effects that is compatible with an articulatorily abstract <b>and</b> <b>cross-linguistically</b> uniform way of marking two-way voicing contrasts, as opposed to an articulatorily precise <b>and</b> <b>cross-linguistically</b> diverse way of encoding them.

Lambrecht (1987 : 218) suggests lexical SVO may not be the predominant pattern for spoken discourse in any language.

40|$|By {{examining}} ϕ-agreement {{in relative}} clauses, this paper investigates {{the relation between}} syntax and morphology {{in terms of the}} person feature. English relativized subjects appear to have different phi-features for the purposes of subject-verb agreement and binding relations. The verbal morphology uniformly displays 3 rd person whereas reflexive binding shows 1 st/ 2 nd person in addition to 3 rd person. If subject extraction must trigger an invariable verbal form as Ouhalla (1993) argues, the binding alternations cannot be accounted for. This paper proposes dual properties of the person feature based on Harley and Ritter’s (2002) feature geometry, and argues that relativized subjects may not obtain both properties of the person feature from the head noun via Agree. This partial agreement causes morphosyntactic variation in English <b>and</b> <b>cross-linguistically</b> in Distributed Morphology (DM).

40|$|This {{paper is}} a new {{investigation}} into the lexical distinction between the parts of speech, noun and verb, in two Oceanic languages, Tolai and Whitesands. It addresses crucial problems about what criteria {{can be used to}} define them and their associated syntactic structures. One problem in both languages is their typical Oceanic behaviour in regards to inalienable nouns. There exists an object-denoting root class, prototypically members of the noun class in non-Austronesian that have obligatory argument assignment. This phenomenon is problematic in many theoretical accounts of the noun/verb distinction, which argue that nouns contrast with verbs in not assigning argument structure. The approach proposed here claims the noun/verb contrast within Oceanic languages needs to be primarily at a phrasal not lexical level.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{investigates the}} {{interpretation}} and processing of simple transitive Catalan sentences with multiple negative expressions experimentally. Our results provide empirical confirmation that Negative Concord (NC) {{is the preferred}} and faster interpretation for negative sentences that either omit or contain the overt negative marker no 'not'. However, they also reveal that, in contrast to traditional descriptions of Catalan and independently of particular favoring contexts, a non-negligible amount of Double Negation (DN) readings arises, mainly when the negative marker co-occurs with pre-verbal Negative Concord Items (NCIs), and when these NCIs have a complex DP structure. Our results further suggest that two populations could be distinguished: one for whom the negative marker is optional and leaves the favored NC reading essentially unaffected, and another where the co-presence of no significantly increases DN readings. We account for these findings within a micro-parametric approach that features ambiguous NCIs (non-negative vs. negative) and a possible ambiguous negative marker no (negative vs. expletive) variably available for Catalan speakers. The nuanced empirical NC landscape that our experimental work reveals serves to {{stress the importance of}} taking DN readings into consideration for {{a better understanding of the}} nature of negative constructions in Catalan <b>and</b> <b>cross-linguistically...</b>|$|R
40|$|The argument-modifier {{distinction}} {{is less clear}} in NPs than in VPs; nouns do not typically take arguments. The clearest cases of arguments in NPs are in certain kinds of nominalizations which retain some "verbal" properties (Grimshaw 1990). The status of apparent arguments of non-deverbal relational nouns like sister is more controversial. Genitive constructions like 'John's teacher', 'team of John's' offer a challenging testing ground for the argument-modifier distinction in NPs, both in English <b>and</b> <b>cross-linguistically.</b> On the analyses of Partee (1983 / 97) and Barker (1995), the DP in a genitive phrase (i. e. 'John' in 'John's') is always an argument of some relation, but the relation does not always come from the head noun. On those "ambiguity" analyses, some genitives are argument-like and some are modifier-like. Recent proposals by Jensen and Vikner and by Borschev and Partee analyze all genitives as argument-like, a conclusion {{we are no longer}} sure of.

My analysis {{is based on a}} modification of Lasnik (1994) in order to account for a new type of English data which I call What About Answers. The resulting account entails that English clause structure has one inflectional node, which can be either an TAf or Agr. Cross-linguistically, languages can have universally allowed combinations of TAf, T+F and Agr. ^ In order for children to acquire the verbal morphology of their language, they must answer the following questions: Does my language have tense, Does my language have agreement, Is T affixal or featural in my language, For each verb class, is it lexically inflected or bare? I predict that children will answer the first two questions before the second two, and that they will not produce overt morphology without knowing the relevant syntactic features. ^ Further, children will determine all the relevant properties of a category before moving on to another. In order to empirically study these issues, I introduce a new methodology for studying children 2 ̆ 7 s spontaneous production data: including detailed Contextual Information (CI) in transcript data.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} structure of the noun phrase in Serbo-Croatian (SC) <b>and</b> <b>cross-linguistically</b> <b>and</b> argues that DP is not universal. ^ Chapters 2 and 3 examine the relationship between the Binding Theory and DP/NP. Chapter 2 explores Conditions B and C and argues that the most principled way of accounting for a number of binding contrasts between English and SC is to assume that the latter lacks DP. I propose a model which employs a predicate-based version of Condition B, Condition C as defined in Lasnik (1989), and a competitive mechanism which regulates the distribution of reflexives, pronouns, and R-expressions. ^ Chapter 3 discusses binding of reflexives. Two central proposals are: (i) phases are crucially involved in determining the binding domain for anaphors; (ii) in addition to CPs and νPs, DPs (but not NPs) qualify as phases. The analysis is situated within a general approach to phases, in which CPs and DPs do not always count as phases. I show that the proposed system deduces the generalization that reflexive possessives are available only in languages which lack definiteness marking, or which encode it postnominally, while they are systematically absent in languages with prenominal (article-like) definiteness marking. I extend this approach to the clausal domain, arguing that the lack of TP is the crucial reason why certain languages have subject anaphors. ^ Chapter 4 addresses an argument for DP in SC based on an asymmetry in the distribution of nouns and pronouns in constructions involving an intensifying adjective. I argue that the facts in question not only do not challenge, but in fact support the lack of DP in SC. I also show that in many cases overtly strong pronouns in focus positions are in fact 2 ̆ 2 camouflaged 2 ̆ 2 clitics. ^ Chapter 5 proposes an analysis of SC long-form/definite adjectives which does not require DP. Central to the analysis is the observation that the definite adjectival declension diachronically consisted of an indefinite adjective and an anaphoric pronoun declining in parallel. I also explain why Bulgarian and Macedonian, the only Slavic languages with definite articles, are also the only Slavic languages lacking long-form adjectives. ...|$|R
