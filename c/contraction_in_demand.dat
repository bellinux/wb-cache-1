50|$|In {{the late}} 1830s and early 1840s, the {{agricultural}} communities of south Wales were in dire poverty. In 1837 and 1838 {{the whole country}} suffered from poor harvests, worse in the south west, where atrocious seasons of rain forced farmers to buy corn at famine prices to feed themselves, their animals and their families, which further eroded what little capital they had. Grain harvests collapsed, but the price of butter between 1837 and 1841, and sheep between 1839 and 1841, was relatively high, and even the low cattle prices of 1839 recovered by 1841. But by 1842 a general fall in prices occurred throughout the agricultural markets that continued into 1843. Cattle prices slumped sharply in 1842, and the blame {{was placed on the}} Government, and in particular Robert Peel's tariff measures which eased importation of foreign cattle and meat. In 1842, the harvest {{was one of the most}} successful in years, and that, combined with the <b>contraction</b> <b>in</b> <b>demand</b> from the Glamorgan ironworks, led to a slump in corn prices. The farmers' economic position had therefore shifted from that of dire grain harvests with life supported by sheep and butter sales, to one where the price of their corn, when the weather was favourable, was very low. The diminution of the Glamorgan ironworks, coupled with the new tariff, also had an adverse effect on the prices of butter, cheese, pigs, horses, sheep and lean cattle, impacting harshly on the Welsh pastoral farmer.|$|E

The sharp <b>contraction</b> <b>in</b> <b>demand</b> generated massive layoffs, {{a sharp drop in}} employment and a rise in unemployment. While total employment and private sector employment have been growing steadily by 178, 000 jobs per month and 188, 000 jobs per month on average, respectively, since February 2010, 1 the loss of jobs during the Great Recession was so great that the economy only recently (in May 2014) recovered the 8.7 million jobs it lost. Unemployment reached a peak of 10 percent in October 2010 and has been declining steadily since. Indeed, the share of the short-term unemployed has returned to pre-recession levels, so the continued high unemployment reflects the larger share of long-term unemployed during the recovery. As explained below, the large share of long-term unemployed has important implications in terms of the speed at which the unemployment rate can continue to fall.|$|E

Focusing on a particular type of legal work – major corporate transactions – this Article proposes a novel theory of the value created by elite law firms: their private information about “market” deal terms, acquired through repeated exposure to the same types of transactions, provides clients with a significant bargaining advantage in deal negotiations. By aggregating expertise in the ever-changing and ever-increasing set of deal terms for certain transactions, law firms help their clients price such terms more accurately and thereby maximize their surplus from the deal. This pricing function – traditionally thought to be limited to investment banks – is one that cannot be replicated or subsumed by in-house counsel, other service providers, or commoditized contracts...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} role of {{financial}} markets in the interna-tional transmission mechanism {{in the context of}} a two-country gen-eral equilibrium model. I incorporate realistic frictions with respect to the external financing of investment, and I calibrate these fric-tions to reflect important differences in lending institutions between developed and developing economies. To overcome these frictions, the paper focuses, in particular, on {{the role of}} leverage in transmit-ting shocks from developed economies to developing economies. The results imply that high-leverage economies are particularly vulner-able to external shocks, and that asymmetries between lending con-ditions across economies provide a strong source of transmission for shocks from developed to developing economies. Furthermore, slow-downs in economic activity are severely amplified by financial fric-tions. The model implies that the degree of amplification is directly related to the degree of leverage in the economy. In many developing economies, firms face significant capital mar-ket imperfections when raising external funds to finance new invest-ment projects. These frictions stem from underlying asymmetries of information between borrowers and lenders. To overcoming these frictions, lenders must either engage in costly monitoring activities or require significant levels of collateral when financing investment projects. In such an environment, fluctuations in world demand lead to fluctuations in asset values that influence the overall level of self-financing. A <b>contraction</b> <b>in</b> <b>demand</b> causes asset values and hence net worth to fall relative to financing needs. As a result, borrowe...|$|E

40|$|Initially, {{the global}} {{financial}} crisis caused a surge of financial inflows to China, raising investment, but this abated in 2008, leaving a substantial <b>contraction</b> <b>in</b> export <b>demand.</b> The government’s key response was to commit to an unprecedented fiscal expansion. Two oft-ignored consequences are, first that government spending is on non-traded goods and services and so enlarges the consequent real appreciation and, second, that a more inward-looking economy causes firms to face less elastic demand and hence to increase oligopoly rents, further enlarging the real appreciation. Both are important for China because of the contribution of its real-exchange-rate sensitive, low-margin labour-intensive export sector to total employment. An economy-wide analysis is offered, using a model that takes explicit account of oligopoly behaviour. The results suggest that a conventional fiscal expansion would further contract the Chinese economy.

This paper discusses the main mechanisms behind the global downturn in trade and its impact on euro area exports and competitiveness. It finds that the euro area was hit particularly hard by the <b>contraction</b> <b>in</b> global <b>demand.</b> Moreover, the collapse <b>in</b> the <b>demand</b> for euro area products during the downturn was exacerbated to some degree by unfavourable developments in price competitiveness, resulting in further losses in competitiveness compared to our main trading partners, in line with pre-crisis trends. This view is also confi rmed by evidence from broad-based competitiveness measures, which show that euro area countries recorded losses in productivity during this period. Going forward, the recovery in world trade will depend mainly on a resurgence <b>in</b> global <b>demand</b> and its expenditure composition. With regard to the euro area, as the global economy recovers at varying speeds and given the current growth momentum in emerging economies, the performance of the external sector may be hindered by the geographical orientation of its export markets, which are mainly focused on advanced economies and other EU member states. Furthermore, the strength and sustainability of the recovery in exports will also depend on the structuring process undertaken by European fi rms in response to globalisation-related challenges. Governments within the European Union should therefore focus on policies to strengthen competition and increase market integration, in order to benefit fully from the globalisation process going forward. In contrast, a resurgence in global protectionist policies could dampen the prospects for world and euro area trade and should be strongly resisted.

40|$|The {{introductory}} part of {{this thesis}} identifies developments in world financial markets, and then focuses upon the financial crisis that afflicted East Asia and Thailand in particular. The crisis in Thailand that began in mid 1997 occurred due {{to a loss of}} intemational and domestic confidence in the Thai economy arising from the weakness of its financial sector. This in tum is attributed to madequate pmdential regulation that resulted in an excessive stock market boom and a real estate bubble, in which foreign loans were used to finance non-productive investment in land and properties. A dynamic macroeconomic model for the Thai economy was constmcted by emphasizing the impact aspect of the Thai crisis: namely the impact of a jump in the perceived financial risk in investing in the Thai economy; the impact of an increase of short-term flows in financing non-productive investments; and the impact of a collapse in aggregate supply resulting from financial and corporate sector insolvencies. In addition, government policy advocated by the IMF in response to the Thai financial crisis in the initial stage is explicitly analyzed and compared with the Radelet and Sachs (RS) policy approach. The major conclusion from the simulation results presented is that an exogenous shock arising from a temporary increase in the perceived risk of Thai financial assets during the onset of the crisis period, in conjunction with the collapse in aggregate supply as a result of financial and corporate sector insolvencies, can lead to a Severe temporary economic <b>contraction</b> both <b>in</b> domestic <b>demand</b> and supply. Implementing the IMF approach, by tightening monetary and fiscal policies in the initial stage of the crisis, could strengthen the real exchange rate in the short mn but at a potentially high cost. Such a policy contraction contributes to a more protracted decline in aggregate supply and private capital stock, the latter being detrimental for long-term economic growth and aggregate demand. The IMF approach produces more favorable effects in terms of external developments (more stabilized exchange rate), while the RS approach brings about favourable effects upon domestic demand and supply. The simulation results suggest that adopting the RS approach is an appropriate policy option in the short-term, particularly in dealing with such a crisis in the early stage. The RS policy approach eases the crisis in its initial stages arising from the abmpt and severe <b>contraction</b> <b>in</b> domestic <b>demand</b> and supply, but it comes at the cost of the larger depreciation of the real exchange rate than that for the IMF approach. Restmcturing of the financial sector is important but needs a more comprehensive and well-thought-out financial restmcturing plan, otherwise it may lead to a more protracted <b>contraction</b> <b>in</b> economic activities. Encouraging long-term flows is also essential because they can generate a larger accumulation of private capital stock and a higher level of aggregate supply relative to short-term flows...|$|R

The main policy tool for this task is sterilization [...] essentially a swap of international reserves for public bonds. However, {{there is an}} extensive debate {{on the effectiveness of}} this policy, with many arguing that it may be counterproductive once the (over-) reaction of the private sector is considered. But what forces account for the private sector's reaction remains largely unexplained. In this paper we provide a model to discuss these issues. We first demonstrate that policies to smooth expansions in anticipation of downturns can be Pareto improving in economies where domestic financial markets are underdeveloped. We then discuss the implementation of this policy via sterilization, outlining cases in which the policy succeeds and those in which it fails. Paradoxically the greatest risk of policy arises in situations where policy is most needed [...] that is when financial markets are illiquid. Our mechanism is akin to the ``implicit bailout" problem, {{despite the fact that the}} central bank acts non-selectively and only intervenes through open markets; illiquidity replaces corruption and ineptitude.

40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades the {{proportion}} of people suffering long-term unemployment has risen in the developed countries. It is agreed that transitory shocks to aggregate demand initially contributed to the high rates of unemployment but there are divergent views as to why these high rates have persisted. Some suggest that these shocks may influence structural factors on the supply-side of the economy. Darity and Goldsmith (1993; 1996) propose a labour market model in which the deleterious psychological effects of unemployment cause <b>contractions</b> <b>in</b> labour <b>demand</b> and supply to persist thus exacerbating unemployment. The model is outlined and the psychology literature concerning its tenets is reviewed. The literature is reviewed as to whether and how social relationships and support ameliorate the psychological distress associated with unemployment. To determine whether unemployment is psychologically deleterious and whether this may be offset by certain types and sources of social support, an exploratory survey examined a small cross-section of people registered with Work and Income New Zealand (WINZ) as unemployed a year before the study. The respondents included people who remained unemployed throughout the entire period, people who had experienced recurrent spells of unemployment and people who had re-entered paid employment and were employed when surveyed. No difference in psychological wellbeing was found on the basis of employment status but differences were found in perceptions of the availability of different types of support from different sources. Those who were re-employed when they were surveyed gained psychological benefits from support derived from the immediate family and associative relationships (e. g. neighbours, workplace and leisure associates). Emotional and socialising support derived from the immediate family appeared to be particularly psychologically beneficial. The analysis further indicates that psychologically healthy and distressed individuals differ in their perceptions of the availability of support from the immediate family and in the availability of financial support from the overall network...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{contributes}} to the discipline of historical research through the detailed local study and analysis of micro-economic developments and social trends within the 'market town' of Cranbrook, Kent and its neighbouring parishes. In particular this study examines the symbiotic relationship between the market town as a nodal point for industry and commerce {{within the context of}} the local economy and social structure of its rural hinterland. The nature and incidence of demographic growth within Cranbrook's neighbourhood during local periods of epidemic disease and economic dislocation, provide a context in which to examine the extent to which the Wealden wood pasture agrarian regime could absorb and sustain demographic growth within individual local economies. Social relations within Cranbrook, show that the town was not isolated from its rural hinterland. The inhabitants of the town and the countryside interacted within a local economy based upon textile manufacture and farming, which effectively defined the complex social hierarchy of the 'neighbourhood'. Kinship-networks among longstanding resident families and their comparative status, wealth and influence within individual parishes, show the importance of familial relationships to business success and social status within the community. Parish office holding among Cranbrook's 'chief inhabitants' are explored within the concepts of religious ideology and social control in early modem England. Cranbrook society is examined within the context of developing religious attitudes and puritan ideas, which took hold and flourished in this period. The thesis also investigates the slow decline of the broadcloth industry in the region and {{contributes to}} the proto-industrialization debate. The effect of economic recession in broadcloth manufacture is examined against the decline of the neighbourhood population, the <b>contraction</b> <b>in</b> market <b>demand</b> for Wealden broadcloth and increased poverty.
