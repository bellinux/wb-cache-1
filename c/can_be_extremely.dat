5|$|Phoenix and the {{surrounding}} areas are also home {{to a wide variety}} of native invertebrates including the Arizona bark scorpion, giant desert hairy scorpion, Arizona blond tarantula, Sonoran Desert centipede, tarantula hawk wasp, camel spider, and tailless whip scorpion. Of great concern is the presence of Africanized bees which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>extremely</b> dangerous—even lethal—when provoked.|$|E
5|$|Its great {{distance}} and surprising activity indicated that comet Hale–Bopp might become very bright indeed when it reached perihelion in 1997. However, comet scientists were wary – comets <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>extremely</b> unpredictable, {{and many have}} large outbursts at {{great distance}} only to diminish in brightness later. Comet Kohoutek in 1973 had been touted as a 'comet of the century' and {{turned out to be}} unspectacular.|$|E
5|$|Paterson's worms are {{a family}} of {{cellular}} automata devised in 1971 by Mike Paterson and John Horton Conway to model the behaviour and feeding patterns of certain prehistoric worms. In the model, a worm moves between points on a triangular grid along line segments, representing food. Its turnings {{are determined by the}} configuration of eaten and uneaten line segments adjacent to {{the point at which the}} worm currently is. Despite being governed by simple rules the behaviour of the worms <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>extremely</b> complex, and the ultimate fate of one variant is still unknown.|$|E

5|$|The {{medical costs}} for catastrophic {{injuries}} <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>extremely</b> high—a 2011 estimate from the National Spinal Cord Injury Statistical Center notes that first-year costs {{of someone who}} has high tetraplegia, an injury that causes partial or full loss of use in all limbs, is USD $1,044,097, with subsequent years costing $181,328. Many high schools across the United States require students to have an insurance policy, while others offer supplementary insurance to help offset the cost; some schools also request that boosters help families pay for these policies.|$|E
5|$|Several {{disorders}} {{affect the}} motility of food as it travels down the esophagus. This can cause difficult swallowing, called dysphagia, or painful swallowing, called odynophagia. Achalasia {{refers to a}} failure of the lower esophageal sphincter to relax properly, and generally develops later in life. This leads to progressive enlargement of the esophagus, and possibly eventual megaesophagus. A nutcracker esophagus refers to swallowing that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>extremely</b> painful. Diffuse esophageal spasm is a spasm of the esophagus that can be one cause of chest pain. Such referred pain to the wall of the upper chest is quite common in esophageal conditions. Sclerosis of the esophagus, such as with systemic sclerosis or in CREST syndrome may cause hardening of the walls of the esophagus and interfere with peristalsis.|$|E
5|$|Because an ASIC is (by definition) {{specific}} {{to a given}} application, it can be fully optimized for that application. As a result, for a given application, an ASIC tends to outperform a general-purpose computer. However, ASICs are created by UV photolithography. This process requires a mask set, which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>extremely</b> expensive. A mask set can cost over a million US dollars. (The smaller the transistors required for the chip, the more expensive the mask will be.) Meanwhile, performance increases in general-purpose computing over time (as described by Moore's law) tend to wipe out these gains in {{only one or two}} chip generations. High initial cost, and the tendency to be overtaken by Moore's-law-driven general-purpose computing, has rendered ASICs unfeasible for most parallel computing applications. However, some have been built. One example is the PFLOPS RIKEN MDGRAPE-3 machine which uses custom ASICs for molecular dynamics simulation.|$|E
50|$|Some vermetids are solitary, {{whereas others}} live in colonies, {{partially}} cemented together. The shells of species within this family vary greatly and <b>can</b> sometimes <b>be</b> <b>extremely</b> challenging to identify.|$|R
30|$|As an {{approximation}} for the outage probability, {{the bounds}} <b>can</b> <b>be</b> an <b>extremely</b> useful tool. The following section gives some practical examples of their utility.|$|R
50|$|Bivalves {{are often}} the most common seashells that wash up on large sandy beaches or in {{sheltered}} lagoons. They <b>can</b> sometimes <b>be</b> <b>extremely</b> numerous. Very often the two valves become separated.|$|R
5|$|Storm petrels nest colonially, for {{the most}} part on islands, {{although}} a few species breed on the mainland, particularly Antarctica. Nesting sites are attended nocturnally in order to avoid predators; the wedge-rumped storm petrels nesting in the Galapagos Islands are the exception to this rule and attend their nesting sites during the day. Storm petrels display high levels of philopatry, returning to their natal colonies to breed. In one instance a band-rumped storm petrel was caught as an adult 2m from its natal burrow. Storm petrels nest either in burrows dug into soil or sand, or in small crevices in rocks and scree. Competition for nesting sites is intense in colonies where storm petrels compete with other burrowing petrels, with shearwaters having been recorded killing storm petrels in order to occupy their burrows. Colonies <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>extremely</b> large and dense densities as high as 8 pairs/m2 for band-rumped storm petrels in the Galapagos and colonies 3.6 million strong for Leach's storm petrel have been recorded.|$|E
5|$|When a film {{is highly}} exploitable as a {{commercial}} property, its ancillary revenues can dwarf its income from direct film sales. The Lion King earned over $2 billion in box-office and home video sales, but this {{pales in comparison to}} the $6 billion earned at box offices around the world by the stage adaptation. Merchandising <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>extremely</b> lucrative too: The Lion King also sold $3 billion of merchandise, while Pixar's Cars—which earned $462 million in theatrical revenues and was only a modest hit by comparison to other Pixar films—generated global merchandise sales of over $8 billion in the five years after its 2006 release. Pixar also had another huge hit with Toy Story 3, which generated almost $10 billion in merchandise retail sales in addition to the $1 billion it earned at the box office.|$|E

50|$|A strong {{organizational}} culture <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> <b>extremely</b> influential in mitigating {{the risk of}} negative behavior. This is because members themselves can “punish” those who act in a negative way. This <b>can</b> <b>be</b> done through pressuring them into conforming to the practices of the organization.|$|R
5000|$|Time stated, [...] "Peter Boyle [...] [...] [...] and James Caan [...] [...] [...] do {{the best}} they <b>can,</b> which <b>is</b> <b>extremely</b> well indeed, but the movie's clumsy feints at sophistication and its {{grotesque}} sentimentality prevail." ...|$|R
25|$|Litter <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>extremely</b> hazardous. Debris {{falling from}} {{vehicles}} {{is an increasing}} cause of automobile accidents. Discarded dangerous goods, chemicals, tires, sharps waste and pathogens resulting from litter can cause accidental harm to humans.|$|E
25|$|Summers {{are long}} in Isfana, usually lasting from May to September. Isfana <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>extremely</b> hot {{during the summer}} months. The town also sees very little {{precipitation}} during the summer, particularly from June through September.|$|E

500|$|Nomen dubium (Latin for [...] "dubious name"): A name {{describing}} a fossil with no unique diagnostic features. As this <b>can</b> <b>be</b> an <b>extremely</b> subjective and controversial designation (see Hadrosaurus), this term {{is not used}} on this list.|$|R
25|$|Insect flight <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>extremely</b> fast, maneuverable, and versatile, {{possibly}} due to {{the changing}} shape, extraordinary control, and variable motion of the insect wing. Insect orders use different flight mechanisms; for example, the flight of a butterfly can be explained using steady-state, nontransitory aerodynamics, and thin airfoil theory.|$|E
25|$|Kimono {{need to be}} aired out {{at least}} {{seasonally}} and before and after each time they are worn. Many people prefer to have their kimono dry cleaned. Although this <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>extremely</b> expensive, it is generally less expensive than arai hari but may be impossible for certain fabrics or dyes.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} {{residential}} colleges at the university: Brown College, Hereford College, and the International Residential College.
