5|$|Section 10 {{requires}} the authorisation of any prosecution {{by the director}} of the appropriate prosecution agency before a case can go ahead; this is a shift from the old regime, which required the consent of the Attorney General for England and Wales. Section 11 explains the penalties for individuals and companies found guilty of committing a crime. If an individual is found guilty of a bribery offence, tried as a summary offence, they may be imprisoned for up to 12 months and fined up to £5,000. Someone found guilty on indictment, however, faces up to 10 years' imprisonment and an unlimited fine. The crime of a commercial organisation failing to prevent bribery is punishable by an unlimited fine. In addition, a convicted individual or organisation may be subject to a <b>confiscation</b> <b>order</b> under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, while a company director who is convicted may be disqualified under the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986.|$|E
2500|$|Shaik and his {{companies}} (Nkobi Holdings and Nkobi Investments) then {{appealed to}} the Constitutional Court to question {{the validity of the}} <b>confiscation</b> <b>order</b> regarding R33 million of their assets. The original court authorised the confiscation under the Prevention of Organised Crime Act (POCA), since it held that they constitute proceeds of crime. In April 2008 the Constitutional Court dismissed this appeal, finding that Shaik and his companies had received their shareholdings in Thint, a major ground for the asset forfeiture order, as a result of [...] "the corrupt payments" [...] made to Zuma, and that the remainder of the order related to dividends that accrued due to this shareholding.|$|E

In 2003 through January 2005, Israel demolished Palestinian houses in Ain Jawaizeh and issued demolition orders against 53 other houses. Land <b>confiscation</b> <b>orders</b> issued by the IDF in August 2003 showed that the route of the barrier will completely surround the residents of the village, allowing them only one entry/exit point. The two main access routes for Ain Jawaizeh to Bethlehem were both closed, and the only access road to Jerusalem was restricted for access to Har Gilo by Israeli-licensed vehicles only. In April 2005, fruit orchards were cut down and homes were demolished due to the absence of building permits to make place {{for the construction of}} the barrier.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of two theoretical chapters, focusing on dynamic games, and one empirical chapter. In Chapter 1, I consider a repeated game in which, due to imperfect monitoring, no collusion can be sustained. I add a self-interested monitor who commits to generating an imperfect private signal of firmsâ actions and sends a public message. The monitor makes an offer specifying the precision of the signal generated and the amount to be paid in return. I show that with low monitoring cost, collusive equilibria exist. In the monitor's favorite collusive equilibrium, firmsâ payoffs are decreasing in the discount factor. My model helps explain the cartel agreements between the mafia and firms in legal industries in Italy and America. In Chapter 2, I consider a bargaining game with two types of players â rational and stubborn. Rational players choose demands at each point in time. Stubborn players are restricted to choose a bargaining strategy from a proper subset of strategies available to rational players. In the simplest case, stubborn players are restricted to choose from the set of "insistent" strategies that always make the same demand and never accept anything less. However, their initial choice of demand is unrestricted. I characterize the equilibria in this game, showing how {{the flexibility of the}} stubborn type changes equilibrium predictions. Chapter 3 estimates the effect of longer prison sentences on criminal asset recovery, using administrative, cross-sectional data on <b>confiscation</b> <b>orders</b> in the UK. <b>Confiscation</b> <b>orders</b> request convicted offenders to pay the value of their criminal assets, and specify a prison sentence to be served in the case of non-payment. Using a fuzzy RDD, I exploit discontinuous changes in the legal maximum of this prison sentence. There is evidence that longer prison sentences incentivize offenders to pay. </p...|$|R

This article considers the defendant’s ‘benefit’ from crime which may be assessed at a much higher amount than that which has passed through his hands. It focuses on three problem areas: cases involving joint defendants, the operation of statutory ‘assumptions’, and the discretion afforded to the court in confiscation proceedings...|$|R
