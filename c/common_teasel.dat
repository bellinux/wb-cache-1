50|$|<b>Common</b> <b>teasel</b> (Dipsacus fullonum) and cut-leaved teasel (Dipsacus laciniatus) {{have both}} been {{observed}} as invasive species in the United States. Common is more widespread, but cut-leaved is more aggressive.|$|E
50|$|This {{plant is}} a {{perennial}} herb that may {{grow up to}} two to three meters in height. The erect, branching stem is hollow and prickly. The leaves are oppositely arranged, each leaf pair joined around the stem and clasping it, their bases forming a cup which often collects water. The species is monocarpic, living for multiple years but only flowering once before dying. The inflorescence is an egg-shaped head subtended by long bracts. The head may contain up to 1500 flowers. Each individual flower lasts one day. The middle of the head blooms first and then {{the upper and lower}} parts. The fruit is an achene just under a centimeter long. The plant reproduces only by seed. This teasel may be distinguished from its relative, <b>common</b> <b>teasel</b> (Dipsacus fullonum) by flower color and leaf shape. Cutleaf teasel has white flowers and deeply cut leaves, while <b>common</b> <b>teasel</b> has purple flowers and toothed or wavy-edged leaves.|$|E

50|$|Dipsacus laciniatus is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the honeysuckle family known by the <b>common</b> name cutleaf <b>teasel.</b> It is native to Europe and Asia. It is present in North America as an introduced species and invasive weed.|$|R
50|$|The Dipsacaceae {{have been}} {{recognized}} as a family (the teasel family) of the order Dipsacales containing 350 species of perennial or biennial herbs and shrubs in eleven genera. The species are currently placed in the family Caprifoliaceae. Native to most temperate climates, they are found in Europe, Asia, and Africa. Some species of this family have been naturalized in other places. The spikes of the <b>common</b> <b>teasel</b> (pictured right) are not particularly spiny and may be quite soft. In some places, the spikes are used in cotton threading.|$|E
40|$|<b>Common</b> <b>teasel</b> (Dipsacus fullonum L.) {{has become}} an {{aggressive}} invasive species throughout most of North America, invading roadsides, ditches, rights of way, pastures, and natural areas. This study examined three herbicides used to control common teasel: 1) BK 800, a 2, 4 -D based broad-leaf herbicide mixed in diesel fuel; 2) Glyphomax® a non-selective glyphosate-based product mixed in water with 5 mL/L of a non-ionic surfactant (Nu-Film®-IR) added; and 3) Transline®, a clopyralid based broad-leaf herbicide used for non-crop areas with 5 mL/L of the Nu-Film®-IR. The herbicides were applied in three concentrations taken directly from the label specifications: the low end, the high end, and the midpoint between the low and high ends. Plant rosette counts taken two weeks after application were compared to counts taken earlier to create a "survival ratio. " The majority of the applications resulted in total kill of all <b>common</b> <b>teasel</b> rosettes. Ratios were compared among all treatment groups and the control. All herbicide treatments resulted in significantly (p< 0. 001) more kills than the control. The different concentrations of each treatment were compared against each other to determine the optimum concentration for <b>common</b> <b>teasel</b> control. The 2 mL/L concentration of Transline®, the 13 mL/L concentration of Glyphomax® and the 55 mL/L of BK 800 were the most effective treatments. There {{was no significant difference}} among the efficacies of the three above herbicides. This study provides the first known quantitative study of herbicidal control of <b>common</b> <b>teasel,</b> and it should serve {{as a starting point for}} future studies on controlling this invasive plant.

40|$|This study {{recorded}} the initial, short-term {{effects of the}} new growing-season prescribed fire regime on portions of Cooper Farm’s tallgrass prairie habitat, {{as compared to the}} portions receiving the current regime of dormant-season burns. The goal was to gather data that {{can be used as a}} starting point for future investigations of the long-term effects of the new burn regime, specifically the hypothesis that it will alter vegetation composition in such a way as to encourage greater diversity of small mammal species on the property. Analysis of the data gathered approximately one month following the growing-season burns showed that percent cover of both grass and forb species was lower in the growing-season burn sections, while there was no significant difference in small mammal diversity between dormant- and growing-season burn sections. Investigation of the possible spread of the invasive species Dipsacus fullonum (<b>common</b> <b>teasel)</b> into the growing-season burn sections compared to the dormant-season sections was inconclusive.

50|$|Dipsacus fullonum, syn. Dipsacus sylvestris, is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant known by the <b>common</b> names wild <b>teasel</b> or fuller's teasel, although the latter name is usually applied to the cultivated species Dipsacus sativus. It is native to Eurasia and North Africa, but it is known in the Americas, southern Africa, Australia and New Zealand as an introduced species and often a noxious weed. The inflorescence is a cylindrical array of lavender flowers which dries to a cone of spine-tipped hard bracts. It may be 10 centimeters long.|$|R
40|$|Many {{biennial}} and {{perennial weeds}} seem to appear first in non-disturbed sites like roadsides. Such {{is the case}} of the biennial teasel (Dipsacus spp.) and the perennial leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula L.). Teasel is a new arrival and is appearing in several areas of southern Wisconsin. Leafy spurge has been here for decades, is found in many areas of Wisconsin and is invading new areas more rapidly than in the past. In this paper, I will describe the concern, give the plants ’ key characteristics, review their biology, and discuss the management practices to control them. Teasel is a biennial that originated in Europe. It was introduced into the United States perhaps in the 1700 s so that their fruiting heads with spiny bracts could be used to raise the nap on woolen cloth. Plants were grown by the textile industry and the dried flower heads were placed on spindles to “tease ” the cloth and this gave rise to the plant’s common name. Today, teasel is dried and used in ornamental flower arrangements. Wherever it occurs, it can soon spread into new areas. Missouri recently added both common (Dipsacus laciniatus) and cutleaf teasel (D. sylvestris) to their noxious weed list showing their level of concern with its invasiveness. Cutleaf teasel is more invasive than <b>common</b> <b>teasel</b> (Glass, 1990) and most of th...|$|E
40|$|Two {{closely related}} teasels (Dipsacales: Dipsacaceae, Dipsacus spp.) of European origin have become {{invasive}} weeds in the United States. <b>Common</b> <b>teasel</b> (Dipsacus fullonum L.) and cutleaf teasel (Dipsacus laciniatus L.) have likely been in North America {{for more than}} two centuries, having been introduced along with cultivated teasel [D. sativus (L.) Honckney], an obsolete crop plant. There are few records of American insects or pathogens attacking Dipsacus spp. Invasive teasels have recently begun to spread rapidly throughout much of their current range, for reasons that are not yet known. Common and/or cut-leaf teasel have been listed as noxious in Wve US states and as invasive in 12 other states and four national parks. Because the family Dipsacaceae is an exclusively Old World family, classical biological control is {{an important component of the}} overall management strategy of this weed in the US. Field surveys for natural enemies of D. fullonum and D. laciniatus in their native ranges and literature reviews of natural enemies of plants in the family Dipsacaceae have yielded 102 species of insects in six orders, as well as 27 fungi from 10 orders, three mites, one nematode, and two viruses. Due to the biennial nature of these weeds, a strategy to assign highest priority to biological control candidates attacking Wrst-year (rosette) plants has been established. Candidates selected for further study based on this strategy include Chromatomyia ramosa (Hendel) (Diptera: Agromyzidae), Longitarsus strigicollis Wollaston (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), Epitrimerus knautiae Liro (Acarina: Eriophyiidae), Euphydryas desfontainii (Godart) (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae), Erysiphe knautiae Duby (Erysiphales: Erysiphaceae), and Sphaerotheca dipsacearum (Tul. and C. Tul.) (Erysiphales: Erysiphaceae) ...|$|E
