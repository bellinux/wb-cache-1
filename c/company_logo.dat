25|$|Some taxicab {{companies}} are independently owned small businesses {{with only one}} taxicab and driver, but many cab companies have fleets of 100 or more taxicabs. Drivers are rarely employees of the company, and usually lease the taxicab on a per-shift basis. Lease drivers receive no benefits from the taxicab company, and often have to bribe dispatchers to get a shift. However, in some cases, cabs can also be owned by separately-incorporated small businesses that subscribe to a dispatch service, {{in which case the}} <b>company</b> <b>logo</b> on the door is that of the dispatch association. The owner/driver will pay a monthly fee to the taxicab company; purchase and maintain his own vehicle; and may in turn lease shifts to other drivers.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{acquisition}} of Burger King by TPG Capital in 2002, its new CEO Bradley (Brad) Blum set about reversing {{the fortunes of the}} company's advertising programs. The company reinstated its famous Have it your way motto and engaged Miami-based advertising agency Crispin Porter + Bogusky (CP+B), which was known for having a hip, subversive tack when creating campaigns for its clients. CP+B updated Burger King's image and changed its marketing strategy. The cups, bags and the <b>company</b> <b>logo</b> were redesigned with the intent to give and BK an appealing, culturally aware and modern image. Humorous statements, claims and product descriptions were printed on bags, product packaging and on in-store promotional materials, including a Burger King Bill of Rights, using the slogan Have it Your Way. CP+B created an advertising campaign that focused on television spots, print, web and product tie-ins.|$|E

[...] Jackson encouraged a lighting designer from Clair Brothers to sketch a <b>company</b> <b>logo</b> on a cocktail napkin over dinner one evening, and that was immediately made the Apogee logo.|$|E
