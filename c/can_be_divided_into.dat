5|$|The GCD can be visualized as follows. Consider a {{rectangular}} area a by b, and any common divisor c that divides both a and b exactly. The {{sides of the}} rectangle <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>divided</b> <b>into</b> segments of length c, which divides the rectangle into a grid of squares of side length c. The greatest common divisor g is the largest value of c for which this is possible. For illustration, a 24-by-60 rectangular area <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>divided</b> <b>into</b> a grid of: 1-by-1 squares, 2-by-2 squares, 3-by-3 squares, 4-by-4 squares, 6-by-6 squares or 12-by-12 squares. Therefore, 12 is the greatest common divisor of 24 and 60. A 24-by-60 rectangular area <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>divided</b> <b>into</b> a grid of 12-by-12 squares, with two squares along one edge (24/12=2) and five squares along the other (60/12=5).|$|E

5|$|Adult Pteranodon {{specimens}} {{from the}} two major species <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>divided</b> <b>into</b> two distinct size classes. The smaller class of specimens have small, rounded head crests and very wide pelvic canals, even wider {{than those of the}} much larger size class. The size of the pelvic canal probably allowed the laying of eggs, indicating that these smaller adults are females. The larger size class, representing male individuals, have narrow hips and very large crests, which were probably for display.|$|E
5|$|Davenport {{has several}} neighborhoods {{dating back to}} the 1840s. The {{original}} city plot was around current day Ripley and 5th Streets, where Antoine Le Claire had built his house. The city <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>divided</b> <b>into</b> five areas: downtown, central, east end, near north and northwest, and west end. Many architectural designs are found throughout the city including Victorian, Queen Anne, Tudor Revival, and others. Many of the original neighborhoods were inhabited by German settlers.|$|E
5|$|Despite their {{apparent}} simplicity, {{bacteria can}} form complex associations with other organisms. These symbiotic associations <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>divided</b> <b>into</b> parasitism, mutualism and commensalism. Due to their small size, commensal bacteria are ubiquitous and grow on {{animals and plants}} exactly as they will grow on any other surface. However, their growth can be increased by warmth and sweat, and large populations of these organisms in humans are the cause of body odour.|$|E

5|$|From the {{viewpoint}} of gross anatomy, the cerebellar cortex {{appears to be a}} homogeneous sheet of tissue, and, from {{the viewpoint}} of microanatomy, all parts of this sheet appear to have the same internal structure. There are, however, a number of respects in which the structure of the cerebellum is compartmentalized. There are large compartments that are generally known as zones; these <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>divided</b> <b>into</b> smaller compartments known as microzones.|$|E
5|$|Insects <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>divided</b> <b>into</b> {{two groups}} {{historically}} treated as subclasses: wingless insects, known as Apterygota, and winged insects, known as Pterygota. The Apterygota consist of the primitively wingless {{order of the}} silverfish (Zygentoma). Archaeognatha make up the Monocondylia based on the shape of their mandibles, while Zygentoma and Pterygota are grouped together as Dicondylia. The Zygentoma themselves possibly are not monophyletic, with the family Lepidotrichidae being a sister group to the Dicondylia (Pterygota and the remaining Zygentoma).|$|E
5|$|Not much {{is known}} about the life history of hawksbills. Their life history <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>divided</b> <b>into</b> three phases, namely the pelagic phase, from {{hatching}} to about 20cm, the benthic phase, when the immature turtles recruit to foraging areas, and the reproductive phase, when they reach sexual maturity. The pelagic phase possibly lasts until the turtles reach around 20cm in length in 1–3 years, reaching sexual maturity at around 40cm (2–4 years).|$|E
