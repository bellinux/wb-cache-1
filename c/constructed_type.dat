Two of the strongest examples of this interaction are the representation of function types as exponential objects in a cartesian closed category [LS 86] and the description of polymorphic terms as natural transformations (e. g.

40|$|Abstract. The 3 D and 2 D type {{maps for}} planar four-bar and simply RSSR {{linkages}} are constructed with illustration of their application. The criteria determining the rotatability of input or output link are developed or reviewed for both linkages. Three-dimensional type maps are then constructed by integrating the tool for numerical analysis and solid modeling software, e. g. MATLAB and PRO/E. The coordinate axes are mainly three ratios of link lengths. The types are classified {{based on whether}} the input or output link can make fully rotation. Each type map is composed of five regions representing different types. They are drag link, crank-rocker, rocker-crank, double-rocker, and unassembled. Any cross sections can be taken readily and arbitrarily from the 3 D models along any plane or surfaces to get 2 D type maps. The <b>constructed</b> <b>type</b> maps are also combined with curves or surfaces representing performances of transmission ratio. With type maps and related surfaces, the design process can be simplified and expedited substantially...|$|E
40|$|The lexical {{information}} of verbal lexemes, such as verbs and adjectives, {{plays an important}} role in syntactic parsing, because the structure of a sentence mainly hinges on the type of verbal lexemes. The question we address in this research is how to acquire the ‘argument structure ’ (henceforth ARG-ST) of verbal lexemes in Korean. It is well known that manual build-up of type hierarchy usually cost too much time and resources, so an alternative method, namely automatic collection of relevant information is much more preferred. This paper proposes a procedure to automatically collect ARG-ST of Korean verbal lexemes from a Korean Treebank. Specifically, the system we develop in this paper first extracts lexical {{information of}} ARG-ST of verbal lexemes from a 0. 8 million graphic word Korean Treebank in an unsupervised way, checks the hierarchical relationship among them, and builds up the type hierarchy automatically. The result is written in an HPSG-style annotation, thus making it possible to readily implement the result in an HPSG-based parser for Korean. Finally, the result is evaluated with reference to two Korean dictionaries and also with respect to a manually <b>constructed</b> <b>type</b> hierarchy. ...|$|E

40|$|Farming styles theory, as {{developed}} by Jan Douwe van der Ploeg to explain diversity in agriculture, is being {{considered as a}} possible tool to assist in targeting of extension in Australia. A farming style is a socially <b>constructed</b> <b>type</b> that reflects the worldviews and strategies of one configuration of farming practice for a particular commodity (or common combination of commodities) in a particular region. The various farming styles in a region represent a repertoire of possible worldviews and strategies. We first conducted focus groups to identify farming styles among Australian broadacre croppers. We then conducted case studies to validate these styles, and to gain further understanding of the rationale of each style. The case studies, however, failed to confirm the styles. The findings instead suggested that the styles which emerged from the focus groups were artifacts of the method. We conclude that focus group methodology legitimized the expression of stereotypical images grounded in local farming discourse and provided an avenue for reification of "mythological" styles, although the styles still provided social control over farmers' activities. Researchers {{should be aware that}} focus groups potentially allow the expression of mythology, and should reflect on the validity of data collected by this method...|$|E

MethodsWe <b>constructed</b> <b>type</b> 5 Ad (Ad 5) of which the expression of E 1 A gene was activated by a 5 ′ regulatory sequences of survivin, midkine or cyclooxygenase- 2, which were highly expressed in human tumors. We also produced the same replication-competent Ad of which the fiber-knob region was replaced by that of Ad 35 (AdF 35). The cytotoxicity was examined by a colorimetric assay with human tumor cell lines, 4 kinds of pancreatic, 9 esophageal carcinoma and 5 mesothelioma. Ad infectivity and Ad-mediated gene expression were examined with replication-incompetent Ad 5 and AdF 35 which expressed the green fluorescence protein gene. Expression of cellular receptors for Ad 5 and AdF 35 was also examined with flow cytometry. A transcriptional activity of the regulatory sequences was investigated with a luciferase assay in the tumor cells. We then investigated a possible correlation between Ad-mediated cytotoxicity and the infectivity/gene expression, the transcriptional activity or the p 53 genotype. ResultsWe found that the cytotoxicity was greater with AdF 35 than with Ad 5 vectors, but was not correlated with the Ad infectivity/gene expression irrespective of the fiber-knob region or the E 1 A-activating transcriptional activity. In contrast, replication-competent Ad produced greater cytotoxicity in p 53 mutated than in wild-type esophageal carcinoma cells, suggesting a possible association between the cytotoxicity and the p 53 genotype. ConclusionsSensitivity to Ad-mediated cytotoxic activity was linked with the p 53 genotype but was not lineally correlated with the infectivity/gene expression or the E 1 A expression...|$|E

However, {{the role of}} type 3 fimbriae in K. pneumoniae virulence has not been evaluated by use of in vivo infection models. In this study, the type 3 fimbrial gene cluster (mrk) of the clinical isolate C 3091 is described in detail. The mrk gene cluster was revealed to be localized {{in close proximity to}} the type 1 fimbrial gene cluster. Thus, a 20. 4 -kb fimbria-encoding region was identified and found to be highly conserved among different K. pneumoniae isolates. Interestingly, a homologue to PecS, known as a global regulator of virulence in Erwinia chrysanthemi, was identified in the fimbria-encoding region. Comparison to the previously characterized plasmid encoded mrk gene cluster revealed significant differences, and it is established here that the putative regulatory gene mrkE is {{not a part of the}} chromosomally encoded type 3 fimbrial gene cluster. To evaluate the role of type 3 fimbriae in virulence, a type 3 fimbria mutant and a type 1 and type 3 fimbria double mutant was <b>constructed.</b> <b>Type</b> 3 fimbria expression was found to strongly promote biofilm formation. However, the fimbria mutants were as effective at colonizing the intestine as the wild type, and their virulence was not attenuated in a lung infection model. Also, in a urinary tract infection model, type 3 fimbriae did not influence the virulence, whereas type 1 fimbriae were verified as an essential virulence factor. Thus, type 3 fimbriae were established not to be a virulence factor in uncomplicated K. pneumoniae infections. However, since type 3 fimbriae promote biofilm formation, their role in development of infections in catheterized patients needs to be elucidated...|$|E

[...] Department of Physics and Astronomy. University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2015 The spherical amorphous silica (a-SiO₂) nanoparticles (NPs) are constructed {{from a previous}} continuous random network (CRN) model of a-SiO₂ with the periodic boundary. The models of radii 12 Å, 15 Å, 18 Å, 20 Å, 22 Å, 24 Å and 25 Å are built from the CRN structure. Then, three types of models are <b>constructed.</b> <b>Type</b> I has the surface dangling bonds not pacified. In type II models, the dangling bonds are pacified by hydrogen atoms. In type III models, the dangling bonds are pacified by the OH groups. These large models are used to perform the electronic structure calculation of NPs by using the orthogonalized linear combination of atomic orbital (OLCAO) method. The results show some trends in band gap variation for Type I models. The trends in band gap variation for other two types are less clear. A series of NP models with a spherical pore {{in the middle of}} a solid NP model are constructed and studied. Spherical pores of radii of 6 Å, 8 Å, 10 Å, 12 Å, 14 Å, 16 Å and 18 Å are introduced within the spherical model of radius 20 Å. After OLCAO calculation, it is found that the band gap values remain constant (5 eV) up to 21. 6 % porosity and then decreases with increased in porosity. The relation with thickness of the porous NP shell and the surface to volume ratio (S/V) with the calculated band gap are studied in the same manner and will be discussed.

40|$|District heating {{constitutes}} {{a significant part}} of the total energy use in Sweden, Finland, and Denmark. In a transition to a more sustainable energy system, district heating can play an important role, e. g. through efficiency benefits and possibilities to utilise additional energy sources. In this project a computer-based cost-minimising investment model, describing the development of the production mixes of the national district heating systems in these countries from 2010 to 2050, is constructed using the TIMES model generator. The model is used for a comparative analysis of district heat production in three possible future scenarios, i. e. sets of consistent assumptions about the development in other parts of the energy system, e. g. the electricity supply system. The national district heating system in each country consists of hundreds of physically separate networks, all operating under different conditions. Modelling all these systems individually is, however, practically difficult, due to the time required for modelling and computation. Therefore a type system approach is used, where an entire class of actual systems, with similar production mixes and annual production volumes, is represented by one type system in the model. Based on a review of all networks described in the national district heating production statistics for each country, six type systems are constructed for Sweden and six for Finland, in total describing 85 % of the national annual district heat production in each country respectively. For Denmark, three type systems are constructed, describing 49 % of the national annual district heat production, and the remainder of the national production mix is described by an aggregation of the remaining actual systems. The <b>constructed</b> <b>type</b> systems are then described in the TIMES model. Three scenarios are studied. Two scenarios are designed to represent different pathways to reducing carbon dioxide emissions, one market-based approach with high carbon dioxide emission costs and one focusing on energy efficiency and support for renewable energy sources. The third scenario is a reference development, where current policies are extended into the future. Model results show that the cost-minimal development for the district heating systems in Finland and Denmark may include a transition from coal and natural gas to, primarily, biomass fuelled production facilities. If combined with a decreasing demand for district heat, this can lead to a substantial decrease in the electricity production from combined heat and power plants of up to 50 % in Denmark according to the model results. It can also be seen that a decreasing district heat demand in Sweden may, in the cost-minimal development, lead to difficulties in utilising the heat from waste incineration...|$|E
