40|$|This paper {{examines}} the Law Commission’s proposals {{to use a}} right <b>of</b> <b>reply</b> as a remedy within a new regime to combat harmful digital communications on the Internet in its Ministerial Briefing Paper, Harmful Digital Communications: The Adequacy of Current Sanctions and Remedies. It seeks {{to determine whether a}} right <b>of</b> <b>reply</b> is a suitable tool to use in an online context against ordinary citizens, when it has typically been an offline remedy for use against the media. It also considers the best form for a right <b>of</b> <b>reply</b> under this new regulatory regime, in order for it to constitute a proportional limit on a defendant’s right to freedom of expression. It concludes that a right <b>of</b> <b>reply</b> could be a suitable remedy under the regime, and it could constitute a proportional limit on a defendant’s freedom of expression, but a Court should carefully balance the harms a right <b>of</b> <b>reply</b> might pose against the values of free speech implicated in each circumstance, on a case-by-case basis, in order to ensure the limitations a right <b>of</b> <b>reply</b> might pose on freedom of expression are always proportional and justified...|$|R
50|$|In Europe, {{there have}} been {{proposals}} for a legally enforceable right <b>of</b> <b>reply</b> that applies to all media, including newspapers, magazines, and other print media, along with radio, television, and the internet. In 1974, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe already voted a resolution granting a right <b>of</b> <b>reply</b> to all individuals. Article 1 of a 2004 Council of Europe recommendation defined a right <b>of</b> <b>reply</b> as: offering a possibility to react to any information in the media presenting inaccurate facts &hellip; which affect &hellip; personal rights.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present paper is to {{identify}} the legal position and role of the right <b>of</b> <b>reply</b> within the European concept of media law. We wish to find an answer to the question whether the right <b>of</b> <b>reply</b> constitutes a limitation to the freedom of the press or {{if it is to be}} understood as a means of exercising freedom of opinion (or both, perhaps). We shall also try to identify the common foundations of the regulation of the right <b>of</b> <b>reply</b> and its general, or at least, most common, manifestations in Europe. According to our preliminary hypothesis, the right <b>of</b> <b>reply</b> is a legal instrument serving both the person whose (personality) rights have been violated (the applicant in the legal procedure) and the public wishing to access a wide variety of information via the media. The conclusions of the paper shall confirm or refute this hypothesis...|$|R
5000|$|The name of {{this form}} of {{marketing}} comes from its characteristics <b>of</b> <b>replying</b> to a customer directly instead of to a broader audience. Common concurrences <b>of</b> <b>reply</b> marketing include asking consumers to [...] "call now" [...] or [...] "act fast" [...] {{in order to create}} a sense of urgency that will drive potential sales. In addition to e-mail being the most effective in obtaining direct response, online advertising (such as the [...] "You've won $1000. Click here." [...] ads) has become an increasingly common form <b>of</b> <b>reply</b> marketing due to its interactive nature - if the advertisement captures a consumer's attention, it is clicked, thus introducing the product to the customer.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{consider}} whether press regulation, namely, a statutory right <b>of</b> <b>reply</b> where newspapers fall short of legislated journalistic standards, would be compatible with the implied freedom <b>of</b> political <b>communication</b> embedded in the Constitution. This paper will argue a statutory right <b>of</b> <b>reply</b> could unduly burden the implied freedom. However, the jurisprudence regarding the implied freedom makes any assessment about validity uncertain. It is not clear what standard of review would be used to determine a right <b>of</b> <b>reply’s</b> compatibility with the freedom. Nor has the High Court clearly articulated how it would balance press freedom with other public interests in the event a right <b>of</b> <b>reply</b> was constitutionally challenged. As a result, the current grapple between the media and government over press freedom provides a potential opportunity for the court to better define the values which underpin our implied freedom <b>of</b> political <b>communication,</b> and how much protection the Constitution offers those values...|$|R
