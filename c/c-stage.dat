5000|$|Coldplay {{have been}} using a B-Stage since their 2008/2009 Viva la Vida Tour. Coldplay make use of a B-stage and a <b>C-Stage</b> at {{different}} points in each show. The B-stage, located {{at the end of a}} catwalk, attached to the main stage, was used in the middle of the set to perform a remix of [...] "God Put a Smile Upon Your Face" [...] and [...] "Talk", as well as a piano version of [...] "The Hardest Part". The <b>C-stage</b> was used at the end of the main setlist to perform three songs acoustically, and was located at the back of venue, in the audience. On the following tours, the Mylo Xyloto Tour and the current A Head Full of Dreams Tour , B and C-Stages remain in use, with the B-stage located at the end of the catwalk with a giant screen on the floor.|$|E

40|$|The thermoelastic {{properties}} of several common woven glass/epoxy substrate materials were characterized {{in both the}} warp and fill directions. Five common commercially pressed cores (1080, 2116, 2313, 3313, 7628) were obtained from Polyclad, Inc. The cores consisted of either one or two plies of <b>C-staged</b> woven glass epoxy substrate sandwiched between 1 ounce copper cladding. After the copper {{was removed from the}} cores, samples were cut for either mechanical property characterization or microstructural analysis with the test axis lying along either the warp or fill direction. The crimp angle and relative fiber volume fraction of each fabric was first determined from photomicrographs of polished cross-sections. Next, Young's modulus was measured via standard tension tests at room temperature. The storage and loss moduli were then measured as function of temperature using dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). Finally, the coefficients of thermal expansion were determined using constant force thermal mechanical analysis (TMA) measurements. All of the substrates showed significant differences in microstructure and material properties between the warp and fill directions. Most of the laminates had a much lower crimp angle in the warp direction, which resulted in a higher modulus and lower coefficient of thermal expansion than the fill direction. Of the cores investigated, the {{properties of}} 3313 were the most balance...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveVenous {{diseases}} {{are among the}} most frequent diseases in the general population of industrialized countries. The aim {{of this article is to}} investigate the population-based prevalence of pathologic reflux in superficial and deep leg veins, taking into account factors as gender, age, and clinical classification of venous disease. MethodsIn a population-based cross-sectional study, 3072 subjects aged 18 to 79 years (1350 male, 1722 female, response 59 %) were enrolled from October 2000 through November 2001. A standardized interview was conducted to document phlebological history and clinical examinations including duplex sonography of selected superficial and deep leg veins. Pathological reflux was defined as being > 500 ms. All participants where classified according to the CEAP classification. ResultsUsing the highest clinical stage per participant, 9. 6 % where classified C 0, 59. 0 % C 1, 14. 3 % C 2, 13. 5 % C 3, 2. 9 % C 4, and 0. 7 % C 5 -C 6. A pathological reflux (> 500 ms) was found in 35. 3 % (95 % confidence interval [CI] 33. 6 - 37. 1) of subjects with 21. 0 % (95 % CI 19. 5 - 22. 5) showing reflux in at least one superficial vein and 20. 0 % (95 % CI 18. 6 - 21. 5) showing reflux in at least one deep vein. We observed significantly higher reflux prevalence for the superficial veins in women while for the deep veins reflux prevalence were significantly higher in men. Prevalence of reflux in the superficial veins markedly increases with age. In the deep venous system, no clear changes in reflux prevalence with age can be observed. For superficial veins, reflux prevalence is markedly higher with higher <b>C-stages.</b> For the deep veins, the proportion of refluxes is relatively constant in stages C 0 -C 3 with a distinct increase of prevalence from stage C 4 onward. ConclusionOur results show a high prevalence of reflux both for the superficial and the deep venous system. Reflux prevalence is associated with gender, age, and the clinical stage as measured by the CEAP classification. Further longitudinal studies are needed to clarify the relevance of pathological reflux in subjects with otherwise healthy veins...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundThe {{objective}} of this retrospective {{study was to identify}} prognostic factors in completely resected clinical (c-) stage I non-small cell lung cancer cases. MethodsIn 2001, the Japanese Joint Committee of Lung Cancer Registry collected data on the outcome and clinicopathological profiles of 7408 patients who had undergone resection for primary lung cancer in 1994. They included 3315 <b>c-stage</b> I patients who underwent complete resection, and in this study attempted to identify prognostic factors in the <b>c-stage</b> IA and <b>c-stage</b> IB cases. ResultsThe overall 5 -year survival rate was 66. 5 %: 74. 7 % in the 2085 <b>c-stage</b> IA cases and 52. 5 % in the 1230 <b>c-stage</b> IB cases. The survival curve of the <b>c-stage</b> IA cases was higher than that of the <b>c-stage</b> IB cases. Multivariate analysis of the <b>c-stage</b> IA cases revealed six factors that predicted a significantly better outcome: age, gender, pathological (p-) T status, p-N status, nodal dissection, and tumor diameter (â‰¤ 2 cm), and the same analysis of the <b>c-stage</b> IB cases revealed six factors: age, gender, p-T status, p-N status, operative procedure, and tumor diameter (< 5 cm). The <b>c-stage</b> IA patients whose tumor diameter was 2 cm or less had a higher survival rate than the patients whose tumor diameter was more than 2 cm, and the <b>c-stage</b> IB patients whose tumor diameter was less than 5 cm had a higher survival rate than the patients whose tumor diameter was 5 cm or more.

40|$|Introduction:This {{retrospective}} {{study was designed}} to identify the predictors of long-term survival and the risk factors for complications after surgery in patients aged 80 years or older with clinical (c) -stage I non-small cell lung cancer. Methods:The Japanese Joint Committee of Lung Cancer Registry collated the clinicopathological profiles and outcomes of 13, 344 patients who underwent pulmonary resection for primary lung cancer in 1999. The data of 367 patients aged 80 years or older with <b>c-stage</b> I non-small cell lung cancer were analyzed for prognostic factors and risk factors for postoperative complications. Results:The median age was 82 years (range, 80 - 90 years). Of the total patient number, 102 (27. 8 %) had some form of comorbidity diagnosed preoperatively. Thirty-one (8. 4 %) patients presented with postoperative complications, and the operative mortality was 1. 4 %. The 5 -year survival rates were 55. 7 % for <b>c-stage</b> I patients, 62. 0 % for <b>c-stage</b> IA, and 47. 2 % for <b>c-stage</b> IB. Advanced pathologic stage and comorbidity were significant independent predictors of shortened survival (p < 0. 0001 and p = 0. 032, respectively). Comorbidity and mediastinal lymph node dissection were identified as factors that increased the risk of postoperative complications (p < 0. 0001 and p = 0. 036, respectively). Survival rates were independent of the extent of pulmonary resection (lobectomy or limited resection). Conclusions:Octogenarian patients with <b>c-stage</b> I lung cancer in this study had a satisfactory long-term outcome and low-mortality rate. Comorbidity is a factor associated with both prognosis and operative risks. A selection of the patients who would be curable without mediastinal lymph node dissection after an accurate preoperative staging is beneficial to decrease the postoperative complications because this procedure is a risk factor...|$|E
30|$|A {{modified}} {{method was}} developed to evaluate how much chlorine is consumed by the oxidation reaction during the chlorine bleaching process. This evaluation is, in principle, based on the sum of chloride produced during the chlorination stage (<b>C-stage)</b> and produced during alkali treatment of both the <b>C-stage</b> effluent and the chlorinated pulp. Results obtained by this method proved that about 50 %â€“ 75 % of chlorine was consumed by the oxidation reaction during chlorine bleaching, depending on the reaction condition of chlorination. Even under a reaction condition that is not favorable to an oxidation reaction (low pH), approximately three electrons were abstracted from one lignin structural unit by chlorine bleaching. This result provides additional evidence for our recent observation that lignin is extensively oxidized during chlorine bleaching even when pure chlorine without any chlorine dioxide substitution was used.|$|E
40|$|Objective: The {{clinical}} {{importance of}} preoperative CYFRA 21 - 1 measurement in early-stage {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC) is still unclear. The {{aim of this}} study is to clarify the prognostic value of preoperative CYFRA 21 - 1 levels in clinical stage (<b>c-stage)</b> I NSCLC. Methods: The records of 101 <b>c-stage</b> I NSCLC patients who had undergone complete resection were analyzed to correlate preoperative CYFRA 21 - 1 levels to both the pathologic factors of resected specimens and postoperative outcomes. The cut-off value was set at 3. 5 ng/ml. Results: Six cases (5. 9 %) showed high CYFRA 21 - 1 (â‰¥ 3. 5 ng/ml). The 5 -year survival of normal and high CYFRA 21 - 1 groups was 83. 3 % and 50. 0 %, respectively. Patients with high CYFRA 21 - 1 had significantly poor outcomes (P = 0. 006). In univariate analysis, preoperative serum CYFRA 21 - 1 level, pT, pN, and p-stage were significantly associated with prognosis. Multivariate analysis showed that only CYFRA 21 - 1 level was retained as an independent prognostic factor (relative risk = 9. 79, P = 0. 002). Conclusions: CYFRA 21 - 1 is an independent predictor of poor outcome for <b>c-stage</b> I NSCLC. Elevated preoperative CYFRA 21 - 1 levels in early-stage NSCLC may indicate a subgroup at high risk of early death, which has the potential for better survival with additional systemic chemotherapy...|$|E
40|$|We propose in {{this paper}} a novel {{two-stage}} Projection Correction Modeling (PCM) framework for image reconstruction from (non-uniform) Fourier measurements. PCM consists of a projection stage (P-stage) motivated by the multi-scale Galerkin method and a correction stage (<b>C-stage)</b> with an edge guided regularity fusing together the advantages of total variation (TV) and total fractional variation (TFV). The P-stage allows for continuous modeling of the underlying image of interest. The given measurements are projected onto a space in which the image is well represented. We then enhance the reconstruction result at the <b>C-stage</b> that minimizes an energy functional consisting of a fidelity in the transformed domain and a novel edge guided regularity. We further develop efficient proximal algorithms to solve the corresponding optimization problem. Various numerical results in both 1 D signals and 2 D images have also been presented to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed two-stage method to other classical one-stage methods.

40|$|IntroductionIndications for {{surgical}} resection {{for small}} cell lung cancer (SCLC) {{have been very}} limited. Because early-stage SCLC is a rare presentation of lung cancer, studies comparing surgical resection among {{a large number of}} patients are unlikely to be conducted. This study reports the most recent surgical outcomes {{of a large number of}} SCLC patients who underwent surgery in 2004. Methods: In 2010, the Japanese Joint Committee of Lung Cancer Registry performed a nationwide retrospective registry study regarding the prognosis and clinicopathologic profiles of 11, 663 patients who underwent resection for primary lung cancer in 2004. Of the 11, 663 patients, 243 patients with SCLC (2. 1 %) were included in this study. The registry data of the patients with SCLC were analyzed, and the clinicopathologic profiles and surgical outcomes of the patients were evaluated. Results: The 5 -year survival rate for all cases (n = 243, 213 males, mean age 68. 2 years) was 52. 6 %. The 5 -year survival rates by <b>c-stage</b> and p-stage were as follows: IA, 64. 3 % (n = 132) and 72. 3 % (n = 93); IB, 45. 7 % (n = 36) and 61. 1 % (n = 51); IIA, 50. 5 % (n = 25); and 44. 8 % (n = 27); IIB, 33. 3 % (n = 10) and 40. 3 % (n = 17); IIIA, 30. 5 % (n = 30) and 23. 4 % (n = 45); and IV, 0 % (n = 7) and 0 % (n = 9), respectively. A multivariate analysis showed that the significant prognostic factors were age, gender, <b>c-stage,</b> and surgical curability. A kappa value was moderate conformity between <b>c-stage</b> and p-stage in all cases.

40|$|Objective: To {{predict a}} {{malignant}} grade {{of lung cancer}} by fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scanning, we investigated the correlation between FDG uptake and pathological tumor stage, proliferative activities determined by Ki- 67 and cyclin D 1, and an alteration of p 53, in clinical stage (<b>c-stage)</b> IA lung adenocarcinomas. Methods: FDG-PETwas performed for 71 patients with <b>c-stage</b> IA lung adenocarcinomas. FDG uptake was measured by a contrast ratio (CR) between the tumor and contralateral lung. Ki- 67, cyclin D 1 and p 53 staining scores were examined by immunohistochemistry. Results: The lesions with ground-glass opacity were found in 26 patients, and solid lesions in 45 by computed tomography. The pathological tumor stages (p-stage) were stage IA in 59 andmore advanced stages in 12. The latter had significantly higher CR value than the former (P 0. 55 could be predicted to be at advanced tumor stages, with a sensitivity of 0. 83 andaspecificityof 0. 82. TheCRandstainingscoresofKi- 67 weresignificantly correlatedwith each other (P < 0. 0001), and both the values were significantly higher in advanced tumor stages than in p-stage IA, and were also significantly higher in tumors with intratumoral lymphatic, vascular and pleural involvements than in those without such features (P < 0. 05 â€“ 0. 0001) ...|$|E

The patient was a 66 -year-old female with <b>c-stage</b> IIIA lung adenocarcinoma harboring an EGFR gene mutation; she was surgically treated after receiving gefitinib. The pathological examination revealed adenocarcinoma, and the pathologically therapeutic effect was considered to be slight or of no response. EGFR T 790 M mutation and MET amplification were not present. The pathologically therapeutic effect is generally well correlated with the response rate after induction therapy. In this case, there was a discrepancy between the clinical image and pathological findings. Our findings, therefore, raise questions about the role of surgery after EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment...|$|E
40|$|Background:The role {{of surgery}} in the {{treatment}} of nonâ€“small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with clinically manifested mediastinal node metastasis is controversial even in resectable cases because it is often accompanied by systemic micrometastasis. However, surgery is occasionally indicated for cases with single-station N 2 disease or within multimodal treatment regimens, and in clinical trials. The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate surgical outcomes in a modern cohort of patients with clinical (c-) stage IIIA-N 2 NSCLC whose nodal metastasis was confirmed by pathology (cN 2 /pN 2). Methods:From the central database of lung cancer patients undergoing surgery in 2004, which was founded by the Japanese Joint Committee for Lung Cancer Registration, data of patients having all conditions of NSCLC, <b>c-stage</b> IIIA, cN 2, and pN 2 were extracted, and the clinicopathologic profile of patients and surgical outcomes were evaluated. Results:Among 11, 663 registered NSCLC cases, 436 patients (3. 8 %) (332 men and 104 women) had been extracted. Their mean age was 65 years, and histologic types included adenocarcinoma (n = 246), squamous cell carcinoma (n = 132), and others (n = 58). The proportion of R 0 resection was 82. 5 % and the proportion of the hospital deaths among the cause of death was 2. 3 %. The 5 -year survival rate was 30. 1 % for the selected group of patients. The postoperative prognosis was significantly better than those of corresponding populations extracted from the 1994 (p = 0. 0001) and 1999 databases (p = 0. 0411). Men and women experienced a significantly different survival outcome (p = 0. 025) with 5 -year survivals of 27. 5 % and 37. 8 %, respectively. Single-station N 2 cases occupied 60. 9 % of the cohort and showed a significantly better prognosis than multistation N 2 (p = 0. 0053, 35. 8 % versus 22. 0 % survival rate at 5 years). Conclusions:The surgical outcomes of <b>c-stage</b> IIIA-cN 2 /pN 2 NSCLC patients in 2004 were favorable in comparison with those ever reported...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{address the}} {{necessity}} of incorporating isotopic bone scan in the routine staging work-up of muscle invasive bladder cancer patients, we analyzed the data in our files to determine the incidence of bone me-tastasis in such patients. The rate of subsequent develop-ment of bone metastasis along {{the natural history of}} the disease was also investigated. Patients and Methods: A total of 179 files of consec-utive bladder cancer patients who presented to the National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, between January 2000 and December 2001 were reviewed to check the percentage of positive bone scans on presentation and to check the subsequent development of distant metastases and bone metastasis in these patients â€™ records. Results: Amongst the 179 patients, 26 (14. 5 %) had bone metastasis on presentation, a finding that showed a statistically significant correlation with the increasing depth of muscle invasion; 61. 5 % of the metastatic cases had deep muscle invasion, 19. 2 % had superficial muscle invasion and there was no muscle invasion in 7. 7 % (p= 0. 000). Transitional cell carcinoma was the pathology in 92. 3 % of those patients, while only 7. 7 % had squamous cell carcinoma (p= 0. 036). The cumulative 3 -year incidence of bone-metastasis in the non metastatic patients after treatment mounted to 19. 4 Â± 4. 4 %. The cumulative 3 -year bone metastasis inci-dence in the 153 patients was higher with increasing clinical stage; 8. 4 Â± 8 % for <b>c-stage</b> 2 and 49. 1 Â± 18. 5 % for <b>c-stage</b> 4 (p= 0. 046). As for the p-category of the tumor in the 130 patients who underwent operation, the incidence increased with higher p-stages (p= 0. 006). Though pelvic nodal involvement was not associated with statistically significant increase in the incidence of bone metastases, yet when incorporated as one of the 3 risk factors (grade> 3, pâ‰¥ 4 a and LN positive at surgery) according to which patients were grouped, there was a statistically significant difference in the incidence between patients with no risk factors, only 1 and 2 or more factors (p= 0. 021) ...|$|E
30|$|To avoid overfitting, in Eq. (4) we {{impose a}} lower bound {{on the number}} of samples in each d-state. In addition, we may merge samples of {{adjacent}} c-states to form a big <b>c-stage</b> before dividing one c-state into subsets on the next level, as illustrated in Fig. 2 f. For a small size of samples, we may further reduce the number of free parameters by restraining two hyper-planes in parallel, i.e., reduce one orientation vector a into a scalar a to denote the distance between two parallel hyper-planes. Learning may be simplified into a two-stage implementation as illustrated in Fig. 2 c, d. First, the normal direction of parallel hyper-planes is learned either directly by support vector machine (SVM) (Suykens and Vandewalle 1999; Suykens etÂ al. 2002) as shown in Fig. 2 c or with help of Fisher discriminative analysis (FDA) as shown in Fig. 2 d.

40|$|Preoperative {{chemotherapy}} is {{a promising}} strategy {{in patients with}} early-stage resectable non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC); optimal chemotherapy remains unclear. Clinical (c-) stage IB/II NSCLC patients were randomised to receive either two cycles of docetaxel (D) â€“cisplatin (P) combination chemotherapy (D 60 [*]mg[*]mâˆ’ 2 and P 80 [*]mg[*]mâˆ’ 2 on day 1) every 3 â€“ 4 weeks or three cycles of D monotherapy (70 [*]mg[*]mâˆ’ 2) every 3 weeks. Thoracotomy was performed 4 â€“ 5 weeks (DP) or 3 â€“ 4 weeks (D) after chemotherapy. The primary end point was 1 -year disease-free survival (DFS). From October 2002 to November 2003, 80 patients were randomised. Chemotherapy toxicities were mainly haematologic and well tolerated. There were two early postoperative deaths with DP (one intraoperative bleeding and one empyema). Pathologic complete response was observed in two DP patients. Docetaxelâ€“cisplatin was superior to D in terms of response rate (45 vs 15 %) and complete resection rate (95 vs 87 %). Both DFS and overall survival were better in DP. Disease-free survival at 1, 2 and 4 years were 78, 65 and 57 % with DP, and were 62, 44 and 36 % with D, respectively.

40|$|Measurements of {{metabolic}} fluxes {{in whole}} embryos and isolated plastids have revealed {{major changes in}} the pathways of carbon utilization during cotyledon filling by oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) embryos. In the early cotyledon stage (stage A), embryos used sucrose (Suc) predominantly for starch synthesis. Plastids isolated from these embryos imported glucose- 6 -phosphate (Glc- 6 -P) and partitioned it to starch and fatty acids synthesis and to the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway in the ratio of 2 : 1 : 1 on a hexose basis. Of the substrates tested, Glc- 6 -P gave the highest rates of fatty acid synthesis by the plastids and pyruvate was used weakly. By the mid- to late-cotyledon stage (stage C), oil accumulation by the embryos was rapid, as was their utilization of Suc for oil synthesis in vitro. Plastids from <b>C-stage</b> embryos differed markedly from those of stage-A embryos: (a) pyruvate uptake and utilization for fatty acid synthesis increased by respectively 18 - and 25 -fold; (b) Glc- 6 -P partitioning was predominantly to the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (respective ratios of 1 : 1 : 3); and (c) the rate of plastidial fatty acid synthesis more than doubled. This increased rate of fatty synthesis was dependent upon the increase in pyruvate uptake and was mediated through the induction of a saturable transporter activity...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: The Dukes {{stage is}} used to stratify {{colorectal}} cancer patients into groups of different prognosis and need of adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy. However, approximately 80 % of patients with Dukes stage C colorectal cancer receive cytotoxic therapy without any expected benefit, for such patients would either not relapse without adjuvant therapy or they would inevitably do so because of tumor resistance to the available regimens. On the other hand, as 20 % of Dukes stage B patients would relapse after surgery, adjuvant therapy could improve their survival. Improvement of the Dukes stage predictive accuracy is necessary to better assign patients for adjuvant therapies, especially nowadays when antiangiogenic agents are being incorporated in the clinical practice. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this study, we examined the prognostic role of Dukes staging system in parallel with three vasculature-related variables (vascular invasion, tumor angiogenic activity, and vascular survival ability) {{in a series of}} 130 stage B/C patients with colorectal cancer treated with surgery alone (without adjuvant radiotherapy or chemotherapy). RESULTS: Inclusion of vasculature-related variables in the Dukes staging system significantly improved the prognostic categorization of patients, identifying subgroups of B-stage and <b>C-stage</b> patients with an up to 40 % and 60 % 5 -year survival difference, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary results show that the prognostic value of Dukes staging system is significantly improved after taking into account vasculature-related variables, which may be useful in stratifying patients for adjuvant therapies, highlighting also subgroups that may benefit the most from antiangiogenic agents...|$|E

MethodsEight hundred and seventy-six patients with clinical(c) -stage I NSCLC (adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma), who underwent complete surgical resection between January 2003 and December 2009 were included in this study. We elucidated the lymph node metastatic incidence and distribution according to the primary tumor lobe location and extracted the associated clinicopathological factors, especially thin-section computed tomographic findings, with mediastinal lymph node involvement. ResultsThe total incidence of mediastinal lymph node metastasis was 9. 1 %. There were no cases with hilar and mediastinal lymph node metastasis in ground glass opacity-predominant tumors. There was no significant association of clinical factors with subcarinal lymph node metastasis in right upper-lobe and left upper-division adenocarcinoma. An elevated preoperative serum carcinoembryonic antigen level (p < 0. 001) showed significant associations with upper mediastinal lymph node metastasis in the patients with bilateral lower-lobe primary lung adenocarcinoma. ConclusionsIt would be acceptable to perform selective LND in patients with <b>c-stage</b> I NSCLC with ground glass opacity- predominant tumor.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: A new {{pathological}} classification for pre- and {{minimally invasive}} adenocarcinoma has been established, with distinction prior to surgery crucial {{because of the}} extremely good prognosis. METHODS: Of 412 patients who underwent surgery for lung cancer from 2008 to 2011, 110 classified as <b>c-stage</b> I had {{each of the following}} four parameters assessed for predictive power for PRE or MIN adenocarcinoma and relapse-free survival (RFS) : (i) whole tumour size (WS) shown by computed tomography (CT), (ii) size of the solid (SS) component in CT findings, (iii) maximum standard uptake value in fluoro-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) /CT scan images (SUVmax) and (iv) serum level of carcinoembryonic antigen. RESULTS: For prediction of PRE or MIN adenocarcinoma, the area under the receiver-operating curve was> 0. 7 for all the four parameters, while only SS was found to be an independent factor in multivariate logistic regression analysis. In Cox proportional hazard model analysis, SS and SUVmax were statistically significant, and SS was exclusively independent in multivariate analysis. Differences in RFS between T 1 a and T 1 b were more pronounced when using SS compared with WS. In the sub-classification of T 1 a, we used a breakpoint of 1. 0 cm in SS (T 1 a-Î± and T 1 a-Î²), which resulted in a 2 -year RFS rate of 1. 00 for T 1 a-Î± (n = 21), 0. 89 for T 1 a-Î² (n = 27) and 0. 68 for T 1 b (n = 26) (P = 0. 002 between T 1 a-Î² and T 1 b).

Oncolytic virotherapy using replication-competent vaccinia virus (VACV) strains is a promising new strategy for therapy {{of a variety of}} human cancers. Methods: Oncolytic efficacy of replication-competent vaccinia virus GLV- 1 h 68 was analyzed in both, cell cultures and subcutaneous xenograft tumor models. Results: In this study we demonstrated {{for the first time that}} the replication-competent recombinant VACV GLV- 1 h 68 efficiently infected, replicated in, and subsequently lysed various human colorectal cancer lines (Colo 205, HCT- 15, HCT- 116, HT- 29, and SW- 620) derived from patients at all four stages of disease. Additionally, in tumor xenograft models in athymic nude mice, a single injection of intravenously administered GLV- 1 h 68 significantly inhibited tumor growth of two different human colorectal cell line tumors (Dukeâ€™s type A-stage HCT- 116 and Dukeâ€™s type <b>C-stage</b> SW- 620), significantly improving survival compared to untreated mice. Expression of the viral marker gene ruc-gfp allowed for real-time analysis of the virus infection in cell cultures and in mice. GLV- 1 h 68 treatment was well-tolerated in all animals and viral replication was confined to the tumor. GLV- 1 h 68 treatment elicited a significant up-regulation of murine immune-related antigens like IFN-Î³, IP- 10, MCP- 1, MCP- 3, MCP- 5, RANTES and TNF-Î³ and a greater infiltration of macrophages and NK cells in tumors as compared to untreated controls. Conclusion: The anti-tumor activity observed against colorectal cancer cells in these studies was a result of direct viral oncolysis by GLV- 1 h 68 and inflammation-mediated innate immune responses. The therapeutic effects occurred in tumors regardless of the stage of disease from which the cells were derived. Thus, the recombinant vaccinia virus GLV- 1 h 68 has the potential to treat colorectal cancers independently of the stage of progression...|$|E
40|$|BackgroundThe Japan Lung Cancer Society, the Japanese Association for Chest Surgery, and the Japanese Respiratory Society jointly {{established}} the Japanese Joint Committee for Lung Cancer Registration, which has regularly conducted lung cancer registries for surgical cases in 5 -year periods. We analyzed data obtained in these registries {{to reveal the}} most recent surgical outcomes and trends related to lung cancer surgery in Japan. MethodsUsing data from the registry in 2010 for cases of surgery performed in 2004, demographics, surgical results, and stage-specific prognoses were analyzed. In addition, trends for those parameters over 10 years were assessed. ResultsThe 5 -year survival rate for all cases (n = 11, 663, 7369 males, mean age 66. 7 years) was 69. 6 %. The 5 -year survival rates by <b>c-stage</b> and p-stage were as follow: IA, 82. 0 % (n = 6295) and 86. 8 % (n = 4978); IB, 66. 8 % (n = 2339) and 73. 9 % (n = 2552); IIA, 54. 5 % (n = 819) and 61. 6 % (n = 941); IIB, 46. 4 % (n = 648) and 49. 8 % (n = 848); IIIA, 42. 8 % (n = 1216) and 40. 9 % (n = 1804); IIIB, 40. 3 % (n = 90) and 27. 8 % (n = 106); and IV, 31. 4 % (n = 256) and 27. 9 % (n = 434), respectively. The percentages of female patients, cases with adenocarcinoma, stage I or II disease, and tumors sized less than 2 cm were increased, while those of operative and hospital deaths were decreased. Furthermore, the prognoses of all cases and cases in each stage improved over the decade. ConclusionIn Japanese cases of lung cancer surgery, demographics, surgical results, and stage-specific prognoses changed over the 10 -year study period, while the 5 -year survival rate for surgical cases improved to 69. 6 % in 2004...|$|E
40|$|PurposeThe {{validation}} of tumor, node, metastasis staging system {{in terms of}} prognosis is an indispensable part of establishing a better staging system in lung cancer. MethodsIn 2005, 387 Japanese institutions submitted information regarding the prognosis and clinicopathologic profiles of patients who underwent pulmonary resections for primary lung neoplasms in 1999 to the Japanese Joint Committee of Lung Cancer Registry. The data of 13, 010 patients with only lung carcinoma histology (97. 6 %) were analyzed in terms of prognosis and clinicopathologic characteristics. ResultsThe 5 -year survival rate of the entire group was 61. 4 %. For the small cell histology (n = 390), the 5 -year survival rates according to clinical (c) and pathologic (p) stages were as follows: 58. 8 % (n = 161) and 58. 3 % (n = 127) for IA, 58. 0 % (n = 77) and 60. 2 % (n = 79) for IB, 47. 1 % (n = 17) and 40. 6 % (n = 29) for IIA, 25. 3 % (n = 38) and 41. 1 % (n = 29) for IIB, 29. 0 % (n = 61) and 28. 3 % (n = 60) for IIIA, 36. 3 % (n = 19) and 34. 6 % (n = 40) for IIIB, and 27. 8 % (n = 12) and 30. 8 % for IV (n = 13). For the non-small cell histology (n = 12, 620), the 5 -year survival rates according to <b>c-stage</b> and p-stage were as follows: 77. 3 % (n = 5642) and 83. 9 % (n = 4772) for IA, 59. 8 % (n = 3081) and 66. 3 % (n = 2629) for IB, 54. 1 % (n = 205) and 61. 0 % (n = 361) for IIA, 43. 9 % (n = 1227) and 47. 4 % (n = 1330) for IIB, 38. 3 % (n = 1628) and 32. 8 % (n = 1862) for IIIA, 32. 6 % (n = 526) and 29. 6 % (n = 1108) for IIIB, and 26. 5 % (n = 198) and 23. 1 % (n = 375) for IV. Adenocarcinoma, female gender, and age less than 50 years were significant favorable prognostic factors. ConclusionThis large registry study provides benchmark prognostic statistics for lung cancer. The prognostic difference between stages IB and IIA was small despite different stages. Otherwise, the present tumor, node, metastasis staging system well characterizes the stage-specific prognoses...|$|E
