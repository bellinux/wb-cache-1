50|$|Under ArcelorMittal {{ownership}} production continued, as Arcelor Mittal Ghent. The company produces ~5million tonnes pa of flat steel, with automotive manufacturers being a {{major source}} of custom. Flat steel is produced as hot or electrolytically galvanised, and plastic coated steel. The plant produces steel from ore, and has <b>coking</b> <b>plants,</b> Sinter Plants (blast furnace feedstock production), blast furnaces of total capacity over 4million tonnes pa, and hot and cold rolling facilities.|$|R
25|$|From the 1880s {{the water}} quality {{deteriorated}} rapidly, {{as a result of}} coal mining and its associated communities. The river became unable to sustain life, and by 1974, was the most polluted of the rivers within the River Don catchment. The pollutants came from <b>coking</b> <b>plants,</b> from inefficient sewage treatment plants, and from the manufacture of chemicals. Major investment in upgrading the sewage treatment works took place, and in the treatment of industrial effluent before it was discharged to the river. The closure of the main <b>coking</b> <b>plants</b> has also aided the recovery of the river, and enabled restocking with fish to begin in 1994. By 1996 there was evidence for self-sustaining fish populations, and that the river could support organised angling.|$|R
25|$|The 'Battle of Orgreave' {{took place}} on 18 June 1984 at the Orgreave <b>Coking</b> <b>Plant</b> near Rotherham, which {{striking}} miners were attempting to blockade. The confrontation, between about 5,000 miners and {{the same number of}} police, broke into violence after police on horseback charged with truncheons drawn – 51 pickets and 72 policemen were injured. Other less well known, but bloody, battles between pickets and police took place, for example, in Maltby, South Yorkshire.|$|E
25|$|Water {{quality was}} also {{affected}} by four coking plants, at Orgreave, Brookhouse, Avenue and Coalite. Discharges from them significantly increased the ammonia {{content and the}} biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) of the river. Orgreave was discharging effluent with 146mg/l of ammonia in 1985, which needed to be around 70 per cent lower to improve the river quality to Grade D, but the plant closed in 1991, and water quality has improved dramatically since. Discharges from Avenue <b>coking</b> <b>plant</b> were diverted into a foul sewer in 1986, {{to enable them to}} be treated at Old Whittington treatment works. The plant closed in 1992, but there were problems with phenolic oils leaching from the original storage lagoons into the river for some years after closure. Discharges from the Coalite plant reached the river through its tributary, the River Doe Lea. Again, there were significant improvements to the treatment of effluent in 1984, 1989 and 1996. Brookhouse was the smallest of the four works, but closed in the early 1980s before remedial works were implemented. The coking plants were the worst polluters of the river, and their closure resulted in water quality being significantly improved.|$|E
2500|$|The {{river was}} also {{affected}} by discharges from the Staveley Chemicals and the Coalite Chemicals sites. Staveley Chemicals were producing chlorine and sodium hydroxide by electrolysing brine, {{and the water}} discharged from the site contained significant quantities of mercury and ammonia. Mercury in particular is highly toxic to fish even in small concentrations, and in 1987, the works was discharging around [...] per year into the river. The works, which {{was taken over by}} Rhône-Poulenc Chemicals, was fitted with a mercury recovery plant, and now virtually no mercury is discharged. The Coalite site was manufacturing chemicals from the liquors produced as a by-product of the adjacent <b>coking</b> <b>plant,</b> and was discharging chlorinated compounds into the river. These were treated as part of a scheme to improve the discharges from the <b>coking</b> <b>plant.</b>|$|E
25|$|Ammonium sulfate, an {{important}} nitrogen fertilizer, is most commonly produced as a byproduct from <b>coking</b> <b>plants</b> supplying the {{iron and steel}} making plants. Reacting the ammonia produced in the thermal decomposition of coal with waste sulfuric acid allows the ammonia to be crystallized out as a salt (often brown because of iron contamination) and sold into the agro-chemicals industry.|$|R
50|$|According to the 2001 Ukrainian Census, {{the city}} had 389,589 inhabitants, 178,475 (46%) were men and 211,114 (54%) were women. It is an {{important}} steel industry and coal mining centre of the country. Makiivka is a leading metallurgical and coal-mining centre and has machinery and <b>coking</b> <b>plants.</b> Donetsk and Makiivka are practically merged into a conurbation.|$|R
50|$|In 1977 the Gasometer was repainted, {{at a cost}} of 3.5 million DM. In {{later years}} many <b>coking</b> <b>plants</b> and iron works closed, {{reducing}} supply as well as demand for the gas stored in the Gasometer. In addition, natural gas became cheaper. The Gasometer became superfluous and in 1988 it was decommissioned by its owner, Ruhrkohle AG.|$|R
2500|$|By the 20th century, heavy {{industry}} {{was evident in}} the area with many large, busy collieries operating. [...] Wath Main and Manvers Main were the two usually associated with Wath. [...] After the Second World War the collieries clustered around Manvers were developed into a large colliery complex, coal preparation, coal products and <b>coking</b> <b>plant,</b> which were not only visible, but also detectable by nose from miles around.|$|E

50|$|Production {{diminished in}} the early 1920s, {{dropping}} to less than 30,000 ST of coal a year. By 1926, however the United Mine was reaching its greatest output, producing over 400,000 ST of coal, most of which was being shipped to other <b>coking</b> <b>plants.</b> As {{with most of the}} H.C. Frick mines, coal at United was still extracted largely by hand.|$|R
50|$|In 1903 CF&I was {{the largest}} {{producer}} of coal in the Rocky Mountain west with 23 mines in Las Animas, Huerfano, Fremont, Gunnison, Garfield, and Pitkin County, Colorado producing 53% of the coal mined in Colorado and its 9 <b>coking</b> <b>plants</b> producing 89% of its coke. Steam coal for use in boilers and locomotives was produced in the Huerfano district, coal for home heating in the Canon district, and anthracite at Crested Butte. Demand for coke by the precious metals smelting industry fell off as first silver production was impacted by the panic of 1893 and then gold production fell off {{in the first decade}} of the 20th Century and used refining techniques which did not require large quantities of coke. The large copper smelting companies operating in the area, Phelps Dodge and The American Smelting and Refining Company, invested in their own coal mines and <b>coking</b> <b>plants</b> in Colfax County, New Mexico and Cokedale, Colorado.|$|R
