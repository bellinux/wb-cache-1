There is a timber trestle bridge at 26.98km, {{followed by a}} timber bridge with a <b>concrete</b> <b>pier</b> at 27.55km. At 27.72km is a small steel deck-type bridge using fishbelly plate girders (Bridge 42) supported mid span by a concrete pier; {{this is followed by}} a single span steel bridge at 27.86km and two single span timber bridges at 28.22km and 28.53km.|$|E
25|$|Between Stoney Creek Station and Kuranda {{there are}} another two tunnels, and 22 bridges. After leaving Stoney Creek Station {{there is a}} steel lattice girder bridge (Bridge 29) with wrought iron piers on {{concrete}} bases at 22.92km. This is followed by Stoney Creek Bridge (Bridge 30) at 23.15km, with seven spans of steel lattice girders supported by wrought iron trestles on concrete footings. A <b>concrete</b> <b>pier</b> and two timber trestles support the uphill approach spans. This bridge has a total length of 88.4m, with a curved track.|$|E
25|$|To improve {{capacity}} on {{the line}} between London Bridge and Lewisham, a new stretch of single track has been built alongside the original bi-directional single track between Tanners Hill Junction (near St John's Station) and Lewisham Vale Junction. Before the new track was laid, St John's Vale Road Bridge was partially demolished and reconstructed with a <b>concrete</b> <b>pier,</b> {{as well as a}} new south span over the new track; the existing embankment along the fly-down was also widened. This work was completed in April 2013, and the new track is being used for some services to/from Charing Cross via Lewisham.|$|E

40|$|The seismic {{performance}} of ultra-high-performance concrete–high-strength steel pier was studied using fiber elements, which are capable to model accurately elastic–plastic behavior of members with fibers of different material constitutive relations. For high-strength steel–ultra-high-performance <b>concrete</b> <b>piers,</b> the modified Kent–Park model was utilized {{to describe the}} compressive stress–strain relations of ultra-high-performance concrete and high-strength steel-confined ultra-high-performance concrete, respectively, by determining four key parameters. A finite element model was established to simulate the hysteretic response; conduct parameter analysis including axial load ratio, longitudinal reinforcement ratio, and transverse reinforcement ratio; and assess the maximum ground acceleration capacity based on inelastic response spectra for high-strength steel–ultra-high-performance <b>concrete</b> <b>piers.</b> The conclusions are summarized that modified Kent–Park model is proved to be effective due to experimental data. The calculated hysteretic curves of high-strength steel–ultra-high-performance <b>concrete</b> <b>piers</b> show good agreement with the experimental results. Three parameters have evident effects on seismic {{performance of}} high-strength steel–ultra-high-performance <b>concrete</b> <b>piers,</b> which indicates that various seismic demands {{can be achieved by}} reasonable parameter settings. Compared to nonlinear dynamic analysis based on finite element model, the results provided by inelastic response spectra are less conservative for short high-strength steel–ultra-high-performance <b>concrete</b> <b>piers</b> under high axial load ratio...|$|R
25|$|The Stannard Rock Light keepers {{operated}} the lantern {{and the living}} quarters with flammable illuminants for 60 years; the lighthouse was not electrified until after World War II. It {{was just a few}} years after this that an explosion of gasoline and propane tanks used to fuel the station plant destroyed the buildings on the pier and severely damaged the interior of the tower. The explosion killed one keeper and left three others stranded on the <b>concrete</b> <b>pier</b> {{at the base of the}} tower for three days before a passing ship discovered them and notified the Coast Guard. The men were rescued by the tender Woodrush.|$|E
25|$|Along the {{railroad}} tracks through Scales Mound are five properties, four of them historic in nature. There are two shed/pump houses, both dating from c. 1910–40. One is a gable roof building with a concrete foundation and the other has a flat roof and metal siding. A rectangular feed warehouse dating from c. 1915–20 is also located along the rail corridor. The one story, gable roof feed warehouse stands on a <b>concrete</b> <b>pier</b> foundation. A pyramidal roof garage/warehouse, built c. 1915–25, stands on concrete foundations near the tracks as well. Associated with the garage are bulk oil storage tanks and a pump shed constructed by Trachte Brothers Company of Madison, Wisconsin. The {{only one of the}} five buildings not considered contributing to the district is a c. 1949–50 rail loading platform of pole construction.|$|E
25|$|Travelling west {{along the}} {{southern}} side of the Stoney Creek Gorge, at 20.72km {{there is a second}} steel lattice girder bridge (Bridge 23), with timber trestles on the approaches and two concrete piers, which is followed by two timber trestle bridges (the first also has one <b>concrete</b> <b>pier)</b> prior to Tunnel 10 at 21.06km (straight then curve left, 119m). Tunnel 11 is at 21.30km (curve left, 83m), and is followed by two very small single span steel bridges over concrete drains at 21.58km and 21.60km. Kelly?s Leap follows, where a modern rock fall barrier has been erected near an early open concrete drain. These are followed by timber trestle bridges at 21.76km and 21.92km, and then Tunnel 12 at 22.04km (curve right then straight, 81m).

25|$|As well as tunnels, {{bridgework}} was a {{major element}} of the construction work on the second section. The total length of steel required to complete the bridgework was around 800 feet (244m). The steel work was all cut, fitted and partly riveted by Walkers Ltd of Maryborough. In 2011 the steel bridges between Redlynch and Kuranda included: six with lattice girders; plus Bridge 42 (1890), where fishbelly plate cross- girders have been reused as main span members; Bridge 50 over Mervyn Creek (which replaced an earlier timber bridge in the 1920s); and Jumrum Creek Bridge (Bridge 51), which although mainly timber has a steel central span (the bridge was reconstructed in 1962). There were also five very short steel bridges by 2011. About 1.5km past Kuranda is Crooked Creek Bridge, which in about 1900 reused (shortened) plate girders from the 1867 Bridge 51 on the Main Range. The bridge has been strengthened with new steel piers {{either side of the}} <b>concrete</b> <b>pier,</b> and its replacement steel cross girders also originally came from Bridge 51 on the Main Range.|$|E
25|$|From Redlynch Station, {{the railway}} line heads south past Jungara to Horseshoe Bend, before heading {{north along the}} eastern side of the Lamb Range and turning west into Stoney Creek Gorge. Between Redlynch and Stoney Creek Station there are 13 tunnels and 16 bridges. The first bridge (deck type) is located at a {{distance}} of 12.06km from Cairns. It uses timber girders on timber trestles (some trestle piles and headstocks have already been replaced with steel); this is the form used by the majority of timber bridges on the section, although some use single-span timber girders between concrete abutments. A second timber bridge, with a <b>concrete</b> <b>pier,</b> exists at 13.05km. The site of Jungara Station is passed at 13.82km, with a timber trestle bridge at 14.77km, just before Horseshoe Bend, a 5 chain curve with a large earth embankment. There are two more timber trestle bridges at 15.31km and 16.55km, plus a single span timber girder bridge between concrete abutments at 16.95km, before reaching the first tunnel at 17.12km. Tunnel 1 is concrete lined (as are all the tunnels), straight and 66m long. Tunnel 2, located at 18.42km, is straight with a left curve at the uphill end and 76m long; while Tunnel 3 is at 19.11km (curve left, then straight, 109m).|$|E
500|$|Pleasure Beach Bridge is a riveted Warren through-truss, {{consisting}} of longitudinal members joined only by angled cross-members, forming alternately inverted equilateral triangle-shaped spaces along the length. The bridge {{is supported by}} timber pilings. The swing span is made of two separate Warren through-trusses that pivots on <b>concrete</b> <b>pier.</b> The operator's house {{is located on the}} mainland approach. The bridge spans a length of , by [...] wide, and was rated with an eight-ton limit. Its wooden construction resulted in the timbers creaking and shifting under the weight of passing cars.|$|E
50|$|The bridge {{consists}} of five truss spans supported on two concrete abutments and four common <b>concrete</b> <b>piers.</b> The <b>concrete</b> <b>piers</b> are {{the width of}} the bridge, and have buttress-like quoining at each end, with rendered detailing. The two northeastern piers are located on the northern embankment, with the remaining two piers located within the river. The two concrete embankments have rendered details similar to the piers.|$|R
50|$|The Colorado River Bridge at Bastrop is a 1285 ft-long {{bridge with}} three steel truss spans and <b>concrete</b> <b>piers</b> that crosses the Colorado River {{as part of}} Loop 150 through Bastrop, Texas.

500|$|The {{telescope}} {{is housed in}} an onion-shaped steel dome with an internal diameter of , manufactured by Brittain Steel. The telescope mount is located on a cylindrical <b>concrete</b> <b>pier</b> so that the centre of rotation is [...] above ground level, which lifts the telescope above ground-layer air turbulence for better seeing. A conventional up-down 6m-wide shutter with wind-blind, several large vents with extractor fans for thermal control, and a [...] capacity crane (used for moving the primary mirror e.g. for aluminising) are all incorporated. The {{size and shape of}} the shutter allow observations down to 12° above the horizon, which corresponds to an airmass of 4.8. The total moving mass of the dome is , which is mounted on top of a three-storey cylindrical building. The dome was designed to minimise wind stresses and can support up to its own weight again in ice during inclement weather. The dome and telescope rest on separate sets of foundations (driven [...] down into the volcanic basalt), to prevent vibrations caused by dome rotation or wind stresses on the building affecting the telescope pointing.|$|E
2500|$|U.S. Coast Guard has {{administrative}} {{buildings and}} barracks {{at the base}} of a <b>concrete</b> <b>pier</b> on the harbor.
