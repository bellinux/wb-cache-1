50|$|S. subterranea {{currently}} has no effective chemical controls. Therefore, other cultural management techniques must be used. Using certified clean seeds and planting in fields {{that have been}} historically healthy is the best form of control. These methods may prevent infestation from resting spores. Since infection is promoted by cool soil temperatures and high soil moisture, delayed planting can also help reduce negative effects of the pathogen. Delayed planting reduces the growth period in cooler soils subsequently decreaseing germination of the spores. One limitation to this method is an additional decrease of early market yield. Pre-planting <b>chemigation</b> with metam sodium can reduce the propagules of the pathogen. Other common means of control include using resistant potatoes and crop rotations. Several cultivars of resistant potatoes include Granola, Nicola, Ditta, and Gladiator. Because soil-borne inoculum can survive for many years, crop rotations should involve alternate species that will promote a partial life cycle of the pathogen. This way the zoospores will germinate without producing new spores. Researchers have investigated the use of beta-aminobutyric acid (BABA) in promoting potato resistance. BABA triggers a plants systemic acquired resistance (SAR), a natural plant defense mechanism. When potatoes are inoculated with BABA and then later inoculated with the pathogen, S. subterranean, they exhibit overall reduction in disease. While pathogen reduction has been experimentally supported, further experimentation needs to be performed.|$|E

40|$|Northern highbush {{blueberry}} (Vaccinium corymbosum L.) {{is adapted to}} acidic soil conditions and often grows poorly when soil pH is greater than 5. 5. When soil pH is high, growers will usually mix prilled elemental sulfur (So) into the soil before planting (converted to sulfuric acid by soil bacteria) and, if needed, inject acid into the irrigation water after planting. These practices are effective but often expensive, time consuming, and, {{in the case of}} acid, potentially hazardous. Here, we examined the potential of applying micronized So by <b>chemigation</b> through a drip system as an alternative to reduce soil pH in a new planting of ‘Duke’ blueberry. The planting was located in western Oregon and established on raised beds mulched with sawdust in Oct. 2010. The So product was mixed with water and injected weekly for a period of ≈ 2 months before planting and again for period of ≈ 2 months in late summer of the second year after planting (to assess its value for reducing soil pH once the field was established), at a total rate of 0, 50, 100, and 150 kg·ha− 1 So on both occasions. Each treatment was compared with the conventional practice of incorporating prilled So into the soil before planting (two applications of 750 kg·ha− 1 So each in July and Oct. 2010). Within a month of the first application of So, <b>chemigation</b> reduced soil pH (0 – 10 cm depth) from an average of 6. 6 with no So to 6. 1 with 50 kg·ha− 1 So and 5. 8 with 100 or 150 kg·ha− 1 So. However, the reductions in pH were short term, and by May of the following year (2011), soil pH averaged 6. 7, 6. 5, 6. 2, and 6. 1 with each increasing rate of So <b>chemigation,</b> respectively. Soil pH in the conventional treatment, in comparison, averaged 6. 6 a month after the first application and 6. 3 by the following May. In July 2012, soil pH ranged from an average of 6. 4 with no So to 6. 2 with 150 kg·ha− 1 So and 5. 5 with prilled So. Soil pH declined to as low as 5. 9 following postplanting So <b>chemigation</b> and, at lower depths (10 – 30 cm), was similar between the treatment chemigated with 150 kg·ha− 1 So and the conventional treatment. None of the treatments had any effect on winter pruning weight in year 1 or on yield, berry weight, or total dry weight of the plants in year 2. Concentration of P, K, Ca, Mg, S, and Mn in the leaves, on the other hand, was lower with So <b>chemigation</b> than with prilled So during the first year after planting, whereas concentration of N, P, and S in the leaves were lower with So <b>chemigation</b> during the second year. The findings indicate that So <b>chemigation</b> can be used to quickly reduce soil pH after planting and therefore may be a useful practice to correct high pH problems in established northern {{highbush blueberry}} fields; however, it was less effective and more time consuming than applying prilled So before plantin...|$|E

40|$|For <b>chemigation</b> of nonsoluble pesticides, small oil-pesticides {{droplets}} (dmax tend to wash-off from foliage while large droplets tend to stick. Large droplets (dmax are buoyant, tend {{to rise in}} {{the irrigation}} pipeline and exit {{at the beginning of}} the pipeline; thus, uniformity and efficacy are poor. For this research, a new <b>chemigation</b> system was proposed. The system removes water from the irrigation pipeline, injects the oil-pesticide into the water stream, increases dispersion velocity in successively smaller tubing diameters, and finally injects the dispersion back into the irrigation pipeline. The higher velocity flow with high turbulent shear forces breaks the oil-pesticide into desired size droplets. Droplet break-up research was reviewed, and a model developed to predict maximum droplet size and size distribution. A maximum relative error of 40 % was observed when dmax predicted by the model was compared against literature data. Equations to predict friction factor in helically coiled pipes and effective viscosity of oil-in-water dispersions were evaluated. The friction factor predicted by the Ito equation was in good agreement with the experimental data. Effective viscosity of soybean oil- and kerosene-in-water dispersions was predicted satisfactorily by the Richardson equation with k₄ = 2. 5. Finally, center pivot field experiments were conducted using the new and conventional <b>chemigation</b> systems. For the conventional system, the soybean oil uniformity coefficient along the lateral was 61 %, and oil applied over the last tenth of irrigated area was 9 % of the initial concentration. For the new system, the uniformity coefficient was 73 % and 98 % for dmax of 875 mum and 98 mum, respectively; oil applied over the last tenth of the area was 27 % and 90 % of the initial concentration.

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of fungicides in controlling white mold (Sclerotinia sclerotiorum) of dry beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) was evaluated {{when they were}} applied through irrigation water directly onto the plants or only to the soil. Two field trials were installed in April 1998 and April 1999 in Viçosa, MG. Trials were conducted as a (2 x 3) + 1 factorial: two fungicides x three application modes + one untreated control. The fungicides were benomyl (1. 0 kg a. i. ha- 1) and fluazinam (0. 5 l a. i. ha- 1). The three application modes were: (a) by backpack sprayer (667 l ha- 1), (b) by garden watering-cans simulating sprinkler irrigation with 35, 000 l ha- 1 of water, and (c) by garden watering-cans applying water between the rows and near the soil surface in 35, 000 l ha- 1 of water.

40|$|Sclerotinia sclerotiorum is a necrotrophic fungal {{pathogen}} {{that causes}} white mold of dry bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.). <b>Chemigation</b> with fungicides {{is used for}} disease control, but effectiveness of this application method and impact of irrigation level on residual fungicide activity in the plant over time under field conditions has not been well characterized. To assess the best method of application and fungicide for disease control, we conducted field studies in three field sites in São Paulo State in Brazil. Contact fungicide, fluazinam, was applied via center pivot at three irrigation levels (2. 5, 5. 1, 10. 1 mm) at the Itaí field site in 2013. Fluazinam and procymidone (systemic) were independently applied via sprinkler at three irrigation levels (3. 0, 4. 5, 6. 0 mm) in 2013 and four irrigation levels (2. 5, 5. 0, 7. 5, 10. 0 mm) in 2014 at the Pereiras field site. Fungicides were also applied at the Pereiras site using a backpack sprayer in 2014. Three successive fungicide applications were made at Pereiras in 2013 and two successive applications made at Pereiras in 2014. Three leaves from each treatment of the four replicated plots were collected in 2 -day intervals after application, and fungicide residues assessed using a detached leaf bioassay. Lesion areas were used to estimate percent disease control. Regardless of fungicide or application method, disease control decreased over time (ANCOVA; P 3 ̆c 0. 05). Area under the disease progress curve estimated from leaf lesion areas showed <b>chemigation</b> at the lowest irrigation level provided the best control in five of six trials of fluazinam and {{four out of five}} trials of procymidone. Ground applications were equally effective, showing no difference from <b>chemigation</b> at the lowest irrigation level in most comparisons. The percent reduction in number of S. sclerotiorum sclerotia, disease incidence and dry bean yield were evaluated at Pereiras in both years. Procymidone reduced the number of sclerotia formed. However, yield was only higher for treatments that included procymidone at Pereiras in 2013. Overall, results indicate that both lower irrigation level and ground application slow the loss of residual fungicide activity and reduce the total disease lesion area. Results from this study indicate that procymidone may be better able to reduce S. sclerotiorum sclerotia formation, which may be an important consideration for long-term disease management...|$|E
