40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} {{an approach that}} automatically computes <b>function</b> <b>change</b> information between consecutive revisions along the revision history of C language projects. <b>Function</b> <b>changes</b> are computed at two abstract levels. First, we compute the textual <b>changes</b> between two <b>function</b> revisions. Computed results include function additions and deletions, and the quantity and the ratio of textual <b>change</b> in <b>changed</b> <b>functions</b> across two revisions. Second, we compute the behavioral <b>changes</b> of <b>functions</b> using program slicing techniques. We use an XMLformatted document to represent computed <b>function</b> <b>change</b> information. The <b>function</b> <b>change</b> information, together with the SCM change log, helps maintainers understand code changes between two revisions. The structured format of the <b>function</b> <b>change</b> information also helps create traceability links between the changes and other artifacts. We describe our prototype implementation for computing <b>function</b> <b>changes,</b> and we evaluate our approach through a case study on the Sed project...|$|R

5000|$|Following {{polyploidy}} events, {{there are}} several possible fates for duplicated genes; both copies may be retained as functional genes, change in gene function may occur in one or both copies, gene silencing may mask one or both copies, or complete gene loss may occur. [...] Polyploidy events will result in higher levels of heterozygosity, and, over time, can {{lead to an increase}} in the total number of functional genes in the genome. As time passes after a genome duplication event, many genes will <b>change</b> <b>function</b> as a result of either change in duplicate gene function for both allo- and autopolyploid species, or there will be changes in gene expression caused by genomic rearrangements induced by genome duplication in allopolyploids. When both copies of a gene are retained, and thus the number of copies doubled, there is a chance {{that there will be a}} proportional increase in expression of that gene, resulting in twice as much mRNA transcript being produced. There is also the possibility that transcription of a duplicated gene will be down-regulated, resulting in less than two-fold increase in transcription of that gene, or that the duplication event will yield more than a two-fold increase in transcription. [...] In one species, Glycine dolichocarpa (a close relative of the soybean, Glycine max), it has been observed that following a genome duplication roughly 500,000 years ago, there has been a 1.4 fold increase in transcription, indicating that there has been a proportional decrease in transcription relative to gene copy number following the duplication event.|$|E
40|$|Various {{regression}} test selection techniques {{have been developed}} and shown to improve fault detection effectiveness. The majority of these test selection techniques rely on access to source code for change identification.

This paper describes a process for identifying <b>changed</b> <b>functions</b> when code is not available. This change information is beneficial for selecting white-box regression tests of customer/glue code. This process is applicable when COTS licensing agreements do not preclude decompilation. A feasibility study of the process was conducted with four releases of a medium-scale internal ABB product. The results of the feasibility study indicate that this process can be effective in identifying <b>changed</b> <b>functions...</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{show that}} many of the errors in a context-dependent phone {{recognition}} system are due to poor segmentation. We then suggest a method to incorporate explicit segmentation information directly into the HMM paradigm. The utility of explicit segmentation information is illustrated with experiments involving five types of segmentation information and three methods of smoothing. 1. INTRODUCTION One of the most attractive features of HMMs for speech recognition is that segmentation and classification are solved simultaneously. However, the maximum likelihood training criterion may not lead to a model that best utilizes the acoustic information for segmentation. In this study, we investigate the possibility of improving HMM performance by providing explicit segmentation information. We define a <b>change</b> <b>function</b> as a function that directly measures the spectral variation of the acoustic signal. The <b>change</b> <b>function</b> is integrated into the HMM as the cost of making a transition from one phone to [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Objective: There {{is a need}} to {{identify}} different rehabilitation needs over time among individuals with stroke in order to implement client-centred rehabilitation interventions after stroke. The objective of this research was to describe changes in some aspects of functioning and to explore the patterns of <b>change</b> in <b>functioning</b> in everyday life during the first year after stroke for elderly patients participating in rehabilitation at home. Design and subjects: Patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria for a regular rehabilitation-at-home programme after stroke were considered for participation in this study. Twenty-seven elderly patients participated on four data collection occasions during the year immediately subsequent to a stroke. The mean age of the 27 participants was 78. 8 years (SD = 5. 9) and 67 % of the participants were women. Methods: Data on certain aspects of functioning were collected and a person-oriented approach was used to describe the patterns in the <b>change</b> in <b>functioning</b> for individuals. Results: Four different patterns were identified: (a) moderate <b>change</b> in <b>functioning</b> (n = 4), (b) minor <b>change</b> in <b>functioning</b> (n = 11), (c) minor change despite major life event (n = 7), (d) disrupted <b>change</b> in <b>functioning</b> (n = 5).
