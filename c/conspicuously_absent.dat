5|$|The Crucifixion {{itself is}} <b>conspicuously</b> <b>absent,</b> {{and there is}} no trace or shadow of its {{presence}} in the panels. Writing in 1996, Wieland Schmied noted that the three Furies have replaced Christ and the two thieves crucified on either side of him. The form of the Furies is borrowed directly from Picasso's late 1920s and mid-1930s pictures of biomorphs on beaches, in particular from the Spanish artist's The Bathers (1937). However, the eroticism and comedy of Picasso's figures have been replaced by a sense of menace and terror derived in part from Matthias Grünewald's Mocking of Christ.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. -We {{investigated}} {{fish and}} crayfish use of standardized, constructed microhabitats (bundles) in three northern Mississippi streams. Cypress Creek and the Little Tallahatchie Canal were channelized and incised {{and had little}} woody cover; Puskus Creek was unchannelized and unincised and had abundant woody cover. We constructed three types of bundles (cane, leaf, and string) and deployed replicates of each in winter and spring. Occupancy of bundles by fish and crayfish was high and included 32 fish species representing eight families. Fish abundance did not differ among bundle types or between channel positions (bank or midchannel), but abundance of crayfish showed mixed responses to bundle type and position. Fish and crayfish use of bundles was higher in the channelized streams (89 % occupied) than in the unchannelized stream (49 % occupied). Furthermore, after a winter storm, fish use increased in the channelized streams {{but not in the}} unchannelized stream. Bundles yielded abundance estimates with modest to poor precision (40 - 73 % for fish; 37 - 125 % for crayfish); about 110 - 140 bundles would be necessary to consistently achieve precision of 30 %. Bundles were effective for sampling a subset of fish assemblages (e. g., darters Etheostoma spp. and Percina spp. and madtoms Noturus spp.), but other fish species were <b>conspicuously</b> underrepresented or <b>absent</b> in our samples relative to sampling by electrofishing and seine (e. g., openwater species and large individuals).

40|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} empirical studies of privatization programs, which have found efficiency gains to firms, industries, and financial markets in a multitude of developed and developing economies. Central and Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet Union are <b>conspicuously</b> and consistently <b>absent</b> from these studies. Some reasons for this include the lack of reliable and consistent firm data {{both before and after}} privatization, the absence of vital business mechanisms and institutions to distribute reliable business information, and misconceptions about what privatization actually is. Given these problems, Stiglitz (1998) offers an interesting solution for measuring the "success" privatization in CEE and FSU. Stiglitz (1998) provides six factors to be considered when assessing the impact of any type of economic reform: economic growth, health, education, infrastructure, knowledge, and capacity-building. Through correlation analysis, financial, economic and social variables representing these six dimensions are reduced to fourteen key variables that describe privatization / economic reform success. A series of mean analyses are performed, taking into consideration privatization program characteristics and control variables to account for other economic reforms that have occurred simultaneously with privatization. General findings suggest that overall there is positive economic, financial, and social growth after privatization. However, it is difficult to discern the effects of privatization, from the effects of other economic reforms. In addition, countries that have manager/employee privatization do not have sale privatization as part of their programs experience negative growth in market capitalization, value of stocks traded, and official development assistance...|$|R
40|$|Gossypium barbadense L. is {{a commercially}} {{important}} cotton species of tropical South American origin presently grownin many {{regions of the}} world. The species is morphologically diverse, consisting {{of a wide range}} of wild (or feral), commensal, landrace, and highly improvedcommercial forms. We performed allozyme analysis on 153 accessions representing the spectrum of G. barbadense diversityto ascertain the geographic origin of the species, its patterns of diffusion subsequent to domestication, and to reveal infraspecific relationships. Levels ofgenetic variation in G. barbadense are moderate. Of 59 loci scored, 24 were polymorphic, with a mean number of alleles perlocus of 1. 69 and an average panmictic heterozygosity of 0. 062. Principal component analysis revealed geographic clustering of accessions into six relativelydiscrete regions. Gene frequencies at many loci are significantly heterogeneous among these regions, with an average G STof 0. 272. Northwestern South America contains the greatest genetic variability; we suggest that this region is the ancestral home of the species. The data indicate separate diffusion pathways from this region into Argentina-Paraguay and into eastern and northern South America east of the Andes. Caribbean Island and Central American forms appear to be derived from the latter. These diffusion pathways are in accordance with morphological evidence and historical record. In contrast to expectations based on geographic proximity, Pacific Island forms have their closest affinity to accessions from eastern South America. Advanced cultivated stocks seem largely derived from western Andean material, but also contain introgressed G. hirsutum germ plasm. Introgression was relatively high (22 %- 50 % of accessions) in commercial stocks and in forms from Argentina-Paraguay and various Pacific Islands, but was <b>conspicuously</b> low or <b>absent</b> in material from Central America and the Caribbean, where commensal and commercial forms of both species are sympatric...|$|R
5|$|Suffolk's {{connection}} with John of Gaunt was strong, a family connection that {{went back to}} the times of Suffolk's father. Suffolk's second wife Isabel had a daughter from a previous marriage, who was in Gaunt's wardship. This daughter, Elizabeth, who was an heiress of Lord Strange, was probably transferred to Isabel's household at her marriage to Suffolk. The two lords also maintained some of the same men as servants, or retainers. At the Good Parliament in 1376, Suffolk was elected to a committee that would discuss the parliament's grievances concerning the failed fiscal and military policies of Gaunt, who was the de facto ruler of England.

40|$|A large palaeochannel on {{the northeastern}} Australian {{continental}} shelf has been imaged {{by a series}} of shallow seismic reflection profiles. The buried channel forms an important Pleistocene route of the Burdekin River and extends almost continuously for not, vert, similar 160 km from the present coast to the outermost reef. The channel floor profile steps across the shelf with alternating segments of gentle gradient (flats) and steeper gradient (ramps). Channel sinuosity as interpreted from seismic records varies among segments between 1 and 1. 72, with no consistent relationship between sinuosity and gradient. The lower and upper parts of the channel fill have different geometry and reflection character, suggesting channel excavation and initial filling occurred during a different regime than final filling. In one section of the shelf, about the − 50 m isobath, the channel is difficult to define and appears to have wandered significantly, either because it has been modified by shoreface erosion ca. 10. 5 ka or because the river encountered a change in topography in front of karstified reefs. As the channel passes between the numerous outer shelf reefs, in water depths of 70 – 80 m, it becomes progressively smaller, <b>conspicuously</b> underfilled, and <b>absent</b> entirely over the outermost 10 km of the shelf. No discrete lowstand river mouth could be recognised on the present shelf edge. The elevations of flat segments on the channel floor profile show considerable similarity to published elevations of stillstands or brief rises in sea level attained during the long-term drawdown associated with the last glacial cycle (125 – 20 ka) and are interpreted to have formed during this stepwise drop in sea level. Channels were cut and partially filled during the fall and lowstand and then backfilled during the Holocene transgression. The ancestral channel of the Burdekin River therefore preserves a rare insight into the stratigraphic record of falling sea level during the last glacial. ...|$|R
40|$|In April of 2010, the Massachusetts Regionalization Advisory Commission {{issued its}} {{findings}} advocating for inter-local partnerships in eleven specific areas. The {{study found that}} “as the costs of government services rise faster than available revenues and cities and towns struggle to provide essential services, regionalization and collaboration become more palatable to municipalities wishing to deliver essential local services more economically and efficiently” (Massachusetts Regionalization Advisory Commission, 2010, p. 43). This research seeks to assess in what ways, to what extent and for what reason could and should a municipal performance measurement and management model, like the ‘Stat’ model, be adopted and amended to measure and improve the performance of inter-municipal partnerships? Adopted in Springfield, Lowell and Somerville Massachusetts, the ‘Stat’ model {{is the process of}} holding “an ongoing series of regular, frequent, periodic, integrated meetings during which the chief executive and/or the members of the chief executive’s leadership team plus the individual director (the top managers) of different sub-units, use data to analyze the unit’s past performance, to follow-up on previous decisions and commitments to improve performance objectives, and to examine the effectiveness of its overall performance strategies” (Behn, Robert. 2008, p. 2). In order to assess if a PMM can and should play a role in inter-municipal partnerships, this research first focuses {{on the extent to which}} inter-municipal partnerships have successfully been established in the Commonwealth. Three categories of inter-municipal partnerships were identified: 1) those with thorough integration; 2) those with moderate integration; and 3) those with moderate to low integration. A total of 5 cases of inter-municipal partnerships in the Commonwealth are examined and assessed for their compatibility and aptitude for continued or greater success with a PMM. Finally, a critical analysis and discussion of the findings yields a final recommendation of one of the considered alternatives. The results showed that it is not, in fact, possible in most cases to adopted a performance measurement and management model designed for a single municipality to meet the needs of an inter-municipal partnership. Their needs and capacity are simply too different. Only in the cases where an inter-municipal partnership is working on a large-scale, long-term project and is working as a united front with a shared vision of success, can a PMM like ‘Stat’ be effective in an inter-municipal environment because it is centralized enough. That said, in the vast majority of inter-municipal partnership cases where ‘Stat’ doesn’t work, performance evaluation is still <b>conspicuously</b> and unnecessarily <b>absent.</b> Therefore a coordinated effort to establish inter-municipal partnerships with ad-hoc PMMs, that are customized to fit the varying needs of counties, regions and partnerships across the Commonwealth, should be considered...|$|R

500|$|As Kepler slowly {{continued}} analyzing Tycho's Mars observations—now {{available to}} him in their entirety—and began the slow process of tabulating the Rudolphine Tables, Kepler also picked up {{the investigation of the}} laws of optics from his lunar essay of 1600. Both lunar and solar eclipses presented unexplained phenomena, such as unexpected shadow sizes, the red color of a total lunar eclipse, and the reportedly unusual light surrounding a total solar eclipse. Related issues of atmospheric refraction applied to all astronomical observations. Through most of 1603, Kepler paused his other work to focus on optical theory; the resulting manuscript, presented to the emperor on January 1, 1604, was published as Astronomiae Pars Optica (The Optical Part of Astronomy). In it, Kepler described the inverse-square law governing the intensity of light, reflection by flat and curved mirrors, and principles of pinhole cameras, as well as the astronomical implications of optics such as parallax and the apparent sizes of heavenly bodies. He also extended his study of optics to the human eye, and is generally considered by neuroscientists {{to be the first to}} recognize that images are projected inverted and reversed by the eye's lens onto the retina. The solution to this dilemma was not of particular importance to Kepler as he did not see it as pertaining to optics, although he did suggest that the image was later corrected [...] "in the hollows of the brain" [...] due to the [...] "activity of the Soul." [...] Today, Astronomiae Pars Optica is generally recognized as the foundation of modern optics (though the law of refraction is <b>conspicuously</b> <b>absent).</b> With respect to the beginnings of projective geometry, Kepler introduced the idea of continuous change of a mathematical entity in this work. He argued that if a focus of a conic section were allowed to move along the line joining the foci, the geometric form would morph or degenerate, one into another. In this way, an ellipse becomes a parabola when a focus moves toward infinity, and when two foci of an ellipse merge into one another, a circle is formed. As the foci of a hyperbola merge into one another, the hyperbola becomes a pair of straight lines. He also assumed that if a straight line is extended to infinity it will meet itself at a single point at infinity, thus having the properties of a large circle.|$|E

His name was <b>conspicuously</b> <b>absent</b> among the list of donors as published in the Morning Post. But Kipling did admire Dyer.|$|E
