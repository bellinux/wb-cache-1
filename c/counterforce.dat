5|$|One of the {{original}} deployment plans for Zeus had been a defensive system for SAC. The Air Force argued against such a system, in favor of building more ICBMs of their own. Their logic was that every Soviet missile launched in a <b>counterforce</b> strike could destroy a single US missile. If both forces had similar numbers of missiles, such an attack would leave both forces with few remaining missiles to launch a counterstrike. Adding Zeus would {{reduce the number of}} losses on the US side, helping ensure a counterstrike force would survive. However, the same was true if the US built more ICBMs instead. The Air Force was far more interested in building its own missiles than the Army's, {{especially in the case of}} Zeus, which appeared to be easily outwitted.|$|E
5|$|The {{arguments}} {{that led to}} the cancellation of the B-70 program had led some to question the need for a new strategic bomber of any sort. The USAF was adamant about retaining bombers as part of the nuclear triad concept that included bombers, ICBMs, and submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) in a combined package that complicated any potential defense. They argued that the bomber was needed to attack hardened military targets and to provide a safe <b>counterforce</b> option because the bombers could be quickly launched into safe loitering areas where they could not be attacked. However, the introduction of the SLBM made moot the mobility and survivability argument, and a newer generation of ICBMs, such as the Minuteman III, had the accuracy and speed needed to attack point targets. During this time, ICBMs were seen as a less costly option based on their lower unit cost, but development costs were much higher. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara preferred ICBMs over bombers for the Air Force portion of the deterrent force and felt a new expensive bomber was not needed. McNamara limited the AMSA program to studies and component development beginning in 1964.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Forming complex {{asymmetric}} parts lead to high horizontal process forces {{applied to}} the ram of a forming machine. These forces entail horizontal ram displacement and influence {{the quality of the}} finished parts negatively. By application of horizontal <b>counterforces</b> to the ram, the displacement could be avoided and the process stability could be improved. This paper presents a design of an electromagnetic system, which is capable to apply such high horizontal <b>counterforces.</b> To obtain high <b>counterforces</b> and a high dynamic simultaneously, the techniques premagnetisation and overexcitation have been tested numerically. Both mentioned techniques improve dynamic of electromagnetic systems by a large extent as illustrated in the paper...|$|R

25|$|When McNamara {{took over}} the Pentagon in 1961, the United States {{military}} relied on an all-out nuclear strike {{to respond to a}} Soviet attack of any kind. This kind of strike would lead to the death of Soviet military forces and also civilians. This was the same nuclear strategy planned by the Strategic Air Command (SAC), led by General Curtis LeMay. McNamara did not agree with this kind of action. He sought for other options after seeing how this strategy could not guarantee the destruction of all Soviet nuclear weapons leaving the United States vulnerable to retaliation. McNamara’s alternative in the doctrine of <b>counterforce</b> was to try to limit the United States nuclear exchange by targeting only enemy military forces. This concept would be used to prevent retaliation and escalation by holding Soviet cities hostage to a follow up strike. McNamara later concluded that <b>counterforce</b> was not likely to control escalation but likely to provoke retaliation. The U.S. nuclear policy remained the same.|$|E

At this time there was little threat of <b>counterforce</b> strikes, as few systems had the accuracy to destroy missile systems.

This meant a small number of ABMs would be effective against a huge number of Soviet warheads.|$|E

25|$|TRW {{suggested}} building three bases with thirty missiles each, {{and estimated}} {{that one of}} the three bases would survive an all-out <b>counterforce</b> attack. To ensure that 600 warheads would survive, each missile would have to carry about 20 warheads. These studies led to the Missile, Experimental, or MX, project, which started in 1971. The design rapidly firmed up, emerging with ten-warheads on more missiles in order to raise the survivors to 1,000 warheads. But the basing became not so much a specific concept as a catch-all program for every possible concept, from railway deployments, to underground racetracks, to mobile systems.

Even a high unit price, LoADS would still be less expensive than building double the number of shelters. Additionally, as each set of MPS shelters, or cells, would have only a single LoADS, the problems with nuclear blackout causing problems for follow-up shots was not an issue, a problem that had never been solved in Safeguard-like solutions.|$|E

Bankruptcy costs, incentive problems {{on the part of the}} raider, and defensive leverage changes and asset sales by the target management are all <b>counterforces</b> to high bidder leverage, thereby shifting gains to target shareholders and causing takeovers to fail. While bankruptcy costs are a social cost, the takeover premium is merely a wealth transfer between the raider and target shareholders.

25|$|Work on MX also continued, and by {{the mid-1970s}} the {{preferred}} MX basing mode was the Multiple Protective Shelter (MPS) concept. In this system each MX missile would be installed in a network of hardened shelters, 23 in most plans, and moved between them at random. The transports would be camouflaged and duplicated so the Soviets would not know where the missiles were. A <b>counterforce</b> attack would thus require the Soviets to expend 23 warheads for every MX missile to ensure destruction. With a total of 4,500 shelters and 200 missiles moving between them, the system could soak up {{a significant portion of}} the Soviet's 5,928 ICBM warheads and survive. In this basing mode, a system like Safeguard was of little use. If the Soviets needed to fire 4,500 warheads to ensure the destruction of the MX force, expending another 100 to soak up an ABM system was of little consequence.|$|E
25|$|This {{led to a}} {{worrying}} scenario {{coming to}} dominate US strategic thinking through the 1970s and 80s. If the Soviets launched a sneak attack on the US using {{only a portion of}} their missile fleet, about , aimed solely at US silos and airbases, they could hope to destroy as much as 90% of the US's fleet. This attack would not kill many civilians, and leave the US with only a few ICBMs and bombers, along with the US Navy's Submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) fleet. However, the SLBMs of that era were not accurate enough to attack missile silos, the US {{would not be able to}} respond with a <b>counterforce</b> attack against the substantial numbers of remaining Soviet ICBMs. The only option left would be a general attack on Soviet cities, which would cause the Soviets to respond in kind with their remaining fleet.

25|$|In contrast, in Germany, the {{relation}} between individual employees and employers {{is considered to be}} asymmetrical.

This allows much wider legal boundaries for collective bargaining, compared to the narrow boundaries for individual negotiations. As a condition to obtain the legal status of a trade union, employee associations need to prove that their leverage is strong enough to serve as a <b>counterforce</b> in negotiations with employers. If such an employees association is competing against another union, its leverage may be questioned by unions and then evaluated in a court trial. In Germany, only very few professional associations obtained the right to negotiate salaries and working conditions for their members, notably the medical doctors association Marburger Bund and the pilots association Vereinigung Cockpit. The engineers association Verein Deutscher Ingenieure does not strive to act as a union, as it also represents the interests of engineering businesses.|$|E

When we discuss therefore the issue of Western versus universal structures these are always related to value systems. And we have to concede that 'universal' is an ideal, which will never be reached. Today's increasingly globalized world is dominated by the capitalist mode of production since more than 200 years, and it dominates all sciences as well. Globalisation is driven by capitalism and imperialism. Technology (namely military) allowed Western Europe to dominate nearly the whole world since, although {{other parts of the world}} were already more developed in many domains.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Angiogenesis is the {{formation}} of new capillary blood vessels from preexisting vessels. It is involved in many normal and diseased conditions, {{as well as in}} the application of tissue-engineered products. Th ere has been extensive eff ort made to develop strategies for controlling pathological angiogenesis and for promoting vascularization in biomedical engineering applications. Central to advancing these strategies is a mechanistic understanding of the angiogenic process. Angiogenesis is tightly regulated by local tissue environmental factors, including soluble molecules, extracellular matrices, cell–cell interactions, and diverse mechanical forces. Great advances have been made in identifying the biochemical factors and intracellular signaling pathways that mediate the control of angiogenesis. Th is review focuses on work that explores the biophysical aspect of angiogenesis regulation. Specifi cally, we discuss the role of cell-generated forces, <b>counterforces</b> from the extracellular matrix, and mechanical forces associated with blood fl ow and extravascular tissue activity in the regulation of angiogenesis. Because angiogenesis occurs in a mechanically dynamic environment, future investigations should aim at understanding how cells integrate chemical and mechanical signals so that a rational approach to controlling angiogenesis will become possible. In this regard, computational models that incorporate multiple epigenetic factors to predict capil-lary patterning will be useful.

40|$|Abstract. To {{improve the}} {{efficiency}} of printing or coating processes for paper products the velocity of the web and the roller width can be increased. However, these measures cause deformations of the rollers, heating effects and streak print defects due to undesirable oscillations. The vibration characteristic is significant for the quality and efficiency of the printing or coating processes. Approved methods like balancing of the rollers and maximizing the bending stiffness have come to technical limits. This paper describes a new promising technology for further optimization of printing and coating machines. Piezoelectric actuators are integrated in the bearings of a roller of a flexographic printing machine and generate <b>counterforces</b> to compensate undesired bending vibrations. Strain gauges applied on the roller measure the vibrations. A simulation model of the mechatronic overall-system has been developed to design the control strategy. The oscillations of roller systems in printing machines and other industrial applications are mainly stimulated by disturbances that occur periodically with each rotation. A feedback control strategy combined with a feed forward compensation of predictable disturbances has shown promising results in simulation and experiments. Due {{to the fact that}} the excitations of the oscillations are periodically with the rotation of rollers, another approach for vibration reduction has been developed. The forces for vibration reduction are not generated by an active mechatronic system but by passive profile rings...|$|R

40|$|Rat {{kangaroo}} kidney epithelium (PtK 2) cells develop prominent asters and spindles during anaphase B of mitosis. It {{has been}} shown that severing the spindle at early anaphase B in living PtKi cells results in a dramatic increase in the rate of pole-pole separation. This result suggested that the asters pull on the spindle poles, putting tension on the spindle, while the spindle acts as a governor, limiting the rate of pole separation. To further test these inferences, we used a UV-laser microbeam to damage one of the two asters in living PtK 2 cells at early anaphase B and monitored the effects on individual spindle pole movements, pole-pole separation rates and astral microtubules (MTs). Irradiation at the estimated position of a centrosome greatly reduced its array of astral MTs and nearly stopped the movement of the irradiated pole, whereas the sister pole retained its normal array of astral MTs and actually accelerated. Control irradiations, either close to the estimated position of the centrosome or beside the spindle at the equator, had little or no effect on either spindle pole movements or astral MTs. These results support the inferences that during anaphase B in living PtK cells, the central spindle is under tension generated by pulling forces in the asters (presumably MT-mediated) and that the spindle generates <b>counterforces</b> that limit the rate of pole separation. The results also suggest that the central spindle in living PtK cells may be able to generate a pushing force...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Models and {{simulations}} {{are finding}} increased roles in medical education. The Virtual Haptic Back (VHB) {{is a virtual}} reality simulation of the mechanical properties of the human back designed {{as an aid to}} teaching clinical palpatory diagnosis. Methods Eighty-nine first year medical students of the Ohio University College of Osteopathic Medicine carried out six, 15 -minute practice sessions with the VHB, plus tests before and after the sessions in order to monitor progress in identifying regions of simulated abnormal tissue compliance. Students palpated with two digits, fingers or thumbs, by placing them in gimbaled thimbles at the ends of PHANToM 3. 0 ® haptic interface arms. The interface simulated the contours and compliance of the back surface by the action of electric motors. The motors limited the compression of the virtual tissues induced by the palpating fingers, by generating <b>counterforces.</b> Users could see the position of their fingers with respect to the back on a video monitor just behind the plane of the haptic back. The abnormal region varied randomly among 12 locations between trials. During the practice sessions student users received immediate feedback following each trial, indicating either a correct choice or the actual location of the abnormality if an incorrect choice had been made. This allowed the user to feel the actual abnormality before going on to the next trial. Changes in accuracy, speed and Weber fraction across practice sessions were analyzed using a repeated measures analysis of variance. Results Students improved in accuracy and speed of diagnosis with practice. The smallest difference in simulated tissue compliance users were able to detect improved from 28 % (SD = 9. 5 %) to 14 % (SD = 4. 4 %) during the practice sessions while average detection time decreased from 39 (SD = 19. 8) to 17 (SD = 11. 7) seconds. When asked in anonymous evaluation questionnaires if they judged the VHB practice to be helpful to them in the clinical palpation and manual medicine laboratory, 41 % said yes, 51 % said maybe, and 8 % said no. Conclusion The VHB has potential value as a teaching aid for students in the initial phases of learning palpatory diagnosis. </p...|$|R
