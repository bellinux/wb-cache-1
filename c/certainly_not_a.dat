5|$|The {{production}} of whiskey was <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> norm {{in the colonies}} in the early years. The upper echelon of colonial society looked down upon American whiskey up until {{the time of the}} American Revolution. Some even saw the harsh spirit as a bastion of debauchery in the American colonies. Whatever the sentiment, the Scottish, Irish, and Germans brought a taste for hard spirits from their homelands to the American colonies in the 1730s. These groups continued to produce hard spirits in imported stills, or stills based on Old World designs, in retaliation against the English economic controls.|$|E
5|$|France and Austria {{signed a}} truce on 4 December and the Treaty of Pressburg 22 days later took the latter {{out of the}} war. Austria agreed to {{recognize}} French territory captured by the treaties of Campo Formio (1797) and Lunéville (1801), cede land to Bavaria, Wurttemberg, and Baden, which were Napoleon's German allies, and pay 40 million francs in war indemnities, and Venice {{was given to the}} Kingdom of Italy. It was a harsh end for Austria, but <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> catastrophic peace. The Russian army was allowed to withdraw to home territory and the French ensconced themselves in Southern Germany. The Holy Roman Empire was effectively wiped out, 1806 being seen as its final year. Napoleon created the Confederation of the Rhine, a string of German states meant to serve as a buffer between France and Prussia. Prussia saw these and other moves as an affront to its status as the main power of Central Europe and it went to war with France in 1806.|$|E
5|$|In the east, however, Manuel's {{achievements}} {{are more}} ambiguous. He suffered a major defeat at the Battle of Myriokephalon in 1176 against the Turks. Manuel was marching against Konya, the Turkish capital, when his forces were ambushed; the ensuing defeat has since entered {{the popular imagination}} as a legendary disaster. Exaggerated accounts of the battle often describe {{the destruction of the}} entire Byzantine army, and with it the end of Byzantine power and influence. However, the modern consensus among Byzantine historians is that, while the Battle of Myriokephalon was a serious humiliation for the emperor, it was <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> catastrophe. Nor was it in any way equivalent to the Battle of Manzikert over a century earlier. In fact, much of the emperor's army emerged from the battle without serious damage. Units involved in the battle are well documented as campaigning in Asia Minor the following year. The imperial frontier remained unmoved for the remainder of Manuel's reign, a clear indication that the Turks were unable to gain any advantage from their victory. In 1177, the Byzantines inflicted a major defeat on a large Turkish force at Hyelion and Leimocheir in the Meander valley.|$|E

25|$|This much we know: William (Gen. 2) Carpenter's {{admission}} as a Massachusetts Bay Colony freeman from Weymouth in 1640 required church membership. The {{minister at}} Weymouth was Rev. Samuel Newman, most of whose congregation accompanied him to Rehoboth, {{where he was}} also the minister. William (Gen. 2) Carpenter was one of Rehoboth's fifty-eight original proprietors and is buried in Old Rehoboth (Newman Church) Cemetery. (While records of the time provide no direct evidence as to the religious affiliation of William (Gen. 2) Carpenter of Rehoboth, he was <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> Baptist, even though other Carpenters in New England were. In this regard, he is sometimes confused with William Carpenter (Rhode Island) of Providence and others.|$|E

Marco Mostert considers it possible, even likely, that Radbod's recension of the vita made its way to Fulda, where the legend became attached to the damaged books that could have been Boniface's, and that by the tenth century the status of these books had been elevated to that of contact relics.|$|E

25|$|Psychoanalysts {{diagnose}} uncertainty as {{the dominant}} attitude {{to life in the}} postmodern society. This uncertainty can be caused by the pressure which is executed from the society to the humans. It is the uncertainty to fail, but also the fear of their own limits, not to achieve something what the society expects, and especially the desire for recognition in all areas of life. In today's society we are in a permanent competition. Appearance, occupation, education of the children - everything is compared to a media staged ideal. Everything should be perfect, because this deep-rooted aversion to all average, the pathological pursuit to excellence - these are old traditions. Who ever wants more - on the job, from the partner, from the children, from themselves - will one day be burned out and empty inside. He is then faced with the realization that perfection does not exist. Who is nowadays empty inside and burned out, is in the common language a Burnout. But due to the definitional problems Burnout is till this date not a recognized illness. An attempt to define this concept more closely, can be: a condition that gets only the passionate, that is <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> mental illness but only a grave exhaustion (but can lead to numerous sick days). It can benefit the term that it is a disease model which is socially acceptable and also, to some extent, the individual self-esteem stabilizing. This finding in turn facilitates many undetected depressed people, the way to a qualified treatment. According to experts in the field, in addition to the ultra hard-working and the idealists mainly the perfectionist, the loner, the grim and the thin-skinned are especially endangered of a burnout. All together they usually have a lack of a healthy distance to work.|$|E

500|$|The Referendum Party {{nevertheless}} {{may have}} cost the Conservatives certain seats. Many Conservatives themselves {{believed that this}} was the case. As noted by Anthony Heath, Roger Jowell, Bridget Taylor, and Katarina Thomson from their analysis of polling data, [...] "voters for the Referendum Party were <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> cross-section of the electorate. They were predominantly people who had voted Conservative (and, to a lesser extent, Liberal Democrat) in 1992. Hardly anyone who had voted Labour in 1992 supported Goldsmith's party." [...] Their evidence indicated that just under two-thirds of those who voted for the Referendum Party in 1997 had voted for the Conservatives in 1992, although the analysis also suggested that many of these people were dissatisfied with the Conservative government and would not have voted for them even had the Referendum Party not existed. Heath et al. noted that [...] "voters for the Referendum Party were remarkably Eurosceptic but were unremarkable in most other respects. They show no sign of being right-wing on the economic issues of the left-right dimension and they were not consistently right-wing ideologues." [...] Those who voted for the party held a diversity of ideological positions, the only shared factor being their Euroscepticism.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{publication}} of the parliamentary report the church reacted by seeking help from academics and sociologists specializing in religious issues, including Jean Baubérot, Jean Séguy, Jean-Paul Willaime, Massimo Introvigne, Laurent Amiotte-Suchet, Bernard Blandre and Émile Poulat, who generally criticized its cult classification. Willaime and Poulat, among other sociologists, deemed the church's danger was never proven. Danièle Hervieu-Léger said the classification as a cult was an [...] "absurd decision". Sébastien Fath considered the church [...] "a bit radical but overall harmless", noting that this group had never been sued, and maintained that the church was criticized because of its proselytism and its rapid growth. Amiotte-Suchet deemed that the pastor's influence on the faithful was far from being as coercive as critics said. Poulat said, [...] "We can debate whether it may be a 'sect' in the sense of Weber; it is <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> 'secte' [...] in the popular and parliamentary sense of the term". Contacted by academics to participate in a documentary about the church, UNADFI and CCMM refused to explain their position. The Center for Studies on New Religions said the church's theology is [...] "clearly mainline", but was criticized [...] "because it does not belong to the World Council of Churches or other establishment church bodies".|$|E
500|$|Lee {{was given}} greater {{opportunities}} in 1912, appearing seven times for Middlesex in the Championship. The {{first of these}} appearances, against Warwickshire at Edgbaston, brought Lee his first wicket in first-class cricket when he caught Charles Baker [...] off his own bowling. He claimed five wickets [...] in the match, and another three against Nottinghamshire a month later, to total eight wickets for the season at 9.50 runs apiece and finish technically {{at the top of}} the county's bowling averages for the season. Lee joined the MCC bowling staff in 1913 at the invitation of A. J. Webbe, but he was used sparingly in first-class cricket that season, playing just three times, all for Middlesex. In the first of these matches, Lee scored 35 not out at the end of Middlesex's innings, helping his side to avoid the follow-on. His [...] "plucky knock" [...] was praised by captain Pelham Warner, who promoted him to bat at number five in the fourth innings, by which stage the game was heading for a draw. During 1913, although <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> regular in the Middlesex team, Lee asked his captain for his county cap, a request which Warner responded to with surprise that he had not already received it, and promptly asked for one to be sent down.|$|E
