40|$|The {{educational}} settings of 42 implanted profoundly deaf children 3 years after implantation {{were compared with}} the respective settings of 635 age-matched severely deaf and 511 profoundly deaf children with hearing aids. All implanted children received their implants before beginning school. The results revealed that 3 years after implantation. 38 % (16 children) of the implanted profoundly deaf children attended mainstream schools, whereas 57 % (24 <b>children)</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> a unit, or special class, in a mainstream school, and 5 % (two <b>children)</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> schools for the deaf. With regard to the age-matched profoundly deaf children with hearing aids, 12 % (63 children) attended mainstream schools, whereas 55 % (281 <b>children)</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> a unit of a mainstream school, and 33 % (167 <b>children)</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> schools for the deaf. In the group of age-matched severely deaf children, 38 % (239 children) attended mainstream schools, whereas 51 % (326 <b>children)</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> a unit of a mainstream school, and 11 % (70 <b>children)</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> schools for the deaf. Statistical analysis revealed a highly {{significant difference between the}} educational placement of implanted children and hearing-aided profoundly deaf children (p< 0. 00001), whereas there was no statistically significant difference between implanted children and hearing-aided severely deaf children. In conclusion, implanted profoundly deaf children who have received their implants before beginning school have the same profile of educational placement as aided severely deaf children rather than aided profoundly deaf children of the same age in the UK. This is likely to have significant implications for the future management of profoundly deaf children and to influence future planning of educational support services...|$|R
40|$|Risk {{exposures}} {{and predictions}} {{of child development}} outcomes typically estimate the independent effects of individual exposures. As a rule though, <b>children</b> <b>are</b> not exposed piecemeal to individual or single risks but, rather, {{they are exposed to}} clusters of risk. Many of these clusters of risks are better thought of as comprising a developmental "circumstance" with a substantial duration, over which period, additional risk exposures also accumulate. In this paper we examined the distribution of 16 single risk exposures for low language ability using latent class analysis across a sample of approximately 4000 children from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children. The best fitting model identified six distinct classes. 46 % of <b>children</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> a Developmentally Enabled group, 20 % <b>were</b> <b>in</b> a group typified as Working Poor families, 10 % of <b>children</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> group typified as Overwhelmed group, 9 % of <b>children</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> a group defined by Child Developmental Delay, 8 % of <b>children</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> a group defined by Low Human Capital, and 7 % of <b>children</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> a group defined by Resource Poor non-English Speaking background families. These groups had quantitatively and qualitatively distinct patterns of risk factors and showed different onward trajectories of receptive vocabulary. Our results demonstrate a range of multiple risk profiles in a population-representative sample of Australian children and highlight the mix of risk factors faced by children. Children with distinct patterns of risk factors have different onward trajectories of receptive vocabulary development...|$|R
25|$|Child labour {{is one of}} {{the most}} serious impacts that sweatshops have brought. According to the International Labour Office (2013), more than 250 million <b>children</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> the {{employment}} of which 170 million of them are engaged in textiles and garments industry in developing countries. In hopes of earning a living, many girls in these countries, such as Bangladesh and India, are willing to work at low wages for long working hours, said Sofie Ovaa, an officer of Stop Child Labour (Moulds, 2013). Most fashion manufacturing chains employ low-skilled labour and as child labour are easier to manage and even more suitable than adult labour for certain jobs such as cotton picking, it becomes a particular problem in sweatshops as they are vulnerable with no backups.|$|E

25|$|After it was {{established}} that infants could babble {{with their hands}} and their mouths, the patterns in which productions occurred were studied. Speaking and signing infants follow very similar maturational paths in language acquisition. Both go {{through a number of}} stages, and exhibit similar complexity in their babbling sequences. In studies where deaf and hearing children were compared, children learning sign language produced more multi-movement manual babbling than children who were not learning a sign language. There are three main components of manual babbling. The hand gestures contain a restricted set of phonetic units, show a syllabic organization, and are used without reference or meaning. This is comparable to aspects of vocal babbling as mentioned above. It is difficult to study manual babbling as often the manual activity can be mistaken as gestures rather than signs. When signing <b>children</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> fact babbling it will most often take place in front of their torso in a designated area that is called the phonetic space. One of the most common forms of manual babbling is the extension and spreading of all fingers. This babble {{is also one of the}} first indicators that an infant will begin to make in manual communication.|$|E
25|$|Himani Singh {{is played}} by Gurdeep Punj. She is Avatar's wife {{and the mother of}} Rohan, Dolly, Sunny, Nikki, and Bobby. She works as a {{hospital}} nurse and is often portrayed as dutiful, protective, and comedic. She loves her family and does everything to care for and protect them. She appears out of her element when she isn't nurturing them, especially Nikki, but as the series progresses, she begins to feel assured that her youngest <b>children</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> good hands and trusts that her husband and three elder children can look after Nikki and Bobby. She is notoriously conceited and enjoys bragging about her accomplishments, be they admirable, real, or otherwise. Himani used to work on the local news team and was also a poet in her high-school days. A running gag on the show is that she was involved in virtually every extracurricular activity at Arya College of Arts and Science, but still earned a nursing degree. She lets special opportunities go to her head, such as being on TV or singing in front of a group. She has a habit of taking any chance at publicity that may shine on her family to focus on her, but this never works out well; usually she ends up being cut from the project or tossed out of certain groups. Himani seldom accepts her children's misbehavior. It is revealed in the third special that she is pregnant again with her fifth child. In the middle of the third season, Himani quit her nursing job to be a stay-at-home mother to Nikki and Bobby. Himani is the equivalent of Amy Duncan in Good Luck Charlie, who {{is played by}} Leigh-Allyn Baker.|$|E
25|$|Ethiopia faces many historical, cultural, {{social and}} {{political}} obstacles that have restricted progress in education for many centuries. According to UNESCO reviews, most people in Ethiopia feel that work {{is more important than}} education, so they start {{at a very early age}} with little to no education. Children in rural areas are less likely to go to school than children in urban areas. Though gradually improving, most rural families cannot afford to send their children to school because parents believe that while their <b>children</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> school they cannot contribute to the household chores and income. Social awareness that education is important is something that Ethiopia lacks but has improved gradually. There is a need to change the importance of education in the country's social structure, and children should be encouraged and required to attend school and become educated. The society of Ethiopia expects teachers and parents to use corporal punishment to maintain order and discipline. Most believe that through punishing children for bad habits they in turn learn good ones. Also since the mid-1970s there was a drastic loss of professionals who left the country, mostly for economical reasons. Many educated Ethiopians sought higher salaries in foreign countries thus many of those who managed to finish higher education emigrated from Ethiopia creating an endless shortage of qualified professionals in every sector of the country. Now the custom of sending academics abroad with the risk of a brain drain is being replaced by expansion of masters and doctoral programs to up-grade academic staff. Instead, foreigners have been funding programs for leadership, management and pedagogic skills or sending staff to help strengthen teaching and management practices.|$|E
