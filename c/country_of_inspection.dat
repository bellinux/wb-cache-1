40|$|Growth and {{liberalization}} {{of world trade}} have increased the risks of introduction of quarantine plant pests into importing <b>countries.</b> Import <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> incoming commodities is a major tool for prevention of pest introductions related to world trade, but inspection capacities are limited. This article develops a theoretical and an empirical model for the optimal allocation <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> effort for phytosanitary <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> imported commodities when the inspecting agency has a limited capacity. It is shown that the optimal allocation <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> effort equalizes marginal costs of pest introduction across risky commodity pathways. The numerical illustration finds the optimal allocation <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> effort <b>of</b> chrysanthemum cuttings imported in the Netherlands. The numerical results suggest that "ceteris paribus", greater inspection effort should be allocated to pathways whose inspection yields a greater reduction in the expected costs of pest introduction. The numerical results also suggest that import inspection has a high marginal benefit. In particular, we found that each additional euro <b>of</b> the <b>inspection</b> capacity decreases the expected costs of pest introduction from 18 to 49 euros, depending on the initial inspection capacity.

This robot consist of a fore leg system, a rear leg system and a body. The fore and rear leg systems are constructed by using three worm gear system that are arranged at an angle of 120 degree with {{respect to each other}} to operate inside a pipe of different diameters. The springs are attached to each leg and the robot body to operate in pipes of 140 mm to 200 mm diameter range. Here, all major components of robot are designed. Modelling and assembly of robot components is done in Solidworks 11. Stress analysis of all major components is done in Solidworks 11 and Static stress analysis <b>of</b> proposed in-pipe <b>inspection</b> robot assembly is carried out in Ansys 13.

40|$|The {{quality of}} many goods and {{services}} may change randomly between the time of shipment and delivery, creating disputes over quality that can result in lemons-market equilibria. We investigate the potential <b>of</b> third-party <b>inspections</b> for such inefficiencies. We consider two types <b>of</b> <b>inspection,</b> ex post verification of quality in consignment contracts and ex ante certification in FOB contracts, which were instituted for fruits and vegetables in the U. S. when national markets were emerging. We show that both types <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> can counteract misallocations of quality found in lemons-market equilibria. Buyers prefer ex post verification to ex ante certification while sellers prefer the reverse. Government provision <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> services may be necessary for making provision <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> services economically viable, and may be desirable for reducing inefficiencies due to the costliness <b>of</b> <b>inspection.</b> The U.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} novel {{treatment}} of the inspection-system design problem when inspection is unreliable and subject to classification errors. Our approach, based on the theory of Error-Correcting Codes (ECC), leads to the development <b>of</b> a Self-Correcting <b>Inspection</b> (SCI) decision rule that does not require complete knowledge <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> error probabilities. We show that the proposed rule assures correct classification, if the number <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> errors {{is less than a}} certain number. We analyze the performance of the SCI decision rule under different inspection situations, including some situations that are uncommon in the field of error-correcting codes. Then, we show how the underlying mathematical structure can be applied to determine the number <b>of</b> <b>inspections</b> and the level <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> reliability in order to minimize the sum of inspection-related costs. The practical contribution of this work lies in that it expands the ability of the designer <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> systems to deal with cases where there is very little or no information regarding the reliability <b>of</b> the <b>inspection</b> operations. 1.

This article examines the technical reliability <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> processes in initial teacher training, drawing extensively on methodology and procedures adopted by the Office for Standards in Education (OFSTED) between 1996 and 1998. A definition of reliability is advanced and tested against the procedures <b>of</b> <b>inspection,</b> especially by examining the security of internal and external judgements at the pass/fail borderline and the moderation and training procedures deployed by OFSTED. The methodology <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> is found to be insufficiently reliable for the consequences which flow from it. Tensions are explored between the technicist model <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> underlying OFSTED initial teacher training procedures and the 'informed conoisseurship' model hitherto deployed by members of Her Majesty's Inspectorate. In consequence, there are unresolved tensions between the expressed aspiration for 'improvement through inspection' and the use <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> to police compliance...|$|R

40|$|The {{principle}} of proportionality applies to competition proceedings especially, {{when it comes to}} the exercise by the competition authority of its powers <b>of</b> <b>inspection.</b> Their use limits the economic freedom and right to privacy of the scrutinised undertakings in order to protect free competition.

40|$|Abstract. Steel {{storage tanks}} and other {{structures}} {{of such a}} kind of buildings have been extensively designed following the requirements of continuous cyclic operations. Because of many economically based reasons any engineering <b>inspections</b> <b>of</b> a huge volume are very expensive, so investigations of the local defects are practically important. In general, a local curve of a perfect geometrical shape influences on the mechanical state of the whole tank during its operation. The concentrators, which are expressed by stress concentration factors, may be “sharp” (holes, joints etc.) or “soft ” (dents, bulges and so on). Researches of the sharp defects are popular and well known, whereas the soft defects of a geometrically perfect shape are not exactly described by design standards <b>of</b> many <b>countries.</b> Natural <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> tank dents (volumes of tanks were from 1 000 to 50 000 m 3, diameter of dents from 0, 40 to 4, 50 m, a depth up to 120 mm) {{has shown that the}} analytical approach of their investigation by using existing design standards is rather complicated. On the other hand, the strain state analysis of a cylindrical thin shell depends on the geometric shape. The main objective of the presented investigations is development of an easy engineering algorithm for solution of the soft stress concentrator. It is interesting for the engineer-inspector, who can use short analytical expressions for computation of a dent defect value as well as strain state of the whole structure. The results derived from the proposed formulas, are compared with those <b>of</b> natural <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> real tanks and also with the results obtained b...|$|R
