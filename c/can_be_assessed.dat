5|$|The nerve {{receives}} {{close attention}} from surgeons since during neck surgery, especially thyroid and parathyroid surgery, the nerve {{is at risk}} for injury. Nerve damage <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>assessed</b> by laryngoscopy, during which a stroboscopic light confirms the absence of movement in the affected side of the vocal cords. The right recurrent laryngeal nerve is more susceptible to damage during thyroid surgery because it {{is close to the}} bifurcation of the right inferior thyroid artery, variably passing in front of, behind, or between the branches. The nerve is permanently damaged in 0.33% of thyroid surgery, and transiently in 38% of surgeries, {{and is one of the}} leading causes of medicolegal issues for surgeons.|$|E

5|$|The Yukon Quest's rules allow race {{officials}} latitude {{on whether}} to assess a time penalty or monetary fine on mushers who violate one or more regulations. The most serious penalties <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>assessed</b> for mistreating dogs. Racers have been forcibly removed from the race for inadequate dog care; the most recent instance of this took place in 2008, when Donald Smidt was removed. More common are minor time and monetary penalties. For example, Dan Kaduce was fined $500 of his eventual $9,000 winnings for missing roll call at a mandatory meeting in 2007. Fines of $500 also have been levied for not attending the finish banquet, littering, not wearing start and finish bibs, or losing veterinary records. These minor penalties can {{have an effect on}} the race. In 2009, Hugh Neff, then in second place, was penalized two hours for mushing on the Circle Hot Springs road. As a result, he finished four minutes behind Sebastian Schnuelle, the winner.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} larval {{development}} inside the seeds which {{are protected by}} the pods, most inventorying methods are based on population of B. rufimanus adult in the field or at emergence. Adult population density can be estimated by counts on plants at field colonization. The development semiochemical attractants trapping systems for both monitoring and pest control has received particular interest in ongoing research on the weevil. Egg density can be estimated on young developing pods (>2 cm) during the oviposition period. Eggs are however small (<1mm length), green-yellowish, therefore difficult to observe. In addition, population estimate are difficult to obtain as egg laying is spread over time until 5–10 days {{after the end of}} flowering (BBCH 77). After harvest, seed quality can be observed manually at harvest and characterized according to pest damage (healthy, with no trace of damage/containing developing larvae/trace of emerged B. rufimanus adult (a hole in the seed). Alternative methods exist to sort the seeds: sorting can be done using differences in seed density due to the presence of the developing larva or of the hole left by the emerged adult, estimation of damages seeds can be done by tomography analysis. Additionally, the end of larval and pupal diapause and therefore the emergence of B. rufimanus can be induced via a solution of NaOCl and chinosol in 7 days at 30 °C, allowing the estimation of an overall infestation rate <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>assessed.</b>|$|E

25|$|Many {{aspects of}} {{structural}} quality can be evaluated only statically through {{the analysis of}} the software inner structure, its source code, at the unit level, the technology level and the system level, which is in effect how its architecture adheres to sound principles of software architecture outlined in a paper on the topic by OMG. But some structural qualities, such as usability, <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>assessed</b> only dynamically (users or others acting in their behalf interact with the software or, at least, some prototype or partial implementation; even the interaction with a mock version made in cardboard represents a dynamic test because such version can be considered a prototype).

25|$|The {{competition}} {{hypothesis is}} best described using three principles.
