5|$|Bees {{can suffer}} serious effects from toxic <b>chemicals</b> <b>in</b> their environments. These include various {{synthetic}} chemicals, such as insecticides and fertilizers, {{as well as}} a variety of naturally occurring chemicals from plants, such as ethanol resulting from the fermentation of organic materials. Bee intoxication can result from exposure to ethanol from fermented nectar, ripe fruits, and manmade and natural <b>chemicals</b> <b>in</b> the environment.|$|E

5|$|More generally, {{people make}} {{a wide range}} of uses of insects, both {{practical}} and symbolic. On the other hand, attitudes to insects are often negative, and extensive efforts are made to kill them. The widespread use of insecticides has failed to exterminate any insect pest, but has caused resistance to commonly-used <b>chemicals</b> <b>in</b> a thousand insect species.|$|E

5|$|Several {{risk factors}} have been {{proposed}} and {{are the subject of}} ongoing research. Due to characteristic early onset many studies have focused on parental factors around conception and during gestation.

5|$|The <b>chemicals</b> <b>in</b> the red-colored zone {{include an}} {{aromatic}} quinone, beta-carotene, and chlorophyll. The quinone is deep-red colored pigment chiodectonic acid, thought {{to function as}} a radiation protectant; in combination with beta-carotene, which has an established role in cellular DNA repair following exposure of the organism to UV-damage, such radiation protectants are often found in lichens and in extremophilic situations and are essential for survival.|$|E
5|$|The painful stings of {{bees are}} mostly {{associated}} with the poison gland and the Dufour's gland which are abdominal exocrine glands containing various <b>chemicals.</b> <b>In</b> Lasioglossum leucozonium, the Dufour's Gland mostly contains octadecanolide {{as well as some}} eicosanolide.

5|$|Acne vulgaris is {{a chronic}} skin {{disease of the}} pilosebaceous unit and {{develops}} due to blockages in the skin's hair follicles. These blockages are thought to occur {{as a result of}} the following four abnormal processes: a higher than normal amount of oily sebum production (influenced by androgens), excessive deposition of the protein keratin leading to comedo formation, colonization of the follicle by Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) bacteria, and the local release of pro-inflammatory <b>chemicals</b> <b>in</b> the skin.|$|E
5|$|Also {{exceptionally}} challenging will be {{the movement}} and destruction of deadly agents such as sarin, VX nerve agents and mustard agent during the civil war. The chemical weapons convention disallows movement of such deadly agents outside the country holding them, but Security Council Resolution 2118 allows extraordinary measures {{to be taken in}} Syria. Some of the chemicals will need to be transported along the highway between Damascus and Homs, which is still contested as of December 2013. Syria has requested the international community provide armored vehicles to assist in safe transport of the <b>chemicals.</b> <b>In</b> February 2014, Syria stated that rebels had attempted to attack two convoys transporting chemical weapons.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of his}} {{contract}} with the Batavian Society, van Kinsbergen had to take photographs of Borobudur, which had just been cleaned and restored. However, {{when he went to}} photograph the Panataran Hindu temple complex in East Java in 1867, he ran out of <b>chemicals.</b> <b>In</b> his enthusiasm for photographing the many reliefs of the temple complex, he used up so many glass slides that he could not go to Borobudur as he had intended to. The Society was nervous about van Kinsbergen's delay, so they did not grant his request to supply new slides.|$|E

5|$|Balard found bromine <b>chemicals</b> <b>in</b> the ash of seaweed {{from the}} salt marshes of Montpellier. The seaweed {{was used to}} produce iodine, but also {{contained}} bromine. Balard distilled the bromine from a solution of seaweed ash saturated with chlorine. The properties of the resulting substance were intermediate between those of chlorine and iodine; thus he tried {{to prove that the}} substance was iodine monochloride (ICl), but after failing to do so he was sure that he had found a new element, and named it muride, derived from the Latin word muria for brine.|$|E
5|$|Cnidocytes {{can only}} fire once, and about 25% of a hydra's nematocysts are lost from its tentacles when {{capturing}} a brine shrimp. Used cnidocytes {{have to be}} replaced, which takes about 48hours. To minimise wasteful firing, two types of stimulus are generally required to trigger cnidocytes: nearby sensory cells detect <b>chemicals</b> <b>in</b> the water, and their cilia respond to contact. This combination prevents them from firing at distant or non-living objects. Groups of cnidocytes are usually connected by nerves and, if one fires, {{the rest of the}} group requires a weaker minimum stimulus than the cells that fire first.|$|E
5|$|In July 2013, {{scientists}} from the University of Maryland and the US Department of Agriculture found {{that a combination of}} pesticides has been contaminating the pollen bees use to feed their hives. When researchers collected pollen from hives on the east coast, they discovered that it was contaminated (on average) with 9 different fungicides and pesticides, although scientists found a blend of 21 different agricultural <b>chemicals</b> <b>in</b> one sample of pollen. Eight ag chemicals were identified to be associated with increased risk of infection by Nosema ceranae.|$|E

5|$|Internal parasites of {{the common}} loon include many species of worms, {{including}} flatworms, tapeworms, nematodes and spiny-headed worms. High levels of worms may result from feeding changes due to low availability of fish, {{and can lead to}} illness and death. Protozoal infections including one caused by Eimeria gaviae and avian malaria has been recorded in this loon. The black fly Simulium annulus is closely associated with the common loon to which it is attracted to <b>chemicals</b> <b>in</b> the uropygial gland secretions as well as by visual and tactile cues. This fly is detrimental to loons, their preferred hosts, transmitting blood-borne parasites and viruses, and causing nest abandonment when numbers are high. External parasites include ischnoceran feather lice, although these are not found on the bird's head.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius repraesentaneus was {{reported}} to have antibiotic activity against Staphylococcus aureus in 1947. The substance responsible for the antibacterial activity, determined to be heat-sensitive, was not identified. A number of chemicals have been isolated and identified from L.repraesentaneus that can regulate the growth of plants. The <b>chemicals,</b> <b>in</b> a class called sesquiterpenoids are named repraesentin A, and two related sesquiterpenes, namely repraesentins B and C. These compounds were shown to promote the radicle elongation of lettuce seedlings by 136%, 118% and 184% at 67 ppm, respectively. Other compounds reported in 2006 are repraesentins D, E, and F. Repraesentin E showed the strongest growth promotion activity, 164% at 3.6µm, of the three compounds toward the radicle elongation of lettuce seedlings.|$|E
5|$|Purified water {{should be}} used for {{watering}} purposes, although 'hard water' is tolerated. This is done to minimise the build-up of minerals and <b>chemicals</b> <b>in</b> the soil. Water purity greater than 100p.p.m. of total dissolved solids is often quoted as ideal. A reverse osmosis unit can be used to filter the water or, alternatively, bottled distilled water can be purchased. Watering should be done regularly. However, plants {{should not be allowed to}} sit in water, as this may lead to root rot.|$|E
