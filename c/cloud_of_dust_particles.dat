Multistep Monte Carlo collision is employed to simulate the dust charging process, which is validated for the cases of charging of isolated dust particle and ensemble dust particles, where results indicate good agreement between simulation and theories. The code is then used to investigate plasma properties near a charged surface in a vicinity of a <b>cloud</b> <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> <b>particles.</b> The simulation reveals that a cloud of dust particle close to a spacecraft surface affects plasma densities around the spacecraft as well as the spacecraft’s surface potential.

40|$|For a {{body with}} {{negligible}} mass {{moving in the}} gravitational field of a star and one planet in a circular orbit (the circular restricted three-body problem) five equilibrium points exist and are known as the Lagrangian points. The positions of the Lagrangian points are not valid for dust particles because in the derivation of the Lagrangian points is assumed that no other forces beside the gravitation act on the body with negligible mass. Here we determined positions of the equilibrium points for the dust particles in the circular restricted three-body problem with radiation. The equilibrium points are located on curves connecting the Lagrangian points in the circular restricted three-body problem. The equilibrium points for Jupiter are distributed in large interval of heliocentric distances due to its large mass.

40|$|For a 21 day {{interval}} {{beginning on}} Jan 28, 2007, {{the radio and}} plasma wave instruments (S/WAVES) on the twin STEREO spacecraft detected intense impulse-like emissions in both the time-domain receivers and {{the low end of}} the frequency-domain receivers. These emissions were much more intense on the STEREO Ahead instrument, but were detected by both. During that interval, the two STEREO spacecraft were only separated by about 0. 1 deg in heliocentric longitude. All attempts to understand the emissions in terms of electrical disturbances onboard the spacecraft were unsuccessful and, since the impulsive events essentially ceased on Feb 18, 2007, the entire study was put on lower priority. However, beginning abruptly on July 20, 2007, a very similar and more intense episode of impulses was detected exclusively by S/WAVES on the STEREO Ahead spacecraft, now separated from Behind by more than 20 deg of heliocentric longitude. This new episode lasted nearly as long as the Jan-Feb episode, some 20 days, ending on Aug. 9. On Aug. 13, 2007, the STEREO Behind spacecraft arrived at the same heliocentric longitude as the Ahead spacecraft was at on July 20 and the S/WAVES instrument abruptly started detecting impulsive events, although at lower intensities than those on Ahead. The individual waveform of the detected impulses is very similar to signals recorded by the Voyager plasma wave (PWS) and radio astronomy (PRA) instruments and more recently by the Cassini radio and plasma wave science (RPWS) instrument when those spacecraft plunged through Saturn's rings. Those Saturnian signals are attributed to micron-sized <b>dust</b> <b>particle</b> impacts on the spacecraft which creates a temporary plasma cloud which, in turn, induces an electrical signal on the antennas.

Blue light from the LED propagates through a slab of scattering material, where phosphor particles convert the light to different wavelengths, composing white light.

No such EIA (for the creation of the whole zone, that is, all the cement projects, the biodiesel industrial production factory, the liquid fertilizer industrial production plant together), and in the absence of such an overall assessment it can only be assumed that no reasoned and published decision based on the criteria established by Annex III (which explicitly requires taking into account characteristics of the projects such as the size of the project, the overall effect in addition to other projects, pollution and other negative impacts, the risk of accidents, with special consideration <b>of</b> <b>clouds</b> <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> <b>particles</b> suspended in the air.

Against what the Port says is this “technically necessary height” of a total of 20 m, the residents say that the silos need only be raised some 4 or 5 m from the ground in order to vertically unload into trucks, and adding the 8 m high silos above this would give a total of some 12 m, within the general height restrictions of the Port, and would allow the re-siting of the four silos on Quay 14 with the minimum visual and environmental (including noise, cement dust and traffic) impact.|$|R

40|$|Galaxies {{with all}} their varieties, have been home to billions of stars during their life. It {{is because of the}} {{presence}} of these shining stars that we are able to observe them through the cosmic time. Although we observe galaxies mostly through the light emitted by their stars, we cannot resolve these stars individually unless they are very close by. Because of this, the cumulative light from billions of stars in every galaxy is analyzed using stellar population models to extract information about the evolution of galaxies. Stellar light does not reach us without passing through the interstellar medium (ISM) which contains <b>clouds</b> <b>of</b> gas and <b>dust</b> <b>particles.</b> Gas and <b>dust</b> can absorb and re-emit the light from stars, or scatter it towards us and make interpreting what we observe in galaxies very complicated. Despite all these difficulties, just by analyzing the total light from galaxies, we can constrain the global physical properties of galaxies such as stellar mass, star formation rate and age, based on the stellar population models. By combining stellar population models and photoionization models we can further analyze the emission line spectrum of star-forming galaxies coming from ionized gas around young stars which provide us with a wealth of information about the small-scale properties of galaxies e. g., the ISM.

40|$|Using {{case study}} {{approach}} my investigation on aerosol's effects on fair weather cumulus clouds shows {{that not only}} can aerosol reduce cloud droplet sizes like in the case <b>of</b> stratiform <b>clouds,</b> but also they can increase droplet sizes. Atmospheric water vapor loading explains nearly 70 % of variations in the dependence of droplet size on aerosol loading for cases over Eastern United States. This finding withstands serious scrutinizing under different scenarios of artificial correlations. A further study {{on a global scale}} indicates that only two areas, Eastern US and coastal region of Southeast China, show increasing trend of droplet size with aerosol loading. Results from other regions agree well with findings from past studies further ruling out artificial correlation. Relationship between aerosol loading and cloud liquid water path differs significantly for marine stratocumulus clouds and continental cumuli. Two possible explanations for our findings are confirmed by state-of-the-art cloud resolving model simulations. Deep convective clouds properties are shown to obey a few universally observable relationships. Their cloud top ice particle sizes are positively correlated with their vertical height and they are significantly affected by topography; their optical depth distributions have signature shapes associated with individual regions; their brightness temperature distributions show agreement with the fixed anvil temperature hypothesis. A conceptual model is proposed to understand cloud hydrometeor evolution and is used to study aerosol's influence. Anthropogenic pollution and smoke are shown to decrease ice particle sizes by delaying coalescence process and prolonging condensational growth. As a result cloud glaciation height is increased that possibly leads to invigoration <b>of</b> <b>cloud</b> development. <b>Dust</b> <b>particles</b> are demonstrated to increase ice particle sizes probably by acting as giant condensation nuclei or ice nuclei.

We show that the longitudinal acceleration <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> <b>particles</b> {{is proportional to the}} square of the soliton amplitude O(|b_m|^ 2), while the transversal acceleration is of O(|b_m|). In the conditions of the interstellar medium the resulting velocity <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> <b>particles</b> can reach 0. 3 to 1 km s^- 1. Comment: 8 pages, no figs, accepted in Phys. Lett. ...|$|R
