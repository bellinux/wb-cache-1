A stratified random sample method was used. The study population consisted of 165 employees at Grate <b>Cooler</b> <b>Section</b> with a sample of 92 workers which included seven heads of departments. Research instruments which were used to gather data included questionnaires, observations and interviews. The major findings was that heat is the major hazard at Grate <b>Cooler</b> <b>section</b> and human factors are contributing factors of accidents causation at Grate <b>Cooler</b> <b>section</b> as such accidents are mainly caused by co-workers.

The research recommends that the company should be certified to any standard of safety, Health and Environment systems such as ISO 14001, OHAS 18001 in order to reduce accidents and should have a comprehensive risk management system.

In the closed-loop, the power input is supplied by a semi-transparent gold-film which provides a uniform wall heat flux while enabling flow visualization. The proposed model was successfully validated against experimental data obtained in this study. Results obtained with the proposed model also indicate that traditional one-dimensional models can significantly overpredict the average velocity in thermosyphons when strong mixed-convection effects are present in the heated and <b>cooled</b> <b>sections.</b> It is also shown that conduction in the pipe wall can significantly affect the velocity and temperature fields in mixed-convection flows.

Curvature and pseudoplasticity substantially increase heat transfer and render the axial velocity profile more uniform. As a result, processing times in heater, holder and cooler can be shorter, thus greatly improving thiamine retention.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a theoretical and experimental investigation of thermodenuders that addresses two controversial issues: (1) equilibration time scales and (2) {{the need for}} an activated carbon (AC) denuder in the <b>cooling</b> <b>section.</b> We describe a plug flow model for transport phenomena in a TD, which can be used to simulate the rate of vapor build-up in the gas phase and the corresponding change in particle size distribution. Model simulations were found to have excellent agreement with experiments performed with pure and mixed dicarboxylic acid aerosols. Both simulations and experiments showed that the aerosols approached equilibrium within reasonable residence times (15 s– 30 s) for aerosol concentrations and size distributions typical for laboratory measurements, and that volatility studies at sufficiently high aerosol loadings, therefore, need not resort to kinetic models for inference of thermodynamic properties. However, for size distributions relevant for ambient aerosols, equilibration time scales were much larger than residence times available with current TD designs. We have also performed dimensional analysis on the problem of equilibration in TDs, and derived a dimensionless equilibration parameter which can be used to determine the residence time needed for an aerosol of given size distribution and kinetic properties to approach equilibrium. It is also shown theoretically and empirically that aerosol volatility has no effect on the equilibration time scales. Model simulations and experiments showed that with aerosol size distributions relevant to both ambient and laboratory measurements re-condensation in the <b>cooling</b> <b>section,</b> with and without an AC denuder, was negligible. Thus, there is no significant benefit in using an AC denuder in the <b>cooling</b> <b>section.</b> Due to the risk of stripping volatile material from the aerosol, the use of AC denuders in the <b>cooling</b> <b>section</b> should be avoided. Finally, we present a rationale for why &Delta;C is the proper measure of volatility, while using mass fraction remaining (MFR) can be misleading...|$|E
