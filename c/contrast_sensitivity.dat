25|$|Contrast {{is defined}} as the {{difference}} in brightness between two stimuli, divided by the sum of brightness of both stimuli. <b>Contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> is the inverse of the smallest contrast that can be detected, a <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of 100 means that the smallest contrast that can be detected is 1%. Birds have comparably low <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> to mammals. Humans have been shown to detect contrasts as low as 0.5-1%, whereas most birds tested have require ca 10% contrast to show a behavioural response. A <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> function describes an animal's ability to resolve detect the contrast of patterns of different spatial frequency (detail). For stationary viewing experiments the <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> is highest for a medium spatial frequency and lower for higher and lower spatial frequencies.|$|E

50|$|The {{ability of}} a person with normal visual acuity to see fine details is {{determined}} {{by his or her}} <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> <b>Contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> is the reciprocal of the smallest contrast for which a person can see a sine-wave grating. A person's <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> function is <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> as a function of spatial frequency. Normally, peak <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> is at about 4 cycles per degree of visual angle.

50|$|Using {{the results}} of a <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> exam, a <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> curve can be plotted, with angular {{frequency}} on the horizontal, and contrast threshold on the vertical axis. Also known as <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> function (CSF), the plot demonstrates the normal range of <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity,</b> and will indicate diminished <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> in patients who fall below the normal curve. Some graphs contain “contrast sensitivity acuity equivalents”, with lower acuity values falling in the area under the curve. In patients with normal visual acuity and concomitant reduced <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity,</b> the area under the curve serves as a graphical representation of the visual deficit. It can be because of this impairment in <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivity</b> that patients have difficulty driving at night, climbing stairs and other activities of daily living in which contrast is reduced.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{a method for}} evaluation of the contrast of a moving lattice (grille) pattern without imaging data acquisition and image analysis. We characterize the dynamic performance of the display under test {{in terms of the}} periodic impulse response followed by evaluation of the contrast of the corresponding test-pattern in motion. It thus becomes possible to simulate moving grille patterns with any pitch, arbitrary gray-levels and speed of translation by measuring the corresponding temporal luminance variations at a fixed location. This approach is attractive due to reduced instrumental efforts and the transparent evaluation based on suitable spatial <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivities.</b> ...|$|R

Here we measure detection threshold contours within three planes in a 3 -dimensional cone contrast space to reveal the L, M and S-cone weights to the two cone opponent mechanisms, L/M and S/(L+M). We find these remain constant across eccentricity suggesting the underlying structures of the cone opponent mechanisms are invariant.

There is however, a growing appreciation that most natural phenomena is non-linear, capable of exhibiting variable, indeed unpredictable behaviors {{not able to}} be expressed meaningfully in har-monic terms. A relative newcomer to an evolving range of non-linear tools is the T-entropy, a computable measure of information content for strings that may be applied to suitably encoded time-series. This paper highlights firstly the complementary aspects of the FFT and T-entropy in the characterisation of time-series but also their respective and <b>contrasting</b> <b>sensitivities.</b> The simple illustrations provided here of time-series comprising a mixture of harmonic and non-stationary components, subject to sampling and coarse graining, demonstrate effects which complicate interpreta-tion of particularly the T-entropy results. 1...|$|R

We show in a 2 × 2 AFC task, designed to minimize any potential artefacts due to criterion level or response bias, that sensitivities are essentially equal for shear and uniform motion under general conditions. It has also been claimed that position tracking enhances sensitivity for shear motion. We added moving sinusoidal gratings to stationary sinusoidal gratings of the same spatial frequency and orientation, to create stimuli in which position changes and motion energy have opposite directions, to show that shear and uniform motion are both subserved by motion-energy mechanisms at speeds above 2. 0 deg/s and by position tracking at slower speeds...|$|R
40|$|Visual {{sensitivity}} decreases with age, {{and this}} presumably {{has an impact}} on face recognition. However, the relationship between aging in basic visual processing and in the sensory and cognitive mechanisms mediating face recognition is not well understood. Face detection, a foundational step in recognizing faces, relies primarily on sensory information. This study measured the ability to detect facial configuration and contrast detection in young (59 years). Performance on both face detection and contrast detection was moderately degraded in the middle-aged group compared with the young group and was further degraded in elderly adults. Face detection was correlated strongly with <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivities,</b> but only weakly with verbal IQ. The results suggest that face detection ability begins to reduce in early aging, and is associated with spatiotemporal visual processing. Copyright 2009, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R
40|$|Foveal target {{detection}} thresholds are elevated {{by presenting}} a counterphasing, vertical squarewave grating in the peripheral retina. This psychophysical "shift effect" {{has been considered}} to be an analogue of the neurophysiological "periphery effect" first described by McIlwain (1964; Journal of Neurophysiology, 27, 1154 - 1173). Physiological response properties of cells from the retina and lateral geniculate nucleus of cat and primate visual systems predict that sensitivity thresholds should also be elevated for peripheral targets {{in the presence of a}} foveal counterphasing mask. In these experiments, <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivities</b> for human observers were obtained using a two-interval forced-choice procedure for peripheral target sinusoids in the presence of a foveal counterphasing mask.

40|$|Achromatopsia {{is a rare}} {{autosomal}} recessive disorder which shows color blindness, severely impaired visual acuity, and extreme sensitivity to bright light. Mutations in the alpha subunits of the cone cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (CNGA 3) are responsible for about 1 / 4 of achromatopsia in the U. S. and Europe. Here, we test whether gene replacement therapy using an AAV 5 vector could restore cone-mediated function and arrest cone degeneration in the cpfl 5 mouse, a naturally occurring mouse model of achromatopsia with a CNGA 3 mutation. We show that gene therapy leads to significant rescue of cone-mediated ERGs, normal visual acuities and <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivities.</b> Normal expression and outer segment localization of both M- and S-opsins were maintained in treated retinas.

40|$|Channelrhodopsin- 2 (ChR 2), {{one of the}} archea-type rhodopsins {{from green}} algae, is a {{potentially}} useful optogenetic tool for restoring vision in patients with photoreceptor degeneration, such as retinitis pigmentosa. If the ChR 2 gene is transferred to retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), which send visual information to the brain, the RGCs may be repurposed to act as photoreceptors. In this study, by using a transgenic rat expressing ChR 2 specifically in the RGCs under the regulation of a Thy- 1. 2 promoter, we tested the possibility that direct photoactivation of RGCs could restore effective vision. Although the <b>contrast</b> <b>sensitivities</b> of the optomotor responses of transgenic rats {{were similar to those}} observed in the wild-type rats, they were enhanced for visual stimuli of low-spatial frequency after the degeneration of native photoreceptors.
