The map was marked off in a square grid, but this was used for tracking hidden movement, not to regulate regular movement. Movement instead used range cards, which were also used to <b>check</b> <b>firing</b> ranges. The rectangular (not square) units were allowed to rotate on their centers before using the range card, and the system gave bonuses for firing on a flank.|$|E
50|$|On 30 November 1917 at Little Priel Farm, east of Epehy, France, {{during the}} Battle of Cambrai, Sergeant Gourley was {{in command of}} a section of howitzers. During an enemy advance, when their forces were within {{a few hundred yards}} of him, both to the front and on one flank, and though plagued by snipers, Sergeant Gourley managed to keep one gun firing. At one point he pulled the gun out of the pit and engaged a machine-gun at 500 yards, {{knocking}} it out with a direct hit.

Though the enemy advanced in force getting within 400 yards in front, between 300 and 400 yards to one flank and with snipers in the rear, Sjt.

40|$|Following the {{alarming}} incidences of fire outbreaks in Nigeria, {{there is the}} need to implement the system that is sensitive and can help to <b>check</b> <b>fire</b> incidence in protected areas. One of such systems is the fire detection and alarm system. A prime requirement of the system is that it should incorporate a battery backup and a battery charger, a temperature rise sensing unit, a smoke sensing unit and a fault detection unit in accordance with the Internationally acceptable standard. In this work we developed a fire detection system that incorporates both temperature sensing and photoelectric transducer capability. The developed security system has applications in private homes, public buildings. The developed system is portable, so it can be used almost anywhere. It is cheap, easy to operate and can be produced locally at minimal cost. This device can help to avert the incidence of fire disaster in our country...|$|R
