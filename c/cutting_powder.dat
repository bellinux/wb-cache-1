40|$|Recent {{experiments}} with a flextensional piezoelectric actuator {{have led to}} the development of a sampler with a bit that is designed to produce and capture a full set of sample forms including volatiles, <b>powdered</b> <b>cuttings,</b> and core fragments. The flextensional piezoelectric actuator is a part of a series of devices used to amplify the generated strain from piezoelectric actuators. Other examples include stacks, bimorphs, benders, and cantilevers. These devices combine geometric and resonance amplifications to produce large stroke at high power density. The operation of this sampler/drill was demonstrated using a 3 x 2 x 1 -cm actuator weighing 12 g using power of about 10 -W and a preload of about 10 N. A limestone block was drilled to a depth of about 1 cm in five minutes to produce <b>powdered</b> <b>cuttings.</b> It is generally hard to collect volatiles from random surface profiles found in rocks and sediment, <b>powdered</b> <b>cuttings,</b> and core fragments. Toward the end of collecting volatiles, the actuator and the bit are covered with bellows-shaped shrouds to prevent fines and other debris from reaching the analyzer. A tube with a miniature bellows (to provide flexibility) is connected to the bit and directs the flow of the volatiles to the analyzer. Another modality was conceived where the hose is connected to the bellows wall directly to allow the capture of volatiles generated both inside and outside the bit. A wide variety of commercial bellows used in the vacuum and microwave industries can be used to design the volatiles capture mechanism. The piezoelectric drilling mechanism can potentially be operated in a broad temperature range from about- 200 to less than 450 C. The actuators used here are similar to the actuators that are currently baselined to fly as part of the inlet funnel shaking mechanism design of MSL (Mars Science Laboratory). The space qualification of these parts gives this drill a higher potential for inclusion in a future mission, especially when considering its characteristics of low mass, small size, low power, and low axial loads for sampling...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThermal plasma {{generated}} {{either by}} transferred arc or by plasma torches {{are involved in}} many industrial processes including, for example, <b>cutting,</b> welding, <b>powder</b> synthesis or coating elaboration by plasma spray techniques. The common feature is that electrical energy is converted into thermal energy, which must be transferred differently following {{the goal of the}} technique. Cutting requires a high thermal flux density to the anode in order to optimize both the accuracy and the speed of cutting. On the opposite, heat transfer to the anode of a plasma spray torch needs to be reduced, as much as possible, in order to slow down the nozzle erosion which is responsible, among other problems, of the monotonic deviation of the torche performances over a long time scale. This presentation is devoted to a general approach of the physical processes concerning an electric arc, thermally constricted and confined in the channel of a plasma torch nozzle.

40|$|This drill (see Figure 1) is {{the primary}} sample {{acquisition}} element of the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) that collects powdered samples from various types of rock (from clays to massive basalts) at depths up to 50 mm below the surface. A rotary-percussive sample acquisition device was developed {{with an emphasis on}} toughness and robustness to handle the harsh environment on Mars. It is the first rover-based sample acquisition device to be flight-qualified (see Figure 2). This drill features an autonomous tool change-out on a mobile robot, and novel voice-coil-based percussion. The drill comprises seven subelements. Starting {{at the end of the}} drill, there is a bit assembly that cuts the rock and collects the sample. Supporting the bit is a subassembly comprising a chuck mechanism to engage and release the new and worn bits, respectively, and a spindle mechanism to rotate the bit. Just aft of that is a percussion mechanism, which generates hammer blows to break the rock and create the dynamic environment used to flow the powdered sample. These components are mounted to a translation mechanism, which provides linear motion and senses weight-on-bit with a force sensor. There is a passive-contact sensor/stabilizer mechanism that secures the drill fs position on the rock surface, and flex harness management hardware to provide the power and signals to the translating components. The drill housing serves as the primary structure of the turret, to which the additional tools and instruments are attached. The drill bit assembly (DBA) is a passive device that is rotated and hammered in order to cut rock (i. e. science targets) and collect the <b>cuttings</b> (<b>powder)</b> in a sample chamber until ready for transfer to the CHIMRA (Collection and Handling for Interior Martian Rock Analysis). The DBA consists of a 5 / 8 -in. (. 1. 6 - cm) commercial hammer drill bit whose shank has been turned down and machined with deep flutes designed for aggressive cutting removal. Surrounding the shank of the bit is a thick-walled maraging steel collection tube allowing the powdered sample to be augured up the hole into the sample chamber. For robustness, the wall thickness of the DBA was maximized while still ensuring effective sample collection. There are four recesses in the bit tube that are used to retain the fresh bits in their bit box. The rotating bit is supported by a back-to-back duplex bearing pair within a housing that is connected to the outer DBA housing by two titanium diaphragms. The only bearings on the drill in the sample flow are protected by a spring-energized seal, and an integrated shield that diverts the ingested powdered sample from the moving interface. The DBA diaphragms provide radial constraint of the rotating bit and form the sample chambers. Between the diaphragms there is a sample exit tube from which the sample is transferred to the CHIMRA. To ensure that the entire collected sample is retained, no matter the orientation of the drill with respect to gravity during sampling, the pass-through from the forward to the aft chamber resides opposite to the exit tube...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{selective}} {{and real}} time monitoring of oxidising gases in atmosphere by semiconductor gas sensors remains {{a real challenge}} despite all improvements to reach analyzer performances. Thanks to its insensitivity to reducing species and its high reactivity with oxidising ones, even for low concentrations, copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) {{is one of the}} most attractive semiconductor for this application. In recent works, we have shown that selective detection of O 3 can be obtained with CuPc based gas sensor, using an appropriate methodology of measurements exploiting the fastest kinetics of response to this gas [1 - 2]. For the selective detection of NO 2 in air, ozone constitutes the most important interfering agent and leads to the irreversible degradation of phthalocyanine molecular units in long term which reduces the sensors lifetime [3]. Thus, to efficient monitoring of NO 2 in atmosphere by phthalocyanine gas sensors, it appears necessary to eliminate O 3 without altering NO 2 concentration, by means of selective filter. Among all the material investigated as ozone filter (MnO 2 powder or impregnated grids, charcoal, C 60 <b>powder,</b> stainless steel <b>cuttings,</b> indigo <b>powder</b> [...] .), only indigo can be considered as a real selective ozone filter. Moreover, indigo powder being easily sublimed to be deposited as thin layers, this material is really suitable for the realization of integrated selective ozone filter. The structure investigated in this work is constituted by a 300 nm-CuPc thin film as sensitive layer and an additional indigo evaporated film as the filter layer. The range of thickness investigated for indigo layer is 10 - 100 nm. The very low intrinsic conductivity of indigo films (Σ = 2. 10 - 107 - 1. cm- 1) makes them insulating, that's avoid bypassing the sensitive layer. Sensor responses measured for the same concentration of NO 2 and O 3 emphasize that response and recovery times remain high, gas/phthalocyanine interactions are reversible, the response under O 3 is negligible and kinetics of response to NO 2 is slower than device without indigo filter due probably to the slow diffusion of NO 2 species through the filtering layer to reach the sensitive one. The last point is confirmed by experiments made on structures with different thicknesses of indigo: the thicker the layer is, the slower the kinetics of response is. The integrated indigo layer on phthalocyanine sensors makes them selective to NO 2 and avoids the fast ageing effect due to the strong and irreversible interaction of O 3 on the sensitive layer...|$|R
40|$|A {{miniature}} CHEMIN XRD/XRF (X-Ray Diffraction/X-Ray Fluourescence) {{instrument is}} currently being developed for definitive mineralogic analysis of soils and rocks on Mars. One of the technical issues {{that must be addressed}} in order to enable XRD analysis on an extraterrestrial body is how best to obtain a representative sample powder for analysis. For XRD powder diffraction analyses, it is beneficial to have a fine-grained sample to reduce preferred orientation effects and to provide a statistically significant number of crystallites to the X-ray beam. Although a 2 -dimensional detector as used in the CHEMIN instrument will produce good results with poorly prepared powders, the quality of the data will improve if the sample is fine-grained and randomly oriented. An Ultrasonic/Sonic Driller/Corer (USDC) currently being developed at JPL is an effective mechanism of sampling rock to produce cores and <b>powdered</b> <b>cuttings.</b> It requires low axial load (< 5 N) and thus offers significant advantages for operation from lightweight platforms and in low gravity environments. The USDC is lightweight (< 0. 5 kg), and can be driven at low power (< 5 W) using duty cycling. It consists of an actuator with a piezoelectric stack, ultrasonic horn, free-mass, and drill bit. The stack is driven with a 20 kHz AC voltage at resonance. The strain generated by the piezoelectric is amplified by the horn by a factor of up to 10 times the displacement amplitude. The tip impacts the free-mass and drives it into the drill bit in a hammering action. The free-mass rebounds to interact with the horn tip leading to a cyclic rebound at frequencies in the range of 60 - 1000 Hz. It does not require lubricants, drilling fluid or bit sharpening and {{it has the potential to}} operate at high and low temperatures using a suitable choice of piezoelectric material.

40|$|A compact {{sampling}} tool {{mechanism that}} can operate at various temperatures, and transport and sieve particle sizes of <b>powdered</b> <b>cuttings</b> and soil grains with no moving parts, {{has been created}} using traveling surface acoustic waves (SAWs) that are emitted by an inter-digital transducer (IDT). The generated waves are driven at about 10 MHz, and it causes powder to move towards the IDT at high speed with different speeds for different sizes of particles, which enables these particles to be sieved. This design {{is based on the}} use of SAWs and their propelling effect on powder particles and fluids along the path of the waves. Generally, SAWs are elastic waves propagating in a shallow layer of about one wavelength beneath the surface of a solid substrate. To generate SAWs, a piezoelectric plate is used that is made of LiNbO 3 crystal cut along the x-axis with rotation of 127. 8 along the y-axis. On this plate are printed pairs of fingerlike electrodes {{in the form of a}} grating that are activated by subjecting the gap between the electrodes to electric field. This configuration of a surface wave transmitter is called IDT. The IDT that was used consists of 20 pairs of fingers with 0. 4 -mm spacing, a total length of 12. 5 mm. The surface wave is produced by the nature of piezoelectric material to contract or expand when subjected to an electric field. Driving the IDT to generate wave at high amplitudes provides an actuation mechanism where the surface particles move elliptically, pulling powder particles on the surface toward the wavesource and pushing liquids in the opposite direction. This behavior allows the innovation to separate large particles and fluids that are mixed. Fluids are removed at speed (7. 5 to 15 cm/s), enabling this innovation of acting as a bladeless wiper for raindrops. For the windshield design, the electrodes could be made transparent so that they do not disturb the driver or pilot. Multiple IDTs can be synchronized to transport water or powder over larger distances. To demonstrate the transporting action, a video camera was used to record the movement. The speed of particles was measured from the video images...|$|R

40|$|This {{innovation}} comprises {{a compact}} drill that uses low-axial preload, via vibrations, that fractures the rock under the bit kerf, and rotates the bit {{to remove the}} <b>powdered</b> <b>cuttings</b> while augmenting the rock fracture via shear forces. The vibrations fluidize the powered cuttings inside the flutes around the bit, reducing the friction with the auger surface. These combined actions reduce the consumed power and the heating of the drilled medium, helping to preserve the pristine content of the produced samples. The drill consists of an actuator that simultaneously impacts and rotates the bit by applying force and torque via a single piezoelectric stack actuator {{without the need for}} a gearbox or lever mechanism. This reduces the development/fabrication cost and complexity. The piezoelectric actuator impacts the surface and generates shear forces, fragmenting the drilled medium directly under the bit kerf by exceeding the tensile and/or shear strength of the struck surface. The percussive impact action of the actuator leads to penetration of the medium by producing a zone of finely crushed rock directly underneath the struck location. This fracturing process is highly enhanced by the shear forces from the rotation and twisting action. To remove the formed cuttings, the bit is constructed with an auger on its internal or external surface. One of the problems with pure hammering is that, as the teeth become embedded in the sample, the drilling efficiency drops unless the teeth are moved away from the specific footprint location. By rotating the teeth, they are moved to areas that were not fragmented, and thus the rock fracturing is enhanced via shear forces. The shear motion creates ripping or chiseling action to produce larger fragments to increase the drilling efficiency, and to reduce the required power. The actuator of the drill consists of a piezoelectric stack that vibrates the horn. The stack is compressed by a bolt between the backing and the horn in order to prevent it from being subjected to tensile stress that will cause it to fail. The backing is intended to transfer the generated mechanical vibrations towards the horn. In order to cause rotation, the horn is configured asymmetrically with helical segments and, upon impacting the bit, it introduces longitudinal along the axis of the actuator and tangential force causing twisting action that rotates the bit. The longitudinal component of the vibrations of the stack introduces percussion impulses between the bit and the rock to fracture it when the ultimate strain is exceeded under the bit...|$|R
