40|$|Flight {{tests of}} a propulsion-controlled {{aircraft}} (PCA) system on an F- 15 airplane {{have been conducted}} at the NASA Dryden Flight Research Center. The airplane was flown with all flight <b>control</b> <b>surfaces</b> <b>locked</b> both in the manual throttles-only mode and in an augmented system mode. In the latter mode, pilot thumbwheel commands and aircraft feedback parameters were used to position the throttles. Flight evaluation {{results showed that the}} PCA system can be used to land an airplane that has suffered a major flight control system failure safely. The PCA system was used to recover the F- 15 airplane from a severe upset condition, descend, and land. Pilots from NASA, U. S. Air Force, U. S. Navy, and McDonnell Douglas Aerospace evaluated the PCA system and were favorably impressed with its capability. Manual throttles-only approaches were unsuccessful. This paper describes the PCA system operation and testing. It also presents flight test results and pilot comments...|$|R

On 15 July 1987, a young East German, Thomas Krüger, defected by flying a Zlin Z-42M light aircraft of the Gesellschaft für Sport und Technik (GST - an East German paramilitary training organisation) to RAF Gatow from Schönhagen near Trebbin, in the Teltow-Fläming district of Brandenburg. His first words to the RAF Police were a request for political asylum. He was {{handed over to the}} civil authorities and received West German citizenship. His aircraft, registration DDR-WOH, was dismantled and returned to the East Germans (by road) by RAF station flight personnel, complete with humorous slogans painted on by RAF Airman such as [...] "Wish you were here", [...] "Come back soon" [...] and the flying <b>control</b> <b>surfaces</b> <b>lock</b> bore the message [...] "remove before the next escape".

[...] Because the center of pressure of the trim tab is further away from the axis of rotation of the <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> than the center of pressure of the <b>control</b> <b>surface,</b> the movement generated by the tab can match the movement generated by the <b>control</b> <b>surface.</b> The position of the <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> on its axis will change until the torque from the <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> and the trim surface balance each other.|$|R

40|$|A {{simulation}} {{framework is}} developed {{for assessing the}} effect of <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> inertial loads on hypersonic vehicle response. The framework {{is based on a}} partitioned, time-marching approach in which the fuselage and <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> equations of motion are in-tegrated independently and forces/motion at the interface are exchanged between the two systems at pre-determined time intervals. This approach is advantageous in that it does not require direct coupling of the fuselage and <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> models, and therefore allows for the models to be of dissimilar form. Equations of motion for both the fuselage and <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> are presented and a formulation for coupling the two systems is outlined which includes iterations within each aeroelastic time step. The methodology is applied to a representative hypersonic vehicle elevator <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> model which includes aerother-moelastic effects and is attached to a single degree of freedom oscillator representing the fuselage. Results show that <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> inertial effects lead to a departure of the in-stantaneous <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> lift force by up to a factor of eight with respect to the static value.

40|$|AbstractWith control using {{redundant}} multiple <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> {{arrangement and}} large-deflection drag rudders, a combat flying wing {{has a higher}} probability for <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> failures. Therefore, its flight control system {{must be able to}} reconfigure after such failures. Considering three types of typical <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> failures (lock-in-place (LIP), loss-of-effectiveness (LOE) and float), flight control reconfiguration characteristic and capability of such aircraft types are analyzed. Because of the <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> redundancy, the aircraft using the dynamic inversion flight control law already has a control allocation block. In this paper, its flight control configuration during the above failures is achieved by modifying this block. It is shown that such a reconfigurable flight control design is valid, through numerical simulations of flight attitude control task. Results indicate that, in the circumstances of <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> failures with limited degree and the degradation of the flying quality level, a combat flying wing adopting this flight control reconfiguration approach based on control allocation could guarantee its flight safety and perform some flight combat missions...|$|R
