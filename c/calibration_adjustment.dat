40|$|BACKGROUND:Human milk {{composition}} analysis seems essential to adapt human milk fortification for preterm neonates. The Miris human milk analyzer (HMA), based on mid-infrared methodology, is convenient for a unique determination of macronutrients. However, HMA measurements are not totally comparable with reference methods (RMs). OBJECTIVE:The primary {{aim of this}} study was to compare HMA results with results from biochemical RMs for a large range of protein, fat, and carbohydrate contents and to establish a <b>calibration</b> <b>adjustment.</b> METHODS:Human milk was fractionated in protein, fat, and skim milk by covering large ranges of protein (0 - 3 g/ 100 mL), fat (0 - 8 g/ 100 mL), and carbohydrate (5 - 8 g/ 100 mL). For each macronutrient, a calibration curve was plotted by linear regression using measurements obtained using HMA and RMs. RESULTS:For fat, 53 measurements were performed, and the linear regression equation was HMA = 0. 79 RM + 0. 28 (R(2) = 0. 92). For true protein (29 measurements), the linear regression equation was HMA = 0. 9 RM + 0. 23 (R(2) = 0. 98). For carbohydrate (15 measurements), the linear regression equation was HMA = 0. 59 RM + 1. 86 (R(2) = 0. 95). A homogenization step with a disruptor coupled to a sonication step was necessary to obtain better accuracy of the measurements. Good repeatability (coefficient of variation < 7 %) and reproducibility (coefficient of variation < 17 %) were obtained after <b>calibration</b> <b>adjustment.</b> CONCLUSION:New calibration curves were developed for the Miris HMA, allowing accurate measurements in large ranges of macronutrient content. This is necessary for reliable use of this device in individualizing nutrition for preterm newborns...|$|E

Though the spectral characteristics of both experiments are nearly identical, instrument degradation and altitude differences introduce discrepancies between the two data sets. ERB parameters from these two observing platforms may be combined into a scientifically meaningful data set only after these discrepancies are eliminated. To facilitate {{the creation of a}} long-term ERB data set, comparisons of the ERB 6 experiment irradiances with, and <b>calibration</b> <b>adjustments</b> with respect to, the corresponding ERB 7 irradiances have been performed.

40|$|A {{combination}} of propensity score and <b>calibration</b> <b>adjustment</b> {{is shown to}} reduce bias in volunteer panel Web surveys. In this combination, the design weights are adjusted by propensity scores to correct for selection bias due to nonrandomized sampling. These adjusted weights are then calibrated to control totals for the target population and correct for coverage bias. The final set of weights is com-prised of multiple components, and the estimator of a total no longer takes a linear form. Therefore, approximate methods are needed to derive variance esti-mates. This study compares three variance estimation methods through simula-tion. The first method resembles what is used in commercial statistical software based on squared residuals. The second approach uses a variance estimator ori-ginally derived for the generalized regression estimator. The third method uses jackknife replication.

The CW rangefinder’s central wavelength is 690 nm and features very high precision, with manufacturer-claimed 1 -sigma distance noise estimates at 10 m of 0. 1 mm and 0. 3 mm for 80 % and 20 % reflectivity, respectively.

40|$|To {{improve the}} {{positioning}} accuracy of circular scanning airborne laser bathymetry system, a calibration method {{is presented in}} this paper. When the laser points are collected by the bathymetry system on the level area, they {{should be on the}} same plane. However, they are not coplanar because of systematic error and random error. So we try to fit the points to a plane, which may help to adjust the errors and then correct the point location. Firstly, the circular scanning airborne laser bathymetry positioning model is derived in the simple mode. The intersection of laser line and sea surface is simulated depending on the mathematical principles of line and plane intersection. Combined with the direction vector of laser line in the water got by the refraction principle, the sea floor plane mathematical equation is used to compute the location of the laser points. Then, the parameter weighted least squares adjustment model is derived with the prior variance introduced, which lays the foundation for the following computing of calibration model.

To achieve this, we developed and demonstrated a multilaboratory combined proficiency testing and analytical method quality-assurance system as an approach to evaluate and improve the analytical performance of methods. A set of modified milks was developed and optimized to serve multiple purposes (i. e., proficiency testing, quality-assurance and method improvement, and to provide reference materials for calibration of secondary testing methods).

An annual meeting of the laboratory technicians allows for review of results and discussion of each method and provides a forum for communication of experience and techniques that are of value to new analysts in the group.

Usually, locally available time interval counters are {{used to measure the}} offset t 0 between the 1 PPS signal representing the local time scale and the signal that is connected to the traveling receiver in each visited laboratory. In each time-interval counter, a distinct error for time-interval measurement shows up.

40|$|Sample weight calibration, also {{referred}} to as calibration estimation, is a widely applied technique in the analysis of survey data. This method borrows strength from a set of auxiliary variables and can produce weighted estimates with smaller mean square errors than those estimators that do not use the <b>calibration</b> <b>adjustments.</b> Poststratification is a well-known calibration method that forces weighted counts within cells generated by cross-classifying the categorical (or categorized) auxiliary variables to equal the corresponding population control totals. Several assumptions are critical to the theory developed to date for weight calibration. Two assumptions relevant to this research include: (i) the control totals calculated from the population of interest and known without (sampling) error; and (ii) the sample units selected for the survey are taken from a sampling frame that completely covers the population of interest (e. g., no problems with frame undercoverage).

40|$|The {{estimate}} of price change for an elementary cell of the U. S. CPI is a weighted average of quote-level price changes, where the quote-level weight {{is a function}} of inverse selection probabilities at each stage of selection. This paper evaluates, by means of retrospective estimation, two alternative weighting schemes employing calibration. The theory behind this calibration approach is that the sum of the weights of each “usable ” quote in each elementary cell should yield an {{estimate of}} the expenditure for the elementary cell. The CPI produces two distinct estimates of elementary item-area expenditure: (i) that derived from the sum of Commodities and Services (C&S) expenditures reported in the Telephone Point of Purchase Survey (TPOPS), and (ii) that derived from Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX) biennial data. The first, more limited, weighting scheme ratio-adjusts TPOPS expenditure estimates in each stratum-PSUreplicate panel to be proportionate to their substratum component, or Entry-Level Item (ELI), selection probabilities. The second <b>calibration</b> <b>adjustment</b> forces quote weights in any given month to sum to biennial expenditure estimates from the CEX. In Section 1 we provide further background on the CPI and price relative estimation. In Section 2 we describe the two calibration formulas and present their rationales.

The {{emphasis is on the}} electrically self calibrating cavity radiometer, channel 10 c, which recorded accurate total solar irradiance measurements over the whole period. The spectral channels did not have inflight <b>calibration</b> <b>adjustment</b> capabilities.

Over this period, KPOL has incurred many episodes of calibration and {{antenna pointing angle}} uncertainty. To address these issues, the TSVO has applied the Relative <b>Calibration</b> <b>Adjustment</b> (RCA) technique to eight years of KPOL radar data to produce Ground Validation (GV) Version 7 products. This application has significantly improved stability in KPOL reflectivity distributions needed for Probability Matching Method (PMM) rain rate estimation and for comparisons to the TRMM Precipitation Radar (PR). In years with significant calibration and angle corrections, the statistical improvement in PMM distributions is dramatic. The intent {{of this paper is}} to show improved stability in corrected KPOL reflectivity distributions by using the PR as a stable reference. Inter-month fluctuations in mean reflectivity differences between the PR and corrected KPOL are on the order of 1 - 2 dB, and inter-year mean reflectivity differences fluctuate by approximately 1 dB. This represents a marked improvement in stability with confidence comparable to the established calibration and uncertainty boundaries of the PR. The practical application of the RCA method has salvaged eight years of radar data that would have otherwise been unusable, and has made possible a high-quality database of tropical ocean-based reflectivity measurements and precipitation estimates for the research community...|$|E
