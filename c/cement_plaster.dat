5|$|The Maya {{built their}} cities with Neolithic technology; they built their {{structures}} from both perishable materials and from stone. The exact type of stone used in masonry construction varied according to locally available resources, and this also affected the building style. Across a broad swathe of the Maya area, limestone was immediately available. The local limestone is relatively soft when freshly cut, but hardens with exposure. There was great variety {{in the quality}} of limestone, with good-quality stone available in the Usumacinta region; in the northern Yucatán, the limestone used in construction was of relatively poor quality. Volcanic tuff was used at Copán, and nearby Quiriguá employed sandstone. In Comalcalco, where suitable stone was not available locally, fired bricks were employed. Limestone was burned at high temperatures in order to manufacture <b>cement,</b> <b>plaster,</b> and stucco. Lime-based cement was used to seal stonework in place, and stone blocks were fashioned using rope-and-water abrasion, and with obsidian tools. The Maya did not employ a functional wheel, so all loads were transported on litters, barges, or rolled on logs. Heavy loads were lifted with rope, but probably without employing pulleys.|$|E
5|$|Owing to {{the effect}} of {{prevailing}} winds and rains on the walls, the mosque has needed several renovations and restoration work which over the years have altered some of its exterior designs. In September 2002, a severe storm destroyed the mihrab and the minaret. As a result, the World Monuments Fund (WMF) placed the mosque on the 2002 World Monuments Watch, also considering the damage sustained after the inappropriate restoration in the 1970s. The Ghana Museums and Monuments Board decided to restore the mosque and sought advice from CRAterre, an architectural firm based in Grenoble, France which has expertise in building earthen structures. The renovation work was supported by a WMF, with a grant fund of US$50,000 from American Express. The local community also provided support. The conservation process involved removal of the earlier <b>cement</b> <b>plaster</b> from the surfaces of the mosque, the wooden structural components were replaced, the minaret and the mihrab were reconstructed, the portal was redone, and the interior and exterior surfaces were plastered in the traditional way. The renovation resulted in reassessing the state of conservation of the site, involving a team of local artisans and labourers. It helped to restore the monument with special emphasis on reviving the knowledge of mud-plaster maintenance.|$|E
25|$|Under wind, {{atmospheric}} pollutants {{move in a}} north and northeasterly direction, and in times of low winds or moderate winds, are more evenly distributed over the city. The most polluting industrial processes in the city are ammonium sulfate, <b>cement,</b> <b>plaster</b> and paper pulp. The emission of gases from motor vehicle traffic is more critical in the central district, {{where much of the}} business is. The main source of air pollution is from the vehicles at 34% and then industry with 18%. The pollutants emitted by vehicles are carbon monoxide (89.12%), sulfur dioxide (0.23%), hydrocarbons (6.46%), oxides of nitrogen (3.82%) and other particles (0. 37%). To help remedy this problem, several state enterprises and private sector have supported a project to convert liquid fuel vehicles to natural gas. Furthermore, the city has installed more than 12 service stations catering to natural gas vehicles. Barranquilla is the fourth biggest atmospheric polluter from industry. According to research conducted by the Institute of Hydrology, Meteorology and Environmental Studies of Colombia (IDEAM), monthly concentrations in Barranquilla of particulate matter smaller than 160 micrograms per cubic meter exceeds the highest international standard allowed of 70. The causes of this problem lie heavily on the poor quality of petrol and diesel used by vehicles of the city, with record levels of 5,000 ppm (parts per million sulfur) and 4,500 ppm respectively, when there are countries whose rates do not even exceed 50.|$|E

50|$|In 1952 and 1953 the two side porticos to {{the church}} were constructed. In 1954 the church was given a {{suitable}} frontage by constructing steps and side porticos {{for the protection of}} the doors. At the same time the statues inside the church were painted. In 1956, the church flooring, the presbytery (lower) portion, the kitchen and the passages were <b>cement</b> <b>plastered</b> at the cost of Rs. 4000. On 28 September 1968 three roofs around the sanctuary of the church were repaired introducing new raptors and reapers.|$|R
25|$|A short {{distance}} past {{the church is}} Nutgrove Avenue, widened and extended during the 1960s to link up with Churchtown. The old quiet tree shaded avenue has been completely swept away, along with the narrow lanes a cramped passage bounded on both sides by towering walls and full of right angled bends, which wended its crooked course between Loreto Convent cemetery and the garden of Nutgrove House. A massive gateway stood {{at the entrance to}} this avenue until about 1911, which bore the inscription Nutgrove School Established 1802. In 1839 the school was under the supervision of Mr. Philip Jones, who continued to hold the post of principal until 1866 when the position was held by Mrs. Anne Jones. In 1876 the school closed down and the house was occupied as a private residence by various tenants down to recent years becoming the parish councilheadquarters. The new avenue was laid through the former school grounds and the house, shorn of its ornamental gardens, stood with its front against the footpath. At some time the house had been disfigured with a rather unsightly concrete porch and the old brickwork covered with <b>cement</b> <b>plaster,</b> concealing {{the fact that this was}} a very interesting eighteenth century building containing a fine stairs and coved ceilings with good plaster decoration. Unfortunately the house fell into very bad repair and eventually was demolished. Joyce in his Neighbourhood of Dublin states that this house was at one time the dower house of Rathfarnham Castle but in this he is almost certainly mistaken, as Frizell's map of 1779 shows that it was outside the estate. It is possible that he confused it with the other old house on the opposite side of the avenue which was formerly named Ely Cottage, later altered to Ely Lodge, and which was shown to be within the boundary of the estate. This house was in very bad repair but has recently been restored in a very tasteful manner.|$|E

Several tests were conducted on <b>cement</b> <b>plasters</b> formed by the replacement of aggregate with GAP industrial waste in a range of 0 - 20 %. Outcomes of the study revealed approximately 37 % decrease in strength properties depending on the percentage replacement of the GAP waste powder. The recorded decrease could play the role of an enhancer towards the durability of the specimen and as such, shows good potential for use...|$|R

40|$|The California {{wild rice}} (Zizania aquatica) {{industry}} considers red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) {{their most important}} pest problem. Farmers often have asked if crop-damaging blackbirds can be killed by mixing dry Portland cement or plaster-of-Paris with grain bait. We {{conducted a series of}} tests to determine the effect of <b>cement</b> or <b>plaster</b> mixed with wild rice fed to captive redwings and to determine feeding preferences of redwings for wild rice in relation to other grains. Birds would not eat cement- or plaster-treated rice when untreated rice was available and no mortality occurred when birds were offered only treated rice over a four-day period. Thus, treating grain with <b>cement</b> or <b>plaster</b> will not kill redwings but <b>cement</b> or <b>plaster</b> might serve as useful bird repellents for seed grain. Proso millet was strongly preferred over wild rice by redwings, indicating millet would be an excellent candidate as a lure crop and as a bait for trapping or for delivering a chemical. Sunflower would perhaps not be a preferred bait or lure crop in wild rice areas and cracked corn would not be a preferred bait...|$|R

Experimental investigations reveal that adding cellulosic fibers reduces composites density (up to 8. 2 %) in comparison with composites without any fibers. Moreover, the presence of wood pulp and recycled fibers in composites cause higher values of water absorbability than sample without fibers. Also, the decrease in compressive strength values for tested fiber <b>cement</b> <b>plasters</b> was observed (14. 1 - 18. 0 MPa) in comparison to reference sample (26. 6 MPa).

Species abundance was measured for one year, and clear seasonal and aseasonal groups of species were established. Macro-environmental data were reported, including soil characteristics, rainfall, rainfall variability and pH, both soil and surface runoff. While the crusts appeared to be fairly stable, except at typhoon intensities, further work is needed to establish degrees of temporal and spatial variation.
