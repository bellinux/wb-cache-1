40|$|DE 10108397 C UPAB: 20020621 NOVELTY - The {{cleaning}} method uses an elongate flexible <b>cleaning</b> <b>roller</b> (3) extending {{across the}} outer surface (1) of the free-standing structure (2) and displaced {{relative to the}} latter during the cleaning movement, with simultaneous application of tension in a direction perpendicular to the relative movement. The <b>cleaning</b> <b>roller</b> may be held under tension between a pair of winding devices (6, 7) mounted on respective vehicles (5 a, 5 b) used for the displacement relative to the outer surface of the free-standing structure. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM for a device for cleaning the outer surface of a free-standing structure is also included. USE - The method is used for cleaning the outside surface of a free-standing structure, e. g. a concert hall. ADVANTAGE - The cleaning method is suitable for free-standing structures of varying outer geometry...|$|E
50|$|Also, dye-sublimation {{papers and}} ribbons are {{sensitive}} to skin oils, which interfere with the dye's ability to sublimate from the ribbon to the paper. They must also be free of dust particles, {{which can lead to}} small colored blobs appearing on the prints. Most dye-sublimation printers have filters and/or <b>cleaning</b> <b>rollers</b> to reduce the likelihood of this happening, and a speck of dust can only affect one print as it becomes attached to the print during the printing process. Finally, dye-sublimation printers fall short when producing neutral and toned black-and-white prints with higher density levels and virtually no metamerism or bronzing.|$|R

50|$|A Sugarbeet {{harvester}} is {{an agricultural}} machine for harvesting sugar beet. The first machines were pulled by a tractor {{and only one}} row could be lifted. Modern self-propelled sugarbeet harvesters have predominantly 6-row harvesting units. The beets are lifted from the ground by lifting shares. Through <b>cleaning</b> <b>rollers,</b> the transfer web and the discharge elevator, the beets are separated from the adhering soil and transported into the holding tank of the machine. The beets are placed {{on the edge of}} the field in storage clamps or overloaded on a transport vehicle during harvesting. The leaves of the beets are removed. They remain for fertilization in the field or can be used as animal food for cattle, the leaves can be fed fresh or as silage.|$|R
40|$|The {{extensive}} use of multiple organic solvents in offset lithographic printing causing high emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) indeed poses a serious risk to printing workers' health. In this study, indoor air quality (IAQ) assessments were carried out in seven printing plants and the main objectives were to understand the effect of VOC emissions on IAQ and develop effective mitigation measures to protect workers. The thorough gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) measurements showed that although a variety of VOCs were presented in the indoor air, {{none of them was}} found close to individual 8 -h time-weighted average (TWA) of the occupational exposure limit (OEL). The additive effect was also found below the critical value of unity. However, short-term personal exposure to total volatile organic compounds (TVOCs) was exceedingly high when a print worker carried out blanket and ink <b>roller</b> <b>cleaning</b> procedures. Therefore, the occupational health risk was mainly due to repeated short-term exposures during intermittent VOC-emitting procedures rather than long-term exposure to background VOCs. Push-pull local exhaust ventilation (LEV) was identified as an effective mitigation measure. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis was conducted to study the push-pull LEV operation. It was found that there existed a threshold LEV air flow rate for an abrupt reduction in the worker's exposure to VOCs. The reduction was less sensitive when the LEV airflow was further increased beyond the threshold. These phenomena, consistent with experimental results reported by other investigators, were explained by detailed CFD analysis showing the competition between the general ventilation and the push-pull LEV to become the dominating driving force for the resultant local flow pattern. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
