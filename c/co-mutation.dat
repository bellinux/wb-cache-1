40|$|Background and {{objective}} Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene (KRAS) mutation {{is one of}} the major driver genes of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). KRAS is a resistant predictor of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs), which raises controversy because of its role in chemotherapy sensitivity and prognosis. The aim of this study is to accumulate clinical experience in treating NSCLC patients harboring KRAS mutation. Methods A total of 107 NSCLC patients harboring KRAS mutation were analyzed retrospectively. The efficacy was analyzed in terms of first-line chemotherapy or EGFR-TKIs therapy. Results The objective response rate (ORR) to first-line chemotherapy of 52 patients with advanced disease harboring KRAS mutation was 9. 6 %. The disease control rate (DCR) was 53. 8 %, and the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 3 months. The ORR to EGFR-TKIs therapy in 21 patients harboring KRAS mutation and EGFR/KRAS <b>co-mutation</b> was 9. 5 %; the DCR was 23. 8 %, and the median PFS was 1 month. The ORR and DCR to EGFR-TKIs therapy of patients with EGFR/KRAS <b>co-mutation</b> were significantly higher than those of patients with KRAS mutation (50 % vs 0, P= 0. 029; 75 % vs 11. 8 %, P= 0. 043); the median PFS was also significantly longer (3 months vs 1 month, P= 0. 004). Conclusion The efficacy to first-line chemotherapy and EGFR-TKIs therapy in NSCLC patients harboring KRAS mutation was poor; thus, new drugs should be developed. Furthermore, the existence of EGFR/KRAS <b>co-mutation</b> was confirmed. Hence, EGFR-TKIs therapy should be administered to patients with EGFR/KRAS <b>co-mutation...</b>|$|E
40|$|Motivation: Cancers {{are caused}} by an {{accumulation}} of multiple independent mutations that collectively deregulate cellular pathways, e. g. such as those regulating cell division and cell-death. The publicly available Retroviral Tagged Cancer Gene Database (RTCGD) contains the data of many insertional mutagenesis screens, in which the virally induced mutations result in tumor formation in mice. The insertion loci therefore indicate the location of putative cancer genes. Additionally, the presence of multiple independent insertions within one tumor hints towards a cooperation between the insertionally mutated genes. In this study {{we focus on the}} detection of statistically significant <b>co-mutations.</b> Results: We propose a two-dimensional Gaussian Kernel Convolution method (2 DGKC), a computational technique that identifies the cooperating mutations in insertional mutagenesis data. We define the Common Co-occurrence of Insertions (CCI), signifying the <b>co-mutations</b> that are statistically significant across all different screens in the RTCGD. Significance estimates are made on multiple scales, and the results visualized in a scale space, thereby providing valuable extra information on the putative cooperation. The multidimensional analysis of the insertion data results in the discovery of 86 statistically significant <b>co-mutations,</b> indicating the presence of cooperating oncogenes that play a role in tumor development. Since oncogenes may cooperate with several members of a parallel pathway, we combined the co-occurrence data with gene family information to find significant cooperations between oncogenes and families of genes. We show, for instance, the interchangeable cooperation of Myc insertions with insertions in the Pim family. MediamaticsElectrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Scienc...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{functional}} {{significance of}} the Pvt 1 locus in the oncogenesis of Burkitt's lymphoma and plasmacytomas has remained a puzzle. In these tumors, Pvt 1 {{is the site of}} reciprocal translocations to immunoglobulin loci. Although the locus encodes a number of alternative transcripts, no protein or regulatory RNA products were found. The recent identification of non-coding microRNAs encoded within the PVT 1 region has suggested a regulatory role for this locus. Results The mouse Pvt 1 locus encodes several microRNAs. In mouse T cell lymphomas induced by retroviral insertions into the locus, the Pvt 1 transcripts, and at least one of their microRNA products, mmu-miR- 1204 are overexpressed. Whereas up to seven <b>co-mutations</b> {{can be found in a}} single tumor, in over 2, 000 tumors none had insertions into both the Myc and Pvt 1 loci. Conclusion Judging from the large number of integrations into the Pvt 1 locus – more than in the nearby Myc locus – Pvt 1 and the microRNAs encoded by it are as important as Myc in T lymphomagenesis, and, presumably, in T cell activation. An analysis of the <b>co-mutations</b> in the lymphomas likely place Pvt 1 and Myc into the same pathway. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{influenza}} A viruses {{have three}} gene segments, M, NS, and PB 1, which code {{for more than}} one protein. The overlapping genes from the same segment entail their interdependence, which could be reflected in the evolutionary constraints, host distinction, and <b>co-mutations</b> of influenza. Most previous studies of overlapping genes focused on their unique evolutionary constraints, and very little was achieved to assess the potential impact of the overlap on other biological aspects of influenza. In this study, our aim was to explore the mutual dependence in host differentiation and <b>co-mutations</b> in M, NS, and PB 1 of avian, human, 2009 H 1 N 1, and swine viruses, with Random Forests, information entropy, and mutual information. The host markers and highly co-mutated individual sites and site pairs (P values < 0. 035) in the three gene segments were identified with their relative significance between the overlapping genes calculated. Further, Random Forests predicted that among the three stop codons in the current PB 1 -F 2 gene of 2009 H 1 N 1, the significance of a mutation at these sites for host differentiation was, in order from most to least, that at 12, 58, and 88, i. e., the closer {{to the start of the}} gene the more important the mutation was. Finally, our sequence analysis surprisingly revealed that the full-length PB 1 -F 2, if the three stop codons were all mutated, would function more as a swine protein than a human protein, although the PB 1 of 2009 H 1 N 1 was derived from human H 3 N 2...|$|R
40|$|Evolutionary {{information}} stored in multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) {{has been used}} to identify the interaction interface of protein complexes, by measuring either co-conservation or <b>co-mutation</b> of amino acid residues across the interface. Recently, maximum entropy related correlated mutation measures (CMMs) such as direct information, decoupling direct from indirect interactions, have been developed to identify residue pairs interacting across the protein complex interface. These studies have focussed on carefully selected protein complexes with large, good-quality MSAs. In this work, we study protein complexes with a more typical MSA consisting of fewer than 400 sequences, using a set of 79 intramolecular protein complexes. Using a maximum entropy based CMM at the residue level, we develop an interface level CMM score to be used in re-ranking docking decoys. We demonstrate that our interface level CMM score compares favourably to the complementarity trace score, an evolutionary information-based score measuring co-conservation, when combined with the number of interface residues, a knowledge-based potential and the variability score of individual amino acid sites. We also demonstrate, that, since <b>co-mutation</b> and co-complementarity in the MSA contain orthogonal information, the best prediction performance using evolutionary information can be achieved by combining the <b>co-mutation</b> information of the CMM with co-conservation information of a complementarity trace score, predicting a near-native structure as the top prediction for 41 % of the dataset. The method presented is not restricted to small MSAs, and will likely improve interface prediction also for complexes with large and good-quality MSAs...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The human immune {{proteins}} APOBEC 3 G and APOBEC 3 F (hA 3 G and hA 3 F) induce destructive G-to-A {{changes in}} the HIV genome, referred to as ‘hypermutation’. These two proteins co-express in human cells, co-localize to mRNA processing bodies and might co-package into HIV virions. Therefore {{they are expected to}} also co-mutate the HIV genome. Here we investigate the mutational footprints of hA 3 G and hA 3 F in a large population of full genome HIV- 1 sequences from naturally infected patients to uniquely identify sequences hypermutated by either or both of these proteins. We develop a method of identification based on the representation of hA 3 G and hA 3 F target and product motifs that does not require an alignment to a parental/consensus sequence. Results Out of nearly 100 hypermutated HIV- 1 sequences only one sequence from the HIV- 1 outlier group showed clear signatures of <b>co-mutation</b> by both proteins. The remaining sequences were affected by either hA 3 G or hA 3 F. Conclusion Using a novel method of identification of HIV sequences hypermutated by the hA 3 G and hA 3 F enzymes, we report a very low rate of <b>co-mutation</b> of full-length HIV sequences, and discuss the potential mechanisms underlying this. </p...|$|E

In {{order to understand the}} impact of genetic heterogeneity on acquired resistance and second line therapy selection in metastatic melanoma, we sequenced the exomes of 27 lesions which were collected from 3 metastatic melanoma patients treated with targeted or non-targeted inhibitors. Furthermore, we tested the impact of a second NRAS mutation in 7 BRAF inhibitor resistant early passage cell cultures on the selection of second line therapies. We observed a rapid monophyletic evolution of melanoma subpopulations in response to targeted therapy that was not observed in non-targeted therapy. We observed the acquisition of NRAS mutations in the BRAF mutated patient treated with a BRAF inhibitor in 1 of 5 of his post-resistant samples. In an additional cohort of 5 BRAF-inhibitor treated patients we detected 7 NRAS mutations in 18 post-resistant samples. No NRAS mutations were detected in pre-resistant samples. By sequencing 65 single cell clones we prove that NRAS mutations co-occur with BRAF mutations in single cells. The double mutated cells revealed a heterogeneous response to MEK, ERK, PI 3 K, AKT and multi RTK - inhibitors. We conclude that BRAF and NRAS <b>co-mutations</b> are not mutually exclusive. However, the sole finding of double mutated cells in a resistant tumor is not sufficient to determine follow-up therapy. In order to target the large pool of heterogeneous cells in a patient, we think combinational therapy targeting different pathways will be necessary...|$|R

The new virus first emerged in Mexico in April, 2009 {{was identified as}} a unique combination of a triple- reassortant swine influenza A virus, composed of genetic information from pigs, hu- mans, birds, and a Eurasian swine influenza virus. Several recent studies on the 2009 H 1 N 1 virus util-ized small datasets to conduct analysis. With new sequences available up to date, we were able to extend the previous research in three areas. The first was finding two networks of <b>co-mutations</b> that may po-tentially affect the current flu-drug binding sites on neuraminidase (NA), one of the two surface proteins of flu virus. The second was discovering a special stalk motif, which was dominant in the H 5 N 1 strains in the past, in the 2009 H 1 N 1 strains for the first time. Due to the high virulence of this motif, the second finding is significant in our current research on 2009 H 1 N 1. The third was updating the phylogenetic an- alysis of current NA sequences of 2009 H 1 N 1 and H 5 N 1, which demonstrated that, in clear contrast to previous findings, the N 1 sequences in 2009 are di-verse enough to cover different major branches of the phylogenetic tree of those in previous years.

40|$|Amino acid substitutions {{have been}} {{identified}} in the influenza A virus nucleoprotein that are associated with escape from recognition by virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs).

Here, the effect on viral fitness of four other co-mutations associated with R 384 G was investigated by using plasmid-driven rescue of mutant viruses. Whilst none of these alternative co-mutations alone compensated functionally for the detrimental effect of the R 384 G substitution, the M 239 V substitution improved viral fitness of viruses containing 375 G and 384 R.

The cell of origin, relation to serous ovarian tumour and {{the pathogenesis of}} these neoplasms are not fully established. METHODS AND RESULTS As low grade serous ovarian neoplasms are known to harbour mutations in the MAP-kinase pathway, we investigated the involvement of BRAF and KRAS mutations in low grade testicular serous tumour by way of mutational analysis of 7 cases. Mutational analysis was performed by melting curve analysis followed by bidirectional sequencing. Our findings showed BRAF and/or KRAS mutation in 3 of the 7 cases, similar to the proportions reported in low grade ovarian serous neoplasms. Out of these three cases, one showed <b>co-mutation</b> of BRAF and KRAS.

This prospective study was a multicenter project conducted in Taiwan for assessment of lung adenocarcinoma genetic tests. Five oncogenic drivers, including EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, HER 2 and EML 4 -ALK fusion mutations, were tested. EGFR, KRAS, BRAF and HER 2 mutations were assessed by MALDI-TOF MS (Cohort 1). EML 4 -ALK translocation was tested by Ventana method in EGFR-wild type patients (Cohort 2). From August 2011 to November 2013, a total of 1772 patients with lung adenocarcinoma were enrolled. In Cohort 1 analysis, EGFR, KRAS, HER 2 and BRAF mutations were identified in 987 (55. 7 %), 93 (5. 2 %), 36 (2. 0 %) and 12 (0. 7 %) patients, respectively. Most of these mutations were mutually exclusive, except for <b>co-mutations</b> in seven patients (3 with EGFR + KRAS, 3 with EGFR + HER 2 and 1 with KRAS + BRAF). In Cohort 2 analysis, 29 of 295 EGFR-wild type patients (9. 8 %) were positive for EML 4 -ALK translocation. EGFR mutations were more common in female patients and non-smokers and KRAS mutations were more common in male patients and smokers. Gender and smoking status were not correlated significantly with HER 2, BRAF and EML 4 -ALK mutations. EML 4 -ALK translocation was more common in patients with younger age. This was the first study in Taiwan to explore the incidence of five oncogenic drivers in patients with lung adenocarcinoma and the results could be valuable for physicians in consideration of targeted therapy and inclusion of clinical trials...|$|R
40|$|Abstract : Cellular {{immunity}} {{plays an}} important role in the control of viral infections, including those caused by influenza viruses. However, viruses can exploit a variety of strategies to evade cellular immunity, like the accumulation of amino acid substitutions in CTL epitopes. It was unclear to what extent these amino acid substitutions affect the influenza virus-specific CTL response. In this thesis, this issue was addressed by assessing the effect of the loss of immunodominant epitopes on the human influenza A virus-specific CTL response in vitro. To this end, recombinant influenza viruses with and without the HLA-B* 2705 -restricted epitope NP 383 - 391 or the HLA-B* 3501 -restricted epitope NP 418 - 426 were generated, which were used to induce IFN-gamma production or lytic activity in clonal and polyclonal virus-specific CD 8 + T-cell populations (chapter 2 and 7). During this study, it was found that recombinant influenza viruses with a single amino acid substitution at! position 384 of the NP (R 384 G) could not be rescued. We hypothesized that one or more <b>co-mutations</b> were required to compensate for the detrimental effect of the R 384 G mutation, which is described in chapters 3 and 4. In line with these results, we hypothesized that influenza A viruses need to overcome functional constraints to accumulate mutations in CTL epitopes and escape from CTL. The inability to overcome these functional constraints may explain the highly conserved nature of most identified influenza A virus CTL epitopes, limiting escape from CTL. To assess the impact of amino acid substitutions in conserved epitopes on viral fitness and recognition by specific CTL, we performed a mutational analysis of CTL epitopes (chapter 5). Since examples of evading mutations in influenza A virus CTL epitopes are limited, we assessed the extent of variation in CTL epitopes using virus-specific CD 8 + T-cell clones (chapter 6). In addition to CD 8 + T-cell clones, we also observed CD 4 ! + T-cell clones that recognized a variable epitope. To date, no evadin g activities from CD 4 + T-cells have been described in influenza virus infection. The variable CD 4 + T-cell epitope was located and the amino acid substitution responsible for abrogation of CD 4 + T-cell recognition was identified (chapter 8). The studies described in this thesis are discussed in the light of evasion of influenza A virus from human T-cell immunity...|$|R
40|$|The phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI 3 K) pathway is {{the most}} {{frequently}} activated pathway across multiple tumor lineages {{and this is a}} potential therapeutic target. As a critical step to accelerate therapeutic development in endometrial cancer, we performed a comprehensive analysis of mutation and function of PI 3 K pathway members in a set of 243 highly characterized endometrial tumors. Whole gene resequencing revealed the highest frequencies of mutation in the PI 3 K pathway of any tumor lineage including PTEN (44 %), PIK 3 CA (40 %; encoding the p 110 α catalytic subunit of PI 3 K) and PIK 3 R 1 (20 %; encoding the p 85 a regulatory subunit). Indeed, when complete protein loss is considered, almost 80 % of endometrioid endometrial cancers demonstrate an aberration in the PI 3 K pathway. Remarkably, mutations in the PI 3 K pathway were not mutually exclusive and indeed co-existence of PIK 3 CA or PIK 3 R 1 mutation with heterozygous PTEN mutation occurred at frequencies higher than predicted by the frequency of each lesion alone. High-throughput reverse-phase protein array suggested that the dominant signaling effects occurred with PTEN protein loss and that PIK 3 CA or PIK 3 R 1 mutation functionally mimic PTEN protein loss as indicated by protein markers including phosphorylated Akt and stathmin. Thus it appears likely that <b>co-mutations</b> in the PI 3 K pathway are selected to compensate haploinsufficiency of PTEN due to PTEN heterozygous mutation. To determine the functional consequences of mutations in PIK 3 R 1, we demonstrated that several somatic PIK 3 R 1 mutations tested conferred cytokine-independent growth on interleukin- 3 -dependent Ba/F 3 cells and induced Akt phosphorylation in endometrial cancer cell lines indicating that they were gain of function mutations likely acting as oncogenes. Strikingly two of the gain of function mutations (E 160 * and R 348 *) lacked the ability to bind to the p 110 catalytic subunit and E 160 * failed to bind to both p 110 and PTEN. We demonstrate that E 160 * disrupts a novel mechanism of pathway regulation wherein p 85 binds and stabilizes PTEN. Together, the data indicate that the PI 3 K pathway is targeted {{in the vast majority of}} endometrioid endometrial cancers representing a novel opportunity for implementation of targeted therapy...|$|R
40|$|Translocations {{involving}} the mixed lineage leukemia- 1 are recurrent events in acute leukemia and associate with lymphoid (ALL), myeloid (AML) or mixed lineage (MLL) subtypes. Despite an association with ALL in humans, murine MLL fusion models are persistently restricted to AML. We here explored this issue using an inducible mixed lineage leukemia-eleven nineteen leukemia (MLL-ENL) mouse model. Although multiple progenitor cell types with myeloid potential are potent AML leukemia-initiating cells, also the earliest lymphoid progenitors {{were capable of}} initiating AML. This ability to evoke a latent myeloid potential in the earliest lymphoid progenitors was lost upon further lymphoid commitment. At the same time, more downstream/committed lymphoid precursors also failed to initiate lymphoid leukemia. Co-expression of MLL-ENL with a constitutively active RAS allele, the most common <b>co-mutation</b> in MLL fusion leukemias, could influence on both disease latency and lineage assignment of developing leukemia in {{what appears to be}} a mutation-order-dependent manner. Finally, CEBPB-mediated transdifferentation of committed and otherwise leukemia-incompetent B-cell progenitors imbued these cells with leukemic competence for AML. Therefore, apart from providing detailed insight into the differential responsiveness of candidate target cells to a first-hit MLL fusion event, our data warrants caution to therapeutic approaches based on the concept of transdifferentiation.

40|$|The claret (ca) locus in Drosophila encodes {{products}} that are needed both for wild-type eyecolor and for correct meiotic chromosome segregation. Mutants described previously provide evidence that two mutationally independent coding regions are present at ca. We have recovered six new P element-induced and one spontaneous ca mutant. Four of these new mutants affect both eyecolor and chromosome segregation. The high frequency of <b>co-mutation</b> of these two functions suggests that the corresponding genes are closely adjacent to one another. We recovered genomic DNA sequences corresponding to the ca locus by chromosome walking, and showed using revertant analysis that the cloned region encodes ca+. Transformation experiments demonstrate that the mutant effect resulting in meiotic chromosome non-disjunction (nd) and loss is fully rescued by DNA from the cloned region. Two RNAs of 7. 4 and 2. 2 kb have been identified by Northern blot analysis as the putative eyecolor and segregational products. Expression of the RNAs with respect to males and females, and their presence or absence in ca and nd mutants indicate that the 7. 4 kb RNA corresponds to the product needed for wild-type eyecolor and the 2. 2 kb RNA is the product required for normal chromosome segregation. These RNAs are transcribed in opposite directions to one another. Alleles that affect both eyecolor and chromosome segregation are deletion mutants that affect both transcripts. Thus, the putative eyecolor and segregational products are encoded by separate genes.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Pathway {{analysis}} {{of a set of}} genes represents an important area in large-scale omic data analysis. However, the application of traditional pathway enrichment methods to next-generation sequencing (NGS) data is prone to several potential biases, including genomic/genetic factors (e. g., the particular disease and gene length) and environmental factors (e. g., personal life-style and frequency and dosage of exposure to mutagens). Therefore, novel methods are urgently needed for these new data types, especially for individual-specific genome data. METHODOLOGY: In this study, we proposed a novel method for the pathway {{analysis of}} NGS mutation data by explicitly taking into account the gene-wise mutation rate. We estimated the gene-wise mutation rate based on the individual-specific background mutation rate along with the gene length. Taking the mutation rate as a weight for each gene, our weighted resampling strategy builds the null distribution for each pathway while matching the gene length patterns. The empirical P value obtained then provides an adjusted statistical evaluation. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS/CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated our weighted resampling method to a lung adenocarcinomas dataset and a glioblastoma dataset, and compared it to other widely applied methods. By explicitly adjusting gene-length, the weighted resampling method performs as well as the standard methods for significant pathways with strong evidence. Importantly, our method could effectively reject many marginally significant pathways detected by standard methods, including several long-gene-based, cancer-unrelated pathways. We further demonstrated that by reducing such biases, pathway crosstalk for each individual and pathway <b>co-mutation</b> map across multiple individuals can be objectively explored and evaluated. This method performs pathway analysis in a sample-centered fashion, and provides an alternative way for accurate analysis of cancer-personalized genomes. It can be extended to other types of genomic data (genotyping and methylation) that have similar bias problems...|$|E
40|$|How {{proteins}} undergo conformational {{changes to}} bind a ligand {{is one of}} the most fundamental questions of protein biology. MD simulations provide a useful computational tool for studying the theoretical movements of protein in solution on nanosecond timescales. The results of these simulations can be used to guide experimental design. By correlating the theoretical models with the results of experimental studies, we can obtain a significant amount of information about protein dynamics. This study represents the application of both computational and traditional experimental techniques to study protein dynamics in HIV- 1 protease. The results provide a novel mechanism for the conformational changes in proteins and address the role of residues outside the active site in protein dynamics. Additionally, these results are applied to the complex role of non-active site mutations in the development of drug resistance. Chapter II examines an invariant Thr 80 at the apex of the P 1 loop of HIV- 1, HIV- 2, and simian immunodeficiency virus protease. Sequence variability associated with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) is useful for inferring structural and/or functional constraints at specific residues within the viral protease. Positions that are invariant even in the presence of drug selection define critically important residues for protease function. Three protease variants (T 80 V, T 80 N, and T 80 S) were examined for changes in structure, dynamics, enzymatic activity, affinity for protease inhibitors, and viral infectivity. While all three variants were structurally similar to the wild type, only T 80 S was functionally similar. T 80 V significantly decreased the ability of the enzyme to cleave a peptide substrate but maintained infectivity, while T 80 N abolished both activity and viral infectivity. Additionally, T 80 N decreased the conformational flexibility of the flap region, as observed by simulations of molecular dynamics. Taken together, these data indicate that HIV- 1 protease functions best when residue 80 is a small polar residue and that mutations to other amino acids significantly impair enzyme function, possibly by affecting the flexibility of the flap domain. Chapter III focuses on residues within the hydrophobic core of each monomer in HIV- 1 protease. Many hydrophobic residues located in the core of this dimeric enzyme frequently mutate in patients undergoing protease inhibitor therapy. The mechanism by which these mutations aid the development of drug resistance is not well understood. Using MD simulations, this study suggests that the hydrophobic residues outside the active site facilitate the conformational change that occurs in HIV- 1 protease upon binding substrates and inhibitors. In these simulations, the core of each monomer significantly rearranges to assist in the expansion of the active site as hydrophobic core residues slide by each other, exchanging one hydrophobic contact for another. Such hydrophobic sliding may represent a general mechanism by which proteins undergo conformational changes. Mutation of these hydrophobic core residues would alter the packing of the hydrophobic core. Thus, these residues could facilitate drug resistance in HIV- 1 protease by altering dynamic properties of HIV- 1 protease preferentially affecting the relative affinity for inhibitors versus substrates. Chapter IV concentrates on a residue in the flap region, Ile 54, which is significantly correlated with the development of drug resistance. A series of patient sequences containing the mutation I 54 A were evaluated for the most frequently occurring <b>co-mutations.</b> I 54 A was found to occur with mutations that were previously correlated with I 54 V mutations, including L 10 I, G 48 V, and V 82 A. Based on the results of this evaluation, the binding properties of five variant proteases were investigated: MDI 54 V, MDRI 54 A, I 54 V, I 54 A, and G 48 V. MDRI 54 V and MDRI 54 A each contained the mutations L 10 I, G 48 V, and V 82 A, and either I 54 V or I 54 A, respectively. The other variants contained only the mutation indicated. Mutations at Ile 54 were able to significantly impact the thermodynamics of binding to saquinavir, amprenavir, and the recently approved darunavir. The magnitude of this impact depended on the presence or absence of other drug resistance mutations, including another mutation in the flap region, G 48 V. Therefore, while residues 48 and 54 are not in contact with each other, mutations at both sites had a cooperative effect that varies between inhibitors. The results demonstrate that residues outside the active site of HIV- 1 protease are clearly important to enzyme function, possibly through their role in the dynamic properties of protease. Mutations outside the active site of protease that are known to cause drug resistance could alter the conformational flexibility of protease. While the role of protein dynamics in molecular recognition is still not fully understood, the results of this study indicate that altering the dynamic properties of a protein affects its ability to recognize ligands. Therefore, to design better inhibitors we will have to develop a more thorough understanding of protein dynamics...|$|R
40|$|As {{the world}} is closely {{watching}} the current 2009 H 1 N 1 pandemic unfold, {{there is a great}} interest and need in understanding its origin, genetic structures, virulence, and pathogenicity. The two surface proteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), of the influenza virus have been the focus of most flu research due to their crucial biological functions. In our previous study on 2009 H 1 N 1, three aspects of NA were investigated: the mutations and co-mutations, the stalk motifs, and the phylogenetic analysis. In this study, we turned our attention to HA and the interaction between HA and NA. The 118 mutations of 2009 H 1 N 1 HA were found and mapped to the 3 D homology model of H 1, and the mutations on the five epitope regions on H 1 were identified. This information is essential for developing new drugs and vaccine. The distinct response patterns of HA to the changes of NA stalk motifs were discovered, illustrating the functional dependence between HA and NA. With help from our previous results, two <b>co-mutation</b> networks were uncovered, one in HA and one in NA, where each mutation in one network co-mutates with the mutations in the other network across the two proteins HA and NA. These two networks residing in HA and NA separately may provide a functional linkage between the mutations that can impact the drug binding sites in NA and those that can affect the host immune response or vaccine efficacy in HA. Our findings demonstrated the value of conducting timely analysis on the 2009 H 1 N 1 virus and of the integrated approach to studying both surface proteins HA and NA together to reveal their interdependence, which could not be accomplished by studying them individually...|$|E
40|$|RAD 51 is an {{indispensable}} homologous recombination protein, necessary for strand invasion and crossing over. It {{has recently been}} designated as a Fanconi anaemia (FA) gene, following the discovery of two patients carrying dominant negative mutations. FA is a hereditary DNA repair disorder characterised by various congenital abnormalities, progressive bone marrow failure and cancer predisposition. The cellular and molecular pathology of FA is poorly understood, resulting in a severe lack of effective treatment options. In this thesis, I describe the first viable vertebrate model of RAD 51 loss. Phenotypic characterisation of zebrafish rad 51 loss-of-function mutants showed that they develop key features of FA, including hypocellular kidney marrow, sensitivity to crosslinking agents and decreased size. Taking advantage of the unique properties of the zebrafish model, I show {{that some of these}} symptoms stem from both decreased proliferation, as well as increased apoptosis of embryonic haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. <b>Co-mutation</b> of p$L was able to rescue the haematopoietic defects seen in the single mutants, but led to tumour development, underscoring the role of rad 51 as a tumour suppressor. I further demonstrate that prolonged inflammatory stress can exacerbate the haematological impairment, leading to an additional decrease in kidney marrow cell numbers. In contrast, prolonged aldehyde-derived stress did not induce symptoms in the mutant fish. These findings strengthen the assignment of RAD 51 as a Fanconi gene and provide more evidence for the notion that aberrant p 53 signalling during embryogenesis leads to the haematological defects seen later in life in FA. It also strengthens the evidence for the involvement of haematopoietic stress, such as inflammation, in the development of bone marrow failure. Further research on this novel zebrafish FA model will lead to {{a deeper understanding of the}} molecular basis of bone marrow failure in FA and the cellular role of RAD 51. This research was supported by a European Hematology Association PhD Studentshi...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: PIK 3 CA gene {{encoding}} a catalytic subunit of the phosphatidylinositol- 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) is mutated and/or amplified {{in various}} neoplasia, including lung cancer. Here we investigated PIK 3 CA gene alterations, {{the expression of}} core components of PI 3 K pathway, and evaluated their clinical importance in {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Oncogenic mutations/rearrangements in PIK 3 CA, EGFR, KRAS, HER 2, BRAF, AKT 1 and ALK genes were detected in tumors from 1117 patients with NSCLC. PIK 3 CA gene copy number was examined by fluorescent in situ hybridization and the expression of PI 3 K p 110 subunit alpha (PI 3 K p 110 α), p-Akt, mTOR, PTEN was determined by immunohistochemistry in PIK 3 CA mutant cases and 108 patients without PIK 3 CA mutation. RESULTS: PIK 3 CA mutation was found in 3. 9 % of squamous cell carcinoma and 2. 7 % of adenocarcinoma. Among 34 PIK 3 CA mutant cases, 17 tumors harbored concurrent EGFR mutations and 4 had KRAS mutations. PIK 3 CA mutation was significantly associated with high expression of PI 3 K p 110 α (p< 0. 0001), p-Akt (p =  0. 024) and mTOR (p =  0. 001), but not correlated with PIK 3 CA amplification (p =  0. 463). Patients with single PIK 3 CA mutation had shorter overall survival than those with PIK 3 CA-EGFR/KRAS <b>co-mutation</b> or wildtype PIK 3 CA (p =  0. 004). A significantly worse survival was also found in patients with PIK 3 CA mutations than those without PIK 3 CA mutations in the EGFR/KRAS wildtype subgroup (p =  0. 043). CONCLUSIONS: PIK 3 CA mutations frequently coexist with EGFR/KRAS mutations. The poor prognosis of patients with single PIK 3 CA mutation in NSCLC and the prognostic value of PIK 3 CA mutation in EGFR/KRAS wildtype subgroup suggest the distinct mutation status of PIK 3 CA gene should be determined for individual therapeutic strategies in NSCLC...|$|E
40|$|The {{conference is}} also named as 'Innovations in Cancer Prevention and Research Conference'Introduction: Cancer {{is a complex}} {{heterogeneous}} disease that results from accumulation of genomic aberrations reflected in signaling network alterations. Identifying signaling network signatures involved in carcinogenesis greatly facilitates the development of rational targeted therapy. Endometrial cancer {{is the most common}} gynecologic cancer but treatment options for advanced or recurrent disease are limited and ineffective. The phosphatidylinositol 3 ’-kinase (PI 3 K) pathway has been implicated in the etiology of endometrial cancer and therefore represents an ideal therapeutic target. Through sequencing on 222 endometrial cancer patient samples, we have demonstrated frequent mutations in multiple PI 3 K family members including PTEN (44 %), PIK 3 CA (p 110 alpha catalytic subunit of PI 3 K; 40 %) and PIK 3 R 1 (p 85 alpha regulatory subunit; 20 %). Of particular interest, PIK 3 CA or PIK 3 R 1 mutations co-exist with PTEN heterozygous mutations at frequencies higher than expected in contrast to most cancers, indicating the likelihood that they cooperate with PTEN aberrations in the pathophysiology of endometrial cancer. High-throughput reverse-phase protein array show that PTEN protein loss is a dominant effect resulting in PI 3 K pathway activation and that PIK 3 CA or PIK 3 R 1 mutations mimic PTEN loss in tumors where PTEN is heterozygously mutated and PTEN protein is retained, suggesting that PIK 3 CA or PIK 3 R 1 mutations might be co-selected with heterozygous PTEN mutations to compensate for incomplete loss of PTEN protein. Methods: In this study, correlation-based Relevance Networks are built after categorization of the patient samples into subgroups based on PI 3 K pathway mutation status (single mutation or co-mutations). Results: The results elucidate signaling network perturbations associated with different mutation and <b>co-mutation</b> patterns in endometrial cancer. Conclusion: Identifying signaling network signatures downstream of the mutations will aid the development of effective molecular markers and therapeutic targeting in patients with different PI 3 K pathway aberrations...|$|E
40|$|Background and {{objective}} Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) {{has been transformed}} from the treatment according to histological type to genotype treatment model. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) genes {{are the most important}} drivers in lung cancer. The aim {{of this study is to}} explore the clinical characteristics and prognostic factors of patients with advanced NSCLC with different genotypes. Methods We retrospectively reviewed the clinical data of 553 advanced NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations and ALK positive who were hospitalized in the Beijing Chest Hospital from July 2004 to December 2015, and the independent prognostic factors of patients were analyzed by Cox proportional hazards regression model. Results The clinical data of 553 patients (227 with EGFR mutations, 58 with ALK positive, 2 with EGFR and ALK <b>co-mutation</b> and 266 with wild-type) with advanced NSCLC were enrolled in this study. The median survival time of 227 patients with EGFR mutations was 28. 7 mo (95 %CI: 22. 160 - 35. 240), and the performance status (PS) score (0 - 1) (HR= 4. 451; 95 %CI: 2. 112 - 9. 382; P< 0. 001) and EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeted therapy (HR= 2. 785; 95 %CI: 1. 871 - 4. 145; P< 0. 001) were the independent prognostic factors for the survival of patients harboring EGFR mutations. The median survival time of 58 patients with ALK positive was 15. 5 mo (95 %CI: 10. 991 - 20. 009), and treatment with crizotinib (P= 0. 022) was the independent influence factor for the survival of ALK positive patients. The median survival time of 266 patients with wild-type was 12. 1 mo (95 %CI: 10. 660 - 13. 540), and the PS score (0 - 1) (HR= 2. 313; 95 %CI: 1. 380 - 3. 877; P= 0. 001) and treatment with chemotherapy (HR= 1. 911; 95 %CI: 1. 396 - 2. 616; P< 0. 001) were the independent prognostic factors for the survival of wild-type patients. Conclusion The prognosis of patients with advanced NSCLC is associated with genetic mutation, and targeted therapy has a improvement on survival for patients with EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangement...|$|E
40|$|Human equilibrative {{nucleoside}} transporter 1 is {{the main}} mediator of bi-directional nucleoside flux and is found ubiquitously. Inhibitor and substrate interactions with ENT 1 {{are known to be}} affected by cysteine-modifying reagents. Our aim was to investigate the importance of cysteine residues in hENT 1 function and identify which residues were sensitive to thiol modification for further application of cysteine scanning mutagenesis on extracellular loop 5. Transporter function was assessed by the binding of [3 H]NBMPR and the cellular uptake of [3 H] 2 -chloroadenosine. Treatment of hENT 1 with the neutral sulfhydryl-modifier methyl methanethiosulfonate (MMTS) enhanced [3 H]NBMPR binding but decreased [3 H] 2 -chloroadenosine uptake. The membrane impermeable positively charged reagent [2 -(Trimethylammonium) ethyl] methane-thiosulfonate (MTSET) but not the negatively charged reagent sodium-(2 -sulfonatoethyl) -methanethiosulfonate (MTSES), inhibited [3 H]NBMPR binding and enhanced [3 H] 2 -chloroadenosine uptake. Furthermore, all three sulfhydryl modifiers decreased [3 H]NBMPR binding when allowed cytoplasmic access. Site-directed mutagenesis on Cys 222 eliminated the effect of MMTS on NBMPR binding. Mutation of Cys 378 abolished the effect of MTSET on NMBPR binding and indicated that Cys 378 is an extracellular-located residue. Mutation of Cys 414 led to an enhancement of the ability of MTSET to inhibit NBMPR binding and this effect was eliminated by <b>co-mutation</b> of Cys 378. Mutation of Cys 416 abolished the effect of charged sulfhydryl reagents to inhibit NBMPR binding in isolated membranes, and also eliminated transport function supporting a conformational linkage between the fifth intracellular loop and the NBMPR binding domain, and implicates this region in the translocation function of hENT 1. To further confirm the importance of this region, extracellular loop 5 (EL 5) was examined by cysteine scanning mutagenesis as residues in EL 5 were individually mutated to cysteines. Mutation of N 379, F 390, E 391, H 392, and D 393 to cysteine abolished uptake of [3 H] 2 -chloroadenosine indicating their role in the transport mechanism of hENT 1. Treatment of EL 5 mutants with MTSET inhibited NBMPR binding in all but the V 389 C mutant. Co-incubation of NBMPR with MTSET was able to protect N 379 C from thiol modification while co-incubation of adenosine with MTSET protected R 384 C, Y 385 C, and L 386 C from MTSET effects. Our results indicate that adenosine may bind in close vicinity or in direct contact to these residues to prevent MTSET to attain access...|$|E
