40|$|Potato yields in sub-Saharan Africa remain {{very low}} {{compared}} with those of developed countries. Yet potato is major food staple and source of income to the predominantly smallholder growing households in the tropical highlands of this region. A major cause of the low potato yields is the use of poor quality seed potato. This paper examines the factors determining the decision to use <b>certified</b> <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> (CSP), as well as the intensity of its use, among potato growers with access to it. We focused on potato growers in the central highlands of Kenya and used regression analysis to test hypotheses relating to potential impediments of CSP use. The study found that the distance to the market (a proxy for transaction costs), household food insecurity, and asset endowment affect the decision to use CSP. However, the effect of the intensity of use of CSP depends on how the intensity variable is defined. Several other control variables also affect the decision and extent of CSP use. The study concludes that transaction costs, asset endowment, and household food insecurity {{play a major role in}} the decision by smallholder potato farmers to use CSP and the extent to which they do so.

40|$|AbstractThe use of <b>certified</b> <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> is {{believed}} to substantially improve potato productivity. However, in developing countries including Indonesia, most farmers perceived {{that the price of}} certified seed is too expensive for potato cultivation. Farmers, therefore, often produce and use their own seed which is usually derived from the certified seed. In East Java, some farmers usually act as local seed growers and sell their seed to others in their villages. The complexity of the buying situation faced by East Javanese farmers whenever they are willing to purchase seed prompted this study {{of the extent to which}} buyer-supplier relationships influence farmers’ decision to purchase seed potato. A total of 209 farmers from the highlands of East Java were interviewed in this study. The data were analyzed using factor analysis and multiple regression analysis. The findings generally suggest that farmer-supplier relationships in the East Java seed potato market were established based on high levels of satisfaction, trust and long-term commitment. A significant positive relationship was observed between supplier's offer quality and farmers’ relationship satisfaction. Such would suggest that the high level of farmers’ relationship satisfaction was derived from the adequate suppliers’ offer quality. However, it was the seed and service quality dimension, rather than delivery and pricing, which significantly improved the farmers’ relationship satisfaction...|$|E

Parameters determined included aphid population, virus disease incidence and tuber yield. Aphid population was monitored on leaves and in water-pan traps. Virus infection was determined based on symptoms and the viruses were identified in tubers sprouts by DAS-ELISA. Tuber yield was determined for plants showing virus symptoms and healthy-looking plants. Five aphid species were identified, with the most abundant being M. euphorbiae and A. gossypii on leaves and M. persicae and A. gossypii in water traps. The average aphid population was between 1. 4 and 4. 2 aphids per three leaves and 4. 68 and 9. 64 aphids per water pan trap. Farms with higher population of M. persicae had higher virus disease incidence. The most prevalent viruses were PVS, PLRV and PVM.

The quarantine diseases such as bacterial ring rots and diseases limited in certified seed, like Erwinia soft rots are a serious threat to organic seed potato production. However the management strategies against these diseases are similar in both organic and conventional production. At the present only one producer in Finland is growing certified organic seed potato. Due to problems in plant protection there has not been enough courage among farmers to specialise organic seed potato production.

Shortly after the first settlers arrived in the 1890s, several canals were developed to divert water from streams running off the Yellowstone Plateau and Teton Range. Some farmland, mostly to the east, is high enough and close enough to the Teton Range that crops can grow without irrigation due to increased rainfall. The relatively high altitude limited crops to those requiring a short growing season such as grain and alfalfa. <b>Seed</b> <b>potatoes</b> were not tried as a crop until 1920 but as it turns out, the area is perfect for <b>seed</b> <b>potatoes.</b> The short growing season keeps the potatoes desirably small, and the long, cold winters create the ideal conditions for seed. The longtime enemy to potato farming is potato blight, a form of mold that reproduces from spores in the soil and sickens the potato plant. Ashton's winters clean the soil of these mold spores with a long, deep, and killing freeze. Potato blight never spreads because the soil is clean and free of spores each spring. After realizing this, farmers organized, hired inspectors, and began selling <b>certified</b> <b>seed</b> <b>potatoes</b> giving buyers comfort that Ashton seed was free of molds and disease.

The seed potato production area was 1290 hectares year 2006. The seed potato production is concentrated in the Nothern parts of Finland where the High Grade Region (Tyrnävä and Liminka in the Oulu region) {{for the production of}} seed potato is located. Four generations of prebasic seed (class SS, S, SEE and SE), three generations of basic seed (class EC 1, EC 2 and EC 3) and one generation of certified seed (class A or B) are produced in Finland. The seed potato inspection schema of Finland includes several steps: the field inspection, the laboratory tests of potato cyst nematodes, bacterial ring rot, brown rot and potato virus and finally the visual tuber inspection. The field inspection, sampling and visual tuber inspection are done by the authorized inspectors. For prebasic and basic seed the inspectors make two official field inspections. For certified seed only one field inspection is needed. Official requirements are set for varietal purity, rogues, potato virus, black leg (Erwinia spp.) and Rhizoctonia. During the field inspection the background information as previous crop is checked. The soil sample for testing potato cyst nematodes is taken per each hectare. The potato cyst nematodes (Globodera sp.) are quarantine organisms and the seed potato production is not possible on the field infected by the nematodes. In the autumn the tubers for winter tests in the laboratory are sampled. For bacterial ring rot a sample is 200 tubers/ha and for virus tests 200 tubers/field. Brown rot is tested as a survey of seed potato production. The testing method for bacterial ring rot (Clavibacter michiganensis ssp. sepedonicus) and brown rot (Ralstonia solanacearum) is the immunofluorescense (IF) method based on the specific antibodies. These quarantine organisms are not accepted in the seed potato production. The potato virus Y-, A-, X-, S-, M- and Potato Leaf Roll are tested once during seed potato certification process usually as the prebasic seed. For the other seed classes the potato virus Y and potato virus A are tested. For <b>certified</b> <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> class A there is a list of varieties which are tested. The seed class B is not routinely tested. The testing method is ELISAtest. The seed potato companies need certificate labels before sorting and packing potatoes. A visual tuber inspection is done by the local inspectors. A sample of 400 tubers/ 50 tn is cut by knife and tubers are inspected one by one. There are requirements for soil, dry and wet rot, external blemishes, common scab, black scurf, skin spot and deep-pitted scab. The quarantine organisms or visual symtops of moptop virus or tobacco rattle virus are not accepted. If all steps of inspection and testing are according to legislation, the seed potato lot is officially certified and can be marketed as seed potato to the farmers. vokMyynti MTT Tietopalvelut 31600 Jokioine...|$|E

40|$|In {{many areas}} of the world, Potato virus Y (PVY) {{is one of the most}} {{economically}} important disease problems in <b>seed</b> <b>potatoes.</b> In Taiwan, generation 2 (G 2) class <b>certified</b> <b>seed</b> <b>potatoes</b> are required by law to be free of detectable levels of PVY. To meet this standard, it is necessary to perform accurate tests at a reasonable cost. We used a two-stage testing design involving group testing which was performed in Taiwan's Seed Improvement and Propagation Station to identify plants infected with PVY. At the first stage of this two-stage testing design, plants are tested in groups. The second stage involves no retesting for negative test groups and exhaustive testing of all constituent individual samples from positive test groups. In order to minimise costs while meeting government standards, it is imperative to estimate optimal group size. However, because of limited test accuracy, classification errors for diagnostic tests are inevitable; to get a more accurate estimate, it is necessary to adjust for these errors. Therefore, this paper describes an analysis of diagnostic test data in which specimens are grouped for batched testing to offset costs. The optimal batch size is determined by various cost parameters as well as test sensitivity, specificity and disease prevalence. Here, the Bayesian method is employed to deal with uncertainty in these parameters. Moreover, we developed a computer program to determine optimal group size for PVY tests such that the expected cost is minimised even when using imperfect diagnostic tests of pooled samples. Results from this research show that, compared with error free testing, when the presence of diagnostic testing errors is taken into account, the optimal group size becomes smaller. Higher diagnostic testing costs, lower costs of false negatives or smaller prevalence can all lead to a larger optimal group size. Regarding the effects of sensitivity and specificity, optimal group size increases as sensitivity increases; however, specificity has little effect on determining optimal group size. From our simulated study, it is apparent that the Bayesian method can truly update the prior information to more closely approximate the intrinsic characteristics of the parameters of interest. We believe that the results of this study will be useful in the implementation of <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> certification programmes, particularly those which require zero tolerance for quarantine diseases in certified tubers...|$|R

In view of this situation it seemed advisable to investigate this problem to determine whether, and to what extent, environment and maturity as such influence the productivity of <b>seed</b> <b>potatoes</b> and also whether it is feasible to produce satisfactory <b>seed</b> <b>potatoes</b> in the southern and eastern portions of Nebraska...|$|R
25|$|Potatoes are {{generally}} grown from <b>seed</b> <b>potatoes</b> – these are tubers specifically grown to be disease free and provide consistent and healthy plants. To be disease free, {{the areas where}} <b>seed</b> <b>potatoes</b> are grown are selected with care. In the USA this restricts production of <b>seed</b> <b>potatoes</b> to only 15 states out of the 50 states that grow potatoes. These locations are selected for their cold hard winters that kill pests and long sunshine hours in the summer for optimum growth. In the UK, most <b>seed</b> <b>potatoes</b> originate in Scotland in areas where westerly winds prevent aphid attack and thus prevent spread of potato virus pathogens.|$|R
40|$|Today, PVY {{control is}} mainly {{based on the}} use of <b>certified</b> <b>potato</b> <b>seeds</b> and on aphid flights {{monitoring}} (Euraphid system and aspiration traps) allowing to inform major flights. On such a basis, control measures are taken within the crop. Our project aims, through {{a better understanding of the}} interactions between the PVY and the vector aphids, to propose an alternative approach of the viral control. It can be divided into two parts: - The identification and characterization of the PVY strains present in Wallonia and the determination of associations with the aphid species, with a particular attention for sequences potentially involved in the transmission by the vector. - The study of the interaction between the aphids stylet (Myzus persicae and Aphis gossypii), a viral protein (HC-Pro) and the coat protein which determine the transmissibility and its efficiency in the Potyvirus. In particular, we hypothesize that the interactions of the viral particles with the aphid stylet follow the model of the "bridge" protein and can be inhibited by blocking agents. Data on the type of PVY strains present in Southern Belgium, their distributions and the related aphid species will be presented...|$|R
40|$|<b>Seed</b> <b>potato</b> {{systems in}} East Africa are {{described}} {{and opportunities for}} improvement identified {{on the basis of}} interviews with potato producers in Kenya, Uganda and Ethiopia, and an assessment of Ralstonia solanacearum and virus disease levels in Kenya. 3 % of <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> sold in Kenyan markets was virus free. Ralstonia solanacearum was found in 74 % of potato farms. Less than 5 % of the farmers interviewed source <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> from specialized <b>seed</b> growers. Over 50 % rely entirely on farm-saved <b>seed.</b> Current <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> prices justify this behavior. To improve the system the local and specialized chain need to be tackled simultaneously. To improve the local chain ware potato farmers require training on seed quality maintenance and managing bacterial wilt and viruses. Research into virus resistance and the effect of mixed virus infection on yield deserves attention. Private investment in <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> production could increase volumes produced and reduce price...|$|R

However, producer attitudes about the impact of seed-borne diseases and effectiveness of <b>certified</b> <b>seed</b> as a control mechanism also are important. Respondent characteristics (gross farm income, potato acreage, and geographic region of the state) seem to be less important influencers. Crop Production/Industries,...|$|R
40|$|Improved potato {{varieties}} {{can increase}} potato yields of smallholders, and thus contribute to food security improvement in Ethiopia. However, the uptake of these varieties by farmers {{is very limited}} so far {{and this is one}} of the causes of insufficient seed quality in the <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> system in Ethiopia. The low uptake may be related to the high costs of recommended production methods for these varieties. The objective of this study was to formulate least-cost <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> production methods for farmers in Ethiopia. The paper used integer linear programming to determine these least-cost <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> production methods, using published data on the perceived contributions to seed tuber yield and quality of different cultivation and post-harvest management options, and calculated <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> production cost data for the different options. For the potato-growing districts Jeldu and Welmera, several <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> production methods were formulated from which farmers can choose an affordable method that will enable them to produce <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> with reasonable yield and quality levels. Results showed that yield and quality levels could be simultaneously improved at relatively low extra costs, for example, by applying recommended fertilizer rate combined with two fungicide applications. In both districts, most methods were robust to 50 % increases in the rental values of land, prices of seed, wage rates, and prices of agrochemicals. Findings can be used by potato development practitioners to advise farmers on the adoption of <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> technologies that are compatible with their financial resources.

5000|$|Given that tubers are {{the primary}} {{mechanism}} by which P. atrosepticum survives and spreads, clean <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> stocks established using tissue cultures have been very successful in breaking the cycle of carrying disease forward from year to year.

[...] Some methods of sterile propagation include planting only healthy, whole <b>seed</b> <b>potatoes.</b> If healthy <b>seed</b> <b>potatoes</b> are to be cut, they should be first warmed to 12°-15 °C, cut, stored for 2 days at 12°-15 °C in a humid environment with good air flow. This warming and storing period ensures proper suberization of the tissue, which forms a barrier from P. atrosepticum infestation.|$|R
