5000|$|Excessive use of enemas {{has also}} been {{associated}} with cardiac problems, such as heart failure, and heart attacks related to electrolyte imbalances when performed as <b>coffee</b> <b>enema.</b> [...] Frequent enemas or other colon-cleansing tools may lead to dependence and inability to defecate without assistance or withdrawal symptoms. [...] Herbs taken orally may modulate the absorption or the activity of prescription drugs.|$|E

Joanna has tried to give up smoking, even going as far as to cover almost all of her body in nicotine patches, but has failed. She keeps a dead goldfish in her office because it makes her feel better. She also like to relax by giving herself a <b>coffee</b> <b>enema,</b> and she drives a black BMW 328i SE.|$|E
5000|$|In 1920, German {{scientists}} investigated caffeine's {{effect on}} the bile duct and small intestines. Dr. Max Gerson proposed that coffee enemas had a positive {{effect on the}} gastro-intestinal tract. Dr. Gerson said that coffee enemas had positive detoxification effects that contributed to the recovering health of his patients. He claimed that unlike saline enemas, <b>coffee</b> in the <b>enema</b> traveled through the smooth muscle of the small intestine, and into the liver. This, he said, stimulated autonomic nervous system in the same way caffeine does when consumed orally and activated the release of bile in the liver, cleared even more of the gastro-intestinal tract and removed more toxins than a normal enema. He told his patients often that the [...] "coffee enemas are not given for the function of the intestines but for the stimulation of the liver." ...|$|R
5000|$|He is keen on politics, {{and once}} stood as an {{independent}} candidate in an election (policies included [...] "Raising the age for a surgical consultancy to 48" [...] and [...] "Banning all motorcycles"), {{but he was not}} elected. He hates The Simpsons, BBC Radio 1, menstruation, tilting trains, botrytis (a plant disease), the metric system and crazy paving. He also claims {{to be a member of}} Mensa, and that his IQ is 139. Alan at one point tries to follow Joanna's practice of taking a <b>coffee</b> <b>enema</b> for relaxation, but neglects to let the coffee cool down first, causing him agonising pain, instead of the desired relaxing effect - in spite of which he perseveres with the treatment. He can also do several bird impressions, and can sing [...] "Baa Baa Black Sheep" [...] in Latin. Alan also has the habit of correcting other people's grammar.|$|E

The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the pharmacokinetics of caffeine after single administration of a <b>coffee</b> <b>enema</b> versus coffee consumed orally in healthymale subjects. The study designwas an open-label, randomized two-phase crossover study. Eleven healthy subjects were randomly assigned either to receive 500 mL of <b>coffee</b> <b>enema</b> for 10 minutes or to consume 180 mL of ready-to-drink coffee beverage. After a washout period of at least 10 days, all the subjects were switched to receive the alternate coffee procedure. Blood samples were collected immediately before and at specific time points until 12 hours after coffee administration in each phase. The mean caffeine content in both the coffee solution prepared for the <b>coffee</b> <b>enema</b> and the ready-to-drink coffee beverage was not statistically different. Th...|$|E
