Methods This study was conducted in two phases. Phase one included a content analysis of written state Comprehensive <b>Cancer</b> <b>Control</b> plans (n = 30) for terms related to genomics, or genomic components (n = 18). The second phase involved telephone interviews with the Comprehensive <b>Cancer</b> <b>Control</b> plan coordinators in states with plans that contained genomic components (n = 16). The interview was designed to gather more detailed information about the genomics-related initiatives within the states Comprehensive <b>Cancer</b> <b>Control</b> plan and the successes with and barriers to plan implementation, as defined by each state. Results Eighteen of the 30 Comprehensive <b>Cancer</b> <b>Control</b> plans analyzed contained genomics components. We noted a large variability among these 18 plans in the types of genomics components included. Nine (56 %) of the 16 states interviewed had begun to implement the genomics components in their plan. Most states emphasized educating health care providers and the public about the role of genomics in <b>cancer</b> <b>control.</b> Many states consider awareness of family history to be an important aspect of their Comprehensive <b>Cancer</b> <b>Control</b> plan. Approximately 67 % of states with family history components in their plans had begun to implement these goals. Virtually all states reported they would benefit from additional training in cancer genetics and general public health genomics. Conclusion The number of states incorporating genomics into their Comprehensive <b>Cancer</b> <b>Control</b> plans is increasing. Family history is a public health application of genomics that could be implemented more fully into Comprehensive <b>Cancer</b> <b>Control</b> plans...|$|R

In this paper, we review {{the history and}} development of <b>cancer</b> <b>control</b> policies in Australia {{up to the end}} of 2005, and discuss the principal publications produced by both government and non-government groups which have given rise to <b>cancer</b> <b>control</b> recommendations, goals and targets. These <b>cancer</b> <b>control</b> plans have arisen in response to the impact of cancer on the Australian community and in recognition of the health gains that can be made through effective <b>cancer</b> <b>control.</b> They have been developed either {{in the context of a}} broader framework of health policy or as specific endeavours in regard to cancer. The specific recommendations and strategies proposed have focused on reducing the impact of cancer in the Australian population.

The strength of these reports is their comprehensive approach in identifying priority cancers and areas where specific developments should impact on morbidity and mortality. In the future, <b>cancer</b> <b>control</b> plans should be better supported by economic evaluations, and greater financial support for implementation and regular assessment is needed to identify progress on cancer outcomes. The more recent national and State <b>cancer</b> <b>control</b> plans include the development of frameworks to foster a coordinated and cohesive approach to the delivery of cancer care.

40|$|Over {{the past}} few decades, there has been growing support for the idea that cancer needs an {{interdisciplinary}} approach. Therefore, the international cancer community has developed several strategies as outlined in the WHO non-communicable diseases Action Plan (which includes <b>cancer</b> <b>control)</b> as the World Health Assembly and the UICC World Cancer Declaration, which both include primary prevention, early diagnosis, treatment, and palliative care. This paper highlights experiences/ideas in <b>cancer</b> <b>control</b> for international collaborations between low, middle, and high income countries, including collaborations between the European Union (EU) and African Union (AU) Member States, the Latin-American and Caribbean countries, and the Eastern Mediterranean countries. These proposals are presented {{within the context of}} the global vision on <b>cancer</b> <b>control</b> set forth by WHO in partnership with the International Union Against Cancer (UICC), in addition to issues that should be considered for collaborations at the global level: cancer survival (similar to the project CONCORD), <b>cancer</b> <b>control</b> for youth and adaptation of Clinical Practice Guidelines. Since <b>cancer</b> <b>control</b> is given lower priority on the health agenda of low and middle income countries and is less represented in global health efforts in those countries, EU and AU cancer stakeholders are working to put <b>cancer</b> <b>control</b> on the agenda of the EU-AU treaty for collaborations, and are proposing to consider palliative care, population-based cancer registration, and training and education focusing on primary prevention as core tools. A Community of Practice, such as the Third International <b>Cancer</b> <b>Control</b> Congress (ICCC- 3), is an ideal place to share new proposals, learn from other experiences, and formulate new ideas. The aim of the ICCC- 3 is to foster new international collaborations to promote <b>cancer</b> <b>control</b> actions in low and middle income countries. The development of supranational collaborations has been hindered by the fact that <b>cancer</b> <b>control</b> is not part of the objectives of the Millennium Development Goals (MGGs).

40|$|The <b>Cancer</b> <b>Control</b> Council of New Zealand was {{established}} in 2005 to provide an independent, sustainable focus for <b>cancer</b> <b>control.</b> One of its key roles is to monitor and review implementation of the <b>Cancer</b> <b>Control</b> Strategy. In early 2007, the Evaluation and Monitoring Working Group of the Council undertook a monitoring exercise on all Phase 1 -designated milestones in the <b>Cancer</b> <b>Control</b> Strategy Action Plan 2005 – 2010. Phase 1 designates those actions to be undertaken in the first 1 to 2 years of the Action Plan i. e. 2005 – 2006. In addition, the Council commissioned {{an evaluation of the}} developing regional cancer networks. The evaluation and monitoring report Mapping Progress: The First Two Years of the <b>Cancer</b> <b>Control</b> Strategy 2005 - 2010 was launched in August 2007 and found that 71 % of all Phase 1 milestones were either achieved or in progress. The Council noted that Goals 1 and 2 (of the Strategy) were proceeding most rapidly and thoroughly. However, while there were good achievements in certain areas of Goals 3, 4, 5, and 6, overall progress was less systematic. Phase 1 milestones that aim to address cancer-related inequalities were also assessed and found to have marginally better progress than the overall milestones, but did not reflect a systematic approach to addressing inequalities. The Council is now undertaking a consultation phase to seek feedback on the evaluation and monitoring report and input into further monitoring activities.

Utilization of breast and cervical <b>cancer</b> <b>control</b> behaviours in Australia is less than optimal, particularly amongst Eastern European and Arabic populations. Psychosocial factors have generally been found to predict <b>cancer</b> <b>control</b> uptake, yet little is known {{of the role of}} these factors amongst these ethnic populations. Guided by comprehensive health behavior theories, this research assessed the associations of cognitive and affective psychosocial variables to the utilization of breast and cervical <b>cancer</b> <b>control</b> behaviours among Croatian-, Lebanese-, Macedonian- and Australian-born women. In the absence of appropriate measures, the Revised Illness Perception Questionnaire for healthy people (IPQ-RH) was empirically validated in the Arabic, Croatian and English languages for breast and cervical cancer contexts. Across several studies (total N = 904) women representing each of the four ethnic groups completed self-report measures relating to cognitive (e. g., attitudes towards the efficacy of mammography to detect cancer) and affective (e. g., breast cancer worry) factors and <b>cancer</b> <b>control</b> behaviour use (i. e., self-examination of the breasts (BSE), clinical breast examination (CBE), mammography, Pap smear and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine uptake). Overall, Lebanese women were significantly lower users of BSE and mammography than Australian and Croatian women, and Macedonian women were less likely to have accepted the HPV vaccine than Australian women. Multiple regression analyses showed that across the studies a number of psychosocial and behavioural factors were associated with breast cancer screening (i. e., breast cancer worry, general risk factors and negative emotional representations) and cervical <b>cancer</b> <b>control</b> use (i. e., identity (symptoms), cyclical timelines for cervical cancer, perceived efficacy of cervical <b>cancer</b> <b>control</b> and general risk factors).

Factors considered in this framework for setting intervention priorities included the magnitude of the problem; the existence of scientific consensus regarding the efficacy of intervention techniques; the availability of data needed to plan, implement, and evaluate an intervention; the availability of resources within communities to implement an intervention; and the existence of public demand for the intervention.
