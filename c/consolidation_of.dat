40|$|Since its {{development}} in 1925, Terzaghi's expression {{for the average}} degree <b>of</b> <b>consolidation</b> has been extensively used in teaching, research and consulting to determine the consolidation settlement {{that has taken place}} at a specific time in a geotechnical problem. Recent research by the authors has revealed that the term degree <b>of</b> <b>consolidation</b> is not very meaningful when the initial pore pressure distribution is highly skewed. In view of these findings, a review of all aspects <b>of</b> Terzaghi's <b>consolidation</b> theory is required, particularly when considering asymmetric initial pore pressure distributions. An exact method for estimating the <b>consolidation</b> settlement <b>of</b> a clay stratum using the mass flux per unit area out of the drainage boundaries is proposed. Graphical representations of both exact and traditional methods reveal identical average degree <b>of</b> <b>consolidation</b> curves. In light of this, Terzaghi's expression for the average degree <b>of</b> <b>consolidation</b> was re-examined. Upon application of the original governing one-dimensional consolidation equation, {{it was found that the}} traditional and exact methods for calculating the average degree <b>of</b> <b>consolidation</b> are identical. Thus, the widespread proclivity for geotechnical engineers to use Terzaghi's average degree <b>of</b> <b>consolidation</b> equation to estimate the <b>consolidation</b> settlement <b>of</b> a clay stratum has been validated...|$|R

40|$|Fine-grained sediments on land, or in a {{freshwater}} or marine environment, {{may become}} contaminated {{with a wide}} range of pollutants including hydrocarbons. This paper is concerned with preliminary studies of the mobilization and transportation of hydrocarbons, during the process <b>of</b> <b>consolidation,</b> to adjacent sediments or water bodies. A modified Rowe Cell was used to measure the <b>consolidation</b> properties <b>of</b> prepared kaolinite and bentonite clay-water slurries, with and without the addition of oil, along with hydrocarbon-bearing drill-cuttings samples taken from the sea-bed adjacent to two North Sea oil-well platforms. The <b>consolidation</b> properties <b>of</b> the kaolinite and bentonite clay slurries were little altered by the addition of oil, which was present at concentrations of between 8073 and 59 572 mg kg(- 1). During each <b>consolidation</b> stage, samples <b>of</b> the expelled pore-fluids were collected and analysed for oil content. These values were very low in comparison with the original oil concentration in the samples and changed little between each <b>consolidation</b> stage. Analysis <b>of</b> the slurry samples both before and after consolidation confirms that, proportionally, little oil is removed as a result <b>of</b> <b>consolidation.</b> The implication <b>of</b> these results is that, for the range of samples tested, the very high hydraulic gradients and particle rearrangements that occur during the process <b>of</b> <b>consolidation</b> are capable <b>of</b> releasing only proportionally small amounts of oil bound to the fine-grained clay and silt particles...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. It is of {{significance}} to determinate the <b>consolidation</b> state <b>of</b> soil {{for evaluation of}} deformation and strength of foundation soil. The <b>consolidation</b> state <b>of</b> red clay is determined through laboratory experiments combined with static cone penetration tests. The {{results show that the}} law <b>of</b> <b>consolidation</b> history <b>of</b> red clay is opposite to other soils. The static point resistance obtained from cone penetration test decreases linearly with soil depth increasing. The over-consolidate rate of different soil layer gotten by laboratory experiments also decreases linearly with soil depth increasing. The slopes of two linear regress curves are similar. The change of static point resistance can be used to estimate over-consolidate rate of red clay at different depth...|$|R

5|$|The 1951 charter reforms {{included}} <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> {{city and}} county offices. When all of the municipalities in Philadelphia County were consolidated into one city in 1854, the surviving county offices often duplicated the efforts of city offices.

A State Supreme Court case decided in 1953 settled the issue, for the most part, leaving the Register of Wills as an independently elected official.|$|E

40|$|Embedment will {{generally}} reduce {{the magnitude and}} rate <b>of</b> <b>consolidation</b> settlement <b>of</b> shallow foundations due to {{the resistance of the}} soil above foundation level, the reduction in foundation load due to side friction and the longer drainage paths. Conversely, embedment provided by foundation skirts may increase the magnitude and rate <b>of</b> <b>consolidation</b> settlement due to additional one-dimensional compression within the soil plug. This paper presents an investigation into the <b>consolidation</b> response <b>of</b> surface and variously embedded foundations in an isotropic elastic half-space.
