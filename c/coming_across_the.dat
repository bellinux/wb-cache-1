5|$|The {{team had}} a solid showing at the {{traditional}} opener to the French cycling season, the Grand Prix d'Ouverture La Marseillaise. While 's Jérémy Roy easily won the race with a solo breakaway, Gautier rode to sixth place by finishing {{near the front of}} the peloton two and a half minutes behind. At Kuurne–Brussels–Kuurne, one of the early-season Belgian races, Chavanel also turned in a sixth place, in a large field sprint. That same day, Gautier secured a podium finish at Les Boucles du Sud Ardèche, coming third in a selective 12-rider sprint {{at the front of the}} race. Chavanel rode to eighth place at Le Samyn, <b>coming</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> line 11 seconds back of the winner Dominic Klemme in a race decided by a late breakaway.|$|E
5|$|The bridge {{continued}} to prosper through the 1920s and 1930s with a toll of one quarter {{to cross the}} bridge, with drivers of State Highway Route 6 coming along the bridge from the junction with State Highway Route 8 <b>coming</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> bridge since 1927. During the 1920s and 1930s, the states of New Jersey and Pennsylvania began to buy out bridges along the Delaware River under the Joint Commission for the Elimination of Toll Bridges. The reconstructed bridge at Belvidere was bought by the commission for $60,000 (1920s USD) and the covered bridge at Columbia for only $50,000. Although the commission tried to buy the second-hand railroad bridge for a lower, unspecified amount, Darlington used his strong bargaining skills to raise the amount to $275,000, {{a far cry from}} the other local bridges. Residents of Knowlton Township, New Jersey rejoiced at the fact of when the bridge was bought, tolls were eliminated from the crossing. The new generation of people prospered at the thought that the crossing the Delaware would be forever free.|$|E

5|$|While <b>coming</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Piquet and Rossiter battle Lotterer {{moved in}} front of {{teammate}} Jarvis to claim second place. Rusinov entered the pit lane from the LMP2 lead for left-rear bodywork repairs and Rast was handed the No. 26 Oreca. Piquet was able to pass Rossiter for eighth position overall while Turner moved ahead of the other Ford car to run in third in LMGTE Pro. The second round of pit stops began one minute later when Jarvis entered the pit lane and {{the remainder of the}} LMP1 field followed in response for driver changes. Benoît Tréluyer pushed hard and lost control of his car's back-end at Vale corner, allowing Jani to move into second position. Christensen's right-front tyre was punctured at Becketts corner and he made a pit stop for a replacement wheel which promoted Turner to second in the class. After changing drivers in the No. 42 Strakka Racing Gibson, Danny Watts overtook González at Brooklands corner for second position in LMP2. Hartley went to the outside of Wainwright driving through Farm Curve and his car's right-front quarter made contact with Wainwright's left-rear section. Hartley went over the bonnet of the No. 86 Porsche but avoided flipping over; both cars went off the track, skidding across the gravel trap, and into the barriers {{at the end of the}} Complex. Both Hartley and Wainwright retired from the event and a full course yellow flag was necessitated to allow the cars to be extracted from the track.|$|E

On one snap, Scarry stepped on quarterback Otto Graham's foot as he backpedaled to handle Willis. Brown took a look himself: Willis was not offside.

[...] "I don't think there was anybody as quick at that position, or any position for that matter. He came off that ball with that ball as quick as anything {{you would want to}} see." ...|$|E
500|$|For {{four more}} days Bouvet's ships were {{battered}} {{by the high}} winds, none able to approach the shore without severe risk of being destroyed on the rocky coast. Losing their anchors as the cables snapped, many ships were forced to run before the wind and scatter into the Western Approaches. Others were destroyed: an American ship named Ellis, passing close to Crookhaven on 29 December, encountered a vessel wallowing in the waves, dismasted and with the deck strewn with bodies. The American captain, Harvey, reported that he approached the ship {{but was unable to}} assist her due to the storm and as he watched, the ship was driven ashore and destroyed. This was the 44-gun frigate , of which only seven men survived from her complement of 550 crew and passengers.

500|$|Adam Mitchell (Bruno Langley) {{joins the}} Doctor and Rose as {{companion}} {{at the end}} of [...] "Dalek". However, when he tries to smuggle future knowledge from Satellite Five in the year 200,000 back to his own time in [...] "The Long Game" [...] the Doctor expels him from the TARDIS. The Doctor is angry at Rose after he takes her to the event of father Pete Tyler (Shaun Dingwall)'s death and she saves his life, causing a paradox. However, when Pete dies to restore the timeline he shows compassion and encourages her to sit by his side as he passes away. After encountering Captain Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) (a con artist and former Time Agent from the 51st century) in 1941, the Doctor realises Harkness had caused a deadly nanotechnological plague to sweep through the human race, turning humans into gas-mask zombies. Following the resolution of the situation, Jack prepares to sacrifice himself, but the Doctor saves him and invites him on board the TARDIS. When the Doctor encounters Blon (Annette Badland), the only Slitheen to survive the Downing Street explosion in present-day Cardiff he has doubts over whether or not to send her home to be executed. During this episode the Doctor first notices that he and Rose had kept <b>coming</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> words [...] "Bad Wolf". In the episode [...] "Bad Wolf" [...] the Doctor, Rose and Jack find themselves {{at the mercy of the}} Bad Wolf Corporation based on Satellite Five. However, the true enemy is revealed to be the Daleks, the Dalek Emperor having also survived the Time War and had rebuilt the Dalek race. The Doctor sends Rose back to the 21st century to protect her before attempting to destroy the Dalek army. When he realises that doing this would destroy most of planet Earth he is unable to do so, proclaiming he would rather be a coward than a killer. Having absorbed the energies of the time vortex, Rose is able to return to the Doctor and destroy the Daleks. To save Rose from being killed by harbouring the time vortex, the Doctor removes the harmful effects by kissing her. However, the damage to his cells causes him to regenerate and the Tenth Doctor (David Tennant) takes his place.|$|E
