50|$|<b>Sugar</b> <b>candy</b> is any candy {{whose primary}} {{ingredient}} is sugar. The main types of <b>sugar</b> <b>candies</b> are hard candies, fondants, caramels, jellies, and nougats.|$|R
50|$|Candied sugar has {{its origins}} in Iran. Islamic writers {{in the first half}} of the 9th century {{described}} the production of <b>candy</b> <b>sugar,</b> where crystals were grown as a result of cooling supersaturated sugar solutions. In order to accelerate crystallization, confectioners later learned to immerse small twigs in the solution for the crystals to grow on. The sugar solution was colored with cochineal and indigo and scented with ambergris or flower essence.|$|E
50|$|Fruits {{and spices}} are key {{ingredients}} in some beer styles. While fruit beers and herb beers are often listed as style categories unto themselves, fruits and spices are sometimes used {{to contribute to}} the flavour and aroma profile of other styles. Vegetables have also been used in beers. Honey, molasses, <b>candy</b> <b>sugar,</b> or other fermentable sugars may be added to impart their distinct flavours to a beer. While not an ingredient per se, some brewers have experimented with aging their beer in barrels previously used for bourbon or other distilled spirits, imparting the flavour of both the wood and the spirit to the beer.|$|E
50|$|The brewery {{produces}} three beers. Westmalle Dubbel is a 7% abv Dubbel. Westmalle Tripel is a 9.5% abv tripel, {{was first}} brewed in 1934 and the recipe {{has not changed}} since 1956. It is made with pale <b>candy</b> <b>sugar</b> and has a very pale colour produced from a mash of light pilsener malts. Styrian Goldings hops are used along with some German varieties and the classic Saaz pilsener hop. After a long secondary fermentation Westmalle Tripel is bottled with a dose of sugar and yeast. Westmalle Extra is a 5% abv beer with limited availability, i.e. a patersbier. It has been speculated that Westmalle's choice of three types of beers {{was based on the}} Holy Trinity.|$|E

50|$|In an {{otherwise}} coffee drinking country, East Frisia is {{noted for its}} consumption of tea and its tea culture. Strong black tea is served whenever there are visitors to an East Frisian home or other gathering, {{as well as with}} breakfast, mid-afternoon, and mid-evening. Tea is sweetened with kluntjes, a rock <b>candy</b> <b>sugar</b> that melts slowly, allowing multiple cups to be sweetened. Heavy cream is also used to flavour the tea. The tea is generally served in traditional small cups, with little cookies during the week and cake during special occasions or on weekends as a special treat. Brown rum, mixed with kluntjes and left for several months, is also added to black tea in the winter. The tea is alleged to cure headaches, stomach problems, and stress, among many other ailments.|$|E
5000|$|The British East India {{company made}} its first order for the {{importation}} of tea in 1667 to their agent in Bantam, and two canisters of tea weighing 143 lbs 8 oz arrived from Bantam in 1669. In 1672, a servant of Baron Herbert in London sent his instructions for tea making, and warming the delicate cups, to Shropshire;"The directions for the tea are: a quart of spring water just boiled, to which put a spoonful of tea, and sweeten to the palate with <b>candy</b> <b>sugar.</b> As soon as the tea and sugar are in, the steam must be kept {{in as much as}} may be, and let it lie half or quarter of an hour {{in the heat of the}} fire but not boil. The little cups must be held over the steam before the liquid be put in." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{traditional}} {{preparation is}} as follows: A Kluntje, a white rock <b>candy</b> <b>sugar</b> that melts slowly, {{is added to}} the empty cup (allowing multiple cups to be sweetened) then tea is poured over the Kluntje. A heavy cream [...] "cloud" [...] ("Wölkje"—a diminutive of 'cloud' in Frisian) {{is added to the}} tea [...] "water", the sugar represents [...] "land". It is served without a spoon and traditionally drunk unstirred, i. e. in three tiers: In the beginning one predominantly tastes the cream, then the tea and finally the sweet taste of kluntje {{at the bottom of the}} cup. Stirring the tea would blend all three tiers into one and spoil the traditional tea savouring. The tea is generally served with small cookies during the week and cakes during special occasions or on weekends as a special treat. The tea is said to cure headaches, stomach problems, and stress, among many other ailments. The tea set is commonly decorated with an East Friesian Rose design. As a guest, it is considered impolite to drink fewer than three cups of tea. Placing your cup upside down on the saucer or your spoon in the cup signals that you are finished and want no more tea.|$|E

50|$|Human {{memory is}} created and highly suggestible, and {{can create a}} wide variety of innocuous, embarrassing, and {{frightening}} memories through different techniques—including guided imagery, hypnosis, and suggestion by others. Though not all individuals exposed to these techniques develop memories, experiments suggest a significant number of people do, and will actively defend the existence of the events, even if told they were false and deliberately implanted. Questions about the possibility of false memories created an explosion of interest in suggestibility of human memory and resulted in an enormous increase in the knowledge about how memories are encoded, stored and recalled, producing pioneering experiments such as the lost in the mall technique. In Roediger and McDermott's (1995) experiment, subjects were presented with a list of related items (such as <b>candy,</b> <b>sugar,</b> honey) to study. When asked to recall the list, participants were just as, if not more, likely to recall semantically related words (such as sweet) than items that were actually studied, thus creating false memories. This experiment, though widely replicated, remains controversial due to debate considering that people may store semantically related items from a word list conceptually rather than as language, which could account for errors in recollection of words without the creation of false memories. Susan Clancy discovered that people claiming to have been victims of alien abductions are more likely to recall semantically related words than a control group in such an experiment.|$|E

40|$|Póster presentado en la XVI Reunión Científica de la Sociedad Española de Cromatografía y Técnicas Afines (SECyTA 2016), celebrada en Sevilla del 2 al 4 de noviembre de 2016. This paper {{focuses on}} the {{analysis}} of two groups of molecules in wine, enolones and vanillines. Both types of molecules present a common characteristic, their great polarity. Sotolon, maltol, furaneol and homofuraneol belong to the first group. Their chemical structures present certain similarity among them, which leads to similar physicochemical and olfactory properties. This group of compounds is described with the terms “burnt sugar, <b>candy</b> <b>sugar,</b> caramel and maple”. Sotolon and furaneol are the most powerful aromatic molecules within them, being their odor thresholds estimated in water‐ethanol matrix around 5 μg/L [1, 2]. The other group of molecules, vanillines, contributes to the oak related notes of alcoholic beverages. This work presents an automatized strategy to quantify the following aromatic compounds in wine: maltol, furaneol, homofuraneol, sotolon, vanillin, methyl vanillate, ethyl vanillate and acetovanillone. The development of this strategy implied the use of Gilson system (GX‐ 274 liquid handler). The proposed method {{is based on a}} solid phase extraction (SPE) using LiChrolut EN resins (50 mg). Three mL of wine were passed through a LiChrolut EN cartridge. After this, two consecutive washing up steps were applied.

40|$|Beekeepers usually supply their colonies with {{alternatives}} to nectar (i. e. sugar feeding) during dearth periods of the year, especially cold times of winter. The {{objective of the}} study was to determine the best substances to feed bees to enhance the tolerance and survival of honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) to low temperatures. Seven feeding choices were compared under laboratory conditions. These feeding choices were: sugar syrup, liquid honey, creamed honey, honey <b>candy,</b> <b>sugar</b> candy, honey jelly, and honey/sugarcane juice jelly. The results showed that the number of bees attracted to each feeding choice was influenced significantly by feeding type. Worker bees were attracted to all feeding choices and showed a high preference to creamed honey, honey jelly or honey/juice jelly. The tolerance of honey bees to low temperature was enhanced when bees were fed on creamed honey, sugar syrup or honey candy. The mean time at which 50 % of bees were able to survive ranged from 3 days (unfed bees) to 15. 8 days (honey candy group). The survival rate of worker bees was highest when they fed on honey candy, creamed honey or sugar candy. In light of this study, creamed honey or honey candy can be considered the best feeding choices for bee colonies during winter to enhance their survival and tolerance to low temperatures...|$|E
