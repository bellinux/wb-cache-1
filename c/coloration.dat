5|$|Adaptive <b>Coloration</b> in Animals is a 500-page {{textbook}} about camouflage, warning <b>coloration</b> and mimicry by the Cambridge zoologist Hugh Cott, {{first published}} during the Second World War in 1940; the book sold widely {{and made him}} famous.|$|E
5|$|Animal <b>coloration</b> {{has been}} a topic of {{interest}} and research in biology for centuries. In the classical era, Aristotle recorded that the octopus was able to change its <b>coloration</b> to match its background, {{and when it was}} alarmed.|$|E
30|$|Structural changes must be also {{considered}} {{to explain the}} colour of these materials. Thus, yellow <b>colorations</b> are obtained from orthovanadates and red-brown and orange <b>colorations</b> are obtained from divanadates.|$|R

40|$|Blue, pink, {{and yellow}} <b>colorations</b> appear from twisted bi-layer {{graphene}} (tBLG) when {{transferred to a}} SiO 2 /Si substrate (SiO 2 = 100 nm-thick). Raman and electron microscope studies reveal that these <b>colorations</b> appear for twist angles in the 9 - 15 ° range. Optical contrast simulations confirm that the observed <b>colorations</b> {{are related to the}} angle-dependent electronic properties of tBLG combined with the reflection that results from the layered structure tBLG/ 100 nm-thick SiO 2 /Si.

5|$|Most Limousin cattle have a <b>coloration</b> that {{varies from}} light wheat to darker golden-red. Other <b>coloration,</b> mainly black, has been {{developed}} through cross-breeding and grading up from other breeds of cattle. In addition to altering natural <b>coloration,</b> other traits, such as polled (a genetic lack of horns), have been introduced through cross breeding. Angus cattle have been the dominant source of black and polled genes now present in graded-up high content Limousins found throughout the world.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the pioneers}} of {{research}} into animal <b>coloration,</b> Edward Bagnall Poulton classified the forms of protective <b>coloration,</b> {{in a way which}} is still helpful. He described: protective resemblance; aggressive resemblance; adventitious protection; and variable protective resemblance. These are covered in turn below.|$|E

50|$|The {{species can}} {{grow up to}} 9 cm. They have a {{fusiform}} body shape with silvery sides with blue and green lateral iridescent stripes and transparent fins.Their pectoral and pelvic fins are in the abdominal region. They have a pointed snout with a terminal mouth position. The caudal fin is angled inwards to make a forked shape. Breeding males have red <b>colorations</b> on their face, head, and behind the gills. Breeding females will also have minimal red <b>colorations.</b>|$|R
5|$|Surface gratings, {{consisting}} on ordered surface features due {{exposure of}} ordered muscle cells on cuts of meat. The structural <b>coloration</b> on meat cuts appears {{only after the}} ordered pattern of muscle fibrils is exposed and light is diffracted by the proteins in the fibrils. The <b>coloration</b> or wavelength of the diffracted light depends on the angle of observation and can be enhanced by covering the meat with translucent foils. Roughening the surface or removing water content by drying causes the structure to collapse, thus, the structural <b>coloration</b> to disappear.|$|E
5|$|There {{is strong}} {{evidence}} that spiders' <b>coloration</b> is camouflage that helps them to evade their major predators, birds and parasitic wasps, {{both of which have}} good color vision. Many spider species are colored so as to merge with their most common backgrounds, and some have disruptive <b>coloration,</b> stripes and blotches that break up their outlines. In a few species, such as the Hawaiian happy-face spider, Theridion grallator, several <b>coloration</b> schemes are present in a ratio that appears to remain constant, and this may {{make it more difficult for}} predators to recognize the species. Most spiders are insufficiently dangerous or unpleasant-tasting for warning <b>coloration</b> to offer much benefit. However, a few species with powerful venoms, large jaws or irritant hairs have patches of warning colors, and some actively display these colors when threatened.|$|E
5|$|Variety borealis has a {{slightly}} darker color scheme than the main species. The <b>coloration</b> in general is darker; the cap can vary from a bright apple red to a dark brick red with maturity, to almost purple in some instances. The pore surface has a varying <b>coloration</b> of orange red to red and becoming a dull brown red with age. The bruising <b>coloration</b> is a blue green and the spore print is olive brown. The distribution of variety borealis is relatively small, ranging from Michigan to the upper New England states. The similar distribution and <b>coloration</b> to Boletus carminiporus has caused the two to be confused. New molecular evidence shows that borealis is not closely related to Baorangia bicolor var. bicolor.|$|E

5|$|Reports of {{transient}} lunar phenomena {{range from}} foggy patches to permanent {{changes of the}} lunar landscape. Cameron classifies these as (1) gaseous, involving mists {{and other forms of}} obscuration, (2) reddish <b>colorations,</b> (3) green, blue or violet <b>colorations,</b> (4) brightenings, and (5) darkening. Two extensive catalogs of transient lunar phenomena exist, with the most recent tallying 2,254 events going back to the 6th century. Of the most reliable of these events, at least one-third come from the vicinity of the Aristarchus plateau.|$|R
5|$|While {{many animals}} {{are unable to}} {{synthesize}} carotenoid pigments to create red and yellow surfaces, the green and blue colours of bird feathers and insect carapaces are usually not produced by pigments at all, but by structural <b>coloration.</b> Structural <b>coloration</b> means the production of colour by microscopically-structured surfaces fine enough to interfere with visible light, sometimes in combination with pigments: for example, peacock tail feathers are pigmented brown, but their structure makes them appear blue, turquoise and green. Structural <b>coloration</b> can produce the most brilliant colours, often iridescent. For example, the blue/green gloss on the plumage of birds such as ducks, and the purple/blue/green/red colours of many beetles and butterflies are created by structural <b>coloration.</b> Animals use several methods to produce structural colour, {{as described in the}} table.|$|E

5|$|Bates {{put forward}} the {{hypothesis}} that the close resemblance between unrelated species was an antipredator adaptation. He noted that some species showed very striking <b>coloration,</b> and flew in a leisurely manner, almost as if taunting predators to eat them. He reasoned that these butterflies were unpalatable to birds and other insectivores, and were thus avoided by them. He extended this logic to forms that closely resembled such protected species, mimicking their warning <b>coloration</b> but not their toxicity.|$|E
5|$|Beddard's Animal <b>Coloration</b> {{is cited}} and {{discussed}} both by historians of science, and by practising scientists {{from a number}} of different fields. For example, the book illuminates the progress of Darwinism, camouflage research, sexual selection, mimicry and the debate on the purpose of animal <b>coloration</b> triggered by Abbott Thayer. These areas are described in turn below.|$|E
30|$|Interesting yellow <b>colorations</b> are {{obtained}} when x[*]=[*] 1.5 and 2.0 at 600 °C/ 12 and when x[*]=[*] 2.0 at 800 °C/ 1  h. In these samples that development yellow <b>colorations,</b> crystalline phase with monoclinic Cu 3 V 2 O 8 structure is detected.

This {{is the only}} crystalline phase detected at 800 °C in conditions of this study. The Mg (II) incorporated into this structure stabilizes this crystalline phase at temperatures higher than 780 °C (melting point of Cu 3 V 2 O 8).

40|$|Mathematical {{models of}} mimicry {{typically}} involve artificial prey species with fixed <b>colorations</b> or appearances; this enables {{a comparison of}} predation rates to demonstrate the level of protection a mimic might be afforded. Fruitful theoretical results have been produced using this method, {{but it is also}} useful to examine the possible evolutionary consequences of mimicry. To that end, we present individual-based evolutionary simulation models where prey <b>colorations</b> are free to evolve. We use the models to examine the effect of Batesian mimics on Muellerian mimics and mimicry rings. Results show that Batesian mimics can potentially incite Muellerian mimicry relationships and encourage mimicry ring convergence...|$|R
