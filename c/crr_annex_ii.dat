40|$|The authors analyze {{inequality}} in future carbon emissions using a group decomposition of the Gini index. Business-as-usual projections {{to the year}} 2100 for 135 countries show {{inequality in}} per capita emissions declining, but slowly. They also measure the impact on emissions levels and inequality of the Kyoto Protocol and other abatement proposals for <b>Annex</b> <b>II</b> (non-Eastern European high income) countries in 2010, focusing on their gap narrowing and reranking effects. Per capita emissions of <b>Annex</b> <b>II</b> and non-Annex II countries will probably not be substantially reranked unless the <b>Annex</b> <b>II</b> countries reduce their emissions by at least half (from 1990 levels) and emissions from non-Annex II countries continue growing unabated.
