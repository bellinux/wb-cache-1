5|$|In mid-1889, and at {{his sister}} Wil's request, Van Gogh painted several smaller {{versions}} of Wheat Field with <b>Cypresses.</b> The works are characterised by swirls and densely painted impasto, and include The Starry Night, in which <b>cypresses</b> dominate the foreground.|$|E
5|$|Although sawgrass and sloughs are the {{enduring}} geographical icons of the Everglades, other ecosystems {{are just as}} vital, and the borders marking them are subtle or nonexistent. Pinelands and tropical hardwood hammocks are located throughout the sloughs; the trees, rooted in soil inches above the peat, marl, or water, support a variety of wildlife. The oldest and tallest trees are <b>cypresses,</b> whose roots are specially adapted to grow underwater {{for months at a}} time. The Big Cypress Swamp is well known for its 500-year-old <b>cypresses,</b> though cypress domes can appear throughout the Everglades. As the fresh water from Lake Okeechobee makes its way to Florida Bay, it meets salt water from the Gulf of Mexico; mangrove forests grow in this transitional zone, providing nursery and nesting conditions for many species of birds, fish, and invertebrates. The marine environment of Florida Bay is also considered part of the Everglades because its sea grasses and aquatic life are attracted to the constant discharge of fresh water.|$|E
5|$|Keebach had {{the park}} {{designed}} {{in such a}} way that it would incorporate the landscape's native vegetation, mountain springs, and nearby rocky masses, in addition to foreign plant species brought in from the Mediterranean, both North and South America, as well as from East Asia. Today, the park still features more than 200 exotic tree and shrub species, including a wide variety of palm trees, laurels, <b>cypresses,</b> olive trees, and evergreen viburnum, among many others.|$|E

5|$|The host {{spectrum}} of the Amylostereaceae comprises several, partially very different genera of Coniferae. A.chailletii usually infests Pinaceae such as firs (Abies) and spruces (Picea), but also cedars (Cedrus) and Douglas firs (Pseudotsuga). A.areolatum has a similar host spectrum, which uses mainly firs, Japanese cedars (Cryptomeria), larches (Larix), spruces, pines (Pinus) and Douglas firs as hosts. While spruces dominate as hosts in the native habitat, this species {{is more common in}} pines on other locations. The host {{spectrum of}} A.laevigatum comprises Cupressaceae such as junipers (Juniperus) or <b>cypresses</b> (Cupressus) and the English yew (Taxus baccata). A.ferreum is, however, only common on neotropic yellowwoods (Podocarpus).|$|E
5|$|The Guimarota {{locality}} {{is located}} in the eastern Lusitanian Basin, {{which is part of the}} Iberian Meseta. The vertebrate-bearing Guimarota-strata was deposited in a brackish lagoon that periodically received both freshwater and saltwater influxes. Ecologically, the environment would have been akin to a modern mangrove swamp. Plants known from megafossils include the horsetails Equisetum and Schizoneura; the seed fern Caytonia; the cycad Otozamites; the araucaria Brachyphyllum; Ginkgo; and the charophyte algae Porochara. Additionally, plant families known only from pollen include lycopods, forked ferns, possible scaly tree ferns (which may be matoniaceans or dicksoniaceans instead), royal ferns, the seed fern Sphenopteris, <b>cypresses,</b> and pines. Most of the preserved organisms probably originated from around the swamp, although there may have been minimal transportation by water currents.|$|E

25|$|But {{although}} Van Gogh periodically {{defended the}} practices of Gauguin and Bernard, each time he inevitably repudiated them and continued with his preferred method of painting from nature. Like the impressionists he had met in Paris, especially Claude Monet, Van Gogh also favored working in series. He had painted his series of sunflowers in Arles, and he painted the series of <b>cypresses</b> and wheat fields at Saint-Rémy. The Starry Night belongs to this latter series, {{as well as to}} a small series of nocturnes he initiated in Arles.|$|E
25|$|His {{most popular}} quartet is his twelfth, the American, Op. 96. He also {{composed}} two piano quintets, both in A major, {{of which the}} second, Op. 81, is the better known. He left a Terzetto for two violins and viola (Op. 74); two piano quartets, a string sextet; Op. 48; and four piano trios, including the Piano Trio No. 4 (subtitled Dumky), Op. 90. He also wrote a set of Bagatelles, Op. 47, for the unusual instrumentation of two violins, cello, and harmonium, two waltzes for string quartet, {{and a set of}} twelve love songs arranged for quartet, taken from his set of 18 songs originally composed in 1865 entitled <b>Cypresses.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{planting of}} the garden {{is one of the}} Taj Mahal's remaining mysteries. The contemporary accounts mostly deal just with the architecture and only mention 'various kinds of fruit-bearing trees and rare aromatic herbs' in relation to the garden. Cypress trees are almost certainly to have been planted being popular similes in Persian poetry for the slender elegant stature of the beloved. By the end of the 18th century, Thomas Twining noted orange trees and a large plan of the complex suggests beds of various other fruits such as pineapples, pomegranates, bananas, limes and apples. The British, {{at the end of the}} 19th century thinned out a lot of the increasingly forested trees, replanted the <b>cypresses</b> and laid the gardens to lawns in their own taste.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The use of <b>cypress</b> (Taxodium species) for mulch boomed {{during the}} 1990 s, and its growth in {{popularity}} created {{concerns about the}} sustainability of <b>cypress</b> forests in the Southern United States. A combination of factors, including Hurricane Katrina, <b>cypress</b> harvesting practices, and the unique requirements for successful regeneration of <b>cypress</b> drew media attention and fueled debates over sustainability of <b>cypress</b> forests. The wood industry, Federal, State, and local governments, academia, environmental and conservation organizations, and retailers all became entangled in the issue. This eventually culminated in proposed legislation to place a moratorium on <b>cypress</b> harvesting and the decision {{by at least one}} large retailer to cease selling <b>cypress</b> mulch that was produced in Louisiana. These factors launched an intensive search for viable data about the <b>cypress</b> resource. Requests for Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) <b>cypress</b> data escalated. This paper describes the challenges FIA encountered in meeting the need to quantify trends in the <b>cypress</b> resource despite changes in inventory methods, forest-type defi nitions, plot design, processing algorithms, sample intensity, etc. The paper explains the constraints that were overcome to report region-wide <b>cypress</b> data and to develop a Southwide <b>cypress</b> factsheet. It also shows how FIA data was used to provide State level <b>cypress</b> trends, focusing on Florida as an example...|$|R
25|$|Van Gogh {{depicted}} the view {{at different times}} of day and under various weather conditions, including sunrise, moonrise, sunshine-filled days, overcast days, windy days, and one day with rain. While the hospital staff did not allow Van Gogh to paint in his bedroom, he was able there to make sketches in ink or charcoal on paper; eventually he would base newer variations on previous versions. The pictorial element uniting all of these paintings is the diagonal line coming in from the right depicting the low rolling hills of the Alpilles mountains. In fifteen of the twenty-one versions, cypress trees are visible beyond the far wall enclosing the wheat field. Van Gogh telescoped the view in six of these paintings, most notably in F717 Wheat Field with <b>Cypresses</b> and The Starry Night, bringing the trees closer to the picture plane.|$|E
25|$|The jillayeh (the {{embroidered}} {{outer garment}} for wedding costume) used in Bayt Dajan was {{quite similar to}} those of Ramallah. The difference was in decoration and embroidery. Typical for Bayt Dajan would be a motif consisting of two triangles, mirror-faced, with or without an embroidered stripe between them, and with inverted <b>cypresses</b> at the edges. A jillayeh from Bayt Dajan (c. 1920s) is exhibited at the British Museum. The caption notes that the dress would be worn by the bride at the final ritual of wedding week celebrations, a procession known as 'going to the well'. Accompanied by all the village women in their finest dress, the bride would go to the well to present a tray of sweets to the guardian of the well and fill her pitcher with water to ensure good fortune for her home. There are also several items from Bayt Dajan and the surrounding area is in the Museum of International Folk Art (MOIFA) collection at Santa Fe, United States.|$|E
500|$|The basin for The Big Cypress {{receives}} {{on average}} [...] {{of water in}} the rainy season. Most of The Big Cypress sits atop a bedrock covered by a thin layer of limestone that contains quartz, creating a sandy soil that hosts a variety of vegetation. The majority of trees are bald cypress (Taxodium distichum) and not true <b>cypresses</b> (Cupressaceae). <b>Cypresses</b> are conifers that are uniquely adapted to thrive in flooded conditions, with buttressed trunks and root projections that protrude out of the water, called [...] "knees".|$|E

40|$|Responses of bald <b>cypress</b> (Taxodium distichum) and pond <b>cypress</b> (Taxodium ascendens) saplings in {{photosynthesis}} {{and growth}} to long-term periodic submergence in situ in the hydro-fluctuation {{zone of the}} Three Gorges Dam Reservoir (TGDR) were studied. Water treatments of periodic deep submergence (DS) and moderate submergence (MS) in situ were imposed on 2 -year-old bald <b>cypress</b> and pond <b>cypress</b> saplings. The effects of periodic submergence on photosynthesis and growth were investigated after 3 years (i. e. 3 cycles) compared to a control (i. e. shallow submergence, abbreviated as SS). Results showed that pond <b>cypress</b> had no significant change in net photosynthetic rate (Pn) in response to periodic moderate and deep submergence {{in contrast to a}} significant decrease in Pn of bald <b>cypress</b> under both submergence treatments, when compared to that of SS. Ratios of Chlorophyll a/b and Chlorophylls/Carotenoid of pond <b>cypress</b> were significantly increased in periodic moderate submergence and deep submergence, while bald <b>cypress</b> showed no significant change. Diameter at breast height (DBH) and tree height of both species were significantly reduced along with submergence depth. Relative diameter and height growth rates of the two species were also reduced under deeper submergence. Moreover, bald <b>cypress</b> displayed higher relative diameter growth rate than pond <b>cypress</b> under deep submergence mainly attributed to higher productivity of the larger crown area of bald <b>cypress.</b> When subjected to deep subergence, both species showed significant reduction in primary branch number, while in moderate submergence, bald <b>cypress</b> but not pond <b>cypress</b> showed significant reduction in primary branch number. These results indicate that both bald <b>cypress</b> and pond <b>cypress</b> are suitbale candidates for reforestation in the TGDR region thanks to their submergence tolerance characteristics, but bald <b>cypress</b> can grow better than pond <b>cypress</b> under deep submergence overall...|$|R
