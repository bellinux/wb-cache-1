40|$|Objective: Define a {{representation}} and a learning algorithm {{to learn from}} financial news. Motivation: Extracting automatically relevant information from wire news is of increasing importance {{in a variety of}} areas. We are developing state of the art learning techniques to extract information from on-line <b>CNN</b> <b>financial</b> <b>news.</b> Previous Work: Difficulties in extracting quantitative knowledge from text have traditionally prevented that field from evolving beyond particular applications. McCallum [2] introduces a set of tools based on bag of words and information gain to extract symbolic information from text documents. Freitag et al [1] present a framework that combines bag of words with web structure information for classification purposes. Despite the significant experimental results they obtain, their approach is restricted to averyspecifictype of web pages. Attempts to provide a link between Machine Learning and linguistics to take advantage of semantic and syntactic information have been made (for example [3]) although no direct application has been implemented yet. Approach: In our initial approach we plan to use techniques such as “bag of words ” [2], and benchmark it with focus on different parts of the information (Title, body, HTMLtags). Revision of String Kernel approaches and application of alternate hierarchical structures is a second step we are planning to undertake. The ultimate goal is to quantify information in financial text news, possibly incorporating knowledge from the field of linguistics, for feature extraction and classification purposes. Difficulty: Despite the large amount of news available, processing of text corpora with machine learning is still an open field. Extracting meaningful features from text corpora, summarizing semantic and syntactic information, yet reducing redundancy and ambiguity is the key item to be addressed by most oftheapplications in text recognition. Impact: Aframework able to quantify text news would dramatically decrease complexity of any classification task requiring up to date information...|$|E

40|$|Motivated {{by recent}} {{financial}} crises significant research {{efforts have been}} put into studying contagion effects and herding behaviour in financial markets. Much less {{has been said about}} influence of <b>financial</b> <b>news</b> on <b>financial</b> markets. We propose a novel measure of collective behaviour in <b>financial</b> <b>news</b> on the Web, News Cohesiveness Index (NCI), and show that it {{can be used as a}} systemic risk indicator. We evaluate the NCI on financial documents from large Web news sources on a daily basis from October 2011 to July 2013 and analyse the interplay between financial markets and financially related news. We hypothesized that strong cohesion in <b>financial</b> <b>news</b> reflects movements in the financial markets. Cohesiveness is more general and robust measure of systemic risk expressed in news, than measures based on simple occurrences of specific terms. Our results indicate that cohesiveness in the <b>financial</b> <b>news</b> is highly correlated with and driven by volatility on the financial markets...|$|R
