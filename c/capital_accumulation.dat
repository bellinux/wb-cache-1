The objective is {{to determine whether the}} sharp decline in leverage over the past fifteen years represents the over-utilization of capital or a rational response to changing market conditions.

We conclude that measured capital over-utilization represents a true inefficiency which adversely affects firm financial performance. We also find that the decline in leverage was primarily attributable to capital gains on investments and provide evidence that insurers are reluctant to pay out <b>capital</b> <b>accumulations</b> as dividends, even if it means overutilizing capital.

40|$|Although the Civil War has {{attracted}} {{a great deal of}} scholarly attention, little is known about how different wartime experiences of soldiers influenced their civilian lives after the war. This paper examines how military rank and duty of Union Army soldiers while in service affected their post-service occupational mobility.

Among the recruits who were unskilled workers at the time of enlistment, commissioned and non-commissioned officers {{were much more likely to}} move up to a white-collar job by 1880. Similarly, unskilled recruits who had served on white-collar military duties were more likely to enter a white-collar occupation by 1880. The higher occupational mobility of higher-ranking soldiers is likely to have resulted from disparate human <b>capital</b> <b>accumulations</b> offered by their military positions rather than from their superior abilities. ...|$|R

Using a dynamic panel of 46 Sub-Saharan African countries over the period 1981 - 2007, we show that HIV/AIDS has negative, significant and long-lasting effects on demography and growth.

25|$|Jane Jacobs' 1961 book The Death and Life of Great American Cities was a {{sustained}} critique of urban planning {{as it had}} developed within Modernism and marked a transition from modernity to postmodernity in thinking about urban planning (Irving 1993, 479). However, the transition from Modernism to Postmodernism is often said to have happened at 3:32pm on 15 July in 1972, when Pruitt Igoe; a housing development for low-income people in St. Louis designed by architect Minoru Yamasaki, which had been a prize-winning version of Le Corbusier's 'machine for modern living' was deemed uninhabitable and was torn down (Irving 1993, 480). Since then, Postmodernism has involved theories that embrace and aim to create diversity, and it exalts uncertainty, flexibility and change (Hatuka & D'Hooghe 2007). Postmodern planning aims to accept pluralism and heighten awareness of social differences in order to accept and bring to light the claims of minority and disadvantaged groups (Goodchild 1990). It {{is important to note}} that urban planning discourse within Modernity and Postmodernity has developed in different contexts, even though they both grew within a capitalist culture. Modernity was shaped by a capitalist ethic of Fordist-Keynesian paradigm of mass, standardized production and consumption, while postmodernity was created out of a more flexible form of <b>capital</b> <b>accumulation,</b> labor markets and organisations (Irving 1993, 60). Also, there is a distinction between a postmodernism of 'reaction' and one of 'resistance'. A postmodernism of 'reaction' rejects Modernism and seeks to return to the lost traditions and history in order to create a new cultural synthesis, while Postmodernity of 'resistance' seeks to deconstruct Modernism and is a critique of the origins without necessarily returning to them (Irving 1993, 60). As a result of Postmodernism, planners are much less inclined to lay a firm or steady claim to there being one single 'right way' of engaging in urban planning and are more open to different styles and ideas of 'how to plan' (Irving 474).|$|E
500|$|Three {{families}} of new growth models challenged neoclassical models. The first challenged {{the assumption of}} previous models that the economic benefits of capital would decrease over time. These early new growth models incorporated positive externalities to <b>capital</b> <b>accumulation</b> where one firm's investment in technology generates spillover benefits to other firms because knowledge spreads. The second focused {{on the role of}} innovation in growth. These models focused on the need to encourage innovation through patents and other incentives. A third set, referred to as the [...] "neoclassical revival", expanded the definition of capital in exogenous growth theory to include human capital. This strain of research began with Mankiw, Romer, and Weil (1992), which showed that 78% of the cross-country variance in growth could be explained by a Solow model augmented with human capital.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the lack}} of American aid, the East European [...] "command economies", {{including}} Poland, made some progress in bridging the historically existing wealth gap with the market economy driven Western Europe. Because of the <b>capital</b> <b>accumulation</b> the Polish national income grew in real terms by over 76% and the agricultural and industrial production more than doubled between 1947 and 1950. The economic transition and industrialization were accompanied and made possible by massive social transformations, as peasants migrated and were converted into city dwelling working class (1.8 million between 1946 and 1955) and the country went {{through a period of}} rapid urbanization. The influx of cheap labor and the availability of the Soviet market facilitated an accumulation of resources, despite low productivity and insufficient investment in new technologies. The centrally planned socialist economies of Eastern Europe did relatively better than the West in terms of the post-war years growth, only to sustain economic damage later, especially after the 1973 oil crisis. However, the rise in living standards caused by the earlier industrial dynamics was not comparable to that in the West.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the optimal inflation rate in an overlapping-generations economy in which (i) aggregate output is constrained by a standard neoclassical production function with diminishing marginal products for both capital and labor and (ii) the transaction-facilitating services of money are represented by means of a money-in-the-utility-function specification. With monetary injections provided by lump-sum transfers, the famous Chicago Rule prescription for monetary growth is necessary for Pareto optimality but a competitive equilibrium may fail to be Pareto optimal with that rule in force because of <b>capital</b> over <b>accumulation.</b> The latter possibility does not exist, however, if the economy includes an asset that is productive and non-reproducible [...] i. e., if the economy is one with land. As this conclusion is independent of the monetary aspects of the model, it is argued that the possibility of <b>capital</b> over <b>accumulation</b> should not be regarded as a matter of theoretical concern, {{even in the absence of}} government debt, intergenerational altruism, and social security systems or other "social contrivances.

500|$|The {{notion that}} {{transport}} costs and trade barriers hinder {{the expansion of}} the market is age-old. Nurkse emphasised that tariff duties, exchange controls, import quotas and other non-tariff barriers to trade are major obstacles to promoting international cooperation in exporting and importing. More specifically, due to high transport costs between nations, producers do not have an incentive to export their commodities. As a result, the amount of <b>capital</b> <b>accumulation</b> remains small. To address this problem, the United Nations produced a report in 1951 with solutions for underdeveloped countries. They suggested that they can expand their markets by forming customs unions with neighbouring countries. Also, they can adopt the system of preferential taxation or even abolish customs duties altogether. The logic was that once customs duties are removed, transport costs will fall. Consequently, prices will fall and thus the demand will rise. However, Nurkse, as an export pessimist, did not agree with this view. Export pessimism is a trade theory which is governed by the idea of [...] "inward looking growth" [...] as opposed to [...] "outward looking growth".

While it is evident that Essai influenced Quesnay, to what degree remains controversial. There is evidence that Quesnay did not fully understand, or was not completely aware of, Cantillon's theories. Many of Quesnay's economic beliefs were elucidated previously in Essai, but Quesnay did reject a number of Cantillon's premises, including the scarcity of land and Cantillon's population theory. Also, Quesnay recognised the scarcity of capital and <b>capital</b> <b>accumulation</b> as a prerequisite for investment. Nevertheless, Cantillon was considered the [...] "father of physiocracy" [...] by Henry Higgs, due to his influence on Quesnay.

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{a case for}} historiographic discontinuity between the Ottoman and Turkish Republican eras as the principal cause for the failure to develop a sociology of the Turkish bourgeoisie. Indeed, understanding the mechanisms governing the reconversion of resources {{and the distribution of}} privileges requires a distinction between the old and the new, because there is a legitimate time for wealth. Such a sociology is essential to understanding the major social, economic and political changes which have occurred in Turkey over the past thirty years. The analysis of the uses, even if sometimes contradictory, of the concept of bourgeoisie in contemporary Turkish historiography opens new prospects. This paper shows that a complete renewal of Turkish elites has not occurred, since a segment of this group is described by historians as possessing the attributes of a “bourgeoisie”. Studies of the Turkish bourgeoisie for both the final years of the Ottoman Empire and the Republican period indicate a number of points of continuity.
