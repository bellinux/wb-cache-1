Finite element simulation of the crushing test was done using LS-DYNA software. Results of the two analyses were compared and found in good agreement.

40|$|We present {{evidence}} of topological surface states in beta-Ag 2 Te through first-principles calculations and periodic quantum interference effect in single crystalline nanoribbon. Our first-principles calculations show that beta-Ag 2 Te is a topological insulator with a gapless Dirac cone with strong anisotropy. To experimentally probe the topological surface state, we synthesized high quality beta-Ag 2 Te nanoribbons and performed electron transport measurements. The coexistence of pronounced Aharonov-Bohm oscillations and weak Altshuler-Aronov-Spivak oscillations clearly demonstrates coherent electron transport {{around the perimeter}} of beta-Ag 2 Te nanoribbon and therefore the existence of metallic surface states, which is further supported by the temperature dependence of resistivity for beta-Ag 2 Te nanoribbons with different <b>cross</b> <b>section</b> <b>areas.</b> Highly anisotropic topological surface state of beta-Ag 2 Te suggests that the material is a promising material for fundamental study and future spintronic devices.

Compared to cylindrical columns having corresponding lengths and volumes, the conical columns with 10 degrees opening angle were superior in column efficiency, resolution and the maximum peak concentration at column outlet; the loadability of conical column was improved 30 - 40 % on injection volume and 50 - 60 % on sample mass, respectively, over cylindrical columns.
