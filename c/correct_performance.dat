Immediate-execute tasks involve a response {{as soon as}} a particular cue is noticed, while delayed-execute tasks involve delays between the perception of the relevant cue and the performance of the intended action. Delayed-execute tasks more commonly occur in real life when circumstances of a situation prevent intermediate action once the cue has been perceived. Research was performed by McDaniel et al. (2004), in which participants completed tasks involving various delays and interruptions between cues and responses. It was demonstrated that <b>correct</b> <b>performance</b> suffered when there was a delay or interruption during a task. However, it was further shown that the use of reminders for participants eliminated the effects of the interruption task.|$|E
25|$|Oldenberg (1894) {{surmised that}} the concept of Ṛta {{originally}} arose in the Indo-Aryan period from a consideration of the natural order of the world and of the occurrences taking place within it as doing so with a kind of causal necessity. Both Vedic Ṛta and Avestan aša were conceived of as having a tripartite function which manifested itself in the physical, ethical and ritual domains. In the context of Vedic religion, those features of nature which either remain constant or which occur on a regular basis were seen to be a manifestation of the power of Ṛta in the physical cosmos. In the human sphere, Ṛta was understood to manifest itself as the imperative force behind both the moral order of society as well as the <b>correct</b> <b>performance</b> of Vedic rituals. The notion of a universal principle of natural order is by no means unique to the Vedas, and Ṛta has been compared to similar ideas in other cultures, such as Ma'at in Ancient Egyptian religion, Moira and the Logos in Greek paganism, and the Tao.|$|E

We find it resolvable in all cases into the following elements: Certain individuals have a given attribute; an individual or individuals resemble the former in certain other attributes; therefore they resemble them also in the given attribute. This type of ratiocination does not claim, like the syllogism, to be conclusive from the mere form of the expression; nor can it possibly be so. That one proposition does or does not assert the very fact which was already asserted in another, may appear from {{the form of the}} expression, that is, from a comparison of the language; but when the two propositions assert facts which are bona fide different, whether the one fact proves the other or not can never appear from the language, but must depend on other considerations. Whether, from the attributes in which Socrates resembles those men who have heretofore died, it is allowable to infer that he resembles them also in being mortal, is a question of Induction; and is to be decided by the principles or canons which we shall hereafter recognize as tests of the <b>correct</b> <b>performance</b> of that great mental operation.|$|E

If, therefore, the argument be admissible {{in the case of}} Socrates, we are at liberty, once for all, to treat the possession of the attributes of man as a mark, or satisfactory evidence, of the attribute of mortality. This we do by laying down the universal proposition, All men are mortal, and interpreting this, as occasion arises, in its application to Socrates and others. By this means we establish a very convenient division of the entire logical operation into two steps; first, that of ascertaining what attributes are marks of mortality; and, secondly, whether any given individuals possess those marks. And it will generally be advisable, in our speculations on the reasoning process, to consider this double operation as in fact taking place, and all reasoning as carried on in the form into which it must necessarily be thrown to enable us to apply to it any test of its <b>correct</b> <b>performance.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This study {{demonstrates}} {{the importance of}} managing the risk of performance ratio guarantees, which typically are applicable to most commercial PV projects. A qualitative assessment of the performance metrics has shown multiple performance parameters, which could influence the Performance Ratio. Alternative performance metrics, including the Temperature <b>Corrected</b> <b>Performance</b> Ratio and the Weather <b>Corrected</b> <b>Performance</b> Ratio were evaluated {{by means of a}} quantitative analysis. The Temperature– and Weather <b>Corrected</b> <b>Performance</b> Ratios have both demonstrated the capability of reducing the inter-annual and seasonal variance experienced with the conventional Performance Ratio. The respective performance metrics were further calculated from multiple years of meteorological data in order to construct a statistical distribution for each performance metric. The resulting probability distribution function was then used to determine the probable risk percentiles for each of the respective performance metrics and compared with the separately calculated performance metrics referring to a long-term mean data set. It was demonstrated that the long-term mean derived performance parameters did present a risk for overstating the facilities’ performance. The risk was mitigated by referring to the multi-year’s P 90 percentile instead, irrespective of which performance metric was applicable. M. Ing. (Engineering Management...|$|R

To {{reduce the number of}} memory accesses for maximum a posteriori (MAP) decoding, this paper proposes an approximate reverse calculation of backward metrics which can be implemented with simple computational complexity. Simulation results show that the proposed method applied to W-CDMA standard reduces the access rate of the backward metric memory by 90 % without degrading error <b>correcting</b> <b>performance.</b> A prototype turbo decoder based on the proposed reverse calculation achieves 30 % power reduction compared to the conventional decoder. 1...|$|R
