In the demonstrated network, a spectrum-sliced fiber amplifier light source was used to transmit 15 downstream channels operating at 500 Mb/s. The 155 -Mb/s upstream channels used 1. 5 -m LED’s. In addition, an erbium-doped fiber amplifier was used at the central office to compensate the slicing losses of low-power LED’s. The crosstalk, caused by using WGR’s for both <b>multiplexing</b> and <b>demultiplexing</b> channels, was suppressed to a negligible level by using two types of bandpass filters.

40|$|The next {{generation}} satellite communication networks will provide multimedia services supporting high bit rate, mobility, ATM, and TCP/IP. In these cases, the satellite technology {{will act as}} the internetwork infrastructure of future global systems and assuming a global wireless system, no distinctions will exist between terrestrial and satellite communications systems, {{as well as between}} fixed and 3 G mobile networks. In order for satellites to be successful, they must handle bursty traffic from users and provide services compatible with existing ISDN infrastructure, narrowcasting/multicasting services not offered by terrestrial ISDN, TCP/IP-compatible services for data applications, and point-to-point or point-to-multipoint on-demand compressed video services. This calls for onboard processing payloads capable of frequency <b>multiplexing</b> and <b>demultiplexing</b> and interference suppression. This thesis introduces a new class of oversampled complex modulated filter banks capable of providing frequency <b>multiplexing</b> and <b>demultiplexing.</b> Under certain system constraints, the system can handle all possible shifts of different user signals and provide variable bandwidths to users. Furthermore, the aliasing signals are attenuated by the stopband attenuation of the channel filter thus ensuring the approximation of the perfect reconstruction property as close as desired. Study of the system efficient implementation and its mathematical representation shows that the proposed system has superiority over the existing approaches for Bentpipe payloads from the flexibility, complexity, and perfect reconstruction points of view. The system is analyzed in both SISO and MIMO cases. For the MIMO case, two different scenarios for frequency <b>multiplexing</b> and <b>demultiplexing</b> are discussed. To verify the results of the mathematical analysis, simulation results for SISO, two scenarios of MIMO, and effects of the finite word length on the system performance are illustrated. Simulation results show that the system can perform frequency <b>multiplexing</b> and <b>demultiplexing</b> and the stopband attenuation of the prototype filter controls the aliasing signals since the filter coefficients resolution plays the major role on the system performance. Hence, the system can approximate perfect reconstruction property by proper choice of resolution...|$|R

40|$|Many {{high-bandwidth}} analog {{communication systems}} require {{the processing of}} a large number of analog signals such as CATV distribution networks and antenna routing subsystems. Fiber optics technology has the capability to meet the requirements of these applications. Thus far, the vast majority of research on fiber-optic analog communications has concentrated on the modulation of continuous wave (CW) lasers for encoding data, such as sub-carrier multiplexing (SCM). However, since the signals are <b>multiplexed</b> and <b>demultiplexed</b> in the electrical domain, the maximum number of channels is limited in such a system due to intermodulation distortion caused by nonlinearities in the electrical-optical-electrical conversion process. In contrast, the techniques presented in the work are based on the <b>multiplexing</b> and <b>demultiplexing</b> of signals in the optical domain, thereby reducing nonlinear interactions between channels. In our approach, each analog signal is encoded as an envelope onto an optical pulse train. By using ultrashort optical pulses to sample the analog waveforms, multiple channels can be interleaved and combined resulting in TDMA frames of pulsed analog data. The individual channels can then be extracted from the aggregate pulse stream with the use of an ultrafast optical gating device, such as the terahertz optical asymmetric demultiplexer...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—An applications-oriented {{review of}} optical para-metric {{amplifiers}} in fiber communications is presented. The {{emphasis is on}} parametric amplifiers in general and single pumped parametric amplifiers in particular. While a theoretical framework based on highly efficient four-photon mixing is provided, {{the focus is on}} the intriguing applications enabled by the parametric gain, such as all-optical signal sampling, time-de-multiplexing, pulse generation, and wavelength conversion. As these amplifiers offer high gain and low noise at arbitrary wavelengths with proper fiber design and pump wavelength allocation, they are also candidate enablers to increase overall wavelength-division-multiplexing system capacities similar to the more well-known Raman amplifiers. Similarities and distinctions between Raman and parametric amplifiers will also be addressed. Since the first fiber-based parametric amplifier experiments providing net continuous-wave gain in the for the optical fiber communication applications interesting 1. 5 - m region were only conducted about two years ago, there is reason to believe that substantial progress may be made in the future, perhaps involving “holey fibers ” to further enhance the nonlinearity and thus the gain. This together with the emergence of practical and inexpensive high-power pump lasers may in many cases prove fiber-based parametric amplifiers to be a desired implementation in optical communication systems.
