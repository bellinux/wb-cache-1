50|$|Jeff - No {{footage of}} Jeff's work is shown apart from Jeff using the {{services}} of a <b>chop</b> <b>saw.</b>|$|E
50|$|In this challenge, {{the contestants}} must build a shelf that will house {{a set of}} speakers, their {{electrical}} panel, {{as well as the}} two batteries that will be storing the power to their sheds. To protect the batteries from dust, doors must be installed where they are housed. The contestants also have access to a <b>chop</b> <b>saw</b> (although a crew member will do the cutting on the <b>chop</b> <b>saw).</b> Meanwhile, the floor is to be cleaned in preparation for installing the floor later.|$|E
5000|$|Standard {{miter saw}} - A power tool {{designed}} for straight cross cuts on you lumber {{at a range}} of angles (unlike a <b>chop</b> <b>saw</b> which can only cut 90 degrees to the board). Commonly used to create 45Â° degree straight cuts for framing.|$|E
50|$|Participants in {{the annual}} Lumberjack World Championships compete {{in a variety of}} {{lumberjack}} games such as log rolling, <b>chopping,</b> <b>sawing,</b> and chainsaw events.|$|R
50|$|Machine vises {{are mounted}} on drill presses, {{grinding}} machines and milling machines. Abrasive <b>chop</b> <b>saws</b> {{have a special}} type of machine vise built into the saw. Some hobbyists use a machine vise as a bench vise because of the low cost and small size.|$|R
50|$|Special {{band saws}} {{designed}} for cutting metal have hardened blades and a feed mechanism for even cutting. Abrasive cut-off saws, {{also known as}} <b>chop</b> <b>saws,</b> are similar to miter saws but with a steel cutting abrasive disk. Cutting torches can cut very large sections of steel with little effort.|$|R
50|$|An {{abrasive}} saw, {{also known}} as a cut-off saw or <b>chop</b> <b>saw,</b> is a power tool which is typically used to cut hard materials, such as metals, tile, and concrete. The cutting action is performed by an abrasive disc, similar to a thin grinding wheel. Technically speaking this is not a saw, as it does not use regularly shaped edges (teeth) for cutting.|$|E
50|$|The contestants must {{install a}} nailing edge around their {{windows and doors}} in order to install trim and baseboards. Again, all contestants {{have access to a}} <b>chop</b> <b>saw,</b> {{although}} Jeff and Terry are the only ones seen using it (with everyone else cutting using their mitre box and their crosscut saw - none of the contestants have a proper miter saw).|$|E
5000|$|Mitre saw [...] - [...] often {{referred}} to as a large backsaw (20-30 inches or 60-90 cm) used either in a wooden or metal mitre box or in a metal frame which allowed cutting mitres of any specified angle. Note that not all mitre saws are backsaws, and the electric mitre saw (or <b>chop</b> <b>saw)</b> has largely taken its place today.|$|E
50|$|On many {{construction}} sites {{you will find}} workers using face shields to protect their eyes and face from flying debris or sparks. Many tools that involve cutting and working with metal recommend {{the use of a}} face shield. Examples would be workers that are using welding equipment or metal <b>chop</b> <b>saws.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Sliding compound-miter saw - Sliding {{adds the}} {{radial arm saw}} feature {{of being able to}} move the saw head back and forth {{increasing}} the board size that can be cross cut. Without the sliding feature the cut is a straight pull down feature (like <b>chop</b> <b>saws).</b> With the sliding feature engaged the user pulls the head forward, turns on the saw and pushes the blade back across the lumber.|$|R

50|$|Purchased as a {{yearling}} for $4,100 by Barclay K. Douglas of Oyster Bay, New York https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=i7UKAAAAIBAJ&sjid=hU0DAAAAIBAJ&pg=3732,2439979&dq=empire+city+chop+chop, Chop <b>Chop</b> <b>saw</b> his racing career {{cut short}} {{due to an}} injury. From eleven starts, he won four times and finished {{out of the money}} once. His most important wins came in the 1942 Endurance Handicap at Bowie Race Track in Bowie, Maryland and the 1943 Empire City Handicap at New York's Jamaica Racetrack, in which he beat Princequillo.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the final}} deliberations, Geoff puts Johnnie as his {{candidate}} for being worst, due to having finished nothing, and forcing the experts {{to intervene in}} the group challenge. Andrew, however, picks Brian M to be the worst because of his wall. In the end, though, the fact that Brian M managed to salvage his bathroom floor in his spare time made the difference; in his own words, Johnnie went [...] "from hero to goat". On the other hand, Angie did find time to finish her workbench, and the mistake in the bathroom floor could be easily overlooked. Though she did smash her way out of demolition, she did manage to finish all the challenges, so she is named the most improved. Johnnie's extra lesson was the use of the <b>chop</b> <b>saw.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A {{circular}} saw {{is a tool}} for cutting many materials such as wood, masonry, plastic, or metal and may be hand-held or mounted to a machine. In woodworking the term [...] "{{circular saw}}" [...] refers specifically to the hand-held type and the table saw and <b>chop</b> <b>saw</b> are other common forms of circular saws. [...] "Skil saw" [...] has become a generic trademark for conventional hand-held circular saws. Circular saw blades are specially designed for each particular material {{they are intended to}} cut and in cutting wood are specifically designed for making rip-cuts, cross-cuts, or a combination of both. Circular saws are commonly powered by electricity, but may be powered by a gasoline engine or a hydraulic motor which allows it to be fastened to heavy equipment, eliminating the need for a separate energy source.|$|E
6000|$|... "They're {{a little}} {{larger than the}} average," [...] her {{companion}} explained, [...] "Still, that's {{the kind of thing}} you run up against when you buy land to start a ranch or clear the ground for a mine. <b>Chopping,</b> <b>sawing</b> up, splitting those giants doesn't fill one with languorous dreams; the only dreams that our axmen indulge in materialize. It's an unending, bracing struggle. There are leagues and leagues of trees, shrouding the valleys in a shadow that has lasted since the world was young; but you see the dawn of a wonderful future breaking in as the long ranks go down." ...|$|R
50|$|Timbersports {{take place}} in both Fall and Spring semesters, with teams {{practicing}} every month of the school year. Events include pole climbing, log birling, <b>chopping,</b> splitting, <b>sawing,</b> pulp toss, ax-throw, and pack-board relay.|$|R
50|$|The Albany Timber Carnival {{was held}} in Albany, Oregon from 1941 to 2000. The event {{returned}} in 2008 and featured competitive logrolling, wood <b>chopping,</b> cross-cut <b>sawing,</b> and hot saw. Chainsaw carving artwork was also displayed.|$|R
50|$|The Handyman Race - The new annual {{tradition}} {{begins with}} a race between the four handymen, as they build a stud wall and a triangular piece of plywood, as the final parts to the ice hut. The only rule in this race is that all cuts must be made before the frame can be put together. Brian's meticulous checking earns him first place, followed by Johnnie, despite early troubles with the safety on the <b>chop</b> <b>saw.</b> Angie claims third, after making several mistakes early on and {{having a hard time}} catching up. However, by far the biggest story is Eric's behaviour in this challenge; he starts to put the frame together early in violation of the challenge rules, and when Andrew reminds him of this, Eric angrily smashes the frame apart with a hammer (nearly hitting Andrew, and sending debris flying toward the nominators) before storming out of the challenge altogether, blaming his actions on Michelle's presence.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{original}} [...] "countersink challenge", Ruth had beaten Jeff in sinking a nail the fastest by the slightest of margins. During the previous challenge, as Ruth was waiting on Jeff to finish using the <b>chop</b> <b>saw,</b> Jeff challenges {{her to a}} rematch. In this rematch (with Andrew, the experts, the nominators, the crew, and their fellow contestants all watching - Justin even holding up a makeshift sign cheering Ruth on, with Candace, Jaime, Terry, and Jill taking up the other front-row seats), the premise is the same, except that Jeff and Ruth will take turns hammering in their single nail to avoid the need for video replay. The rematch begins clearly in Ruth's favor as Jeff wastes turns lightly tapping his hammer (in preparing for a real forceful hit) while his forceful hits often bent the nail (forcing him to reset) or missed the nail completely. Ruth's slow-and-steady approach wins the match after 13 strokes.|$|E
5000|$|Group Challenge: The Window - The next {{part of the}} ice shed to be built is a {{frame for}} a window, to be led by Angie. After Angie is given a private lesson on framing and the {{dimensions}} for the challenge, she puts Brian M to work as the [...] "measurer", Brian P and Eric as the [...] "cutters", and herself and Johnnie as the [...] "assemblers". However, it quickly becomes apparent that Brian P could not measure angles (and tries to silence Brian M {{when he tries to}} put in his opinion), and the fact that things would go faster if Johnnie (who had set up the <b>chop</b> <b>saw</b> that he learned two days ago in his extra lesson) was doing the cutting (as he could cut faster than either Brian P or Eric with circular saws). Despite Brian M being the measurer, the entire group was slowed down due to mismeasurement (largely due to the group having ignored him); it takes the entire group four hours to finish the frame to Angie's specifications. Johnnie notes after the challenge that back home, a contractor he had hired took four hours to assemble an entire shed.|$|E
50|$|They eat insects, {{small rodents}} and lizards. Using their chelicerae, they can <b>chop</b> and <b>saw</b> their victimâs flesh. Their jaws are {{equipped}} to shear hair and quills from their prey {{as well as}} cut through skin and the thin bones of small birds. They then utilise digestive juices to liquefy the flesh of their prey so they can suck it into their bodies.|$|R
5000|$|As with Maroochydore, {{the use of}} the Dunethin Rock {{locality}} as a {{place of}} leisure began with the local population. From the early 1900s it became a popular destination for picnics, fishing and enjoying the view from the rock summit. The Yandina-Maroochy Progress Association celebrated its first anniversary on the lake in 1905 and a held a [...] "Grand Aquatic Sports" [...] event on Easter Monday 1907. The Maroochy River School functioned as the community hall from 1911 until the School of Arts was built in 1914, providing a permanent structure for community occasions and fundraising events. During 1915 the Maroochy District Patriotic Sports meeting was held with land and water events that included wood <b>chopping,</b> <b>sawing,</b> running and motor boat races. A [...] "Grand Excursion" [...] to Dunethin Lake in aid of the Wounded Soldiers Fund was held in 1916. In the same year, a team of Brisbane swimmers visited Dunethin rock to launch the Maroochy River and District Swimming Club.|$|R
2500|$|Increasingly from 1750 to 1850, {{industries}} developed {{throughout the}} watershed, using local waterways to provide power and carry away waste. The area [...] supported nine mills, producing flour, timber, paper and cloth. They are identified by Dr. Mary Hough as Plumly Mill (first owned by William Harmer), Fulling Mill (owned by Andrew and Mary Ambler), Thomson's Mill, Reiff Mill, Wertsner Mill, Hague Mill, Burk Mill, a Silk Mill, and a Clover and <b>Chopping</b> and <b>Saw</b> Mill. [...] However, as steam power replaced water {{power in the}} 1870s and 1880s, the mills were unable to compete, and were abandoned.|$|R
50|$|The Wall - During the {{demolition}} challenge, {{two of the}} bedroom's walls were also taken down. In its place {{on one of them}} will be a faux log finish. To do this, foam must be applied onto the wall before the faux wall pieces (roughly-hewn lumber) are attached. Then, parging must be used to fill the gaps between the wall pieces. Neither Eric nor Brian P had managed to buy the washers needed to attach the foam to the wall (Brian P also lacked screws); they make do with construction adhesive instead. At the start of Day 3, Brian M threatens to leave rehab over {{the fact that he was}} not taught the use of a table saw or <b>chop</b> <b>saw,</b> even though neither are necessary for the project, and are not used by anyone else. The shouting match between Brian M and Andrew gets so intense Eric (working within earshot) forces them both to shut up; telling them that they were being a distraction. Eric, though, passes this challenge despite the distraction. Angie fails due to having assembled her log pieces vertically (leaving nothing to support the parging, upon that realization she opts to use spray foam insulation instead), as does Johnnie. The Brians both fail due to having large gaps in their log pieces (Brian M also getting the cement-based parging all over his wood), so much so that parging will never cover the foam adequately.|$|E
5000|$|Each July, the Connecticut Agricultural Fair {{is held in}} town. It is {{also home}} to the Goshen players. Each Labor Day weekend the Goshen Fair takes place at the Goshen Fair Grounds on Route 63 south just outside the center of town. Similar in nature to the Agricultural Fair having farm animal {{judgement}} shows, competition and contest in log <b>chopping,</b> log <b>sawing,</b> haybale throwing and the like. There are food, art, photography, baked goods, and craft contests. Rides for children, vendors of craft goods and food vendor are also present. Attendance over the three days can range up to 50,000 people ...|$|R
60|$|Frank thought {{hard for}} a minute or two. There was no doubt that ranching, when it {{included}} clearing land, as it generally seemed to do, was remarkably arduous work. In the case of a man with little money it evidently meant almost incessant toil, for it was only by persistent effort that one could <b>chop</b> and <b>saw</b> up the great trees and grub the stumps out. Still, he was growing fond of it, and, what was more, he was conscious that he was gaining a resolution and muscular vigor that in all probability he would never have acquired in the crowded cities.|$|R
50|$|The Lumberjack World Championships {{are held}} {{annually}} in Hayward, Wisconsin. The event began in 1960 and is {{held at the}} Lumberjack Bowl. There are 21 events {{for both men and}} women to compete for over $50,000 in prize money. Contestants come from the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. The events include <b>sawing,</b> <b>chopping,</b> logrolling, and climbing to test the strength and agility of over 100 competitors.|$|R
5000|$|Blahyi {{claimed to}} a South African Star {{reporter}} that he [...] "met Satan regularly {{and talked to}} him" [...] and that from age of 11 to 25 he took part in monthly human sacrifices. In his account of a typical battle Blahyi claimed,"So, before leading my troops into battle, we would get drunk and drugged up, sacrifice a local teenager, drink the blood, then strip down to our shoes and go into battle wearing colorful wigs and carrying imaginary purses we'd looted from civilians. We'd slaughter anyone we <b>saw,</b> <b>chop</b> their heads off and use them as soccer balls. We were nude, fearless, drunk yet strategic. We killed hundreds of people--so many I lost count." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1882 Leather {{successfully}} {{applied for}} a colonial wine and beer licence and the store was replaced with the Sawyers Valley Hotel. Even after the railway was finished, the Hotel attracted locals from nearby sawmills. The Hotel and the recreation ground adjacent served as a local meeting place for mill workers, travelers, road boards, progress associations, historical societies and political rallies. It also quickly became the gathering place for numerous sporting clubs, rifle clubs, cricket teams, cycling and motorcycle clubs. Sports meetings were promoted by subsequent publicans, including JH Kendall who was licensee for 21 years. Unsurprisingly, given the areaâs history of timber milling, it {{was the focus of}} annual competitions in wood <b>chopping,</b> timber <b>sawing,</b> and tug-of war, with teams from nearby mills and hotels in Chidlow and Mount Helena. [...] In 1937 the old timber hotel was demolished and the new single storey brick hotel, designed by William Bennett, erected on the same site featuring saloon and public bars, lounges, a dining room and ten bedrooms, kitchens and bathrooms. During the Second World War the hotel featured in the local newspapers for incidents involving American servicemen. American soldiers and sailors were arrested for being drunk and fighting, and their girlfriends arrested for living âidle and disorderly livesâ and prostitution.|$|R
50|$|As {{a general}} rule, tools which {{work well for}} rip cutting do not work well for crosscutting. Most woodworkers thus have a table saw, which is used for rip cutting, and a {{separate}} <b>chop</b> or miter <b>saw,</b> which is used for crosscutting. Crosscut power-saws should never be used for ripping a board because it is very dangerous. Circular saw blades designed for rip cutting have {{a smaller number of}} larger teeth than similar blades designed for cross cutting. There are combination blades for table saws {{that can be used for}} ripping and cross cutting but should not be used for non through cuts such as dados and rabbets. If you use a radial arm saw to rip you need a blade with a negative hook angle for the teeth to keep the saw from lifting the board off the saw and kicking back.|$|R
60|$|The {{antecedent}} {{to these}} feminine pronouns {{had a pair}} of blue eyes, which at that moment were applied to a large round hole in the shutter of the upper window. The shutter was closed, not for any penal reasons, but because only the opposite window had the luxury of glass in it: the weather was not warm, and a round hole four inches in diameter served all the purposes of observation. The hole was, unfortunately, a little too high, and obliged the small observer to stand on a low stool of a rickety character; but Tessa would have stood a long while in a much more inconvenient position for the sake of seeing a little variety in her life. She had been drawn to the opening at the first loud tones of the strange voice speaking to Monna Lisa; and darting gently across her room every now and then to peep at something, she continued to stand there until the wood had been <b>chopped,</b> and she <b>saw</b> Baldassarre enter the outhouse, as the dusk was gathering, and seat himself on the straw.|$|R
50|$|Prior {{to meeting}} Robin at the Channel 5 launch party in 1997, Stuart Warren Hill had begun {{working on the}} Natural Rhythms Trilogy, a {{collaborative}} effort with Coldcut and Greenpeace. Stuart approached Greenpeace asking for use of their stock footage of wildlife and logging operations and in return Greenpeace could use the finished project in their campaigns and presentations. The first video was 1997âs Frog Jam, which created a rhythmic structure out of short clips of water dripping, frog leaping and tribal drumming and chanting. This was soon followed by Natural Rhythm and Timber. Natural Rhythm featured insects, birds and other wildlife {{as well as a}} tribesman playing a flute like instrument. Each video employed increasingly more complex mixing and splicing techniques culminating with the award-winning Timber. Its tone is more plaintively political, opening with majestic images of the sunset over a forest of immensely beautiful trees then quickly shifting with a clap of thunder to a telegraph button punching out the dots and dashes of a Morse code SOS distress call. Images of powerful circular <b>saws,</b> <b>chopping</b> axes, and huge, buzzing chainsaws soon follow. The picture then distorts and images of the indigenous animals appear to the singing of a mournful native woman. The anti-deforestation message is quite clear even before the industrial machinery makes its appearance {{towards the end of the}} track. Timber won the award for Best Editing Video Musique in France in 1998 and appeared on Coldcutâs 1997 release Let Us Play!.|$|R
