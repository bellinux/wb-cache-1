2500|$|Gap {{analysis}} identifies {{gaps between}} the optimized allocation and integration of the inputs (resources), and the current allocation-level. This may reveal areas that can be improved. Gap analysis involves determining, documenting, and approving the difference between business requirements and current capabilities. Gap analysis naturally flows from benchmarking and from other assessments.

2500|$|Not all {{critiques of}} the {{podcasting}} format {{have been as}} equivocal. PopMatters observed that podcasting is a new distribution model, very different from television as a distribution model because it gives users access to media {{and the freedom to}} listen to episodes of a long-form story while doing other things. The reviewer applauded the focus on long-form journalism and added, [...] "Suddenly you feel like the full promise of podcasting has just been unleashed. That long-form narrative nonfiction is really the way to best leverage the potential of podcasting as a distribution model." [...] A Wall Street Journal critic observed: [...] "podcasts have slipped marketers' minds. ZenithOptimedia, for example, put out a forecast predicting 0% growth for the medium after years of positive momentum." [...] Discussing the economics of podcast advertising, New York Magazine noted that the personal nature of the podcast format allows higher advertising rates: [...] "CPM (the cost to an advertiser per thousand impressions, a standard ad-industry unit) was between $20 and $45. <b>Compare</b> <b>that</b> to a typical radio CPM (roughly $1 to $18) or network TV ($5 to $20) or even a regular old web ad ($1 to $20), and the podcast wins." ...|$|E
2500|$|Morbidity can {{be major}} (myocardial infarction, pneumonia, {{pulmonary}} embolism, renal failure/insufficiency, postoperative cognitive dysfunction and allergy) or minor (minor nausea, vomiting, readmission). [...] There is usually overlap in the contributing factors {{that lead to}} morbidity and mortality between {{the health of the}} patient, the surgery being performed and the anesthetic.

[...] These statistics can also be compared to the first such study on mortality in anesthesia from 1954, which reported a rate of death from all causes at 1:75 and a rate attributed to anesthesia alone at 1:2680. [...] Direct comparisons between mortality statistics cannot reliably be made over time and across countries because of differences in the stratification of risk factors, however, there is evidence that anesthetics have made a significant improvement in safety but to what degree is uncertain.|$|E

2500|$|He {{achieved}} renown {{by a great}} experiment made in 1834 – {{the measurement}} of the velocity of electricity in a wire. He cut the wire at the middle, to form a gap which a spark might leap across, and connected its ends to the poles of a Leyden jar filled with electricity. Three sparks were thus produced, one {{at each end of}} the wire, and another at the middle. He mounted a tiny mirror on the works of a watch, so that it revolved at a high velocity, and observed the reflections of his three sparks in it. The points of the wire were so arranged that if the sparks were instantaneous, their reflections would appear in one straight line; but the middle one was seen to lag behind the others, because it was an instant later. The electricity had taken a certain time to travel from the ends of the wire to the middle. This time was found by measuring the amount of lag, and comparing it with the known velocity of the mirror. Having got the time, he had only to <b>compare</b> <b>that</b> with the length of half the wire, and he could find the velocity of electricity. His results gave a calculated velocity of 288,000 miles per second, i.e. faster than what we now know to be the speed of light (...) , but were nonetheless an interesting approximation.|$|E
