5|$|Around 1900, A. P. Strohmenger and Oscar Kjellberg {{released}} the first <b>coated</b> electrodes.

In 1912, Strohmenger released a heavily <b>coated</b> electrode, but high cost and complex production methods prevented these early electrodes from gaining popularity. In 1927, {{the development of an}} extrusion process reduced the cost of coating electrodes while allowing manufacturers to produce more complex coating mixtures designed for specific applications. In the 1950s, manufacturers introduced iron powder into the flux coating, making it possible to increase the welding speed.|$|E
