5|$|AML which {{arises from}} a {{pre-existing}} myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or myeloproliferative disease (so-called secondary AML) has a worse prognosis, as does treatment-related AML arising after chemotherapy for another previous malignancy. Both of these entities {{are associated with}} a high rate of unfavorable <b>cytogenetic</b> abnormalities.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to several}} taxonomic {{revisions}} by Russell Mittermeier, Colin Groves, and others, {{the number of}} recognized lemur species has grown from 33 species and subspecies in 1994 to approximately 100 in 2008. With continuing <b>cytogenetic</b> and molecular genetic research, as well as ongoing field studies, particularly with cryptic species such as mouse lemurs, the number of recognized lemur species is likely to keep growing. However, the rapid {{increase in the number}} of recognized species has had its critics among taxonomists and lemur researchers. Since classifications ultimately depend on the species concept used, conservationists often favor definitions that result in the splitting of genetically distinct populations into separate species to gain added environmental protection. Others favor a more thorough analysis.|$|E
5|$|The EFS gene {{is one of}} {{more than}} 100 of the genes located in a centromeric 10.21 Mb “minimal {{critical}} region” on Chromosome 14 that are highly expressed in gestational choriocarcinoma. The EFS mRNA was also identified as differentially expressed in two of the three groups of glioblastoma multiforme as identified by gene expression profiles (GEPs). EFS was differentially expressed in the GEP1 and GEP3 groups, which were associated with worse prognosis, with more significant <b>cytogenetic</b> abnormalities and genomic instabilities observed in this groups.|$|E
5|$|During {{her time}} at Missouri, McClintock {{expanded}} her {{research on the}} effect of X-rays on maize cytogenetics. McClintock observed the breakage and fusion of chromosomes in irradiated maize cells. She was also able to show that, in some plants, spontaneous chromosome breakage occurred in the cells of the endosperm. Over the course of mitosis, she observed that the ends of broken chromatids were rejoined after the chromosome replication. In the anaphase of mitosis, the broken chromosomes formed a chromatid bridge, which was broken when the chromatids moved towards the cell poles. The broken ends were rejoined in the interphase of the next mitosis, and the cycle was repeated, causing massive mutation, which she could detect as variegation in the endosperm. This breakage–rejoining–bridge cycle was a key <b>cytogenetic</b> discovery for several reasons. First, it showed that the rejoining of chromosomes was not a random event, and second, it demonstrated a source of large-scale mutation. For this reason, it remains an area of interest in cancer research today.|$|E
5|$|McClintock's <b>cytogenetic</b> {{research}} {{focused on}} developing ways to visualize and characterize maize chromosomes. This particular {{part of her}} work influenced a generation of students, as it was included in most textbooks. She also developed a technique using carmine staining to visualize maize chromosomes, and showed {{for the first time}} the morphology of the 10 maize chromosomes. This discovery was made because she observed cells from the microspore as opposed to the root tip. By studying the morphology of the chromosomes, McClintock was able to link specific chromosome groups of traits that were inherited together. Marcus Rhoades noted that McClintock's 1929 Genetics paper on the characterization of triploid maize chromosomes triggered scientific interest in maize cytogenetics, and attributed to her 10 of the 17 significant advances in the field that were made by Cornell scientists between 1929 and 1935.|$|E
5|$|The {{specific}} type of postremission therapy is individualized based on a person's prognostic factors (see above) and general health. For good-prognosis leukemias (i.e. inv(16), t(8;21), and t(15;17)), people will typically undergo an additional three to five courses of intensive chemotherapy, known as consolidation chemotherapy. For people {{at high risk of}} relapse (e.g. those with high-risk cytogenetics, underlying MDS, or therapy-related AML), allogeneic stem cell transplantation is usually recommended if the person is able to tolerate a transplant and has a suitable donor. The best postremission therapy for intermediate-risk AML (normal cytogenetics or <b>cytogenetic</b> changes not falling into good-risk or high-risk groups) is less clear and depends on the specific situation, including the age and overall health of the person, the person's values, and whether a suitable stem cell donor is available.|$|E
25|$|Lenalidomide is also {{approved}} for transfusion-dependent anemia due to low or intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic syndromes {{associated with a}} deletion 5q <b>cytogenetic</b> abnormality with or without additional <b>cytogenetic</b> abnormalities in the U.S., Canada, Switzerland, Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia, Israel and several Latin American countries, while marketing authorization application is currently being evaluated {{in a number of}} other countries.|$|E
25|$|An {{official}} {{diagnosis of}} Roberts syndrome relies on <b>cytogenetic</b> {{testing of the}} peripheral blood.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cytogenetic</b> {{abnormalities}} can {{be detected}} by conventional cytogenetics, a FISH panel for MDS, or virtual karyotype.|$|E
25|$|Fluorescent in situ {{hybridization}} (FISH) {{refers to}} using fluorescently labeled probe to hybridize to <b>cytogenetic</b> cell preparations.|$|E
25|$|A full {{account of}} a {{karyotype}} may therefore include the number, type, shape and banding of the chromosomes, {{as well as other}} <b>cytogenetic</b> information.|$|E
25|$|Initially, M. smithii {{was thought}} to only {{reproduce}} asexually because no evidence of male individuals had been found. This led to M. smithii being recognized as the first fungus-growing ant species to reproduce via thelytokous parthenogenesis, where females, the workers and reproductive queens, are produced asexually. The <b>cytogenetic</b> mechanism of thelytoky is either apomixis (mitotic parthenogenesis) or automixis with central fusion and low recombination rates. Automixis with central fusion is the <b>cytogenetic</b> mechanism that was recorded in other asexual ant species.|$|E
25|$|Interphase {{fluorescence}} {{in situ hybridization}} testing, usually ordered {{together with}} conventional <b>cytogenetic</b> testing, offers rapid detection of several chromosome abnormalities associated with MDS, including del 5q, -7, +8, and del 20q.|$|E
25|$|Presence {{of two or}} more phenotypical {{abnormalities}} can aid {{a diagnosis}} of CMML in the absence of identifying <b>cytogenetic</b> or dysplastic features. These can include the expression of CD56 and/or CD2, or under-expression of HLA-DR.|$|E
25|$|CMML-2 has {{a reduced}} overall {{survival}} {{as compared with}} CMML-1, with median survivals of 15 and 20 months, respectively. Myeloproliferative CMML (>13x109 monocytes/L) has a reduced survival compared with myelodysplastic CMML. A platelet count of <100 x109/L reduces overall survival. A haemoglobin level of <10g/dL has a reduced overall survival. Some <b>cytogenetic</b> abnormalities have implications on the prognosis of CMML. Normal karyotypes or the single loss of the Y chromosome have low risk prognoses. Trisomy 8, chromosome 7 abnormalities and complex karyotypes comprise a high risk group. Other <b>cytogenetic</b> abnormalities have intermediate prognoses. Somatic mutations in genes such as ASXL1 and EZH2 are associated with poor prognosis.|$|E
25|$|A 2011 followup of 832 {{patients}} using imatinib who {{achieved a}} stable <b>cytogenetic</b> response found an overall survival rate of 95.2% after 8 years, {{which is similar}} to the rate in the general population. Fewer than 1% of patients died because of leukemia progression.|$|E
25|$|Through its School of Health Professions, {{the cancer}} center also offers bachelor's degrees in nine allied health fields, {{including}} clinical laboratory science, <b>cytogenetic</b> technology, cytotechnology, diagnostic imaging, histotechnology, medical dosimetry, molecular genetic technology and radiation therapy. The school {{also offers a}} master of science in diagnostic genetics program.|$|E
25|$|Cyto{{genetics}} is {{a branch}} of genetics that is concerned with how the chromosomes relate to cell behaviour, particularly to their behaviour during mitosis and meiosis. Techniques used include karyotyping, analysis of G-banded chromosomes, other <b>cytogenetic</b> banding techniques, as well as molecular cytogenetics such as fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and comparative genomic hybridization (CGH).|$|E
25|$|Carrier {{testing for}} Roberts {{syndrome}} requires prior {{identification of the}} disease-causing mutation in the family. Carriers for the disorder are heterozygotes due to the autosomal recessive nature of the disease. Carriers are also not at risk for contracting Roberts syndrome themselves. A prenatal diagnosis of Roberts syndrome requires an ultrasound examination paired with <b>cytogenetic</b> testing or prior identification of the disease-causing ESCO2 mutations in the family.|$|E
25|$|At {{this point}} in time, ESCO2 is the only known gene to cause Roberts {{syndrome}} mutations. Also, all individuals that {{have been diagnosed with}} Roberts syndrome by <b>cytogenetic</b> techniques have also had ESCO2 mutations. Confirmation of a Roberts syndrome diagnosis requires detection of the characteristic chromosomal abnormalities (PCS and HR) or the identification of two ESCO2 mutations that have been linked to Roberts syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Analysis of banded {{chromosomes}} is done at {{a microscope}} by a clinical laboratory specialist in cytogenetics (CLSp(CG)). Generally 20 cells are analyzed which {{is enough to}} rule out mosaicism to an acceptable level. The results are summarized and given to a board-certified cytogeneticist for review, and to write an interpretation {{taking into account the}} patients previous history and other clinical findings. The results are then given out reported in an International System for Human <b>Cytogenetic</b> Nomenclature 2009 (ISCN2009).|$|E
25|$|The French-American-British (FAB) {{classification}} system {{was published in}} 1976 to classify the leukaemias. It placed CMML {{into the category of}} MDS, along with the refractory anaemia, refractory anaemia with ring sideroblasts, refractory anaemia with excess blasts and refractory anaemia with excess blasts in transformation. The system does have clinical utility; however factors such as <b>cytogenetic</b> status are not within the remit of the classification. For this reason, many disease entities in these groups show a great deal of heterogeneity.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, {{a group of}} pathologists and clinicians working under the World Health Organization (WHO) {{modified}} this classification, introducing several new disease categories and eliminating others. Most recently, the WHO has evolved a new classification scheme (2008) which is based more on genetic findings. However, morphology of the cells in the peripheral blood, bone marrow aspirate, and bone marrow biopsy are still the screening tests used to decide which classification is best and which <b>cytogenetic</b> aberrations may be related.|$|E
25|$|Phodopus {{species have}} {{developed}} into important laboratory organisms. They provide an excellent model {{system for the}} evolution of hormonal control of photoperiod and seasonal physiological and behavioral changes, sociality, biparental offspring care, and behavioral ecology. Because Phodopus species have small chromosome numbers with easily distinguished chromosomes, they have been used for <b>cytogenetic</b> and cancer research. Because of their extreme cold tolerance, they have been used to study thermoregulation. One population of laboratory animals developed both glycosuria and ketonuria independently and {{has been used as a}} model for diabetes mellitus.|$|E
25|$|The {{biodiversity}} of the Chironomidae {{often goes}} unnoticed {{because they are}} notoriously difficult to identify and ecologists usually record them by species groups. Each morphologically distinct group comprises a number of morphologically identical (sibling) species {{that can only be}} identified by rearing adult males or by <b>cytogenetic</b> analysis of the polytene chromosomes. Polytene chromosomes were originally observed in the larval salivary glands of Chironomus midges by Balbiani in 1881. They form through repeated rounds of DNA replication without cell division, resulting in characteristic light and dark banding patterns which can be used to identify inversions and deletions which allow species identification.|$|E
25|$|Development {{of cancer}} often {{involves}} multiple alterations of the cellular genome (Knudson hypothesis). Human retinoblastoma {{is a well}} studied example of a cancer type where mitotic nondisjunction can contribute to malignant transformation: Mutations of the RB1 gene, which is located on chromosome 13 and encodes the tumor suppressor retinoblastoma protein, can be detected by <b>cytogenetic</b> analysis in many cases of retinoblastoma. Mutations of the RB1 locus in one copy of chromosome 13 are sometimes accompanied by loss of the other wild-type chromosome 13 through mitotic nondisjunction. By this combination of lesions, affected cells completely lose expression of functioning tumor suppressor protein.|$|E
25|$|The {{chromosomal}} {{defect in}} the Philadelphia chromosome is a translocation, in which parts of two chromosomes, 9 and 22, swap places. The result is that a fusion gene is created by juxtaposing the ABL1 gene on chromosome 9 (region q34) to {{a part of the}} BCR (breakpoint cluster region) gene on chromosome 22 (region q11). This is a reciprocal translocation, creating an elongated chromosome 9 (termed a derivative chromosome, or der 9), and a truncated chromosome 22 (the Philadelphia chromosome, 22q-). In agreement with the International System for Human <b>Cytogenetic</b> Nomenclature (ISCN), this chromosomal translocation is designated as t(9;22)(q34;q11). The symbol ABL is derived from Abelson, the name of a leukemia virus which carries a similar protein.|$|E
25|$|Both annual and {{perennial}} teosinte species occur. Z. diploperennis and Z. perennis are perennial, {{while all}} other species are annual. All species are diploid (n=10) {{with the exception}} of Z. perennis, which is tetraploid (n=20). The different species and subspecies of teosinte can be readily distinguished based on morphological, <b>cytogenetic,</b> protein, and DNA differences and on geographic origin. The two perennials are sympatric and very similar and some consider them to be one species. What many consider to be the most puzzling teosinte is Z. m. huehuetenangensis, which combines a morphology rather like Z. m. parviglumis with many terminal chromosome knobs and an isozyme position between the two sections. Considered to be phenotypically the most distinctive, as well as the most threatened, teosinte is Zea nicaraguensis. This teosinte thrives in flooded conditions along 200 m of a coastal estuarine river in northwest Nicaragua.|$|E
25|$|Multicolor FISH and {{the older}} {{spectral}} karyotyping are molecular <b>cytogenetic</b> techniques used to simultaneously visualize all the pairs of chromosomes in an organism in different colors. Fluorescently labeled probes for each chromosome are made by labeling chromosome-specific DNA with different fluorophores. Because there are {{a limited number of}} spectrally distinct fluorophores, a combinatorial labeling method is used to generate many different colors. Fluorophore combinations are captured and analyzed by a fluorescence microscope using up to 7 narrow-banded fluorescence filters or, in the case of spectral karyotyping, by using an interferometer attached to a fluorescence microscope. In the case of an mFISH image, every combination of fluorochromes from the resulting original images is replaced by a pseudo color in a dedicated image analysis software. Thus, chromosomes or chromosome sections can be visualized and identified, allowing for the analysis of chromosomal rearrangements.|$|E

500|$|The {{single most}} {{important}} prognostic factor in AML is cytogenetics, or the chromosomal structure of the leukemic cell. Certain <b>cytogenetic</b> abnormalities are associated with very good outcomes (for example, the (15;17) translocation in acute promyelocytic leukemia). About half of people with AML have [...] "normal" [...] cytogenetics; they fall into an intermediate risk group. A number of other <b>cytogenetic</b> abnormalities are known to associate with a poor prognosis and {{a high risk of}} relapse after treatment.|$|E
500|$|Specific <b>cytogenetic</b> {{abnormalities}} can {{be found}} in many people with AML; the types of chromosomal abnormalities often have prognostic significance. The chromosomal translocations encode abnormal fusion proteins, usually transcription factors whose altered properties may cause the [...] "differentiation arrest". For example, in acute promyelocytic leukemia, the t(15;17) translocation produces a PML-RARα fusion protein which binds to the retinoic acid receptor element in the promoters of several myeloid-specific genes and inhibits myeloid differentiation.|$|E
500|$|The genomic {{coordinates}} of the NEDD9 gene are 6:11,183,530-11,382,580 in the GRCh37 assembly, or 6:11,183,298-11,382,348 in the GRCh38 assembly. The gene {{is on the}} minus strand. The <b>cytogenetic</b> {{location is}} 6p25-p24, based on the nomenclature developed by the Human Genome Organization (HUGO) gene nomenclature committee (HGNC). NEDD9 is the HGNC approved symbol. Official IDs are 7733 (HGNC), 4739 (Entrez Gene), and ENSG00000111859 (Ensembl). [...] CAS-L, CASL, HEF1, dJ49G10.2, dJ761I2.1, CAS2, CASS2 are alias symbols. The NEDD9 gene is conserved in Rhesus monkeys, dogs, cows, mice, rats, chickens, zebrafish, and frogs. [...] In vertebrates, it {{is a member of}} a 4-gene family, with the other paralogous genes known as BCAR1 (p130Cas), EFS (Sin), and CASS4 (HEPL) ...|$|E
500|$|Over {{the past}} two decades, the number of {{recognized}} lemur species has more than tripled according to some experts. [...] In 1994, 32distinct species were named in {{the first edition of}} Conservation International's field guide, Lemurs of Madagascar, and 68were described in the 2nd edition, published in 2006. [...] In December 2008, Russell Mittermeier, Colin Groves, and other experts co-wrote an article in the International Journal of Primatology classifying 99species and subspecies. [...] In late 2010, the 3rd edition of Lemurs of Madagascar listed 101taxa. [...] The number of lemur species is likely to continue growing in the coming years, as field studies, <b>cytogenetic</b> and molecular genetic research continues, particularly on cryptic species, such as mouse lemurs, which cannot be distinguished visually.|$|E
500|$|A <b>cytogenetic</b> (chromosome) {{study by}} Nicole Andriaholinirina, etal. {{published}} in 2005 added strong {{support to the}} species status of the small-toothed sportive lemur by demonstrating that its karyotype was distinct from all other sport lemur species. The species has 24chromosomes (2n=24); the autosomal pairs (not sex chromosomes) include eight that are meta- or submetacentric (where chromosome arms are equal or unequal in length, respectively) and three smaller acrocentric pairs (with the shorter chromosome arm difficult to observe). Both the X and Y chromosomes are acrocentric. [...] The study also showed that the small-toothed sportive lemur was the sportive lemur species most genetically distinct from the weasel sportive lemur, despite their similar appearance. [...] A total of 18 chromosomal rearrangements distinguished the two species, indicating that if the two shared the same range, hybrids would be either completely sterile or suffer greatly reduced fertility.|$|E
500|$|In 1930, McClintock was {{the first}} person to {{describe}} the cross-shaped interaction of homologous chromosomes during meiosis. The following year, McClintock and Creighton proved the link between chromosomal crossover during meiosis and the recombination of genetic traits. They observed how the recombination of chromosomes seen under a microscope correlated with new traits. Until this point, it had only been hypothesized that genetic recombination could occur during meiosis, although it had not been shown genetically. McClintock published the first genetic map for maize in 1931, showing the order of three genes on maize chromosome 9. [...] This information provided necessary data for the crossing-over study she published with Creighton; they also showed that crossing-over occurs in sister chromatids as well as homologous chromosomes. In 1938, she produced a <b>cytogenetic</b> analysis of the centromere, describing the organization and function of the centromere, as well as the fact that it can divide.|$|E
