50|$|<b>Call</b> <b>forwarding,</b> or call diversion, is a {{telephony}} {{feature of}} some telephone switching systems which redirects {{a telephone call}} to another destination, which may be, for example, a mobile telephone, voicemail box or another telephone number where the desired called party is available. <b>Call</b> <b>forwarding</b> was invented by Ernest J. Bonanno. In North America, the forwarded line usually rings once to remind the customer using <b>call</b> <b>forwarding</b> that the call is being redirected. More consistently, the forwarded line indicates its condition by stutter dial tone. <b>Call</b> <b>forwarding</b> typically can redirect incoming calls to any other domestic telephone number, but {{the owner of the}} forwarded line must pay any toll charges for forwarded calls. <b>Call</b> <b>forwarding</b> is often enabled by dialing *72 followed by the telephone number to which calls should be forwarded. Once someone answers, <b>call</b> <b>forwarding</b> is in effect. If no one answers or the line is busy, the dialing sequence must be repeated to effect <b>call</b> <b>forwarding.</b> <b>Call</b> <b>forwarding</b> is disabled by dialing *73. This feature requires a subscription from the telephone company. Also available in some areas is Remote Access to <b>call</b> <b>forwarding,</b> which permit the control over <b>call</b> <b>forwarding</b> from telephones other than the subscriber's telephone. VOIP and cable telephone systems also often allow <b>call</b> <b>forwarding</b> to be set up and directed via their web portals.|$|E
