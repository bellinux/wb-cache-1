40|$|OBJECTIVES: This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to investigate the}} overlap between <b>chronic</b> pelvic <b>pain,</b> dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, irritable bowel syndrome, and genitourinary symptoms {{in the community and}} also to examine associated investigations and diagnoses. STUDY DESIGN: A postal questionnaire was used to survey 3916 women aged 18 through 49 randomly selected from the Oxfordshire Health Authority Register. The number of responders was 2304 (74 % of 3106 questionnaire recipients). <b>Chronic</b> pelvic <b>pain</b> was described as recurrent or constant pelvic pain of > or = 6 months' duration unrelated to periods, intercourse, or pregnancy. Case patients (n = 483) were subgrouped as follows: (1) <b>chronic</b> pelvic <b>pain</b> only, (2) <b>chronic</b> pelvic <b>pain</b> and irritable bowel syndrome, (3) <b>chronic</b> pelvic <b>pain</b> and genitourinary symptoms, and (4) <b>chronic</b> pelvic <b>pain,</b> genitourinary symptoms, and irritable bowel syndrome. RESULTS: Half the women with <b>chronic</b> pelvic <b>pain</b> also had either genitourinary symptoms or irritable bowel syndrome, or both. Prevalences of dysmenorrhea and dyspareunia were higher among women with <b>chronic</b> pelvic <b>pain</b> (81 % and 41 %, respectively) than among women without <b>chronic</b> pelvic <b>pain</b> (58 % and 14 %, respectively); rates did not differ among the <b>chronic</b> pelvic <b>pain</b> subgroups. Irritable bowel syndrome and stress were the most common diagnoses received by patients with <b>chronic</b> pelvic <b>pain,</b> but 50 % had never received a diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: There is substantial overlap between <b>chronic</b> pelvic <b>pain</b> and other abdominal symptoms in the community.

40|$|<b>Chronic</b> pelvic <b>pain</b> is {{a common}} and {{significant}} disorder of women. Often the etiology of <b>chronic</b> pelvic <b>pain</b> is not clear. <b>Chronic</b> pelvic <b>pain</b> {{is a common}} problem and presents a major challenge to health care providers because of its unclear etiology, complex natural history, and poor response to therapy.

5|$|Pain is classed as acute (short term) {{or chronic}} (long term). <b>Chronic</b> <b>pain</b> may be {{continuous}} with occasional sharp rises in intensity (flares), or intermittent: periods of painlessness interspersed with periods of pain. Despite pain being well controlled by long-acting drugs or other treatment, flares may occasionally be felt; {{this is called}} breakthrough pain, and is treated with quick-acting analgesics.|$|E
5|$|Parts of {{the pain}} {{sensation}} and processing system may not function properly; creating the feeling of pain when no outside cause exists, signaling too much pain from a particular cause, or signaling pain from a normally non-painful event. Additionally, the pain modulation mechanisms may not function properly. These phenomena are involved in <b>chronic</b> <b>pain.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of people with <b>chronic</b> <b>pain</b> notice memory and attention difficulties. Objective psychological testing has found problems with memory, attention, verbal ability, mental flexibility and thinking speed.

50|$|Depending on the {{sensation}} associated with neuropathic pain, {{it may be}} considered as acute or <b>chronic.</b> Acute neuropathic <b>pain</b> is associated with burning, squeezing, throbbing, shooting, or electric shock sensations that resolve.

5|$|Ulceration episodes usually occur about 3–6 {{times per}} year. However, severe disease is {{characterized}} by virtually constant ulceration (new lesions developing before old ones have healed) and may cause debilitating <b>chronic</b> <b>pain</b> and interfere with comfortable eating. In severe cases, this prevents adequate nutrient intake leading to malnutrition and weight loss.|$|E
5|$|Behavioral therapy may {{be useful}} for <b>chronic</b> <b>pain.</b> There are several types available, {{including}} operant conditioning, which uses reinforcement to reduce undesirable behaviors and increase desirable behaviors; cognitive behavioral therapy, which helps people identify and correct negative thinking and behavior; and respondent conditioning, which can modify an individual's physiological response to pain. Medical providers may develop an integrated program of behavioral therapies. The evidence is inconclusive as to whether mindfulness-based stress reduction reduces chronic back pain intensity or associated disability, although it suggests that it {{may be useful}} in improving the acceptance of existing pain.|$|E
5|$|Exercise {{appears to}} be useful for {{preventing}} low back pain. Exercise is also probably effective in preventing recurrences in those with pain that has lasted more than six weeks.

There is little to no evidence that back belts are any more helpful in preventing low back pain than education about proper lifting techniques. Shoe insoles do not help prevent low back pain.|$|E
40|$|The main {{objectives}} {{of the current study}} was i) to prospectively examine if <b>chronic</b> musculoskeletal <b>pain</b> in parents is associated with risk of <b>chronic</b> musculoskeletal <b>pain</b> in their adult offspring, and ii) to assess if these parent-offspring associations are modified by offspring body mass index and leisure time physical activity. We used data on 4, 742 adult offspring linked with their parents who participated in the population-based HUNT Study in Norway in 1995 - 97 and in 2006 - 08. Family relations were established through the national Family Registry. A Poisson regression model was used to estimate relative risk (RR) with 95 % confidence interval (CI). In total, 1, 674 offspring (35. 3 %) developed <b>chronic</b> musculoskeletal <b>pain</b> during the follow-up period of approximately 11 years. Both maternal (RR: 1. 26, 95 % CI: 1. 03, 1. 55) and paternal <b>chronic</b> musculoskeletal <b>pain</b> (RR: 1. 29, 95 % CI: 1. 06, 1. 57) was associated with increased risk of offspring <b>chronic</b> musculoskeletal <b>pain.</b> Compared to offspring of parents without <b>chronic</b> musculoskeletal <b>pain,</b> the adverse effect of parental pain was somewhat stronger among offspring who reported a low (RR: 1. 82, 95 % CI: 1. 32, 2. 52) versus high (RR: 1. 32, 95 % CI: 0. 95, 1. 84) level of leisure time physical activity. Offspring of parents with <b>chronic</b> musculoskeletal <b>pain</b> and who were classified as obese had more than twofold increased risk (RR: 2. 33, 95 % CI: 1. 68, 3. 24) of <b>chronic</b> musculoskeletal <b>pain</b> compared to normal weight offspring of parents without pain. In conclusion, parental <b>chronic</b> musculoskeletal <b>pain</b> is positively associated with risk of <b>chronic</b> musculoskeletal <b>pain</b> in their adult offspring.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{our study}} was to {{evaluate}} factors predisposing or related to <b>chronic</b> pelvic <b>pain</b> in women, and whether those factors allows classification using generalized cluster analysis, consistent {{with the presence of}} <b>chronic</b> pelvic <b>pain.</b> Material and method: A survey was done on 2469 women referred to Clinical Institute of Urology and Renal Transplantation, Cluj-Napoca, Romania, between January 2006 - December 2010. Patients were stratify in regard with presence of <b>chronic</b> pelvic <b>pain</b> (GrA) and assessed in regard with demographic and habitual risk factors, medical and reproductive history, lifestyle, and pain characteristics. Identified factors were used for classification using generalized cluster analysis by k-mean technique. The results were assessed in terms of correlation with the presence of <b>chronic</b> pelvic <b>pain.</b> Results: On univariate analysis, marital status and higher education were protective while complications at delivery and physical work were risk factors for <b>chronic</b> pelvic <b>pain.</b> Age at presentation and age at menarche were lower in GrA, while caffeine and alcohol consumption, number of cigarettes smoked per day, pain intensity, coexistence of pain related to periods, deep intercourse, bladder filling, and voiding have been increased in GrA. Classification of patients correlates with the presence of <b>chronic</b> pelvic <b>pain</b> (p< 0. 001). Conclusions: Age, marital status, level of education, type of activity, complications at delivery, caffeine and alcohol consumption are risk factors related to <b>chronic</b> pelvic <b>pain</b> in women referred for urologic conditions. Pain intensity is related to <b>chronic</b> pelvic <b>pain,</b> regardless of type and localization.

40|$|AbstractDue to the {{cross-sectional}} {{nature of}} previous studies, whether mechanical factors predict {{the onset of}} <b>Chronic</b> oro-facial <b>pain</b> remains unclear. Aims {{of the current study}} were to test the hypotheses that self-reported mechanical factors would predict onset of <b>Chronic</b> oro-facial <b>pain</b> and that any observed relationship would be independent of the confounding effects of psychosocial factors and reporting of other unexplained symptoms. About 1735 subjects who had completed a baseline questionnaire were assessed at 2 year follow-up for the presence of <b>Chronic</b> oro-facial <b>pain,</b> psychosocial factors (anxiety and depression, illness behaviour, life stressors and reporting of somatic symptoms), mechanical dysfunction (facial trauma, grinding, phantom bite and missing teeth) and reporting of other unexplained symptoms (<b>chronic</b> widespread <b>pain,</b> irritable bowel syndrome and chronic fatigue). About 1329 subjects returned completed questionnaires (adjusted response rate 87 %). About 56 (5 %) reported new episodes of <b>Chronic</b> oro-facial <b>pain</b> at follow-up. Univariate analyses showed that age, gender, reporting of other unexplained symptoms, psychosocial factors and two self-report mechanical factors predicted the onset of <b>Chronic</b> oro-facial <b>pain.</b> However multivariate analysis showed that mechanical factors did not independently predict onset. The strongest predictors were health anxiety (Relative Risk (RR) 2. 8, 95 % CI 1. 3 – 6. 2), <b>chronic</b> widespread <b>pain</b> (RR 4. 0 95 % C. I. 2. 2 – 7. 4) and age (RR 0. 2, 95 % CI 0. 1 – 0. 7). The findings from this prospective study support the hypothesis that psychosocial factors are markers for onset of <b>Chronic</b> oro-facial <b>pain.</b> The efficacy of early psychological management of <b>Chronic</b> oro-facial <b>pain</b> to address these factors should be a priority for future investigations...|$|R

Participants took a test of general cognitive ability at age 11 years; and <b>chronic</b> widespread <b>pain,</b> defined according to the American College of Rheumatology criteria, was assessed at age 45 years. Risk ratios (RRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using log-binomial regression, adjusting for sex and potential confounding or mediating factors. Risk of <b>chronic</b> widespread <b>pain,</b> defined according to the American College of Rheumatology criteria, rose in a stepwise fashion as intelligence fell (P for linear trend < 0. 0001). In sex-adjusted analyses, for an SD lower intelligence quotient, the RR of <b>chronic</b> widespread <b>pain</b> was 1. 26 (95 % CI 1. 17 – 1. 35).
