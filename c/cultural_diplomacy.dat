Liberatum claimed the festival's aim was to showcase all that is contemporary about Istanbul as a great world city while celebrating its past and heritage. Istancool brought together leading fashion, arts and cultural figures from Milan, London, Paris and New York City including Terence Koh, Daphne Guinness, Leigh Lezark, The Misshapes, Michael Nyman, Gareth Pugh, Gore Vidal, Bernard-Henri Lévy, Lily Cole, Zaha Hadid, Philip Treacy, Sir VS Naipaul, Franca Sozzani, Lee Daniels, Waris Ahluwalia and Jefferson Hack. The festival celebrated Istanbul's status as the 2010 European Capital of Culture. It aimed to showcase the great talents of Turkey and connect them with leading global figures. Istancool sponsors and partners consisted of Turkish Airlines, Istanbul 74, Vakko, Turkish Ministry of Culture and Tourism, AnOther Magazine, Vogue Turkiye, Harper's Bazaar, Istanbul 2010 European Capital of Culture Agency, Sakip Sabanci Museum, Turkish Airlines, Pera Museum and Istanbul Modern.|$|E

We argue that China’s soft power strategy is in accordance to Chinese Confucian culture and political value and fits well with its grand strategy of peaceful rise. Based on existing conceptualizations of soft power, we expanded the sources of soft power to six pillars: cultural attractiveness, political values, development model, international institutions, international image, and economic temptation. We also identified three channels for wielding soft power: formal, economic, and <b>cultural</b> <b>diplomacies.</b> Putting all the basics together, we present an integrative model of soft power.

40|$|The {{topic of}} this paper is the {{historical}} reconstruction of the relations between the Cannes and Venice International Film Festivals {{on the eve of the}} Second World War and during its course. On the one hand, the paper aims to show the direct interconnections and mutual influences between these two cultural institutions; on the other hand, the contribution intends to reveal the variety of factors and actors (political, economical and cultural), that were involved in these forms of international mobilization. In 1938 the Cannes Film Festival’s idea had arisen in clear opposition to the Nazi-Fascist drift of the Venice Mostra, but its first edition was cancelled because of the German invasion of Poland. Despite this, since late September 1939 and also during the Nazi-Fascist occupation and the Vichy regime, French organizers tried to find a form of collaboration with Venice officials in order to arrange both manifestations, without competing with the Mostra. This contribution reveals the importance of studying Film Festivals as <b>cultural</b> <b>diplomacy’s</b> tools for improving international relations even in wartime...|$|R

2500|$|Richard T. Arndt, {{a former}} State Department <b>cultural</b> <b>diplomacy</b> practitioner, said [...] "Cultural {{relations}} grow naturally and organically, without government intervention – the transactions {{of trade and}} tourism, student flows, communications, book circulation, migration, media access, inter-marriage – millions of daily cross-cultural encounters. If that is correct, <b>cultural</b> <b>diplomacy</b> can only be said to take place when formal diplomats, serving national governments, try to shape and channel this natural flow to advance national interests." [...] It {{is important to note}} that, while <b>cultural</b> <b>diplomacy</b> is, as indicated above, a government activity, the private sector has a very real role to play because the government does not create culture, therefore, it can only attempt to make a culture known and define the impact this organic growth will have on national policies. <b>Cultural</b> <b>diplomacy</b> attempts to manage the international environment by utilizing these sources and achievements and making them known abroad. [...] An important aspect of this is listening- <b>cultural</b> <b>diplomacy</b> is meant to be a two-way exchange. [...] This exchange is then intended to foster a mutual understanding and thereby win influence within the target nation. [...] <b>Cultural</b> <b>diplomacy</b> derives its credibility not from being close to government institutions, but from its proximity to cultural authorities. It is seen as a silent weapon in gaining control over another nation with the use of non-violent methods to perpetrate a relationship of mutual understanding and support among the countries involved.|$|E

2500|$|Generally, <b>cultural</b> <b>diplomacy</b> is {{more focused}} on the longer term and less on {{specific}} policy matters.

[...] It allows the government to create a [...] "foundation of trust" [...] and a mutual understanding that is neutral and built on people-to-people contact. [...] Another unique and important element of <b>cultural</b> <b>diplomacy</b> is its ability to reach youth, non-elites and other audiences outside of the traditional embassy circuit.

[...] <b>Cultural</b> <b>diplomacy</b> is also a component of public diplomacy.

40|$|Jonathan Spence is {{of course}} {{one of the great}} {{authorities}} on Chinese history, but the value of history is in its relevance to the present, so at a time of such huge volatility in the affairs of China, there is great curiosity as to how he views current trends. We have the means to find out in his current series of Reith Lectures being given one per week in England and broadcast through the BBC’s websites, currently non-blocked in China. The first lecture was about the role of Confucius and Confucian thought in Chinese history, and in the q 2 ̆ 6 a section, Spence was coaxed to explore the significance for modern-day China (he was optimistic that continued questioning of authority and pressure for pluralism could be expected regardless of the resurgence of confucianism).

40|$|Foreign {{diplomatic}} {{representation is}} {{a feature of}} national and other capital cities as centres of political and other forms power, the significance of which in cultural terms has previously been granted minor attention. Using the cases of the U. S., Dutch and Brazilian missions in the City of Tshwane (Pretoria), it is evident their meaning takes two forms: firstly, in the built environment and secondly, in <b>cultural</b> and public <b>diplomacy</b> activities that engage cityzens in new ways of thinking and being. The form of primary diplomatic sites, chanceries, embodies the national community around which their representation is constructed. Armed with a legitimate claim on the space they occupy {{they are a part}} of the city imaginary in their various shapes, sizes and styles where they communicate intent through their architecture, symbolism and activities. The identity, structure and intended meaning of chanceries would however be an incomplete project were it not for cityzenry s casual observers and active participants, as well as diplomatic and other chancery staff, who are instrumental in constituting the site and its purpose. Exploring beyond the chancery, places in the city also become diplomatic sites when utilized by missions for their <b>cultural</b> and public <b>diplomacy.</b> These activities again reify the nation state promising a platform for the affirmation of community in a city of loosely associated cityzens. Additionally, in the present context of multiplied choices for personal identity formation, missions attract audiences through language schools, art exhibitions, theatre, music and film festivals, workshops, seminars and panel discussions. This facilitation of voluntary association is the post-political, post-economic significance of diplomatic representation in the City of Tshwane.

[...] The government does not usually produce the books, music, films, TV programs, consumer products, etc. that reaches an audience. [...] The most the government can do is try to work to create opening so the message can get through to mass audiences abroad. [...] To be cultural relevant in the age of globalization, a government must exercise control over the flows of information and communication technologies, including trade. [...] This is also difficult for governments that operate in a free market society where the government does not control the bulk of information flows. [...] What the government can do is work to protect cultural exports where they flourish, by utilizing trade agreements or gaining access for foreign telecommunication networks.|$|E
2500|$|First and foremost, <b>cultural</b> <b>diplomacy</b> is a {{demonstration}} of national power because it demonstrates to foreign audiences every aspect of culture, including wealth, scientific and technological advances, competitiveness in everything from sports and industry to military power, and a nation's overall confidence. [...] The perception of power obviously {{has important implications for}} a nation's ability to ensure its security. [...] Furthermore, because <b>cultural</b> <b>diplomacy</b> includes political and ideological arguments, and uses the language of persuasion and advocacy, it can be used as an instrument of political warfare and be useful in achieving traditional goals of war. [...] A Chinese activist was quoted as saying [...] "We've seen a lot of Hollywood movies- they feature weddings, funerals and going to court. [...] So now we think it's only natural to go to court a few times in your life." [...] This {{is an example of a}} cultural export- Hollywood movies, possibly having a subtle effect on the legal system in China, which could ultimately benefit the United States or any other nation which wishes to see a more democratic China.
