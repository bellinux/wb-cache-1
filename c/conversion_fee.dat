According to the Committee to Study Tools and Strategies for Protecting Kids from Pornography and Their Applicability to Other Inappropriate Internet Content, there are over 100,000 subscription sites with adult content in the United States, with each site having multiple web pages. On average, a paid subscription generates $20 to $40 per month in revenue, however, an in-depth analysis is complicated. If a visitor site connects to a pay site and signs up for content, it receives a <b>conversion</b> <b>fee</b> from the larger site. A successful large operation is often an umbrella company serving many markets with pay sites. Around this core and its affiliates is a system of ad-supported service sites.

50|$|Many {{banks and}} {{financial}} institutions will have specific travel products on offer such as prepaid travel money cards or credit cards {{with little or}} no currency <b>conversion</b> <b>fees</b> and complimentary travel insurance. These kinds of financial products will often be far better suited to travel than typical banking products and will minimise the amount spent on fees and charges associated with travel. Another alternative option for travellers to take their money with them is traveller's checks. These are a very secure method of taking money abroad but aren’t widely accepted.|$|R

50|$|Debt-Lag is a {{condition}} which results from overuse of one’s credit card {{or other forms of}} credit while travelling. The debt itself can refer to the amount spent in the lead up to travelling, during the trip and any unexpected costs which come about from that trip, such as cross currency <b>conversion</b> <b>fees</b> and foreign ATM access charges.The condition of debt-lag may last months or even years after a person’s trip is complete, as long as the debt accrued within the travel period is still outstanding. It is recommended that sufferers of debt-lag seek treatment as soon as possible to avoid paying exorbitant fees in interest charges.|$|R

40|$|Conversion of high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes to high-occupancy toll (HOT) lanes {{has become}} a {{relatively}} common managed lanes technique now employed in cities across the U. S. HOT lanes are created by developing a pricing system for existing HOV lanes that allow single occupancy vehicles {{to gain access to}} HOV lanes by paying a <b>fee.</b> <b>Conversion</b> of existing general purpose lanes to toll lanes or HOT lane operations, however, has not yet won public support as the perception persists that these “free” lanes have already been paid for and such conversions are a take-away. Focus groups were held in Minnesota to understand what policies, conditions, designs and operational characteristics could be considered that may satisfy concerns about general purpose lane adaptations to optional toll lanes or Flexible and Efficient Express (FEE) Lanes. FEE Lanes envision all users, except transit, paying a toll during peak-periods, with the lane reverting back to “free” operation outside of the peaks. Three configurations of FEE lanes were presented and a toll credit system was offered as a means to compensate users who may view the conversion as a take-away. Participants liked what they have already seen work, which is one priced lane on I- 394 MnPASS, but were also concerned about user safety and equity. The credit system, which attempts to address user equity, was a source of confusion for many focus group participants. Although some participants seemed to like the idea of getting the credits to use FEE lanes, there were numerous concerns about logistics of credit management and distribution. These findings highlight the need for increased education and marketing about road pricing options which can assist in building support for a variety of pricing options, such as FEE lanes.
