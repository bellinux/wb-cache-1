Even though the PCMR <b>can</b> <b>potentially</b> prevent an unconstitutional piece of legislation from coming into force, there is doubt as to whether the Council's members have sufficient legal training to undertake the burdensome task.|$|E
5|$|Beef steak can {{be cooked}} {{to a level}} of very rare (bleu, a cold raw center), rare, medium rare, medium, medium well done, or well done. Pittsburgh rare is charred on the outside. Beef, unlike certain other meats, {{does not need to be}} cooked through. Food-borne human {{illnesses}} are not normally found within a beef steak, though surfaces <b>can</b> <b>potentially</b> be contaminated from handling, and thus, very rare steak (seared on the outside and raw within) is generally accepted as safe.|$|E
5|$|Boron nitride can be doped p-type with {{beryllium}} and n-type with boron, sulfur, silicon or if co-doped {{with carbon}} and nitrogen. Both hexagonal and cubic BN are wide-gap semiconductors with a band-gap energy {{corresponding to the}} UV region. If voltage is applied to h-BN or c-BN, then it emits UV light in the range 215–250nm and therefore <b>can</b> <b>potentially</b> be used as light-emitting diodes (LEDs) or lasers.|$|E
50|$|At high temperatures, {{the more}} rapid {{generation}} of oxide {{due to a}} combination of temperature and tribological action during sliding wear <b>can</b> generate <b>potentially</b> wear resistant oxide layers known as 'glazes'. Under such circumstances, tribocorrosion <b>can</b> be used <b>potentially</b> in a beneficial way.|$|R

5|$|Bupropion {{lowers the}} {{threshold}} for epileptic seizures, and therefore <b>can</b> <b>potentially</b> {{interact with other}} medications that also lower it, such as carbapenems, cholinergic agents, fluoroquinolones, interferons, chloroquine, mefloquine, lindane, theophylline, systemic corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone), and some tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., clomipramine). The prescribing information recommends minimizing the use of alcohol, since in rare cases bupropion reduces alcohol tolerance, and because the excessive use of alcohol may lower the seizure threshold. Also, bupropion {{should not be taken}} by individuals undergoing abrupt cessation of alcohol or benzodiazepine use.|$|E
5|$|Entanglement {{can result}} in {{mortality}} because when the seals get trapped in marine debris such as fishing nets they cannot maneuver or reach the surface to breathe. Marine fisheries <b>can</b> <b>potentially</b> interact with monk seals via direct and indirect relationships. Directly the seal can become snared by fishing equipment, entangled in discarded debris, and even feed on fish refuse. International law prohibits the intentional discarding of debris from ships at sea. Monk seals {{have one of the}} highest documented rates of entanglement of any pinniped species.|$|E
5|$|Implementing {{the diet}} can present {{difficulties}} for caregivers {{and the patient}} due to the time commitment involved in measuring and planning meals. Since any unplanned eating <b>can</b> <b>potentially</b> break the nutritional balance required, some people find the discipline needed to maintain the diet challenging and unpleasant. Some people terminate the diet or switch to a less demanding diet, like the modified Atkins diet (MAD) or the low-glycaemic index treatment (LGIT) diet, because they find the difficulties too great.|$|E

5|$|No {{treatments}} stop {{or reverse}} its progression, though some may temporarily improve symptoms. Affected people increasingly rely on others for assistance, often placing {{a burden on}} the caregiver; the pressures can include social, psychological, physical, and economic elements. Exercise programmes may be beneficial with respect to {{activities of daily living}} and <b>can</b> <b>potentially</b> improve outcomes. Treatment of behavioural problems or psychosis due to dementia with antipsychotics is common, but not usually recommended, as there is little benefit with an increased risk of early death.|$|E
5|$|Porosity, {{often not}} visible {{without the use}} of {{advanced}} nondestructive testing methods, is a serious concern because it <b>can</b> <b>potentially</b> weaken the weld. Another defect affecting the strength of the weld is poor fusion, though it is often easily visible. It is caused by low current, contaminated joint surfaces, or the use of an improper electrode.|$|E
5|$|Starlings' {{droppings}} {{can contain}} the fungus Histoplasma capsulatum, {{the cause of}} histoplasmosis in humans. At roosting sites this fungus can thrive in accumulated droppings. There {{are a number of}} other infectious diseases that <b>can</b> <b>potentially</b> be transmitted by common starlings to humans, although the potential for the birds to spread infections may have been exaggerated.|$|E

5|$|The great spotted {{woodpecker}} {{is similar}} to some other species in its genus. The Syrian woodpecker lacks its relative's black cheek bar and has whiter underparts and paler red underparts, although juvenile {{great spotted woodpecker}}s often have an incomplete cheek bar, so <b>can</b> <b>potentially</b> be misidentified as Syrian. The white-winged woodpecker has a far more extensive white wing patch than the great spotted woodpecker. The Sind woodpecker {{is very similar to}} the Syrian species, and can be distinguished from great spotted woodpecker in the same way.|$|E
5|$|The only {{species that}} <b>can</b> <b>potentially</b> be {{confused}} with the Siberian accentor is the related black-throated accentor, since first-autumn birds of the latter species may have a relatively inconspicuous dark throat. The Siberian accentor is still distinguishable by its rustier back colour, yellow (not off-white) supercilium and the absence of a white line below the black face mask.|$|E
5|$|A {{consequence}} of describing electrons as waveforms {{is that it}} is mathematically impossible to simultaneously derive the position and momentum of an electron. This became known as the Heisenberg uncertainty principle after the theoretical physicist Werner Heisenberg, who first described it and published it in 1927. This invalidated Bohr's model, with its neat, clearly defined circular orbits. The modern model of the atom describes the positions of electrons in an atom in terms of probabilities. An electron <b>can</b> <b>potentially</b> be found at any distance from the nucleus, but, depending on its energy level, exists more frequently in certain regions around the nucleus than others; this pattern is referred to as its atomic orbital. The orbitals {{come in a variety of}} shapes-sphere, dumbbell, torus, etc.-with the nucleus in the middle.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} factors <b>can</b> <b>potentially</b> {{increase}} the risk of developing paracetamol toxicity. Chronic excessive alcohol consumption can induce CYP2E1, thus increasing the potential toxicity of paracetamol. In one study of patients with liver injury, 64% reported alcohol intakes of greater than 80 grams a day, while 35% took 60 grams a day or less. Whether chronic alcoholism should be considered a risk factor has been debated by some clinical toxicologists. For chronic alcohol users, acute alcohol ingestion at the time of a paracetamol overdose may have a protective effect. For non-chronic alcohol users, acute alcohol consumption had no protective effect.|$|E
5|$|All species {{within the}} wolf-like canids possess 78 {{chromosomes}} and therefore <b>can</b> <b>potentially</b> interbreed. Genetic analysis reveals that hybridization takes place between gray wolves and jackals, creating a jackal-wolf hybrid. Hybridization also occurs between female golden jackals and male dogs, which produces fertile offspring, a jackal–dog hybrid. There was 11%–13% of ancient gene {{flow into the}} golden jackal from the population that was ancestral to wolves and dogs, and an additional 3% contributed from extant wolf populations. Up to 15% of the Israeli wolf genome is derived from admixure with golden jackals in ancient times.|$|E
5|$|Anthropologists {{are also}} able to see other markers present on the bones. Past {{fractures}} will be evident {{by the presence of}} bone remodeling. The examination of any fractures on the bones <b>can</b> <b>potentially</b> help determine cause of death as well by determining if a fracture occurred ante-mortem (before death), peri-mortem (at the time of death), or post-mortem (after death). Ante-mortem fractures will show signs of healing while peri- and post-mortem fractures will not. Peri-mortem fractures will usually appear clean while post-mortem breaks will appear brittle. Diseases such as bone cancer might be present in bone marrow samples and can help narrow down the list of possible identifications.|$|E

5|$|Bionicle: Mask of Light, stylized as BIONICLE: Mask of Light— The Movie, is a 2003 direct-to-video science fantasy action film {{based on}} the Bionicle toy series created by Lego. Set in a {{universe}} filled with bio-mechanical beings allied with classical element-themed tribes, the story follows two friends from the fire-based village of Ta-Koro on a quest to find {{the owner of the}} Mask of Light, a mystical artifact that <b>can</b> <b>potentially</b> defeat Makuta, an evil entity threatening the island. The story is {{based on the}} latter half of the toyline's 2002–2003 narrative.|$|E
5|$|Food {{waste is}} {{generally}} considered to have a damaging effect on the environment; a reduction in food waste is considered critical if the UK is to meet obligations under the European Landfill Directive to reduce biodegradable waste going to landfill and favourable considering international targets on climate change, limiting greenhouse gas emissions. When disposed of in landfill, food waste releases methane, a relatively damaging greenhouse gas, and leachate, a toxin capable of considerable groundwater pollution. The food supply chain accounts for a fifth of UK carbon emissions; the production, storage and transportation of food to homes requires large amounts of energy. The effects of stopping food waste that <b>can</b> <b>potentially</b> be prevented has been likened to removing one in five cars from UK roads.|$|E
5|$|Geotaphonomy is the {{examination}} of how the decomposition of the body affects the environment. Geotaphonomy examinations can include how the soil was disturbed, pH alteration of the surrounding area, and either the acceleration or deceleration of plant growth around the body. By examining these characteristics, examiners can begin to piece together a timeline of the events during and after death. This <b>can</b> <b>potentially</b> help determine the time since death, whether or not trauma on the skeleton {{was a result of}} peri or post-mortem activity, as well as if scattered remains were the result of scavengers or a deliberate attempt to conceal the remains by an assailant.|$|E
