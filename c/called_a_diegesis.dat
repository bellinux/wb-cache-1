40|$|The tale is {{not just}} a linear, sober narrative, but a clever {{combination}} of <b>a</b> <b>diegesis</b> of <b>a</b> certain type, a network of images and an implicit philosophy. This is where it differs from both the short story and the fable. As a literary genre, it is less of a « simple form » (André Jolles) and more of a « simplex form » (Alain Berthoz). In this context, how to address the question of the simple style in the literary genre of the fairy tale – a genre which leans towards complexity and sophistication, more than simplicity? We will suggest that the literary ideal of simplicity advocated by Perrault, best exemplified in The Fairies, is constructed against the gallant aesthetic which was the source of French fairy tales.

5000|$|Diegesis is multi-levelled in {{narrative}} fiction. Genette distinguishes between three [...] "diegetic levels". The extradiegetic level (the {{level of the}} narrative's telling) is, according to Prince, [...] "external to (not part of) any diegesis." [...] One might {{think of this as}} what we commonly understand to be the narrator's level, the level at which exists a narrator who {{is not part of the}} story being told. The diegetic level or intradiegetic level is understood as the level of the characters, their thoughts and actions. The metadiegetic level or hypodiegetic level is that part of <b>a</b> <b>diegesis</b> that is embedded in another one and is often understood as a story within a story, as when a diegetic narrator himself/herself tells a story.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the processes of}} creating a hybrid experience of live performance and virtual imagery in 1 + x: Mid-range Projections, a dance work that uses real-time processing of live feed video to create a duet between dancers and their virtual images. 1 + x is about creating experiences of interiority and intimacy, ironically, through the juxtaposition of virtual images of performers with their real selves. This paper examines how the ideal of reinserting intimacy, humanity and 2 ̆ 7 presence 2 ̆ 7 into a technologically generated image space, {{in the case of}} 1 + x, depends on the precise and delicate manipulation of live-feed video in collaboration with the audience 2 ̆ 7 s experience of interactivity.

40|$|This bipartite thesis {{presents}} and implements an intermedial model for co-reading poems and photographs in paper books, <b>a</b> genre I <b>call</b> photo poetry. <b>A</b> {{survey of the}} genre in Sweden was carried out and presented in a selected bibliography in my licentiate thesis. Two well-established poets, Katarina Frostenson and Rut Hillarp, made their debut in the genre in the 1980 s and have since produced three books each. Frostenson cooperates with photographer Jean Claude Arnault and Hillarp created the poems {{as well as the}} pictures herself. Scholarly studies up to now have focused on the poems, however, and have therefore neglected the impact of the photographic pictures. The first part of the thesis elaborates a model based on the framework of the picture book and adapted to the text genre of poetry and the epistemology of the photographic picture. Two different narrative reading strategies are developed and applied to the material: the metonymical and the metaphorical linking. The metonymical linking implies that the diegesis on the spread is perceived to be part of <b>a</b> larger <b>diegesis</b> and that that diegesis has direct virtual contact with the diegesis on the next spread. The metaphorical linking implies that the diegesis on the single spread is perceived to be part of <b>a</b> larger <b>diegesis,</b> but that that diegesis has no direct virtual spatial contact with the next spread. Whether or not <b>a</b> <b>diegesis</b> is perceived to have direct virtual spatial contact with spreads depends on the story’s display of the contingency of characters, time and place. The model is based on the relations tied to the book’s construction: the schematic, the synchronic and the diachronic relation. The schematic relation concerns meaning created on all spreads, the synchronic relation meaning on a single spread, and the diachronic relation meanings on spreads in a row. The schematic and the diachronic may appear to overlap somewhat but in the schematic relation the focus is on tracing different story schemes, and in the diachronic relation the focus is on how the narration progresses and alternates between different schemes. The findings show that with the co-reading model the impact of the photographs gives a deeper understanding of not only the narrative interplay of word and image but also of semiotic, intermedial and intertextual connections. The reading strategies applied show that Frostenson’s and Arnault’s works gain from a metonymically linked interpretation whereas Hillarp’s mainly gain from a metaphorically linked interpretation. The study also discusses the impact of the photographic picture and connects it to the semiotic theory of C. S. Peirce as well as to Western picture practices...|$|R

40|$|The theatre of Jay Scheib blends {{theatrical}} and filmic features, {{allowing for}} a theoretical investigation of {{the manner in which}} two different media coexist on the same expressive support. How can two distinct media like film and theatre fuse and, at the same time, be apprehended as separate artistic means in a single artifact? The present article uses a theoretical interpretive metaphor that rests on an application of the mechanisms of relationship between two physical systems issued from the quantum mechanical view of reality. From this perspective, the two afore-mentioned media are in an entangled state. Media is understood as “potential materials or forms for future practices,” or “automatisms” (Rodowick 2007, 42). At the same time, theatrical or cinematic media is apprehended by the audience in a dynamic way, not defined as a static bundle of defining features. Dynamic conceptualization will modulate or “tune” the comprehension of one of the media considered to be a subordinate system in the duplex. The blending of the two media presupposes a local conceptualization unfolding dynamically and an entangled one manifested nonlocal. The distinction between film and theatre is also {{to be seen as a}} difference in the cognitive model which posits a detached display (a screen/a scene), an imaginary world (<b>a</b> <b>diegesis)</b> and <b>a</b> spectator (observer). In theatre, the body of the observer is inside the theatrical display setting, while in film, the body of the viewer is conceptualized to be separated from the cinematic display. The notion of threshold, introduced by Dudley Andrew (2010), renders this shift of attention from one side of the display to the other...|$|R
40|$|Strictly Come Dancing sits {{neatly in}} the Guilty Pleasures {{category}} for many viewers {{due to its}} postmodern position as a talent show/reality show/Musical hybrid. While many of the series’ segments appear to celebrate and endorse thoughtless entertainment, Strictly actually maintains a structural sophistication hidden by its lightweight facade. In fact, the show stations itself to draw viewers into the “lives” of its contestants by swinging between reality-style segments related {{to the challenges of}} ballroom training as well as silly skits that remind the audience that the competition is all in fun, only to shift to Musical performances on the night of each competition. Through a close reading of the show, my paper will explain how the appeal of Strictly Come Dancing lies partly in its dependence on a narrative structure that recalls the classic Hollywood Musical, albeit with a postmodern spin. When Rick Altman defined the Hollywood Film Musical for a generation of scholars as having <b>a</b> double <b>diegesis,</b> he outlined the relationship between the story elements and the musical sequences in the classic film Musical. Altman’s theory can be taken to a new level when applied to Strictly Come Dancing, a series that has proven itself a highly viable substitute for the virtually extinct film Musical genre, by increasing the external audience’s interest in ballroom dancing through a structure I will define as <b>a</b> quadruple <b>diegesis.</b> Strictly’s episodic construction combines Musical sequences (the competitive dancing and special guest musical performances), with narrative (the scripted skits), reality show scenes (the training), and talent show segments (the judging by both internal and external audiences). This complex structure helps to account for the popularity of Strictly Come Dancing, a television series celebrated by a contemporary audience that long ago tired of Hollywood’s attempts to create Musical film fantasies...|$|R
40|$|Compositing {{multiple}} plates into {{a single}} image creates challenges for lighting, grading and editing, while the distinct methods of each produces aesthetic challenges in creating apparently coherent space. The challenge is all the greater because digital screens and projectors afford only a strictly limited form of display, and the codecs associated with them share features that force these constructions of space {{to conform to the}} Cartesian grid of two-dimensional geometry. Avatar (James Cameron, 2009) attempts to build <b>a</b> coherent <b>diegesis</b> but fails because of these issues, which are redoubled in other technical domains, notably motion capture, and in the narrative. Nonetheless, ideological readings can only provide a negative response: careful analysis reveals utopian possibilities in composited live action and animated spectacle that need also {{to be included in the}} critical armoury...|$|R
