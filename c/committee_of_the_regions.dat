Secondly, according to the subsidiarity principle, the political arenas could easily stay interconnected rather than nested, as stated by a major thesis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> multilevel governance paradigm. Finally, subsidiarity considered through the Lisbon Treaty seems to allow CoR become a genuine community institution, which seems to be a paradox considering that it has been conceived to prevent community institutions from blocking <b>the</b> competences <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Member States. ...|$|R
