5000|$|U.S. Steel and {{the other}} {{employers}} terminated the ENA in 1984. In 1986, U.S. Steel employees stopped work after a dispute over contract terms, characterized by the company as a strike and by the union as a lockout. In a letter to striking employees in 1986, Johnston warned, [...] "There are not enough seats in the steel lifeboat for everybody." [...] In addition to reducing the role of unions, the steel industry had sought to induce {{the federal government to}} take action to <b>counteract</b> <b>dumping</b> of steel by foreign producers at below-market prices. Neither the concessions nor anti-dumping laws have restored the industry to the health and prestige it once had.|$|E
40|$|The Agreement on the Implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (1994) (Anti-Dumping Agreement) {{permits the}} {{imposition}} of anti-dumping duties for as long {{and to the extent}} necessary to <b>counteract</b> <b>dumping</b> which is causing injury, subject to the proviso that they must be terminated after five years unless a sunset review has been initiated. A sunset review has the purpose of either permitting or terminating the continuation of an anti-dumping duty. This is significant because if the sunset review is not initiated prior to the expiry of the five-year period, the anti-dumping duties will be terminated. Therefore, this places an emphasis on the determination of the precise date of commencement of the anti-dumping duties. This is because an incorrect determination of the date of {{the imposition of}} the anti-dumping duty has obvious financial implications for the interested parties. The Supreme Court of Appeal in South Africa has delivered two salient judgments in this regard: firstly, in Progress Office Machines CC v SARS 2008 2 SA 13 (SCA) (POM), and then more recently, in Association of Meat Importers v ITAC 2013 4 All SA 253 (SCA) (AMIE). This paper contends that these two judgments are in conflict and are riddled with inconsistencies. Secondly, the paper contends that the SCA has in the recent AMIE case virtually rewritten its earlier judgment of Progress Office Machines. Lastly, the paper shows that the approach of South African courts to whether the Anti-Dumping Agreement is binding on South African law is fraught with uncertainty and ambivalence. The case analysis also reflects on the impact of the newly minted but yet to be implemented Customs Duty Act with a view to assessing the impact of the new legislation on the issues currently plaguing the anti-dumping regime of South Africa...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} a horizontal comparison among various arrangements for regional economic integration, {{focusing on the}} types of disciplines on application of antidumping measures, and thereby attempts to identify prerequisites that must be satisfied for the introduction of such disciplines. Regional economic integration arrangements under survey can be classified into three groups, depending on how they deal with antidumping measures. First, there are those that prohibit the application of antidumping measures, such as the European Community (EC), the European Economic Area (EEA), the Australia-New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement (ANZCERTA), the Canada-Chile Free Trade Agreement, and the Agreement between the EFTA States and Singapore. Second, there are those that impose "WTO-plus" substantive disciplines on antidumping measures stricter than provided for under the WTO Antidumping Agreement. Included in this group are the Agreement between New Zealand and Singapore on a Closer Economic Partnership, and the Agreement between Jordan and Singapore on the Establishment of a Free Trade Area. The third group of arrangements provides for virtually no WTO-plus discipline on antidumping measures, as seen {{in a series of}} free trade agreements (FTAs) recently concluded by the United States. This paper analyzes experiences with these different types of regional arrangements in light of various theories on conditions for the occurrence of dumping {{as well as on the}} raison d'etre of antidumping measures, thereby identifying prerequisites for abolishing antidumping measures. First, it is necessary to remove "government-imposed market separation" by achieving free trade. Second, "private-sector-caused market separation" must be removed by harmonizing competition laws. Third, if substitute disciplines and enforcement cooperation, which could prevent and/or <b>counteract</b> <b>dumping,</b> are introduced in competition law, it would ease the way for the abolition of antidumping measures. In this sense, whether or not abolish antidumping measures may be regarded as an "indicator of the degree of market integration. " Meanwhile, to enable the introduction of WTO-plus disciplines on antidumping measures, countries concerned must share interests in setting precedents, for instance, for WTO negotiations on antidumping rules. They must also not be in a state of unbalance with antidumping measures being applied by one country to the other but not vice versa. These findings would have policy implications for the development of the WTO antidumping negotiations as well as for Japan's negotiations for future FTAs and economic partnership agreements (EPAs). ...|$|E
5000|$|In the United States, {{domestic}} {{firms can}} file an antidumping petition under the regulations {{determined by the}} U.S. Department of Commerce, which determines [...] "less than fair value" [...] and the International Trade Commission, which determines [...] "injury". These proceedings operate on a timetable governed by U.S. law. The Department of Commerce has regularly found that products have been sold at less than fair value in U.S. markets. If the domestic industry is able to establish that it is being injured by the dumping, then antidumping duties are imposed on goods imported from the dumpers' country at a percentage rate calculated to <b>counteract</b> the <b>dumping</b> margin.|$|R
40|$|Gene-targeted mice {{deficient}} in the evolutionarily conserved uracil–DNA glycosylase encoded by the UNG gene surprisingly lack the mutator phenotype characteristic of bacterial and yeast ung- mutants. A complementary uracil–DNA glycosylase activity detected in ung-/- murine cells and tissues {{may be responsible}} for the repair of deaminated cytosine residues in vivo. Here, specific neutralizing antibodies were used to identify the SMUG 1 enzyme as the major uracil–DNA glycosylase in UNG-deficient mice. SMUG 1 is present at similar levels in cell nuclei of non-proliferating and proliferating tissues, indicating a replication- independent role in DNA repair. The SMUG 1 enzyme is found in vertebrates and insects, whereas it is absent in nematodes, plants and fungi. We propose a model in which SMUG 1 has evolved in higher eukaryotes as an anti-mutator distinct from the UNG enzyme, the latter being largely localized to replication foci in mammalian cells to <b>counteract</b> de novo <b>dUMP</b> incorporation into DNA...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{its other}} successes, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) {{has been criticized}} as being {{anything}} but successful in the antidumping arena. In particular, industries in the United States argue that GATT has failed to control dumping effectively and that alternative forms of relief are needed to counteract this unfair trade practice. The root of their concerns is the prospective nature of the existing remedy. Since antidumping duties are assessed only after a violation has been detected, dumping is essentially a risk-free, no-lose proposition, giving foreign exporters a free 2 ̆ 2 first bite at the apple. 2 ̆ 2 The absence of monetary damages for injuries sustained {{as a result of}} dumping compounds manufacturers 2 ̆ 7 difficulties. In response to the growing sentiment that American trade laws do not reflect the realities of international commerce, Congress has introduced several initiatives seeking to strengthen these laws to combat unfair trade practices more effectively. One specific proposal, which has received a flood of congressional interest but little scholarly attention, is the establishment of a private right of action to <b>counteract</b> illegal <b>dumping.</b> In contrast to the current procedure that requires an administrative proceeding to determine the propriety of imposing an antidumping duty, such a proposal would give United States industries direct access to federal courts to recover monetary damages for any injury caused by dumping and, in some cases, to receive injunctive relief halting the entry of dumped imports. Despite its favorable implications, a private right of action raises grave concerns over its compatibility with the United States 2 ̆ 7 s international obligations under GATT. Indeed, this Note argues that the establishment of a private right of action granting domestic firms direct access to federal courts to seek monetary and injunctive relief against foreign dumping is a violation of the General Agreement. Part I provides a brief overview of GATT and the international and domestic antidumping laws. Part II discusses the problems with the current American antidumping laws and summarizes the proposals for a private right of action against dumping as a means to remedy these problems. Part III analyzes the relation of the proposed bills to five provisions of the General Agreement and concludes that a private right of action is not compatible with GATT...|$|R
