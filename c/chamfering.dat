Most metal bench planes, and some larger wooden ones, are designed with a rear handle known as a tote. Block planes {{are characterized by}} the absence of a chipbreaker and the cutting iron bedded with the bevel up. The block plane is usually a smaller tool that can be held with one hand and is used for general purpose work such as taking down a knot in the wood, smoothing small pieces, <b>chamfering</b> edges, and making the end of a sawed board square and smooth.|$|E

Acoustically, this makes the tone hole function {{as if it were}} larger, but its main function is to allow the air column to follow the curve up through the tone hole (surface tension) instead of [...] "blowing past" [...] it under the increasingly directional frequencies of the upper registers.|$|E

2500|$|Structural {{elements}} and fittings moved from Church Norton {{to the new}} parish church included a Norman-era font, pillars, arches and three bays of pointed-arched arcading from the nave, a bell cast in 1844 by Mears & Co. of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry, and some Eucharistic objects from the 16th to the 18th centuries. [...] The arcading had <b>chamfering</b> and scallop-shaped capitals. Initially the rectory continued to be at Norton, but in 1902 it was sold and a new one built on land adjoining the relocated church. This work was completed in 1903.

2500|$|In the {{development}} of computational human phantoms, of particular interest {{is the concept of}} a [...] "deformable" [...] phantom whose geometry can be conveniently transformed to fit particular physical organ shapes, volumes, or body postures. Design of this type of phantom is realized by Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS) method or polygonal mesh method, which are usually collectively called BREP methods. Compared to the voxel phantoms, BREP phantoms are better suited for geometry deformation and adjustment, [...] because a larger set of computerized operations are available, such as extrusion, <b>chamfering,</b> blending, drafting, shelling and tweaking. A major advantage of BREP phantoms is their ability to morph into an existing reference phantom or into the anatomy of a real worker or patient, which makes individual-specific dose calculation possible.|$|E

2500|$|Buck paid {{particular}} attention to the design of bridges of extreme obliquity, addressing two potential problems he had identified. Firstly, he noted that the acutely angled quoins at the obtuse corners of the plan view were very susceptible to damage during construction, settlement or by accidental blows in subsequent use so he devised a method of <b>chamfering</b> the edge, removing the single acute angle and replacing it with two obtuse angles and, in his own words, [...] "the quantity thus cut off from the acute quoin, is gradually diminished to the opposite or obtuse quoin, where the cutting vanishes; by this contrivance no angle less than a right angle is any where presented on the exterior of the work [...] the effect produced is elegant and pleasing to the eye." ...|$|E

Hence, partly in necessity and partly in prudence, the splaying or <b>chamfering</b> of the jamb of the larger door will be deepened, and, if possible, made at a larger angle for the large door than for the small one; so that the large door will always be encompassed by a visible breadth of jamb proportioned to its own magnitude.

Studies involve a range of nozzle pressure ratios from 4 to 6, and <b>chamfer</b> angles 15 °, 30 °, and 45 °. Further, the effects of cavity length and stand-off distance are also considered. The spectra, directivity, and acoustic power characteristics are studied in detail. Detailed numerical simulations are carried out to capture the flow oscillations inside {{as well as at the}} outside of the mouth of the <b>chamfered</b> cavities. Computations show flow diversion in <b>chamfered</b> cavities and explain the shift in the directivity observed experimentally. The fundamental frequency of cavities with 15 ° and 30 ° <b>chamfers</b> is observed to be higher than that of regular cavities. Resonance is intensified by the presence of <b>chamfer</b> resulting in higher overall sound pressure levels of <b>chamfered</b> whistles.

40|$|Abstract. We {{propose a}} novel {{technique}} that significantly improves {{the performance of}} oriented <b>chamfer</b> matching on images with cluttered background. Different to other matching methods, which only measures how well a template fits to an edge map, we evaluate the score of the template in comparison to auxiliary contours, which we call normalizers. We utilize AdaBoost to learn a Normalized Oriented <b>Chamfer</b> Distance (NOCD). Our experimental results demonstrate that it boosts the detection rate of the oriented <b>chamfer</b> distance. The simplicity and ease of training of NOCD on {{a small number of}} training samples promise that it can replace <b>chamfer</b> distance and oriented <b>chamfer</b> distance in any template matching application. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Deburring is a {{critical}} step {{in the manufacture of}} a machined part. The two-pass control concept of this paper removes burrs and produces a consistent <b>chamfer,</b> even with fixture, part, and robot errors. The approach requires a robot for gross positioning of the cutter and an around-the-arm end effector capable of measuring orthogonal force between cutter and workpiece, measuring cutter position with respect to end-effector frame of reference, and actively controlling the cutter-applied orthogonal force. In the first pass, compliance control (orthogonal to workpiece) removes burrs by programming the cutter to act as a low-pass filter on the burrs, where the cutter bandwidth is less than burr time-frequency content, while complying to the fixture, part, and robot errors. In the second pass, <b>chamfer</b> depth variations are smoothed out using <b>chamfer</b> control, where <b>chamfer</b> depth is controlled by computing an estimated real-time <b>chamfer</b> depth, and using this estimate in a feedback loop that varies the cutter-workpiece force to maintain a commanded <b>chamfer</b> depth. The <b>chamfer</b> depth estimator removes repeatable fixture, part, and robot errors by using cutter position measurements from the first pass. Cutting experiments on edges with burrs show that compliance control improved on the force control approach in compensating for burrs, and <b>chamfer</b> control was able to produce a consistent <b>chamfer</b> depth.
