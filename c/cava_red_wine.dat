40|$|Aims: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} acute and chronic consumption of <b>red</b> <b>wine</b> or de-alcoholized <b>red</b> <b>wine</b> with a similar antioxidant capacity on plasma total antioxidant capacity (TEAC), nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activity and F 2 -isoprostanes (8 -iso-PGF 2 α) in healthy men. Methods: Nineteen healthy men with an increased waist circumference (≥ 94 cm) and a body mass index above 25 kg/m 2 participated in a randomized, controlled crossover design trial. They daily consumed 450 ml of <b>red</b> <b>wine</b> (four drinks; 41. 4 g alcohol) or 450 ml of de-alcoholized <b>red</b> <b>wine</b> during dinner for 4 weeks each. On {{the last day of}} each treatment period, blood was collected before and 1 h after a standardized dinner with <b>red</b> <b>wine</b> or de-alcoholized <b>red</b> <b>wine</b> and also 24 -h urine was collected. Results: Absolute TEAC levels were higher 1 h after dinner with <b>red</b> <b>wine</b> compared with dinner with de-alcoholized <b>red</b> <b>wine</b> (1. 3 versus 1. 1 mmol Trolox equivalents/l; P = 0. 03). Consumption of dinner together with de-alcoholized <b>red</b> <b>wine</b> acutely stimulated NF-κB activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (0. 4 - 0. 7 HeLa equivalents/ 2. 5 μg protein; P = 0. 006), whereas this increase was completely suppressed when the dinner was combined with <b>red</b> <b>wine.</b> A chronic increase in urinary 8 -iso-PGF 2 α after 4 weeks of <b>red</b> <b>wine</b> consumption compared with de-alcoholized <b>red</b> <b>wine</b> consumption (157 pg/mg creatinine and 141 pg/mg creatinine, respectively, P = 0. 006) was also observed. Conclusions: Consumption of a moderate dose of <b>red</b> <b>wine</b> can acutely increase plasma TEAC and suppress NF-κB activation induced by a meal. Controversially, 4 weeks of <b>red</b> <b>wine</b> consumption compared with de-alcoholized <b>red</b> <b>wine</b> consumption increases the oxidative lipid damage marker 8 -iso-PGF 2 α. © The Author 2012.

40|$|AbstractObjective: The {{potential}} {{beneficial effects}} of <b>red</b> <b>wine</b> consumption {{on the development}} of atherosclerotic disease have been previously suggested in the literature. Vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation is an important component of atherogenesis. Inhibition of vascular SMC proliferation may have a beneficial effect in retarding the development of atherosclerotic disease. The goal {{of this study was to}} determine the effect of <b>red</b> <b>wine,</b> <b>red</b> <b>wine</b> polyphenol extract, and resveratrol, a polyphenol commonly found in <b>red</b> <b>wine,</b> on the proliferation of vascular SMC in culture. Methods: Bovine aortic SMCs were used for all experiments. SMCs were treated with growth media supplemented with dealcoholized <b>red</b> <b>wine,</b> <b>red</b> <b>wine</b> polyphenol extract, or resveratrol at various concentrations for as long as 48 hours. SMC proliferation was assessed with 3 H-thymidine DNA incorporation assay. SMC viability was assessed with trypan blue exclusion studies and a colorimetric lactic dehydrogenase cytotoxicity assay. Results: Our results show that <b>red</b> <b>wine</b> and <b>red</b> <b>wine</b> polyphenol extract inhibit SMC proliferation in a dose-dependent fashion. Resveratrol also inhibits vascular SMC proliferation. SMC viability studies show that this inhibition of SMC proliferation is not the result of a cytotoxic effect. Conclusion: Our findings show that <b>red</b> <b>wine</b> and <b>red</b> <b>wine</b> polyphenols have an inhibitory effect on the proliferation of vascular SMCs in culture. These results suggest that the observed beneficial effects of <b>red</b> <b>wine</b> may be the result, in part, of the inhibition of vascular SMC proliferation. Furthermore, the antiproliferative properties of <b>red</b> <b>wine</b> may be caused by its component polyphenols. (J Vasc Surg 2002; 35 : 1226 - 32. ...|$|R
40|$|Because of {{a growing}} body of medical {{research}} which links moderate <b>red</b> <b>wine</b> consumption to health benefits, demand for <b>red</b> <b>wine</b> in the U.

The popular press, starting with a broadcast by the television news program " 60 Minutes " entitled "The French Paradox, " has contributed to this increased demand by popularizing the health attributes of moderate <b>red</b> <b>wine</b> consumption. In this study, the impact of an increase in demand for <b>red</b> <b>wines</b> on small- to medium-sized southern wineries is examined. Representative wine and juice manufacturing plants of six different size capacities are examined in an economic decision-making model.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe study {{tested the}} effect of <b>red</b> <b>wine</b> on endothelial-type nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) {{expression}} and eNOS activity in human endothelial cells. BackgroundEndothelial-type nitric oxide (NO) synthase exerts vasoprotective effects. Moderate alcohol consumption {{has been associated with}} a reduction of cardiovascular disease, and <b>red</b> <b>wine</b> seems to offer more benefits than any other type of drink. However, the molecular basis of this protective effect is unclear. MethodsHuman endothelial cells were treated with <b>red</b> <b>wine,</b> and eNOS messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression was measured by RNase protection assay, eNOS protein expression by Western blotting, and eNOS activity by RFL- 6 reporter cell assay. The eNOS promoter activity was analyzed in transfected endothelial cells; binding activities of relevant transcription factors were determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. ResultsIncubation of endothelial cells with <b>red</b> <b>wines</b> from France upregulated eNOS mRNA and protein expression. In contrast, <b>red</b> <b>wines</b> from Germany showed little or no effect on eNOS expression. No significant difference in eNOS mRNA expression could be detected between “en barrique” (matured in oak barrels) and “non-barrique” (matured in steel tanks) –produced French <b>red</b> <b>wines.</b> Endothelial cells treated with French <b>red</b> <b>wines</b> produced up to three times more bioactive NO than did control cells. French <b>red</b> <b>wines</b> increased the activity of the eNOS promoter, with the essential trans-stimulated sequence being located in the proximal 326 bp of the promoter sequence. The eNOS mRNA stability was also increased by <b>red</b> <b>wine.</b> ConclusionsThe increase in eNOS expression and activity brought about by <b>red</b> <b>wines</b> from France (and probably other locations) may contribute to the beneficial effects of this beverage on the cardiovascular system...|$|R

40|$|RATIONALE: Experimental {{studies have}} shown a {{potential}} blood pressure (BP) lowering effect of <b>red</b> <b>wine</b> polyphenols, whereas the effects of ethanol and polyphenols on BP in humans are not yet clear. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present work was to evaluate the effects of <b>red</b> <b>wine</b> fractions (alcoholic and nonalcoholic) on BP and plasma nitric oxide (NO) in subjects at high cardiovascular risk. METHODS AND RESULTS: Sixty-seven men at high cardiovascular risk were studied. After a 2 -week run-in period, subjects were randomized into 3 treatment periods in a crossover clinical trial, with a common background diet plus <b>red</b> <b>wine</b> (30 g alcohol/day), the equivalent amount of dealcoholized <b>red</b> <b>wine,</b> or gin (30 g alcohol/day), lasting 4 weeks each intervention. At baseline and after each intervention, anthropometrical parameters, BP and plasma NO were measured. Systolic and diastolic BP decreased significantly after the dealcoholized <b>red</b> <b>wine</b> intervention and these changes correlated with increases in plasma NO. CONCLUSIONS: Dealcoholized <b>red</b> <b>wine</b> decreases systolic and diastolic BP. Our results point out through an NO-mediated mechanism.

40|$|There {{are many}} factors, which are {{important}} {{in the evolution of}} wines during aging in bottle. Whilst it is accepted that the interaction of limited amounts of oxygen with bottled wine (via closure ingress) will not benefit white wine, it is widely held that limited amounts of oxygen will benefit robust <b>red</b> <b>wines.</b> As consumer acceptance continues of many different forms of wine bottle closures, the need to better understand the role of oxygen during <b>red</b> <b>wine</b> aging in bottle has become paramount, particularly for <b>red</b> <b>wines</b> intended for long term maturation. We have analysed both still and sparkling <b>red</b> <b>wines</b> held in bottle for up to 20 years to determine how the maturation process evolves with varying amounts of oxygen available to the wine.

However, increased availability of oxygen greatly increases the rate at which a <b>red</b> <b>wine</b> will mature, and hence shortens the drinking life of the wine.
