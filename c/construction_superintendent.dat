5|$|After graduation, Brundage {{began work}} as a <b>construction</b> <b>superintendent</b> for the leading {{architectural}} firm of Holabird & Roche. In the three years {{he worked for the}} firm, he supervised the construction of $7.5million in buildingsâ€”3percent of the total built in Chicago in that time-frame. He disliked the corruption of the Chicago building trades. Brundage's biographer, Allen Guttmann, points out that the young engineer {{was in a position to}} benefit from influence if he had wanted to, as his uncle, Edward J. Brundage, was by then Republican leader of Chicago's North Side and would become Attorney General of Illinois. Brundage had been successful in a number of track and field events while at Illinois. In 1910, as a member of the Chicago Athletic Association (CAA), he finished third in the national all-around championships (an American predecessor of the decathlon), sponsored by the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU), and continued training, aiming at the 1912 Olympics in Stockholm.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{began on}} May 5, 1931, under Brother Theophorus Kleemann, SVD, who became ill and died on September 12, 1931; Arthur Bialucha, a German {{architect}} living in Qingdao {{who had already}} completed several projects for the SVD, took over as <b>construction</b> <b>superintendent.</b> Construction was frustrated in 1933, when Adolf Hitler {{came to power in}} Germany and prohibited the transfer of money overseas. The diocese independently shouldered the cost of finishing the cathedral. This required a number of design changes to reduce costs. The changes are evident in drawings published before completion of construction, which show the roofs of the towers as bell-shaped. However, the roofs of the completed structure were changed to spires. Construction was finished in 1934, and the cathedral was consecrated on October 28 that year.|$|E
30|$|Perlman and Sacks (2014) {{investigated}} {{whether the}} ability of identifying hazards by civil engineering students and <b>construction</b> <b>superintendents</b> can be improved through VE learning. The results showed that {{the ability of}} hazard identification of both the students and <b>construction</b> <b>superintendents</b> is positively affected through the effective identification of a significant number of hazards. The results demonstrated also that <b>construction</b> <b>superintendents</b> are able to identify more risks than the students suggesting there is a potential link between the level of real world experience and the performance within the virtual environment.|$|R

50|$|Jan Gaykema Jacobsz. {{was born}} at the Wagenweg, {{in a part of}} the village of Heemstede that would be annexed in the 1830s into the town of Haarlem. His father Jacob Gaykema was descended from a line of {{carpenters}} and <b>construction</b> <b>superintendents,</b> who were originally medieval freeholders from the Dutch province of Friesland. Mother Anna Cornelia van Scherpenseel had a Gelderland/Utrecht background. The infant was christened the same month at the protestant Grote or Bavokerk in Haarlem.|$|R
5|$|Upon {{his return}} to Chicago, Brundage {{accepted}} a position as <b>construction</b> <b>superintendent</b> for John Griffith and Sons Contractors. Among the structures he worked on for Griffith were the Cook County Hospital, the Morrison Hotel, the Monroe Building, and the National Biscuit Company warehouse. In 1915, he struck {{out on his own}} in construction, founding the Avery Brundage Company, of which his uncle Edward was a director. Brundage continued his athletic career as well. He was US all-around champion in 1914, 1916, and 1918. Once he had ceased to be a track star, he took up handball. As a young man, he was ranked in the top ten in the country and even in 1934, at the age of 46, he won one game out of two against Angelo Trulio, who had recently been the US national champion.|$|E

Eken, who also constructed other New York City buildings and developments {{such as the}} original Stuyvesant Town, Starrett City and Trump Tower. The project was financed primarily by Raskob and Pierre du Pont, while James Farley's General Builders Supply Corporation supplied the building materials. John W. Bowser was the project's <b>construction</b> <b>superintendent,</b> and the structural engineer of the building was Homer G. Balcom. The plans were worked out such that construction started on one task before plans for others were finalized.|$|E
50|$|Construction field {{computing}} {{is the use}} of handheld {{devices that}} augment the <b>construction</b> <b>superintendent's</b> ability to manage the operations on a construction site. These information appliances (IA) must be portable devices which can be carried or worn by the user, and have computational and connectivity capacity to perform the tasks of communication management. Data entry and retrieval must be simple so that the user can manipulate the device while simultaneously moving, observing events, studying materials, checking quality, or performing other tasks required.

25|$|After Balmain's death, Rev. Meade {{effectively}} {{served as}} the parish's priest-in-charge until 1845, although he was consecrated Rt. Rev. Channing Moore's assistant (and probable successor) in 1829. Rt.Rev. Meade traveled and evangelized extensively, but continued to live near Cunningham Chapel. He engaged other priests to serve at Winchester, Bunker Hill and the Wickliffe chapel (consecrated 1819 and rebuilt and consecrated in 1846) as his assistants, as well as helped plant many congregations in Virginia, especially near the new railroad stations. In Virginia's diocesan convention of 1827, this parish was formally recognized as Christ Church, rather than as the Winchester Episcopal Church or Frederick Parish (which name stayed with Rev. Meade's parish for a while, until Clarke County split from Frederick and the two Berryville churches jointly took that parish name). As 1827 ended, Christ Church's vestry voted {{to tear down the}} old building and build a bigger brick and stone building in the Gothic Revival style then fashionable, following the design of noted architect Robert Mills (whose wife Eliza was born outside Winchester and kin to many active parishioners). John Bruce served as <b>construction</b> <b>superintendent.</b> The parish also acquired a new cemetery from the heirs of vestryman James Wood. As his first official act as newly consecrated assistant bishop of Virginia, Rt.Rev. Meade consecrated the new brick Christ Church on October 30, 1829. In 1830, the diocese held its annual convention in the new church (which proved to set the style for Winchester churches for decades).|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The next {{generation}} of mobile infrastructure management systems will allow on-site infrastructure field workers, such as <b>construction</b> <b>superintendents</b> and bridge inspectors, to use mobile and wearable computers to interact with geo-referenced spatial models of the infrastructure and to automatically retrieve the necessary information in real time based on their location, orientation, and the specific task context using Augmented Reality (AR) techniques. AR allows interaction with 3 D virtual objects {{and other types of}} information superimposed over 3 D real objects in real time. The augmentation can be realized by looking at the real world through a transparent head-mounted display equipped with sensors that accurately track head movements to register the virtual objects with the real objects in real time. In these systems, field workers will be able to access and update information related to their tasks in the field with minimum efforts spent on the interaction with the system, which results in increasing their efficiency and potentially, their safety. In this paper, we discuss a new AR interaction model that has been developed especially to suit the requirements of mobile infrastructure management systems. The model is based on automatic picking of the objects of interest and augmenting the 3 D real scene with data extracted from a database. The algorithm of the model is explained and implemented in a prototype system for a building construction project...|$|R
40|$|Supervision of {{construction}} workers {{on a site}} is crucial to ensure construction worker safety, to maintain the quality of work performed and to maintain acceptable levels of productivity. The act of supervision itself requires the site superintendent to physically monitor workers {{in an environment that}} is constantly changing throughout the various phases {{of construction}}. This can be a complicated task on a medium to large building site with several trades working simultaneously on multiple floors or areas. There exists a need for <b>construction</b> <b>superintendents</b> to know the location of construction workers within a site. Academicians and industry professionals have demonstrated the use of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) Tags in construction applications in the past few years. RFID tags have successfully been used to track construction materials, equipment and tools. Studies indicate that the use of RFID tags in construction improves the overall process of construction. Building information modeling (BIM) technology is emerging as the industry standard in the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) sector. BIM is being used as a comprehensive design, management, visualization, communication and facility maintenance and management tool. This research presents the creation of a decision support framework for site supervision based on monitoring construction workers by combining RFID technology with BIM. A conceptual decision support framework to monitor site safety was developed by interviewing site superintendents. Conducting a web-based questionnaire of construction industry professionals validated the framework. A proof-of-concept virtual prototype was created to track the movement of construction workers using RFID and BIM. The procedures undertaken to create the conceptual framework and the virtual prototype are described in the thesis...|$|R
