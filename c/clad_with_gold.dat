5000|$|Lefkandi on {{the island}} of Euboea was a prosperous {{settlement}} in the Late Bronze Age, possibly to be identified with old Eretria. It recovered quickly from the collapse of Mycenaean culture, and in 1981 excavators of a burial ground found the largest 10th-century building yet known from Greece. Sometimes called [...] "the heroon", this long narrow building, 50 metres by 10 metres, or about 150 feet by 30 feet, contained two burial shafts. In one were placed four horses and the other contained a cremated male buried with his iron weapons and an inhumed woman, heavily adorned with gold jewellery. The man's bones were placed in a bronze jar from Cyprus, with hunting scenes on the cast rim. The woman was <b>clad</b> <b>with</b> <b>gold</b> coils in her hair, rings, gold breast plates, an heirloom necklace (an elaborate Cypriot or Near Eastern necklace made some 200-300 years before her burial) and an ivory-handled dagger at her head. The horses appeared to have been sacrificed, some appearing to have iron bits in their mouths. No evidence survives to show whether the building was erected to house the burial, or whether the [...] "hero" [...] or local chieftain in the grave was cremated and then buried in his grand house; whichever is true, the house was soon demolished and the debris used to form a roughly circular mound over the wall stumps.|$|E
5000|$|The Tabernacle (מִשְׁכַּן, mishkan, [...] "residence" [...] or [...] "dwelling place"), {{according}} to the Hebrew Bible, was the portable earthly dwelling place of God amongst the children of Israel {{from the time of}} the Exodus from Egypt through the conquering of the land of Canaan. Built of woven layers of curtains along with 48 standing boards <b>clad</b> <b>with</b> polished <b>gold</b> and held in place by 5 bars per side with the middle bar shooting through from end to end and other items made from the gold, silver, brass, furs, jewels, and other valuable materials taken out of Egypt at God's orders, and {{according to}} specifications revealed by Yahweh (God) to Moses at Mount Sinai, it was transported [...] by the Israelites on their journey through the wilderness and their conquest of the Promised Land. Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem superseded it as the dwelling-place of God some 300 years later.|$|R
2500|$|The Tabernacle ( [...] , mishkan, [...] "residence" [...] or [...] "dwelling place"), {{according}} to the Hebrew Bible, was the portable earthly dwelling [...] place of God amongst the children of Israel {{from the time of}} the Exodus from Egypt through the conquering of the land of Canaan. Built of woven layers of curtains along <b>with</b> 48 boards <b>clad</b> <b>with</b> polished <b>gold</b> standing like vertical blinds held in place by 5 bars per side with [...] the middle bar shooting through from end to end and furnished with items made from the gold, silver, brass, furs, jewels, and other valuable materials taken out of Egypt at God's orders, and {{according to}} specifications revealed by Yahweh (God) to Moses at Mount Sinai, it was transported [...] by the Israelites on their journey through the wilderness and their conquest of the Promised Land.

40|$|The system {{technology}} and process development for decreasing the achievable structure sizes (track geometry) for the micro laser <b>cladding</b> process <b>with</b> powder as additive material is presented. The main focus during the system technology development {{lies on the}} components powder feeder, powder distributor, transport tubes and powder nozzle including the shielding gas system. Aim is to allow the feeding of non flowable powders (powder particle sizes d 50 < 10 µm), to decrease the powder focus diameter of the powder nozzle, to achieve a good protection of the melting pool with shielding gas and to avoid powder agglomeration in the transport tubes. By integrating a brush feeder and using 316 L with d 50 = 4, 7 µm as additive material the realization of single tracks with a track geometry (hES x bES x t) of 25 x 6 x 1 µm 3 is shown. With a coaxial powder nozzle, an outer shielding gas nozzle and the adaptation of the gas flows powder focus diameters between 200 and 240 µm can be realized. During the process development of tracks with a width between 25 and 50 µm typical process deviations as overspray are discussed and a systematic approach concerning the topography and dilution of single tracks and layers in dependence of the process parameters is presented. Beside {{the results of the}} basic investigations performed with iron based alloys as additive material results <b>with</b> precious metals (<b>gold</b> and silver) for the manufacturing of contacts on bipolar plates for fuel cells and tantalum for the manufacturing of x-ray markers on stents are presented. By laser <b>cladding</b> of <b>gold</b> contacts <b>with</b> a contact geometry of 60 x 30 µm 2 on bipolar plates (d= 100 mm) of metallic fuel cells the degradation of an assembled fuel cell stack can be reduced by factor 2 and the output power increased by 30 % so that the output power is comparable to conventional bipolar plates made of carbon. For the selective laser <b>cladding</b> <b>with</b> <b>gold</b> as additive material only 1 / 100 of the amount of material is necessary compared with a conventional galvanic coating. By laser dispersing tantalum particles in an area of 1 x 1. 5 mm 2 on nitinol stents with a wall thickness of 200 µm the feasibility of this process is shown for the manufacturing of x-ray visibility markers...|$|R
