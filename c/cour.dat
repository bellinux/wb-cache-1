5|$|By 1874, the Louvre Palace had {{achieved}} {{its present form}} of an almost rectangular structure with the Sully Wing to the east containing the <b>Cour</b> Carrée (Square Court) and the oldest parts of the Louvre; and two wings which wrap the <b>Cour</b> Napoléon, the Richelieu Wing {{to the north and}} the Denon Wing, which borders the Seine to the south. In 1983, French President François Mitterrand proposed, as one of his Grands Projets, the Grand Louvre plan to renovate the building and relocate the Finance Ministry, allowing displays throughout the building. Architect I. M. Pei was awarded the project and proposed a glass pyramid to stand over a new entrance in the main court, the <b>Cour</b> Napoléon. The pyramid and its underground lobby were inaugurated on 15 October 1988; the pyramid was completed in 1989. The second phase of the Grand Louvre plan, La Pyramide Inversée (The Inverted Pyramid), was completed in 1993. As of 2002, attendance had doubled since completion.|$|E
5|$|At {{about six}} {{o'clock in the}} morning, some of the protesters {{discovered}} a small gate to the palace was unguarded. Making their way inside, they searched for the queen's bedchamber. The royal guards raced throughout the palace, bolting doors and barricading hallways {{and those in the}} compromised sector, the <b>cour</b> de marbre, fired their guns at the intruders, killing a young member of the crowd. Infuriated, the rest surged towards the breach and streamed inside.|$|E
5|$|The public façade of {{the palace}} faces {{directly}} onto a town square and {{takes the form of}} two low, symmetrical, quadrant wings which flank the forward-reaching wings of a small central corps de logis, thus forming a semi-circular <b>cour</b> d'honneur (see key 1). The southern of the two quadrant wings is terminated by the onion-domed chapel, while the northern wing contained the kitchens and servants' quarters (see keys 2, 1 and 13). The only decoration comes from the simple classical pediments above the windows. This façade, that most readily seen from the town, presents a decorous and impassive public face {{with one of the most}} architecturally severe elevations {{of the palace}} (see illustration right).|$|E

5|$|In the {{tradition}} of sixteenth-century royal festivals, Catherine de' Medici's magnificences took place over several days, with a different entertainment each day. Often individual nobles or {{members of the royal}} family were responsible for preparing one particular entertainment. Spectators and participants, including those involved in martial sports, would dress up in costumes representing mythological or romantic themes. Catherine gradually introduced changes to {{the tradition}}al form of these entertainments. She forbade heavy tilting of the sort that led to the death of her husband in 1559; and she developed and increased the prominence of dance in the shows that climaxed each series of entertainments. As a result, the ballets de <b>cour,</b> a distinctive new art form, emerged from the creative advances in court entertainment devised by Catherine de' Medici.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} {{collection has}} more than 7,500works from the 13thcentury to 1848 and is managed by 12curators who oversee the collection's display. Nearly two-thirds are by French artists, and more than 1,200are Northern European. The Italian paintings compose most of the remnants of FrancisI and LouisXIV's collections, others are unreturned artwork from the Napoleon era, and some were bought. The collection began with Francis, who acquired works from Italian masters such as Raphael and Michelangelo and brought Leonardo da Vinci to his court. After the French Revolution, the Royal Collection formed {{the nucleus of the}} Louvre. When the d'Orsay train station was converted into the Musée d'Orsay in 1986, the collection was split, and pieces completed after the 1848 Revolution were moved to the new museum. French and Northern European works are in the Richelieu wing and <b>Cour</b> Carrée; Spanish and Italian paintings are {{on the first floor of}} the Denon wing.|$|E
5|$|Following the mutiny of the French Guards a {{few hours}} before the {{storming}} of the Bastille, the only troops immediately available for the security of the palace at Versailles were the aristocratic Garde du Corps (Body Guard) and the Cent-Suisses (Hundred Swiss). Both were primarily ceremonial units and lacked the numbers and training to provide effective protection for the royal family and the government. Accordingly, the Flanders Regiment (a regular infantry regiment of the Royal Army) was ordered to Versailles in late September 1789 by the king's minister of war, the Comte de Saint-Priest, as a precautionary measure. On 1 October, the officers at Versailles held a welcoming banquet for the officers of the new troops, a customary practice when a unit changed its garrison. The royal family briefly attended the affair, walking amongst the tables set up in the opera house of the palace. Outside, in the <b>cour</b> de marbre (central courtyard), the soldiers' toasts and oaths of fealty to the king grew more demonstrative as the night wore on.|$|E

Before 1941 primary schools had upper sections called ecoles primaires supérieures, which spanned on four years and enabled students to enter normal schools or clerking professions; such sections were turned into Lycées but <b>cours</b> complementaires remained until 1959, when such courses were turned into collèges d'enseignement généraux.|$|R

For example, in 1730, he designed the Hôtel du Poët for Henri Gautier (1676-1757), located {{at the very top}} of the <b>Cours,</b> and listed since 1987. Moreover, in 1757, he designed the facade of the Hôtel d'Esmivy de Moissac at the bottom of the <b>Cours,</b> listed since 1993.|$|R

5|$|Throughout his {{childhood}} and youth, the Nansouty family led a tranquil yet modest life in Bordeaux, {{where his father}} held the position of commander of Château-Trompette, in which {{he lived with his}} family, additionally receiving a pension of 1000 livres. He was still holding the position as commander when he died suddenly in 1785, after more than 60 years of active service. His widow had no revenue with which to raise their son and two daughters. However, influential people such as the Duchess of Brancas and the wife of Marshal Beauvau contacted the Minister of War, Marshal de Ségur, regarding the situation of the young Nansouty. As a result, in 1788, Nansouty was named interim captain in the light cavalry Franche-Comté Cavalerie Regiment (later rebaptised 4th Chasseurs à Cheval). He was soon transferred to the Lauzun Hussar Regiment (which became the 6th Hussars in 1791, then the 5th Hussars in 1793). In 1791, Nansouty then left the regiment to fill two consecutive military staff positions, first as deputy aid to Adjutant General Poncet de la <b>Cour</b> Maupas in the Army of the Centre on 20 December, then as aide-de-camp of Marshal Luckner at the beginning of 1792. He was then promoted to lieutenant-colonel and took up the command of a squadron of the 2nd Chasseurs à Cheval (on 5 March), before being transferred to the command of a squadron of the 9th Cavalry Regiment on 4 April, a regiment in which he would serve for the next seven and a half years.|$|E

25|$|Around 1874 Poul la <b>Cour,</b> a Danish inventor, {{experimented with}} audio {{telegraphs}} on a telegraph line between Copenhagen and Fredericia in Jutland. His experiment used a vibrating tuning-fork {{to interrupt the}} line current, which, after traversing the line passed through an electromagnet that acted upon the tines of another tuning-fork, making it resonate at the same pitch of the transmitting fork. Moreover, the hums were also recorded on paper by turning the electromagnetic receiver into a relay, which actuated a Morse code printer {{by means of a}} local battery.
