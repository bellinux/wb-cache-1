50|$|With {{the help}} of the council of <b>China,</b> <b>alligator</b> habitat has been {{restored}} and protected. Most remaining wild individuals live in the 433 km2 Anhui Chinese Alligator Nature Reserve.|$|E
50|$|In several {{restaurants}} and food centers in China's booming areas, young and immature alligators {{are allowed to}} roam free with their mouths taped shut. They are subsequently killed for human consumption as, in <b>China,</b> <b>alligator</b> meat is thought to cure colds and prevent cancer. In China, the organs of the Chinese alligator are sold as cures {{for a number of}} ailments.|$|E
40|$|Alligator weed, Alternanthera philoxeroides (Mart.) Grisb, {{is one of}} {{the worst}} {{invasive}} weeds in the world. In the present study, the genome size of 7 forms / boitypes of alligator weed from Argentina (native area), the United States (US, introduced area), and China (introduced area) were analyzed using flow cytometers and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of rDNA of them were cloned and sequenced. We found that the genome size of A. philoxeroides ranged from 5. 72 to 8. 50 [*]pg/ 2 C nucleus, consisted of four levels of genome and three kinds of ploidy. Among them, three levels and two kinds (tetraploid and hexaploid) were found in Argentina samples, two levels and one kind (pentaploid) in US samples, and one level and one kind (hexaploid) in China sample. Contrary to the significant variation in genome size, we found that the intra-specific differentiation of the ITS sequences in the 7 forms / boitypes was extremely low, and that 6 of them shared the ITS sequences with no or one single substitution. These results show that the change of genome size played a major role in the differentiation of A. philoxeroides, and that forms / boitypes with higher ploidy seem to have stronger invasive ability. Furthermore, the differences of A. philoxeroides in ploidy between US and <b>China</b> demonstrated that <b>alligator</b> weeds from these two invaded areas certainly have different native progenitors...|$|R
