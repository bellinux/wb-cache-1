40|$|ABSTRACT: Brain damage around birth {{may cause}} lifelong neu-rodevelopmental deficits. We {{examined}} the therapeutic potential of human umbilical <b>cord</b> <b>blood–derived</b> mononuclear cells containing multipotent stem cells to facilitate motor recovery after cerebral hypoxic-ischemic damage in neonatal rats. Left carotid artery ligation followed by 8 % O 2 inhalation for 80 min {{was performed on}} postnatal d 7, succeeded by intraperitoneal transplantation of human umbilical <b>cord</b> <b>blood–derived</b> mononuclear cells on postnatal d 8 in a sham-controlled design. Histologic and immunohistochemical analysis on postnatal d 21 revealed that neonates developed severe cerebral damage after the hypoxic-ischemic insult. These animals also suf-fered from contralateral spastic paresis, as evidenced by their loco-motor behavior.

40|$|The {{optic nerve}} is a {{viscoelastic}} solid-like biomaterial. Its normal stress relaxation and creep properties enable {{the nerve to}} resist constant strain and protect it from injury. We hypothesized that stress relaxation and creep properties of the optic nerve change after injury.

To validate this hypothesis, a rabbit model of optic nerve injury was established using a clamp approach.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Currently, a {{constant}} shortage {{in the supply}} of platelets has become an important medical and society challenge, especially in developing country, and the in vitro production of megakaryocytic progenitor cells (MPs) from cord blood could represent an effective platelet substitute. In the present study, our objective {{was to determine the}} safety and feasibility of ex vivo generated MPs in patients. METHODS AND FINDINGS: MPs were produced and characterized from cord blood mononuclear cells under a serum free medium with cytokines. We investigated the feasibility of expansion and infusion of <b>cord</b> <b>blood-derived</b> MPs in 24 patients with advanced hematological malignancies. The primary end point was the safety and tolerability of the infusion of <b>cord</b> <b>blood-derived</b> MPs.

40|$|<b>Cord</b> <b>blood–derived</b> neural {{stem cells}} (NSCs) are {{proposed}} {{as an alternative}} cell source to repair brain damage upon transplantation. However, {{there is a lack}} of data showing how these cells are driven to generate desired phenotypes by recipient nervous tissue. Previous research indicates that local environment provides signals driving the fate of stem cells. To investigate the impact of these local cues interaction, the authors used a model of <b>cord</b> <b>blood–derived</b> NSCs co-cultured with different rat brain–specific primary cultures, creating the neural-like microenvironment conditions in vitro. Neuronal and astro-, oligo-, and microglia cell cultures were obtained by the previously described methods. The CMFDA-labeled neural stem cells originated from, non-transformed human umbilical cord blood cell line (HUCB-NSCs) established in a laboratory. The authors show that the close vicinity of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes promotes neuronal differentiation of HUCB-NSCs, whereas postmitotic neurons induce oligodendrogliogenesis of these cells. In turn, microglia or endothelial cells do not favor any phenotypes of their neural commitment. Studies have confirmed that HUCB-NSCs can read cues from the neurogenic microenvironment, attaining features of neurons, astrocytes, or oligodendrocytes. The specific responses of neurally committed <b>cord</b> <b>blood–derived</b> cells, reported in this work, are very much similar to those described previously for NSCs derived from other “more typical” sources.

However, obtaining mature and functional erythrocytes from the immature cell cultures with high purity and in an efficient manner remains a significant challenge. A distinguishing feature of a reticulocyte and maturing erythrocyte is the increasing concentration of hemoglobin and decreasing cell volume that results in increased cell magnetophoretic mobility (MM) when exposed to high magnetic fields and gradients, under anoxic conditions. Taking advantage of these initial observations, we studied a noninvasive (label-free) magnetic separation and analysis process to enrich and identify cultured functional erythrocytes. In addition to the magnetic cell separation and cell motion analysis in the magnetic field, the cell cultures were characterized for cell sedimentation rate, cell volume distributions using differential interference microscopy, immunophenotyping (glycophorin A), hemoglobin concentration and shear-induced deformability (elongation index, EI, by ektacytometry) to test for mature erythrocyte attributes.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary {{dysplasia}} and emphysema are life-threatening diseases {{resulting from}} impaired alveolar development or alveolar destruction. Both conditions lack effective therapies. Angiogenic growth factors promote alveolar growth {{and contribute to}} alveolar maintenance. Endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs) represent a subset of circulating and resident endothelial cells capable of self-renewal and de novo vessel formation. We hypothesized that resident ECFCs exist in the developing lung, that they are impaired during arrested alveolar growth in experimental bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and that exogenous ECFCs restore disrupted alveolar growth. METHODS AND RESULTS: Human fetal and neonatal rat lungs contain ECFCs with robust proliferative potential, secondary colony formation on replating, and de novo blood vessel formation in vivo when transplanted into immunodeficient mice. In contrast, human fetal lung ECFCs exposed to hyperoxia in vitro and neonatal rat ECFCs isolated from hyperoxic alveolar growth-arrested rat lungs mimicking bronchopulmonary dysplasia proliferated less, showed decreased clonogenic capacity, and formed fewer capillary-like networks. Intrajugular administration of human <b>cord</b> <b>blood-derived</b> ECFCs after established arrested alveolar growth restored lung function, alveolar and lung vascular growth, and attenuated pulmonary hypertension. Lung ECFC colony- and capillary-like network-forming capabilities were also restored. Low ECFC engraftment and the protective effect of cell-free ECFC-derived conditioned media suggest a paracrine effect. Long-term (10 months) assessment of ECFC therapy showed no adverse effects with persistent improvement in lung structure, exercise capacity, and pulmonary hypertension. CONCLUSIONS: Impaired ECFC function may contribute to arrested alveolar growth. <b>Cord</b> <b>blood-derived</b> ECFC therapy may offer new therapeutic options for lung diseases characterized by alveolar damage...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{clinical}} {{potential of}} umbilical <b>cord</b> <b>blood-derived</b> stem and progenitor cells {{has been demonstrated}} in various animal and human transplantation studies. However, the need for increased numbers of appropriate umbilical <b>cord</b> <b>blood-derived</b> cells continues to limit the development and success of these therapies. Ex vivo expansion has been widely studied as a method to overcome this limitation. We describe {{the use of a}} clinically relevant single-use, closed-system bioprocess capable of generating greater numbers of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells that maintain in vivo and in vitro developmental potential. In addition to expanded numbers of CD 34 + cells, CD 34 +CD 38 − cells, colony-forming cells, and long-term culture-initiating cells, the bioprocess generated ≥ 3. 3 -fold more long-term nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient repopulating cells (quantitatively determined using limiting dilution analysis) than present at input. Interestingly, these cells were also capable of multilineage engraftment and were shown to maintain their engraftment potency on a per long-term nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient repopulating cell basis compared with input noncultured cells. The developmental capacity of bioprocess-generated cells was further demonstrated by their ability to repopulate secondary nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient recipients. In vitro lineage analysis confirmed that bioprocess-generated cells could differentiate into myeloid and natural killer, B, and T cell lymphoid lineages. This in-depth analysis describes a bioprocess that generates human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells with conserved hematopoietic activity, establishes analysis criteria for in vitro hematopoietic stem cell expansion studies, and serves as a foundation to test the therapeutic utility of cultured hematopoietic stem cells in large animals and humans...|$|E
40|$|BackgroundRespiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes severe {{respiratory}} tract infections, {{which might have}} a {{role in the development of}} airway hyperreactivity. Mast cells are important effector cells in allergy, with sentinel cell roles in host defense. However, the role of mast cells in response to RSV infection is unknown. ObjectiveHuman mast cell responses to RSV were investigated with a view to better understanding the role of mast cells in RSV-induced disease. MethodsHuman <b>cord</b> <b>blood–derived</b> mast cells and the HMC- 1 mast cell line were exposed to RSV or UV-inactivated RSV. Viral gene and protein expression were evaluated by using PCR and flow cytometry. The expression of interferon-stimulated genes and selected mediators were evaluated by using quantitative PCR and ELISA. ResultsHuman mast cells expressed multiple RSV genes after exposure to RSV, and a small percentage of mast cells supported RSV antigen protein expression. RSV induced mast cells to upregulate production of chemokines, including CCL 4, CCL 5, and CXCL 10, as well as type I interferons, and interferon-stimulated gene expression. However, production of the granulocyte chemoattractants CXCL 8 and CCL 11 was not induced. Antibody blockade of the type I interferon receptor on human <b>cord</b> <b>blood–derived</b> mast cells reduced the RSV-mediated induction of CXCL 10 and CCL 4 but not CCL 5. Leukotriene C 4 production by mast cells was not enhanced by exposure to RSV. ConclusionDespite low levels of infection, human mast cells produce multiple chemokines in response to RSV through mechanisms that include responses to type I interferons. Such mast cell responses might enhance effector cell recruitment during RSV-induced disease...|$|E
40|$|Mast {{cells are}} {{involved}} in allergic reactions but also in innate immunity and inflammation. Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), the key regulator of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, also has proinflammatory effects, apparently through mast cells. We showed recently that CRH selectively stimulates hu-man leukemic mast cells and human umbilical <b>cord</b> <b>blood-derived</b> mast cells to release newly synthesized vascular endo-thelial growth factor (VEGF) without release of either preformed mediators or cytokines. This effect was mediated through the activation of CRH receptor- 1 and adenylate cyclase with in-creased intracellular cAMP. However, the precise mechanism by which CRH induces VEGF secretion {{has not yet been}} de-fined. Here, we show that CRH-induced VEGF release was dose-dependently inhibited by the specific protein kinase...|$|E
40|$|This study {{demonstrates}} the engineering of biologically active heart valve leaflets using prenatally available human umbilical cord–derived progenitor cells {{as the only}} cell source. Wharton’s Jelly–derived cells and umbilical <b>cord</b> <b>blood–derived</b> endothelial progenitor cells were subsequently seeded on biodegradable scaffolds and cultured in a biomimetic system under biochemical or mechanical stimulation or both. Depending on the stimulation, leaflets showed mature layered tissue formation with functional endothelia and extracellular matrix production comparable with that of native tissues. This {{demonstrates the}} feasibility of heart valve leaflet fabrication from prenatal umbilical cord–derived progenitor cells as a further step in overcoming the lack of living autologous replacements with growth and regeneration potential for the repair of congenital malformation...|$|E
