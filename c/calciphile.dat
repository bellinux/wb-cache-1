Others have stated that these populations were not distinct, and the question is far from settled.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Investigations in the Prudhoe Bay {{vicinity}} {{suggest that}} prevailing winds {{from the east}} combined with {{the shape of the}} coastline and a source of calcareous materials in the Sagavanirktok River delta cause distinct patterns of soil reaction and temperature. Areas downwind from the river have basic soil pH values ranging from 7. 1 to 8. 4, whereas wet tundra sites outside the path of loess-laden winds have acidic values ranging from 5. 3 to 7. 0. The winds also affect the local climate by blowing moist cold air and fog further inland {{in the western part of}} the Prudhoe Bay oil field. Air temperatures are correlated with distance to the Ocean measured in the direction of the prevailing wind vector. The temperature differences also influence the depth of the active layer. The differences in pH and temperatures affect the vegetation of the region. The areas with basic soils show relative abundance of <b>calciphiles,</b> whereas areas with lower pH values have acidiphilous plants. Lower temperatures near the coast affect the distribution of many taxa as well as the phenology and stature of the vegetation. R&UMk.

40|$|The {{results of}} a rare plant, floristic, and plant {{community}} survey of the Grand Traverse Islands archipelago are presented. Stretching from Wisconsin’s Door Peninsula to Michigan’s Garden Peninsula, these Lake Michigan and Green Bay islands are largely underlain by Silurian dolomite that outcrops along shorelines as high, white cedar-dominated cliffs (on west coasts), low wave-washed shelves (east coasts), and, occasionally, interior escarpments. Most islands experienced intensive human use in the 19 th century (fishing, concomitant logging and farming) but have now recovered to second- and third-growth forests. An exception is Washington Island, {{the largest in the}} archipelago, which has a permanent human population and much cultivated or formerly cultivated land. Islands larger than about 100 ha have interiors dominated by beech (Fagus grandifolia) —sugar maple (Acer saccharum) forests that may have rich spring ephemeral displays, including, on Washington and Rock Islands, the rare disjunct broad-leaved wood sedge (Carex platyphylla). These mesic forests are best developed on the western and northern sides of islands, where glacial till overlies dolomite. The eastern shores often have boreal conifer-dominated beach ridge and swale complexes (best developed at Jackson Harbor on Washington Island) with regional endemic <b>calciphiles</b> such as dwarf lake iris (Iris lacustris) and boreal disjuncts like northern comandra (Geocaulon lividum). Small dune complexes may have regional endemics such as Pitcher’s thistle (Cirsium pitcheri) and Lake Huron tansy (Tanacetum huronense), but these appear to be declining due to intensive human use of Great Lakes beaches. Dolomitic shoreline bedrock communities—now known as Great Lakes alkaline rockshores—are present on eastern and southeastern coasts of islands and are best developed on Summer, Poverty, Washington, Detroit, and possibly St. Martin Islands. On Poverty and Summer Islands, such communities grade inland into alvar, a globally rare community. Chambers Island is low and sandy and has extensive second-growth hemlock-hardwood forests and small remnant Great Lakes barrens communities with southern sand prairie or pine barrens species that are rare or absent elsewhere along the shores of northern Lake Michigan. Washington Island has a number of interesting interior wetlands including boreal fens at Little Lake, Coffee Swamp, and Big Marsh. The plants and communities of all of the islands are experiencing a “crunch” of negative factors including: Deer herbivory on large islands, which is affecting tree regeneration and the survival of understory herbs such as those in the lily and orchid families; and, invading colonial waterbirds on small (less than about 10 ha) islands—the birds have nearly killed all arboreal vegetation. Some 797 vascular plant species are recorded from the islands, including two federally listed species, 59 species listed as endangered, threatened, or special concern by the state of Wisconsin, and nine listed by endangered, threatened, or special concern by the state of Michigan...|$|R

It grows in rocky, moist, often barren habitat, including gravelly, sparsely vegetated slopes with little organic matter. It is a <b>calciphile,</b> growing in calcareous substrates such as soils rich in decomposed limestone.|$|E
50|$|This species {{grows in}} an arid river valley which gets hot during the summers. Summer is {{generally}} the wettest season in this region, {{and it is}} the time when the plant experiences most of its growth. It is likely a <b>calciphile,</b> as it grows on calcium-rich geological substrates, such as limestone. The plant can be found on disturbed, barren slopes in the river valley, where it is often the only plant growing in abundance. It is often found on road cuts. It is adapted to disturbed habitat, and it grows on crumbling slopes. This may be because it cannot tolerate much competition from other plants. The habitat is sometimes pinyon-juniper woodland.

Journal of Experimental Biology, 213 (9), 1471 - 1476 Environmental calcium {{is a major}} factor affecting the distribution of freshwater gastropods. Whilst the effects on growth and morphology are fairly well understood, little is known about how calcium availability affects other aspects of gastropod biology. Lymnaea stagnalis (L) is considered a <b>calciphile</b> and exhibits reduced growth and survival in environments containing less than 20 mgl- 1 Ca 2 +. Many freshwater systems exhibit fluctuations in calcium concentration over time: where calcium levels are normally high there may be periods of low [Ca 2 +], for example following periods of flooding. Here we examined the effects of acute periods of low (20 mgl - 1) environmental calcium on the physiology and behaviour of L. stagnalis, specifically measuring how locomotion and respiration differ between high calcium (80 mgl- 1) and low calcium (20 mgl- 1) environments. We found that in a low calcium environment crawling speed is reduced, and that this coincides with an increase in cutaneous respiration, indicating that the increased metabolic demands of calcium acquisition at low [Ca 2 +] reduce the energy available for locomotion. Conversely we found a decrease in aerial respiration in hypoxic conditions in the low calcium relative to the high calcium environment. In conclusion, we found that acute exposure to low environmental calcium has a highly significant effect on locomotion and respiration, which may have consequences for snail fitness when no morphological effects are apparent. ? 2010.

Although it has no apparent effect on survival at 20 mg/l, reducing environmental calcium increases metabolic demand, and as such we consider that this level of calcium acts as a stressor on the snail. We exposed snails to acute periods of low environmental calcium and tested their ability to form intermediate-term memory (ITM) and long-term memory (LTM) following one trial operant conditioning (1 TT) to reduce aerial respiratory activity in hypoxic conditions. We also assessed whether there were changes in the electrophysiological properties of a single neuron, right pedal dorsal 1 (RPeD 1), which has been demonstrated to be necessary for LTM formation. Following training in high (80 mg/l) environmental calcium, L. stagnalis formed ITM and LTM lasting 24 h and demonstrated {{a significant reduction in}} all activity measured from RPeD 1; however when snails were exposed to low (20 mg/l) environmental calcium they were able to form ITM but not LTM.

40|$|The {{invasion}} of the Eurasian weed coltsfoot (Tussilago farfara L.) in Gros Morne National Park (GMNP), Newfoundland, was examined to determine which resource changes accompanying disturbance enabled population expansion. Resource levels were measured in 17 disturbance types of natural and anthropogenic origin - notably hiking trails, roads, gravel quarries, shorelines, slopes, hydro corridors and insect kills - and across a gradient from disturbed to undisturbed in 12 vegetation types. Balsam fir forest comprises 36 percent {{of the park and}} has the highest number of disturbance types. [...] Disturbances favouring coltsfoot were characterized by a pH of 6. 8 - 8. 3, high light intensity, increased bare ground, absence of duff cover and moist, gravelly substrates. These resource levels were typical of both natural and anthropogenic disturbances in which the canopy and duff cover were absent, and the pH of acidic native soils had been raised by the addition of quarried limestone or granitic gravel. These represent resource shifts or amplifications relative to undisturbed vegetation types in which coltsfoot was absent. [...] The difference in resource levels across the disturbance gradient indicates that coltsfoot is unable to colonize undisturbed native vegetation. Likewise, a change in resource levels over time, which favours other species and is unsuitable for coltsfoot, appears to be the mechanism of coltsfoot’s recession. [...] Coltsfoot is subject to grazing by other species, indicating its success in GMNP is not entirely a function of its escape from Old World predators, as is often thought to be the case for other invasives. [...] Elevation was not a limiting factor for coltsfoot in GMNP as it was found to be on the Gaspé Peninsula where it does not occur in elevations greater than 150 m asl. Where coltsfoot occurs at high altitudes it is found on all exposures, so that aspect is not a factor in overcoming the climatic changes that accompany increasing elevation. [...] Not all disturbance types present resource levels favourable for coltsfoot establishment. However, resource levels associated with some disturbance types of anthropogenic origin indicate that park activities have {{played an important role in}} the {{invasion of}} coltsfoot in GMNP. Gravel of neutral to basic pH provided a medium for rhizome dispersal during the road and trail construction phase of the park from the late 1970 s to mid 1980 s. Redistribution of gravel allowed coltsfoot, a <b>calciphile</b> limited by low pH, to obtain exponential population growth over a relatively short period of time. [...] Invasion represents a change in resources from historic levels that accompanies certain disturbance types. In chronic (sustained) disturbances associated with roadsides and streams, coltsfoot may persist indefinitely. However, if native vegetation communities are not subjected to disturbances that produce favourable resource levels for coltsfoot, the biodiversity of native vegetation and the fauna that depend upon it, are not threatened...|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} and occurrence of plant species {{within a given}} region provides insight into the many environmental properties of that region. Although much {{research has been conducted}} on plant communities and associated environmental properties, few studies have been conducted on the characteristics of individual plants within those communities. Calcareous fens are wetlands formed by the upwelling of mineral-rich groundwater and often are associated with many unique plant communities and rare species of flora and fauna. Although many studies have documented the vegetation patterns and associated environmental gradients of these fens, none have isolated the specific hydrogeochemical conditions associated with individual species, nor have any studies attempted to document and compare the individual physiological response of species to elevated environmental calcium levels. This research was conducted to estimate environmental calcium requirements for rare as well as common indicator species of calcareous fens of Massachusetts and {{to examine the relationship between}} the accumulation of calcium in the tissues of these species to calcium availability in their environment. These factors will be important when determining required conditions for fen restoration and will further the understanding of why these species often only occur in calcareous fens. Eight calcareous fen study sites at three different locations were established where calciphiles occur in western Massachusetts. In each site, data were collected on the vegetation patterns and associated soil chemistry, water chemistry, and hydrology. In addition, plant tissues were collected and analyzed for calcium. Species distributions were evaluated as to whether they increased in abundance as environmental calcium did or whether they appeared to occur only once a specific calcium threshold was met. In addition, the concentrations of calcium in the tissues were used to determine the extent to which those plants accumulated calcium and how those levels related to levels of calcium in the substrate environment and to their overall distributions. It was found that certain calciphiles are calcium specialists, i. e. they are more abundant when environmental calcium levels are elevated, absorb greater quantities of calcium and those quantities correlate to the available environmental supply. These species include Parnassia glauca, Packera aurea, Geum rivale and Carex granularis. Of these, Geum rivale and Carex granularis, as well as Carex sterilis, did not occur below calcium concentrations of 48 mg. L- 1. However, other calciphiles are calcium generalists, i. e. they are tolerant of elevated calcium levels but show no other relationship with respect to growth or accumulation. These species include Carex flava, Carex hystericina, Juncus nodosus, Solidago patula, Solidago uliginosa, and Symphyotrichum puniceum. In addition, some wetland generalists maintain elevated calcium levels (Symplocarpus foetidus and Mentha arvensis) whereas most others do not (Thelypteris palustris and Fragaria vesca). Of the <b>calciphile</b> and wetland generalist species, some appear to increase in abundance in calcareous fens in relation to increases in accessory benefits (Dasiphora fruticosa and Juncus brachycephalus with pH; Thelypteris palustris and Carex flava with magnesium and possibly Equisetum fluviatile with iron). Combined, these findings characterize the growth habits and calcium accumulation of species that grow in calcareous fens and indicate that calciphiles have varying degrees of dependence on calcium...|$|E
