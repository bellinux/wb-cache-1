5|$|The Volt {{received}} a five-star overall <b>crash</b> <b>safety</b> rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the highest-possible score. This rating was obtained with NHTSA's New Car Assessment Program {{which is used}} for 2011 model year vehicles.|$|E
5|$|The Australasian New Car Assessment Program (ANCAP) {{rated the}} i-MiEV {{four out of}} five stars for <b>crash</b> <b>safety,</b> scoring 28.35 out of 37. This score takes into account a 10.95 out of 16 rating in the frontal offset crash test, and a score of 14.4 out of 16 {{received}} for the side impact test.|$|E
5|$|Holden {{introduced}} the all-new VT Commodore in 1997, {{the outcome of}} a A$600million development programme that spanned more than five years. The new model featured a rounded exterior body shell, improved dynamics and many firsts for an Australian-built car. Also, a stronger body structure increased <b>crash</b> <b>safety.</b> The locally produced Buick-sourced V6 engine powered the Commodore range, as did the 5.0-litre Holden V8 engine, and was replaced in 1999 by the 5.7-litre LS unit.|$|E

5|$|Passenger safety {{was a key}} design aspect for the Ford engineers. Anti-lock brakes were {{standard}} on all models; electronic brakeforce distribution was also {{standard on}} most variants. The addition of traction control for higher trim levels helped to prevent loss of traction. On top of this, dual front airbags were a standard fitment across the range; side-impact airbags were equipped on higher luxury levels such as the Fairmont. In a <b>crash</b> <b>safety</b> assessment conducted by ANCAP, the BA model scored 27.27 {{out of a possible}} 37 points, giving a rating of four out of five stars.|$|E
25|$|CR-Z {{models have}} {{received}} an average rating for side <b>crash</b> <b>safety,</b> an excellent (5 out of 5 stars) rating for rollover, and a 4 out of 5 star rating for frontal <b>crash</b> <b>safety</b> for 2012 and newer model.

50|$|Jeroen Bleekemolen led {{early stages}} of the race, as Jonas Gelžinis and Robertas Kupčikas closely {{followed}} him in second and third. Ramūnas Čapkauskas retired from the race after only 50 laps due electronic failure of his Aquila CR1 prototype. 70 laps into the race unexpected heavy rain caught many fast drivers, including Dainius Matijošaitis with BMW M4, Edvinas Arkušauskas with BMW E90 EDVA, Marius Steponavičius with BMW M3 GT2 and Arūnas Mrazauskas with Lexus IS-F, who crashed heavily. Only Mrazauskas was able to continue the race after lengthy repairs in pitlane, as all other drivers retired. Due to <b>crashes,</b> <b>safety</b> car was deployed several times.|$|R
40|$|Limited {{research}} has investigated the factors determining driving behaviour in the work-related driving setting. In {{a sample of}} 385 work-related drivers, this study applies a framework for systematically assessing drivers' perceptions of safety, integrating this framework with individual attributes, and using the combined set of variables to predict crashes in a work vehicle. The results revealed that motivation to drive a vehicle safely, but not safety knowledge influenced self-reported <b>crashes.</b> <b>Safety</b> motivation also mediated the link between self-efficacy and attitudes towards traffic <b>safety</b> and <b>crashes</b> in a work vehicle. The {{results of this study}} have provided a unique contribution to the safety and road safety literature by allowing for the systematic assessment of different types of employee perceptions and their relationship to crash involvement...|$|R

40|$|With the {{enormous}} losses to society resulting from motor-vehicle <b>crashes,</b> traffic <b>safety</b> {{has become an}} increasing concern of transport agencies. The surrogate events, which are defined as measures of accident proximity, are recognised as an alternative instead of the accumulation of <b>crashes</b> in <b>safety</b> evaluation, {{by taking advantage of}} many merits. This paper briefly assesses the range of available events by analysing their strengths and weaknesses. By using an illustrative case study, the applicability and reliability of various surrogate events under different situations are discussed. While the introduction of surrogate events could potentially improve our understanding of the affecting factors for motor-vehicle crashes, it is the prospect of combining evolving methodologies with far more detailed vehicle crash data that holds the greatest promise for the future.

25|$|The Australasian New Car Assessment Program (ANCAP) {{announced}} in May 2009 {{that it has}} awarded the Cruze a full five stars in their independent <b>crash</b> <b>safety</b> test, with 35.04 {{out of a possible}} 37 points. The following July, the China New Car Assessment Program (C-NCAP) awarded the Cruze a maximum five stars in their independent <b>crash</b> <b>safety</b> test. The Cruze SE 1.6-liter tested scored a maximum of 16 points in side-impact collision, 14.44 in front-end collision, and 15.73 in the 40percent frontal offset collision. Euro NCAP released its rating in November, with the Chevrolet Cruze again receiving the full five-star grading. While the Cruze scored 96percent for adult protection, and 84percent for child occupant protection, Euro NCAP's figure for pedestrian protection is quoted at significantly lower 34percent. In December 2009, the South Korean-specification Cruze—the Daewoo Lacetti Premiere—received the top rating of five stars from the Korean New Car Assessment Program (KNCAP). According to KNCAP, the Lacetti Premiere received the five-star rating in the frontal, offset frontal, side, and whiplash tests.|$|E

25|$|Replacing the Defender with a {{new model}} {{has been in the}} {{planning}} stages for many years. The Defender did not meet U.S. safety requirements after 1997 and since then Land Rover offered U.S. buyers the more luxurious LR2 (Freelander) and LR4 (Discovery) and Range Rover instead. The need for total replacement has been brought about by 2015's new European regulations regarding <b>crash</b> <b>safety</b> for pedestrians that render the Defender's design obsolete (see more at Euro NCAP).|$|E
25|$|The Singapore {{government}} {{accepts the}} <b>crash</b> <b>safety</b> {{standards of the}} EU and Japan.

Cars may be privately imported into Singapore if they have an EU Certificate of Conformity or the Japanese Completion Inspection Certificate, both of which incorporate emissions and safety standards. Not all cars sold in Singapore have been tested by the EuroNCAP, a car-safety testing organisation jointly operated by several European government agencies, that crash tests cars that can be legally sold in several European countries.|$|E
25|$|EyeSight is Subaru's {{active safety}} system that uses twin CCD cameras, {{simulating}} stereoscopic vision. It {{was first introduced}} in Japan only as Active Driving Assist (ADA) in 1999. When activated, it actively monitors the road through the windshield-mounted cameras, and can react to driving conditions and possibly avert collisions. Models equipped with EyeSight earned the highest possible rating in the IIHS front <b>crash</b> <b>safety</b> test. Unlike other manufacturers offering stereoscopic cameras for drivers-asset purposes, the Eyesight system's cameras are not bonded to the windshield. Thus, if the windshield is dirty on the inside, it may affect the system's performance.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{developed}} a traffic {{safety management system}} (TSMS) for improving safety on county paved roads in Wyoming. TSMS is a strategic and systematic process to improve safety of roadway network. When funding is limited, {{it is important to}} identify the best combination of safety improvement projects to provide the most benefits to society in terms of crash reduction. The factors included in the proposed optimization model are annual safety budget, roadway inventory, roadway functional classification, historical <b>crashes,</b> <b>safety</b> improvement countermeasures, cost and crash reduction factors (CRFs) associated with safety improvement countermeasures, and average daily traffics (ADTs). This paper demonstrated how the proposed model can identify the best combination of safety improvement projects to maximize the safety benefits in terms of reducing overall crash frequency. Although the proposed methodology was implemented on the county paved road network of Wyoming, it could be easily modified for potential implementation on the Wyoming state highway system. Other states can also benefit by implementing a similar program within their jurisdictions...|$|R

25|$|In 1993 Land Rover {{launched}} the Defender in the North American (i.e. the United States and Canada) market. Although the Range Rover {{had been sold}} there since 1987, {{this was the first}} time utility Land Rovers had been sold since 1974. To comply with the strict United States Department of Transportation regulations, ranging from <b>crash</b> <b>safety</b> to lighting, as well as the very different requirements of American buyers, the North American Specification (NAS) Defenders were extensively modified. The initial export batch was 525 Defender 110 County 4x4s: 500 to the United States and 25 to Canada. They were fitted with the 3.9-litre V8 petrol engine and five-speed manual transmission. All of the vehicles were white (except one specifically painted black for Ralph Lauren). They sported full external roll-cages and larger side-indicator and tail-lights. All were equipped with the factory-fitted air conditioning system.|$|E
25|$|Many safety {{improvements}} {{were made}} in the sport following Senna's and Ratzenberger's deaths and Barrichello's crash. These include improved crash barriers, redesigned tracks, higher <b>crash</b> <b>safety</b> standards (such as larger sills along the driver cockpit) and major cuts to engine power. The Tamburello corner {{and other parts of the}} Imola circuit were altered for 1995. This was despite calls for action in 1989, after a serious high-speed crash in which Senna's friend, Gerhard Berger, suffered burns to his hand. No action took place after that crash because, following an inspection by Senna and Berger, they ended up siding with officials who had, for years, claimed that the wall could not be moved further back due to a river nearby. Revised on-track medical procedures also saw personnel hold up curtains at crash sites, to prevent the public from viewing distressing images as had occurred on live television with Senna.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a history}} of what would now be {{considered}} light rail vehicles operating on heavy rail rapid transit tracks in the US, {{especially in the case of}} interurban streetcars. Notable examples are Lehigh Valley Transit trains running on the Philadelphia and Western Railroad high-speed third rail line (now the Norristown High Speed Line). Such arrangements are almost impossible now, due to the Federal Railroad Administration refusing (for <b>crash</b> <b>safety</b> reasons) to allow non-FRA compliant railcars (i.e., subway and light rail vehicles) to run on the same tracks at the same times as compliant railcars, which includes locomotives and standard railroad passenger and freight equipment. Notable exceptions in the US are the NJ Transit River Line from Camden to Trenton and Austin's Capital MetroRail, which have received exemptions to the provision that light rail operations occur only during daytime hours and Conrail freight service only at night, with several hours separating one operation from the other. The O-Train Trillium Line in Ottawa also has freight service at certain hours.|$|E
