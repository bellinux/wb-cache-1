The study investigated the course books used {{in order to understand}} to what extent <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> is advocated in such books. To this end, all question types in general and Critical Reading Questions (CRQs), Vocabulary In Context (VIC), Literal Comprehension (LC), and Extended Reasoning (ER), in particular were identified. The focus of the study was on ER <b>questions,</b> leading to <b>critical</b> <b>thinking.</b> The reason was that the crucial problem of the students lies in textually implicit information of the texts, that is, ER questions. To classify the questions for CRQs, Peterson`s (2008) model was employed, and to specify <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>question</b> types, a framework proposed by Academic Skills Unit (2008) was used as reference. To collect the data entirely, the researcher identified the total number of percentages of frequencies of questions related to the passages in the course books of Reading Comprehension I, II and III.

As such, we posed <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>questions</b> in comments to trigger metacognitive thinking through mistakes identification and self-correction, instead of spoon-fed them directly with model answers. Our study shows that giving descriptive feedback with clear indicative clues helped students recognize and learn from their own mistakes faster, and this contributed greatly towards emotional satisfaction and self-achievement in the learning and self-correction process.

The findings seem to suggest that teachers’ focus on each CRQ type strongly influences students’ attention when reading different passages. It was noted that students had serious problems with textually implicit information included in reading passages. Given this finding and the fact that the observations illustrated most teachers devote the bulk of their attention to other CRQs, this study highlights the need for raising teachers’ awareness of ER-based reading comprehension questions.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{tries to}} deal critically {{with the common}} utilization of media literacy as skilled-based initiative or participatory culture building. It raises {{a number of questions}} about the process of participation and production that have often been ignored by a media literacy research. Based on work I did directly with two communities of youth Latina/os in weekly media workshops that had real community impact, I examine the participatory dynamics surrounding three video productions that responded to stereotypes and the topics of community service and immigration in corporate news media representations of the Latina/o community and the U. S. -Mexico border. I look first at youth media participation in the context of afterschool and summer camp programs, and second at news media representations of the Latina/o population and the U.

My aim in this context is to understand media literacy as a form of critical media participation that emphasizes the processes of production, <b>critical</b> <b>thinking,</b> power dynamics, and decision-making over the development of specific types of skills typically thought to be the core of “participatory culture. ”Exploring participants’ responses to the case studies through a framework of Participatory Action Research, I suggest that such efforts can help media educators achieve the pedagogical goal of enabling participants not only to develop <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> and <b>question</b> media representations or existing arrangements of power, but also to produce videos that reflect a deep appreciation for learning about media and the communities they live i...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the years}} the author has noticed his {{students}} seem to be becoming more conservative, politically. Even global warming and the impending environmental crisis bother few of them. They are inclined to regard our economic system and the status quo as entirely legitimate. That society could, or should be radically altered and improved has not occurred to most of them. If we don't teach our students to question society, and {{to see that it}} could be better, there is little hope that the next generation will endeavour to improve the world. This paper analyses the (conservative) way Economics typically explains two major social problems: poverty, and environmental degradation. Conservatives represent poverty and environmental degradation as unexpected aberrations in our otherwise benevolent capitalist economic system. Their solutions are usually minimalist and don't tamper with the system. More radical teachers view environmental destruction and poverty as inevitable outcomes of capitalism. These are symptoms of a more fundamental problem: modern capitalism. This is what needs to be fixed. This paper describes the essence of these two different perspectives. Furthermore, it summarises experiences in teaching <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> about <b>questions</b> of poverty and environmental degradation within an Economics curriculum which emphasizes a more conservative approach...|$|R

It is the also a democratic way of handling a class, where each student is given equal opportunity to interact and put forth their views. A discussion taking place in a classroom can be either facilitated by a teacher or by a student. A discussion could also follow a presentation or a demonstration. Class discussions can enhance student understanding, add context to academic content, broaden student perspectives, highlight opposing viewpoints, reinforce knowledge, build confidence, and support community in learning. The opportunities for meaningful and engaging in-class discussion may vary widely, depending on the subject matter and format of the course. Motivations for holding planned classroom discussion, however, remain consistent.An effective classroom discussion can be achieved by probing more questions among the students, paraphrasing the information received, using <b>questions</b> to develop <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> with <b>questions</b> like [...] "Can we take this one step further?;" [...] "What solutions do you think might solve this problem?;" [...] "How does this relate to what we have learned about..?;" [...] "What are the differences between ... ?;""How does this relate to your own experience?;" [...] "What do you think causes .... ?;" [...] "What are the implications of .... ?" ...|$|R
