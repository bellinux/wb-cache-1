40|$|The {{problem of}} illegal {{immigration}} has being a growing concern within the EU. The European Union has always been hocked {{in the struggle against}} <b>clandestine</b> <b>immigration.</b> From the Council of Tamper in 1999, the member states are hocked to fight against <b>clandestine</b> <b>immigration.</b> Large numbers of people moves across the borders of the EU for the sake of job opportunities. Sometimes, people cross the border independently, while other times, they do so collectively with other people. The corrupt custom officers and police are strong facilitators of this illicit immigration of these people. Also, the need for people is exploited by an organized crime groups operating in this field. Illegal immigration and trafficking of human beings are combined activities of organized crimes. These can be seen mostly as a labor market problem, and the EU is trying to frame a policy regulating both labor markets and migratory flows. This therefore constitutes the main aim of this study...|$|R
50|$|Brillant {{joined the}} Hagana Harbor Platoon, which later on became the Flotilla 13 Navy {{commando}} unit, and {{took part in}} several of their operations. During this time, Brillant took part in converting the <b>clandestine</b> <b>immigration</b> ships of Hagana into first improvised Israeli Navy ships for the War of Independence. This work was camouflaged since the British Mandate only left Haifa harbor in June 1948.|$|R
50|$|During {{the early}} years of the camp's operation, {{residents}} mounted several protest campaigns against Allied policy, particularly regarding the restrictions on Jewish immigration to Mandatory Palestine. The Zionist youth movements organized communal groups called kibbutzim for training young pioneers.

50|$|Many {{civil rights}} activist and civil {{associations}} spoke out against the new immigration law that criminalized illegal aliens, which implied that fishermen helping a sinking immigrant boat {{in order to save}} lives could be prosecuted for helping <b>clandestine</b> <b>immigration</b> (as happened in 2004 {{in the case of the}} ship Cap Anamour, which was impounded for saving from the sea 39 Darfur immigrants). The Portopalo tragedy was cited as an example of bad behavior caused by unfair immigration laws.|$|R

50|$|The goal of {{resettlement}} carried its own hurdles. Since {{before the}} war, Palestine {{had been under}} control of Great Britain, which severely restricted the immigration of Europe’s Jewish refugees. <b>Clandestine</b> <b>immigration</b> went on {{in spite of the}} blockades, largely because of the work of Bricha and Aliyah Bet, two organized movements partially financed and supplied by JDC. When the British began interning illegal Jewish immigrants in detention camps on Cyprus, JDC furnished medical, educational, and social services for the detainees.|$|R
50|$|Initially {{welcoming}} Soviet occupation, Moscovici {{grew increasingly}} disillusioned with communist politics, and noted {{the incidence of}} anti-Semitism among Red Army soldiers. As the communist regime was taking over and the Cold War started, he helped Zionist dissidents cross the border illegally. For this, {{he was involved in}} a 1947 trial held in Timişoara, and decided to leave Romania definitively. Choosing <b>clandestine</b> <b>immigration,</b> he arrived in France a year later, having passed through Hungary and Austria, and having spent time in a refugee camp in Italy.|$|R
40|$|From the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea {{stretches}} a {{strip of}} land more or less six hundred kilometres wide, inhabited by more than sixty million people belonging to seven nations. For decades, the countries that comprise this region were a buffer zone against the USSR, and today they are becoming the European Union's buffer zone against <b>clandestine</b> <b>immigration</b> and trafficking of all sorts.

50|$|Later, {{he fought}} under Orde Wingate. Between 1945 and 1948, {{he played a}} leading role in the <b>clandestine</b> <b>immigration</b> {{enterprise}} in Palestine, commanding four Aliyah Bet ships: Knesset Israel, the Exodus, Atzma'ut and Kibbutz Galuyot. After the establishment of the State of Israel Harel studied mechanical engineering at MIT in the United States. Just before he finished his studies, Moshe Dayan, as Chief of Staff, called him back to Israel to investigate the Lavon Affair and made him head of Unit 131, an Israel Defense Forces intelligence unit.|$|R
50|$|In 1942, eleven hundred Haganah volunteers {{joined the}} Royal Navy, mostly in {{technical}} roles (12 {{of them were}} officers by the nomination agreement of the Jewish Agency with the Royal Navy). A few reached sea service and combat service. Two of them served with the Fleet Air Arm (FAA), {{one of whom was}} Edmond Wilhelm Brillant and the other Zvi Avidror. With the end of the Second World War, Palyam members took part in <b>clandestine</b> <b>immigration</b> activities, bringing Europe's Jews to Palestine, as well as commando actions against Royal Navy deportation ships. Royal Navy volunteers, meanwhile, rejoined the Haganah.|$|R
5000|$|He {{was born}} in Castelbuono in the {{province}} of Palermo and started his journalistic career in 1990 at the Giornale di Sicilia until 1997 when he moved to ANSA. In 1998 he also started to work for La Stampa. In 2003 he was elected journalist of the year by Unione Nazionale Cronisti (Unci). He reported on the Mafia and <b>clandestine</b> <b>immigration</b> on the Sicilian coast.

40|$|The ever {{increasing}} importance {{given to the}} study of migration within the field of international relations is not exempt from the powerful influence of other disciplines such as the sociology and anthropology of migration, {{while at the same time}} being burdened with ideology, political instrumentalism and relative scientific authenticity. In the context of Spanish foreign relations the issue of Asian immigration must be considered from a more global perspective which takes into account Spanish political maneuvering and the measures taken regarding border controls and <b>clandestine</b> <b>immigration</b> in general, thus enabling an understanding of the philosophy which has influenced Spanish-Asian relations concerning foreign policy vis-à-vis immigration...|$|R
50|$|Under the Phanariots, Moldavia was {{the first}} state in Eastern Europe to abolish serfdom, when Constantine Mavrocordatos, summoned the boyars in 1749 to a great council in {{the church of the}} Three Hierarchs in Iași. In Transylvania, this reform did not take place until 1784, as a {{consequence}} of the bloody revolt of the Romanian peasantry under Horea, Cloşca and Crişan. Bessarabia was now still more attractive to the Polish and Russian serfs. The former had to serve their masters free for 150 days every year, and the latter were virtually slaves. <b>Clandestine</b> <b>immigration</b> from Poland and the Ukraine flowed particularly to the boundaries of Bessarabia, around Hotin and Cernăuţi.|$|R
40|$|By its {{geographic}} position, Spain is {{the forced}} way {{of thousands of}} North African and Sub-Saharan citizens who try to arrive and to settle in Europe. But, in addition, in the last years, Spain has become a receiving country of foreign citizens who, {{in a situation of}} regularity or of administrative irregularity remain more or less continuously in its territory. This fact, along with the restrictive criteria imposed by the European norms and the visa requirement from May 1991 for Moroccan subjects, is the cause for the use of illegal or <b>clandestine</b> routes for <b>immigration</b> originating in Morocco, both for Moroccan citizens as well as Sub-Saharans who come to Morocco with the intention of crossing the Straits of Gibraltar. In this study the different mechanisms; mainly legal, used by the Spanish State in their fight against <b>clandestine</b> <b>immigration,</b> as well as its effects in the immigration originating from North Africa are analyze...|$|R
50|$|A {{slightly}} modified {{variant of the}} Type 206 (which includes the distinctive dome, or bulge, {{in the front of}} the boat), the Gal-class submarine for the Israeli Navy was built to Israeli specifications as the Vickers Type 540 in the UK rather than Germany for political reasons. Three such boats were built, the first being commissioned in 1976. When the Israeli navy received its new Dolphin-class submarines (also built by HDW), the Gals were retired. As of 2006, one had been scrapped and two had been sent to HDW in an attempt to find a buyer for them. When no buyer was found, one of the submarines was returned to Israel for display in the <b>Clandestine</b> <b>Immigration</b> and Naval Museum.|$|R
50|$|ZIM {{was founded}} in 1945, by the Jewish Agency and the Histadrut (General Federation of Laborers in the Land of Israel). The first ship was {{purchased}} in partnership with Harris and Dixon (based in London) in 1947. This vessel was refurbished, renamed SS Kedma, and sailed to the future state of Israel {{in the summer of}} 1947. During her first years, her main task was transporting hundreds of thousands of immigrants to the emerging state. Some of the other ships that had been used for <b>clandestine</b> <b>immigration</b> before the establishment of Israel as a state were confiscated by the British mandate authorities and later joined the company's fleet. The company continued to purchase more ships, among them SS Negba, SS Artza and SS Galila.|$|R
