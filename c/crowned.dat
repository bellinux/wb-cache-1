5|$|Coronations may be {{performed}} {{for a person}} other than the reigning monarch. In 1170, Henry the Young King, heir apparent to the throne, was <b>crowned</b> as a second king of England, subordinate to his father HenryII; such coronations were common practice in mediaeval France and Germany, but this {{is only one of}} two instances of its kind in England (the other being that of Ecgfrith of Mercia in 796, <b>crowned</b> whilst his father, Offa of Mercia, was still alive). More commonly, a king's wife is <b>crowned</b> as queen consort. If the king is already married {{at the time of his}} coronation, a joint coronation of both king and queen may {{be performed}}. The first such coronation was of Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine in 1154; seventeen such coronations have been performed, including that of the co-rulers William III and MaryII. The most recent was that of GeorgeVI and the former Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon in 1937. If the king married, or remarried, after his coronation, or if his wife were not <b>crowned</b> with him for some other reason, she might be <b>crowned</b> in a separate ceremony. The first such separate coronation of a queen consort in England was that of Matilda of Flanders in 1068; the last was Anne Boleyn's in 1533. The most recent king to wed post-coronation, CharlesII, did not have a separate coronation for his bride, Catherine of Braganza. In some instances, the king's wife was simply unable to join him in the coronation ceremony due to circumstances preventing her from doing so. In 1821, George IV's estranged wife Caroline of Brunswick was prevented from being <b>crowned</b> with him and when she showed up at Westminster Abbey she was denied entry and turned away. Following the English Civil War, Oliver Cromwell declined the crown but underwent a coronation in all but name in his second investiture as Lord Protector in 1657. A Prince of Wales, usually the monarch's heir apparent, may also be <b>crowned</b> in a ceremony known as an investiture.|$|E

5|$|The {{last heir}} {{apparent}} to the French throne to be <b>crowned</b> during his father's lifetime was the future Philip II, while the only <b>crowned</b> heir apparent to the English throne was Henry the Young King, who was first <b>crowned</b> alone {{and then with}} his wife, Margaret of France. The practice was eventually abandoned by all kingdoms that had adopted it, as the rules of primogeniture became stronger. The last coronation of an heir apparent, {{with the exception of}} investitures of the Prince of Wales in 1911 and 1969, was the coronation of the future Emperor Ferdinand I of Austria as junior King of Hungary in 1830.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} tree <b>crown</b> envelope shape modeling {{from the}} perspective of optical passive remote sensing. The aims are 1) to review the specific requirements of <b>crown</b> shape models and ground measurement techniques in optical remote sensing, and 2) to present preliminary results from empirical, parametric <b>crown</b> shape and volume modeling of Scots pine and Norway spruce applicable in Finland. Results indicated that the basic dimensions (maximum radius, its height and <b>crown</b> length) of tree <b>crowns</b> were better predicted for pines, but the profile shape of {{the upper part of the}} <b>crowns</b> varied more than in spruce. Pine <b>crowns</b> were also slightly less concave than spruce <b>crowns.</b> No regularities were observed concerning the lower part of the <b>crowns.</b> The asymmetry of <b>crowns</b> increased as a function of tree age for both species, spruce <b>crowns</b> being more asymmetric than pine <b>crowns.</b> A comparison of measured <b>crown</b> volume with several simple geometrical <b>crown</b> shape envelopes showed that using a cone as a <b>crown</b> shape model for Scots pine and Norway spruce underestimates <b>crown</b> volume most severely. Other <b>crown</b> envelope shape models (e. g. ellipsoids) rendered <b>crown</b> volumes closer to the measured volume and did not differ considerably from each other...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Objective. The aim of {{the study}} was to provide data on the {{fracture}} strength of monolithic high translucent Y-TZP <b>crowns</b> and porcelain-veneered high translucent Y-TZP <b>crown</b> cores and to compare that data with the fracture strength of porcelain-veneered Y-TZP <b>crown</b> cores and monolithic lithium disilicate glass-ceramic <b>crowns.</b> Materials and methods. Sixty standardized <b>crowns</b> divided into six groups (n = 10) were fabricated: monolithic high translucent Y-TZP <b>crowns,</b> brand A, monolithic high translucent Y-TZP <b>crowns,</b> brand B, veneered high translucent Y-TZP <b>crown</b> cores, brand A, veneered high translucent Y-TZP <b>crown</b> cores, brand B, heat-pressed monolithic lithium disilicate <b>crowns</b> and veneered Y-TZP <b>crown</b> cores. All <b>crowns</b> were thermocycled, cemented onto dies, cyclically pre-loaded and finally loaded to fracture. Results. The monolithic Y-TZP groups showed significantly higher fracture strength (2795 N and 3038 N) compared to all other groups. The fracture strength in the veneered Y-TZP group (2229 N) was significantly higher than the monolithic lithium disilicate group (1856 N) and the veneered high translucent Y-TZP groups (1480 N and 1808 N). Conclusions. The fracture strength of monolithic high translucent Y-TZP <b>crowns</b> is considerably higher than that of porcelain-veneered Y-TZP <b>crown</b> cores, porcelain-veneered high translucent Y-TZP <b>crown</b> cores and monolithic lithium disilicate <b>crowns.</b> The fracture strength of a <b>crown</b> made of monolithic high translucent Y-TZP is, with a large safety margin, sufficient for clinical use for the majority of patients. Porcelain-veneered Y-TZP <b>crown</b> cores show higher fracture resistance than monolithic lithium disilicate <b>crowns...</b>|$|R

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the <b>crown</b> system and its {{association}} with plant growth and development in spring cereals.

Two greenhouse experiments were performed using PVC tubes. Low temperature and deep seeding reduced percentage and rate of emergence but increased <b>crown</b> number, <b>crown</b> depth, and <b>crown</b> weight in most genotypes. <b>Crown</b> number, <b>crown</b> depth and <b>crown</b> weight showed increased associations with seminal root, whole root, and shoot weight at low temperature and deep seeding in most genotypes. Deep plantings showed that <b>crown</b> systems of barley can be classified as unicrown, bicrown and multicrown types with some variants. One line produced plants with no subcrown internode under 12. 5 cm planting. Our results suggested that the <b>crown</b> is a potential source of <b>crown</b> roots and tillers...|$|R
