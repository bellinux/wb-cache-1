Like amazon parrots and macaws, cockatoos frequently develop <b>cloacal</b> papillomas. The relationship with malignancy is unknown, as is the cause, although a parrot papilloma virus has been isolated from an African grey parrot with the condition.|$|E
5|$|Nestlings, fledglings, and juveniles have brown plumage and pink-brown {{bills with}} shorter tails than adults. Young males develop blue tail {{feathers}} and darker bills by late summer or autumn (following a spring or summer breeding season), while young females develop light blue tails. By the subsequent spring, all males are fertile and have developed <b>cloacal</b> protuberances, which store sperm. In contrast, during the breeding season, fertile females develop oedematous brood patches, which are bare areas on their bellies.|$|E
5|$|The third suborder, Sirenoidea, {{contains}} the four species of sirens, {{which are in}} a single family, Sirenidae. Members of this order are eel-like aquatic salamanders with much reduced forelimbs and no hind limbs. Some of their features are primitive while others are derived. Fertilisation {{is likely to be}} external as sirenids lack the <b>cloacal</b> glands used by male salamandrids to produce spermatophores and the females lack spermathecae for sperm storage. Despite this, the eggs are laid singly, a behaviour not conducive for external fertilisation.|$|E
5|$|Most spiders convert {{nitrogenous}} {{waste products}} into uric acid, {{which can be}} excreted as a dry material. Malphigian tubules ("little tubes") extract these wastes from the blood in the hemocoel and dump them into the <b>cloacal</b> chamber, from which they are expelled through the anus. Production of uric acid and its removal via Malphigian tubules are a water-conserving feature that has evolved independently in several arthropod lineages that can live far away from water, for example the tubules of insects and arachnids develop from completely {{different parts of the}} embryo. However, a few primitive spiders, the sub-order Mesothelae and infra-order Mygalomorphae, retain the ancestral arthropod nephridia ("little kidneys"), which use large amounts of water to excrete nitrogenous waste products as ammonia.|$|E
5|$|The kidneys and {{excretory}} {{system are}} {{much the same}} as in other reptiles, but crocodilians do not have a bladder. In fresh water, the osmolality (the concentration of solutes that contribute to a solution's osmotic pressure) in the plasma is much higher {{than it is in the}} surrounding water. The animals are well-hydrated, and the urine in the cloaca is abundant and dilute, nitrogen being excreted as ammonium bicarbonate. Sodium loss is low and mainly takes place through the skin in freshwater conditions. In seawater, the opposite is true. The osmolality in the plasma is lower than the surrounding water, which is dehydrating for the animal. The <b>cloacal</b> urine is much more concentrated, white, and opaque, with the nitrogenous waste being mostly excreted as insoluble uric acid.|$|E
5|$|There are two kidneys located dorsally, {{near the}} roof of the body cavity. Their job is to filter the blood of {{metabolic}} waste and transport the urine via ureters to the urinary bladder where it is stored before being passed out periodically through the <b>cloacal</b> vent. Larvae and most aquatic adult amphibians excrete the nitrogen as ammonia in large quantities of dilute urine, while terrestrial species, with a greater need to conserve water, excrete the less toxic product urea. Some tree frogs with limited access to water excrete most of their metabolic waste as uric acid.|$|E
5|$|Tuatara, {{along with}} other, now extinct {{members of the}} order Sphenodontia, belong to the {{superorder}} Lepidosauria, the only surviving taxon within Lepidosauromorpha. Squamates and tuatara both show caudal autotomy (loss of the tail-tip when threatened), and have transverse <b>cloacal</b> slits. The origin of the tuatara probably lies close to the split between the Lepidosauromorpha and the Archosauromorpha. Though tuatara resemble lizards, the similarity is superficial, because the family has several characteristics unique among reptiles. The typical lizard shape is very common for the early amniotes; the oldest known fossil of a reptile, the Hylonomus, resembles a modern lizard.|$|E
5|$|Although {{adapted to}} {{terrestrial}} life, frogs resemble freshwater fish in {{their inability to}} conserve body water effectively. When they are on land, much water is lost by evaporation from the skin. The excretory system {{is similar to that}} of mammals and there are two kidneys that remove nitrogenous products from the blood. Frogs produce large quantities of dilute urine in order to flush out toxic products from the kidney tubules. The nitrogen is excreted as ammonia by tadpoles and aquatic frogs but mainly as urea, a less toxic product, by most terrestrial adults. A few species of tree frog with little access to water excrete the even less toxic uric acid. The urine passes along paired ureters to the urinary bladder from which it is vented periodically into the cloaca. All bodily wastes exit the body through the cloaca which terminates in a <b>cloacal</b> vent.|$|E
5|$|Female loggerheads first {{reproduce}} {{between the}} ages of 17 and 33, and their mating period may last more than six weeks. They court their mates, but these behaviors have not been thoroughly examined. Male forms of courtship behavior include nuzzling, biting, and head and flipper movements. Studies suggest females produce <b>cloacal</b> pheromones to indicate reproductive ability. Before mating, the male approaches a female and attempts to mount her, while she resists. Next, the male and female begin to circle each other. If the male has competitors, the female may let the males struggle with each other. The winner then mounts the female; the male's curved claws usually damage the shoulders of the female's shell during this process. Other courting males bite the male while he is attempting to copulate, damaging his flippers and tail, possibly exposing bones. Such damage can cause the male to dismount and may require weeks to heal.|$|E
25|$|There is {{initially}} a <b>cloacal</b> membrane, composed of ectoderm and endoderm, reaching from {{the umbilical cord}} to the tail, separating the cloaca from the exterior. After {{the separation of the}} rectum from the dorsal part of the cloaca, the ventral part of the <b>cloacal</b> membrane becomes the urogenital membrane.|$|E
25|$|Mesoderm {{extends to}} the midventral line for some {{distance}} behind the umbilical cord, and forms {{the lower part of}} the abdominal wall; it ends below in a prominent swelling, the <b>cloacal</b> tubercle, which after the separation of the rectum becomes the genital tubercle. Dorsally to this tubercle the sides aren't really fused. Rather, the urogenital part of the <b>cloacal</b> membrane separates the ingrowing sheets of mesoderm.|$|E
25|$|During mating, males {{make use}} of their spurs to arouse the female. They aggressively press their <b>cloacal</b> regions hard against the female body, while {{continuously}} scratching her with their spurs. This can produce a scratching sound. Mating approaches its climax when the stimulus of the males' spurs induces the female snake to raise her <b>cloacal</b> region, allowing the cloacae of the two snakes to move together. The male then coils his tail, surrounding the female and they copulate. The strongest and largest male is often the victor. However, females are physically much larger and stronger and may decide to choose from among the males. Courtship and mating occur almost exclusively in water.|$|E
25|$|The bursa of fabricius, {{also known}} as the <b>cloacal</b> bursa, is a lymphoid organ which aids in the {{production}} of B lymphocytes during humoral immunity. The bursa of fabricius is present during juvenile stages but curls up, and in the sparrow is not visible after the sparrow reaches sexual maturity.|$|E
25|$|However, feminizing {{reconstructive}} surgery {{continued to be}} recommended and performed throughout the 1990s on most virilized infant girls with CAH, as well as infants with ambiguity due to androgen insensitivity syndrome, gonadal dysgenesis, and some XY infants with severe genital birth defects such as <b>cloacal</b> exstrophy. Masculinizing {{reconstructive surgery}} continued on boys with severe hypospadias and the other conditions outlined above, with continued modifications and refinements intended to reduce unsatisfactory outcomes.|$|E
25|$|Most male {{birds have}} no phallus. In the males of species without a phallus, sperm {{is stored in}} the seminal glomera within the <b>cloacal</b> {{protuberance}} prior to copulation. During copulation, the female moves her tail {{to the side and}} the male either mounts the female from behind or in front (as in the stitchbird), or moves very close to her. The cloacae then touch, so that the sperm can enter the female's reproductive tract. This can happen very fast, sometimes in less than half a second.|$|E
25|$|In {{both sexes}} the phallic {{portion of the}} {{urogenital}} sinus extends on to the under surface of the <b>cloacal</b> tubercle as far forward as the apex. At the apex {{the walls of the}} phallic portion come together and fuse, obliterating the urogenital opening. Instead, a solid plate, the urethral plate, is formed. The remainder of the phallic portion is for a time tubular, and then, by the absorption of the urogenital membrane, it establishes a communication with the exterior. This opening is for a while the primitive urogenital opening, and it extends forward to the corona glandis.|$|E
25|$|A {{range of}} options have been {{proposed}} as possible alternatives to beak trimming including modifying the genetics of domesticated poultry to reduce cannibalistic tendencies. For confined housing where light control is possible, lowering light intensity so that birds cannot see each other as easily reduces antagonistic encounters and aggressive behaviour. Enrichment devices, introduced at an early age, such as simple objects hung in a habitat, can reduce aggressive behavior. Dividing the population into smaller group sizes reduces cannibalism. Proper body weight management that avoids underweight pullets reduces the probability of underweight pullets with uterine prolapse that leads to <b>cloacal</b> cannibalism.|$|E
25|$|A major {{direct cost}} of sexual {{coercion}} is physical injury. Male seed beetles (Coleoptera: Bruchidae) have sclerotized spine on their genitalia, which penetrate the female and leave melanized scars. Females can be physically injured from just one mating, {{and the more}} a female mates, the more scarring forms in the copulatory duct. In guppies, the male’s gonopodium can cause damage when forcefully inserted, causing <b>cloacal</b> damage to the females. In fowl, females can be physically injured during forceful copulations. Also, semen transferred from the males can contain pathogens and fecal matter, {{which can lead to}} disease and decrease female fitness. In elephant seals, physical injury happens very often. In fact, mating leads to 1 in every 1,000 female elephant seals getting killed. Other species in which the females (and/or their offspring) are injured or even killed include lions, rodents, farm cats, crabeater seals, elephant seals, sea lions, wild Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata), red-sided garter snakes (Thamnophis sirtalis parietalis), and newts (N. viridescens).|$|E
25|$|The {{reproductive}} {{strategy of}} the northern two-lined salamander begins with an elaborate courtship. It may take place from September (in the southern parts of its range) to May (in the north). Observations of courtship in the species were made based on individuals held in captivity by Noble (1929), and a summary of these observations are: the male becomes restless, as if searching for a female. Upon finding the female, he will lift her by pushing his snout under her <b>cloacal</b> region or chest. The male adopts a distinct posture, bending his body laterally around her snout. The pair may remain in this position {{for an hour or}} more. The female eventually slips out of this posture and begins to straddle the male's tail with her fore limbs, while pressing her chin against the base of the male's tail. The male may undulate his tail from side to side in a slow and exaggerated manner, and the female moves her head from side to side, alternately from the male’s tail. This tail-straddling walk may last for over an hour, at which point the male deposits a spermatophore, leading the female to walk over it, at which time she may either accept or reject the male’s sperm. The spermatophore of this species is described as conical, 2.5mm in height and with a colorless stalk that tapers towards the tip.|$|E

He took their <b>cloacal</b> temperatures, marked them with dye, and then dosed them with radioactive iodine, which enabled him to locate the elusive reptiles later with a Geiger counter." [...] In 1966, Stebbins produced what became his best-known book, A Field Guide to Western Reptiles and Amphibians (Peterson Field Guides), which Peterson called [...] "a classic... {{one of the most}} beautiful as well as scholarly works in the series".|$|E

Though there is diversity in snout and tooth shape, all crocodilian species have essentially the same body morphology. They have solidly built, lizard-like bodies with elongated, flattened snouts and laterally compressed tails. Their limbs are reduced in size; the front feet have five digits with little or no webbing, and the hind feet have four webbed digits and a rudimentary fifth. The skeleton is somewhat typical of tetrapods, although the skull, pelvis and ribs are specialised; in particular, the cartilaginous processes of the ribs allow the thorax to collapse during diving and the structure of the pelvis can accommodate large masses of food, or more air in the lungs. Both sexes have a cloaca, a single chamber and outlet {{at the base of the}} tail into which the intestinal, urinary and genital tracts open. It houses the penis in males and the clitoris in females. The crocodilian penis is permanently erect and relies on <b>cloacal</b> muscles for eversion and elastic ligaments and a tendon for recoil. The testes or ovaries are located near the kidneys.|$|E
500|$|The eastern {{green mamba}} is solitary, except during {{breeding}} season, {{when they are}} most active and males engage in combat and males and females mate. Gravid females tend to be sedentary, but males will actively search out and court females during the long rainy season, which is between the months of April and June. Males have been observed engaging in agonistic behaviour and may fight each other over potential mating opportunities, or possibly to establish a dominance hierarchy. Typically, a male initiates a fight by moving {{on top of the}} other’s body and tongue-flicking, after which the two snakes “intertwine their necks and bodies, and push against each other” in an attempt to pin each other's head repeatedly to the ground. Male-male combat can last for several hours, but combat between males of this species don't ever include biting {{and the nature of the}} combat is never as aggressive and/or vicious as commonly seen among the eastern green mamba's much larger cousin, the black mamba. Males locate females by following a scent trail. The male courts the female by aligning his body along the female’s while rapidly tongue-flicking. Depending on whether the female is receptive to mating, she will lift her tail and <b>cloacal</b> juxtaposition will follow shortly. Courtship and mating take place in the trees, after which the female lays anywhere between 4-17 eggs (average of 10 to 15 eggs are laid), which occurs in the summer months of October and November. The eggs are white and elongated, usually measuring 65x35 millimetres. The eggs are usually laid in a hollow tree, among decaying vegetation, or leaf litter. The incubation period is 10 to 12 weeks. When the young emerge from the eggs, they are approximately [...] or around an average of [...] in length, and they're highly venomous right at birth.

2500|$|By 1970, {{surgeons}} {{still considered}} {{it easier to}} [...] "dig a hole" [...] than [...] "build a pole," [...] but had abandoned [...] "barbaric" [...] clitorectomies in favor of [...] "nerve sparing" [...] clitoral recession and promised orgasms when the girls grew up. Pediatric endocrinology, surgery, child psychology, and sexuality textbooks recommended sex reassignment for a male whose penis was irreparably malformed or [...] "too small to stand to urinate or penetrate a vagina," [...] because the surgeons claimed {{to be able to}} construct vaginas where none existed. The majority of these genetic males who were reassigned and surgically converted had <b>cloacal</b> exstrophy-type malformations or extreme micropenis (typically less than 1.5cm). In 1972 John Money published his influential text on the development of gender identity, and reported successful reassignment at age 22 months of a boy (David Reimer) who had lost his penis to a surgical accident. This experiment proved not to be as successful as Money claimed. David Reimer grew up as a girl, but never identified as one. Academic sexologist Milton Diamond later reported that Reimer failed to identify as female since the age of 9 to 11, making the transition to living as a male at age 15. Reimer later went public with his story to discourage similar medical practices. He later committed suicide, owing to suffering years of severe depression, financial instability, and a troubled marriage.|$|E
2500|$|The common ostrich is well {{adapted to}} hot, arid environments through {{specialization}} of excretory organs. The common ostrich has an extremely long and developed colon {{the length of}} approximately [...] between the [...] and the paired caeca, which are around [...] long. A well developed caeca is also found and {{in combination with the}} rectum forms the microbial fermentation chambers used for carbohydrate breakdown. The catabolism of carbohydrates produces around [...] of water that can be used internally. The majority of their urine is stored in the coprodeum, and the faeces are separately stored in the terminal colon. The coprodeum is located ventral to the terminal rectum and urodeum (where the ureters open). Found between the terminal rectum and coprodeum is a strong sphincter. The coprodeum and cloaca are the main osmoregulatory mechanisms used for the regulation and reabsorption of ions and water, or net water conservation. As expected in a species inhabiting arid regions, dehydration causes a reduction in faecal water, or dry feces. This reduction is believed to be caused by high levels of plasma aldosterone, which leads to rectal absorption of sodium and water. Also expected is the production of hyperosmotic urine; <b>cloacal</b> urine {{has been found to be}} 800 mosmol/L. The U:P (urine:plasma) ratio of the common ostrich is therefore greater than one. Diffusion of water to the coprodeum (where urine is stored) from plasma across the epithelium is voided. This void is believed to be caused by the thick mucosal layering of the coprodeum.|$|E
2500|$|Common ostrich kidneys {{are fairly}} large, {{and so are}} able to hold {{significant}} amounts of solutes. Hence, common ostriches drink relatively large volumes of water daily, and excrete generous quantities of highly concentrated urine. It is when drinking water is unavailable or withdrawn, that the urine becomes highly concentrated with uric acid and urates. It seems that common ostriches who normally drink relatively large amounts of water tend to rely on renal conservation of water when drinking water is scarce within the kidney system. Though {{there have been no}} official detailed renal studies conducted on the flow rate (Poiseuille's Law) and composition of the ureteral urine in the ostrich, knowledge of renal function has been based on samples of <b>cloacal</b> urine, and samples or quantitative collections of voided urine. Studies have shown that the amount of water intake, and dehydration impacts the plasma osmolality and urine osmolality within various sized ostriches. During a normal hydration state of the kidneys, young ostriches tend to have a measured plasma osmolality of 284 mOsm, and urine osmolality of 62 mOsm. Adults have higher rates with a plasma osmolality of 330 mOsm, and a urine osmolality of 163 mOsm. The osmolality of both plasma and urine can alter in regards to whether there is an excess or depleted amount of water present within the kidneys. An interesting fact of common ostriches is that when water is freely available, the urine osmolality can reduce to 60–70 mOsm, [...] not losing any necessary solutes from the kidneys when excess water is excreted. Dehydrated or salt-loaded ostriches can reach a maximal urine osmolality of approximately 800 mOsm. When the plasma osmolality has been measured simultaneously with the maximal osmotic urine, it is seen that the urine:plasma ratio is 2.6:1, the highest encountered among avian species. Along with dehydration, there is also a reduction in flow rate from 20Ld−1 to only 0.3–0.5Ld−1.|$|E

The forked tongue is attached in front of the lower jaw, and can be flicked out and back with great rapidity in the capture of the small insects upon which the frog lives. The posterior nares open into the front of the mouth-- there is no long nasal chamber, and no palate, and there is no long trachea between the epiglottis and the lungs. The oesophagus is less distinct, and passes gradually, so far as external appearances go, into the bag-like stomach, which is much less inflated and transverse than that of the rabbit. The duodenum is not a U-shaped loop, but makes one together with the stomach; the pancreas lies between it and the stomach, and is more compact than the rabbit's. There is no separate pancreatic duct, but the bile duct runs through the pancreas, and receives a series of ducts from that gland as it does so. The ileum is shorter, there is no sacculus rotundus, and the large intestine has no caecum, none of the characteristic sacculations of the rabbit's colon, and does not loop back to the stomach before the rectum section commences.
