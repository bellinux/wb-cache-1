5|$|Like all Hindu Marathi {{people and}} to a varying degree with other Hindu Indians, Diwali is {{celebrate}}d over five days by the Deshastha Brahmins. Deshastha Brahmins celebrate this by waking up {{early in the morning}} and having an Abhyangasnan. People light their houses with lamps and candles, and burst fire crackers over the course of the festival. Special sweets and savouries like Anarse, Karanjya, Chakli, Chiwda and Ladu are prepared for the festival. Colourful Rangoli drawings are made in front of the house. Marathi <b>children</b> <b>make</b> a replica mud fort in memory of Shivaji, the great Maratha king.|$|E
5|$|The emergentist {{coalition}} model {{suggests that}} <b>children</b> <b>make</b> {{use of multiple}} cues to successfully attach a novel label to a novel object. The word learning situation may offer an infant combinations of social, perceptual, cognitive, and linguistic cues. While a range of cues {{are available from the}} start of word learning, it may be the case that not all cues are utilized by the infant when they begin the word learning process. While younger children may only be able to detect a limited number of cues, older, more experienced word learners may be able to make use of a range of cues. For instance, young children seem to focus primarily on perceptual salience, but older children attend to the gaze of caregivers and use the focus of caregivers to direct their word mapping. Therefore, this model argues that principles or cues may be present from the onset of word learning, but the use {{of a wide range of}} cues develops over time.|$|E

25|$|In {{the east}} {{part of the}} Belgian {{province}} of East-Flanders (Aalst) and the west part of West Flanders (Ypres), traditionally children receive presents from St. Martin on November 11, instead of from Saint Nicholas on December 6 or Santa Claus on December 25. They also have lantern processions, for which <b>children</b> <b>make</b> lanterns out of beets. In recent years, the lantern processions have become widespread as a popular ritual, even in Protestant areas of Germany and the Netherlands.

25|$|She also {{suggests}} video games can have social benefits for children, for example, video games {{can provide a}} topic of discussion and something over which children can bond, and can help <b>children</b> <b>make</b> friends; playing video games can increase a child's self-esteem when they are struggling in one aspect of their life, but {{are able to do}} something correctly in a video game; and, children can also learn to take on leadership roles within a multi-player online game. Christopher Ferguson, a psychologist well known for his video game research, conducted a study in which results suggest that violent games reduce depression and hostile feelings in players through mood management.|$|E

25|$|Children's {{food choices}} are also {{influenced}} by family meals. Researchers provided a household eating questionnaire to 18,177 children, ranging in ages 11–21, and discovered that {{four out of five}} parents let their <b>children</b> <b>make</b> their own food decisions. They also discovered that compared to adolescents who ate three or fewer meals per week, those who ate four to five family meals per week were 19% less likely to report poor consumption of vegetables, 22% less likely to report poor consumption of fruits, and 19% less likely to report poor consumption of dairy foods. Adolescents who ate six to seven family meals per week, compared to those who ate three or fewer family meals per week, were 38% less likely to report poor consumption of vegetables, 31% less likely to report poor consumption of fruits, and 27% less likely to report poor consumption of dairy foods. The results of a survey in the UK published in 2010 imply that children raised by their grandparents {{are more likely to be}} obese as adults than those raised by their parents. An American study released in 2011 found the more mothers work the more children are more likely to be overweight or obese.|$|E

He uses Frisbees and a fire extinguisher as weapons to get forward.

However, Satan then takes a dive and goes down for the count. Afterward, Satan reveals that his plan had, in fact, been to bet on Jesus and then throw the fight, winning him a lot of money and real estate from the South Park residents. The townspeople are angered by this, until Stan reminds them that Jesus told them not to bet on Satan. The whole town then asks forgiveness of Jesus, who accepts the apology.

2500|$|Because a {{majority}} of the town's men were away, engaged in fighting on behalf of the Republicans, the town {{at the time of the}} bombing was populated mostly by women and children.

Also, women and children have often been presented by Picasso as the very perfection of mankind. An assault on women and children is, in Picasso's view, directed at the core of mankind."
