40|$|Ureteropelvic {{junction}} (UPJ) obstruction describes various {{causes of}} impaired drainage at the UPJ. Regardless of the cause, {{the end result}} is the same: impedance in the normal flow of urine from the renal pelvis into the proximal ureter, resulting in <b>caliectasis</b> and hydronephrosis. This may lead to progressive deterioration of renal function and, thus, often requires intervention to relieve the obstruction and restore the normal flow of urine. Defining the pertinent anatomy, the degree of obstruction, and differential renal function is key to determining whether and when intervention is necessary...|$|E
40|$|AbstractFraley's {{syndrome}} {{results from}} a rare anatomic variant of the renal vasculature leading to compression of the upper pole infundibulum, <b>caliectasis,</b> hematuria, and flank pain. To date {{there have been few}} reported cases in which this condition was treated using a minimally invasive approach. Here, we report a case in which a patient with Fraley's syndrome was successfully treated by performing a laparoscopic YV-infundibulo-pyeloplasty with vasculopexy of a posterior segmental renal artery. Minimally invasive collecting system reconstruction without vascular clamping is feasible, potentially less destructive and offers significant advantages in terms of intraoperative visualization and perioperative patient morbidity...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Purpose: To {{determine}} the renal arterial hemodynamic changes induced by obstructive uropathy using Doppler ultrasonography. Materials and Methods: 60 adult subjects with suspected obstructive uropathy and 60 asymptomatic apparently healthy controls with normal renal ultrasound features were evaluated. B-mode sonography of the kidneys and spectral Doppler {{examination of the}} renal interlobar arteries of all the participants were performed. The mean resistive indices (mRI) of both interlobar arteries were obtained and {{compared to that of}} the controls. The mRI of bilaterally obstructed kidneys were also compared with the mRI of unilaterally obstructed kidneys. Results: The mRI of the right and left kidneys of subjects were 0. 72 ± 0. 04 and 0. 69 ± 0. 06 while those of the controls were 0. 64 ± 0. 04 and 0. 63 ± 0. 03 respectively. The mRI for the grades of <b>caliectasis</b> increased from grade I (0. 72 ± 0. 03) to grade II (0. 73 ± 0. 03) and grade III (0. 73 ± 0. 02) but fell within the most severe levels of obstruction (0. 69 ± 0. 07). There was no statistically significant relationship between the grades of <b>caliectasis</b> and unilateral or bilateral obstruction for both kidneys. The results show a sensitivity and specificity of 86. 7 % and 90 % respectively when mRI≥ 0. 7 was used to determine presence of obstruction. Conclusion: Renal duplex sonography is highly sensitive and specific for diagnosis of obstructive uropathy. Increased resistive index of the obstructed kidney may be a useful diagnostic tool in situations where intravenous urography cannot be done or is contraindicated. </sec...|$|E
40|$|This article {{reviews the}} {{computed}} tomography and {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) features of renal tuberculosis (TB), including TB in transplant recipients and immunocompromised patients. Multi detector computed tomography (MDCT) forms the mainstay of cross-sectional imaging in renal TB. It can easily identify calcification, renal scars, mass lesions, and urothelial thickening. The combination of uneven <b>caliectasis,</b> with urothelial thickening and lack of pelvic dilatation, can also be demonstrated on MDCT. MRI is a sensitive modality for demonstration of features of renal TB, including tissue edema, asymmetric perinephric fat stranding, and thickening of Gerota′s fascia, all {{of which may be}} clues to focal pyelonephritis of tuberculous origin. Diffusion-weighted MR imaging with apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values may help in differentiating hydronephrosis from pyonephrosis. ADC values also have the potential to serve as a sensitive non-invasive biomarker of renal fibrosis. Immunocompromised patients are at increased risk of renal TB. In transplant patients, renal TB, including tuberculous interstitial nephritis, is an important cause of graft dysfunction. Renal TB in patients with HIV more often shows greater parenchymal affection, with poorly formed granulomas and relatively less frequent findings of caseation and stenosis. Atypical mycobacterial infections are also more common in immunocompromised patients...|$|E
40|$|Background : Idiopathic retroperitoneal {{fibrosis}} is an infrequent {{process of}} unknown aetiology characterised by fibrous tissue proliferation in the retroperitoneum. Even less frequent is a localized {{form of this}} disease by a proliferation of fibrous tissue around single or both kidneys. Case report : We describe a case of 46 -year old man in whom medical management was started for accidentally discovered arterial hypertension, {{which turned out to}} be difficult to control.    During diagnostic work-up of hypertension, an abdominal ultrasound was obtained a year later demonstrating slight bilateral <b>caliectasis</b> without obvious visible cause for it. Laboratory exams have shown significantly impaired renal function, normocytic anaemia, slightly higher sedimentation rate, increased CRP and normal urinalysis. Nephrologist has decided for hospitalisation during which magnetic resonance imaging was performed   showing a few mm wide tissue coats surrounding both kidneys with fluid lying between the coat and kidney capsule. A biopsy of perirenal mass has confirmed a dense cellular lesion consisted of interweaved fascicles of spindle-shaped cells. After exclusion of tumours and other causes, a diagnosis of retroperitoneal fibrosis was confirmed. Clinical picture and laboratory data corresponded to idiopathic form of this disease. A treatment with tamoxifen was started after patient refused treatment with methylprednisolone. During tamoxifen monotherapy, there was gradual significant improvement of general symptoms, notable decline in inflammation markers, improvement of anaemia, normalisation of kidney function, and normalisation of blood pressure. Conclusion : Retroperitoneal fibrosis is still an obscure and multifaceted disease. A proper selection of diagnostic methods is the key to correct and fast diagnosis as well as good grounding for proper treatment. </p...|$|E
40|$|Tuberculosis (TB) {{remains a}} {{worldwide}} scourge and its incidence {{appears to be}} increasing due to various factors, such as the spread of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The insidious onset and non-specific constitutional symptoms of genitourinary tuberculosis (GUTB) often lead to delayed diagnosis and rapid progression to a non-functioning kidney. Due to hematogenous dissemination of TB, {{there is a potential}} risk of involvement of the contralateral kidney too. Imaging {{plays an important role in}} the making of a timely diagnosis and in the planning of treatment, and thus helps to avoid complications such as renal failure. Imaging of GUTB still remains a challenge, mainly on account of the dearth of literature, especially related to the use of the newer modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This two-part article is a comprehensive review of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and imaging findings in renal TB. Various imaging features of GUTB are outlined, from the pathognomonic lobar calcification on plain film, to finer early changes such as loss of calyceal sharpness and papillary necrosis on intravenous urography (IVU); to uneven <b>caliectasis</b> and urothelial thickening, in the absence of renal pelvic dilatation, as well as the hitherto unreported ′lobar caseation′ on ultrasonography (USG). Well-known complications of GUTB such as sinus tracts, fistulae and amyloidosis are described, along with the relatively less well-known complications such as tuberculous interstitial nephritis (TIN), which may remain hidden because of its ′culture negative′ nature and thus lead to renal failure. The second part of the article reviews the computed tomography (CT) and MRI features of GUTB and touches upon future imaging techniques along with imaging of TB in transplant recipients and in immunocompromised patients...|$|E
40|$|Key words: renal pelvic dilatation, antenatal, {{postnatal}} outcome) Background Renal pelvic dilatation {{is one of}} the abnormalities detected antenatally by {{ultrasound scan}} (USS), incidence being around 0. 5 - 1 % of live births. In most children it is benign. Objectives To determine the local occurrence and outcomes of antenatally detected renal pelvic dilatation and to determine whether there is a sex difference in the incidence and outcomes Method The 18 - 20 weeks morphology scans of all live newborn babies delivered in the maternity ward of Hervey Bay hospital from 01 / 02 / 2008 to 30 / 09 / 2008 were retrospectively analysed. Infants with antenatally detected renal pelvic dilatation were followed up with 2 weeks postnatal USS. Infants with increasing pelvic dilatation or persistent moderate to severe dilatation were followed up with MCUG / MAG 3 scan. Results Total number of live births during the 8 month period was 695. There were 362 males and 333 females. There were 15 (2. 2 %) neonates (7 male, 8 female) with antenatally detected renal pelvic dilatation. Occurrence in males was 1. 9 % and females 2. 4 % (p = 0. 671). Five cases were bilateral and 10 unilateral. In unilateral cases, left side involvement was more common (60 %). In bilateral cases left side involvement was more severe in 60 %. There were 9 (60 %) cases with mild dilatation, 4 (27 %) with moderate dilatation and 2 (13 %) with severe dilatation. Oligohydramnios, thickened bladder or dilated ureters were not detected in any of the cases. <b>Caliectasis</b> was detected in 2 infants (13. 3 %) who had severe dilatation in antenatal scan. Subsequent postnatal scan was completely normal in 6 (40 %), improved in six (40 %) and worse in three (20 %). Ther...|$|E
40|$|Isolated {{involvement}} of the kidney is rare in hydatid disease and is even rarer in children. We present a case of primary right renal hydatid cyst in 6 -year-old female child who presented with pain right fl ank of 4 months duration. Th e patient was managed by nephrectomy. Key words: Hydatid cyst, kidney, nephrectomy nephrectomy was done, because cyst was involving almost whole of the kidney including hilum, sparing {{only a small portion}} of upper pole. Histopathological examination confi rmed the diagnosis. DISCUSSION Echinococcosis is a zoonotic disease and is present virtually worldwide. There are only few countries that are considered completely free of E. granulosus. [5] The liver is the most common site of echinococcal infestation (54 % to 77 %),[6] because the liver acts as the initial fi lter for the organisms. Those larvae that escape the liver are next fi ltered by the lungs (9 % to 30 %). The spleen, (0. 9 % to 8 %),[7] kidney (2 % to 3 %), and brain (1 %) are other organs involved. [6, 8] Renal hydatid cysts usually remain asymptomatic for many years. The patients usually present with vague pain in the lumbar region. Some may present with a mass palpable in the loin, and rarely some present with a history of passing whitish material also called as the “grape skin, ” the scolices, in the urine. [9] Pre-operative diagnosis of hydatid cysts can be made by ultrasound and confi rmed by a CT scan. Radiography may identify an occasional calcified cyst. Caliceal distortion is the predominant fi nding on IVP, followed by <b>caliectasis</b> and non-functioning kidney, possibly caused by the mass eff ect of cystic lesions. [10] CT scan is more accurate than a USG. [8] Hypointense rim and multicystic appearance is distinctive in magneti...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The duration, {{methods and}} {{frequency}} of radiographic follow-up after pediatric pyeloplasty is not well-defined. We prospectively evaluated a cohort of children undergoing pyeloplasty to determine the method for follow-up. Methods: Between 2000 and 2008, children undergoing pyeloplasty for unilateral ureteropelvic junction obstruction were evaluated for this study. All patients were evaluated preoperatively with protocol ultrasound (USG) and diuretic renal scan (RS). On the basis of preoperative split renal function (SRF), these patients were divided into four groups - Group I: SRF > 40 %, Group II: SRF 30 – 39 %, Group III: SRF 20 – 29 %, and Group IV: SRF 10 – 19 %. In follow-up, USG and RS were done at 3 months and repeated at 6 months, 1 year, and then yearly after surgery for a minimum period of 5 years. Improvement, stability, or worsening of hydronephrosis {{was based on the}} changes in anteroposterior (AP) diameter of pelvis and <b>caliectasis</b> on USG. Absolute increase in split renal function (SRF) > 5 % was considered significant. Failure was defined as increase in AP diameter of pelvis and decrease in cortical thickness on 3 consecutive USG, t½ > 20 min with obstructive drainage on RS and/or symptomatic patient. Results: 145 children were included in the study. Their mean age was 3. 26 years and mean follow-up was 7. 5 years. Pre- and post-operative SRF remain unchanged within 5 % range in 35 of 41 patients (85 %) in Group I. While 9 of 20 patients (45 %) in Group II, 23 of 50 patients (46 %) in Group III, and 14 of 34 patients (41 %) in Group IV exhibited changes > 5 % after surgery. 5 patients failed, 2 in Group III, and 3 in Group IV. None of the patients deteriorated in Group I and II. Conclusion: After pyeloplasty in children with a baseline split GFR > 30 %, if a diuretic renogram and USG performed 3 months postoperatively shows nonobstructive drainage with t½ < 20 min and decreased hydronephrosis, no further follow-up is required...|$|E

Materials and Methods : Hospital and follow-up records of 11 patients with hydatid cyst of the urinary tract were reviewed and {{data on the}} patients’ symptoms and signs at presentation, radiological findings, diagnostic tests, pathologic findings, and surgical outcomes were reviewed. Results : The chief complaint was flank pain in 7 patients (63. 6 %). Hydaturia was not seen in any of our patients. Ten patients had renal involvement and 1 had a retrovesical hydatid cyst. Eosinophilia was detected in 2 of 11 patients who were tested. A positive indirect hemagglutination test was seen in 4 of 7 patients and a positive Casoni test in 1 of 2. Intravenous urography revealed caliceal distortion in 6 patients (54. 5 %), <b>caliectasis</b> in 3 (27. 3 %), and nonfunctioning kidney in 2 (18. 2 %). Ultrasonography showed a complex cyst {{in all of the}} patients. Computed tomography demonstrated multivesicular cystic structure in 4 patients (36. 4 %), complex cyst in 4 (36. 4 %), and a simple cyst in 3 (27. 3 %). Definite diagnosis was made only after surgical operation. We performed nephrectomy in 2 patients (18. 2 %), partial nephrectomy in 2 (18. 2 %), cystectomy plus marsupialization in 5 (45. 4 %), and retrovesical surgery in 1 (9. 1 %). One patient refused surgical treatment. There was no perioperative major complication. Conclusion : Renal hydatidosis is a rare entity and the main challenge is preoperative diagnosis. Radiological and serologic studies, although indicative, cannot confirm the diagnosis, and only pathologic examination after surgical removal can confirm echinococcal infection. </spa...|$|E
