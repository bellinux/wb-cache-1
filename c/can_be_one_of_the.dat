During this research, this shark was consistently detected at all depths from bottom to near surface whereas it was the substrate during the day. It also found that as Norfolk Bay does not have adequate shelter cover, this species may use group formation to avoid predation.|$|E
25|$|Education is a {{critical}} input in human resource development and essential for the country's economic growth. It increases the productivity and efficiency of individuals, and it produces a skilled labor force {{that is capable of}} leading the economy towards sustainable growth and prosperity. The progress and wellbeing of a country largely depends on the education choices made available to its people. It <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most powerful instruments of change. It can help a country to achieve its national goals via producing minds imbued with knowledge, skills, and competencies to shape its future destiny. The widespread recognition of this fact has created awareness on the need to focus upon literacy and elementary education, not simply as a matter of social justice but more to foster economic growth, social well-being, and social stability. Women's education is so inextricably linked with the other facets of human development that to make it a priority is to also make change on a range of other fronts; from the health and status of women to early childhood care; from nutrition, water and sanitation to community empowerment; from the reduction of child labor and other forms of exploitation to the peaceful resolution of conflicts.|$|E
500|$|Richard Chapman and Eric Clapton {{describe}} de Lucía as a [...] "titanic {{figure in}} the world of flamenco guitar", highlighting his [...] "astounding technique and inventiveness" [...] and his broad range of musical ideas from other styles, such as Brazilian music and jazz. He is noted for his innovation and colour in harmony and his remarkable dexterity, technique, strength and fluidity in his right hand, capable of executing extremely fast and fluent picados. A master of contrast, he often juxtaposes picados with rasgueados and other techniques and often adds abstract chords and scale tones to his compositions with jazz influences. Bill Milkowski of Down Beat described him as [...] "the portrait of studied concentration and pristine perfection: stiff backed and stern faced, with a distinguished air about him that some might misread as haughtiness. He's proud and majestic, like a regal Arabian steed prancing with grace and elegance, yet able to reveal great power." [...] Craig Harris of AllMusic noted his [...] "deeply personal melodic statements and modern instrumentation." [...] Atlanta magazine said, [...] "The guitar, when used properly, <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most haunting and beautiful instruments to create sound... when he brushes his fingers across the strings, [...] can create some of the most incredible music. It's almost like a lullaby." [...] José Luis Acosta, president of the Spanish Artists and Editors Society stated that [...] "Paco was and will be a universal artist, who took the guitar and flamenco sentiment {{to the heart of the}} whole world." [...] In 2015, Billboard magazine named de Lucía as one of The 30 Most Influential Latin Artists of All Time, an editor writes: [...] "The virtuoso intrumentalist popularized flamenco worldwide, and brought the Spanish sound to the forefront of avant-garde jazz.". In the same year, he was posthumously inducted into the Latin Songwriters Hall of Fame for his contributions to flamenco music. On December 21, 2016, Google commemorated the anniversary of de Lucia's birth with a Google Doodle shown in Spain, Mexico, and several South American nations.|$|E

During this time, the students are instructed in the basic sciences (e.g. physics, chemistry, biology, anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, etc.) and must pass a federal medical exam (...) , administered nationally. Upon completion, the students advance to the clinical stage, where they receive three years of training and education in the clinical subjects (e.g., internal medicine, surgery, obstetrics and gynecology, pediatrics, pharmacology, pathology, etc.).

[...] The first symptom is often a weak cry or a hoarse voice due to a thickening of the vocal cords. [...] The hoarse voice <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most striking clinical manifestations of the disease. Lesions and scars also appear on the skin, usually the face and the distal parts of the limbs. This is often the result of poor wound healing and the scarring continues to increase as the patient ages, leaving the skin with a waxy appearance. [...] Skin may be easily damaged {{as a result of}} only a minor trauma or injury, leaving many blisters and additional scars. The skin is also usually very dry and wrinkly. [...] White or yellow infiltrates form on the lips, buccal mucosa, tonsils, uvula, epiglottis and frenulum of the tongue. This can lead to upper respiratory tract infection and sometimes requires tracheostomy to relieve the symptom. Too much thickening of the frenulum can restrict tongue movement and may result in speech impediments. Beading of the papules around the eyelids is a very common symptom and is often used as part of a diagnosis of the disease.
