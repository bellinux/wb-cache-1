5|$|A final {{reason for}} the Second Settlement was to give the Principate {{constitutional}} stability and staying power in <b>case</b> <b>something</b> happened to Princeps Augustus. His illness of early 23 BC and the Caepio conspiracy showed that the regime's existence hung by the thin thread {{of the life of}} one man, Augustus himself, who suffered from several severe and dangerous illnesses throughout his life. If he were to die from natural causes or fall victim to assassination, Rome could be subjected to another round of civil war. The memories of Pharsalus, the Ides of March, the proscriptions, Philippi, and Actium, barely twenty-five years distant, were still vivid {{in the minds of many}} citizens. Proconsular imperium was conferred upon Agrippa for five years, similar to Augustus' power, in order to accomplish this constitutional stability. The exact nature of the grant is uncertain but it probably covered Augustus' imperial provinces, east and west, perhaps lacking authority over the provinces of the Senate. That came later, as did the jealously guarded tribunicia potestas.|$|E

They did the Hellboy movies and I just loved it." [...] Wirkola added: [...] "I come from Norway where we can’t afford CGI.

The Ghostbusters, now {{official}} city contractors, are training a new recruit, whom Dr. Venkman insists they simply call [...] "Rookie" [...] so they don't get too attached in <b>case</b> <b>something</b> should happen to the new hire while testing out experimental equipment. A large PKE shockwave then hits New York City and sends the team on a variety of calls to capture ghosts that result from it, including Stay Puft Marshmallow Man. Throughout these calls, they are hounded by Walter Peck, now head of the Paranormal Contracts Oversight Commission (PCOC, pronounced [...] "peacock") as appointed by Mayor Jock Mulligan, who warns them about causing too much damage in their ghost capturing activities. The Ghostbusters discover through a series of adventures and encounters with museum curator Dr. Ilyssa Selwyn (Alyssa Milano) that Ivo Shandor, the architect who designed the building at 55 Central Park West that was once used to summon Gozer, had also designed a network of tunnels to channel ectoplasmic slime through the city that was used by Vigo the Carpathian. The Ghostbusters also realize that Shandor placed personally-renovated buildings above the tunnels to act as nodes on a mandala to merge the real world with the Ghost World and bring forth another Great Destructor like Gozer. The Ghostbusters help to destroy the nodes and capture the node guardians at the Sedgewick Hotel, the New York Public Library, and the Museum of Natural History, which was hosting a Gozer exhibit with artifacts donated by Shandor's estate. At the last node {{in the middle of the}} Hudson River they discover a mansion on an island rising from the water. As they explore it, they find that the island belonged to Shandor and that Ilyssa is his descendant. They also discover machines pumping the slime into the tunnel network and disable them as well as the final Mandala node, and escape the island just before it sinks back into the water.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Every {{surgical}} item {{used during}} surgery (e. g., sponges) must {{be accounted for}} after surgery to ensure {{that none of these}} items is left inside the patient. Despite the numerous precautions in place, in approximately 1 in 1500 <b>cases,</b> <b>something</b> gets left behind inside the patient’s body. This paper presents ASSIST, an automated system for surgical instrument and sponge tracking that increases the safety of surgical procedures. ASSIST utilizes RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) technology to aid in accounting for all items used during surgery. The design takes into account safety, simplicity, ease of deployment, and ease of use. An initial evaluation utilizing RFID-tagged sponges demonstrates that ASSIST can reliably track surgical sponges with minimal impact to current operating room procedures. Sources of error that can impact the reliability of the system are also discussed. I...|$|R
