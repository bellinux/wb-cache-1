5|$|According to setup {{coordinator}} Douglas <b>Cook,</b> <b>the</b> rehearsals {{enabled them}} to reduce the setup time to under five minutes. Cook, who had worked on previous halftime shows, understood the details and guided the team. Drawings of the performances depicted what was expected for each setup, with the volunteers assembling the stage in segments and moving them to the field with carts. Madonna's entrance had to be rehearsed several times for coordination. Although Cook learned during the game that the New England Patriots were scheduled to exit on the route used by volunteers carrying the stage equipment, he resolved the issue by talking with the team.|$|E
5|$|In {{commemoration}} of Pancake Day in the United Kingdom, a novelty pancake machine {{was built by}} The Happy Egg Company in February 2013 that involved a complex series of steps to automatically produce pancakes from scratch. The machine {{involves the use of}} a freshly laid egg from a hen that rolls onto a turntable, which then moves the egg to an area where it is automatically cracked and mixed with other ingredients. After this point, the mixture is poured into a griddle, flipped to <b>cook</b> <b>the</b> other side, and then flipped onto a plate.|$|E

5|$|After a posting to Amberley, Queensland, Cresswell {{served on}} the {{directing}} staff {{of the first two}} courses held at the newly formed RAAF Staff College, Point <b>Cook.</b> <b>The</b> college was the successor organisation to the wartime RAAF Staff School, and commenced its first six-month course on 13June 1949. Cresswell had by this time reverted to the rank of squadron leader, as the air force and its wartime officer corps shrank dramatically following demobilisation. On 10July 1950, he was appointed commanding officer of No.21 (City of Melbourne) Squadron, a Citizen Air Force unit based at Laverton and equipped with Mustangs crewed by reserve pilots. Cresswell was unimpressed by what he saw as the casual attitude displayed by his part-time pilots and soon had them practising appropriate fighter tactics.|$|E
5|$|Crewmen aboard São Paulo rebelled on 4 November 1924, when First Lieutenant Hercolino Cascardo, seven second lieutenants and 260 others commandeered the ship. After the boilers were fired, São Paulos mutineers {{attempted}} to entice the crews of Minas Geraes {{and the other}} ships nearby to join. They were only able to sway the crew of one old torpedo boat to the cause. The battleship's crew, angry that Minas Geraes would not join them, fired a six-pounder at Minas Geraes that wounded a <b>cook.</b> <b>The</b> mutineers then sailed out of the Rio de Janeiro's harbor, where the forts at Santa Cruz and Copacabana engaged her, damaging São Paulos fire control system and funnel. The forts stopped firing soon after the battleship returned fire due to concern over possible civilian casualties. The crewmen aboard São Paulo {{attempted to}} join revolutionaries in Rio Grande do Sul, but when {{they found that the}} rebel forces had moved inland, they set course for Montevideo, Uruguay. They arrived on 10 November, where the rebellious members of the crew disembarked and were granted asylum, and Minas Geraes, which had been pursuing São Paulo, escorted the wayward ship home to Rio de Janeiro, arriving on the 21st.|$|E

5|$|Gumball is a 1983 {{video game}} by Robert Cook and Broderbund {{in which the}} player {{controls}} the valves of a maze-like machine to sort gumballs by their color. The player meets the quota of each level to earn their character—a factory worker—a promotion, resulting in a raise in difficulty with more color choices and defective gumballs to exclude. Broderbund co-founder Doug Carlston conceived of the game's machine-sorting concept, and <b>Cook,</b> <b>the</b> designer, added the gumball conceit and built the core gameplay within a week. He later returned to add sound, decorative features, and a secret image that was only found three decades after the game's release. Gumball debuted at the June 1983 Consumer Electronics Show and released for the Apple II, Atari 8-bit family, and Commodore 64. Reviewers separately noted {{the difficulty of the}} game's later stages, praised its comical elements, and commented on the social role of simulating mundane work. The game did not become popular and its copies became rare.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, Wolf Klaphake and {{his wife}} Maria emigrated to Australia. The Klaphakes' {{decision}} to emigrate was probably primarily the result of Maria's encounters with Nazi authorities; their decision to settle in Australia (rather than, say, in Britain) was influenced by Wolf's desire to develop a dew condenser. As a dry continent, Australia was likely to need alternative sources of fresh water, and the Premier of South Australia, whom he had met in London, had expressed an interest. Klaphake made a specific proposal for a condenser at {{the small town of}} Cook, where there was no supply of potable water. At <b>Cook,</b> <b>the</b> railway company had previously installed a large coal-powered active condenser, but it was prohibitively expensive to run, and it was cheaper to simply transport water. However, the Australian government turned down Klaphake's proposal, and he lost interest in the project.|$|E
5|$|On 15 May 1942 {{a special}} {{supplement}} to the London Gazette carried the announcement of 19 decorations; Frost was awarded the Military Cross (MC), <b>Cook</b> <b>the</b> Distinguished Service Cross (DSC) and Cox the Military Medal (MM); there were two other DSCs, two Distinguished Service Medals (DSM), one other MC, two further MMs and nine Mentions in Despatches (MiD). Wing Commander Pickard was also subsequently awarded a bar to his Distinguished Service Order, on 26 May. The success of the raid also prompted the War Office to expand the existing British airborne forces, setting up the Airborne Forces Depot and Battle School in Derbyshire in April 1942, and creating the Parachute Regiment as well as converting a number of infantry battalions to airborne battalions in August 1942.|$|E

5|$|Testaroli {{is a type}} of pancake-like pasta {{prepared}} using water, {{wheat flour}} and salt that is sliced into triangular shapes. Chestnut flour is sometimes used in its preparation. The ingredients are mixed together and prepared as a batter, after which it is cooked, sometimes using a two-stage cooking process. In the typical first stage, and sometimes only stage of cooking, the batter is poured and cooked on a hot, flat surface in the style of a pancake or crêpe. In this process, testaroli is traditionally cooked on a testo, which may be prepared for use by being heated over hot coals. A skillet is another cooking device {{that can be used to}} <b>cook</b> <b>the</b> batter. The pasta is then sliced into triangles, and is sometimes directly served after this cooking process. In the second cooking stage that is sometimes performed, the pasta may be set aside to cool, and then cooked further in boiling water.|$|E

5|$|The islands were officially the Kingdom of Hawaii but had {{generally}} {{been known as}} the Sandwich Islands since the 1778 visit of Captain James <b>Cook.</b> <b>The</b> estimated population of Native Hawaiians when Cook arrived was 800,000. With the arrival of whaling ships and missionaries in the early 19th century, the Native Hawaiians were exposed to diseases for which they had no immunity and began dying in large numbers. The official 1878 census showed only 44,088 individuals who claimed Hawaiian ethnicity. The sugar plantation work force in the islands and the dwindling population of the Hawaiian race had been Kalākaua's ongoing concerns. On December 24, 1880, he signed an act of the legislative assembly acknowledging corruption in the immigration system and authorizing Minister of the Interior Henry A. P. Carter {{to take charge of}} licensing immigration brokers.|$|E

5|$|The {{school was}} re-established in 1946 as No.1 FTS at RAAF Station Uranquinty, New South Wales, and {{transferred}} to Point <b>Cook</b> <b>the</b> following year. Under a restructure of flying training {{to cope with the}} demands of the Korean War and Malayan Emergency, No.1 FTS was re-formed in 1952 as No.1 Applied Flying Training School (No.1 AFTS); it moved to RAAF Base Pearce, Western Australia, in 1958. For much of this period the school was also responsible for training the RAAF's air traffic controllers. Its pilot trainees included Army, Navy, and foreign students as well as Air Force personnel. The RAAF's reorganisation of aircrew training in the early 1950s had led to the formation at Uranquinty of No.1 Basic Flying Training School (No.1 BFTS), which transferred to Point Cook in 1958. In 1969, No.1 AFTS was re-formed as No.2 Flying Training School and No.1 BFTS was re-formed as No.1 FTS. Rationalisation of RAAF flying training resulted in the disbandment of No.1 FTS in 1993.|$|E
5|$|Vanaja (Mamatha Bhukya) is the 15-year-old {{daughter}} of Somayya (Ramachandriah Marikanti), a poor, low caste fisherman from rural Andhra Pradesh. Somayya struggles {{to support his}} family due to dwindling catches at sea and mounting debts. One day, Vanaja and her teenage friend Lacchi (Bhavani Renukunta) watch a theatrical performance by a former Kuchipudi (a native classical Indian dance form) great, Rama Devi (Urmila Dammannagari). The sequence of events lead to a soothsayer predicting to Vanaja {{that she will be}} a great dancer. With permission from her father, she goes to work in the house of the local landlady Rama Devi with the hope of learning Kuchipudi. While she is employed as a farmhand, she is entrusted with tending the chickens. When she gets caught playfully chasing them, she lies to conceal her pranks. Her vivaciousness and spunk soon catch the landlady’s eye. To keep her out of trouble, Rama Devi soon promotes her to a kitchen underhand where she meets Rama Devi’s <b>cook,</b> <b>the</b> old, crusty and extremely loyal Radhamma (Krishnamma Gundimalla).|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} it was re-formed as No.1 AFTS, the flying school at Point Cook had also been made {{responsible}} for training the RAAF's air traffic controllers; this role was transferred to Central Flying School at East Sale in December 1956. Southern Area Command was re-formed as Training Command in September 1953. On 28May 1958, No.1 AFTS relocated to RAAF Base Pearce, Western Australia, where its Wirraways were replaced by deHavilland Vampire jet trainers, which required a runway longer than that at Point <b>Cook.</b> <b>The</b> school's place at Point Cook was taken by No.1 BFTS, which transferred from Uranquinty on 19December. By this time the RAAF had decided to commission all pilots and navigators, who would be selected for these roles upon induction into the service; navigators therefore went straight to the School of Air Navigation at East Sale, without attending flying training school. On 31December 1958, the Flying Training Squadron of RAAF College was disbanded, and the flight instruction component of the four-year cadet course became the responsibility of No.1 BFTS (for basic training) and No.1 AFTS (for advanced training). Previously, the cadets had used FTS aircraft under RAAF College instructors, but from 1959 their flight training was fully integrated with the FTS system.|$|E
