50|$|Not {{all school}} systems {{constitute}} school districts as distinct bodies corporate. In most Southern states, school systems operate either as {{an arm of}} county government, or at least share <b>coextensive</b> boundaries <b>with</b> the state's counties. In Maryland, most school systems are run at the county level, but the Baltimore City system operates separately, at a county-equivalent level. Other states, such as New York, have both independent school districts and school systems that are subordinate to cities. The Hawaii State Department of Education functions as a single statewide school district. This is unique among the states, but the District of Columbia Public Schools operates district public schools in Washington, DC and the Puerto Rico Department of Education operates all {{public schools in the}} Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, thus they also function as single school districts.|$|R

2500|$|The {{presence}} of incorporated boroughs in Connecticut and incorporated villages in Vermont has influenced {{the evolution of}} cities in those states. In Connecticut in particular, {{the historical development of}} cities was quite different from in the other New England states, and at least technically, the relationship between towns and cities is even today different from elsewhere in New England. Just as boroughs in Connecticut overlay towns, so do cities; for example, while Hartford is commonly thought of as a city, it is <b>coextensive</b> and consolidated <b>with</b> the Town of Hartford; governed by a single governmental entity with the powers and responsibilities of the Town being carried out by the entity referred to as the City of Hartford. [...] In legal theory though not in current practice Connecticut cities and boroughs could be coextensive (covering the same geography as the town) without being consolidated (a single government); also a borough or city can span more than one town. In practice, though, most cities in Connecticut today do not function any differently from their counterparts elsewhere in New England. See the section below on boroughs and villages for more background on this topic.|$|R

25|$|Connecticut {{is one of}} two New England {{states to}} have any type of {{incorporated}} general-purpose municipality below the town level, namely incorporated boroughs (Vermont has incorporated villages). There are nine remaining in the state. They were once more numerous. Many of those that remain are very small. Connecticut also has at least one remaining city (Groton) that is within, but not <b>coextensive</b> <b>with,</b> its parent town. A second non-coextensive city, Winsted, still exists on paper, but its government has been consolidated with that of the town of Winchester for many years, making it more of a special-purpose district than a true municipality. Winsted is no longer recognized by the Census Bureau as an incorporated place, although data is tabulated for a Census Designated Place that is <b>coextensive</b> <b>with</b> that of the original city.|$|E
40|$|AbstractOcular {{following}} responses (OFRs) are {{the initial}} tracking eye movements {{that can be}} elicited at ultra-short latency by sudden motion of a textured pattern. A recent study used motion stimuli consisting of two large <b>coextensive</b> sine-wave gratings <b>with</b> the same orientation but different spatial frequency and moving in ¼-wavelength steps in the same or opposite directions: when the two gratings differed in contrast by more than about an octave then {{the one with the}} higher contrast completely dominated the OFR and the one with lower contrast lost its influence as though suppressed [Sheliga, B. M., Kodaka, Y., FitzGibbon, E. J., & Miles, F. A. (2006). Human ocular following initiated by competing image motions: Evidence for a winner-take-all mechanism. Vision Research, 46, 2041 – 2060]. This winner-take-all (WTA) outcome was attributed to nonlinear interactions in the form of mutual inhibition between the mechanisms sensing the competing motions. In the present study, we recorded the initial horizontal OFRs to the horizontal motion of two vertical sine-wave gratings that differed in spatial frequency and were each confined to horizontal strips that extended the full width of our display (45 °) but were only 1 – 2 ° high. The two gratings could be coextensive or separated by a vertical gap of up to 8 °, and each underwent motion consisting of successive ¼-wavelength steps. Initial OFRs showed strong dependence on the relative contrasts of the competing gratings and when these were coextensive this dependence was always highly nonlinear (WTA), regardless of whether the two gratings moved in the same or opposite direction. When the two gratings moved in opposite directions the nonlinear interactions were purely local: with a vertical gap of 1 ° or more between the gratings OFRs approximated the linear sum of the responses to each grating alone. On the other hand, when the two gratings moved in the same direction the nonlinear interactions were more global: even with a gap of 8 °—the largest separation tried—OFRs were still substantially less than predicted by the linear sum. When the motions were in the same direction, we postulate two nonlinear interactions: local mutual inhibition (resulting in WTA) and global divisive inhibition (resulting in normalization). Motion stimuli whose responses were totally suppressed by coextensive opponent motion of higher contrast were rendered invisible to normalization, suggesting that the local interactions responsible for the WTA behavior here occur at an earlier stage of neural processing than the global interactions responsible for normalization...|$|R

25|$|It is {{possible}} for a Connecticut borough or Vermont village to become a city. In Connecticut, cities overlay towns just as boroughs do, and, just like a borough, a city can cover {{only a portion of}} a town rather than being <b>coextensive</b> <b>with</b> the town. This is rare today—only one or two examples remain—but it was more common in the past. At least one borough historically spanned more than one town: the borough of Danielsonville originally laid over parts of Killingly and Brooklyn, until the Brooklyn portion petitioned to be reorganized as a fire district and concurrently the Killingly portion was renamed Danielson by the General Assembly. There are no legal restrictions in Connecticut that would prevent a city or borough today from similarly overlaying the territory of more than one town, provided it is not consolidated with one of the underlying towns. Cities actually developed earlier in Connecticut than in the other New England states, and were originally based on the borough concept. At one time, all cities were non-coextensive; the practice of making cities <b>coextensive</b> <b>with</b> their towns was a later adaptation intended to mimic the city concept that had emerged in the other New England states. Over time, many non-coextensive cities have expanded to become <b>coextensive</b> <b>with</b> their parent town. As with boroughs, many have also disincorporated and reverted to full town control. These two trends have combined to make non-coextensive cities very rare in recent times.|$|E

25|$|In Borealis Planitia, however, most of {{the ridges}} are of {{external}} origin. They appear either to outline the rim crests of subjacent ghost craters that are lightly mantled by smooth plains material or to be lava flow fronts. The map shows the rim crests of 20 ghost craters, ranging in diameter from 40 to 160 km, that are buried under the smooth plains material of Borealis Planitia, which material is <b>coextensive</b> <b>with</b> the fill covering {{the floor of the}} Goethe Basin. In addition, ejecta from the crater Depréz extend more than 40 km eastward beyond a circular scarp that may represent the rim crest of a buried crater 170 km in diameter (FDS 156, 160) or, more likely, the front of lava flows. The size and density of these ghost craters suggest that, prior to emplacement of smooth plains material, the original heavily cratered surface of Borealis Planitia—which may have been the cratered floor of a very large multiring impact basin—and the cratered floor of the Goethe Basin were similar in composition and age to the intercrater plains material of the highlands to the west. Many scarps in Borealis Planitia are subconcentric to the rim of the Goethe Basin and have steeper slopes that face away from it, suggesting that they represent the fronts of lava flows that resurfaced extensive areas of heavily cratered terrain (intercrater or older plains material).|$|E
25|$|The {{administration}} the self-declared Republic of Somaliland {{claims that}} 35 countries diplomatically recognised a State of Somaliland during the five-day period of independence between 26 June and 1 July 1960, including all five {{permanent members of}} the United Nations Security Council (the Republic of China, the French Republic, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the United States of America). The Northern Somali Unionist Movement, a unionist group hailing from the northwestern region of Somalia <b>coextensive</b> <b>with</b> the former British Somaliland protectorate, disputes this claim; it asserts that no such records exist and that these nations instead only diplomatically recognized the Somali Republic (Somalia) as a whole. Additionally, the US Department of State indicates in its Document 62 that the United States did not extend formal recognition to a state of Somaliland in 1960, as the enclave's brief independence from Britain was intended to allow it to unite with the Trust Territory of Somaliland a few days later. Secretary of State Christian Herter instead sent a congratulatory message to the Somaliland Council of Ministers on June 26, 1960. Upon union of the two Somalilands, the United States recognized the Somali Republic on July 1, 1960, in a congratulatory message from US President Dwight D. Eisenhower to President of Somalia Aden Abdullah Osman Daar. In 2007, the Government of China issued an affidavit on behalf of the Somali Republic at the International Court of Justice, which similarly indicates that the international community recognized the Somali Republic when it was accepted into the United Nations on September 20, 1960. The Chinese government therein also notes that the sole purpose of gaining independence from Britain was to unite the former British Somaliland and Italian Somaliland territories.|$|E
