5|$|The temple site {{remained}} {{a place of}} pilgrimage in the classical antiquity during the early Roman Empire and until the advent of Christianity, when the cult of Eshmun was banned and a Christian church was built at the temple site across the Roman street from the podium.

5|$|The cost of {{construction}} of the <b>church</b> <b>can</b> be inflated to contemporary values using changes in the British Gross Domestic Product (GDP). This measures the social cost {{of construction}} or investment {{as a proportion of}} the economy's total output of goods and services. This allows consideration of the equivalent social impact in current terms: how much contemporary Britons would need to forgo in order to invest a similar amount of the current British economy. As of 2012, the figures are updated using data from 2010, the latest year for which data is available.|$|E

5|$|A {{new site}} for the cathedral was {{selected}} above Caine Road by the Glenealy Ravine and {{the cornerstone of the}} new church was laid on 8 December 1883. Crawley and Company of London were hired to be the architects and five years later, construction was completed. The church opened on 7 December 1888, the vigil of the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, and was blessed one day later. The construction of the cathedral cost US$15,400, and since a Catholic <b>church</b> <b>can</b> only be consecrated once it has become free from debt, the cathedral did not have its rite of consecration held until 8 December 1938, exactly fifty years after it first opened. The ceremony was officiated by the Vicar Apostolic of Hong Kong Enrico Valtorta, the Bishop of Macau José da Costa Nunes and the Bishop Emeritus of Canton; three of the cathedral's altars were also consecrated.|$|E
5|$|If {{the church}} from the {{marginal}} note is equated with the Round Church, {{then it can}} be conclusively dated {{to no more than}} a few years before 907. While the <b>church</b> <b>can</b> be ascribed to no later than the 10th century, some scholars have suggested that it may have been constructed directly on top of a much earlier late Roman basilica due to its antiquated plan. A possible donor (ktetor) of at least part of the church's construction is a high-ranking church official (chartophylax) named Paul, who is mentioned in an inscription inside the church. The main part of the work was likely funded by Simeon, who may have acted as a chief sponsor.|$|E

5|$|The aim of Calvin's {{political}} theory was {{to safeguard the}} rights and freedoms of ordinary people. Although {{he was convinced that}} the Bible contained no blueprint for a certain form of government, Calvin favored a combination of democracy and aristocracy (mixed government). He appreciated the advantages of democracy. To further minimize the misuse of political power, Calvin proposed to divide it among several political institutions like the aristocracy, lower estates, or magistrates in a system of checks and balances (separation of powers). Finally, Calvin taught that if rulers rise up against God they lose their divine right and must be deposed. State and church are separate, though they have to cooperate to the benefit of the people. Christian magistrates {{have to make sure that}} the <b>church</b> <b>can</b> fulfill its duties in freedom. In extreme cases the magistrates have to expel or execute dangerous heretics. But nobody can be forced to become a Protestant.|$|E
5|$|There was major {{restoration}} {{work done}} to the church in 1886, and {{a large amount of}} the Chancel woodwork dates from this period. During the restoration the east window was also replaced; it now depicts the stylised form of Saint Oswald, flanked on either side by Saint Aidan, and Saint Cuthbert, both Christian saints of the same era, and who helped him in missionary work in the Kingdom of Northumbria. These windows are directly opposite the western window, above the font {{at the other end of}} the church, which depicts the queen at the time, Queen Victoria. Further modern additions to the <b>church</b> <b>can</b> be seen in the bell turret and organ chamber, as well as the south porch, which is currently the sole congregational entrance to the church. The church uses an electric organ during services.|$|E

25|$|In {{contrast}} to the high-church party, evangelicals emphasize experiential religion of the heart over the importance of liturgical forms. As a result, evangelicals are often described as being low church, but these terms are not always interchangeable because low <b>church</b> <b>can</b> also describe individuals or groups that are not evangelical.|$|E
25|$|During the Norman period, {{important}} towns {{existed at}} Bannow and Clonmines. However, these declined in importance over time. The Norman town of Bannow (erroneously thought {{by some to}} have been reclaimed by the sea) was gradually abandoned due to the silting up of Bannow Bay and an early Norman <b>Church</b> <b>can</b> still be seen there today.|$|E

25|$|Congregationalism is {{more easily}} {{identified}} as a movement than a single denomination, given its distinguishing commitment to the complete autonomy of the local congregation. The idea that each distinct congregation fully constitutes the visible Body of the <b>church</b> <b>can,</b> however, be traced to John Wycliffe and the Lollard movement, which followed Wycliffe's removal from teaching authority in the Roman Catholic Church.|$|E
