Cultivated pineapple still has several traits of this parentage: - its root system is extremely fragile and the plant prefers light, well-tilled soil; - it tolerates very dry spells by strongly reducing growth but still surviving; - the base of the leaves is the most efficient zone for uptake of nutrients and it responds well to foliar fertilisation; - flowering is induced by low temperatures and short days and is erratic under natural conditions.

Accordingly, the question remained to the attachment of the troupe de Marine, which only now served in the colonies. The troops were finally attached in 1900 (by the decreed law of July 7, 1900) to the Département de la Guerre and were designated then as Troupes coloniales. The latter were composed of two distinct units: one armed colonial force in metro pole, composed of Europeans and professionalized singularities, who would detach by small contingents as per the colonial tour deployment of the military personnel to the respective colonies, where they were utilized either in « blanches » units ( [...] the tendency was to reduce progressively the number of these units [...] ), either for the training induction of indigenous troops recruited on the spot (tirailleurs, cipayes...). One of the great challenges of times that faced this system was the traditional withholding of military competences to conduct a classic European war ( [...] in terms of an armed constituted corps, while also doubling to the mobilization of the 1st and 2nd colonial corps [...] ) and, in contrast, to adapt to the very specific conditions of colonial <b>cultural</b> <b>operations,</b> which varied significantly from one colony to another colony. Accordingly, and perhaps the cause of leading to a state of « schizophrénie » among the colonial armed force. The two types of colonial troupes however, participated to World War I, World War II, as well as the Indochina War and the Algerian War.|$|E
40|$|<b>Cultural</b> <b>operations</b> in {{agriculture}} have well established history about {{their role in}} insect pest population management. Various cultural practices directly or indirectly are known {{to contribute to the}} insect pest control. There have been several case studies documenting their positive role as pest reducers, however quantification of their indirect effects though significant, are difficult to substantiate. Global dependence on chemical control in the past two-three decades bas contributed to the reduction of hunger to some extent, though the continuous dependence created several problems to natural resources. The awareness of the deleterious effects of chemicals led to the thinking about alternatives to chemicals.

40|$|This report {{reviews the}} current state of {{mechanization}} of operations, from establishment through harvesting and transportation, for short-rotation hardwood plantations. Given that essentially all of the high production plantations in the U. S. are intended for pulp production, with residues for energy as a secondary product, the report focuses mainly on approaches for producing trees greater than 3 inches DBH (diameter at breast height), although technologies for smaller trees intended solely for energy are also reviewed. Possibilities for improvement are also discussed. Planting of more widely-spaced plantations for pulp is generally still done by hand. For closerspaced energy plantations, mechanical planters are used. Agricultural seedling transplanters have been successful, and machines intended specifically for planting hardwood cuttings have recently been developed in Scandinavia. <b>Cultural</b> <b>operations</b> [...] fertilization, weed control and pest control [...] are carried out with traditional agricultural equipment, ranging from backpack sprayers to small all-terrain vehicles, agricultural tractors and implements, to aircraft.

This essay is framed around the notion of people as infrastructure, which emphasizes economic collaboration among residents seemingly marginalized from and immiserated by urban life. Infrastructure is commonly understood in physical terms, as reticulated systems of highways, pipes, wires, or cables. These modes of provisioning and articulation are viewed as making the city productive, reproducing it, and positioning its residents, territories, and resources in specific ensembles where the energies of individuals can be most efficiently deployed and accounted for...|$|R

40|$|In {{the years}} {{between the end of}} the XVIth century and the {{beginning}} of the XVIIth, a period rich with intellectual changes and challenges in India, two grammars of Sanskrit of a new genre were composed, namely Bhaṭṭoji Dīkṣita’s Siddhāntakaumudī (SK) and Nārāyaṇa Bhaṭṭa’s Prakriyāsarvasva (PS). Both these grammars consciously aimed at a kind of re-foundation of India’s most ancient grammatical tradition, deriving from the seminal opus of Pāṇini (IVth BC). The authors had at least one great model in common, Rāma-chandra’s (XVth century) Prakriyākaumudī (PK) which first attempted an almost exhaustive rearrangement of pāṇinian rules. Unlike previous attempts to ‘sim- plify’ Pāṇini’s Aṣṭādhyāyī (A), these new grammars were characterised by a stricter adherence to the actual phrasing of pāṇinian rules; hence the core of the recasting of the text consisted in the re-ordering of rules. The import of this <b>cultural</b> <b>operation</b> still needs to be fully appraised: the present article will try to offer at least some hints for further research by analyzing the first two chapters of the Prakriyāsarvasva (namely the chapter on saṁjñā and the chapter on paribhāṣās) and the corresponding chapters in the Prakriyā- and Siddhāntakaumudī...|$|R
