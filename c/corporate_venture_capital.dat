5000|$|The {{repercussions of}} the current {{economic}} downturn have been felt throughout the field of <b>corporate</b> <b>venture</b> <b>capital</b> and healthcare has not been completely immune. For example, because of the scarcity of available funds within the biotech segment of the industry the valuation of private biotech firms {{is at an all-time}} low. [...] However, the healthcare industry is seen as somewhat recession-resistant and this has encouraged some investors within the field. [...] As such, while most major corporations with venture capital arms are keeping cash close to home, some of the first positive movement within <b>corporate</b> <b>venture</b> <b>capital</b> as a whole is coming from healthcare. The new venture fund recently opened by Merck Serono and the fund just closed by Ascension Health Ventures are just a few examples of the optimism that is slowly reentering venture capital within healthcare. The latest survey on the top 75 most influential healthcare <b>corporate</b> <b>venture</b> <b>capital</b> divisions shows they are increasingly influential and larger than many independent VCs.|$|E

40|$|Firms {{tend toward}} local search when they {{continue}} to build on own technological knowledge. Therefore, technological exploration has usually been associated with some form of boundary spanning activities. In line with previous research this study focuses on organizational or external boundary-spanning exploration, but in contrast to previous studies, it distinguishes between explorative learning from partners and from non-partners. Partners are considered as organizations with whom a focal firm {{has some kind of}} external venturing relations, i. e. technological alliances, <b>corporate</b> <b>venturing</b> <b>capital,</b> or M&As. Central in the study is the dual role of these external <b>corporate</b> <b>venturing</b> relations and their effect on the two types of exploration. In explorative learning from partners, the external venturing relationships function as pipes to exchange information between the partners. In explorative learning from non-partners, partners may play a role as prisms. That is, they inform the focal firm about technological opportunities beyond its current network. The results of the empirical analysis confirm the dual role of the partners in advancing the two types of explorative learning. The results furthermore indicate that intermediate levels of technological distance between a focal firm and its partners foster explorative learning from partners, while low levels of technological distance enhances explorative learning from non-partners. ...|$|R

40|$|Strategic investors, such as <b>corporate</b> <b>venture</b> capitalists, {{engage in}} the {{financing}} of start-up firms to complement their core businesses and to facilitate the internalization of externalities.
