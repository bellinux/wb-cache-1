5|$|Strobilurus esculentus and S.stephanocystis {{are similar}} in {{appearance}} to S.tenacellus. S.esculentus mushrooms have thin, sharp cap margins and only fruit on fallen spruce cones. S.stephanocystis has a yellow-brown to reddish-yellow <b>cap</b> <b>that</b> is not hygrophanous. Baeospora myosura is another small agaric that grows on pine and spruce cones, but it fruits in autumn.|$|E

5|$|Cyptotrama asprata (alternatively spelled aspratum), {{commonly}} known as the golden-scruffy collybia, is a saprobic species of mushroom in the family Physalacriaceae. Widely distributed in tropical regions of the world, it is characterized by the bright orange to yellow <b>cap</b> <b>that</b> in young specimens is covered with tufts of fibrils resembling small spikes. This fungus has had a varied taxonomical history, having been placed in fourteen genera before finally settling in Cyptotrama. This species is differentiated from several other similar members of genus Cyptotrama by variations in cap color, and spore size and shape.|$|E
5|$|Mycena maculata bears some {{resemblance}} to M.inclinata, but is only associated with decaying hardwood logs and stumps, and {{is found in}} eastern North America, and sometimes on oak on the West Coast. In age, it develops reddish spots on the gills that are not seen in M.inclinata. M.inclinata is often confused with the edible M.galericulata, a common species that is variable in cap color, size and shape. M.galericulata typically has a bluntly conical <b>cap</b> <b>that</b> is dull gray-brown, and white to grayish veins that have numerous cross-veins. M.polygramma has a ridged stem that is bluish-gray.|$|E
5|$|Psilocybe aztecorum is {{the type}} species of Guzmán's section Aztecorum, a group of bluing (i.e., psilocybin-containing) Psilocybe {{mushrooms}} characterized by having a strongly hygrophanous <b>cap</b> <b>that</b> dries to brown or brownish white when dry; spores that appear asymmetrical when seen in side view; and pleurocystidia that, when present, are hyaline (translucent). Other species classified in section Aztecorum are P.baeocystis and P.quebecensis.|$|E

5|$|Species of Crepidotus {{having a}} similar shape can be {{distinguished}} by their brown spore print, compared with the white spore print of P.stipticus. Schizophyllum commune has a densely hairy white to grayish cap and longitudinally split gill-folds on the underside. The ruddy panus mushroom (Panus rudis) is larger, has a reddish-brown <b>cap</b> <b>that</b> fades to pinkish-tan, and shows lilac tinges when young, fresh, and moist. Some Paxillus species may have a similar appearance, but they have yellow-brown spore prints.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the genus}} Entoloma, the fungus is {{classified}} in the subgenus Leptonia, section Cyanula because of its overall habit, clampless hyphae, and abundant granules of pigment. Noordeloos and Gates place it in the stirps (a grouping of related species within a genus) Austroprunicolor, characterized by mushrooms with a violaceous pink or blue <b>cap</b> <b>that</b> contrasts with a pallid, whitish, polished stipe.|$|E
5|$|Boletus roseolateritius, {{known from}} Mississippi, has a <b>cap</b> <b>that</b> changes color {{according}} to its age: it is initially dark reddish to orangish, later reddish brown at maturity, fading to brownish orange or brownish pink with dull yellow tints, and finally turning dull dingy yellow in age. Its pale yellow stipe lacks the reddish coloration and the hairs found {{on the base of}} B.subluridellus. Microscopically, it has smaller spores, measuring 8.5–12 by 3.5–4.5μm. Boletus rufocinnamomeus is also similar in appearance, but can be distinguished by its yellow stipe that is dotted with orange-cinnamon to brownish dots. Boletus flammans, another blue-bruising lookalike found in the southeastern United States, grows under conifers. It has a reddish stipe with fine reticulations on its upper half.|$|E

5|$|First called Agaricus cinerellus by Finnish mycologist Petter Karsten in 1879, he {{transferred}} {{it to the}} genus Mycena that same year. In his 1936 Flora Agaricina Danica (Agaric flora of Denmark) Jakob Emanuel Lange referred it to the genus Omphalia; Omphalia cinerea (P. Karst.) J.E. Lange is now a synonym. Mycena cineroides was named and described as a new species distinct from M.cinerella by Hintikka in 1963, who thought it to be unique due to its narrowly acute <b>cap</b> <b>that</b> lacked brownish or yellowish tones, decurrent gills, and two-spored basidia. However, intermediate forms of it have been found, and some authorities, like Dutch Mycena specialist Maas Geesteranus, believe it {{should be treated as}} a synonym of M.cinerella.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius xanthogalactus {{has nearly}} {{identical}} microscopic features to L.vinaceorufescens, but macroscopically, {{it does not}} have the reddish-vinaceous stains that develop on the cap, gills, and stem of L.vinaceorufescens, and it grows on the ground under oak. Another lookalike is L.colorascens, but it may be distinguished from L.vinaceorufescens by several features: a smaller fruit body; a whitish <b>cap</b> <b>that</b> becomes brownish red with age and does not spot vinaceous or brown; bitter to faintly acrid latex; and slightly smaller spores. L.chrysorrheus is also similar, but it has a whitish to pale yellowish-cinnamon cap with slightly darker spots and grows under hardwoods (especially oak) on well-drained, often sandy soil, and its gills do not discolor or spot vinaceous or brown.|$|E
5|$|Miller noted there {{appeared}} to be two colour forms reported across its range, namely a more cream-coloured form with darker shades of brown and grey in its <b>cap</b> <b>that</b> darkens with age, and a more wholly brownish form with paler edges and darker centre to its cap. He found the cream-coloured form to be strongly luminescent—the brightest of any fungus in the genus—with the cap, stipe and gills all glowing. The brown form was generally fainter, with its luminescence restricted to the gills. However, some strongly luminescent wholly brown-coloured mushrooms were recorded, and laboratory experiments showed all interbred freely and produced fertile offspring, leading Miller to conclude that these were phenotypic variants of a single taxon.|$|E

5|$|Mushrooms with an {{appearance}} similar to S.lakei {{can often be}} distinguished by their associations with trees. For example, the eastern North American species S.spraguei grows in association with Eastern White Pine. The cap of S.spraguei has red fibrils on a yellow background. S.cavipes and S.ochraceoroseus always grow with Larch. S.ponderosus, which grows in mixed coniferous forests, has a gelatinous veil. Smith and Thiers note {{that it is difficult}} to tell the difference between the two if S.ponderosus has lost its veil, since the colors of the species intergrade and cannot reliably be used to distinguish them. S.decipiens has a <b>cap</b> <b>that</b> is orangish to pink-orange with hairs or scales. S.caerulescens is a similar species in western North America; it can be distinguished by the strong blue staining that develops when the stem is injured.|$|E
5|$|The {{headgear}} of {{the typical}} Confederate Infantryman was the slouch hat, or the military Kepi. The Kepi is a short fatigue and dress <b>cap</b> <b>that</b> was easy to manufacture for the Army during the war. This type of hat had its drawbacks, however. It provided little weather protection, and was worn out easily {{after a few months}} of hard wear. The Infantryman design cap was sky-blue with a dark blue band, but this was rarely seen outside of officer private-purchase caps. More typical would be the plain gray/brown cap, with or without the branch of service trim. There are examples of deep-south made caps that were trimmed in red cotton and wool, and issued to Infantry units, showing that any available clothing was issued to the troops as the war progressed.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} now {{thought to have}} evolved from an Agaricus ancestor, and adapted for {{survival}} in dry habitats. These adaptations include: a <b>cap</b> <b>that</b> does not expand (thus conserving moisture); dark-colored gills that do not forcibly eject spores (a mechanism known to depend on turgor pressure achievable only in sufficiently hydrated environments); and a partial veil that remains on the fruit body long after it has matured. This form of growth is called secotioid development, and is typical of other desert-dwelling fungi like Battarrea phalloides, Podaxis pistillaris, and Montagnea arenaria. Molecular analysis based on the sequences of the partial large subunit of ribosomal DNA and of the internal transcribed spacers shows that A.deserticola {{is closely related to}} but distinct from A.aridicola. A separate analysis showed A.deserticola to be closely related to A.arvensis and A.abruptibulbus.|$|E

5|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} in the scientific literature by the Czech physician and mycologist Julius Vincenz von Krombholz in 1828, under the name Morchella bohemica. The German naturalist Joseph Schröter transferred it to the genus Verpa in 1893. Ptychoverpa bohemica is a synonym that was published by Frenchman Jean Louis Émile Boudier in his 1907 treatise on the Discomycetes of Europe; the name is still occasionally used, especially in European publications. Boudier believed that the large, curved ascospores and the rare and short paraphyses were sufficiently distinct to warrant a new genus to contain the single species. Ptychoverpa has also been classified as a section of Verpa. The section {{is characterized by the}} presence of thick longitudinal ridges on the <b>cap</b> <b>that</b> can be simple or forked.|$|E
5|$|Young {{specimens}} of Tylopilus rubrobrunneus have a purplish cap, but unlike T.plumbeoviolaceous, their stems are never purple. The species Tylopilus microsporus, known only from China, {{is characterized by}} pale violet to violet cap, paler purple to purplish brown stem, and flesh color to pale purplish red pores. In addition to its different distribution, it can be distinguished from T.plumbeoviolaceus by its smaller spores. Another similar Asian species, T.obscureviolaceus, is only known from the Yaeyama Islands in southwestern Japan. It differs from T.plumbeoviolaceous in having a <b>cap</b> <b>that</b> does not fade in color to grayish or brownish when mature, shorter spores (6–7.2 by 3.3–4µm), and other microscopic characteristics.|$|E
5|$|Boletellus ananas, {{commonly}} known as the pineapple bolete, is a mushroom in the family Boletaceae, and the type species of the genus Boletellus. It is distributed in southeastern North America, northeastern South America, Asia, and New Zealand, where it grows scattered or in groups on the ground, often at the base of oak and pine trees. The fruit body is characterized by the reddish-pink (or pinkish-tan to yellowish if an older specimen) scales on the <b>cap</b> <b>that</b> are often found hanging from the edge. The pore surface {{on the underside of the}} cap is made of irregular or angular pores up to 2mm wide that bruise a blue color. It is yellow when young but ages to a deep olive-brown color. Microscopically, B.ananas is distinguished by large spores with cross striae on the ridges and spirally encrusted hyphae in the marginal appendiculae and flesh of the stem. Previously known as Boletus ananas and Boletus coccinea (among other synonyms), the species was given its current name by William Alphonso Murrill in 1909. Two varieties of Boletellus ananas have been described. Although the mushroom may be considered edible, it is not recommended for consumption.|$|E
