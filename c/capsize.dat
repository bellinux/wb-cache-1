5|$|<b>Capsize</b> is {{the word}} used to {{describe}} a bike falling over without oscillation. During <b>capsize,</b> an uncontrolled front wheel usually steers {{in the direction of}} lean, but never enough to stop the increasing lean, until a very high lean angle is reached, at which point the steering may turn in the opposite direction. A <b>capsize</b> can happen very slowly if the bike is moving forward rapidly. Because the <b>capsize</b> instability is so slow, on the order of seconds, it is easy for the rider to control, and is actually used by the rider to initiate the lean necessary for a turn.|$|E
5|$|April 20, 2003– Swells from Tropical Storm Ana <b>capsize</b> a boat near Jupiter, {{killing two}} of the four {{passengers}} aboard.|$|E
5|$|For most bikes, {{depending}} on geometry and mass distribution, <b>capsize</b> is stable at low speeds, and becomes less stable as speed increases {{until it is}} no longer stable. However, on many bikes, tire interaction with the pavement is sufficient to prevent <b>capsize</b> from becoming unstable at high speeds.|$|E
25|$|A <b>capsized</b> kayak may be righted with a roll or eskimo rescue. As {{long as the}} kayaker {{knows how}} to react, the water is not too shallow, and the {{location}} is not close to dangers which that require evasive action by the kayaker – which cannot be taken while <b>capsized</b> – <b>capsizing</b> itself is usually not considered dangerous. In whitewater kayaking, <b>capsizing</b> occurs frequently and is accepted as an ordinary part of the sport.|$|R
50|$|She {{was mounted}} {{more and more}} to the wind, with waves, more from abaft the beam (behind), hitting roughly from the side. Radio contact was {{maintained}} until the end. She sent her last audible SOS call at 12:54 and an indecipherable one at 13:03; she was <b>capsizing</b> around this time. At least one lifeboat broke free before the capsize; others detached briefly before or during the <b>capsizing</b> and sinking. Nobody boarded a lifeboat before she <b>capsized,</b> and nobody jumped overboard: when she <b>capsized,</b> all 86 men were still on board.|$|R
50|$|<b>Capsizing</b> or keeling over {{occurs when}} a boat or ship is turned on its side or it is upside down in the water. The act of {{reversing}} a <b>capsized</b> vessel is called righting. If a <b>capsized</b> vessel has enough flotation to prevent sinking, it may recover on its own if the stability is such {{that it is not}} stable inverted. Vessels of this design are called self-righting.|$|R
5|$|October 18, 1749– A {{powerful}} hurricane remains offshore, {{which causes}} high tides that <b>capsize</b> nine ships near Ocracoka.|$|E
5|$|Once a turn is established, {{the torque}} {{that must be}} applied to the {{steering}} mechanism in order to maintain a constant radius at a constant forward speed depends on the forward speed and the geometry and mass distribution of the bike. At speeds below the <b>capsize</b> speed, described below in the section on Eigenvalues and also called the inversion speed, the self-stability of the bike will cause it to tend to steer into the turn, righting itself and exiting the turn, unless a torque is applied in the opposite direction of the turn. At speeds above the <b>capsize</b> speed, the <b>capsize</b> instability will cause it to tend to steer out of the turn, increasing the lean, unless a torque is applied {{in the direction of the}} turn. At the <b>capsize</b> speed no input steering torque is necessary to maintain the steady-state turn.|$|E
5|$|The {{forward speed}} at which non-oscillatory leaning increases, where the <b>capsize</b> mode {{eigenvalues}} switch from negative to positive in a pitchfork bifurcation at about 8m/s (18mph) in this example, is called the <b>capsize</b> speed. Above this speed, this non-oscillating lean eventually causes the uncontrolled bike to fall over.|$|E

5|$|July 25, 1985– The {{remnants}} of Hurricane Bob cause moderate rainfall in southern Maryland, and light wind gusts. Rough seas {{from the system}} <b>capsize</b> a few boats along the Potomac River, and the rainfall collapses a house under construction in Great Falls, Maryland.|$|E
5|$|In 1970, David E. H. Jones {{published}} an article in Physics Today showing that gyroscopic effects are not necessary to balance a bicycle. Since 1971, when he identified and named the wobble, weave and <b>capsize</b> modes, Robin Sharp has written regularly about the behavior of motorcycles and bicycles. While at Imperial College, London, he worked with David Limebeer and Simos Evangelou.|$|E
5|$|Loading and {{unloading}} a bulker is {{time-consuming and}} dangerous. The process is planned by the ship's chief mate under {{the direct and}} continued supervision of ship's captain. International regulations require that the captain and terminal master agree on a detailed plan before operations begin. Deck officers and stevedores oversee the operations. Occasionally loading errors are made that cause a ship to <b>capsize</b> or break in half at the pier.|$|E

5|$|November 5, 1998 - Tropical Storm Mitch makes {{landfall}} near Naples {{and drops}} up to 11.2inches (284mm) of rainfall in Boca Raton. The storm spawns five tornadoes, injuring 65people and damaging or destroying 645homes. Two people die in Monroe County when their respective fishing boats <b>capsize,</b> and {{damage in the}} state amounts to $40million (1998USD, $53million 2008USD).|$|E
5|$|On Saipan, Typhoon Joan {{destroyed}} 37houses {{and caused}} an island-wide power outage. Three {{people were injured}} due to boarding up their house during the storm. On nearby Anatahan, high winds caused $200,000 (1997USD) worth of crop and property damage. Later, high waves affected southern Japan and northwestern Hawaii. On Chichi-jima, Joan caused a boat to <b>capsize,</b> killing one of its occupants and leaving two others missing.|$|E
5|$|Sailing {{from the}} Indian state of Gujarat to Dubai, a ship with the call sign MSV Shiv Sagar MNV 2169 {{encountered}} Keila offshore southern Oman.

50|$|On 6 March 1987, {{the roll}} on/roll off ferry, MS Herald of Free Enterprise, <b>capsized</b> {{off the coast}} of Zeebrugge with 80 crew and 459 {{passengers}} aboard. 193 were killed in the <b>capsizing.</b> The operator of the ship, Townsend Thoresen, had been purchased by P&O in 1986.|$|R
5|$|Cargo {{shifting}} poses a {{great danger}} for bulkers. The problem {{is even more}} pronounced with grain cargoes, since grain settles during a voyage and creates extra space between {{the top of the}} cargo and the top of the hold. Cargo is then free to move {{from one side of the}} ship to the other as the ship rolls. This can cause the ship to list, which, in turn, causes more cargo to shift. This kind of chain reaction can <b>capsize</b> a bulker very quickly.|$|E
5|$|Experimentation {{with real}} bikes {{has so far}} {{confirmed}} the weave mode predicted by the eigenvalues. It was found that tire slip and frame flex are not important for the lateral dynamics of the bicycle in the speed range up to 6 m/s. The idealized bike model {{used to calculate the}} eigenvalues shown here does not incorporate any of the torques that real tires can generate, and so tire interaction with the pavement cannot prevent the <b>capsize</b> mode from becoming unstable at high speeds, as Wilson and Cossalter suggest happens in the real world.|$|E
5|$|Frauenlob {{spent her}} entire {{career in the}} {{reconnaissance}} forces of the High Seas Fleet. She saw action during World War I at the Battle of Heligoland Bight in August 1914, where she badly damaged the British cruiser , and at the Battle of Jutland on 31 May 1916. There, in a chaotic night engagement, Frauenlob {{was hit by a}} torpedo launched by , which caused the ship to <b>capsize</b> and sink with the vast majority of her crew. The wreck was discovered in 2000, and is in remarkably good condition, sitting upright on the ocean floor.|$|E

5|$|In {{traditional}} tales {{the blue}} men {{have the power}} to create severe storms, but when the weather is fine they sleep or float just under the surface of the water. They swim with their torso from the waist upwards raised out of the sea, twisting and diving in a similar way to a porpoise. To amuse themselves the creatures play shinty when the skies are clear and bright at night. They are able to speak and converse with mariners and are especially vocal when soaking vessels with water spray, roaring with laughter as vessels <b>capsize.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{passing the}} gun batteries, {{the crew of}} Blücher, {{including}} the personnel manning the guns, were tasked with fighting the fire. By that time she {{had taken on a}} list of 18degrees, although this was not initially problematic. The fire eventually reached one of the ship's 10.5cm ammunition magazines between turbine room 1 and turbine room 2/3, which exploded violently. The blast ruptured several bulkheads in the engine rooms and ignited the ship's fuel stores. The battered ship slowly began to <b>capsize</b> and the order to abandon ship was given. Blücher rolled over and sank at 07:30, with significant casualties. Naval historian Erich Gröner states that the number of casualties is unknown, but Henrik Lunde gives a loss of life figure ranging between 600 and 1,000 soldiers and sailors. Jürgen Rohwer meanwhile states that 125 seamen and 195 soldiers died in the sinking.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from their}} blue colour, the mythical creatures {{look much like}} humans, and {{are about the same}} size. They have the power to create storms, but when the weather is fine they float {{sleeping}} on or just {{below the surface of the}} water. The blue men swim with their torsos raised out of the sea, twisting and diving as porpoises do. They are able to speak, and when a group approaches a ship its chief may shout two lines of poetry to the master of the vessel and challenge him to complete the verse. If the skipper fails in that task then the blue men will attempt to overturn the ship and <b>capsize</b> it.|$|E
