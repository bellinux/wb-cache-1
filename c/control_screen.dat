25|$|This is {{selected}} where the liner {{is required to}} mechanically hold back the movement of formation sand. There are many variants of openhole sand control, the three popular choices being stand-alone screens, openhole gravel packs (also known as external gravel packs, where a sized sand 'gravel' is placed as an annulus around the sand <b>control</b> <b>screen)</b> and expandable screens. Screen designs are mainly wire-wrap or premium; wire-wrap screens use spiral-welded corrosion-resistant wire wrapped around a drilled basepipe to provide a consistent small helical gap (such as , termed 12 gauge). Premium screens use a woven metal cloth wrapped around a basepipe. Expandable screens are run to depth before being mechanically swaged to a larger diameter. Ideally, expandable screens will be swaged until they contact the wellbore wall.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{controls}} are {{relegated to the}} nine keys of the number pad, and the game is completely playable using only the keyboard (numpad keys and enter), excluding the start menu and <b>control</b> <b>screen.</b> This is assisted by a visual representation of the keypad in the lower {{right corner of the}} screen, which also shows the function of each key at any given time. For example, during ship-to-ship combat, the [...] "3", [...] "7", and [...] "1" [...] keys on the numpad representation are shown with images of different cannonball types - these buttons are used to select different types of cannonballs to fire. The on-screen keypad can also be clicked with a mouse, performing the same function as the keyboard key would have performed. Though the mouse can be used for various commands, the keypad is the preferred input mechanism due to the game's mechanics.|$|E

These displays should show the current value, normal range, alert type and range, and predictive information. Respondents wanted to see system relationships to one another for both component control and menu selection. When bringing up these various displays, this information should come up with a single button push. Finally, checklists should sense when a component has changed to the desired state...|$|R
