Chinese <b>Brake</b> <b>fern</b> exuded 2 times more dissolved organic carbon (DOC) than Boston fern and the difference was more pronounced under As stress. The composition of organic acids in the root exudates for both ferns consisted mainly of phytic acid and oxalic acid. However, Chinese <b>Brake</b> <b>fern</b> produced 0. 46 to 1. 06 times more phytic acid than Boston fern under As stress, and exuded 3 – 5 times more oxalic acid than Boston fern in all treatments. Consequently, root exudates from Chinese <b>Brake</b> <b>fern</b> mobilized more As from aluminum arsenate (3 – 4 times), iron arsenate (4 – 6 times) and CCA-contaminated soil (6 – 18 times) than Boston <b>fern.</b> Chinese <b>Brake</b> <b>fern</b> took up more As and translocated more As to the fronds than Boston fern.

Arsenic accumulation increased with an in-crease in arsenic concentration in the growth medium, the most being found in P. vittata fronds showing no toxicity symptoms. In addition, accumulation was high-est in the fronds, followed by the rhizome, and finally the roots, in all three fern species. Thiobarbituric acid-reacting substances, indicators of stress in plants, were found to be lowest in P. vittata, which corre-sponds with its observed tolerance to arsenic. All three ferns responded differentially to arsenic exposure in terms of anti-oxidative defence. Higher levels of super-oxide dismutase, catalase, and ascorbate peroxidase were observed in P. vittata than in P. ensiformis and N. exaltata, showing their active involvement in the arsenic detoxification mechanism.

Phytoremediation, an emerging, plant-based technology for the removal of toxic contaminants from soil and water, has been receiving renewed attention.

In this study, plant samples after 20 weeks of growth in an arsenic-contaminated soil were used for arsenic speciation and distribution study.
