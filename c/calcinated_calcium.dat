40|$|The {{effect of}} {{chlorine}} wash {{in combination with}} <b>calcinated</b> <b>calcium</b> spray on E. coli O 157 :H 7 population reduction on radish sprouts was investigated. The results showed that spraying radish seeds soaked in 200 ppm chlorine solution with 0. 04 % <b>calcinated</b> <b>calcium</b> solution had potential in inhibiting growth of E. coli O 157 :H 7. The study also demonstrated that 20, 000 ppm chlorine wash was not sufficient to completely eliminate E. coli O 157 :H 7 on radish seeds. The effect of seed surface roughness on E. coli O! 57 :H 7 population reduction by selected sanitizers was also studied. Among the seeds tested, radish seed was the roughest followed by broccoli and alfalfa seeds. A combination of 10 % malic acid and 1 % TDS (a surfactant) seemed to be as or more effective than 20, 000 ppm chlorine in inactivating E. coli O 157 :H 7 on alfalfa, broccoli, and radish seeds. In general, there was a negative correlation between seed surface roughness and E. coli O 157 :H 7 population reduction...|$|E
40|$|Biodiesel is a {{fatty acid}} alkyl ester which is renewable, {{biodegradable}} and non toxic fuel {{which can be}} derived from any vegetable oil by transesterification process. One of the popularly used non edible biodiesel in India is karanja oil methyl ester (KOME). In the present investigation, karanja oil based methyl ester (biodiesel) is produced by using <b>calcinated</b> <b>calcium</b> oxide, a heterogeneous base catalyst by transesterification process. The properties of KOME thus obtained are comparable with ASTM biodiesel standards. The produced KOME is blended with diesel were tested for their use as a substitute fuel for diesel engine. Experiments were conducted for Injection pressures of 200 bar and 225 bar, keeping compression ratio of 24 : 1 as constant, to study the performance and emission characteristics of a direct injection diesel engine using blends of karanja methyl esters with diesel on a 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 % volume basis, respectively. Thus acquired data were analyzed for various parameters such as brake thermal efficiency, brake specific fuel consumption, exhaust gas temperature, Carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbon (HC), carbon dioxide (CO 2) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions against varying Load...|$|E
