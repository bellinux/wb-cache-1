Using these facts, an expert <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> person's last drink was {{consumed}} {{on an empty}} stomach, which means absorption of the last drink (at 8:00) was complete within one hour-9:00. At {{the time of the}} stop, the driver is fully absorbed. The test result of 0.080 was at 10:00. So the one hour of elimination that has occurred since the stop is added in, making 0.080+0.015=0.095 the approximate breath alcohol concentration {{at the time of the}} stop.|$|E
500|$|As a child, Mars {{spent time}} impersonating Elvis Presley. This playact {{had a major}} impact on his musical evolution; he later reflected: I watch the best. I'm a big fan of Elvis. I'm a big fan of 1950s Elvis when he would go on stage and scare people because he was a force and girls would go nuts! You <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> same thing for Prince or The Police. It's just guys who know that people are here to see a show, so I watch those guys and I love {{studying}} them because I'm a fan." [...] He also impersonated Michael Jackson and Little Richard, both of whom are major inspirations of his. Mars was raised on his father’s doo-wop collection — “simple four-chord songs that got straight to the point” and on Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis,and Frankie Lymon. The hip-hop productions by The Neptunes and Timbaland, that were played on the radio constantly, also influenced him.|$|E
500|$|Chris Mincher of The A.V. Club was {{disappointed}} with the album, finding it stripped of its songwriting and control in lead singer Nathan Willett's voice from their debut album. Blake Solomon of AbsolutePunk found the album lacking in terms of instrumentals and songwriting saying, [...] "It's easy to see the great ideas from previous songs at work here, {{but there seems to}} be an intentional restraint placed on the band's likeable pop inclinations." [...] The Guardian criticized the album for its lackluster blues rock production and Willett's performance, saying [...] "his voice is too drearily clean-cut to deliver a true emotional punch." [...] Ian Cohen of Pitchfork felt that the album was hampered by the band's uninspired musicianship and songwriting and the hype surrounding them, saying that [...] "Proponents raved that Cold War Kids arrived fully formed, but as the band continues to stubbornly emphasize their weaknesses, Loyalty To Loyalty is proof that their detractors <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> same thing." ...|$|E

2500|$|Random selection, when {{narrowly}} {{associated with}} a simple random sample, is a method of selecting items (often called units) from a population where the probability of choosing a specific item is the proportion of those items in the population. [...] For example, with a bowl containing just 10 red marbles and 90 blue marbles, a random selection mechanism would choose a red marble with probability 1/10. [...] Note that a random selection mechanism that selected 10 marbles from this bowl would not necessarily result in 1 red and 9 blue. [...] In situations where a population consists of items that are distinguishable, a random selection mechanism requires equal probabilities for any item to be chosen. [...] That is, if the selection process is such that each member of a population, of say research subjects, has the same probability of being chosen then we <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> selection process is random.|$|E
