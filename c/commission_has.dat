In 1982, the British Ministry of Defence requested the Commission's assistance to design and construct cemeteries in the Falkland Islands for those killed during the Falklands War. Although these cemeteries are not Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemeteries, the Commission manages the administrative responsibilities for them. Since 2005, the <b>Commission</b> <b>has</b> carried out similar management duties {{on behalf of the}} British Ministry of Defence for cemeteries and graves of British and Imperial soldiers who died during the Second Boer War. In 2003, Veterans Affairs Canada employed the Commission to develop an approach to locate grave markers for which the Canadian Minister of Veterans Affairs has responsibility.

Commonwealth military service members are commemorated by name on either a headstone, at an identified site of a burial, or on a memorial. As a result, the Commission {{is currently}} responsible for the care of war dead at over 23,000 separate burial sites and maintenance of more than 200memorials worldwide. The vast majority of burial sites are pre-existing communal or municipal cemeteries and parish churchyards located in the United Kingdom, however the <b>Commission</b> <b>has</b> itself constructed approximately 2,500 war cemeteries worldwide. The <b>Commission</b> <b>has</b> also constructed or commissioned memorials to commemorate the dead who have no known grave; the largest of these is the Thiepval Memorial.|$|E

The monument was closed until 1989 for the repair work. In 2007, Carol Kimball of The Day wrote that the State of Connecticut has not funding repairs to the historic site, {{but it would be}} required if the monument were to continue to survive. Kimball also referenced a New York Times article on the neglected monument and that the bond <b>commission</b> <b>has</b> yet to issue the approved $350,000 for its preservation. Other costs including sidewalks surrounding the entrance, and Memorial Gate itself, would require another $150,000 to repair.|$|E

5|$|In May 2010, Franken {{proposed}} a financial reform legislation {{amendment that would}} create a board to select which credit rating agency would evaluate a given security. Currently any company issuing a security may select the company that evaluates the security. The amendment was passed; however, the financial industry lobbied to have Franken's amendment removed from the final bill. Negotiations between the Senate and House, whose version of financial reform did not include such a provision, resulted in the amendment's being watered down to require only {{a series of studies}} being done upon the issue for two years.

CenSeam is intended to provide the framework needed to prioritise, integrate, expand and facilitate seamount research efforts in order to significantly reduce the unknown and build towards a global understanding of seamount ecosystems, and the roles they have in the biogeography, biodiversity, productivity and evolution of marine organisms.|$|E
5|$|On February 2, 1425, Bartolomeo Valori and Cosimo de' Medici {{requested}} 400 of the 800florins {{that had}} been deposited with the Calimala, likely for work already completed.

This request is also the most direct piece of evidence for Cosimo's involvement with the commissioning. Despite this document, Vasari's claim in his Vite of 1550 that Cosimo was responsible for the handling of the <b>commission</b> <b>has</b> been questioned.|$|E
