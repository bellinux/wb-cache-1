500|$|Writing in Q magazine, Phil Sutcliffe {{contended that}} it [...] "does {{sound like a}} Pink Floyd album" [...] and {{highlighted}} the two-part [...] "A New Machine" [...] as, variously, [...] "a chillingly beautiful vocal exploration, a chorale of multitrack, echo and distortion broken into aching fragments by long moments of silence" [...] and [...] " [...] brilliant stroke of imagination". Sutcliffe concluded: [...] "A Momentary Lapse is Gilmour's album to much the same degree that the previous four under Floyd's name were dominated by Waters … <b>Clearly</b> <b>it</b> wasn't only business sense and repressed ego but repressed talent which drove the guitarist to insist on continuing under the band brand-name." [...] Recognising the return to the more music-oriented approach of Pink Floyd's classic works, Sounds said the album was [...] "back over the wall to where diamonds are crazy, moons have dark sides, and mothers have atom hearts".|$|E
500|$|Following the announcement, USC Interactive Media Division withdrew its {{sponsorship}} of the festival. Seven of the fourteen finalist games {{were removed from the}} contest by their developers in protest: Braid, flOw, Once Upon A Time, Toblo, Everyday Shooter, Book and Volume and Castle Crashers (Toblo was later reinstated by the DigiPen Institute of Technology, who owns the rights to the game). Developer Jonathan Blow of Braid stated: [...] " [...] lacks compassion, and I find the Artist's Statement disingenuous. But despite this, the game does have redeeming value. It does provoke important thoughts, and it does push the boundaries of what games are about. It is composed with more of an eye toward art than most games. <b>Clearly,</b> <b>it</b> belongs at the festival." [...] Blow and the other developers sent an open letter to the festival, encouraging the reinstatement of the game as keeping with the festival's [...] "trailblazing" [...] efforts. Despite protests, Baxter refused to change his mind, citing consideration for the shooting's victims and their families. Ledonne told the other finalists that he planned to go to the festival anyway and distribute copies of the game. Acknowledging that the withdrawal of six finalists compromised the competition, Roberts let the attendees vote on whether any prizes would be awarded; they decided not to.|$|E

500|$|In 1766 {{supercargo}} Johann Krause {{was probably}} the most experienced merchant trading in Madagascar, although he had been [...] "guilty of an earlier indiscretion in 1760", on the VOC ship Neptunus. To avoid the loss of profit caused by captive Malagasy dying while at sea, Krause convinced Captain Muller, who was in his first command and was unwell at the time, to unshackle some of them and let them work on deck. Disease was spreading among the Malagasy in the unsanitary conditions below deck, and the ship's surgeon had reported that, while there were no suitable medicines on board, disease was spreading to the crew. Consequently, two days after the ship had left Madagascar, the crew released a [...] "large party of [...] " [...] from confinement, the men assisting the crew and the women providing entertainment by dancing and singing. The Malagasy Massavana and some others were set to controlling and taking care of the sails, which has been described as [...] "unheard of, and certainly against all [...] regulations". Allowing slaves into secure areas on deck was common practice on most European vessels, and VOC regulations did permit slaves to be released onto the deck from time to time, under careful supervision. But the chief concern was that slaves might jump overboard to escape, rather than that they might mutiny, despite a slave mutiny on the VOC ship Drie Heuvelen in 1753. That mutiny was quickly suppressed, but <b>clearly</b> <b>it</b> could happen again, making Captain Muller's agreement to the kind of release that occurred on Meermin [...] "appear all the more foolish." ...|$|E
500|$|Performer Neal Medlyn re-enacted the DVD {{during his}} {{performance}} at the New Museum in April 2008 together with dancers Will Rawls and Erick Montes. His performance was one-hour long and it was titled The Neal Medlyn Experience Live. He sang along to the DVD audio track, complete with word-for-word between-song patter and band introductions. Booth Newspapers' Roger LeLeivre reviewed the re-enactment positively writing, [...] "The event... was a hoot, and the audience loved every second of it. Medlyn has Beyoncé's signature, often spastic, moves down pat, down to each minute hand gesture and facial expression... Unlike a drag show, Medlyn does not try to convince anyone they are seeing Beyoncé. There wasn't {{much in the way}} of costumes (well, he did enter in a black wig, tube top and hot pants, but those bit the dust rather quickly), and why bother?". He concluded that the length of the show was [...] "perfect" [...] as it [...] "ended before the shtick wore out its welcome". LeLeivre finished his review by writing, [...] "It was a delicious pop-culture skewering, right down to the back-up dancers, with their over-the-top moves and expressions... <b>Clearly</b> <b>it</b> enhanced the 'experience,' if you had a passing acquaintance with Beyoncé's songs... but such knowledge was not a prerequisite to enjoying this homage". Claudia La Rocco of The New York Times described his re-enactment as [...] "absurdly faithful" [...] and added that it wouldn't have been nearly as [...] "smart or touching" [...] without the dancing of Rawls and Montes. She further put the performance in her list of the [...] "richest" [...] moments of 2008 and noted, [...] "These astounding performers slipped between genders and among genres, enveloping Mr. Medlyn in utter fabulousness and proving just how sophisticated pop culture can be. Backup dancers everywhere should feel proud." ...|$|E

Following the incident, the Welsh Language Society complained to Channel 4, the regulator Ofcom and S4C. <b>Clearly,</b> <b>it</b> {{was no longer a}} problem after this as Glyn and Imogen continued to converse in Welsh.

2500|$|A charter, dated 664 AD, {{records the}} gift by King Wulfhere of Mercia of [...] "some additions" [...] to the {{endowment}} for the monastery of Medeshamstede, already begun by his deceased brother King Peada of the Middle Angles, and by King Oswiu of Northumbria. This charter is a forgery, produced for Peterborough Abbey either in the late 11th century, or in the early 12th; but, like Hugh Candidus, <b>clearly</b> <b>it</b> reflects Peterborough tradition, and it is both accurate and historically interesting {{in a number of}} ways, including in the chronology of kings. The connection with Peada places Medeshamstede's foundation between about 653 and 656 AD.|$|E

2500|$|The leeuwendaalder was {{authorized}} to contain 427.16 grains of [...]750 fine silver and passed locally for between 32 (at introduction in 1576) to 42 stuivers (the stuiver containing less silver over time). It was {{lighter than the}} large denomination coins then in circulation, namely the ducatoon (491 grains of [...]920 fine silver and passing at 3 guilders or 60 stuivers) and the rijksdaalder (448 grains of [...]885 fine silver passing at 2½ guilders or 50 stuivers). <b>Clearly</b> <b>it</b> was more advantageous for a Dutch merchant to pay a foreign debt in leeuwendaalders rather than in more costly rijksdaalders. Thus, the leeuwendaalder became the coin of choice for foreign trade. The coin was popular in the Middle East, the colonies {{in the east and}} in the west. It even was the origin for the names of the Romanian Leu.|$|E
2500|$|Émile Courtet's job as one {{of several}} assistants to Gill was to {{complete}} the backgrounds; he may have done {{a few of the}} illustrations by himself. [...] During this process, the young man developed a style of caricature based on Gill's. Gill's trademark was the large, recognizable head of the target (with a fairly benign expression) atop a small puppet body (doing something ridiculous). <b>Clearly,</b> <b>it</b> was based on Fantoche puppetry. Émile took this style and added touches to suggest movement and imagery from the rest of Guignol puppetry. At about this time he adopted the pseudonym of Émile Cohl. The meaning of [...] "Cohl" [...] is obscure: it may be from the pigment known as [...] "kohl", or perhaps it means that Émile stuck to his mentor Gill like glue ("colle" [...] in French). Perhaps it was chosen because it sounded exotic. The visual signature of a paste-pot appears in a few of Cohl's caricatures.|$|E
2500|$|Much {{has been}} made of Wallace's fondness for the colour pink. Shortly after being elected, while {{referring}} to Mary Mitchell O'Connor in Dáil Éireann, he said [...] "Miss Piggy has toned it down a bit today". He accepted full responsibility and later apologised, saying [...] "It was my fault. I passed the reference because of her handbag. I'm completely out of order. I don't have a leg to stand on [...] <b>Clearly</b> <b>it</b> was in bad taste." [...] He called Mitchell O'Connor to apologise and said he would write a letter of apology to her as well. In reference to his fondness for pink, Wallace dyed his hair that colour to raise awareness of cancer in February 2015. Since being elected to the Dáil {{together for the first time}} in 2011, Wallace and Dublin North TD Clare Daly have become friends and political allies, and have worked together on many campaigns, including opposition to austerity and revelations of various alleged Garda malpractices, including harassment, cancellation of penalty points in questionable circumstances and involvement of officers in the drug trade. In July 2014 they were both arrested at Shannon Airport while trying to inspect a military aircraft. Wallace said, [...] "All we wanted to do was confirm whether we are being told the truth." [...] Wallace was fined €2,000 for being in an airside area without permission, and chose not to pay. He was sentenced to 30 days in prison in default, and in December 2015 was arrested for non-payment of the fine.|$|E
