60|$|To {{determine}} {{the point at}} which evils, so formidable to human freedom and advancement, begin, or rather at which they begin to predominate over the benefits attending the collective application of the force of society, under its recognised chiefs, for the removal of the obstacles which {{stand in the way of}} its well-being; to secure as much of the advantages of centralised power and intelligence, as can be had without turning into governmental channels too great a proportion of the general activity, is one of the most difficult and complicated questions in the art of government. It is, in a great measure, a question of detail, in which many and various considerations must be kept in view, and no absolute rule can be laid down. But I believe that the practical principle in which safety resides, the ideal to be kept in view, the standard by which to test all arrangements intended for overcoming the difficulty, may be conveyed in these words: the greatest dissemination of power consistent with efficiency; but the greatest possible <b>centralisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>information,</b> and diffusion of it from the centre. Thus, in municipal administration, there would be, as in the New England States, a very minute division among separate officers, chosen by the localities, of all business which is not better left to the persons directly interested; but besides this, there would be, in each department of local affairs, a central superintendence, forming a branch of the general government. The organ of this superintendence would concentrate, as in a focus, the variety of information and experience derived from the conduct of that branch of public business in all the localities, from everything analogous which is done in foreign countries, and from the general principles of political science. This central organ should have a right to know all that is done, and its special duty should be that of making the knowledge acquired in one place available for others. Emancipated from the petty prejudices and narrow views of a locality by its elevated position and comprehensive sphere of observation, its advice would naturally carry much authority; but its actual power, as a permanent institution, should, I conceive, be limited to compelling the local officers to obey the laws laid down for their guidance. In all things not provided for by general rules, those officers should be left to their own judgment, under responsibility to their constituents. For the violation of rules, they should be responsible to law, and the rules themselves should be laid down by the legislature; the central administrative authority only watching over their execution, and if they were not properly carried into effect, appealing, according to the nature of the case, to the tribunal to enforce the law, or to the constituencies to dismiss the functionaries who had not executed it according to its spirit. Such, in its general conception, is the central superintendence which the Poor Law Board is intended to exercise over the administrators of the Poor Rate throughout the country. Whatever powers the Board exercises beyond this limit, were right and necessary in that peculiar case, for the cure of rooted habits of maladministration in matters deeply affecting not the localities merely, but the whole community; since no locality has a moral right to make itself by mismanagement a nest of pauperism, necessarily overflowing into other localities, and impairing the moral and physical condition of the whole labouring community. The powers of administrative coercion and subordinate legislation possessed by the Poor Law Board (but which, owing to the state of opinion on the subject, are very scantily exercised by them), though perfectly justifiable in a case of first-rate national interest, would be wholly out of place in the superintendence of interests purely local. But a central organ of information and instruction for all the localities, would be equally valuable in all departments of administration. A government cannot have too much of the kind of activity which does not impede, but aids and stimulates, individual exertion and development. The mischief begins when, instead of calling forth the activity and powers of individuals and bodies, it substitutes its own activity for theirs; when, instead of informing, advising, and, upon occasion, denouncing, it makes them work in fetters, or bids them stand aside and does their work instead of them. The worth of a State, in the long run, is the worth of the individuals composing it; and a State which postpones the interests of their mental expansion and elevation, to a little more of administrative skill, or of that semblance of it which practice gives, in the details of business; a State which dwarfs its men, in order that they may be more docile instruments in its hands even for beneficial purposes, will find that with small men no great thing can really be accomplished; and that the perfection of machinery to which it has sacrificed everything, will in the end avail it nothing, for want of the vital power which, in order that the machine might work more smoothly, it has preferred to banish.|$|E

50|$|There {{were two}} major {{reasons why the}} debtor {{countries}} did not have accurate debt data and a performing CBDMS. The first one {{was the lack of}} <b>centralisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> on foreign debt and an inefficient legislation on public guarantees. The second one was the lack of availability of debt managers to produce comprehensive specifications for the computer specialists. The urgent nature of the problems that a debt manager had to solve at the time would lead him to address specific punctual problems, for instance preparing the Paris Club and then preparing the negotiations with private banks. This will imply the collection of data in two different databases and the development of two different computer systems. These two systems once developed they would be interfaced, the outcome being an inflexible and unpractical computer patchwork inefficient and expensive to maintain.|$|E
50|$|CrimTrac {{commenced}} {{as a small}} {{national agency}} located in the national capital - Canberra, and staffed by Australian Public Servants. Police specialists and contractors assist where necessary. It has required strong cooperation from all police services, particularly on Information and Communications Technology (ICT). Even with the advantage of an IGA, CrimTrac's startup, growth and management {{in the first five}} years was challenging as it addressed its NEPI legacy whilst scoping new IT systems to deliver better shared policing information. Those years required sustained effort by the staff of CrimTrac and by its Board of Management, drawn from the IGA parties, at Police Commissioner level. CrimTrac continues to face challenges as a result of Australia's federational style of government, which has produced nine different sets of criminal legislation and nine individual police systems that must communicate to allow the <b>centralisation</b> <b>of</b> policing <b>information.</b> The national DNA database took eight years to become fully functional because of minor differences in Commonwealth, state and territory legislation.|$|R

40|$|Characteristics of the South Australian winegrape market are: many {{scattered}} growers, {{relatively few}} grape buyers (winemakers), a perishable product and legislated prices for grapes. Because {{of the problems}} associated with grape pricing in Victoria and New South Wales, as well as in South Australia, the establishment of a free market for grapes was recommended in 1985 by a high level inquiry (McKay report). While the number of participants {{on both sides of the}} market may be sufficient for a free market, the lack of market information is likely to lead to a situation of high marketing risks for grape gravers due to widely dispersed prices. The scattered nature of grapegrowing makes search costs hiqh, accentuating price variability. Economic theory is drawn upon to highlight the potential for the use of market power when incomplete and costly information exists. Also, when this state exists supply and demand shocks cannot be perfectly arbitrated. <b>Centralisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> would increase the number of effective traders in the winegrape market, and results from experimental economics support centralisation and greater availability of information as factors reducing price risks in markets. The theory also suggests that the problem of 'white noise' may not be a serious problem in such a market. It is argued that centralisation of the winegrape market is best undertaken with the aid of computers due to the reduced costs of hardware and the availability of software to handle centralized marketing...|$|E

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. The investigation and modelling of aviation accident causation is dominated by linear models. Aviation is, however, a complex system and as such suffers from being artificially manipulated into non-complex models and methods. This thesis addresses this issue by developing {{a new approach to}} investigating aviation accident causation through information networks. These networks centralise communication and the flow <b>of</b> <b>information</b> as key indicators of a system‟s health and risk. The holistic approach focuses on the system itself rather than any individual event. The activity and communication of constituent elements, both human and non-human agents, within that system is identified and highlights areas of system failure. The model offers many potential developments and some key areas are studied in this research. Through the <b>centralisation</b> <b>of</b> barriers and <b>information</b> nodes the method can be applied to almost any situation. The application of Bayesian mathematics to historical data populations provides scope for studying error migration and barrier manipulation. The thesis also provides application of these predictions to a flight simulator study in an attempt of validation. Beyond this the thesis also discusses the applicability of the approach to industry. Through working with a legacy airline the methods discussed are used as the basis for a new and forward-thinking safety management system. This holistic approach focuses on the system environment, the activity that takes place within it, the strategies used to conduct this activity, {{the way in which the}} constituent parts of the system (both human and non-human) interact and the behaviour required.

40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} role <b>of</b> the <b>information</b> management process within a process-oriented enterprise, Xerox Ltd. The research approach {{is based on}} a post-positive paradigm and has resulted in thirty-five idiographic statements. The three major outcomes are: 1. The process-oriented holistic enterprise is an organisation that requires a long-term management commitment to its development. It depends on the careful management <b>of</b> people, tasks, <b>information</b> and technology. A complex integration of business processes is required and this can be managed through the use of consistent documentation techniques, clarity in the definition of process responsibilities and management attention to the global metrics and the <b>centralisation</b> <b>of</b> the management of the process model are critical to its success. 2. The role <b>of</b> the <b>information</b> management process {{within the context of a}} process-oriented enterprise is to provide flexible and cost-effective applications, technological, and process support to the business. This is best achieved through a <b>centralisation</b> <b>of</b> the management <b>of</b> <b>information</b> management and <b>of</b> the process model. A business-led approach combined with the consolidation <b>of</b> applications, <b>information,</b> process, and data architectures is central to providing effective business and process-focused support. 3. In a process oriented holistic enterprise, process and information management are inextricably linked. The model of process management depends heavily on information management, whilst the model <b>of</b> <b>information</b> management is totally focused around supporting and creating the process model. The two models are mutually creating - one cannot exist without the other. There is a duality concept <b>of</b> process and <b>information</b> management...|$|R
