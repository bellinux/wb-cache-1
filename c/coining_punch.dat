40|$|The project {{conceived}} within engineer’s {{studies of}} branch 2303 T 002 is subbmitting {{a proposal for}} radial bearing cage produce technology. It is also subbmitting a design solution to functional parts for blanking the “windows” and coining the “locks”. The cage will be made from sheet steel 11 300. 29. This cage should replace the current one machined from the brass Ms 58 Al. According to the literary research and development experiences of the company ZKL Brno, a. s., two pairs of tools were designed. First one for blanking the “windows” {{and second one for}} coining the “locks”. Blanking punch, blanking die and <b>coining</b> <b>punch</b> will be made from the steel 19436, coining die will be made from the steel 19312. Heat-treating process will be accomplished according to the enclosed drawings. Both pairs of tools will be mounted in the press LENR 63 AU (manufactured by the company ŠMERAL Trnava), with nominal force 630 kN...|$|E

5000|$|The {{designs of}} the artists who made the first <b>coin</b> <b>punches</b> were stylized {{with a degree of}} skill that could not be mistaken for common handiwork—salient and very {{specific}} types designed to be reproduced ad infinitum. Unlike the first typefaces used to print books in the 13th century, coin types were neither combined nor printed with ink on paper, but [...] "published" [...] in metal—a more durable medium—and survived in substantial numbers. As the portable face of ruling authority, coins were a compact form of standardized knowledge issued in large editions, an early mass medium that stabilized trade and civilization throughout the Mediterranean world of antiquity.|$|R

50|$|During the Mauryan period, punch-marked coins {{continued}} to be issued in large quantities. Shortly after {{the establishment of the}} Mauryan dynasty in Magadha, the Magadha kingdom morphed into the Mauryan Empire. Similarly, the coinage of the Mauryan Empire was a continuation of the punch-marked coinage of Magadha. Each coin contained on average 50-54 grains of silver depending on wear and 32 rattis in weight Manusmriti, and earlier coins are flatter than later <b>coins.</b> <b>Punches</b> on these <b>coins</b> count to 450 different types with the most common the sun and six-armed symbols, and various forms of geometrical patterns, circles, wheels, human figures, various animals, bows and arrows, hills and trees etc. Many are barely discernible for what they could be.|$|R

50|$|The Mauryan <b>coins</b> were <b>punch</b> {{marked with}} the royal {{standard}} to ascertain their authenticity. The Arthashastra, written by Kautilya, mentions minting of coins but also indicates that the violation of the Imperial Maurya standards by private enterprises {{may have been an}} offence. Kautilya also seemed to advocate a theory of bimetallism for coinage, which involved the use of two metals, copper and silver, under one government.|$|R
5|$|Currency {{was often}} used for {{settling}} judicial fines, taxes and payments for goods or services. However, remuneration for services to the king, officials and temples were often made {{in the form of}} land revenue. The oldest coins found at Anuradhapura date up to 200 BC. These earliest <b>coins</b> were <b>punch</b> marked rectangular pieces of silver known as kahavanu. These eventually became circular in shape, which were in turn followed by die struck coins. Uncoined metals, particularly gold and silver, were used for trading as well. Patterns of elephants, horses, swastika and Dharmacakra were commonly imprinted on the coins of this period.|$|R
50|$|Pulakeshin was {{the first}} ruler in South India to issue gold coinage. Broad and {{circular}} in shape, the punch-marked <b>coins</b> had various <b>punches</b> at the edge, and a central punch depicting a Varaha or Boar. The Boar was the royal emblem of the Chalukyas. Contemporary literature cites the gold coins of south India as Varahas.|$|R

The physical and visual analysis and the {{description of}} the characteristics can be employed for intelligence purposes. Besides photography and manual measurements of dimensions, some optical instruments are employed for detailed measurements of physical characteristics. In this work, the method of 3 D surface digitizing is introduced as a suitable tool for highly accurate documentation of small objects, especially for pressed drug products. The resulting detailed information about the geometry, and the results of an automatic comparison of apparently uniform tablets and <b>coins</b> with <b>punches,</b> can support drug intelligence...|$|R

Advancements in automated metalworking technology have made progressive die stamping possible which is a method that can encompass <b>punching,</b> <b>coining,</b> bending and several other ways below that modify metal at less cost while resulting in less scrap.|$|R
50|$|They paint {{their bodies}} with a dye made from Genipa americana, the berry {{of a species}} of genip tree. The black dye is thought to repel insects and the designs are known as Jagua Tattoos. On special occasions, using this same dye, they print {{intricate}} geometric patterns all over their bodies, using wood blocks carved from balsa wood. The women also wear silver necklaces and silver earrings on these special occasions; many of the necklaces being made of old silver <b>coins.</b> They <b>punch</b> {{a hole in the}} coin and run a silver chain through it. Many of the coins on these necklaces date to the 19th century and are passed down from mother to daughter.|$|R
50|$|Coining: {{is similar}} to forming with the main {{difference}} being that a coining die may form completely different features on either face of the blank, these features being transferred {{from the face of}} the punch or die respectively. The <b>coining</b> die and <b>punch</b> flow the metal by squeezing the blank within a confined area, instead of bending the blank. For example: an Olympic medal that was formed from a coining die may have a flat surface on the back and a raised feature on the front. If the medal was formed (or embossed), the surface on the back would be the reverse image of the front.|$|R
5000|$|After {{the colony}} of New South Wales {{was founded in}} Australia in 1788, it ran into the problem {{of a lack of}} coinage, {{particularly}} since trading vessels took coins out of the colony in exchange for their cargo. In 1813, Governor Lachlan Macquarie made creative use of £10,000 in Spanish dollars sent by the British government. To make it difficult to take the coins out of the colony, and to double their number, the centres of the <b>coins</b> were <b>punched</b> out. The punched centre, known as the [...] "dump", was valued at 15 pence, and the outer rim, known as the [...] "holey dollar", was worth five shillings. This was indicated by over-stamping the two new coins. The obverse of the holey dollar was stamped the words [...] "New South Wales" [...] and the date, 1813, and the reverse with the words [...] "five shillings". The obverse of the dump was stamped with a crown, the words [...] "New South Wales" [...] and the date, 1813, and the reverse with the words [...] "fifteen pence". The mutilated coins became the first official currency produced specifically for circulation in Australia. The expedient was relatively short lived. The British Parliament passed the Sterling Silver Money Act in 1825, which made British coins the only recognised form of currency and ended any legitimate use of the holey dollar and dump in the Australian colonies.|$|R
40|$|This study {{provides}} a survey report and an aggregation of collected materials, and examines problematic issues {{in relation to}} round copper coins with square holes excavated in Sakhalin. Between 2010 and 2012, three surveys were carried out on coins held by the Sakhalin State Regional Museum, the Municipal Regional Museum of Tymovskoye, the Municipal Regional Museum of Nogliki, the Poronaisk Region Museum, the Contemporary History Archives Center of Sakhalin and the Sakhalin State University Museum. Excavated coins were aggregated {{from the results of}} these surveys and archeological documents. For convenience, coins from China’s Tang and Ming dynasties were considered together as “medieval coins,” and those from the Qing dynasty and Kan’ei Tsuho (coins from Japan’s Kan’ei era) as “early modern coins. ” Problematic issues were also examined. There was a total of 35 medieval coins. We can assume that these came by two routes : one from the Chinese mainland via the region round the lower reaches of the River Amur, and one from Japan via Hokkaido. Noteworthy among the medieval coins is the fact that of the 35 coins, 14 (40. 0 per cent) were large size coins. Such large size coins also tended to be relatively frequent (22. 7 per cent) in the Russian maritime provinces, indicating that the less a region had been affected by the monetary economy, the higher the proportion of large coins. This seems to be because in Sakhalin, coins were not used as money but as ornaments, hence larger ones were more popular. One vestige which led to the conjecture that the coins were used as ornaments is the presence of a punched hole {{near the edge of the}} coin. All five large Taihe Zhongbao coins of the Jin dynasty had such holes punched in them making it clear that they were used as ornaments. Furthermore, large <b>coins</b> with <b>punched</b> holes have also been found in Hokkaido. This indicates that these coins may have come from Sakhalin. Turning to early modern coins, 190 coins from the Qing dynasty and 15 Kan’ei Tsuho were discovered. Their respective distributions make clear that Qing coins were brought to Sakhalin from the lower reaches of the River Amur while Kan’ei Tsuho were brought from Hokkaido. The mint is stamped on the reverse side of Qing coins showing where the coins were minted. An analysis of these revealed that 90 per cent were issued in the capital, Beijing. This tells us that Sakhalin people obtained Qing coins from government officials (from Beijing) visiting Qing’s branch office downstream on the River Amur when the Sakhalin people called in for tribute or trading purposes. Punched holes were seen in 72. 1 per cent of Qing dynasty coins. This shows that, like medieval coins, these were used as ornaments. Since these coins were distributed mainly in the north of Sakhalin, this suggests that people in the area of Nivkh (Gilyak) probably sewed them onto their clothes. On the other hand, no holes had been punched in Kan’ei Tsuho coins. The presence of these coins in the south of the island suggests that they were used by the Ainu of Karafuto (Sakhalin). It is likely that the Ainu used the coins as necklaces or clasps by passing a string through the square hole in the centre so that there was no need to punch a hole and no traces of processing are visible. 2013 年 7 月 1 日改...|$|R
