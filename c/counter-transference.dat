I used the EPR (Embodiment, Projection, and Role) and the Creative Expressive Model as drama therapy methods during the sessions. These methods not only provided the children with safety and distance but also enabled them to disclose their feelings and become empowered.

After a brief reflexion on the symptom, from a semiologic and diagnostic point of view, and {{an overview of the}} psychodynamic, systemic and cognitive-behavioral models, we will examine the ingredients that nourish the integrative therapeutic work at the day hospital. Through clinical vignettes, we will describe the work of our institution by highlighting elements related to the concepts of institutional psychotherapy, setting, individual and group transferences and <b>counter-transferences,</b> holding, maternal and paternal functions, intrasubjective and intersubjective reality, object-shoring, and psychological envelope. We will present a particular therapeutic activity called "My Key" by looking at the work of symbolization carried out at the hospital, as well as the notions of the malleable medium and the transitional object. We will see how the day hospital, as an area of care within the scope of a temporal discontinuity, enables psychic continuity and opens the road to the subject’s recovery. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Esta pesquisa pretendeu abordar a relação que o psicanalista estabelece com as teorias psicanalíticas existentes para dar conta do que ocorre na clínica. Partindo do princípio de quea teoria psicanalítica possui a especificidade de se fundamentar na análise pessoal de quem a cria e de quem a lê, não é possível classificá-la dentro das disciplinas científicas clássicas, nem das hermenêuticas. Essa especificidade cria problemas para a sua transmissão, pois supõe o atravessamento de transferências e contratransferências que o psicanalista estabelece com seus pacientes, com seus pares e com as teorias que estuda. Esta dissertação consta de dois ensaios. O primeiro aborda a história do movimento psicanalítico e as modificações ocorridas em suas instituições de modo a se aproximarem da radicalidade teórica da psicanálise. Neste ensaio alguns conceitos são fundamentais, quais sejam, a transferência, a resistência que ela suscita, e a identidade clínica do psicanalista, fruto do trabalho com ambas. O segundo ensaio discorre sobre a trama própria da teoria psicanalítica e como esta se constrói a partir de metáforas que nunca abrangem completamente o fenômeno do inconsciente. A relação entre a teoria e a prática, ambas indissociáveis na psicanálise, também se torna presente neste texto, a partir de exemplos de como o psicanalista pensa enquanto teoriza ou clinica. This {{research}} {{focus on}} the relationship the psychoanalysis establishes with the existing psychoanalytical theories {{in order to deal}} with the events of clinical practice. Based on the principle that a psychoanalytical theory stems from the personal analysis of both its creator ant its reader, it is not possible to classify such theories neither under the classical fields of science, nor of hermeneutics. This specifity interferes in the transmission of these theories because it passes through transferences and <b>counter-transferences</b> that the psychoanalyst establishes with his patients, his colleagues, and with the theories themselves. This dissertation is composed of two essays. The first broaches the history of the psychoanalytical movement and the changes observed in psychoanalytical institutions bringing them closer to the roots and more daring aspects of psychoanalytical theory. Some concepts are essential to this essay: transference, the resistance it evokes, and the clinical identity of the psychoanalyst, which results from working with the former two. The second essay is about the fabric of psychoanalytical theory itself and how it is built from metaphors that never quite fully encompass the phenomena of the unconscious. The relationship between theory and practice, both non-dissociable in psychoanalysis, is also present in this text in the form of examples of how the psychoanalyst thinks when theorizing of during clinical practice...|$|R
50|$|According to Katya Bloom, Amerta Movement offers “a skill {{which can}} be glossed over in therapy {{training}} - how to practice making one’s own bodily experience more conscious as a resource, to sense oneself as a three-dimensional container, able to receive and reflect the transference, projective identification and <b>counter-transference</b> more fully”.|$|E
50|$|Modern analysts use the {{manifest}} content {{to understand the}} patient's unconscious. They attempt to understand the symbolism of {{the manifest}} content of the dream in relation to the total content of the session. During a session in which a patient describes a dream, everything that patient says and does after entering the therapist's office is considered an association to the dream and is used to untie its manifest content. The representatives of the modern psychoanalytic school are convinced that the patient's genetic history and unresolved conflicts are revealed in the transference and are symbolized in the patient's dreams. Because the patient is reporting the dream to the analyst, analysts believe that it is an indirect communication to the analyst about a major transference feeling. The modern psychoanalytic view underlined the importance of dreams in the analysis of transference and <b>counter-transference.</b> Dreams are viewed as representations of the psychoanalytic relationship and reflect transference <b>counter-transference</b> issues. This feature is very prominent in the approach adopted from the interpersonal school of psychology.|$|E
50|$|The {{developmental}} {{approach is}} primarily associated with Michael Fordham and his wife, Frieda Fordham. It {{can be considered}} a bridge between traditional Jungian analysis and Melanie Klein's object relations theory. Laings and Goodheart are also often mentioned. Samuels (1985) considers J. Redfearn, Richard Carvalho and himself (Andrew Samuels) as representatives of the developmental approach. Samuels notes how this approach differs from the classical by giving less emphasis to the Self and more emphasis to the development of personality; he also notes how, in terms of practice in therapy, it gives more attention to transference and <b>counter-transference</b> than either the classical or the archetypal approaches.|$|E
5000|$|The {{potential}} {{danger of the}} analyst's countertransference - 'In such cases the patient represents for the analyst an object of the past on to whom past feelings and wishes are projected' - became widely accepted in psychodynamic circles, both within and without the psychoanalytic mainstream. Thus, for example, Jung warned against 'cases of <b>counter-transference</b> when the analyst really cannot {{let go of the}} patient...both fall into the same dark hole of unconsciousness'. [...] Similarly Eric Berne stressed that 'Countertransference means that not only does the analyst {{play a role in the}} patient's script, but she plays a part in his...the result is the [...] "chaotic situation" [...] which analysts speak of'. [...] Again, Lacan acknowledged of the analyst's 'countertransference...if he is re-animated the game will proceed without anyone knowing who is leading'.|$|E
50|$|In 1934 Heimann became Melanie Klein's secretary. In 1935 {{they started}} working {{together}} on analysis and became close associates. She passed the state medical examination in Edinburgh in 1938. That year she {{became a member of}} the British Psychoanalytical Society with her lecture A contribution to the problem of sublimation. Her article On <b>counter-transference,</b> presented at the Psychoanalytical Congress in 1949 in Zurich, led to a rift with the Kleinian group of analysts because she presented a different view of the importance of countertransference. Melanie Klein saw it only as a problem of the therapeutic process. Paula Heimann, however, saw the emotional reaction of the therapist to their patient as an important tool for the exploration of the latter's unconscious. She then turned to the Independents group and was Margarete Mitscherlich's analyst during 1958-59. Alexander Mitscherlich also underwent training analysis with her.|$|E
50|$|The {{contemporary}} {{understanding of}} countertransference is thus generally to regard countertransference as a “jointly created” phenomenon between the treater and the patient. The patient pressures the treater through transference into {{playing a role}} congruent with the patient’s internal world. However, the specific dimensions of that role are colored by treater’s own personality. Countertransference can be a therapeutic tool when examined by the treater to sort out who is doing what, and the meaning behind those interpersonal roles (The differentiation of the object’s interpersonal world between self and other). Nothing in the new understanding alters of course the need for continuing awareness of the dangers in the narrow perspective - of 'serious risks of unresolved countertransference difficulties being acted out within what {{is meant to be}} a therapeutic relationship'; but 'from that point on, transference and <b>counter-transference</b> were looked upon as an inseparable couple..."total situation"'.|$|E

O objeto da pesquisa foi o manejo da contratransferência na clínica do sofrimento psíquico grave. Buscou-se, inicialmente, compreender a temática, segundo Freud e, em seguida, demonstrar a evolução do conceito e novas dimensões de compreendê-lo, destacando a questão acerca da postura do profissional, no decorrer de um processo psicoterapêutico. Relatou-se um processo de intervenção precoce em primeira crise do tipo psicótica para apresentar uma experiência possível deste manejo. Para auxiliar a compreensão desta intervenção, realizou-se uma discussão pontual a partir de alguns conceitos da teoria winnicottiana. Em seguida, apresenta-se os pressupostos da Reforma Psiquiátrica e a noção de clínica ampliada. As aproximações e diferenças entre estas áreas foram elaboradas, enfocando os objetivos desta clínica e o manejo da contratransferência como uma técnica privilegiada. Discutiu-se a clínica contemporânea, o atendimento a pessoas em sofrimento e os papéis do analista na relação terapêutica. Destacou-se a importância de pensar e utilizar a contratransferência na clínica da Reforma Psiquiátrica, como uma forma de integrar significados e sentidos na relação com o indivíduo em sofrimento psíquico grave. O encontro precede a intervenção e é intervenção, baseando-se no acolhimento e no cuidado, onde a presença do profissional é essencialmente terapêutica. ________________________________________________________________________________________ ABSTRACTThe main {{interest of}} this dissertation {{can be placed}} in the area of intersection of Early Intervention in Psychosis, the Psychiatric Reform and the concept of <b>counter-transference.</b> The interest of this research is the handling of the <b>counter-transference</b> in the clinic of the serious psychic suffering. Initially, it intends to understand the topic based upon Freud and then demonstrate the evolution of the concept and new dimensions and ways to understand it, with special attention to the matter of the professional posture, along the psychotherapic process. The dissertation recounts an early intervention in psychosis process to present an experience of a possible way of handling the <b>counter-transference</b> relation. To help understand such intervention, there is a focused discussion on the theory of Winnicott. Then, there is a presentation of the assumptions of the Psychiatric Reform and the idea of extended clinic. This is followed by a discussion of the similarities and the differences between these areas, with a focus on the goals of such clinic and the handling of the <b>counter-transference</b> as a fundamental technique. The contemporary clinic, the serious psychic suffering people‘s care and the roles of the analyst in the therapeutic relation is discussed. The importance of thinking and using the <b>counter-transference</b> in the Psychiatric Reform, as a way to integrate the significance and the meaning in the relation with the person in serious psychic suffering is emphasized. The encounter comes before the intervention and is in itself intervention, based on the receptiveness and on the care, in where the presence of the professional is, essentially, therapeutic...|$|E

Both {{patients and}} psychotherapists can experience strong emotional reactions towards {{each other in}} what are termed transference and countertransference within therapy. In {{the first part of}} this review, we discuss transference issues. Although not usually part of the obvious language of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), examina-tion of the cognitions related to the therapist, is an integral part of CBT, especially in working with difficult patients. In the second part, we cover <b>counter-transference</b> issues. We describe schematic issues that give rise to therapist <b>counter-transference</b> and explain how this interacts in different types of patient therapist encounter. We also examine ways in which the therapist can use CBT to help him/her modify the countertransference and, in the process, assist the patient. Methods.

40|$|Despite {{the salient}} {{presence}} of Jews {{in the history}} of psychoanalysis, literature on the subject of anti-Semitism in the clinical setting is sur-prisingly sparse. This paper attempts to comprehend the reasons for the dearth of literature on this important topic. A clinical section then breaks the silence surrounding expressions of anti-Semitism in the consulting room. The major focus is on transference and <b>counter-transference</b> reactions that arise with regard to anti-Semitism in the clinical setting. Since the first section is concerned with silence in the psychoanalytic community, its focus is primarily on <b>counter-transference</b> issues that may hinder the analyst's understanding and use of anti-Semitic material. The second, clinical section focuses on the ways both transference and countertransference reactions combine and influence one another and how they may, when properly attended to, serve as catalytic tools for advancing therapeutic goals.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{material}} is presented from supervision groups run for nurses and other mental health professionals. The patients {{presented to the}} group came from different mental health settings with a diagnosis that included borderline features and/or other disturbed states of mind. All of the patients described caused strong <b>counter-transference</b> feelings of sympathy, confusion, anger, hopelessness and guilt. Although these views were not expressed in formal ward rounds or recorded in clinical notes, evidence of their influence {{could be seen in}} the staff's attitude toward these patients. In supervision groups staff would either say that the patients were victims of mistreatment or they adopted a rather moralistic tone saying, 'the patient is attention-seeking', 'manipulative' or 'not mentally ill'. Psychoanalytic supervision which puts the transference and <b>counter-transference</b> relationship at the centre of practice can help staff to think about their feelings and digest {{them in a way that}} makes use of them as evidence rather than discarding them as purely subjective. It also helps to reduce the toxic effects of the patient's projections upon the clinician's mind and this in turn helps to reduce retaliatory or manic clinical decisions.
