40|$|Large {{shifts in}} {{domestic}} beef demand have had substantial {{impacts on the}} beef industry. Before the late 1970 s, growth in the U. S. economy and rising consumer incomes contributed to beef demand increasing for a sustained period. In response to growing product demand, the beef industry increased in size. However, starting about 1980, domestic retail beef demand weakened and subsequently declined every year through 1998. The long-run decline in retail beef demand contributed {{to a reduction in}} cattle industry size, particularly in relation to <b>competing</b> <b>meat</b> sectors such as poultry and pork. In 1999, following nearly 20 consecutive years of decline, domestic beef demand began to strengthen. From the late 1990 s through 2004, the all fresh domestic retail beef demand index increased from a low of 76 to a peak of 92, before weakening again from 2005 through 2008...|$|E
40|$|This study investigates whether {{food safety}} {{incidents}} involving beef, pork, and poultry, {{and the accompanying}} publicity have impacted United States meat demand. Beef demand is modeled {{as a function of}} beef prices, <b>competing</b> <b>meat</b> prices, meat expenditures, and food safety. Food safety indices are constructed separately for beef, pork, and poultry. Statistical tests reveal significant effects of food safety incidents on beef demand. The effect of an additional beef food safety incident on beef demand is negative, implying a detrimental impact on beef consumption. Spillover effects of pork and poultry safety incidents are positive and improve beef demand, revealing substitution away from pork and poultry towards beef. In other words, food safety incidents involving beef decrease beef demand and those involving pork or poultry increase beef demand. Overall, the demand responses to food safety incidents are small when compared to price effects and to previously reported estimates on health effects, such as information relating to beef and cholesterol...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{factors that}} have affected beef demand {{over the last two}} decades. Beef demand is typically modeled as a function of beef prices, <b>competing</b> <b>meat</b> prices, prices of all other goods, and consumer expenditures. Our comprehensive model also investigated the impact on beef demand of food safety issues, health concerns, and changes in consumer lifestyle and demographics. Results from this analysis help explain changes in beef demand that occurred during the 1980 s and 1990 s. First, consumer concerns about food safety, as measured by increases in beef recalls, had a negative impact on beef demand over the last two decades. Second, consumer awareness of the linkage between cholesterol and heart disease also contributed to the decline in beef demand. In contrast, as the net number of medical journal articles linking cholesterol and heart disease increased, poultry demand actually increased. Finally, increased labor force participation by females had a negative impact on beef demand, because an increase in female employment outside the home likely resulted in a decline in time available for food preparation. Because poultry demand benefitted from this consumer demographic shift and because of beef's negative health image, these results suggest that beef industry efforts to provide consumers with more convenient, high quality products have lagged behind those of the poultry industry...|$|E
40|$|Since 1976, {{the total}} supply of red {{meat and poultry}} has {{increased}} 63 %.

This was accomplished with approximately 28 million fewer cattle (100 M) than in 1976 (128 M). The entire reduction in cattle inventories is offset by an increase in average annual carcass weight. During the period 1990 - 1998, beef production increased 3. 1 billion pounds, pork increased 3. 7 billion pounds, chicken increased 9. 0 billion pounds and turkey increased 660 million pounds.

Key Words: beef cattle investment, decision support, expert systems. The development of sound tools that use economic theory to assist beef producers in making breeding cow investment decisions is an important effort. A major study focusing on competitive issues in the beef sector for the 1990 s, conducted through the Hubert H. Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs, pointed to this need (Johnson et al.).

40|$|Porcine {{epidemic}} diarrhea virus (PEDV), {{which first}} {{emerged in the}} United States in 2013, spread throughout the U. S. hog population. Limited preemptive knowledge impeded the understanding of PEDV introduction, spread, and prospective economic impacts in the United States. To assess these impacts, this article reviews the timeline of PEDV in the United States and the corresponding impacts. PEDV is a supply-impacting disease and is not demand inhibiting, as pork demand remained strong since PEDV first appeared. Pig losses reached significant levels during September 2013 through August 2014, {{with the majority of}} pork production impacts occurring in 2014. PEDV had differing impacts for subsectors of the pork industry. A budget model demonstrates that producers could have had pig losses and decreases in productivity proportionally smaller than price increases, resulting in net returns above what was expected before the major outbreak of PEDV. Previous literature is reviewed to identify the potential main industry beneficiaries of the PEDV outbreaks in the United States. As a result of reduced volumes of available pig and hog supplies, reductions in annual returns likely occurred for packers, processors, distributors, and retailers. In addition, pork consumers who experienced reduced-supply-induced pork-price increases were likely harmed directly by higher prices paid for pork and indirectly as prices of <b>competing</b> <b>meats</b> were also likely strengthened by PEDV. This article also identifies future considerations motivated by the appearance of PEDV in the United States, such as discussions of industry-wide efficiency and competitive advantage, the future role of PEDV vaccines, enhancement in biosecurity measures, and consumer perceptions of food safety and insecurity...|$|R
40|$|A {{historically}} low U. S. cattle inventory {{combined with}} record cattle prices create potential for herd expansion. Many in the livestock industry are discussing {{the need to}} restructure beef production and debating over what the correct strategy might be to sustain and continue building beef demand as the industry moves forward. Schroeder, Tonsor, and Mintert (2013) identified beef quality as an important and feasibly influenced driver of consumer beef demand. However, few studies have done research on beef demand disaggregated by quality type. The objective {{of this study is}} to provide empirical estimates of demand elasticities for beef quality types including USDA Prime, USDA Choice/Branded, and USDA Select beef by means of OLS regression procedures. This approach allows for comparison of these estimated elasticities to help determine the best production focus for the future of the beef industry. Estimation results show Prime beef to be the most own-price elastic (- 2. 33) which suggests a change in the Prime quantity supplied will elicit a smaller change in price premiums. Additionally, Select beef is found to be the most sensitive to changes in the prices of <b>competing</b> <b>meats.</b> Finally, a trend term suggest there are additional factors other than those explicitly included in the model that are increasing demand for higher quality beef which could have positive implications for the future of the beef industry.

Poultry, in particular, has seen its market share soar in recent years as per capita consumption boomed. Most analysts attribute the success of the poultry and pork industries to their ability to achieve a high degree of vertical coordination between different links in the production chain. In particular, vertical coordination has allowed them to become consumer-product driven industries while achieving significant cost reductions that have lowered retail prices. > Lamb and Beshear suggest that for the beef industry to recapture its lost market share it must become a consumer-driven industry. A critical step in the process is achieving a greater degree of vertical coordination across the production chain. Vertical coordination in beef production may take many different forms. In fact, three alternative forms of vertical coordination in the beef industry seem possible, from modest changes in how beef is priced, to marketing cooperatives and producer alliances, to the most radical change full vertical integration of beef production. Which path of change the industry will follow is unclear, but marketing cooperatives appear to offer the best chance for the industry to recapture market share. Animal industry...|$|R

40|$|The New Zealand Deer Industry {{experienced}} {{no apparent}} animal productivity {{gains in the}} decade leading up to 2004 while the <b>competing</b> red <b>meat</b> sectors increased productivity significantly. Compounding this issue for the deer industry was {{the expansion of the}} dairy industry that increased competition between the red meat sectors for a reducing land resource. A Deer Industry initiative proposed some industry targets in 2012 to improve on-farm productivity with an initial timeframe of 10 years. This farm system analysis compares deer enterprises against <b>competing</b> red <b>meat</b> enterprises for productivity and profitability using a farm system optimisation model. The impact of the current animal genetic gain, industry targets and alternative feed profiles on the productivity and profitability of a number of red meat enterprises around New Zealand are investigated independently using current and future predicted animal productivity levels. Current animal genetic gain for sheep and deer is predicted to increase productivity at a similar rate into the future allowing both industries to remain competitive but more profitable than they are at present. Total animal numbers will decrease in the future due to an increase in animal productivity with a fixed feed supply although total product sold will increase. The Deer Industry targets were compared against genetic gain for sheep and beef and have a similar affect in general on productivity and profitability as the current predicted genetic trends. The target of a 65 kg carcass limited the profitability of the deer enterprises but when this target was removed profitability increased significantly with the optimal carcass weight being between 59 - 60 kg’s. Using alternative feed supplies significantly increased profitability through increasing animal numbers and consequently product sold. The use of lucerne on the intensive land was at or near the maximum allowable limit suggesting that in some situations more lucerne would still be beneficial to the system if topography allowed cultivation. The use of nitrogen on the extensive land was also frequent. The future for the Deer Industry looks promising assuming that market schedules and pricing are stable and close to the current five year average used for this analysis. The current predictions indicate that an increase in the amount of product sold will occur despite a decrease in total deer numbers due to an increase in carcass weight. There is potential for further expansion in the number of deer on-farm with the use of alternative feed profiles but the markets will need to remain stable and be able to cope with an increase in product if this is to occur...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the effect of region (Qua-Qua, Maria Moroka, Sandveld and Tussen die Riviere) and gender on carcass characteristics and chemical composition of meat from the red hartebeest. The parameters measured on 29 red hartebeest included body weight, carcass weight, dressing percentage, proximate composition, fatty acid, cholesterol, amino acid and mineral content. The average carcass weight of males (79. 3 kg) was significantly higher than that of females (56. 0 kg); however, there was no difference in dressing percentages. The animals obtained from the Qua-Qua region had the highest lipid content (1. 3 g/ 100 g meat sample) compared to hartebeest sampled in other regions. Differences in concentrations of individual fatty acids, amino acids and minerals were minor and of no practical value. The ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acids (0. 78) is above the recommended 0. 7 and therefore has positive implications for human health. These nutrient values determined in meat from red hartebeest could be incorporated into human food composition tables.

40|$|Colombia {{negotiated}} bilateral Trade Agreements (TAs) {{with the}} United States {{and with the}} MERCOSUR region (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay). Colombian cattle and beef interest groups argue that TAs hurt the local beef supply chain. We employ a partial equilibrium framework {{to assess the impact}} of these TAs on the welfare of cattle producers, beef marketers and meat consumers in Colombia. Our results suggest that with free imports of chicken parts from the U. S, beef consumption and retail prices of beef both decrease and the derived demand and prices of fed cattle decrease. With beef imports from the MERCOSUR region, domestic beef prices and beef production fall, but total beef consumption increases. Overall, consumers are better off and there are net gains to society with free trade agreements. These net gains tend to increase over time, as Colombia gradually decreases the tariff for imported beef. We identify the reduction in marginal costs required to compete with imported beef, primarily from MERCOSUR.

40|$|U. S. {{participation}} in trade liberalization agreements with Canada and Mexico through the Canada–U. S. Free Trade Agreement (CFTA) and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) has generated intense debates in agricultural sectors {{about the benefits}} and costs of those agreements. The CFTA and NAFTA mandate that live cattle and beef trade among Canada, Mexico, and the United States be based upon competitive factors and include legal safeguards to deal with arbitrary trade restrictions. Nominal and real U. S. fed and feeder cattle prices declined throughout the 1990 s. Over the same period, the total U. S. beef supply increased from 25 billion pounds to 28. 5 billion pounds. Imports (both beef and beef obtained from live cattle) accounted for almost 0. 5 billion pounds, about 14 percent, of this increase. Thus, most of the supply increase has resulted from increased domestic production. This supply increase has occurred even though total cattle inventories have steadily declined since the mid- 1970 s. Most of the increase is explained by increased productivity of the U. S. beef cow breeding herd—caused by factors such as improved genetics, management, and feeding programs. Consequently, actual U. S. beef production remains relatively large even as cattle and calf inventories have declined. U. S. cattle and beef imports from Canada have increased substantially since 1988. Expansion of Canadian slaughtering capacity has not kept pace with {{the expansion of the}} Canadian cattle finishing industry. Given that the United States has excess slaughtering capacity and a larger consumer demand for high-quality and ground beef compared to Canada, fed cattle imports from Canada have increased. While beef and cattle imports from Canada have expanded throughout the 1990 s, total beef imports from all sources have increased only slightly. Canada's share of U. S. beef supplies increased by slightly over 3 percentage points during the 1990 s. As a consequence, of the $ 8 /cwt decline in slaughter price during this period, about $ 0. 35 /cwt was attributable to increased Canadian imports or about 4. 4 percent of the price reduction. For a 1, 200 -pound fed steer, this amounts to about $ 4. 20 per head. In addition, 1998 cattle and beef net imports from Canada were similar to 1997 levels. Although Canadian beef and cattle exports to the United States certainly put downward pressure on cattle prices, these exports were responsible for {{only a small portion of}} the 1998 decline in U. S. cattle prices. Rather, the combination of low feed prices, which encouraged unusually heavy average dressed weights, large supplies of <b>competing</b> <b>meats,</b> a flat market for high-quality U. S. beef exports, and a significant reduction in by-product values in Asian countries contributed to the 1998 price woes. Producers have recently expressed concerns regarding the method in which the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) reports U. S. beef production levels. Prior to the mid- 1980 s almost all U. S. live cattle imports were feeder cattle. The USDA's definition of U. S. beef production was reasonable given that most of the meat being added to imported feeder cattle was actually being produced in U. S. feedlots. However, because of increased fed cattle imports from Canada, it is important that analysts continue to recognize and account for USDA's definitions of beef production and imports. Perhaps increased fed cattle imports provide a rationale for altering data reporting methods to more accurately account for imports. Nonetheless, the current reporting system does not prohibit appropriate analyses of the impacts of trade on U. S. cattle and beef prices. U. S. cattle producers operate in a commodity marketing system that is highly competitive. Increased prices cause increased production from both domestic and foreign sources—which, in turn, eventually depresses prices. Because of such supply responses, a competitive industry will not experience sustained price levels in excess of long-term average costs (which include a normal rate of return). Therefore, industry participants must continually work at expanding both domestic and foreign markets, developing new products, improving product quality, and lowering production and marketing costs. cattle imports, beef exports, cattle prices, Demand and Price Analysis, Q 0,...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} years, {{in the north}} of Tuscany along the Apennine ridge, mainly in Pistoia, Prato and Florence districts, it is {{recording}} an increase of red deer number and, therefore, an increasing quantity of derived meat. It is well known that, generally, venison contains less fat than traditional red meats, satisfying consumer demand for lean meat, but less are the knowledge about meat fatty acid profile. Therefore, from the carcasses of ten stags, shot during the last 2009 - 2010 hunting season at an age of 18 - 20 months, ten samples of longissimus lumborum were excised at the level of 7 th- 8 th ribs to determine pHu values (pHmeter Hanna pH 211) and fatty acid profile (by gas-chromatography after Folch extraction). pHu values are normal (5. 7 - 5. 8) indicating a good acidification of meat and no effect of stress due to hunting method. Meat fatty acid composition shows values similar to other authors on red deer: total saturated content (lauric, myristic, palmitic, margaric and stearic acids) is equal to 42. 08 %; total monounsaturated (myristoleic, palmitoleic, cis-heptadecanoic, oleic and cis-eicosenoic acids) is equal to 26. 04 %, while polyunsaturated ones (linoleic, α-linoleic, CLA, arachidonic, EPA, DPA, DHA) are equal to 31. 88 %.

40|$|The meat {{industry}} cannot {{respond to}} increases in demand by ever increasing resource use.

However, meat replacements manufactured from plant proteins and mycoproteins are currently the biggest competitors and are gaining a small percentage of the market. Manufactured meats may push conventional meat into the premium end of the market, and supply the bulk, cheap end of the market if conventional meat products become more expensive and the palatability and versatility of manufactured meats improve. In time the technology for other artificial meats such as meat from genetic modified organisms or cultured meat may become sufficiently developed for these products to enter the market with no complexity of the competition between meat products. Conventional meat producers can assimilate agroecology ecology concepts in order to develop sustainable animal production systems. The conventional meat industry can also benefit from assimilating biotechnologies such as cloning and genetic modification technologies, using the technology to adapt to the changing environment and respond to the increasing competition from artificial meats. Although it will depend at least partly on the evolution of conventional meat production, the future of artificial meat produced from stem cells appears uncertain at this time...|$|R
40|$|Mr Hayden Blades is an {{agricultural}} economist. As Executive Director of the Caribbean Agricultural Research and Development Institute (CARDI) he has instigated a major restructuring programme {{designed to make}} CARDI more responsive to the challenges currency facing Caribbean agriculture. The Caribbean is at a cross-roads {{in the development of}} its agriculture. Here, the agricultural system was set up specifically to produce primary products for sale in protected European markets. It was not until Independence that attention was turned to increasing the output of food crops for the domestic consumer. Even so, the domestic food sector remained a very much smaller component compared with plantation crops. This formula is not one to guarantee success or indeed survival in the future. The initiative to institute change has been taken {{out of the hands of}} Caribbean countries by the liberalization of international trade that has been sign-posted by the World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations. For the first time in history we are now seeing attempts to bring the trade in agricultural products within the confines of international trade rules. Indeed, even before the WTO Round was concluded members took the decision to liberalize trade in all tropical pro-ducts. Countries in the Caribbean region have been undergoing structural adjustment programmes, as have others elsewhere. Our programmes have included the necessity for the economic mobilization of our economies including the need to substantially reduce the protection previously afforded to agricultural crops both in terms of quantity restrictions and tariffs. This highly competitive situation, that has been so suddenly thrust on us, has resulted in the destruction of some of our domestic industries. For example, the poultry industry in Guyana collapsed within nine months of restrictions on imports being removed. Beef and lamb production from herds grazed under coconuts in Trinidad and Tobago cannot <b>compete</b> with <b>meat</b> landed in Port of Spain at subsidized prices from Europe. At this historical cross-roads we are going to have to institute a substantial transformation of our agricultural industries. We are going to have to move from a situation of fixed price markets for previously negotiated quantities, to a new era of new technologies to increase productivity so that we can market our commodities on an internationally competitive basis. In order to do this we will have to develop a new indigenous marketing industry, because we have no history or experience of marketing our products in the real sense of the term. In the past, quantities and prices were fixed and all that was left to arrange were transport and distribution. Now, we must conduct market research, identify niche markets, find new marketing partners, and create a whole new marketing infrastructure both physically and in terms of the people and skills required. We have to build a comprehensive market information system, and most critically of all, our producers must accept the challenge of producing a range of crops and products which are always going to be highly competitive in terms of price, quality and delivery. To service our farmers' new needs, extension services will have to change from their past emphasis on production to a new emphasis on marketing. This will require training and a change in mindset. How easily or readily will Caribbean agriculture change? Much will depend on the political commitment and priority accorded to agriculture in our countries and this will have a direct effect on farmer attitude and morale. To change production patterns and adopt new crops and techniques involves investment and risk; farmers will not accept the need for either without the support of good production and marketing advice and the confidence that they can be competitive. Precedents exist: Jamaica's Blue Mountain coffee has been branded and marketed successfully, and more recently, Belize has worked with the organization Fair Trade to develop a niche market for organically produced chocolate sold under the Black and Gold label. DEXIA, the Dominica Export and Import Information Agency, and the Agricultural Diversification Coordinating Unit for the OECS (Organization of Eastern Caribbean States) have experiences to share. The withdrawal of Geest from the Windward Islands banana trade now offers the opportunity for local initiatives. Some people still look to tourism, mining or industrialization as more attractive options for developing our Caribbean economies and all will contribute to a greater or lesser extent. However, agriculture will continue to underpin almost all our economies with some countries, such as Belize and Guyana, almost totally dependent. We have no choice in this matter. The Caribbean Heads of State, in their New vision for the Agricultural Sector, have accepted the need to develop agriculture on an internationally competitive basis: to develop appropriate human resources, and to negotiate a sensitive phasing out of currently protected markets and their replacement with viable alternatives. Our success will also depend on attracting some of our brightest young people to train for careers in agricultural production, marketing and advice. Throughout our history our people have met our challenges and I do not see why we should not do so again. we are probably in a better position now than ever before with the availability of better access to information and better educated and trained human resources. To forge an economically viable and environmentally sustainable agriculture to feed and provide income for our peoples is a major challenge but not an insurmountable one in my view.
