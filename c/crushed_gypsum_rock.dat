Disperse composition of crushed gypsum dust was analyzed; the analysis results are presented herein. Approximating function of particulate dust composition function is a piecewise function, defined as a three-tier spline “direct-parabola-hyperbole. ” The approximation aims at finding seven function factors and two nodal points. The least square method was used to estimate the unknown parameters of regression models for the sample data. To apply this method to experimental data, a program complex calculation models for the approximation of the integral representation of the mass distribution function of particles in the dust diameter in CAS Maple was presented. It defines a function that {{describes the}} distribution of the particulate composition of the dust released from the open warehouse storage of <b>crushed</b> <b>gypsum</b> <b>rock</b> with the smallest error...|$|E

40|$|The organisms of a bluish-green layer {{beneath the}} shards of a <b>gypsum</b> <b>rock</b> were {{characterized}} by molecular techniques. The cyanobacterial consortium consisted almost exclusively of Chroococcidiopsis spp. The organisms of the shards expressed nitrogenase activity (C 2 H 2 reduction) aerobically and in light. After a prolonged period of drought at the rock, the cells were inactive, but they resumed nitrogenase activity 2 to 3 days after the addition of water. In a suspension culture of Chroococcidiopsis sp. strain PCC 7203, C 2 H 2 reduction required microaerobic conditions and was strictly dependent on low light intensities. Sequencing of {{a segment of the}} nitrogenase reductase gene (nifH) indicated that Chroococcidiopsis possesses the alternative molybdenum nitrogenase 2, expressed in Anabaena variabilis only under reduced O 2 tensions, rather than the widespread, common molybdenum nitrogenase. The shards apparently provide microsites with reduced light intensities and reduced O 2 tension that allow N 2 fixation to proceed in the unicellular Chroococcidiopsis at the <b>gypsum</b> <b>rock,</b> unless the activity is due to minute amounts of other, very active cyanobacteria.

40|$|In the Secchia Valley {{spectacular}} sulphate outcrops (Burano Fm., Upper Triassic) {{are composed}} mostly of gypsum, anhydrite {{is a minor}} constituent. The apparent relative dissolution rates of <b>gypsum</b> and anhydrite <b>rocks</b> are variable and result in peculiar karstic features, which have not been reported in other evaporite deposits. Such differential solution phenomenon can be observed both on the fine scale, along outcrop surfaces, and also at the large scale, controlling drainage patterns of rock masses. These peculiar solution features are the gypsum and anhydrite protrusions and the hypogean bends (“anse ipogee”). Gypsum and anhydrite protrusions. Although anhydrite is less soluble than <b>gypsum,</b> anhydrite-bearing <b>rocks</b> show variable behaviours and may be affected by dissolution {{to a greater extent}} than the <b>gypsum</b> <b>rocks.</b> Fine-grained anhydrite layers and lenses, enclosed in <b>gypsum</b> <b>rocks,</b> protrude from the surrounding gypsum, whereas the coarse-grained anhydrite rocks are more depressed. This effect is due to the presence of gypsified rims on the coarse-grained anhydrite crystals. When running water flushes the <b>rocks,</b> <b>gypsum</b> in the rims dissolves faster than anhydrite. The partially gypsified coarse-grained anhydrite is more deeply attacked because the anhydrite crystals fall away from the rock surface or are carried away by the water as gypsum rims are removed. In layers where gypsification of the anhydrite crystals is negligible, and this is the case for the fine-grained variety, the anhydrite rocks are less attacked and form protrusions relative to the gypsum layers. Hypogean bends (“anse ipogee”). The karstic systems run only at a short distance from the surface, where gypsum is dominant. The expected presence of a larger amount of less soluble anhydrite in the core of the outcrops seems to prevent the development of karstic systems cutting across the sulphate masses. The karstic drainage is concentrated along joints parallel to the valley incisions, following release fractures developed as a consequence of the dramatic drop in internal rock pressure due to rapid valley-floor deepening. Because the Secchia Valley is characterized by small streams, almost orthogonally-oriented with respect to the main valley, the karstic systems may seem to flow uphill where they intercept the joints running parallel to the Secchia valley. This peculiar effect is related to the presence of alluvial and mud-slide deposits, which act as barriers and do not allow the direct down slope resurgence of the karstic waters...|$|R

40|$|Gypsum {{deposits}} are {{the currently}} exploited sulphate rocks with industrial purposes. In {{addition to the}} expensive drilling projects, geophysical techniques can be considered to estimate the economical potential of these deposits. An electrical resistivity tomography survey {{has been carried out}} in the Pira gypsum formation (SE of the Catalan margin of the Tertiary Ebro Basin, Spain). Additionally, a continuous coring drill was performed in order to support the study. Electrical imaging has been successfully applied to identify the gypsum deposits interlayered in lutite units. Nevertheless, the gypsum-lutite boundaries are diffuse and uncertain in the tomographic lines. Comparison of the cores of the borehole and the electrical response shows a meaningful correlation between electrical resistivity and purity of gypsum. The electrical resistivity tomography profiles display a rather wide range of electrical resistivity value (from 20 - 1000 Ωm) for the investigated gypsum facies. The highest values are attributed to sulphate layers with > 90 % of gypsum mineral. Lutite units display higher values than expected due to the presence of evaporite minerals within them (> 10 Ωm). Additionally, induced polarization measures have been performed in order to study the chargeability of gypsum deposits. It has been evidenced that impure <b>gypsum</b> <b>rocks</b> (with important presence of lutites within) are slightly chargeable. This property has allowed distinguishing between lutite levels and clay-rich <b>gypsum</b> <b>rocks.</b> Electrical resistivity tomography lines are useful in the prospection of gypsum deposits.
