Therefore, to properly compare these quantities across airlines (or even across the same airline for two different periods if the airline's average stage length has changed significantly) requires settling on a common assumed stage length and then adjusting CASM, RASM and yield appropriately.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedWith continued {{erosion of the}} DoD budgetary strength, {{it is imperative that}} commanders become knowledgeable about the cost to operate major weapon systems. This thesis examines the cost to operate the Light Armored Vehicle (LAV) per mile driven. The central objective {{of this study was to}} establish a framework for analyzing the applicable LAV cost drivers so as to derive a total operational cost per mile driven. To address this issue, research of relevant cost data as well as field research and interviews were conducted. The research and interviews obtained information about major <b>cost</b> <b>categories</b> associated with LAV operations, whether those <b>cost</b> <b>categories</b> should be estimated as direct or indirect costs and the proper allocation method for indirect costs. The major findings resulted in two alternative costing models which estimate the operational cost for the LAV family of vehicles as well as for the individual LAV variants based on a full costing approach and a material costing approach. Once defined, direct <b>cost</b> <b>categories</b> were allocated based on miles driven and indirect <b>costs</b> <b>categories</b> were allocated based on the percentage of vehicles by variant as compared to the LAV totals[URL] United States Marine Corp...|$|R

5000|$|Certain {{elements}} of IFRS 9 as issued were criticized by some key IASB constituents. The model for classifying debt instrument assets permitted only two approaches, fair value with all changes in fair value reported in {{profit and loss}} (FVPL), or amortized cost. [...] This represented a significant deviation from FASB decisions, which would also have a category of fair value with certain changes in fair value reported in other comprehensive income (FVOCI). [...] In addition to creating significant divergence with FASB, {{the lack of a}} FVOCI category would have been inconsistent with the accounting model being developed by the IASB for insurance contracts. [...] There were also concerns that the criteria for qualifying for the amortized <b>cost</b> <b>category</b> were overly stringent and would force many financial instruments to be reported at fair value even though they could be appropriately accounted for at amortized cost. [...] To address these concerns, IASB issued an exposure draft in 2012 proposing limited amendments to the classification and measurement of financial instruments.|$|E
5000|$|According to the World Nuclear Association, [...] "the world's present {{measured}} {{resources of}} uranium (5.7 Mt) in the <b>cost</b> <b>category</b> {{less than three}} times present spot prices and used only in conventional reactors, are enough to last for about 90 years. This represents {{a higher level of}} assured resources than is normal for most minerals. Further exploration and higher prices will certainly, on the basis of present geological knowledge, yield further resources as present ones are used up." [...] The amount of uranium present in all currently known conventional reserves alone (excluding the huge quantities of currently-uneconomical uranium present in [...] "unconventional" [...] reserves such as phosphate/phosphorite deposits, seawater, and other sources) is enough to last over 200 years at current consumption rates. Fuel efficiency in conventional reactors has increased over time. Additionally, since 2000, 12-15% of world uranium requirements have been met by the dilution of highly enriched weapons-grade uranium from the decommissioning of nuclear weapons and related military stockpiles with depleted uranium, natural uranium, or partially-enriched uranium sources to produce low-enriched uranium for use in commercial power reactors. Similar efforts have been utilizing weapons-grade plutonium to produce mixed oxide (MOX) fuel, which is also produced from reprocessing used fuel. Other components of used fuel are currently less commonly utilized, but have a substantial capacity for reuse, especially so in next-generation fast neutron reactors. Over 35 European reactors are licensed to use MOX fuel, as well as Russian and American nuclear plants. Reprocessing of used fuel increases utilization by approximately 30%, while the widespread use of fast breeder reactors would allow for an increase of [...] "50-fold or more" [...] in utilization.|$|E

40|$|The broad {{objective}} of this thesis involves investigation of the role agriculture might play in a society wide greenhouse gas emissions reduction effort. Specifically, the breakeven price for carbon emission offsets is calculated for agriculturally based emission reducing practices. The practices investigated in the Texas High Plains involve reduced tillage use, reduced fallow use, reduced crop fertilization, cropland conversion to grassland, feedlot enteric fermentation management and digester based dairy manure handling. Costs of emission reductions were calculated at the producer level. The calculated offset prices are classified into four cost categories. They are: negative cost, low cost (less than $ 20 per ton of carbon saved), moderate cost ($ 20 through $ 100 per ton of carbon saved), and high cost (over $ 100 for tons of carbon saved). Negative cost implies that farmers could make money and reduce emissions by moving to alternative practices even without any carbon payments. Alternatives in the positive cost categories need compensation to induce farmers to switch to practices that sequester more carbon. All fallow dryland crop practices, dryland and irrigated cotton zero tillage, dryland and irrigated wheat zero tillage, irrigated corn zero tillage, cotton irrigated nitrogen use reduction under minimum tillage and dryland pasture for all systems, and anaerobic lagoon complete mix and plug flow systems fall in the negative <b>cost</b> <b>category.</b> Dryland and irrigated wheat under minimum tillage {{are found to be}} in the low <b>cost</b> <b>category.</b> Cotton dryland under minimum tillage and cotton irrigated with nitrogen use reduction under zero tillage fell into the moderate cost class. Both corn and cotton irrigated minimum tillage are found to be in the high <b>cost</b> <b>category.</b> This study only considers the producer foregone net income less fixed costs as the only cost incurred in switching to an alternative sequestering practice. More costs such as learning and risk should probably be included. This limitation along with other constraints such as use of short run budget data, lack of availability and reliability of local budgets, overlooking any market effects, and lack of treatment of costs incurred in selling carbon offsets to buyers are limitations and portend future work...|$|E
