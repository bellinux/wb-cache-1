500|$|The stereo {{version of}} the song has an organ moving from speaker to speaker; the effect is lost on the mono {{version of the}} song, where it simply gains an extra organ and guitar sound. However, the organ is very {{prominent}} during the first 50 seconds of the mono version—along with some special effects—but inaudible in the stereo mix until the improvised section. Five takes of the song were originally recorded on 27 February 1967, with a sixth later recorded on 16 March 1967, {{in an attempt to}} create a shorter version, with overdubs in June of that year, the Piper version also appears on the official compilation albums Relics and A Nice Pair. Despite Smith trying to bring the rest of the album's tracks from a jam-long length to something more manageable, Smith relented for [...] "Interstellar Overdrive", as Jenner recalled: [...] "It was definitely the deal that—hey, here you can do 'Interstellar Overdrive', you <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> like, you can do your weird shit. So 'Interstellar Overdrive' was the weird shit [...] [...] [...] and again, hats off to Norman for letting them do that." [...] A delay effect was created by producer Norman Smith by superimposing a second version of the song over a previous version. Smith played the drum roll on the song. After the drum roll, the opening riff is played with severe stereo panning.|$|E

[...] According to Schopenhauer, phenomena do not have free will. However, will [...] as noumenon is free.|$|E
2500|$|After recovering, Packer donated {{a large sum}} to the Ambulance Service of New South Wales to pay for {{equipping}} all NSW ambulances with {{a portable}} defibrillator (now colloquially known as [...] "Packer Whackers"). He told Nick Greiner [...] "I'll go you 50/50", and the NSW State government paid {{the other half of}} the cost. [...] In a press conference he later remarked on his temporary oblivion [...] "I've been to the other side and let me tell you, son, there's fucking nothing there...there's no one waiting there for you, there's no one to judge you so you <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> bloody well like".|$|E

2500|$|A Russian and an American are {{sentenced to}} Hell. The Devil summons them and says: [...] "Guys, you have 2 options: an American or Russian Hell. In the American one you <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> want, but you'll {{have to eat}} a bucket of shit every morning. The Russian one is the same, but it's 2 buckets." [...] The Yankee quickly makes up his mind and goes to American Hell, while the Russian {{eventually}} chooses the Russian one. In {{a week or so}} they meet. The Russian asks: [...] "So, what's it like out there?"/ [...] "Exactly what the devil said, the Hell itself is OK, but eating a bucket of shit is killing me. And you?" [...] / [...] "Ah, it feels just like home – either the shit doesn't get delivered or there aren't enough buckets for everyone!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Adam Ant {{approached}} Malcolm McLaren (the {{manager of}} The Sex Pistols) {{and asked him}} to manage the band. McLaren subsequently took the rest of the Ants from the original group when he introduced the singer Annabella Lwin and began the process of honing Bow Wow Wow for chart success. Later Adam seemed to have reconciled with the fact. [...] "I like to use the word 'mutiny'. My band was happy to go. Malcolm tried to see if I could fit into Bow Wow Wow, but I never could've or would've. I might have had a broken heart at the time, but Malcolm didn't leave me with nothing. [...] He mentored me. He said: 'Look, what do you want?' I said: 'I wanna sell millions of records', and he said, 'Well, you're going the wrong way about it. This [...] is the kind of esoteric stuff you do when you've done eight albums, you're living on a yacht, and you <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> want'," [...] he remembered later.|$|E
2500|$|The German {{government}} issued {{demands to}} France that it remain neutral {{as they had}} to decide which deployment plan to implement, it being difficult if not impossible to change the deployment whilst it was underway. The modified German Schlieffen Plan, Aufmarsch II West, would deploy 80% of the army in the west, and Aufmarsch I Ost and Aufmarsch II Ost would deploy 60% {{in the west and}} 40% in the east as this was the maximum that the East Prussian railway infrastructure could carry. The French did not respond, but sent a mixed message by ordering their troops to withdraw [...] from the border to avoid any incidents, {{and at the same time}} ordered the mobilisation of her reserves. Germany responded by mobilising its own reserves and implementing Aufmarsch II West. On 1 August Wilhelm ordered General Moltke to [...] "march the whole of the … army to the East" [...] after he had been wrongly informed that the British would remain neutral as long as France was not attacked. The General convinced the Kaiser that improvising the redeployment of a million men was unthinkable and that making it possible for the French to attack the Germans [...] "in the rear" [...] might prove disastrous. Yet Wilhelm insisted that the German army should not march into Luxembourg until he received a telegram sent by his cousin George V, who made it clear that there had been a misunderstanding. Eventually the Kaiser told Molkte, [...] "Now you <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> want." [...] Germany attacked Luxembourg on 2 August, and on 3 August declared war on France. On 4 August, after Belgium refused to permit German troops to cross its borders into France, Germany declared war on Belgium as well. Britain declared war on Germany at 19:00UTC on 4 August 1914 (effective from 11 pm), following an [...] "unsatisfactory reply" [...] to the British ultimatum that Belgium must be kept neutral.|$|E

40|$|Increasingly, women {{simultaneously}} {{balance the}} roles of mother, parental carer and worker. However, individual role balance strategies among these working ‘sandwich’ generation women have not been thoroughly explored. Eighteen women combining these three roles were interviewed about their individual role balance strategies. Findings were identified through the framework analysis technique, underpinned by the Model of Juggling Occupations. Achieving and maintaining role balance was explained as a complex process accomplished through a range of strategies. Findings revealed the women used six within-role balance strategies: living with integrity, being the best <b>you</b> <b>can,</b> <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> love, loving <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> remembering why and searching for signs of success. The women also described six between-role balance strategies: maintaining health and wellbeing, repressing perfectionism, managing time and energy, releasing responsibility, nurturing social connection and reciprocating. These findings {{provide a basis for}} health care providers to understand and potentially support working ‘sandwich’ generation women...|$|R
