This has led to speculation and further to the proposal that Pcdhs may provide a synaptic-address code for neuronal connectivity or a single-cell barcode for self-recognition/self-avoidance similar to that ascribed to DSCAM proteins of invertebrates. Although vertebrate DSCAMs lack the diversity of their invertebrate counterparts, the selective transcription of individual Pcdh isoforms {{can be achieved by}} promoter choice followed by alternative pre-mRNA <b>cis-splicing</b> thus increasing the number of possible combinations.|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} known for almost {{a decade and a half}} that in trypanosomes all mRNAs are trans-spliced by {{addition}} to the 5 ' end of the spliced leader (SL) sequence. During the same time period the conviction developed that classical <b>cis-splicing</b> introns are not present in the trypanosome genome and that the trypanosome gene arrangement is highly compact with small intergenic regions separating one gene from the next. We have now discovered that these tenets are no longer true. Poly(A) polymerase (PAP) genes in Trypanosoma brucei and Trypanosoma cruzi are split by intervening sequences of 653 and 302 nt, respectively. The intervening sequences occur at identical positions in both organisms and obey the GT/AG rule of <b>cis-splicing</b> introns. PAP mRNAs are trans-spliced at the very 5 ' end as well as internally at the 3 ' splice site of the intervening sequence. Interestingly, 11 nucleotide positions past the actual 5 ' splice site are conserved between the T. bruceiand T. cruzi introns. Point mutations in these conserved positions, as well as in the AG dinucleotide of the 3 ' splice site, abolish intron removal in vivo. Our results, together with the recent discovery of <b>cis-splicing</b> introns in Euglena gracilis, suggest that both trans- and <b>cis-splicing</b> are ancient acquisitions of the eukaryotic cell...|$|E
40|$|The chloroplasts of Euglena {{gracilis}} {{bounded by}} three membranes arose via secondary endosymbiosis {{of a green}} alga in a heterotrophic euglenozoan host. Many genes were transferred from symbiont to the host nucleus. A subset of Euglena nuclear genes of predominately symbiont, but also host, or other origin have obtained complex presequences required for chloroplast targeting. This study has revealed the presence of short introns (41 – 93 bp) either {{in the second half}} of presequence-encoding regions or shortly downstream of them in nine nucleus-encoded E. gracilis genes for chloroplast proteins (Eno 29, GapA, PetA, PetF, PetJ, PsaF, PsbM, PsbO, and PsbW). In addition, the E. gracilis Pbgd gene contains two introns {{in the second half of}} presequence-encoding region and one at the border of presequence-mature peptide-encoding region. Ten of 12 introns present within presequence-encoding regions or shortly downstream of them identified in this study have typical eukaryotic GT/AG borders, are T-rich, 45 – 50 bp long, and pairwise sequence identities range from 27 to 61 %. Thus single recombination events might have been mediated via these <b>cis-spliced</b> introns. A double crossing over between these <b>cis-spliced</b> introns and trans-spliced introns present in 5 ′-UTRs of Euglena nuclear genes is also likely to have occurred. Thus introns and exon-shuffling could have had an important role in the acquisition of chloroplast targeting signals in E. gracilis. The results are consistent with a late origin of photosynthetic euglenids...|$|R
40|$|Organelle {{genes are}} often {{interrupted}} by group I and or group II introns. Splicing of these mobile genetic {{occurs at the}} RNA level via serial transesterification steps catalyzed by the introns’own tertiary structures and, sometimes, {{with the help of}} external factors. These catalytic ribozymes can be found in cis or trans configuration, and although trans-arrayed group II introns have been known for decades, trans-spliced group I introns have been reported only recently. In the course of sequencing the complete mitochondrial genome of the prasinophyte picoplanktonic green alga Prasinoderma coloniale CCMP 1220 (Prasinococcales, clade VI), we uncovered two additional cases of trans-spliced group I introns. Here, we describe these introns and compare the 54, 546 bp-long mitochondrial genome of Prasinoderma with those of four other prasinophytes (clades II, III and V). This comparison underscores the highly variable mitochondrial genome architecture in these ancient chlorophyte lineages. Both Prasinoderma trans-spliced introns reside within the large subunit rRNA gene (rnl) at positions where <b>cis-spliced</b> relatives, often containing homing endonuclease genes, have been found in other organelles. In contrast, all previously reported trans-spliced group I introns occur in different mitochondrial genes (rns or coxI). Each Prasinoderma intron is fragmented into two pieces, forming at the RNA level a secondary structure that resembles those of its <b>cis-spliced</b> counterparts. As observed for other trans-spliced group I introns, the breakpoint of the first intron maps to the variable loop L 8, whereas that of the second is uniquely located downstream of P 9. 1.

40|$|To {{cultivate}} {{the use of}} trans-splicing as a novel means to rapidly express various antibody fusion proteins, we tried to express antibody-reporter enzyme fusions in a COS- 1 co-transfection model. When a vector designed to induce trans-splicing with IgH pre-mRNA was co-transfected with a vector encoding the mouse IgM locus, the expression of VH-secreted human placental alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) as well as Fab-SEAP were successfully expressed both in mRNA and protein levels. Especially, the vectors encoding complementary sequence to Sμ as a binding domain was accurate and efficient, producing trans-spliced mRNA of up to 2 % of <b>cis-spliced</b> one. Since Sµ sequence should exist in every IgH pre-mRNA, our finding {{will lead to the}} rapid production and analysis of various antibody-enzyme fusions suitable for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or antibody-dependent enzyme prodrug therapy (ADEPT) ...|$|R
40|$|A short 5 ' {{splice site}} RNA {{oligonucleotide}} (5 'SS RNA oligo) undergoes both steps of splicing when a second RNA containing the 3 ' splice site region (3 'SS RNA) is added in trans. This trans-splicing reaction displays the same 5 ' and 3 ' splice site sequence requirements as <b>cis-splicing</b> of full-length pre-mRNA. The analysis of RNA-snRNP complexes formed {{on each of}} the two splice site RNAs is consistent with the formation of partial complexes, which then associate to form the complete spliceosome. Specifically, U 2 snRNP bound to the 3 'SS RNA associates with U 4 /U 5 /U 6 snRNP bound to the 5 'SS RNA oligo. Thus, as expected, trans-splicing depends on the integrity of U 2, U 4, and U 6 snRNAs. However, unlike <b>cis-splicing,</b> trans-splicing is enhanced when the 5 ' end of U 1 snRNA is blocked or removed or when the U 1 snRNP is depleted. Thus, the early regulatory requirement for U 1 snRNP, which is essential in <b>cis-splicing,</b> is bypassed in this trans-splicing system. This simplified trans-splicing reaction offers a unique model system in which to study the mechanistic details of pre-mRNA splicing...|$|E
40|$|Trans-splicing {{has been}} used to repair mutant RNA {{transcripts}} via competition for the spliceosome using pre-trans-splicing molecules, or “PTMs. ” Previous studies have demonstrated that functional PTMs can be designed for either 3 ′- or 5 ′-exon replacement, with a vast majority of the work to date focusing on repair of mutations within internal exons and via 3 ′-exon replacement. Here, we describe the first use of trans-splicing to target the first exon and intron of a therapeutically relevant gene and repair the mutant RNA by 5 ′-exon replacement. Our results show that 5 ′-PTMs can be designed to repair mutations in the β-globin transcript involved in sickle cell anemia and β-thalassemia while providing insight into considerations for competition between trans- versus <b>cis-splicing</b> in mammalian cells. Target transcripts with impaired <b>cis-splicing</b> capabilities, like those produced in some forms of β-thalassemia, are more efficiently repaired via trans-splicing than targets in which <b>cis-splicing</b> is unaffected as with sickle β-globin. This study reveals desirable characteristics in substrate RNAs for trans-splicing therapeutics as well as provides an opportunity for further exploration into general splicing mechanisms via 5 ′-PTMs...|$|E
40|$|SR (ser/arg) {{proteins}} {{have been}} shown to play roles in numerous aspects of pre-mRNA splicing, including modulation of alternative splicing, commitment of substrates to the splicing pathway, and splice site communication. The last of these, splice site communication, is particularly relevant to trans-splicing in which the 5 ' and 3 ' exons originate on separate molecules. The participation of SR proteins in naturally occurring, spliced leader RNA-dependent transsplicing has not been examined. Here, we have isolated SR proteins from an organism that performs both trans- and <b>cis-splicing,</b> the nematode Ascaris lumbricoides. To examine their activity in in vitro splicing reactions, we have also developed and characterized an SR protein-depleted whole-cell extract. When tested in this extract, the nematode SR proteins are required for both trans- and <b>cis-splicing.</b> In addition, the state of phosphorylation of the nematode SR proteins is critical to their activity in vitro. Interestingly, mammalian (HeLa) and A. lumbricoides SR proteins exhibit equivalent activities in <b>cis-splicing,</b> while the nematode SR proteins are much more active in trans-splicing. Thus, it appears that SR proteins purified from an organism that naturally trans-splices its pre-mRNAs promote this reaction {{to a greater extent than}} do their mammalian counterparts...|$|E
40|$|SummarySpliceosomal introns are {{hallmarks}} of most eukaryotic genomes and are excised from premature mRNAs by a spliceosome that {{is among the}} largest, and most complex, molecular machine in cells [1]. The divergent unicellular eukaryote Giardia intestinalis, the causative agent of giardiasis, also possesses spliceosomes, but only four canonical (<b>cis-spliced)</b> introns {{have been identified in}} its genome to date [2 – 4]. We demonstrate that this organism has a novel form of spliceosome-mediated trans-splicing of split introns that is essential for generating mature mRNAs for at least two important genes: one encoding a heat shock protein 90 (HSP 90), which controls the conformation of a suite of cellular proteins [5], and the other encoding a dynein molecular motor protein, involved in the motility of eukaryotic flagella [6]. These split introns have properties that distinguish them from other trans-splicing systems known within eukaryotes, suggesting that Giardia independently evolved a unique system to splice split introns...|$|R
40|$|RNA editing is one {{of several}} post-transcriptional RNA processes. This process generates RNA and protein {{diversity}} in eukaryotes and results in specific amino acid substitutions, deletions, and changes in gene expression levels. It occurs in both plastids and mitochondria and typically involves the changing of specific C to U (cytosine to uracil). Welwitschia belongs to the gymnosperms (a group of seed-producing plants that includes conifers, cycads, Ginkgo, and Gnetales). It has already been substantiated that Welwitschia mirabilis has a major loss of <b>cis-spliced</b> introns and unusual trans-splicing introns. Research in the Mower lab has already proven that ancestral gymnosperm has high editing sites, from examining Ginkgo and Cycas. Knowing these high editing sites in other Gymnosperms, a prediction was made in Welwitschia mirabilis for a major loss of editing. In this study, we wished to evaluate the accuracy of this prediction. Data confirmed that RNA editing is very low in Welwitschia, and surprisingly, even lower than the predicted number. Within the 16 examined functional protein-coding genes in Welwitschia mitogenome, RNA editing sites were detected from only 5 of them...|$|R
40|$|We {{performed}} in silico PCR analyses utilizing complete mitochondrial (mtDNA) genome sequences of faba bean (Vicia faba) and two related species, Vigna angularis and Vigna radiata, currently available in GenBank, to infer whether 15 published universal primer pairs for amplification of all 14 <b>cis-spliced</b> introns in genes of NADH subunits (nad genes) {{are suitable for}} V. faba and related species. Then, we tested via PCR reactions whether seven out of 15 primer pairs would generate PCR products suitable for further manipulation in 16 genotypes of V. faba representing all botanical varieties of this species (major, minor, equina and subsp. paucijuga) of various levels of improvement (traditional and improved cultivars) originating from Europe, Africa, Asia and south America. We provide new PCR primers for amplification of nad 1 intron 2 / 3 in V. faba, and demonstrate intraspecific variability in primary nucleotide sequences at this locus. Based on outcomes of both in silico predictions and PCR amplification, we report a set of PCR primers for amplification of five introns in nad genes that are promising molecular tools for future phylogeographic and other studies in this species for which unambiguous data on wild ancestors, centre of origin and domestication are lacking.

40|$|The {{identical}} reaction pathway {{executed by}} the spliceosome and self-splicing group II intron ribozymes has prompted the idea that both may be derived from a common molecular ancestor. The minimal sequence and structural similarities between group II introns and the spliceosomal small nuclear RNAs, however, have left this proposal in question. Mechanistic comparisons between group II self-splicing introns and the spliceosome are therefore important in determining whether these two splicing machineries may be related. Here we show that 3 ′-sulfur substitution at the 5 ′ splice site of a group II intron causes a metal specificity switch during {{the first step of}} splicing. In contrast, 3 ′-sulfur substitution has no significant effect on the metal specificity of the second step of <b>cis-splicing.</b> Isolation of the second step uncovers a metal specificity switch that is masked during the <b>cis-splicing</b> reaction. These results demonstrate that group II intron ribozymes are metalloenzymes that use a catalytic metal ion for leaving group stabilization during both steps of self-splicing. Furthermore, because 3 ′-sulfur substitution of a spliceosomal intron has precisely the same effects as were observed during <b>cis-splicing</b> of the group II intron, these results provide striking parallels between the catalytic mechanisms employed by these two systems...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Gene fusion is {{a common}} event in cancer. The fusion RNA and protein {{products}} often play causal roles in tumorigenesis and therefore represent ideal diagnostic and therapeutic targets. Formerly, fusion chimeric products in cancer {{were thought to be}} produced solely by chromosomal translocation. Here, we show that a chimeric SLC 45 A 3 -ELK 4 RNA is generated in the absence of chromosomal rearrangement. We showed {{that it is not a}} product of RNA trans-splicing, but formed by <b>cis-splicing</b> of adjacent genes/read-through. The binding of CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) to the insulator sequences inversely correlates with the expression of the chimera transcript. The SLC 45 A 3 -ELK 4 fusion, but not wild-type, ELK 4 plays important roles in regulating cell growth in both androgen-dependent and-independent prostate cancer cells. The level of the chimeric transcript correlates with disease progression, with the highest levels in prostate cancer metastases. Our results suggest that gene fusions can arise from <b>cis-splicing</b> of adjacent genes without corre-sponding DNA changes. SIGNIFICANCE: With the absence of corresponding DNA rearrangement, chimeric fusion SLC 45 A 3 -ELK 4 transcript in prostate cancer cells is generated by <b>cis-splicing</b> of adjacent genes/gene read-through instead of trans-splicing.

Furthermore, we have isolated a small RNA from E. gracilis and propose, {{on the basis of}} primary and secondary structure comparisons, that it is a homolog of U 1 small nuclear RNA, an essential component of the cis-spliceosome in higher eukaryotes. Conserved sequences at the 5 &# 39; splice sites of the fibrillarin introns can potentially base pair with Euglena U 1 small nuclear RNA.

In land plants, however, {{it has been shown}} that all sequenced vascular plant chondromes lack large polycistronic operons while bryophyte chondromes have many of them. In this study, we provide the completely sequenced mitochondrial genome of a lycophyte, from Huperzia squarrosa, which is a member of the sister group to all other vascular plants. The genome, at a size of 413, 530 base pairs, contains 66 genes and 32 group II introns. In addition, it has 69 pseudogene fragments for 24 of the 40 protein- and rRNA-coding genes. It represents the most archaic form of mitochondrial genomes of all vascular plants. In particular, it has one large conserved gene cluster containing up to 10 ribosomal protein genes, which likely represents a polycistronic operon but has been disrupted and greatly reduced in the chondromes of other vascular plants. It also has the least rearranged gene order in comparison to the chondromes of other vascular plants. The genome is ancestral in vascular plants in several other aspects: the gene content resembling those of charophytes and most bryophytes, all introns being <b>cis-spliced,</b> a low level of RNA editing, and lack of foreign DNA of chloroplast or nuclear origin...|$|R

The 569, 630 -bp genome maps as a circle containing 58 identified genes encoding 33 known proteins, 3 ribosomal RNAs, and 21 tRNAs that recognize 14 amino acids. Among the 22 group II introns identified, 7 are trans-spliced. There are 121 open reading frames (ORFs) of at least 300 bp, only 3 of which exist in the mitochondrial genome of rice (Oryza sativa). In total, the identified mitochondrial genes, pseudogenes, ORFs, and <b>cis-spliced</b> introns extend over 127, 555 bp (22. 39 %) of the genome. Integrated plastid DNA accounts for an additional 25, 281 bp (4. 44 %) of the mitochondrial DNA, and phylogenetic analyses raise the possibility that copy correction with DNA from the plastid is an ongoing process. Although the genome contains six pairs of large repeats that cover 17. 35 % of the genome, small repeats (20 – 500 bp) account for only 5. 59 %, and transposable element sequences are extremely rare. MultiPip alignments show that maize mitochondrial DNA has little sequence similarity with other plant mitochondrial genomes, including that of rice, outside of the known functional genes.

40|$|Ubiquitin is a {{multifunctional}} 76 -amino-acid protein {{which plays}} critical roles in {{many aspects of}} cellular metabolism. In Caenorhabditis elegans, {{the major source of}} ubiquitin RNA is the polyubiquitin locus, UbiA. UbiA is transcribed as a polycistronic mRNA which contains 11 tandem repeats of ubiquitin sequence and possesses a 2 -amino-acid carboxy-terminal extension on the final repeat. The UbiA locus possesses several unusual features not seen in the ubiquitin genes of other organisms studied to date. Mature UbiA mRNA acquires a 22 -nucleotide leader sequence via a trans-splicing reaction involving a 100 -nucleotide splice leader RNA derived from a different chromosome. UbiA is also unique among known polyubiquitin genes in containing four <b>cis-spliced</b> introns within its coding sequence. Thus, UbiA is one of a small class of genes found in higher eucaryotes whose heterogeneous nuclear RNA undergoes both cis and trans splicing. The putative promoter region of UbiA contains a number of potential regulatory elements: (i) a cytosine-rich block, (ii) two sequences resembling the heat shock regulatory element, and (iii) a palindromic sequence with homology to the DNA-binding site of the mammalian steroid hormone receptor. The expression of the UbiA gene has been studied under various heat shock conditions and has been monitored during larval moulting and throughout the major stages of development.

Thereby, two identical viral transcripts are efficiently joined by homologous trans-splicing triggering {{the formation of a}} highly transforming 100 kDa super T antigen. Sequences of other viruses including HIV- 1 and the human adenovirus type 5 were reported to be involved in heterologous trans-splicing towards cellular or viral sequences but the meaning of these events remains unclear. We computationally and experimentally investigated molecular features associated with viral RNA trans-splicing and identified a common pattern: Viral RNA trans-splicing occurs between strong cryptic or regular viral splice sites and strong regular or cryptic splice sites of the trans-splice partner sequences. The majority of these splice sites are supported by exonic splice enhancers. Splice sites that could compete with the trans-splicing sites for <b>cis-splice</b> reactions are weaker or inexistent. Finally, {{all but one of the}} trans-splice reactions seem to be facilitated by one or more complementary binding domains of 11 to 16 nucleotides in length which, however occur with a statistical probability close to one for the given length of the involved sequences. The chimeric RNAs generated via heterologous viral RNA trans-splicing either did not lead to fusion proteins or led to proteins of unknown function. Our data suggest that distinct viral RNAs are highly susceptible to trans-splicing and that heterologous viral trans-splicing, unlike homologous SV 40 trans-splicing, represents a chance event...|$|R
40|$|The {{chloroplast}} genome of Euglena gracilis contains {{at least}} 155 introns, accounting for 39. 2 % of the genome. Among them are 88 group II introns of size 277 - 671 nucleotide (nt). Questions about {{the processing of}} these introns and their origin and spread in Euglena genera {{is the subject of}} this thesis. My working hypothesis is that the Euglena chloroplast genome evolved from an intron less ancestral genome by the invasion of mobile genetic elements relying in part on internally encoded enzyme activities for mobility. These internal enzymes may also be group II maturases. My research target was the largest intron in Euglena gracilis chloroplast, psbC intron 2 (4144 nt). I characterized psbC intron 2 as a <b>cis-spliced</b> group II intron encoding a 758 codon maturase-like protein (mat 2) that is interrupted by three additional group II introns. I also identified a putative RNA-binding domain (X), that relates to fungal mitochondrial group II intron maturases, and a reverse transcriptase (RT) domain, that has been found in other group II intron maturases and has been shown to have intron-translocation activity (Lazowska, 1994, Moran, 1995). In order to examine the distribution of mat 2, I characterized psbC intron 2 homologues from several species. I found that the mat 2 locus well conserved in most of the Euglena species tested, indicative of a deep root and important function of mat 2. Interestingly, the entire intron is absent in E. myxocylindracea. In order to investigate the effect of mat 2 loss, I analyzed group II intron content in E. myxocylindracea chloroplast genome. No group II introns have been identified in the genome. These data also provided evidence that mat 2 might be responsible for the acquisition and the processing of most of the group II introns in Euglena chloroplast. The activity of the mat 2 protein has been difficult to examine since the protein is hard to obtain.

40|$|The {{demarcation}} of protist kingdoms is reviewed, {{a complete}} revised classification {{down to the}} level of subclass is provided for the kingdoms Protozoa, Archezoa, and Chromista, and the phylogenetic basis of the revised classification is outlined. Removal of Archezoa because of their ancestral absence of mitochondria, peroxisomes, and Golgi dictyosomes makes the kingdom Protozoa much more homogeneous: they all either have mitochondria and peroxisomes or have secondarily lost them. Predominantly phagotrophic, Protozoa are distinguished from the mainly photosynthetic kingdom Chromista (Chlorarachniophyta, Cryptista, Heterokonta, and Haptophyta) by the absence of epiciliary retronemes (rigid thrust-reversing tubular ciliary hairs) and by the lack of two additional membranes outside their chloroplast envelopes. The kingdom Protozoa has two subkingdoms: Adictyozoa, without Golgi dictyosomes, containing only the phylum Percolozoa (flagellates and amoeboflagellates); and Dictyozoa, made up of 17 phyla with Golgi dictyosomes. Dictyozoa are divided into two branches: (i) Parabasalia, a single phylum with hydrogenosomes and 70 S ribosomes but no mitochondria, Golgi dictyosomes associated with striated roots, and a kinetid of four or five cilia; and (ii) Bikonta (16 unicellular or plasmodial phyla with mitochondria and bikinetids and in which Golgi dictyosomes are not associated with striated ciliary roots), which are divided into two infrakingdoms: Euglenozoa (flagellates with discoid mitochondrial cristae and trans-splicing of miniexons for all nuclear genes) and Neozoa (15 phyla of more advanced protozoa with tubular or flat [usually nondiscoid] mitochondrial cristae and <b>cis-spliced</b> spliceosomal introns). Neozoa are divided into seven parvkingdoms: (i) Ciliomyxa (three predominantly ciliated phyla with tubular mitochondrial cristae but no cortical alveoli, i. e., Opalozoa [flagellates with tubular cristae], Mycetozoa [slime molds], and Choanozoa [choanoflagellates, with flattened cristae]); (ii) Alveolata (three phyla with cortical alveoli and tubular mitochondrial cristae, i. e., Dinozoa [Dinoflagellata and Protalveolata], Apicomplexa, and Ciliophora); (iii) Neosarcodina (phyla Rhizopoda [lobose and filose amoebae] and Reticulosa [foraminifera; reticulopodial amoebae], usually with tubular cristae); (iv) Actinopoda (two phyla with axopodia: Heliozoa and Radiozoa [Radiolaria, Acantharia]); (v) Entamoebia (a single phylum of amoebae with no mitochondria, peroxisomes, hydrogenosomes, or cilia and with transient intranuclear centrosomes); (vi) Myxozoa (three endoparasitic phyla with multicellular spores, mitochondria, and no cilia: Myxosporidia, Haplosporidia, and Paramyxia); and (vii) Mesozoa (multicells with tubular mitochondrial cristae, included in Protozoa because, unlike animals, they lack collagenous connective tissue) ...|$|R

We have used this cell-free system and oligodeoxynucleotide directed RNase H digestion to assess the U small nuclear RNA requirements for nematode cis- and trans-splicing. These experiments indicated that both cis- and trans-splicing require intact U 2 and U 4 /U 6 small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (sn-RNPs). However, whereas <b>cis-splicing</b> displays the expected requirement for an intact U 1 snRNP, transsplicing is unaffected when- 90 % of U 1 snRNP is degraded. These results suggest that 5 ' splice site identification differs in nematode cis- and trans-splicing. identified in trypanosomes (1) suggesting that these snRNAs may not be required for trans-splicing. Nematodes carry out both cis- and trans-splicing and possess {{a full complement of}} spliceosomal snRNAs (9). However, the requirements for these snRNAs in cis- and trans-splicing have not been established. By analogy to trypanosomes, it has been proposed that trans-splicing in nematodes might not require a U 1 snRNP (10). Here, we have examined the U snRNA requirements for cis- and trans-splicing in a nematode whole cell extract. Both cis- and trans-splicing require intact U 2 and U 4 /U 6 snRNAs. Whereas <b>cis-splicing</b> is dramatically inhibited by degradation of U 1 snRNP, trans-splicing is unaffected by targeted destruction of U 1 snRNP...|$|E
40|$|Frontotemporal {{dementia}} with parkinsonism {{linked to}} chromosome 17 (FTDP- 17) {{is caused by}} mutations in the MAPT gene, encoding the tau protein that accumulates in intraneuronal lesions {{in a number of}} neurodegenerative diseases. Several FTDP- 17 mutations affect alternative splicing and result in excess exon 10 (E 10) inclusion in tau mRNA. RNA reprogramming using spliceosome-mediated RNA trans-splicing (SMaRT) could be a method of choice to correct aberrant E 10 splicing resulting from FTDP- 17 mutations. SMaRT creates a hybrid mRNA through a trans-splicing reaction between an endogenous target pre-mRNA and a pre-trans-splicing RNA molecule (PTM). However, FTDP- 17 mutations affect the strength of <b>cis-splicing</b> elements and could favor <b>cis-splicing</b> over trans-splicing. Excess E 10 inclusion in FTDP- 17 can be caused by intronic mutations destabilizing a stem-loop protecting the 5 ′ splice site at the E 10 /intron 10 junction. COS cells transfected with a minigene containing the intronic + 14 mutation produce exclusively E 10 + RNA. Generation of E 10 − RNA was restored after co-transfection with a PTM designed to exclude E 10. Similar results were obtained with a target containing the exonic N 279 K mutation which strengthens a splicing enhancer within E 10. Conversely, increase or decrease in E 10 content was achieved by trans-splicing from a target carrying the Δ 280 K mutation, which weakens the same splicing enhancer. Thus E 10 inclusion can be modulated by trans-splicing irrespective of the strength of the <b>cis-splicing</b> elements affected by FTDP- 17 mutations. In conclusion, RNA trans-splicing could provide the basis of therapeutic strategies for impaired alternative splicing caused by pathogenic mutations in cis-acting splicing elements...|$|E
40|$|Very {{closely related}} short {{sequences}} are {{present at the}} 5 ' end of cytoplasmic mRNAs in Euglena as evidenced by comparison of cDNA sequences and hybrid-arrested translation experiments. By cloning Euglena gracilis nuclear DNA and isolating the rbcS gene (encoding the small subunit of ribulose- 1, 5 -bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase), we {{have shown that the}} short leader sequence does not flank the nuclear gene sequence. The leader sequences were found to constitute the 5 ' extremities of a family of small RNAs. Sequencing six members of this family revealed a striking similarity to vertebrate U snRNAs. We propose that a trans-splicing mechanism transfers the spliced leader (SL) sequence from these small RNAs (SL RNAs) to pre-mature mRNAs. Transfer of leader sequences to mRNAs by trans-splicing has been shown only in trypanosomes where <b>cis-splicing</b> is unknown, and in nematodes where not more than 10 % of the mRNAs have leader sequences. Our results strongly suggest that Euglena is a unique organism in which both a widespread trans-splicing and a <b>cis-splicing</b> mechanism co-exist...|$|E
40|$|Heat shock {{proteins}} (Hsps) are a {{class of}} molecular chaperones which were first discovered as proteins up-regulated in response to heat stress in Drosophila. Later, {{it was found that}} these set of proteins get up-regulated as a general stress response associated with destabilization of native protein structures. Over a period of time, intricate involvement of Hsps in various biological processes has been well established. Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp 90) is one of the important representative of this class of proteins. Hsp 90 is an essential molecular chaperone which is evolutionarily conserved. It has a selective set of proteins to chaperone called as clients, which majorly include transcription factors and protein kinases. Through its interaction with its clients it modulates cell cycle, signal transduction, differentiation, development and evolution. Previous studies from Candida, Leishmania and Plasmodium have implicated Hsp 90 to be involved in stage transition and growth. It is also critically involved in regulating growth of other protozoans such as Dictyostelium, Entamoeba and Trypanosoma. Thus, selective inhibition of Hsp 90 has been explored as an intervention strategy against important human diseases such as cancer, malaria and other protozoan diseases. In Plasmodium falciparum, Hsp 90 plays a critical role in stage transition. The parasite inside the human RBC develops from ring to trophozoite to schizont stage and inhibition of Hsp 90 using specific pharmacological inhibitor arrests the growth of parasite at ring stage. In Dictyostelium, it has been observed that Hsp 90 function is required for development. Inhibition of Hsp 90 causes mound arrest and stops the cells from entering to its next developmental stage, fruiting bodies. In parallel, Hsp 90 in Candida {{has been shown to be}} involved in morphogenesis. In nature Candida exists as a single cell yeast form and upon entry into the human host these yeast forms undergo morphogenesis to form virulent filamentous fungi. Inhibition of Hsp 90 mimics temperature mediated morphogenesis. All together, these studies suggest that Hsp 90 functions in a context dependent manner and each biological system explored has given new insights into the Hsp 90 biology. Giardia lamblia, a protozoan parasite of humans and animals, is an important cause of diarrheal disease causing significant morbidity and also mortality in tropical countries. In the present study we focus on the biology of Hsp 90 from Giardia lamblia. Giardia has a biphasic life cycle with infective cyst stage and pathogenic trophozoite stage. These cysts are present in the environment and enter mammalian host through oral route. They undergo a process called as excystation in the intestine giving rise to trophozoites. The trophozoites so formed colonize the upper part of the small intestine which causes the symptoms of giardiasis. Some of the trophozoites escape from the nutrition rich milieu of the upper part of small intestine to the lower part. In this region, trophozoites undergo a process called as encystation, wherein each trophozoite forms a cyst which escapes through faeces back into the environment. As seen in the life cycle of Giardia there are two major biological transitions, excystation and encystation; and till date no definitive player or pathway is known to regulate these processes. With the knowledge of Hsp 90 playing an important role in similar biological transitions in other organisms we were encouraged to study role of Hsp 90 in Giardia lamblia. Trans-splicing based generation of a full length Hsp 90 in Giardia lamblia To understand the role of Hsp 90, we first carried out sequence alignment of Hsp 90 predicted ORFs in Giardia genome with yeast Hsp 90. On alignment we observed that Hsp 90 in Giardia is discontinuous and is annotated to be encoded by two different ORFs. Hsp 90 in most organisms is coded by a single ORF with none to many <b>cis-spliced</b> introns. In a relatively intron poor organism G. lamblia, cytosolic Hsp 90 is coded by two different ORFs separated by 777 kb in the genome. On multiple sequence alignment, we noticed that these two ORFs correspond to two independent regions of the Hsp 90 protein. The ORFs are designated as hspN and hspC, containing the N-terminal and the C-terminal region of the protein respectively. We began our study by sequencing whole genome of Giardia lamblia clinical strain. Our genome sequencing confirmed the split nature of hsp 90 and showed high ‘synteny’ between the other sequenced isolates. Using PCR based approach we have ruled out the possibility of having a full length gene in the genome. In contradiction to the genome result, we have observed a higher molecular weight protein in the lysate on proteomic analysis which was further confirmed by western blotting. The protein was observed to have a molecular weight of 80 kDa which could be a resultant of combination of two ORFs, suggesting the presence of a full length mRNA for Hsp 90. PCR amplification using primers against both the fragments resulted in amplification of 2. 1 kb product from the RNA pool of Giardia. Sequencing of this product showed that hspN and hspC were stitched together to form a mature messenger for full length Hsp 90. In total our results suggest a post transcriptional process, trans-splicing, to be involved in the construction of Hsp 90. The transition marked by this fusion coincides with the canonical GU¬AG splice site transitions as observed in other eukaryotes. Interestingly, a 26 nt near-complementary region was observed inside and upstream of hspN and hspC ORFs respectively. Put together these results suggest that the 26 nt complementary region acts as the positioning element to bring these two precursors in spatial proximity. With efficient spliceosomal activity these two precursor forms are trans-spliced to generate a full length cytosolic Hsp 90 in Giardia. There are only four genes which have <b>cis-spliced</b> introns in the Giardia genome and the core components of the spliceosomal machinery are also present. The presence of canonical splice site in both the transcripts suggests that these transcripts are fused together by the spliceosomal machinery by the phenomenon of trans-splicing. The formation of full length Hsp 90 RNA by its fragmented gene is the first example of trans-splicing in Giardia. To understand, are there any other genes which are also similarly trans-spliced we have carried out shotgun proteomic analysis of the total cell lysate obtained from Giardia trophozoites. Using Hsp 90 as template, in our proteomic datasets, we have designed an algorithm for identification of additional trans-spliced gene products at the protein level. We have identified a total of 476 proteins of which hypothetical proteins constitute the major class followed by metabolic enzymes. We have compared the theoretical molecular weights for the identified proteins with the experimentally determined mass. Any discrepancy in the molecular mass was further analyzed and we assigned a gene to be potentially trans-spliced based on three criteria: if they were encoded by two or more different ORFs (loci), absence of a single full length counterpart and presence of splice sites with branch point and positional elements. Using this algorithm we were able to identify dynein as a potential candidate of trans-splicing reaction which was confirmed by the nucleotide sequence analysis of the predicted ORFs. Interestingly, dynein gene fragments were observed to be scattered on different chromosomes with minor splice sites unlike hsp 90 genes. In vivo Expression of Hsp 90 sub-fragments, HspN and HspC In the mature Hsp 90 mRNA formed upon trans-splicing, 33 additional codons are present right between hspN and hspC sequences and they were acquired from the upstream region of hspC ORF. The 33 codons encode for an important region of Hsp 90 which harbours the conserved catalytic “Arg” residue; suggesting that the full length Giardia Hsp 90 (GlHsp 90) formed could be an active ATPase. To confirm the same we have carried out in vitro characterization of trans-spliced Hsp 90. Towards this, we have cloned, expressed and purified His tag-GlHsp 90. As a first step, highly purified protein was used to assess its efficiency in binding to it cognate ligand, ATP, and the known inhibitors. Our binding studies show that GlHsp 90 binds to ATP with a dissociation constant of 628 M and to its inhibitors, GA and 17 AAG with 1. 5 μM and 17. 5 μM respectively. The bound ATP will be subsequently cleaved by Hsp 90 which is an essential step in the chaperone cycle. As determined in our ATPase assay we observed that GlHsp 90 hydrolyzes bound ATP with the catalytic efficiency of 4. 4 × 10 - 5 μM- 1. min- 1 which confirms that Hsp 90 generated upon trans-splicing is an active ATPase. The uniqueness of the hsp 90 gene arrangement in Giardia posed a new question. Do these gene fragments also get translated? Our results suggest that HspN and HspC are poly¬adenylated. In order to determine the levels of these transcripts we performed qRT-PCR using primers specific to HspN, HspC and GlHsp 90. We have observed that, in comparison with HspN transcript level, HspC and GlHsp 90 transcripts are 15 and 75 folds higher respectively. To check for the presence of translation products of these transcripts, we have re-analyzed our proteomic datasets wherein we could identify peptides corresponding to HspN and HspC in their respective molecular weight region, 45 to 35 kDa. To confirm the proteomic data, western blot analysis was performed for trophozoite lysate on both 1 D and 2 D gels using anti-HspN antibody. Two specific bands (1 D) / spots (2 D) corresponding to the full length Hsp 90 and HspN were identified. Gel filtration analysis revealed that HspN co¬eluted with full length Hsp 90 thereby suggesting that both the proteins are in a same complex. With the background that HspN and HspC are present at the protein level, we asked if these fragments in combination can hydrolyse ATP. We reconstituted recombinant HspN and HspC in equimolar amounts and scored for the hydrolysis of ATP. However, no Pi release was observed. To determine whether HspN and HspC could modulate Hsp 90 function, ATPase activity was monitored in the presence of HspN or HspC, in vitro. It was observed that ATPase activity was inhibited by both the fragments thus suggesting that HspN and HspC negatively regulate Hsp 90 ATPase activity. Role of Hsp 90 in Giardia encystation Giardia has a biphasic life cycle with proliferative trophozoites and latent cyst stage. In Giardia, in vitro encystation was established nearly two decades back by modulating the medium conditions. However, the mechanism and triggers underlying this transition are not well characterized. To understand whether Hsp 90 has any role in this transition, in vitro conversion of trophozoites to cysts was achieved. The cysts obtained showed all the characteristic features of mature Giardia cyst with cyst wall protein 1 (CWP 1) on the cyst wall and four nuclei as determined by immunofluorescence analysis. Further, the levels of Hsp 90 in trophozoites were compared with mature cysts at both transcript and protein levels and it was found that cysts show more than 50 % reduction in the level of Hsp 90 in comparison with normal trophozoites. In accordance, exogenous inhibition of Hsp 90 using 17 AAG promoted the formation of cysts in vitro by 60 folds in a dose dependent manner; however, the window period of Hsp 90 function compromise plays an important role in this process. Higher numbers of cysts were obtained from the cells treated with inhibitors during pre-encystation condition but inhibition of Hsp 90 during encystation did not affect the formation of cysts, suggesting that Hsp 90 down-regulation plays an important role during commitment towards encystation. To further show that cyst formation is a specific response to Hsp 90 inhibition we have carried out encystation in the presence of metranidazole and from heat shocked cells; however, in both the conditions we did not observe any significant change in cyst formation, thus confirming that Hsp 90 plays an important role during encystation in Giardia lamblia. Summary In Conclusion, Our study throws light on a unique aspect of Hsp 90 biology in Giardia Lamblia, wherein the formation of the full length protein is dependent on a unique trans splicing reaction of its gene components representing different domains. We have also shown that HsP 90 fragments, HspN and HspC, are also expressed in Trophozoites. Our in vitro data suggests that these fragments possibly regulate the function of Hsp 90. Furthermore, the full length of Hsp 90 plays an important role in stage transition in Giardia wherein inhibition of Hsp 90 induces encystations. The study has opened many new avenues for research. Understanding the exact role of HspN and HspC in vivo will provide better appreciation for the evolution of such a complex biogenesis of an essential protein...|$|R

However, splicing of exons present on separate pre-mRNA molecules can also occur. This trans-splicing reaction can be exploited by pre-trans-splicing molecules (PTMs), which are incapable of <b>cis-splicing.</b> PTM-mediated trans-splicing has been utilized to repair mutant RNAs as a novel approach to gene therapy. Herein we explore how the site of PTM expression influences trans-splicing activity. We stably inserted a PTM expression cassette into the genome of HEK 293 cells, generating clonal lines with single, unique insertion sites. We analyzed trans-splicing to the gene where the PTM was integrated, as well as genes neighboring these loci. We observed some pre-mRNAs only serve as substrates for trans-splicing when they are expressed in immediate proximity to the PTM expression site. The need for PTMs to be in close proximity with pre-mRNAs to trans-splice with them {{is consistent with the}} observation that pre-mRNA <b>cis-splicing</b> occurs cotranscriptionally.

Only assemblages A and B infect humans and are suggested to represent two different Giardia species. Correlations exist between assemblage type and host-specificity {{and to some extent}} symptoms. Phenotypical differences have been documented between assemblages and genome sequences are available for A, B and E. We have characterized and compared the polyadenylated transcriptomes of assemblages A, B and E. Four genetically different isolates were studied (WB (AI), AS 175 (AII), P 15 (E) and GS (B)) using paired-end, strand-specific RNA-seq. Most of the genome was transcribed in trophozoites grown in vitro, but at vastly different levels. RNA-seq confirmed many of the present annotations and refined the current genome annotation. Gene expression divergence was found to recapitulate the known phylogeny, and uncovered lineage-specific differences in expression. Polyadenylation sites were mapped for over 70 % of the genes and revealed many examples of conserved and unexpectedly long 3 ' UTRs. 28 open reading frames were found in a non-transcribed gene cluster on chromosome 5 of the WB isolate. Analysis of allele-specific expression revealed a correlation between allele-dosage and allele expression in the GS isolate.

Previous work on trans-splicing ribozymes has mostly focused on the 16 S rRNA group I intron ribozyme from Tetrahymena thermophila. Here, we test the trans-splicing potential of the tRNAIle group I intron ribozyme from the bacterium Azoarcus. This ribozyme is only {{half the size of}} the Tetrahymena ribozyme and folds faster into its active conformation in vitro. Our results showed that in vitro, the Azoarcus and Tetrahymena ribozymes favored the same set of splice sites on a substrate RNA. Both ribozymes showed the same trans-splicing efficiency when containing their individually optimized 5 ' terminus. In contrast to the previously optimized 5 '-terminal design of the Tetrahymena ribozyme, the Azoarcus ribozyme was most efficient with a trans-splicing design that resembled the secondary structure context of the natural <b>cis-splicing</b> Azoarcus ribozyme, which includes base-pairing between the substrate 5 ' portion and the ribozyme 3 ' exon. These results suggested preferred trans-splicing interactions for the Azoarcus ribozyme under near-physiological in vitro conditions.

40|$|In man, {{activated}} N-, K- and H-ras oncogenes {{have been}} found in around 30 % of the solid tumours tested. An exon known as IDX, which has been described previously and is located between exon 3 and exon 4 A of the c-H-ras pre-mRNA, allows an alternative splicing process that results in the synthesis of the mRNA of a putative protein named p 19. It has been suggested that this alternative pathway is less tumorigenic than that which results in the activation of p 21. We have used the mammalian trans-splicing mechanism as a tool with which to modulate this particular pre-mRNA processing to produce mRNA similar to that of mature p 19 RNA. The E 4 A exon of the activated H-ras gene was found to be a good target for external trans-splicing. We reprogrammed the rat carnitine octanoyltransferase exon 2 to specifically invade the terminal region of H-ras. Assays performed with this reprogrammed trans-exon showed that the trans-splicing product was obtained in competition with <b>cis-splicing</b> of the D intron of the H-ras gene, and was associated with concomitant down-modulation of D intron <b>cis-splicing.</b> We also found that the exon 4 A of the human c-H-ras gene underwent successive trans-splicing rounds with an external exon.

In this study, SmD 3 - and Lsm 3 -associated complexes were purified to homogeneity from Leishmania tarentolae. The purified complexes were analyzed by mass spectrometry, and 54 and 39 proteins were purified from SmD 3 and Lsm complexes, respectively. Interestingly, among the proteins purified from Lsm 3, no mRNA degradation factors were detected, as in Lsm complexes from other eukaryotes. The U 1 A complex was purified and mass spectrometry analysis identified, in addition to U 1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) proteins, additional co-purified proteins, including the polyadenylation factor CPSF 73. Defects observed in cells silenced for U 1 snRNP proteins suggest that the U 1 snRNP functions exclusively in <b>cis-splicing,</b> although U 1 A also participates in polyadenylation and affects trans-splicing.
