30|$|Targeted {{treatment}} of eukaryotic pathogen remains {{a major problem}} in our efforts to counter infectious diseases. As opposed to bacterial pathogens with unique targets, the molecular and functional similarities in eukaryotic pathogens to human cells make it particularly challenging to find novel targets for therapeutic interventions. The synthesis of derivatives of these photodynamic compounds in order to improve their selective attachment to the parasite is a complete new approach to this infection. To this end, studies have shown the presence of an adhesin, mannose-binding protein (MBP) on the surface membranes of Acanthamoeba that is critical in its pathogenesis ([Alsam et al., 2003]; [Garate et al., 2004]). For robust and targeted killing, future studies will synthesize photosensitizer-alpha-D-mannose conjugates of varying charges as well as photosensitizer-MBP antibody conjugates. This together with appropriate selection of light source (lasers) to emit monochromatic light in the visible spectrum in a given direction targeting and fully activating the photosensitizer compound will determine the potential of photochemotherapy to counter this devastating infection. In addition, these studies will provide a model and stimulate ongoing research in targeting other pathogens, which <b>cause</b> <b>serious</b> <b>eye</b> infections.|$|R
40|$|Farmed grayling, Thymallus thymallus (L.), are {{susceptible}} to atypical Aeromonas salmonicida (aAS) infections. Interactions between bacteria and parasites were studied using grayling subjected to concomitant exposure to aAS bacteria and the digenean parasite Diplostomum spathaceum. Atypical AS was detected from fish {{by a combination of}} bacterial cultivation and polymerase chain reaction techniques. A detection level of 17 aAS cells per 100 ?mg intestine tissue sample was obtained. Concomitant bacterial exposure did not enhance the severity of grayling eye rupture and nuclear extrusion induced by D. spathaceum, but D. spathaceum invasion into grayling increased the proportion of fish carrying aAS in their heart tissue. However, the number of aAS cells detected in heart tissue was low. Atypical AS did not cause acute disease or mortality during 15 ?days post-exposure. There was a higher prevalence of aAS in grayling heart samples than in intestinal samples, indicating that the intestine is not favoured by aAS. We suggest that heart tissue would be a good organ from which to isolate aAS when tracing latent carrier fish.

Adults often hide the eggs for children to find, an activity known as an Easter egg hunt. A similar tradition of egg painting exists in areas of the world influenced by the culture of Persia. Before the spring equinox in the Persian New Year tradition (called Norouz), each family member decorates a hard-boiled egg and sets them together in a bowl. The tradition of a dancing egg is held during the feast of Corpus Christi in Barcelona and other Catalan cities since the 16th century. It consists of an emptied egg, positioned over the water jet from a fountain, which starts turning without falling. Although a food item, eggs are sometimes thrown at houses, cars, or people.

2500|$|While {{glyphosate}} and formulations such as Roundup {{have been}} approved by regulatory bodies worldwide, concerns about their effects on humans and the environment persist. Many regulatory and scholarly reviews have evaluated the relative toxicity of glyphosate as an herbicide. The German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment toxicology review in 2013 found that [...] "the available data is contradictory and far from being convincing" [...] with regard to correlations between exposure to glyphosate formulations and risk of various cancers, including non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). A meta-analysis published in 2014 identified {{an increased risk of}} NHL in workers exposed to glyphosate formulations. In March 2015 the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer classified glyphosate as [...] "probablynbsp&carcinogenicnbsp&in humans" [...] (category 2A) based on epidemiological studies, animal studies, and in vitro studies. In November, 2015, the European Food Safety Authority published an updated assessment report on glyphosate, concluding that [...] "the substance is unlikely to be genotoxic (i.e. damaging to DNA) or to pose a carcinogenic threat to humans." [...] Furthermore, the final report clarified that while other, probably carcinogenic, glyphosate-containing formulations may exist, studies [...] "that look solely at the active substance glyphosate do not show this effect." [...] The WHO and FAO Joint committee on pesticide residues issued a report in 2016 confirming that the use of glyphosate formulations does not constitute a health risk and also gave admissible daily intake limits for chronic toxicity. The European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) maintained their current classification of glyphosate as a substance <b>causing</b> <b>serious</b> <b>eye</b> damage and as a substance toxic to aquatic life, but did not find evidence implicating it to be a carcinogen, a mutagen, toxic to reproduction, nor toxic to specific organs.|$|R
40|$|Laser {{pointers}} {{are completely}} safe when properly {{used as a}} visual or instructional aid. However, they can <b>cause</b> <b>serious</b> <b>eye</b> damage when used improperly. There have been enough documented injuries from laser pointers to trigger a warning from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA and Safety Notification). Before deciding to use a laser pointer, presenters are reminded to consider alternate methods of calling attention to specific items. Most presentation software packages offer screen pointer options with the same features, but without the laser hazard. Selecting a Safe Laser Pointer 1) Choose low power lasers (Class 2 or 3 R, formerly 3 a) Whenever possible, select a Class 2 laser pointer because of the lower risk of eye damage. If a more powerful laser is required, presenters may use a Class 3 R laser {{with the understanding that}} greater responsibility and care are required. Laser devices with other laser classes are inappropriate for use as a laser pointer (see Identifying Laser Characteristics below). 2) Choose red-orange lasers (633 to 650 nm wavelength, choose closer to 635 nm) Early diode laser pointers were dark red (670 nm wavelength) and difficult to see due to the eye’s lower response to red. Newer red-orange lasers are significantly brighter than their dark red predecessors using the same or even less power. See below for available products. Green and blue laser pointers are available, however each has serious drawbacks 1. Initially, green will appear brighter than red. However, green may actually be too bright and has been found to leave a distracting after-image on the retina, making it difficult to concentrate on the presentation. Safety concerns have been raised about photo-biological effects from blue light laser pointers (400 - 500 nm) and they should be avoided. 3) On/Off Switch Ensure that the on switch is a momentary contact type that is designed to shut off the pointer when released.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore a {{possible}} mechanism of <b>eye</b> <b>irritation</b> by constructing a corresponding general quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model using a genetic algorithm. The model was derived from a subset of diverse chemical structures found in the Draize <b>eye</b> <b>irritation</b> ECETOC data set. Methods: Molecular dynamic simulation (MDS) was used to generate intermolecular membrane-solute interaction properties. These intermolecular properties were combined with intramolecular physicochemical properties and features of the solute (irritant) to construct QSAR models using multi-dimensional linear regression and the Genetic Function Approximation (GFA) algorithm. Results: Significant QSAR models for estimating <b>eye</b> <b>irritation</b> potential were constructed in which solute aqueous solvation free energy and solute-membrane interaction energies are the principle correlation descriptors. These physicochemical descriptors were selected from a trial set of 95 descriptors. Conclusion: Combining intermolecular solute-membrane interaction descriptors with intramolecular solute descriptors yields statistically significant <b>eye</b> <b>irritation</b> QSAR models.

30|$|For <b>eye</b> <b>irritation,</b> the {{situation}} is essentially quite similar. The replacement of the Draize test for <b>eye</b> <b>irritation</b> again was achieved by two methods.

In contrast, the EIT and similar tests use the commercially available reconstructed human cornea-like epithelium (RhCE), which closely mimics the histological, morphological, biochemical and physiological properties of the human corneal epithelium to determine if a test substance is an eye irritant based on its ability to induce cytotoxicity in RhCE tissue, as measured by the MTT assay.

Break-up time (BUT) is another major measure of <b>eye</b> <b>irritation</b> and tear film stability. [...] It is defined as the time interval (in seconds) between blinking and rupture. BUT is considered to reflect the stability of the tear film as well. In normal persons, the break-up time exceeds the interval between blinks, and, therefore, the tear film is maintained. Studies have shown that blink frequency is correlated negatively with break-up time. This phenomenon indicates that perceived <b>eye</b> <b>irritation</b> is associated with an increase in blink frequency since the cornea and conjunctiva both have sensitive nerve endings that belong to the first trigeminal branch.
