In former times, its seeds were widely sold as an inexpensive nutmeg substitute. This is now less common outside its region of production.Other names of <b>calabash</b> <b>nutmeg</b> include Jamaican nutmeg, African nutmeg, ehuru, ariwo, awerewa, ehiri, airama, African orchid nutmeg, muscadier de Calabash and lubushi.|$|E
50|$|The <b>calabash</b> <b>nutmeg</b> tree grows {{naturally}} in evergreen forests from Liberia to Nigeria and Cameroon, Ghana, Angola and also Uganda and west Kenya. Due to {{the slave trade}} in the 18th century, the tree {{was introduced to the}} Caribbean islands where it was established and become known as Jamaican nutmeg. In 1897, Monodora myristica was introduced to Bogor Botanical Gardens, Indonesia, where the trees flower on a regular basis but no fruit could yet be collected. Due to its large and orchid-like flowers, the tree is also grown as an ornamental.|$|E

Common ingredients in goat meat pepper soup are goat meat, crayfish, Uziza, Negro Pepper (also called Uda Ewentia or Enge) and nutmeg, such as <b>Calabash</b> <b>Nutmeg</b> (also called Ehu or Ariwo). Other ingredients that are commonly used when access to traditional ingredients is limited are bouillon cubes, onion, salt, pepper, basil and chili pepper. Some versions also use a goat's head. Preparation involves cleaning and seasoning the meat and simmering with chopped onions, after which water is added and the dish is further cooked. The dish may be finished with seasoning such as salt, pepper and basil.|$|E
40|$|Flours {{produced}} from raw, blanched and boiled seeds of Sphenostylis stenocarpa (African yam bean), Sesamum indicum (Sesame seed), Monodora myristica (<b>Calabash</b> <b>nutmeg)</b> and Afzelia africana (African oak) were evaluated for total protein and amino acid compositions. The {{results show that}} the seeds of S. indicum had the highest total protein content (24. 74 ± 0. 56 %) relative to those of S. stenocarpa (18. 90 ± 0. 35 %), M. myristica (12. 83 ± 0. 40 %) and A. africana (9. 56 ± 0. 12 %). The amino acid contents followed the pattern 0. 030 ± 0. 010 mol/l for S. stenocarpa > 0. 025 ± 0. 005 mol/l for A. africana > 0. 014 ± 0. 003 mol/l for M. myristica > 0. 010 ± 0. 002 mol/l for S. indicum. The seeds were found to be rich in amino acids especially the essential amino acids which relative to the non-essential amino acids had high percentages of 81, 80, 77 and 70 % for S. stenocarpa, M. myristica, S. indicum and A. Africana respectively. Boiling significantly (p S. stenocarpa, S. indicum and A. Africana seeds. The results suggest that the seeds are potentially important plant sources of proteins and amino acids especially the essential amino acids necessary for human and livestock nutrition...|$|E
