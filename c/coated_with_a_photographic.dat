40|$|Activator of G protein {{signaling}} 3 (AGS 3) is a {{guanine nucleotide}} dissociation inhibitor (GDI) to heterotrimeric G proteins of the Galphai/o class. Previous studies {{have described the}} tissue distribution and expression changes of AGS 3 in brain extracts; however the precise localization of AGS 3 in intact tissue {{has not yet been}} determined. The aim of the present study is therefore to map in detail the expression of AGS 3 mRNA in the rat brain by using in situ hybridization (ISH) histochemistry <b>with</b> <b>a</b> (33) P-labeled riboprobe. Hybridized sections were analyzed at the regional level after exposure to autoradiography films and at the cellular level after <b>coating</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>photographic</b> emulsion. Our results confirm a broad distribution for AGS 3 which is expressed throughout the brain. Although most regions show a low level of expression, our results reveal a high abundance of AGS 3 mRNA in the cerebellum as well as in regions important for neural precursor cell proliferation (subventricular zone of the anterior lateral ventricle), migration (rostral migratory stream) and differentiation (olfactory bulb). In particular, the high abundance of AGS 3 in the subventricular zone-olfactory bulb system further documents the potential role of AGS 3 in neural precursor cell division, migration and/or differentiation. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|DJ- 1 is mutated in {{autosomal}} recessive, early onset Parkinson's disease but {{the exact}} localization of the DJ- 1 gene {{product in the}} mammalian brain is largely unknown. We aimed to evaluate the DJ- 1 mRNA expression pattern in the mouse brain. Serial coronal sections of brains of five male and five female adult mice were investigated by using in situ hybridization <b>with</b> <b>a</b> DJ- 1 specific 35 S-labeled oligonucleotide probe. Hybridized sections were analyzed after exposure to autoradiography films and after <b>coating</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>photographic</b> emulsion. DJ- 1 was heterogeneously expressed throughout the mouse central nervous system. A high expression of DJ- 1 mRNA was detected in neuronal and non-neuronal populations of several structures of the motor system such as the substantia nigra, the red nucleus, the caudate putamen, the globus pallidus, and the deep nuclei of the cerebellum. Furthermore, DJ- 1 mRNA was also highly expressed in non-motor structures including the hippocampus, the olfactory bulb, the reticular nucleus of the thalamus, and the piriform cortex. The high expression of DJ- 1 mRNA in brain regions involved in motor control {{is compatible with the}} occurrence of parkinsonian symptoms after DJ- 1 mutations. However, expression in other regions indicates that a dysfunction of DJ- 1 may contribute to additional clinical features in patients <b>with</b> <b>a</b> DJ- 1 mutation...|$|R
50|$|As a {{ubiquitous}} desktop item, the mug {{is often}} used {{as an object of}} art or advertisement; some mugs are rather decorations than drinking vessels. Carving had been traditionally applied to mugs in the ancient times. Deforming a mug into an unusual shape is sometimes used. However, the most popular decoration technique nowadays is printing on mugs, which is usually performed as follows: Ceramic powder is mixed with dyes of chosen color and a plasticizer. Then it is printed on a gelatin-coated paper using a traditional screen-printing technique, which applies the mixture through a fine woven mesh, which is stretched on a frame and has a mask of desired shape. This technique produces a thin homogeneous coating; however, if smoothness is not required, the ceramic mixture is painted directly <b>with</b> <b>a</b> brush. Another, more complex alternative is to <b>coat</b> the paper <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>photographic</b> emulsion, photoprint the image and then cure the emulsion with ultraviolet light.|$|R
50|$|These {{plate and}} film {{products}} differed substantially {{only in the}} means used to manufacture the colour mosaic layer and its resulting pattern and fineness. Autochrome's mosaic was a random array of dyed potato starch grains, {{too small to be}} individually visible without a microscope. Most competing products employed a coarser geometric pattern created by one of the many methods devised and patented during that era. Dufaycolor's filter layer was of the geometric type, but its proprietary manufacturing process produced an unusually fine-patterned mosaic. A very thin coating of collodion {{on one side of the}} film base was dyed blue, printed with closely spaced fine lines using a water-repelling greasy ink, and bleached. The clear spaces created were then dyed green. The ink was removed and new ink lines were printed at a 90 degree angle to the blue and green lines. The new gaps were bleached and dyed red, resulting in a colour filter mosaic, known as a réseau, consisting of alternating green and blue squares between red lines, and having roughly one million colour filter elements per square inch.In very early years, different arrangements of the same colours were used, the lines being green or blue instead of red and sometimes intersecting the other colours diagonally. After a final ink removal and the application of an isolating varnish, the same side of the film base was <b>coated</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> panchromatic black-and-white <b>photographic</b> emulsion. When exposed to light through the base and its réseau, the bit of emulsion behind each colour element recorded only the amount of light of that primary colour striking the film at that point.|$|R
