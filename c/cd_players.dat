5|$|Finite {{symmetry}} {{groups such}} as the Mathieu groups are used in coding theory, which is in turn applied in error correction of transmitted data, and in <b>CD</b> <b>players.</b> Another application is differential Galois theory, which characterizes functions having antiderivatives of a prescribed form, giving group-theoretic criteria for when solutions of certain differential equations are well-behaved. Geometric properties that remain stable under group actions are investigated in (geometric) invariant theory.|$|E
5|$|Hail to the Thief was {{released}} on 9 June 2003 by Parlophone Records in the United Kingdom and a day later by Capitol Records in the United States. The CD was printed with copy protection in some regions; the Belgian consumer group Test-Achats received complaints that the album could not be played on some <b>CD</b> <b>players.</b> A compilation of Hail to the Thief B-sides, remixes and live performances, COM LAG (2plus2isfive), {{was released}} in April 2004.|$|E
5|$|The {{music for}} the game was {{composed}} by David Wise. The soundtrack was first released in Japan on 1 April 1998, with 42 tracks, a German version of the album was released in Europe with {{the same number of}} tracks. For its United States release only 16 tracks were featured. The disc itself was specially shaped in the form of Diddy Kong's head, which was unplayable in certain <b>CD</b> <b>players.</b>|$|E

5|$|Three {{additional}} system {{models were}} created by other electronics companies. Working with Sega, JVC released the Wondermega on April 1, 1992, in Japan, at an initial retail price of ¥82,800 (or US$620). The system was later redesigned by JVC and released as the X'Eye in North America in September 1994. Designed by JVC to be a Genesis and Sega CD combination with high-quality audio, the Wondermega's high price kept {{it out of the}} hands of average consumers. Likewise was the case with the Pioneer LaserActive, which was also an add-on that required an attachment developed by Sega, known as the Mega-LD pack, in order to play Genesis and Sega CD games. Though the LaserActive, developed by Pioneer Corporation, was lined up to compete with the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer, the combined system and Mega-LD pack retailed at nearly $1600, becoming a very expensive option for Sega <b>CD</b> <b>players.</b> Aiwa also released the CSD-GM1, a combination Genesis/Sega CD unit built into a boombox.|$|E
25|$|The Philips Green Book {{specifies}} {{a standard}} for interactive multimedia compact discs designed for CD-i players (1993). CD-i discs can contain audio tracks which can be played on regular <b>CD</b> <b>players,</b> but CD-i discs are not compatible with most CD-ROM drives and software. The CD-i Ready specification was later created to improve compatibility with audio <b>CD</b> <b>players,</b> and the CD-i Bridge specification was added to create CD-i compatible discs that can be accessed by regular CD-ROM drives.|$|E

50|$|Topgrading is a {{corporate}} hiring and interviewing methodology that {{is intended to}} identify preferred candidates for a particular position. In the methodology, prospective employees undergo a 12-step process that includes extensive interviews, the creation of detailed job scorecards, research into job history, coaching, and more. After being interviewed and reference-checked, job candidates are grouped into one of three categories: A Players, B <b>Players,</b> or <b>C</b> <b>Players.</b> A Players have the most potential for high performance in their role while B and <b>C</b> <b>Players</b> may require more work to be successful. The methodology {{has been used by}} major corporations and organizations like General Electric, Lincoln Financial, Honeywell, Barclays, the American Heart Association, and others.|$|R
30|$|In Fig. 22, player B moved forward, and <b>player</b> <b>C</b> moved behind <b>player</b> B (Fig. 22 b, c). At this time, {{the system}} lost <b>player</b> <b>C,</b> {{which can be}} {{confirmed}} in Fig. 22 f in which only the center point (the pink circle) is displayed in the green rectangle and the body was not detected. As <b>player</b> <b>C</b> stepped aside (Fig. 22 h, i), the system found <b>player</b> <b>C</b> and tracked him again (Fig. 22 l).|$|R
25|$|Many {{mass transit}} systems {{prohibit}} {{the use of}} audio devices, such as radios, <b>CD</b> <b>players,</b> and MP3 players unless used with earphones through which only the user can hear the audio transmitted.|$|E
25|$|Philips {{defined a}} format similar to CD-i called CD-i Ready, which puts CD-i {{software}} and data into the pregap of track 1. This format {{was supposed to}} be more compatible with older audio <b>CD</b> <b>players.</b>|$|E

25|$|Titles in the SACD format can {{be issued}} as hybrid discs; these discs contain the SACD audio stream {{as well as}} a {{standard}} audio CD layer which is playable in standard <b>CD</b> <b>players,</b> thus making them backward compatible.|$|E
25|$|Inherently safe; no {{possibility}} of eye damage. This can be either because of a low output power (in which case eye damage is impossible even after hours of exposure), or due to an enclosure preventing user access to the laser beam during normal operation, such as in <b>CD</b> <b>players</b> or laser printers.|$|E
25|$|Discs with DRM schemes are not {{standards-compliant}} Compact Discs (CDs) but {{are rather}} CD-ROM media. Therefore, they all lack the CD logotype found on discs which follow the standard (known as Red Book). These CDs cannot {{be played on}} all <b>CD</b> <b>players</b> or personal computers. Personal computers running Microsoft Windows sometimes even crash when attempting to play the CDs.|$|E
50|$|In May 2013, he {{was awarded}} the England <b>C</b> <b>Player</b> of the Year award at the Non-League Paper's National Game Awards {{ceremony}} held at Fulham's Craven Cottage. He made his hundredth league appearance for Forest Green on 24 September 2013 against Tamworth.|$|R
50|$|All {{games for}} Group C were contested at the Olympic Ice Rink in Courchevel, France from August 28-30. Norway players Helene Martinsen led all Group <b>C</b> <b>players</b> in scoring with 8 points, while {{teammate}} Andrea Dalen ranked second in Group C scoring with 6 points.|$|R
50|$|The Empire {{league has}} {{had a number of}} winners of the OHA Junior <b>C</b> <b>Player</b> of the Year award. Most recently, Napanee's Pete Sergeant took the honours in 2008-2009.

25|$|Interlocks are {{circuits}} {{that stop}} the laser beam if some condition is not met, such {{as if the}} laser casing or a room door is open. Class3B and 4 lasers typically provide a connection for an external interlock circuit. Many lasers are considered class1 only because the light is contained within an interlocked enclosure, like DVD drives or portable <b>CD</b> <b>players.</b>|$|E
25|$|Audiophiles have {{differed}} {{over the}} relative merits of the LP versus the CD since the digital disc was introduced. Vinyl records are still prized for their reproduction of analog recordings. The LP's drawbacks, however, include surface noise, tracking error, pitch variations and greater sensitivity to handling. Modern anti-aliasing filters and oversampling systems used in digital recordings have reduced problems observed with early <b>CD</b> <b>players.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{demand for}} batteries, {{primarily}} nickel-metal-hydride and lithium-ion batteries, {{has caused a}} growth in graphite demand in the late 1980s and early 1990s. This growth was driven by portable electronics, such as portable <b>CD</b> <b>players</b> and power tools. Laptops, mobile phones, tablet, and smartphone products have increased the demand for batteries. Electric vehicle batteries are anticipated to increase graphite demand. As an example, a lithium-ion battery in a fully electric Nissan Leaf contains nearly 40kg of graphite.|$|E
50|$|An example round (diamond is trump): player A leads with a 9♣, player B Q♣, <b>Player</b> <b>C</b> 7♦, <b>player</b> D 8♣. Notice that <b>player</b> <b>C</b> has no clubs, or else {{he would}} have to put down a club, so he has two options: {{to get rid of a}} card that is not trump, or to try to win the trick with a trump. Player D had clubs, so he had to put down a club and could not put down a trump, and so <b>Player</b> <b>C</b> wins the trick.|$|R
50|$|The pool of {{available}} player talent was considered so poor that the Toronto Maple Leafs elected {{not to participate}} whatsoever.

25|$|Mead has cut the Gordian knot {{of quantum}} complementarity. He claims that atoms, with their neutrons, protons, and electrons, are not {{particles}} {{at all but}} pure waves of matter. Mead cites as the gross evidence of the exclusively wave nature of both light and matter the discovery between 1933 and 1996 of ten examples of pure wave phenomena, including the ubiquitous laser of <b>CD</b> <b>players,</b> the self-propagating electrical currents of superconductors, and the Bose–Einstein condensate of atoms.|$|E
25|$|Hybrid SACDs claim {{a higher}} {{compatibility}} rate with conventional <b>CD</b> <b>players</b> than DualDisc, because hybrid SACDs conform to Red Book standards. However, a SACD or SACD-capable DVD player {{is required to}} take advantage of the enhanced SACD layer. With a DualDisc, consumers could use their existing DVD player to hear surround mixes. (DVD-Audio capable players are required for higher-resolution audio, if present.) In 2005, it was estimated that 75% of households in the United States have at least one DVD player.|$|E
25|$|The company's first iriver {{product was}} the iMP-100, a {{portable}} CD player capable of decoding MP3 data files on CDs, released in November 2000. It and a later model, the iMP-250, were rebranded and sold by SonicBlue in the United States under the Rio Volt name. Iriver sold later models {{with its own}} SlimX brand, billing them as the thinnest MP3 <b>CD</b> <b>players</b> in the world, before jumping to other types of players. The company rose to the No. 1 position in the global market, before being displaced by the iPod's introduction.|$|E
