5|$|As discussed, the Chalkidian League {{had made}} peace with Athens in 352 BC, in <b>clear</b> <b>breach</b> of their {{alliance}} with Philip, due to their growing fear of Macedonian power. Cawkwell contends that from that moment on, Olynthos and the League were doomed. However, {{the next few years}} of Philip's reign appear to have been militarily quiet; Diodorus does not mention any activity by Philip until 349 BC. Philip did not yet make any further efforts to intervene in the Sacred War, which was to rumble on until 346 BC. In the meantime, there may have been some unrest in Macedonia; Philip executed one of his stepbrothers (sons of Amyntas III's second wife), and two more fled to Olynthos. According to Justin, this provided Philip with the pretext of attacking Olynthos and the Chalkidian League.|$|E
5|$|Cagney's last {{movie in}} 1935 was Ceiling Zero, his third film with Pat O'Brien. O'Brien {{received}} top billing, {{which was a}} <b>clear</b> <b>breach</b> of Cagney's contract. This, combined {{with the fact that}} Cagney had made five movies in 1934, again against his contract terms, caused him to bring legal proceedings against Warner Bros. for breach of contract. The dispute dragged on for several months. Cagney received calls from David Selznick and Sam Goldwyn, but neither felt in a position to offer him work while the dispute went on. Meanwhile, while being represented by his brother William in court, Cagney went back to New York to search for a country property where he could indulge his passion for farming.|$|E

500|$|Several reviewers re-watched {{the episode}} {{after the end}} of the series. Castmember Wil Wheaton watched [...] "Justice" [...] for AOL TV in December 2006. He {{observed}} [...] problems with his acting and the plot development, particularly where Picard transports the Edo woman to the Enterprise. Wheaton felt Picard's actions were a <b>clear</b> <b>breach</b> of the Prime Directive which was otherwise at the heart of the episode. On the other hand, he thought the episode showed a proper dynamic between Picard and the bridge crew, and he believed it tackled a real ethics problem in a manner more frequently seen in the 2004 Battlestar Galactica television series. Wheaton gave the episode of [...] "Justice" [...] a [...] grade of B+.|$|E
500|$|Beginning {{on the day}} of the fort's capture, Allen and Arnold began a war of words, each {{attempting}} to garner for himself as much credit for the operation as possible. [...] Arnold, unable to exert any authority over Allen and his men, began to keep a diary of events and actions, which was highly critical and dismissive of Allen. [...] Allen, in the days immediately after the action, also began to work on a memoir. Published several years later (see Further reading), the memoir fails to mention Arnold at all. [...] Allen also wrote several versions of the events, which John Brown and James Easton brought to a variety of Congresses and committees in New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts. [...] Randall (1990) claims that Easton took accounts written by both Arnold and Allen to the Massachusetts committee, but conveniently lost Arnold's account on the way, ensuring that Allen's version, which greatly glorified his role in the affair, would be preferred. [...] Smith (1907) indicates that it was highly likely that Easton was interested in claiming Arnold's command for himself. [...] There was clearly no love lost between Easton and Arnold. Allen and Easton returned to Crown Point on June 10 and called a council of war while Arnold was with the fleet on the lake, a <b>clear</b> <b>breach</b> of military protocol. [...] When Arnold, whose men now dominated the garrison, asserted his authority, Easton insulted Arnold, who responded by challenging Easton to a duel. Arnold later reported, [...] "On refusing to draw like a gentleman, he having a [...] by his side and cases of loaded pistols in his pockets, I kicked him very heartily and ordered him from the Point." ...|$|E

In March 2009, the Administrative Court refused permission for the case to proceed to a full hearing. Syvret subsequently complained that the hearing was a [...] "farrago", the two judges (Lord Justice Richards and Mr Justice Tugendhat)–who he described as [...] "Allies of the Jersey oligarchy" [...] – were biased and that the High Court hearing was [...] "absurdly short", resulting in [...] "a <b>clear</b> <b>breach</b> of British jurisprudence and of Article 6 of the ECHR".|$|E

2500|$|The German occupying forces, {{which had}} a need for builders, electricians, plumbers, mechanics, {{cleaning}} staff, quarry men, secretarial staff, labourers, translators and many other trades and skills, offered twice the normal island pay. All young men in the islands were required to register with the Feldkommandantur {{so they could be}} assessed and [...] "recruited" [...] as workers if not employed in useful work elsewhere. By 1943, around 4,000 islanders were directly employed by the Germans. Most of the skilled workers in the German building businesses under the collective Organisation Todt (OT) were volunteers, paid for their work and fed better than the drafted forced labourers from many nations, who were treated like slaves. The Germans would demand labour be provided. One job involving 180 men was to help level the airport, a <b>clear</b> <b>breach</b> of the Geneva Convention.

2500|$|Amnesty International said it {{was also}} clear that Hizbullah fired a mortar from a {{position}} within 200metres of {{the periphery of the}} UN compound. All indications were that they were firing at an IDF patrol who had infiltrated north of the security zone and had apparently been laying mines. The intention of Hizbullah in choosing that location for the mortar was unclear; it might have been to shield themselves against an IDF counter-attack in the belief that the UN compound would be too close for the IDF to respond. Even if this was not the intention of Hizbullah, by taking up positions where they did they clearly were reckless as to the consequences this might have for the civilians in the immediate area. In either case, this was a <b>clear</b> <b>breach</b> of the laws of war prohibiting the use of civilian population as a shield. Nonetheless, the Amnesty International investigation concluded, [...] "Hizbullah’s action in no way justifies the IDF attack on the compound." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{being placed}} {{to compete in}} the first semi-final on 12 May, a {{national}} final was held in Georgia to select its entry. The selected entry, Stefane & 3G with [...] "We Don't Wanna Put In" [...] gained coverage and controversy due to perceived political connotations within its lyrics relating to Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. The EBU rejected the song due to these political connotations, calling it a <b>clear</b> <b>breach</b> of the contest's rules. The EBU then asked the Georgian broadcaster Georgian Public Broadcaster (GPB) on 10 March to change either the lyrics of the song, or to select a new song to compete for the country. GPB refused to change the lyrics or the song, claiming that the song contained no political references, and that the rejection by the EBU was due to political pressure from Russia. As such, GPB withdrew Georgia from the contest on 11 March. The EBU never made a comment on the country's withdrawal. On 11 May the band admitted the political content of the song and their intention was just to embarrass Putin in Moscow. As a result of refusing to change the song lyrics and decision to withdraw the song developed in an idea to start an AlterVision Open Air Song Contest. First Open Air AlterVision Song Contest was held in Tbilisi (Georgia) on May 15–17, 2009.|$|E

He labeled the daily recitals of the Lord's Prayer and reading of the Bible as [...] "quite <b>clear</b> <b>breaches</b> of the command of the Establishment Clause". He noted the long history of such practices, even before the [...] "founding of our Republic". Additionally, he stated that most of those who demanded reading of the Bible and prayer in schools were hoping to serve [...] "broader goals than compelling formal worship of God or fostering church attendance". He cited the 1858 words of the Wisconsin Superintendent of Public Instruction, who saw the Bible as aptly suited to [...] "teaching the noblest principles of virtue, morality, patriotism, and good order".|$|R

60|$|Presently {{they struck}} again. Crash! Every timber groaned {{as the boat}} turned {{broadside}} to the sea, which made a <b>clear</b> <b>breach</b> over her. The coxswain and Bax alone stood up, both {{holding on to the}} mizzen-mast. The rest clung on as they best could to the thwarts, sometimes buried in water, often with only their heads above it. The tide was making, and as the boat passed each shoal the bow lifted first and swung round--then the stern, and it was clear again; but only to be hurled on the next ridge, when the sea once more burst over it, sweeping away everything that was loose.|$|E
60|$|At length, I {{felt the}} keel come {{down upon the}} sands; and then I knew {{we were on the}} bar.

The first blow threw both masts out of the steps; ripping up the decks to a considerable extent. The next minute we were on our beam-ends; the sea making a <b>clear</b> <b>breach</b> over us. All we could do, was to hold on; and this we did with difficulty. I and the two blacks got on the weather-quarter of the schooner, where we lashed ourselves with the main-sheet. As this was a stout rope, something must part, before we could be washed away. The craft made but two raps on the bar, when she drifted clear.|$|E
60|$|It {{is quite}} {{certain that the}} Boer Government {{committed}} a very <b>clear</b> <b>breach</b> of the Conventions of The Hague in compelling, or even in permitting, these men to rejoin the ranks. 'In such cases,' says Article X., 'their own Government shall not require of, nor accept from, them any service incompatible with the parole given.' This is clear as regards the Government. But {{in the case of}} the men it is different. Their promise was in a sense conditional upon effective protection from our troops. We had no right to place a man in so terrible a position that he had to choose between breaking his parole and death at the hands of his own countrymen. If we were not sure that we could protect them, we could have retained them in guarded camps, as we eventually did. If we chose to turn them loose upon the wide veldt, then it was our fault more than theirs that they were forced into the ranks of the enemy. To their credit be it said that even under such pressure many of them were true to their oath.|$|E

I got the ladies and Mr. Godstone, {{who had been on}} deck when she struck and got his leg broken by the first sea which pooped her, forward as soon as I could, and managed to fire one of her guns three times. I had no hope of rescue coming from shore, but there was a chance of some ship coming up helping us; though how she was to do it I could not see. However, nothing came near until I saw your sail. I expect that any steamers coming up from the south brought up under the Foreland, while those from the north would of course take the Swin. Anyhow, it would have been all over with us had you not come to our rescue. Even when I saw you making over towards us I had not much hope, for I did not see how you could get close enough to us to aid us, and I was quite sure that no open boat could have lived in that broken water." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was about}} {{six in the morning}} when the blow came on with a white squall, and, as usual, from the northward. By eight it had {{increased}} very much, and brought down upon us one of the most tremendous seas I had then ever beheld. Every thing had been made as snug as possible, but the schooner laboured excessively, and gave evidence of her bad qualities as a seaboat, pitching her forecastle under at every plunge and with the greatest difficulty struggling up from one wave before she was buried in another. Just before sunset the bright spot for which we had been on the look-out made its appearance in the southwest, and in an hour afterward we perceived the little headsail we carried flapping listlessly against the mast. In two minutes more, in spite of every preparation, we were hurled on our beam-ends, as if by magic, and a perfect wilderness of foam made a <b>clear</b> <b>breach</b> over us as we lay. The blow from the southwest, however, luckily proved to be nothing more than a squall, and we {{had the good fortune to}} right the vessel without the loss of a spar. A heavy cross sea gave us great trouble for a few hours after this, but toward morning we found ourselves in nearly as good condition as before the gale.
