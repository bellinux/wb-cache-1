5000|$|The Consulate of the Sea (Consolat de mar; , [...] ) was a {{quasi-judicial}} body {{set up in}} the Crown of Aragon, {{later to}} spread throughout the Mediterranean basin, to administer maritime and commercial law. The term may also refer to a celebrated collection of maritime customs and ordinances in Catalan, also known in English as The <b>Customs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sea,</b> compiled over the 14th and 15th centuries and published at Barcelona in or before 1494.|$|E
50|$|The {{remainder}} of the volume consists {{of what may be}} regarded as an appendix to the original Book of the Consulate. This appendix contains various maritime ordinances of the kings of Aragon and of the councillors of the city of Barcelona, ranging over a period from 1271 to 1493. It is printed apparently in the same type with the preceding part of the volume. The original Book of the Consulate of the Sea, coupled with this appendix, circulated in Europe under the title, The Consulate of the Sea, and in the 16th century was translated into the Castilian, the Italian, and the French languages. The Italian translation, printed at Venice c. 1549 by Jean Baptista Pedrezano, was the version that obtained the largest circulation in the north of Europe, and led many jurists to suppose the work to have been of Italian origin. In the next century, the work was translated into Dutch by Westerven, and into German by Engelbrecht, and it is also said to have been translated into Latin. An excellent translation into French of The <b>Customs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sea,</b> which are the most valuable portion of the Book of the Consulate, was published by Pardessus in the second volume of his Collection des lois maritimes (Paris, 1834), under the title of La Compilation connue sous le nom do consulat de la mer. See introduction, by Sir Travers Twiss, to the Black Book of the Admiralty (London, 1874), which in the appendix to vol. iii, contains his translation of The <b>Customs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sea,</b> with the Catalan text.|$|E
50|$|Historian Marcus Rediker {{notes that}} the Act, in mandating formal contracts, was {{significant}} {{in the development of}} a system of free wage labor at sea, “as it signaled a momentous breakdown in a long-standing customary agreement between seafaring masters and men.” The now-required formalized contract supplanted unwritten agreements based on <b>customs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea,</b> or nebulous written agreements with uncertain terms between seamen and their employers. The Act also typified the shift in the eighteenth century towards a free wage system and away from a “share” system of wages (wherein seamen received a proportional share of the voyage’s earnings). The latter system was typified by a lack of formalized contracts. This system also generated tension between employers who aimed to fetter seamen to their ships and seamen who often found it advantageous to desert from unprofitable voyages.|$|E

5000|$|Until {{the early}} modern period, {{international}} maritime law was governed by customs that were sometimes codified: as for example in the 14th-century Catalan Consulate of the Sea (Catalan: Consolat de mar; Italian: Consolato del mare; also known in English as the <b>Customs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sea).</b> Such customs governed cases in prize courts about the capture of goods {{on the high seas}} by privateers. This rule can be distilled from the Consolato (and other contemporary codes): [...] "enemy goods can be captured on neutral ships and neutral goods are free on board enemy's ships." [...] The first part of the rule implies that neutral shipping is not inviolable in time of war, but the second part implies that goods of neutral owners are. The former contradicts what is now called [...] "freedom of navigation." [...] The doctrine, which will be referred to as the consolato rule for short, was long observed by England (later Great Britain), France, and Spain, as major naval powers.|$|E
5000|$|The {{edition of}} 1494 contains, {{in the first}} place, a code of {{procedure}} issued by the kings of Aragon for {{the guidance of the}} courts of the consuls of the sea, in the second place, a collection of ancient <b>customs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea,</b> and thirdly, a body of rules for the government of cruisers of war. A colophon at the end of these ordinances informs the reader that the book commonly called the Book of the Consulate of the Sea ends here; after which there follows a document known by the title of The Acceptations, which purports to record that the previous chapters and ordinances had been approved by the [...] "Roman" [...] people in 1075, and by various princes and peoples in the 12th and 13th centuries: this is generally regarded as of no historical value. The paging of the edition of 1494 ceases with this document, {{at the end of which}} is the printer's colophon, reciting that the work was completed on 14 July 1494, at Barcelona, by Pere Posa, priest and printer.|$|E

50|$|Although summary {{battlefield}} {{punishment was}} conducted by certain nations at certain times with regard to pirates, it was regarded as irregular (but lawful if <b>the</b> attenuation <b>of</b> due process was dictated by urgent military necessity), as individuals captured with pirates could potentially have a defense to charges of piracy, such as coercion. For instance, in early 1831, the 250-strong crew captured off Ascension was brought to Ascension and summarily hanged, as they were acting in a rebellious manner and threatening to overthrow <b>the</b> 30-man crew <b>of</b> HMS Falcon, a British sloop-of-war, which took them captive. As the summary punishment {{in this case was}} due to military necessity, there was clear evidence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> offense, and it was done proximate in time and location to the battlefield, it can be classified as merely irregular, and not a violation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>custom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Perhaps <b>the</b> oldest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> laws <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> is <b>the</b> {{prohibition}} <b>of</b> piracy, as <b>the</b> peril <b>of</b> {{being set}} upon by pirates, {{who are not}} motivated by national allegiance, is shared by the vessels and mariners of all nations, and thus represents a crime upon all nations. Since <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ancient Romans, pirates have been held to be individuals waging private warfare, a private campaign of sack and pillage, against not only their victims, but against all nations, and thus, pirates hold <b>the</b> peculiar status <b>of</b> being regarded as [...] "hostis humani generis", <b>the</b> enemies <b>of</b> humanity. Since piracy anywhere is a peril to every mariner and ship everywhere, it is held to be the universal right and <b>the</b> universal duty <b>of</b> all nations, regardless of whether their ships have been beset by <b>the</b> particular band <b>of</b> pirates in question, to capture, try by a regularly constituted court-martial or admiralty court (in extreme circumstances, {{by means of a}} drumhead court-martial convened by <b>the</b> officers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> capturing ship), and, if found guilty, to execute the pirate via means <b>of</b> hanging from <b>the</b> yard-arm <b>of</b> <b>the</b> capturing ship, an authoritative <b>Custom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sea.</b>|$|R

50|$|The old {{authorities}} {{took the}} view that a person was never justified in killing an innocent person to save his own life. It was thought that a person should rather submit to death, although the threat to his own life might {{be regarded as a}} mitigating factor. This approach prevailed until relatively recent times, as is illustrated in the leading English criminal case of R v Dudley & Stephens, which established a precedent, throughout the common-law world, that necessity is no defence to a charge of murder. It concerned survival cannibalism following a shipwreck and its purported justification on <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> a <b>custom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea.</b> Dudley and Stephens were involved in a shipwreck and cast adrift in an open boat with two other persons: a man named Brooks and a cabin boy, seventeen years old, called Parker. After seventeen days at sea, eight of them without food and six without water, it became clear that they were unlikely to survive much longer. Dudley and Stephens agreed that Dudley should kill Parker, so that they could eat him, reasoning that he, being younger and weaker, {{would be the first to}} die anyway. Brooks did not agree to the plan. Dudley went ahead and killed Parker. All three of them ate his remains for the next four days. They were rescued on the fifth. Dudley and Stephens, on a charge <b>of</b> murder, raised <b>the</b> defence <b>of</b> necessity. <b>The</b> court rejected this defence and convicted them, holding that the law expects the average man to sacrifice his own life for that of an innocent victim.|$|R

50|$|Taking it as {{established}} {{that a state}} has constitutional power to pass laws giving rights and imposing liabilities for acts done upon <b>the</b> high <b>seas</b> {{when there were no}} such rights or liabilities before, what is there to hinder its doing so in <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> a maritime tort? Not <b>the</b> existence <b>of</b> an inconsistent law emanating from a superior source, that is, from the United States. There is no such law.
