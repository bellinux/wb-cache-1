40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the fracture rates <b>of</b> ProTaper rotary <b>files</b> used in the endodontics extension clinic of the Undergraduate Dentistry Course of the Pontifical Catholic University of Minas Gerais during the prior eight years. Material and Methods: Control record data regarding file usage by students were collected and analyzed by semester. For each period, the total number <b>of</b> patient <b>consultations,</b> the frequency <b>of</b> <b>file</b> use, the occurrence of fractures and the file numbers for which fractures occurred were noted. Descriptive statistics, including frequency <b>of</b> <b>file</b> fractures were calculated for all file types. The chi-square test was used to evaluate differences in the frequency <b>of</b> <b>file</b> fractures between all file types. Results: The study results revealed that during the examined period, there were 1006 consultations and 7993 uses <b>of</b> <b>files.</b> A total <b>of</b> 30 <b>file</b> fractures were recorded throughout this period; thus, fractures occurred in 0. 37 % <b>of</b> total <b>file</b> uses and 2. 98 % <b>of</b> all <b>consultations.</b> The most frequently used files were S 1, S 2 and F 1, and these files also accounted for the most fractures. However, no differences in the frequency <b>of</b> <b>file</b> fractures were observed between the file types (p > 0. 05). Conclusions: The low fracture rates observed in this study indicate that the examined instruments can be used to safely provide dental care to patients...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the adherence of women victims of sexual violence, to AIDS chemoprevention treatment. A quantitative study was carried out at a care service to victims of sexual violence in Salvador (Bahia, Brazil). Study participants were 172 women. Data were collected through interviews with forms and <b>consultation</b> <b>of</b> patient <b>files.</b> The results showed that 45. 4 % of the abused women were teenagers and 40. 7 % of the attended women were raped. Only 54 % {{of the women were}} advised to use antiretrovirals to prevent HIV. Adherence to treatment occurred in 57. 4 % of cases and discontinuity corresponded to 42. 6 %. Non-adherence to treatment was attributed to psychological or emotional disorders and non-understanding of the established treatment. Therefore, it is important that professionals pay careful attention in order to perceive the conditions that might increase women’s vulnerability to the infection.

40|$|Objectives: A {{large number}} of workers in the USA are exposed to {{chrysotile}} asbestos through brake repair, yet only a few cases of malignant mesothelioma (MM) have been described in this population. Epidemiologic and industrial hygiene studies have failed to demonstrate {{an increased risk of}} MM in brake workers. We present our experience of MM in individuals whose only known asbestos exposure was to brake dust and correlate these findings with lung asbestos fiber burdens. Methods: <b>Consultation</b> <b>files</b> <b>of</b> one of the authors were reviewed for cases of MM in which brake dust was the only known asbestos exposure. Lung fiber analyses were performed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in all cases for which formalin-fixed or paraffin-embedded lung tissue was available. Results: Ten cases of MM in brake dust-exposed individuals were males aged 51 – 73 yr. Nine cases arose in the pleura and one in the peritoneum. Although the median lung asbestos body count (19 AB/g) is at our upper limit of normal (range 0 – 20 AB/g), half of the cases had levels within our normal range. In every case with elevated asbestos fiber levels by SEM, excess commercial amphibole fibers were also detected. Elevated levels of chrysotile and non-commer...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} series of a {{distinct}} tumorous entity named renal angiomyoadenomatous tumor (RAT). Five cases were retrieved from the <b>consultation</b> <b>files</b> <b>of</b> the authors. Histologic and immunohistochemical features were evaluated. Sequencing analysis of coding region of the VHL gene {{was carried out in}} all cases. the tumors were composed of admixture of an epithelial clear cell component and prominent leiomyomatous stroma. Epithelial cells formed adenomatous tubular formations endowed with blister-like apical snouts. All tubular/glandular structures were lined by a fine capillary network. the epithelial component was positive for epithelial membrane antigen, CK 7, CK 20, AE 1 -AE 3, CAM 5. 2, and vimentin in all cases. in all analyzed samples, no mutation of the VHL gene was found. RAT is a distinct morphologic entity, being different morphologically, immunohistochemically, and genetically from all renal tumors including conventional clear cell carcinoma and mixed epithelial and stromal tumor of kidney.
