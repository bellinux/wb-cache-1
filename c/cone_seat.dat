25|$|Fixed cone valves are {{designed}} to dissipate the energy from a water flow during reservoir discharge. They are a round pipe section with an adjustable sleeve gate and cone at the discharge end. Flow is varied by moving the sleeve away or towards its <b>cone</b> <b>seat.</b> The design allows high pressure water {{from the base of}} a dam to be released without causing erosion to the surrounding environment. Fixed cone valves are able to handle heads up to 300 m.|$|E
40|$|The {{light-pen}} coordinate {{measuring machine}} (LPCMM for short) is portable and flexible to measure features including invisible ones in-situ. Since different styluses are needed to measure different features and even {{during the process of}} measuring a single workpiece with complicated configurations, to improve the system measurement accuracy it is beneficial to calibrate the stylus tip center position after it is mounted to the light-pen before measurement in an industrial field. A novel and simple method aiming at self-calibrating the position of the tip center based on invariable distances is presented. The distinguishing feature of the proposed method is that the center position of the tip can be calibrated by using a kinematic seat with an inverted cone hole without any external reference and auxiliary devices. Calibration is based on that the distance between the tip center and that of any LED is invariable when the light-pen is swung smoothly with its spherical tip firmly touching the fixed <b>cone</b> <b>seat.</b> To ensure the repeatability of the algorithm some error constraint parameters are given. Based on invariable distances, the tip center position in the light-pen coordinate system can be obtained. Experiment results show that the self-calibration method has the advantage of good repeatability, with standard deviations 0. 027, 0. 023 and 0. 014 mm in U, V and W directions, respectively. Experimental results of measuring a circle and a gauge block indirectly demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed self-calibration method...|$|E
25|$|Hollow jet valves are {{a type of}} {{needle valve}} used for {{floodgate}} discharge. A <b>cone</b> and <b>seat</b> are inside a pipe. Water flows through an annular gap between the pipe and cone when it is moved downstream, away from the seat. Ribs support the bulb assembly and supply air for water jet stabilization.|$|R
40|$|The Large-scale Advanced Prop-fan (LAP) hub {{assembly}} forms a semi-rigid {{link between the}} blades, which provide the thrust, and the engine shaft, which provides the torque. The hub and tailshaft is a one piece partially forged part which is carburized, heat treated and machined. A single row ball bearing restrains {{each of the eight}} blades in the hub, while the tailshaft secures the propeller to the engine shaft with two <b>cone</b> <b>seats</b> that are preloaded against each other by the Prop-fan retaining nut. The hub also forms the support for the pitch change actuator system, the control and the spinner. The retention transmits the loads from the blades to the hub while allowing the changes in blade pitch. The single row ball bearing retention provides ease of maintenance by allowing individual blade replacement without dissassembly of the hub. It has a through hardened inner race which seats against the aluminum blade shank and an outer race which is integral with the barrel. The outer race area is carburized to achieve the hardness necessary to support the ball loads. The balls are kept from contact with each other by a separator. The rotational speed of the propeller keeps the retention submerged in the oil which is contained in the hub by a seal. Stress and strain analysis, material hardness requirements, weight predictions, and stiffness characteristics are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{considers}} some compact wedge-profiled seals for shafts and flanges of hydraulic machines {{made from}} light and durable material. Studies of the narrow-edged metal seals show that high tightness {{can be obtained}} with a minimum width of the contact. Under the high pressure of working fluid on the cylindrical surface, the compact wedge-profiled seals sag and completely adhere to the <b>cones</b> of <b>seats,</b> with ends slipping across the flat surfaces with no loss of integrity. The hollow portion available in the elastic characteristic enables us to reduce the contact stress (pressure) when compact wedge-profiled seals are used in movable joints, reducing friction and their wear...|$|R
5000|$|This is a Facebook game {{developed}} for EA Sports by Playfish. The game operates {{on a similar}} premise to the [...] "Ultimate Team" [...] mode that appears in the main FIFA games. Users collect trading cards that represent different players; each card has a statistical rating of the player's skills, contributing to an average team skill rating. The skill rating is augmented by a [...] "training" [...] rating, and {{the combination of the}} two ratings gives the overall team rating. These ratings determine the outcomes of matches played by the team; a team must win a certain number of matches to progress through a series of leagues, culminating with the [...] "Superstars" [...] league. Users may purchase new player cards with in-game [...] "coins", which are acquired through playing matches, winning leagues and as gifts from friends; the cards come in bronze, silver and gold packs, with bronze containing low-rated players and gold containing {{the best players in the}} game, although gold packs cost more coins. Coins may also be used to purchase training and stadium upgrades, such as training <b>cones</b> and <b>seating.</b> The game requires match credits, which can be earned by playfish cash, penalty shootouts, playing against your friends or simply waiting over time. The game was released in February 2010. The game has gone offline at the end of March 2013, with very lousy services and lots of user complaints on the forum.|$|R
