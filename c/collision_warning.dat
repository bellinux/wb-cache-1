Drivers experienced four warning conditions: no warning, visual, auditory, and tactile. The warnings activated when the time-to-collision (TTC) reached a critical value of 3. 0 or 5. 0 s TTC. Driver reaction time (RT) was captured from the time the driver crossed the warning activation threshold to brake initiation.

40|$|Semantic {{auditory}} icons as {{warning signals}} Auditory icons with additional semantic {{information in the}} context of <b>collision</b> <b>warnings</b> will be tested in a driving simulator and for this reason methodological questions shall be discussed. Auditory icons as warning signals can lead to fast responses, but in some cases they can also elicit inadequate behaviour (Graham, 1999; Ulfvengren, 2003). Stevens, Brennan & Parker (2004) have shown the potential benefit of “enriching ” auditory icons with information by manipulating acoustic parameters in a laboratory setting. An example is variation of frequency to induce the impression of size. An interesting question is whether benefits realized in the laboratory also arise in a more realistic setting, such as a driving simulator. Therefore the objective of my first study is to test the ability of auditory icons with enriched additional information (distance and direction) in leading to fast and adequate responses when used as <b>collision</b> <b>warnings</b> in a realistic driving scenario. In a pilot study, several auditory icons were chosen which will be used in a simulator study. The next step in designing the simulator study is to generate collision situations and to map these with appropriate auditory icons. I would like to discuss the following aspects...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{research}} {{demonstrates that}} auditory and vibrotactile forward <b>collision</b> <b>warnings</b> presenting a motion signal (e. g., looming or apparent motion across the body surface) can facilitate speeded braking reaction times (BRTs). The {{purpose of the}} present study was to expand on this work by directly comparing warning signals in which the motion conveyed was constant across all collision events with signals in which the speed of motion was dependent on the closing velocity (CV). Two experiments were conducted using a simulated car-following task and BRTs were measured. In Experiment 1, increasing intensity (looming) vibrotactile signals were presented from a single tactor attached to the driver's waist. When the increase in intensity was CV-linked, BRTs were significantly faster as compared to a no-warning condition, however, they were not significantly different from constant intensity and CV-independent looming warnings. In Experiment 2, a vertical array of three tactors was used to create motion either towards (upwards) or away (downwards) from the driver's head. When the warning signal presented upwards motion that was CV-linked, BRTs were significantly faster than all other warning types. Downwards warnings led to a significantly higher number of brake activations in false alarm situations as compared to upwards moving warnings. The effectiveness of dynamic tactile <b>collision</b> <b>warnings</b> would therefore appear to depend on both the link between the <b>warning</b> and <b>collision</b> event and on the directionality of the warning signal...|$|R

30|$|The {{statistics}} for road accidents in the United States in 2010 is shocking: 32, 999 killed, 3.9 million injured, and 24 million vehicles damaged, the tangible and intangible costs of which total $ 277 billion [37]. This cost burden has a ripple effect, {{having an impact}} on productivity, medical costs, legal and court costs, workplace losses, emergency service costs, the congestion burden, insurance administration costs, and property damage. A downward trend in the number of crashes in the United States [38] is significantly indebted to the adoption of new technologies such as airbags, anti-lock brakes, electronic stability control, 8 head-protection side air bags, and forward <b>collision</b> <b>warnings</b> [39, 40]. These are features that will be adopted in AV technology. In particular, some studies estimate the reduction of crashes could be as high as one-third if all vehicles are equipped with adaptive headlights, 9 forward <b>collision</b> 10 <b>warnings,</b> lane departure warnings 11, and blind spot assistance 12 [39, 40, 41] which are attributed to Level 0 or Level 1 vehicle automation.
