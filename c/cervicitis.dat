5|$|In {{women with}} <b>cervicitis</b> (inflammation of the cervix) or {{vaginitis}} (inflammation of the vagina) and in {{young men with}} UTI symptoms, a Chlamydia trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrheae infection may be the cause. These infections are typically classified as a urethritis rather than a urinary tract infection. Vaginitis may also {{be due to a}} yeast infection. Interstitial cystitis (chronic pain in the bladder) may be considered for people who experience multiple episodes of UTI symptoms but urine cultures remain negative and not improved with antibiotics. Prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate) may also be considered in the differential diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Inflammation of the cervix is {{referred}} to as <b>cervicitis.</b> This inflammation may be of the endocervix or ectocervix. When associated with the endocervix, it is associated with a mucous vaginal discharge and the sexually transmitted infections such as chlamydia and gonorrhoea. As many as half of pregnant women having a gonorrheal infection of the cervix are asymptomatic. Other causes include overgrowth of the commensal flora of the vagina. When associated with the ectocervix, inflammation may be caused by the herpes simplex virus. Inflammation is often investigated through directly visualising the cervix using a speculum, which may appear whiteish due to exudate, and by taking a Pap smear and examining for causal bacteria. Special tests may be used to identify particular bacteria. If the inflammation is due to a bacterium, then antibiotics may be given as treatment.|$|E

50|$|Mycoplasma genitalium {{is a small}} {{pathogenic}} bacterium that lives on the ciliated epithelial cells of the urinary and genital tracts in humans. Its existence was first reported in 1981, and was eventually identified as a new species of Mycoplasma in 1983. It can cause significant morbidity in men and women, and is a co-factor in HIV transmission. It is still controversial {{whether or not this}} bacterium is to be recognized as a sexually transmitted pathogen. Specifically, it causes urethritis in both men and women, and also <b>cervicitis</b> and pelvic inflammation in women. Its complete genome sequence was published in 1995 (size 0.58 Mbp, with 475 genes). It was regarded as a cellular unit with the smallest genome size (in Mbp) until 2003 when a new species of Archaea, namely Nanoarchaeum equitans, was sequenced (0.49 Mbp, with 540 genes).|$|E

50|$|Infection with M. genitalium {{sometimes}} produces clinical symptoms, or {{a combination}} of symptoms, but sometimes can be asymptomatic. It causes inflammation in the urethra (urethritis) both in men and women, which is associated with mucopurulent discharge in the urinary tract, and burning while urinating. In women, it causes <b>cervicitis</b> and pelvic inflammatory diseases, including endometritis and salpingitis. Women may also experience bleeding after sex and it is also suspected with tubal factor infertility. For men, the most common signs are painful urination or a watery discharge from the penis. Polymerase chain reaction analyses indicated that it is a cause of acute non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU) and probably chronic NGU. Unlike other Mycoplasma, the infection is not associated with bacterial vaginosis. It is highly associated with the intensity of HIV infection. It is also suspected {{to play a role in}} the development of prostate and ovarian cancers and lymphomas.|$|E
50|$|Mucopurulent <b>cervicitis</b> (MPC) is {{characterized}} by a purulent or mucopurulent endocervical exudate visible in the endocervical canal or in an endocervical swab specimen. Some specialists also diagnose MPC on the basis of easily induced cervical bleeding. Although some specialists consider an increased number of polymorphonuclear white blood cells on endocervical Gram stain as being useful in the diagnosis of MPC, this criterion has not been standardized, has a low positive-predictive value (PPV), and is not available in some settings. MPC often is without symptoms, but some women have an abnormal vaginal discharge and vaginal bleeding (e.g., after sexual intercourse). MPC can be caused by Chlamydia trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrhoeae; however, in most cases neither organism can be isolated. MPC can persist despite repeated courses of antimicrobial therapy. Because relapse or reinfection with C. trachomatis or N. gonorrhoeae usually does not occur in persons with persistent cases of MPC, other non-microbiologic determinants (e.g., inflammation in the zone of ectopy) might be involved.|$|E

BMC Infectious Diseases [en línea]. 2013, vol. 13, 20 p. ISSN 1471 - 2334. Background: <b>Cervicitis</b> is a syndrome of cervical inflammation {{and a common}} condition in female sex workers (FSW), a subpopulation vulnerable to sexually transmitted infections. Local data is essential for guiding syndromic management of <b>cervicitis</b> in FSW working in Peru. We sought to describe the prevalence and etiologies of <b>cervicitis</b> in this population. We also aimed to identify sociodemographic, behavioral and biological factors associated with <b>cervicitis,</b> including bacterial vaginosis (BV), a condition with a possible role in <b>cervicitis.</b> Methods: FSW 18 {{years of age or}} older presenting to a free public sexual health clinic in Callao-Lima, Peru were eligible for inclusion upon consent. 467 participants completed a face-to-face questionnaire and underwent genital examination. Vaginal, endocervical and blood samples were collected and tested for C. trachomatis (CT), N. gonorrhea (GC), T. vaginalis (TV), BV, HIV and Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus − 1. Logistic regression was used to determine whether sociodemographic, behavioral, or other sexual health related characteristics were associated with the diagnosis of <b>cervicitis.</b> Results: <b>Cervicitis</b> was detected in 99 (24. 9 %) of 397 FSW. The presence of <b>cervicitis</b> was unable to be determined in 70 participants. In women with <b>cervicitis,</b> CT was present in 4. 6 % (4 / 87), TV in 4. 0 % (4 / 99), GC in 0 % (0 / 87) and no pathogen was detected on cervical microbiology in 91. 9 % (91 / 99). BV was detected on vaginal microbiology in 36. 9 % (31 / 84) of <b>cervicitis</b> cases. BV was more common in women with <b>cervicitis,</b> however this association did not reach statistical significance (aOR[*]=[*] 1. 47 [0. 87, 2. 48], p[*]=[*] 0. 15). Other STI were not associated with <b>cervicitis.</b> Regular clinic attendance (aOR[*]=[*] 0. 54 [0. 34, 0. 87], p[*]=[*] 0. 01) and Ecuadorian nationality (aOR[*]=[*] 0. 31 [0. 13, 0. 76], p[*]=[*] 0. 01) were associated with reduced risk of <b>cervicitis.</b> Conclusions: <b>Cervicitis</b> was common in FSW working Peru and was predominantly nongonococcal and non-chlamydial in etiology. Further study is warranted to clarify the role of BV and other emerging <b>cervicitis</b> pathogens in this population. The current Peruvian program of free health checks for FSW may be effective for reducing rates of <b>cervicitis.</b> The protective effect of Ecuadorian nationality prompts further study...|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} several years, the {{collective}} understanding of <b>cervicitis</b> has extended beyond the recognition of Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae as the prime etiologic suspects. Trichomonas vaginalis and herpes simplex virus cause <b>cervicitis,</b> and both Mycoplasma genitalium and bacterial vaginosis have emerged as new candidate etiologic agents or conditions. However, major gaps in our knowledge of this common condition remain. Putative etiologic agents have not been identified in many women with <b>cervicitis.</b> Moreover, <b>cervicitis</b> occurs in a relatively small proportion of women with chlamydia or gonorrhea.
