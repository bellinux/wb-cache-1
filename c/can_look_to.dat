25|$|To {{deal with}} the use of {{different}} graphemes for the same Unihan sememe, Unicode has relied on several mechanisms: especially as it relates to rendering text. One has been to treat it as simply a font issue so that different fonts might be used to render Chinese, Japanese or Korean. Also font formats such as OpenType allow for the mapping of alternate glyphs according to language so that a text rendering system <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>to</b> the user's environmental settings to determine which glyph to use. The problem with these approaches is that they fail to meet the goals of Unicode to define a consistent way of encoding multilingual text.|$|E
500|$|Criss {{discussed}} his personal connection with Blaine {{in an interview}} with Vanity Fair. He explained that he grew up among the [...] "gay community", being with theater performers, so was raised without a concept of sexuality being an issue. Criss stated that, although he identifies as straight, [...] "it really doesn't come into play with me in this role. As an actor, your objective is always to play the scene. And this in case, he happens to be a gay teen." [...] Talk show host and media personality Ellen DeGeneres deemed Blaine [...] "a very confident gay teen, which is something you don't see much on television." [...] However, Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times assessed that [...] "despite the image he projects, he, too, is just a kid trying to figure things out as he goes along." [...] Criss feels that Blaine's confidence is an important aspect of his character, as it is rare for gay teenagers on television to be so [...] "sure of themselves." [...] He hopes that [...] "all the kids struggling with this issue <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>to</b> a guy like Blaine and feel [...] by his confidence." ...|$|E

500|$|Much of Durkheim's work, however, remains {{unacknowledged}} in philosophy, {{despite its}} direct relevance. As proof one <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>to</b> John Searle, {{who wrote a}} book The Construction of Social Reality, in which he elaborates a theory of social facts and collective representations that he {{believed to be a}} landmark work that would bridge the gap between analytic and continental philosophy. Neil Gross however, demonstrates how Searle's views on society are more or less a reconstitution of Durkheim's theories of social facts, social institutions, collective representations and the like. Searle's ideas are thus open to the same criticisms as Durkheim's. Searle responded by saying that Durkheim's work was worse than he had originally believed, and, admitting that he had not read much of Durkheim's work, said that, [...] "Because Durkheim’s account seemed so impoverished I did not read any further in his work." [...] Stephen Lukes, however, responded to Searle's response to Gross and refutes point by point the allegations that Searle makes against Durkheim, essentially upholding the argument of Gross, that Searle's work bears great resemblance to that of Durkheim's. Lukes attributes Searle's miscomprehension of Durkheim's work to the fact that Searle, quite simply, never read Durkheim.|$|E

2500|$|The {{issue of}} whether the President has power to speak up {{publicly}} on issues {{that he may have}} with the Government without Cabinet approval surfaced during the 2011 presidential election. One candidate, Tan Kin Lian, sparked off the debate by saying that the President should be entitled to do so as the President [...] "represents the views of the people". Similarly, another candidate, Tan Jee Say, promised to be the [...] "conscience of the people" [...] and commented that for controversial issues such as the building of casinos the President's views should be taken into consideration and that he should be allowed to air them in public. Candidate Tan Cheng Bock expressed his opinion in a Facebook posting that read: [...] "he president must be seen not as a figurehead but as somebody the people <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>to</b> for support for some of the issues, national problems and so on.... I would like to play a much bigger role to engage Singaporeans and have them come to talk to the president". Tony Tan Keng Yam, who was eventually elected President, took a more conservative view and stated that the President ought to work within the Constitution.|$|E
50|$|When some {{characters}} are placed {{next to each}} other, seen together at a glance they give the visual impression of another, unrelated character.

2500|$|The JDL encourages, per its {{principle}} of the [...] "Love of Jewry," [...] that [...] "...in the end...the Jew <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>to</b> no one but another Jew for help and that the true solution to the Jewish problem is the liquidation of the Exile {{and the return of}} all Jews to Eretz Yisroel – the land of Israel." [...] The JDL elaborates on this fundamental principle by insisting upon an [...] "immediate need to place Judaism over any other 'ism' and ideology and...use of the yardstick: 'Is it good for Jews?'" [...] The JDL argues that, outside of Jews, there are historically no people corresponding to the Palestinian ethnicity. Writing on its official website, the JDL claims: [...] "he first mention of a 'Palestinian people' dates from the aftermath of the 1967 war, when the local Arabic-speaking communities ... were retrospectively endowed with a contrived 'nationhood' ... taken from Jewish history ..." [...] and that [...] "learly, since Roman times 'Palestinian' had meant Jews until the Arab's recent adoption of this identity in order to claim it as their land." [...] On this basis, the JDL argues that [...] "Zionism [...] under no obligation to accommodate a separate 'Palestinian' claim, there being no historical evidence or witness for any such Arab category," [...] and it considers Palestinian claims to be [...] "Arab usurpation" [...] of proper Jewish title.|$|E
2500|$|At {{least five}} notable bands have named {{themselves}} {{in tribute to}} Can: The Mooney Suzuki for Malcolm Mooney and Damo Suzuki; the indie rock band Spoon after the hit [...] "Spoon"; the electronic band Egebamyasi, formed by Scottish musician Mr Egg in 1984, after Can's album Ege Bamyasi; Hunters & Collectors after a song on the Landed album; and Moonshake, named for a track on Future Days, and formed by ex-Wolfhounds frontman David Callahan. The Scottish writer Alan Warner has written two novels in tribute to two different Can members (Morvern Callar to Holger Czukay and The Man Who Walks to Michael Karoli respectively). The Sacrilege remix album features remixes of Can tracks by artists who were influenced by Can, including Sonic Youth and U.N.K.L.E.. Their ethnomusicological tendencies pre-date the craze for world music in the 1980s. While not nearly as influential on electronic music as Kraftwerk, they were important early pioneers of ambient music, along with Tangerine Dream and the aforementioned band. Many groups working in the post-rock genre <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>to</b> Can as an influence {{as part of the}} larger krautrock scene, as can New Prog bands such as The Mars Volta. Rolling Stone called the group a [...] "pioneering space rock band." [...] Kanye West has sampled [...] "Sing Swan Song" [...] on his song [...] "Drunk & Hot Girls" [...] from his 2007 album Graduation. The UK band Loop was deeply influenced by Can for their repetitive polyrhythmic style, covering Can's [...] "Mother Sky" [...] on their Fade Out album.|$|E

By Louis's desire, he inquired into Oliver's intentions. 'Must stay here,' was the answer. 'Can't leave that child alone with the property. I <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>to</b> the Equatorial Company here--must do without me out there.

60|$|A glacier is a {{river of}} ice,--really and truly {{a river of}} ice,--sometimes two or three miles wide, and fifteen or twenty miles long, with many {{branches}} coming into it. Its bed is a steep valley, commencing far up among the mountains in a region of everlasting ice and snow, and ending in some warm and pleasant valley far below, where the warm sun beats upon the terminus of it and melts the ice away {{as fast as it}} comes down. It flows very slowly, not usually more than an inch in an hour. The warm summer sun beams upon the upper surface of it, melting it slowly away, and forming vast fissures and clefts in it, down which you <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>to</b> the bottom, if you only have courage to go near enough to the slippery edge. If you do not dare to do this, you can get a large stone and throw it in; and then, if you stand still and listen, you hear it thumping and thundering against the sides of the crevasse until it gets too deep to be any longer heard. You cannot hear it strike the bottom; for it is sometimes seven or eight hundred feet through the thickness of the glacier to the ground below.|$|E
