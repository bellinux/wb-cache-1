5|$|It {{is largely}} unknown how baleen whales produce sound {{because of the}} lack of a melon and vocal <b>cords.</b> In a 2007 study, it was {{discovered}} that the larynx had U-shaped folds which are thought to be similar to vocal <b>cords.</b> They are positioned parallel to air flow, as opposed to the perpendicular vocal <b>cords</b> of terrestrial mammals. These may control air flow and cause vibrations. The walls of the larynx are able to contract which may generate sound with support from the arytenoid cartilages. The muscles surrounding the larynx may expel air rapidly or maintain a constant volume while diving.|$|E
5|$|Several {{observers}} (including Plait and Tyson) {{said that}} in the scene in which Kowalski unclips his tether and floats away to his death to save Stone from being pulled away from the ISS, Stone would simply need to tug the tether gently to pull Kowalski toward her. According to the film's science adviser Kevin Grazier and NASA engineer Robert Frost, however, the pair are still decelerating with Stone's leg caught in the parachute <b>cords</b> from the Soyuz. The <b>cords</b> stretch as they absorb her kinetic energy. Kowalski thinks that the <b>cords</b> are not strong enough to absorb his kinetic energy as well as hers, and that he must release the tether to give Stone a chance of stopping before the <b>cords</b> fail and doom both of them.|$|E
5|$|The {{central nervous}} system {{consists}} of a brain and paired ventral nerve <b>cords</b> that connect to the brain and run {{along the length of}} the body. The brain is a ring of four ganglia, masses of nerve cells, positioned round the rhynchocoel near its front end – while the brains of most protostome invertebrates encircle the foregut. Most nemertean species have just one pair of nerve <b>cords,</b> many species have additional paired <b>cords,</b> and some species also have a dorsal cord. In some species the <b>cords</b> lie within the skin, but in most they are deeper, inside the muscle layers. The {{central nervous system}} is often red or pink because it contains hemoglobin. This stores oxygen for peak activity or when the animal experiences anoxia, for example while burrowing in oxygen-free sediments.|$|E

40|$|Introduction. To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} complex umbilical <b>cord</b> entanglement primarily around the trunk on pregnancy outcomes. Methods. We studied 6307 pregnant women with singleton pregnancies who underwent vaginal delivery of an infant at ≥ 37 weeks of gestation. Cases were classified into no <b>cord,</b> nuchal <b>cord,</b> and body <b>cord</b> groups and defined as cases without umbilical <b>cord</b> entanglement, one or more loops of the umbilical <b>cord</b> around the neck only, and umbilical <b>cord</b> around the trunk only, respectively. Pregnancy outcomes were compared among these three groups. Results. The no <b>cord,</b> nuchal <b>cord,</b> and body <b>cord</b> group included 4733, 1451, and 123 pregnancies, respectively. Although delivery mode was not significantly different among the three groups, 1 -minute Apgar scores < 7 and umbilical artery (UA) pH < 7. 10 were significantly {{more common in the}} umbilical <b>cord</b> entanglement groups than in the no <b>cord</b> group. In particular, the frequency of 5 -minute Apgar scores < 7 was significantly higher (P= 0. 004), whereas that of UA pH < 7. 10 tended to be higher (P= 0. 057) in the body <b>cord</b> group than in the nuchal <b>cord</b> group.

5000|$|<b>Cord</b> blood banking {{refers to}} the {{collection}} at birth, processing, testing, cryopreservation and storage of stem cells from the umbilical <b>cord</b> blood. <b>Cord</b> blood, also called [...] "placental blood", is blood that remains in the umbilical <b>cord</b> and placenta following {{the birth of a}} baby and after the umbilical <b>cord</b> is cut. During pregnancy, the umbilical <b>cord</b> functions as a lifeline between mother and child.

40|$|SummaryThe {{incidence}} of placenta and umbilical <b>cord</b> abnormalities {{is high in}} abnormal course of the delivery. Although the detection rate of umbilical <b>cord</b> abnormalities is steadily increasing with the improvement of ultrasound technology, {{and the fact that}} ultrasound scanning can distinguish umbilical <b>cord</b> conditions, this information has not exerted much impact on the management of labor to date. We believe prenatal detection of umbilical <b>cord</b> abnormalities must reduce the number of emergent cesarean sections and intrauterine fetal death. In this review, we describe the ultrasound diagnosis and management of major umbilical <b>cord</b> abnormalities, including abnormalities of <b>cord</b> insertion site (velamentous and marginal <b>cord</b> insertion), hypercoiled <b>cord</b> and nuchal <b>cord,</b> considering the current knowledge on physiologic and pathologic aspects of each umbilical <b>cord</b> abnormality...|$|R

5|$|Clergy of the Church of England {{who were}} not bishops {{historically}} bore arms identical to a layman, with a shield, helm and crest, and no ecclesiastical hat. In England in 1976 a system for deans, archdeacons and canons was authorized by the College of Arms, allowing a black ecclesiastical hat, black or violet <b>cords,</b> and three violet or red tassels on each side. A priest uses {{a black and white}} cord with a single tassel on each side, and a deacon a hat without tassels. A Doctor of Divinity may have <b>cords</b> interwoven with red and a hat appropriate to the degree, and members of the Ecclesiastical Household add a Tudor rose {{on the front of the}} hat.

For treatment of several intractable autoimmune diseases (e. g., rheumatoid arthritis), where inflammatory cytokines are involved in disease progression, anti-inflammatory cytokine antagonist is now available. Hence, there is great potential of anti-inflammatory cytokine antagonist for therapeutic use of spinal <b>cord</b> IRI.
