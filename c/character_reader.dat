50|$|Optical {{character}} recognition (also optical <b>character</b> <b>reader,</b> OCR) is the mechanical or electronic conversion {{of images of}} typed, handwritten or printed text into machine-encoded text, whether from a scanned document, {{a photo of a}} document, a scene-photo (for example the text on signs and billboards in a landscape photo) or from subtitle text superimposed on an image (for example from a television broadcast). It is widely used as a form of information entry from printed paper data records, whether passport documents, invoices, bank statements, computerised receipts, business cards, mail, printouts of static-data, or any suitable documentation. It is a common method of digitising printed texts {{so that they can be}} electronically edited, searched, stored more compactly, displayed on-line, and used in machine processes such as cognitive computing, machine translation, (extracted) text-to-speech, key data and text mining. OCR is a field of research in pattern recognition, artificial intelligence and computer vision.|$|E

50|$|Remote Bar Coding System (RBCS), {{also called}} Remote Video Encoding (RVE) {{is a method}} used by the United States Postal Service to encode the address of letter-sized mailpieces that are not decipherable by a Multiline Optical <b>Character</b> <b>Reader</b> (MLOCR). When an MLOCR does not {{recognize}} a valid address on a letter, (usually due to hand-written addressing) it sends {{an image of the}} mailpiece to a central RBCS (RVE) site where more sophisticated optical character recognition software is able to interpret many hand-written addresses using neural net and fuzzy logic algorithms. If this does not succeed, human operators visually examine the image and enter the address. In both cases, the data is sent back to the originating mail facility where mailpieces are then automatically matched back up with data {{through the use of a}} unique fluorescent barcode printed on the back during initial MLOCR attempt, and receive a POSTNET barcode representing the full address.|$|E
5000|$|In 1983, the U.S. Postal Service {{introduced}} an expanded ZIP Code system that it called ZIP+4, often called [...] "plus-four codes", [...] "add-on codes", or [...] "add ons".A ZIP+4 Code uses the basic five-digit code plus four additional digits {{to identify a}} geographic segment within the five-digit delivery area, such as a city block, a group of apartments, an individual high-volume receiver of mail or any other unit that could use an extra identifier to aid in efficient mail sorting and delivery. But initial attempts to promote universal use of the new format met with public resistance and today the plus-four code is not required. In general, mail is read by a multiline optical <b>character</b> <b>reader</b> (MLOCR) that almost instantly determines the correct ZIP+4 Code from the address—along with the even more specific delivery point—and sprays an Intelligent Mail barcode (IM) {{on the face of}} the mail piece that corresponds to 11 digits—nine for the ZIP+4 Code and two for the delivery point.|$|E
5000|$|Proper Placement: The Delivery Address {{should be}} {{left-justified}} and located roughly {{in the center}} of mailpiece's largest side. More precisely, on a letter-size piece, the recommended address placement is within the optical <b>character</b> <b>reader</b> (OCR) read area, which is a space on the address side of the mailpiece defined by these boundaries: Left - 1/2 inch (13 mm) from the left edge of the piece; Right - 1/2 inch (13 mm) from the right edge of the piece; Top - 2-3/4 inches (70 mm) from the bottom edge of the piece; Bottom - 5/8 inch (16 mm) from the bottom edge of the piece. Preferred placement of a return address is in the upper left portion of the mailpiece—on the side of the piece bearing postage. Finally, postage (e.g., stamps, meter imprints, information-based indicia IBI, etc.) is to be affixed in the upper right corner of the address side of the mail cover. It should be noted that any stamp/indicia partly concealed or otherwise obscured by an overlapping stamp/indicia may not be counted as valid postage.|$|E
