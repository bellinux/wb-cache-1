40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the effects}} of pressure surge on pipe flow. The surge pressure investigated is that propagated by the emergency relief <b>coupling</b> <b>valve</b> (ERV) connected to a loading system carrying crude oil from four flow stations. The results of the analysis show remarkable changes in the fluid parameters arising from the shut down of the loading system by the ERV {{in the event of}} storm. For instance, in pipe 1 the pressure dropped from an initial value of 25 × 105 N/m 2 to 19 × 105 N/m 2, while the velocity of flow increased from 1. 76 m/s to 2. 97 m/s. The system showed high Reynolds number indicating turbulent flow and the Mach number in pipe IV as high as 3. 6 indicating supersonic flow. The consequence of the pressure drop is column separation or cavitations. If the bubbles collapse, re-surge pressures occur leading to possible leakages and rupture of the pipes. All these can be minimized by selecting appropriate surge suppression devices for the system...|$|E

A close <b>coupled</b> <b>valve</b> {{is included in the}} Moore-Greitzer compression system model and controllers for both surge and rotating stall is derived using backstepping.

40|$|AbstractThis report {{presents}} {{details of}} one aspect, namely, the flexible riser pipe pickup system, {{of a proposed}} ship-based carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) method. The liquefied CO 2 (LCO 2) to be sequestered is directly injected into subseabed geological formations through a flexible riser pipe using injection facilities contained onboard an LCO 2 carrier ship. The flexible riser pipe remains on the seabed, one end attached to the injection wellhead, until the other end is hoisted up and connected to the (dynamic positioning system (DPS) -controlled) LCO 2 carrier ship arriving at the ocean injection site. This proposed system has various advantages {{over the use of}} stationary sea surface structures for ship mooring and CO 2 injection: i) no need for stationary sea surface structures, e. g., ship-mooring-buoy or platform; ii) simplifies ship handling, especially in rougher sea states; and iii) the flexible riser pipe can remain on the seabed in rough seas. Details of a pickup buoy system for retrieving the riser from the seabed and the structure of the flexible riser pipe are presented in this paper. The riser pickup system consists basically of shipboard equipment such as a <b>coupling</b> <b>valve,</b> crane, winches and A-frame and offshore equipment such as a pickup buoy, pickup float, messenger line, sinker and pickup wire rope.

40|$|In this thesis, the {{compressor}} characteristics, being representations of {{the compressor}} pressure ratio {{as a function of}} the gas ﬂow through the compressor, have been studied. Three diﬀerent types of {{representations of the}} compressor characteristics are presented, implemented and tested with respect to simulation friendliness and eﬀectiveness. These are based on a physical model, a 4 th-order polynomial approximation method and a table lookup method. In addition, two diﬀerent types of active surge controllers have been critically reviewed, i. e. the Close <b>Coupled</b> <b>Valve</b> (CCV) and the Drive Torque Actuation, and subsequently implemented and tested in SIMULINK. Based on the tests carried out on the compressor characteristics it is concluded that the 4 th-order polynomial approximation method works best in an online environment. On the other hand, the table lookup method provides better representation of the actual data, but the method is somewhat slower compared to the other one. The usefulness of the physical model is limited, but together with parameter identiﬁcation its applicability can be extended. Moreover, the active surge controllers have proved to be mathematically stable and shown to perform adequately. However, both face a problem with regard to measurement delay. Based on simulations and other considerations, the indications are that the drive torque actuation is the most promising solution for active surge control and should thus be the focus for further investigations. A possible solution for the measurement delay problem is to use a state observer. As a part of the thesis, two state observers have been implemented and tested, but with limited success. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} are to identify the dynamics of a Tenneco Automotive hydraulic damper valve and to predict valve performance. Accurate simulations of damper valve performance can be used to improve valve designs without the expense of physical testing. The Tenneco damper valve consists of thin shims and a spring preloaded disc that restricts fluid from exiting the main flow orifices. The deflection of the shims and spring are dependent on the flow-rate through the valve. The pressure distribution acting on the deformable valve components is investigated numerically using a dynamic modelling technique. This technique involves sequential geometry and simulation updating, while varying both the geometry and flow-rate. The valve deflection is calculated by post-processing the pressure distribution.

40|$|Most commercially {{available}} valves {{are able to}} produce a large flow rate or a fast response, but are incapable of producing both simultaneously. Commercially available valves that can achieve both are expensive as they require multiple stages of actuation and piloting pressures to deliver large flow rates quickly, preventing them from being broadly used in fluid power applications. This work investigates the design of an Energy <b>Coupling</b> Actuated <b>Valve</b> (ECAV) {{that is capable of}} solving this trade-off between large flow and fast switching times through the use of an innovative, high performance actuation system. The ECAV is a new development in valve technology in the area of hydraulic, high speed, proportional and digital on/off valves. High speed actuation is produced through the intermittent coupling of a kinetic energy source with a translational poppet or spool. This coupling process occurs through the use of magnetorheological fluid and a controlled magnetic flux through the fluid in the energy coupler. The ECAV has several design advantages including proportional force control and a large (7 mm) stroke capability.

The principles and instrumentation of flow injection analysis are presented with particular emphasis on multi-detemiinations and process applications. Flow injection analysis with Fourier transform infrared detection is proposed as a potential on-line monitoring technique highlighting its ability for simultaneous multi-analyte determinations. The principles of chemometric data analysis are summarised in Chapter Two along with the systematic approach to data analysts used in this thesis. Algorithms for experimental design, data pre-processing, exploratory data analysis (RCA) and multivariate calibration (PGR and PLS 1) are described. Chapter Three describes the development and optimisation of an automated flow injection manifold coupled with a Fourier transform infrared detector for the determination of toluene, ethyl benzene and o-xylene in an n-hexane matrix by univariate calibration. In addition, Fourier transform infrared spectra are acquired of experimentally designed synthetic mixtures of the above analytes using the automated Fl manifold, and the multivariate calibration algorithms PGR, PLS 1 and PLS 2 are employed to quantify individual species. A critical evaluation of spectral preprocessing algorithms is reported. The following chapter describes {{the development of an}} automated internally <b>coupled</b> <b>valve</b> flow injection manifold, with Fourier transform infrared detection, for the determination of sucrose in aqueous matrices. Chapter Four describes the optimisation of the data acquisition system and reports on the critical comparison of univariate and multivariate calibration approaches, and results are presented for the determination of sucrose in commercially available fruit juices. The on-line monitoring of the synthesis of sodium glycinate in water using Fourier transform detection is described in Chapter Five. Fourier transform infrared spectral analysis of the reaction using continuous flow analysis with real time Gram Schmidt data analysis is compared to the results acquired via an automated flow injection manifold. The use of a simplex designed calibration set to mimic spectral changes in the reaction mixture to facilitate multivariate calibration is also presented. Chapter Six compares the analytical performance of a thermostabilised attenuated total reflectance flow cell with a water cooled mid-infrared fibre optic probe. Univariate and multivariate calibration algorithms are used to process reaction data sets along with gas chromatographic reference data. A detailed discussion of proposed approaches to reduce analysis time and increase information in reaction development programs is presented. The thesis concludes with an investigation of the quantitative nature of Raman spectroscopy. Experimentally designed calibration sets containing aqueous herbicide formulation samples are analysed in glass vials, with a critical evaluation of long term instrumental stability measured in terms of reproducibility and repeatability.
