50|$|A zombie fund (more {{formally}} {{known as}} a <b>closed</b> <b>fund)</b> is a colloquial expression for a with-profits life insurance fund that is closed to new business. It is therefore running off its portfolio of insurance liabilities, but not issuing new policies, until the final policy matures, which may be many years into the future.|$|E

40|$|Since many {{commercial}} datasets still {{include only}} those funds {{that are currently}} in operation, survivorship bias {{is an important issue}} in studies of mutual fund performance. This article is the first to systematically examine the existence, significance, and the drivers of survivorship bias by applying the various different methods and definitions used in previous research on a uniform fund dataset (CRSP). We show that there is significant survivorship bias when closed funds are ignored, and that the choice of methods and definitions is crucial for the magnitude of the survivorship bias estimates. Furthermore we examine in detail the performance and fund size of closed funds which drives survivorship bias. Closed funds clearly underperform surviving funds years before they are actually <b>closed.</b> <b>Fund</b> size is a key characteristic for closing decisions. The larger a fund, the lower the likelihood that funds are closed, even if the returns are temporarily relatively low...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} the first to {{systematically}} test the significance of survivorship bias using a comprehensive database and to test the significance of the differences of survivorship biases resulting from different methodical approaches. We apply the various methods most commonly used in the literature on a uniform dataset. In addition, we analyze the performance of <b>closed</b> <b>funds</b> as the driver of survivorship bias and the performance of new funds as the driver of incubation bias. Our main findings are: i) Ignoring <b>closed</b> <b>funds</b> leads to a significantly positive survivorship bias. This is in line with previous research. ii) The choice of methods leads to statistically and economically significant differences in survivorship bias estimates. We are able to suggest a bias-minimizing combination of methods if survivorship bias-free data is not available. iii) The performance of <b>closed</b> <b>funds</b> drives survivorship bias since these funds underperform surviving funds years before they are closed. iv) We find evidence for incubation bias in our data but its impact is rather small and clearly depends on the methods applied...|$|R

40|$|The Vietnam {{stock market}} is a young and small stock market, but it has {{attracted}} much attention from the financial public. The Vietnam {{stock market is}} also one of the most volatile markets with 2 “bubbles” and 2 recessions within 1 year. <b>Closed</b> end <b>fund</b> is considered as a measure of the sentiment of individual investors (De Long, Shleifer, Summers, and Waldmann (1990)). <b>Closed</b> end <b>fund</b> is one of the shares that we can measure its fundamentals through the Net Asset Value (NAV). The <b>closed</b> end <b>fund</b> is traded at the discount of its NAV, and that discount is the sentiment of the investor with the market condition. However, according to the observations, during the most optimism of the stock market, there is a period that the <b>closed</b> end <b>fund</b> was traded at a premium, but in other optimistic period, even when the index boosted highly, the fund was still traded at a discount. This is not consistent with the findings of De Long and Shleifer (1990) about the relationship between <b>closed</b> end <b>fund</b> price changes and the stock market bubble in 1929. This paper investigates what drives the premia of the <b>closed</b> end <b>fund</b> in the Vietnamese stock market. In particular, the paper suggests some predictors that can influence the movement of the fund’s price. Emerging markets are attractive to foreign investors. Due to the small size of the markets, capital flows of the foreign investors influence very much on the price movement of the stocks, as well as the premia. The premia can be seen as a measure of the sentiment of the foreign investors toward the local market (Bleany and Smith, 2003). In the Vietnamese stock market, the trading volume of the foreign investors normally accounts for 20 % to 30 % of the total trading volume, and their behaviors have impact on the behavior of the local investors. And this seems to apply to the <b>closed</b> end <b>funds.</b> In the book “Irrational Exuberance”, Shiller (2000) raised the importance of the individuals’ sentiment on the stock price volatility. Vietnam is a new market which has lots of dividual investors. And their trading is influenced by the emotion This paper will show that the investors’ sentiment also play a part in driving the price of the funds as suggested by many literature on the <b>closed</b> end <b>funds</b> in the emerging markets...|$|R

50|$|When {{the asset}} base of an {{actively}} managed fund becomes too large, {{it begins to}} take on index-like characteristics because it must invest in an increasingly diverse set of investments instead of those limited to the fund manager's best ideas.
