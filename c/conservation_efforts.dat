5|$|<b>Conservation</b> <b>efforts</b> for Hydnellum are {{hindered}} {{by the fact}} that some species are difficult to discriminate in the field, making it hard to determine an appropriate conservation status. Techniques based on species-specific PCR primers and DNA extraction from soil have been developed to detect the mycelia of various Hydnellum species without having to rely on the presence of fruitbodies, which may help <b>conservation</b> <b>efforts</b> as well as improve understanding of below-ground ecology. Similar techniques have been used to show that, in the case of H.aurantiacum and H.caeruleum, the fungus can persist below the ground for at least four years without producing fruitbodies.|$|E

Treating <b>conservation</b> <b>effort</b> as a continuous variable, we show that risk aversion can mitigate the moral hazard problem in most cases. However, if <b>conservation</b> <b>effort</b> has a risk-increasing impact on production the effect of risk aversion on compliance is ambiguous...|$|R
