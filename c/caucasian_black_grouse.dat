40|$|Declines in {{populations of}} {{capercaillie}} (Tetrao urogallus) and <b>black</b> <b>grouse</b> (Lyrurus tetrix) {{have been reported}} from both Central Europe and the continuous boreal forests of Fennoscandia. While intensified land-use {{is assumed to be}} the underlying cause of these declines, the mechanisms are not yet understood. Predation is the proximate cause of mortality of eggs, chicks and adults throughout capercaillie and <b>black</b> <b>grouse</b> ranges, but the link between predation and habitat and/or climate change remains unclear. To investigate temporal trends in reproductive output of woodland grouse, we collated previously published and unpublished data of reproduction in capercaillie and <b>black</b> <b>grouse</b> throughout their ranges from 1930 to 2012. We show that, overall, reproductive success has decreased and stabilized at low levels in most regions whilst capercaillie reproductive output in Scotland is still declining. With today’s net reproduction, capercaillie and <b>black</b> <b>grouse</b> adult survival is too low to compensate for reproduction declines. Consequently, populations are expected to further decline unless reproductive performances improve. We put our findings in the context of changes in land use, climate and generalist predator numbers. By critically reviewing how these factors limit reproductive success in capercaillie and <b>black</b> <b>grouse,</b> we hope to shed light on the underlying mechanisms causing the decline. Our results imply that measures should be undertaken to reduce mortality of capercaillie and <b>black</b> <b>grouse</b> chicks and eggs.

40|$|Large scale land use/cover {{changes and}} habitat {{fragmentation}} {{have been associated}} with the decline of many wildlife populations in ecological sensitive regions. The main goal {{of this study was to}} quantify the spatial pattern changes in <b>Caucasian</b> <b>Black</b> <b>Grouse</b> habitat in Arasbaran Biosphere Reserve, Northwest of Iran in a period of 24 years (1987 – 2011). <b>Caucasian</b> <b>black</b> <b>grouse</b> (Tetrao mlokosiewiczi) in Iran is restricted to the Arasbaran area, and the populations and range of this specialist bird species have been declining over the last decades. This study focuses on the landscape structure changes of black grouse habitat in Arasbaran Biosphere reserve. We used Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) satellite images from 1987 and 2011, and ETM+ from 2001, for analysis of the spatial patterns of land use/cover patches. The satellite images were geometrically corrected and classified. For quantifying landscape pattern changes, various landscape metrics were derived from spatial analysis software FRAGSTATS, including NP (Number of Patches), LPI (Largest Patch Index) and TE (Total Edge). The results indicated that the proportion of forest was significantly decreased from 39. 95 % to 31. 95 %, and proportion of grassland was decreased from 44. 45 % to 38. 44 % during the last 24 years, while proportion of dominated by astragalus was increased from 3. 30 % to 15. 65 %. Total Edge (TE) was decreased 8000 meters at altitude over 1800 meters. Our result provided quantitative data on habitat loss and landscape fragmentation in Arasbaran Biosphere reserve and indicated negative impacts of the landscape structure changes on Black grouse habitat...|$|E

40|$|<b>Black</b> <b>grouse</b> Tetrao tetrix is a {{bird species}} {{composed}} of large, continuous {{as well as}} severely reduced and fragmented populations, making it an optimal species to investigate how genetic diversity is affected by habitat fragmentation. I have focused on genetic diversity in the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) to measure {{the ability of the}} <b>black</b> <b>grouse</b> to respond to environmental changes. I partly characterized MHC class II in <b>black</b> <b>grouse</b> and found striking similarities with chicken MHC class II. I demonstrated that <b>black</b> <b>grouse</b> possess a similar compact MHC as chicken with few MHC class II B (BLB) and Y (YLB) loci. I did not find evidence of balancing selection in YLB so I concentrated further studies on BLB. I developed a PCR-based screening method for amplifying and separating expressed BLB alleles in European <b>black</b> <b>grouse</b> populations. Small fragmented populations had lost neutral genetic diversity (based on microsatellites and SNPs) compared to samples from the historical distribution and contemporary large populations. There was also a trend, albeit less pronounced, for reduced MHC diversity in these populations. Neutral markers in small isolated populations were affected by increased levels of genetic drift and were therefore genetically differentiated compared to other populations. MHC markers on the other hand, were not subjected to genetic drift to the same extent probably due a long historic process of balancing selection. Inferences of heterozygosity and evolutionary patterns as well as detailed correlations to reproductive success and diseases cannot be performed until MHC can be amplified in a locus-specific manner. Therefore, I developed a single locus sequence-based typing method for independently amplifying MHC class II B loci (BLB 1 and BLB 2). I found that BLB 1 and BLB 2 were duplicated in a common ancestor to chickens and <b>black</b> <b>grouse</b> and that these loci are subjected to homogenizing concerted evolution due to inter-genetic exchange between loci after species divergence.   I could also verify that both BLB 1 and BLB 2 were transcribed in <b>black</b> <b>grouse</b> and under balancing selection.

40|$|<b>Black</b> <b>grouse</b> (Tetrao tetrix) is a {{bird species}} with a lek mating system {{found in the}} Palearctic boreal taiga. It is assumed {{that it has a}} {{continuous}} distribution along Scandinavia and Siberia, whereas in Central Europe it has declined during the last decades. The primary objective of this thesis was to obtain {{a deeper understanding of the}} history, systematic classification and the genetic structure of <b>black</b> <b>grouse</b> on different geographical scales using microsatellites and control region mtDNA sequences (CR). I determined how much the mating system, habitat fragmentation and historical population processes have influenced the partitioning of genetic diversity in this species. Phylogeographical results are consistent with a demographic population expansion, and the patterns of postglacial dispersal suggest that a glacial refugium was located somewhere in central Asia, and from there <b>black</b> <b>grouse</b> spread out to Europe following the retreat of glacial ice sheets. I suggest that the two European <b>black</b> <b>grouse</b> subspecies, T. t. Tetrix and T. t. britannicus correspond to only one subspecies: T. t. tetrix, and that this lineage has diverged from T. t. viridanus, a subspecies found in Kazakhstan. The British population is significantly divergent from the remaining Eurasian samples for microsatellites but it is not for mtDNA. Therefore, they should regard as a separate Management Unit and not as a subspecies. Furthermore, British <b>black</b> <b>grouse</b> occur in three independent genetic units, corresponding to Wales, northern England/southern Scotland and northern Scotland. There was also genetic structure within Sweden. Habitat fragmentation is the main cause of population genetic structure in southern Swedish <b>black</b> <b>grouse.</b> In contrast, low levels of genetic differentiation and high connectivity were found in northern Sweden due to female-biased dispersal. On a finer geographical scale, I found genetic differences between leks due to a mixture of related and unrelated individuals within leks. However, mean relatedness values hardly differed from zero. Some leks were similar to one another and I interpret this as a result of variation in local reproductive success and philopatry. These factors would cause genetic structuring but this by itself would not reveal that kin selection is operating within <b>black</b> <b>grouse</b> leks...|$|R
