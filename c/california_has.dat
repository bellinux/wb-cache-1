5|$|The city of Visalia, <b>California</b> <b>has</b> {{implemented}} a street tree ordinance intended {{to promote and}} regulate the planting, maintenance, and protection of street trees within the city. Their ordinance does not allow street trees to be altered, pruned or removed. Street trees are also protected during construction.|$|E
5|$|Advancements in {{microscopic}} stamping {{have led}} to a push for the inclusion of firing pin microstamping. The microstamp is etched onto the firing pin and is transferred to the cartridge during the firing process. Each firing pin would have a unique serial number allowing investigators to trace casings found at a crime scene to a known firearm. The practice is not in use , although <b>California</b> <b>has</b> enacted legislation that requires microstamping on all newly sold firearms. The law, and microstamping in general, has received significant opposition from gun manufacturers due to increased costs associated with introducing the microstamps into the manufacturing lines.|$|E
5|$|<b>California</b> <b>has</b> been {{inhabited}} by numerous Native American peoples since antiquity. The Spanish, the Russians, and other Europeans began exploring and colonizing {{the area in}} the 16th and 17th centuries, with the Spanish establishing its first California mission at what is now San Diego in 1769. After the Mexican Cession of 1848, the California Gold Rush brought worldwide attention to the area. The growth of the movie industry in Los Angeles and Hollywood, high tech in Silicon Valley, tourism, agriculture, and other areas in the ensuing decades fueled the creation of a $1.85 trillion economy, the ninth-largest in the world.|$|E

5|$|<b>California</b> <b>has</b> {{experienced}} less possessory land claim litigation {{than other}} states. This is primarily {{the result of}} the Land Claims Act of 1851 (following the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo) that required all claims deriving from the Spanish and Mexican governments to be filed within two years. Three U.S. Supreme Court decisions and one Ninth Circuit ruling have held that the Land Claims Act applied to aboriginal title, and thus extinguished all aboriginal title in the state (as no tribes filed claims under the Act). Two Deputy Attorneys General of California have advocated this view.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{its history}} of {{generating}} great earthquakes (1857, 1906) {{the focal point}} of earthquake hazard assessment in <b>California</b> <b>has</b> been the strike-slip San Andreas System of faults. However, a system of faults, including the Sierra Madre–Cucamonga Fault System that runs along the border of the San Gabriel and San Fernando Valleys, has also caused a series of moderate to large events in the Greater Los Angeles Area. The westernmost portion of this fault system ruptured in 1971 and has been identified as one of six major fault systems that pose a threat to the highly populated region.|$|E

The affiliates operate autonomously from the national organization; each affiliate has its own staff, executive director, board of directors, and budget. Each affiliate consists of two non-profit corporations: a 501(c)(3) corporation that does not perform lobbying, and a 501(c)(4) corporation which is entitled to lobby.|$|E

Between 1920 and 1930, new oil fields across Southern California were being discovered with regularity, including Huntington Beach in 1920, Long Beach and Santa Fe Springs in 1921, and Dominguez in 1923. Southern <b>California</b> <b>had</b> become the hotbed for {{oil production}} in the United States.|$|R

5|$|The {{effect of}} these acts on {{aboriginal}} title in <b>California</b> <b>has</b> been a subject of litigation for 150 years. Regardless, the United States never again pursued treaty negotiations with California Indians, instead favoring legislation and executive orders. By statute, Congress created several Indian reservations. Congress gave the executive the discretion to create further reservations. By 1986, Presidents had used this discretion to create 117 reservations totalling 632,000 acres.|$|E

5|$|California debuted {{at number}} one on the US Billboard 200, moving 186,000 {{equivalent}} album units; it sold 172,000 copies in its first week, with the remainder of its unit total reflecting the album's streaming activity and track sales. It marked the band's second number one album and first in over 15 years, when Take Off Your Pants and Jacket debuted at number one in 2001. It also knocked Drake's Views from the summit after having spent nine weeks at the top. The album became the band's first to top the charts in the United Kingdom, selling 24,000 copies in its debut week. The album also managed to reach higher chart positions worldwide than its predecessor Neighborhoods and outsold both its first-week and total sales in the US. As of December 2016, <b>California</b> <b>has</b> sold 408,000 units in the United States; making it the ninth best selling rock album of 2016. The album re-entered the Billboard 200 at number 17 in the week of the deluxe edition release.|$|E

5|$|In a 5–4 opinion {{written by}} Justice Harry Blackmun, the Supreme Court of the United States vacated the Appellate Division's ruling, holding that states seeking to sever parental rights irrevocably must show at least {{clear and convincing}} {{evidence}} of neglect. Justice William Rehnquist, joined by three others, dissented, {{on the grounds that}} the majority's focus on a single aspect of the law disregarded the fairness of the scheme as a whole. The ruling has since been criticized for its intrusion into state affairs. Because of the ruling, all states previously using the fair preponderance standard changed to the clear and convincing standard, but <b>California</b> <b>has</b> since abandoned the clear and convincing standard and returned to the fair preponderance standard.|$|E
5|$|Urbanization {{can result}} in the {{fragmentation}} of contiguous natural landscapes into patchy habitat within an urban area. Animals that live in these fragmented areas often have reduced movement between the habitat patches, {{which can lead to}} reduced gene flow and pathogen transmission between patches. Animals such as the bobcat are particularly sensitive to fragmentation because of their large home ranges. A study in coastal Southern <b>California</b> <b>has</b> shown bobcat populations are affected by urbanization, creation of roads, and other developments. The populations may not be declining as much as predicted, but instead the connectivity of different populations is affected. This leads to a decrease in natural genetic diversity among bobcat populations. For bobcats, preserving open space in sufficient quantities and quality is necessary for population viability. Educating local residents about the animals is critical, as well, for conservation in urban areas.|$|E
