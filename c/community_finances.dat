40|$|In {{the face}} of severe {{resource}} shortages, <b>community</b> <b>financing</b> is increasingly being promoted as an alternative source of finance for public health providers. Non-government organisations have long-standing experience of <b>community</b> <b>financing,</b> {{but there is little}} documentation of the range of approaches. In this review, a sample of twenty NGOs was studied to explore these experiences. The range of approaches adopted by different organisations and the information available regarding success in achieving financial sustainability are described. Two preconditions for successful <b>community</b> <b>financing</b> (in this sense) are suggested by the evidence: collection of relevant background data relating to the proposed site of the <b>community</b> <b>financing</b> programme, and consultation with the community. The Health Economics and Financing Programme is supported by the Overseas Development Administration.

40|$|For years, the {{agricultural}} {{policies of the}} United States and the European Union have been the object of internal debate {{at the same time}} as they have been at the heart of agricultural discussions in the Doha round of WTO negotiations. The CAP (Common Agricultural Policy) is being examined in the framework of the “Health Check” and of the general review of EU <b>community</b> <b>finances,</b> the American discussions about the Farm bill are making no headway and the Doha round of negotiations is still blocked. Now suddenly the food crisis that has been developing over the last few months has put agricultural issues into the headlines again. A workshop on European and American agricultural policies took place last March, organised by Bruegel, the CEPII, the German Marshall Fund and the IFPRI.

40|$|There {{is growing}} {{evidence}} that <b>community</b> <b>financing</b> mechanisms can raise additional revenue, increase equitable access to {{primary health care}} (PHC), and improve social protection. More recently there has been interest in scaling up <b>community</b> <b>financing</b> as a step towards universal coverage either via tax-based systems or social health insurance. Using key informant interviews and focus group discussions, this study sought to assess the desirability and feasibility of scaling-up community health insurance in Armenia. The results {{suggest that there is}} broad-based political support for scaling up the schemes and that <b>community</b> <b>financing</b> is synergistic with major health sector reforms. High levels of social capital within the rural communities should facilitate scaling up. Existing schemes have increased access and quality of care, but expansion of coverage is constrained by affordability, poor infrastructure, and weak linkages with the broader health system. Long-term subsidies and system-building will be essential if the expanded schemes are to be financially viable and pro-poor. Overall, successfully scaling up <b>community</b> <b>financing</b> in Armenia would depend on addressing a range of obstacles related to legislation, institutional capacity, human resources and resistance to change among certain stakeholders.

40|$|Abstract How {{to finance}} and {{provide health care}} for the more than 1. 3 billion rural poor and {{informal}} sector workers in low- and middle-income countries {{is one of the greatest}} challenges facing the international development community. This article presents the main findings from an extensive survey of the literature of <b>community</b> <b>financing</b> arrangements, and selected experiences from the Asia and Africa regions. Most <b>community</b> <b>financing</b> schemes have evolved in the context of severe economic constraints, political instability, and lack of good governance. Micro-level household data analysis indicates that <b>community</b> <b>financing</b> improves access by rural and informal sector workers to needed heath care and provides them with some financial protection against the cost of illness. Macro-level cross-country analysis gives empirical support to the hypothesis that risk-sharing in health financing matters in terms of its impact on both the level and distribution of health, financial fairness and responsiveness indicators. The background research done for this article points to five key policies available to governments to improve the effectiveness and sustainability of existing <b>community</b> <b>financing</b> schemes. This includes: (a) increased and well-targeted subsidies to pay for the premiums of low-income populations; (b) insurance to protect against expenditure fluctuations and re-insurance to enlarge the effective size of small risk pools; (c) effective prevention and case management techniques to limit expenditure fluctuations; (d) technical support to strengthen the management capacity of local schemes; and (e) establishment and strengthening of links with the formal financing an...|$|R

40|$|Financial {{exclusion}} {{is increasingly}} being recognised {{as an important}} aspect of socio-economic inequality where disadvantaged individuals and communities are isolated from mainstream financial services, particularly affordable and readily available credit. In the face of these problems, social policy initiatives have emerged that have travelled under various names: social investment, micro-finance, <b>community</b> <b>finance</b> and <b>community</b> development <b>finance.</b> These initiatives are seen as the basis of a ‘new economics’ that will create self-sustaining local economies. The government is also promoting <b>community</b> development <b>finance</b> as an aspect of community regeneration with the aim of providing credit to poor communities to stimulate local enterprise and thereby reduce dependency on state support. The same approach is being taken to grant-funded community and voluntary organisations to encourage them into a neo-market approach to the delivery of services.
