5|$|Tornadoes {{normally}} rotate cyclonically (when {{viewed from}} above, this is counterclockwise {{in the northern}} hemisphere and clockwise in the southern). While large-scale storms always rotate cyclonically due to the <b>Coriolis</b> effect, thunderstorms and tornadoes are so small that the direct influence of the <b>Coriolis</b> effect is unimportant, as indicated by their large Rossby numbers. Supercells and tornadoes rotate cyclonically in numerical simulations even when the <b>Coriolis</b> effect is neglected. Low-level mesocyclones and tornadoes owe their rotation to complex processes within the supercell and ambient environment.|$|E
5|$|A simple rule {{of thumb}} is that for {{high-pressure}} areas, where generally air flows from the center outward, the <b>coriolis</b> force given by the earth's rotation to the air circulation is in the opposite direction of earth's apparent rotation if viewed from above the hemisphere's pole. So, both the earth and winds around a low-pressure area rotate counter-clockwise in the northern hemisphere, and clockwise in the southern. The opposite to these two cases occurs {{in the case of a}} high. These results derive from the <b>Coriolis</b> effect; that article explains in detail the physics, and provides an animation of a model to aid understanding.|$|E
5|$|Jet streams are {{the product}} of two factors: the {{atmospheric}} heating by solar radiation that produces the large scale Polar, Ferrel, and Hadley circulation cells, and the action of the <b>Coriolis</b> force acting on those moving masses. The <b>Coriolis</b> force is caused by the planet's rotation on its axis. On other planets, internal heat rather than solar heating drives their jet streams. The Polar jet stream forms near the interface of the Polar and Ferrel circulation cells; while the subtropical jet forms near the boundary of the Ferrel and Hadley circulation cells.|$|E
5|$|The Earth's {{rotation}} {{causes the}} <b>Coriolis</b> effect, which bends currents {{to the right}} in the Northern Hemisphere {{and to the left}} in the Southern Hemisphere. When this bend brings the currents into more perpendicular contact with the shore, it can amplify the surge, and when it bends the current away from the shore it has the effect of lessening the surge.|$|E
5|$|There are six main {{requirements}} for tropical cyclogenesis: sufficiently warm sea surface temperatures, atmospheric instability, high humidity {{in the lower}} to middle levels of the troposphere, enough <b>Coriolis</b> force to sustain a low pressure center, a preexisting low level focus or disturbance, and low vertical wind shear. While these conditions are necessary for tropical cyclone formation, they do not guarantee that a tropical cyclone will form.|$|E
5|$|However, {{because the}} planet is {{rotating}} underneath the atmosphere, and frictional forces arise as the planetary surface drags some atmosphere with it, the air flow from center to periphery is not direct, but is twisted due to the <b>Coriolis</b> effect, or the merely apparent force that arise when the observer is in a rotating frame of reference. Viewed from above this twist in wind direction {{is in the same}} direction as the rotation of the planet.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{winds are}} strongest {{immediately}} under the tropopause (except locally, during tornadoes, tropical cyclones or other anomalous situations). If two air masses of different temperatures or densities meet, the resulting pressure difference {{caused by the}} density difference (which ultimately causes wind) is highest within the transition zone. The wind does not flow directly from the hot to the cold area, but is deflected by the <b>Coriolis</b> effect and flows along the boundary of the two air masses.|$|E
5|$|The {{motion of}} the fluid is {{sustained}} by convection, motion driven by buoyancy. The temperature increases towards {{the center of the}} Earth, and the higher temperature of the fluid lower down makes it buoyant. This buoyancy is enhanced by chemical separation: As the core cools, some of the molten iron solidifies and is plated to the inner core. In the process, lighter elements are left behind in the fluid, making it lighter. This is called compositional convection. A <b>Coriolis</b> effect, caused by the overall planetary rotation, tends to organize the flow into rolls aligned along the north-south polar axis.|$|E
5|$|The polar easterlies, {{also known}} as Polar Hadley cells, are dry, cold {{prevailing}} winds that blow from the high-pressure areas of the polar highs at {{the north and south}} poles towards the low-pressure areas within the Westerlies at high latitudes. Unlike the Westerlies, these prevailing winds blow from the east to the west, and are often weak and irregular. Because of the low sun angle, cold air builds up and subsides at the pole creating surface high-pressure areas, forcing an equatorward outflow of air; that outflow is deflected westward by the <b>Coriolis</b> effect.|$|E
5|$|The tidal {{effect of}} the planets is weak and does not {{significantly}} affect {{the shape of the}} Sun. The Sun rotates faster at its equator than at its poles. This differential rotation is caused by convective motion due to heat transport and the <b>Coriolis</b> force due to the Sun's rotation. In a frame of reference defined by the stars, the rotational period is approximately 25.6 days at the equator and 33.5 days at the poles. Viewed from Earth as it orbits the Sun, the apparent rotational period of the Sun at its equator is about 28 days.|$|E
5|$|Vamei {{formed and}} reached {{tropical}} storm strength at 1.5ºN, only 156km (97mi) from the equator. This broke {{the previous record}} of Typhoon Sarah in the 1956 Pacific typhoon season, which reached tropical storm strength at 2.2ºN. Due {{to a lack of}} <b>Coriolis</b> effect near the equator, the formation of Vamei was previously considered impossible. However, a study by the Naval Postgraduate School indicated that the probability for a similar equatorial development was at least once every four centuries.|$|E
5|$|A {{second factor}} which {{contributes}} to a concentrated jet, that is more applicable to the subtropical jet, which forms at the poleward limit of the tropical Hadley cell and to first order this circulation is symmetric with respect to longitude. Tropical air rises to the tropopause, and moves poleward before sinking; this is the Hadley cell circulation. As it does so it tends to conserve angular momentum, since friction with the ground is significant. Air masses that begin moving poleward are deflected eastward by the <b>Coriolis</b> force (true for either hemisphere), which for poleward moving air implies an increased eastward component of the winds (note that leftward deflection in the southern hemisphere).|$|E
5|$|All {{these facts}} are {{consequences}} of the thermal wind relation. The balance of forces acting on an atmospheric air parcel in the vertical direction is primarily between the gravitational force acting on {{the mass of the}} parcel and the buoyancy force, or the difference in pressure between the top and bottom surfaces of the parcel. Any imbalance between these forces results in the acceleration of the parcel in the imbalance direction: upward if the buoyant force exceeds the weight, and downward if the weight exceeds the buoyancy force. The balance in the vertical direction is referred to as hydrostatic. Beyond the tropics, the dominant forces act in the horizontal direction, and the primary struggle is between the <b>Coriolis</b> force and the pressure gradient force. Balance between these two forces is referred to as geostrophic. Given both hydrostatic and geostrophic balance, one can derive the thermal wind relation: the vertical gradient of the horizontal wind is proportional to the horizontal temperature gradient. If two air masses, one cold and dense to the North and the other hot and less dense to the South, are separated by a vertical boundary and that boundary should be removed, the difference in densities will result in the cold air mass slipping under the hotter and less dense air mass. The <b>Coriolis</b> effect will then cause poleward-moving mass to deviate to the East, while equatorward-moving mass will deviate toward the west. The general trend in the atmosphere is for temperatures to decrease in the poleward direction. As a result, winds develop an eastward component and that component grows with altitude. Therefore, the strong eastward moving jet streams are in part a simple consequence {{of the fact that the}} Equator is warmer than the North and South poles.|$|E
5|$|Laminar {{boundary}} layers can be loosely classified {{according to}} their structure and {{the circumstances under which}} they are created. The thin shear layer which develops on an oscillating body {{is an example of a}} Stokes boundary layer, while the Blasius boundary layer refers to the well-known similarity solution near an attached flat plate held in an oncoming unidirectional flow and Falkner–Skan boundary layer, a generalization of Blasius profile. When a fluid rotates and viscous forces are balanced by the <b>Coriolis</b> effect (rather than convective inertia), an Ekman layer forms. In the theory of heat transfer, a thermal boundary layer occurs. A surface can have multiple types of boundary layer simultaneously.|$|E
5|$|Most {{tropical}} cyclones form in {{a worldwide}} band of thunderstorm activity near the equator, {{referred to as}} the Intertropical Front (ITF), the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), or the monsoon trough. Another important source of atmospheric instability is found in tropical waves, which {{contribute to the development of}} about 85% of intense tropical cyclones in the Atlantic Ocean and become most of the tropical cyclones in the Eastern Pacific. The majority forms between 10 and 30 degrees of latitude away of the equator, and 87% forms no farther away than 20 degrees north or south. Because the <b>Coriolis</b> effect initiates and maintains their rotation, tropical cyclones rarely form or move within 5degrees of the equator, where the effect is weakest. However, it is still possible for tropical systems to form within this boundary as Tropical Storm Vamei and Cyclone Agni did in 2001 and 2004, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Owing to {{the present}} state of {{continental}} drift, the Northern Hemisphere is now fairly equally divided between land and sea (a ratio of about 2:3) but the South is overwhelmingly oceanic (1:4.7). Salinity in the open ocean is generally in a narrow band around 3.5% by mass, although this can vary in more landlocked waters, near the mouths of large rivers, or at great depths. About 85% of the solids in the open sea are sodium chloride. Deep-sea currents are produced by differences in salinity and temperature. Surface currents are formed by the friction of waves produced by the wind and by tides, the changes in local sea level produced by the gravity of the Moon and Sun. The direction of all of these is governed by surface and submarine land masses and by the rotation of the Earth (the <b>Coriolis</b> effect).|$|E
5|$|Wind {{is caused}} by {{differences}} in the atmospheric pressure. When a difference in atmospheric pressure exists, air moves from the higher to the lower pressure area, resulting in winds of various speeds. On a rotating planet, air will also be deflected by the <b>Coriolis</b> effect, except exactly on the equator. Globally, the two major driving factors of large-scale wind patterns (the atmospheric circulation) are the differential heating between the equator and the poles (difference in absorption of solar energy leading to buoyancy forces) and {{the rotation of the}} planet. Outside the tropics and aloft from frictional effects of the surface, the large-scale winds tend to approach geostrophic balance. Near the Earth's surface, friction causes the wind to be slower than it would be otherwise. Surface friction also causes winds to blow more inward into low-pressure areas.|$|E
5|$|In meteorology, {{winds are}} often {{referred}} to according to their strength, and the direction from which the wind is blowing. Short bursts of high speed wind are termed gusts. Strong winds of intermediate duration (around one minute) are termed squalls. Long-duration winds have various names associated with their average strength, such as , gale, storm, and hurricane. Wind occurs {{on a range of}} scales, from thunderstorm flows lasting tens of minutes, to local breezes generated by heating of land surfaces and lasting a few hours, to global winds resulting from the difference in absorption of solar energy between the climate zones on Earth. The two main causes of large-scale atmospheric circulation are the differential heating between the equator and the poles, and the rotation of the planet (<b>Coriolis</b> effect). Within the tropics, thermal low circulations over terrain and high plateaus can drive monsoon circulations. In coastal areas the sea breeze/land breeze cycle can define local winds; in areas that have variable terrain, mountain and valley breezes can dominate local winds.|$|E
5|$|The Mk 8 Rangekeeper was an {{electromechanical}} {{analog computer}} whose function was to continuously calculate the gun's bearing and elevation, Line-Of-Fire (LOF), {{to hit a}} future position of the target. It did this by automatically receiving information from the director (LOS), the FC Radar (range), the ship's gyrocompass (true ship's course), the ship's Pitometer log (ship's speed), the Stable Vertical (ship's roll and pitch), and the ship's anemometer (relative wind speed and direction). Also, before the surface action started, the FTs made manual inputs for the average initial velocity of the projectiles fired out of the battery's gun barrels, and air density. With all this information, the Rangekeeper calculated the relative motion between the ship and the target. It then could calculate an offset angle and change of range between the target's present position (LOS) and future position {{at the end of}} the projectile's time of flight. To this bearing and range offset, it added corrections for gravity, wind, Magnus effect of the spinning projectile, earth's curvature, and <b>coriolis</b> effect. The result was the turret's bearing and elevation orders (LOF). During the surface action, range and deflection Spots and target altitude (not zero during Gun Fire Support) were manually entered.|$|E
5|$|The {{thermal wind}} {{relation}} {{does not explain}} why the winds are organized into tight jets, rather than distributed more broadly over the hemisphere. One factor {{that contributes to the}} creation of a concentrated polar jet is the undercutting of sub-tropical air masses by the more dense polar air masses at the polar front. This causes surface low pressure and higher pressure at altitude. At high altitudes, lack of friction allows air to respond freely to the steep pressure gradient with low pressure at high altitude over the pole. This results in the formation of planetary wind circulations that experience a strong <b>Coriolis</b> deflection and thus can be considered 'quasi-geostrophic'. The polar front jet stream is closely linked to the frontogenesis process in midlatitudes, as the acceleration/deceleration of the air flow induces areas of low/high pressure respectively, which link to the formation of cyclones and anticyclones along the polar front in a relatively narrow region.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the northwestern}} Pacific {{there are no}} {{official}} typhoon seasons as tropical cyclones form throughout the year. Like any tropical cyclone, there are six main requirements for typhoon formation and development: sufficiently warm sea surface temperatures, atmospheric instability, high humidity in the lower to middle levels of the troposphere, enough <b>Coriolis</b> force to develop a low pressure center, a pre-existing low level focus or disturbance, and low vertical wind shear. While the majority of storms form between June and November, a few storms do occur between December and May (although tropical cyclone formation is at a minimum during that time). On average, the northwestern Pacific features the most numerous and intense tropical cyclones globally. Like other basins, they are steered by the subtropical ridge towards the west or northwest, with some systems recurving near and east of Japan. The Philippines receive {{the brunt of the}} landfalls, with China and Japan being impacted slightly less. Some of the deadliest typhoons in history have struck China. Southern China has the longest record of typhoon impacts for the region, with a thousand-year sample via documents within their archives. Taiwan has received the wettest known typhoon on record for the northwest Pacific tropical cyclone basins.|$|E
5|$|Wind blowing {{over the}} surface of the sea causes {{friction}} at the interface between air and sea. Not only does this cause waves to form but it also makes the surface seawater move {{in the same direction as}} the wind. Although winds are variable, in any one place they predominantly blow from a single direction and thus a surface current can be formed. Westerly winds are most frequent in the mid-latitudes while easterlies dominate the tropics. When water moves in this way, other water flows in to fill the gap and a circular movement of surface currents known as a gyre is formed. There are five main gyres in the world's oceans: two in the Pacific, two in the Atlantic, and one in the Indian Ocean. The North Atlantic gyre that produces the Sargasso Sea accumulates salinity levels as high as 38‰. Other smaller gyres are found in lesser seas and a single gyre flows around Antarctica. These gyres have followed the same routes for millennia, guided by the topography of the land, the wind direction, and the <b>Coriolis</b> effect. The surface currents flow in a clockwise direction in the Northern Hemisphere and anticlockwise in the Southern Hemisphere. The water moving away from the equator is warm, while that flowing towards it has lost most of its heat. These currents tend to moderate the Earth's climate, cooling the equatorial region, and warming regions at higher latitudes. Global climate and weather forecasts are powerfully affected by the world ocean, so global climate modelling makes use of ocean circulation models as well as models of other major components such as the atmosphere, land surfaces, aerosols, and sea ice. Ocean models make use of a branch of physics, geophysical fluid dynamics, that describes the large-scale flow of fluids such as seawater.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the year, the South Pacific High {{influences}} the climate by bringing cold, moist air masses originating from Patagonia. During {{the most intense}} cold waves, they form when a transient high pressure system located in the South Pacific Ocean moves eastwards to {{the southern tip of}} South America. As it begins to move, this high pressure system strengthens the South Pacific High and is forced to move southwards to south of 40oS where the Andes are shorter in height. As well, an upper level ridge forms over the South Pacific Ocean along with an upper level trough extending from subtropical latitudes to the South Atlantic Ocean. At the same time, a low pressure system forms over the South Atlantic Ocean which eventually strengthens. The formation a cold front associated with it moves to the northeast owing to the topographic barrier that the Andes forms. The passage of the cold front to the northeast leads to the movement of the high pressure system from the South Pacific Ocean into the southern tip of South America. All of these conditions lead to strong anticyclogenesis to the east of the Andes and thus, the high pressure system intensifies as it enters southern Argentina. When both the high pressure system (over southern Argentina) and low pressure system strengthen, it creates a very strong pressure gradient that draws cold air from the south, strengthening southerly winds. Owing to the topographic barrier of the Andes, it forces and channels the cold air to accumulate on {{the eastern side of the}} Andes. This generates an ageostropic component from the south (due to a reduction in the <b>Coriolis</b> force caused by accumulation of cold air on the eastern side of the Andes) that draw this cold air northwards, which is driven by this pressure gradient. Cold air can move northwards until 18oS when the blocking effect of the Andes is smaller due to a change in its orientation. Overall, these conditions results in the coldest temperatures due to the cold masses from high latitudes being pulled northwards. A weaker cold wave occurs when the South Pacific High remains over the ocean and does not have a migratory high pressure system originating from the South Pacific High that moves east of the Andes (it builds over the Andes). Although this occurs throughout the year, during winters, it leads to cold temperatures while during summer, it leads to strong and deep convections. These convections are responsible for about 50% of summer precipitation south of 25oS.|$|E
25|$|In physics, the <b>Coriolis</b> {{force is}} an {{inertial}} force that acts on {{objects that are}} in motion relative to a rotating reference frame. In a reference frame with clockwise rotation, the force acts {{to the left of}} the motion of the object. In one with anticlockwise rotation, the force acts to the right. Deflection of an object due to the <b>Coriolis</b> force is called the <b>Coriolis</b> effect. Though recognized previously by others, the mathematical expression for the <b>Coriolis</b> force appeared in an 1835 paper by French scientist Gaspard-Gustave de <b>Coriolis,</b> in connection with the theory of water wheels. Early in the 20th century, the term <b>Coriolis</b> force began to be used in connection with meteorology.|$|E
25|$|No {{discussion}} of <b>Coriolis</b> force can arrive at this solution as simply, so {{the reason to}} treat this problem is to demonstrate <b>Coriolis</b> formalism in an easily visualized situation.|$|E
25|$|Thirdly, let the parcel {{travel at}} a {{latitude}} of 45 degrees, {{either in the}} southern or northern hemisphere—so the <b>Coriolis</b> force is at play with a <b>Coriolis</b> parameter of 0.000115nbsp&Hz.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{pressure}} force must exactly counterbalance the <b>Coriolis</b> force anyway, so the {{parcel of air}} needs to travel with the <b>Coriolis</b> force contrary to the decreasing sideways slope of pressure.|$|E
25|$|The Rossby {{number is}} {{the ratio of}} {{inertial}} to <b>Coriolis</b> forces. A small Rossby number indicates a system is strongly affected by <b>Coriolis</b> forces, and a large Rossby number indicates {{a system in which}} inertial forces dominate. For example, in tornadoes, the Rossby number is large, in low-pressure systems it is low, and in oceanic systems it is around 1. As a result, in tornadoes the <b>Coriolis</b> force is negligible, and balance is between pressure and centrifugal forces. In low-pressure systems, centrifugal force is negligible and balance is between <b>Coriolis</b> and pressure forces. In the oceans all three forces are comparable.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of this {{analysis}} an important point appears: all the fictitious accelerations must be included to obtain the correct trajectory. In particular, besides the <b>Coriolis</b> acceleration, the centrifugal force plays an essential role. It is easy to get the impression from verbal discussions of the cannonball problem, which focus on displaying the <b>Coriolis</b> effect particularly, that the <b>Coriolis</b> force is the only factor that must be considered, but that is not so. A turntable for which the <b>Coriolis</b> force is the only factor is the parabolic turntable. A somewhat more complex situation is the idealized example of flight routes over long distances, where the centrifugal force of the path and aeronautical lift are countered by gravitational attraction.|$|E
25|$|Because this {{reference}} frame rotates {{several times a}} minute rather than only once a day like the Earth, the <b>Coriolis</b> acceleration produced is many times larger and so easier to observe on small time and spatial scales than is the <b>Coriolis</b> acceleration caused by {{the rotation of the}} Earth.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Coriolis</b> effect {{strongly}} {{affects the}} large-scale {{oceanic and atmospheric}} circulation, leading {{to the formation of}} robust features like jet streams and western boundary currents. Such features are in geostrophic balance, meaning that the <b>Coriolis</b> and pressure gradient forces balance each other. <b>Coriolis</b> acceleration is also responsible for the propagation of many types of waves in the ocean and atmosphere, including Rossby waves and Kelvin waves. It is also instrumental in the so-called Ekman dynamics in the ocean, and in the establishment of the large-scale ocean flow pattern called the Sverdrup balance.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{important}} impact of the <b>Coriolis</b> effect is in the large-scale dynamics of the oceans and the atmosphere. In meteorology and oceanography, it is convenient to postulate a rotating frame of reference wherein the Earth is stationary. In accommodation of that provisional postulation, the centrifugal and <b>Coriolis</b> forces are introduced. Their relative importance {{is determined by the}} applicable Rossby numbers. Tornadoes have high Rossby numbers, so, while tornado-associated centrifugal forces are quite substantial, <b>Coriolis</b> forces associated with tornadoes are for practical purposes negligible.|$|E
25|$|To {{demonstrate}} the <b>Coriolis</b> effect, a parabolic turntable can be used.|$|E
25|$|Because surface ocean {{currents}} {{are driven by}} the movement of wind over the water's surface, the <b>Coriolis</b> force also affects the movement of {{ocean currents}} and cyclones as well. Many of the ocean's largest currents circulate around warm, high-pressure areas called gyres. Though the circulation is not as significant as that in the air, the deflection caused by the <b>Coriolis</b> effect is what creates the spiraling pattern in these gyres. The spiraling wind pattern helps the hurricane form. The stronger the force from the <b>Coriolis</b> effect, the faster the wind spins and picks up additional energy, increasing {{the strength of the}} hurricane.|$|E
25|$|<b>Coriolis</b> {{effects are}} ordinarily {{negligible}} in lower latitudes or on smaller scales.|$|E
25|$|Conversely, the <b>Coriolis</b> force stays {{the same}} if the radius is along a parallel.|$|E
