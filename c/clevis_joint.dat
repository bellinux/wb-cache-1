5000|$|A {{captured}} Type 97 mortar, {{which has}} been studied in detail, was marked [...] "Type 97 High-Angle Infantry Gun". The weapon was manufactured in 1942 in the Osaka Army Arsenal. Although the Japanese weapon closely resembles the US 81-mm mortar, M1, there are several identifying features by which the two can be distinguished. The adjusting nut of the Japanese mortar {{is on the right}} bipod leg, while the sight is on the left. Other differences are the buttress-type threads on the traversing and elevating screws of the Japanese weapon, as well as the use of welding to fasten bipod legs to the <b>clevis</b> <b>joint</b> and grease fittings dissimilar to those used by the US model.|$|E
50|$|The Type 99 is {{a smooth}} bore, muzzle-loading weapon of the Stokes-Brandt type. The Type 99 81 mm mortar {{differs from the}} Type 97 81 mm {{infantry}} mortar in the shortness of its tube, which is only 21.75 inches as compared with 45.34 inches of the Type 97. The mortar can be disassembled into three units: the tube, the bipod, and the base plate. The legs of the bipod, made of tubular steel, are mounted on the elevating screw housing by a <b>clevis</b> <b>joint.</b> They terminate in thin steel plates which have single-pointed spikes on the underside. The spread of the legs is limited by a chain which has a spring attached to one end to relieve the shock of firing. A buffer system incorporated in the bipod gives a recuperation of 2 inches. The recoil cylinders are filled with light grease or heavy oil. The base plate, made of pressed steel, has a series of ribs and braces welded on the underside {{to allow it to}} dig into the ground when the piece is fired. On the top side of the plate, in the center, is a circular depression into which the base-cap knob fits when the mortar is mounted in firing position. A carrying handle is attached to the rear edge of the plate. Also, two small hooks are welded to the rear edge to permit the attachment of a carrying strap. Around {{the outer edge of the}} plate is a one-inch ridge, and on the lower front edge a hook is attached through which a small rod can be thrust and used for slight changes in base plate alignment. A stability test of the Type 99 mortar, in which a total of 14 rounds were fired, produced no visible evidence of cracking or deformation of either base plate or bipod. The plate sank about 2 inches into the ground with the firing of seven rounds at alternate elevations of 45 to 75 degrees. Stability was very satisfactory when firing zone charges I to IV, but zones V to VI produced noticeable hop of the mortar and a sinking of the base plate. The reported range of the weapon of about 2,200 yards has not been conclusively confirmed.|$|E
40|$|An {{articulated}} tang in <b>clevis</b> <b>joint</b> for incorporation in newly manufactured conventional strap-on orthotic knee devices or {{for replacing}} such joints in conventional strap-on orthotic knee devices is discussed. The instant tang in <b>clevis</b> <b>joint</b> allows the user {{the freedom to}} extend and bend the knee normally when no load (weight) {{is applied to the}} knee and to automatically lock the knee when the user transfers weight to the knee, thus preventing a damaged knee from bending uncontrollably when weight is applied to the knee. The tang in <b>clevis</b> <b>joint</b> of the present invention includes first and second clevis plates, a tang assembly and a spacer plate secured between the clevis plates. Each clevis plate includes a bevelled serrated upper section. A bevelled shoe is secured to the tank in close proximity to the bevelled serrated upper section of the clevis plates. A coiled spring mounted within an oblong bore of the tang normally urges the shoes secured to the tang out of engagement with the serrated upper section of each clevic plate to allow rotation of the tang relative to the clevis plate. When weight is applied to the joint, the load compresses the coiled spring, the serrations on each clevis plate dig into the bevelled shoes secured to the tang to prevent relative movement between the tang and clevis plates. A shoulder is provided on the tang and the spacer plate to prevent overextension of the joint...|$|E
40|$|This {{invention}} relates {{generally to}} pin <b>clevis</b> <b>joints,</b> and more particularly, to zero play pin <b>clevis</b> <b>joints</b> for connecting structural members of a deployable space structure. A joint includes a pin, a tang, and a shackle. The pin is tapered at the same angle as the bores extending through the projections of the shackle and the tang. A spring washer biases the tang onto the tapered sidewall of the pin. The invention solves the free play problem associated with deployable space structures by using a tapered pin which is held in tapered holes by the spring washers...|$|R
40|$|Technique {{developed}} involves use of ultrasonics {{to inspect}} first bond surfaces of solid-rocket-motor joints. By fitting pieces of insulating materials to mate exactly with complicated shapes of affected parts of insulation, complicated shapes redefined into simpler ones probed more easily. When technique used to insonify from insulation side, one readily detects difference between disbond and good bond. Same technique applied to field tang <b>joints,</b> field <b>clevis</b> <b>joints,</b> and aft-dome-to-fixed-nozzle-housing attachment points. Although developed for inspecting joints in solid rocket motors, also applicable to nondestructive evaluation of other complicated joints...|$|R
50|$|The O-rings {{were two}} rubber rings that formed a seal between two {{sections}} of the SRBs. The {{sections of the}} boosters were joined using tang and <b>clevis</b> <b>joints</b> and the rings were intended to seal the joint, while allowing for the inevitable movement between the sections under flight conditions. By design, pressure from within the booster was to push a fillet of putty into the joint, forcing the O-ring into its seat. The system never functioned as designed. The rings were supposed {{to sit in a}} groove and seal the joint between the sections of the booster. It was found, however, that flight dynamics caused the joints in the SRBs to flex during launch, opening a gap through which rocket exhaust could escape. As the joints flexed, the rings would come out of their grooves and move to a new position in the joint, a process called extrusion. The extruded ring would form a seal in this new position, but during the time it took for the ring to shift, the joint was unsealed and hot gases could escape, a process called blow-by. These hot gases would damage the rings until the seal was achieved.|$|R
40|$|Brief report {{proposes to}} modify {{placement}} of O-ring seals in joints of Solid Rocket Booster of Space Shuttle. Modified joint and seal essentially "inside-out" version of old joint and seal. O-rings placed between outer side of tang and <b>clevis.</b> <b>Joint</b> rotation pushes tang harder against O-rings, thereby making even tighter seal. Proposal derived from analysis of Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, attributed to failure of these O-ring seals...|$|E

Design and operating features for an automatic coupler <b>clevis</b> <b>joint,</b> a side latching detent joint, and a module-to-module auto lock coupler are given. An analysis of the packaging characteristics of stacked subassembly, single fold, hybrid, and double fold concepts is given for various platform structure configurations. Payload carrier systems and assembly techniques are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{response}} of truss-type structures for future space applications, such as Large Deployable Reflector (LDR), will be {{directly affected by}} joint performance. Some of the objectives of research at BAC were to characterize structural joints, establish analytical approaches that incorporate joint characteristics, and experimentally establish {{the validity of the}} analytical approaches. The test approach to characterize joints for both erectable and deployable-type structures was based upon a Force State Mapping Technique. The approach pictorially shows how the nonlinear joint results can be used for equivalent linear analysis. Testing of the Space Station joints developed at LaRC (a hinged joint at 2 Hz and a <b>clevis</b> <b>joint</b> at 2 Hz) successfully revealed the nonlinear characteristics of the joints. The Space Station joints were effectively linear when loaded to plus or minus 500 pounds with a corresponding displacement of about plus or minus 0. 0015 inch. It was indicated that good linear joints exist which are compatible with errected structures, but that difficulty may be encountered if nonlinear-type joints are incorporated in the structure...|$|E
40|$|Seals for sealing <b>clevis</b> and flange <b>joints</b> (14) of a {{solid rocket}} booster motor, and more {{particularly}} to a seal (30) which is twisted upon application of expansion forces to an edge seal (36). This twisting motion initially causes a leading edge seal (44) to be urged into sealing engagement with a surface (48) of an adjacent member (20) and thereafter, increasing fluid pressure on a pressurized side (64) of a seal (30) drives a broad sealing region (46) into sealing engagement with a surface (48) ...|$|R
40|$|The Space Shuttle Challenger (STS 51 -L) {{accident}} led to {{an intense}} investigation of the structural behavior of the solid rocket booster (SRB) tang and <b>clevis</b> field <b>joints.</b> The presence of structural deformations between the clevis inner leg and the tang, substantial enough to prevent the O-ring seals from eliminating hot gas flow through the joints, {{has emerged as a}} likely cause of the vehicle failure. This paper presents results of axisymmetric shell analyses that parametrically assess the structural behavior of SRB field joints subjected to quasi-steady-state internal pressure loading for both the original joint flown on mission STS 51 -L and the redesigned joint recently flown on the Space Shuttle Discovery. Discussion of axisymmetric shell modeling issues and details is presented and a generic method for simulating contact between adjacent shells of revolution is described. Results are presented that identify the performance trends of the joints {{for a wide range of}} joint parameters...|$|R

Results are presented that identify the performance trends of the joints {{for a wide range of}} joint parameters. An important finding is that the redesigned joint exhibits significantly smaller O-ring gap changes and much less sensitivity to joint clearances than the original joint. For a wide range of joint parameters, the result presented indicate that the redesigned joint provides a much better pressure seal than the original joint...|$|R
