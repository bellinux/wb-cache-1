50|$|Tenebroides mauritanicus, {{commonly}} known as the <b>cadelle</b> beetle, is a cosmopolitan and common pest in storehouses and granaries. It is one of the longest lived insects which attacks stored grain and is very destructive and easily dispersed. It {{is also one of the}} largest (body length 10 mm.).|$|E
40|$|This one-page {{extension}} circular displays {{pictures of}} the following grain insects: Granary weevil, Saw-toothed grain beetle, Red flour beetle, Larger cabinet beetle, Lesser grain borer, Rice weevil, Indian-meal moth, <b>Cadelle,</b> Flat grain beetle, and Angoumois grain moth. Some of these stored grain insects are also kitchen pests. This publication was prepared by Extension Entomologists of the North Central States {{in cooperation with the}} Federal Extension Service, U. S. Department of Agriculture...|$|E
40|$|The {{rates of}} {{predation}} by the adults of Tenebroides mauritanicus were determined {{for the three}} stored-product pests. The average number of completely or partially eaten insects per beetle per day was - 2. 5 - 2. 7 for Rhyzopertha dominica, 0. 5 - 0. 7 for Sitophilus oryzae and 0. 2 - 0. 4 for Oryzaephilus surinamensis respectively., For the latter two species the number of insects consumed on the 1 st day was greater than the latter days. For the rice weevil the greater numbers of dead and partially eaten weevils were left behind {{than the other two}} species. The relative preferences for the three species were examined. R. dominica was. most and O. surinamensis least attractive to the <b>cadelle</b> in the preference. The per cent insects eaten in the preference increased for R. dominica and S. oryzae and decreased for O. surinamensis as compard with preying on the single species. Using S. oryzae and O. surinamensis as prey, preying on dead body was tested. Both the rates of predation increased on the dead insects. The rate of predation on the dead S. oryzae did not differ from that on the living R. dominica. The relative preferences for the three species were attributed to the differences of vagility and palatability among the prey species. It was considered that the <b>cadelle</b> {{played an important role in}} natural control over the stored-product pests...|$|E
40|$|Millions of {{bushels of}} grain {{are stored in}} Nebraska. Much of this is in producer-owned and {{controlled}} bins located on farm sites close to the po int of production. Insects frequently cause as much damage to stored gra in as they do to the growing crop. Insects damage stored grain in two ways. First, direct feeding damage reduces wei ght, nutritional value, germination, and lowers market value. Second, the deterioration and contamination caused {{by the presence of}} insects results in downgrad-ing of grain due to foreign matter such as insects, insect parts, odors, molds, and heat damage, thus reducing the market value. A bin fil led with gra in provides a stable environment for many insects. Insects that commonly attack whole grain in storage in Nebraska are the rice weevil, granary weevil, lesser grain borer, and <b>cadelle.</b> Insects that feed mainly on cracked grain and flour inc lude th...|$|E
40|$|Although high {{concentrations}} of zinc and manganese were found in mandibles of insect larvae that bore into seeds, these metals were not detected in mandibles of insect larvae that attack previously damaged seeds. Metals {{were present in the}} larval mandibles of a lepidopteran, the Angoumois grain moth (Sitotroga cerealella), and eight coleopterans, the lesser grain borer (Rhyzopertha dominica), cigarette beetle (Lasioderma serricorne), drugstore beetle (Stegobium paniceum), spider beetle (Gibbium aequinoctiale), warehouse beetle (Trogoderma variabile), <b>cadelle</b> (Tenebroides mauritanicus), larger black flour beetle (Cynaeus angustus), and cowpea weevil (Callosobruchus maculatus). Larvae of these species can chew into seeds. Larvae of six other coleopterans, the varied carpet beetle (Anthrenus verbasci), sawtoothed grain beetle (Oryzaephilus surinamensis), rusty grain beetle (Cryptolestes ferrugineus), red flour beetle (Tribolium castaneum), longheaded flour beetle (Latheticus oryzae), and granary weevil (Sitophilus granarius) have little if any ability to chew into seeds, and did not have metal in their mandibles. Larvae of the granary weevil hatch and feed within seeds that were penetrated previously during egg deposition by adults. However, newly hatched larvae of the cowpea weevil and the Angoumois grain moth have to bore through the seed coat before they begin feeding, and they have mandibles with {{high concentrations}} of zinc. These dat...|$|E
40|$|Managing stored {{grains and}} seed {{requires}} {{the use of}} various techniques to ensure the quality of the product entering the storage facility does not deteriorate over time. These techniques include: the use of sanitation, storing sound, dry grain, managing temperature and aeration, using chemical protectants, regular sampling, and the use of fumigation. Bin and storage facilities also {{play an important role in}} determining the quality of the stored grain. Storage facilities should be inspected regularly for deterioration of any type. Proper storage moisture varies depending on type of seed, length of storage and storage conditions. Seed moisture content changes until equilibrium is established with the surrounding environment. The equilibrium moisture is different for each kind of seed. High oil content seeds (soybeans, peanuts, sunflowers) will not absorb as much moisture as seed with a high starch content (wheat, barley, corn, sorghum). Oil does not absorb water; therefore, in a seed with 40 % oil the seed moisture will be concentrated in the other 60 %. The time to reach equilibrium will vary from days to months depending on the kind of seed, humidity and temperature. When there are large differences in seed moisture and the surrounding environment the initial change is rapid and slows as equilibrium temperature/moisture is approached. Over 60 species of insects infest stored grains. Lesser grain borer, rice weevils, maize weevils, <b>cadelle</b> beetles, flat grain beetles, rusty grain beetles, sawtoothed grain beetles, foreign grain beetles, mealworm beetles, red flou...|$|E
