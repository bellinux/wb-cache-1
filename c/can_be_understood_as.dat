5|$|The {{construction}} {{of the book and}} {{the subject matter of the}} poem within it share a metaphorical connection in the decay of memory. In this light, critic Peter Schwenger asserts that Agrippa <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>understood</b> <b>as</b> organized by two ideas: the death of Gibson's father, and the disappearance or absence of the book itself. In this sense, it instantiates the ephemeral nature of all text.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} Perl <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>understood</b> <b>as</b> a {{response}} to three broad trends in the computer industry: falling hardware costs, rising labor costs, and improvements in compiler technology. Many earlier computer languages, such as Fortran and C, aimed to make efficient use of expensive computer hardware. In contrast, Perl was designed so that computer programmers could write programs more quickly and easily.|$|E
5|$|The {{electromagnetic}} field <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>understood</b> <b>as</b> a gauge field, i.e., {{as a field}} that results from requiring that a gauge symmetry holds independently at every position in spacetime. For the {{electromagnetic field}}, this gauge symmetry is the Abelian U(1) symmetry of complex numbers of absolute value 1, which reflects the ability to vary the phase of a complex field without affecting observables or real valued functions made from it, such as the energy or the Lagrangian.|$|E

5|$|The shortest-lived known isotope of {{beryllium}} is 13Be which decays through neutron emission. It has a half-life of 2.7×10−21 s. 6Be is {{also very}} short-lived with a half-life of 5.0×10−21 s. The exotic isotopes 11Be and 14Be are known to exhibit a nuclear halo. This phenomenon <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>understood</b> <b>as</b> the nuclei of 11Be and 14Be have, respectively, 1 and 4 neutrons orbiting substantially outside the classical Fermi 'waterdrop' model of the nucleus.|$|E
5|$|Venus {{is known}} {{not to have}} a {{magnetic}} field. The reason for its absence is not clear, but is probably related to the planet's slow rotation or the lack of convection in the mantle. Venus only has an induced magnetosphere formed by the Sun's magnetic field carried by the solar wind. This process <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>understood</b> <b>as</b> the field lines wrapping around an obstacle—Venus in this case. The induced magnetosphere of Venus has a bow shock, magnetosheath, magnetopause and magnetotail with the current sheet.|$|E
5|$|There are {{sections}} of the Temple known as Orders, each of which focus on a particular theme, for instance ancient Egypt, Norse culture, Tantric Hinduism, or vampirism. Others focus on a particular skill, for instance the Order of Uart focuses on the visual arts and the Order of Taliesin on music. Orders <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>understood</b> <b>as</b> schools of different aspects of magic providing different paths of initiation. Orders are led by grand masters, who will usually be {{the founder of the}} order. In longer-lived orders the founder may have a successive grand master. Orders are founded by members of the fourth degree. When members reaches the second degree of initiation, they are expected to join an order of their own choosing. In normal circumstances, a Setian is only permitted to join one order, however special dispensation can be obtained for a practitioner to join two.|$|E

25|$|The Duality Principle, or De Morgan's laws, <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>understood</b> <b>as</b> {{asserting that}} {{complementing}} all three ports of an AND gate converts {{it to an}} OR gate and vice versa, as shown in Figure 4 below.

25|$|The second {{postulate}} is {{that the}} human self-consciousness system <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>understood</b> <b>as</b> a “justification filter”. This second claim links the evolutionary analysis with key insights from psychodynamic theory. Specifically, psychodynamic theory posits that socially unjustifiable impulses are inhibited and socially justifiable reasons are given for actions taken.|$|E

50|$|Linear-chain CRFs {{have many}} of the same {{applications}} as conceptually simpler hidden Markov models (HMMs), but relax certain assumptions about the input and output sequence distributions. An HMM <b>can</b> loosely <b>be</b> <b>understood</b> <b>as</b> a CRF with very specific feature functions that use constant probabilities to model state transitions and emissions. Conversely, a CRF <b>can</b> loosely <b>be</b> <b>understood</b> <b>as</b> a generalization of an HMM that makes the constant transition probabilities into arbitrary functions that vary across the positions in the sequence of hidden states, depending on the input sequence.|$|R
25|$|The third {{postulate}} is {{that culture}} <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>understood</b> <b>as</b> large scale justification systems that coordinate {{the behavior of}} human populations.
