2500|$|Of central {{importance}} {{in the development of}} architecture in Finland for over 100 years has been the development of architectural competitions, mostly {{under the control of the}} Finnish Association of Architects (SAFA). The first architectural competition was held in 1860, even before the founding of SAFA. Twelve competitions had been held by 1880. It was only after 1893 that the <b>competition</b> <b>system</b> became more systematic, with the setting of rules. Many of the leading works of architecture at the turn of that century were the results of competitions: e.g. Tampere Cathedral (Lars Sonck, 1900), National Museum, Helsinki (Herman Gesellius, Armas Lindgren and Eliel Saarinen, 1902). Sonck was only 23 years old when he won the competition. Indeed, several well-known architects kick-started their careers while still young by winning an architecture competition. Competitions have been used not only in the design of public buildings and churches, but also for various scales of urban and regional planning. Beside Sonck and Gesellius-Lindgren-Saarinen, among the notable careers that began or were boosted by competition success are: Vyborg Library by Alvar Aalto, the Finnish pavilion at the 1958 Brussels World's Fair by Reima Pietilä, Myyrmäki Church (1984) by Juha Leiviskä, the Nokia Corporation Headquarters, Espoo (1983–97) by Helin and Siitonen Architects, the Heureka Science Centre, Vantaa (1989) by Heikkinen – Komonen Architects, the Lusto Finnish Forest Museum, Punkaharju (1994) by Lahdelma & Mahlamäki Architects, the new canopy for the Helsinki Olympic Stadium (2003) by K2S Architects, and the Kilden Performing Arts Centre (2012), Kristiansand, Norway, by ALA Architects. The competition results have been seen to have reflected the international trends of the time, or to have endorsed the critical regionalism, that is, what Aalto had referred to as [...] "being international yet true to themselves".|$|E

30|$|The {{concern of}} the paper is nonconstant {{positive}} solutions of a class of Lotka-Volterra <b>competition</b> <b>systems</b> over 1 D domains. We prove {{the existence of a}} positive monotonous solution to the shadow system for each small diffusion rate ϵ > 0. Our theoretical results provide a foundation for further theoretical analysis on the shadow system and give insights on how diffusion and advection rates affect the pattern formation in the advective Lotka-Volterra <b>competition</b> <b>systems.</b> The second part of this paper includes numerical simulations of the nontrivial patterns to the shadow system and its original model. It is demonstrated that nontrivial patterns can develop from small perturbations of the homogeneous solution. Our numerics suggest that this system admits very interesting and complicated spatial-temporal dynamics even over 1 D domains.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the traveling wave solutions of delayed reaction– diffusion systems. By using Schauder’s fixed point theorem, the existence of traveling wave solutions is reduced to the existence of generalized upper and lower solutions. Using the technique of contracting rectangles, the asymptotic behavior of traveling wave solutions for delayed diffusive systems is obtained. To illustrate our main results, the existence, nonexistence and asymptotic behavior of positive traveling wave solutions of diffusive Lotka–Volterra <b>competition</b> <b>systems</b> with distributed delays are established. The existence of nonmonotone traveling wave solutions of diffusive Lotka–Volterra <b>competition</b> <b>systems</b> is also discussed. In particular, it is proved that if there exists instantaneous self-limitation effect, then the large delays appearing in the intra-specific competitive terms may not affect the existence and asymptotic behavior of traveling wave solutions...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to determine the order and importance of particular fitness status variables impact on success in taekwondo according to opinions of top taekwondo instructors (experts). Partial objectives included analysis of metric characteristics of the measuring instrument, and determining differences between two disciplines (sparring and technical discipline of patterns) and two <b>competition</b> <b>systems</b> (WTF and ITF). In accordance with the aims, the research was conducted on a subject sample which consisted of 730 taekwondo instructors from 6 continents and from 69 coun- tries (from which we selected 242 instructors), who are at different success levels in both taekwondo <b>competition</b> <b>systems</b> (styles) and two taekwondo disciplines. The respondents were divided into 3 qualitative subsamples using a dependent variable of the instructor’s accomplished results. In 6 languages, they electronically evaluated, in percentage value (%), the impact of 8 motor and functional abilities: specific strength (STR), flexibility (FLX), specific endurance (END), speed (SPE), balance (BAL), coordination (COO), agility (AGI) and accuracy (ACC). The analysis of metric characteristics of the constructed instrument showed a satisfactory degree of agreement (IIr) which is proportional to the level of respon- dent quality, i. e. it grows along with the increase in instructor quality in all analyzed disciplines of both systems. Accord- ing to the obtained results, speed and specific endurance were ranked as the abilities which are most important for suc- cess in the sparring discipline in both <b>competition</b> <b>systems</b> (WTF and ITF), whose instructors also expressed a higher level of agreement in relation of speed and success in the technical disciplines...|$|R
