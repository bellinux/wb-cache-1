5000|$|Horses {{may suffer}} from [...] "capped hock", {{which is caused}} by the {{creation}} of a false bursa, a synovial sac beneath the skin. <b>Capped</b> <b>hock</b> is usually caused by trauma such as kicking or slipping when attempting to stand. In the absence of a wound, it does not require immediate veterinary attention and is usually only of cosmetic significance. On the other hand, a wound into the calcanean bursa is a serious problem. A <b>capped</b> <b>hock</b> is extremely unlikely to be a cause of lameness, even if severe.|$|E
5000|$|Capped joint: Inflammation {{leading to}} the {{development}} of a [...] "false" [...] or acquired bursa over the point of the elbow (capped elbow, also known as a [...] "shoe boil"), point of the hock (<b>capped</b> <b>hock),</b> or knee (capped knee, or carpal hygroma) which causes an obvious swelling in the area. These are generally considered blemishes.|$|E
40|$|The {{prevalence}} of <b>capped</b> <b>hock</b> in 5601 post weaning pigs from 93 representative pig farms in England was 17. 2 %. The prevalence increased with age. Once adjusted for age, the lowest {{prevalence of}} <b>capped</b> <b>hock</b> {{was observed in}} pigs kept on soil floors (usually covered with deep straw bedding). There was no {{significant increase in the}} risk of <b>capped</b> <b>hock</b> in pigs kept on solid concrete floors with deep straw bedding. However, pigs kept on solid concrete with some, or the entire pen, sparsely bedded and pigs kept on partially or fully slatted floors had an approximately three fold increased risk of <b>capped</b> <b>hock.</b> This did not vary significantly between these four floor types. This was in contrast to the associated risks for bursitis in the same pigs, where as the floor went from highly resilient (straw and solid floors) to hard and perforated (fully slatted) the risk of bursitis increased similar to a dose response. No other variables that were measured were associated with a change in risk for <b>capped</b> <b>hock,</b> while observation of pigs slipping or slip marks and wet, dirty and worn pens were also associated risks for bursitis. These results indicate that <b>capped</b> <b>hock</b> and bursitis are both affected by exposure to floors, but in different ways. The prevalence of <b>capped</b> <b>hock</b> was associated only with floor hardness, with deep straw protecting the pigs, while bursitis was associated with both changes in bedding depth (hardness), floor material (soil versus concrete) and floor construction (solid versus slatterd floors) and in factors associated with locomotion (slipping and slip marks). These results indicate that the aetiology of <b>capped</b> <b>hock</b> and bursitis might differ...|$|E

40|$|Unlike other farm animals, {{the horse}} is {{serviceable}} only when in motion. Any abnormal deviation in the structure or action of a horse can render it partly or completely useless. Therefore, any defect that affects serviceability is considered an unsoundness, i. e., lameness, blindness, faulty wind, etc. Those defects that detract from appearance but do not impair serviceability are considered blemishes, i. e., scars, <b>capped</b> <b>hocks</b> and elbows, etc. Blemishes are looked upon with great disfavor in gaited, parade, and some pleasure horses. They are more common in stock horses and tend to detract less from their value than from other types of horses...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Lesions on sows' {{limbs and}} bodies are an {{abnormality}} that might {{impact on their}} welfare. The prevalence of and risks for limb and body lesions on lactating sows on commercial English pig farms were investigated using direct observation of the sows and their housing. Results The prevalence of lesions on the limbs and body were 93 % (260 / 279) and 20 % (57 / 288) respectively. The prevalence of limb and body lesions was significantly lower in outdoor-housed sows compared with indoor-housed sows. Indoor-housed sows had {{an increased risk of}} wounds (OR 6. 8), calluses (OR 8. 8) and <b>capped</b> <b>hock</b> (OR 3. 8) on their limbs when housed on fully slatted floors compared with solid concrete floors. In addition, there was an increased risk of bursitis (OR 2. 7), <b>capped</b> <b>hock</b> (OR 2. 3) and shoulder lesions (OR 4. 8) in sows that were unwilling to rise to their feet. There was a decreased risk of shoulder lesions (OR 0. 3) and lesions elsewhere on the body (OR 0. 2) in sows with more than 20 cm between their tail and the back of the crate compared with sows with less than 10 cm. Conclusion The sample of outdoor housed sows in this study had the lowest prevalence of limb and body lesions. In lactating sows housed indoors there was a general trend for an increased risk of limb and body lesions in sows housed on slatted floors compared with those housed on solid concrete floors with bedding. Sows that were less responsive to human presence and sows that had the least space to move within their crates had an additional increased risk of lesions. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{prevalence}} and risks for abnormal gait in finishing pigs (Sus scrofa), gilts and pregnant sows from a representative cross-section of {{indoor and outdoor}} herds in the United Kingdom were investigated. The prevalence of abnormal gait in finishing pigs, maiden gilts, pregnant gilts and pregnant sows from 88 herds was 19. 7, 11. 8, 14. 4 and 16. 9 %, respectively. In a multivariable analysis of 98 herds, there was {{an increased risk of}} abnormal gait in pregnant sows housed on slatted floors compared with pregnant sows housed on solid concrete floors with straw bedding or sows housed outdoors on soil. The lowest prevalence of abnormal gait in finishing pigs occurred in pigs housed outdoors (3. 4 vs 19. 7 % in indoor-housed finishing pigs) however, the difference was not significant because only three farms in the study housed finishing pigs outdoors. In indoor-housed finishing pigs, there was an increased risk of abnormal gait in pigs housed on solid concrete floors with sparse bedding, partly-slatted floors or fully-slatted floors compared with those housed on solid concrete floors with deep bedding in all areas. However, there were no significant associations between floor type and abnormal gait in gilts. There was an increased risk of abnormal gait associated with increasing callus, bursitis and <b>capped</b> <b>hock</b> score on the limbs of finishing pigs. This might have occurred because limb lesions cause discomfort or because lame pigs spend more time lying and this increases the risk of limb lesions developing...|$|E
