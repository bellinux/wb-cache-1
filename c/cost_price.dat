40|$|Three {{different}} and feasible pricing strategies for public bus transport in India are {{developed in a}} partial equilibrium framework {{with the objective of}} improving economic efficiency and ensuring revenue adequacy, namely average <b>cost</b> <b>pricing,</b> marginal <b>cost</b> <b>pricing,</b> and two-part tariffs. These are assessed {{not only in terms of}} gains in economic efficiency, but also in changes in travel demand and consumer surplus. The estimated partial equilibrium price is higher in all three pricing regimes when compared to the current price. As a result, consumer surplus falls in all three cases. The price increase is much larger with average <b>cost</b> <b>pricing</b> compared to marginal <b>cost</b> <b>pricing</b> or two-part tariffs, and hence a larger fall in demand and consumer surplus occurs due to average <b>cost</b> <b>pricing.</b> While there is a gain in economic efficiency from marginal <b>cost</b> <b>pricing</b> and two-part tariffs, this improvement comes at the expense of reduced public bus transit demand and consumer surplus, given the price inelastic public bus transit demand estimated for India.

5|$|The Resale Prices Bill was {{introduced}} to deny manufacturers and suppliers the power to stipulate the prices at which their goods must be sold by the retailer. At the time, up to forty per cent of goods sold in Britain were subject to such price fixing, {{to the detriment of}} competition and to the disadvantage of the consumer. Douglas-Home, less instinctively liberal on economic matters than Heath, would probably not have sponsored such a proposal unprompted. However, he gave Heath his backing, in the face of opposition from some cabinet colleagues, including Butler, Hailsham and Lloyd, and a substantial number of Conservative backbenchers. They believed the change would benefit supermarkets and other large retailers at the expense of proprietors of small shops. The government was forced to make concessions to avoid defeat. Retail price maintenance would continue to be legal for some goods; these included books, on which it remained in force until market forces led to its abandonment in 1995. Manufacturers and suppliers would also be permitted to refuse to supply any retailer who sold their goods at less than <b>cost</b> <b>price,</b> as a loss leader. The bill had a difficult Parliamentary passage during which the Labour party generally abstained, leaving the Conservatives to vote for or against their own government. The bill received the royal assent in July 1964, but did not become operative until 1965, by which time Douglas-Home, Heath and their colleagues were out of office.|$|E

40|$|Most {{companies}} {{prefer to}} use absorption costing rule rather than marginal <b>cost</b> <b>pricing.</b> This article is aimed at defining the absorption costing rule as deriving from a principal-agent formulation of two tier organizations : (i) the upstream unit fixes the production capacity and uses it as a cost driver to compute the average cost (ii) the downstream unit operates {{on the market and}} chooses the output level {{on the basis of the}} average cost. Absorption costing results in two policies to be used according to the magnitude of the fixed cost. When the fixed cost is low, the capacity is fully used and a full <b>cost</b> <b>pricing</b> policy holds; when the fixed cost is high, a partial <b>cost</b> <b>pricing</b> policy holds since only a part of the fixed cost is passed on. The absorption costing rule competes with three pricing rules related to this two-tier structure and various payoffs functions associated to the decision levels: the separation, the tranfer pricing and the integration These rules are analyzed in the Cournot oligopoly case and comparisons in terms of profits are made. Except in the monopoly case, there exists a wide range of values of the fixed cost, for which the full <b>cost</b> <b>pricing</b> dominates all the other rules.

500|$|The {{real-world}} demand {{functions for}} urban road travel {{are more complex}} than the theoretical functions used in transport economics analysis. Congestion pricing was developed as a first-best solution, {{based on the assumption that}} the optimal price of road space equals the marginal <b>cost</b> <b>price</b> if all other goods in the economy are also marginal cost priced. In the real world this is not true, thus, actual implementation of congestion pricing is just a proxy or second-best solution. Based on the economic principles behind congestion pricing, the optimal congestion charge should make up for the difference between the average cost paid by the driver and the marginal cost imposed on other drivers (such as extra delay) and on society as a whole (such as air pollution). [...] The practical challenge of setting optimal link-based tolls is daunting given that neither the demand functions nor the link-specific speed-flow curves can be known precisely. Therefore, transport economists recognize that in practice setting the right price for the congestion charge becomes a trial and error experience.|$|E
500|$|Sylvia Pankhurst became {{increasingly}} disillusioned with the suffragette movement's inability {{to engage with}} the needs of working class women, so in 1912 she formed her own breakaway movement, the East London Federation of Suffragettes. [...] She based it at a baker's shop at Bow emblazoned with the slogan, [...] "Votes for Women", in large gold letters. The local Member of Parliament, George Lansbury, resigned his seat in the House of Commons to stand for election on a platform of women's enfranchisement. Pankhurst supported him in this, and Bow Road became the campaign office, culminating in a huge rally in nearby Victoria Park. Lansbury was narrowly defeated in the election, however, and support for the project in the East End was withdrawn. Pankhurst refocused her efforts, and with the outbreak of the First World War, she began a nursery, clinic and <b>cost</b> <b>price</b> canteen for the poor at the bakery. A paper, the Women's Dreadnought, was published to bring her campaign to a wider audience. Pankhurst spent twelve years in Bow fighting for women's rights. During this time, she risked constant arrest and spent many months in Holloway Prison, often on hunger strike. She finally achieved her aim of full adult female suffrage in 1928, and along the way she alleviated some of the poverty and misery, and improved social conditions for all in the East End.|$|E

If businesses could not reach a baseline profitability, they would be driven out of business sooner or later, or they would be taken over by another business and restructured, so that they did become sufficiently profitable. Inversely, if businesses overcharged for their commodities to obtain more profit, fewer people would buy them, and they would suffer decline as well.
