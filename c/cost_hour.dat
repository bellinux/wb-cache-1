Accuracy effort and schedule estimation is still a challenge. This paper introduces stream lining procedures from project work breakdown structure (WBS) evaluating the duration processes and either the input <b>cost</b> <b>hour</b> or the fixed costs. The measures are made via hypothesis testing over the responsibility assignment matrix (RAM). We propose a method for project cost construction using a spreadsheet to create an early-stage budget allocation. In this paper we argue that the simulated cost results present superior accuracy while establishing {{the applicability of the}} proposed simulation procedure. Generally, the precision is related with the WBS detailed design. The cost methodology approach offers a simplified decision tool for assessing the construction cost on the project managers’ decision...|$|E

This thesis documents the Systems Engineering process completed to conceive, design, and develop a desktop model that supports the investigation of training alternatives. The Naval Aviation Proficiency Analysis model incorporates the General Aviator Learning Equation methodology developed by the Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Divisions Human Performance Analysis and Instructional Systems Division into a user-friendly self-automated spreadsheet model. It analyzes downloading effortsmoving blocks of flights or simulators from a phase with higher platform operational cost to one with lower platform operational costand highlights the effects that downloading has on <b>cost,</b> <b>hour,</b> and skill proficiency differences across all pipeline skills. The next steps are to incorporate offloading (flights to simulators) and find optimal training solutions by incorporating an after-market solver. Outstanding ThesisCommander, United States Nav...|$|E

This thesis is {{an analysis of}} flight <b>hour</b> <b>cost</b> variance in the Naval Air Reserve and Fourth Marine Aircraft Wing. The broad objective of the thesis was to identify and analyze factors hypothesized to cause variance in <b>cost</b> per flight <b>hour.</b> An overview of the Naval Air Reserve Force Structure and budgetary organizations is presented. The relatively recent shift in the use and role of reserve forces towards Total Force concept goals is highlighted. An interview process is described in which four possible sources of <b>cost</b> per <b>hour</b> variance were identified for investigation: flight hours, primary mission area, repairables pipeline and overseas detachments by reserve VP squadrons. For each possible variance factor, statistical tests were applied to available cost data to determine if its impact on <b>cost</b> per <b>hour</b> variance was significant. Findings indicate that primary mission area and VP detachments each {{have a significant impact}} on <b>cost</b> per <b>hour</b> variance. Recommendations are provided concerning headquarters and field level flight budget execution. Conclusions pinpoint further areas of research gleaned from the investigation.

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, food {{processing}} {{has become one}} of the greatest energy converting stages of the food production supply chain. The interdependency of food, water, and energy leads to a need for more water efficient and energy effective ways to produce food. These studies focus on poultry chilling, primarily comparing the potential options of media that could be used during the poultry chilling sub-process. The conventional poultry chilling approach typically involves the immersion of chicken within chilled water in order to quickly decrease the chicken temperature, thus hindering the growth of bacteria. This research is an initial investigation of ice slurry as an energy and water efficient, pathogen reducing, and financially feasible chiller medium in poultry processing. The financial feasibility and electrical energy demand of using ice slurry were explored in a techno-economic model in HOMER Energy, which is a micro-grid design and optimization software. The thermal cooling capacity of ice slurry and fluidity of the solution allows for generation and storage to occur during low electricity <b>cost</b> <b>hours</b> and an application during high electricity <b>cost</b> <b>hours,</b> thus creating savings in electricity costs associated with poultry chilling. During the poultry chilling experimentation, chickens were spiked with Salmonella as temperature probes measured their core body temperature throughout their immersion within the different media. Greater pathogen reductions, faster cooling times, and less water consumption compared to chilled water promotes ice slurry as an alternate medium in the poultry processing industry. M. S...|$|R
30|$|As {{it is not}} {{possible}} to tell a priori the exact amount of time that these simulations will take to perform we instead define two metrics by which to compare the cost of using each offering: <b>cost</b> per simulation <b>hour</b> and maximum number of hours available within a single month. The <b>cost</b> per simulation <b>hour</b> for Cloud offerings is computed as p/c where p is defined as the unit <b>cost</b> per <b>hour,</b> for the Cloud instance, and c is the number of concurrent runs of CityCat that the instance can handle without each run affecting the others. For locally provisioned resources we can define the <b>cost</b> per unit <b>hour</b> as p=E/M, where E is the cost of purchasing the resource and M is the number of hours during which the work we are conducting must be completed – in our case one month. We appreciate that this artificially gives higher values for purchasing resources locally and hence do not use this as justification for using Cloud resources over local resources, only including it here for comparison.|$|R

40|$|In a {{previous}} paper, Theory and Application of the Equivalent System Mass Metric, Julie Levri, David Vaccari, and Alan Drysdale developed {{a method for}} computing the Equivalent System Mass (ESM) of crew time. ESM is an analog of cost. The suggested approach has been applied but seems to impose too high a cost for small additional requirements for crew time. The proposed method {{is based on the}} minimum average cost of crew time. In this work, the scheduling of crew time is examined in more detail, using suggested crew time allocations and daily work schedules. Crew tasks are typically assigned using priorities, which {{can also be used to}} construct a crew time demand curve mapping the value or <b>cost</b> per <b>hour</b> versus the total number of <b>hours</b> worked. The <b>cost</b> of additional crew time can be estimated by considering the intersection and shapes of the demand and supply curves. If e assume a mathematical form for the demand curve, a revised method can be developed for computing the cost or ESM of crew time. This method indicates a low <b>cost</b> per <b>hour</b> for small additional requirements for crew time and an increasing <b>cost</b> per <b>hour</b> for larger requirements...|$|R
