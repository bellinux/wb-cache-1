25|$|In chemistry, a <b>colloid</b> is {{a mixture}} in which one {{substance}} of microscopically dispersed insoluble particles is suspended throughout another substance. Sometimes the dispersed substance alone is called the colloid; the term colloidal suspension refers unambiguously to the overall mixture (although a narrower {{sense of the word}} suspension is distinguished from colloids by larger particle size). Unlike a solution, whose solute and solvent constitute only one phase, a <b>colloid</b> has a dispersed phase (the suspended particles) and a continuous phase (the medium of suspension).

40|$|Phosphorus (P) {{in natural}} waters may be bound to iron (Fe) bearing <b>colloids.</b> However, the natural {{variation}} in composition and P binding strength of these <b>colloids</b> remain unclear. We related {{the composition of}} "coarse colloids" (<b>colloids</b> in the 0. 1 - 1. 2 μm size range) in 47 Belgian streams to the chemical properties of the streamwater. On average, 29 % of the P in filtered (< 1. 2 μm) samples of these streams is present in coarse <b>colloids.</b> The concentration of Fe-rich <b>colloids</b> in streams decreases with increasing water hardness and pH. The P bearing <b>colloids</b> in these streams mostly consist of Fe hydroxyphosphates and of Fe oxyhydroxides with surface adsorbed P, which is underpinned by geochemical speciation calculations. In waters with molar P:Fe ratios above 0. 5, only a minor part of the P is bound to coarse <b>colloids.</b> In such waters, the <b>colloids</b> have molar P:Fe ratios between 0. 2 and 1 and are, therefore, nearly saturated with P. Conversely, in streams with molar P:Fe ratios below 0. 1, most of the P is bound to Fe-rich <b>colloids.</b> Equilibration of synthetic and natural Fe and P bearing <b>colloids</b> with a zero sink reveals that <b>colloids</b> with low molar P:Fe ratios contain mostly nonlabile P, whereas P-saturated <b>colloids</b> contain mostly labile P which can be released within 7 days. Equilibration at a fixed free orthophosphate activity shows that the Fe-rich <b>colloids</b> may bind only limited P through surface adsorption, {{in the range of}} 0. 02 - 0. 04 mol P (mol Fe) (- 1). The P:Fe ratios measured in naturally occurring Fe and P bearing <b>colloids</b> is clearly higher (between 0. 05 and 1).

40|$|Subsurface {{aeration}} is used {{to oxidise}} Fe in situ in groundwater to make the water potable. In a groundwater system with pH > 7, subsurface aeration results in a non-mobile Fe precipitate and mobile Fe <b>colloids.</b> Since originally the goal of subsurface aeration is to remove Fe in situ, the formation of non-mobile Fe precipitate is the desired result. In addition to this intended effect, subsurface aeration may also strongly enhance the microbiological removal of NH 4 in the purification station. A hypothesis is that mobile Fe <b>colloids</b> may be the link between subsurface aeration and the {{positive effect on the}} microbiological removal of NH 4. The objective {{of this study is to}} characterise the mobile Fe <b>colloids</b> and to derive a synthetic substitute for the naturally formed Fe <b>colloids</b> in order to be able to apply the Fe <b>colloids</b> as a management tool to enhance the removal of NH 4 in the process of producing drinking water from groundwater. At a purification station in The Netherlands natural Fe <b>colloids</b> from an aerated well were sampled. Furthermore, eight synthetic Fe <b>colloids</b> were prepared by oxidising synthetic solutions differing in elemental composition. The <b>colloids</b> were analysed using chemical analysis and electron microscopy (SEM and SEM-EDAX). The Fe <b>colloids</b> sampled in the field contained Fe, Ca, Na, PO 4 and Mn. Also in the synthetic Fe <b>colloids</b> PO 4, Ca, Na and Mn were the most important elements next to Fe. Phosphate and dissolved organic C strongly influenced the morphology of the synthetic Fe <b>colloids.</b> When both the elemental composition and the morphology of the Fe <b>colloids</b> are taken into account, the synthetic Fe <b>colloids</b> formed in the synthetic solution containing Fe, Mn, PO 4, SiO 4 and dissolved organic matter best match the Fe <b>colloids</b> from the field.

40|$|Field {{application}} of livestock manure introduces <b>colloids</b> and veterinary antibiotics, e. g. sulfonamides (SAs), into farmland. The presence of manure <b>colloids</b> may potentially intensify the SAs-pollution to soils and groundwater by colloid-facilitated transport. Transport of three SAs, sulfadiazine (SDZ), sulfamethoxypyridazine (SMPD), and sulfamoxole (SMOX), {{was investigated in}} saturated soil columns with and without manure <b>colloids</b> from sows and farrows, weaners, and fattening pigs. Experimental results showed that colloid-facilitated transport of SMOX was significant {{in the presence of}} manure <b>colloids</b> from fattening pigs with low C/N ratio, high SUVA 280 nm and protein C, while manure <b>colloids</b> from sows and farrows and weaners had little effect on SMOX transport. In contrast, only retardation was observed for SDZ and SMPD when manure <b>colloids</b> were present. Breakthrough curves (BTCs) of <b>colloids</b> and SAs were replicated well by a newly developed numerical model that considers colloid-filtration theory, competitive kinetic sorption, and co-transport processes. Model results demonstrate that mobile <b>colloids</b> act as carriers for SMOX, while immobile <b>colloids</b> block SMOX from sorbing onto the soil. The low affinity of SMOX to sorb on immobile <b>colloids</b> prevents aggregation and also promotes SMOX's colloid-facilitated transport. Conversely, the high affinity of SDZ and SMPD to sorb on all types of immobile <b>colloids</b> retarded their transport. Thus, manure properties play a fundamental role in increasing the leaching risk of hydrophobic sulfonamides...|$|R
