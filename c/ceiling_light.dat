25|$|In March 1983 the Alfetta {{received}} its last facelift; the exterior was modernised with newly designed bumpers (integrating a front spoiler and extending {{to the wheel}} openings), a new grille, lower body plastic cladding, silver hubcaps and, at the rear, a full width grey plastic fascia supporting rectangular tail lights with ribbed lenses and the number plate. The C-pillar ventilation outlets were moved to {{each side of the}} rear screen. Inside there were a redesigned dashboard and instrumentation, new door panels and the check control panel from the Quadrifoglio Oro on all models. Top of the range models adopted an overhead console, which extended for the full length of the roof and housed three reading spot lamps, a central <b>ceiling</b> <b>light,</b> and controls for the electric windows. Alongside the facelift two new models were introduced: the 2.4 Turbo Diesel, which in most markets gradually replaced the previous 2.0-litre which was instead installed in the marginally smaller Giulietta. There was also a renewed two-liter Quadrifoglio Oro, equipped with electronic fuel injection. Thanks to the Bosch Motronic integrated electronic fuel injection and ignition the QO had the same 130PS output of the carburetted 2.0, while developing more torque and being more fuel efficient.|$|E
500|$|The police entered around 7:54am with a {{sledgehammer}} {{through the back}} door. The door had been locked from the inside, with the key still in the lock. They found five bodies with multiple gunshot wounds, Nevill downstairs {{in the kitchen and}} the rest upstairs. Twenty-five shots had been fired, mostly at close range. In what order the family was killed is not known. A telephone was lying on one of the kitchen surfaces with its receiver off the hook, next to several [...]22 shells. The police said chairs and stools were overturned, and there was broken crockery, a broken sugar basin, and what looked like blood on the floor. A <b>ceiling</b> <b>light</b> lampshade had been broken.|$|E
500|$|Gaseous {{mercury is}} used in mercury-vapor lamps and some [...] "neon sign" [...] type {{advertising}} signs and fluorescent lamps. Those low-pressure lamps emit very spectrally narrow lines, which are traditionally used in optical spectroscopy for calibration of spectral position. Commercial calibration lamps are sold for this purpose; reflecting a fluorescent <b>ceiling</b> <b>light</b> into a spectrometer is a common calibration practice. Gaseous mercury {{is also found in}} some electron tubes, including ignitrons, thyratrons, and mercury arc rectifiers. It is also used in specialist medical care lamps for skin tanning and disinfection. Gaseous mercury is added to cold cathode argon-filled lamps to increase the ionization and electrical conductivity. An argon-filled lamp without mercury will have dull spots and will fail to light correctly. Lighting containing mercury can be bombarded/oven pumped only once. When added to neon filled tubes the light produced will be inconsistent red/blue spots until the initial burning-in process is completed; eventually it will light a consistent dull off-blue color.|$|E

2500|$|A {{lampholder}} plug {{fits into}} the bayonet cap or Edison screw socket of a lampholder {{in place of a}} light bulb and enables an electrical appliance to be powered from a wall or <b>ceiling</b> <b>light</b> fitting. As mentioned in Early History above, they were first introduced in the late 1800s and in use to the 1960s in situations where wall sockets were scarce and sometimes non-existent in some rooms (bathrooms, cellars, attics, etc.). Also, as in some countries (such as Italy) electricity was supplied on a [...] "split tariff" [...] basis with electricity for lighting being charged at a lower rate than that for other purposes, lampholder plugs enabled the consumers to reduce their electricity costs and were thus in broad use.|$|E
2500|$|The {{problem of}} leaks is further aggravated {{by the fact}} that many of them involve {{corrosive}} salt water. This is caused by the proximity of Boston Harbor and the Atlantic Ocean, causing a mix of salt and fresh water leaks in the tunnel. The situation is made worse by road salt spread in the tunnel to melt ice during freezing weather, or brought in by vehicles passing through. Salt water and salt spray are well-known issues that must be dealt with in any marine environment. It has been reported that [...] "hundreds of thousands of gallons of salt water are pumped out monthly" [...] in the Big Dig, and a map has been prepared showing [...] "hot spots" [...] where water leakage is especially serious. Salt-accelerated corrosion has caused <b>ceiling</b> <b>light</b> fixtures to fail (see below), but can also cause rapid deterioration of embedded rebar and other structural steel reinforcements holding the tunnel walls and ceiling in place.|$|E

50|$|The {{power control}} in a C-Bus system {{lies in a}} “Dimmer” or “Relay” which is {{installed}} in the DB and replaces the traditional switch used in conventional wiring. This Dimmer (or Relay) has a 120/220V Line interconnection directly to the <b>ceiling</b> <b>light</b> and a neutral connection back from the <b>ceiling</b> <b>light</b> to the Dimmer. The Dimmer will control the light directly and will receive its commands from another device on the C-Bus network (for example, a wall mounted light switch/keypad). This wall mounted light switch would not be connected to any load whatsoever; it would be directly connected with the Dimmer {{by means of a}} control/signaling cable. The Dimmers normally come as 4-, 8- or 12-channel DIN-rail mounted devices.|$|E
