5|$|In {{the time}} since the initial <b>commercial</b> <b>service</b> to Roanoke {{commenced}} in 1933, various airlines have offered non-stop service to and from Roanoke.

5|$|The 767-200 was the {{original}} model and entered service with United Airlines in 1982. The type has been used primarily by mainline U.S. carriers for domestic routes between major hub centers such as Los Angeles to Washington. The 767-200 was the first aircraft to be used on transatlantic ETOPS flights, beginning with TWA on February 1, 1985 under 90-minute diversion rules. Deliveries for the variant totaled 128 aircraft. There were 44 passenger and freighter conversions of the model in <b>commercial</b> <b>service</b> as of July 2016. The type's competitors included the Airbus A300 and A310.|$|E
5|$|The 777 {{first entered}} <b>commercial</b> <b>service</b> with United Airlines on June 7, 1995. It has {{received}} more orders than any other wide-body airliner; as of September 2017, 60 customers had placed orders for 1,945 aircraft of all variants, with 1,518 delivered. The most common and successful variant is the 777-300ER with 758 delivered and 829 orders; Emirates operates the largest 777 fleet, with 161 passenger and freighter aircraft as of July 2017. The 777 {{has been involved in}} six hull losses as of October 2016; the Asiana Airlines Flight 214 accident in July 2013 was its first fatal crash in 18 years of service.|$|E
5|$|United Airlines first {{placed the}} 767 in <b>commercial</b> <b>service</b> in 1982. The {{aircraft}} was initially flown on domestic and transcontinental routes, during which it demonstrated {{the reliability of}} its twinjet design. In 1985, the 767 became the first twin-engined airliner to receive regulatory approval for extended overseas flights. The aircraft was then used to expand non-stop service on medium- to long-haul intercontinental routes. In 1986, Boeing initiated studies for a higher-capacity 767, ultimately leading {{to the development of}} the 777, a larger wide-body twinjet. In the 1990s, the 767 became the most frequently used airliner for transatlantic flights between North America and Europe.|$|E

The attention in the interpretation of the results is paid to cooperation between businessmen. There is also the analysis of the microregions activity followed by suggestions and recommendations for the improvement of the microregion functioning...|$|R

5|$|A {{specialized}} test train, Dasye set744 in a commemorative livery, {{arrived to}} conduct the fourth phase of testing, which began on 28 September 2015. During this phase, more than 200 test runs would be performed on the line. The test runs would test ride smoothness, performance of the catenary, radio communications, and the signalling system. During some runs, the test train would operate at 10% above the planned operational speeds for the line when it enters service. Some automated safety systems were disabled to allow the test train to operate beyond normal operating conditions. Orientation training for operators was scheduled to take place between January and March 2016 {{prior to the start}} of <b>commercial</b> <b>service</b> on the line, which was scheduled for 3 April 2016 at the time of the accident. In January 2016, SNCF announced that the opening of the line would be delayed until to 3 July 2016.|$|E
5|$|A {{year after}} {{entering}} <b>commercial</b> <b>service,</b> the Comets began suffering problems, {{with three of}} them breaking up during mid-flight in well-publicised accidents. Two of these {{were found to be}} caused by catastrophic failure resulting from metal fatigue in the airframes, not well understood at the time. The other one was due to overstressing of the airframe during flight through severe weather. The Comet was withdrawn from service and extensively tested to discover the causes of the fatigue failures. Design flaws, including dangerous stresses at the corners of the square avionics windows and installation methods, were ultimately identified. As a result, the Comet was extensively redesigned with oval windows, structural reinforcement, and other changes. Rival manufacturers meanwhile heeded the lessons learned from the Comet while developing their own aircraft.|$|E
5|$|On 26 October 1952, the Comet {{suffered}} {{its first}} hull loss when a BOAC flight departing Rome's Ciampino airport failed to become airborne {{and ran into}} rough ground {{at the end of}} the runway. Two passengers sustained minor injuries, and the aircraft, G-ALYZ, was a total loss. On 3 March 1953, a new Canadian Pacific Airlines Comet 1A, registered CF-CUN and named Empress of Hawaii, failed to become airborne while attempting a night takeoff from Karachi, Pakistan, on a delivery flight to Australia. The aircraft plunged into a dry drainage canal and collided with an embankment, killing all five crew and six passengers on board. The accident was the first fatal jetliner crash, as well as the Comet's first accident to result in fatalities. In response, Canadian Pacific cancelled its remaining order for a second Comet 1A and never operated the type in <b>commercial</b> <b>service.</b>|$|E
