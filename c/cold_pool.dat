5|$|A cold-core low, {{also known}} as an upper level low or cold-core cyclone, is a cyclone aloft which has an {{associated}} <b>cold</b> <b>pool</b> of air residing at high altitude within the Earth's troposphere. It is a low pressure system that strengthens with height {{in accordance with the}} thermal wind relationship. If a weak surface circulation forms in response to such a feature at subtropical latitudes of the eastern north Pacific or north Indian oceans, it is called a subtropical cyclone. Cloud cover and rainfall mainly occurs with these systems during the day. Severe weather, such as tornadoes, can occur near the center of cold-core lows. Cold lows can help spawn cyclones with significant weather impacts, such as polar lows, and Von Karman Vortices. Cold lows can lead directly to the development of tropical cyclones, owing to their associated <b>cold</b> <b>pool</b> of air aloft or by acting as additional outflow channels to aid in further development.|$|E

We present an observed case of convectively-driven water vapour transport crossing the Sahara over 2. 5 days in June 2012, from the Sahel {{in the south to}} the Atlas in the north. A daily cycle is observed, with deep convection in the evening generating moist <b>cold</b> <b>pools</b> that fed the next day’s convection; the convection then generated new <b>cold</b> <b>pools,</b> providing a vertical recycling of moisture. Trajectories driven by analyses were able to capture the direction of the transport but not its full extent, particularly at night when <b>cold</b> <b>pools</b> are most active, and analyses missed much of the water content of <b>cold</b> <b>pools.</b> The results highlight the importance of <b>cold</b> <b>pools</b> for moisture transport, dust and clouds, and demonstrate the need to include these processes in models in order to improve the representation of Saharan atmospher...|$|R
40|$|Deep moist {{convection}} and mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) {{are integral}} to the West African monsoon and, as the main rain-producing mechanism in the Sahel, {{are essential to the}} livelihoods of millions. Current operational forecasting models struggle to predict rainfall with a good precision. It is therefore necessary to study the processes controlling deep moist convection in detail, in order to understand them better {{and to be able to}} evaluate simulations to identify errors for future model development. In this thesis properties of <b>cold</b> <b>pools</b> from Sahelian MCSs were characterised from surface observations. It was observed that early season <b>cold</b> <b>pools</b> were stronger and drier, likely due to drier mid-levels before the monsoon onset. The properties of observed <b>cold</b> <b>pools</b> were used to evaluate a Unified Model (UM) convection-permitting simulation. The comparison showed that simulated <b>cold</b> <b>pools</b> are generally weaker than observed. <b>Cold</b> <b>pools</b> and MCS structure were further investigated in two case studies. This enabled an analysis of MCS vertical structure. Processes controlling the diurnal cycle of convection were analysed using observations and UM simulations. This showed that while surface CAPE follows a diurnal cycle with a maximum in the afternoon and minimum in the early morning, elevated CAPE was found to have a nearly opposite cycle, due to advection of high equivalent potential temperature air overnight by the nocturnal low-level jet. In addition, the low-level jet provides low-level wind shear which balances the cold-pool related vorticity and helps to maintain the MCS until morning, when the jet decays and MCSs tend to dissipate. The jet also creates moisture flux convergence overnight, supporting MCSs. Finally, mechanisms underlying storm initiation and regeneration were analysed in UM simulations, showing the roles of soil moisture boundaries, pre-existing <b>cold</b> <b>pools</b> and bookend vortices...|$|R

2500|$|Finally, in {{any type}} of thunderstorms, the surface <b>cold</b> <b>pool</b> of air {{associated}} the downdraft will stabilize the air and form a cloud free area which will end along the gust front. This mesoscale front, when moving into a warm and unstable air mass, will lift it and cumulus clouds appear on satellite pictures. This line is likely the point of further convection and storms. One can notice it {{at the leading edge}} of a squall line, in the southeastern quadrant of a typical supercell (in the northern hemisphere), or different regions around other thunderstorms. They may also be visible as an outflow boundary hours or days after convection and can pinpoint areas of favored thunderstorm development, possible direction of movement, and even likelihood for tornadoes. The speed of forward movement of the outflow boundary or gust front to some degree modulates the likelihood of tornadoes and helps determine whether a storm will be enhanced by its presence or the inflow be choked off thus weakening and possibly killing the storm. [...] Thunderstorms may move along slow moving or stationary outflow boundaries and tornadoes are more likely; whereas fast moving gust fronts in many cases weaken thunderstorms after impact and are less likely to produce tornadoes—although brief tornadoes may occur at the time of impact. Fast moving gust fronts may eventually decelerate and become slow moving or stationary outflow boundaries with the characteristic [...] "agitated area" [...] of cumulus fields previously mentioned.|$|E

40|$|Convective <b>cold</b> <b>pools</b> and the {{breakdown}} of nocturnal low-level jets (NLLJs) are key meteorological drivers of dust emission over summertime West Africa, the world's largest dust source. This study {{is the first to}} quantify their relative contributions and physical interrelations using objective detection algorithms and an off-line dust emission model applied to convection-permitting simulations from the Met Office Unified Model. The study period covers 25 July to 02 September 2006. All estimates may therefore vary on an interannual basis. The main conclusions are as follows: (a) approximately 40 % of the dust emissions are from NLLJs, 40 % from <b>cold</b> <b>pools,</b> and 20 % from unidentified processes (dry convection, land-sea and mountain circulations); (b) {{more than half of the}} cold-pool emissions are linked to a newly identified mechanism where aged <b>cold</b> <b>pools</b> form a jet above the nocturnal stable layer; (c) 50 % of the dust emissions occur from 1500 to 0200 LT with a minimum around sunrise and after midday, and 60 % of the morning-to-noon emissions occur under clear skies, but only 10 % of the afternoon-to-nighttime emissions, suggesting large biases in satellite retrievals; (d) considering precipitation and soil moisture effects, cold-pool emissions are reduced by 15 %; and (e) models with parameterized convection show substantially less cold-pool emissions but have larger NLLJ contributions. The results are much more sensitive to whether convection is parameterized or explicit than to the choice of the land-surface characterization, which generally is a large source of uncertainty. This study demonstrates the need of realistically representing moist convection and stable nighttime conditions for dust modeling.

40|$|A basic {{understanding}} of the mechanisms controlling the characteristics of thermally induced mesoscale circulations rests primarily on observations and model studies of dry convection, whereas the influence of moist convection on these characteristics is not well understood. Large-eddy simulations are used to investigate the effect of moist convection on an idealized mesoscale circulation. Sensitivity studies show that moist convection has a significant influence {{on the characteristics of}} the mesoscale circulation. We identify three distinct convective phases that influence the mesoscale circulation within the diurnal cycle: firstly, dry convective onset, with a weak circulation and a breeze front that propagates slowly from the cold region into the warmer fluid {{as a result of the}} surface discontinuity; secondly, a deep convective phase, where the circulation intensifies and the breeze front propagates faster; and finally a precipitating phase, where strong <b>cold</b> <b>pools</b> develop at the breeze front and accelerate the propagation speed further. Classical density-current theory fails to represent the second phase and is extended using the cloud-base mass flux to account for the observed effects of moist non-precipitating convection on the propagation speed.

40|$|Supplementary {{material}} {{included in}} separate file. This article was {{originally published in}} International Journal of Climatology and is copyrighted by the Royal Meteorological SocietyCold air drainage and pooling occur in many mountain valleys, especially at night and during winter. Local climate regimes associated with frequent <b>cold</b> air <b>pooling</b> have substantial impacts on species phenology, distribution and diversity. However, {{little is known about}} how the degree and frequency of cold air drainage and pooling will respond to a changing climate. Evidence suggests that, because <b>cold</b> <b>pools</b> are decoupled from the free atmosphere, these local climates may not respond {{in the same way as}} regional-scale climates estimated from coarse-grid general circulation models. Indeed, recent studies have demonstrated that historical changes in the frequency of synoptic conditions have produced complex spatial variations in the resulting climatic changes on the ground. In the mountainous terrain of the Oregon Cascades, we show that, at relatively exposed hill slope and ridge top locations, air temperatures are highly coupled to changes in synoptic circulation patterns at the 700 -hPa level, whereas in sheltered valley bottoms, <b>cold</b> air <b>pooling</b> at night and during winter causes temperatures to be largely decoupled from, and relatively insensitive to, 700 -hPa flow variations. The result is a complex temperature landscape composed of steep gradients in temporal variation, controlled largely by gradients in elevation and topographic position. When a projected climate warming of 2. 5 °C was combined with likely changes in the frequency distribution of synoptic circulation, modelled temperature changes at closely spaced locations diverged widely (by up to 6 °C), with differences equalling or exceeding that of the imposed regional temperature change. Because <b>cold</b> air <b>pooling</b> and consequent atmospheric decoupling occur in many mountain valleys, especially at high latitudes, this phenomenon is likely to be an important consideration in understanding the impacts of climate change in mountainous regions...|$|R
40|$|The tropics are {{the main}} region for troposphere-to-stratosphere {{transport}} (TST) of air. One of the dominant mechanisms that control tropical TST of water vapor is freeze-drying by the cold tropical tropopause. This mechanism is supported by evidence from satellite observations of the "tape recorder", where seasonal changes in stratospheric water vapor are in phase with seasonal changes in tropopause temperatures in the tropics. Over the last few years, however, {{the concept of the}} tropical tropopause has evolved from a single material surface to a layer called the Tropical Tropopause Layer (TTL). A recent hypothesis on dehydration mechanisms suggests that dehydration and entry point into the stratosphere are not always co-located (Holton and Gettelman, 2001). Instead, dehydration can occur during horizontal advection through Lagrangian 'cold pools', or coldest regions along a parcel's trajectory, as air ascends within the TTL while the entry point into the stratosphere occurs at a different geographical location. In this study, we investigate the impact that these Lagrangian <b>cold</b> <b>pools</b> have on TTL moisture. For this purpose, we use in situ measurements of TTL water vapor obtained aboard NASA's WB- 57 aircraft over the Eastern Tropical Pacific, and we compare these measurements to minimum saturation water vapor mixing ratios obtained from three-dimensional backward trajectory calculations. Aircraft measurements show frequent unsaturated conditions, which suggest that the entry value of stratospheric water vapor in this region was not set by local saturation conditions. Trajectory calculations, driven by both ECMWF operational analysis and reanalysis winds and temperature fields, are used to explore the impact (e. g., geographical location, timing, dehydration magnitude) of the Lagrangian <b>cold</b> <b>pools</b> intercepted by the parcels sampled by the aircraft. We find noteworthy differences in the location of the Lagrangian <b>cold</b> <b>pools</b> using the two ECMWF data sets, namely influence of the Western Tropical Pacific region when using operational analysis fields versus influence of the Eastern Tropical Pacific and South America regions when using reanalysis fields. These results {{have a significant impact on}} our scientific conclusions on dehydration mechanisms affecting the air sampled by the aircraft, given that these regions have different thermodynamic and convective properties...|$|R
