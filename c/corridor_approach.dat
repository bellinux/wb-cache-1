40|$|This report investigates in {{what way}} the {{provision}} and management of infrastructure (or shortcomings therein) has constrained or enabled mining investment and local firm linkages to this mining activity (with a primary focus on the recent experience on Tanzania?s Central Development Corridor and the Zambezi Valley in Mozambique). ? The usefulness of the development <b>corridor</b> <b>approach</b> to enhance the scope for linked small enterprise development and more diversified economic development is explored {{in the context of}} increased minerals investment. The points of focus in the research demonstrate an awareness of the need to break away from the so-called “enclave” model of resource extraction that characterized Africa?s colonial past where infrastructure developed primarily to serve narrow interests and objectives of those seeking to exploit the continent?s resources. ? For governments and other stakeholders managing the complexities associated with configuring and timing large-scale infrastructure investments to enable much needed foreign direct investment, the development <b>corridor</b> <b>approach</b> has been suggested as one which might offer scope for balancing the needs of large scale, largely foreign, investors with those of wider domestic economic and social interests. The study findings point to a variety of factors that have made the necessary coordination by different stakeholders hard to achieve: at best a process with limited and incremental gains in Tanzania but one with a higher degree of measured progress in Mozambique. By adopting progressive policies and creative solutions to the delivery of infrastructure upgrades in the Zambezi Valley, it appears that the prospects for leveraging mineral investments to enable diversified economic development have been enhanced. On the Central Development Corridor, the continuing dysfunctionality of much of the corridor infrastructure continues to constrain “anchor” mineral investments, wider domestic business growth and the appetite for greater local procurement by the mining companies. Issues associated with mining of different commodity types, political will and forms of regional collaboration and their impact on the potential utility of the development <b>corridor</b> <b>approach</b> are also discussed. ...|$|E

The OMSI, a multi-agency task force, has been carrying out "hot spot" policing practices focused on traffic corridors in high crime areas. The purpose of OMSI operations is to deter crime through a highly visible "guardianship" presence that emphasizes contacts with citizens. Findings showed that a <b>corridor</b> <b>approach</b> was consistent with a "hot spot" policing strategy, in that operations occurred in hi-density crime areas. Nine crime categories were examined to assess the efficacy of 41 operations carried out in 2008. Generally, OMSI revealed a short term deterrent on crime, with the actual deterrent effect associated with the kind of crime assessed. Business crimes tended to show the most consistent operational deterrent effects. Effects also were more consistent in precincts with greater crime density.

40|$|Preliminary version, do not quote, do not {{circulate}} In this paper, {{we examine}} the value relevance of pension accounting information for a sample of German companies for the years 1999 to 2006. Because of a particular regulatory and taxation framework, German companies traditionally do not fund their defined benefit pension obligations externally. Thus, unlike companies from the U. S. or from other Anglo-Saxon countries many German companies show large net pension liabilities in their balance sheets. We make use of this situation and provide an in-depth analysis of the value relevance of German companies ’ level- 3 pension obligation fair values. In line with Barth et al. (1993), and in contrast to Coronado and Sharpe (2003), we find that German companies ’ financial status related pension accounting information is more closely associated with stock prices than pension cost information.

40|$|Managing {{traffic in}} urban areas is a complex affair. The same becomes more {{challenging}} when one needs {{to take into account}} the prioritized movement of emergency vehicles along with the normal flow of traffic. Although, mechanisms have been proposed to model intelligent traffic management systems, a concentrated effort to facilitate the movement of emergency services amongst urban traffic is yet to be formalized. This paper proposes a distributed multi-agent based mechanism to create partial green corridors for the movement of emergency service vehicles such as ambulances, fire brigade and police vans, amidst urban traffic. The proposed approach makes se of a digital network of traffic signal nodes equipped with traffic sensors and an agent framework to autonomously extend, maintain and manage partial green corridors for such emergency vehicles. The approach was emulated using Tartarus, an agent framework over a LAN. The results gathered under varying traffic conditions and also several emergency vehicles, validate the performance of this approach and its effects on the movement of normal traffic. Comparisons with the non-prioritized and full green corridor approaches indicate that the proposed partial <b>corridor</b> <b>approach</b> outperforms the rest...|$|E

40|$|The Transportation {{field is}} moving forward with an Integrated <b>Corridor</b> Management (ICM) <b>approach</b> whose aim is to manage the highway {{corridors}} as a multimodal system, and allows professionals to introduce operational decisions {{for the benefit of}} the corridor as a whole. Through this approach, travelers will be able to make educated decisions in choosing their method and route of travel, allowing highway corridors to realize significant improvements in the efficient movement of people and goods. Border crossing locations are receiving attention from various stakeholders and partnerships, and substantial funding is being provided with the aim of implementing an Integrated <b>Corridor</b> Management <b>approach</b> at borders. The efficient flow of border access points are of particular importance to the economies of adjacent countries as it is the entry point of commuters, travelers, and commercial trade between countries. Current technology being utilized involves the use of Bluetooth readers and vehicle detectors, which help determine service flow rates, cars in queue, and wait time information. With this technology however, there are often long waits, heavy congestion, unpredictable crossing times, and an imbalance between different crossing locations, negatively affecting the environment, quality of life, and economic competiveness. These problems often arise due to a lack of information for commuters, capacity constraints, and limited crossing options, all which can be mitigated through an Integrated <b>Corridor</b> Management <b>approach.</b> An Integrated <b>Corridor</b> Management <b>approach</b> will eventually be implemented at borders, which will include policies and procedures to address recurring and nonrecurring congestion, utilizing advanced modeling, and a data-driven decision support tool to provide relevant information to travelers.

40|$|We {{focus on}} {{accounting}} for unfunded defined benefit pension plans according to IAS 19 {{and compare the}} option to recognise any actuarial gain or loss immediately outside profit or loss in a separate statement within equity ('equity approach') with the 'corridor approach'. The objective is to detect systematic differences in long-term pure accounting effects, which {{can be seen by}} the different cumulated net-amounts not (yet) recognised in profit or loss. Due to the complexity and the probabilistic elements, human expectations on system behaviour often fail. Therefore, we have performed the first Monte-Carlo-simulation study of the accounting options. The assumptions concerning input data are based on official German statistics and, therefore, are representative at least for Germany and similar countries. As a result, the belief of long-term offsetting of cumulated actuarial gains and losses is not accurate. The former unforeseeable consequences are the following: if we apply the equity approach we identify a tendency for a quasi-permanent cumulated actuarial net-gain (regenerating workforce) or a permanent cumulated actuarial net-loss (degenerating workforce) recognised outside profit or loss. If the <b>corridor</b> <b>approach</b> is applied, a tendency for quasi-permanent cumulated unrecognised net-gains is reported while amortising any corridor excess {{in the case of a}} regenerating workforce. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} seasonal {{and spatial}} linkages between N cycling and organic matter for a suburban stream in Maryland and addressed the question: How do longitudinal NH 4 + uptake patterns vary seasonally {{and what is}} the effect of organic matter, stream size, transient storage and debris dams? We applied a longitudinal (stream channel <b>corridor)</b> <b>approach</b> in a forested stream section and conducted short-term nutrient addition experiments (adapted to account for the effect of nutrient saturation) covering 14 – 16 reaches, and compared two distinct seasons (late fall 2003 and late summer 2004). Longitudinal NH 4 + uptake rate patterns had a distinct seasonal reversal; fall had the highest uptake rates in the upper reaches, while summer had the highest uptake rates in the lower reaches. This seasonal reversal was attributed to organic matter and evidenced by DON patterns. Transient storage did not have an expected effect on uptake rates in fall because it was confounded by leaf litter; litter produced higher uptakes, but also may have reduced transient storage. In summer however, uptake rates had a positive correlation with transient storage. Debris dams had no distinct effect on uptake in fall because of their recent formation. In summer however, the debris dam effect was significant; although the debris dams were hydraulically inactive then, the upstream reaches had 2 – 5 fold higher uptake rates. The seasonal and longitudinal differences in NH 4 + uptake reflect interactions between flow conditions and the role of organic matter. Urbanization can alter both of these characteristics, hence affect stream N processing...|$|E

40|$|Habitat {{corridors}} {{are important}} tools for maintaining connectivity in increasingly fragmented landscapes, but generally {{they have been}} considered in single-species <b>approaches.</b> <b>Corridors</b> intended to facilitate the movement of multiple species could increase persistence of entire communities, but at the likely cost of being less efficient for any given species than a corridor intended specifically for that species. There have been few tests of the trade-offs between single- and multispecies <b>corridor</b> <b>approaches.</b> We assessed single-species and multispecies habitat corridors for 5 threatened mammal species in tropical forests of Borneo. We generated maps {{of the cost of}} movement across the landscape for each species based on the species’ local abundance as estimated through hierarchical modeling of camera-trap data with biophysical and anthropogenic covariates. Elevation influenced local abundance of banded civets (Hemigalus derbyanus) and sun bears (Helarctos malayanus). Increased road density was associated with lower local abundance of Sunda clouded leopards (Neofelis diardi) and higher local abundance of sambar deer (Rusa unicolor). Pig-tailed macaque (Macaca nemestrina) local abundance was lower in recently logged areas. An all-species-combined connectivity scenario with least-cost paths and 1 km buffers generated total movement costs that were 27 % and 23 % higher for banded civets and clouded leopards, respectively, than the connectivity scenarios for those species individually. A carnivore multispecies connectivity scenario, however, increased movement cost by 2 % for banded civets and clouded leopards. Likewise, an herbivore multispecies scenario provided more effective connectivity than the all-species-combined scenario for sambar and macaques. We suggest that multispecies habitat connectivity plans be tailored to groups of ecologically similar, disturbance-sensitive species to maximize their effectiveness...|$|R

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the effect of}} concentration on nitrogen uptake patterns for a suburban stream in Maryland and addressed the question: How does NO 3 − uptake change {{as a function of}} concentration and how do uptake patterns compare with those found for NH 4 +? We applied a longitudinal (stream channel <b>corridor)</b> <b>approach</b> in a forested stream section and conducted short-term nutrient addition experiments in late summer 2004. In the downstream direction, NO 3 − concentrations decreased because of residential development in headwaters and downstream dilution; NH 4 + concentrations slightly increased. The uptake patterns for NO 3 − were very different from NH 4 +. While NH 4 + had a typical negative relationship between first-order uptake rate constant (K c) and stream size, NO 3 − had a reverse pattern. We found differences for other metrics, including uptake velocity (V f) and areal uptake rate (U). We attributed these differences to a stream size effect, a concentration effect and a biological uptake capacity effect. For NO 3 − these combined effects produced a downstream increase in K c, V f and U; for NH 4 + they produced a downstream decrease in K c and V f, and a not well defined pattern for U. We attributed a downstream increase in NO 3 − uptake capacity to an increase in hyporheic exchange and a likely increase in carbon availability. We also found that K c and V f were indirectly related with concentration. Similar evidence of ‘nutrient saturation’ has been reported in other recent studies. Our results suggest that higher-order uptake models might be warranted when scaling NO 3 − uptake across watersheds that are subject to increased nitrogen loading...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Authors:Stefan Harrå and Magnus Björk Advisor: Markku Penttinen Title: Accounting Consequences of {{the change}} in pension {{accounting}} Background to problem: When the revised IAS 19 comes into force January 1, 2013, it means that two of the three accounting principles for defined benefit pension plans are disappearing, including the corridor method. The corridor method has made it possible for companies to defer its actuarial gains and losses. Now that the <b>corridor</b> <b>approach</b> abolished then the unrecognized actuarial gains and losses immediately be covered by equity, which involves very large amounts of some companies. Why the amounts have grown so big is much because of the discount rate. The discount rate is a controversial parameter, and there is disagreement on how it should be fixed. Purpose: The purpose of this thesis is to examine the accounting implications this will have for the company applied the corridor method, and if there is some parameters in the actuarial assumption that is more important than others. Methodology: The thesis has mainly been based on a qualitative research through qualitative interviews with a small sample that is affected by this change. There are quantitative elements to a greater depth by examining the annual reports, discount and deferred pension liabilities of the various companies. The approach is exploratory as it is a qualitative study and there was little knowledge of the subject before the work of it started. Therefore, a study of literature, regulations and previous research before the empirical study. This made it possible to gain a broader understanding of the subject and to shape relevant and essential interview questions. Conclusions: The conclusion shows that the largest accounting consequences for the companies in the study in conjunction with the change is that the unrecognized actuarial gains and losses will now be covered by equity and that the expected return on plan assets is based on the discount rate. The study also shows that it is the discount rate which is considered the most important parameter that the companies are looking at in the actuarial assumption. The conclusion also provides a shared sense of the true and fair picture of the companies after the revised IAS 19. Suggestions for further research: That after 2013 to study how the actual result of this rule change did this compare to the expected. Look at the problem of determining the discount rate. How will the IASB look at it if more and more begin to deviate from the standard?

40|$|This paper makes a {{case for}} linking Africa through {{regional}} infrastructure by showing that soundinfrastructure is critical to any development process and thus impacts {{on the quality of}} development ofany country or region and consequently on {{the quality of life of}} its people. The critical role of infrastructurein the global economy is well articulated pointing out that as globalization and liberalization take root, itwill be increasingly difficult for Africa to remain competitive if its infrastructure systems continue to besub-standard. This paper is intended to provide policy options and practical proposals on measures toimprove the performance of Africa’s infrastructure. In discussing trade and investment the paper pointsto Africa’s historical trade patterns as a limiting factor to its infrastructure development. For the mostpart these have been outward looking, rather than inward looking rooted in the pattern of colonialexploitation, homogeneity of production and trading of primary commodities as well as high exportconcentration on one or a few products for the bulk of their export earnings. There is therefore, anurgent need to put Africa’s infrastructure in shape as well as the need for value added to stimulateinfrastructure development given the increased phenomenon of intra-industry trade which is viewed asenhancing regional integration and that of individual countries into the global economy. The paper proposesstrategies and policies for linking Africa through infrastructure and promoting private sector participationkey among which are a single integrated African market and the steps toward infrastructure integration. The conclusion of the paper is that, Africa needs a deliberate, systematic and concerted effort at thepractical level to integrate, upgrade and modernize regional infrastructure so that it becomes the catalystfor Africa’s growth. The regionally integrated <b>corridor</b> <b>approach</b> offers prospects for speedier integrationof infrastructure systems in Africa. The vision and ultimate objective for Africa should be to create asingle market of 750 million people that is competitive within itself and within the global economy. Acritical pre-requisite to this is regional infrastructure integration across Africa. The private sector alonecannot address all the requirements of Africa’s regional infrastructure needs even if all the conditionswere in place. The way forward is to put in place a goal oriented, results driven, continent-wideframework for addressing Africa’s regional infrastructure needs on an integrated basis. This shouldhave a practical approach to evolving an integrated, coordinated and efficient African regionalinfrastructure system that is supportive and facilitative of the ultimate goal of creating a vibrant singleAfrican market. The single major proposal and recommendation of this report is the creation of aFramework for African Regional Infrastructure Cooperation (FARIC). FARIC would not be an institutionor a body but a coordinated consultative mechanism to drive the process of linking and improving theefficiency of Africa’s infrastructure systems across Africa’s major regions. The aim should be as far aspossible, to harmonize policies and legal frameworks supporting regional infrastructure development,integration and operation across Africa as well as to ensure that regions learn from each other and sharebest practices. ...|$|E

40|$|Recently, {{increasing}} environmental {{threats to}} the functioning of landscape and biodiversity have heightened the need for developing new approaches to nature conservation. Green and ecological networks have been developed {{as an attempt to}} maintain the functioning of landscapes, promote the sustainable use and conservation of nature, support the movement of species and increase people's use and enjoyment of the nature (Bennett and Wit, 2001; Bennett and Mulongoy, 2006; Lawton et al., 2010). These can be achieved by the identification and selection of the main features of ecological and green networks based on ecological and / or social functions we intend them to fulfil as well as the determination of objective conservation measures. The main purpose of this research is to focus on critically examining different ways of defining green and ecological networks and their functionality for biodiversity and people in the case of Sheffield, which were derived from different theoretical and professional perspectives (planning and ecology), and to explore the potential for different approaches to define ecological / green networks. Due to its multidisciplinary nature, this thesis uses a mixed research methodology, based on different methods of data collection and analysis. This research commences with the analysis of existing green and ecological network approaches, namely the Green Network (Sheffield City Council) and the Living Don (Sheffield and Rotherham Wildlife Trust). In order to analyse these approaches, policy document analysis, semi-structured interviews and ArcGIS spatial analyses were conducted to understand the rationale, aims and the spatial structure of current networks in the case of Sheffield. For the identification of criteria to develop alternative routes of connectivity, ArcGIS and FRAGSTATS were used. After generating land cover and land use maps at a very fine scale (2 m raster resolution) and with different levels of detail, the alternative connectivity routes, for both biodiversity and people, were identified on the basis of two connectivity measures. The first set of spatial analyses took into account structural connectivity of landscape components as the main criteria, to develop potential routes using ArcGIS and FRAGSTATS in combination. On the other hand, based on functional connectivity, the second set of alternative connectivity routes were developed using a least-cost <b>corridor</b> <b>approach</b> in ArcGIS. For the delineation of alternative connectivity routes for biodiversity, 10 species were selected from 3 different taxon groups (birds, mammals and reptiles); and for people, the alternative routes from residential buildings to (a) green and open spaces, (b) public buildings and (c) industrial / commercial units were used considering the effects of physical / legal accessibility and slope. Then, existing approaches and derived alternative routes of connectivity were compared and contrasted to each other in ArcGIS, to analyse the relationship between their structural properties and the urban morphologies in which they occur, with a view to predicting the implications for ecological connectivity and use by members of the public. The Sheffield City Council and the Sheffield and Rotherham Wildlife Trust aim at maintaining and enhancing ecological connectivity for the benefit of wildlife as well as supporting public enjoyment and movement, and both of their network approaches benefit from the linear connectivity formed around the main rivers, streams and valleys. However, it was found that there are significant differences in the representation, spatial coverage and arrangement of the Green Network and the Living Don based on the methods and the site selection criteria used for developing green and ecological networks. Regarding the structural connectivity routes for biodiversity and people, significant differences were found in the spatial extent and arrangement of alternative routes. On the other hand, functional connectivity routes for biodiversity showed both similarities and differences in their spatial extents and arrangements according to selected species' habitat requirements and movement behaviours across the landscape. Similarly, functional connectivity routes for people changed as I used different destinations and parameters. The overall results of this research provide further support for the conceptual premise that the definition of green and ecological networks is highly dependent on the methodology, ecological and / or social functions that are considered, and also criteria for the inclusion of different habitats or land uses within the network. ...|$|E

The gateway was protected by a ditch behind it, although this was later filled in. Unusually, a number of horse burials were found within the entrance. The gateway appears to have been set back within an <b>approaching</b> <b>corridor</b> between the rampart. During the second phase of the fort, excavated postholes demonstrate that it possessed a double gate.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{protocol}} that controls semi-automated autonomous vehicles driving on a multiple merge junction highway. The protocol is distributed and controls both the merging (the vehicle is in the merge lane) and the yielding (the vehicle is in the main lane). We show a simulation study that presents the protocol and what impacts it has on safety and congestion under different conditions. 1 Introduction Passenger safety and traffic congestion are growing problems in several urban <b>corridors.</b> Two <b>approaches</b> {{can be used to}} alleviate these problems: construction of more lanes on congested highways or use of emerging technologies for more automated traffic control. The first approach, constructing more lanes or highways, is rapidly becoming untenable because of lack of right of ways, complexity of highway design and layout, costs and environmental considerations. Hence several metropolitan transportation agencies are turning towards higher levels of automation technologies [...] ...|$|R
