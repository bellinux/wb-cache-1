25|$|The total {{population}} of individual clones obtained in a molecular cloning experiment is often termed a DNA library. Libraries may be highly complex (as when cloning complete genomic DNA from an organism) or relatively simple (as when moving a previously <b>cloned</b> <b>DNA</b> fragment into a different plasmid), but it is almost always necessary to examine {{a number of different}} clones {{to be sure that the}} desired DNA construct is obtained. This may be accomplished through a very wide range of experimental methods, including the use of nucleic acid hybridizations, antibody probes, polymerase chain reaction, restriction fragment analysis and/or DNA sequencing.|$|E
40|$|Geminiviruses {{are small}} plant viruses that encapsidate a {{single-stranded}} circular DNA and form double-stranded DNAs in infected plants. Infection of economically important hosts with <b>cloned</b> <b>DNAs</b> of geminiviruses frequently has been difficult. Four isolates of bipartite bean-infecting geminiviruses (bean golden mosaic geminivirus isolates from Brazil [BGMV-BZ], Guatemala [BGMV-GA], and the Dominican Republic [BGMV-DR]; and bean dwarf mosaic geminivirus from Colombia [BDMV-CO]) were cloned; full-length <b>cloned</b> double-stranded <b>DNA</b> components A and B of each isolate were not infectious when mechanically coinoculated onto bean primary leaves by surface abrasion but were infectious when coinoculated into radicles of beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) by electric discharge particle acceleration. This novel method for {{the introduction of}} <b>cloned</b> geminiviral <b>DNA</b> into plants was extremely efficient and resulted in symptom expression in as few as 7 days. Moreover, infection of beans by <b>cloned</b> <b>DNAs</b> of BGMV-BZ, which has never been mechanically transmitted as virions or <b>cloned</b> <b>DNAs,</b> indicated that this procedure circumvents plant barriers to mechanical transmission. Three engineered mutants of BGMV-GA component A were constructed and separately introduced into beans with wild-type BGMV-GA component B, and disease phenotypes determined. Soybeans (Glycine max) also were infected with <b>cloned</b> <b>DNAs</b> of BGMV-BZ, BGMV-GA, and BDMV-CO, demonstrating a potentially important alternate host for these viruses. Particle acceleration will facilitate genetic analysis of bean-infecting geminiviruses and may allow for the efficient introduction of viral nucleic acids or virions of other viruses into hosts that are refractory to mechanical transmission.

50|$|Many {{general purpose}} vectors such as pUC19 usually include {{a system for}} {{detecting}} {{the presence of a}} <b>cloned</b> <b>DNA</b> fragment, based on the loss of an easily scored phenotype. The most widely used is the gene coding for E. coli β-galactosidase, whose activity can easily be detected by the ability of the enzyme it encodes to hydrolyze the soluble, colourless substrate X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-beta-d-galactoside) into an insoluble, blue product (5,5'-dibromo-4,4'-dichloro indigo). Cloning a fragment of DNA within the vector-based lacZα sequence of the β-galactosidase prevents the production of an active enzyme. If X-gal is included in the selective agar plates, transformant colonies are generally blue {{in the case of a}} vector with no inserted DNA and white in the case of a vector containing a fragment of <b>cloned</b> <b>DNA.</b>|$|E
40|$|A defined {{synthetic}} medium {{was used to}} determine the amino acid requirements of Enterococcus faecalis OG 1 and to demonstrate the absence of a requirement for exogenous purines or pyrimidines. Genomic libraries prepared from strain OG 1 were transduced into Escherichia coli auxotrophic mutants, and <b>cloned</b> <b>DNAs</b> which complemented pyrC, pyrD, purF, purL, and guaAB mutations were identified. These and other <b>cloned</b> <b>DNAs</b> with known functions were localized on a restriction map of OG 1 which was generated with SfiI (5 fragments), AscI (9 fragments), and NotI (15 fragments); the size of the OG 1 chromosome was revised from a previous estimate of approximately 2, 750 kb to 2, 825 kb.

50|$|With the {{introduction}} of array CGH, the main limitation of conventional CGH, a low resolution, is overcome. In array CGH, the metaphase chromosomes are replaced by <b>cloned</b> <b>DNA</b> fragments (+100-200 kb) of which the exact chromosomal location is known.

40|$|Infective clones of the Nigerian isolate of cassava latent virus (CLV) {{have been}} obtained. The {{apparent}} molecular {{weight of the}} capsid protein of this isolate is slightly higher than that produced in plants infected with <b>cloned</b> <b>DNAs</b> of the Kenyan isolate of CLV. Pseudorecombinant experiments using heterologous combinations of <b>cloned</b> <b>DNAs</b> have confirmed that the physical properties of the capsid protein are encoded on DNA 1 and at least some determinants of symptom induction are also located on this DNA. Comparison between the nucleotide sequences of the open reading frames encoding the two capsid proteins hows several nucleotide differences which affect he amino acid composition but which do not significantly alter the potential molecular weight of the product. In vitro translation of poly(A) ÷ RNAs shows that the differences in electrophoretic mobility are not {{due to differences in}} host-directed post-translational processing...|$|R

40|$|From the Charon 4 A {{library of}} Ferrari et al (J. Bacteriol. 146 : 430 - 432, 1981) we {{isolated}} three genes involved in Bacillus subtilis spore outgrowth by screening the library by hybridization with labeled RNA from outgrowing spores {{in the presence}} of an excess of unlabeled vegetative RNA. Hybridization competition experiments with purified clones showed that the clones contained sequences that were transcribed only during spore outgrowth or preferentially during spore outgrowth. Fragments of the <b>cloned</b> <b>DNAs</b> were subcloned in plasmid pJH 101, and by using plasmid integration and PBS 1 transduction the chromosomal loci were mapped. The three loci which we mapped are outG and outH, which are located between polC and dnaA, and outI, which is located near pycA. Using the <b>cloned</b> <b>DNAs</b> and derived plasmids in dot hybridization experiments with RNA extracted from cells at different developmental stages, we defined for two clones a region that is transcribed only during the outgrowth phase...|$|R
40|$|We {{explored}} {{the combination of}} metagenomic library and DNA microarray technologies into a single platform as a novel way to rapidly screen metagenomic libraries for genetic targets. In the "metagenomic microarray" system, metagenomic library <b>clone</b> <b>DNA</b> is printed on a microarray surface, and clones of interest are detected by hybridization to single-gene probes. This study represents the initial steps {{in the development of}} this technology. We constructed two 5, 000 -clone large-insert metagenomic libraries from two diesel-contaminated Arctic soil samples. We developed and optimized an automated fosmid purification protocol to rapidly-extract <b>clone</b> <b>DNA</b> in a high-throughput 96 -well format. We then created a series of small prototype arrays to optimize various parameters of microarray printing and hybridization, to identify and resolve technical challenges, and to provide proof-of-principle of this novel application. Our results suggest that this method shows promise, but more experimentation must be done to establish the feasibility of this approach...|$|R

50|$|A Riboprobe, {{abbreviation}} of RNA probe, is {{a segment}} of labelled RNA {{that can be used}} to detect a target mRNA or DNA during in situ hybridization.

Some bacterial viruses code for their own RNA polymerases, which are highly specific for the viral promoters.

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{efficacy}} of T cell vaccination with CD 4 +αβTh 1 clones in lupus-prone MRL/Mp-Faslpr/lpr (MRL/lpr) mice. CD 4 +αβ Th 1 <b>clones,</b> <b>dna</b> 51 (Vβ 8. 3) and rnp 2 (Vβ 14), which stimulated anti-dsDNA or U 1 ribonucleoprotein (U 1 RNP) antibody (Ab) production respectively, were isolated from splenocytes of MRL/lpr mice. Antinuclear Ab kinetics, renal function, renal histology, survival rate, and lymphocyte subpopulations in the spleen were monitored after intravenous adoptive transfer of IL- 2 -stimulated (s-) or irradiated (i-) clones to 3 week-old female MRL/lpr mice. Anti-idiotypic humoral and T cell responses against the transferred autoreactive Th 1 clones were determined in parallel. Compared with PBS-treated MRL/lpr mice, anti-dsDNA Ab titers, and the activity index for lupus nephritis were all decreased in MRL/lpr mice vaccinated with i-dna 51 cells, whereas survival rate was not improved. The numbers of CD 4 +Vβ 8. 3 T cells in the spleen were also significantly decreased in these mice. Anti-idiotypic Abs recognizing a 12 amino acid sequence of <b>clone</b> <b>dna</b> 51 T cell receptor Vβ 8. 3 -complementarity-determining region (CDR) 3 were detected in the MRL/lpr mice that received i-dna 51 or s-dna 51 cells. These Abs suppressed dna 51 cell proliferation, as well as cytotoxicity of CD 8 +T cells against dna 51. The present study suggests that vaccination with CD 4 +αβTh 1 <b>clone,</b> <b>dna</b> 51, elicits anti-idiotypic T cell and humoral responses against dna 51 in MRL/lpr mice, although the immunoregulatory effects on lupus may be limited...|$|R

50|$|Exon trapped {{sequence}} {{is used to}} identify genes in <b>cloned</b> <b>DNA,</b> and this is achieved by recognizing and trapping carrier containing exon sequence of DNA. Exon trapping has two main features: First, it is independent of availability of the RNA expressing target DNA. Second, isolated sequences can be derived directly from clone without knowing tissues expressing the gene which needs to be identified. During slicing, exon can be remained in mRNA and information carried by exon can be contained in the protein. Since fragment of DNA can be inserted into sequences, if an exon is inserted into intron, the transcript will be longer than usual and this transcript can be trapped by analysis.|$|E

With the E. coli cloning vector pHSG 298, transformation frequencies of up to 2 × 107 transformants/μg DNA were achieved. This frequency is comparable to that obtained for CaCl 2 -mediated transformation of E. coli; thus, direct <b>cloning</b> of <b>DNA</b> into P. stutzeri is feasible.
