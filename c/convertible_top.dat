25|$|The overall {{appearance}} was a sleek look with {{no trace of}} a <b>convertible</b> <b>top</b> at all. No cover boot was needed.|$|E
25|$|Unlike hardtop {{models that}} {{utilized}} a conventional key-secured, forward hinged design, the convertibles combined the trunk {{opening and closing}} within the <b>convertible</b> <b>top</b> operating system. As {{a result of this}} design, the trunks of convertible models were notorious for leaking.|$|E
50|$|OASys (Open Air Systems) is a 100% {{subsidiary}} of Webasto and produces <b>convertible</b> <b>tops</b> and roof modules.|$|R
50|$|Autoettes were {{available}} {{with a broad}} range of accessories, usually installed by the dealer as upgrades. These included windscreens, doors, <b>convertible</b> <b>tops,</b> side curtains, and more.|$|R
50|$|Folding textile <b>convertible</b> <b>tops</b> {{often fail}} to {{completely}} hide their internal mechanism or can expose their vulnerable underside to sun exposure and fading. A tonneau cover provides a solution.|$|R
25|$|However, {{this design}} could present a {{challenge}} to one who is troubleshooting a <b>convertible</b> <b>top</b> malfunction. The system consists of a spiderweb of solenoids, relays, limit switches, electric motors, a hydraulic pump/reservoir, hydraulic directional valves and cylinders. While the hydraulics are not often a cause for trouble, the electrical relays are known to fail. Failure {{of any of the}} relays, motors or limit switches will prevent the convertible system from completing the cycle.|$|E
25|$|In 1957, the KR200 Kabrio {{model was}} released, {{featuring}} a cloth <b>convertible</b> <b>top</b> and fixed side window frames. This {{was followed by}} the KR201 Roadster without window frames, using a folding cloth top, a windscreen, and removable side curtains. A Sport Roadster was later offered with no top and with the canopy fixed into place so that the driver would have to climb in and out {{at the top of the}} car.|$|E
25|$|A mission {{modified}} Cessna 172 Skyhawk {{with a crew}} of two set {{the world}} record for the longest continuous manned flight without landing of 64 days, 22 hours, 19 minutes, and five seconds in 1958 by refueling and transferring food and supplies from a <b>convertible</b> <b>top</b> Ford Thunderbird automobile. The publicity flight for a Las Vegas area hotel ended when the aircraft's performance had degraded {{to the point where}} the Cessna had difficulty climbing away from the refueling car.|$|E
50|$|Early {{convertibles}} used canvas. Automakers {{had problems}} in securing raw materials to fulfill orders after World War II, including canvas in various shades for <b>convertible</b> <b>tops</b> and limiting their manufacture.|$|R
50|$|The power {{retractable}} convertible hardtop {{was developed}} and built by ASC, which made <b>convertible</b> <b>tops</b> for Chrysler (until the 2007 Sebring) and was also responsible {{for much of the}} design of the Chevy SSR.|$|R
5000|$|CTS Fahrzeug-Dachsysteme ("CTS Car Top Systems" [...] in Germany) is a {{supplier}} of <b>convertible</b> <b>tops.</b> Long {{a subsidiary of}} Porsche AG, that company agreed {{to sell it to}} Magna International in late 2005 for roughly $470,000,000.|$|R
500|$|In 1988, the Alumni Association {{purchased}} a 1931 Ford Model A Roadster and restored the vehicle again in 1994. The Alumni Wreck is distinguished by its spare tire locations on the driver's side and passenger's side runningboards {{and the words}} [...] "Georgia Tech Alumni Association" [...] printed on the doors. It also has a <b>convertible</b> <b>top.</b> On the real Wreck, the spare is behind the rumble seat and the roof cannot be removed or lowered.|$|E

2500|$|Hydraulic {{valve lifters}} {{were used in}} the base 250hp and {{optional}} [...] engines, solid lifters in the optional carbureted 340hp and fuel-injected [...] versions. Rocker panel trim was seen for the first time, exposed headlights for the last, until 2005. This was the last Corvette model to offer an optional power <b>convertible</b> <b>top</b> mechanism. Rare options: RPO 488 24-gallon fuel tank (65), RPO 687 heavy-duty brakes and steering (246), RPO 473 power <b>convertible</b> <b>top</b> (350), RPO 276 15"×5.5" [...] wheels (561).|$|E
50|$|Polyvinyl {{chloride}} (PVC) {{material was}} used for many <b>convertible</b> <b>tops.</b> The material consists of two layers: a top layer made of PVC, which has a specific structure depending on the vehicle model, and a lower layer made of fabric (usually cotton).|$|R

5000|$|ASC {{invented the}} glass-panel [...] "moonroof". In the industry, ASC became {{well known for}} {{converting}} standard coupe automobiles into convertibles on an OEM basis. The company also engineers <b>convertible</b> <b>tops</b> for automakers to build themselves. Other original-equipment firsts for ASC include the mobile video system (on the Chevrolet Venture) and the powered sunroof.|$|R
2500|$|The Series 1 was {{produced}} in both supercharged and normally aspirated versions. Supercharged cars were also outfitted by the factory with larger brakes and a heavy duty clutch. Performance is near [...] "supercar" [...] category with a 0 to 60 mph time at 4.1 seconds for the supercharged version. [...] Nicely optioned, Series 1 had power steering, power disc brakes, factory air conditioning, power windows, and an AM/FM/CD audio system. The <b>convertible</b> <b>top</b> folded away {{out of sight in}} a compartment located behind the cockpit. Some component cars were sold as roadsters, with no <b>convertible</b> <b>top.</b>|$|E
2500|$|For the 1959 model, {{engines and}} {{horsepower}} ratings did not change. Interiors were revised slightly with different instrument graphics {{and the addition}} of a storage bin to the passenger side. A positive reverse lockout shifter with [...] "T" [...] handle was standard with 4-speed manual transmission. This was the only year a turquoise <b>convertible</b> <b>top</b> color could be ordered, and all 24-gallon fuel tank models through 1962 could not be ordered with convertible tops due to inadequate space for the folding top mechanism. Rare options: RPO 684 heavy-duty brakes and suspension (142), RPO 686 metallic brakes (333), RPO 276 15"×5.5" [...] wheels (214), RPO 426 power windows (547), RPO 473 power <b>convertible</b> <b>top</b> (661).|$|E
2500|$|During the 1967 model year, American Motors {{produced}} {{a total of}} 1,686 Rambler Rebel convertibles; all in the top-trim SST model. Automatic power operation of top was standard. The new <b>convertible</b> <b>top</b> design featured a [...] "streamlined" [...] look blending smoothly with the lower body with the top up. Its new [...] "split stack" [...] folding mechanism also allowed a lower stack height with the top folded down, {{as well as for}} a full-width backseat with room for three passengers.|$|E
50|$|The {{interior}} is finished in leather with Mulliner's signature diamond quilting. The <b>convertible</b> <b>top's</b> tonneau cover {{is covered with}} largest wood veneer ever applied to a Bentley, in book matched Burr Walnut wood. The tonneau was finished entirely by hand with the wood's mirror finish being accented by strips of chromed steel.|$|R
5000|$|In {{passenger}} cars, {{the most}} common use of hydraulic power has been the steering system. <b>Convertible</b> <b>tops</b> may be raised and lowered using hydraulics. Windshield wipers were sometimes hydraulically driven, although this use mostly ceased after the late 1960s. On vehicles {{with little or no}} engine vacuum, hydraulic systems are generally adopted in place of vacuum systems.|$|R

2500|$|Gagarin also {{garnered}} {{a reputation}} as an adept public figure. When he visited Manchester in the United Kingdom, it was pouring rain. However, Gagarin insisted that the <b>convertible</b> <b>top</b> remain down so that the cheering crowds could {{catch a glimpse of}} him. Gagarin stated, [...] "If all these people have turned out to welcome me and can stand in the rain, so can I." [...] Gagarin refused an umbrella and remained standing in his open-top Bentley so that the cheering crowds could still see him.|$|E
2500|$|For 1963, model designations {{were changed}} {{once again with}} the 400 now called 440. A new hardtop (no B-pillar) coupe body design debuted, whose steel roof was {{designed}} to mimic {{the appearance of a}} closed <b>convertible</b> <b>top.</b> This was a one-model-year-only design with a thin profile, clean lines, stamped faux-convertible ribs, and a textured finish. A special top-of-the-line model called the 440-H was equipped with sports-type features including individually adjustable reclining front bucket seats and a center console, as well as a more powerful [...] version of Rambler's stalwart [...] inline-6 engine.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike {{almost all}} {{traditional}} convertibles {{of the era}} that used frame-free side windows, the Rambler retained the fixed profile including the car's doors and rear-side window frames. This metal structure served as the side guides or rails for the retractable waterproof canvas top. This design allowed Nash to utilize its unibody construction on its new compact. It made the body very rigid for an open-top car, without additional bracing. The <b>convertible</b> <b>top</b> was cable-driven and electrically operated. The design is similar to other fixed-profile convertibles including the 1936 Fiat 500 [...] "Topolino", Nissan Figaro (1991), Citroën 2CV (1948–1990) and the 1957 Fiat 500 (1957) {{as well as its}} 2007 Fiat 500 successor.|$|E
5000|$|Tonneau covers are {{available}} for open sports cars such as the Porsche Boxster, MGA, Triumph, and Austin-Healey. These covers, made of leather or vinyl, cover the entire passenger compartment, and are zippered so the driver's seat can be uncovered {{while the rest of}} the interior remaines covered. [...] Tonneau covers may be used in lieu of hard or soft <b>convertible</b> <b>tops.</b>|$|R

50|$|The Competition package costs $4,750 for the M3/M4 and $4,250 for the M4 <b>convertible</b> on <b>top</b> of {{its base}} price.|$|R
2500|$|Four {{taillights}} {{appeared on}} the 1961, a treatment that continues to this day. Engine displacement remained at 283 cubic inches, but power output increased for the two fuel-injected engines to [...] Power ratings for the dual-four barrel engines did not change (245hp and 270hp) {{but this was the}} last year of their availability. This was the last year for contrasting paint colors in cove areas, and the last two-tone Corvette of any type until 1978. Also debuting in 1961 was a new boat-tail design later used on the C2. Rare options: RPO 353 275hp engine (118), RPO 687 heavy-duty brakes and steering (233), RPO 276 15"×5.5" [...] wheels (357), RPO 473 power <b>convertible</b> <b>top</b> (442).|$|E
2500|$|A {{new body}} was {{introduced}} for the 1956 model featuring a new [...] "face" [...] and side coves; the taillamp fins were also gone. An optional {{fuel injection system}} was made available {{in the middle of}} the 1957 model year. It was one of the first mass-produced engines in history to reach [...] per cubic inch (16.4 cubic cm) and Chevrolet's advertising agency used a [...] "one hp per cubic inch" [...] slogan for advertising the [...] Small-Block engine. Other options included power windows (1956), hydraulically operated power <b>convertible</b> <b>top</b> (1956), heavy duty brakes and suspension (1957), and four speed manual transmission (late 1957). Delco Radio transistorized signal-seeking [...] "hybrid" [...] car radio, which used both vacuum tubes and transistors in its radio's circuitry (1956 option).|$|E
2500|$|There was {{no doubt}} Chevrolet was in the sports car {{business}} {{with the release of}} the 1956 model. It featured a new body, a much better <b>convertible</b> <b>top</b> with power assist optional, real glass roll up windows (also with optional power assist), and an optional hardtop. The 3-speed manual transmission was standard. The Powerglide automatic was optional. The six-cylinder engine was gone. The V8 remained at 265 cubic inches but power ranged from [...] The volume was 3,467, a low number by any contemporary standard and still less than 1954s 3,640, meaning this was the third lowest-volume model in Corvette history. Delco Radio transistorized signal-seeking (hybrid) car radio, which used both vacuum tubes and transistors in its radio's circuitry (1956 option).|$|E
5000|$|As {{with the}} Modena version, its 3.6 litre V8 with [...] {{is on display}} under a glass hood. The engine — {{confined}} in space by the <b>convertible's</b> <b>top's</b> storage area — acquires additional air supply through especially large side grills. The intake manifolds were moved {{toward the center of}} the engine between the air supply conduits in the Spider engine compartment, as opposed to lying apart as with the Modena. In terms of performance, the 0-60 mph time was slightly slower due to the slight weight increase, and the top speed was reduced.|$|R
50|$|The M30 {{convertible}} was {{the sole}} convertible of the Infiniti line, until the G37 convertible's introduction in 2009. Infiniti used M30 models from 1991 to 1992 and converted them to soft-top convertibles through ASC (American Sunroof Corporation). <b>Convertible</b> <b>tops</b> were fully automatic, requiring the driver only to push the up or down buttons {{to the left of}} the steering wheel (which replaced the rear defogger button found in the coupe) to raise or lower the top. There is no definitive number of coupes that were converted into convertibles.|$|R
5000|$|The {{specification}} {{included a}} detachable hard <b>top</b> and <b>convertible</b> soft <b>top,</b> electronic instruments, air conditioning, an automatic fire extinguisher, electric seats and windows, a telephone and a television set.|$|R
