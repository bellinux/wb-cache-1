Evidence for {{secondary}} circulation associ-ated with a shelfbreak front is {{obtained from a}} high-resolution, cross-shelf section of hydrographic, optical and velocity fields. <b>Convergence</b> <b>in</b> the bottom bound-ary layer on the inshore side of the front and subsequent upwelling into the interior is evident by a mid-water re-gion of suspended bottom material emanating from {{the foot of the}} front and extending to within 35 m of the surface, 80 m above bottom.

30|$|The MLE {{approach}} and its theoretical {{performance of the}} MLE were covered in Section 3.2, and the estimator performance on the parameter <b>convergence</b> was discussed <b>in</b> Section 5.2. However, to be complete, we have to mention that MLE method has potentially serious limitations and constraints <b>in</b> terms of <b>convergence</b> <b>in</b> <b>measured</b> respiratory signal processing. As seen from Figure 8 (b) and Figure 9 (b), for the nonlinear RC model we have considerable convergence difficulties on nonlinearly related parameters. Moreover, {{it is observed that}} MLE required longer computation time for the nonlinear RC model than for the linear RIC model. Performance degradation on MLE can easily be attributed to the nonlinear, non-Gaussian state-space models. The major estimation problem central to gradient-based approaches, such as MLE, is essentially dealing with the initialization. However, as it is covered earlier, confounds between the parameter estimates, including the intraindividual differences, demonstrated the ability of the MLE with the non-Gaussian noise as a diagnostic tool for the COPD patients. Thus, we see these methodological difficulties {{not so much as a}} hurdle but more as an even stronger incentive for the biomedical scientists to include intensive repeated researches in nonlinear and non-Gaussian models.|$|R
40|$|Chay, Guryan and Mazumder (2009) found {{substantial}} racial <b>convergence</b> <b>in</b> AFQT and NAEP scores across cohorts {{born in the}} 1960 's {{and early}} 1970 's that was concentrated among blacks in the South. We demonstrated a close tracking between variation in the test score convergence across states and racial <b>convergence</b> <b>in</b> <b>measures</b> of health and hospital access {{in the years immediately}} after birth. This study analyzes whether the across-cohort patterns in the black-white education and earnings gaps match those in early life health and test scores already established. It also addresses caveats in the earlier study, such as unobserved selection into taking the AFQT and potential discrepancies between state-of-birth and state-of-test taking. With Census data, we find: i) a significant narrowing across the same cohorts in education gaps driven primarily by a relative increase in the probability of blacks going to college; and ii) a similar <b>convergence</b> <b>in</b> relative earnings that is insensitive to adjustments for employment selection, as well as time and age effects that vary by race and state-of-residence. The variation <b>in</b> racial <b>convergence</b> across birth states matches the patterns in the earlier study. The magnitude of the earnings gains is greater than can be explained by only the black gains in education and test scores for reasonable estimates of the returns to human capital. This suggests that other pre-market, productivity factors also improved across successive cohorts of blacks born in the South between the early 1960 's and early 1970 's. Finally, our cohort-based hypothesis provides a cohesive explanation for the aggregate patterns in several, previously disconnected literatures...|$|R
40|$|One {{literature}} documents a significant, black-white gap {{in average}} test scores, while another finds a substantial narrowing {{of the gap}} during the 1980 's, and stagnation <b>in</b> <b>convergence</b> after. We use two data sources - the Long Term Trends NAEP and AFQT scores for the universe of applicants to the U. S. military between 1976 and 1991 - to show: 1) the 1980 's convergence is due to relative improvements across successive cohorts of blacks born between 1963 and the early 1970 's and not a secular narrowing in the gap over time; and 2) the across-cohort gains were concentrated among blacks in the South. We then demonstrate that the timing and variation across states <b>in</b> the AFQT <b>convergence</b> closely tracks racial <b>convergence</b> <b>in</b> <b>measures</b> of health and hospital access {{in the years immediately}} following birth. We show that the AFQT convergence is highly correlated with post-neonatal mortality rates and not with neonatal mortality and low birth weight rates, and that this result cannot be explained by schooling desegregation and changes in family background. We conclude that investments in health through increased access at very early ages have large, long-term effects on achievement, and that the integration of hospitals during the 1960 's affected the test performance of black teenagers in the 1980 's...|$|R

40|$|Background. The LOTCA (Loewenstein Occupational Therapy Cognitive Assessment) {{battery is}} a {{cognitive}} screening test which {{is widely used}} in occupational health. However, no work {{has been found that}} explores its use in addiction treatment. Objectives of Study. To explore the convergent validity of LOTCA with neuropsychological tests that assess related cerebral functional areas. Methods. The LOTCA, along with a battery of neuropsychological tests, was administered to a sample of 48 subjects who start a treatment by substance or gambling addictions. Findings. A correlational pattern was observed of a considerable magnitude between the effects of the LOTCA scales and those of some neuropsychological tests, but not with others. There is barely any <b>convergence</b> <b>in</b> <b>measures</b> with memory and executive function tests. Relevance to Clinical Practice. There is a lack of research applying test of occupational assessment to populations of patients treated by addictive behaviors. The LOTCA seems to be a reliable and valid test for preliminary screening of function in certain cognitive areas, easy, and quick to use (around 30 minutes). However, it must be supplemented with other tests for a full and ecological assessment of patients. Limitations. An incident, small-size sample. Recommendations for Further Research. New studies are needed to explore the applicability, diagnostic validity, and whole psychometric quality of the test in addiction-related treatment...|$|R

30|$|In {{this paper}} we develop new {{arguments}} to deduce whether a dual Banach space satisfies the weak∗-FPP for left reversible semigroups. More generally, {{we will consider}} τ as any translation invariant topology on a separable Banach space X and we give sufficient conditions to assure the τ-FPP for left reversible semigroups. The strict Opial condition and the generalized Gossez-Lami Dozo property will be our main tools. Most of the previous known results will be deduced from ours, but we will also achieve new examples of Banach spaces which satisfy the τ-FPP for left reversible semigroups. Here we will consider different types of topologies. Firstly we will regard the weak∗ topology in Musielak-Orlicz sequence spaces, in some renormings of ℓ_ 1 and in some other dual Banach spaces non-isomorphic to ℓ_ 1. We will also consider the topology of the <b>convergence</b> locally <b>in</b> <b>measure</b> <b>in</b> some function spaces, the abstract <b>measure</b> topology <b>in</b> L-embedded Banach spaces and the topology of ρ-almost everywhere <b>convergence</b> <b>in</b> modular function spaces.|$|R
30|$|As a {{particular}} case we can deduce Theorem  5.1 in [7] when the Hilbert space H is separable. Indeed, in case that the L-embedded Banach space is L^ 1 (M,τ) for some finite von Neumann algebra M defined over a Hilbert space, the previous measure topology coincides with the usual measure topology defined on L^ 1 (M,τ) for bounded sets (see Theorem  1.1 in [31]). Hence, noncommutative L_ 1 -spaces verify the fixed point property for left reversible semigroups {{with respect to the}} usual measure topology. This topology is <b>in</b> fact the <b>convergence</b> locally <b>in</b> <b>measure</b> topology <b>in</b> case that L^ 1 (M,τ)=L^ 1 (μ) for some σ-finite measure space.|$|R
