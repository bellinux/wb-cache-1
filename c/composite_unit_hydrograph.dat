More over most of the stations are ungauged, due to which it becomes difficult to develop the <b>unit</b> <b>hydrograph.</b> So in order to overcome these problems, two methods have been considered in this study {{for the development of}} the <b>unit</b> <b>hydrograph</b> for Bharathapuzha river basin. They are the “two parameter Gamma distribution” and “three parameter Beta distribution”, both of which are based on Probability Distribution Functions (pdfs).

40|$|A {{method to}} convert a known <b>unit</b> <b>hydrograph</b> to <b>unit</b> <b>hydrographs</b> of {{different}} durations, {{as an alternative}} to the S-Hydrograph method, is introduced. The method-called the Complementary Hydrograph method-involves a process of decomposing a known <b>unit</b> <b>hydrograph</b> of duration t o into a pair of "complementary" hydrographs associated with two sequential rainfalls with the sum of their durations equal to t o. In converting the t o-hour <b>unit</b> <b>hydrograph</b> into a t a-hour <b>unit</b> <b>hydrograph,</b> the method produces a <b>unit</b> <b>hydrograph</b> of duration t b=(t o-t a) concurrently. In hydrograph conversion, the Complementary Hydrograph method produces an identical result to the well-established S-Hydrograph method and involves a comparable number of computational steps. In certain special cases, such as converting a <b>unit</b> <b>hydrograph</b> into one with half its duration, the new method requires fewer computational steps. While the two methods employ different approaches in their solutions of hydrograph conversion problems, the agreement in their results stems from the fact that both methods are founded on the same principles of superposition and linearity of the <b>unit</b> <b>hydrograph</b> method. The S-Hydrograph method can also be viewed as a special case of the Complementary Hydrograph method in which the known hydrograph is associated with a storm of infinite duration and uniform intensity. The Complementary Hydrograph method offers a more unified and versatile approach in dealing with various types of unit-hydrograph conversion problems. For example, the method can be extended to derive <b>unit</b> <b>hydrographs</b> from a hydrograph associated with a multiperiod, varied intensity rainfall. The use of S-Hydrograph method for hydrograph derivation can only be applied to hydrographs resulting from a single-period rainfall of uniform intensity. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

A simple distributed linear catchment model is used to simulate the response of a catchment to stationary and moving storms and three different <b>unit</b> <b>hydrograph</b> derivation techniques have been applied to the responses obtained.

To forecast the flows in a large drainage basin using the <b>unit</b> <b>hydrograph</b> method would be difficult because in a large basin geographic conditions may vary significantly from one part of the basin to another. This is especially so with the distribution of rainfall because an individual rainstorm rarely covers the basin evenly.

The results of the study revealed that the Clark’s instantaneous <b>unit</b> <b>hydrograph</b> obtained from graphical method for estimation of storage coefficient with estimation error of less than 33. 33 % and efficiency coefficient of 83 % could suitably simulate different components of the observed average <b>unit</b> <b>hydrograph</b> for the study watershed...|$|R

40|$|Southern New Jersey {{is part of}} the Atlantic Coastal Plain, with {{generally}} flat topography {{and sandy}} soils. Hydrologic estimation techniques employed by state regulatory agencies typically rely on NRCS methods such as TR- 55 and TR- 20 with pre-defined runoff hydrographs. While these techniques work reasonably well in the steeper Piedmont regions of northern New Jersey, they typically over-predict runoff quantities in southern New Jersey by an order of magnitude. Several alternative <b>unit</b> <b>hydrographs</b> have been proposed for coastal plain regions, including the DelMarVa <b>unit</b> <b>hydrograph,</b> developed for the Delaware-Maryland-Virginia peninsula, and the Upper Maurice River <b>unit</b> <b>hydrograph</b> in southern New Jersey. To verify the applicability of these types of alternative approaches, a study has been conducted in support of developing Regional Stormwater Management Plans for several watersheds in the region...|$|R

40|$|The {{analysis}} of about 240 flood hydrographs of 29 small watersheds {{on the island}} of Oahu, Hawaii, shows some unique hydrologic characteristics. A typical Hawaiian small watershed has a small area, flash peak, short time to peak, and small recession constant. Most of the hydrographs have the typical shape of a steep triangle. Based on statistical {{analysis of}} the observed flood hydrographs, a linear relationship has been found between peak discharge and the volume of runoff for each watershed. Because of the similar shape of the semi-dimensionless hydrographs, a unit-hydrograph with uncertain duration can be developed for each small watershed. The duration of such <b>unit</b> <b>hydrographs</b> can be determined by using the S-hydrograph technique with the equilibrium discharge as a criterion and the trial-and-error method utilizing a digital computer. The durations of the <b>unit</b> <b>hydrograph,</b> or the effective rainfall durations for Hawaiian small watersheds, were found to range from 5 minutes ot one hour. A good correlation has been found to exist between effective rainfall duration and the watershed area. Such a short duration <b>unit</b> <b>hydrograph</b> can be used to develop an instantaneous <b>unit</b> <b>hydrograph</b> by using Nash's conceptual model and the method of moments, assuming the effective rainfall is uniformly distributed with respect to time and space. The instantaneous unit hydrgraph for each watershed can then be solved by a computer. The two instantaneous <b>unit</b> <b>hydrograph</b> parameters, Gamma function argument, N, and reservoir storage constant, K, were found to correlate with areas of small watersheds. The instantaneous <b>unit</b> <b>hydrograph</b> of a given ungaged area can be determined by knowing the area of the watershed. The flood hydrograph with a given duration can also be solved by applying the incomplete Gamma function. The superposition characteristics of a linear model can be applied for hydrograph analysis of Hawaiian small watersheds. Hence, the design discharge with certain recurrence years for different engineering purposes can be directly multiplied with the design runoff, which may be obtained with the reference of the rainfall depth-frequency-duration charts and soil conditions for certain areas. A hydrograph study using an instantaneous <b>unit</b> <b>hydrograph</b> provides a good approach for hydrologic research since the short duration of effective rainfall is close to the duration caused by an instantaneous burst of rainfall. The study also synthesizes the parametric hydrograph which simplifies hydrograph analysis.
