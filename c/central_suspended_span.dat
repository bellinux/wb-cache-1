50|$|The {{bridge over}} the Detroit River had the longest <b>suspended</b> <b>central</b> <b>span</b> in the world when it was {{completed}} in 1929—1,850 ft. This was a record until the George Washington Bridge opened between New York and New Jersey in 1931. The bridge's total length is 7,500 feet (2,286 m). Construction began in 1927 and was completed in 1929. The architect was the McClintic-Marshall Company of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.|$|R
50|$|To reduce {{construction}} costs, the piers {{from the}} original bridge were reused for the new bridge. This meant that the old bridge had to be completely demolished before the new bridge could be built. The <b>central</b> 350 ft <b>suspended</b> <b>span</b> was lowered onto barges and floated away, {{while the rest of}} the bridge was dismantled piece by piece to maintain balance of the cantilever arms. The crossing was closed for a total of 17 months before the new bridge opened. The new bridge mimicked the old bridge's shape and scale, although it used box members instead of lattice beams and was of a continuous truss design instead of a cantilever-and-suspended-span design.|$|R

50|$|By {{the end of}} 1940, the {{erection}} of the cantilevered arms was commenced and {{was completed}} in mid-summer of 1941. The two halves of the <b>suspended</b> <b>span,</b> each 282 feet (86 m) long and weighing 2,000 tons, were built in December 1941. The bridge was erected by commencing at the two anchor spans and advancing towards the center, {{with the use of}} creeper cranes moving along the upper chord. 16 hydraulic jacks, each of which had an 800-ton capacity, were pressed into service to join the two halves of the <b>suspended</b> <b>span.</b>|$|R
5000|$|For the {{construction}} of the cantilevers, the BRIDGE_BUILDER system has been imported from Norway {{for the first time in}} India. An average cycle time of five days has been achieved here for segment construction, as against the accepted international average of seven days. FREYSSINET system has been adopted for pre-stressing. Careful detailing of reinforcement and a cable profile was necessitated to achiever good quality and to minimize construction time. In order to place concrete through dense reinforcement and cable assembly, use of super plasticisers has been made. For manufacture and placing of large volumes of high grade concrete, electronically controlled automatic ELBA batching plants along with concrete pumps, were imported from West Germany. The total installed concreting capacity was of the order of 1000 m3/day. [...] The <b>suspended</b> <b>span</b> consists of two R.C.C girders placed on the tips of cantilevers along with a cast-in-situ R.C.C deck. The purpose of providing the <b>suspended</b> <b>span</b> is to minimise damage to the pier during and earthquake, by structurally isolating the piers. The R.C.C girders of <b>suspended</b> <b>spans</b> are cost on the cantilevers and launched in position.|$|R

50|$|Since construction, {{the bridge}} has been altered little and has {{undergone}} repairs only for maintenance reasons. In 1988, {{the bridge was}} rehabilitated by replacing the pins and hangers of the non-redundant <b>suspended</b> <b>spans.</b> The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 20, 1999, and the Michigan Department of Transportation placed it on their list of historic bridges.|$|R
5000|$|After {{the failure}} of the Mianus River Bridge at Greenwich, Connecticut in 1983, the Harvard Bridge was shut down and {{inspected}} because it contained similar elements, specifically the <b>suspended</b> <b>spans.</b> [...] Traffic was restricted to the inner two lanes due to the discovery of two failed hangers on span 14. A few days later, all trucks and buses were banned from the bridge.|$|R
50|$|A pin and hanger {{assembly}} {{is used to}} connect two plate girders of a bridge. These assemblies are used to provide an expansion joint in the bridge. One beam (the anchor span) is set on a pier with a short section cantilevered out toward the next pier. The other (the <b>suspended</b> <b>span)</b> begins underneath the anchor span, and has its far end resting on the next pier. The beams have holes directly above each other. The two holes are connected using hangers, a pair of connecting plates sandwiching the bridge girders. A pair of large steel pins through the plates and girder webbing provide the hinges, holding up the <b>suspended</b> <b>span</b> while allowing it to move longitudinally. Large washers are bolted to {{each end of the}} pin to retain the hangers. Exceptionally long spans may have two sets of girders cantilevered from opposite bridge piers with a third set of girders suspended by pin and hanger assemblies from both cantilevers.|$|R

50|$|Work on {{the western}} {{highrise}} span was bid in October 1964 and commenced in 1965. It crosses a shipping channel, with an orthotropic main span that is 750 ft long (at the time, the longest girder span in the United States) and has a vertical clearance of 135 ft. The main span is flanked by two orthotropic back spans which are each 375 ft long, and there are seven orthotropic side spans on the approach to each back span. Each of these side spans are 292 ft long. Although these spans appear to be formed from continuous box girders, they consist of alternating anchor <b>spans</b> and <b>suspended</b> <b>spans.</b> Anchor spans rest on top of two adjacent piers and cantilever over each side slightly, and <b>suspended</b> <b>spans</b> are hung between the ends of two adjacent anchor spans. There are an additional nine 208 ft steel spans carrying a concrete deck on the San Mateo side of the highrise, and ten steel spans carrying a concrete deck on the Hayward side, ranging from 186 - 208 ft. The bridge carries about 93,000 cars and other vehicles on a typical day, almost double its original projected design capacity of 50,000 vehicles per day.|$|R
50|$|Connel Bridge has {{a span of}} 524 ft {{between the}} piers, but a clear span of 500 ft due to the {{supports}} which project from the piers towards {{the centre of the}} bridge. The <b>suspended</b> <b>span,</b> the box-shaped section {{in the middle of the}} bridge, is 232 ft long. The large span without supporting piers was necessitated by the strong tidal currents of the Falls of Lora, just to the east of the bridge.|$|R
50|$|Howrah Bridge is {{a bridge}} with a <b>suspended</b> <b>span</b> over the Hooghly River in West Bengal, India. Commissioned in 1943, {{the bridge was}} {{originally}} named the New Howrah Bridge, because it replaced a pontoon bridge at the same location linking the two cities of Howrah and Kolkata (Calcutta). On 14 June 1965 it was renamed Rabindra Setu after the great Bengali poet Rabindranath Tagore, {{who was the first}} Indian and Asian Nobel laureate. It is still popularly known as the Howrah Bridge.|$|R

50|$|During {{construction}} engineers knew deep foundations {{would be}} required to find bedrock, but at 20 metres below sea level they struck a red gum stump that took three weeks work to remove. It was dated at about 8,000 years old and appears to have lived for well over 400 years. The cantilever girder type, with steel girder <b>suspended</b> <b>span</b> bridge was completed in 1930, with an adjacent glass and steel covered footbridge built alongside in 1998, as part of the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre.|$|R
50|$|As the {{caissons}} {{were being}} {{sunk into the}} riverbed, the piers were being built on top of them, adding weight and driving the caisson deeper into the river bottom. The piers were masonry blocks of granite backed with concrete. The piers of the Harahan were located directly upstream of the piers of the Frisco Bridge to keep the navigation channels open to river traffic. Pier IV was moved 17 feet toward the river relative to the Frisco Pier IV. This enabled the engineers to design two <b>suspended</b> <b>spans</b> and three cantilevered arms identically.|$|R
