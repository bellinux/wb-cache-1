5|$|From 1903 the Manning Wardle {{locomotives}} {{were replaced}} by Metropolitan Railway D Class 2-4-0 tank engines, numbered 71 and 72. The D Class locomotives were unsatisfactory to the MR, and between 1916 and 1922 the MR sold their entire stock of D <b>Class</b> <b>engines.</b> Their place on the O was taken by two Metropolitan Railway A Class 4-4-0T locomotives numbered 23 and 41, built by Beyer, Peacock and Company in 1866 and 1869 respectively. The A Class locomotives would alternate in service, each operating the route for a week. No.41 was scrapped in 1936, but No.23 continued {{to be used by}} London Transport until 1948, and is now preserved in the London Transport Museum.|$|E
5|$|The second {{batch of}} ten new-build U class {{locomotives}} was constructed between February and May 1931 when more obsolete locomotives were withdrawn from service. This brought {{the total of}} new-build locomotives to 30, and {{the total number of}} operational U <b>class</b> <b>engines</b> to 50. The new batch also featured detail differences {{from the rest of the}} class, such as the arrangement of the footsteps at the front of the locomotive, though continued to use the standard left-hand drive cab layout to improve the driver’s forward vision from the cab. Smoke deflectors were fitted to the whole class from 1933 to prevent drifting smoke from obscuring forward vision. The smokebox snifting valves applied to the class by Maunsell were removed by his successor Oliver Bulleid, who also fitted U1 class chimneys to improve the draughting.|$|E
25|$|The twenty-five P class {{locomotives}} originally {{bore the}} numbers P441 to P465, but the surviving class members were renumbered P501 to P517 in 1947. The initial batch of 10 Pr <b>class</b> <b>engines</b> were numbered Pr138 to Pr147, while the eight later conversion retained their P class numbers. The Pr class designation was only adopted officially on locomotive registers in 1946, and accordingly saw the class renumbered Pr521 to Pr538.|$|E

25|$|During the {{introduction}} of the more powerful, albeit slower Y class in 1961, it was found that X <b>class</b> <b>engines</b> were susceptible to overheating when working in multiple with Y classes on slow, heavy trains. This was due to a design flaw which prevented the X class from running for a prolonged period at low speed under load. As a result, five were rewired between 1961 and 1970 to give better operation at low speed and reclassified as the XA class.|$|E
25|$|Moto2 (also {{known as}} 600cc class) is the 600cc {{four-stroke}} class, launched in 2010 {{to replace the}} traditional 250cc two-stroke <b>class.</b> <b>Engines</b> are supplied exclusively by Honda, tyres by Dunlop and electronics are limited and supplied only by FIM sanctioned producers with a maximum cost set at 650 EUR. Carbon brake discs are banned, only steel brake discs are allowed. However, there are no chassis limitations. From 2010 onwards, only 600cc four-stroke Moto2 machines have been allowed.. Starting in 2019 Triumph will be the sole supplier of Moto2 engines.|$|E
25|$|The next {{batch of}} ten P class {{locomotives}} were constructed locally in Western Australia in 1927, at the Midland Railway Workshops. They were {{identical to the}} North British locomotives excepting the short tenders rebuilt {{from those of the}} obsolete R <b>class</b> <b>engines.</b> This order was extended by an additional five locomotives which were delivered in 1929, bringing the total to twenty-five locomotives. Several exchanges of tenders occurred throughout the service life of the P and Pr class locomotives, such as exchanging the long tender of an unconverted P class locomotive for the short tender of a later Pr class engine.|$|E

25|$|While initial plans {{called for}} a round-top firebox (such as {{featured}} on the New Zealand AB class), the P class was eventually designed and delivered with Belpaire fireboxes, which improve steam production over the more traditional round-top types, but are harder to fit. The P class locomotives featured a wide firebox located behind the coupled wheels and supported by a trailing-wheel. The large firebox aided {{with the use of}} poor-grade local coal from the Collie coalfields. This low quality coal had frequently resulted in poor steaming in earlier locomotives, but the P class design largely avoided this problem, resulting in a locomotive 30% more economical than the earlier F <b>class</b> <b>engines</b> of similar tractive effort. The P and Pr class also featured innovations to alter the weight-distribution between the driving and trailing wheels, improving adhesive traction.|$|E
25|$|As with {{a number}} of other {{prominent}} independent schools in the South of England, a locomotive of the Southern Railway V Class was named after Winchester College. The second locomotive of the class, No. 901 Winchester was, like the other 39 V <b>Class</b> <b>engines,</b> constructed by the Southern at Eastleigh Works, not far away from the city of Winchester itself, and entered service in 1930. Winchester was one of those examples of the class selected by the railway's new chief mechanical engineer Oliver Bulleid for rebuilding with a Lemaître multiple-jet blastpipe and wide-diameter chimney from 1939 onwards. Upon passing into British Railways ownership due to the nationalisation of the railways in 1948, as an ex-SR machine Winchester was accordingly renumbered 30901. Like many members of the class, during 1962 No. 30901 was viewed as surplus to requirements, largely due to both increasing use of diesel traction and an expansion of the third-rail electrified network across former Southern Railway territory, and withdrawn from service.|$|E
500|$|As {{developments}} {{on the line}} from Chalfont Road to Chesham took place, progress continued on the [...] cross-Chiltern link between Chalfont and Aylesbury. On 1 September 1892 work was completed as far as a temporary station south of Aylesbury. (The connection with the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway—absorbed by the Metropolitan Railway in 1891—was completed in late 1893. From 1 January 1894 MR trains used the A's Aylesbury station, and the temporary station was abandoned.) The line to Chesham became a branch line, generally operated by a shuttle service between Chalfont Road and Chesham, although some trains at peak periods continued to run between London and Chesham. The MR had bought a number of Metropolitan Railway C Class locomotives to replace the ageing A and B <b>class</b> <b>engines,</b> but these performed poorly on the London-Aylesbury line and were soon replaced by the Metropolitan Railway D Class. As a consequence, the C <b>class</b> <b>engines</b> were often used on the Chesham shuttle services.|$|E

5000|$|Each name {{commenced}} {{with the}} same word or letters. For example, British Rail's <b>Class</b> 52 <b>engines</b> each carried a two-word name, {{the first of which}} was Western, Foster Yeoman's <b>Class</b> 59 <b>engines</b> similarly had Yeoman as the first word, and the <b>Class</b> 47 <b>engines</b> operated by Rail Express Systems had names commencing with the letters Res.|$|R
500|$|The MR {{sold all}} but one of the {{dilapidated}} goods wagons to the Llanelly and Mynydd Mawr Railway, replacing them with five eight-wheeled carriages built in 1865–66. The MR considered the Manning Wardle locomotives unreliable and from early 1903 they were replaced by a pair of Metropolitan Railway D <b>Class</b> <b>engines,</b> although they were not sold until 1911. The heavy D Class locomotives damaged the track, and in 1910 the track between Quainton Road and Brill was relaid to MR standards, using track removed from the inner London MR route but considered adequate for a rural branch line. Following this upgrading, the speed limit was increased to [...]|$|E
500|$|New {{branches}} to Uxbridge, Watford and Stanmore were built, and from 1915 the extremely effective Metro-land advertising campaign began, promoting the lightly developed areas along the MR's routes as ideal for commuting to London. Watkin's expansionist schemes {{had led to}} the acquisition of huge tracts of near-worthless land in the Buckinghamshire countryside around the MR's routes, as the MR had tried {{to take control of}} as much land as possible along every possible route between London and Manchester. With the GCR complete it was no longer necessary for the MR to keep these lands clear for potential railway use, and Selbie began development on a massive scale. By 1939 over 4,600 houses had been built by the MR alone, and entire new towns had grown around the MR's stations between Harrow and Aylesbury. This development not only generated huge amounts of money from property development, but vastly increased use of the railway for passenger and goods traffic. The MR's Baker Street terminus was also redeveloped and a block of 180 luxury apartments known as Chiltern Court was built above the station. With the profits generated, the line was further electrified to Rickmansworth. Again, the Chesham branch was not electrified and remained operated by steam locomotives; the electric locomotives would be uncoupled from their trains at Rickmansworth and a steam locomotive would haul the train to Chesham. By this time, the steam sections of the route were generally worked by the powerful Metropolitan Railway H <b>Class</b> <b>engines,</b> capable of speeds of up to [...]|$|E
2500|$|Diesel {{locomotives}} {{were only}} authorised {{to operate on}} the Roxburgh Branch {{at the time of}} its closure, to haul trains involved with the dismantling of the line. [...] DJ <b>class</b> <b>engines</b> were the main type of diesel locomotives used.|$|E

2500|$|... 'L1' <b>class</b> <b>engines,</b> {{initially}} numbered from 9000 upwards by the LNER and 69000 upwards by BR, {{were quickly}} renumbered to 67701 upwards, {{where there was}} more space for new engine numbers. The 69000 series was then reused for new-build 'J72' locomotives.|$|E
2500|$|The Donnellys Crossing Section was {{exclusively}} {{the domain}} of tank locomotives. [...] During the line's period of isolation, F <b>class</b> <b>engines</b> were the dominant motive power, and {{with the opening of}} the Dargaville Branch the line was upgraded to permit the use of WW class locomotives. [...] The line closed too early for diesel motive power to be introduced.|$|E
2500|$|Initially, the Taneatua Express {{operated}} daily, but {{the economic}} {{impacts of the}} Great Depression and World War II as well as post-war coal shortages meant that its services were often cut back to operate just twice or thrice weekly in each direction.

50|$|The NSB class 30 was a 4-6-0 tender steam {{locomotive}} formerly used in Norway by Norwegian State Railways. The <b>class</b> 30 <b>engines</b> were an upsized {{version of the}} NSB <b>Class</b> 45 <b>engines.</b> <b>Class</b> 30 locomotives were originally intended for use on the Dovre Line, but they were employed throughout the Norwegian rail network.

2500|$|In {{its very}} early days, it was {{occasionally}} operated by AB <b>class</b> <b>engines,</b> {{but the more}} powerful J and JA locomotives quickly became the sole motive power, and they were famous for hauling long strings of red carriages at high speed, achieving a travel time between Christchurch and Dunedin of 7 hours and 9 minutes, and completing the entire journey to Invercargill in [...] 11 hours 20 minutes.|$|E
2500|$|There was {{a further}} {{complication}} in that part-way through the renumbering, {{there was a}} change of plan {{in terms of the}} numbers allocated in the 1-999 series (for reasons that are mostly unclear), the 1xxx series (to allow more space for new 'B1' <b>class</b> <b>engines),</b> and the 3xxx series (to allow more space for engines purchased from the War Department). This meant some of these engines were renumbered twice (106 in total - 59 of which were 'O1' or 'O4' engines). The changes were as follows: ...|$|E
