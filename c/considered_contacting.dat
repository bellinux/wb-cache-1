However, as time progressed, her schedule commitments meant she {{would be unable to}} remain in the leading role, so she volunteered to play the smaller role of Casey Becker who dies early in the film. The production felt that killing off an actress of Barrymore's stature early on would be a risk but thought that it would be shocking to the audience and make them believe that no other character was safe. Following Barrymore's changed role, Alicia Witt and Brittany Murphy auditioned for the lead and the production also <b>considered</b> <b>contacting</b> Reese Witherspoon. The role was ultimately given to Neve Campbell after the director saw her in Party of Five, believing she could best embody a character who was [...] "innocent" [...] but also able to handle herself while dealing with the physicality and emotions of the role.

[...] The production wanted a recognizable face for the role of news reporter Gale Weathers, offering it to both Brooke Shields and Janeane Garofalo.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} help-seeking behavior in relation to sexual problems among people with a disease or an impairment, as well as determining factors that promote people to seek professional sexological help. A total of 341 respondents (224 men, 117 women) participated. Approximately 50 % wanted professional help with finding a sexual partner and sexual adjustment problems. Further, approximately 40 % wanted professional help for problems in their sexual relationship, practical sexual problems, and the inability to enjoy their sexuality. In total, two third <b>considered</b> <b>contacting</b> a health care professional of which 35 % had indeed had contact with a health care professional. Only a third of those evaluated these contacts as positive. To identify factors associated with the respondent's participation in psychosexual therapy, we performed a logistic regression analyses with a participation in a psychosexual intervention as the dependent variable. Sexual dissatisfaction was the strongest predictor of participation in psychosexual therapy. Furthermore, people who indicated that they wanted professional help for their sexual problems and people who had already discussed sexuality issues with a health care professional were more likely to participate. Disease and demographic characteristics did not influence one's decision to participate...|$|E

40|$|The {{idea for}} this paper {{originated}} in {{my interest in}} social psychology, specifically cross-cultural psychology. Fascinated by the way culture influences behavior, I thought of ways to study this across borders. Having read about social identity theory during my studies, I {{found it to be}} a comprehensive and informative framework for explaining human social behavior. Playing with the idea of designing a project to measure social identity in various countries, I soon realized this would prove challenging, especially logistically. I <b>considered</b> <b>contacting</b> universities, but not wishing to draw my sample from non-representative populations such as students, I had to pursue different solutions. During a university job fair I came to think of multinational companies to provide the perfect setting for the exploration of human behavior cross-culturally. These companies are situated in various countries, have a multicultural workforce, and the logistics for administering a survey are already in place. Also, all the employees share one common denominator, the company. Following the incorporation of social identity theory into organizational studies soon introduced me to the concept of organizational identification.

Numerical examples show the possibility to describe the average behavior of machined surfaces. ...|$|R
