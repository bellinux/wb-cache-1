The European Commission acted, that September revealing its proposed changes to medical device regulation, including expanded requirements on notified bodies, to be published in 2014 and go into effect in 2017. However, the Commission also opted to instate additional reforms — separate from its draft regulations — that would go into effect much sooner, asking notified bodies to perform unannounced visits to manufacturers and expand their device testing standards. At the same time the NB-MED (European Forum of Notified Bodies Medical Devices) coordination revised their Code of Conduct due to criticism.|$|R

40|$|The {{new edition}} of the ISO 9001 {{standard}} increases the overlap between the elements that characterize certified quality systems and the logic of Total Quality Management. Parallel to the conceptual evolution of the norm {{there must be an}} evolution towards the so-called performance/management audit model, in order to increase the ability to unveil ceremonial conformity and thus increase the value of the certifications. The evolution of the logic of audits takes on particular importance in the context of small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) since these companies tend to implement formal quality systems only when there is significant external pressure to do so, and when they do, their approach to the implementation of the ISO 9001 standard tends to be minimalist. In this article, the development of a tool for assessing conformity audits (made up of a set of ‘behavioural indicators’ which describe the actions that represent a behaviour that adheres to the logic of performance audit) is described and the results of an empirical study of a sample of 114 SMEs in the Veneto region are presented. The study highlights the uncertain nature of the evolution of <b>conformity</b> <b>assessments</b> and the prevalence of behaviours related to traditional audits in the indicators that best reflect the innovative logic of performance audits. This is an important message for the national accreditation bodies (at present, in Italy, SINCERT) which qualify auditors and try to make the certification system credible...|$|R

Objective To conduct an integrative literature review of controlled studies describing forensic neuropsychological assessment. Methods The articles were compiled and analyzed in two phases: 1) first, we retrieved all papers in PubMed by the keywords &# 8220;Forensic Neuropsychology&# 8221; and generated a growth curve for the subject and a cluster-based thematic distribution of publications. 2) We then conducted a curated analysis of all relevant papers indexed in Medline, PubMed and ISI, between 2000 and 2012. Results The evolution of the field during the last 15 years reveals an unstable growth pattern and three main thematic clusters. In terms of our curated analysis, a total of 390 articles were pre-selected, resulting in the selection of 44 fully-relevant studies, which comprise four main categories: cognitive damage in forensic psychiatric patients; imitation of cognitive damage; civil capacity, penal liability and violence risk; and validation of neuropsychological assessment tools.
