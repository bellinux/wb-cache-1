25|$|Empirical {{research}} has shown that attenuation in optical fiber is caused primarily by both scattering and absorption. Single-mode optical fibers can be made with extremely low loss. Corning's SMF-28 fiber, a standard single-mode fiber for telecommunications wavelengths, has a loss of 0.17dB/km at 1550nm. For example, an 8km length of SMF-28 transmits nearly 75% of light at 1,550nm. It has been noted that if ocean water was as clear as fiber, one <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>all</b> the way to the bottom even of the Marianas Trench in the Pacific Ocean, a depth of 36,000 feet.|$|E
25|$|The {{first episode}} of Chef! was {{developed}} over two years, and so Peter Tilbury and I were really put through loads of hoops about character motivation. Why is this character such an arsehole? Is this {{the right kind}} of character for Lenny Henry to be playing? All that kind of stuff. Once we got through that and they greenlit the series, Peter then had something like eight or nine weeks to write the rest of it. The remaining five episodes were much easier to write because we'd had every argument about who, what, where, and how. The world had been mapped out. Actually, the very first episode of Chef! was the hardest one to watch for me because we'd worked so hard on it and you <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>all</b> the things that had been rewritten in the first episode.|$|E
25|$|Fort de la Malmaison {{lay on the}} Chemin-des-Dames {{ridge and}} had been built {{as part of an}} entrenched camp north of the Aisne, in the Séré de Rivières system, {{designed}} by General Raymond Adolphe Séré de Rivières and built from the 1870s. The fort was in the northern angle between the Chemin-des-Dames and the Soissons–Laon road. The fortress casemates were tested with high explosives in 1887 and found to be insufficiently robust. Steel reinforced concrete had been added but in 1913, the fort was sold to a Laon contractor, to demolish and use the materials to build new barracks in town. A long tunnel, the Montparnasse Quarry lay on the northern slopes below the fort, on the route to Chavignon village {{at the foot of the}} ridge. The quarry was big enough to shelter an infantry brigade. The fort was to the north-west of the quarry, on the summit of the plateau at the western end of the ridge and the dismantled work was surrounded by a moat filled with mud. The subterranean galleries had been rebuilt and garrisoned by the Germans in September 1914, the outworks and interior being provided with several ferro-concrete machine-gun nests. From the ramparts, the Germans <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>all</b> movement from the Ailette to the Aisne and on the spurs running down to the Aisne from the Chemin-des-Dames ridge.|$|E

500|$|On April 14, 1894, {{a public}} Kinetoscope parlor was opened by the Holland Bros. in New York City at 1155 Broadway, {{on the corner}} of 27th Street—the first {{commercial}} motion picture house. The venue had ten machines, set up in parallel rows of five, each showing a different movie. For 25 cents a viewer <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>all</b> the films in either row; half a dollar gave access to the entire bill. The machines were purchased from the new Kinetoscope Company, which had contracted with Edison for their production; the firm, headed by Norman C. Raff and Frank R. Gammon, included among its investors Andrew M. Holland, one of the entrepreneurial siblings, and Edison's former business chief, Alfred O. Tate. The ten films that comprise the first commercial movie program, all shot at the Black Maria, were descriptively titled: Barber Shop, Bertoldi (mouth support) (Ena Bertoldi, a British vaudeville contortionist), Bertoldi (table contortion), Blacksmiths, Roosters (some manner of cock fight), Highland Dance, Horse Shoeing, Sandow (Eugen Sandow, a German strongman managed by Florenz Ziegfeld), Trapeze, and Wrestling. As historian Charles Musser describes, a [...] "profound transformation of American life and performance culture" [...] had begun.|$|E
2500|$|Records of a 13th-century {{event in}} which [...] "Greek fire" [...] {{was used by}} the Saracens against the Crusaders can be read through the Memoirs of the Lord of Joinville during the Seventh Crusade. [...] One {{description}} of the memoir says [...] "the tail of fire that trailed behind it was as big as a great spear; and it made such a noise as it came, that it sounded like the thunder of heaven. It looked like a dragon flying through the air. Such a bright light did it cast, that one <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>all</b> over the camp as though it were day, by reason of the great mass of fire, and the brilliance of the light that it shed." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Empress was an inveterate traveller, horsewoman, {{and fashion}} maven who was rarely seen in Vienna. Sisi was obsessed about {{preserving}} her beauty, carrying out many bizarre routines and strenuous [...] exercise, {{and as a}} result suffered from ill health. She was stabbed to death by an Italian anarchist in 1898 while on a visit to Geneva. A few days after the funeral, Robert of Parma {{wrote in a letter to}} his friend Tirso de Olazábal that [...] "It was pitiful to look at the Emperor, he showed a great deal of energy in his immense pain, but at times one <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>all</b> the immensity of his grief." [...] Franz Joseph never fully recovered from the loss. According to the future empress Zita of Bourbon-Parma he usually told his relatives: [...] "You'll never know how important she was to me" [...] or, according to some sources, [...] "You will never know how much I loved this woman." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Fourth Army {{attacked}} a low ridge north-west from Le Transloy to Ligny but achieved little success, trying to advance through {{a jumble of}} trenches, derelict artillery positions and strong points. New German trenches dug between the Flers and Gird lines formed tiers of defences to fight from, which due to the constant bombardments became unrecognisable. The Fourth Army slowly advanced into a dip overlooked from higher ground around Le Transloy and Warlencourt and towards the Butte de Warlencourt, from which German observers <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>all</b> round. Deliberate attacks on 7, 12, 18 and 23 October and smaller local attacks were quickly forced to ground by German machine-gun fire on the XIV and XV corps fronts but III Corps captured Le Sars before being held up around the defences of the butte. The Sixth Army experienced its worst fighting of the battle to capture the Saillisels, attacking on a [...] in the same conditions as the Fourth Army, with the same results for the same reasons. On {{the right of the}} attack, the French had more success and closed up on the southern approach to the villages but after 7 October this advance also slowed. In the middle of the month the villages were entered but not entirely captured until 12 November.|$|E
2500|$|On {{character}} interactions, Greenberg noted {{how there}} was [...] "a lot of dialogue between Jimmy and Mandy in the car. We {{used a lot}} of car mounts. I would light the alien so that he looked good, but if he passed into a shadow while going down the street you <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>all</b> the seams in his make-up. So I sometimes had to block all the streets with black paper." [...] The aliens were not too different from humans, and an incorrect lighting or camera angle could give away seams in the makeup. In attempting {{to identify with the}} aliens regarding a unique look, Greenberg chose a deep blue color for filming. He said, [...] "We ended up with very deep, strong blue – a sort of moonlight blue. We tried to do all the scenes in the movie that appear to be their places heavily favored by this deep blue color. The Encounters Club was one of those places." [...] Greenberg used Arriflex cameras and Zeiss lenses along with Fuji stock. Commenting on film grain he said, [...] "I figured out from tests that it is better for me to use Fuji. Once film is blown up to 70mm the grain will stand out more and Fuji has smaller grain than Kodak. I can control the contrast with light, but I {{have to live with the}} grain." [...] Making use of multiple cameras, Greenberg noted, [...] "Photographically, of course, one camera is best. But as a movie maker, and because I want the film to be a success, I realize that the photography is not the most important thing. The whole movie is most important. So in pre-production, I was the one pushing the director to always shoot with two or three cameras." ...|$|E

60|$|His {{words were}} true, {{as the others}} <b>could</b> readily <b>see.</b> <b>All</b> of their stores had been {{overhauled}} and some few of them taken away. On the floor lay the broken bowl of a clay pipe and near it some half-burnt tobacco.|$|R
60|$|I {{had hardly}} uttered the words before he caught up a heavy cane {{standing}} beside {{his desk and}} made for me. There was a wicked determination in his eyes, and I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>all</b> the evil passions within him were aroused.|$|R

6000|$|Joe nodded. He <b>could</b> <b>see</b> it <b>all</b> now. They had {{run into}} San Andreas, where his father worked the big quarries, and most {{probably}} the safe contained the wages of the thousand men or more whom he employed. [...] "Don't say anything," [...] he cautioned.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, sir. He {{said that}} he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> it <b>all</b> now, and hinted at a guilty liaison between Master Simmons's mother and the head master, accusing the latter of having cooked the marks, as his {{expression}} was, {{in order to gain}} favour with the former." ...|$|R
