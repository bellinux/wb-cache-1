40|$|A {{temporal}} flexible planning {{problem that}} involves <b>contingent</b> and requirement <b>events</b> can be formulated {{as a simple}} temporal network with uncertainty (STNU). An STNU is controllable {{when there is a}} strategy for executing the requirement events (or actions) {{in such a way that}} all the conditions involving <b>contingent</b> <b>events</b> can be satisfied in all situations. The most interesting and useful controllability property is dynamic controllability in which the remaining actions in an STNU can always be scheduled under all possible feasible durations of future <b>contingent</b> <b>events</b> when all the past <b>contingent</b> <b>events</b> are known. In this paper, we propose and study a novel problem of assigning bounds on the duration of each requirement link in order for the resulting STNU to be dynamically controllable and to minimize the total cost over the allowed durations of all requirement links. We first prove the NP hardness of the problem with a linear cost function. We then formulate the dynamic controllability of an STNU as the constraints in a nonlinear optimization problem. Finally, we present methods for reducing the number of constraints in order to make the problem tractable and to demonstrate the computational performance of our methods.

Acknowledging that {{realized}} contingencies alter observed political outcomes, however, does little to advance the systematic study of politics.

40|$|Pari-mutuel {{markets are}} trading {{platforms}} {{through which the}} common market maker simultaneously clears multiple contingent claims markets. This market has several distinctive properties that began attracting {{the attention of the}} financial industry in the 2000 s. For example, the platform aggregates liquidity from the individual contingent claims market into the common pool while shielding the market maker from potential financial loss. The contribution of this paper is two-fold. First, we provide a new economic interpretation of the market-clearing strategy of a pari-mutuel market that is well known in the literature. The pari-mutuel auctioneer is shown to be equivalent to the market maker with extreme ambiguity aversion for the future <b>contingent</b> <b>event.</b> Second, based on this theoretical understanding, we present a new market-clearing algorithm called the Knightian Pari-mutuel Mechanism (KPM). The KPM retains many interesting properties of pari-mutuel markets while explicitly controlling for the market maker's ambiguity aversion. In addition, the KPM is computationally efficient in that it is solvable in polynomial time...|$|E
40|$|The {{cognitive}} mechanism of human communication {{seems to be}} a complex system that shows multiple interactions among feeling about communication, responsive action, and timing perception of responses by an interactant.

According to the previous findings that the onset timing of the <b>contingent</b> <b>event</b> of one’s own voluntary action is perceived as earlier than actual (Haggard, Clark, & Kalogeras, 2002) and that responses at earlier timing are regarded as communica-tive (Yoshikawa, Shinozawa, & Ishiguro, 2007), we hypothe-size that human might estimate the onset timing of responses by a communication partner as earlier than actual, which is what we call the intrapersonal being-responded-to cascade ef-fect.

When, however, repeated key pecks failed to produce the imprinted stimulus, distress vocalization ensued and peck rate declined; (4) both the presentation of an unfamiliar mechanical figure and delivery of electrical shock enhanced distress vocalization and key pecks; (5) for some ducklings, certain familiar objects in the environment influenced distress calls in a manner comparable to the imprinted stimulus in that distress calls increased when these objects were removed...|$|E

Studies have demonstrated {{a relationship between}} early sequence learning skills and later development of cog- nitive and language skills. We investigated the relation between infants’ visual response speed to novel event sequences, and their later receptive and productive vocabulary. Using a modified visual expectancy paradigm (VExP; Haith, Wentworth, & Canfield, 1993), we tested 6 -month-old infants’ speed at responding to novel but predictable <b>contingent</b> <b>event</b> sequences. In addition, parental reports and behavioral measures of infants’ vocabulary were obtained at 12, 16, and 22 months. In order to estimate the separate effects of linguistic input on vocabulary, maternal speech from a play session at 12 months was analyzed for lexical diversity and quantity. Results suggest that infants’ speed of responding to novel but predictable events at 6 months robustly predicted both receptive and pro- ductive vocabulary at 22 months. This relation cannot be attributed to general cognitive maturity, as measured by a standardized test (Bayley Scales of Infant Development; Bayley, 2005). Maternal input predicted additional unique variance in infant processing speed. The results suggest that infants’ capacity to quickly learn and respond to sequential patterns, {{over and above the}} quality of the speech input they receive, contributes to vocabulary size in the second year...|$|E

40|$|The {{comparative}} {{history of}} the Americas {{has been used to}} identify factors determining longterm economic growth. One approach, new institutional economics (NIE), claims that the colonial origins of respective institutional structures explain North American success and Spanish American failure. Another argues that differences in resources encountered by Europeans fostered divergent levels of equality impacting on institutions and growth. This paper challenges the theoretical premises and historical evidence of both views offering a historicized, statistically and economically validated explanation for the institutional and economic development of Spanish America. First, it revises the structure of the fiscal system challenging the characterization of Spain as an absolutist ruler. Secondly, an analysis of fiscal data at regional levels assesses the performance of the Imperial state. It shows the existence of massive revenue redistribution within the colonies, disputing the notion of a predatory extractive empire based on endowments as the source of original inequality. Finally, we discuss how a <b>contingent</b> <b>event,</b> the imprisonment of the Spanish king in 1808, contributed to the disintegration of a 300 -year-old empire. The crisis of legitimacy in the empire turned fiscal interdependence between regions into beggar-thy-neighbour strategies and internecine conflict. We conclude by arguing for a reversal of the causality from weak institutions causing economic failure to fiscal (and economic) failure leading to political instability. ...|$|E
40|$|The RNA World {{model for}} {{prebiotic}} evolution posits {{the selection of}} catalytic/template RNAs from random populations. The mechanisms by which these random populations could be generated de novo are unclear. Non-enzymatic and RNA-catalyzed nucleic acid polymerizations are poorly processive, {{which means that the}} resulting short-chain RNA population could contain only limited diversity. Nonreciprocal recombination of smaller RNAs provides an alternative mechanism for the assembly of larger species with concomitantly greater structural diversity; however, the frequency of any specific recombination event in a random RNA population is limited by the low probability of an encounter between any two given molecules. This low probability could be overcome if the molecules capable of productive recombination were redundant, with many nonhomologous but functionally equivalent RNAs being present in a random population. Here we report fluctuation experiments to estimate the redundancy of the set of RNAs in a population of random sequences that are capable of non-Watson-Crick interaction with another RNA. Parallel SELEX experiments showed that at least one in 106 random 20 -mers binds to the P 5. 1 stem–loop of Bacillus subtilis RNase P RNA with affinities equal to that of its naturally occurring partner. This high frequency predicts that a single RNA in an RNA World would encounter multiple interacting RNAs within its lifetime, supporting recombination as a plausible mechanism for prebiotic RNA evolution. The large number of equivalent species implies that the selection of any single interacting species in the RNA World would be a <b>contingent</b> <b>event,</b> i. e., one resulting from historical accident...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} contingency and the event vis-a-vis private and public documentaries. In China, the private and the public documentary form are often understood as mutually antagonistic, with the former defining itself explicitly against the latter. Rather than dwell on these differences, {{many of which are}} both well-documented and legitimate, I intend here to demonstrate how in certain ways, the private documentary form may actually be seen as a logical culmination of the xianchang [shooting live] aesthetic initiated by the early pioneers of the New Documentary Film Movement [hereafter NDFM]. In order to do this, I will focus {{on the issue of the}} spontaneous event, and its connection with the two documentary forms. After outlining the theoretical relationship between the spontaneous event and the problem of contingency, I proceed to suggest that the early relationship with this aspect of shooting live was in fact highly conflicted, and that the development of the public documentary form was in part a response to such tension. In fact, it was a means of limiting exposure to the contingent as understood in these terms. In the documentary form, such inhibitions have been shed in favour of drawing the <b>contingent</b> <b>event</b> into the heart of the documentary film, something I argue is not in fact restricted to the private genre, but characteristic of a range of contemporary documentary film work. This reflects not only changes in documentary film practice, but also how understandings both of what a documentary is, and what it does, have altered in the decade since the NDFM's inception...|$|E

40|$|Aim The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the number of successful establishments of the invasive Argentine ant outside native range and to see whether introduced supercolonies have resulted from single or multiple introductions. We also compared the genetic diversity of native versus introduced supercolonies to assess the size of the propagules (i. e. the number of founding individuals) at the origin of the introduced supercolonies. Location Global. Methods We used mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) markers and microsatellite loci to study 39 supercolonies of the Argentine ant Linepithema humile covering both the native (n = 25) and introduced range (n = 14). Results Data from three mitochondrial genes and 13 nuclear microsatellites suggest that the introduced supercolonies studied originated from at least seven founding events out of the native area in Argentina (primary introductions). The distribution of mtDNA haplotypes also suggests that supercolonies in the introduced range each derive from a single source supercolony and that one of these source supercolonies has been particularly successful, being the basis of many introduced populations spread across the world. Comparison of the genetic diversity of supercolonies based on the five most diverse loci also revealed that native and introduced supercolonies have greatly overlapping ranges of diversity, although the genetic diversity is on average less in introduced than in native supercolonies. Main conclusions Both primary introductions (from the native range) and secondary introductions (from sites with established invasive supercolonies) were important in the global expansion of the Argentine ant. In combination with the similar social organization of colonies in the native and introduced range, this indicates that invasiveness did not evolve recently as a unique and historically <b>contingent</b> <b>event</b> (e. g. reduction of genetic diversity) in this species. Rather, native L. humile supercolonies have characteristics that make them pre-adapted to invade new - and in particular disturbed - habitats when given the opportunity. These results have important implications with regard to possible strategies to be used to control invasive ants...|$|E
40|$|This {{doctoral}} dissertation examines the Ulster Women’s Unionist Council (UWUC), an overlooked, but historically significant Ulster unionist institution, during the 1910 s and 1920 s—a {{time of great}} conflict. Ulster unionists opposed Home Rule for Ireland. World War I erupted in 1914 and {{was followed by the}} Anglo-Irish War (1919 - 1922), the partition of Ireland in 1922, and the Civil War (1922 - 1923). Within a year of its establishment the UWUC was the largest women’s political organization in Ireland with an estimated membership of between 115, 000 and 200, 000. Yet neither the male-dominated Ulster unionist institutions of the time, nor the literature related to Ulster unionism and twentieth-century Irish politics and history have paid much attention to its existence and work. This dissertation seeks to redress this. The framework of analysis employed is original in terms of the concepts it combines with a gender focus. It draws on Rogers Brubaker’s (1996) concepts of “nation” as practical category, institutionalized form (“nationhood”), and <b>contingent</b> <b>event</b> (“nationness”), combining these concepts with William Walters’ (2004) concept of “domopolitics” and with a feminist understanding of the centrality of gender to nation. This analytical framework is used to explore the UWUC’s role in the Ulster unionist movement during the 1910 s and the 1920 s, with a particular focus on the gendered constitution of Ulster. This study argues that Ulster historically has been constituted through the gendered discourses, norms, symbols, rituals, traditions, and practices of Ulster unionist institutions, and contingent events, such as the Ulster Crisis, World War I, the Anglo-Irish War, and the partition of Ireland. This dissertation analyzes primary sources related to the UWUC. It reveals the extent of the work undertaken by members of the UWUC in terms of opposing Home Rule and constituting Ulster. It argues that the scale of the mobilization of the UWUC and the scope of its anti-Home Rule work makes clear that the UWUC was not peripheral to Ulster unionism; nor were its members “idle sightseers” in terms of the events of the 1910 s and 1920 s and the constitution of Ulster...|$|E
30|$|In short, {{the whole}} book skillfully contextualizes Middle Eastern affairs since the Arab Spring {{in the broader}} context of global history. McMillan {{effortlessly}} stimulates readers by retelling how a <b>contingent</b> <b>event</b> or one person’s small decision has surprisingly altered and significantly sealed {{the fate of the}} Middle East from the outbreak of the First World War. While many are aware of the impossibility of understanding the present Middle East without a historical perspective, the main strength of this book is that it never gives readers the impression that history is boring or difficult so that they lose interest in learning about the past. Indeed, McMillan successfully weaves past events through interesting stories, attracting readers to listen to her excellent storytelling and gain the wisdom distilled from the lessons of history. While appreciating the author’s effort in providing an objective historical analysis of the outbreak of the Arab Spring, however, this book has its weaknesses. It does not provide an analysis {{to make sense of the}} spontaneous emergence of uprisings and the possibility of a democratic Arab future. To overcome the weaknesses, the book requires a more detailed analysis of the recent causes of the Arab Spring and beyond. To complement McMillan’s study, several unexpected and new elements of future democratic development in the Middle East should be covered. Shared by scholars in the Middle Eastern Studies (e.g., Sadiki 2015), McMillan rightly stresses the Arab Spring as a bottom-up youth movement, and young people as major actors and agents of bottom-up change for the Arab world. But the book fails to unfold the young generation’s growing demands for an end to corruption and authoritarian rule, the right to free expression, the end of restrictions on citizens’ political rights and the failure to implement liberalizing economic reforms (e.g., Rand 2013). It does not address the power of social media in enabling young people to express their outrage and hope beyond the traditional control of power structures, so that rapid mobilization can emerge off-line (e.g. Castells 2015). Nor does it consider the post-Islamists’ call for reform, not fundamental revolution, directed through civil, non-religious groups, frontier women’s groups and the Islamists parties (e.g., Bayat 2017; Esposito et al. 2015; Mandaville 2014). While some scholars have been optimistic in viewing the Arab Spring as inaugurating a new era of postcolonial thinking about the Middle East (e.g., Dabashi 2012), some puzzles remain unanswered. For example, why has regime change taken place only in some countries (Tunisia, Egypt, Yemen and Libya) and democratization in others (Tunisia and Morocco), while in some countries there has been a complete absence of uprisings (e.g., Algeria and Saudi Arabia), an increase of authoritarianism (e.g., Turkey, Bahrain and Kuwait) and even further fragmentation and civil war in others (e.g., Libya and Syria) (e.g. Browlee et al. 2015; Szmolka 2017)? Unfortunately, readers will not find the answers to these questions in McMillan’s book.|$|E
