The State Department authorized the evacuation on 2 January and on that day, Ambassador Bishop specifically requested an evacuation by the US military, thereby initiating Operation Eastern Exit. Ambassador Bishop had spent {{a considerable amount of}} time discussing contingency plans for evacuation with other diplomatic posts. Ultimately, ten heads of missions—eight ambassadors and two chargés d'affaires—along with their staff sought refuge in the US embassy compound and were evacuated.|$|E
5|$|When Rasputin {{was murdered}} in December 1916, Victoria and Kirill signed a letter along with other {{relatives}} asking the Tsar to show leniency to Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich of Russia, one of those implicated in the murder. The Tsar denied their request. Twice during the war Victoria visited Romania, where her sister Marie was now queen, volunteering aid for war victims. Victoria returned to Saint Petersburg in February 1917. Kirill had been appointed commander of the Naval Guards, quartered in Saint Petersburg, so he <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>with</b> his family for some time. Although publicly loyal to the Tsar, Victoria and Kirill began to meet in private with other relatives to discuss {{the best way to}} save the monarchy.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Peter {{begins to}} insult Lois about her {{advancing}} age, including her minor strands of gray hair. This makes her extremely self-conscious, and soon Lois {{becomes aware of}} her lust for a younger man. After introducing her new boyfriend, Anthony, to the family, Meg goes on to make out {{with him on the}} family couch, with Lois watching over nearby. Jealous of her daughter's new-found love, she begins hitting on Anthony. Later that day, Lois sends Meg to pick up her grandfather, leaving her all alone with Anthony. The two then begin making out on the couch, but Meg returns to the house only a few moments later and discovers them. Angry at her mother for ruining her chance at having a normal boyfriend, Meg threatens Lois to lay off of him, pulling out one of her own teeth in frustration. Lois quickly agrees, but is still angry with Peter for continually insulting her. She confronts him about this, and he admits that he was actually embarrassed about his own advancing age, as well as his lack of fitness, and was only insulting Lois in order to distract her from the fact that she <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>with</b> a much better-looking man. He apologizes for his behavior, and Lois forgives him.|$|E

25|$|The {{writing and}} {{recording}} sessions for Siren Song of the Counter Culture were marred by numerous distractions and inconveniences. In November 2003, Dreamworks {{was acquired by}} Universal Music Group for US$100 million, and eventually folded into Geffen Records. The transition period between labels left Rise Against without an A representative, and little acknowledgement from Geffen executives. Guitarist Todd Mohney left the band during the writing sessions, was replaced by Chris Chasse of Reach the Sky. McIlrath noted that the band was nervous about teaching Chasse completely new songs in a short period. Meanwhile, McIlrath was experiencing more personal distractions. Some Rise Against fans accused the band of selling out after signing with Dreamworks. Although McIlrath felt {{that most of the}} fans would realize that the band had not changed upon hearing the album, it still bothered him knowing that some longtime fans now hated the band for switching labels. Additionally, McIlrath's wife, who was seven months pregnant, went into labor {{while he was in the}} vocal booth. The band temporarily moved recording sessions from Vancouver to Chicago so that McIlrath <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>with</b> his wife.|$|E

[...] There she joined up with Daniel Ezralow, Jamey Hampton, and Ashley Roland, and the four created the Connecticut-based, dancer-illusionist company MOMIX.

The episode was scored by Mark Lanegan, with whom Thomas had gone to elementary school. Thomas was favorable towards the scene in which Veronica and Logan discuss his past, stating that the scene could have dragged due to its length but that it did not. When scripting the scene, there was a discussion in the writers' room regarding what the extent of Veronica's jealousy <b>could</b> <b>be,</b> <b>with</b> Thomas and Ruggiero, who Thomas described as [...] "naturally jealous people", winning out and making Veronica more envious rather than less. For the scene in which Veronica asks Keith about the report on Dean O'Dell's suicide by humorously requiring him to sing what he has found, Colantoni gave nine different musical impressions of his dialogue, [...] "I finally got the police report on the Dean's suicide!" ...|$|E

500|$|Thome {{missed a}} {{significant}} portion of the first half of the Phillies' 2005 season due to injury; he compiled only a [...]207 batting average with 7 home runs and 30 RBIs going into the All-Star break. He was only sporadically effective; one result was that Phillies fans booed him and cheered for replacement Ryan Howard instead. He had season-ending surgery on his right elbow in August, while Howard won the NL Rookie of the Year Award. The Phillies traded Thome and cash considerations to the Chicago White Sox on November 25, 2005, for outfielder Aaron Rowand and minor league pitching prospects Gio González and Daniel Haigwood. Though the emergence of Howard made Thome more expendable to the squad, another factor in his trade to the White Sox was his family situation – Thome's mother, the [...] "go-to lady" [...] in his family and his biggest fan, had died a year earlier, and he worried about his father. Since Philadelphia was willing to trade him, Thome waived the no-trade clause in his contract for the good of the team and requested that if possible, they trade him to Chicago so he <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>with</b> his father.|$|E
500|$|In March 2016, Alisha Grauso of Forbes {{discussed}} the series and its ratings, describing {{the show as}} having [...] "never quite been the ratings hit for ABC that the network had hoped it would be...It's hard enough to write a film script that fits within {{the continuity of the}} larger Marvel Cinematic Universe, even harder to do it with a full-length TV season that must act as connective tissue to the larger world while still being its own thing." [...] Grauso opined that the series' ratings may improve if it either focused on trying to be the best series it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> (<b>with</b> fewer connections to the films, like the Marvel-Netflix shows) or on just being [...] "support and tie-in {{to the world of the}} Avengers". Grauso concluded, [...] "The end result for either scenario is that, hopefully, ratings move up and stay up. In the first case, fans might be lost by the disconnect from the MCU, but a stronger storyline and more consistent writing would bring them and new fans back. In the second scenario, fans would tune in every week for fear of missing out on a bit of story that's important to the larger world." ...|$|E

[...] Looking back on the incident, Skeels stated, [...] "We lost our innocence over this ... We really learned to be more suspicious ...

500|$|In jazz, as in {{classical}} music, tone clusters {{have not been}} restricted to the keyboard. In the 1930s, the Jimmie Lunceford Orchestra's [...] "Stratosphere" [...] included ensemble clusters among an array of progressive elements. The Stan Kenton Orchestra's April 1947 recording of [...] "If I <b>Could</b> <b>Be</b> <b>With</b> You One Hour Tonight," [...] arranged by Pete Rugolo, features a dramatic four-note trombone cluster {{at the end of}} the second chorus. As described by critic Fred Kaplan, a 1950 performance by the Duke Ellington Orchestra features arrangements with the collective [...] "blowing rich, dark, tone clusters that evoke Ravel." [...] Chord clusters also feature in the scores of arranger Gil Evans. [...] In his characteristically imaginative arrangement of George Gershwin's [...] "There's a boat that's leaving soon for New York" [...] from the album Porgy and Bess, Evans contributes chord clusters orchestrated on flutes, alto saxophone and muted trumpets as a background to accompany Miles Davis' solo [...] In the early 1960s, arrangements by Bob Brookmeyer and Gerry Mulligan for Mulligan's Concert Jazz Band employed tone clusters in a dense style bringing to mind both Ellington and Ravel. Eric Dolphy's bass clarinet solos would often feature [...] "microtonal clusters summoned by frantic overblowing." [...] Critic Robert Palmer called the [...] "tart tone cluster" [...] that [...] "pierces a song's surfaces and penetrates to its heart" [...] a specialty of guitarist Jim Hall's.|$|E
500|$|Scott Derrickson {{did not see}} a lookbook for Doctor Strange, instead putting {{together}} his own presentation, with concept art and storyboards by himself and professionals he hired, to sell himself and {{his vision of the}} film to Marvel. In contrast, Marvel shared several different ideas for what Thor: Ragnarok <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>with</b> prospective filmmakers, who then went away and developed what they thought the film should be from that. Taika Waititi created a sizzle reel using clips from other films to present his vision based on Marvel's ideas, a practice that Marvel discourages as they [...] "oftentimes can be really terrible". However, Marvel thought Waititi's was [...] "amazing". Derrickson and Waititi were both eventually hired for the films. For Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Joe and Anthony Russo met with the studio four times over two months before they were hired, during which they [...] "kept getting more and more specific about what our vision was", {{putting together}} [...] "reference videos, storyboards, script pages, you name it.

500|$|Nina was in {{her first}} {{relationship}} with fellow student Taj Coppin (Jaime Robbie Reyne), when, during a trip away to the beach, Jack Scully (Jay Bunyan) realised he was attracted to her. When Nina was cast in Harold's play, Mission Erinsborough, alongside Jack, she realised that she liked him too and they begin an affair. Peter Mattessi of The Age said their love [...] "bubbled until it almost erupted". Nina broke up with Taj so she <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>with</b> Jack, but before Jack could break up with his girlfriend Lori Lee (Michelle Ang), she was paralysed during an accident. Jack became torn over whether to leave Lori and be with Nina. Both Lori and Taj found out about Nina and Jack, so Nina decided to remain single, but eventually she and Jack began their relationship properly. When Nina told Jack {{that she was not}} ready to consummate their relationship, Jack cheated on her with Edwina Valdez (Lucia Smyrk). Taj told Nina about Jack's cheating and she broke up with him. She later kissed Connor in front of Jack to make him jealous. Jay Bunyan commented, [...] "Jack gets really angry, especially with Connor, who is supposed to be his mate. He threatens to tell Nina about Connor getting Lori pregnant, as a way of getting back at him." [...] Nina became confused about her love life and was unsure whether she still had feelings for Jack.

2500|$|Another {{reason for}} the trend back to open kitchens (and a {{foundation}} of the [...] "kitchen object" [...] philosophy) is changes in how food is prepared.
