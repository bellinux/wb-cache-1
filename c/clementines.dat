25|$|In {{the thirteenth}} century, the Roman Church began {{to collect and}} {{organize}} its canon law, which after a millennium of development had become a complex and difficult system of interpretation and cross-referencing. The official collections were the Liber Extra (1234) of Pope Gregory IX, the Liber Sextus (1298) of Boniface VIII and the <b>Clementines</b> (1317), prepared for Clement V but published by John XXII. These were addressed to the universities by papal letters {{at the beginning of}} each collection, and these texts became textbooks for aspiring canon lawyers. In 1582 a compilation was made of the Decretum, Extra, the Sext, the <b>Clementines</b> and the Extravagantes (that is, the decretals of the popes from Pope John XXII to Pope Sixtus IV).|$|E
50|$|The story {{takes place}} in France at the {{beginning}} of the new millennium, between the years of 1994 and 2008. After the death of her partner <b>Clémentine,</b> Emma goes to the home of <b>Clémentine's</b> parents, in accordance with <b>Clémentine's</b> will, to request access to <b>Clémentine's</b> personal diary. Emma must face the hostility of <b>Clémentine's</b> father—somewhat off-set by <b>Clementine's</b> welcoming mother. The story then follows Emma as she reads <b>Clémentine's</b> diary, which tells the whole story of the relationship between the two young women from <b>Clémentine's</b> teenage years and her first meeting with Emma to her untimely death. In the beginning, <b>Clémentine</b> meets a boy who is a student in Terminale; both like each other, but soon afterwards, <b>Clémentine</b> becomes intrigued by a chance meeting with a blue-haired young woman on the arm of another woman named Sabine. For <b>Clémentine,</b> it is love at first sight. Unable to forget this encounter she starts to have doubts about her sexuality—but decides to date the boy because she wants to feel normal. Six months later, however, <b>Clémentine</b> is unable to have sex with that boy and breaks up with him. Feeling depressed, she is helped by one of her male friends, Valentin, to whom she confesses everything; Valentin tells her that he has already dated a boy, which <b>Clémentine</b> finds quite comforting.|$|R
50|$|<b>Clementine's</b> Mother, <b>Clementine's</b> unnamed mother, an artist. Portrayed {{as being}} {{understanding}} and kind with her daughter, albeit she, too, has found herself exasperated {{with examples of}} poor cooperation on her daughter's part (such as in the debut book of the series, where <b>Clementine</b> somehow finds herself in trouble constantly {{throughout the course of}} a single week at school) albeit she's understanding nonetheless. In <b>Clementine</b> and the Family Meeting, she becomes pregnant, much to <b>Clementine's</b> chagrin.|$|R
50|$|Shortly thereafter, Valentin takes <b>Clémentine</b> to some gay bars. During {{that evening}} at a lesbian bar <b>Clémentine</b> sees the blue-haired young woman again with Sabine. The blue-haired girl comes {{to talk to}} <b>Clémentine</b> and {{introduces}} herself as Emma. The two keep in touch and become friends, while <b>Clémentine</b> secretly {{falls in love with}} Emma. <b>Clémentine</b> then has to face the gossip and homophobic rants from some of her schoolmates when they hear that she and Emma were in a gay bar together. Some time later, while the relationship between Emma and Sabine has somewhat stalled (mainly because Sabine is often cheating on her friends) <b>Clémentine</b> eventually confesses her feelings to Emma, who confesses, in turn, to being in love with her. The girls have sex and start an affair. Emma eventually finds the strength to break up with Sabine and to start living with <b>Clémentine.</b> One night, when the two young women spend the evening together at <b>Clémentine's</b> place, Emma walks into the kitchen completely naked to get a glass of milk and <b>Clémentine's</b> mother catches her. <b>Clémentine's</b> parents then find both of them nude in the bedroom and their reaction is violently hostile: <b>Clémentine</b> is thrown out of her home, along with Emma.|$|R
25|$|An {{enormous}} number of cultivars have, like the sweet orange, a mix of pomelo and mandarin ancestry. Some cultivars are mandarin-pomelo hybrids, bred from the same parents as the sweet orange (e.g. the tangor and ponkan tangerine). Other cultivars are sweet orange x mandarin hybrids (e.g. <b>clementines).</b> Mandarin traits generally include being smaller and oblate, easier to peel, and less acidic. Pomelo traits include a thick white albedo (rind pith, mesocarp) that is more closely attached to the segments.|$|E
25|$|Canon law greatly {{increased}} from 1140 to 1234. After that it slowed down, {{except for the}} laws of local councils (an area of canon law in need of scholarship), and secular laws supplemented. In 1234 Pope Gregory IX promulgated the first official collection of canons, called the Decretalia Gregorii Noni or Liber Extra. This {{was followed by the}} Liber Sextus (1298) of Boniface VIII, the <b>Clementines</b> (1317) of Clement V, the Extravagantes Joannis XXII and the Extravagantes Communes, all of which followed the same structure as the Liber Extra. All these collections, with the Decretum Gratiani, are together referred to as the Corpus Juris Canonici. After the completion of the Corpus Juris Canonici, subsequent papal legislation was published in periodic volumes called Bullaria.|$|E
500|$|Goats {{and sheep}} proliferate {{on the island}} of Corsica, and lamb are used to prepare dishes such as [...] "stufato", ragouts and roasts. Cheeses are also produced, with [...] "brocciu" [...] being the most popular. Chestnuts, growing in the Castagniccia forest, are used to produce flour, which is used in turn to make bread, cakes and polenta. The forest {{provides}} acorns used to feed the pigs and boars that provide much of the protein for the island's cuisine. Fresh fish and seafood are common. The island's pork is used to make fine hams, sausage and other unique items including coppa (dried rib cut), lonzu (dried pork fillet), figatella, salumu (a dried sausage) salcietta, Panzetta, bacon, figatellu (smoked and dried liverwurst) and prisuttu (farmer's ham). [...] <b>Clementines</b> (which hold an AOC designation), lemons, nectarines and figs are grown there. Candied citron is used in nougats, while and the aforementioned brocciu and chestnuts are also used in desserts. Corsica offers a variety of wines and fruit liqueurs, including Cap Corse, Patrimonio, Cédratine, Bonapartine, liqueur de myrte, vins de fruit, Rappu, and eau-de-vie de châtaigne.|$|E

500|$|When Bachelot and Short {{arrived in}} Honolulu in May 1837, they spent only 13 {{days on the}} island.

Their efforts to secure freedom for the priests to live on the island were unsuccessful until the British naval vessel HMS Sulphur and the French frigate the La Vénus arrived in Honolulu on [...] The ships were commanded respectively by Edward Belcher and Dupetit Thouars, who each tried to convince the authorities to allow the priests to return to the island. After negotiations proved futile, they blockaded the harbor, boarded the Clémentine, and brought Bachelot and Short ashore.

2500|$|However, only {{a limited}} number of people can bring claims for {{judicial}} review. Under TFEU article 263(2), a member state, the Parliament, Council or Commission have automatic rights to seek judicial review. But under article 263(4) a [...] "natural or legal person" [...] must have a [...] "direct and individual concern" [...] about the regulatory act. [...] "Direct" [...] concern means that someone is affected by an EU act without [...] "the interposition of an autonomous will between the decision and its effect", for instance by a national government body. In Piraiki-Patraiki v Commission, a group of Greek textile businesses, who exported cotton products to France, challenged a Commission decision allow France to limit exports. The Commission argued that the exporters were not directly concerned, because France might decide not to limit exports, but the Court of Justice held this possibility was [...] "entirely theoretical". A challenge could be brought. By contrast in Municipality of Differdange v Commission a municipality wanted to challenge the Commissions decision to aid steel firms which reduced production: this would probably reduce its tax collections. But the Court of Justice held that because Luxembourg had discretion, and its decision to reduce capacity was not inevitable, the municipality had no [...] "direct" [...] concern (its complaint was with the Luxembourg government instead). [...] "Individual" [...] concern requires that someone is affected specifically, not as a member of a group. In Plaumann & Co v Commission the Court of Justice held that a clementine importer was not individually concerned when the Commission refused permission to Germany to stop import custom duties. This kept it more expensive for Mr Plaumann to import <b>clementines,</b> but it was equally expensive for everyone else. This decision heavily restricted the number of people who could claim for judicial review. In Unión de Pequeños Agricultores, Advocate General Jacobs propose a broader test of allowing anyone to claim if there was a [...] "substantial adverse effect" [...] on the claimant's interests. Here, a group of Spanish olive oil producers challenged Council Regulation No 1638/98, which withdrew subsidies. Because Regulations are not implemented in national law, but have direct effect, they argued the requirement for individual concern would deny them effective judicial protection. The Court of Justice held that direct actions were still not allowed: if this was unsatisfactory the member states would have to change the treaties. Individual concern is not needed, however under article 263(4), if an act is not legislation, but just a [...] "regulatory act". In Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami v Parliament and Council the Court of Justice affirmed that a Regulation does not count as a [...] "regulatory act" [...] within the Treaty's meaning: it is only meant for acts of lesser importance. Here, a Canadian group representing the Inuit people wished to challenge a Regulation on seal products, but were not allowed. They would have to show both direct and individual concern as normal. Thus, without a treaty change, EU administrative law remains one of the most restrictive in Europe.|$|E
