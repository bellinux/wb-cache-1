25|$|The <b>common</b> <b>house</b> <b>spider</b> (Parasteatoda tepidariorum), {{referred}} to internationally as the American house spider, is a spider {{species of the}} genus Parasteatoda that is mainly indigenous to the New World, with P. tepidariorum australis (common gray house spider) also encountered {{in some parts of}} Myanmar and Pakistan. American house spiders are synanthropic and build their tangled webs in or near human dwellings, often in secluded areas such as between loose walls and behind open doors and attic windows. Statistically, they are the most often encountered spider by humans in North America, and least likely to adopt defensive behavior in their vicinity. Their prey mechanism {{is similar to that of}} the other cobweb spiders: the spider follows disturbances transmitted along the web to entangle and then paralyze its prey, which usually consists of household insects and other invertebrates (often considered as pests).|$|E

40|$|SummaryDuring {{vertebrate}} embryogenesis, {{most of the}} mesodermal tissue posterior to {{the head}} forms from a progenitor population that continuously adds blocks of muscles (the somites) from {{the back end of}} the embryo. Recent work in less commonly studied arthropods — the flour beetle Tribolium and the <b>common</b> <b>house</b> <b>spider</b> — provides evidence suggesting that this posterior growth process might be evolutionarily conserved, with canonical Wnt signaling playing a key role in vertebrates and invertebrates. We discuss these findings as well as other evidence that suggests that the genetic network controlling posterior growth was already present in the last common ancestor of the Bilateria. We also highlight other interesting commonalities as well as differences between posterior growth in vertebrates and invertebrates, suggest future areas of research, and hypothesize that posterior growth may facilitate evolution of animal body plans...|$|E
40|$|Zinc finger {{transcription}} {{factors of}} the Sp 6 – 9 group are evolutionarily conserved in all metazoans and have important functions in, e. g., limb formation and heart development. The function of Sp 6 – 9 -related genes {{has been studied}} {{in a number of}} vertebrates and invertebrates, but data from chelicerates (spiders and allies) was lacking so far. We have isolated the ortholog of Sp 6 – 9 from the <b>common</b> <b>house</b> <b>spider</b> Parasteatoda tepidariorum and the cellar spider Pholcus phalangioides. We show that the Sp 6 – 9 gene in these spider species is expressed in the developing appendages thus suggesting a conserved role in limb formation. Indeed, RNAi with Sp 6 – 9 in P. tepidariorum leads not only to strong limb defects, but also to the loss of body segments and head defects in more strongly affected animals. Together with a new expression domain in the early embryo, these data suggest that Sp 6 – 9 has a dual role P. tepidariorum. The early role in head and body segment formation is not known from other arthropods, but the role in limb formation is evolutionarily highly conserved...|$|E
40|$|The {{duplication}} of genes can occur through various mechanisms and {{is thought to}} make a major contribution to the evolutionary diversification of organisms. There is increasing evidence for a large-scale {{duplication of}} genes in some chelicerate lineages including two rounds of whole genome duplication (WGD) in horseshoe crabs. To investigate this further we sequenced and analyzed the genome of the <b>common</b> <b>house</b> <b>spider</b> Parasteatoda tepidariorum. We found pervasive duplication of both coding and non-coding genes in this spider, including two clusters of Hox genes. Analysis of synteny conservation across the P. tepidariorum genome suggests that there has been an ancient WGD in spiders. Comparison with the genomes of other chelicerates, including that of the newly sequenced bark scorpion Centruroides sculpturatus, suggests that this event occurred in the common ancestor of spiders and scorpions and is probably independent of the WGDs in horseshoe crabs. Furthermore, characterization of the sequence and expression of the Hox paralogs in P. tepidariorum suggests that many have been subject to neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization since their duplication, and therefore {{may have contributed to the}} diversification of spiders and other pulmonate arachnids.

40|$|Abstract Background Spider silk {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{versatile}} materials in nature with great strength and flexibility. Native and synthetically produced silk has been used in a wide range of applications including the construction of artificial tendons and as substrates for human cell growth. In the literature there are anecdotal reports that suggest that native spider silk may also have antimicrobial properties. Findings In this study we compared the growth of a Gram positive and a Gram negative bacterium in the presence and absence of silk produced by the <b>common</b> <b>house</b> <b>spider</b> Tegenaria domestica. We demonstrate that native web silk of Tegenaria domestica can inhibit the growth of the Gram positive bacterium, Bacillus subtilis. No significant inhibition of growth was detected against the Gram negative bacterium, Escherichia coli. The antimicrobial effect against B. subtilis appears to be short lived thus the active agent potentially acts in a bacteriostatic rather than bactericidal manner. Treatment of the silk with Proteinase K appears to reduce the ability to inhibit bacterial growth. This is consistent with the active agent including a protein element that is denatured or cleaved by treatment. Tegenaria silk does not appear to inhibit the growth of mammalian cells in vitro thus there is the potential for therapeutic applications. </p...|$|E
40|$|SummaryThe Wnt genes encode {{secreted}} glycoprotein ligands {{that regulate}} many developmental processes from axis formation to tissue regeneration [1]. In bilaterians, {{there are at}} least 12 subfamilies of Wnt genes [2]. Wnt 3 and Wnt 8 are required for somitogenesis in vertebrates [3 – 7] and are thought to be involved in posterior specification in deuterostomes in general [8]. Although TCF and β-catenin have been implicated in the posterior patterning of some short-germ insects [9, 10], the specific Wnt ligands required for posterior specification in insects and other protostomes remained unknown. Here we investigated the function of Wnt 8 in a chelicerate, the <b>common</b> <b>house</b> <b>spider</b> Achaearanea tepidariorum [11]. Knockdown of Wnt 8 in Achaearanea via parental RNAi caused misregulation of Delta, hairy, twist, and caudal and resulted in failure to properly establish a posterior growth zone and truncation of the opisthosoma (abdomen). In embryos with the most severe phenotypes, the entire opisthosoma was missing. Our results suggest that in the spider, Wnt 8 is required for posterior development through the specification and maintenance of growth-zone cells. Furthermore, we propose that Wnt 8, caudal, and Delta/Notch may be parts of an ancient genetic regulatory network that could have been required for posterior specification in the last common ancestor of protostomes and deuterostomes...|$|E
40|$|The <b>common</b> <b>house</b> <b>spider,</b> Achaearanea tepidariorum, has a {{sensitive}} vibration receptor {{in each of}} its eight legs. The receptor {{has been shown to}} respond to air-borne sound as well as to direct vibration (Walcott & Van der Kloot, 1959). But for a spider on its web a more usual source of information about the outside world comes from vibrations of the web strands themselves. What is the response of the receptor to the vibrations of the web? Liesenfeld (1956, 1961) has described some of the pro-perties of spider webs and recorded the electrical response of the vibration receptors of a variety of species of spiders to vibrations of the substrate. Nowhere, however, can one find information on how vibrations of the web are translated by the spider's vibration receptor into electrical impulses in the sensory nerve. One of the striking characteristics of the spider's vibration receptor is its dramatic variation in sensitivity to closely adjacent frequencies of air-borne sound. It appears that the ten receptor units of which the sense organ is composed are tuned. The sharp-ness of this tuning is such that the threshold of the preparation may vary by as much as 1 db. as the frequency is changed 1 cyc. /sec. from 250 to 251 cyc. /sec. When the ti...|$|E
