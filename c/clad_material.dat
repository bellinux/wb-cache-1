The pressure is high enough to deform the metals and reduce the combined thickness of the <b>clad</b> <b>material.</b> Heat may be applied, especially when metals are not ductile enough. As an example of application, bonding of the sheets can be controlled by painting a pattern on one sheet; only the bare metal surfaces bond, and the un-bonded portion can be inflated if the sheet is heated and the coating vaporizes.

50|$|Roll bonding {{is a solid}} state, {{cold welding}} process, {{obtained}} through flat rolling of sheet metals. In roll bonding, two or more layers of different metals are passed through a pair of flat rollers under sufficient pressure to bond the layers. The pressure is high enough to deform the metals and reduce the combined thickness of the <b>clad</b> <b>material.</b> The mating surfaces must be previously prepared (scratched, cleaned, degreased) {{in order to increase}} their friction coefficient and remove any oxide layers.The process can be performed at room temperature or at warm conditions. In warm roll bonding, heat is applied to pre-heat the sheets just before rolling, in order to increase their ductility and improve the strength of the weld. The strength of the rolled bonds depends on the main process parameters, including the rolling conditions (entry temperature of the sheets, amount of thickness reduction, rolling speed, etc.), the pre-rolling treatment conditions (annealing temperature and time, surface preparation techniques, etc.) and the post-rolling heat treatments.|$|E

40|$|Many {{industries}} including automotive, aerospace, electronics, shipbuilding, offshore, railway {{and heavy}} equipment employ surface modification technologies {{to change the}} surface properties of a manufactured product. Often, the surface is covered (coated) with a dissimilar clad layer for this purpose and the lifetime expectancy of the manufactured product is improved. A new solid state cladding process for metals (Friction Surface Cladding, FSC) has been developed at the University of Twente. This process provides researchers and industrial practitioners of surface engineering with an alternative to existing surface modification technologies. The FSC process allows the deposition of <b>clad</b> <b>material</b> on a substrate through a hollow rotating tool in order to form thin clad layers at elevated temperatures. Elevated temperatures below the melting point occur because the heat generation of the process solely relies on interfacial friction and plastic deformation. This thesis is dedicated to delivering a proof of concept for the FSC process by developing an experimental setup which is able to deposit clad layers.
