5|$|For {{most of her}} career, U-16 {{operated}} in the Adriatic out of Kotor patrolling off the Albanian coast. The U-boat sank one small sailing ship in November and seized another in December. U-16 carried Field Marshal Svetozar Borojević of the Austro-Hungarian Army as an observer while performing diving tests after engine repairs in January 1916. A water leak in March flooded U-16s batteries and put the U-boat out of action for about six weeks of repairs. While operating off Vlorë in mid-October 1916, U-16 sank an Italian destroyer acting as a convoy escort. U-16 was sunk in the ensuing action, but sources are not <b>clear</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> exact cause of her sinking. In all U-16 sank three ships with a combined tonnage of 711. She was the only U-10-class submarine sunk during the war.|$|E
5|$|SM U-16 was {{constructed}} in Germany and shipped by rail to Pola where she was assembled and launched on 26 April 1915 and commissioned on 6 October. U-16 sank one ship in November 1915 and seized another in December.

5|$|The designers' {{goal was}} to create a visual bridge between comic and video game graphics. Gibbons drew the {{backgrounds}} in pencil, starting with roughs, which were sent to Revolution to see if they were technically feasible. Once agreed upon, Gibbons would then make the final sketch. The pencil sketches were then colored, mainly by Les Pace. The backgrounds were scanned on a Macintosh as 24-bit, 1000x1000 pixel images with 16 million colors, and then transformed to 8-bit, 320x200 pixel images with 256 colors for the PC version. The backgrounds were designed so that the sprites would appear <b>clear</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> screen and wouldn't mix with the backgrounds. Gibbons created the sprites using Deluxe Paint on an Amiga. Steve Ince, who joined the team in February 1993, created a number of sprite animations, also painting some backgrounds based on Gibbons's sketches. Gibbons also designed the characters, although he found it challenging to get a character's personality and expression in a face that was only around seven pixels wide and nine pixels high with a limited palette. He would have liked to design a character in a similar manner to Prince of Persia or Flashback, but Revolution wanted something more detailed, so the result became a compromise. All character sprites are smoothly animated with around 20 positions each. According to Gibbons, about 75% of the backgrounds and characters he designed were used in the game.|$|E

25|$|The lack of {{resistance}} to the wider sweep of the ROK 1st Division's advance confirmed that the bid to block and attack the North Korean I Corps had been futile.

25|$|As I {{testified to}} the U.S. Senate in 1998, Iraq has the {{indigenous}} capability right now to reconstitute a chemical weapons program {{within a matter of}} weeks.

But at some point, I believe that Iraq will seek to reconstitute militarized nerve agent that will be used in defense of Baghdad. And I think the Iraqi government's efforts to acquire significant stockpiles of atropine are an indication that this is the direction that Saddam Hussein is heading.|$|E

25|$|The Puranas are <b>clear</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Kshatriya {{lineage of}} Chandragupta Maurya.

The Vishnu Purana also mentions King Moru, who would reestablish kshatriya rule in India by destroying the shudra Nanda. The Vayu Purana states that the Yuga Morya dynasty would restore the Suryavansha in India and be followed by the Shunga Empire. The medieval commentator Ratnagarbha, in his commentary on the Vishnu Purana, concludes that Chandragupta {{is the son of}} a Nanda emperor. However, the Vishnu Purana maintains that Chandragupta has link to the Nanda kings; a militant Brahmin (Chanakya) would protect dharma (religion), uprooting the Shudra Nanda {{with the help of a}} royal man(Chandragupta) with a claim to be emperor of India.|$|E
25|$|The third game in {{the group}} stage was the home match against Belenenses. Basel took an early lead after 15 minutes, Matías Delgado kicked an inswinging corner to the back post from the left and Michael Lang jumped highest to power his header into the goal from five metres. Belenenses leveled after 27 minutes with their first chance. A long ball forward was headed clear by Marek Suchý, but it dropped to Luís Leal, who was 25 metres from goal. He {{hammered}} a low volley into the bottom corner and the ball bounced to evade the dive of Germano Vailati. During the extra {{time of the first}} half, Leal ran <b>clear</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right flank, rushed into the area, playing the ball across the face of goal to Kuca Miranda who had easyest of finishes, tapping in from just three metres. During the second half, Basel played forward non-stop but were unable to score the equalizer. Until this 1–2 defeat, Basel had been unbeaten this season, in the domestic league (nine games) and in Europe (six).|$|E
25|$|A {{far more}} {{comprehensive}} approbation {{was given by}} Rabbi Aaron Chorin of Arad. Chorin was a well-known maverick; Samet noted that unlike many colleagues who harbored maskilic sympathies, he did not keep his to himself. Since a rabbinic tribunal had him recant in 1806, under the pain of being declared a heretic and have his beard shaved, he clashed repeatedly with other decisors, adopting glaringly lenient positions. His only patron was Rabbi Moses Münz of Óbuda. When hearing of Liebermann's lettres, Münz warned Chorin to steer clear from the controversy, yet the latter ignored him. The rabbi of Arad composed a long, enthusiastic responsa, in which he fervently supported reform efforts, stating that he long regarded the noise and disorder in synagogues a great ill. While recommending they teach their sons the Holy Tongue, he noted that legal sources were quite <b>clear</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> permissibility of vernacular liturgy. He also allowed Sephardi pronunciation and separate prayer gatherings. Regarding the organ, he cited the same arguments that Samun and Recanati evoked. He also turned to two minority opinions mentioned in Orach Chayim 338:2 and 339:3, that sanctioned music on the Sabbath.|$|E

25|$|Not {{long after}} {{declaring that the}} fight was off, Arum {{had a change of}} heart and offered Mayweather a 24-hour take-it-or-leave-it {{deadline}} to accept Team Pacquiao's terms for drug testing. Top Rank sent out a press release explaining their position on Mayweather's request for random Olympic-style drug testing. In it, Arum said Pacquiao was willing to submit to as many random urine tests requested, but as far as random blood tests were concerned, he was only willing to subject himself to 3 tests—one in January, one 30 days from the bout (no later than February 13) and one immediately after the fight: Let's be very <b>clear</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> real issues we differ on. It's not about being tested....It's about who does the testing and the scheduling of the procedures....The major issue related to the testing rests with which independent agency will administer these tests. The United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) cannot do it because they will not amend its procedures to accommodate the blood testing schedule we have outlined. USADA, under its guidelines, would have the right to administer random blood tests as many times as they want up to weigh-in day and that is ludicrous.|$|E
25|$|On 13 November, Saint-Cyr's host {{stumbled}} into Vidreres which {{was near the}} coast road that led to Malgrat de Mar, Mataró, and Barcelona. That evening the Imperial soldiers saw the campfires of Lazán {{to the north and}} other enemy campfires to the south. But Saint-Cyr knew of a secret path from a Perpignan smuggler; the route connected the coast road with the inland road. Several search parties that were sent out to find the path during the 14th failed to locate it, so Saint-Cyr personally set out with a small escort to find it. In this he was successful, though the group was nearly captured by guerillas and had to fight its way <b>clear.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> 15th the entire Franco-Italian army snaked through the hills, bypassing the small fortress of Hostalric and reaching the inland road at Sant Celoni. At the latter place the Imperial troops scattered a force of miquelets under Milans. Though his men were tired, Saint-Cyr hustled his soldiers along the highway until they reached the dangerous Trentapassos defile which was found to be unoccupied. That evening the Franco-Italians could see a line of campfires ahead of them, indicating the presence of the Spanish army.|$|E
500|$|However, others {{noted that}} if Disney had {{attempted}} to block the film's release, it was unclear on what legal grounds it could be done.
