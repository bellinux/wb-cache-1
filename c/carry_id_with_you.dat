40|$|Abstract—Ensemble {{learning}} is a commonly used tool for building prediction models from data streams, due to its intrinsic merits of handling large volumes stream data. Despite of its extraordinary successes in stream data mining, existing ensemble models, in stream data environments, mainly fall into the ensemble classifiers category, without realizing that building classifiers requires labor intensive labeling process, and it {{is often the case}} that we may have a small number of labeled samples to train a few classifiers, but a large number of unlabeled samples are available to build clusters from data streams. Accordingly, in this paper, we propose a new ensemble model which combines both classifiers and clusters together for mining data streams. We argue that the main challenges of this new ensemble model include (1) clusters formulated from data streams only <b>carry</b> cluster <b>IDs,</b> <b>with</b> no genuine class label information, and (2) concept drifting underlying data streams makes it even harder to combine clusters and classifiers into one ensemble framework. To handle challenge (1), we present a label propagation method to infer each cluster’s class label by making full use of both class label information from classifiers, and internal structure information from clusters. To handle challenge (2), we present a new weighting schema to weight all base models according to their consistencies with the up-to-date base model. As a result, all classifiers and clusters can be combined together, through a weighted average mechanism, for prediction. Experiments on real-world data streams demonstrate that our method outperforms simple classifier ensemble and cluster ensemble for stream data mining...|$|R
30|$|Abstracting {{the user}} {{experience}} from {{the device is}} a need so that it persists between the user and virtual or real computing platforms, across many devices, such as, smart phones and tablets, google glasses and many more to follow in near future. This could be done using a Digital Persona which may be a special simcard or a chip that <b>carries</b> the Digital <b>ID</b> for the mobile authentication of each person in a device similar to a USB stick. Persona is a term used in Jungian psychology. It refers to a personal façade that one presents to the world. In drama, persona refers to an actor’s portrayal of someone in a play. In February 2014, a Digital Persona of this kind, a mobile Fingerprint scanner that holds the capacity to <b>carry</b> a Mobile <b>ID</b> <b>with</b> a Silicon Fingerprint Sensor was released {{under the name of}} Touch CHIP TCS 1 sensor [20]. TCET module in this device provides a self-contained biometric matching system for all skin types, and it is compatible with ISO and ANSI standards. It would be interesting to use this device not only for biometric matching, but also for detecting psycho-physiological characteristics of a person. Perhaps, in the next decade, HCI will have a more mind-centric or x-centric focus with the novel ideas to personate our interaction with the technology, and in the following decade this person-ation may create a x-centric focus.|$|R

40|$|Background: Intellectual {{disability}} (ID) {{is frequently}} associated with sleep disorders. Treatment with melatonin demonstrated efficacy, suggesting that, {{at least in}} a subgroup of patients, the endogenous melatonin level may not be sufficient to adequately set the sleep-wake cycles.

Methods: Here, we sequenced all exons of ASMT in a sample of 361 patients <b>with</b> <b>ID</b> and 440 controls. We then measured the ASMT activity in B lymphoblastoid cell lines (BLCL) of patients <b>with</b> <b>ID</b> <b>carrying</b> an ASMT variant and compared it to controls.
