5|$|Blacklist pre-release {{reception}} {{was generally}} positive, despite <b>criticism</b> {{of its new}} voice actor. The game received generally positive reviews when it was released, with praise for its level design, story, gameplay, combat, soundtrack and multiplayer mode. However, <b>criticism</b> was directed at its dated graphics, lack of challenge and ending. It failed to meet Ubisoft's sales expectations, with sales of two million copies three months after its release.|$|E
50|$|The <b>criticisms</b> of {{traditional}} Judaism included <b>criticisms</b> {{asserting that the}} Torah's laws are not strictly binding; <b>criticisms</b> asserting that many ceremonies and rituals are not necessary; <b>criticisms</b> asserting that Rabbinical leadership is too authoritarian; <b>criticisms</b> asserting that {{there was too much}} superstition; <b>criticisms</b> asserting that traditional Judaism leads to isolation from other communities; and <b>criticisms</b> asserting that traditional Judaism over-emphasized the exile.|$|R
30|$|The {{procedure}} for evaluating and mapping <b>criticisms</b> involves three stages. First, a literature review to identify <b>criticisms.</b> Second, an examination and classification of the <b>criticisms.</b> Third, identifying and mapping {{the connections between}} <b>criticisms.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Criticisms</b> of anarchism include moral <b>criticisms</b> {{and pragmatic}} <b>criticisms.</b> Anarchism is often {{evaluated}} as unfeasible or utopian by its critics.|$|R

5|$|<b>Criticism</b> of the MPC has {{centred on}} its {{predominant}} focus on inflation {{to the detriment}} of growth and employment, although that <b>criticism</b> may have been mitigated by the March 2013 revisions to the committee's remit. There have also been complaints about the reluctance of lenders to pass on rate changes, and {{about the extent to which}} the introduction and management of QE have risked politicising the committee.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Criticisms</b> of anarcho-capitalism include moral <b>criticisms,</b> pragmatic <b>criticisms,</b> the {{argument}} that anarcho-capitalism could not be maintained, and {{the argument}} that capitalism and anarchism are societally mutually exclusive.|$|R
25|$|There are two {{distinct}} forms of <b>criticisms</b> of the liturgical reform: <b>criticisms</b> {{of the text}} of the revised Missal and <b>criticisms</b> of ways in which the rite has been celebrated in practice.|$|R
30|$|The {{following}} sections present the <b>criticisms</b> identified from the literature. In each hierarchical tier the <b>criticisms</b> are grouped, discussed, any antecedent and subsequent <b>criticisms</b> identified, and presented in diagrammatic and tabular form.|$|R

5|$|Founded in 1961 {{under the}} auspices of Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism, the Columbia Journalism Review (CJR) {{examines}} day-to-day press performance as well as the forces that affect that performance.

CJR.org, its web site, delivers real-time <b>criticism</b> and reporting, giving CJR a presence in the ongoing conversation about the media.|$|E
5|$|From {{early in}} the {{development}} of attachment theory there was <b>criticism</b> of the theory's lack of congruence with various branches of psychoanalysis. Bowlby's decisions left him open to <b>criticism</b> from well-established thinkers working on similar problems.|$|E

30|$|The {{preceding}} sections {{illustrate how}} 28 <b>criticisms</b> of Alexander’s second theory of architecture can be categorised hierarchically, formed into thematic groups, and their relationships mapped {{to reveal that}} many issues affecting {{the development and implementation}} of the theory can be connected to Alexander’s idiosyncratic ontological and epistemological positions. For instance, 12 <b>criticisms</b> [10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22] (43 %) are directly connected to high level ontological problems [1, 2, 3] and a further 5 <b>criticisms</b> [23, 24, 25, 26, 27] (18 %) are directly connected to these secondary problems. Furthermore, 10 <b>criticisms</b> [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 18] (36 %) are directly connected to Alexander’s epistemology [4] and a further 4 <b>criticisms</b> [23, 24, 25, 27] (14 %) are directly connected to these secondary <b>criticisms.</b> Surprisingly, only 2 <b>criticisms</b> [14, 28] (7 %) relate directly to the pattern language concept rather than <b>criticisms</b> of Alexander’s ontological and epistemological positions, and these <b>criticisms</b> are amongst the more speculative.|$|R

5|$|In October 2009, {{eleven of}} the local councillors {{resigned}} en masse, citing excessive <b>criticism</b> from local residents and in particular <b>criticism</b> from a hostile local weblog. In February 2012 the External Auditor appointed by the Audit Commission published a critical Report in the Public Interest regarding the activities of Somerton Town Council {{in the fiscal year}} 2008 to 2009.|$|E
5|$|In his {{biography}} of Hick, David Cheetham notes a <b>criticism</b> of Hick's theory: waiting for eschatological verification could make religious belief provisional, preventing total commitment to faith. Cheetham argues that such <b>criticism</b> is misapplied because Hick's theory was not directed to religious believers but to philosophers, {{who argued that}} religion is unverifiable and therefore meaningless.|$|E
50|$|MTV Latin America, {{like other}} MTV {{channels}} around the world, {{has been one}} of the first television channels to receive <b>criticisms,</b> largely from their own viewers. While many <b>criticisms</b> apply to MTV as a whole, some <b>criticisms</b> apply specifically to MTV Latin America. One reason for these <b>criticisms</b> is that certain videos and reality shows on MTV Latin America are not censored.|$|R
50|$|While in {{many ways}} the <b>criticisms</b> of eco-socialism combine the {{traditional}} <b>criticisms</b> of both socialism and Green politics, there are unique critiques of eco-socialism, which are largely from within the traditional Socialist or Green movements themselves, along with conservative <b>criticisms.</b>|$|R
30|$|Within each {{hierarchical}} tier, <b>criticisms</b> are {{organised into}} thematic groupings representing broader concepts intended to facilitate discussion and understanding. These groupings also emerge organically from {{the examination of}} the individual <b>criticisms.</b> For example the ‘scholarship’ group includes <b>criticisms</b> which together may facilitate a discussion about scholarly writing quality in the context of Alexander’s second theory. In this way, mapping and classifying the <b>criticisms</b> of Alexander’s theory provides greater understanding of the theory.|$|R

5|$|Referring {{to the two}} ontological {{arguments}} {{proposed by}} Anselm in Chapters 2 and 3 of his Proslogion, Malcolm supported Kant's <b>criticism</b> of Anselm's argument in Chapter 2: that existence cannot be a perfection of something.

5|$|Several bestowals of {{the award}} have met with <b>criticism.</b> The posthumous award for M. G.

5|$|The tantra {{practices}} are secretive, subject to speculations and <b>criticism.</b> Scholars variously attribute such <b>criticism</b> to ignorance, misunderstanding or sectarian bias {{on the part}} of some observers, as well as unscrupulous practices by some Shaktas.
