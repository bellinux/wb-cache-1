40|$|AbstractToxins A and B {{from the}} {{anaerobic}} bacterium Clostridium difficile are the causative {{agents of the}} antibiotic-associated pseudomembraneous colitis. At the subcellular level, they inhibit the Rho family GTPases, thus <b>causing</b> <b>alterations</b> <b>of</b> the actin cytoskeleton. The cytoskeletal integrity is also controlled by the redox state of cells. Therefore, we have evaluated whether an oxidative imbalance could {{be involved in the}} toxin-induced cytopathic effects. Our results indicate that both toxins induce oxidative stress with a significant depletion of protein SH-groups. These responses and the cytoskeleton-dependent cell retraction and rounding are significantly counteracted by N-acetylcysteine but not by α-tocopherol. Our study provides the first evidence that the thiol supplier N-acetylcysteine impairs the cellular intoxication by acting on the cytoskeleton integrity. This also suggests a possible beneficial role for this drug during therapeutic intervention...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{generation}} of advanced glycation end-products (AGE), the interaction with their receptors, the {{generation of}} reactive oxygen species, and the modulation of intracellular redox equilibrium {{are believed to be}} the main factors <b>causing</b> <b>alterations</b> <b>of</b> mesangial cell physiology leading to diabetic nephropathy. Normal human primary mesangial cells were exposed to glycoxidative stress by culture in high glucose (HG) or treatment with AGE for up to 6 days. In both cases only a moderate generation of reactive oxygen species and production of HNE-protein adducts were induced while protein nitrotyrosination was not affected. Moreover, HG and AGE caused a significant antioxidant response, confirmed by the induction of heme oxygenase 1 and the consumption of vitamin E. Glutathione was decreased only by HG. Mesangial cell proliferation and viability were slightly affected by HG and AGE. Furthermore, both treatments failed to influence TGF-ß 1 and MCP- 1 secretion and to modulate RAGE and collagen IV expression. We believe that normal human mesangial cells can resist glycoxidative stress by the observed antioxidant response. These results support the concept that mesangial cells are only partly responsible for the onset and progression of diabetic nephropathy and that the role of other cell types, such as podocytes and endothelial cells, should be taken into consideration...|$|E
40|$|Rationale: Hyperamylinemia {{is common}} in {{patients}} with obesity and insulin resistance, coincides with hyperin-sulinemia, and results in amyloid deposition. Amylin amyloids are generally considered a pancreatic disorder in type 2 diabetes. However, elevated circulating levels of amylin may also lead to amylin accumulation and proteotoxicity in peripheral organs, including the heart. Objective: To test whether amylin accumulates {{in the heart of}} obese and type 2 diabetic patients and to uncover the effects of amylin accumulation on cardiac morphology and function. Methods and Results: We compared amylin deposition in failing and nonfailing hearts from lean, obese, and type 2 diabetic humans using immunohistochemistry and Western blots. We found significant accumulation of large amylin oligomers, fibrils, and plaques in failing hearts from obese and diabetic patients but not in normal hearts and failing hearts from lean, nondiabetic humans. Small amylin oligomers were even elevated in nonfailing hearts from overweight/obese patients, suggesting an early state of accumulation. Using a rat model of hyperamylinemia transgenic for human amylin, we observed that amylin oligomers attach to the sarcolemma, leading to myocyte Ca 2 dysregulation, pathological myocyte remodeling, and diastolic dysfunction, starting from prediabetes. In contrast, prediabetic rats expressing the same level of wild-type rat amylin, a nonamy-loidogenic isoform, exhibited normal heart structure and function. Conclusions: Hyperamylinemia promotes amylin deposition in the heart, <b>causing</b> <b>alterations</b> <b>of</b> cardiac myocyte structure and function. We propose that detection and disruption of cardiac amylin buildup may be both a predictor of heart dysfunction and a novel therapeutic strategy in diabetic cardiomyopathy. (Cir...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Understanding how {{inflammation}} causes neuronal {{damage is}} {{of paramount importance}} in multiple sclerosis (MS) and in other neurodegenerative diseases. Here we addressed the role of the apoptotic cascade in the synaptic abnormalities and neuronal loss caused by the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin- 1 β (IL- 1 β) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) in brain tissues, and disease progression caused by inflammation in relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients. RESULTS: The effect of IL- 1 β, but not of TNF-α, on glutamate-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents was blocked by pifithrin-α (PFT), inhibitor of p 53. The protein kinase C (PKC) /transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV 1) pathway was involved in IL- 1 β-p 53 interaction at glutamatergic synapses, as pharmacological modulation of this inflammation-relevant molecular pathway affected PFT effects on the synaptic action of IL- 1 β. IL- 1 β-induced neuronal swelling was also blocked by PFT, and IL- 1 β increased the expression of p 21, a canonical downstream target of activated p 53. Consistent with these in vitro results, the Pro/Pro genotype of p 53, associated with low efficiency of transcription of p 53 -regulated genes, abrogated the association between IL- 1 β cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels and disability progression in RRMS patients. The interaction between p 53 and CSF IL- 1 β was also evaluated at the optical coherence tomography (OCT), showing that IL- 1 β-driven neurodegenerative damage, <b>causing</b> <b>alterations</b> <b>of</b> macular volume and of retinal nerve fibre layer thickness, was modulated by the p 53 genotype. CONCLUSIONS: Inflammatory synaptopathy and neurodegeneration caused by IL- 1 β in RRMS patients involve the apoptotic cascade. Targeting IL- 1 β-p 53 interaction might result in significant neuroprotection in MS...|$|E
40|$|A {{potential}} {{serious side}} effect of drugs is cardiotoxicity which can result in lethal heart arrhythmias. Cardiotoxicity has been {{the leading cause of}} drug withdrawals from the market in the past decades, and has been responsible for costly failures in late stage clinical trials. This highlights the unmet need in the pharmaceutical industry for more accurate and predicative cardiotoxicity screening assays. An important indication for drug-induced proarrhythmic cardiotoxicity is the prolongation of the action potential duration of the cardiomyocytes. The prolongation of the action potential duration can be detected in vitro through field potential measurements from cardiomyocytes cultured on Micro-Electrode Arrays (MEAs) when they are subjected to drug compounds. MEAs are normally fabricated on rigid substrates which precludes mechanical stretching and contraction of the cultured cardiomyocytes as it happens in vivo during diastole and systole of the heart. It has been demonstrated in the literature that cardiomyocytes can sense mechanical stretching and adapt their electrical and mechanical responses to it, through mechano-electric coupling phenomena, <b>causing</b> <b>alterations</b> <b>of</b> the action potential shape, duration, and rhythm. Including physiologically relevant mechanical loading of cardiomyocytes in the in vitro model, can lead to potentially more predictive screening results. In this thesis the design, fabrication and characterization of a novel platform for in vitro electrophysiological measurements is presented which allows for in situ mechanical loading of cardiomyocytes. The platform is based on pneumatically actuated Stretchable Micro-Electrode Array (SMEA) chips which are fabricated using state of the art silicon micro-fabrication technology. The main technological challenges addressed in this thesis were the mechanical design of the electrical interconnects for the stretchable devices, {{and the development of a}} manufacturable micro-fabrication technology to enable high volume production of the SMEA chips. The electrochemical and electromechanical characterization of the chips is presented, together with proof of concept field potential measurements from human stem cell derived cardiomyocytes under cyclic mechanical loading.

40|$|The {{community}} of Ferryland {{is located on}} the southeastern coast of the Avalon Peninsula. The town traditionally relied on a fishing-based economy until the collapse of the fishery in the early 1990 s. The present economy emphasizes sustainable development in the tourism sector with focus on archaeology, geotourism and other recreational uses. This paper discusses coastal erosion and impacts on sites and infrastructure using methods including: local knowledge, Real Time Kinematic (RTK) surveying and other survey techniques, seawater level measurement, meteorological data from a locally-installed station, custom-made drifter tube buoys, photography, HD video, and investigation using various modes of transport including inflatable boat. The major findings of the study include that the residents and stakeholders are genuinely interested in and knowledgeable of coastal erosion. The causes of coastal erosion include: large waves, surge, longshore currents, harbour oscillations, mass wasting, and location of infrastructure <b>causing</b> <b>alterations</b> <b>of</b> these processes. Freeze-thaw Cycles (FTC), rainfall, and gravity loosen and transport rock, till, and fill materials downslope. Large waves and currents transport the materials alongshore or into the nearshore. Harbour oscillations causing high velocity currents (> 2 m/s) are responsible for shoreline erosion and damage to property in The Pool. Historical resources such as gun batteries and ordnance pieces which date to the 1700 s are being lost or threatened through coastal erosion of till and rock cliffs. Improper drainage and maintenance is responsible for erosion of roads and supporting shoulders, necessitating mitigation measures. Sediment transport and deposition during and after large wave and surge events lead to undercutting of infrastructure and increased risk of washover of existing infrastructure. Erosion is ongoing at Bois Island and Ferryland Head Isthmus through slope processes and undercutting; The Pool and the lower Colony of Avalon site through harbour oscillations and related undermining; the tombolo and the main breakwater through wave attack; and Meade’s Cove including the East Coast Trail through wave attack and undercutting. The floor of the latrine in the lower Colony of Avalon site indicates that sea level was approximately 1. 25 m below present in the 1620 s, a relative sea level rise rate of 3. 2 mm/y.
