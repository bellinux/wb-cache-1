500|$|The Great Comet of 1843 {{was first}} noticed in early February of that year, just over {{three weeks before}} its {{perihelion}} passage. By February 27 it was easily visible in the daytime sky, and observers described seeing a tail 2–3° long stretching away from the Sun before being lost {{in the glare of}} the sky. After its perihelion passage, it reappeared in the morning sky, and developed an extremely long tail. [...] It extended about 45° across the sky on March 11 and was more than 2° wide; the tail was calculated to be more than 300 million kilometers (2AU) long. [...] This held the record for the longest measured <b>cometary</b> <b>tail</b> until 2000, when Comet Hyakutake's tail was found to stretch to some 550 million kilometers in length.

40|$|A new {{mechanism}} {{for the formation of}} <b>cometary</b> <b>tails</b> behind dense clouds or globules is discussed. Numerical hydrodynamical models show that when a dense shell of swept-up matter overruns a cloud, material in the shell is focussed behind the cloud to form a tail. This mode of tail formation is completely distinct from other methods, which involve either the removal of material from the cloud, or shadowing from a strong, nearby source of ionization. This mechanism is relevant to the <b>cometary</b> <b>tails</b> seen in planetary nebulae and to the interaction of superbubble shells with dense clouds.

40|$|The {{characterization}} of the particle size distribution in <b>cometary</b> <b>tails</b> is considered. The particle-size related distribution function of the acceleration exerted on the cometary particle by solar radiation pressure used by Finson and Probstein (1968) is introduced, and distribution functions observed for the comets Arend-Roland 1957 III, Bennett 1970 II and Seki-Lines 1962 III are illustrated. It is pointed out that although the distribution functions have features in common, the rate of decrease of the distribution towards zero acceleration (large particles) is not well determined. An approximation for the size distribution in this range obtained from a photometric study of anomalous <b>cometary</b> <b>tails</b> is presented, and used to formulate an a priori distribution law {{which can be used}} to approximate all types of expected distributions by varying three key parameters...|$|R

50|$|Elst-Pizarro was {{reported}} in 1979 as minor planet , with its image on a photographic plate being completely stellar in appearance. Its orbit remains entirely within the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, with eccentricity 0.165, typical of a minor planet in the asteroid belt. However, the images taken by Eric W. Elst and Guido Pizarro in 1996, when it was near perihelion, clearly show a <b>cometary</b> <b>tail.</b> Since this is not normal behaviour for asteroids, it is suspected that Elst-Pizarro has a different, probably icy, composition. The cometary nature of Elst-Pizarro was first discovered when a linear dust feature was observed with the ESO 1-metre Schmidt telescope at La Silla Observatory on 7 August 1996.|$|E

Right-hand polarized cyclotron waves are made unstable by the presence of ion beams. The <b>cometary</b> <b>tail</b> ions are accelerated mainly during the reduced-growth phase of the instability.

Comet ISON showed a well-developed plasma tail (longer than 2. 98 × 107 km) before its perihelion passage on November 28. We iden-tified a radio source whose line-of-sight approached the ISON’s plasma tail {{in the above}} period and obtained its IPS data using the Solar Wind Imaging Facility at 327 MHz.

40|$|We present multiwavelength, {{ground-based}} follow-up photometry of {{the white}} dwarf WD 1145 + 017, which has recently been suggested to be orbited by up to six or more short-period, low-mass, disintegrating planetesimals. We detect nine significant dips in flux of between 10 % and 30 % of the stellar flux in our ~ 32 hr of photometry, suggesting that WD 1145 + 017 is indeed being orbited by multiple, short-period objects. Through fits to the asymmetric transits that we observe, we confirm that the transit egress is usually longer than the ingress, and that the transit duration is longer than expected for a solid body at these short periods, all suggesting that these objects have <b>cometary</b> <b>tails</b> streaming behind them. The precise orbital periods of the planetesimals are unclear, {{but at least one}} object, and likely more, have orbital periods of ~ 4. 5 hr. We are otherwise unable to confirm the specific periods that have been reported, bringing into question the long-term stability of these periods. Our high-precision photometry also displays low-amplitude variations, suggesting that dusty material is consistently passing in front {{of the white}} dwarf, either from discarded material from these disintegrating planetesimals or from the detected dusty debris disk. We compare the transit depths in the V- and R-bands of our multiwavelength photometry, and find no significant difference; therefore, for likely compositions, the radius of single-size particles in the <b>cometary</b> <b>tails</b> streaming behind the planetesimals must be ~ 0. 15 μm or larger, or ~ 0. 06 μm or smaller, with 2 σ confidence...|$|R
40|$|Abstract – We {{investigate}} the physical properties of solar wind interaction with comet Hale Bopp, taking a rectangular numerical solution of MHD Equations.

Our results excluded the pressure and energy results where it was shown that interaction near the cometary nucleus is mainly affected by the new ions added to the plasma of the solar wind, which increased the average molecular weight. When this effect was taken under careful consideration, some characteristics of the <b>cometary</b> <b>tail</b> could be driven {{in the presence of}} the IMF.

Intense plasma flow simulating the solar wind interacts with another light-emitting plasma composed of Ba, Sr, and/or C by a plasma emitter which simulates a cometary coma. The purposes of this experiment are to investigate how the solar wind parameters contribute {{to the formation of}} the cometary ion tail and to determine the magnetic field structure of a comet.
