50|$|A scrip issue, {{also known}} as <b>capitalisation</b> <b>issue</b> or bonus issue, {{is a form of}} {{secondary}} issue where a company's cash reserves are converted into new shares and given to existing shareholders, or an issue of additional shares to shareholders in proportion to the shares already held. In the United Kingdom, public limited companies, those listed on the London Stock Exchange, have a number of ways to create new shares. A scrip issue is the process of creating new shares which are given free of charge to existing shareholders. To the individual investor, this is known as a scrip dividend. This would normally be done in place of paying a dividend.|$|E

ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Scrip {{dividends}} {{have become}} increasingly popular in South Africa SInce the introduction of secondary tax on companies (STC) in the 1993 budget. There {{is more than one}} approach to the treatment of scrip dividend schemes for accounting purposes, i. e. the reinvestment approach and the <b>capitalisation</b> <b>issue</b> approach. Unfortunately guidance {{in the form of a}} statement or guideline from the South African Institute of Chartered Accountants has not been forthcoming. Companies in the United States of America account for stock dividends (capitalisation issues) in a variety of ways and several studies have analysed the effect of these accounting treatments on retained earnings and the retained earnings hypothesis. Several empirical studies in the United States of America and the United Kingdom have documented marked differences in the ability of companies in these countries to make distributions to shareholders. For this reason the accounting treatment of stock dividends and scrip dividends in these countries was examined and compared to the methods used in South Africa. Earnings per share is often used by financial analysts to analyse and compare companies. The methods used in South Africa to account for scrip dividends result in different calculations of earnings per share and therefore the effect of the different methods was examined. This study concludes that the reinvestment approach is theoretically the most acceptable accounting treatment of scrip dividend schemes In South Africa. A representative sample of companies which declared scrip dividends in the period 1993 to 1999 was selected to determine how these schemes are implemented in the South African economy. These companies' financial statements were analysed to determine if the scrip dividend schemes were treated in terms of the accounting method proposed in this study and if the necessary information was disclosed in the financial statements. This study finds that different accounting approaches are used in South Africa, that earnings per share and secondary tax on companies are not calculated consistently for accounting purposes and that the information disclosed to the users of the financial statements differs from company to company. It is recommended that the South African Institute of Chartered Accountants issue accounting guidelines to the drafters of financial statements regarding scrip dividend schemes. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Die verklaring van skripdividende het in Suid-Afrika in gewildheid begin toeneem met die inwerkingstelling van sekondere belasting op maatskappye (SBM) in die 1993 -begroting. Daar is meer as een metode om skripdividendskemas rekeningkundig te verantwoord, naamlik die herbeleggingsbenadering en die kapitalisasieuitgiftebenadering. Die Suid-Afrikaanse Instituut vir Geoktrooieerde Rekenmeesters het egter op hierdie stadium nog nie 'n rekeningkundige standpunt of riglyn oor die rekeningkundige verantwoording van skripdividendskemas uitgereik nie. In die Verenigde State van Amerika kan maatskappye kapitalisasie-uitgifte op verskillende maniere rekeningkundig verantwoord en verskeie studies het die invloed ondersoek wat hierdie metodes op verdeelbare reserwes en die behoue wins-hipotese het. Verder het studies wat in die Verenigde State van Amerika en die Verenige Koningkryk gedoen is, bevind dat hierdie lande se beperkings op verdelings aan aandeelhouers baie van mekaar verskil en om die rede is die metodes wat in die lande toegepas word om kapitalisasie-uitgifte en skripdividendskemas rekeningkundig te verantwoord, ondersoek en met die metodes vergelyk wat in Suid-Afrika toegepas kan word. Aangesien verdienste per aandeel dikwels deur finansiele ontleders gebruik word om maatskappye te ontleed en met mekaar te vergelyk en omdat die metodes wat in Suid- Afrika toegepas kan word verskillende berekeninge van verdienste per aandeel tot gevoIg het, is die uitwerking wat die verskillende metodes op die berekening van verdienste per aandeeI het ook ontleed...|$|E

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the dynamic {{relationship}} between inward FDI and {{economic growth in the}} coastal region of China. Three sets of empirical models are developed to examine the two main hypotheses of FDI-led growth and growth-driven FDI, as well as the crowding in effect, which are based on a sample of 9 provinces panel data during 1995 and 2007 (117 observations). By using the fixed effects estimation, the results confirm essential findings of earlier studies on the positive nexus of FDI and economic growth and provincial heterogeneity across the coastal region of China. However, the interaction term of FDI and human capital is disapproved in the study, in spite of schooling factor yielding favourable values. In addition, empirical results suggest that FDI is an important vehicle for inducing domestic investment instead of detracting it. Finally, constructive recommendations for the local government and multinational enterprises are provided on the basis of findings and risk <b>capitalisation</b> <b>issues...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the use of}} a Dynamic Financial Analysis (DFA) model to answer questions on capitalisation, business and asset strategy {{in the case of a}} US P&C insurer, in the framework of maximising stockholder wealth. We measure this wealth by applying a risk measure on the individual stochastic cash flows from the DFA model, in preference to. more conventional approaches based, for example, on historic betas The risk translates into value by two mechanisms: 1. For systematic risk, we use a multiple-factor arbitrage-free pricing approach. This is calibrated to be consistent with the prices that our stochastic macroeconomic model generates. We implement these ideas using explicit deflator processes. 2. Both systematic and non-systematic risks generate frictional costs, which we model explicitly. These costs are of vital importance to insurance, yet are often overlooked in DFA analysis. We allocate these frictional costs back to each simulation so as to produce realistic, rather than idealistic, financial statements which then enable us to look at <b>capitalisation</b> <b>issues</b> as well as valuation ones. Our approach to risk definition is consistent with the recent findings of the CAS Risk Premiu...|$|R
5000|$|Although the {{calculation}} {{starts with a}} sum of the market capitalisation of the constituent stocks, it's intended to reflect changes in share price, NOT market capitalisation. Therefore, a fudge factor called the [...] "Divisor" [...] is used {{to ensure that the}} index value only changes when stock prices change, not whenever market capitalisation changes. For example, if a company increases its market <b>capitalisation</b> by <b>issuing</b> new shares, the Divisor is adjusted so that the ASX 200 index value does not change.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} vexing issues for analysts and {{managers}} of property companies across Europe has been the existence and persistence of deviations of Net Asset Values of property companies from their market <b>capitalisation.</b> The <b>issue</b> has clear links to similar discounts and premiums in closed-end funds. The closed end fund puzzle is regarded as an important unsolved problem in financial economics undermining theories of market efficiency and the Law of One Price. Consequently, it has generated a huge body of research. Although it can be tempting {{to focus on the}} particular inefficiencies of real estate markets in attempting to explain deviations from NAV, the closed end fund discount puzzle indicates that divergences between underlying asset values and market capitalisation are not a ‘pure’ real estate phenomenon. When examining potential explanations, two recurring factors stand out in the closed end fund literature as often undermining the economic rationale for a discount – the existence of premiums and cross-sectional and periodic fluctuations in the level of discount/premium. These need to be borne in mind when considering potential explanations for real estate markets. There are two approaches to investigating the discount to net asset value in closed-end funds: the ‘rational’ approach and the ‘noise trader’ or ‘sentiment’ approach. The ‘rational’ approach hypothesizes the discount to net asset value as being the result of company specific factors relating to such factors as management quality, tax liability and the type of stocks held by the fund. Despite the intuitive appeal of the ‘rational’ approach to closed-end fund discounts the studies have not successfully explained the variance in closed-end fund discounts or why the discount to net asset value in closed-end funds varies so much over time. The variation over time in the average sector discount is not only a feature of closed-end funds but also property companies. This paper analyses changes in the deviations from NAV for UK property companies between 2000 and 2003. The paper present a new way to study the phenomenon ‘cleaning’ the gearing effect by introducing a new way of calculating the discount itself. We call it “ungeared discount”. It is calculated by assuming that a firm issues new equity to repurchase outstanding debt without any variation on asset side. In this way discount does not depend on an accounting effect and the analysis should better explain the effect of other independent variables. ...|$|R
