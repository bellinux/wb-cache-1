5|$|Once Perl code is <b>compiled,</b> {{there is}} {{additional}} overhead during the execution phase that typically isn't present for programs written in <b>compiled</b> languages such as C or C++. Examples of such overhead include bytecode interpretation, reference-counting memory management, and dynamic type-checking.|$|E
500|$|Most of {{what happens}} in Perl's <b>compile</b> phase is compilation, and most {{of what happens}} in Perl's run phase is execution, but there are {{significant}} exceptions. Perl makes important use of its capability to execute Perl code during the <b>compile</b> phase. Perl will also delay compilation into the run phase. The terms that indicate the kind of processing that is actually occurring at any moment are <b>compile</b> time and run time. [...] Perl is in <b>compile</b> time at most points during the <b>compile</b> phase, but <b>compile</b> time may also be entered during the run phase. The <b>compile</b> time for code in a string argument passed to the eval built-in occurs during the run phase. Perl is often in run time during the <b>compile</b> phase and spends most of the run phase in run time. [...] Code in BEGIN blocks executes at run time but in the <b>compile</b> phase.|$|R
40|$|Many logic {{programming}} implementations <b>compile</b> to C, but they <b>compile</b> to very low-level C, and thus discard {{many of the}} advantages of <b>compiling</b> to a high-level language. We describe an alternative approach to <b>compiling</b> logic programs to C, based on continuation passing, that we have used in a new back-end for the Mercury compiler. The new approach <b>compiles</b> to much higher-level C code, which means the compiler back-end and run-time system can be considerably simpler...|$|R

5|$|A third recension was {{probably}} <b>compiled</b> {{during the reign}} of HenryI and was used at the coronation of his successor, Stephen, in 1135. While retaining the most important elements of the Anglo-Saxon rite, it borrowed heavily from the consecration of the Holy Roman Emperor from the Pontificale Romano-Germanicum, a book of German liturgy <b>compiled</b> in Mainz in 961, thus bringing the English tradition into line with continental practice. It remained in use until the coronation of EdwardII in 1308 when the fourth recension was first used, having been <b>compiled</b> over several preceding decades. Although influenced by its French counterpart, the new ordo focussed on the balance between the monarch and his nobles and on the oath, neither of which concerned the absolutist French kings. One manuscript of this recension is the Liber Regalis at Westminster Abbey which has come to be regarded as the definitive version.|$|E

50|$|Compile-time {{function}} execution (or <b>compile</b> time function evaluation, or general constant expressions) {{is the ability}} of a compiler, that would normally <b>compile</b> a function to machine code and execute it at run time, to execute the function at <b>compile</b> time.

A student uses the wrapped compiler when he/she <b>compiles</b> their own program, then the wrapped compiler <b>compiles</b> the student program using the original compiler (e.g. gcc 1) and sends the program, the student information, and the current time to the information extraction server using secure cp (e.g., scp 2).
