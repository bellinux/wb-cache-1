Before its redevelopment, the area, including the original Sulphur Dell ballpark, was prone to regular flooding from the nearby Cumberland River and it flooded during the 2010 Tennessee floods. To prevent water damage, the grandstand has an acrylic floor covering and the field-level suites are equipped with detachable floor boards, food-service tables mounted on <b>casters,</b> and raised floor outlets and electrical switches.|$|E

However, consumers are opposed to the inclusion of insects in their food, and the use of insects in animal feed remains illegal in areas such as the European Union.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. An unequal {{diameter}} twin roll <b>caster</b> was devised {{in order}} to increase productivity of the strip. This <b>caster</b> could cast the strip thicker than 6 mm at the speed of 5 m/min. The feature of this <b>caster</b> is that the lower roll was four times larger than the upper roll. The solidification length of the strip could be set longer easily than the conventional twin roll <b>caster</b> for aluminum alloy. Low solidification rate semisolid casting and low superheat casting were adopted. These were effective to increase the casting speed without decreasing the thickness of the strip. In the present study, the unequal diameter twin roll <b>caster</b> was designed and assembled. The test castings were operated and the characteristics of this <b>caster</b> were shown...|$|R

40|$|Background: Because of {{the adverse}} {{environmental}} conditions present in less-resourced environments (LREs), the World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended that specialised wheelchair test methods {{may need to be}} developed to support product quality standards in these environments. A group of experts identified <b>caster</b> test methods as a high priority because of their common failure in LREs, and the insufficiency of existing test methods described in the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Wheelchair Testing Standards (ISO 7176). Objectives: To develop and demonstrate the feasibility of a <b>caster</b> system test method. Method: Background literature and expert opinions were collected to identify existing <b>caster</b> test methods, <b>caster</b> failures common in LREs and environmental conditions present in LREs. Several conceptual designs for the <b>caster</b> testing method were developed, and through an iterative process using expert feedback, a final concept and a design were developed and a prototype was fabricated. Feasibility tests were conducted by testing a series of <b>caster</b> systems from wheelchairs used in LREs, and failure modes were recorded and compared to anecdotal reports about field failures. Results: The new <b>caster</b> testing system was developed and it provides the flexibility to expose <b>caster</b> systems to typical conditions in LREs. <b>Caster</b> failures such as stem bolt fractures, fork fractures, bearing failures and tire cracking occurred during testing trials and are consistent with field failures. Conclusion: The new <b>caster</b> test system has the capability to incorporate necessary test factors that degrade <b>caster</b> quality in LREs. Future work includes developing and validating a testing protocol that results in failure modes common during wheelchair use in LRE...|$|R

25|$|After {{mastering}} the iron casting process and realizing substantial profits from this new product line, Revere identified a burgeoning market for church bells {{in the religious}} revival known as the Second Great Awakening that followed the war.

25|$|A scenery wagon, {{also known}} as a stage wagon, is a mobile {{platform}} that is used to support and transport movable, three-dimensional theatrical scenery on a theater stage. In most cases, the scenery is constructed on top of the wagon such that the wagon, and the scenery it supports, forms a single, integrated structure. Heavy duty <b>casters</b> are mounted to the underside of the platform so that the entire assembly can be quickly moved onstage or offstage, so as to facilitate rapid scenery changes during live productions. Scenery wagons are built {{in a wide range of}} sizes, ranging from less than one square foot up to the size of the playing area of the stage.|$|E
25|$|With the {{delivery}} of the Class 66 and later the Vossloh Euro, CargoNet's need for the uneconomical and underdimensioned Di 8 fell through. The Euro was put into service on the Nordland Line and the Rauma Line, and NSB started looking for a possibility to sell the locomotives. In October 2011, GB Railfreight was awarded the contract for {{the operation of the}} railway after Sahaviriya Steel Industries had bought and reopened Teesside Steelworks in Redcar, United Kingdom. They were thus in need for locomotives to haul the internal torpedo trains with liquid steel between the steelwork's blast furnaces and continuous <b>casters.</b> Ten Di 8s were thereby sold, of which the first five were shipped on 12 December 2011, and arrived on 20 December, and the last were delivered in January 2012. Eight of the ten locomotives will be used in revenue service; the other two will be used for parts. At that point, seven Di 8s remained in service with CargoNet, with one having been retired and one used for parts. No. 714 was, as the first Di 8, scrapped on 10 July 2013.|$|E

25|$|The {{development}} of large artillery pieces and larger guns began with Burgundy. Originally a minor power, it grew {{to become one}} of the most powerful states in 14th-century Europe, and a great innovator in siege warfare. The Duke of Burgundy, Philip the Bold (1363-1404), based his power on the effective use of big guns and promoted research and development in all aspects of gunpowder weaponry technology. Philip established manufacturers and employed more cannon <b>casters</b> than any European power before him, however he wasn't the first to build large guns. The first appeared in 1375 when a dozen or so smiths in Caen developed a 900 kilogram cannon which took six weeks to create. Whereas most European guns before 1370 weighed about 20 to 40lbs (9–14kg), the French siege of Château de Saint-Sauveur-le-Vicomte in 1375 during the Hundred Years War saw the use of guns weighing over a ton (900kg), firing stone balls weighing over 100lbs (45kg). Philip used large guns to help the French capture the fortress of Odruik in 1377, which was held by the English at the time. These guns fired projectiles far larger than any that had been used before, and among the 140 cannons Philip brought to Odruik, 109 were large, with seven guns that could shoot projectiles as heavy as 90 kilograms. The cannons smashed the city walls, some going right through them, and Odruik surrendered, inaugurating a new era of artillery warfare. Burgundy's territories rapidly expanded using their new gun designs.|$|E
