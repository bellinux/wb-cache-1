40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effectiveness of}} Web banner advertisements in terms of several widely employed <b>copy-testing</b> measures. Two groups of subjects {{were exposed to the}} same banner advertisement with the exception that the promotional message in one of the ads appeared as part of a pull-down menu. The research indicates that consumers who are exposed to banner advertisements using pull-down menus score higher on measures of attention, novelty, liking, persuasion, and click-through, suggesting that these types of banner ads are more effective than traditional, static banners. It is proposed that key factors contributing to this result are the unique format and greater informational appeal of pull-down ads. Managerial implications are discussed and directions for future research are suggested...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the impact on young people of three tobacco industry (TI) advertisements previously screened on MTV Europe and in cinemas in Australia. The three ads were exposed to 14 – 18 -year-old smokers and non-smokers using commercial advertising <b>copy-testing</b> techniques. The primary dependent variable for both smokers and non-smokers was the advertisement’s ability to increase feelings of not wanting to smoke in the future, and, for smokers, the extent to which the ad made current smokers think they should try to stop smoking. The results for the TI ads were compared with copy testing data for youth-targeted Western Australian tobacco control (TC) ads. The TI ads performed as well or better than some TC ads, but not as well as other TC ads suggesting that attacks on the tobacco industry for airing smoking prevention ads cannot always use these ads ’ ineffectiveness as an argument for their removal. However, these tobacco industry ads may increase positive (or lessen negative) attitudes toward the tobacco industry, which could further the industry’s aims of increased support or less criticism from community groups. It may be that this is the more important reason for advocates to call for such ads to be withdrawn...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 58 - 62) This study {{attempted to}} measure attitudes towards advertisements and {{to investigate the}} results of such measurements for possible differences between test and retest performances. The semantic differential, a technique utilizing rating scales for the measurement of concepts, was adapted {{for the purposes of}} this study. The measuring instrument used consisted of ten seven-category semantic differential scales. <b>Copy-testing</b> of two different magazine advertisements was performed on a total of 358 students at San Fernando Valley State College. The subjects comprised four independent sample groups, each of which had approximately the same number of persons. Two of the groups each rated only one of the two advertisements; in the case of the other two groups, a second ad was introduced between test and retest of the initial ad. The experimental design of the study provided for comparative analyses between samples to investigate any effects on retest scores that may be attributable to the introduction of the second advertisement. From the results obtained in this study, it was deduced that: 1. the measuring instrument used in this study is sufficiently reliable to be used in the evaluation of attitudes toward (i. e. to copy-test) advertisements; 2. the introduction of a second, different advertisement between a given ad's test and retest can affect individual subject's retest ratings...|$|E
40|$|Traditional {{observational}} {{research methods}} required an experimenter's presence {{in order to}} record videos of participants, and limited the scalability of data collection to typically less than a few hundred people in a single location. In {{order to make a}} significant leap forward in affective expression data collection and the insights based on it, our work has created and validated a novel framework for collecting and analyzing facial responses over the Internet. The first experiment using this framework enabled 3, 268 trackable face videos to be collected and analyzed in under two months. Each participant viewed one or more commercials while their facial response was recorded and analyzed. Our data showed significantly different intensity and dynamics patterns of smile responses between subgroups who reported liking the commercials versus those who did not. Since this framework appeared in 2011, we have collected over three million videos of facial responses in over 75 countries using this same methodology, enabling facial analytics to become significantly more accurate and validated across five continents. Many new insights have been discovered based on crowd-sourced facial data, enabling Internet-based measurement of facial responses to become reliable and proven. We are now able to provide large-scale evidence for gender, cultural and age differences in behaviors. Today such methods are used as part of standard practice in industry for <b>copy-testing</b> advertisements and are increasingly used for online media evaluations, distance learning, and mobile applications...|$|E
40|$|Emotion {{is key to}} the {{effectiveness}} of media, whether it be in influencing memory, likability or persuasion. Stories and narratives, even if fictional, have the ability to induce a genuine emotional response. However, the understanding of the role of emotions in media and advertising effectiveness has been limited due to the difficulty in measuring emotions in real-life contexts. Video advertising is a ubiquitous form of a short story, usually 30 - 60 seconds in length, designed to influence, persuade, entertain and engage, in which media with emotional content is frequently used. The lack of understanding of the effects of emotion in advertising results in large amounts of wasted time, money and other resources; in this thesis I present several studies measuring responses to advertising. Facial expressions, heart rate, respiration rate and heart rate variability can inform us about the emotional valence, arousal and engagement of a person. In this thesis I demonstrate how automatically-detected naturalistic and spontaneous facial responses and physiological responses can be used to predict {{the effectiveness}} of stories. I present a framework for automatically measuring facial and physiological responses in addition to self-report and behavioral measures to content (e. g. video advertisements) over the Internet {{in order to understand the}} role of emotions in story effectiveness. Specifically, I will present analysis of the first large scale data of facial, physiological, behavioral and self report responses to video content collected "in-the-wild" using the cloud. I have developed models for evaluating the effectiveness of media content (e. g. likability, persuasion and short-term sales impact) based on the automatically extracted features. This work shows success in predicting measures of story effectiveness that are useful in creation of content whether that be in <b>copy-testing</b> or content development. by Daniel Jonathan McDuff.
