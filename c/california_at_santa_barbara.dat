Senior employees at the Survey found his behavioral oddities unsettling. Activity at Mount St. Helens diminished, prompting USGS to reduce CVO's budget and contemplate closing the station. He continued helping the Survey until 1989, also serving as an assistant researcher at the University of <b>California</b> <b>at</b> <b>Santa</b> <b>Barbara.</b>|$|E

40|$|Last fall I had {{the honor}} of {{speaking}} at the dedication of a new physics building on the University of <b>California</b> campus <b>at</b> <b>Santa</b> <b>Barbara.</b> As I arrived for the occasion, it struck me how lucky the physicists <b>at</b> <b>Santa</b> <b>Barbara</b> are to be {{living and working in}} such a glorious place. The day was clear and I could see the mountains, which contain the surviving frayed specimens of the majestic California condor, and the channel, with the islands on the other side. I had been sailing in the channel and had seen it sometimes sparkling in the sunlight, sometimes shrouded with fog, full of dolphins and sea lions. The campus is built on what used to be my favorite bird‐watching place in Southern California, with its curlews, godwits, and phalaropes. Now, for the males of our species, it is a favorite girl‐watching place. In any case it is bustling with young Californians presumably seeking knowledge and wisdom, and some older people who are {{supposed to be able to}} impart such things. The priority need is to develop a systems analysis with heart that society can rely on to choose between possible technologies...|$|R
25|$|Periodically they {{returned}} to the U.S. where Bartlett taught at Southern Methodist University (1947–49), San Jose State University (1960–61), the University of <b>California</b> <b>at</b> <b>Santa</b> <b>Barbara</b> (1961–64), San Diego State University (1979–81), and the University of San Diego (1981–82).

After purchasing a house in Comala, Mexico, her husband's health failed in 1976 and they settled in San Diego where Bartlett continued to work, give poetry readings, and teach until her death in 1994.|$|E
25|$|James Paul Gee {{was born}} in San José, California. He {{received}} his B.A. in philosophy from the University of <b>California</b> <b>at</b> <b>Santa</b> <b>Barbara</b> and both his M.A. and Ph.D in linguistics from Stanford University. He started his career in theoretical linguistics, working in syntactic and semantic theory, and taught initially at Stanford University {{and later in the}} School of Language and Communication at Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts. After doing some research in psycholinguistics at Northeastern University in Boston and at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics in the Netherlands, Prof. Gee's research focus switched to studies on discourse analysis, sociolinguistics, and applications of linguistics to literacy and education. He went on to teach in the School of Education at Boston University, where he was the chair of the Department of Developmental Studies and Counseling, and later in the Linguistics Department at the University of Southern California. At Boston University he established new graduate programs centered around an integrated approach to language and literacy, combining programs in reading, writing, bilingual education, ESL, and applied linguistics. From 1993 to 1997 he held the Jacob Hiatt Chair in Education in the Hiatt Center for Urban Education at Clark University in Massachusetts. From 1997 until 2007, he held the Tashia Morgridge Professor of Reading at the University of Wisconsin–Madison.|$|E
500|$|In 1993, {{a conference}} {{was held at}} the University of <b>California</b> <b>at</b> <b>Santa</b> <b>Barbara,</b> with the subject as Madonna: Feminist Icon or Material Girl?. The conference pondered on the duality of Madonna as both of them and deduced that the {{question}} of Madonna's feminism is not easy to decide. Some of the feminists left the conference, citing that they {{had not been able to}} make up their minds. As the New Age concept became popular in the U.S. in the late 1990s, Madonna tried to shun the [...] "material girl" [...] tag, and embarked on a spiritual quest of her own. Journals like The Times and The Advocate declared her as [...] "the Ethereal Girl" [...] and [...] "Spiritual Girl" [...] respectively.|$|E

500|$|Madonna {{has stated}} that the song she most regrets {{recording}} is [...] "Material Girl" [...] and if she had known that the label would be attached to her for decades, she would probably never have done so. After making the video, Madonna said she {{never wanted to be}} compared to Monroe, despite posing like her and recreating many of Monroe's signature poses for various photos shoots, most notably in a 1991 issue of Vanity Fair. Guilbert commented that [...] "material girl" [...] designated a certain type of liberated women, thus deviating from its original coinage which meant a girl who is tangible and accessible. Author Nicholas Cook said that the meaning and impact of [...] "material girl" [...] was no more circumscribed by the video, rather by its song. Its influence was seen later among such diverse groups such as female versus male, gay versus straight, and academic versus teenage.

In her first season as a head coach, Gottlieb led the Gauchos to a 15-1 regular season conference record in the Big West Conference, and a 22-10 record overall. She was the first coach at UCSB to win 20 games in her first season. [...] Gottlieb scheduled a demanding non-conference season, and the Gauchos pulled off a convincing 59-47 upset of Gonzaga. [...] UCSB won both the regular season Big West championship and the conference tournament championship for 2008–09, which secured an invitation to the NCAA Tournament. The 15-seed Gauchos were knocked off by the 2 seed, Stanford, in the first round. Gottlieb was named Big West Coach of the Year for 2008–09.|$|E
