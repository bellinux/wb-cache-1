50|$|A CAS Registry Number, also {{referred}} to as <b>CASRN</b> or CAS Number, is a unique numerical identifier assigned by the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) to every chemical substance described in the open scientific literature (currently including those described from at least 1957 through the present), including organic and inorganic compounds, minerals, isotopes, alloys and nonstructurable materials (UVCBs, of unknown, variable composition, or biological origin).|$|E
50|$|A <b>CASRN</b> is {{separated}} by hyphens into three parts, the first consisting from two {{up to seven}} digits, the second consisting of two digits, and the third consisting of a single digit serving as a check digit.The check digit is found by taking the last digit times 1, the previous digit times 2, the previous digit times 3 etc., adding all these up and computing the sum modulo 10. For example, the CAS number of water is 7732-18-5: the checksum 5 is calculated as (8&times;1 + 1&times;2 + 2&times;3 + 3&times;4 + 7&times;5 + 7&times;6) = 105; 105 mod 10 = 5.|$|E

40|$|The {{herbicide}} bentazon (<b>CASRN</b> 25057 - 89 - 0) is extensively used {{in agriculture}} in Brittany (France) to replace atrazine. Bentazon is not readily adsorbed by soil {{and therefore it}} enters adjacent freshwater ecosystems, making its way to estuarine and marine waters areas. Information regarding its effects on marine ecosystems is scarce. Phytotoxicity assessments were conducted in the laboratory on the common diatom Chaetoceros gracilis using both the active ingredient and its formulated product (Basamaïs). The 3 day EC 50 using cell counts were, respectively, 150 mg/L and 60 μg/L for bentazon active ingredient and for bentazon-formulated while cellular volume was increased. Although bentazon {{is known as a}} photosystem II inhibitor, it produced an increase of pigment (chlorophylls a, c, and carotenoids) content, ATP synthesis, rates of photosynthesis and respiration, and TBARS formation. Therefore, pigments cannot be used as biomarkers of toxicity. Algal cell recovery from bentazon effects occurred after 6 – 9 days, suggesting a tolerance mechanism...|$|E
40|$|This report {{provides}} information on hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD; <b>CASRN</b> 25637 - 99 - 4; 3194 - 55 - 6) used as a flame retardant in polystyrene building insulation, possible substitutes, and alternative materials. The report {{was developed by the}} U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) with input from a partnership of stakeholders from business, government, academia, and environmental organizations. According to technical experts on the Partnership, between 2011 and 2014 there were only three viable flame retardant alternatives to HBCD for use in expanded and extruded polystyrene foam (EPS and XPS) insulation under current manufacturing processes. Alternative materials are also available as substitutes to HBCD-containing insulation. These alternatives may require additive flame retardants or other treatment to meet fire safety requirements. This report: 1) Identifies viable and non-viable flame retardant alternatives for HBCD in polystyrene building insulation foam; 2) Describes uses and provides an overview of end-of-life scenarios and exposure to HBCD; 3) Provides hazard profiles for HBCD and the three chemical alternatives; and 4) Provides an overview of relevant alternative materials...|$|E
40|$|Within our {{everyday}} life, we {{are confronted with}} a variety of toxic substances of natural or artificial origin. Toxins are already used, e. g. in medicine, but there is still an increasing number of toxic compounds, representing a tremendous potential to extract new substances. Since predictive toxicology gains in importance, the careful and extensive investigation of known toxins is the basis to assess the properties of unknown substances. In order to achieve this aim, we have collected toxic compounds from literature and web sources in the database SuperToxic. The current version of this database compiles about 60 000 compounds and their structures. These molecules are classified according to their toxicity, based on more than 2 million measurements. The SuperToxic database provides a variety of search options like name, <b>CASRN,</b> molecular weight and measured values of toxicity. With the aid of implemented similarity searches, information about possible biological interactions can be gained. Furthermore, connections to the Protein Data Bank, UniProt and the KEGG database are available, to allow the identification of targets and those pathways, the searched compounds are involved in. This database is available online at: [URL]...|$|E
40|$|On {{behalf of}} Ferro Corporation, we are {{submitting}} the enclosed information for consideration by OEHHA as it prepares cancer hazard identification materials for {{butyl benzyl phthalate}} (BBP) (<b>CASRN</b> 85 - 68 - 7). Ferro is a major producer ofBBP. There is a robust set of data for BBP. For the reasons given in our September 20, 2011 comments regarding prioritization, {{as well as the}} additional information herein, Ferro believes the evidence does not support listing of BBP under Proposition 65 as a carcinogen. NTP, which conducted the bioassays on BBP, has not considered BBP for listing in the Report on Carcinogens. IARC and the EU have not classified BBP as a possible or probable carcinogen. There are no human carcinogenicity data for BBP. The great weight of evidence is that BBP is not genotoxic. Tumor formation has been inconsistent and marginal in cancer bioassays, and other animal data do not support a concern for carcinogenicity. Further, biomonitoring data demonstrate that human exposure levels for BBP are extremely low. If OEHHA has any questions or wishes additional information, please contact the undersigned at the telephone or email given above. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} route and vehicle on blood and milk levels of {{decabromodiphenyl}} ether (DecaBDE; <b>CASRN</b> 1163 - 19 - 5) were investigated in the rat {{to assist in}} the design and conduct of a developmental neurotoxicity study. Blood plasma and/or milk concentrations were determined in dams, fetuses, and/or nursing pups after repeated DecaBDE administration by gavage throughout gestation or gestation and lactation using corn oil (CO) or soyaphospholipon/Lutrol F 127 -water (SPL) as the vehicle. The impact of vehicle on plasma levels was also investigated in pups derived from naive dams after a single postnatal dose. This study reports for the first time fetal and neonatal plasma concentrations concurrent with those of maternal plasma and/or milk. Higher concentrations of DecaBDE were achieved in plasma and in milk with CO than with SPL. Furthermore, pups derived from dams treated with only SPL were lower in body weight, compared with those from dams treated with either CO, CO and DecaBDE, or SPL and DecaBDE. The study further shows that exposure to DecaBDE is relatively consistent across the dose range of 100 to 1000 mg/(kg. day) when administered in CO...|$|E
