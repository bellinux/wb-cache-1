40|$|This paper explores how dynamic quality-of-service may be {{supported}} through RSVP over IPSOFACTO within {{a network of}} ATM switches. IPSOFACTO is a methodology fur supporting IP directly over ATM switches. Application endpoints communicate exclusively via IP and no ATM signalling is involved. The application's dynamic QoS requirements are communicated by a user through a novel user interface, called CockpitView, and these are signalled through the network via RSVP running directly on ATM switches. Models to accommodate receiver heterogeneity in this environment are described. A Traffic <b>Control</b> <b>module</b> <b>interfacing</b> to both RSVP signalling and IPSOFACTO is presented. Finally, an experimental setup over the MAY/BALI networks integrating IPSOFACTO, RSVP and CockpitView is presented...|$|R

The UCM package, hardware and software, was designed and built by the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne. Important lessons were learned throughout the collaborative design, installation, testing, and commissioning periods that could be invaluable to future similar controls projects. REQUIREMENTS The requirements for the UCM are not specifically stated in a single document. They exist in a series of documents describing general undulator system requirements, motion requirements, mechanical systems, and thermal stability. From this group of documents, an Engineering Specification Document, ESD, was generated. The ESD serves to describe the engineering design necessary to satisfy the requirements. Requirements for specific UCM software functions were never officially documented, and functions {{have been added to the}} UCM package throughout the project.

40|$|In {{the present}} work we have {{designed}} and implemented a modular, robust and user-friendly Pilot Interface meant to control humanoid robots in rescue scenarios during dangerous missions. We follow the common approach where the robot is semi-autonomous {{and it is}} remotely controlled by a human operator. In our implementation, YARP is used both as a communication channel for low-level hardware components and as an interconnecting framework between <b>control</b> <b>modules.</b> The <b>interface</b> features the capability to receive the status of these modules continuously and request actions when required. In addition, ROS is used to retrieve data from different types of sensors and to display relevant information of the robot status such as joint positions, velocities and torques, force/torque measurements and inertial data. Furthermore the operator is immersed into a 3 D reconstruction {{of the environment and}} is enabled to manipulate 3 D virtual objects. The Pilot Interface allows the operator to control the robot at three different levels. The high-level control deals with human-like actions which involve the whole robotâ€™s actuation and perception. For instance, we successfully teleoperated IITâ€™s COmpliant huMANoid (COMAN) platform to execute complex navigation tasks through the composition of elementary walking commands (e. g. [walk_forward, 1 m]). The mid-level control generates tasks in cartesian space, based on the position and orientation of objects of interest (i. e. valve, door handle) w. r. t. a reference frame on the robot. The low level control operates in joint space and is meant as a last resort tool to perform fine adjustments (e. g. release a trapped limb). Finally, our Pilot Interface is adaptable to different tasks, strategies and pilotâ€™s needs, thanks to a modular architecture of the system which enables to add/remove single front-end components (e. g. GUI widgets) as well as back-end <b>control</b> <b>modules</b> on the fly...|$|R
