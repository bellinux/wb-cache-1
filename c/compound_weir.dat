40|$|This paper {{presents}} a generalised theory {{and design of}} {{a new class of}} self basing weirs of constant indication accuracy giving a discharge alpha(head) (n) for 1 / 2 {{less than or equal to}} n less than or equal to 3 / 2. Unlike in the earlier designed <b>compound</b> <b>weirs</b> for n < 3 / 2, leg., Sutro weir) the weir is defined by a single profile throughout and a portion of the weir above the crest acts as a base. Single profile weirs eliminate the source of error associated with <b>compound</b> <b>weirs</b> arising from the assumption of single value of coefficient of discharge (C-d) for both the base weir and the complementary weir above whereas two separate C(d) s' should be used. The depth of the base weir can be reduced by altering certain parameters to suit the practical considerations. The discharge through this weir for all Bows above a threshold depth "d" and depth of flow "h", is proportional to h(n); 1 / 2 less than or equal to n less than or equal to 3 / 2; within a prefixed allow allowable error of +/- 1 %. The problem is approached by using a hyperbolic function as the discharge generating function. The generalised design presented in this paper allows balancing between the contradictory requirements of accuracy and reduction of afflux in the field. Experiments with three weirs for n = 2 / 3, n = 3 / 4 & n = 5 / 4 confirm the theory by giving a constant average coefficient of discharge for each weir...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTriangular weirs are {{commonly}} used to measure discharge in open channel flow. They represent an inexpensive, reliable methodology to monitor water allocation. A <b>compound</b> sharp-crested <b>weir</b> consisting of two triangular parts with different notch angles was used. The lower triangular part of the weir handles the normal range of discharges while the upper part measures the higher peak flows. This paper evaluates experimentally the local scour downstream compound sharp crested V-notch weir. Forty-eight (48) experimental runs were conducted. Three models of weirs with different geometries (combination of notch angles), four upstream water levels, three water levels at the tailgate, and two bed materials were used. Multiple regression equations based on energy principal and dimensional analysis theory were deduced to estimate the local scour downstream of the weir models. The developed equations were compared with the experimental data.

Flow measurements in rivers are complicated by the high variability of flows as well as by sediment loads and debris.

Part 1 of this paper concentrated on the attributes of different types of gauging structures and provided guidance on the design criteria applicable for selected structures.

40|$|The {{commonly}} used cross sections of weirs are sharp crested rectangular, trapezoidal and triangular, however; the measurement accuracy of single sharp crested weir is abated {{in areas where}} flows exhibits great variability, i. e. the flow ranging from very low flow in dry conditions to very high flow in extreme rainfall events. In top of that, generally the weirs have the problem of accumulation the sedimentation in the weir pond, so to minimize the disadvantage of weirs, it can be merged with gates (which also have the problem of retaining the floating materials) in one device.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to understand the effects of breach properties (e. g. the top width, the depth and the bottom width of the breach) on the breach flow. The breach flow was modeled as flow over a compound broad-crested weir. A laboratory experiment was carried out with a fixed weir model in a flume. Five cases with different breach properties were tested. Firstly, the discharge coefficients for all cases were quantitatively determined. The calibrations were done under two flow conditions, namely emerged flow conditions (flow only through the breach) and overtopping flow conditions (flow through the compound cross-section of weir). In perfect weir situations, {{it turned out that the}} values of the discharge coefficient were below 1 and rather different in the two flow conditions. Particularly in the case of overtopping flow, the linear combination of traditional discharge equations was verified for predicting the discharge and the discharge distribution over the weir. In imperfect weir situations, submergence coefficient was introduced in emerged condition. Secondly, the dependence of the energy head loss caused by the weir on the upstream discharge and the downstream water depth was discussed in imperfect weir situations. The Form Drag model for estimating the energy head loss was proved to be applicable for the modeled breach flow. Thirdly, the local hydraulic characteristics of breach flow were described by means of velocity distribution, water level elevation and flow patterns appearing behind the weir. At last, the numerical model (Delft 3 D) was verified on the modeling of the present experiment by comparing with the experimental data. The report provides the information for the breach flow which can be of use in the development of breach models, inundation models and <b>compound</b> <b>weir</b> design.

40|$|Breaching is {{the most}} {{frequent}} form of embankment failure in the world. Due to overtopping, an embankment starts to breach when part of the embankment actually breaks away, leaving an opening for water to flood the land protected by the embankment. A breach can be a sudden or gradual failure that is caused by surface erosion and/or headcut erosion in the embankment. The magnitude and extent of the losses depend highly on the rate of breaching of the embankment, which determines the discharge through the breach and the speed and rate of inundation of the valley or polder. Therefore, modelling of the breach evolution in embankments is of significant interest for damage assessment and risk analysis. It is also important {{for the development of}} early warning systems for dike and dam failures and of evacuation plans for people at risk. The breach flow {{plays an important role in}} the embankment breaching process, coupling the hydraulic process and the sediment transport process. During the breaching process, the flow overtops the entire embankment crest and generates the breach channel in the initial phase of the breach development. As the breach further develops, the breach flow goes only through the breach channel due to the decrease of the upstream water level. The breach flow can thus be classified as <b>compound</b> <b>weir</b> flow and weir flow, each having own special characteristics. In a breach, the helicoidal flow accelerates the sediment undermining at the toe of the breach slopes and widens the breach in the lateral direction of the embankment. A triangular hydraulic jump happens when the breach flow changes from supercritical flow into subcritical flow, with a triangular critical area at the toe of the breach. The triangular hydraulic jump works as a driving force to the headcut erosion in the breaching process and the scour hole development at the toe of embankment. According to the hydraulic energy loss in the breach, the discharge coefficients are deducted for both weir flow condition and <b>compound</b> <b>weir</b> flow condition. The resulting discharge coefficients can be used in the calculation of the breach discharge in a breach model. In the present study, five runs of breach experiments were conducted in a relative large laboratory flume. The experimental results clearly expose the hydrodynamic process and the erosion process in the breaching of the cohesive embankment. The breaching starts with the initial erosion of the embankment surface washing away the embankment surface. Due to the surface erosion at the toe of the embankment, the headcut erosion is stimulated on the embankment slope. While headcut migration stimulates the breach to develop in longitudinal direction, the lateral erosion triggers the breach to widen in lateral direction. Three types of erosion (surface erosion, headcut erosion and lateral erosion) contribute to the breach erosion process in the embankment, however, the breach flow is the driving force for the erosion. Sediment deposition in the breaching process, generally ignored in the embankment breaching studies, is also of importance. A mathematical model has been developed that couples weir flow and erosion (surface erosion, headcut erosion and lateral erosion). The breaching process is simplified into initial development, deepening development and widening development, corresponding with surface erosion, headcut erosion and lateral erosion, respectively. As the link between flow and embankment material, erosion plays a key role in the embankment breach model. Mathematical descriptions of the headcut migration and the lateral migration rate have been developed to simulate the breaching process in cohesive embankments. The headcut erosion and the lateral erosion are considered to occur in the form of clay blocks instead of in the form of individual clay particles.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} the design of the quadratic weir notch, which finds application in the proportionate method of flow measurement in a by-pass, such that the discharge through it is proportional to the square root of the head measured above a certain datum. The weir notch consists of a bottom {{in the form of a}} rectangular weir of width 2 W and depth a over which a designed curve is fitted. A theorem concerning the flow through <b>compound</b> <b>weirs</b> called the “slope discharge continuity theorem” is discussed and proved. Using this, the problem is reduced to the determination of an exact solution to Volterra's integral equation in Abel's form. It is shown that in the case of a quadratic weir notch, the discharge is proportional to the square root of the head measured above a datum Image a above the crest of the weir. Further, it is observed that the function defining the shape of the weir is rapidly convergent and its value almost approximates to zero at distances of 3 a and above from the crest of the weir. This interesting and significant behaviour of the function incidentally provides a very good approximate solution to a particular Fredholm integral equation of the first kind, transforming the notch into a device called a “proportional-orifice”. A new concept of a “notch-orifice” capable of passing a discharge proportional to the square root of the head (above a particular datum) while acting both as a notch, and as an orifice, is given. A typical experiment with one such notch-orifice, having A = 4 in., and W = 6 in., shows a remarkable agreement with the theory and is found to have a constant coefficient of discharge of 0. 61 in the ranges of both notch and orifice...|$|R
30|$|In this method, stream {{discharge}} is estimated using a formed check-dam or weir made of plywood, or other wooden boards, and reinforced concrete, {{in the cross}} section of a stream (Rickard et al. 2003; Gordon et al. 2013). Weirs are classified into two general categories viz. broad crested and sharp crested (Chaudhry 2008). Broad crested weirs can only be used to calculate instantaneous flows (Gonzalez and Chanson 2007). Sharp crested weirs are constructed {{in a variety of}} shapes such as V-notch, rectangular and Cipolletti weirs (Martin 2006). Flow rate can be measured by using a predefined table (British Columbia 2006) or discharge can be estimated using a weir equation, which considers the flow rate, height of water head and width of the crest (Ghodsian 2003; Emiroglu et al. 2011). This method requires skilled workers (Peterson and Cromwell 1993) and considerable drop between the upstream and downstream water surfaces, which is often not available in flat grade ditches. Frequently, it is necessary to construct a pool or stilling area above the weir so the water loses its velocity. Weir installations in earthen ditches can be troublesome and results can be affected by installation and construction (Peterson and Cromwell 1993; George et al. 2011). This method is time consuming, expensive and installation of weirs may alter the habitat for local species (Rickard et al. 2003). Siltation affects the reliability of the results (Hudson 2004). A pre-measured flow rate is needed before constructing a weir (Martin 2006). The weir must be sized to accommodate the range of flow that needs to be measured. In many cases, the natural range of flow is too large to be captured by a single <b>weir.</b> <b>Compound</b> <b>weirs</b> can be used to expand the measured range of flows. Weirs {{are one of the most}} accurate methods of measuring water flow (Peterson and Cromwell 1993) and may form an important component of a Water Management Plan (Rickard et al. 2003).|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{compound}} sharp-crested weirs {{are composed}} from several notches {{and those are}} designedin different shapes. One of the hydraulic advantagesof compound weirs is that atlowflow rate, the bottomnotchacts assimpleweir andwith the creation of morehydraulicheadonits upstream, due to theshape of thenotch, make dischargemeasurement withappropriatesensitivity. In high flow rates, the upper notch prevents of increasing upstream water level and backwater and discharge measurement is possible with acceptable accuracy. The compound sharp-crested weirs {{can be used as}} an appropriate solution for discharge measurement with reasonable accuracy and sensitivity of the extensive range of flows. Relations are derived from this kind of weirs hassufficientaccuracy withobservation of design criteriaandconstructionstandards. The purposeofthisresearch was a laboratory investigation of geometricandhydraulic effective parameterson discharge coefficient of compound arched circular- rectangular sharp-crested weirs in two cases of full width of channel and partially contracted weirs and compare the values of the discharge coefficient of compound and simple rectangular weirs. Materials and Methods:Considering the geometric, kinematic and dynamic variables affecting the free flow of sharp-crested weirs, there are 11 independent variableswiththree main quantities (length, massandtime). Usingdimensional analysis with π-Buckinghammethod,it can bederived thedimansionlessrelationship. In order to assess theeffect of various parametersonthe coefficient ofCd,thedimansionlessdiagramsare used. Inthe state of(h≤h 0), discharge relationship usedinsimplecircular weir. In thestate of(h>h 0), discharge of <b>compound</b> <b>weir</b> is computeted from the linear combination of discharge relationships in circular and rectangular weirs. Experimentsare conducted inthe hydraulic engineering models laboratory, Department of Water Engineering, University of Tabriz, in a rectangular glass-metal flume of 9 m length, 25 cm width and 50 cm height. Aftersetting up the weirs in a relevant place of flume andestablish thesteady flow,experiments were performedinthefree flowon 36 models of weirs. Results and Discussion:In this research, theeffects ofrectangularnotch width, the height of weir crest, the height ofcirculararch notch were investigated forchanges of headwithdimensionless ratios of h/P,h/R,h/h_ 0,h/Bon discharge coefficient. The results showthat fora known headover the weir, discharge coefficient increase about 2 to 10 percent with the development of the rectangular notch width of compound and simple rectangular sharp-crested weirs. For a given head over the weir, discharge coefficient decrease approximately 1 to 5 percent by increasing the height of the weir crest of compound and simple sharp-crested weirs. Fora given head over weir in low head values, discharge coefficient increase approximately 35 percent by reducing the height of circulararch notch in the compound weirs than simple rectangular weirs. Based on statistical indicators, computational and observation discharge coefficient values in most compound and simple weirs, acceptable coincidence with each other. The meanvalues of thecoefficient of determination (R 2) androot mean square error(RMSE) are 0. 630 and 0. 061,respectively. Among the effective factors that indicate the difference, it can be referred to the theoretical equation in the compound state that is obtained by assuming a linear combination of simple weirs. The effect of the lateral walls of the flume, the measurement accuracy of hydraulic head and discharge, the conditions of flow entrance, the extension of the range of empirical equations proposed in literature for discharge coefficient of simple weirs, Other factors contributing to the difference between the estimated and observed values of discharge coefficient. Inthistypeofweirs,the least amount ofdiscontinuityin thetransition region of simple to compound state in head-discharge relationship can be seenin thewide rangeofdischargescomparedwithother kinds ofcompound weirswithhorizontalorslopingcrests. Conclusion:In this research, a seri of experiments conducted to investigate Cd of the compound arched circular-rectangular sharp-crested weirs in both full width of the channel and partially contracted. The advantage of these weirsisdischarge measurement ina wide range. According to the parametersaffecting theweir, Cd has changed from 0. 54 to 0. 89 range in the compound weirs and 0. 55 to 0. 66 range in the simple rectangular weirs.
