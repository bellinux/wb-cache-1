5|$|The {{tolerance}} of violence within mainstream American <b>culture</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{central theme of}} the record, which takes a critical look at the roles gun culture, conservative American Christianity, and traditional family values play in the glorification of violence. A substantive portion of the album analyzes the cultural role of Jesus Christ, specifically Manson's view {{that the image of}} his crucifixion became the origin of celebrity. Manson said that while his previous work argued against the credibility of the Bible's content, for the purpose of Holy Wood, he instead looked for things in the Bible to which he could relate. He developed an opinion that Christ was a revolutionary figure—a person who was killed for having dangerous opinions, and whose image was later exploited and merchandised for financial gain by entities such as the Vatican.|$|E

50|$|Along {{with the}} Sheths and Basaks, Sutanuti {{gradually}} lost its visibility, replaced by numerous neighbourhoods, and retreated into {{the books of}} history and scrolls of honour. We hear of Nabakrishna Deb being offered the Talukdari of Sutanuti. Binay Ghosh, the renowned cultural-historian has distinguished four types of culture prevailing in old Kolkata - Sutanuti culture, Kalikata culture, Gobindapur culture and Bhawanipur <b>culture.</b> Sutanuti <b>culture</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> urban-feudal <b>culture</b> propagated by Nabakrishna Deb, Kalikata <b>culture</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> mercantile <b>culture</b> propagated by Sheths-Basaks. Gobindapur <b>culture</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> European nouveaux riche <b>culture.</b> Bhawanipur <b>culture</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Hindu Bengali middle-class <b>culture.</b> Sutanuti <b>is</b> <b>the</b> place where Job Charnock landed in 1690. Around it grew not only the city of Kolkata but also the mighty British Empire in India. As the heart of Kolkata’s Black Town, as well as cradle of its culture, Sutanuti continues to hold nostalgic curiosity for anybody {{with an interest in}} old Kolkata.|$|R

25|$|Some {{scholars}} {{have argued that}} the historical Vedic <b>culture</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> result of an amalgamation of the immigrating Indo-Aryans with the remnants of the indigenous civilization, such as the Ochre Coloured Pottery culture.

It continues to progress and spread throughout the world. It has at times affected popular fashion, music, literature, films, art, jargon, and more.|$|E
25|$|Funeral traditions tend to vary {{based on}} a number of factors, {{including}} religion and location, but {{there are a number of}} commonalities. Probably the most important part of death and dying in the African-American <b>culture</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> gathering of family and friends.

25|$|The {{concept of}} European culture is {{generally}} {{linked to the}} classical definition of the Western world. In this definition, Western <b>culture</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> set of literary, scientific, political, artistic and philosophical principles which set it apart from other civilizations. Much of this set of traditions and knowledge is collected in the Western canon. The term has come to apply to countries whose history has been strongly marked by European immigration or settlement during the 18th and 19th centuries, such as the Americas, and Australasia, and is not restricted to Europe.|$|E
25|$|Traces of the Copper Age (Chalcolithic era) in Austria were {{identified}} in the Carpathian Basin hoard at Stollhof, Hohe Wand, Lower Austria. Hilltop settlements from this era are common in eastern Austria. During this time the inhabitants sought out and developed raw materials in the central Alpine areas. The most important find {{is considered to be}} the Iceman Ötzi a well-preserved mummy of a man frozen in the Alps dating from approximately 3,300 BC, although these finds are now in Italy on the Austrian border.

The {{recording}} sessions for the album were split between two studios in British Columbia, with producer Garth Richardson.

25|$|Hellenistic Judaism was a {{movement}} which {{existed in the}} Jewish diaspora and the Holy Land that sought to establish a Hebraic-Jewish religious tradition within the culture and language of Hellenism. The major literary product of the contact of Judaism and Hellenistic <b>culture</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Septuagint (begun in the 3rd century BC). Major authors are Philo of Alexandria (died c. 50 AD), Josephus (died c.100 AD), and some would claim also Paul. The decline of Hellenistic Judaism in the 2nd century AD is obscure. It may be that it was marginalized by, absorbed into or became Early Christianity.|$|E
25|$|Longline culture (rope culture): Mussels are {{cultivated}} {{extensively in}} New Zealand, {{where the most}} common method is to attach mussels to ropes which are hung from a rope back-bone supported by large plastic floats.

Longline <b>culture</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> most recent development for mussel culture and are often used {{as an alternative to}} raft culture in areas that are more exposed to high wave energy. A long-line is suspended by a series of small anchored floats and ropes or socks of mussels are then suspended vertically from the line.|$|E
25|$|The Valdivia <b>culture</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> first {{culture where}} {{significant}} remains have been discovered. Their civilization dates back {{as early as}} 3500 BC. Living in the area near The Valdivias were the first Americans to use pottery. They created bowls, jars and female statues out of clay, both for everyday life and for use in religious ceremonies. They navigated the seas on rafts with sails and established a trade network with tribes in the Andes and the Amazon. Valdivia art and artifacts have been found throughout the country. An extensive collection is {{on display at the}} Museo Fianco Banco Central in Quito and the UEES in Guayaquil.|$|E
