500|$|Iron forms {{compounds}} {{mainly in}} the +2 and +3 oxidation states. Traditionally, iron(II) compounds are called ferrous, and iron(III) compounds ferric. Iron also occurs in higher oxidation states, an example being the purple potassium ferrate (K2FeO4) which <b>contains</b> <b>iron</b> in its +6 oxidation state, although this is very easily reduced. Although iron(VIII) oxide (FeO4) has been claimed, the report could not be reproduced and such a species (at least with iron in its +8 oxidation state) {{has been found to}} be improbable computationally. [...] However, one form of anionic – with iron in its +7 oxidation state, along with an iron(V)-peroxo isomer, has been detected by infrared spectroscopy at 4K after cocondensation of laser-ablated Fe atoms with a mixture of O2/Ar. Iron(IV) is a common intermediate in many biochemical oxidation reactions. Numerous organometallic compounds contain formal oxidation states of +1, 0, −1, or even −2. The oxidation states and other bonding properties are often assessed using the technique of Mössbauer spectroscopy.|$|E
500|$|As {{molten iron}} cools past its {{freezing}} point of 1538°C, it crystallizes into its δ allotrope, {{which has a}} body-centered cubic (bcc) crystal structure. As it cools further to 1394°C, it changes to its γ-iron allotrope, a face-centered cubic (fcc) crystal structure, or austenite. At 912°C and below, the crystal structure again becomes the bcc α-iron allotrope, or ferrite. Finally, at 770°C (the Curie point, Tc) iron's magnetic ordering changes from paramagnetic to ferromagnetic. As the iron passes through the Curie temperature there is no change in crystalline structure, {{but there is a}} change in [...] "domain structure", where each domain <b>contains</b> <b>iron</b> atoms with a particular electronic spin. In unmagnetized iron, all the electronic spins of the atoms within one domain have the same axis orientation; however, the electrons of neighboring domains have other orientations with the result of mutual cancellation and no magnetic field. In magnetized iron, the electronic spins of the domains are aligned and the magnetic effects are reinforced. Although each domain contains billions of atoms, they are very small, about 10micrometres across. This happens because the two unpaired electrons on each iron atom are in the dz2 and dx2 − y2 orbitals, which do not point directly at the nearest neighbors in the body-centered cubic lattice and therefore do not participate in metallic bonding; thus, they can interact magnetically with each other so that their spins align.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND Application of {{aminolevulinic acid}} (ALA) for {{photodynamic}} therapy induces significant sensitivity to visible light. OBJECTIVE To determine whether sunscreens containing inorganic agents are effective against sen-sitivity to blue light induced by ALA application. METHODS & MATERIALS Twenty subjects received application of ALA on the arm. Thirty minutes be-fore blue light exposure, two sun protection factor 50 inorganic-based sunscreens <b>containing</b> <b>iron</b> oxide 3. 2 % and 0. 2 % were applied on separate areas where ALA was applied; a third area received no sun-screen. Small areas of skin {{were exposed to}} increasing fluences of blue light 3 or 18 hours later, and the minimal phototoxic dose (MPD) was noted. RESULTS Three hours after ALA application MPD was 29. 2 and 22. 6 J/cm 2 for skin protected with sun-screen <b>containing</b> <b>iron</b> oxide 3. 2 % and 0. 2 %, respectively, and 10. 6 J/cm 2 for unprotected skin (p =. 003 and. 0497 respectively).
