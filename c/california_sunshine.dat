500|$|With {{the move}} to Los Angeles, many changes behind the scenes occurred, {{as much of the}} {{original}} The X-Files crew was gone. New production designer Corey Kaplan, editor Lynne Willingham, writer David Amann and director and producer Michael Watkins joined and stayed for several years. Bill Roe became the show's new director of photography and episodes generally had a drier, brighter look due to <b>California's</b> <b>sunshine</b> and climate, as compared with Vancouver's rain, fog and temperate forests. Early in the sixth season, the producers took advantage of the new location, setting the show in new parts of the country. For example, Vince Gilligan's [...] "Drive", about a man subject to an unexplained illness, was a frenetic action episode, unusual for The X-Files largely because it was set in Nevada's stark desert roads. The [...] "Dreamland" [...] two-part episode was also set in Nevada, this time in Area 51. The episode was largely filmed at [...] "Club Ed", a movie ranch located on the outskirts of Lancaster, California.|$|R

Born in Kentucky and a resident of Modesto, California, he was Speaker of the Assembly from January 1959 until he resigned in September 1961 to accept appointment to the California Courts of Appeal, Fifth Appellate District Court. He is best known for writing the Brown Act, <b>California's</b> first <b>sunshine</b> law, providing for increased public access to government meetings, which was enacted in 1953.|$|R

Indeed, she hugged and squeezed the squirming Mumbles until he resented such strenuous fondling and escaped to Patsy's more moderate embraces. Myrtle had never yet ridden in an automobile, {{and the prospect of}} a long journey across the country in a big touring car, with <b>California's</b> roses and <b>sunshine</b> at the end of it, was certainly alluring enough to intoxicate one far more accustomed to pleasure than this friendless, impoverished girl.|$|R
5000|$|The Board meets every Tuesday at 9:30 a.m. at the Board Hearing Room (381B) at the Kenneth Hahn Hall of Administration in {{downtown}} Los Angeles. On Tuesdays following a Monday holiday, Board meetings begin after lunch, at 1:00 p.m. Board meetings are conducted {{in accordance with}} Robert's Rules of Order, the Brown Act (<b>California’s</b> <b>sunshine</b> law), and the Rules of the Board. The Chief Executive Officer, the County Counsel and the Executive Officer, or their deputies, attend each Board meeting. The regular agendas for the first, second, third and fifth Tuesdays of the month are essentially a consent calendar, that is, all items are automatically approved without discussion, unless a Supervisor or member of the public requests discussion of a specific item. The fourth Tuesday of the month is reserved {{for the purpose of}} conducting legally required public hearings, Board of Supervisors motions and department items continued from a previous meeting, have time constraints, or are critical in nature. Since Board meetings are considered Brown Act bodies, a Board agenda is published 72 hours before the Board meeting is convened. At the start of a meeting, after an invocation and the Pledge of Allegiance, all items that do not have [...] "holds" [...] placed on them by a Supervisor or a member of the public, or are mandatory public hearings, are approved on a consent calendar. Following that, presentations of various dignitaries (e.g., local consulate officials, awards to County employees and the general public, and pets for adoption) are made. Then, items that were not approved are called in numerical order unless a supervisor wishes to take items out of order. Members of the public are allotted three minutes to make public comment on all the agenda items that they intend to discuss. An additional three minutes are provided during general public comment on any topic within the board's jurisdiction. Individuals must submit comment cards {{before the start of the}} meeting and wait until their item is called. On popular topics with multiple speakers, comments may be restricted to as little as one minute each, and the board has the discretion to figuratively muzzle anyone who is addressing the board in a disruptive manner. Weekly Board meetings are broadcast live online and televised on local public television (KLCS Channel 58). Transcripts and statements of proceedings are published online. However, because some Board decisions have major implications, speakers and protesters on behalf of many causes regularly attend the meetings. The county is sued frequently by various public interest law firms and organizations on behalf of people who disagree with the Board's decisions.|$|R
50|$|The <b>California</b> <b>Sunshine</b> Soccer Team {{was founded}} in 1977 by Warren Hoffnung (a nuclear physicist, {{aerospace}} executive and entrepreneur - currently CEO of MyWrapper, a software company that sells software for creating personalized candy wrappers) and Lee Andrews (a financial advisor). They acquired the Orange County, California territorial rights in the American Soccer League, the oldest U.S. professional soccer league. The commissioner of the ASL {{at the time was}} basketball great Bob Cousy and there were teams spread across the U.S. A little known fact is that the <b>California</b> <b>Sunshine</b> approved the move of the Quicksilver to Anaheim Stadium where it was renamed the California Surf. The <b>California</b> <b>Sunshine</b> was founded with two major philosophies: To field as many American players as possible and to keep profanity off the playing field. The goal was to encourage American youth to be able to attend the matches and see how soccer could be an important part of their sports participation. In fact, {{all but one of the}} players were American.|$|E

40|$|Historically, the United States and California {{have been}} two of the world’s most prosperous economies. As {{manufacturing}} declined {{in the latter half}} of the 20 th century, the US upgraded to a knowledge-based services economy, but the US and California’s governments failed to invest in the changing business environment, allowing infrastructure and social institutions to deteriorate immensely while government spending ballooned and partisan bureaucracy limited effective policy implementation. <b>California,</b> the <b>sunshine</b> state, is microcosm of the US’s main issues, with persistent unemployment and a looming budget deficit, despite having the third highest corporate tax rate in the nation. Historically, California provided a competitive business environment for the world’s best clusters in entertainment, fashion, high tech, and venture capital to develop, branding the state as a hotbed of innovation and entrepreneurship. However, the extremely high cost of business has resulted in a slow but steady exodus of enterprises. California’s 40 -year old solar energy cluster had a global first-mover advantage and strong incentive plan to boost local demand and drive cluster innovation. Though it has dedicated solar research and universities, strong support from related clusters, and a foothold on the new thin-film market, the cluster is bordering on decline due to increased global manufacturing competition, a labor shortage o...|$|R
