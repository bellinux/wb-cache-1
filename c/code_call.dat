50|$|Inversion {{of control}} (IoC) is more general than DI. Put simply, IoC means letting other <b>code</b> <b>call</b> you rather than insisting on doing the calling. An example of IoC without DI is the {{template}} method pattern. Here, polymorphism is achieved through subclassing, that is, inheritance. Dependency injection implements IoC through composition so is often {{identical to that}} of the strategy pattern, but while the strategy pattern is intended for dependencies to be interchangeable throughout an object's lifetime, in dependency injection it may be that only a single instance of a dependency is used. This still achieves polymorphism, but through delegation and composition.|$|E
50|$|Windows 95 executes {{drivers and}} process {{switching}} in ring 0, while applications, including API DLL such as kernel32.dll and krnl386.exe are executed in ring 3. Driver VWIN32.VXD provides key operating system primitives at ring 0. It allows calling of driver functions from 16-bit applications (MSDOS and Win16). This address is obtained by calling INT 2Fh, with 1684h in the AX register. To identify which VxD anentry point {{is being requested}} for, the BX register is set to the 16-bit VxD ID. Upon return from the INT instruction, the ES.DI registers contain a far pointer that can be called to transfer control to the VxD running at ring 0. The descriptor pointed by ES is actually call gate. 32-bit applications, however, {{when they need to}} access Windows 95 driver <b>code,</b> <b>call</b> undocumented VxDCall function in KERNEL32.DLL which essentially calls INT 30h, which changes ring mode.|$|E
5000|$|Buster {{loses his}} car during {{the attempt to}} launch the boat. The boat passes with {{impunity}} under the exceedingly low bridges of the Venice (California) canals thanks to Buster's boat design. While out on the Pacific, Buster {{and his family are}} caught in a terrible storm. The boat is barely seaworthy to begin with, and it does not help that Buster nails a picture up inside the boat, causing an improbable leak, or when he further drills through the bottom of the boat to let the water out (resulting in a spectacular gusher of a leak). He radios a Morse <b>Code</b> <b>call</b> for help, but when the navy or coast guard operator asks who it is, he answers, [...] "d-a-m-f-i-n-o" [...] (in Morse Code). The man interprets it as [...] "damn if I know" [...] and dismisses the call as a prank. Taking to a (ridiculously small) dinghy (that is in fact a bathtub), Buster and his family wash up on a deserted beach in dark of night. [...] "Where are we?"

40|$|Multiple {{argument}} dispatching is {{a natural}} extension of single-argument, or receiver-based, dispatch. Recently several techniques were proposed that aim to make multiple dispatch an efficient operation. However, none of the studies has actually analyzed run-time behavior. In this study we compare several techniques, two of which are presented for the first time, by writing down abstract assembly <b>code</b> <b>call</b> sequences. We discuss the expected instruction-level parallelism and give formulas for the critical path. This preliminary analysis gives us promising candidates for later, more rigorous experimentation. 1. Introduction A popular myth among the object-literate holds that message passing is intrinsically inefficient. This is not the case. Implementations of message passing, a. k. a message dispatching, realize single-argument polymorphism, which {{is a natural}} and powerful tool to factorize program code. To accomplish the same factorization in a procedural language, one would have to c [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Flight {{test and}} {{theoretical}} aerodynamic {{data were obtained}} for a flight test fixture mounted {{on the underside of}} an F- 104 G aircraft. The theoretical data were generated using two codes, a two dimensional transonic code called Code H, and a three dimensional subsonic and supersonic <b>code</b> <b>call</b> wing-body. Pressure distributions generated by the codes for the flight test fixture as well as boundary layer displacement thickness generated by the two dimensional code were compared to the flight test data. The two dimensional code pressure distributions compared well except at the minimum pressure point and trailing edge. Shock locations compared well except at high transonic speeds. The three dimensional code pressure distributions compared well except at the trailing edge of the flight test fixture. The two dimensional code does not predict displacement thickness of the flight test fixture well...|$|E
40|$|Rapid Response Teams (RRTs) {{respond to}} {{critically}} ill {{patients in the}} hospital. Activation of RRTs is highly subjective and misses a proportion of at-risk patients. We created an automated scoring system for non-ICU inpatients based on readily available electronic vital signs data, age, and body mass index. Over two weeks, we recorded scores on 1, 878 patient {{with a range of}} scores from 0 to 10. Fifty patients reached the primary outcome of <b>code</b> <b>call,</b> cardiopulmonary arrest, or transfer to an ICU. Using a cutoff score of 4 or greater would result in identification of an additional 20 patients over the 7 patients identified by the current method of RRT activation. The area under the Receiver Operating Curve for the prediction model was 0. 72 which compared favorably to other scoring systems. An electronic scoring system using readily captured EMR data may improve identification of patients at risk for clinical deterioration...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Trace {{links between}} {{requirements}} and code reveal where requirements are implemented. Such trace links {{are essential for}} code understanding and change management. The lack thereof is often cited as a key reason for software engineering failure. Unfortunately, the creation and maintenance of requirements-to-code traces remains a largely manual and error prone task due to the informal nature of requirements. This paper demonstrates that reasoning about requirements-to-code traces can be done, in part, by considering the calling relationships within the source <b>code</b> (<b>call</b> graph). We observed that requirements-to-code traces form regions along calling dependencies. Better knowledge about these regions has several direct benefits. For example, erroneous traces become detectable if a method inside a region does not trace to a requirement. Or, a missing trace (incompleteness) can be identified. Knowledge of requirement regions {{can also be used}} to help guide developers in establishing requirements-to-code traces in a more efficient manner. This paper discusses requirement regions and sketches their benefits. Keywords-requirements, call tree, traces, feature location I...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} interoperability {{of software}} transactions and ad hoc nonblocking algorithms. Specifically, we explain how to modify arbitrary nonblocking methods so that (1) {{they can be}} used both inside and outside transactions, (2) external uses serialize with transactions, and (3) internal uses succeed if, only if, and when the surrounding transaction commits. Interoperability has two important benefits. First, it allows nonblocking methods {{to play the role of}} fast, closed nested transactions, with potentially significant performance benefits. Second, it allows programmers to safely mix transactions and nonblocking methods, e. g., to update legacy <b>code,</b> <b>call</b> nonblocking libraries, or atomically compose nonblocking methods. We demonstrate our ideas in the context of the Java-based ASTM system on several lock-free data structures. Our findings are encouraging: Although performance of transaction-safe nonblocking objects does not match that of the original nonblocking objects, the degradation is not unacceptably high (particularly after application of an optimization we call lazy logging). It is, moreover, significantly better than that of analogous transactional objects. We conclude that transaction safe nonblocking objects can be a significant enhancement to software transactional memory...|$|E

Abstract: Call admission control in a wireless cell {{in a personal}} communication system (PCS) can be modeled as an M/M/C/C queuing system with m classes of users.

We <b>code</b> <b>call</b> admission control decisions as binary strings, where a value of “ 1 ” in the position i (i= 1,…m) of a decision string stands for the decision of accepting a call in class-i; a value of “ 0 ” in the position i of the decision string stands for the decision of rejecting a call in class-i.

40|$|An RDD {{attack against}} the U. S. is {{something}} America needs to prepare against. If such an event occurs the ability to quickly identify {{the source of the}} radiological material used in an RDD would aid investigators in identifying the perpetrators. Spent fuel {{is one of the most}} dangerous possible radiological sources for an RDD. In this work, a forensics methodology was developed and implemented to attribute spent fuel to a source reactor. The specific attributes determined are the spent fuel burnup, age from discharge, reactor type, and initial fuel enrichment. It is shown that by analyzing the post-event material, these attributes can be determined with enough accuracy to be useful for investigators. The burnup can be found within a 5 % accuracy, enrichment with a 2 % accuracy, and age with a 10 % accuracy. Reactor type can be determined if specific nuclides are measured. The methodology developed was implemented into a <b>code</b> <b>call</b> NEMASYS. NEMASYS is easy to use and it takes a minimum amount of time to learn its basic functions.
