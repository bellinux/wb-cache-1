5000|$|On August 29, 2016 National Health Inspectorate of Latvia {{published}} {{a decision to}} apply a fine to SIA Latima, manufacturer of Rigvir, according to the Law on the Prohibition of Unfair Commercial Practices. After investigating the advertisements of prescription medicine Rigvir on the Internet and a magazine, Health Inspectorate decided that SIA Latima, the marketing authorization holder of Rigvir, has engaged in misleading commercial practice without due professional care, as the advertisements violate the requirements of Cabinet of Ministers regulation No.378, which specify that advertising prescription medicine {{to the general public}} is forbidden and that the information contained in advertisement has to match the information provided in the product characteristics. While Rigvir was only registered for treatment of cutaneous melanoma, it is being advertised for various cancers without any evidence of efficacy by International Virotherapy Centre in Latvia, the main institution providing treatment with Rigvir, as well as its accredited partners, e.g., exclusive partner in Mexico, alternative cancer clinic Hope 4 Cancer Institute, which offers untested and unproven therapies, such as coffee enemas and juice detoxes. Since Latvia is a member of European Union, according to Article 88 (DIRECTIVE 2001/83/EC on the <b>Community</b> <b>code</b> relating to medicinal products for human use), Member States shall prohibit the advertising to general public of medicinal products which are available on medical prescription only (page 26).|$|E

50|$|The {{story begins}} with Nina, a lesbian {{real estate agent}} who {{lives and works in}} the {{neighborhood}} and {{is at the center of}} the changes taking place. The changes include having areas of the neighborhood designated a Historic District (creating restrictive housing codes), an increase in code enforcement complaints, and efforts to reduce low-income housing in the <b>community.</b> <b>Code</b> enforcement is complaint driven and neighborhood resident Linda Mitchell believes the new residents moving in on her block are responsible for the code and zoning citations that have landed her in Judge Pfeiffer's Environmental Court. Linda suffers from cirrhosis of the liver and lives on disability insurance. She does not address the housing and zoning violations and her limited resources prevent her from making repairs to her home. This puts her in jeopardy of arrest, until residents assist in remedying with code violations. Baba, a Yoruba priest and plumber, is the founder of the community gallery in the neighborhood, which occupies the bottom two floors of his three-story house. The name and address sign that he hangs above his porch is now in violation of Historic Code because it is carved in an African-relief style. Baba is also prosecuted in court before Judge Pfeiffer and faces fines and possible arrest for refusing to remove his sign, but the case is dismissed. Jim, a working-class gay man, works two jobs to buy a boarded up Victorian house in Olde Towne East. He risks his financial future when he purchases and begins renovations on the house using credit cards.|$|E

40|$|In the article, {{the author}} {{suggests}} an internal {{division of the}} <b>community</b> <b>codes,</b> regardless of their ethnic extent. She sets out from a critical presentation of functional divisions of Polish which have been advanced so far, and which rely on the structural perception of language. Demonstrating their inadequacy and the frequent modifications, the author draws on the sociolinguistic theories of B. Bernstein, ethnolinguistic concepts of Sapir-Whorf and the philosophical notions of W. Humboldt and J. G. Herder {{in order to show}} that the cultural factor should be the basis of distinguishing between internal <b>community</b> <b>codes.</b> 	She also draws attention to the universalisation of the <b>community</b> <b>codes</b> which, due to globalisation processes, begin to function on the boundaries of ethnic languages. 	The author concludes that <b>codes</b> used in <b>community</b> communication of populations isolated not only through linguistic analyses but most of all in the course of cultural differentiation, include, apart from the verbal signs, all other signs which serve the communication within the community. Consequently, they may be identified with the functional variant of ethnic language only within the field of verbal transmission. However, when they become universal and go beyond the limits of ethnic codes as well as trigger communication on all semiotic levels, they become one of the communication codes which typologize social communication within defined cultures and at their boundaries. The author collected the most important findings concerning the internal diversification of the ethnic language (using Polish as an example) and, treating those concepts as a starting point, set out to present the contemporary universal linguistic, discursive and communicative communities. While stressing the high diversification of <b>codes</b> within the <b>communities,</b> the author returns to the rhetorical, adequately defined concept of three styles. In her description of the <b>code</b> of communicative <b>community,</b> the author draws a reference to the communal nature of rendering the image of the world and highlights its intersemiotic, supraethnic and universal character. 943553 Studia Europaea Gnesnensi...|$|R
