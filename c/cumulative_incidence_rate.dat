DESIGN: Multinational cohort study with joint database analysis. SETTING: Seven primary HPV screening studies in six European countries. PARTICIPANTS: 24, 295 women attending cervical screening enrolled into HPV screening trials who {{had at least one}} cervical cytology or histopathology examination during follow-up. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Long term cumulative incidence of CIN 3 +. RESULTS: The <b>cumulative</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>rate</b> of CIN 3 + after six years was considerably lower among women negative for HPV at baseline (0. 27 %, 95 % confidence interval 0. 12 % to 0. 45 %) than among women with negative results on cytology (0. 97 %, 0. 53 % to 1. 34 %)). By comparison, the <b>cumulative</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>rate</b> for women with negative cytology results at the most commonly recommended screening interval in Europe (three years) was 0. 51 % (0. 23 % to 0. 77 %). The <b>cumulative</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>rate</b> among women with negative cytology results who were positive for HPV increased continuously over time, reaching 10 % at six years, whereas the rate among women with positive cytology results who were negative for HPV remained below 3 %. CONCLUSIONS: A consistently low six year <b>cumulative</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>rate</b> of CIN 3 + among women negative for HPV suggests that cervical screening strategies in which women are screened for HPV every six years are safe and effective...|$|E

In this study, multilevel temporal Bayesian networks were adopted to study {{the course of}} multimorbidity in the expectation that this would yield new clinical insight. Study Design and Setting: Clinical data of patients were extracted from 90 general practice registries in the Netherlands. One and half million patient-years were used for analysis. The simultaneous progression of six chronic cardiovascular conditions was investigated, correcting for both patient and practice-related variables. Results: <b>Cumulative</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>rates</b> {{of one or more}} new morbidities rapidly increase with the number of morbidities present at baseline, ranging up to 47 % and 76 % for 3 - and 5 -year follow-ups, respectively.

40|$|What is the {{effectiveness}} of continued treatment with clomiphene citrate (CC) in women with World Health Organization (WHO) type II anovulation who {{have had at least}} six ovulatory cycles with CC but did not conceive? When women continued CC after six treatment cycles, the <b>cumulative</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>rate</b> of the ongoing pregnancy rate was 54 % (95 % CI 37 - 78 %) for cycles 7 - 12. If women with WHO type II anovulation fail to conceive with CC within six ovulatory cycles, guidelines advise switching to gonadotrophins, which have a high risk of multiple gestation and are expensive. It is however not clear what success rate could be achieved by continued treatment with CC. We performed a retrospective cohort study of women with WHO II anovulation who visited the fertility clinics of five hospitals in the Netherlands between 1994 and 2010. We included women treated with CC who had had at least six ovulatory cycles without successful conception (n = 114) after which CC was continued using dosages varying from 50 to 150 mg per day for 5 days.

Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, documents of 6363 TB patients identified in Khuzestan province at the beginning of 2005 until the end of the September of 2012 were assessed and sampling method was census. The data was gathered by TB-Register Center. TB incidence was evaluated by GIS maps according to climatic and vegetation with 1 : 25, 000 scale. The data was analyzed in SPSS software and means plot and Independent’s t-test, ANOVA with a significance level of less than 5 % and Eta Correlation. Results: Spread of Tuberculosis in climatic and vegetation were plotted in GIS maps, <b>cumulative</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>rate</b> was calculated separately for each area. There was a statistical significant relationship between <b>cumulative</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>rate</b> of disease and climatic (P= 0. 017) and the Eta correlation coefficient was 0. 379 (P= 0. 011).

40|$|AbstractHealthcare {{professionals}} {{have a high}} risk of needlestick and sharps injuries (NSIs), which have a high potential for disease transmission. Ambulatory care follow up is essential, but is usually overlooked. This study aimed to investigate the annual and cumulative (age-, sex-, and subtype-specific) incidences of ambulatory care visits after NSIs. This study was also designed to evaluate the incidences of blood-borne diseases associated with NSIs among Taiwanese health professionals in Taiwan between 2004 and 2010. Data were obtained from the National Health Insurance Research Database, which contains anonymized records representing approximately 99 % of the Taiwan population. A total of 4443 nurse healthcare workers (NHCWs) and 3138 non-nurse healthcare workers (NNHCWs), including physicians, medical technologists, and other health professionals were included in this longitudinal study. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. The Mantel-Haenszel method was used to adjust for sex, age, and type of affiliation. Results showed that the annual incidence of ambulatory care visits of NHCWs increased from 0. 7 % in 2004 to 1. 9 % in 2010; this incidence was significantly higher than that of NNHCWs (from 0. 3 % in 2004 to 0. 5 % in 2010) in any yearly comparison (p <  0. 05). The sex-adjusted 7 -year <b>cumulative</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>rate</b> was 3. 23 (95 % CI =  1. 23 – 8. 45) in males and 3. 92 (95 % CI =  2. 70 – 5. 69) in females (p <  0. 05). The age-adjusted 7 -year <b>cumulative</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>rate</b> was 2. 74 (95 % CI =  1. 99 – 3. 77) and 2. 14 (95 % CI =  1. 49 – 3. 07) in subjects ≤  30 and ≥ 31 years old, respectively (p <  0. 0005). The affiliation-adjusted 7 -year <b>cumulative</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>rate</b> was 1. 89 (95 % CI =  1. 21 – 2. 94) in medical centers and 3. 33 (95 % CI =  2. 51 – 4. 41) in nonmedical centers (p <  0. 01). In conclusion, NSIs increased steadily from 2004 to 2010 in Taiwan with NHCWs having higher NSIs incidences than NNHCWs. A routine ambulatory care visit after NSIs can prevent blood-borne transmission, especially for NHCWs. Educational programs may be helpful for reducing the incidence of NSIs and increasing ambulatory care visit ratios after NSIs...|$|E

Of these 114 women, 35 (31 %) had an ongoing pregnancy resulting in a <b>cumulative</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>rate</b> of an ongoing pregnancy of 54 % after 7 - 12 treatment cycles with CC. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Limitations of our study are its retrospective approach. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Randomized trials comparing continued treatment with CC with the relatively established second line treatment with gonadotrophins are justified. In the meantime, we suggest to only begin this less convenient and more expensive treatment for women who do not conceive after 12 ovulatory cycles with CC. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTERESTS: None.

40|$|Background and Objectives: Influenza {{vaccination}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important ways to prevent influenza acquisition in healthcare staff. This study was conducted to determine the <b>cumulative</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>rate</b> of side effects associated with influenza vaccination among healthcare staff in some of the hospitals in Shiraz. Methods: This descriptive study was conducted on the staff of a number of hospitals in Shiraz who received influenza vaccine in 1392. Instrument in this study was a researcher-developed questionnaire about common side effects that was collected up to 10 days after the vaccination. Incidence of side effects was reported with 95 % confidence interval. The data were analyzed by chi-square test, Fisher's exact test, and univariate logistic regression. Results: From the 450 vaccinated staff, 424 (94. 23 %) completed the questionnaire. 53. 8 % of vaccine recipients were female and 46. 2 % male. The mean age of the participants was 34. 94 years.   Up to 10 days after vaccination, <b>cumulative</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>rate</b> of side effects following vaccination was obtained 21. 7 % for common cold-like symptoms, 71. 2 % for muscle pain, 16. 5 % for pain where the shot was given, 15. 3 % for fever, 14. 4 % for runny nose, 12. 3 % for severe headache, 9 % for severe coughing, 0. 9 % for diarrhea, and 1. 7 % for abdominal pain (1. 7 %). No severe side effects such as acute allergic reactions and Guillain-Barré syndrome were reported. Conclusion: The reported incidence rate of side effects in this study, high risk of acquiring disease among health care staff, and their role in controlling influenza epidemics represent the necessity of influenza vaccination in this occupational population...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: We {{compared}} {{efficacy of}} trastuzumab versus no trastuzumab {{in patients with}} small (≤ 2 cm) human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER 2) -positive breast cancer treated in randomized trials. Methods: A meta-analysis was conducted using data from {{five of the six}} adjuvant trastuzumab trials. Efficacy end points were disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Separate analyses were prospectively planned for hormone receptor (HR) -positive and HR-negative cohorts. Random effect models and Yusuf-Peto fixed effects models assessed the impact of heterogeneity on baseline hazards and treatment effects across studies. Peto-Pike <b>cumulative</b> <b>incidence</b> estimates were stratified by study and nodal status. Results: Median follow-up time was 8 years. For 2, 263 patients with HR-positive disease, 8 -year <b>cumulative</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>rates</b> comparing trastuzumab versus no trastuzumab were 17. 3 % versus 24. 3 % (P <. 001) for DFS and 7. 8 % versus 11. 6 % (P =. 005) for OS, respectively; for 1, 092 HR-positive patients with zero or one positive lymph nodes, results were 12. 7 % versus 19. 4 % (P =. 005) for DFS and 5. 3 % versus 7. 4 % (P =. 12) for OS, respectively. For 1, 957 patients with HR-negative disease, 8 -year <b>cumulative</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>rates</b> were 24. 0 % versus 33. 4 % (P <. 001) for DFS and 12. 4 % versus 21. 2 % (P <. 001) for OS, respectively; for 1, 040 HR-negative patients with zero or one positive lymph nodes, results were 20. 4 % versus 26. 3 % (P =. 05) for DFS and 8. 2 % versus 12. 2 % (P =. 084) for OS, respectively. Conclusion: Women with HER 2 -positive tumors ≤ 2 cm in the randomized trastuzumab trials derived substantial DFS and OS benefit from adjuvant trastuzumab. Trastuzumab-treated patients with HR-positive disease and ≤ one positive lymph node may be candidates for trials assessing less aggressive treatment approaches.

40|$|Purpose: New primary melanomas (NPMs) have {{developed}} {{in some patients}} with metastatic melanoma treated with BRAF inhibitors. We sought to determine the background incidence of spontaneous NPMs after a diagnosis of American Joint Committee on Cancer/International Union Against Cancer stage III or IV melanoma in patients not treated with a BRAF inhibitor. Patients and methods: Patients diagnosed with stage III or IV melanoma at Melanoma Institute Australia between 1983 and 2008 were analyzed, and those who received a BRAF inhibitor were excluded. Results: Two hundred twenty-nine (5 %) of 4, 215 patients with stage III melanoma and 43 (1 %) of 3, 563 patients with stage IV melanoma {{had at least one}} NPM after diagnosis of stage III or IV disease. The 6 -month, 1 -year, and 10 -year <b>cumulative</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>rates</b> of developing an NPM after stage III melanoma were 1. 2 % (95 % CI, 0. 86 % to 1. 51 %), 1. 8 % (95 % CI, 1. 44 % to 2. 26 %), and 5. 9 % (95 % CI, 5. 08 % to 6. 74 %), respectively. The 3 -month, 6 -month, and 1 -year <b>cumulative</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>rates</b> of NPM after diagnosis of stage IV melanoma were 0. 2 % (95 % CI, 0. 07 % to 0. 36 %), 0. 3 % (95 % CI, 0. 15 % to 0. 51 %), and 0. 4 % (95 % CI, 0. 25 % to 0. 7 %), respectively. In both patients with stage III and stage IV melanoma, male patients and patients with a prior history of multiple primaries had a higher incidence of NPM. Conclusion: Patients with stage III and stage IV melanoma remain at risk for development of further primary melanomas, particularly if they have a history of multiple primary melanomas before stage III or IV disease. The <b>incidence</b> <b>rates</b> are lower than those reported in patients receiving BRAF inhibitors. However, the results must be compared with caution because dermatologic assessment is more frequent in BRAF inhibitor trials. 8 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Relation of {{antiplatelet}} therapy (APT) discontinuation {{with the}} risk of serious cardiovascular events has not been fully addressed yet. This study is aimed to evaluate {{the risk of}} ischemic event after APT discontinuation based on long-term APT status of large cohort. In the CREDO-Kyoto Registry Cohort- 2 enrolling 15939 consecutive patients undergoing first coronary revascularization, 10470 patients underwent percutaneous coronary intervention either with bare-metal stents (BMS) only (N= 5392) or sirolimus-eluting stents (SES) only (N= 5078). Proportions of patients taking dual-APT were 67. 3 % versus 33. 4 % at 1 -year, and 48. 7 % versus 24. 3 % at 5 -year in the SES and BMS strata, respectively. We evaluated daily APT status (dual-, single- and no-APT) and linked the adverse events to the APT status just 1 -day before the events. No-APT as compared with dual- or single-APT was associated with significantly higher risk for stent thrombosis (ST) beyond 1 -month after SES implantation (<b>cumulative</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>rates</b> beyond 1 -month: 1. 23 versus 0. 15 / 0. 29, P< 0. 001 /P< 0. 001), while higher risk of no-APT for ST was evident only until 6 -month after BMS implantation (<b>incidence</b> <b>rates</b> between 1 - and 6 -month: 8. 43 versus 0. 71 / 1. 20, P< 0. 001 /P< 0. 001, and <b>cumulative</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>rates</b> beyond 6 -month: 0. 31 versus 0. 11 / 0. 08, P= 0. 16 /P= 0. 08). No-APT as compared with dual- or single-APT was also associated with significantly higher risk for spontaneous myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke regardless {{of the types of}} stents implanted. Single-APT as compared with dual-APT was not associated with higher risk for serious adverse events, except for the marginally higher risk for ST in the SES stratum. In conclusion, discontinuation of both aspirin and thienopyridines was associated with increased risk for serious cardiovascular events including ST, spontaneous MI and stroke beyond 1 -month after coronary stenting...|$|R

40|$|Context: Chronic {{hepatitis}} C virus (HCV) infection outcomes include liver failure, {{hepatocellular carcinoma}} (HCC), and liver-related death. Objective: To assess {{the association between}} sustained virological response (SVR) and all-cause mortality in patients with chronic HCV infection and advanced hepatic fibrosis. Design, Setting, and Patients: An international, multicenter, long-term follow-up study from 5 large tertiary care hospitals in Europe and Canada of 530 patients with chronic HCV infection who started an interferon-based treatment regimen between 1990 and 2003, following histological proof of advanced hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis (Ishak score 4 - 6). Complete follow-up ranged between January 2010 and October 2011. Main Outcome Measures: All-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were liver failure, HCC, and liver-related mortality or liver transplantation. Results: The 530 study patients were followed up for a median (interquartile range [IQR]) of 8. 4 (6. 4 - 11. 4) years. The baseline median (IQR) age was 48 (42 - 56) years and 369 patients (70 %) were men. The Ishak fibrosis score was 4 in 143 patients (27 %), 5 in 101 patients (19 %), and 6 in 286 patients (54 %). There were 192 patients (36 %) who achieved SVR; 13 patients with SVR and 100 without SVR died (10 -year cumulative all-cause mortality rate, 8. 9 % [95 % CI, 3. 3 %- 14. 5 %] with SVR and 26. 0 % [95 % CI, 20. 2 %- 28. 4 %] without SVR; P<. 001). In time-dependent multivariate Cox regression analysis, SVR was associated with reduced risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 0. 26; 95 % CI, 0. 14 - 0. 49; P<. 001) and reduced risk of liver-related mortality or transplantation (HR, 0. 06; 95 % CI, 0. 02 - 0. 19; P<. 001), the latter occurring in 3 patients with SVR and 103 without SVR. The 10 -year <b>cumulative</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>rate</b> of liver-related mortality or transplantation was 1. 9 % (95 % CI, 0. 0 %- 4. 1 %) with SVR and 27. 4 % (95 % CI, 22. 0 %- 32. 8 %) without SVR (P<. 001). There were 7 patients with SVR and 76 without SVR who developed HCC (10 -year <b>cumulative</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>rate,</b> 5. 1 %; 95 % CI, 1. 3 %- 8. 9 %; vs 21. 8 %; 95 % CI, 16. 6 %- 27. 0 %; P<. 001), and 4 patients with SVR and 111 without SVR experienced liver failure (10 -year <b>cumulative</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>rate,</b> 2. 1 %; 95 % CI, 0. 0 %- 4. 5 %; vs 29. 9 %; 95 % CI, 24. 3 %- 35. 5 %; P<. 001).

The <b>cumulative</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>rate</b> of sciatic pain was significantly higher among the reinforcement workers than the painters. As regards the occurrence of lumbago and non-specific back pain, however, the groups were alike. In both occupational groups sciatic pain during the previous 12 months was associated with earlier back accidents (odds ratio 2. 8, 95 % confidence interval 1. 8 - 4. 5).

40|$|Purpose: Cervical {{cytology}} {{and human}} papillomavirus (HPV) DNA co-testing is recommended as a screening method for detecting cervical lesions. However, {{for women who}} are HPV-positive but cytology-negative, the appropriate management and significance of HPV- 58 infection remain unknown. Methods: This study of prevalent HPV detected at baseline with a median follow-up of 3. 2 years evaluated the risk factors associated with cervical abnormalities and assessed the significance of HPV- 58 infection. A total of 265 women were enrolled. All high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) that were detected by cytology were confirmed by histology. Histological diagnoses of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 / 3 were classified as HSIL. Women were classified into four groups according to the HPV genotype that was detected at their first visit: HPV- 58 (n = 27), HPV- 16 (n = 52; 3 women had HPV- 58 co-infection), ten other high risk (HR) types (n = 79), or low/undetermined risk types (n = 107). Results: Of 265 women, 20 (7. 5 %) had HSIL on their follow-up examinations. There were significant differences in the <b>cumulative</b> <b>incidence</b> of HSIL between the four groups (p, 0. 001).
