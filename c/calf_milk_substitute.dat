40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of protein sources for milk replacers on growth performance and serum biochemical indexes of suckling calves. Fifty Chinese Holstein bull calves with similar BW and age were randomly allocated to 5 groups (1 control and 4 treatments) of 10 calves in each group. Five types of milk replacers were designed {{to have the same}} level of energy and protein. The protein source for milk replacers of the control group was full milk protein (MP). The protein source of milk replacers of the 4 treatment groups was composed of MP and one vegetable protein (VP) (30 and 70 % of total protein). The 4 types of VP were soybean protein concentrate (SP), hydrolyzed wheat protein (WP), peanut protein concentrate (PP), and rice protein isolate (RP). Results of the experiment showed: 1) {{there was no significant difference}} on average daily gain (ADG) and feed:gain ratio (F:G) among the MP, SP and RP groups (P >  0. 05), whereas the ADG and F:G of the WP and PP groups were significantly lower compared with the MP group (P    0. 05). Thereby the 4 VP milk replacers had no adverse effects on body size of calves; 3) all groups showed no significant difference in the serum contents of urea nitrogen, total protein, albumin, globulin, β-hydroxybutyrate, growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor- 1, and the ratio of albumin to globulin (A:G) (P >  0. 05). In conclusion, SP or RP (accounts for 70 % of the total protein) as <b>calf</b> <b>milk</b> replacers could <b>substitute</b> MP, whereas wheat gluten and PP had a significant adverse effect on growth performance in this experiment...|$|R

A screening of 17 different commercial plant-based <b>milk</b> <b>substitutes</b> based on different cereals, nuts and legumes was performed, including {{the evaluation of}} physicochemical and glycaemic properties. Half of the analysed samples had low or no protein contents (< 0. 5 %). Only samples based on soya showed considerable high protein contents, matching the value of cow’s milk (3. 7 %). An in-vitro method was used to predict the glycaemic index. In general, the glycaemic index values ranged from 47 for bovine milk to 64 (almond-based) and up to 100 for rice-based samples.

Experimental milk replacers were formulated to contain whey protein concentrate (WPC) as the pri-mary protein source orWPCplus 5 % spray-dried bovine plasma (SDBP) or spray-dried porcine plasma (SDPP). The SDPP was heated to remove heat-insoluble materi-als and provide products with similar IgG content. Calves were also fed commercial calf starter and water for ad libitum consumption. Intake, change in body weight (BW), feed efficiency, morbidity and mortality were determined. Mortality was 10, 3, and 2 in calves fed WPC, SDBP, and SDPP treatments, respectively. Morbidity, measured {{as the number of}} days that calves had diarrhea was reduced by 30 %when SDBP or SDPP were fed. Calves had diarrhea for 6. 9, 3. 9, and 4. 7 d during the 42 -d study when fed commercial <b>calf</b> <b>milk</b> replacer containing WPC, SDBP, and SDPP, respec-tively.

The purpose of the investigation was to make assumptions about the future situation of farmers and which demographic, personal, sociological, cultural and psychological determinants {{have an impact on}} Swedish consumers purchasing substitute products. The proposed methodology to reveal the impact of those factors was a qualitative research. Ten semi-structured interviews with residents of Västra Götaland, aimed to gain a deeper and better understanding of the reasons for consumption of <b>milk</b> <b>substitute</b> products, were conducted in total. The existing theory and scientific articles about demographic, personal, sociological, cultural and psychological determinants of consumer behavior, in terms of food choice and consumption, were used to create an interview guide and also to compare the collected primary data in the end. Participants were asked questions regarding their demography, lifestyle, awareness and perception of <b>milk</b> <b>substitute</b> products and other reasons for their consumption of <b>milk</b> <b>substitutes.</b> The findings revealed that demographic factors such as age and gender seemed {{to have an impact on}} the consumer behavior. Moreover, personal and psychological factors were revealed to have a significant impact on the consumption behavior. In particular lifestyle, perception, attitudes and motivations, knowledge and learning had a significant influence on Swedish consumers and their food consumption behavior. Regarding sociological factors it was discovered that friends had a significant influence on food consumption. Cultural determinants were also important to consider. However, they did not have a significant influence on the participants. The findings also revealed that health and animal welfare were the main reasons for changing the consumption. Interestingly, no participant started to consume these products due to environmental reasons in the beginning. The strong competition of <b>milk</b> and <b>milk</b> <b>substitute</b> products on the market is most likely to continue.
