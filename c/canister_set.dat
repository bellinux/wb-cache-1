5000|$|The {{objective}} of Rip-Off {{is to prevent}} computer-controlled enemies from stealing eight <b>canisters</b> <b>set</b> {{in the center of}} the screen. One or two players control tank-like vehicles while game-controlled [...] "pirate" [...] tanks rush onto the field and attempt to drag the canisters off the edge of the screen. Enemies can be defeated by shooting or colliding with them. The game speed and difficulty increase with each successive wave until all the canisters have been taken ("ripped off").|$|R
5000|$|In the late-1960s, Chein {{entered into}} a {{licensing}} agreement to produce [...] "Peanuts" [...] characters, which continued through the early-1970s. In the mid-1970s, Chein sold its Renwal division and focused upon manufacturing lithographed sheet steel housewares such as kitchen <b>canister</b> <b>sets</b> and wastebaskets, under the brand Cheinco. They also produced licensed metal containers for food brands such as Heinz, Sunkist and Maxwell House. In 1979, toy manufacturing was phased out entirely. In the late-1980s, Cheinco was sold to the Atlantic Can Company, who then {{changed its name to}} Atlantic Cheinco Corporation. The company was beset with manufacturing problems resulting from environmental issues which in 1992 resulted in them filing for bankruptcy protection. Atlantic Cheinco's assets were then purchased by Ellisco of Pennsylvania, which was a division of CSS Industries. In 1994, CSS then sold Ellisco to the Baltimore-based U.S. Can Company, who continue to produce stamped metal products.|$|R

Finally, he made a start at the teapot, gustily rattled a quantity of tea into it from a <b>canister,</b> and <b>set</b> off for the common kitchen to fill it with hot water.|$|R
40|$|To {{ensure the}} safe {{disposal}} of spent fuel in Sweden, SKB {{is planning to}} use the copper-iron canister in a granitic deep geological repository, surrounded by a compacted bentonite engineered barrier. In order to develop {{a deeper understanding of}} the internal corrosion behaviour of the design should a leak occur in the outer copper <b>canister,</b> a <b>set</b> of model <b>canisters</b> was <b>set</b> up in the Äspöunderground laboratory in contact with bentonite with a range of densities. The environmental conditions and electrochemical corrosion behaviour were monitored using a range of techniques. Water analysis and electrochemical measurements indicated an increase in the corrosion rate of both iron and copper in contact with low density bentonite, and of iron only in experiments with no bentonite present. This behaviour may be attributable to microbial activity. The measured corrosion rate depends on the technique used and it will be necessary to confirm the measurements by removal and examination of weight loss coupons. © 2011 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining...|$|R
5000|$|On {{election}} day, {{there were}} incidents and clashes with police, after extremists raided several polling stations and spoiled votes. Staff were assaulted, ballot boxes smashed, and tear gas <b>canisters</b> <b>set</b> off. This disruption caused the elections to be annulled in three polls in northern Mitrovica, repeated on November 17. The government of Serbia had encouraged Serbs in North Kosovo {{to participate in}} the elections, but this violence undermined attempts to normalise relations between the two governments.According to the OSCE the voter turnout was 22% in Leposavić, 22% in Zubin Potok and 11.21% in Zvečan.Oliver Ivanović called for the results in the northern four municipalities to be annulled.Following Foreign Minister Enver Hoxhaj declarations that [...] "the mayors in the north should be of Serbian ethnicity", the Albanian opposition accused the government and DPK for having intentionally facilitated the defeat of Albanian candidates for the sake of stimulating the Serbian citizens in the north, despite their low voter turnout.|$|R
5000|$|At a {{time when}} posters were a popular form of advertising, Bouisset created posters with {{enduring}} images {{for a number of}} different French food companies such as Maggi and Lefèvre-Utile For the latter company, he used their LU initials as an ad logo as part of an 1897 poster image for a line of butter biscuits featuring [...] "The Little Schoolboy" [...] (French: Petit Ecolier) of which a variation is still being used by the company today. However, Firmin Bouisset is probably most famous for his posters for the French chocolate manufacturer, Menier. Contracted by the company in 1892, Bouisset used his daughter Yvonne as a model to create what became an iconic image of a little girl using a piece of chocolate to write the company's name. The drawing was featured on a great many of the Menier company's advertisements and on its packaged products as well as on promotional items such as creamers, bowls, sugar dishes, plates, <b>canister</b> <b>sets,</b> ashtrays, thermometers, key chains, and even children's exercise books.|$|R
5000|$|In 1893 {{the company}} began using {{advertising}} posters created by Firmin Bouisset featuring a little girl using a piece of chocolate to write the name Chocolat Menier on a wall or window. The small girl's sweet innocence conveyed the sweet chocolate message through her [...] "chocolate graffiti". It {{proved to be a}} highly successful image and became an internationally recognized symbol. Firmin Bouisset's image of the little girl would be featured on Menier's packaged products as well as on promotional items such as reusable tin ware, creamers, bowls, sugar dishes, plates, <b>canister</b> <b>sets,</b> and even children's exercise books. Original Menier posters and assorted products as well as reproductions are still much in demand today.As part of its sales strategy, Menier introduced small dark chocolate sticks to be inserted into a piece of bread. To raise their profile and sell more product, on sidewalks in towns and cities all over France, the company set up [...] "chocolate kiosques". Their hexagon shape and peaked roof became the standard for newspaper kiosques. Such was their popularity that for children, the company made plastic model kiosks as toy dispensers filled with tiny chocolate bars.|$|R
50|$|The View-Master Personal Stereo Camera was a {{35mm film}} camera {{designed}} to take 3D stereo photos for viewing in a View-Master. First released in 1952, the camera took 69 pairs of photos on a 36 exposure roll 35mm film, taking one set while the film was unwound from the <b>canister,</b> and another <b>set</b> while it was rewound. Although focus was fixed, the camera supported both variable aperture settings and shutter speeds.|$|R

Posing {{as a crime}} boss {{in the real world}} as Stephen Lords, Deathwatch plotted to destroy New York City through a {{poisonous}} toxin. After a youth gang called the Cypress Hill Jokers unwittingly stole the canisters containing the biotoxin, Deathwatch contested with the Kingpin for the <b>canisters,</b> and <b>set</b> Blackout against the new Ghost Rider.
