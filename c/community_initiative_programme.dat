40|$|In den letzten Jahrzenten hat sich die Rolle, die zivilgesellschaftliche Organisationen in internationaler Entwicklungshilfe spielen, signifikant verändert. Während zivilgesellschaftliche Organisationen jahrzentelang in internationaler Entwicklungspolitik nur als passive Beobachter toleriert wurden, sind sie in den letzten Jahren zunehmend als wichtige Akteure und ernstzunehmende Interessensvertreter der internationalen Entwicklungspolitik und der politischen Mobilisierung in den Vordergrund gerückt. Diese Entwicklung hat aber nicht nur die allgemeine Rolle der groβen und heterogenen Gruppe zivilgesellschaftlicher Organisationen in internationaler Entwicklungshilfe stark verändert; sie hat auch auf die Entwicklung und Kontributionen von Gemeinschaftsorganisationen, welche die kleinsten Akteure dieser Familie sind, eine grosse Wirkung ausgeübt. Anhand von drei theoretischen Konzepten aus der modernen Entwicklungstheorie – der Governance Theorie, dem Zusammenhang zwischen Armutsreduzierung, Governance und der Wirksamkeit der Entwicklungshilfe, sowie des auf Menschenrechten basierenden Ansatzes zur internationalen Entwicklung - werden in dieser Dissertation die Entwicklung und die Beiträge von Gemeinschaftsinitiativen und Entwicklungshilfsprogrammen, die Gemeinschaftsinitiativen global oder {{regional}} verwalten, in Bezug auf das Erreichen konkreter Hauptziele der modernen Entwicklungshilfe analysiert. Nach einer geschichtlichen Analyse der Entwicklung zivilgesellschaftlicher Organisationen - mit besonderem Fokus auf Gemeinschaftsorganisationen – werden die Characteristica der Wirksamkeitsbewegung in der Entwicklungshilfe und die Prioritäten internationaler Entwicklungshilfe zum Anfang des 21. Jahrhunderts aufgezeigt und interpretiert. Die Funktionen, Vorteile und Defizite isolierter Gemeinschaftsinitiativen werden sodann erleutert, um danach das Konzept der Koordinierung von Gemeinschaftsinitiativen vorzustellen, welches am Beispiel des GEF Small Grants Programme illustriert wird. Zuletzt werden vier Schlüsselkonzeptgruppen, die besonders die moderne Entwicklungshilfe prägen, vorgestellt und für eine empirische Analyse des GEF Small Grants Programmes verwendet. Bei diesen vier Schlüsselkonzeptgruppen handelt es sich um: 1) Transparenz und Accountability, 2) Nachhaltigkeit, 3) Governance und 4) Effizienz und Effektivität. Die empirische Analyse zeigt, dass Gemeinschaftsinitiativen insbesondere dann wichtige Beiträge in den vier Schlüsselkonzeptgruppen leisten, wenn sie in ein Entwicklungshilfsprogramm eingebettet sind, das Gemeinschaftsinitiativen nach Standards und Prinzipien verwaltet, die in dieser Arbeit konkretisiert werden. Anhand der Daten kann überdies gesehen werden, daβ die Nische der Gemeinschaftsinitiativen insbesondere im Bereich der lokalen Governance liegt. Unabhängig von dem thematischen Ziel der Gemeinschaftsinitiativen, das in verschiedenstenden Bereichen liegen kann (z. B. in den Bereichen Umweltschutz, öffentliche Gesundheit, etc.), bringen Gemeinschaftsinitiativen automatisch positive Externalitäten hervor, die lokale Governanceprozesse aufbauen und stärken. Dies geschieht allerdings nur wenn die Entscheidungsfreiheit der Gemeinschaft und die Prinzipien der Accountability, Transparenz, Effizienz, Effektivität, Ownership, und die Notwendigkeit der Co-finanzierung und des Aufbauens von Partnerschaften aufrecht erhalten werden. Trotz der Tatsache, daβ diese Dissertation einem multi-dimensionalen Ansatz zugrunde liegt und ein Ergebnis sowohl politikwissenschaftlicher als auch sozio-ökonomischer Elemente ist, liegt der Schwerpunkt dieser Arbeit im Bereich der Governance Theory, mit besonderem Fokus auf der Rolle von Gemeinschaftsorganisationen im Bereich der internationalen Entwicklungshilfe. dissertation {{seeks to}} analyze the role and contribution of <b>community</b> <b>initiatives</b> and <b>community</b> <b>initiative</b> coordination <b>programmes</b> in the current context of international development cooperation. It also questions {{whether there is a}} specific niche for <b>community</b> <b>initiatives</b> in international development cooperation. Over the past decades, the role of civil society in international development has noticeably evolved. From having been considered a mere by-stander of international development efforts, civil society has become a recognized stakeholder in both socio-economic efforts as well as in political mobilization. While this development has forged the general role of global civil society in international development cooperation, it has also influenced the evolution and contributions of community organizations, the smallest actor of the big family of civil society organizations. Three key concepts set the theoretic and conceptual framework within which this research is embedded: governance theory, the interdependence between poverty reduction, aid effectiveness and governance, and the rights-based approach to development. These concepts are being applied to examine the evolution and contributions of <b>community</b> <b>initiatives</b> and <b>community</b> <b>initiative</b> coordination <b>programmes</b> to the current objectives of international development cooperation. A historic analysis of the evolution of civil society and particularly community organizations culminates in the new millennium and then focuses on the specifics of the aid effectiveness movement coupled with key priorities of international development cooperation {{in the beginning of the}} 21 st century. After an in-depth analysis of functions, advantages, and limitations of isolated <b>community</b> <b>initiatives,</b> the concept of <b>community</b> <b>initiative</b> coordination is introduced and illustrated in the form of the GEF Small Grants Programme. Lastly, four key concepts and priorities, which particularly distinguish the current era of international development cooperation, are being analyzed through use of empiric evidence gathered from the GEF Small Grants Programme and its projects. These concept groups are 1) transparency and accountability, 2) sustainability, 3) governance and, lastly, 4) efficiency and effectiveness. Empiric evidence assembled in this dissertation demonstrates that <b>community</b> <b>initiatives</b> will contribute to all four above-mentioned concept groups when embedded into well-functioning <b>community</b> <b>initiative</b> coordination <b>programmes,</b> which adhere to the principles and standards identified in this document. The various elements necessary to achieve these results are being outlined and theorized. The fundamental discovery of this dissertation is that the niche of <b>community</b> <b>initiatives</b> lies in the area of local governance. In fact, independently of the overall topic of focus – be it in the area of public health, environmental protection, etc. – the building and strengthening of inclusive local governance processes is always an automatic by-product of <b>community</b> <b>initiatives</b> as long as their community-driven character is ensured and as long as the principles and requirements of accountability, transparency, effectiveness, efficiency, ownership, co-financing and partnership building are upheld. Due to the necessities of community-drivenness and ownership, this result in the area of local governance building cannot be produced by larger, non-community-driven, development projects. Though this dissertation uses a multi-dimensional approach and is a product of political science and socio-economic elements, its key emphasis and contribution lies in the area of governance theory, with a particular focus on the role of community organizations and local initiatives in the context of international development. ...|$|R

40|$|This neo {{institutional}} study analyses {{the dynamic}} interaction between formal/informal rules and agents’ behaviour inside a political institution, examining these relationships through primary research on local partnerships in Greece. The theoretical assumptions {{of this analysis}} derive mainly from normative neo institutionalism but also include insights from rational choice and the historical institutionalism. Consideration is also given {{to the way in}} which theories of the structure/agent duality are related to neo institutional propositions on the relationship between rules and agents’ strategic behaviour. The neo institutional approach to local partnerships is also situated in relation to concepts and empirical observations from the literature on urban governance, urban regimes and Europeanisation. This research adopts the critical realism stance which acknowledges a reflexive approach to reality and it applies an embedded case study strategy. The case study consists of two local partnerships in the region of Crete, which were established under the EU <b>Community</b> <b>Initiatives</b> <b>Programmes</b> EQUAL II and LEADER+ and coordinated by the Local Development Agency of Heraklion. A triangulation method is selected, making use of interviews, storytelling, a short questionnaire, direct observation and secondary analysis of documentation. The research data reveal that the formal rules of the partnerships are not indicative of what actually happens. It is the configuration of formal and informal rules that offers a deep understanding of partnership. It is concluded that some formal rules are realised (albeit with deviations along the way), like partnership and programming, while others are remained mostly on paper, like community participation, decentralisation and innovation. In these cases, the informal rules appear to be conflicting with the formal rules, leading to different results than those expected. The research also shows the importance of agents' intentionality in the process of institutional change. Specific actors within the partnership, such as established local leaders and institutional entrepreneurs, select and reinforce particular features of formal rules that restrict partners’ freedom and promote values of efficiency within the partners. Moreover, the findings confirm a gradual changing of local policy making and an increase of local social capital. EQUAL II and LEADER+ partnerships create new possibilities for the empowerment and participation of new actors such as NGOs and vulnerable groups in the local policy-making process. They also promote the establishment of policy networks and enhance the development of collaborative learning processes (trust building and sharing understanding). Finally, they lead to the re-articulation of mayors-chief executives’ relationship inside local authorities and of central state’s position by creating new possibilities for broadening local authorities’ autonomy...|$|R

Leader ought to be a programme in which policies are devised according to the mode of participation (although there is some ambiguity in the often interchangeable use of the terms “partnership” and “participation”); Leader initiatives develop (and sometimes invent) local resources; they are integrated and multisectorial, innovative and experimental, effective and transferable examples of good practices and, of course, sustainable; moreover, the communities involved inevitably should focus their attention on local development, not in a spirit of inward-looking isolationism but rather as part of transnational networks designed to foster the spread of innovation.

Commissioned by the UK Resources Centre for Women in Science, Engineering and Technology this project is investigating gendered representations of STEM on UK television, and the impact of these portrayals on young people's perceptions of STEM. In this paper we provide an outline of our data collection methods, and the quantitative and qualitative methods we have employed to analyse television output for two one-week samples. In presenting some early findings from our analyses we provide a quantitative overview of the first one-week sample of STEM output. We also introduce illustrative quantitative and qualitative findings from one of the genre - news and current affairs – in terms of the gender distribution, roles of the speakers, and emerging themes. The implications of these early findings are briefly discussed alongside suggestions for further work.

The algorithm makes use of the multispectral capabilities and the increased resolution of the new sensor on board the Meteosat Second Generation satellites. The present version of the algorithm provides rain maps in five rainrate levels, at 5 km of spatial resolution and 15 minutes of time resolution. It is tested and validated over U. K. area and for summer and winter season by using the Met Office Nimrod radar precipitation maps as ground truth. Performance are evaluated by calculating the Equitable Threat Score (ETS) and BIAS for rain – no rain classification. The algorithm performances strongly depend upon {{the characteristics of the}} training dataset, such as season, climatic regime and latitude: to export the technique on a given target area is thus highly recommended to train the ANN with data from that area. In the frame of an EU <b>Community</b> <b>initiative</b> <b>programme</b> INTERREG III B ARCHIMED the focus of the project RiskMed are the Central and Western Mediterranean areas, where a reliable, high-resolution, ground radar based precipitation dataset, large enough to train the ANN, is not available.

40|$|Uglem, I., Perez Benavente, G. and Browne R. A {{regional}} development strategy for stock enhancement of clawed lobsters (Homarus gammarus); development of juvenile lobster produc-tion methodologies. NINA Report 211, 39 pp. European lobsters (Homarus gammarus) are a highly prized and gastronomically appreciated marine organism. As {{a result of}} intense fishing pressure lobster landings have declined considerably in many European regions. This decrease has been particularly dramatic in the southern and northern areas of Europe. Releases of artificially raised lobster juveniles {{have been shown to}} have the potential to contribute to re-establishment or enhancement of depleted lobster stocks. However, one of the key problems for successful stock enhancement has been the lack of cost effective methodologies for producing juveniles. After the planktonic stage of their life cycle, the total length of the European lobster ranges from 1. 5 to 2 cm. These small early benthic stage animals are extremely vulnerable to predation if released directly into the sea. For this reason it is thought important to rear the lobsters to a length of at least 4 to 5 cm before they are released into the wild in an effort to increase their chances of survival. The purpose of this project was to develop and improve existing methodologies used to produce viable lobster juveniles that are fit for release into the wild. This project {{was a part of the}} AquaReg programme within the framework of the <b>Community</b> <b>initiative</b> <b>programme</b> INTERREG IIIC and it began in 2004. The methodologies used both in the hatchery setting and field were based on rearing the juveniles from metamorphosis until a suitable size for release either in individual compartments suspended from mussel rafts (sea cages or baskets) or communally in natural seawater. Both of these culture techniques involved the postlarval lobsters feeding on naturally occurring plankton and epibiotic fouling organisms. The results demonstrate that survival to a size suitable for release is high when rearing lobsters in suspended baskets (oyster cages). The lobsters also grew well both in sea cage based culture and in communal rearing, despite the fact that lobsters cultured in submerged cages in the open sea were not fed artificial feed during the course of the study. The methodologies developed represents a cost-effective way of producing lobster juveniles for re-establishment or enhancement efforts, since labour expense, constructions and feeding costs are minimized and the production efficiency is high...|$|E
40|$|The Irish Sea Marine Aggregates Initiative (IMAGIN) is a {{collaborative}} project between Ireland and Wales {{focused on the}} sustainable management of marine aggregate resources. IMAGIN was a 2 -year project with a total budget of € 1. 1 million. IMAGIN was part funded (66 %) under the Ireland/Wales Inter Regional (INTERREG) IIIA <b>Community</b> <b>Initiative</b> <b>Programme</b> 2000 - 2006. The remaining project budget was met by contributions from partner organisations (19 %) and aggregate companies – CEMEX, Lagan Ltd., Kilsaran Concrete and Roadstone Ltd. (15 %). The IMAGIN grouping was {{a collaborative}} partnership comprising experts in Ireland and Wales from 3 rd level Institutes, State agencies and industry. The grouping included the Coastal and Marine Resources Centre – University College Cork, Marine Institute, Geological Survey of Ireland, Geoscience Wales and representatives from the aggregate companies. The overall aim of the IMAGIN project is to facilitate {{the evolution of a}} strategic framework within which the exploitation of marine aggregate resources from the Irish Sea may be sustainably managed with minimum risk of impact on marine and coastal environments, ecosystems and other marine users. IMAGIN was structured around a series of work packages, each focusing on the different aspects of the marine aggregate question. Marine aggregates can be defined as sedimentary material - sand or gravel of various grain and class sizes (grades). Extraction of marine aggregates typically involves dredging of the deposit to remove it from the seabed. Aggregates may be screened at sea before being transported to a port or wharf facility for unloading and then further processing, if required, and subsequent transportation. In common with terrestrial aggregates, sands and gravels sourced from the seabed are an important economic resource, which can contribute to the development and maintenance of infrastructure, e. g. buildings, roads and bridges. Marine aggregates are also used for beach nourishment and coastal defence purposes, the demands for which have become more pressing when set against the predicted implications of climate change, sea level rise and associated effects on low lying coastal areas. A number of countries have sought to meet the demand for aggregates by utilising sources from the seabed to replace or complement terrestrial sources. Belgium, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom are primary examples of countries within Europe that have a long established practice of marine aggregate extraction, providing an alternative to sole reliance on terrestrial sources.
