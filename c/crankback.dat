40|$|Multi-domain traffic {{engineering}} {{is a very}} challenging problem area and <b>crankback</b> signaling offers a very promising solutions framework herein. Although some initial <b>crankback</b> studies have been done, there is still significant latitude for improving multi-domain <b>crankback</b> performance. Along these lines, this paper studies realistic IP/MPLS multi-domain networks and proposes a novel solution for joint intra/interdomain signaling <b>crankback.</b> Namely, dynamic intra-domain link-state routing information is coupled with available inter-domain path/distance vector routing state to improve the overall search process. Mechanisms are also introduced to limit <b>crankback</b> overheads and delays. The performance of the proposed solution is then analyzed using simulation and compared against hierarchical inter-domain routing strategies as well as another <b>crankback</b> scheme. ...|$|E
40|$|Network {{carriers}} and operators have built and deployed {{a very wide}} range of networking technologies to meet their customers’ needs. These include ultra scalable fibre-optic backbone networks based upon dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) solutions as well as advanced layer 2 / 3 IP multiprotocol label switching (MPLS) and Ethernet technologies as well. A range of networking control protocols has also been developed to implement service provisioning and management across these networks. As these infrastructures have been deployed, a range of new challenges have started to emerge. In particular, a major issue is that of provisioning connection services between networks running across different domain boundaries, e. g., administrative geographic, commercial, etc. As a result, many carriers are keenly interested {{in the design of}} multi-domain provisioning solutions and algorithms. Nevertheless, to date most such efforts have only looked at pre-configured, i. e., static, inter-domain route computation or more complex solutions based upon hierarchical routing. As such there is significant scope in developing more scalable and simplified multi-domain provisioning solutions. Moreover, it is here that <b>crankback</b> signaling offers much promise. <b>Crankback</b> makes use of active messaging techniques to compute routes in an iterative manner and avoid problematic resource-deficient links. However very few multi-domain <b>crankback</b> schemes have been proposed, leaving much room for further investigation. Along these lines, this thesis proposes <b>crankback</b> signaling solution for multi-domain IP/MPLS and DWDM network operation. The scheme uses a joint intra/inter-domain signaling strategy and is fully-compatible with the standardized resource reservation (RSVP-TE) protocol. Furthermore, the proposed solution also implements and advanced next-hop domain selection strategy to drive the overall <b>crankback</b> process. Finally the whole framework assumes realistic settings in which individual domains have full internal visibility via link-state routing protocols, e. g., open shortest path first traffic engineering (OSPF-TE), but limited “next-hop” inter-domain visibility, e. g., as provided by inter-area or inter-autonomous system (AS) routing protocols. The performance of the proposed <b>crankback</b> solution is studied using software-based discrete event simulation. First, a range of multi-domain topologies are built and tested. Next, detailed simulation runs are conducted for a range of scenarios. Overall, the findings show that the proposed <b>crankback</b> solution is very competitive with hierarchical routing, in many cases even outperforming full mesh abstraction. Moreover the scheme maintains acceptable signaling overheads (owing to it dual inter/intra domain <b>crankback</b> design) and also outperforms existing multi-domain <b>crankback</b> algorithms.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose an {{enhanced}} path selection algorithm for ATM networks that implement the Private Network-Node Interface (PNNI) v 1. 0 standard. Our enhancement {{stems from the fact}} that we consider delay in determining the appropriate route for an ATM call. The paper presents two new path selection algorithms based on two different delay accumulation methods, namely the simple (additive) method, and the asymptotic method. The delay based path selection algorithm is achieved by adopting a constrained shortest path algorithm which optimizes two metrics simultaneously in contrast to Dijkstra's algorithm that optimizes only one. The execution times of these two algorithms are also compared and quantified based on the results of an experimental study. Using an analytical model we demonstrate the performance gain by adopting a delay-based routing procedure in simple network configurations in terms of number of <b>crankbacks.</b> Our network configurations and traffic loading patterns showed that up to 36 % less <b>crankbacks</b> can be obtained when adopting a delay-sensitive routing scheme as opposed to a simple shortest-path algorithm...|$|R

40|$|When an ATM node {{discovers that}} it cannot {{continue}} the setup of a virtual channel under the requested Quality of Service (QoS), it initiates a backtracking procedure called “crankback. ” We propose a novel scheme, {{referred to as}} <b>crankback</b> prediction, that decreases the <b>crankback</b> overhead.

40|$|The goal of routing in a {{telecommunications}} network is to distribute user traffic from {{in a network}} of sources and destinations {{in accordance with the}} traffic's service requirements and subject to the network's resource restriction. Objectives of routing scheme include maximizing the network performance, such as larger carried load, fewer blockings and fewer crankbacks, while minimizing the cost, such as fewer trunk groups and fewer intermediate tandems. Constraints are imposed by the limitations of trunk resources, user traffic, and the network services provided and user services requested. Mean field and Monte Carlo computer simlutaions programmes are built according to the queueing theory and telecommunication engineering theory. Several traffic processes, such as blockings, <b>crankback</b> and overflow, and a variety of traffic profiles, topologies and structures are under investigation. We also develop a new software package TNSP (Telecom Network Simulation Package) to simulate various traffic conditions of East Kowloon telephone network of Hong Kong. As the network technologies evolve, enhanced routing methods are required to meet the dramatic demand of the growth of telecommunications services.

40|$|A mesh-restored lightpath in {{an optical}} network has a primary route and a {{diversely}} routed backup route. The wavelength channels on the primary route of a mesh-restored lightpath are dedicated for that lightpath whereas the wavelength channels on the backup route are shared among different mesh-restored lightpaths. Wavelength channels are shared {{in a way}} that ensures restoration of all lightpaths affected by any single link failure. In the centralized scenario, complete knowledge of the network state allows determination of the sharability of a backup channel during path computation. This information is not available in the distributed scenario. Use of 1 + 1 routing algorithms for mesh-restored lightpaths leads to inefficient capacity sharing. We propose distributed routing techniques to decrease the capacity efficiency gap between centralized routing and 1 + 1 routing of mesh-restored lightpaths. The algorithm uses information about the number of available and (shared) backup channels in a link, which can be disseminated through traffic engineering extensions [9, 10] to OSPF [8]. A sharing database at each OXC maintains information about the lightpaths whose primary or backup paths traverse that OXC. The approach involves distributed determination of the sharability of a link on the backup path during path signaling using the sharing database at each OXC on the backup path.

40|$|Wireline {{backbone}} {{networks have}} evolved to support many different end-user bandwidth services, including private leased lines, packet voice, high-definition packet video, virtual private networks (VPN), etc. From a functional perspective, these networks are usually comprised of different technology layers and segmented into multiple domains, each managed by its own authority and operating under its own policy. However, as business/mission-critical demands and stringencies continue to grow, there is a pressing need to improve network/service survivability (reliability) across multiple operating domains. Indeed, {{this is a very}} challenging problem owing to the obvious scalability and confidentiality limitations across domain boundaries. As a result, multidomain survivability schemes must be able to operate in a distributed, decentralized manner. In addition, new recovery provisions are also needed to handle large-scale “catastrophic” events causing multiple correlated failures, e. g., natural disasters, power outages, and weapons of mass destruction (WMD) attacks. Overall, a wide range of survivability solutions have been developed over the years, albeit mostly focusing on single domain settings. Broadly, these schemes can be classified as pre-provisioned protection and post-fault restoration type strategies. Namely, the former types offer fast recovery and single-failure resiliency guarantees via the pre-allocation of backup resources. Meanwhile, the latter offer more latent nondeterministic recovery via post-fault path re-routing. In general, both of these strategies can be extended across domain boundaries to achieve multi-domain service recovery. However, most existing proposals in this space only study protection-based approaches and do not incorporate end-to-end resource efficiency or backup diversity concerns. Further treatments for multi-failure recovery are also lacking. In light of the above, this dissertation proposes a range of solutions to improve distributed multi-domain survivability. First, a new protection scheme is proposed to achieve improved end-to-end path pair diversity (resiliency) with reduced routing overheads. This solution is then augmented with probabilistic considerations to handle more challenging multi-failure scenarios, i. e., as arising during catastrophic events. In particular, this solution incorporates both resource efficiency and failure risk mitigation concerns. Finally, a novel post-fault restoration scheme is proposed to achieve multidomain failure recovery using joint intra-/inter-domain <b>crankback</b> signaling. The performance of all of these proposed solutions is also evaluated using discrete event simulation and appropriate comparisons made versus existing strategies.
