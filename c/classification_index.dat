[...] Classification relies on the Deacon Active Site Profiling (DASP) approach that utilizes a position specific scoring matrix (PSSM) created from aligned signatures (built from sequence fragments surrounding active sites of structurally-characterized Prx group members) to search sequence databases. [...] Searches of PREX for Prxs of interest can be conducted using protein annotation, accession number, PDB ID, organism name, or protein sequence (using BLAST) for Prx proteins extracted from January 2008, November 2010, or October 2011 versions of GenBank (over 8000 validated Prx sequences represented). Output includes the subfamily to which each classified Prx belongs, accession and GI numbers, genus and species, and the active site signature used for classification.

Moreover, the CR can be located in 5 (known) locations in the structure, yielding either an intersubunit or intrasubunit disulfide bond in the oxidized protein (depending on CR location). To assist with identification of new members and the subgroup to which they belong, a searchable database (the PeroxiRedoxin <b>classification</b> <b>indEX)</b> including Prx sequences identified from GenBank (January 2008 through October 2011) was generated by bioinformatics analysis and is publicly available.|$|E

40|$|Aim: To develop {{classification}} criteria for Chinese pulse diagnosis and to objectify the ancient diagnostic technique. Methods: Chinese pulse curves {{are treated as}} wave signals. Multidimensional variable analysis is performed {{to provide the best}} curve fit between the recorded Chinese pulse waveforms and the collective Gamma density functions. Results: Chinese pulses can be recognized quantitatively by the newly-developed four <b>classification</b> <b>indices,</b> that is, the wave length, the relative phase difference, the rate parameter, and the peak ratio. The new quantitative classification not only reduces the dependency of pulse diagnosis on Chinese physician's experience, but also is able to interpret pathological wrist-pulse waveforms more precisely. Conclusions: Traditionally, Chinese physicians use fingertips to feel the wrist-pulses of patients in order to determine their health conditions. The qualitative theory of the Chinese pulse diagnosis is based on the experience of Chinese physicians for thousands of years. However, there are no quantitative theories to relate these different wrist-pulse waveforms to the health conditions of patients. In this paper, new quantified <b>classification</b> <b>indices</b> have been introduced to interpret the Chinese pulse waveform patterns objectively...|$|R

Five CPT soil engineering classification systems are incorporated in this effort. They include the probabilistic region estimation and fuzzy classification methods, both developed by Zhang and Tumay, the Schmertmann, the Douglas and Olsen, and the Robertson et al. methods. In the probabilistic region estimation method, a conformal transformation is used to determine the soil <b>classification</b> <b>index,</b> U, from CPT cone tip resistance and friction ratio. A statistical correlation is established between U and the compositional soil type given by the Unified Soil Classification System (USCS) The soil <b>classification</b> <b>index,</b> U, provides a soil profile over depth with the probability of belonging to different soil types, which more realistically and continuously reflects the in-situ soil characterization, which includes the spatial variation of soil types.
