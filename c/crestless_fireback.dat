50|$|The {{principle}} {{differences between}} the male Salvadori's pheasant and the female <b>crestless</b> <b>fireback</b> is that the former is longer, has a pale bill and holds the tail lowered while the latter is more robust, has a black beak and tends to keep the tail cocked. Also, Salvadori's pheasant occurs at higher altitudes in Sumatra than the <b>crestless</b> <b>fireback.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The <b>crestless</b> <b>fireback</b> (Lophura erythrophthalma) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Phasianidae. It is found in Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore. Its natural habitat is {{subtropical}} or tropical moist lowland forests. It is threatened by habitat destruction and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being [...] "vulnerable".|$|E
50|$|The {{nominate}} subspecies L. e. erythrophthalma {{is found}} in mainland Malaysia and Sumatra while L. e. pyronota occurs in Borneo. The male of the latter subspecies is a greyer bird, with black and white vermiculations, and steel blue upper tail coverts. The <b>crestless</b> <b>fireback</b> is a shy bird and seldom seen; it inhabits undergrowth in lowland rainforests, and also secondary growth forest in Malaysia, up to altitudes of about 300 m.|$|E
50|$|Chinese bamboo {{partridges}} {{have been}} part of Chinese aviculture for centuries. In captivity, these tiny birds are pugnacious and care should be taken as to what other terrestrial species should be kept in mixed-species aviaries. They are compatible with <b>crestless</b> <b>firebacks</b> and eared pheasants but not with junglefowl or francolin.|$|R
50|$|The <b>crestless</b> <b>fireback</b> is a {{retiring}} {{bird and}} has been little studied. It mostly occurs in pairs or small groups. It lives on the ground among undergrowth and feeds during the day by scratching up the leaf litter and eating the small animals exposed, as well as feeding on vegetable matter and fallen fruit. It breeds in captivity, and a nest recorded in the wild was between the buttress roots of a large tree and contained a clutch {{of four or five}} pink or pale buff eggs. The breeding season is from April to June and the gestation period lasts 24 days.|$|E
50|$|The {{male and}} female Salvadori's {{pheasant}} are quite unlike each other in appearance, {{and in fact the}} male bird is very similar to the female <b>crestless</b> <b>fireback</b> (Lophura erythrophthalma). The male Salvadori's pheasant is 46 to 55 cm in length and is plain black, with a bluish fringe to the feathers of body and neck. The tail is short and rounded. The beak is whitish-green and the iris orange-red. There is a yellowish-green or grey-green ring of bare skin round the eye, {{and the rest of the}} bare facial skin is bright red. The legs are greyish-blue with a strong spur. The female is slightly shorter and has no spur. Her colour is reddish-brown, each feather having fine black speckling and a pale streak by the shaft, giving her a mottled look. The throat is paler brown and the tail is blackish-brown. Juveniles are similar to females but the feathers are edged with pale buff giving a scaled effect.|$|E
50|$|Male crestless firebacks {{are about}} 38 cm {{in length and}} females {{slightly}} smaller. The face has bare red skin, the bill is greenish in males and black in females, there is no crest, the legs are bluish-grey, with long spurs in males and short spurs in females. The tail is short and either rounded, or the central feathers are shorter than the outer ones. The male has purplish-black plumage, with white vermiculation on the mantle and back, the wings and {{the side of the}} breast. The rump is bright chestnut and the upper tail coverts are purple with maroon margins. The tail feathers are cinnamon with black bases. The female <b>crestless</b> <b>fireback</b> is almost completely black with a blue or green gloss and was for some time considered to be a separate species. The head is brownish, paling to nearly white on the throat. Juveniles resemble females but have pale-edged feathers, and young males develop chestnut rumps quite soon. The female is very similar in appearance to the male Salvadori's pheasant (Lophura inornata) which is endemic to Sumatra, but that species tends to inhabit forests at higher altitudes.|$|E
50|$|Typical peafowl (Pavo), {{most of the}} peacock-{{pheasant}}s (Polyplectron), the Bulwer's pheasant (Lophura bulweri), the ruffed pheasants (Chrysolophus) and {{the hill}} partridges (Arborophila) have narrow, relatively delicate bills, poorly suited for digging. These galliform genera prefer instead to capture live invertebrates in leaf litter, in sand, or shallow pools or along stream banks. These genera are also outwardly similar in that they each have exceptionally long, delicate legs and toes and the tendency to frequent seasonally wet habitats to forage, especially during chick-rearing. The blue peafowl (Pavo cristatus) is famed in its native India for its appetite for snakes - even poisonous cobras - which it dispatches with its strong feet and sharp bill. The Lady Amherst's pheasant (Chrysolophus amherstiae), green peafowl (Pavo muticus), Bulwer's pheasant and the <b>crestless</b> <b>fireback</b> (Lophura erythrophthalma) are notable for their aptitude to forage for crustaceans such as crayfish and other aquatic small animals in shallow streams and amongst rushes {{in much the same}} manner as some members of the rail family (Rallidae). Similarly, although wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo) have a diet primarily of vegetation, they will eat insects, mice, lizards, and amphibians, wading in water to hunt for the latter. Domestic hens (Gallus domesticus) share this opportunistic behaviour and will eat insects, mice, worms, and amphibians.|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} results of bird surveys {{conducted}} in 2000 and 2006 at 13 sites in the interior lowlands and foothills (< 400 m asl) of Central and East Kalimantan, Indonesia. The study area spans c. 170 km east-west between {{the middle and upper}} reaches of the Barito and Mahakam Rivers, and more than 100 km north-south from the foothills of the Muller Range. Habitats surveyed include mixed dipterocarp forest, heath forest (kerangas), riparian forest and converted lands on a variety of substrates. A total of 226 species was recorded, including five Vulnerable species (<b>Crestless</b> <b>Fireback</b> Lophura erythrophthalma, Large Green Pigeon Treron capellei, Lesser Adjutant Leptoptilos javanicus, Hook-billed Bulbul Setornis criniger and Bornean Wren Babbler Ptilocichla leucogrammica) and 59 Near Threatened species. Habitat, land use and soil quality varied widely across the study area. The north-west section of the study area boasts large tracts of intact, continuous-canopy dipterocarp and heath forest and is likely to support viable populations of a variety of rare and threatened species. The influence of logging disturbance is briefly discussed, and the bird communities of dipterocarp and heath forests are broadly compared...|$|E
40|$|Tesso Nilo {{area which}} is located at Riau {{province}} covers an area of 188. 00 ha. Recently, it is famous because of asharply increased in encroachment activities for forest conversion, especially for oil palm plantations and villagesites. It was conducted in logged forest around Segati river, Toro river, Mamahan river and Sawan river in June 2003. The {{results showed that the}} area had the high richness of plant species which was indicated by the high valueof Mennhenick index. Records from the 1 ha studied plot identified a total of 360 species included 165 genera and 57 families with 215 tree species 305 sapling species. Some important tree species which were included in the RedList of IUCN were â€˜gaharuâ€™ (Aquilaria malaccensis), â€˜raminâ€™ (Gonystylus bancanus), Shorea spp. and Dipterocarpusspp. The local community utilized 83 species of medicinal plants and 4 species of toxic plants for fishing. The totalnumber of recorded bird species was 114 species represented 29 % of the total Sumatran bird species. The mostimportant bird species were the Wrinkled Hornbill (Aceros corrugatus), <b>Crestless</b> <b>Fireback</b> (Lophuraerythrophthalma), Crested Fireback (Lophura ignita) and Hooked-billed Bulbul (Setornis criniger). The total numberof recorded mammal species was 34 species or 16. 5 % of 206 species of Sumatran mammals. The most importantmammal species included Sumatran tiger (Panthera tigris sumatrae), Sumatran elephant (Elephas maximussumatrensis), the Sun bear (Helarctos malayanus) and three species of primates: Hylobates agilis, Presbytis femoralisand Macaca nemestrina. The herpetofauna contained 15 reptile species and 18 amphibian species. The mostimportant herpetofauna was the endangered False Gharial (Tomistoma schlegelii) and the vulnerable Common Softshelledturtle (Amyda cartilaginea). The number of recorded fish species was 50 represented 18 % of the totalSumatran fish species (272 species). The important fish species were Breinsteinea sp. and Chaca bankanensis whichwere unique and rare. Since insects are the largest group of animal, this study only focused on beetles. Theidentified beetles were classified into 644 species and 34 families. The important beetles were the Longhorn beetles(Cerambycidae) and the Scarab beetles (Scarabaeidae). The small mammal parasites consisted of ectoparasites whichwere categorized into 14 species and endoparasites which were categorized into 2 orders and 3 species...|$|E
