25|$|Because of its {{construction}} as an infinite <b>circulant,</b> the symmetry {{group of the}} Rado graph includes automorphisms that generate a transitive infinite cyclic group. The difference set of this construction (the set of distances in the integers between adjacent vertices) can be constrained to include the difference 1, without affecting the correctness of this construction, from which {{it follows that the}} Rado graph contains an infinite Hamiltonian path whose symmetries are a subgroup of the symmetries of the whole graph.|$|E
25|$|Another {{construction}} of the Rado graph shows {{that it is an}} infinite <b>circulant</b> graph, with the integers as its vertices and with an edge between each two integers whose distance (the absolute value of their difference) belongs to a particular set S. For this construction to yield the Rado graph, S must have the property that adjacencies defined in this way have the extension property. This may be achieved by choosing S randomly, or by choosing the indicator function of S to be the concatenation of all finite binary sequences.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{eigenvalue}} and singular-value distributions for matrices S− 1 nAn and C− 1 nAn are examined, where An, Sn, and Cn are Toeplitz matrices, simple <b>circulants,</b> and optimal <b>circulants</b> {{generated by}} the Fourier expansion of some function f. Recently it has been proven that a cluster at 1 exists whenever f is from the Wiener class and strictly positive. Both restrictions are now weakened. A proof is given for the case when f may take the zero value, and hence the <b>circulants</b> are to have unbounded inverses. The main requirements on f are that it belong to L 2 and be in some sense, sparsely vanishing. Specifically, if f is nonnegative and <b>circulants</b> Sn (or Cn) are positive definite, then the eigenvalues of S− 1 nAn (or C− 1 nAn) are clustered at 1. If f is complex-valued and Sn (or Cn) are nonsingular, then the singular values of S− 1 nAn (or C− 1 nAn) are clustered at 1 as well. Also proposed and studied are the improved <b>circulants.</b> It is shown that (improved) simple <b>circulants</b> can be much more advantageous than optimal <b>circulants.</b> This depends crucially on the smoothness properties of f. Further, clustering-on theorems are given that pertain to multilevel Toeplitz matrices preconditioned by multilevel simple and optimal <b>circulants...</b>|$|R
40|$|From a {{generalization}} to $Z^n$ of {{the concept}} of congruence we define a family of regular digraphs or graphs called multidimensional <b>circulants,</b> which turn out to be Cayley (di) graphs of Abelian groups. This paper is mainly devoted to show the relationship between the Smith normal form for integral matrices and the dimensions of such (di) graphs, that is the minimum ranks of the groups they can arise from. In particular, those 2 -step multidimensional <b>circulants</b> which are <b>circulants,</b> that is Cayley (di) graphs of cyclic groups, are fully characterized.

25|$|A second graph-theoretic {{description}} {{of the problem is}} also possible. Once the women have been seated, the possible seating arrangements for the remaining men can be described as perfect matchings in a graph formed by removing a single Hamiltonian cycle from a complete bipartite graph; the graph has edges connecting open seats to men, and the removal of the cycle corresponds to forbidding the men to sit in either of the open seats adjacent to their wives. The problem of counting matchings in a bipartite graph, and therefore a fortiori the problem of computing ménage numbers, can be solved using the permanents of certain 0-1 matrices. In the case of the ménage problem, the matrices arising from this view of the problem are <b>circulant</b> matrices.|$|E
25|$|A Cayley graph is a graph defined {{from a pair}} (G,S) where G is a {{group and}} S {{is a set of}} {{generators}} for the group; it has a vertex for each group element, and an edge for each product of an element with a generator. In the case of a finite cyclic group, with its single generator, the Cayley graph is a cycle graph, and for an infinite cyclic group with its generator the Cayley graph is a doubly infinite path graph. However, Cayley graphs can be defined from other sets of generators as well. The Cayley graphs of cyclic groups with arbitrary generator sets are called <b>circulant</b> graphs. These graphs may be represented geometrically as a set of equally spaced points on a circle or on a line, with each point connected to neighbors with the same set of distances as each other point. They are exactly the vertex-transitive graphs whose symmetry group includes a transitive cyclic group.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we {{establish}} a fundamental {{link between the}} search for weighing matrices constructed from two <b>circulants</b> and the operation of sorting strings, an operation that has been studied extensively in computer science. In particular, we demonstrate that the search for weighing matrices constructed from two <b>circulants</b> using the power spectral density criterion and exploiting structural patterns for {{the locations of the}} zeros in candidate solutions, {{can be viewed as a}} string sorting problem together with a linear time algorithm to locate common strings in two sorted arrays. This allows us to bring into bear efficient algorithms from the string sorting literature. We also state and prove some new enhancements to the power spectral density criterion, that allow us to treat successfully the rounding error effect and speed up the algorithm. Finally, we use these ideas to find new weighing matrices of order 2 n and weights 2 n − 13, 2 n − 17 constructed from two <b>circulants...</b>|$|R
