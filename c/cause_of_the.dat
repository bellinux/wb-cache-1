40|$|The {{report issued}} by the Inquiry Board in charge <b>of</b> {{inspecting}} <b>the</b> Ariane 5 flight 50. 1 failure concludes that <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> failure are rooted into poor S/W En-gineering practice. From the failure scenario described in the Inquiry Board report, {{it is possible to}} infer what, in our view, are <b>the</b> real <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 501 failure. We develop arguments to demonstrate that <b>the</b> real <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 501 failure are neither S/W specification errors nor S/W design errors. Real <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> failure are faults in <b>the</b> capture <b>of</b> <b>the</b> overall Ariane 5 applica-tion/environment requirements, and faults in the de-sign and <b>the</b> dimensioning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ariane 5 on-board computing system. These faults result from not fol-lowing a rigorous System Engineering approach, such as applying a proof-based System Engineering method...|$|R
5|$|Counsel {{assisting}} the Inquiry, Henry Winneke, advocated that the <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> accident was Spence's diabetes.

After the inquiry had received all available information related to Spence's diabetes, Justice Simpson said the insulin reaction of the pilot might have had a considerable bearing on the accident.|$|E

5|$|Justice Simpson's {{report was}} tabled in the House of Representatives on 28 June 1951 {{by the new}} Minister for Civil Aviation, Larry Anthony. The Inquiry found that the Amana {{suffered}} total loss of engine power {{on at least one}} occasion, followed by rapid loss of height until it struck the ground. However, the evidence did not allow the court to determine the <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total loss of engine power. Consequently, the court was unable to determine the <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> accident. Simpson stated he was satisfied water had not been introduced into the Amana's fuel system in Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide or Perth.|$|E

5|$|On 16 February 1980, a Britannia 253F of Redcoat Air Cargo crashed at Billerica, Massachusetts, {{shortly after}} {{taking off from}} Boston. The {{probable}} <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> accident was degraded aerodynamic performance beyond the flight capabilities of the aircraft resulting from an accumulation of ice and snow on the airframe before takeoff and a further accumulation of ice when the aircraft was flown into moderate to severe icing conditions following takeoff. Contributing to the <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> accident were encounters with wind shear, downdrafts, and turbulence during the climb. Of eight crew and passengers on board, there were seven fatalities with one seriously injured.|$|E

5|$|The {{majority}} opinion {{presented by the}} NTSB accident report determined that the <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> accident was the TWA flight crew's inability to successfully abort takeoff procedures due to an excess of speed.

In his minority report, Mr. McAdams' {{said that he would}} have found the probable <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> accident to be the Delta crew's failure to adequately advise the tower of the proximity to the runway, and the tower's failure to request additional and precise information prior to clearing TWA 159 for takeoff.|$|E
