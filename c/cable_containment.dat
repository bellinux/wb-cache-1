50|$|A utility tunnel, utility corridor, or utilidor is {{a passage}} built {{underground}} or above ground to carry utility lines such as electricity, steam, water supply pipes, and sewer pipes.

40|$|IET International Conference on Railway Engineering 2008, ICRE 2008, Hong Kong, 25 - 28 March 2008 Intelligent control, {{building}} automation, networking is a {{basic provisions}} for modern building as well as railway station building. All these systems rely on a physical layer to transmit signal. Wire, wireless and powerline physical layer are commonly used. However, all these layers have their limitations and associated problems especially in existing building. Existing building without sufficient spare <b>cable</b> <b>containment</b> for future wiring, concrete chasing to install new <b>cable</b> <b>containment</b> is unavoidable for wiring new network cables. In view of higher cost and great nuisance to the occupant during concrete chasing, a feasibility study of using building reinforced steel bars to transmit signals is discussed in this paper for future application. The principle of signal transmission in reinforced steel bars is similar as signal coupling in a transformer by means of magnetic flux coupling. Signals are transmitted as magnetic flux {{by means of a}} transmission coil, which is installed through reinforced steel bar and cast-in the concrete. The magnetic flux shall flow all around the reinforced steel bars framework of the entire building. Another coil acting as receiver is installed in a remote area to couple the magnetic flux and transform the signals from the transmission coil. From the experiments in laboratory and two construction buildings, it proved that the building reinforced steel bars framework is feasible as a physical data transmission media. Signals injected into reinforced steel bars can be received in remote area of the entire building in acceptance performance.

40|$|The {{results of}} Stage 2 of the Regulatory Instrument Review are {{presented}} in this volume. Selected regulatory instruments, such as the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), Regulatory Guides, and ASME Codes, were investigated {{to determine the extent}} to which these regulations apply aging management to selected safety-related components in nuclear power plants. The Regulatory Instrument Review was funded by the NRC under the Nuclear Plant Aging Research (NPAR) program. Stage 2 of the review focused on four safety-related structures and components; namely, <b>cables,</b> <b>containment</b> and basemat, reactor coolant pumps, and motor-operated valves. The review suggests that the primary-emphasis of the regulatory instruments was on the design, construction, start-up, and operation of a nuclear power plant, and that aging issues were primarily addressed after an aging-related problem was recognized. This Stage 2 review confirms the results of the prior review; (see Regulatory Instrument Review: Management of Aging of LWR Major Safety-Related Components NUREG/CR- 5490. The observations indicate that the regulations generally address management of age-related degradation indirectly. Specific age-related degradation phenomena frequently are dealt with in bulletins and notices or through generic issues, letters, etc. The major recommendation of this report, therefore, is that the regulatory instruments should more directly and explicitly address the aging phenomenon and the management of the age-related degradation process...|$|R
40|$|The {{safety systems}} {{of nuclear power}} plants rely on {{low-voltage}} power, instrumentation and control <b>cables.</b> Inside the <b>containment</b> area, <b>cables</b> operate in harsh environments, characterized by relatively high temperature and gamma-irradiation. As these cables are related to fundamental safety systems, they {{must be able to}} withstand unexpected accident conditions and, therefore, their condition assessment is of utmost importance as plants age and lifetime extensions are required. Nowadays, the integrity and functionality of these cables are monitored mainly through destructive test which requires specific laboratory. The investigation of electrical aging markers which can provide information {{about the state of the}} cable by non-destructive testing methods would improve significantly the present diagnostic techniques. This work has been made within the framework of the ADVANCE (Aging Diagnostic and Prognostics of Low-Voltage I&C Cables) project, a FP 7 European program. This Ph. D. thesis aims at studying the impact of aging on cable electrical parameters, in order to understand the evolution of the electrical properties associated with cable degradation. The identification of suitable aging markers requires the comparison of the electrical property variation with the physical/chemical degradation mechanisms of polymers for different insulating materials and compositions. The feasibility of non-destructive electrical condition monitoring techniques as potential substitutes for destructive methods will be finally discussed studying the correlation between electrical and mechanical properties. In this work, the electrical properties of cable insulators are monitored and characterized mainly by dielectric spectroscopy, polarization/depolarization current analysis and space charge distribution. Among these techniques, dielectric spectroscopy showed the most promising results; by means of dielectric spectroscopy it is possible to identify the frequency range where the properties are more sensitive to aging. In particular, the imaginary part of permittivity at high frequency, which is related to oxidation, has been identified as the most suitable aging marker based on electrical quantities. ...|$|R
40|$|On divided roadways, cross-median {{fatalities}} {{are disproportionately}} overrepresented in fatal and serious injury crashes. Many state DOTs sought to mitigate cross-median crash risk by installing cable median barriers. Despite increased crash rates, studies evaluating crash rates {{before and after}} cable median barriers were installed indicated excellent improvement in overall safety. ^ Although cable median barriers are intended to prevent serious cross-median crashes, cable barriers can also contribute to serious injury and fatality crashes which would not have otherwise occurred, including penetration and rollover crashes. In {{order to reduce the}} frequency of undesirable penetration and rollover crashes occurring with cable median barriers in a cost-effective way, a research study was commissioned to study <b>cable</b> median barrier <b>containment</b> failures and methods of mitigating those failures. ^ Barrier placement in the center of 40 ft (12 m) or wider V-ditches resulted in the highest penetration rate of 15 %, but also resulted in the lowest rollover and severe crash rates of 2. 3 % and 1. 8 %, respectively. The 85 th percentile trajectory angle associated with severe cable median barrier crashes was 39 degrees. The highest penetration and rollover rates were 16 % and 13 %, corresponding to large cars and SUVs, respectively. Generally, vehicles with low bumper heights, high CG heights, and higher masses were involved in statistically significantly more cable median barrier penetrations. ^ Recommended changes to full-scale crash test requirements include substitution of large cars and SUVs for the small car and pickup trucks, as well as increasing the CG trajectory angle at impact to 39 degrees. Minimum and maximum cable heights should be 15 in. (381 mm) and 35 in. (889 mm), respectively, to reduce penetration frequency. Barriers should be installed as far from the travel way as practicable and preferably on slopes between 6 : 1 and 8 : 1. By implementing these improvements, many additional lives could be saved each year. ...|$|R
