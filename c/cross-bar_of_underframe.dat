50|$|There {{are other}} {{strength}} requirements associated with end-structure design. 49 CFR § 238.211 specifies that the cab ends of locomotives, cab cars, and self-powered multiple-unit cars have lead ends capable of supporting 500,000 lb longitudinal {{force at the}} top <b>of</b> the <b>underframe,</b> and 200,000 lb of force above the top <b>of</b> the <b>underframe.</b>|$|R
50|$|During the {{scrapping}} process, {{a number}} <b>of</b> <b>underframes</b> from the surplus VBAY/VBAX wagons were modified to become VZTX sleeper transport wagons.

50|$|NPH 1 {{was built}} on the {{standard}} design <b>of</b> <b>underframe</b> as most other narrow-gauge stock, but because it was not anticipated that explosives traffic would require use of the entire wagon, it was partitioned to give 4 LT capacity for explosives, while the remaining 6 tons was for general goods.

50|$|A {{headstock}} of a {{rail vehicle}} is a transverse structural member {{located at the}} extreme end <b>of</b> the vehicle's <b>underframe.</b> The headstock supports the coupling at that end of the vehicle, and may also support buffers, in which case {{it may also be}} known as a buffer beam. The headstocks form part <b>of</b> the <b>underframe</b> <b>of</b> a locomotive or a railroad car. The headstocks of locomotives, railcars and cabcars also support headlamps and the hoses for air brakes, vacuum brakes as well as the cables for train control and head end power.|$|R

Chopping down young saplings, he made them <b>cross-bars</b> <b>of</b> a {{scaffold}} by lashing them high up to the trunks of standing trees.

The buffer beam section is also a separate part, which allows replacement if it is damaged in a collision.|$|R
5|$|Forty {{years earlier}} than de Tournefort, de Thévenot {{described}} {{much the same}} process, adding that it was seldom used because it was regarded as too cruel.

A large iron hook was fixed on the horizontal <b>cross-bar</b> <b>of</b> the gallows and the individual was forced upon this hook, piercing him from the abdomen through his back, so that he hung from it, hands, feet and head downward. On top of the cross bar, the executioner situated himself and performed various torture on the impaled man below him.|$|R

50|$|The cross/star symbol {{represents}} the solar sign, a protective symbol {{that according to}} folklore protects man from misfortunes. The cross does not overlap the black and red stripes, and its size is such that it fits within a square whose side is equal to 5/6 of the width {{of one of the}} vertical stripes of the flag. The width of the vertical and horizontal <b>cross-bars</b> <b>of</b> the solar sign is equal to one third of the side of this imaginary square. Each arm ends with two symmetrical teeth, the internal sides of which form a 90 degree angle where they meet, a vertex deepened towards the center of the sign at 1/2 arm width.|$|R

50|$|In {{a railway}} accident, {{telescoping}} {{occurs when the}} <b>underframe</b> <b>of</b> one vehicle overrides that of another, and smashes through the second vehicle's body. The term {{is derived from the}} resulting appearance of the two vehicle bodies: the body of one vehicle may appear to be slid inside the other like the tubes of a collapsible telescope - the body sides, roof and <b>underframe</b> <b>of</b> the latter vehicle being forced apart from each other.|$|R
60|$|Rafts.--Rafts of Wood.--Rafts {{are made}} of logs of wood, held {{together}} by pairs <b>of</b> <b>cross-bars,</b> one <b>of</b> each pair lying above the raft and the other below; then, the whole may be made quite firm by a little judicious notching wherethe logs cross, and a few pegs and lashings. Briers, woodbines, etc., will do for these. If the logs are large, they should be separately launched into the river, and towed into their proper places. Outriggers vastly increase the stability of a raft. The raft-fastening in common use is shown in f. 1: it is a stout, little wand, bent over the cross piece, and wedged into holes in the framework.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: To {{ensure the}} safe and {{efficient}} {{operation of the}} approximately 1. 6 million freight cars (wagons) in the North American railroad network, the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT), Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) requires periodic inspection of railcars to detect structural damage and defects. Railcar structural underframe components, including the centre sill, sidesills, and crossbearers, are subject to fatigue cracking due to periodic and/or cyclic loading during service {{and other forms of}} damage. The current railcar inspection process is time-consuming and relies heavily on the acuity, knowledge, skill, and endurance of qualified inspection personnel to detect these defects. Consequently, technologies are under development to automate critical inspection tasks to improve their efficiency and effectiveness. Research was conducted to determine the feasibility <b>of</b> inspecting railcar <b>underframe</b> components using machine vision technology. A digital video system was developed to record images <b>of</b> railcar <b>underframes</b> and computer software was developed to identify components and assess their condition. Tests of the image recording system were conducted at several railroad maintenance facilities. The images collected there were used to develop several types of machine vision algorithms to analyse images <b>of</b> railcar <b>underframes</b> and assess the condition of certai...|$|R

60|$|As {{soon as he}} had bored one hole he put a nail into it, {{and drove}} it almost through, but not quite through, {{as he said it}} might prove that he should wish to alter it. He then went to the other end <b>of</b> the same <b>cross-bar,</b> bored a hole there, and put a nail in, driving it as far as he had driven the first one. This was the topmost <b>cross-bar</b> <b>of</b> the ladder, and it was held {{securely}} in its place by the two nails. Stuyvesant then took the bottom cross-bar and secured that in the same way. Then he put on the other bars one at a time, until his ladder was complete in form, only the cross-bars were not yet fully nailed. He and Phonny looked at it carefully, to see if all was right, and Stuyvesant, taking it up from the floor, placed it {{against the wall of the}} shop.|$|R

40|$|There {{the purpose}} is to develop the {{technique}} of theoretical prediction of dynamic properties of rolling stock for the estimation of efficiency of measures, which were directed for the decrease of rate of low-frequency bending vibrations of bodies. The mathematical simulator <b>of</b> generalized rail <b>underframe</b> has been developed. The conditions of asymptotic and unlimited stability of parametric bending vibrations of body have been formulated. The new version of numerical method for the computation of frequency characteristics of continuous members of system has been developed. The recommendations for the choice of up-dating variant of motor van of high-speed electric train, for the choice <b>of</b> scheme <b>of</b> <b>underframe</b> part <b>of</b> outlook electric locomotive have been presented. The measures for the improvement of ride characteristics of cryogenic section of experimental gas Diesel locomotive have been developed. The devices for the control over the characteristics of dynamic systems have been developed and have been patented. The developed recommendations have been introduced. The prediction technique is used for the choice of rational characteristics of mechanical part. The saving of electric energy for the traction is provided 3, 9 - 5, 2 % in number during the passanger transit by the up-dated motor-van rolling stock.

Then supporting this ladder-shaped framework over the sick man as he lies in his blanket, knot the blanket up well to it, and so carry him off palanquin-fashion. One cross-bar will be just behind his head, another in front of his feet; the middle one will cross his stomach, and keep him from falling out; and there will remain two short handles for the carriers to lay hold of. The American Indians carry their wounded companions by this contrivance after a fight, and during a hurried retreat, for wonderful distances. A king of waggon-roof top can easily be made to it, with bent boughs and one spare blanket. (See Palanquin.) ...|$|R
