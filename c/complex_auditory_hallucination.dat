40|$|ABSTRACT Musical {{hallucination}} {{is a type}} of <b>complex</b> <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucination.</b> Possible etiologies are deafness, {{psychiatric disorders}} such as schizophrenia, major depression, use of medication and stress, besides neurologic diseases including epilepsy, stroke and cancer. Uncommon etiologies encompass infectious diseases, metabolic disorders, and sensory deprivation. Although musical hallucinations {{have a major impact on}} patients' lives, they have been undervalued and understudied in the literature. We report a case of a 79 -year-old woman with musical hallucination (hearing a sung National anthem) without cognitive impairment or hearing loss. The patient had preserved insight of her complaint and responded well to neuroleptics...|$|E

40|$|<b>Complex</b> <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> {{are often}} {{characterized}} by hearing voices and are then called <b>auditory</b> verbal <b>hallucinations</b> (AVHs). While AVHs have been extensively investigated in psychiatric patients suffering from schizophrenia, reports from neurological patients are rare and, in most cases, incomplete. Here, we characterize AVHs in 9 patients suffering from pharmacoresistant epilepsy {{by analyzing the}} phenomenology of AVHs and patients' neuropsychological and lesion profiles. From a cohort of 352 consecutively examined patients with epilepsy, 9 patients suffering AVHs were identified and studied {{by means of a}} semistructured interview, neuropsychological tests, and multimodal imaging, relying on a combination of functional and structural neuroimaging data and surface and intracranial EEG. We found that AVHs in patients with epilepsy were associated with prevalent language deficits and damage to posterior language areas and basal language areas in the left temporal cortex. <b>Auditory</b> verbal <b>hallucinations,</b> most of the times, consisted in hearing a single voice of the same gender and language as the patient and had specific spatial features, being, most of the times, perceived in the external space, contralateral to the lesion. We argue that the consistent location of AVHs in the contralesional external space, the prominence of associated language deficits, and the prevalence of lesions to the posterior temporal language areas characterize AVHs of neurological origin, distinguishing them from those of psychiatric origin...|$|R

40|$|The authors {{describe}} {{the case of}} a 62 year old woman without any significant personal or family psychiatric history prior to being 52, when after a minor head trauma occurring during worktime, she started showing delusional ideas of hypochondri- ac and somatic content believing to have developed a “problem in the head”. Two years later she was admitted to a Psychiatric inpatient unit and diagnosed with a delusional disorder of the somatic subtype.  At discharge she maintained the delusional ideas, which, however, were encapsulated from her personality and quiescent, while exhibiting no insight into her psychopatho- logical state. Very shortly thereafter, at follow-up in the outpatient clinic, she stopped all drug therapy (oral antipsychotic drugs). One year later, she was readmitted to the inpatient unit upon worsening of the hypochondriac and somatic delusional ideas. The prescribed medication was switched to depot injection, which she also stopped shortly thereafter. Three years later, being 58 years of age, she began to show manic symptoms of crescendo severity (grandiose delusion-like ideas, elated mood, overactivity, disinhibition, acceleration of thinking, reduced need for sleep and increased pres- sure of speech). This clinical condition gets worse, with persecutory delusional ideas and <b>complex</b> <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> and she was admitted to the inpatient unit once more. This time she presents a full manic episode and a Bipolar I affective disorder diagnosis was made. She had a hyperthymic pre-morbid temperament. For the next 4 years, the patient remained somewhat stable with elation of mood, grandiose ideas, increased pressure of speech, eccen- tric clothing and lack of insight to her psychopathological state.

25|$|<b>Auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> (also {{known as}} paracusia) are the {{perception}} of sound without outside stimulus. <b>Auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> {{are the most common}} type of <b>hallucination.</b> <b>Auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> can be divided into two categories: elementary and complex. Elementary hallucinations are {{the perception of}} sounds such as hissing, whistling, an extended tone, and more. In many cases, tinnitus is an elementary <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucination.</b> However, some people who experience certain types of tinnitus, especially pulsatile tinnitus, are actually hearing the blood rushing through vessels near the ear. Because the auditory stimulus is present in this situation, it does not qualify as a hallucination.|$|R

40|$|It {{has proved}} {{difficult}} {{to establish the}} internal process by which mental events are transformed into <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations.</b> The earlier stages of the generation of hallucinations may prove more accessible to research. Cognitions have been reported by patients as a trigger of <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations,</b> but the role of these preceding thoughts has not been causally determined. Therefore, the role of cognition in triggering <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> was tested in an experimental study. Thirty individuals who experienced <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> in social situations entered a neutral social situation presented using virtual reality.

However, they do occur without other psychotic symptoms in a substantive number of cases in the general population and can cause a lot of individual distress because of the supposed association with schizophrenia. We describe a case of nonpsychotic <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> occurring in the context of migraine. Method: Case report and literature review. Results: A 40 -year-old man presented with imperative <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> that caused depressive and anxiety symptoms. He reported migraine with visual aura as well which started {{at the same time as}} the <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations.</b> The <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> occurred in the context of nocturnal migraine attacks, preceding them as aura. No psychotic disorder was present. After treatment of the migraine with propranolol 40 mg twice daily, explanation of the etiology of the hallucinations, and mirtazapine 45 mg daily, the migraine subsided and no further hallucinations occurred. The patient recovered. Discussion: Visual auras have been described in migraine and occur quite often. <b>Auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> as aura in migraine have been described in children without psychosis, but this is the first case describing <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> without psychosis as aura in migraine in an adult. For description of this kind of hallucination, DSM-IV lacks an appropriate category. Conclusion: Psychiatrists should consider migraine with acoustic aura as a possible etiological factor in patients without further psychotic symptoms presenting with <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations,</b> and they should ask for headache symptoms when they take the history. Prognosis may be favorable if the migraine is properly treated. Research is needed to explore the pathophysiological mechanism of <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> as aura in migraine.

40|$|In a {{population-based}} {{study of}} <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> in almost 4000 children aged 7 and 8 {{years in the}} Dutch province of Groningen, a one-year prevalence rate of 9 % was found. The majority of the children did not suffer much from the voices. Examination of a case-control sample of 694 children revealed little differences between children with <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> and controls in pre- and perinatal complications and early development problems. However, the children with <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> had more parental reported somatic complaints. The case-control sample was re-assessed after five years, {{in order to examine}} the course of the <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations.</b> Also, risk factors for voice hearing persistence, new incidence closer to puberty and possible protective factors were studied. In total, 337 children could be included, equally divided over the groups with and without <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> at baseline. <b>Auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> persisted in almost a quarter of the children, whereas 9 % of the control children reported these for the first time. Predictive of voice hearing persistence was hearing more than one voice at baseline and attribution of the voices to an external source. The children with <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> at follow-up had experienced more traumatic and stressful events, had more delusional ideation, more somatic complaints and more thought problems. Furthermore it was found that a better social cognition (as measured by a theory-of-mind task) was protective against delusion formation in children with <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations.</b> Follow-up examination of the case-control children in early adulthood will put the results in a wider perspective. ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: <b>Auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> are a {{commonly}} experienced phenomenon. Theories {{have been devised}} {{in order to help}} explain how and why this phenomenon occurs, some attributing its occurrence to stressful life events, other explaining it as originating from misattributed thoughts. This study tested the relation between patients who experience <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> and their pattern of metacognitions and thought strategies. Method: 12 participants suffering from <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> from different parts of Norway were assessed by following instruments: categories of worry (AnTI), metacognitions (MCQ- 30), strategies for thought control (TCQ), beliefs about <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> (BAVQ-R) and metacognitions with regard to <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> (MCQ-VH). Results: Results revealed that participants scored high on positive and negative meta-beliefs in regard to <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations.</b> There was further an association between measure of meta-worry as indicated by AnTI and interpretation of voices as indicated by BAVQ-R Earlier research on coping with voices had proposed that distraction was used by voice hearers who cope poorly. Correlational analyses found no relation between beliefs about malevolence and omnipotence of voices and distraction, although participants used distraction as a thought control strategy in order to cope with their voices.

40|$|Introduction. <b>Auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> are {{a common}} symptom {{experience}} of individuals with psychotic disorders and are often experienced as persistent, distressing, and disruptive. This case series examined the lived experiences of four individuals treated (successfully or unsuccessfully) with low-frequency (1 [*]Hz) rTMS for <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations.</b> Methods. A phenomenological approach was used and modified to involve some predetermined data structuring to accommodate for expected cognitive impairments of participants {{and the impact of}} rTMS on <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations.</b> Data on thoughts and feelings in relation to the helpful, unhelpful, and other effects of rTMS on <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations,</b> on well-being, functioning, and the immediate environment were collected using semistructured interviews. Results. All four participants noted some improvements in their well-being following treatment and none reported a worsening of their symptoms. Only two participants noted an improvement in the <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> and only one of them reported an improvement that was sustained after treatment completion. Conclusion. We suggest that there are useful findings in the study worth further exploration, specifically in relation to the role of an individual’s acceptance and ownership of the illness process in relation to this biomedical intervention.

40|$|Introduction: The {{literature}} on the possible neurobiologic correlates of <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> is expanding rapidly.

The {{primary purpose of the}} present article is to provide an overview of the nomenclature and classification of <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations.</b> Materials and Methods: Relevant data were obtained from books, PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library. Results: The results are presented in the form of several classificatory arrangements of <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations,</b> governed by the principles of content, perceived source, perceived vivacity, relation to the sleep-wake cycle, and association with suspected neurobiologic correlates. Conclusions: This overview underscores the necessity to reappraise the concepts of <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> developed during the era of classic psychiatry, to incorporate them into our current nomenclature and classification of <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations,</b> and to test them empirically with the aid of the structural and functional imaging techniques currently available...|$|R
50|$|<b>Auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> were rethought {{during the}} enlightenment.

25|$|<b>Auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> are {{the most}} {{prevalent}} type of hallucinations. They include hearing voices and music. Many times an individual suffering from <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> will hear a voice or voices saying the individual's own thoughts out loud, commenting on all their actions, or commanding and ordering the individual around. These voices tend to be negative and critical toward the individual. People who suffer from schizophrenia and have <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> will often speak to the voice {{as though they are}} speaking to a second person.|$|R
25|$|A mild form of {{hallucination}} {{is known}} as a disturbance, and can occur in most of the senses above. These may be things like seeing movement in peripheral vision, or hearing faint noises and/or voices. <b>Auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> are very common in schizophrenia. They may be benevolent (telling the subject good things about themselves) or malicious, cursing the subject, etc. <b>Auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> of the malicious type are frequently heard, for example people talking about the subject behind his/her back. Like <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations,</b> the source of the visual counterpart can also be behind the subject's back. Their visual counterpart is the feeling of being looked or stared at, usually with malicious intent. Frequently, <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> and their visual counterpart are experienced by the subject together.|$|R
50|$|<b>Auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> are {{the most}} common {{positive}} symptom in children. A child's <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> may include voices that are conversing with each other or voices that are speaking directly to the children themselves. Many children with <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> believe that if they do not listen to the voices, the voices will harm them or someone else. Tactile and visual hallucinations seem relatively rare. Delusions are reported in more than half of children with schizophrenia, but they are usually less complex than those of adults.|$|R

40|$|<b>Auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> are a {{frequent}} symptom in schizophrenia. While functional imaging {{studies have suggested}} the association of certain patterns of brain activity with sub-syndromes or single symptoms (e. g. positive symptoms like hallucinations), there has been only limited evidence from structural imaging or post mortem studies. In this study, we investigated the relation of local brain structural deficits to severity of <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations,</b> particularly in perisylvian areas previously reported {{to be involved in}} <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations.</b> In order to overcome certain limitations of conventional volumetric methods, we used deformation-based morphometry (DBM), a novel automated whole-brain morphometric technique, to assess local gray and white matter deficits in structural magnetic resonance images of 85 schizophrenia patients.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Medication-resistant, {{persistent}} <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> are {{pervasive in}} persons with schizophrenia.

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this multi-site intervention {{study was to examine}} the short-term effects of a 10 -week course to teach behavior management of persistent <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> on seven char-acteristics of <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> (i. e., frequency, loudness, self-control, clarity, tone, distractibility, and distress), anxiety, and depression. STUDY DESIGN: A quasi-experimental repeated measured design was used. The sample included 62 outpatients with schizophrenia who reported daily persistent <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations.</b> Measures in-cluded the Characteristics of <b>Auditory</b> <b>Hallucinations</b> Questionnaire, the tension-anxiety subscale of the Profile of Mood States, and the Beck Depression Inventory II. RESULTS: Preintervention scores for the frequency (p <. 001), self-control (p <. 03), clarity (p <. 01), tone (p <. 03), distractibility (p <. 006), and distress (p <. 001) improved compared with preinterven-tion scores.

40|$|<b>Auditory</b> <b>hallucination</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{symptoms}} in schizophrenia and the other psychotic disorders. The frequency of the <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> and ensuing distress make the individual believe that these voices are not able to be controlled and to be coped. This situation can cause patients to be hopeless and desperate and lead to harm themselves or the others. Furthermore, the time they lose and preoccupation with these symptoms reduce their social and occupational functioning significantly. <b>Auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> are fundamentally mean thoughts causing to attribute internal stimulus to the external sources, thus they are the internal speech of the individual. These internal speeches are inaccurately interpreted due to dysfunctions in basic processes of self monitoring.

This essay {{discusses}} the artworks {{presented in the}} MFA thesis exhibition 100, 000 Sidekicks including: {{the process and the}} construction of the work, the exhibition's arrangement and most importantly the work's content, intention and research. 100, 000 Sidekicks is an examination of my personal experience with multiple, individual voices or <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> and their influence on my creative process. In 100, 000 Sidekicks I share my personal experiences with <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> and frame <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> as a subject of psychological diversity. The pieces presented in this exhibition showcase my continuous art-making process, as well as my exploration of memories, <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> and the gaze in self-portraiture. The exhibition is a projection of three looped videos titled Origins, Brain Space Spectrum, and Where I Am, various visual artifacts including three paintings, three displayed scrolls and multiple sketchbooks (Plate I). The sketchbooks act as support for the larger pieces [...] videos, paintings and scrolls [...] and are analogous to the supportive role my <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> play for me. In this exhibition I have created an autobiographical collection of artworks that highlight my art-making process. I have also used documentation to create the videos and the visual artifacts. The videos are made up of 100, 000 frames. The repetitive drawing of my self-portrait created the frames necessary to generate the animated videos. Therefore the 100, 000 frames become the essential support or sidekicks to the final videos and are also the inspiration for the exhibition's title. My self-portraits are dual-purpose: they represent me physically and symbolize my <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations.</b> My gaze [...] the multiple monochromatic self-portraits that look directly at the viewer in the videos [...] is a metaphor for multiple, individual voices (<b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations)</b> speaking outwardly toward the audience. The image of my body is a symbol to reify my <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations,</b> to give physicality to an unseen condition. The <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> inspire the images that are documented through my concentrated drawing practice which {{can be seen in the}} sketchbooks and the drawings used as video frames. With this body of work I am candidly discussing my experience with <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> in a public forum for the first time. Through my honesty I am allowing myself to be simultaneously courageous and vulnerable. Although my personal understanding is not yet complete I have made this collection of art in an attempt to explore my experiences.
