40|$|The current {{production}} plan at the Potlatch Hybrid Poplar plantation in eastern Oregon is to haul 8, 000 whole trees per day (170, 000 bone dry Tons of chips annually) to a centrally located processing facility (CPF) where the poplar will be processed. Harvests begin in 2001 and continue on a seven-year rotation. A transportation {{system for the}} Potlatch Corporation plantation is developed. The study provides a "stump to dump" transportation route model, a review of field tests, and a transportation schedule that predicts production based on loads, transportation times and costs from any harvest unit on the plantation to the CPF. Primary objectives are reduced costs through efficiency, workability and safety. The transportation route system computes the shortest and "safest" transportation routes from harvest units to the CPF. Tree transportation speeds and times were obtained from field tests, and {{are included in the}} discussion of tested hauling equipment. For production management, spreadsheets are developed to modify and analyze different routes, and to monitor and maintain transportation efficiency. Data in the spreadsheets include harvest unit in acres, numbers of trees in each harvest unit, and hauling and return distances from corners and centroid of each harvest unit to the CPF. With this information harvest and transportation times, loads, and costs of harvesting any block on the plantation can be simulated. II An average 1. 6 -million trees will be harvested annually (11. 3 -million trees per 7 year rotation) and hauled with an estimated 15, 500 wagonloads in 46, 000 harvester hours. When the constructed transportation route model was analyzed with field data, it was determined that four harvesters are sufficient to meet the 8, 000 -trees/day goal at Potlatch plantation. Eleven tractor/wagon combinations will be required to maintain <b>continuous</b> <b>harvester</b> production on the entire plantation at any time. Analysis indicates that harvest and transportation costs per rotation are approximately seven million dollars (7, 000, 000) or an average of one million dollars (1, 000, 000) annually. The estimated harvest and transportation cost is 0. 625 per tree. In field production/time studies must be performed to fine-tune routes and equipment. Several recommendations are presented that emphasize areas of greatest concern related to transportation speed, safety, productivity and overall profitability...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} goals of precision farming is preparing yield map. Recently in Iran, planting of corn has received special attention. Therefore, among the different methods of yield measurement such as using impact sensor at the outlet port of forage harvester (chopper), displacement sensors at feed rollers of forage <b>harvester,</b> <b>continuous</b> measurement of discharged material to trailing wagon and using the torque meter, the present study made use of the torque meter method. This method consisted of a torque transmitting shaft equipped with laser-based encoders to monitor twist in a real time mode. The unit output could be exported to a computer via a microcontroller installed into the interface device. For calibration of the torque meter output with material feed rate in lab conditions, a conveyor was used to feed homogenous amount of material at a specific rate to the chopper. The experiment was conducted at 3 feed rates of silage corn and at 3 feed roll speeds of the chopper with 3 replications. Correlation between the feed rate and recorded power at different gears of the chopper was established. Relationships between feed rate and recorded power of the chopper at gears 1, 2 and 3 were linear with calculated R 2 of 0. 95, 0, 98 and 0. 98, respectively...|$|R
40|$|The {{mapping of}} within-field crop yield {{variations}} offers {{a basis for}} the adjustment of input application rates to match yield potential. The aim of this project was to examine available yield mapping components and systems, and to assess the benefits that could accrue from yield mapping. The work also included site investigations of possible causes of yield reduction, and an evaluation of the potential increase in profitability from variable-rate N application. Yield mapping requires the <b>continuous</b> measurement of <b>harvester</b> position and grain yield. Accurate positioning was achieved with systems which received a remote correction signal via communications satellite. A grain flow meter in the clean grain elevator gave low errors in conditions where the deflector plate could be kept clean. The production of useful yield maps was sometimes limited by rainy weather leading to wet crops, lodging, and big variations in harvest conditions within the field. Difficulties are also presented by small, irregularly-shaped fields. The level of within-field variation in cereal yields (25 % of the field area at least 21 % below the mean) suggests that there is scope for identifying low-yielding areas and either taking corrective action or applying reduced inputs. An analysis of the results of N fertiliser trials suggests a potential gain from about £ 20 /ha in sugar beet to less than £ 10 /ha in spring barley if N application rate could be varied to apply the optimum amount to each area within a field. All the costs of application map development and variable-rate application would need to fall below these gains to justify the use of the technology. To allow further use to be made of yield maps, it is desirable that the factors responsible for yield reduction be identified, in particular those which recur each year. In the present study, soil chemical analysis and compaction affected yield in only a small proportion of cases. Differences between maps from successive years have been small. It is concluded that the immediate financial benefits from the use of this technology will be small. However, in a future where the recording, justification and minimisation of inputs such as pesticides and fertiliser will grow in significance, and where the cost of the equipment and software will continue to fall, yield mapping and variable-rate input application will find a useful role.
