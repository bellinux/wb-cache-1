5|$|Julian Glover was a {{well-established}} <b>character</b> <b>actor</b> {{who had previously}} appeared in Doctor Who as Richard the Lionheart in The Crusade (1965). Glover was reluctant to don the Jagaroth mask created for scenes where Scarlioni had shed his human disguise as he felt the mask would impede his performance. As a result, he is doubled by Richard Sheekey {{in many of these}} scenes. Tom Chadbon was cast as Duggan on account of his resemblance to the Franco-Belgian comics hero Tintin. Peter Halliday had previously appeared in several Doctor Who serials including The Invasion and Doctor Who and the Silurians.|$|E

He was best known for playing eccentric doctors, scientists and professors, although he played {{a wide range of}} small, obscure rolesincluding photographers, waiters, a pet store dealer, rabbis, a Dutch sailor and a Swiss tailor.

5|$|Series creator David Wolstencroft {{believed}} that writing Tom {{was the most}} fun, yet the hardest work compared with other characters, because he was Spooks primary protagonist. Wolstencroft chose a job in Information Technology (IT) as the cover story Tom used in his relationship with Ellie, because he felt that in real life people are reluctant {{to ask questions about}} IT work. To portray the <b>character,</b> <b>actor</b> Matthew Macfadyen followed the scripts, {{and did not want to}} deviate from them, as he did not believe doing so would be useful. Macfadyen was also keen to explore parts of Tom from within him for influence.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the film}} industry, Grant is cited as an anti-star who {{approaches}} his roles like a <b>character</b> <b>actor,</b> {{and attempts to}} make his acting appear spontaneous. Hallmarks of his comic skills include a nonchalant touch of irony/sarcasm and studied physical mannerisms, {{as well as his}} precisely-timed dialogue delivery and facial expressions. The entertainment media's coverage of Grant's life off the big screen has often overshadowed his work as an actor. Grant has been outspoken about his antipathy towards the profession of acting, and in his disdain towards the culture of celebrity and hostility towards the media. In a career spanning 30years, Grant has repeatedly claimed that acting was not his true calling, but rather a career that developed by happenstance.|$|E

5|$|Barrymore {{began his}} film career in 1911, {{appearing}} in numerous silent films, {{many of which}} have subsequently been lost. In 1912 he signed a contract with D. W. Griffith's Biograph Company and appeared as a <b>character</b> <b>actor</b> in short films before moving into feature-length productions in 1914. He began writing scripts and directing films shortly afterwards, and {{for the next five years}} he did not act on the legitimate stage. Although he had several successes on Broadway after the First World War, he encountered strongly negative criticism in a 1921 production of Macbeth and in three productions in a row in 1925. Afterwards, he never again appeared on the New York stage. In 1925 he signed a contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, where he became a close friend of Louis B. Mayer and for whom he made numerous films. He directed several films from 1929 to 1931 but concentrated on acting after that.|$|E
5|$|Bryant Haliday {{was cast}} in the lead role as Professor Steiner. He was chosen for the role as Gordon was opposed to a British actor playing the title role, and the budget would not allow a Hollywood star to be used. The fact that Gordon was already {{familiar}} with him, as he had cast him in Curse of Simba and Devil Doll, was also a factor. Haliday, a fan of horror movies, enjoyed doing The Projected Man. British stage actress Mary Peach {{was cast in}} the lead role as Dr. Patricia Hill. It was insisted that she be given top billing for her role. Norman Wooland, a German-born British <b>character</b> <b>actor,</b> was cast as Dr. Blanchard, the film's villain. Derek Farr portrays Inspector Davis, and Ronald Allen {{plays the role of}} Dr. Christopher Mitchell. A scene in the film features actress Norma West lying topless on a morgue table; this scene was added to aid sales overseas.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Character</b> <b>actors</b> tend to {{play the}} same type of role {{throughout}} their careers, including Harvey Keitel as a [...] "tough and determined guy", Dame Maggie Smith as an [...] "upstanding lady matriarch", Christopher Lloyd as an eccentric, Claude Rains as a [...] "sophisticated, sometimes ambiguously moral man", Abe Vigoda as a [...] "leathery, sunken-eyed" [...] and tired hoodlum on the verge of retirement, Christopher Walken as a [...] "speech maker", Vincent Schiavelli as [...] "the confused guy", Steve Buscemi as [...] "a quirky, smart guy with a mind just outside of reality" [...] and Forest Whitaker as a [...] "calm, composed character with an edge and potential to explode". Ed Lauter usually portrayed a menacing figure because of his [...] "long, angular face" [...] which was easily recognized in public, although audiences rarely knew his name. <b>Character</b> <b>actors</b> can play a variety of types, such as the femme fatale, gunslinger, sidekick, town drunk, villain, whore with a heart of gold, and many others. A <b>character</b> <b>actor's</b> roles are often perceived as being substantially different from their perceived real-life persona, meaning that they do not portray an extension of themselves, but rather a character substantially different from their off-screen persona. <b>Character</b> <b>actors</b> subsume themselves into the characters they portray, such that their off-screen acting persona is practically unrecognizable. According to one view, great <b>character</b> <b>actors</b> are rarely out of work, and often have long careers that span decades. They are also often highly regarded by fellow actors.|$|R

5|$|Steiger {{made his}} stage debut in a {{production}} of Curse you, Jack Dalton! (1946) at the Civic Repertory Theatre of Newark. Subsequent to this, he received an invitation {{from one of his}} teachers, Daniel Mann, to attend the Actors Studio, established by Elia Kazan in October 1947. It was here, along with Marlon Brando, Karl Malden and Eli Wallach, that he studied method acting, which became deeply engrained in him. Lacking matinée idol looks, much like Malden and Wallach, he began pursuing a career as a <b>character</b> <b>actor</b> rather than as a leading man. Steiger's stage work continued in 1950, with a minor role as a townperson in a stage production of An Enemy of the People at the Music Box Theatre. His first major role on Broadway came in Clifford Odets's production of Night Music (1951), where he played A. L. Rosenberger. The play was held at the ANTA Playhouse. The following year, he played a telegraphist in the play Seagulls Over Sorrento, performed at the John Golden Theatre beginning on September 11, 1952.|$|E
5|$|The Hibbs-Murphy team {{proved so}} {{successful}} in To Hell and Back {{that the two}} worked together on {{a total of five}} subsequent films. Hibbs directed Murphy in Ride Clear of Diablo in 1954. The partnership resulted in the commercially unsuccessful non-traditional 1956 western Walk the Proud Land. Hibbs and Murphy teamed with each other for non-westerns Joe Butterfly and World in My Corner. They worked together a final time in the 1958 western Ride a Crooked Trail. Veteran <b>character</b> <b>actor</b> Dan Duryea who portrayed villain Whitey Kincaide in Ride Clear of Diablo played a second lead in two more Murphy vehicles, Night Passage and Six Black Horses. The Story of Charles Russell with Murphy as the lead was under development at Universal but shelved after the disappointing receipts of Walk the Proud Land. Murphy, however, was enthusiastic enough about a biopic of Charles Marion Russell to give serious consideration tor his own production that would star Guy Mitchell in the lead, but no such film was made.|$|E
