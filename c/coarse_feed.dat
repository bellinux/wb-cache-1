30|$|The {{impact of}} {{blasting}} on {{crushing and grinding}} was also investigated in mining literature (Workman and Eloranta 2003). Drilling and blasting operation determined the particle size of the crusher feed. Since more energy required to break <b>coarser</b> <b>feed</b> size (Pothina et al. 2007), smaller fragmentation size can provide substantial cost savings for the crushing process by reducing the energy consumption. However, decreasing particle size causes {{an increase in the}} production as more material is loaded and hauled in a cycle. In this case, the production capacity of crusher may be exceeded which leads to a queue at the crusher and the opportunity costs for the hauling and loading equipment.|$|R

5000|$|There {{are several}} methods of comminution. Comminution of solid {{materials}} requires {{different types of}} crushers and mills depending on the feed properties such as hardness at various size ranges and application requirements such as throughput and maintenance. The most common machines for the comminution of <b>coarse</b> <b>feed</b> material are the jaw crusher (1m > P80 > 100 mm), cone crusher (P80 > 20 mm) and hammer crusher. Primary jaw crusher product in intermediate feed particle size ranges (100mm > P80 > 20mm) can be ground in Autogenous or Semi-Autogenous (AG or SAG) mills depending on feed properties and application requirements. For comminution of finer particle size ranges (20mm > P80 > 30 μm) machines like the ball mill, vertical roller mill, hammer mill, roller press or high compression roller mill, vibration mill, jet mill and others are used. For yet finer grind sizes (sometimes referred to as [...] "ultrafine grinding"), specialist mills such as the IsaMillTM are used.|$|E

40|$|The {{practical}} use of forage paddy rice and rice is encouraged because {{it contributes to}} the effective utilization of paddy fields and production {{as well as the}} use of domestic feed. Research on forage paddy rice and rice has typically focused on the perspective of paddy or livestock farmers. However, {{to address the issue of}} the {{practical use}} of forage paddy rice and rice, the maintenance of users is necessary, and this demands the existence and cooperation of both paddy and livestock farmers. In this study, an interview survey was conducted to clarify the logic of paddy and livestock farmers who introduce forage paddy rice and rice as well as determine the importance of intermediation companies for paddy rice farmers. We find that paddy farmers plant forage paddy rice and rice to keep paddy fields because they have to deal with adjustments to long-term production and the expansion of areas dedicated to changing crop. Meanwhile, livestock farmers use forage paddy rice to produce <b>coarse</b> <b>feed.</b> Hence, the management strategy of individual farmers is related to the logic of introducing forage paddy rice. Further, we show that intermediation companies aim to keep the high quality of forage paddy rice and rice by monitoring paddy farmers and managing supply and demand. This is important to decrease the gap between paddy and livestock farmers based on both logics. In particular, the monitoring and adjustment of supply and demand play a major role, and thus it is necessary for intermediation companies to improve these functions in the future...|$|E

40|$|Key {{parameters}} {{for evaluating the}} hydrodynamic conditions within an operating flash flotation cell have been investigated. Profiles of the slurry at increasing depth within the cell have shown a strong trend of increasing slurry density (per cent solids) and coarseness (P- 80), with {{a clear indication of}} segregation on the basis of particle specific gravity. Results of local gas dispersion measurements, taken with the Anglo-Platinum Bubble Sizer, show that bubble coalescence is occurring at shallower depths within the cell and there is a clear trend of decreasing gas velocity (J(g)) with increasing depth at the axial location of measurement. Due to access restrictions gas dispersion measurements were taken close to the cell wall, but all data obtained falls well below the recommended minimum values for mechanically driven conventional flotation cells. However, the flash flotation environment is significantly different to a conventional cell, with higher per cent solids and a significantly <b>coarser</b> <b>feed</b> material, making this comparison qualitative (as unfortunately within the literature, there exists no other flash flotation data sets of this nature on which to base a comparison). The residence time distribution of solids indicates a significant amount of short-circuiting and/or internal recycle within the cell. Yet despite these findings, this cell contributes up to half of the pyrite recovery to the final concentrate at a very high grade. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|A {{computational}} model {{for use with}} DEM (Discrete Element Method) is proposed for the five mechanisms applying to particle comminution in AG, SAG and <b>coarse</b> <b>feed</b> ball mills. Chipping and rounding are mechanisms that lead to preferential mass loss from corners and edges of particles and which produce shape change for the particles as well as size reduction. These are controlled by the energy dissipation at a contact {{and the location of}} the contact on the surfaces of the particles. These mechanisms lead to rounding or conditioning of angular feed particles. Single impact body breakage is a very weak contributor to overall size reduction with most body breakage occurring via damage accumulation over many contacts. This incremental damage mechanism is inherently less inefficient but leads to size reduction from the many weak collisions experienced by particles within the mill. Finally, size reduction from abrasion is well represented by the shear energy absorption of the particles. Particle size and shape evolution due to chipping, rounding and attrition is demonstrated using a well characterised pilot mill for which detailed particle mass data is available. The relative contributions of the five mechanisms and a quantification of the wasted energy for both AG and SAG charges and for new and substantially comminuted material are reported. Changes in the energy spectra with the decreasing particle sizes over time are described with increases in the fraction of collisions above the elastic energy threshold leading to faster damage accumulation and reduced energy wastage. Finally, it is shown that the attribution of dissipated energy between particles in a collision is material dependent with significantly more energy absorbed by rock particles than balls. This needs to be accounted for in DEM models, particularly when attempting to explicitly predict particle size reduction...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} feeding {{different}} grinding levels {{and the effect}} of pelleted feed were tested on the salmonella-prevalence of finishing pigs. The feed was given to pigs in the weight interval from 27 to 99 kilos. The pigs were given dry feed ad libitum. The experiment comprised approximately 1, 000 finishers divided into four groups. In the test both meal and pelleted feed were used. The conclusions are: I. Meal feed gave a significantly lower salmonella level than heat-treated, pelleted feed. 2. The number of salmonella positive pigs were lower when using coarse grinding, but the effect of grinding level was not significant (P= 0. 08). 3. Pelleted feed gave a significantly higher production economy compared to meal feed - mainly due to a better feed conversion. 4. The content of starch in manure was affected by both grinding level and the pelleting process. Analyses showed approximately 25 times more starch in manure when using <b>coarse</b> grinded meal <b>feed</b> compared to fine grinded pelleted feed. 5. Pelleted feed gave a significantly poorer gastric health than meal feed. 6.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the gravity separation of fine particles in a Reflux Classifier, a fluidized bed device with a system of parallel inclined channels located above. A significant advance is reported here over what was previously possible, through the application of a recent discovery described by Galvin et al. (2009). By using closely spaced inclined channels it is possible to achieve significant suppression of the effects of particle size, and hence produce a powerful separation on the basis of density. Experimental work was undertaken on the continuous steady state separation of coal and mineral matter, with a very narrow channel spacing of 1. 77 mm used to process a feed finer than 0. 5 mm in diameter, and a channel spacing of 4. 2 mm used to process <b>coarser</b> <b>feeds</b> finer than 2. 0 mm. These results are compared with previous findings reported in the literature for wider channels. The gravity separation performance is shown to be remarkably high, with a significant reduction in the variation of the separation density with particle size, and a significant reduction in the Ecart probable error, E p. For example, over the particle size range 0. 25 – 2. 0 mm the composite E p for the size range decreased from 0. 14 for the wide channels used in previous studies to a typical level of 0. 06 for the closely spaced inclined channels used in the present study. The separation performance was also shown to be insensitive to feed pulp density and feed solids throughput over a very broad range...|$|R

40|$|An {{experiment}} with 210 male (Ross 308) 1 -d-old broilers {{was conducted to}} test the hypothesis that a coarse diet improves performance of broilers fed a poorly digestible protein source. A highly digestible diet based on soybean meal was gradually replaced by a low digestible diet based on rapeseed meal (RSM) in 5 steps (RSM- 0 %, RSM- 25 %, RSM- 50 %, RSM- 75 %, and RSM- 100 %). Two diet structures (fine and coarse) were used as an additional factor. These 2 factors and their interactions were tested at different ages in a factorial arrangement with 10 dietary treatments. An increase in indigestible dietary protein negatively affected feed intake (P = 0. 003), BW gain (P = 0. 008), and feed conversion ratio (P = 0. 034). This increase in dietary indigestible protein contents resulted in a decrease (P = 0. 001) in total cecal volatile fatty acid concentration from 209. 1 to 125. 9 mmol/kg of DM digesta in broilers with increasing RSM in diets. Increase in the indigestible protein level, from RSM- 0 % to RSM- 100 %, resulted in a decrease (P = 0. 042) in villus heights (1, 782 vs. 1, 574 µm), whereas crypt depths increased (P = 0. 021; 237 vs. 274 µm). A <b>coarse</b> diet improved <b>feed</b> intake (P = 0. 006), BW gain (P = 0. 014), and feed conversion ratio (P = 0. 009). Broilers fed coarse diets had approximately 11, 24, and 10 % lower relative empty weights of the crop, proventriculus, and jejunum, respectively, whereas a 15 % heavier gizzard was found compared with those fed the fine diets.

The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate how forest canopy structure affects insect herbivore species richness and abundance depending on feeding guilds´ specificities. We tested the hypothesis that habitat structure affects insect herbivore species richness and abundance differently to sap-sucking and chewing herbivore guilds. Two spatial scales were evaluated: inside tree crowns (fine spatial scale) and canopy regions (coarse spatial scale). In three sampling sites we measured 120 tree crowns, grouped in five points with four contiguous tree crowns. Insects were sampled by beating method from each crown and data were summed up for analyzing each canopy region. In crowns (fine spatial scale) we measured habitat structure: trunk circumference, tree height, canopy depth, number of ramifications and maximum ramification level. In each point, defined as a canopy region (coarse spatial scale), we measured habitat structure using a vertical cylindrical transect: tree species richness, leaf area, sum of strata heights and maximum canopy height. A principal component analysis based on the measured variables for each spatial scale was run to estimate habitat structure parameters. To test the effects of habitat structure upon herbivores, different general linear models were adjusted using the first two principal components as explanatory variables. Sap-sucking insect species richness and all herbivore abundances increased with size of crown at fine spatial scale. On the other hand, chewer species richness and abundance increased with resource quantity at <b>coarse</b> scale. <b>Feeding</b> specialization, resources availability, and agility are discussed as ecological causes of the found pattern...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{samples of}} feed coal, cleaned coal, middlings, slime and gangue were {{collected}} from Xiqu, Antaibao and Heidaigou coal preparation plants, China. The analyses of minerals, ash, sulfur and 20 hazardous trace elements were performed on the samples by SEM/EDX, INAA, ICP-AES, CV-AAS, GAAS and also on the samples from experimental products (by heavy-media, electrostatic separation and forth-floatation). Partitioning of sulfur and these trace elements under the conditions of different coal ranks and coal preparation types were discussed. The {{results show that the}} partitioning behavior of a given element during the cleaning processes is mainly controlled by its modes of occurrence, the distribution forms of its carrier minerals and the cleaning technique types. Although hazardous trace elements have diverse degrees of removal due to different coal ranks and coal preparation types, the elements associated with fine minerals (e. g. Pb, U and Be) and organic constituents (e. g. Br and Cl) will not be effectively reduced by physical coal cleaning and may still be enriched in the cleaned coal. As to the <b>coarse</b> sized <b>feeds</b> (particle size > 0. 5 mm), the elements associated with coarse/epigenetic minerals can be removed more easily by gravity separation methods and report to the gangue and slime. As to the finer-grained feeds (< 0. 5 mm), the elements associated with minerals with a high dielectric coefficient are easily removed by electrostatic separation; in comparison with the larger-sized fractions (74 – 150 µm), the smaller-sized fractions (< 74 µm) show a high removability of elements by forth-floatation as a whole. The physical coal cleaning is not only effective in the removal of ash and sulfur, but also in reducing the concentration of most hazardous trace elements. However, as byproducts, the middlings, especially the slimes are preferentially enriched in many hazardous elements (e. g.

Results demonstrated a strong effect of diet on parameters measured in the stomachs of the pigs, whereas the effect was less in {{the other parts of}} the gastrointestinal tract. Pigs fed the coarse nonpelleted (C-NP) diet showed more solid gastric content with higher dry matter content than pigs fed the fine nonpelleted (F-NP), coarse pelleted (C-P), or fine pelleted (F-P) diet. Pigs fed the C-NP diet also showed significantly increased number of anaerobic bacteria (P < 0. 05), increased concentrations of organic acids, and reduced pH in the stomach. In addition, pigs fed the C-NP diet showed increased in vitro death rate of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium DT 12 in content from the stomach (P < 0. 001). Pigs fed the C-NP diet had a significantly higher concentration of undissociated lactic acid in gastric content than pigs fed the other diets (P < 0. 001). A strong correlation between the concentration of undissociated lactic acid and the death rate of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium DT 12 was found. In the distal small intestine, cecum, and midcolon, significantly lower numbers of coliform bacteria were observed in pigs fed the coarse diets than in pigs fed the fine diets (P < 0. 01). Pigs fed the C-NP diet showed the lowest number of coliform bacteria in these segments of the gastrointestinal tract. Pigs fed the coarse diets showed increased concentration of butyric acid in the cecum (P < 0. 05) and colon (P < 0. 10) compared with pigs fed the fine diets. It was concluded that feeding a coarsely ground meal feed to pigs changes the physicochemical and microbial properties of content in the stomach, which decreases the survival of Salmonella during passage through the stomach. In this way the stomach acts as a barrier preventing harmful bacteria from entering and proliferating in {{the lower part of the}} gastrointestinal tract...|$|R

They will, then, have some idea of what was gone through by the loyal people of Pretoria, in their weak confidence in the good faith of the English Government.|$|R
40|$|Nutrient {{absorption}} occurs {{from the}} intestinal surfaces. Strategy in nutrient recovery {{by the small}} intestine is opposite {{to that of the}} large intestine. The duodenum, jejunum, and ileum have a very expansive mucosa by virtue of villi from the wall and microvilli on enterocytes, whereas the cecal body dominates the large intestine with its mucosa providing minimal surface area exposure to the lumen. Refluxive motility and villi movement in the small intestine provide ready convective contact between lumen contents and the unstirred water layer at the villi surfaces while contractile elements move microvilli to enhance contact after transfer into this surface. Refluxive motility in the colon gently separates fine from coarse particulates of small intestinal indigesta using urine moved from the urodeum. Cecal entry is restricted to fluid and fines by narrow orifices and protruding villi. Microbes in the small intestine are suppressed and reflect a bird’s environment, whereas rapid motility favors aerobes because of oxygen exchange with the wall. Microbes in the large intestine are highly concentrated with low oxygen levels that support anaerobes. Plant fiber that has high proportions of cellulose lends to <b>coarse</b> particulates after <b>feed</b> manufacturing, whereas fiber high in hemicellulose-pectin combinations disintegrate and may be partially soluble. Fiber generally acts as a dietary diluent with coarse particulates being more rapidly evacuated than soluble nonstarch polysaccharides or fines. Soluble nonstarch polysaccharides that increase viscosity of the small intestine’s luminal contents adversely affect live performance because of impaired efficiency of convection, reduced rate of exchange with the mucosa, and an expanded microbial population. Both nonstarch soluble fiber and the fine particulates are readily fermented to volatile fatty acids in the ceca that contribute to metabolizable energy...|$|R
60|$|I {{had nearly}} a hundred of the beasts broken in for the waggon, for packs, and for the saddle. I {{travelled}} an entire journey of exploration {{on the back of}} one of them, with others by my side, either labouring at their tasks or walking at leisure; and with others again who were wholly unbroken, and who served the purpose of an itinerant larder. At night, when there had been no time to erect an enclosure to hold them, I lay down in their midst, and it was interesting to observe how readily they then availed themselves of the neighbourhood of the camp fire and of man, conscious of the protection they afforded from prowling carnivora, whose cries and roars, now distant, now near, continually broke upon the stillness. These opportunities of studying the disposition of such peculiar cattle were not wasted upon me. I had only too much leisure to think about them, and the habits of the animals strongly attracted my curiosity. The better I understood them, the more complex and worthy of study did their minds appear to be. But I am now concerned only with their blind gregarious instincts, which are conspicuously distinct from the ordinary social desires. In the latter they are deficient; thus they are not amiable to one another, but show on the whole more expressions of spite and disgust than of forbearance or fondness. They do not suffer from an ennui, which society can remove, because their <b>coarse</b> <b>feeding</b> and their ruminant habits make them somewhat stolid. Neither can they love society, as monkeys do, for the opportunities it affords of a fuller and more varied life, because they remain self-absorbed {{in the middle of their}} herd, while the monkeys revel together in frolics, scrambles, fights, loves, and chatterings. Yet although the ox has so little affection for, or individual interest in, his fellows, he cannot endure even a momentary severance from his herd. If he be separated from it by stratagem or force, he exhibits every sign of mental agony; he strives with all his might to get back again, and when he succeeds, he plunges into its middle to bathe his whole body with the comfort of closest companionship. This passionate terror at segregation is a convenience to the herdsman, who may rest assured in the darkness or in the mist that the whole herd is safe whenever he can get a glimpse of a single ox. It is also the cause of great inconvenience to the traveller in ox-waggons, who constantly feels himself in a position towards his oxen like that of a host to a company of bashful gentlemen at the time when he is trying to get them to move from the drawing-room to the dinner-table, and no one will go first, but every one backs and gives place to his neighbour. The traveller finds great difficulty in procuring animals capable of acting the part of fore-oxen to his team, the ordinary members of the wild herd being wholly unfitted by nature to move in so prominent and isolated a position, even though, as is the custom, a boy is always in front to persuade or pull them onwards. Therefore, a good fore-ox is an animal of an exceptionally independent disposition. Men who break in wild cattle for harness watch assiduously for those who show a self-reliant nature, by grazing apart or ahead of the rest, and these they break in for fore-oxen. The other cattle may be indifferently devoted to ordinary harness purposes, or to slaughter; but the born leaders are far too rare to be used for any less distinguished service than that which they alone are capable of fulfilling. But a still more exceptional degree of merit may sometimes be met with among the many thousands of Damara cattle. It is possible to find an ox who may be ridden, not indeed as freely as a horse, for I have never heard of a feat like that, but at all events wholly apart from the companionship of others; and an accomplished rider will even succeed in urging him out at a trot from the very middle of his fellows. With respect to the negative side of the scale, though I do not recollect definite instances, I can recall general impressions of oxen showing a deficiency from the average ox standard of self-reliance, about equal to the excess of that quality found in ordinary fore-oxen. Thus I recollect there were some cattle of a peculiarly centripetal instinct, who ran more madly than the rest into the middle of the herd when they were frightened; and I have no reason to doubt from general recollections that the law of deviation from an average would be as applicable to independence of character among cattle as one might expect it theoretically to be. The conclusion to which we are driven is, that few of the Damara cattle have enough originality and independence of disposition to pass unaided through their daily risks in a tolerably comfortable manner. They are essentially slavish, and seek no better lot than to be led by any one of their number who has enough self-reliance to accept that position. No ox ever dares to act contrary to the rest of the herd, but he accepts their common determination as an authority binding on his conscience.|$|R
40|$|Lewisville Lake Environmental Learning Area (LLELA) is an 809 -hectare {{property}} in Denton County, TX. A {{study of the}} vegetation community identified 466 species in 104 families, with 25 % of the species from only two families, Asteraceae and Poaceae. The property demonstrates the characteristics of an early successional community, dominated by weedy species. Prairie communities are dominated by Johnson grass and ragweed, with climax tall grass prairie communities only in areas that have been planted with native grass seed. Forest communities are similarly in an early successional stage, dominated by the hackberry-elm-ash alliance, with small remnants of native Cross Timbers found in isolated patches. Species richness and diversity were highest in the forests and lowest in the wetlands; evenness, though not different across ecosystems, demonstrated a strong seasonal component. The species list was compared with previously reported lists for Denton County, and 256 species identified had not been previously reported for the county. A wetland restoration {{study was conducted to}} determine if there was a difference in survival and growth between potted transplants with intact root systems and bare-root transplants. Two different mesh sizes were used for protection, and the success of the different caging was evaluated. Of eight species, only four survived through the second growing season. There {{was no significant difference in}} the success of the propagule types for Sagittaria latifolia. The treatments planted with intact root systems showed significantly higher growth and reproduction than the bare-root treatments for Eleocharis quadrangulata, Heteranthera dubia, and Vallisneria americana. There was no survival recorded in the coarse mesh cages, likely due to the presence of crayfish that are able to get through the <b>coarser</b> mesh and <b>feed</b> on the transplants...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} better {{understand}} the interaction between different controlling variables in fluvial systems in a rift basin, and the differences between transverse and axial drainage in the same setting, I present the results of numerical modelling in which downstream grain size trends along the fluvial systems in the Sperchios rift basin in Central Greece are analysed. The model is used to explore the relationship between (1) the spatial distribution of subsidence, (2) sediment supply and (3) downstream grain size fining trends in such systems. The transverse systems drain from the footwall, across the border faults, and <b>feed</b> <b>coarse</b> alluvial fans that prograde into the centre of the rift whereas the axial system supplies sediment to a fine grained birds foot delta in the Maliakos Gulf. The model used has been developed in recent years by Fedele and Paola (2007) and Duller et al. (2010). I first demonstrate how the grain size data from the Sperchios rift is obtained and quantified, and then present the modelling results based on the obtained grain size data, where the effects of - and interaction between - the controlling variables is explored. Furthermore, I demonstrate how the amplitude and spatial distribution of subsidence impacts grain size fining trends and the distribution of deposition and bypassing. I also show how the sediment supplied to the system impacts the grain size fining trends and distribution of deposition and bypassing. For the fluvial systems in the Sperchios rift, I then compare the transverse systems with the axial system. This study indicates that the model developed by Fedele and Paola (2007) and Duller et al. (2010), despite some weaknesses and necessary assumptions, provides a greater understanding of the interaction between the controlling variables impacting fluvial deposition in rifts...|$|R
40|$|Diet {{structure}} and conformation during the starter phase {{play an important}} role in the functional development of the gastro-intestinal (GI) tract of broiler chicken, in particular the foregut segment.   Feed structure has a significant effect on the development of the foregut segments in broiler chickens. The development of the gastro-intestinal tract in chickens is aimed to adapt and to develop in line with the body in order to meet animal's demands for production traits and it should avoid the GI tract malfunction and improper GI tract development. These can be done by changing (alternating) feed properties and in feeding strategies during the starter phase. Chicken's diet components may be treated in order to enable the crop, the proventriculus - gizzard system to function optimally. Thus they will optimize feed digestion and utilisation. Therefore, the focus of this thesis was: 1) To understand the impact of changes in feed properties like technological treatments on broiler's performance. The technological changes in feed were made to induce differences in structure (particle sizes) and appearance (solid or liquid diets) of the feed and how this feed during the starter phase (0 - 3 weeks of age) influences the development and functioning of the foregut (crop and proventriculus); 2) To develop a feeding regime which optimizes foregut development and function of the foregut segment during starter phase and to see if there is a lasting effect on the following period, in other words, whether there is a carry over effect on performance of broilers during the grower phase. It has been shown that the starter period is critical for GI tract development. <b>Feeding</b> <b>coarse</b> diets during the starter phase improves the functional development of the proventriculus -gizzard system. Wet feeding improves feed intake and, as a consequence, broiler performance. Feeding a wet and coarsely ground diet provides a large improvement in feed intake, feed conversion and body weight gain, showing the most pronounced effects during the starter phase of broiler's life...|$|R
