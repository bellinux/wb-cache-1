5|$|Ecuador {{is still}} at risk from earthquakes: Both intraplate (such as those in March 1987) and {{interplate}} earthquakes are possible. Intraplate seismicity poses a more formidable threat, as it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> more powerful than interplate seismicity and is usually associated with landslides, subsidence, and even soil liquefaction.|$|E
5|$|Grasshoppers may be {{confused}} with Ensifera (crickets, etc.), but they differ in many aspects; these include the number of segments in their antennae {{and the structure of}} the ovipositor, as well as the location of the tympanal organ and the methods by which sound is produced. Ensiferans have antennae that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> longer than the body and have at least 20–24 segments, while caeliferans have fewer segments in their shorter, stouter antennae.|$|E
5|$|Silicon-germanium alloys {{are rapidly}} {{becoming}} an important semiconductor material for high-speed integrated circuits. Circuits utilizing {{the properties of}} Si-SiGe junctions <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> faster than those using silicon alone. Silicon-germanium is beginning to replace gallium arsenide (GaAs) in wireless communications devices. The SiGe chips, with high-speed properties, {{can be made with}} low-cost, well-established production techniques of the silicon chip industry.|$|E

5|$|Banksia serrata, {{commonly}} known as old man banksia, saw banksia, saw-tooth banksia and red honeysuckle, is a species of woody shrub or tree of the genus Banksia in the family Proteaceae. Native to {{the east coast of}} Australia, it is found from Queensland to Victoria with outlying populations on Tasmania and Flinders Island. Commonly growing as a gnarled tree up to 16m (50ft) in height, it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> smaller in more exposed areas. This Banksia species has wrinkled grey bark, shiny dark green serrated leaves and large yellow or greyish-yellow flower spikes appearing over summer. The flower spikes, or inflorescences, turn grey as they age and pollinated flowers develop into large, grey, woody seed pods called follicles.|$|E
5|$|Defining {{exactly what}} {{section of a}} DNA {{sequence}} comprises a gene is difficult. Regulatory regions of a gene such as enhancers do not necessarily have {{to be close to}} the coding sequence on the linear molecule because the intervening DNA can be looped out to bring the gene and its regulatory region into proximity. Similarly, a gene's introns <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> larger than its exons. Regulatory regions can even be on entirely different chromosomes and operate in trans to allow regulatory regions on one chromosome to come in contact with target genes on another chromosome.|$|E
5|$|For comparison, Euclid's {{original}} subtraction-based algorithm <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> slower. A single integer {{division is}} equivalent to the quotient q number of subtractions. If the ratio of a and b is very large, the quotient is large and many subtractions will be required. On the other hand, {{it has been shown that}} the quotients are very likely to be small integers. The probability of a given quotient q is approximately ln|u/(u−1)| where u=(q+1)2. For illustration, the probability of a quotient of 1, 2, 3, or 4 is roughly 41.5%, 17.0%, 9.3%, and 5.9%, respectively. Since the operation of subtraction is faster than division, particularly for large numbers, the subtraction-based Euclid's algorithm is competitive with the division-based version. This is exploited in the binary version of Euclid's algorithm.|$|E

5|$|One {{important}} {{characteristic of}} the planets is their intrinsic magnetic moments, which in turn give rise to magnetospheres. The presence of a magnetic field indicates that the planet is still geologically alive. In other words, magnetized planets have flows of electrically conducting material in their interiors, which generate their magnetic fields. These fields significantly change {{the interaction of the}} planet and solar wind. A magnetized planet creates a cavity in the solar wind around itself called the magnetosphere, which the wind cannot penetrate. The magnetosphere <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> larger than the planet itself. In contrast, non-magnetized planets have only small magnetospheres induced by interaction of the ionosphere with the solar wind, which cannot effectively protect the planet.|$|E
5|$|The nearest star to the Earth, {{apart from}} the Sun, is Proxima Centauri, which is 39.9 {{trillion}} kilometres, or 4.2 light-years. Travelling at the orbital speed of the Space Shuttle (8 kilometres per second—almost 30,000 kilometres per hour), it would take about 150,000 years to arrive. km / (3 × 104 km/h × 24 × 365.25) = 1.5 × 105 years. This is typical of stellar separations in galactic discs. Stars <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> closer {{to each other in}} the centres of galaxies and in globular clusters, or much farther apart in galactic halos.|$|E
5|$|Wind shear is an {{important}} aspect of a squall line. In low to medium shear environments, mature thunderstorms will contribute modest amounts of downdrafts, enough to help create a leading edge lifting mechanism – the gust front. In high shear environments created by opposing low level jet winds and synoptic winds, updrafts and consequential downdrafts <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> more intense (common in supercell mesocyclones). The cold air outflow leaves the trailing area of the squall line to the mid-level jet, which aids in downdraft processes.|$|E

25|$|In Judaism, an hour {{is defined}} as 1/12 of the time from sunrise to sunset, so, during the winter, an hour <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> less than 60 minutes, and during the summer, it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> more than 60 minutes. This {{proportional}} hour {{is known as a}} sha'ah z'manit (lit. a timely hour). A Jewish hour is divided into 1080 halakim (singular: helek) or parts. A part is 3⅓ seconds or 1/18 minute. The ultimate ancestor of the helek was a small Babylonian time period called a barleycorn, itself equal to 1/72 of a Babylonian time degree (1° of celestial rotation). These measures are not generally used for everyday purposes.|$|E
