5|$|The {{speed of}} the HPOTP and HPFTP {{turbines}} depends on {{the position of the}} corresponding oxidizer and fuel preburner oxidizer valves. These valves are positioned by the engine controller, which uses them to throttle the flow of liquid oxygen to the preburners and, thus, control engine thrust. The oxidizer and fuel preburner oxidizer valves increase or decrease the liquid oxygen flow, thus increasing or decreasing preburner <b>chamber</b> <b>pressure,</b> HPOTP and HPFTP turbine speed, and liquid oxygen and gaseous hydrogen flow into the main combustion chamber, which increases or decreases engine thrust. The oxidizer and fuel preburner valves operate together to throttle the engine and maintain a constant 6.03:1 propellant mixture ratio.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{elevated}} environment {{pressures on the}} atomization characteristics of a single element, scaled-down, shear-coaxial rocket injector has been investigated. In this study, the shear coaxial injector was operated with water and air as simulants for conventionally used liquid oxygen and hydrogen gas, respectively. The experiments were conducted in a specially designed high pressure rig. A two-component PDPA/DSA system was used to study the spray characteristics at different <b>chamber</b> <b>pressures</b> ranging from atmospheric to 100 psig. The study showed an overall increase in the droplet sizes at higher <b>chamber</b> <b>pressures.</b> This phenomenon is attributed to {{a decrease in the}} secondary atomization effects at higher <b>chamber</b> <b>pressures</b> which, in turn, is directly related to a decrease in the shear experienced by the droplets as they move axially through the <b>pressure</b> <b>chamber...</b>|$|R

25|$|In 2002, the RS-68 {{became the}} first large liquid-propellant rocket engine {{designed}} in the U.S. since the Space Shuttle main engine (SSME) in the 1970s. The primary goal for the RS-68 was to reduce cost versus the SSME. Some sacrifice in <b>chamber</b> <b>pressure</b> and specific impulse was made, hurting efficiency; however, development time, part count, total cost, and assembly labor were reduced to {{a fraction of the}} SSME, despite the RS-68's significantly larger size. Typically, the RS-68 runs at 102% rated thrust for the first few minutes of flight, and then throttles down to 58% rated thrust before main engine cutoff. On the Heavy variant, the main CBC's engine throttles down to 58% rated thrust around 50 seconds after liftoff, while the strap-on CBCs remain at 102%. This allows the main CBC to conserve propellant and burn after booster separation. After the strap-on CBCs separate, the main CBC's engine throttles back up to 102% before throttling back down to 58% prior to main engine cutoff.|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} the {{contract}} was awarded, budgetary pressures meant that the shuttle's design had changed to its final orbiter, external tank and two boosters configuration, and so the engine was only required to power the orbiter during ascent. During the year-long 'Phase B' study period, Rocketdyne {{was able to make}} use of their experience developing the HG-3 engine to design their SSME proposal, producing a prototype by January 1971. The engine made use of a new Rocketdyne-developed copper-zirconium alloy (called NARloy-Z), and was tested on February 12, 1971, producing a <b>chamber</b> <b>pressure</b> of 3172psi. The three participating companies submitted their engine development bids in April 1971, with Rocketdyne being awarded the contract on July 13, 1971—although work did not begin on engine development until March 31, 1972, due to a legal challenge from P ...|$|E
500|$|To further {{complicate the}} practice, the ascent rate may {{vary with the}} depth, and is {{typically}} faster at greater depth and reduces as the depth gets shallower.

500|$|The engine's nozzle is [...] {{long with}} a {{diameter}} of [...] at its throat and [...] at its exit. The nozzle is a bell-shaped extension bolted to the main combustion chamber, {{referred to as a}} de Laval nozzle. The RS-25 nozzle has an unusually large expansion ratio (about 77.5:1) for the <b>chamber</b> <b>pressure.</b> At sea level, a nozzle of this ratio would normally undergo flow separation of the jet from the nozzle, which would cause control difficulties and could even mechanically damage the vehicle. However, to aid the engine's operation [...] Rocketdyne engineers varied the angle of the nozzle walls from the theoretical optimum for thrust, reducing it near the exit. This raises the pressure just around the rim to an absolute pressure between , and prevents flow separation. The inner part of the flow is at much lower pressure, around [...] or less. The inner surface of each nozzle is cooled by liquid hydrogen flowing through brazed stainless steel tube wall coolant passages. On the Space Shuttle, a support ring welded to the forward end of the nozzle is the engine attach point to the orbiter-supplied heat shield. Thermal protection is necessary because of the exposure portions of the nozzles experience during the launch, ascent, on-orbit and entry phases of a mission. The insulation consists of four layers of metallic batting covered with a metallic foil and screening.|$|E

2500|$|Open mode systems, are {{designed}} to find soil flux rates when measuring chamber equilibrium has been reached. Air flows through the chamber before the chamber is closed and sealed. This purges any non-ambient CO2 levels from the chamber before measurement. After the chamber is closed, fresh air is pumped into the chamber at a controlled and programmable flow rate. This mixes with the CO2 from the soil, and after a time, equilibrium is reached. The researcher specifies the equilibrium point as the difference in CO2 measurements between successive readings, in an elapsed time. During the assay, {{the rate of change}} slowly reduces until it meets the customer's rate of change criteria, or the maximum selected time for the assay. [...] Soil flux or rate of change is then determined once equilibrium conditions are reached within the chamber. Chamber flow rates and times are programmable, accurately measured, and used in calculations. These systems have vents that {{are designed}} to prevent a possible unacceptable buildup of partial CO2 pressure discussed under closed mode systems. Since the air movement inside the chamber might cause increased <b>chamber</b> <b>pressure,</b> or external winds may produce reduced <b>chamber</b> <b>pressure,</b> a vent is provided that is designed to be as wind proof as possible.|$|E
