40|$|Identification <b>of</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> {{death was}} {{the topic of}} the Town Hall {{discussion}} at the STP Annual Symposium in 2003 (The Scope). General points of agreement from this discussion were: The responsibility for identifying the <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> death in in-dividual animals is part of the pathologist’s responsibility to interpret compound-related effects. If <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> death cannot be determined, this should be stated. Basic guidelines for addressing the <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> death would be useful.

5|$|American Cocker Spaniels in UK and USA/Canada surveys had {{a median}} {{lifespan}} of about 10 to 11 years, {{which is on}} {{the low end of the}} typical range for purebred dogs, and one to two years less than other breeds of their size. The larger English Cocker Spaniel typically lives about a year longer than the American Cocker Spaniel. In a 2004 UK Kennel Club survey, the most common <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> death were cancer (23%), old age (20%), cardiac (8%), and immune-mediated (8%). In a 2003 USA/Canada Health Survey with a smaller sample size, the leading <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> death were cancer, hepatic disease, and immune-mediated.|$|E

40|$|Fetal {{death or}} {{stillbirth}} {{is a major}} obstetrical complication and a devastating experience for parents. Health care workers are responsible for investigating the <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> death. Unfortunately, the cause remains unexplained in up to two-thirds of fetal deaths. This is partly influenced by lack of consensus on classification <b>of</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> fetal death and diagnostic investigations into <b>causes.</b> Different aspects <b>of</b> classification systems for <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> perinatal mortality were investigated. In this thesis, the main focus is on optimal investigation <b>of</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> intrauterine antepartum fetal death. Therefore, we studied the value of different diagnostics in allocating the underlying <b>cause.</b> The aim <b>of</b> this thesis was to propose an evidence based guideline for diagnostic work-up after fetal death to determine the <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> death. ...|$|R

Incidence of the main expected <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> this increased mortality, leukemia and other cancers, was not significantly higher than normal. Death by those diseases was tabulated {{on the assumption that}} if radiation exposure had a life-shortening effect it would likely show up there, but it did not. Not enough data were gathered on other <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> death to determine the reason for this increase in all-cause mortality, and it remains a mystery.
