Illuminated and shadowed <b>contour</b> lines {{date back to the}} midnineteenth century, but their effectiveness compared to conventional <b>contour</b> lines has not been fully examined. Currently, illuminated and shadowed <b>contour</b> lines are not widely used in computer-based cartography because they are not included in most GIS apmaking software. This article introduces improvements to existing algorithms for creating illuminated and shadowed <b>contour</b> lines from digital elevation data. A software package is made available to allow mapmakers to more easily make customized illuminated and shadowed <b>contour</b> maps. A user study comparing illuminated and shadowed <b>contour</b> lines to conventional <b>contour</b> lines and shaded relief with approximately 400 participants was conducted. Results indicate that map-readers can interpret relative height differences between points better and quicker with illuminated <b>contour</b> lines than regular <b>contour</b> lines or shaded relief. Study participants were able to select absolute maxima on an unlabeled illuminated <b>contour</b> map and a labeled regular <b>contour</b> map with equal accuracy and speed.

40|$|<b>Contour</b> pixels {{distinguish}} {{objects from}} the background. Tracing and extracting <b>contour</b> pixels are widely used for smart/wearable image sensor devices, because these are simple and useful for detecting objects. In this paper, we present a novel contour-tracing algorithm for fast and accurate <b>contour</b> following. The proposed algorithm classifies the type of <b>contour</b> pixel, based on its local pattern. Then, it traces the next <b>contour</b> using the previous pixel’s type. Therefore, it can classify the type of <b>contour</b> pixels as a straight line, inner corner, outer corner and inner-outer corner, and it can extract pixels of a specific <b>contour</b> type. Moreover, it can trace <b>contour</b> pixels rapidly because it can determine the local minimal path using the <b>contour</b> case. In addition, the proposed algorithm is capable of the compressing data of <b>contour</b> pixels using the representative points and inner-outer corner points, and it can accurately restore the <b>contour</b> image from the data. To compare {{the performance of the}} proposed algorithm to that of conventional techniques, we measure their processing time and accuracy. In the experimental results, the proposed algorithm shows better performance compared to the others. Furthermore, it can provide the compressed data of <b>contour</b> pixels and restore them accurately, including the inner-outer corner, which cannot be restored using conventional algorithms...|$|R
