Almost seven million citizens a day are using sub-ways as a means of traffic communication in the Seoul metropolitan city in 2012. However, the subway system is a semi-closed environment, so many serious problems occurred in subway stations and injured passengers ’ health. Plat-form screen doors (PSD) are expected to prevent negligent accident such as injury or death from falling and improve the air quality of the subway station. Installation of PSD at stations in Seoul metropolitan subway had been completed in December 2009. Consequently, the underground transportation system became a closed environment, so the air quality has improved the platforms, but it has deteriorated in the tunnels. Especially, the subway cabin has many doors, and the doors are frequently opened and closed. For this reason, the effect of door opening on subway cabin, dust flow inside the subway cabin. In this process, the maintenance work may influence the health of people who work underground, {{as well as that of}} subway users (passengers).

When, in 1973, the traditional site of the fort was threatened by a Department of Natural Resources parking lot, the Marion County Historical Society created the Prickett’s Fort Memorial Foundation and announced plans to reconstruct the historic structure. [...] Discovering that the original fort site had probably been destroyed by {{the building of a}} railroad bridge in 1905, the Foundation decided to put the reconstruction on a small hill overlooking the river. Many old buildings donated to the project were torn down to provide timbers for the reconstruction.

40|$|Cabin noise {{generation}} {{is an important}} issue to accompany the weight saving strategies for pollutant emission reduction. The turbulent boundary layer forces vibrations on the fuselage which are transmitted and radiated into the <b>cabin</b> by the <b>lining,</b> the floor and the windows. In addition the engine and system noise like the hydraulic system and the air conditioning unit contribute to the cabin sound field. To improve the noise-depending comfort in cabins the contribution of each the sound radiating lining and/or the air conditioning have to be distinguished. The sound intensity measurement technique can be applied in this difficult environment (reverberant sound field) to measure the energy contribution of the lining. Nevertheless, this method is very time-consuming.

But if twenty came and sat in my house there was nothing said about dinner, though there might be bread enough for two, more than if eating were a forsaken habit; but we naturally practised abstinence; and this was never felt to be an offence against hospitality, but the most proper and considerate course. The waste and decay of physical life, which so often needs repair, seemed miraculously retarded in such a case, and the vital vigor stood its ground. I could entertain thus a thousand as well as twenty; and if any ever went away disappointed or hungry from my house when they found me at home, they may depend upon it that I sympathized with them at least. So easy is it, though many housekeepers doubt it, to establish new and better customs in the place of the old. You need not rest your reputation on the dinners you give.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the advantages and}} disadvantages of cable cars in public transport within urban areas. The advantages of cable car transport compared to other modes of transport are its quiet operation with an environmentally-acceptable electric drive and the possibility of transporting passengers above the ground, which can provide additional transport dimensions within urban centers. However, cable cars have some disadvantages, especially their smaller capacities in relation to other modes of transport within the urban environment. Today 2 ̆ 7 s built cable cars have capacities up to 2, 000 persons/h for aerial tramways (or jig-back ropeways) and up to 4, 000 persons/h for gondolas. Solutions are introduced in this paper as to how the current cable car technologies can increase the capacities of these devices. This can be achieved by concentrating on the vehicles (<b>cabins)</b> on gondola <b>lines</b> and by using multiple platforms at starting stations and final stations. It also provides a solution for intermediate stations, at which vehicles can be stopped independent of other vehicles on the line...|$|R
50|$|The dead caribou {{drifting}} {{and beginning}} to accumulate along the eastern shore line of the Koksoak River were first noted by the residents of Kuujjuaq, but {{the cause of the}} deaths was not confirmed until a team of wildlife biologists and technicians from the Newfoundland-Labrador Wildlife Division arrived by helicopter to participate in a joint cooperative effort with the Québec Recreation, Hunting and Fishing Department to live-capture and radio-collar caribou swimming across the Koksoak River. Kuujjuaq residents, who were familiar with the river, reported seasonal water levels far higher than normally recorded in recent history. Autumn boat stages, shore <b>line</b> <b>cabin</b> sites and tributary beaver lodges were being flooded.

Coves and backwater were choked with the floating carcasses of dead caribou, with accumulations becoming increasingly larger in approaching the base of the Falls.|$|R
