50|$|In South Africa, cutworms are {{the most}} {{important}} of the many insect pests that attack the <b>cape</b> <b>gooseberry</b> in seedbeds; red spiders after plants have been established in the field; and the potato tuber moth if the <b>cape</b> <b>gooseberry</b> is in the vicinity of potato fields. Hares damage young plants, and birds eat the fruits if not repelled. In India, mites may cause defoliation. In Jamaica, the leaves were suddenly riddled by what were apparently flea beetles. In the Bahamas, whitefly attacks on the very young plants and flea beetles on the flowering plants required control.|$|E
50|$|Physalis peruviana, a {{plant species}} of the genus Physalis, is {{originally}} from Peru. The plant and its fruit are most commonly known as <b>Cape</b> <b>gooseberry</b> (South Africa, UK, Australia, New Zealand), or Physalis.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Cape</b> <b>gooseberry</b> {{grows in}} northeastern China Heilongjiang Province as a {{seasonal}} fruit harvested in late August through September. In Chinese pinyin, the fruit is informally {{referred to as}} gu niao or mao suan jiang.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to optimize mass transfer during pulsed vacuum osmotic dehydration (PVOD) of <b>cape</b> <b>gooseberries</b> (Physalis peruviana L.) by means of the surface response methodology. The effects of the factors temperature (25 - 45 ºC), solids (50 - 70 ºBrix), rotation speed (60 - 100 rpm), pressure (50 - 100 mbar) and number of vacuum pulses (1 - 3) on osmotic dehydration, weight reduction percentage (WR), water loss percentage (WL), and solid gain percentage (SG%) were assessed. Sucrose syrup at a 5 / 1 syrup/fruit ratio was used for 2 h. The results provided 45 ºC, 70 ºBrix, 99. 99 rpm, 98. 92 mbar and 2. 87 pulse vacuum, for a WR of 47. 52 %, WL of 21. 12 %, and SG of 118. 40 % as the optimal conditions. Mathematic models were adjusted to the optimal conditions to describe the PVOD kinetics of <b>cape</b> <b>gooseberries.</b> Azuara’s penetration empiric model, a phenomenological model from the solution of Fick’s second law, and Peleg’s empiric model were used. The latter adjusted better to the experiment data...|$|R
50|$|According to {{nutrient}} analyses by the USDA, a 100 g {{serving of}} <b>Cape</b> <b>gooseberries</b> {{is low in}} calories (53 kcal) and contains moderate levels of vitamin C, thiamin and niacin, while other nutrients are negligible (see table). Analyses of oil from different berry components, primarily its seeds, showed that linoleic acid and oleic acid were the main fatty acids, beta-sitosterol and campesterol as principal phytosterols, and the oil contained vitamin K and beta-carotene.|$|R

50|$|Many Physalis {{species are}} called groundcherries. One name for Physalis peruviana is Inca berry; another is <b>Cape</b> <b>gooseberry,</b> {{not to be}} {{confused}} with the true gooseberries, which are of the genus Ribes in the family Grossulariaceae. Other names used to refer to the fruit are poha berries, and simply golden berries.|$|E
5000|$|Petunia is genus of 35 {{species of}} [...] {{flowering}} plants of South American origin, {{closely related to}} tobacco, <b>cape</b> <b>gooseberries,</b> tomatoes, deadly nightshades, potatoes and chili peppers in the same family, Solanaceae. The popular flower {{of the same name}} derived its epithet from the French, which took the word petun, meaning [...] "tobacco," [...] from a Tupi-Guarani language. An annual, most of the varieties seen in gardens are hybrids (P. × atkinsiana, also known as P. × hybrida).|$|R
50|$|Tomatillos {{are a key}} {{ingredient}} in fresh and cooked Mexican and Central-American green sauces. The green color and tart flavor are the main culinary contributions of the fruit. Purple and red-ripening cultivars often have a slight sweetness, unlike the green- and yellow-ripening cultivars, and are therefore generally used in jams and preserves. Like their close relatives, <b>cape</b> <b>gooseberries,</b> tomatillos have a high pectin content. Another characteristic is {{they tend to have}} a varying degree of a sappy sticky coating, mostly when used on the green side out of the husk.|$|R
50|$|Whitley Neill Gin is an award-winning, hand crafted premium London Dry gin. The {{inspiration}} of the gin {{comes from the}} vivid beauty & mystery of Africa. It is distilled in small batches by Johnny Neill, a direct descendant of Thomas Greenall & the last {{in a long line}} of distillers. It is produced in small batches in an antique copper pot still, and contains two African botanicals — Baobab Fruit and <b>Cape</b> <b>Gooseberries</b> as well as coriander seeds, sweet lemon, sweet orange, angelica root, cassia bark, florentine iris and juniper berries.|$|R
50|$|The first {{official}} brewer in Australia was John Boston who brewed a beverage from Indian corn bittered with <b>cape</b> <b>gooseberry</b> leaves. It is likely though that beer was brewed unofficially much earlier. The first pub, the Mason Arms was opened in 1796 in Parramatta by James Larra, a freed convict.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Cape</b> <b>gooseberry</b> is {{native to}} the Americas, but is common in many {{subtropical}} areas. Its use in South Africa near the Cape of Good Hope inspired its common name. Other species of commercial importance include the tomatillo (P. philadelphica). Some nations, such as Colombia, have a significant economic trade in Physalis fruit.|$|E
50|$|Physalis peruviana (from South America) fruits are marketed in the United States most {{commonly}} as goldenberry and sometimes Pichuberry, named after Machu Picchu {{in order to}} associate the fruit with its origin in Peru and address {{the fact that this}} fruit is actually not a gooseberry as the name <b>Cape</b> <b>gooseberry</b> implies.|$|E
50|$|After {{the initial}} June 2008 {{discovery}} of the new species of Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum, 14 countries implemented bans on various New Zealand crops and New Zealand withdrew export certification for tomatoes and capsicums as a precautionary measure. New Zealand's export certification has since been reinstated and some countries have indicated they will accept fruit again. Fiji stopped imports from New Zealand of potatoes, tomatoes, and capsicum, but ended the bans in July 2008. While French Polynesia did not ban any crops immediately, its restrictions were deemed unreasonable by New Zealand and all potato and capsicum exports to French Polynesia were halted. Having previously blocked imports of potatoes, Australia expanded that ban to include capsicum, tomatoes, <b>cape</b> <b>gooseberries,</b> tomarillos, and five other crops.|$|R
60|$|Now, as in a dream, Rachel {{descended the}} steep, rock-strewn {{banks of the}} dry branch of the river-bed, wending her way between the {{boulders}} and noting that rotten weeds and peeled brushwood rested against the stems of the mimosa thorns which grew--there, tokens which told her that here in times of flood the water flowed. Well, there was little enough of it now, only a pool or two to form a mirror for the lightning. In front of her lay the island where grew the <b>Cape</b> <b>gooseberries,</b> or winter cherries as they are sometimes called, which she came to seek. It was a low piece of ground, {{a quarter of a}} mile long, perhaps, but in the centre of it were some great rocks and growing among the rocks, trees, one of them higher than the rest. Beyond it ran the true river, even now at the end of the dry season three or four hundred yards in breadth, though so shallow that it could be forded by an ox-drawn waggon.|$|R
60|$|Here {{were to be}} seen great {{heaps of}} {{earthenware}} of red clay--pans for cooking rice, water-jars, bottles, and dishes of all sorts, as well as English crockery, especially that with the old willow-pattern design! There were great varieties of straw hats, beautifully made of rice and other straw. Elsewhere might be seen iron-work of native manufacture, some of it displaying considerable taste and skilful workmanship. There were also beds, with well-turned posts, made of a wood like mahogany, and the mattresses for these were stuffed with down from a certain flower, which made soft and comfortable couches. Lambas of many kinds were also to be seen, from those of coarse rofia cloth to those of finer and more ornamental material--though the finest silk lambas and the more expensive European goods were not often exposed for sale there, but were to be had at the houses of the traders and manufacturers. One part of the market was devoted to wood for the rafters and framework of houses, another to the sale of vegetables and fruits--among which were sweet potatoes, manioc, beans, maize, peaches, bananas, mangoes, pine-apples, oranges, lemons, pumpkins, melons, grapes, <b>Cape</b> <b>gooseberries,</b> mulberries, guavas, pomegranates, and many others, besides bread-fruit and rice--which last is the staple food of the people.|$|R
50|$|Petunia is a genus in {{the family}} Solanaceae, {{subfamily}} Petunioideae. Well known members of Solanaceae in other subfamilies include tobacco (Nicotianoideae), and the <b>cape</b> <b>gooseberry,</b> tomato, potato, deadly nightshades and chili pepper (Solanoideae). Some botanists place the plants of the genus Calibrachoa in the genus Petunia, {{but this is not}} accepted by others. Petchoa is a hybrid genus derived from crossing Calibrachoa and Petunia.|$|E
5000|$|Not {{long after}} its {{introduction}} to South Africa, Physalis peruviana was introduced into Australia, New Zealand, and various Pacific islands. In South Africa, it is commercially cultivated; canned fruits and jam are common, often exported. It is also cultivated and naturalized {{on a small}} scale in Gabon and other parts of Central Africa. It is grown in India where it is called <b>cape</b> <b>gooseberry.</b>|$|E
50|$|Colombia's varied cuisine is {{influenced}} by its diverse fauna and flora {{as well as the}} cultural traditions of the ethnic groups. Colombian dishes and ingredients vary widely by region. Some of the most common ingredients are: cereals such as rice and maize; tubers such as potato and cassava; assorted legumes; meats, including beef, chicken, pork and goat; fish; and seafood. Colombia cuisine also features a variety of tropical fruits such as <b>cape</b> <b>gooseberry,</b> feijoa, arazá, dragon fruit, mangostino, granadilla, papaya, guava, blackberry, lulo, soursop and passionfruit.|$|E
6000|$|And now a word {{as regards}} the {{delusions}} of the dear Ross, who remembers, I believe, my letters and Fanny's when we were first installed, and were really hoeing a hard row. We have salad, beans, cabbages, tomatoes, asparagus, kohl-rabi, oranges, limes, barbadines, pine-apples, <b>Cape</b> <b>gooseberries</b> - galore; pints of milk and cream; fresh meat five days a week. [...] It is the rarest thing {{for any of us}} to touch a tin; and the gnashing of teeth when {{it has to be done}} is dreadful - for no one who has not lived on them for six months knows what the Hatred of the Tin is. As for exposure, my weakness is certainly the reverse; I am sometimes a month without leaving the verandah - for my sins, be it said! Doubtless, when I go about and, as the Doctor says, 'expose myself to malaria,' I am in far better health; and I would do so more too - for I do not mean to be silly - but the difficulties are great. [...] However, you see how much the dear Doctor knows of my diet and habits! Malaria practically does not exist in these islands; it is a negligeable quantity. What really bothers us a little is the mosquito affair - the so-called elephantiasis - ask Ross about it. A real romance of natural history, QUOI! ...|$|R
50|$|The genus Physalis {{produces}} the so-called groundcherries, {{as well as}} the tomatillo (Physalis philadelphica), the <b>Cape</b> <b>gooseberry</b> and the Chinese lantern. The genus Lycium contains the boxthorns and the wolfberry Lycium barbarum. Nicotiana contains, among other species, tobacco. Some other important members of Solanaceae include a number of ornamental plants such as Petunia, Browallia, and Lycianthes, and sources of psychoactive alkaloids, Datura, Mandragora (mandrake), and Atropa belladonna (deadly nightshade). Certain species are widely known for their medicinal uses, their psychotropic effects, or for being poisonous.|$|E
50|$|In 1796, {{with the}} aid of an encyclopedia, Boston {{produced}} the first fermented alcohol beverage made at Sydney, which sold for 1s 6d (1 shilling, 6 pence). The corn beer, being made by Boston, was brewed from properly malted maize and bittered with the leaves and stalks of the love apple, (Lycopersicum, a species of Solanum), or as it was more commonly called in the settlement, the <b>Cape</b> <b>gooseberry.</b> Boston found this succeeded so well, that he erected at some expense a building for the business and was, engaged in brewing and making soap.|$|E

50|$|After flowering, most {{plants have}} no more use for the calyx which withers or becomes vestigial. Some plants retain a thorny calyx, either dried or live, as {{protection}} for the fruit or seeds. Examples include species of Acaena, some of the Solanaceae (for example the Tomatillo, Physalis philadelphica), and the water caltrop, Trapa natans. In some species the calyx not only persists after flowering, but instead of withering, begins to grow until it forms a bladder-like enclosure around the fruit. This is an effective protection against some kinds of birds and insects, for example in Hibiscus trionum and the <b>Cape</b> <b>gooseberry.</b>|$|E
50|$|Physalis alkekengi (bladder cherry, Chinese lantern, Japanese-lantern, {{strawberry}} groundcherry, or winter cherry;) is {{a relative}} of P. peruviana (<b>Cape</b> <b>gooseberry).</b> It is easily identifiable by the large, bright orange to red papery covering over its fruit, which resembles paper lanterns. It grows naturally in the regions covering Southern Europe to South Asia and Japan. It is a perennial herbaceous plant growing to 40-60 cm tall, with spirally arranged leaves 6-12 cm long and 4-9 cm broad. The flowers are white, with a five-lobed corolla 10-15 mm across, with an inflated basal calyx which matures into the papery orange fruit covering, 4-5 cm long and broad.|$|E
50|$|Not all Physalis species bear edible fruit. Select {{species are}} {{cultivated}} for their edible fruit, however; the typical Physalis fruit {{is similar to}} a firm tomato in texture, and like strawberries or pineapple in flavor, with a mild acidity. Some species, such as the <b>Cape</b> <b>gooseberry</b> and tomatillo have been bred into many cultivars with varying flavors, from tart to sweet to savory. Physalis fruit are rich in cryptoxanthin.The fruit can be used like the tomato. Once extracted from its husk, it can be eaten raw and used in salads. Some varieties are added to desserts, used as flavoring, made into fruit preserves, or dried and used like raisins. They contain pectin and can be used in pie filling. Ground cherries are called Poha in native Hawaiian, and poha jam and preserves are traditional desserts made from Physalis plants native to the Hawaiian Islands.|$|E
50|$|Palila also eat naio {{berries and}} other fruit (such as the {{introduced}} <b>Cape</b> <b>gooseberry),</b> and māmane flowers, buds, and young leaves. Additionally, they feed on caterpillars, {{particularly those of}} Cydia species (māmane codling moths) and more rarely on those of Uresiphita polygonalis virescens (māmane snout moth). These caterpillars {{as well as other}} insects, along with the very nutritious māmane seeds, provide the palila's main source of protein. Nestlings, apparently not yet able to cope with the amount of poison contained in the seeds, are fed to a large extent on Cydia caterpillars. These destroy or discard the māmane's toxins they take up with their food, so that the caterpillars themselves are non-toxic. They do contain high amounts of phenolic compounds they probably sequester from their food and quite likely taste as bad. Palila do not seem to mind the adverse taste or are physically unable to perceive it, given that they {{go to great lengths to}} obtain this food during breeding season.|$|E
5000|$|The {{sweet potato}} {{is native to}} America and was domesticated there at least 5,000 years ago. The much lower {{molecular}} diversity found in Peru and Ecuador. Only two varieties of sweet potato are commonly available {{for sale in the}} markets [...] But there are more varieties around the country. One has dry orange flesh and light tan skin and tastes sweet. The other has purple skin, is white and brown inside, and is only moderately sweet. Occasionally another variety, characterized by small tubers and dark skin, is available. Potatoes are available in a big variety. Peru has around more than 5000 varieties of potatoes, the biggest on the world. The two most common potatoes are a white flesh type and a more expensive yellow flesh type. The only commercially available native fruits native to the Andes region in general (Peru, Bolivia) are lucuma, camu camu, prickly pear, <b>cape</b> <b>gooseberry,</b> cocona, pacay (technically a legume but used as a fruit), guanabana, dragon fruit, pepino, papaya, ciruela, mammee apple, banana passionfruit, cherimoya, granadilla, moriche palm fruit, and tamarillo. Yacon, although an underground tuber, is also used as a fruit. None of the other native fruits are commercially available.|$|E
