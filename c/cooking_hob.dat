The definitive version is available at: [URL] The aim of the pilot study was to provide information about the design and use of saucepan handles to enable clinicians and designers to specify and provide products that are more appropriate for use by people with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). The objectives were: to evaluate aspects of new handle design for saucepans in terms of their ease of use for people with RA; document hand grip strength and configuration (grip patterns); record relevant anthropometric data to aid the development of new designs and perform an assessment of lifting techniques used in conjunction with perceived optimum handle configuration. Method/Results: Observation and video footage show that subjects continued to use familiar, but damaging, ways of lifting the saucepan even after extensive joint protection training by occupational therapists. Grip strengths recorded using a sphygmomanometer were similar to those found by other studies. The anthropometric measurements taken from the sample group were found to be within available anthropometric surveys of able-bodied people. However, hand length within the sample group with RA was longer than the equivalent in surveys of able-bodied subjects. Conclusions: Subjects preferred the narrower handles with some surface texture to the larger and more rounded tapered handles. Large handled saucepans were found not to be viable due to the constraints of UK <b>cooking</b> <b>hob</b> sizes and existing British Standards relating to saucepan specification...|$|E

40|$|Human {{exposure}} to intermediate frequency magnetic fields (MF) is increasing due to applications like electronic article surveillance systems and induction heating <b>cooking</b> <b>hobs.</b> However, limited data {{is available on}} their possible health effects. The present study assessed behavioral and histopathological consequences of exposing mice to 7. 5 kHz MF at 12 or 120 μT for 5 weeks. No effects were observed on body weight, spontaneous activity, motor coordination, level of anxiety or aggression. In the Morris swim task, mice in the 120 μT group showed less steep learning curve than the other groups, but {{did not differ from}} controls in their search bias in the probe test. The passive avoidance task indicated a clear impairment of memory over 48 h in the 120 μT group. No effects on astroglial activation or neurogenesis were observed in the hippocampus. The mRNA expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor did not change but expression of the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha mRNA was significantly increased in the 120 μT group. These findings suggest that 7. 5 kHz MF exposure may lead to mild learning and memory impairment, possibly through an inflammatory reaction in the hippocampus...|$|R
40|$|Many {{technologies}} {{have been created}} {{in order to simplify}} our everyday life and technology in the kitchen is not an exception. Indeed, evolution in the dimension of technology is keeping growing up from the first micro wave to the recent induction <b>cooking</b> <b>hobs.</b> The precision <b>cooking</b> method is also part of these new technologies but have not been adopted by many households yet. In this paper, consumer perception has been investigated to identify the hindrances to acceptation of precision cooking technique in households. These brakes have been investigating through implementing a consumer survey in the United States. An online questionnaire has been answered by 280 north-American people for one month including hypothesis testing. 	Three groups of people have been identified during the research: “Don’t know precision cooking method”, “Know the precision cooking method” and “Use the precision cooking method”. As a general opinion people who have already experience a food product cooked using this specific method was positive. The group of people not familiar with the technique have a bigger interest than the one who know it already. However, both groups perceive the precision cooking method or so called “sous-vide” technique, as complexed and time consuming. These two dimensions being the major factors they look at while purchasing a new kitchen appliance before looking at the price. The resistance to change and the nutrition aspect are the major brakes tested in the survey not to use the precision cooking method at home. These results may help professionals in this cooking method such as immersion circulator producers to communicate effectively on this new cooking method and as a result attract new users...|$|R
5000|$|Käthe Krämer {{was born}} in Hüttersdorf, {{a small town in}} the hills to the north of Saarlouis. Her mother was young and at that time unmarried. In order to support herself and her {{daughter}} she worked as a domestic servant, while Käthe spent the early part of her childhood living with her grandparents and with other relatives. [...] After her mother married the machinist, Emil Schaub, Käthe was adopted by her step father, and spent the rest of her childhood as the eldest of her parents' (eventually) twelve children. [...] Emil Schaub's wages from his work with F. Küppersbusch & Söhne AG (which at that time claimed to be the country's largest supplier of <b>cooking</b> <b>hobs</b> and ovens) at their factory in nearby Schalke were quickly spent as the family grew: hunger and material shortage were, as for the families of many industrial workers in Germany at that time, regular features of Käthe Schaub's childhood. She attended school locally and then, as the eldest child, immediately transferred to work at a textile factory {{in order to be able}} to contribute to the family's income. [...] Influenced by her step father, in 1910 she joined a trades union as a textiles worker. [...] Two years later she joined the Social Democratic Party ("Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands" [...] / SPD). [...] After seven years in the textiles factory, in 1913 she moved to Berlin. In September 1917 she returned to the north-west of Germany, obtaining a job as a housekeeper in Rheydt. She lost her job at the end of the war, and a period of unemployment followed.|$|R
40|$|Induction <b>cooking</b> <b>hobs</b> {{have greatly}} gained in {{popularity}} m Europe during the 1980 's. This fact has {{focused attention on}} the particular problems encountered in their design. To this day, the design approaches remain largely empirical This thesis presents an analysis technique specially adapted to the induction hob generator The series resonant converter is seen to be widely used in the induction cooking application. As a first step, a technique for determining steady-state operation of the converter is presented. This is done for all the operation modes and control schemes encountered. The technique in question {{is based on the}} well known state plane but has been adapted for use in induction. This technique is then extended {{to make use of the}} properties of the state plane in order to demonstrate the behaviour of the converter under various load and control conditions. At this point, the didactic qualities of the state plane representation are exploited to their full in order to demonstrate the intricate relationships between the operation of the series resonant converter and its load impedance. All of the work described in the previous paragraph is based on the assumption of knowing the load impedance of the converter. This reveals itself to be a major assumption, given the variety of loads that can be encountered by an induction hob and the difficulties involved in measuring or modelling such a load. In order to allow the verification of this technique with respect to real cases, a load measurement technique is presented. This technique overcomes the pitfalls of existing techniques by carrying out analyses on wave forms measured m-situ while the converter is working. This contrasts with the existing techniques which measure the isolated load at low signal levels...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, the European Ecodesign Directive {{has emerged}} as a new {{approach}} to integrate environmental concerns into the product design and related processes. Ecodesign aims to minimize environmental impacts throughout the product life cycle, without compromising performances and costs. In addition, the recent Ecodesign Directives require products which are increasingly eco-friendly and eco-efficient, preserving high-performances. It is very important for producers measuring performances, for electric <b>cooking</b> ranges, <b>hobs,</b> ovens, and grills for household use, and a low power consumption of appliances represents a powerful selling point, also in terms of ecodesign requirements. The Ecodesign Directive provides a clear framework about the sustainable design of products and it has been extended in 2009 to all energy-related products, or products with an impact on energy consumption during the use. The European Regulation establishes measures of ecodesign of ovens, hobs, and kitchen hoods, and domestic use and energy efficiency of a product has a significant environmental aspect in the use phase which is the most impactful in the life cycle. It is important that the product parameters and performances are not affected by ecodesign requirements from a user’s point of view, and the benefits of reducing energy consumption in the use phase should offset the possible environmental impact in the production stage. Accurate measurements of cooking appliance performance are essential to help the industry to produce more energy efficient appliances. The development of ecodriven products requires ecoinnovation and ecodesign tools to support the sustainability improvement. The ecodesign tools should be practical and focused on specific ecoobjectives in order to be largely diffused. The main scope of this paper is the development, implementation, and testing of an innovative tool, which could be an improvement for the sustainable design of induction hobs. In particular, a prototypical software tool is developed in order to simulate the energy performances of the induction hobs. The tool is focused on a multiphysics model which is able to simulate the energy performances and the efficiency of induction hobs starting from the design data. The multiphysics model is composed by an electromagnetic simulation and a thermal simulation. The electromagnetic simulation is able to calculate the eddy current induced in the pot, which leads to the Joule heating of material. The thermal simulation is able to measure the energy consumption during the operational phase. The Joule heating caused from the eddy currents is the output of electromagnetic simulation and the input of thermal ones. The aims of the paper are the development of integrated tools and methodologies of virtual prototyping {{in the context of the}} ecodesign. This tool could be a revolutionary instrument in the field of industrial engineering and it gives consideration to the environmental aspects of product design and focus on the ecodesign of energy-related products, in order to achieve a reduced environmental impact...|$|R
40|$|The European Union, {{through its}} SAVE II programme, aims at {{promoting}} the rational use of energy within the community. SAVE II is a non-technological programme with many elements, among others labelling, standardisation and other {{actions in the}} area of energy-using equipment. This report summarises the results of the Working Group on Efficient Domestic Ovens. The {{purpose of this study is}} to identify possible EU Commission actions to improve the efficiency of domestic electric and gas ovens and to develop a common basis for possible national actions. The study focuses on conventional domestic ovens only. Other ways of <b>cooking,</b> such as <b>hobs,</b> microwave ovens, grills and electric kettles are not taken into consideration. Possibilities for and impacts of fuel switching are also outside the scope of this study. However, a wide range of possibilities to improve energy efficiency, and related policy options, are discussed in a qualitative way, to give a more complete picture of ovens in the context of climate policies. The study, financed by the SAVE II Programme (with supplementary financing from NOVEM for the Dutch partner) was carried out in 1998 - 1999 by research teams from eight countries. Representatives of NOVEM and CECED as well as those of the relevant working groups of CENELEC (CLC/TC 59 X/WG 3) and CEN (CEN/TC 49 /WG 2) have participated in the meetings. CECED has also provided data for a number of tasks. The work was organised in six tasks. The aim of Task 1 was to establish the real life energy consumption of the ovens concerned, as opposed to the energy consumption according to the test standard. Task 2 was to provide a statistical analysis of the European gas and electric ovens market. The purpose of Task 3 was to review, identify, and analyse energy-saving design options for domestic ovens. Task 4 was to assess the environmental impacts of scenarios concerning the efficiency improvements of domestic ovens. A stock model methodology was used. Task 5 aimed at analysing the different impacts of efficiency policies on manufacturers. The aim of Task 6 was to give the information necessary to develop an appropriate mix of policies. The focus is on actions at EU level. The following policy options were analysed: • EU energy labels which are warranted for domestic ovens through directive n...|$|R
