40|$|A {{hydrogen}} recombiner has a recombination tank (1) whose main axis (2) is basically aligned {{in parallel with}} the effect of gravity; the recombination tank features inlet valves (12), outlet valves (17) and catalyst surfaces (9) of a non-restrictive catalyst aligned in parallel with the main axis (2). The inlet valves (12) and the outlet valves (17) can be closed by a hydrogen detector arranged in {{the proximity of the}} inlet aperture (11). An electronic window circuit generates control signals for at least one <b>closing</b> <b>motor</b> for the inlet valves (12) and the outlet valves (17). The <b>closing</b> <b>motor</b> performs infinitely variable adjustment of the aperture width of the inlet valve (12) and the outlet valve (17). The lower limit of the window circuit is in the order of a few tenths of hydrogen concentration in air, and the upper limit is in the range of three to four per cent of the hydrogen concentration. At a hydrogen concentration outside the predefined window of the window circuit, a closing signal is generated for the valves (12, 17) ...|$|E

25|$|The {{problem of}} smoking {{at home is}} {{particularly}} difficult for women in many cultures (especially Arab cultures), where {{it may not be}} acceptable for a woman to ask her husband not to smoke at home or in the presence of her children. Studies have shown that pollution levels for smoking areas indoors are higher than levels found on busy roadways, in <b>closed</b> <b>motor</b> garages, and during fire storms. Furthermore, smoke can spread from one room to another, even if doors to the smoking area are closed.|$|R
50|$|There {{has been}} {{increasing}} popularity in <b>closed</b> loop stepper <b>motors</b> in recent years. They act like servomotors but have some differences in their software control to get smooth motion. The top 3 manufacturers of <b>closed</b> loop stepper <b>motor</b> systems employ magnetic encoders as their feedback device of choice due to low cost and resistance to vibration. The main benefit of a <b>closed</b> loop stepper <b>motor</b> is the cost to performance ratio. There is also no need to tune the PID controller on a closed loop stepper system.|$|R

40|$|Simultaneous {{intracellular}} recordings {{have been}} made from the two expiratory, and from the two inspiratory motor neurones which have their axons in the unpaired median nerves of the thoracic ganglia. Each motor neurone has an axon that branches to innervate muscles {{on the left and}} {{on the right side of}} one segment. The expiratory neurones studied were those in the meso- and meta-thoracic ganglia which innervate spiracular closer muscles. The depolarizing synaptic potentials underlying the spikes during expiration are common to the two <b>closer</b> <b>motor</b> neurones in a particular segment. Similarly, during inspiration when there are usually no spikes, the hyperpolarizing, inhibitory potentials are also common to both motor neurones. The synaptic input to the neurones can be derived from four interneurones; two responsible for the depolarizing potentials during expiration and two for the inhibitory potentials during inspiration. The inspiratory neurones studied were those in the abdominal ganglia fused to the metathoracic ganglion which innervate dorso-ventral abdominal muscles. During inspiration the two motor neurones of one segment spike at a similar and steady frequency. The underlying synaptic input to the two is common. During expiration, when there are usually no spikes, the hyper-polarizing synaptic potentials are also common to both neurones. In addition they match exactly the depolarizing potentials occurring at the same time in the <b>closer</b> <b>motor</b> neurones. The same set of interneurones could be responsible. No evidence has been revealed to indicate that the two closer, or the two inspiratory motor neurones of one segment are directly coupled by electrical or chemical synapses. The morphology of both types of motor neurone is distinct from that of other motor neurones in these ganglia. Both types branch extensively in both the left and in the right areas of the neuropile...|$|R
