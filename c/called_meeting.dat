500|$|Maryland Route 404 Business (MD 404 Bus.) is a [...] long {{business}} {{route of}} MD 404 {{through the town}} of Denton in Caroline County. The route runs along the former alignment of MD 404 that was bypassed by the divided, four-lane Denton Bypass. MD 404 Bus. branches off from MD 404 west of Denton by heading southeast on a two-lane divided road <b>called</b> <b>Meeting</b> House Road that soon becomes undivided as it passes through farmland with some businesses. As it comes to MD 328 (New Bridge Road) in West Denton, the route passes near residences. [...] The road crosses the Choptank River into Denton, where it becomes Franklin Street. Shortly after the river, MD 404 Bus. splits into a one-way pair that follows Franklin Street eastbound and Gay Street westbound, with Market Street running between Franklin and Gay streets. The one-way pair, which has two lanes in each direction, carries the route through the residential and commercial downtown of Denton, with the westbound direction passing north of the Caroline County Courthouse. East of the downtown area, the one-way pair intersects MD 619 (Sixth Street). In {{the eastern part of}} Denton, the two directions of MD 404 Bus. turn south and join again, becoming a four-lane divided highway with the Franklin Street name that runs through woodland. [...] MD 404 Bus. ends at MD 313 and MD 404 a short distance later.|$|E
