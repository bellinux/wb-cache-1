5000|$|In the Roman Catholic Church, most {{of those}} born into the faith are baptized as infants.

They are in fact the normal, or at least [...] "best", outer clothing of Western babies until about the 19th century. The moment of progression to shorter dresses (for both boys and girls) was known as [...] "shortcoating", which usually coincided {{with the beginning of}} crawling, which was difficult in a long robe, or at five to six months of age. <b>Christening</b> <b>gowns</b> are usually made of fine white linen or cotton fabric, and may be trimmed with tucks, lace, whitework embroidery, and other handwork. Baptismal gowns often have matching bonnets, and may become family heirlooms, used generation after generation.|$|R

50|$|Although {{it is not}} required, {{many parents}} and godparents choose to dress the baby in a white gown called a <b>christening</b> <b>gown</b> for the baptism ceremony.

Also normally made of white fabric, the outfit consists of a romper with a vest or other accessories.These clothes are often kept as a memento after the ceremony.|$|E

50|$|Victoria {{revisited}} the lace-makers {{to create}} the <b>christening</b> <b>gown</b> worn by her children, including Albert Edward, the future Edward VII.

5000|$|Colleen {{was kidnapped}} by Patty Williams. Upon escaping, {{she fell into}} a lake, and she almost drowned. She {{was rushed to the}} hospital, only to be {{declared}} braindead. Patty shot Victor Newman when he attempted to help save Colleen from the lake, and Colleen's heart was donated to him at Traci's request. Traci's brother, Billy Abbott, organized a celebration of Colleen's life that all of her friends and family attended. All of the mourners present released red balloons to honor Colleen while Beth Maitland's song, [...] "An Angel's Lullaby," [...] played in the background. Traci and Steve stayed in town long enough to be present for the christening of Ashley's [...] "daughter", Faith Colleen Abbott. Faith became Traci's goddaughter, and she wore Colleen's <b>christening</b> <b>gown</b> for the ceremony. Adam Newman (Michael Muhney) became Faith's godfather, but in a turn of events, he schemed to make Ashley believe that Faith was her child. In reality, Nick (Joshua Morrow) and Sharon Newman (Sharon Case) were Faith's biological parents. Adam stole Faith from Sharon at birth, and he passed the baby off as Ashley's baby. In reality, Ashley had a hysterical pregnancy, and she never actually gave birth. This dark point in Ashley's life occurred after Traci and Steve went back to New York City. Traci also returned to visit her family for Christmastime. In 2010, Colleen's best friend, Lily Winters (Christel Khalil), had recently overcome a battle with ovarian cancer. Lily could not bear children, but she and her husband, Cane Ashby, were able to conceive through a surrogate mother, Mackenzie Browning (Clementine Ford). When Lily and Cane's twins were born, Lily asked Traci to be their godmother in honor of Colleen, and Traci happily accepted. In 2011, Cane was shot to death on the steps of a church, and Traci attended his [...] "funeral." [...] In reality, Cane's twin brother, Caleb Atkinson, was killed on the church steps. Lily believed that she was having hallucinations because she was seeing Cane's [...] "ghost." [...] Traci was the only person to sympathize with Lily when everyone else thought that she was insane.|$|E
