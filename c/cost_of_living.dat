5|$|Despite {{the strong}} economy, the Bay Area's housing market and <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>living</b> is {{becoming}} increasingly expensive. As of 2017, the average income {{needed in order to}} purchase a house in the region was $179,390, while the median price for a house was $895,000. Because of the high <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>living,</b> many workers in the Bay Area live far from their place of employment, contributing to one of the highest percentages of extreme commuters in the United States, or commutes that take over ninety minutes in one direction. For example, about 50,000 people commute from neighboring San Joaquin county into the nine-county Bay Area daily.|$|E

40|$|Prices differ across space: from {{province}} to province, {{from rural}} (or urban) areas in one province to rural (or urban) areas in another province, and from rural to urban areas within one province. Systematic differences in prices across {{a range of}} goods and services in different localities imply regional differences in the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>living.</b> If high- income provinces also have high <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>living,</b> and low-income provinces have low <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>living,</b> the use <b>of</b> nominal income measures in explaining such economic outcomes as inequality can lead to misinterpretations.

40|$|The Swedish Consumer Price Index (CPI) is {{supposed}} to measure both inflation and changes in <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>living.</b> Using a single measure is problematic since <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>living</b> may not change at an equal pace for all members of society. Because of their varying patterns of consumption, individuals and households can have higher or lower <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>living</b> than a general CPI indicates. The {{purpose of this study}} is to examine how large these discrepancies are and who is affected by them. This is done by constructing experimental price indices where goods and services are given different weights for different categories of households. These weights are based on household budget surveys, where households are categorised along three dimensions: income, socio-economic group and composition of the household. A supplemental study is performed based on Danish data for comparison, because of limitations in the Swedish material. Indices are constructed for the period 2003 – 2013 for Sweden and 2000 – 2013 for Denmark. The results indicate that small households, households with low incomes and households with higher ages in both Sweden and Denmark have <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>living</b> that are underestimated by official CPI:s. This is primarily due to rents and other housing costs making up a larger share of the budgets for these households, and that these types <b>of</b> <b>costs</b> have risen faster than the average inflation. Furthermore, the experimental price indices are steadily diverging, at least since 2008...|$|R

5|$|Flanders felt that, {{to quell}} inflation, wage {{increases}} should {{be tied to}} productivity increases, rather than the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>living.</b> He recommended splitting gains in productivity three ways: to the worker for higher wages, to the company for higher profits and to the consumer for lower prices.
