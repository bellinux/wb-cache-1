40|$|The {{material}} properties of fibre networks and fibre reinforced composites are {{strongly influenced by}} fibre-fibre interactions. Stress transfer between load bearing elements in such materials is often dictated {{by the nature of}} the fibre-fibre interface. Inter-fibre bonding is solely responsible for internal cohesion in paper, because all stresses transferred between fibres operate through fibre-fibre bonds.. The future development of <b>cellulosic</b> <b>fibre</b> materials will require an improved understanding of the fibre-fibre interface. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) was proposed as a new tool for the study of fibre interfaces. A protocol for covalent linkage of fluorophores to natural and regenerated cellulosic fibres was developed and the absorptive and emissive properties of these dyes were characterized. The fluorescent response of these dyed fibres in paper sheets was studied using steady-state fluorescence spectroscopy. Fluorescence micrographs of fibre crossings on glass slides were analyzed using the FRETN correction algorithm. Energy transfer from coumarin dyed fibres to fluorescein dyed fibres at the interface was observed. The FRETN surfaces for spruce and viscose rayon fibre crossings were distinctly different. The FRET microscopy method was able to detect statistically significant differences in spruce fibre interface development when fibre fraction and wet pressing were varied. The coalescence of natural <b>cellulosic</b> <b>fibre</b> interfaces during drying was also observed with the technique. Polysaccharide films were employed as model systems for the natural and regenerated cellulose fibre interfaces. It was found that pressing cellulose films did not result in significantly increased FRETN either due to resistance to deformation or the inability to participate in interdiffusion. Conversely, xylan films demonstrated a drastic increase in the FRETN signal with increased wet pressing. These results support the previously observed differences between regenerated cellulose fibres and natural wood fibres. The results of the FRETN analysis of the polysaccharide film model systems suggest that lower molecular weight amorphous carbohydrates are likely to be significant contributors to fibre interface development.

40|$|AbstractThe {{behaviour}} {{of different}} <b>cellulosic</b> <b>fibres</b> during acid hydrolysis {{has been investigated}} and the levelling-off degree of polymerisation (LODP) has been determined.

Additionally, cotton cellulose from new cotton sheets and sheets discarded after long-time use was studied. Experimental results from the investigation, together with results found in literature, imply that ultrastructural differences between different fibres affect their susceptibility towards acid hydrolysis. Drying of a bleached kraft pulp was found to enhance the rate of acid hydrolysis and also result in a decrease in LODP. This implies that the susceptibility of <b>cellulosic</b> <b>fibres</b> towards acid hydrolysis is affected by drying-induced stresses in the cellulose chains.

40|$|Natural fibres have {{terminal}} {{groups in}} their polymer structure {{that make them}} appropriate for anchoring other groups with specific functional properties. The most used chemicals so far based on this possibility are reactive dyes for <b>cellulosic</b> <b>fibres</b> discovered {{as far back as}} 1956. Twenty to thirty years on and other products were attached to <b>cellulosic</b> <b>fibres</b> for increasing the yield of reactive dyes or even dyeing with reactive dyes without salt. These were cationic groups that attracted the anionic dyes used. The process didn’t progress much into industrial application, mainly because of colour non-uniformity problems. Based on the experience of these technologies, we can go much further and attach longer chain cationic groups that have anti-bacterial properties. This has also been claimed by at least one company to be happening with their products. However, the application of these and other anti-bacterial products is invariably after dyeing, mainly by padding methods, with the use of resins. In this work we apply novel reactive long chain cationic products to <b>cellulosic</b> <b>fibres</b> by exhaustion method before dyeing, and promote the chemical reaction with the hydroxyl groups on the fibre. The main objective was to prove that the process is viable when applied before dyeing, and that it has benefits since no salt is not used, or used in less quantities, and there is no subsequent fixation of the anti-bacterial product by resins, eventually containing formaldehyde is necessary, making it globally into a much more ecological process...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to investigate the recycling of cotton waste garments by fibre regeneration. Easy care finished cotton fabrics and indigo dyed waste denim garments were successfully purified, dissolved in a suitable solvent and spun into fibres.

Furthermore the results have indicated that a suitable blend of wood pulp and pulp reclaimed form cotton based waste garments can produce fibres with properties that are intermediate to cotton and lyocell fibres. The results suggest an alternative approach to fibre resource management by converting cotton based waste garment through regeneration processing into second lifetime <b>cellulosic</b> <b>fibre.</b> The approach will contribute to the reduction of both economic and environmental impact of waste garments and better management of resources required for production of cotton and synthetic fibres...|$|E
40|$|The surface {{tensions}} {{of several}} natural cellulosic fibres like flax, hemp, kenaf and cotton and a synthetic <b>cellulosic</b> <b>fibre</b> have been determined using the so-called floating test.

By measuring γF in both a polar and an apolar liquid system, the fibre surface tension γS and its dispersive and polar parts, γSd and γSp, respectively, can be calculated using the harmonic mean approximation. The fibre surface tensions found for untreated and extracted natural fibres are in good agreement with literature data for surface tensions of various fibre components such as cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin and waxes. Untreated natural cellulosic fibres proved to be very hydrophobic due to a waxy layer on their surface. Extraction of fatty substances significantly increases the fibre surface tension.

In order to overcome this problem, this research work will provide an appropriate platform to understand and optimize the diffusion coefficient which plays important role in best trichromy selection by converting visual performance tests into data. The dye diffusion extent of reactive dyes into the fibre in pad dyeing using Kubelka-Munk equation is the correct for optimization and judicious dye selection. Dye diffusion index influences the dye fixation, ultimate color yield to color fastness of dyed fibre to digital color values.

A slight increase was observed after the treatment of viscose and modal fibres, but an unpronounced fall of a long period accompanied the pre-treatment of lyocell fibres.

40|$|Abstract — Cotton as a {{dominating}} {{natural fibre}} imparts a major contribution {{in the whole}} textile market including natural and artificial fibres. The demand of this <b>cellulosic</b> <b>fibre</b> is increasing rapidly day by day, {{on the other hand}} supply cannot fulfill its demand, and as a result price goes higher in world market. Viscose as cellulosic origin, the cheapest of all cellulosic fibres could be the best alternative. Viscose fibre exhibits some similar properties compared to cotton except its poor wet strength. In this research work different chemical finishes were applied to improve the wet strength of viscose fabric. For this purpose water repellent and soil release finishes were applied. Both water repellent and soil release finishes helped in reducing the molecular barrier around the individual fibres that lowered the surface tension of the fibre. It reduces the absorbency of viscose fibre hence leads to higher wet strength. Water repellent finish was applied alone as well as in combination with soil release finish.
