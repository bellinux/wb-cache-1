40|$|International audienceIt is {{essential}} for grass livestock farming to cope with climate variability and, particularly, drought. A potential solution is to use collective mountain pastures, which are colder and wetter, in the summer. However, there is little knowledge on such <b>collective</b> <b>pasture</b> management. Therefore, we surveyed three collective sheep summer mountain pastures and three small and one large cattle summer mountain pastures in 2012 in the Auvergne region, France. Farmers using and managing the pastures were interviewed. We also analysed regional statistics, an economic report and a shepherd journal. Our results show that drought has incited farmers to use collective pastures. Beginning and ending dates of the summer grazing season and animal transfers have been modified by collective decisions and individual farmer strategies. We conclude that collective summer mountain pastures is a unique source of flexibility for livestock farming...|$|E
40|$|The Incidence of the Cropping Season on the Breeding of Small Ruminants in a Densily Populated Area : Case of the Western Highlands in Cameroon. Under the {{combined}} effect of {{high population density}} {{and the introduction of}} a second cropping season in the Western Highlands of Cameroon, the agricultural land, including marginal land, is cultivated ail year round. The utilization of <b>collective</b> <b>pastures</b> for the production of staple food and the impossibility for small ruminants farmers to set their animals free for {{at least part of the}} year like in the pass, call for the adoption of a new management strategy for these animals. A production system including the permanent confinement of animals seems inevitable for the survival of this activity. However, the success of this transformation process in the management of small ruminant must be accompanied by an improvement in housing, feeding as well as genetic improvement of the existing animal material...|$|R
50|$|He almost didn’t go to school, {{working on}} a <b>collective</b> farm <b>pasturing</b> colts as a teenager. His passion for {{painting}} appeared in childhood, partly {{under the influence of}} his father. In his youth, Chubarov wanted to have a prestigious profession, so went to his uncle’s house in Zlatoust to study to become an engraver at a vocational school there. After graduating from the school, Chubarov entered the army and served five years in the Baltic Fleet.|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} the endo-parasites of Zerasca sheep, an {{autochthonous}} breed of Tuscany (Italy), were investigated {{for the first}} time. The evaluation of the zootechnical risks linked with these diseases and of the efficacy of control measures used in the examined flock represented other important aims. During a period of 15 months, individual faecal and blood samples were collected monthly from 45 animals. Blood samples were {{used to evaluate the}} Packed Cell Volume (PCV), while on faecal samples parasitological analysis were performed with flotation tests, a modified McMaster method and with sedimentation. Quantitative data of gastrointestinal nematodes (EPG) and coccidian (OPG) were statistically analyzed. Results obtained show the presence in the flock of coccidia, gastrointestinal and lung strongyles, whip-worms, cestodes (Moniezia benedeni) and flukes (Dicrocoelium dendriticum, Fasciola hepatica and Paramphistomidae). All these parasites can be responsible for negative effects on sheep productions. EPG number resulted highly influenced (P< 0. 01) by the date of sampling, while PCV and EPG values showed a negative correlation (P< 0. 01). Significant influence between OPG and data of sampling and age of animals (p< 0. 001) was also found. The use of <b>collective</b> <b>pastures</b> represents the main characteristic of the breeding of Zerasca sheep. Thus, in our opinion the use of common management practices are fundamental for an efficacious control of the endo-parasitic diseases in this autochthonous breed...|$|R
30|$|Ingold (1980) {{distinguished}} between modes of production {{in terms of}} pastoralism, ranching and hunting. We categorize both sheep and reindeer husbandry in Norway as pastoralism, because both sectors have <b>collective</b> access to <b>pastures</b> in the communal rangelands. Conversely, ranching usually refers to grazing on private land. Herding and husbandry are two related but different ways of referring to reindeer herders’ or reindeer owners’ practices. Both terms are applied in this article, depending on the context. Herding refers to moving and tending the reindeer in the pastures, whereas husbandry is a broader term and may include all activities related to reindeer and its products, e.g. yard work, slaughtering and breeding strategies (Berg 2000). The studied herding districts share an east-west migratory herding pattern (Skogseid 1997; Sande 2010), and both intensive and a more extensive herding practice are {{carried out in the}} studied region (Sande 2010). Intensive herding is usually characterized by continuous tending of the herd, which also makes the herd tamer, while extensive herding is characterized by less contact with the herd.|$|R
