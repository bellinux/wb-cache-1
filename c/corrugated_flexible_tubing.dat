40|$|Abstract – In {{conducting}} {{analysis of}} {{systems that have}} failed {{as a result of}} lightning and transients, we have observed repeated incidences associated with <b>corrugated</b> <b>flexible</b> <b>tubing.</b> The nature and frequency of lightning strokes is considered. The failure process is investigated. Standards and articles provide adequate minimum design for installation. Ten areas of electrical systems correlate to lightning impact. These are (1) jacket thickness, (2) wall thickness, (3) cathodic cell, (4) high frequency impedance, (5) wire size, (6) number of grounding connections, (7) bonding, (8) voltage levels, (9) damage at high levels, and (10) electromagnetic waveguide. Actual photos illustrate lightning interaction on a charged metal surface, transfer of energy to a pipe system, exit damage on a pipe, and intense arcing on a grounding electrode conductor...|$|E

30|$|In {{traditional}} lavatory systems, flushwater drives blackwater till {{it passes}} the back zone {{and enters the}} exit pipe. In the study of An et al. (2014), weight of some water from the flushing box is used in tilting down a U-shape trapway. It has a spring located in large <b>corrugated</b> <b>flexible</b> tube that contracts prior to flushing due to the elastic strain energy of the spring to maintain a certain slope. A certain amount of water flows into the <b>corrugated</b> <b>flexible</b> tube once flushing begins. Once {{the mass of the}} inflowing water becomes larger than the elastic energy of the spring, the <b>corrugated</b> <b>flexible</b> tube relaxes to the bottom, making the slope of the trapway horizontal and facilitating the discharge of waste.|$|R

The present study deals with {{the determination of the}} pinch or squeeze force needed to control the flow of a fluid in the <b>flexible</b> <b>tubing</b> arrangement for a particular application. The experimentally determined squeeze force values for a pressure range of 0. 2 to 2 bar with air as the medium of flow was compared with Finite Element Analysis (FEA) results. The minimum percentage error observed was- 0. 23 and maximum was 0. 21 at a pressure of 0. 2 and 1. 6 bar respectively. The silicone tube was connected to FRL unit which supplies air and passed through the channel attached to the Load Cell as shown in Figure 1. The force required to block the flow of fluid in the tube was applied by the rotational motion of a screw that is pinned to the channel...|$|R

50|$|Flexible {{metallic}} conduit (FMC, informally called greenfield or flex) {{is made by}} the helical coiling of a self-interlocked ribbed strip of aluminum or steel, forming a hollow tube through which wires can be pulled.

The <b>flexible</b> <b>tubing</b> does not maintain any permanent bend, and can flex freely.|$|R

50|$|The garment is {{typically}} a close-fitting non-stretching fabric or a tight-fitting elastic fabric, with <b>flexible</b> <b>tubing</b> sewn onto the fabric. A single-layer of fabric may be used, with the tubing {{either on the}} inside directly contacting the wearer's skin, or on the outside separated by the fabric. If two layers of fabric are used, stitched channels can be formed which enclose the tubing between the two fabric layers. Where flame resistance is needed, the garment may be constructed out of materials such as nomex.|$|R

25|$|Tubing and {{connections}} : Various kinds of tubing {{can be used}} to connect the components of the respirometry system to and from the animal chamber. A variety of kinds of <b>flexible</b> <b>tubing</b> may be used, depending on the characteristics of the system. Acetyl, Bev-A-Line, Kynar, nylon, Tygon tubing and connectors may be used in regions of the system where oxidizing atmospheres are low (e.g., background levels of ozone only); Teflon tubing would be recommended if there is an expectation for appreciable amounts of ozone to be present because it is inert to ozone. Teflon tubes are more costly and lack flexibility.|$|R
50|$|Many {{consumer}} grade printers {{are designed}} with close-fitting and sometimes fully enclosing shrouds over the print carriage. It may be difficult or impossible to install a retrofit kit {{because there is no}} room to install the <b>flexible</b> <b>tubing</b> that must flex and bend as the printhead moves back and forth. Jamming may occur if the tubing droops into the path of the printhead and is crushed underneath the printhead or between the printhead and cover. It may be necessary to modify the printer by removing the cover or cutting slots into the body to provide an open space for the tubing.|$|R

30|$|Flow through {{collapsible}} tubes {{has been}} extensively studied in the laboratory. Pioneering work on collapsible tubes, explain that the veins {{play an important role}} in controlling the output of the heart. This control function of the veins is a passive one, and is as a result of their ability to collapse and inflate. Several experimental studies have been done on <b>flexible</b> <b>tubing.</b> For instance Bertram (1986) did an experimental study on collapsible and elastic tubes with finite-length and the upstream and downstream ends held open. He concluded that when the external pressure exceeded the fluid pressure by a sufficiently large amount, the tube buckled non-axi symmetrically, leading to a nonlinear relation between pressure-drop and flow rate.|$|R
5000|$|At first, {{cylinders}} were copied by acoustically connecting a playback {{machine to}} one or more recording machines through <b>flexible</b> <b>tubing,</b> an arrangement that degraded the audio quality of the copies.

During a recording session, as many as a dozen machines could be arrayed in front of the performers to record multiple originals. Still, a single [...] "take" [...] would ultimately yield only a few hundred copies at best, so performers were booked for marathon recording sessions in which they had to repeat their most popular numbers over and over again.

40|$|The pressure-belt {{technique}} {{is commonly used}} to measure pressure distributions on lifting and nonlifting surfaces where flush, through-the-surface measurements are not possible. The belts, made from strips of small-bore, <b>flexible</b> plastic <b>tubing,</b> are surface-mounted by a simple, nondestructive method. Additionally, the belts require minimal installation time, thus making them much less costly to install than flush-mounted pressure ports. Although pressure belts {{have been used in}} flight research since the early 1950 s, only recently have manufacturers begun to produce thinner, more <b>flexible</b> <b>tubing,</b> and thin, strong adhesive tapes that minimize the installation-induced errors on the measurement of surface pressures. The objective of this investigation was {{to determine the effects of}} pressure-belt tubing size on the measurement of pressure distributions. For that purpose, two pressure belts were mounted on the right wing of a single-engine, propeller-driven research airplane. The outboard pressure belt served as a baseline for the measurement and the comparison of effects. Each tube had an outer diameter (OD) of 0. 0625 in. The inboard belt was used to evaluate three different tube sizes: 0. 0625 -, 0. 1250 -, and 0. 1875 -in. OD. A computational investigation of tube size on pressure distribution also was conducted using the two-dimensional Multielement Streamtube Euler Solver (MSES) code...|$|R
