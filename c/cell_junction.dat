Chi-square analysis indicated a random occurrence of endothelial <b>cell</b> <b>junctions</b> under pericytes; however, pericyte processes tended to end near endothelial <b>cell</b> <b>junctions.</b> In the neonatal and mature lungs, 38 and 40 %, respectively, of all endothelial junctions were within 0. 5 microns of {{the margins of}} pericyte processes; such distances covered only 16 and 17 % of the circumferences of the capillary profiles examined.

40|$|Herpes simplex virus (HSV) {{glycoprotein}} heterodimer gE/gI {{is necessary}} for virus spread in epithelial and neuronal tissues. Deletion of the relatively large gE cytoplasmic (CT) domain abrogates the ability of gE/gI to mediate HSV spread. The gE CT domain {{is required for the}} sorting of gE/gI to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) in early stages of virus infection, and there are several recognizable TGN sorting motifs grouped near the center of this domain. Late in HSV infection, gE/gI, other viral glycoproteins, and enveloped virions redistribute from the TGN to epithelial <b>cell</b> <b>junctions,</b> and the gE CT domain is also required for this process. Without the gE CT domain, newly enveloped virions are directed to apical surfaces instead of to <b>cell</b> <b>junctions.</b> We hypothesized that the gE CT domain promotes virus envelopment into TGN subdomains from which nascent enveloped virions are sorted to <b>cell</b> <b>junctions,</b> a process that enhances cell-to-cell spread. To characterize elements of the gE CT domain involved in intracellular trafficking and cell-to-cell spread, we constructed a panel of truncation mutants. Specifically, these mutants were used to address whether sorting to the TGN and redistribution to <b>cell</b> <b>junctions</b> are necessary, and sufficient, for gE/gI to promote cell-to-cell spread. gE- 519, lacking 32 C-terminal residues, localized normally to the TGN early in infection and then trafficked to <b>cell</b> <b>junctions</b> at late times and mediated virus spread. By contrast, mutants gE- 495 (lacking 56 C-terminal residues) and gE- 470 (lacking 81 residues) accumulated in the TGN but did not traffic to <b>cell</b> <b>junctions</b> and did not mediate cell-to-cell spread. A fourth mutant, gE- 448 (lacking most of the CT domain), did not localize to <b>cell</b> <b>junctions</b> and did not mediate virus spread. Therefore, the capacity of gE/gI to promote cell-cell spread requires early localization to the TGN, but this is not sufficient for virus spread. Additionally, gE CT sequences between residues 495 and 519, which contain no obvious cell sorting motifs, are required to promote gE/gI traffic to <b>cell</b> <b>junctions</b> and cell-to-cell spread...|$|R
50|$|Stable cell-cell {{interactions}} {{are required for}} cell adhesion within a tissue and controlling the shape and function of cells.

40|$|The {{herpes simplex}} virus (HSV) {{glycoprotein}} heterodimer gE/gI {{plays an important role}} in virus cell-to-cell spread in epithelial and neuronal tissues. In an analogous fashion, gE/gI promotes virus spread between certain cell types in culture, e. g., keratinocytes and epithelial cells, cells that are polarized or that form extensive <b>cell</b> <b>junctions.</b> One mechanism by which gE/gI facilitates cell-to-cell spread involves selective sorting of nascent virions to <b>cell</b> <b>junctions,</b> a process that requires the cytoplasmic domain of gE. However, the large extracellular domains of gE/gI also appear to be involved in cell-to-cell spread. Here, we show that coexpression of a truncated form of gE and gI in a human keratinocyte line, HaCaT cells, decreased the spread of HSV between cells. This truncated gE/gI was found extensively at <b>cell</b> <b>junctions.</b> Expression of wild-type gE/gI that accumulates at intracellular sites, in the trans-Golgi network, did not reduce cell-to-cell spread. There was no obvious reduction in production of infectious HSV in cells expressing gE/gI, and virus particles accumulated at <b>cell</b> <b>junctions,</b> not at intracellular sites. Expression of HSV gD, which is known to bind virus receptors, also blocked cell-to-cell spread. Therefore, like gD, gE/gI appears to be able to interact with cellular components of <b>cell</b> <b>junctions,</b> gE/gI receptors which can promote HSV cell-to-cell spread...|$|R

30|$|Maintenance of <b>cell</b> <b>junctions</b> plays {{a crucial}} role in the regulation of {{cellular}} functions including cell proliferation, permeability, and cell death. Disruption of <b>cell</b> <b>junctions</b> is implicated in a variety of human disorders, such as inflammatory diseases and cancers. Understanding molecular regulation of <b>cell</b> <b>junctions</b> is important for development of therapeutic strategies for intervention of human diseases. Ubiquitination is an important type of post-translational modification that primarily regulates endogenous protein stability, receptor internalization, enzyme activity, and protein-protein interactions. Ubiquitination is tightly regulated by ubiquitin E 3 ligases and can be reversed by deubiquitinating enzymes. Recent studies have been focusing on investigating the effect of protein stability in the regulation of cell-cell junctions. Ubiquitination and degradation of cadherins, claudins, and their interacting proteins are implicated in epithelial and endothelial barrier disruption. Recent studies have revealed that ubiquitination is involved in regulation of Rho GTPases’ biological activities. Taken together these studies, ubiquitination plays a critical role in modulating <b>cell</b> <b>junctions</b> and motility. In this review, we will discuss the effects of ubiquitination and deubiquitination on protein stability and expression of key proteins in the cell-cell junctions, including junction proteins, their interacting proteins, and small Rho GTPases. We provide an overview of protein stability in modulation of epithelial and endothelial barrier integrity and introduce potential future search directions to better understand the effects of ubiquitination on human disorders caused by dysfunction of <b>cell</b> <b>junctions.</b>|$|R
40|$|Aims A {{fundamental}} {{phenomenon in}} inflammation {{is the loss}} of endothelial barrier function, in which the opening of endothelial <b>cell</b> <b>junctions</b> plays a central role. However, the molecular mechanisms that ultimately open the <b>cell</b> <b>junctions</b> are largely unknown. Methods and results Impedance spectroscopy, biochemistry, and morphology were used to investigate the role of caveolin- 1 in the regulation of thrombin-induced opening of <b>cell</b> <b>junctions</b> in cultured human and mouse endothelial cells. Here, we demonstrate that the vascular endothelial (VE) cadherin/catenin complex targets caveolin- 1 to endothelial <b>cell</b> <b>junctions.</b> Association of caveolin- 1 with VE-cadherin/catenin complexes is essential for the barrier function decrease in response to the pro-inflammatory mediator thrombin, which causes a reorganization of the complex in a rope ladder-like pattern accompanied by a loss of junction-associated actin filaments. Mechanistically, we show that in response to thrombin stimulation the protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR- 1) causes phosphorylation of caveolin- 1, which increasingly associates with β- and γ-catenin. Consequently, the association of β- and γ-catenin with VE-cadherin is weakened, thus allowing junction reorganization and a decrease in barrier function. Thrombin-induced opening of <b>cell</b> <b>junctions</b> is lost in caveolin- 1 -knockout endothelial cells and after expression of a Y/F-caveolin- 1 mutant but is completely reconstituted after expression of wild-type caveolin- 1. Conclusion Our results highlight the pivotal role of caveolin- 1 in VE-cadherin-mediated cell adhesion via catenins and, in turn, in barrier function regulatio...|$|R

TCJ provide mechanical and geometrical clues for the spindle apparatus to ensure that cell divide along its long axis.

40|$|E-cadherin is a trans-membrane tumor {{suppressor}} {{responsible for}} epithelial cell adhesion. E-cadherin forms adhesive clusters through combined extra-cellular cis- and trans-interactions and intracellular {{interaction with the}} actin cytoskeleton. Here we identify four populations of E-cadherin within <b>cell</b> <b>junctions</b> based on the molecular interactions which determine their mobility and adhesive properties. Adhesive and non-adhesive populations of E-cadherin each consist of mobile and immobile fractions. Up to half of the E-cadherin immobilized in <b>cell</b> <b>junctions</b> is non-adhesive. Incorporation of E-cadherin into functional adhesions require all three adhesive interactions, with deletion of any one resulting in loss of effective cell-cell adhesion. Interestingly, the only interaction which could independently slow the diffusion of E-cadherin was the tail-mediated intra-cellular interaction. The adhesive and non-adhesive mobile fractions of E-cadherin can be distinguished by their sensitivity to chemical cross-linking with adhesive clusters.

The open-circuit voltage of PV module Voc is then measured using a short pulse of solar irradiation provided by a solar simulator. Repeating the measurements at different environment temperature (40 - 80 °C) and solar irradiation S (200 - 1000 W/m 2), the correlation between the open-circuit voltage Voc, the junction temperature Tj, and solar irradiation S is derived.

40|$|Although it {{is known}} that {{disruption}} of the cell junctions in the mammary gland induces a decrease in milk yield, the cellular mechanisms involved in milk secretion reduction during mammary <b>cell</b> <b>junction</b> disruption are not well understood. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the cellular regulations taking place after <b>cell</b> <b>junction</b> disruption in the mammary gland of goats. We performed intramammary infusions of Ca chelators to induce <b>cell</b> <b>junction</b> disruption. In a first group of 5 goats, intramammary infusions of ethylene glycol-bis(2 -aminoethylether) -N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) in the right gland halves and saline as a control in the left gland halves were performed after 4 consecutive milkings. A second group of 4 goats received 4 intramammary infusions of citrate solution in the right gland halves and lactose solution as a control in the left halves. Intramammary infusion of EGTA and lactose induced a disruption of cell junctions, whereas citrate infusions failed to modify mammary epithelium integrity. The effect of the infused solutions was also tested in vitro via the measurement of transepithelial resistance, confirming mammary epithelium disruption by the EGTA, lactose, and citrate solutions at high concentrations. The disruption of mammary epithelium integrity by EGTA induced a decrease in the expression of the <b>cell</b> <b>junction</b> protein E-cadherin. Both the EGTA and lactose infusions induced a decrease in milk secretion that was accompanied by cellular modifications. We observed a decrease in milk casein, which was associated with a decrease in the mRNA level of kappa-casein in the lactose-infused glands, and a decrease in milk lactose, which was associated with a downregulation of alpha-lactalbumin transcripts in both the EGTA- and lactose-treated glands. Both the EGTA and lactose infusions increased terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated 2 '-deoxyuridine 5 '-triphosphate nick-end labeling (TUNEL) in the mammary tissue, indicating an induction of apoptosis. Lactose infusion increased the mRNA level of Bax, suggesting that apoptosis was regulated at the transcriptional level.
