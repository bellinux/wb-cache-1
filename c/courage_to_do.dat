5|$|School Rumble is {{a romantic}} shōnen comedy {{revolving}} around {{the daily lives}} of the students of Class 2-C at the fictional Yagami High School, along with their friends and families. The main female protagonist is Tenma Tsukamoto, an unremarkable second-year high school student who secretly admires her eccentric, enigmatic, nice-guy classmate, Oji Karasuma. Tenma struggles to confess her feelings to Karasuma. He remains oblivious to her interest, instead seeking fulfillment by indulging in curry. The main male protagonist, delinquent Kenji Harima, similarly yearns for Tenma, attending school solely to be near her. Like Tenma, Harima has difficulty declaring his love, and whenever he summons the <b>courage</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, circumstances conspire against him.|$|E

The actress has commented that this [...] "tore [...] to pieces", and [...] "I can't begin to tell you how much I regret his not being around". She added, [...] "At the same time, it's possible that were he still alive I might never have had the space or <b>courage</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> what I've done ...

But the thing is not the less certain--the proofs are lying in the strong chest of our house at London, deposited there by the old Earl, who repented of his roguery to Miss Martigny long before he died, but had not <b>courage</b> enough <b>to</b> <b>do</b> his legitimate son justice till the sexton had housed him." ...|$|R

It is time, and more than time, that you should decide whether it is good for you to see Romayne again. Have you <b>courage</b> enough <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that?" ...|$|R
500|$|He was {{subsequently}} promoted to captain and, on August 23, 1945, awarded the Medal of Honor. Although {{still recovering from}} his wounds, for which {{he would continue to}} receive treatment until mid-1946, he attended a ceremony at the White House where President Harry S. Truman formally presented him with the medal. In addition to the Medal of Honor, Daly received three Silver Stars, a Bronze Star with [...] "V" [...] device, and two Purple Hearts. [...] Commenting on his Medal of Honor citation in a speech at Fairfield High School sometime later, Daly said, [...] "We all lose our courage at times. It is something we pray for in the morning, that God will give us the strength and <b>courage</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> what is right." ...|$|E
500|$|Canadian Broadcasting Corporation News Online {{columnist}} Heather Mallick wrote, [...] "Colbert had the wit and raw <b>courage</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> to Bush what Mark Antony did to Brutus, murderer of Caesar. As the American {{media has}} self-destructed, it takes Colbert to damn Bush with devastatingly ironic praise." [...] Comedian and eventual Democratic U.S. Senator Al Franken, who performed at similar dinners twice during the Bill Clinton administration, admired what Colbert had done. In its year-end issue, New York magazine described Colbert's performance {{as one of}} the most [...] "brilliant" [...] moments of 2006. Time's James Poniewozik noted that in the [...] "days after Stephen Colbert performed at the White House Correspondents' Dinner, this has become the political-cultural touchstone issue of 2006—like whether you drive a hybrid or use the term 'freedom fries.|$|E
500|$|... "Taboo" [...] is an R {{song that}} borrows {{influences}} from numerous genres including hip-hop, Japanese pop, and dance-pop. Tetsuo Hiraga from Hot Express noted elements of 80s pop and disco music. Koda's vocals are heavily processed through vocoder pyrotechnics, and are delivered during the chorus {{and parts of}} the bridge section. The lyrics to [...] "Taboo" [...] emphasize the term with the same name, discussing taboo nature and exploring it. Regarding homosexuality, Koda commented to Oricon; [...] "Instead of trying stuff out and experiencing it, we put up a 'No' sign, we never try to break the taboos" [...] and [...] "Sometimes we shouldn't retreat into safety, we should have <b>courage</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> things. Those are the feelings kin the song." [...] In terms of musical depth and lyrical diversity, Koda found that [...] "Taboo" [...] was one of her most [...] "widen" [...] tracks throughout her entire music career.|$|E

"You have {{at least}} done what, I fear, few of your countrywomen would have the moral <b>courage</b> and self-denial <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> and {{especially}} those who are accustomed to living abroad--refused to be the wife of an English baronet of a good estate and respectable family." ...|$|R
5000|$|Denying {{that the}} film {{should be seen as}} a testament, Resnais said at a press conference in Cannes, [...] "This film is unlike any other. If I'd thought of this film as a final statement, I'd never have had the <b>courage</b> or energy <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it." ...|$|R
6000|$|As for his deep-laid plans {{they were}} all {{scattered}} to the winds. In the presumption of ignorance he had fancied that he knew his own power, and so in one sense he did, {{but he was not}} aware of his own want of power. He knew, indeed, that he had the brute <b>courage</b> <b>to</b> dare and <b>do</b> anything desperate or dastardly, but he did not know that he lacked the moral <b>courage</b> <b>to</b> bear the consequences of his deeds. The insurance policies, therefore, lay unclaimed--even uncared for! ...|$|R
500|$|In an interview, Lee told MTV News {{that she}} pushed her own limits, doing things she didn't have the <b>courage</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{in the making of}} Fallen. She told The Sun the main themes of The Open Door are freedom and her {{personal}} life. The lyrics delve on [...] "what was going on at the time" [...] in her life and about [...] "the experimenting and fun stuff" [...] the band tried on The Open Door. Lee described the songs on the album as [...] "very dark", and said they show how to pass the tough moments in life. When comparing the songs with the material from the group's previous album Fallen, she described them as [...] " [...] very different. The chords are still there but it's just a more mature version." [...] She also said her goal was to make a record that she loved even more than Fallen, rather than to copy the formula which made the previous record successful. Incorporating classical influences and several new elements in the music, [...] the sound of the record was inspired by the works of Portishead and Björk.|$|E
500|$|Meyer {{has been}} {{particularly}} well received by female Holby City fans, elevating Irving to sex-symbol status. The Dail Mail Lynda Lee-Potter described him as [...] "devastatingly attractive, brusque and autocratic" [...] and [...] "the kind of domineering, unsmiling hero who made Mills & Boon heroines swoon." [...] Irving {{felt that this was}} [...] "fairly predictable in terms of the nature of Meyer–tough and masterful–combined with the aphrodisiac of power, and the life and death aspects of his job." [...] He commented that he was surprised by the positive reaction to his character, explaining: [...] "He seems to have captured people's imaginations, but it's difficult to put your finger on what he has. I think it's got something to do with being a character who says exactly what he means all the time. He's got integrity, which I admire anyway, and I expect the audience responds to that. Surgeons seem to like him too. I find that particularly gratifying. He's got the <b>courage</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> what's right for his work and his patients and not worry about popularity or being liked." [...] Conversely, Irving noted that after assuming the role, members of the public would sometimes [...] "give a kind of shudder" [...] upon encountering him, associating him with his character.|$|E
500|$|Koda {{has even}} {{explored}} {{the themes of}} sexuality and taboos in her lyrics. While listening {{to the music of}} [...] "But", the first thing that came to Koda's mind was homosexuality. Regarding the theme of homosexuality, Koda said in an interview: [...] "I'm {{the type of person who}} thinks that [...] it doesn't matter what sex the other person is. No matter who they are, it doesn't change the 'I love this person' feeling, does it?" [...] The video for [...] "Taboo" [...] portrayed homosexuality and other [...] "taboo" [...] subjects to deliver Koda's message of [...] "there really is no such thing as a taboo". [...] She also said of [...] "Taboo"'s themes, [...] "Instead of trying stuff out and experiencing it, we put up a 'No' sign, we never try to break the taboos" [...] and [...] "Sometimes we shouldn't retreat into safety, we should have <b>courage</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> things. Those are the feelings kin the song." [...] Such themes are also present in her music videos: she has incorporated her [...] "sexy" [...] image into her videos since [...] "Crazy 4 U" [...] through sexually charged dances and skin-baring outfits. The video of [...] "Ima Sugu Hoshii" [...] featured two males in sexual positions, and the video of [...] "Juicy", which also featured sexual posturing, was censored in Taiwan.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes--and you'd fancy {{also that}} she could do nothing better than shut herself up and cry for you, or else burn herself. But she would think differently. She'd {{probably}} wear one of those horrid she-helmets, because she'd want the <b>courage</b> not <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so; but she'd wear it with a heart longing for the time when she might be allowed to throw it off. I hate such shallow false pretences. For my part I would let the world say what it pleased, and show no grief if I felt none--and perhaps not, if I did." ...|$|R
5000|$|Gouldman {{cited the}} Beatles as his influence, [...] "We {{went down to}} Denmark Street and went round all the {{publishers}} {{trying to find a}} song ... we didn't get any songs that we liked or we weren't given any songs period and the Beatles had started and I thought 'well, I’m gonna really have a crack at song-writing.' I had dabbled a bit, but they were really my inspiration and gave me and I think {{a lot of other people}} the <b>courage</b> <b>to</b> actually <b>do</b> it. We all wanted to be like the Beatles. I wrote two songs and the record company we were with turned down one of the songs. The song they turned down was 'For Your Love', which eventually found its way to the Yardbirds." ...|$|R
60|$|Imagine such a {{train at}} your own heels, Darsie, and ask {{yourself}} whether you would not exert your legs {{as fast as you}} did in flying from the Solway tide. And yet you impeach my father's courage. I tell you he has <b>courage</b> enough <b>to</b> <b>do</b> what is right, and to spurn what is wrong--courage enough to defend a righteous cause with hand and purse, and to take the part of the poor man against his oppressor, without fear of the consequences to himself. This is civil courage, Darsie; and it is of little consequence to most men in this age and country whether they ever possess military courage or no.|$|R
2500|$|Probably {{a hundred}} men in Congress {{would have liked}} to do what she did. [...] Not one of them had the <b>courage</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it. [...] The Gazette entirely disagrees with the wisdom of her position. [...] But Lord, it was a brave thing! [...] And its bravery someway {{discounted}} its folly. [...] When, in a hundred years from now, courage, sheer courage based upon moral indignation is celebrated in this country, the name of Jeannette Rankin, who stood firm in folly for her faith, will be written in monumental bronze, not for what she did, but for the way she did it.|$|E
2500|$|Convergence Theory - {{whereas the}} Contagion Theory states that crowds {{cause people to}} act in a certain way, Convergence theory states that people who want to act in [...] a certain way come {{together}} to form crowds. Developed by Floyd Allport (1924) and later expanded upon by Neil Miller and John Dollard (1941) as [...] "Learning Theory," [...] the central argument of all convergence theories is that collective behavior reveals the otherwise hidden tendencies of the individuals who take part in the episode. It asserts that people with similar attributes find other like-minded persons with whom they can release these underlying tendencies. People sometimes do things in a crowd that they would not have the <b>courage</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> alone because crowds can diffuse responsibility but the behavior itself is claimed to originate within the individuals. Crowds, in addition, can intensify a sentiment simply by creating a critical mass of like-minded people.|$|E
2500|$|In August 2015, Eno {{endorsed}} Jeremy Corbyn's {{campaign in}} the Labour Party leadership election. He said: [...] "I don't think electability really {{is the most important}} thing. What's important is that someone changes the conversation and moves us off this small-minded agenda." [...] He wrote in The Guardian: [...] "By gathering this level of support Jeremy Corbyn has already shown that there is a strong nascent progressive movement in this country. He's shown the others in his party that there's a well of commitment for them to tap, if they have the will and the <b>courage</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it. If nothing further happens with his campaign, that would be an undeniable and valuable contribution. I admit it: PM Corbyn is a long shot right now – but only four weeks ago bookies were giving 100-1 against him even becoming the candidate. Now it's 7-4 on. Things can change, and quickly. I think we should have some faith and give it a try." ...|$|E
60|$|Unless he went away, the Comforter {{would not}} come. Now the true and exact {{meaning of the}} Comforter is the Strengthener, the Encourager-- one who gives a man {{strength}} of mind, and <b>courage</b> of spirit, <b>to</b> <b>do</b> his work. Without that Comforter, the apostles would be weak and spiritless. Without being encouraged and inspirited by him, they would never get through the work which they had <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> of preaching the Gospel to the whole world.|$|R
5000|$|Bio: Elizabeth Fry (1740-1845) {{is remembered}} for her {{pioneering}} work in prison reform in Britain. She {{was chosen by}} the students in 1927 [...] "because of the great work she did among the poor and unfortunate and in the prisons...

6000|$|The {{scene in}} the House had all the air of tragedy, and Mr. Gladstone summoned <b>courage</b> enough <b>to</b> <b>do</b> his part with {{impressive}} composure. A colleague was doing some business {{with him in his}} room before the solemnity began. When it was over, they resumed it, Mr. Gladstone making no word of reference to the sombre interlude, before or after. “Went reluctantly to the House,” he says in his diary, “and by the help of God forced out what was needful {{on the question of the}} adjournment.” His words were not many, when after commemorating the marked qualities of Mr. Burke, he went on in laboured tones and slow speech and hardly repressed emotion:— ...|$|R
6000|$|Nor {{had either}} of them the <b>courage</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so now. [...] "Yes," [...] said Frank, blushing, [...] "I am going to Lady Scatcherd's. Shall I find the ladies at home?" ...|$|E

5000|$|When I hear nutcases like Glenn Gould who do: staccato {{version of}} J.S. Bach's, I say he {{understood}} nothing of Bach's music! I've listened carefully to his records: he didn't understand. He was very brilliant; I respect {{him up to}} a certain point. For me, the fact that an artist doesn't appear in public poses a problem. But at least he was a guy with the <b>courage</b> not <b>to</b> <b>do</b> things like other people. All the same, he was wide off the mark, so wide off the mark that you'd need a 747 to bring him back. I'm hard on Glenn Gould. Well, he's dead now, so I won't attack a colleague.|$|R
2500|$|Her plan fails: {{rather than}} rushing back in remorse {{to see the}} [...] "dead" [...] Cleopatra, Antony decides that his own life is no longer worth living. He begs one of his aides, Eros, to run him through with a sword, but Eros cannot bear <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it and kills himself. Antony admires Eros' <b>courage</b> and {{attempts}} <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the same, but only succeeds in wounding himself. In great pain, he learns that Cleopatra is indeed alive. He is hoisted up to her in her monument and dies in her arms.|$|R
5000|$|... "I Feed You My Love" [...] is an {{electronic}} and electropop song written in B minor {{and set in}} common time. The song has a sparse arrangement over lush strings and starts with a dark electroclash riff that contrasts with Berger’s delicate vocals. The introduction of drums halfway through the first verse and synthesized strings during the chorus help provide build. According to lyricist Karin Park, the song is [...] "about having the <b>courage</b> and strength <b>to</b> <b>do</b> what you want".|$|R
