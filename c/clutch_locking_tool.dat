40|$|Abstract: A simple {{model for}} driver and vehicle in {{longitudinal}} motion is developed and simulated. The {{focus is on}} describing and handling simulation of <b>clutch</b> <b>lock</b> and <b>clutch</b> release which changes the model structure, both during start and gear shifts, in Simulink. Special attention is given the problem of simulating start and stop of a vehicle with rolling resistance at zero speed. Only principles for simulating the system with variable structure is of interest and therefore the models are maintained at lowest possible complexity. The system is successfully simulated and the validation is performed using three scenarios: one with only <b>clutch</b> <b>lock</b> and <b>clutch</b> release, one with start and stop of vehicle, and one full European drive-cycle...|$|R

50|$|Engine Gear tops were {{introduced}} with the G-series, and retain the same major {{design of a}} typical Beyblade, including a Bit Piece, an Attack Ring, a Weight Disk, and a Blade Base; Engine Gear tops, however, replace the typical Spin Gear with a more advanced Engine Gear, which affects {{the movement of the}} top during the battle. Each Engine Gear includes a Turbo Winder to wind-up the engine core. When in action, the Blade Base releases the Engine Gear determined by the Blade Base's <b>clutch</b> <b>lock</b> system. This series of Beyblades were the last ones to be made of plastic parts {{with the exception of the}} weight disks. The later ones were semi-metal or completely metal.|$|R
5000|$|In {{some top}} loaders, the motor runs only in one direction. During agitation, the {{transmission}} converts the rotation into the alternating motion driving the agitator. During the spin cycle, the timer {{turns on a}} solenoid which engages a <b>clutch</b> <b>locking</b> the motor's rotation to the wash basket, providing a spin cycle. General Electric's very popular line of Filter-Flo (seen to the right) used a variant of this design where the motor reversed only to pump {{water out of the}} machine.

50|$|The {{camshaft}} {{drive belt}} also required changing at the recommended intervals, {{which was a}} pretty involved job, not least because of poor access in the under-floor engined LT vans, {{and the necessity of}} special (and expensive) <b>locking</b> <b>tools</b> to carry out the replacement, which have always been scarce and are becoming increasingly difficult to obtain.|$|R
50|$|Wrap-spring clutches: These have a helical spring, {{typically}} wound with square-cross-section wire. These {{were developed}} in the late 19th and early 20th century. In simple form the spring is fastened at {{one end to the}} driven member; its other end is unattached. The spring fits closely around a cylindrical driving member. If the driving member rotates in the direction that would unwind the spring the spring expands minutely and slips although with some drag. Because of this, spring clutches must typically be lubricated with light oil. Rotating the driving member the other way makes the spring wrap itself tightly around the driving surface and the <b>clutch</b> <b>locks</b> up very quickly. The torque required to make a spring clutch slip grows exponentially with the number of turns in the spring, obeying the capstan equation.|$|R

40|$|Engineering Development is {{one stage}} from the huge {{development}} method called Systems Engineering. In this Thesis, Engineering Development is studied and applied for two Case studies. The main {{emphasis is on}} the Requirements Management, Design and Testing. Two Remote Handling (RH) capable tools are developed in the case studies: Water Hydraulic Jack (WHJ) and Wrench-Pin Tool (WPT). WHJ is developed from the first prototype and WPT is developed from a concept level. The tools are used remotely for Gradel Cassette locking and unlocking processes by a robot called Water Hydraulic MANipulator (WHMAN) at Divertor Test Platform 2 (DTP 2). The Gradel Cassette is a full scale Mock-Up from a Divertor Cassette that will be used in the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER). The RH specific Requirements are developed by gathering Operator Feedback (OF), performing Potential Problem Analysis (PPA) and Task Description (TD) for the locking process. The Divertor Cassette <b>Locking</b> <b>Tools</b> are designed according to these RH specific requirements. After the design process, the tools are tested in a full scale test environment and the RH requirements are verified. The development and testing procedure that is performed for the RH tools may be used as a guideline for forthcoming new generation Divertor Cassette <b>Locking</b> <b>Tools...</b>|$|R

30|$|This paper {{presents}} a differential coupling wheelset (DCW) {{to solve the}} problems of poor curving performance for the conventional wheelset in the sharp curve and bad steering capability for the IRW in the large radius curve and tangent line. In the DCW, both sides of IRWs are coupled by a clutch-type limited slip differential. In the tangent track, the <b>clutch</b> <b>locks</b> the differential, which does not permit a difference in rotation motion of the two wheels, and thus the DCW’s dynamic behavior {{is similar to that of}} a traditional wheelset. In curves with small radius, the clutch will unlock the differential, and the DCW’s dynamic performance is similar to that of a IRW; which can dramatically eliminate the sliding friction between wheel and rail, and reduce the wheel/rail wear and noise in sharp curves. Furthermore, due to the differential, the total rotation speed of two wheels keeps constant. Once the rotation speed of one wheel increases, another wheel decreases at the same time. This difference of rotation speed between two wheels generates a yaw motion for the DCW to negotiate the curves in the radial position to improve the curving performance of urban railway vehicles.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, a novel {{electric}} vehicle powertrain system is proposed.

The configuration, power flow paths and operation modes are depicted in detail. A dynamic model is established to help determine the parameters and build simulation models. The simple control strategy is adopted to achieve flexible power-splits. How to determine the relevant parameters to meet the drive requirements in the powertrain system is also elaborated. A dynamic simulation using MATLAB/Simulink is performed {{to take into account the}} control strategy and New European Drive Cycle. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate, in theory, the rationality of the determined parameters and the feasibility of the operation modes as well as the control strategy...|$|R

40|$|The {{kinematics}} {{model is}} developed by combining {{all of the}} masses and gears in the system. All shafts are assumed infinitely stiff. The kinematics of the Dual-Mode EVT (DMEVT) are illustrated in Figure 1. The dynamics and modeling of a DMEVT are thoroughly developed and discussed in [1]. The term dual-mode refers to the use, in operation, of two clutch configurations, or modes, in the transmission. When the transmission is combined {{with the rest of}} the powertrain and vehicle, the resulting system can be represented using lever diagrams [2] as in Figure 2. Since the clutches are no slip, or dog clutches, the <b>clutches</b> are <b>locked</b> or open. The clutches never pass torque while slipping. Hence, the clutches in the transmission allow for four possible discrete states for this system. For modeling simplification, the transient mode with both clutches open is ignored by the highlevel control. The mode with both <b>clutches</b> closed <b>locks</b> the transmission; therefore this combination is not used. This leaves two modes. In each of these modes, the transmission has two degrees of freedom which permit the engine speed, ω e, and vehicle speed, v veh, to behave independently. In other words, for any given vehicle speed, the engine speed can take any feasible value. The model of the kinematics uses two matrices, Kkine, Δ an...|$|R
