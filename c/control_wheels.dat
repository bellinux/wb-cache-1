25|$|Moreover, the {{new system}} was {{dramatically}} simpler to use. After locating the target in the sighting system, the bombardier simply made fine adjustments using two <b>control</b> <b>wheels</b> throughout the bomb run. There {{was no need for}} external calculation, lookup tables or pre-run measurements - everything was carried out automatically through an internal wheel-and-disc calculator. The calculator took a short time to settle on a solution, with setups as short as 6 seconds, compared to the 50 needed for the Mk. XI to measure its ground speed. In general, the bomb run needed to be only 30 seconds long.|$|E
2500|$|Establishing a {{workshop}} at McCook Field in Dayton, Ohio and working almost entirely without models or wind tunnels for testing, de Bothezat's helicopter {{was completed in}} December 1922. Featuring four six-bladed rotors {{at the end of}} massive, bridge-like girders braced with piano wire, the craft had two vertical propellers – [...] "steering airscrews" [...] – [...] for lateral control, and two additional three-bladed propellers mounted horizontally above the Le Rhône engine to provide airflow for cooling. The girders were angled such that the rotors tilted in towards the craft's center at an angle of five degrees, enhancing stability. The aircraft had two <b>control</b> <b>wheels,</b> a control stick, and foot pedals for control, with each rotor featuring variable-pitch blades for individual collective control.|$|E

2500|$|Structurally the FJ Cruiser {{incorporates}} a body on frame truck style design similar but not {{identical to that}} of the Prado platform. The FJ Cruiser uses a high-mounted, double wishbone front suspension and stabilizer bar, and a 4-link rear suspension with lateral rod with coil springs and stabilizer bar. The 120-series Land Cruiser Prado, Tacoma, 4Runner, and Hilux share the same suspension parts as the FJ Cruiser. The FJ Cruiser uses power-assisted four-piston front and two-piston rear ventilated disc brakes with an anti-lock braking system (ABS), electronic brakeforce distribution (EBD), brake assist (BA) and is also equipped with vehicle stability control (VSC) and a specialized traction control system known as [...] "A-TRAC". The A-TRAC system applies braking to <b>control</b> <b>wheels</b> that have lost traction, mimicking the performance of a locking differential without the [...] "binding" [...] that can make steering difficult in normal locking differential setups.|$|E
50|$|Primary {{flight control}} is {{achieved}} by use of dual <b>control</b> <b>wheels</b> and rudder pedals. The <b>control</b> <b>wheels</b> operate the elevator and ailerons mechanically through a system of cables, pulleys, push-pull tubes and bell cranks. Trim functions, microphone keying, autopilot override and steering system switches {{are located in the}} <b>control</b> <b>wheels.</b> The rudder pedals mechanically operate the rudder for directional yaw control. Nose wheel steering is electrically controlled via the rudder pedals.|$|E

Several methods were outlined for use at different altitudes and operational conditions.|$|E

50|$|Open-View - This {{referred}} to {{the removal of the}} top section of the <b>control</b> <b>wheel</b> in 1967 models. These had been rectangular, they now became “ram’s horn” shaped, thus not blocking the instrument panel as much.|$|R

50|$|On {{a vehicle}} with {{longitudinal}} leaf springs, {{such as a}} Hotchkiss drive suspension, the springs themselves provide some longitudinal <b>wheel</b> <b>control.</b> One or more torque arms may be added to provide supplementary <b>wheel</b> <b>control,</b> particularly for vehicles with strong torque such as drag racers. On some leaf spring-equipped vehicles, such as 1960s Chrysler Corporation cars, the springs are mounted so that a lesser portion of the spring's length is forward of the <b>wheels,</b> improving <b>wheel</b> <b>control</b> on acceleration. A side effect of such positioning is that the longer, aft portion of the springs may not be stiff enough to <b>control</b> <b>wheel</b> movement under braking forces, {{which can lead to}} pronounced wheel hop in hard stops.|$|R
5000|$|Originally, the AJF series (aka: [...] "Jazz King") {{used the}} [...] "Chief-style" [...] bolt-on neck construction, but Tacoma {{changed to a}} more {{traditional}} glued mortise and tenon neck joint. AJF's had a conventional ebony bridge with a composite tailpiece and pickguard/finger rest. EMG, Inc. designed a passive humbucking pickup for the AJF's. Volume and tone <b>control</b> <b>wheels</b> were cleverly hidden on the lower edge of the pickguard/finger rest.|$|E
50|$|The T-Bird is {{constructed}} from 6061-T6 aluminium tubing, bolted together, with the wing and tail surfaces covered in pre-sewn Mylar-coated Dacron envelopes. The cockpit area has a Lexan windshield and optional zippered cloth doors. The basic versions have conventional landing gear, with some models offering tricycle gear as an option. The cockpit controls consist of conventional rudder pedals and yoke <b>control</b> <b>wheels.</b> Construction {{time for the}} T-Bird I was reported as 60 hours.|$|E
50|$|A {{problem was}} caused by {{sideways}} displacement of the chain. At bends in the river there was a tendency for the chain, that was laid in a curve, to increasingly pull itself straight and so move towards {{the inside of the}} bend. In order to prevent this, chain boats were fitted, fore and aft, with large, powerful rudders. These rudders sometimes had a length of over four metres and were worked with the aid of <b>control</b> <b>wheels</b> on the deck.|$|E
50|$|Early {{submarines}} had separate {{controls for}} {{each pair of}} planes, bow and stern. Together with the helmsman, this required three ratings in the already-crowded control room. By the 1960s, combined controls were introduced. These incorporated all planes onto a single aircraft-style <b>control</b> <b>wheel.</b>|$|R
50|$|The iDrive {{operating}} system for secondary car controls receives user input from a conventional <b>control</b> <b>wheel,</b> touchscreen, voice commands and {{is capable of}} recognizing gestures through a 3D scanner.

Design details and real-time flight simulator results are included...|$|R
5000|$|... 1997 - A limited run of Land Cruiser 80s {{was built}} {{specifically}} for collectors and therefore called the Land Cruiser Collectors Edition. The Collectors Edition sported Collectors Edition badging, [...] "Collectors Edition" [...] embroidered floor mats, automatic climate <b>control,</b> <b>wheels</b> with the [...] "D" [...] windows painted dark grey and special grey side moldings, and black pearl badging. The Collectors Edition was only {{available for the}} 1997 model year and the package was added {{to many of the}} available body colors.|$|E

Other refinements include a StrongArm stealth retainer bar for the A string, Fender [...] "F" [...] lightweight vintage paddle tuners with tapered shafts and an HMV bridge. Controls include master volume, master tone, pickup on/off and series/parallel switching and an active/passive switch for dual-circuit design with inset bass and treble <b>control</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|E
5000|$|As the {{anti-roll}} bar {{is required to}} <b>control</b> <b>wheel</b> position, the bars of a MacPherson strut suspension may be connected through ball joints. However many later [...] "MacPherson strut" [...] suspensions have reverted to using wishbones rather than the simplified track control arm of the original design.|$|R
2500|$|The ERCO 310, which {{included}} a fully cowled engine, made its first flight in October 1937 at College Park Airport and was soon renamed the [...] "Ercoupe". The easy-to-fly design included unique design features, including a large glazed canopy for improved visibility. The prototype 310 featured an ERCO-made inverted four-cylinder engine, the ERCO I-L 116, which was quickly dropped due to its high manufacturing cost compared to the new Continental A-65 horizontal. Lacking rudder pedals, the Ercoupe was flown using only the <b>control</b> <b>wheel.</b> A two-control system linked the rudder and aileron systems, which controlled yaw and roll, with the steerable nosewheel. The <b>control</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>controlled</b> the pitch and the steering of the aircraft, both {{on the ground and}} in the air, simplifying control and coordinated turning and eliminating the need for rudder pedals. A completely new category of pilot's license was created by the CAA for Ercoupe pilots who had never used a rudder pedal.|$|R
50|$|Digital Photography Review {{described}} the changes as representing {{the move from}} 'semi-pro'/'prosumer' to 'enthusiast' due to the reduction in some features; however the pentaprism viewfinder and iconic rear <b>control</b> <b>wheel</b> remain, as does the top informational LCD. The slightly smaller body retains {{the grip of the}} two-digit Canon line.|$|R
