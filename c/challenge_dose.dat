It also causes changes in the acetylation of histones H3 and H4 in the prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, and striatum, suggesting chromatin remodeling changes which may mediate long-term alterations. Additionally, adolescent rats pre-exposed to ethanol have higher basal levels of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens, along with a prolonged dopamine response in this area in response to a <b>challenge</b> <b>dose</b> of ethanol. Together, these results suggest that alcohol exposure during adolescence can sensitize the mesolimbic and mesocortical dopamine pathways to cause changes in dopaminergic and glutamatergic signaling, which may affect the remodeling and functions of the adolescent brain. These changes are significant as alcohol’s effect on NMDARs could contribute to learning and memory dysfunction (see Effects of alcohol on memory).|$|E
40|$|This {{experiment}} is {{an investigation of}} the mosquito?s ability to adapt to high levels of background gamma radiation. Radiation was used as a selective pressure to induce radioresistance among a group of Aedes aegypti mosquitos. Mosquitos were grouped into a High Background Group (HBG) or a Low Background Group (LBG), the LBG being the control group. The HBG was exposed to a continuous field of ionizing gamma radiation significantly higher than the normal background radiation level for the Bryan/ College station (B/CS) area. The HBG spent more than 23 hours per day exposed to the increased levels of radiation. The dose rate ranged from 36 rad/day to 28 rad/day {{over the course of several}} weeks. The radiation exposure to the mosquitos began at the larval stages and continued throughout the adult stages of the mosquito?s lifecycle. During the developmental stages of life living tissues are most susceptible to radiation. Thus by delivering radiation doses during those stages, it provided greater opportunity to induce radioresistance in the mosquitos DNA. Mosquitos in the LBG were reared using the same techniques as the HBG, but in radiation levels similar to that of typical background radiation levels in the B/CS area. The average normal background dose rate at the mosquito lab location is 24 mrem/ year. After mosquitos in the HBG obtained a total dose of approximately 1000 rads over the course of several weeks, the HBG was exposed to a <b>challenge</b> <b>dose</b> provided by a high dose rate gamma source which delivered a total dose of about 70, 000 rads over the course of 7 - 10 hours. Additionally, mosquitos in the LBG were also exposed to the same <b>challenge</b> <b>dose</b> for an equivalent amount of total dose, ? 10 %. Upon completion of the <b>challenge</b> <b>dose,</b> the LBG was cared for utilizing the same methods as before. The HBG, however, did not receive additional high doses of radiation and were only exposed to background radiation similar to the exposure to the LBG. Survival percentages were documented and compared immediately following the <b>challenge</b> <b>dose</b> and continued until all mosquitoes perished. The mosquitos in the HBG consistently had higher survival rates when compared to the LBG. For mosquitos in the first round LBG, 50 % lethality was reached on Day 3 post <b>challenge</b> <b>dose.</b> Mosquitos in the second round LBG, 50 % lethality on Day 1 post <b>challenge</b> <b>dose.</b> After the challenge exposures to the LBG, 62 % of round one and 72 % of round two survived the duration of the exposure.

We evaluated antibody persistence and immune response to a hepatitis B vaccine <b>challenge</b> <b>dose</b> in children aged 15 – 16 years, previously vaccinated with 3 -doses of the same vaccine in infancy (third dose received before 18 months of age). MethodsA single hepatitis B vaccine <b>challenge</b> <b>dose</b> containing 10 μg hepatitis B surface (HBs) antigen was administered to adolescents aged 15 – 16 years. Blood samples were taken before and one month after the <b>challenge</b> <b>dose</b> to measure anti-HBs antibodies using a chemiluminescence immunoassay. Solicited local and general symptoms, as well as unsolicited and serious adverse events were recorded after the <b>challenge</b> <b>dose.</b> Results 303 subjects were enrolled, of whom 302 and 293 subjects formed the total vaccinated and according-to-protocol cohorts, respectively. Pre-challenge, 65. 4 % (95 % CI: 59. 6 – 70. 9) subjects were seroprotected (anti-HBs antibody concentration ≥ 10 mIU/mL). One month post-challenge, 97. 9 % (95 % CI: 95. 6 – 99. 2) were seroprotected, while 90. 8 % (95 % CI: 86. 8 – 93. 8) had anti-HBs antibody concentrations ≥ 100 mIU/mL.

40|$|Vaccination of mice with a peptide {{corresponding}} to the extracellular part of M 2 protein coupled to the immunodominant domain of hepatitis B core can protect mice from a lethal challenge with influenza A virus. As the extracellular part of M 2 protein is highly conserved in all known human influenza A strains, such a vaccine may protect against all human influenza A strains, which would represent a major advantage over current vaccine strategies. The present study demonstrates that protection is mediated exclusively by Abs, a very important feature of a successful preventive vaccine. However, these Abs neither bind efficiently to the free virus nor neutralize virus infection, but bind to M 2 protein expressed {{on the surface of}} virus-infected cells. The presence of NK cells is important for protection, whereas complement is not, supposing that protection is mediated via Ab-dependent, cell-mediated cytotoxicity. The absence of neutralizing Abs results in much weaker protection than that achieved by vaccination with UV-inactivated influenza virus.

These results suggest the involvement of D 2 receptors in cocaine-induced hyperdefensiveness. The hypothesis that alteration in D 2 receptor functioning produced by chronic cocaine administration may produce hyperdefensiveness possibly due to altered perceptive processes is discussed...|$|E

40|$|The monofunctional {{alkylating agent}} methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) was used to study the {{induction}} of inducible protective processes (clastogenic adaptation) in meiotic cells of the grasshopper, Poecilocerus pictus. After a low (conditioning) dose of 0. 012 M and challenging with a high (<b>challenging)</b> <b>dose</b> of 0. 048 M MMS after 2 h time-lag, the incidence of chromosomal anomalies in metaphase I, II and anaphase I and II stages {{was found to be}} significantly less (P < 0. 05) compared to that of the additive effect of both the conditioning and the <b>challenging</b> <b>doses.</b> The data suggest that the low dose of MMS rendered the meiotic cells more resistant to the clastogenic effects of a subsequent high dose of MMS employed. These results lend further support to the earlier report from the same laboratory where a low dose of ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) was found to render protection against a high dose of the same clastogen in meiotic cells of P. pictus. Furthermore, {{it is clear from the}} results that conditioning by the methylating (MMS) agent in cells is less effective in comparison with that of the ethylating (EMS) agent...|$|R
40|$|The {{adaptive}} response (AR) is {{a phenomenon}} by which cells exposure to sublethal doses of DNA-damaging agents (non-mutagenic dose of chemical or radiation), known as conditioning treatment (CT), leads to increased resistance to a subsequent exposure to a higher dose of the same or other agents, known as challenge treatment (CR). The adaptive response (AR) induced by radiation in human lymphocytes {{has been reported in}} a range of 1 - 20 cGy pre-exposure. In this study, we investigated the adaptive response using 5 cGy conditioning dose of gamma rays followed by 2 Gy <b>challenging</b> <b>dose</b> in peripheral human lymphocyte cells. Blood samples were taken from 30 female volunteers and this experiment was carried out by delivering 5 cGy gamma radiation followed by 2 Gy of challenging. Consequently, the number of micronuclei (MN) in binuclear lymphocyte cells was counted as an endpoint. The results showed that the mean frequency of micronuclei in binuclear lymphocytes which have received both conditioning and <b>challenge</b> <b>doses</b> are significantly reduced in comparison to those only exposed to 2 Gy (20. 46 ± 2. 13, 30. 2 ± 3. 29) (P< 0. 01). The results showed the existence of an in vitro adaptive response in lymphocyte cell exposed to low dose of gamma radiations...|$|R
40|$|Radiation induced {{bystander}} {{effects and}} adaptive responses are two phenomena that modulate cellular responses to low doses of ionizing radiation. Bystander effects generally exaggerate {{the effects of}} low doses of radiation by eliciting detrimental effects in nonirradiated cells, thus making the target for radiation effects greater than the volume irradiated. Adaptive responses {{on the other hand}} indicate that low doses of radiation can reduce damage induced by a second <b>challenging</b> <b>dose.</b> The potential impact of these two low dose effects on the shape of the dose response relationship will be discussed...|$|R
