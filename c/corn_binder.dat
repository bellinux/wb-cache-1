It can also be baled into large round bales.|$|R
2500|$|Before World War II, most maize in North America was {{harvested}} by hand. This {{involved a}} {{large numbers of}} workers and associated social events (husking or shucking bees). From the 1890s onward, some machinery became available to partially mechanize the processes, such as one- and two-row mechanical pickers (picking the ear, leaving the stover) and <b>corn</b> <b>binders,</b> which are reaper-binders designed specifically for maize (for example, [...] ). The latter produce sheaves that can be shocked. By hand or mechanical picker, the entire ear is harvested, which then requires a separate operation of a maize sheller to remove the kernels from the ear. Whole ears of maize were often stored in corn cribs, and these whole ears are a sufficient form for some livestock feeding use. Today corn cribs with whole ears, and <b>corn</b> <b>binders,</b> are less common because most modern farms harvest the grain from the field with a combine and store it in bins. The combine with a corn head (with points and snap rolls instead of a reel) does not cut the stalk; it simply pulls the stalk down. The stalk continues downward and is crumpled into a mangled pile on the ground, where it usually is left to become organic matter for the soil. The ear of maize is too large to pass between slots in a plate as the snap rolls pull the stalk away, leaving only the ear and husk to enter the machinery. The combine separates out the husk and the cob, keeping only the kernels.|$|R
40|$|Natural thermal {{insulation}} materials developed from renewable crop by-products and natural binders are analysed {{in terms of}} their thermal degradation and fire behaviour. A Pyrolysis Combustion Flow Calorimetre (PCFC) is used to characterise some kinds of crop by-products, including rice husk, corn pith and barley straw. This technique is complemented with a TG analysis. Six {{thermal insulation}} materials, formulated with such crop by-products and two kind of natural <b>binders,</b> <b>corn</b> starch and sodium alginate, are developed and analysed. PCFC results show an improvement when sodium alginate is incorporated, especially in the corn pith composite. Fire reaction tests are also performed that yield results which are in qualitative agreement with the small-scale testsPeer ReviewedPostprint (author’s final draft...|$|R
40|$|R. Douglas Hurt {{deals with}} the {{invention}} and development of American farm implements and machinery with a special emphasis on the nineteenth century. The material is organized around the functions of various agricultural machines used in the major grain-growing states. Ten chapters focus on the improvements made in plows, grain drills, corn planters, cultivators, reapers, <b>binders,</b> headers, <b>corn</b> <b>binders,</b> <b>corn</b> shellers, threshing machines, combined harvesters, mowing machines, hay stackers, feed mills, and steam traction engines. The author decided to describe certain lines of farm equipment without trying to catalogue all agricultural tools, implements, and machines. Therefore the reader will not find descriptions of such items as cotton gins, saw mills, blacksmith tools, windmills, irrigation pumps, wagons, buggies, washing machines, and hardware materials. Also, during the period 1892 to 1914, no mention is made of the manufacture of {{the internal combustion engine}} and its uses in stationary gas engines, the early tractors, automobiles, trucks, and electric light plants. The judicious use of 219 photographs and illustrations gives a visual presentation of the evolution of rural technology. The verbal descriptions of mechanical and technical matters can be readily understood by the general reader. The book includes a good bibliography and a helpful appendix to aid the reader in understanding the importance of metallurgy as an important factor in the manufacture of farm machinery. Better farm machinery had to wait until the making of steel had been perfected. Some readers would welcome more analysis and interpretation of rural technology. For example, virtually all historians mention that our colonial forefathers used the wooden plow, the sickle, and the flail to grow crops, the same tools used thousands of years earlier in Biblical times. Why was this progress so slow? Why were no new machines invented in colonial America in the 170 years prior to the Revolutionary War? Why did it take two hundred years of experimentation before the first successful track-type Caterpillar engines were built in 1904 ? Combines were widely used in the Pacific Coast states in the 1880 s, yet they were not adopted in the Midwest until the late 1920 s, a lag of forty years. Perhaps historians should give more attention to the factors that deter progress and to the obstacles that prevent the adoption of new ideas, to try to explain the inability of people to adopt new methods. Nevertheless, the narrative is informative and well written. American Farm Tools is a fine addition to the historical record...|$|R
40|$|The {{entry of}} the United States into World War II {{augmented}} {{the necessity of}} utilizing agriculture 2 ̆ 7 s resources to the fullest extent in meeting increased food demands with reduced supplies of labor. One of the principal means of expanding production under such conditions is by fuller use of available farm machinery. Unfortunately, however, when a state of national emergency was declared in May, 1941, little was known either about the utilization of Iowa farm machinery or about the numbers of various types of machines available on the farms. To provide the needed information a survey was conducted in August and September of 1941 {{with the cooperation of}} the Work Projects Administration and the Agricultural Marketing Service. Information was collected in August from 2, 911 farms regarding <b>corn</b> planters, grain <b>binders,</b> grain drills, double disks, single disks, hay loaders, manure spreaders, mowers, plows, rakes, rollers, seeders, spike harrows and spring tooth harrows. The September survey obtained information from 3, 012 farms on. cornpickers, combines, ensilage cutters, grain elevators, corn shellers, feed grinders, milking machines, tractors, trucks, trailers and wagons 2 (table 1) ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study, two {{different}} crop by-products (namely, hemp long fibers and rice husk particles) {{have been used}} to produce natural-based boards (fiber- and particleboards) by using <b>corn</b> starch as <b>binder</b> in order to have the consistence and strength required for internal panels and furniture. A simple and economic transformation process based on the use of hot compression molding has been employed. Mixing fibers or particles with binder has been carried out by simple impregnation in a water solution. Long fibers as well as small particles might be processed with the same machine avoiding any health and pollution problems. Fully green boards have been obtained and characterized in terms of morphology, moisture absorbance and mechanical properties (assessed by both dynamic-mechanical thermal analysis and tensile tests). In addition, the influence of different relative humidity levels on composite modulus has been investigated. Long fibers have proven to be capable of sustaining approximately double loading with respect to articles. Furthermore, the prepared boards have been subjected to three different accelerated aging conditions: namely, i) high temperature (thermal ageing); ii) high temperature combined with humidity and iii) high temperature in the presence of UV radiations (photo-thermal ageing). After these tests both boards have maintained good mechanical properties, with a restrained reduction of their storage modulus (lower than 20 % with respect to the prepared materials) ...|$|R
40|$|Somatic growth (wet {{weight and}} {{equatorial}} and polar test diameters), gonad growth (gonadosomatic index) and gonad quality (color and granularity) {{of the sea}} urchin T. gratilla fed prepared diets were studied in vitro using plastic basins {{for a period of}} four months. The study consisted of three treatments, replicated thrice and arranged in CRD as follows: I-Fresh Sargassum sp. (control), II-Dried pellets, and III-Fresh Extruded pellets. The dried and fresh extruded pellets were mainly of Sargassum sp. with 6. 0 % <b>binder</b> (<b>corn</b> starch and gelatin). No significant variations were observed in the somatic growth of T. gratilla among the different feeding treatments. Highest growth rates were observed during the first culture month decreasing {{towards the end of the}} study. The fresh natural food gave better gonadosomatic index and gonad color than the prepared diets but not for granularity. First spawning was observed at about 1. 5 culture months. Observed water parameters were within the favorable ranges for growth and survival of T. gratilla. The successful introduction of prepared diets for T. gratilla opens the possibility of incorporating gonad color enhancers such as carotenoids in the diet that improves the quality of the organism for market and consumption. This necessitates further studies specifically using locally available pigment sources like tomato, squash, yellow corn and the like. The study likewise demonstrated the viability of land-based culture of the organism using both the fresh natural food and prepared diets. This will be important in sustaining a year-round harvest and possible broodstock source for hatchery and seed stock production...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT A {{total of}} 1360 {{male and female}} chicks were fed starter and {{finisher}} diets containing either 0, 1, 2, or 3 % Nutri-Bond in two separate experiments. A different genotype was used in each experiment. No significant treatment effects were observed for mortality or feed conversion. However, male and female body weights in one replicate were lower when diets were fed which contained I utri-Bond. Monetary returns were lower when the diets contained Nutri-Bond. 1980 Poultry Science 59 : 659 - 661 It has been demonstrated that crumbled and/or pelleted feeds have an advantage over all-mash diets for broiler chickens (Proudfoot and Sefton, 1978). Furthermore, pelleted feed which contains excessive fines does not support growth as well as pelleted feeds with low levels (Proudfoot and Sefton, 1978). When diets containing comparatively high levels of corn meal are pelleted, the pellets tend to disintegrate, resulting in excessive quantities of fines. In order to minimize the fines in pelleted broiler diets containing <b>corn</b> meal, pellet <b>binders</b> {{are added to the}} diets. The two most widely used are lignosol (Proudfoot and DeWitt, 1976) and sodium bentonite-anhydrous silicate clay (Scott et al, 1969). More recently, a by-product of the grain industry referred to as "Nutri-Bond" has appeared on the market as a possible pellet binding agent. Nutri-Bond contains 18 % crude protein, 40 % carbohydrate, 15 % salt (NaCl), and 10. 96 MJ/kg metabolizable energy. The feed industry has questioned the effects on performance resulting from the inclusion of Nutri-Bond in broiler feeds. Two separate experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of feeding 0, 1, 2, and 3 % Nutri-Bond in TABLE 1.
