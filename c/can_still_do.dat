McHale has stated that performing as Artie has made him {{more aware of the}} challenges that people with disabilities face: [...] "It's a completely different side of life. More than ever, I realize how grateful I am {{to be able to get}} up between each take and walk around.

500|$|... "Our Man Bashir" [...] was {{the longest}} shoot of any single episode of Deep Space Nine, taking nine days to film instead of the normal seven. The episode {{required}} {{a great deal of}} stunt work and special equipment, such as stuntmen going through tempered glass instead of sugar glass because of the better glass breaking effect. There {{was a great deal of}} new sets used as well, which each took longer to set up camera and lighting for as the crew were not as familiar with them as the standing sets. The backdrop used for Mount Everest was rented, but the crew realised it lacked snow so they had to modify it and then return it to the original condition afterwards. The majority of the 1960s style technologies such as Dr. Noah's base, were all custom built in house and where parts moved they were generally manually operated off screen.

[...] In the subsequent press conference, pole position winner, Edwards, stated his frustration at his accident, [...] "I’m not exactly sure what happened. I’ll have to talk to Kyle about it. I thought at first he was just frustrated and he turned left to get back in line and he didn’t know I was there, but I watched the tape and I think he really did get loose. He hit me hard and I was left with nothing. I got rammed to the infield." [...] Rick Hendrick, the owner of Hendrick Motorsports, expressed his enjoyment of winning the race, stating, [...] "When you're a champion like Jeff Gordon, you know you <b>can</b> <b>still</b> <b>do</b> it, (even) when people overlook you.

500|$|The episode {{attracted}} {{criticism from}} {{a committee of}} performers with disabilities, who felt that casting an able-bodied actor to play a disabled student was inappropriate. [...] star Robert David Hall commented: [...] "I think there's a fear of litigation, that a person with disabilities might slow a production down, fear that viewers might be uncomfortable." [...] Glee executive producer Brad Falchuk responded that while he understood the concern and frustration of disability advocates, McHale had the singing and acting ability and charisma required for the role and: [...] "it's hard {{to say no to}} someone that talented". McHale has stated that he is pleased to represent a character in a wheelchair, and that: [...] "I think what's great about it is just because he's in a wheelchair, he <b>can</b> <b>still</b> <b>do</b> what everyone else does." [...] Kristin Dos Santos of E! Online refuted criticism of the episode, opining that: Wheels' is all about empowering people with disabilities and sends out an uplifting message to the disabled community." [...] Gerrick Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times expressed a similar sentiment, stating: [...] "Here we have an episode bluntly addressing the complexities of disability and doing so with so much respect and dignity, and there are complaints about Artie not being wheelchair-bound in real life? Cooooome on, guys." ...|$|E

6000|$|If I can un{{intentionally}} cast a glamour, an enchantment, over {{persons of}} our own time who have lived for years in great cities, {{there is no reason}} to doubt that men could cast intentionally a far stronger enchantment, a far stronger glamour, over the more sensitive people of ancient times, or that men <b>can</b> <b>still</b> <b>do</b> so where the old order of life remains unbroken.

Why should not enchanters like him in the Morte d'Arthur make troops of horse seem but grey stones? Why should not the Roman soldiers, though they came of a civilization which was ceasing to be sensitive to these things, have trembled for a moment before the enchantments of the Druids of Mona?

6000|$|Now, if any {{ask whether}} it be imaginable that an {{ordinary}} man of the wealthier type should analyse the problem or conceive the plan, the inhumanly far-seeing plan, as I have set it forth, the answer is: [...] "Certainly not." [...] Many rich employers are too generous to do such a thing; many are too stupid {{to know what they}} are doing. The eugenical opportunity I have described is but an ultimate analysis of a whole drift of thoughts in the type of man who does not analyse his thoughts. He sees a slouching tramp, with a sick wife and a string of rickety children, and honestly wonders what he can do with them. But prosperity does not favour self-examination; and he does not even ask himself whether he means [...] "How can I help them?" [...] or [...] "How can I use them?"--what he <b>can</b> <b>still</b> <b>do</b> for them, or what they could still do for him. Probably he sincerely means both, but the latter much more than the former; he laments the breaking of the tools of Mammon much more than the breaking of the images of God.

6000|$|While pheasant-shooters {{are enjoying}} {{the first day}} of the season, the votaries of a sport not less noble, though less noisy, are holding the great festival of their year. The autumn meeting of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St. Andrews is in full swing, and the words will suggest {{pleasant}} memories to many a golfer. Golf is not one of the more brilliant and famous pastimes of the day, though it yields to none in antiquity and in unassuming merit. The names of the winners of the gold medal and of the silver cross are not telegraphed all over the world as widely as Mr. Tennyson's hero wished the news that Maud had accepted him to be. The red man may possibly [...] "dance beneath his red cedar tree" [...] at the tidings of the event of one of our great horse-races, or great university matches. At all events, even if the red man preserves his usual stoicism of demeanour, his neighbours, the pale-faces, like to know all about the result of many English sports the moment they are decided. Golf, as we have said, excites less general enthusiasm; but in people who love it at all, the love is burning, consuming; they will talk golf-shop in season and out of season. Few persons, perhaps, will call golf the very first and queen of games. Cricket exercises more faculties of body, and even of mind, for does not the artful bowler [...] "bowl with his head?" [...] Football demands an extraordinary personal courage, and implies the existence of a fierce delight in battle with one's peers. Tennis, with all its merits, is a game for the few, so rare are tennis-courts and so expensive the pastime. But cricketers, football-players, tennis-players, would all give golf the second place after their favourite exercise; and just as Themistocles was held to be the best Greek general, because each of his fellows placed him second, so golf may assert a right to be thought the first of games. One great advantage it certainly has--it is a game for [...] "men" [...] of all ages, from eight, or even younger, to eighty. The links of St. Andrews are probably cleared just now of the little lads and the veterans, they make room for the heroes, the medalists, the great players--Mr. Mackay, Mr. Lamb, Mr. Leslie Balfour, and the rest. But at ordinary times there are always dozens of tiny boys in knickerbockers and scarlet stockings, who [...] "drive out" [...] the first hole in some twenty strokes of their little clubs, and who pass much of their time in fishing for their lost balls in the muddy burn. As for the veterans [...] "on the threshold of old age," [...] it is pleasant to watch their boyish eagerness, the swaying of their bodies as they watch the short flight of their longest hits; their delight when they do manage to hit further than the sand-pit, or [...] "bunker," [...] which is named after the nose of a long-dead principal of the university; their caution, nay, their almost tedious delay in the process of putting, that is, of hitting the ball over the [...] "green" [...] into the neighbouring hole. They <b>can</b> <b>still</b> <b>do</b> their round, or their two rounds, five or ten miles' walking a day, and who can speak otherwise than well of a game which is not too strenuous for healthy age or tender childhood, and yet allows an athlete of twenty-three to put out all his strength? ...|$|E
