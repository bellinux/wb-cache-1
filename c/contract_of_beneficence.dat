40|$|M. Phil. (Industrial Psychology) Orientation: The aim of {{this study}} was to frame {{psychological}} testing in a specific and clear manner that is grounded in beneficence. This could potentially be used to positively contribute toward the development, control, and use of psychological testing in South Africa. This was attained by looking at psychological testing through a beneficence lens, so that it is grounded beyond the preventative stance <b>of</b> regulation, in <b>beneficence.</b> The principle <b>of</b> <b>beneficence</b> was explained to the participants, who were then encouraged to approach psychological testing from a beneficence perspective. Research purpose: Despite considerable literature existing on the moral principle <b>of</b> <b>beneficence</b> in various contexts, there is restricted research on its association with psychological testing. Hence, this study explored how to ground psychological testing in the moral principle <b>of</b> <b>beneficence,</b> for application in the South African workplace. This was formulated to explore the essence <b>of</b> <b>beneficence</b> as positively contributing to the welfare of others, from which actions were identified to promote understanding in grounding psychological testing in this regard...|$|R

40|$|Some {{people are}} such {{impressive}} altruists {{that they seem}} to us to already be doing more than enough. And yet they see themselves as compelled to do even more. Can our view be reconciled with theirs? Can a moderate view <b>of</b> <b>beneficence’s</b> demands be made consistent with a requirement to be ambitiously altruistic? I argue that a reconciliation is possible if we adopt a dynamic view <b>of</b> <b>beneficence,</b> which addresses the pattern that our altruism is required to take over time. This frees up theoretical space for understanding how a moral duty of self-development can intersect with the requirements <b>of</b> <b>beneficence,</b> so that the amount that we are required to sacrifice increases without our beneficence becoming immoderate...|$|R

40|$|Medical ethics as a {{scholarly}} discipline {{and a system}} of moral principles that apply values and judgments {{to the practice of}} medicine encompasses its practical application in clinical settings as well as work on its history, philosophy, theology, anthropology and sociology. As such {{there are a number of}} values in medical ethics such as autonomy, non-maleficence, confidentiality, dignity, honesty, justice and beneficence, among others. These values act as guidelines for professionals in the medical fraternity and are therefore used to judge different cases in the fraternity. For purposes of this work, this paper examines the principle <b>of</b> <b>beneficence</b> in biomedicine. Using both hypothetical cases and others in real life situations, the paper reflects on the implications <b>of</b> <b>beneficence</b> in biomedicine. It argues that the principle <b>of</b> <b>beneficence</b> is a prima facie obligation that should “always be acted upon unless it conflicts on a particular occasion with an equal or stronger principle”.

40|$|Patients with {{borderline}} {{personality disorder}} are frequent users of inpatient mental health units, with inpatient crisis intervention often used {{based on the}} risk of suicide. However this can present an ethical dilemma for nursing and medical staff, with these clinician responses shifting between the moral principles <b>of</b> <b>beneficence</b> and non-maleficence, dependent on the outcomes {{of the actions of}} containing or tolerating risk. This paper examines the use of crisis intervention through moral duties, intentions and consequences, culminating in an action/consequences model of risk management, used to explore potential outcomes. This model may be useful in measuring adherence and violation of the principles <b>of</b> <b>beneficence</b> and non-maleficence, and therefore an aid to clinical decision making...|$|R
40|$|The chief moral {{justification}} for investment in genetic technologies {{is on the}} basis of their medical benefit to humanity. However, the humanitarian goal of medicine has come to play a less prominent role in the bioethical literature and medical codes over the course of the twentieth-century. Instead, the promotion of benefit is more frequently discussed in the context of a physician’s duty <b>of</b> <b>beneficence</b> to his or her patient. This study argues that the economic and social questions that emerge in ethical discussions of genetics are inadequately served by the more restrictive language <b>of</b> <b>beneficence.</b> The concept <b>of</b> the common good (or public welfare) offers a more versatile means to discuss the social questions that genetics poses...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the principle <b>of</b> <b>beneficence</b> {{in the light}} of moral and epistemological concerns that have crystallized in the South African context around clinical care. Three examples from the South African experience affecting the development of bioethics are examined: medical colonialism, the death in detention of Steve Biko, and the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Michael Gelfand's book [(1948). The sick African: a clinical study. Cape Town: Stewart Printing Company. ] on African medical conditions captures the ambiguous nature of colonial medicine that linked genuine medical treatment with the civilizing mission. Biko's death was a key historical event that deeply implicated the medical profession under apartheid. The present HIV/AIDS epidemic presents the gravest social and political crisis for South African society. All three experiences influence the meaning and relevance <b>of</b> <b>beneficence</b> as a bioethics principle in the South African context. This paper argues for a South African bioethics informed by a critical humanism that takes account of the colonial past, and that does not model itself on an "original wound" or negation, but on positive care-giving practices.

40|$|Losing {{ownership}} {{and control over}} the development of and connection to our own person detaches us from the most innate embodiment of ourselves, our person. Without being able to develop and connect to our person, we become detached from expressing our identity, exercising our autonomy, and formulating our own values, the most intrinsic features our person encapsulates. While we yearn to act on our own projects to express our identity, exercise our autonomy, and formulate our own values the way we want, morality imposes huge demands on our person that restrain us from doing so. Morality’s major requirement to always act on morally significant projects to produce the overall good puts us at risk of forfeiting our identity, autonomy, and values. Despite these features being the most innate embodiment of ourselves, morality neglects them so that we always participate in its domain <b>of</b> <b>beneficence</b> to further the interests of others who are in need. Even though great benefits result from always acting on morally significant projects to produce the overall good, we {{are at odds with}} moral <b>beneficence</b> because <b>of</b> the demands it imposes on our person. In this thesis, it is argued what makes a moral theory too demanding. Arguments by Bernard Williams, Samuel Scheffler, Liam B. Murphy, and Richard W. Miller are evaluated to construct views of what makes a moral theory too demanding for them. Afterwards, differences and commonalities are drawn from their views to frame the final view of what makes a moral theory too demanding that is argued here. All of the philosophers’ views contribute to the claim that we are entitled to our lives outside of morality’s domain <b>of</b> <b>beneficence.</b> Afterwards, it is explained why we are entitled to our lives outside of morality’s domain <b>of</b> <b>beneficence.</b> The most compelling explanation is that the potential development of our own person entitles us to do so outside of morality’s domain <b>of</b> <b>beneficence.</b> By developing our person to its fullest height on our own terms and conditions, we can connect to it in the best way possible. Nonetheless, because we are forced to always participate in morality’s domain <b>of</b> <b>beneficence,</b> we lack the {{ownership and}} control over the development of and connection to our own person. The demandingness of morality holds the reins over this relation between the development of and connection to our person when in fact we should...|$|R
