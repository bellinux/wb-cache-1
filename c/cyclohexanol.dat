40|$|Abstract: Cyclization of {{unsaturated}} ketyl radical anions, photochemically {{induced by}} electron transfer from triethylamine (NEt 3) to unsaturated ketones, produced cyclopentanols or <b>cyclohexanols.</b> The cyclization reaction was regio-, stereo- and chemo- selective and gave high yields in cyclopentanols or <b>cyclohexanols.</b> Ketyl radical anions could also induce the ring opening of strained ring such as cyclopropanes, epoxides and 7 -oxabicyclo[2. 2. l]heptanes. Furthermore 3 -azabicyclo[4. 3. 0]nonane skeletons {{were obtained by}} photoreductive cyclization of €,a-unsaturated p-ketoamides, and azaspiranic skeletons by treatment of unsaturated p-ketoamides or enaminoamides by Mn(0 Ac) g. Application of these methodologies to natural products synthesis is described. Cyclization of &€-unsaturated radicals is a very fast process which leads to cyclopentylmethyl or cyclohexyl radicals.

50|$|Cyclohexenone was accidentally {{found to}} be an {{in-vitro}} catalyst for a relatively mild decarboxylation of alpha amino acids in 1986. Researchers in Japan were attempting to use t-butyl peroxide {{as a catalyst for}} decarboxylation using a solvent choice of <b>cyclohexanol.</b> Curiously they found that when they used lower-purity (e.g. technical grade, 98%) <b>cyclohexanol,</b> the reaction proceeded as much as 4 times faster compared to when they used relatively pure <b>cyclohexanol</b> (>99.3%). They found that <b>cyclohexanol</b> contained cyclohexenone as a natural impurity, which was three times more abundant in the technical grade cyclohexenone compared to the more purified <b>cyclohexanol</b> (~0.3% versus ~0.1%). Further research showed that 1% Cyclohexenone in <b>cyclohexanol</b> will decarboxylate most alpha-amino acids, including non-standard ones, with a yield of 80-95% in a matter of several hours. The exceptions are certain amino acids like histidine, which was reported to take over 26 hours, and poly-amino acids, which fail to decarboxylate using 2-cyclohexenone and another route must be found instead.|$|E

50|$|Cannabicyclohexanol {{has four}} stereoisomers, which by analogy with other related {{cannabinoid}} compounds {{can be expected}} to have widely varying affinity for cannabinoid receptors, and consequently will show considerable variation in potency. While the (-)-cis stereoisomer (-)-cannabicyclohexanol discovered in the original Pfizer research {{is expected to be the}} most potent, all four stereoisomers have been isolated from illicit samples of this compound, and the properties of the other three enantiomers have not been studied in detail. Most commonly cannabicyclohexanol is encountered as a enantiomeric mix of the two cis or two trans isomers in varying ratios, though more rarely a mixture of all four stereoisomers has been seen, as well as reasonably enantiopure samples of the most active isomer. Confusion can arise around the naming of these compounds as they can be viewed either as substituted phenols or substituted <b>cyclohexanols,</b> but this results in different numbering of the rings. Consequently, the active isomer can be named either 2-(1S,3R)-3-hydroxycyclohexyl-5-(2-methylnonan-2-yl)phenol or (1R,3S)-3-2-hydroxy-4-(2-methylnonan-2-yl)phenylcyclohexan-1-ol.|$|R

40|$|Rational modulations of {{molecular}} interactions are of significant importance in compound properties optimization. We have previously shown that fluorination of conformationally rigid <b>cyclohexanols</b> leads to attenuation of their hydrogen-bond (H-bond) donating capacity (designated by pKAHY) when OH⋅⋅⋅F intramolecular hydrogen-bond (IMHB) interactions occur, {{as opposed to}} an increase in pKAHY due to the fluorine electronegativity. This work has now been extended to a wider range of aliphatic β-fluorohydrins with increasing degrees of conformational flexibility. We show that the observed differences in pKAHY between closely related diastereomers can be fully rationalized by subtle variations in populations of conformers able to engage in OH⋅⋅⋅F IMHB, {{as well as by the}} strength of these IMHBs. We also show that the Kenny theoretical Vα(r) descriptor of H-bond acidity accurately reflects the observed variations and a calibration equation extended to fluorohydrins is proposed.

It aims at novel process options for defunctionalization and hydrodeoxygenation of phenolic and aromatic biorefinery feeds under low-severity conditions. A series of 32 model substrates were explored, providing a comprehensive description of the reactivity of RANEY (R) Ni toward transfer hydrogenation and transfer hydrogenolysis. In addition, the aspects related to the catalyst stability were addressed in detail.
