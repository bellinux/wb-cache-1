The active core is a topographic guide formed from aluminophosphosilicate glass doped with erbium and ytterbium. The buffer is formed from silica deposited by thermal oxidation and the cladding from borophosphosilicate glass obtained by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition. The use of low process temperatures allows relatively heavy doping and careful {{control of the}} core etching allows low background insertion losses to be obtained.

40|$|Fiber lasers are pumped by fibercoupled, {{multimode}} single chip devices at 915 nm. That's {{what everybody}} assumes when {{asked for the}} type of fiber laser pumps and it was like this for many years. Coming up as an amplifier for telecom applications, the amount of pump power needed was in the range of several watts. Highest pump powers for a limited market entered the ten watts range. This is a range of power that can be covered by highly reliable multimode chips, that have to survive up to 25 years, e. g. in submarine applications. With fiber lasers entering the power range and the application fields of rod and thin disc lasers, the amount of pump power needed raised into the area of several hundred watts. In this area of pump power, usually bar based pumps are used. This is due to the much higher cost pressure of the industrial customers compared to telecom customers. We expect more then 70 % of all industrial systems to be pumped by diode laser bars. Predictions that bar based pumps survive for just a thousand hours in cw-operation and fractions of this if pulsed are wrong. Bar based pumps have to perform on full power for 10. 000 h on Micro channel heat sinks and 20. 000 h on passive heatsinks in industrial applications, and they do.

40|$|European {{energy systems}} {{are in a}} period of {{significant}} transition, with the increasing shares of variable renewable energy (VRE) and less flexible fossil-based generation units as predominant factors. The supply-side changes are expected to cause large short-term electricity price volatility. More frequent periods of low electricity prices may mean that electric use in flexible heating systems will become more profitable, and such flexible heating systems may, in turn, improve the integration of increasing shares of VRE. The objective {{of this study is to}} analyze the likely future of Nordic electricity price levels and variations and how the expected prices might affect the use of electricity and thermal storage in heat-only district heating plants. We apply the North European energy market model Balmorel to provide scenarios for future hourly electricity prices in years with normal, high, and low inflow levels to the hydro power system. The simulation tool energyPRO is subsequently applied to quantify how these electricity price scenarios affect the hourly use of thermal storage and individual boilers in heat-only district heating plants located in Norway. The two studied example plants use wood <b>chips</b> or heat <b>pump</b> as base load representing common technologies for district heating in Norway. The Balmorel results show that annual differences in inflow is still a decisive factor for Norwegian and Nordic electricity prices in year 2030 and that short-term (daily) price variability is expected to increase. In the plant-level simulations, we find that tank storage, which is currently installed in only a few district heating plants in Norway, is a profitable flexibility option that will significantly reduce the use of fossil peak load in both biomass and heat-pump-based systems. Installation of an electric boiler in addition to tank storage is profitable in the heat pump system due to the limited capacity of the heat pump. Electricity will hence, to a large extent, replace gas when heat demand exceeds the capacity of the heat pump. For the bio-based plant, we find that an electric boiler in addition to tank storage is not profitable in the normal electricity price scenario. The electric boiler investments are only profitable when electricity prices are as low as in the high inflow scenario. In that case the electric boiler will provide 17...|$|R

One of the basic components in microfluidic systems ismicropumps. During recent years several different micropumpshave been presented based on different pump principles andusing different actuation principles. In this thesis the firstmicromachined versions of pumps based on the new valve-lessdiffuser pump principle are presented. The key element in the diffuser pump is the diffuserelement. A diffuser is a gradually expanding flow channelintended to raise the static pressure. The largest pressurerise is achieved for small opening angles. The diffuser elementis a diffuser with a rounded inlet and a sharp outlet. It ischaracterized by a lower flow resistance in the diffuserdirection than in the opposite direction, the nozzledirection. In the valve-less diffuser pump diffuser elements are usedas flow directing elements. One diffuser element is directedfrom the inlet chamber to the pump chamber and the otherdiffuser element from the pump chamber to the outlet chamber. Amoving boundary of the pump chamber forces the fluid throughthe two diffuser elements. The result is a net transport offluid from the inlet side to the outlet side due to thedifference in the flow resistances in the diffuser and nozzledirections. Pumps of different sizes for both liquids and gases havebeen fabricated in different materials using both conventionalfabrication methods and micromachining technology. Extensivemeasurements {{have been made to}} investigate the performance ofthe diffuser pumps. These results have been used together withnumerical simulations and classical fluid mechanics in order tounderstand the working principle of the diffuser pump and tofurther improve the design. Based on the empirical results andsimulations using a lumped-mass model improved designs aresuggested. All the tested pumps show good performance. The pump withthe best test result is fabricated in silicon using deepreactive ion etching (DRIE) which allows any arbitrary planardesign of the pump.

40|$|One time {{programmable}} memory (OTP) is {{one type}} of nonvolatile memory (NVM). The most attractive feature of OTP is low cost and simple process. Existing NVMs such as the FLASH, aside from having technology scaling limitations, require additional masks and process modifications to CMOS that makes the cost increase. Other types of NVMs such as the antifuses (AF) do not have limitation problem {{and the cost of}} fabrication of it is lower than FLASH. However, the mainstream AFs still require three masks to the standard CMOS. OTP has found many applications in trimming, storage element in RFID and IP protection. In particular, CMOS compatible zero-additional-mask approach has been the most popular method to implement OTP memories. In this thesis, a diode based OTP memory technology using the breakdown of PN diode as the OTP element has been developed. The memory cell and array configuration, as well as charge pump that can be readily integrated in conventional CMOS. In Chapter 2, In particular the program disturb problem is resolved by using diode drivers with sufficiently high breakdown voltage. The choices of memory elements and various available diodes in a standard CMOS process are carefully studied to obtain an optimal combination. The electrical characteristic of the polysilicon diodes have been studied. The design of the polysilicon diode and the silicon substrate diodes as memory elements of the diode based OTP memory is discussed in this thesis. Different memory cells were fabricated in the standard 0. 18 -μm CMOS technology to verify the functionality of the design. In Chapter 3, the maximum output voltage of the charge pump circuit is limited by the breakdown voltage between the undesired silicon substrate diode between the N-type drain and the grounded P-type substrate. The output voltage of charge pump which is fully implemented by polysilicon diodes can be larger than the breakdown voltage of the undesired silicon substrate diode.

40|$|Genetic and {{epigenetic}} {{analyses of}} cells are powerful tools broadly applicable to clinical diagnosis, drug screening, forensic identification, food safety inspection, environmental monitoring and biowarfare testing. The translation of conventional analytical techniques using macroscale apparatus to microfluidic chip format offers {{the advantages of}} enhanced sensitivity and speed, decreased the potential sample cross-contamination and product loss, reduced sample and reagent consumption, favorable fluidic properties, low cost, and disposability. This dissertation presents the development of several microfluidic chips {{that are capable of}} analyzing and manipulating cells for genetic or epigenetic studies. ^ Histone modifications are important epigenetic mechanisms involved in eukaryotic gene regulation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay serves as the prime technique to characterize the genomic locations associated with histone modifications. However, traditional tube-based ChIP assays rely on large numbers of cells as well as laborious and time-consuming procedures. I first demonstrate a novel microfluidics-based ChIP assay which dramatically reduced the required cell number and the assay time by conducting cell collection, cell lysis, chromatin fragmentation, immunoprecipitation, and washing on a microchip. Coupled with real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the assay permitted the analysis of histone modifications from as few as ∼ 50 cells within 8. 5 h. The results indicate that the method will provide a new approach for analysis of epigenetic regulations and protein-DNA interactions in general based on scarce cell samples. ^ Electrical lysis based on irreversible electroporation is a promising technique for genetic analysis due to its fast speed and reagentless procedure. However, knowledge on DNA extraction from electrically lysed samples is still lacking. To address this challenge, I constructed a novel integrated microfluidic chip capable of performing sample preparation for genetic analysis. The microchip was able to physically trap a given amount of cells, lyse the cells in 1. 5 min using 10 square direct current (DC) electrical pulses, as well as purify and concentrate genomic DNA. Efficient integration of the three key steps successfully generated sufficient products amenable to off-chip real-time PCR assay from as few as ∼ 30 mammalian Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K 1) cells and 102 colony-forming units (CFU) of Gram-negative bacteria Salmonella typhimurium. DNA yield exhibited a great dependency on electrical field intensity and a good linearity with respect to the amount of bacterial cells. I envision that the device will be fully integrated with PCR assays and quantitative detection techniques to implement a total analysis system with sample-in-answer-out capability. ^ In addition, I present a strategy for active modulation of DNA adsorption and desorption on silica beads in an electrically actuated microfluidic chip by varying the buffer pH through electrolysis of water. This technique provides a novel method for DNA purification and concentration in a low ionic strength buffer, which eliminates the utilization of harsh chemicals typically involved in traditional DNA extraction procedure. ^ Genetic modification of cells is a critical step involved in functional gene studies. However, the throughput of current transfection methods is limited. In the final chapter, I present a novel flow-through electroporation method for delivery of genes into cells at high flow rates (up to ∼ 20 ml/min) based on disposable microfluidic <b>chips,</b> a syringe <b>pump,</b> and a low-cost DC power supply that provides a constant voltage. By eliminating pulse generators used in conventional electroporation, the method dramatically lowered the cost of the apparatus and improved the stability and consistency of the electroporation field for long-time operation. I tested the delivery of pEGFP-C 1 plasmids encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein into CHO-K 1 cells in the devices of various dimensions and geometries. Cells were mixed with plasmids and then flowed through a fluidic channel continuously while a constant voltage was established across the device. Together with the applied voltage, the geometry and dimensions of the fluidic channel determined the electrical parameters of the electroporation. With the optimal design, ∼ 75 % of the viable CHO-K 1 cells were transfected after the procedure. I also generalize the guidelines for scaling up these flow-through electroporation devices. This technique will serve as a generic and low-cost tool for a variety of biological applications requiring large volume of transfected cells. ...|$|R

To demonstrate the microchip functionality, identification of human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16, the etiological agent for cervical cancer has been used. The work shows for the first time successful real-time amplification and detection employing NASBA in microsystem formats using custom-made instruments. The first silicon-glass chips contained reaction chambers of 10 nl and 50 nl, which decreased the NASBA reaction volume by a factor of 2000 and 400, respectively. Further, experiments employing cyclic olefin copolymer (COC) microchips for simultaneous amplification and detection, automatically distributed the sample into 10 parallel reaction channels with detection volumes of 80 nl. In order to detect the simultaneous amplification in the reaction channels, a second custom-made optical detection system with increased sensitivity, heat regulation and an automatic non-contact pumping mechanism, was made. Dilution series of both artificial HPV 16 oligonucleotides and SiHa cell lines showed that the detection limits for the microchips were comparable to those obtained for experiments performed in conventional routine-based laboratory-systems. For experiments related {{to the development of a}} self-contained microchip for NASBA, the detection volume was increased to 500 nl due to the advantage of an increased fluorescence signal. For the NASBA reaction, biocompatible surfaces are critical. It was not possible to amplify any target in microchips with native silicon or COC surfaces. Adsorption measurements indicated clearly that fluorescently labelled mouse IgG bound non-specifically to the hydrophobic native COC surfaces, while PEG coated COC surfaces showed adequate protein resistance. Of the coatings tested for the COC microchips, surfaces modified with PEG showed the best biocompatibility. Successful amplification was obtained with silicon microchips when the surfaces were modified with either SigmaCote™ or SiO 2. In order to integrate the NASBA reagents on chip, a thorough evaluation of the reagents to be spotted and dried was performed. Because of the limited number of microchipsavailable, it was necessary to map the most critical parameters on macroscale prior to transfer to the microscale. The DMSO and sorbitol enclosed in the standard NASBA reaction mixture were difficult to dry, and therefore it was necessary to add these compounds to the oligonucleotides or the sample of extracted nucleic acids before the sample was applied on the amplification chip. The standard NASBA reagents consist of the two main solutions, mastermix and enzymes, in addition to the sample. Both the mastermix and the enzymes were stable only when spotted and dried separately. Protectants, such as PEG and trehalose were essential for recovery of enzymatic activity after drying on macroscale. The times for diffusion of modified molecular beacons in dried mastermix and of fluorescently labelled mouse IgG in the dried enzyme solution were ~ 60 seconds and ~ 10 minutes, respectively. So far, only dried enzymes with 0. 05 % PEG protectant have been successfully amplified on chip. Successful amplification using a rehydrated mastermix on microchip still remains. Optimal design and fabrication methods of the microchips were found to be crucial for chip performance. Rough surfaces do not only create background noise for the optical measurements, but it also contributes to generation of bubbles and problems related to manipulation of the sample within the channel network. The silicon microchips were manufactured with optically smooth surfaces. However, low surface roughness was not easily obtained for the COC microchips. Of the fabrication methods evaluated, it was the injection moulded chips which showed the smoothest surfaces, closely followed by the hot embossed chips. Milled and laser ablated chips produced the roughest surfaces. A novel non-contact pumping mechanism based on on-chip flexible COC membranes, combined with actuation pins in the surrounding instrument, was tested and evaluated. The mechanism enabled metering, isolation and movement of nanoliter sized sample plugs in parallel reaction channels. The COC <b>chips</b> with integrated <b>pumps</b> were able to simultaneously move parallel sample plugs along the reaction channels in four different positions. Each reaction channel contained a set of 4 actuation chambers in order to obtain metering, isolation and movement of the sample plug into the detection area. The pump accuracy depended on the evaporation of sample and the deformation of the COC membranes. The results presented in this work are promising with regard to the development of a complete integrated and self-contained mRNA amplification microchip for multi-parallel target testing of clinical samples...|$|R
