5|$|The current Emperor's flag is a 16-petal <b>chrysanthemum,</b> colored in gold, {{centered}} on a red background with a 2:3 ratio. The Empress uses the same flag, except the shape {{is that of a}} swallow tail. The crown prince and the crown princess use the same flags, except with a smaller <b>chrysanthemum</b> and a white border {{in the middle of the}} flags. The <b>chrysanthemum</b> has been associated with the Imperial throne since the rule of Emperor Go-Toba in the 12th century, but it did not become the exclusive symbol of the Imperial throne until 1868.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 1870, flags {{were created}} for the Japanese Emperor (then Emperor Meiji), the Empress, and for {{other members of the}} {{imperial}} family. At first, the Emperor's flag was ornate, with a sun resting {{in the center of a}}n artistic pattern. He had flags that were used on land, at sea, and when he was in a carriage. The imperial family was also granted flags to be used at sea and while on land (one for use on foot and one carriage flag). The carriage flags were a monocolored <b>chrysanthemum,</b> with 16 petals, placed in the center of a monocolored background. These flags were discarded in 1889 when the Emperor decided to use the <b>chrysanthemum</b> on a red background as his flag. With minor changes in the color shades and proportions, the flags adopted in 1889 are still in use by the imperial family.|$|E
