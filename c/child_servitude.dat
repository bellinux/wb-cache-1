5000|$|The stated {{vision of}} Bachpan Bachao Andolan (BBA) is [...] "to create a child {{friendly}} society where {{all children are}} free from exploitation and receive free and quality education. It aims to identify, liberate, rehabilitate and educate <b>children</b> in <b>servitude</b> through direct intervention, child and community participation, coalition building, consumer action, promoting ethical trade practices and mass gaming." ...|$|R
50|$|Bachpan Bachao Andolan (BBA; Save Childhood Movement) is an India-based {{movement}} {{campaigning for}} the rights of children. It was started in 1980 by Nobel Laureate Mr. Kailash Satyarthi. Its focus has centred on ending bonded labour, child labour and human trafficking, as well as demanding the right to education for all children. It has so far freed 85,000 <b>children</b> from <b>servitude,</b> including bonded labourers, and helped in their successful re-integration, rehabilitation and education.|$|R
50|$|BBA {{was formed}} in 1980 by Mr. Kailash Satyarthi, Nobel Peace Prize Laureate for 2014, who was appalled by the plight of child slavery across South Asia. Child labour has been {{socially}} accepted and widely practised in the region for generations, being seen as a necessary outcome of poverty. BBA became the first organization in India to highlight the issue and spawned the wider South Asian Coalition on <b>Child</b> <b>Servitude</b> (SACCS).|$|E
5000|$|Efforts {{exist to}} address {{the root cause of}} <b>child</b> <b>servitude.</b> Improving the economy, {{especially}} through government support for the rural population, would undermine parents’ incentive to give children up, as would an improved health care and education system. [...] Parents would not be as easily pressured by recruiters to hand their children over to become restaveks if they were provided with aid such as food, clothing, and clean water.|$|E
50|$|The Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery, {{the full}} title {{of which is}} the Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery, the Slave Trade, and Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery, is a 1956 United Nations treaty which builds upon the 1926 Slavery Convention, which is still {{operative}} and which proposed to secure the abolition of slavery and of the slave trade, and the Forced Labour Convention of 1930, which banned forced or compulsory labour, by banning debt bondage, serfdom, child marriage, servile marriage, and <b>child</b> <b>servitude.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{government}} made clear progress in combating trafficking during the reporting period, {{particularly with regard}} to identifying trafficking victims, investigating potential trafficking offenses, and raising public awareness. In 2009, a Bujumbura court heard a case involving <b>child</b> domestic <b>servitude,</b> the first known prosecution of a case involving elements of a human trafficking offense. Significant work remains, however, in educating the government officials and local populations about the nature of human trafficking, bringing cases to trial, and providing protective services to victims.|$|R
5000|$|Prince Boston {{was born}} into slavery on Nantucket, Massachusetts in 1750. His parents, Boston and Maria, were the slaves of William Swain, a Nantucket merchant. In 1760, William Swain freed Prince's parents with the {{stipulation}} that each of their <b>children</b> remain in <b>servitude</b> {{until the age of}} 28.|$|R
5000|$|Yet, the {{boundary}} between <b>child</b> apprenticeship and <b>servitude</b> could prove quite ambiguous. Child servant contracts were sometimes converted to apprenticeships, and vice versa, upon [...] "assignment" [...] (or resale). In some cases children recorded as apprentices actually found themselves laboring in the fields instead of receiving the stipulated training. Whether a servant or apprentice, children usually held contracts that lasted until their reaching an age of maturity, twenty-one/two for males and eighteen for females.|$|R
50|$|The {{first and}} most {{important}} work that CWIN did was to translate the draft UN Convention on the Rights of the Child into Nepali in 1987. In 1988, it organised the first South Asian Seminar-Workshop on Working Children. This provided an opportunity to discuss issues like <b>child</b> <b>servitude</b> and other urgent, child-related issues at the regional level, and to expand the reach of CWIN. In 1991 CWIN published its research paper Urban Child Labour, which included a wide coverage of the status of children throughout Nepal. In 1993, CWIN organised a major study programme of children at risk, such as street children, those working in different sectors, especially the carpet industry, young victims of trafficking and prostitution, and children in debt bondage. In 1994, it opened the CWIN Children's Home, a transit centre for children at risk: CWIN Balika.|$|E
5000|$|The {{majority}} of trafficking victims in Europe are young adult {{women and the}} most common reason for human trafficking is sexual exploitation. [...] However, trafficking for forced labor makes up one third of all trafficking occurrences; victims go to the agriculture, construction, fishery, manufacturing, and textile industries. There are also women and men being trafficked {{for the purposes of}} domestic <b>servitude.</b> <b>Children</b> in this region are trafficked for the purposes of sexual exploitation, forced marriage and forced begging.|$|R
50|$|Hall's case {{lasted from}} 2001 to 2007. It {{was decided that}} Hall not {{be put on the}} stand. Hall's oldest sister came to testify against Hall {{with the support of the}} Ibrahims. The Ibrahims pleaded guilty and were sentenced to time in prison. Amal Ahmed Ewis-Abd El Motelib {{received}} twenty-two months in prison and was deported to Egypt while Abdel Nasser Youssef Ibrahim received a sentence of three years in prison. The charges brought against the Ibrahims were keeping a <b>child</b> in involuntary <b>servitude</b> and harboring an alien. Part of the Ibrahims' plea deal entailed that they pay Hall $152,000.|$|R
50|$|The Government of Senegal made minimal {{efforts to}} raise {{awareness}} about trafficking during the reporting period. As part of its program against the worst forms of child labor, the Family Ministry conducted donor-funded workshops and roundtables in Mbour, Dakar, and {{other areas of the}} country {{to raise awareness}} about forced child begging, <b>child</b> domestic <b>servitude,</b> and prostitution of children. A magistrate at the High Commissary of Human Rights, the government’s focal point agency to combat trafficking, holds monthly meetings with representatives from the Ministries of Justice, Tourism, Interior, Women, and Education to better disseminate and enforce the law prohibiting trafficking. The government took measures to reduce demand for commercial sex acts in Senegal by activating a tourism police unit and a special police commissariat to combat child sex tourism. The government did not take measures to ensure that its nationals who are deployed abroad as part of peacekeeping missions do not engage in or facilitate trafficking. The Family Ministry is working with a foreign donor to develop a new national action plan against trafficking.|$|R

50|$|Around the {{new year}} 669, after Tang forces {{commanded}} by Li Ji had conquered Goguryeo in 668, Li Hong, noting the harshness of Emperor Gaozong's prior edict that conscripted soldiers who deserted would be beheaded and their wives and <b>children</b> forced into <b>servitude,</b> submitted a petition, in which {{he pointed out that}} at times the alleged deserters were in fact innocent—that they could have been ill, captured by Goguryeo forces without anyone realizing it, drowned while sailing {{on the way to the}} Goguryeo front, or been stuck behind Goguryeo lines. He requested that the penalty as to the alleged deserters' families be removed, and Emperor Gaozong agreed.|$|R

50|$|Government {{employees}} and domestic workers cannot join unions, but most others can. The government must be notified {{a month in}} advance of union meetings. The right to strike is subject to several conditions, one of them being that employers must be informed of planned strikes three weeks in advance. Collective bargaining is allowed. Forced labor is illegal, although some foreigners are apparently engaged in involuntary <b>servitude.</b> <b>Children</b> under 15 {{are not allowed to}} work, and there are limits on work by those under 18, although some children work in small family businesses. There is a low minimum wage that does not apply in a number of sectors, and there are various restrictions on working conditions that are not uniformly enforced. Occupational health and safety codes are generally enforced, however.|$|R
30|$|The {{essence of}} {{developing}} countries’ labor market problems is an insufficient number of “good jobs” {{for all who}} want to work in them and are capable of performing them. Workers in the poorer countries need to work, and so when no one else will hire them, they create their own earning opportunities, typically in very low-paying self-employment, which has been graphically termed “reluctant entrepreneurship” (Banerjee and Duflo, 2011). Consequently, the unemployment rates in the developing countries are lower than those in the developed countries. The poor work long hours but earn so little per hour that they are unable to move above the poverty line. Besides their low earnings, most have few job-related social protections. Too many are in indecent work: modern-day slavery, indentured <b>servitude,</b> <b>child</b> prostitution, and the like. Women face particular disadvantages in the labor market.|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} year, at least 700, 000, and {{possibly}} {{as many as}} four million men women and children worldwide were bought, sold, transported and held against their will in slave-like conditions. In this modern form of slavery, known as “trafficking in persons,” traffickers use threats, intimidation and violence to force victims to engage in sex acts or to labor under conditions comparable to slavery for the traffickers’ financial gain. Women, children and men are trafficked into the international sex trade for the purposes of prostitution, sex tourism and other commercial sexual services and into forced labor situations in sweatshops, construction sites and agricultural settings. The practice may take other forms as well, including the abduction of children and their conscription into government forces or rebel armies, the sale of women and <b>children</b> into domestic <b>servitude,</b> and the use of children as street beggars and camel jockeys...|$|R
50|$|The Government of Guinea did {{not show}} {{progress}} in its anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts during the reporting period. Guinea prohibits all forms of trafficking in persons through separate statutes. The Child Code of 2008 includes provisions prohibiting all forms of child trafficking, specifically criminalizing <b>child</b> domestic <b>servitude,</b> and allowing NGOs to bring cases to court on behalf of victims. The government, in partnership with NGOs and international organizations, has yet to complete the implementing text for this law, which will prescribe penalties that allow the law to be enforced. Article 337 of the 1998 Penal Code prohibits individuals from entering into agreements that deprive third parties of their liberty, prescribing penalties of five to 10 years’ imprisonment and confiscation of any resulting profits. Forced prostitution and child prostitution are criminalized by Article 329 of Guinea’s Penal Code, which prescribes six months’ to two years’ imprisonment if the trafficked victim is an adult, and two to five years’ imprisonment if the victim is a child. These penalties for sex trafficking of adults are neither sufficiently stringent nor commensurate with penalties prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. The government did not prosecute any human trafficking cases during the reporting period, although the Ministry of Justice reported that there were 13 new cases that involved the arrest of at least 40 suspected trafficking offenders during 2009. Of the alleged traffickers, 30 remain in detention. Another 17 trafficking cases from the previous reporting period continue to await prosecution. The government provided only limited specialized training to its officials on the recognition, investigation, and prosecution of human trafficking, due to budget constraints.|$|R

5000|$|... "The most {{important}} factor in the loss of Chiriguano independence was the reestablishment of the Franciscan missions" [...] beginning in 1845. After more than two centuries of failure, Christian missions enjoyed some success among the Chiriguanos. The reasons for this success seemed to be that many Chiriguanos turned to the missions for protection from internal disputes and conflict with the Creole ranchers and settlers, the Bolivian government, and other Indian peoples. The missions and the Bolivian government benefited from the labor of the mission Chiriguanos and also recruited many of them as soldiers against independent Chiriguanos and other Indians. The numbers and the independence of the Chiriguano also declined beginning in the 1850s when many of them began migrating to Argentina to work on sugar plantations. By the 1860s, the Bolivian government was taking a more aggressive stand against the Chiriguanos, awarding large grants of land to ranchers in their territory. Outright massacres of Chiriguanos became more common. Chiriguano fighters were routinely executed when captured and women and <b>children</b> sold into <b>servitude.</b>|$|R
40|$|Resumé The {{theme of}} my diploma thesis is The International Regulations of Trafficking in Women. Trafficking in people, {{especially}} with women is {{very old and}} unfortunately still actual phenomenon. Nowadays it is a fastest-growing form of criminal industry in the world. People are {{in the position of}} commodity that is trafficked. Universal human rights of victims and fundamental principles of democratic societies are breached, particularly the principle of protection of life, human integrity and dignity, personal freedom or the prohibition of slavery or forced labour. Trafficking in people is a complex process involving recruitment of victims, usually their transport (across the border or within the country) and finally exploitation (for the purpose of prostitution, forced labour, debt bondage, involuntary <b>servitude,</b> <b>children</b> adoption and so on). In the state of origin trafficking in people is caused by poverty, lack of political, social or economic stability, lack of reasonable prospects, situations of armed conflict, gender discrimination, lack of access to education and information, and in the state/region of destination it is caused by increasing demand for the cheap labourers or demand for sex workers. Traffickers focus on the most vulnerable group of people, that means in a most cases on women and [...] ...|$|R

50|$|Ecuador is a source, transit, and {{destination}} country for men, women, and children subjected to trafficking in persons, specifically forced prostitution and forced labor. The majority of trafficking victims {{are believed to}} be women and children trafficked within the country from border and central highland areas to urban centers for commercial sexual exploitation, as well as for involuntary domestic servitude, forced begging, and forced labor in mines and other hazardous work. There have also been reports of Ecuadorian children being forced to engage in criminal activity, such as drug trafficking and robbery. Parents sometimes send their children to neighboring countries in order to earn money, and Ecuadorian children are found in conditions of forced labor in Colombia, Venezuela, Chile, and the Dominican Republic, particularly as domestic servants, forced vendors, and beggars. Ecuadorian women are subjected to forced prostitution in Colombia, Peru, Venezuela, and Western Europe. To a lesser extent, Ecuador is a {{destination country}} for Colombian, Peruvian, and Chinese women and girls in forced prostitution. Indigenous Ecuadorians are vulnerable to forced labor in domestic <b>servitude.</b> <b>Child</b> sex tourism occurs mostly in urban areas, and in tourist destinations, such as Tena and the Galapagos Islands. Ecuador is a transit country for Chinese nationals smuggled to destinations elsewhere in the Western Hemisphere; some of these migrants are trafficked.|$|R
50|$|The South African {{government}} did not provide information on anti-trafficking investigations {{that resulted in the}} punishment of any traffickers in 2007. For the majority of the reporting period, South Africa did not have laws that specifically prohibited trafficking in persons, though a variety of other criminal statutes, such as the Prevention of Organized Crime Act, were used to prosecute trafficking crimes. Law enforcement authorities could also use existing laws prohibiting involuntary <b>servitude,</b> <b>child</b> labour, and forced labour to prosecute labour trafficking cases, but do not appear to have done so. The lack of specific anti-trafficking statutes and explicit penalties for trafficking crimes continued to hamper South African law enforcement efforts in 2007, as many working level police, labour, and social welfare officials possessed little understanding of the crime or did not view it as part of their responsibilities. However, in December 2007, several sections of the Sexual Offenses Amendment Act came into force, including Chapter 7 Part 6 which contains broad provisions against sex trafficking, but makes no provision for victim protection. Implementing regulations for the children's Act of 2005 remained unfinished, preventing use of the law’s provisions on child trafficking. The comment period on a draft comprehensive human trafficking bill closed in June 2007 and the South African Law Reform Commission (SALRC) staff finalized the text to be recommended to the Department of Justice in early 2008.|$|R
30|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss the latter and, more specifically, the {{modelling}} and use of this information as ‘weak signals’ that allude to the presence and/or emergence of criminality in citizen generated content, whilst using the formal definitions and doctrine that exists to underpin the framework and organisation of the model itself. Perhaps the most comprehensive list of indicators comes from the UNODC [18] who provide an extensive typology categorised by different types of exploitation such as; domestic <b>servitude,</b> <b>child</b> sexual exploitation, labour exploitation and begging/petty crime—the labels used in the taxonomy structure are outlined in Fig.  2. Using sexual exploitation as an example, indicators include things such as the appearance that persons are under the specific control of another, that the person(s) appear to own little clothing, or rely on their employer for basic amenities, transport and accommodation and more. The taxonomy excerpt included in Fig.  3 shows {{at a high level}} how a taxonomy node focused on attributes which may indicate an individual is vulnerable, or a potential victim of trafficking or exploitation, may contain specific rules designed to identify text which suggests they may have been subjected to violence, as one example of a weak-signal. Although in this form, these indicators are quite abstract and {{it can be difficult to}} see how they may manifest in real, open-source, data—it is possible to develop rules looking for keywords and phrases that can provide ‘weak-signals’ of their existence online.|$|R
50|$|Niger is a source, transit, and {{destination}} country {{for children and}} women subjected to trafficking in persons, specifically forced labor and forced prostitution. Caste-based slavery practices, rooted in ancestral master-slave relationships, continue primarily {{in the northern part}} of the country. Children are trafficked within Niger for forced begging by religious instructors known as marabouts; forced labor in gold mines, agriculture, and stone quarries; as well as for involuntary domestic servitude and forced prostitution. The ILO estimates at least 10,000 children work in gold mines in Niger, many of whom may be forced to work. Nigerien children, primarily girls, are also subjected to commercial sexual exploitation along the border with Nigeria, particularly in the towns of Birni N’Konni and Zinder along the main highway, and boys are trafficked to Nigeria and Mali for forced begging and manual labor. There were reports Nigerien girls entered into “false marriages” with citizens of Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates: upon arrival in these countries, the girls are often forced into involuntary domestic <b>servitude.</b> <b>Child</b> marriage was a problem, especially in rural areas, and may have contributed to conditions of human trafficking. Niger is a transit country for women and children from Benin, Burkina Faso, Gabon, Ghana, Mali, Nigeria, and Togo en route to Northern Africa and Western Europe; some may be subjected to forced labor in Niger as domestic servants, forced laborers in mines and on farms, and as mechanics and welders. To a lesser extent, Nigerien women and children are trafficked from Niger to North Africa, the Middle East, and Europe for involuntary domestic servitude and forced commercial sexual exploitation.|$|R
