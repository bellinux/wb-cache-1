50|$|Another type of {{watermark}} {{is called}} the <b>cylinder</b> <b>mould</b> watermark. It is a shaded watermark first used in 1848 that incorporates tonal depth and creates a greyscale image. Instead of using a wire covering for the dandy roll, the shaded watermark is created by areas of relief on the roll's own surface. Once dry, the paper may then be rolled again to produce a watermark of even thickness but with varying density. The resulting watermark is generally much clearer and more detailed than those made by the Dandy Roll process, <b>and</b> as such <b>Cylinder</b> <b>Mould</b> Watermark Paper is the preferred type of watermarked paper for banknotes, passports, motor vehicle titles, and other documents where {{it is an important}} anti-counterfeiting measure.|$|R
2500|$|Another type {{of paper}} machine {{makes use of}} a <b>cylinder</b> <b>mould</b> that rotates while {{partially}} immersed in a vat of dilute pulp. The pulp is {{picked up by the}} wire <b>and</b> covers the <b>mould</b> as it rises out of the vat. A couch roller is pressed against the mould to smooth out the pulp, and picks the wet sheet off the mould.|$|R

The <b>cylinder</b> <b>mould</b> {{was obtained from the}} Bennett Brook Railway in Australia, where another replica Annie had been built. The two replicas are both 2' (610mm) gauge whereas the original Annie was built to run on 2' 6" [...] (762mm) gauge tracks.|$|R
50|$|A {{watermark}} is an identifying {{image or}} pattern in paper that appears as various shades of lightness/darkness when viewed {{by transmitted light}} (or when viewed by reflected light, atop a dark background), caused by thickness or density variations in the paper.Watermarks have been used on postage stamps, currency, and other government documents to discourage counterfeiting. There are two main ways of producing watermarks in paper; the dandy roll process, and the more complex <b>cylinder</b> <b>mould</b> process.|$|R
50|$|Another type {{forming section}} is the <b>cylinder</b> <b>mould</b> machine using a mesh-covered {{rotating}} cylinder partially {{immersed in a}} tank of fibre slurry in the wet end to form a paper web, giving a more random distribution of the cellulose fibres. Cylinder machines can form a sheet at higher consistency, which gives a more three dimensional fibre orientation than lower consistencies, resulting in higher calliper (thickness) and more stiffness in the machine direction (MD). High MD stiffness is useful in food packaging like cereal boxes and other boxes like dry laundry detergent.|$|R

40|$|The {{footwear}} insoles and heel counter stiffeners {{are made}} using fibrous structure materials. The spatial forming of these parts {{is made in}} moulds. After forming, the parts must have the same spatial dimensions {{with those of the}} shoe lasts used in the footwear manufacturing. During the forming process, the fibrous structure materials have an elastic-plastic behavior. So, for the moulds dimensioning, {{it is important to know}} the percentage of plastic deformation from the total deformation of the stressed material; this means to know the value of these materials forming subscript. The paper presents some theoretical and experimental contributions in finding of the forming subscript of the materials used in the footwear industry, for the footwear insoles and heel counter stiffeners manufacturing. Experiments were made on installations <b>and</b> experimental <b>moulds</b> sphere, <b>cylinder</b> <b>and</b> central angle. Experimental results shows that the forming subscript depends on the <b>mould</b> shape <b>and</b> the sample humidity when the stress is cancel. So, the deformations have a high rate, the sphere surfaces having the, highest forming subscript. In the case of sample forming which use <b>cylinder</b> <b>moulds</b> the value of the forming subscript on these surfaces is the lowest. In the case of the center angle occurs a a high level of plastic deformation. The results will be applied at the designing of the insoles and heel counter stiffeners moulds used for the pre-moulding...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND & AIMS: Obesity is {{a leading}} {{healthcare}} issue contributing to metabolic diseases. There is {{a great interest in}} non-invasive approaches for quantitating abdominal fat in obese animals and humans. In this work, we propose an automated method to distinguish and quantify subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissues (SAT <b>and</b> <b>VAT)</b> in rodents during obesity and weight loss interventions. We have also investigated the influence of different magnetic resonance sequences and sources of variability in quantification of fat depots. MATERIALS AND METHODS: High-fat diet fed rodents were utilized for investigating the changes during obesity, exercise, and calorie restriction interventions (N =  7 /cohort). Imaging was performed on a 7 T Bruker ClinScan scanner using fast spin echo (FSE) and Dixon imaging methods to estimate the fat depots. Finally, we quantified the SAT <b>and</b> <b>VAT</b> volumes between the L 1 -L 5 lumbar vertebrae using the proposed automatic hybrid geodesic region-based curve evolution algorithm. RESULTS: Significant changes in SAT <b>and</b> <b>VAT</b> volumes (p< 0. 01) were observed between the pre- and post-intervention measurements. The SAT <b>and</b> <b>VAT</b> were 44. 22 ± 9 %, 21. 06 ± 1. 35 % for control, - 17. 33 ± 3. 07 %, - 15. 09 ± 1. 11 % for exercise, and 18. 56 ± 2. 05 %, - 3. 9 ± 0. 96 % for calorie restriction cohorts, respectively. The fat quantification correlation between FSE (with and without water suppression) sequences and Dixon for SAT <b>and</b> <b>VAT</b> were 0. 9709, 0. 9803 and 0. 9955, 0. 9840 respectively. The algorithm significantly reduced the computation time from 100 sec/slice to 25 sec/slice. The pre-processing, data-derived contour placement and avoidance of strong background-image boundary improved the convergence accuracy of the proposed algorithm. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a fully automatic segmentation algorithm to quantitate SAT <b>and</b> <b>VAT</b> from abdominal images of rodents, which can support large cohort studies. We additionally identified the influence of non-algorithmic variables including cradle disturbance, animal positioning, and MR sequence on the fat quantification. There were no large variations between FSE and Dixon-based estimation of SAT <b>and</b> <b>VAT...</b>|$|R

40|$|International audienceAim The aim of {{this study}} was to assess {{interactions}} between glucose and iron homoeostasis in the adipose tissue (AT) of obese subjects. Methods A total of 46 obese patients eligible for bariatric surgery were recruited into the study. Anthropometric and biochemical characteristics were assessed, and biopsies of subcutaneous (SCAT) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) performed. The mRNA levels of genes involved in iron and glucose homoeostasis were measured in their AT and compared with a pool of control samples. Results Gene expression of hepcidin (HAMP) was significantly increased in the SCAT <b>and</b> <b>VAT</b> of obese patients, while transferrin receptor (TFRC) expression was reduced, compared with non-obese controls, suggesting a higher iron load in obese patients. Also, mRNA levels of adiponectin (ADIPOQ) were decreased in both SCAT <b>and</b> <b>VAT</b> in obese patients, and correlated negatively with hepcidin expression, while adiponectin expression was positively correlated with TFRC expression in both SCAT <b>and</b> <b>VAT.</b> Interestingly, TFRC expression in VAT correlated negatively with several metabolic parameters, such as fasting blood glucose and LDL cholesterol. Conclusion Iron content appears to be increased in the SCAT <b>and</b> <b>VAT</b> of obese patients, and negatively correlated with adiponectin expression, which could be contributing to insulin resistance and the metabolic complications of obesit...|$|R
