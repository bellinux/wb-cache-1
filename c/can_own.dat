25|$|There are {{differences}} between Islamic and Western legal systems. For example, sharia classically recognizes only natural persons, and never developed {{the concept of}} a legal person, or corporation, i.e., a legal entity that limits the liabilities of its managers, shareholders, and employees; exists beyond the lifetimes of its founders; and that <b>can</b> <b>own</b> assets, sign contracts, and appear in court through representatives. Interest prohibitions imposed secondary costs by discouraging record keeping and delaying the introduction of modern accounting. Such factors, according to Timur Kuran, have {{played a significant role in}} retarding economic development in the Middle East.|$|E
25|$|Characters on {{reaching}} Level 15 {{can purchase}} {{a house in}} instanced neighborhoods. Neighbourhoods and houses have different themes depending on setting (there are four settings: Man, Elf, Dwarf, Hobbit). Decorations/furniture may be purchased or acquired as rewards in certain in-game activities such as quests, deeds or festivals. The items are displayed via item hooks and may be either cosmetic or functional. Houses come in three different sizes and include chests for additional player storage. Houses require weekly maintenance rent (using in-game currency) with houses locked on failure to pay upkeep. The largest size house is reserved for kinships (player guilds). Players <b>can</b> <b>own</b> one personal house per server, and restrict the level of access to himself only, kinship members, or make it publicly accessible.|$|E
25|$|The {{husband is}} financially {{responsible}} for the welfare and maintenance of his wife or wives and any children they produce, to include at a minimum, providing a home, food and clothing. In return, {{it is the duty}} of the wife to safeguard the husband's possessions and protect how wealth is spent. If the wife has wealth in her own capacity she is not obliged to spend it upon the husband or children, as she <b>can</b> <b>own</b> property and assets in her own right, so the husband has no right for her property and assets except by her will. A pre-marital agreement of the financial expectation from the husband is in the mahr, given by him to the wife for her exclusive use, which is included as part of his financial responsibility.|$|E

25|$|Factories are {{stations}} {{which use}} resources {{to create one}} or many products. The needed resources and produced wares need to be transported by a ship. Traders in the universe must move wares between the factories to keep production going; if supply exceeds demand a factory will often stop producing goods. The player can build factories by buying them at a shipyard and loading them on board a large transport ship (TL class). The player factories <b>can</b> <b>own</b> their own ships to buy resources and sell products. There are many factory options to configure the trader ships behaviour and job. Player factories can also connect to each other to share resources and products. The factories are connected through tubes and the docking bay is moved to a central complex hub.|$|E
500|$|Insomniac Games {{focuses on}} {{maintaining}} its independence. Despite working solely for Sony Interactive Entertainment for decades, {{it has never}} been part of SIE Worldwide Studios. The studio partnered with Sony because Sony helped market Insomniac's games. The company's team found being controlled by publishers frustrating. According to Price, working with Sony is an [...] "autonomous" [...] process; Sony can provide input into the development of games but Insomniac has complete control of them. Insomniac later decided to produce games for platforms other than Sony's PlayStation series so it <b>can</b> <b>own</b> the rights to its franchises and establish its own brand identity.|$|E
500|$|Johnson opposes {{federal and}} state gun control {{legislation}}, saying: [...] "I'm {{a firm believer in}} the Second Amendment and so I would not have signed legislation banning assault weapons or automatic weapons." [...] Johnson says that the Second Amendment [...] "was designed to protect us against a government that could be very intrusive. And in this country, we have a growing police state - if people <b>can</b> <b>own</b> assault rifles or automatic rifles, I think leads to a more civil government." [...] Johnson would, however, limit weapons such as rocket launchers. Johnson believes that allowing concealed carrying of guns reduces crime and gun violence. He opposes barring gun sales to individuals on the no-fly list, because he claims that such lists have a high error rate. Johnson has called for a [...] "thousand-person taskforce" [...] or [...] "hot line" [...] to prevent terrorists from obtaining guns, and has questioned why the perpetrator of the Orlando nightclub shooting was not [...] "deprived of his guns" [...] after being interviewed three times.|$|E

The Internet to him {{is more than a}} computer network. It is a place that he called an [...] "electronic frontier." [...] "He frequently wrote in language that echoed Henry Morton Stanley's African diary. ‘Imagine discovering a continent so vast that it may have no end to its dimensions. Imagine a new world with more resources than all our future greed might exhaust, more opportunities than there will ever be entrepreneurs enough to exploit, and a peculiar kind of real estate that expands with development. Imagine a place where trespassers leave no footprints, where goods can be stolen infinite number of times and yet remain in the possession of their original owners, where business you never heard of <b>can</b> <b>own</b> the history of your personal affairs.’" [...] He wanted to encourage and provoke youngsters to explore the cyberspace through his writing.|$|E

2500|$|All nine {{laws have}} similar content. [...] They all {{restrict}} corporate ability {{to own and}} operate on farmland. [...] They all outline exceptions for specific types of corporations. Generally, family farm corporations are exempted, although certain conditions {{may have to be}} fulfilled for such exemption (e.g. one or more of: shareholders within a specified degree of kinship owning a majority of voting stock, no shareholders other than natural persons, limited number of shareholders, at least one family member residing on the farm). However, the laws vary significantly in how they define a corporate farm, and in the specific restrictions. [...] Definitions of a farm can include any and all farm operations, or be dependent on the source of income, as in Iowa, where 60 percent of income must come from farm products. [...] Additionally, these laws can target a corporation's use of the land, meaning that companies <b>can</b> <b>own</b> but not farm the land, or they may outright prohibit corporations from buying and owning farmland. [...] The precise wording of these laws has significant impact on how corporations can participate in agriculture in these states with the ultimate goal of protecting and empowering the family farm.|$|E
