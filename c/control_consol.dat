50|$|Meanwhile, the C3I system {{associated}} with HQ-61B was also making {{slow but steady}} progress. In addition to extra temperature and salinity factors, noise and stability were also challenges of ship-based system, while the space is cramped on board. As a result, developer was forced to adopt new technologies and new means, {{many of them were}} first in China. A mono-pulse centimeter wavelength tracking radar was developed for HQ-61B for surveillance / tracking, while a continuous-wave centimeter wavelength illuminating radar was developed for HQ-61B for engagement. Fire control computer of HQ-61B was a newly designed digital computer, incorporating analog - digital and digital - analog conversions. The launching system was hydraulically operated with twin launchers, connecting to ammunition drum below, where additional missile were stored vertically. The <b>control</b> <b>consol</b> of HQ-61B also performs maintenance tests / checks on missiles mounted on the launcher.|$|E
40|$|North American {{railroad}} locomotive operators (engineers and conductors) {{are exposed}} to multi-axis vibration and shocks (1, 2). A recent epidemiological survey showed a prevalence of serious type of neck and lower back disorders nearly double that of a control group (3). Ergonomic working conditions are important co-factors in a vibration and shock exposure risk assessment (4, 5). The goal {{of this study is}} to illustrate typical work stations (cabs and seats) in US/Canadian type locomotives and assess shock related exposure risk by calculations of the new proposed shock risk indicators according to the new ISO 2631 - 5 (2004) (6). Methods Locomotive cab and seat inspections were conducted and operators activities were assessed by a trained observer. Field measurements (n= 50) were obtained during normal revue service following generally accepted guidelines (ISO 2631 (1)). A sub-sample of n= 20 locomotives were selected for the calculation of proposed shock indicators (ISO 2631 (5)). Results There has been little change in basic locomotive cab and seat design in the U. S [...] Two locomotive cab design concepts are used: the Association of American Railroad (AAR) Control Stand and in newer series wide-body locomotives the <b>Control</b> <b>Consol</b> (Figures 1 - 2), with varying seating conditions, but frequently subjecting the operator to an awkward body posture in addition to the vibration and shock exposure.

50|$|Trained {{in civil}} engineering, Treffry {{built a new}} quay in Fowey to take larger vessels for the export of tin, the major {{industry}} of Cornwall. As a result, he became {{a partner in the}} Wheal Regent copper mine at Crinnis near Par. He then became a partner in Fowey Consols mine at Tywardreath and manager of Lanscroft mine. After he amalgamated the two mines in 1822 and took full <b>control,</b> Fowey <b>Consols</b> became the most productive mine in Cornwall and employed 1,680 workers.|$|R
