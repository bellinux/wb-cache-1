40|$|Why do many {{professional}} football {{clubs in the}} German Bundesliga face financial problems, {{and what is the}} best strategy to improve their <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> <b>financing?</b> In this thesis, the author posits that the contractual arrangement and success in financial relationship are not solely due to its appropriate design, but also rely on the design of financially relevant contracts (player contracts, club management contracts). Financial contracts and financially relevant contracts are both closely linked to the organizational design of club and league contracts. When these contracts are incomplete, football players and club managers are likely to behave opportunistically, and financial investors will be reluctant to provide funds. Contract incompleteness further gives the club management incentives and opportunities to spend more on players, resulting in reduced retained earnings. For a critical analysis of the financial problems of football clubs it is, therefore, necessary to discuss the characteristics of an investment in players and to analyze the peculiarities and deficiencies of the complex nexus of club and league contracts. In addition, the financial and organizational concepts of England?s {{professional football}} clubs and of US sport leagues are analyzed and a possible institutional transfer to the German Bundesliga is examined. The theoretical framework in this thesis mainly consists of the New Institutional Economics, the Economics of Sports and further approaches (e. g. Economics of Nonprofit Organizations). The empirical approaches inter alia include interviews with football club managers...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the conditions of}} private equity and venture capital financing in the Czech Republic and Poland. Especially the related legislation, taxes and support {{of this type of}} financing are discussed in detail. The purpose of this research is to evaluate the conditions, to find factors that have positive influence and to formulate recommendations that would improve the <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> both PE/VC investors and firms with new business ideas. Improving the <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> PE/VC <b>financing</b> helps small businesses get the needed capital that cannot be obtained from banks and other institutions. This form of financing has a proven positive effect on whole economy. Identifying and removing obstacles is therefore important and helps the government to promote economic growth. This form of financing is used frequently in other European countries. In the central and eastern Europe it is not used as frequently but the situation is improving according to (Zinecker & Rajchlová, 2010).

40|$|The {{crises of}} the housing and the {{financial}} sector in the US and the turmoil on worldwide financial markets have clouded the prospects {{of the world economy}} for this and next year. In particular, <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> <b>financing</b> consumption and investment will worsen. In addition, the price hikes for energy and food entail a redistribution of purchasing power from ordinary households to the producers of these goods. As a consequence of all this, the economy in the US will be more or less stagnating this year, and world growth will slow down. Firms in the nonfinancial sector, however, are generally in good financial condition, policy in the US takes strong measures to contain the crisis, and growth dynamics in emerging markets economies appear to be robust enough to withstand the dampening effects. In Germany, the economy is, in spite of the adverse effects from abroad and in particular the strong appreciation of the euro, still in good shape. Apparently, the economy has become more robust in the past years, partly due to increased competitiveness of German producers. Still, economic expansion will slow down, with annual growth rates of 1. 8 % for this year and 1. 4 % for 2009. For the first time the forecast of the institutes comprises a medium term projection. For this, the potential growth rate of the German Economy is estimated to be 1. 6 %. As to policy recommendations, the institutes advise against the establishment of minimum wages in Germany, because they fear adverse effects for employment.

40|$|PPurpose – This paper {{seeks to}} {{identify}} factors potentially conditioning firms’ financial internationalization. Companies often internationalize their financial areas {{as part of}} their larger internationalization strategy. In other words, such an initiative is associated with the internationalization of non-financial business areas. However, the move to financial internationalization may also obey a specific strategy designed {{to take advantage of the}} opportunities offered by increasingly global financial milieus and markets. Then again, of course, it may respond to a combination of the two, in which case all the factors mentioned are likely to exercise some influence. Design/methodology/approach – To test these propositions, a sample of 461 firms located in the Basque Country (Northern Spain), were analyzed between 16 June and 13 July 2004. Primary data were collected by telephone surveys, with a specially designed questionnaire tested previously with a number of pilot businesses. The sample represents a confidence level of 95 percent and 4. 25 percent as a maximum level of error. This sample was divided by company size and the sector each business worked in, maintaining, approximately, proportionality in each stratum with respect to the population. Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests and logit analysis were used, among others. Findings – Companies most likely to go into debt abroad are larger and more internationalized commercially and in production. First are large exporting companies with one or more production facilities abroad (PFA), which are followed by: medium enterprises that export and which have at least one PFA and large companies that export but which have no PFA. The profile of firms with foreign shareholders begins with manufacturing companies that import, followed by commercial businesses that also import. One interesting feature is the low number of companies in the construction industry and the services sector, particularly the ones that neither export nor import. Research limitations/implications – A sample of 461 firms located in the Basque Country (Northern Spain) were analyzed and thus the sample might be geographically limited. Also, the degree of financial internationalization of these firms is relatively low. A sample which covers a greater amount of financially internationalized firms, might have led to more solid conclusions. Practical implications – The most noteworthy practical implication of the paper is the confirmation that Basque firms still do not clearly perceive opportunities for financial internationalization. The barriers and risks to be faced beyond geographical borders weigh heavily. In other words, the threats companies are exposed to outweigh potential opportunities in international markets, or the <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> <b>financing</b> and domestic financial investment available are in general more favourable than the conditions obtainable abroad. Originality/value – Within the Basque firms, even if the commercial, supply and production internationalization has been analyzed at length, the financial internationalization has not. Moreover, the profiles of financially internationalized firms have not been analyzed previously on the basis of a different sample.

In the post 2008 period, a key policy agenda is that of sustainable development, which calls for innovation in all aspects of value-chains. In this paper, we focus on innovation from the biotech—pharma perspective to see whether or not this will lead to a sustainable future for the regions where there are clusters of firms in this sector. We examine data from a recently completed European Union study of innovation in the Healthcare sector from the UK and Switzerland, countries with an historical base in pharma, to understand how innovation pathways vary at the regional level in the broader life sciences, which incorporate biotech and more. Innovation in the healthcare sector in two regions, Oxfordshire in the UK and Zurich in Switzerland are compared.

Reli-able estimation of the likelihood of a company’s bankruptcy reduces risk, not only for the company itself but also for all co-operating companies and financial institutions. The financial crisis has led to a tightening up of the <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> gaining <b>finance</b> from banks. However, it is not only the evalua-tion of PD itself that is so important but also the correct classification of companies according to their PD level (“good ” or “bad ” companies). There is very little consideration about possible adjustments of the credit risk scale, as usually the American scale is adopted with no changes which seems incor-rect. This paper stresses the importance of correct calibration of the credit rating scale. It should not be assumed (as it was in the past) that once a scale is defined it remains fixed and independent of the country. Therefore, the research carried out on Polish companies shows that the credit rating scale should be changed and the default point (i. e. “cut-off ” point) should be higher than in the past. The author uses a modified classification matrix based on the probability of default. The paper compares the classification of quoted Polish companies according to their credit risk level (PD) with the actual occurrence of default when various default “cut-off ” points are used.
