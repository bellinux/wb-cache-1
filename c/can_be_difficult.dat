5|$|In children, {{particularly}} those younger {{than six years}} old, the diagnosis <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> and the condition is often initially mistaken (sometimes {{for up to two}} weeks) for other causes of pains and difficulty walking, such as viral infections, or bone and joint problems.|$|E
5|$|Pneumonia is {{typically}} diagnosed {{based on a}} combination of physical signs and a chest X-ray. However, the underlying cause <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> to confirm, as there is no definitive test able to distinguish between bacterial and non-bacterial origin.|$|E
5|$|Since Norfolk {{serves as}} the {{commercial}} and cultural center for the unusual geographical region of Hampton Roads (and in its political structure of independent cities), it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> to separate the economic characteristics of Norfolk {{from that of the}} region as a whole.|$|E

5|$|The song {{differs from}} that of the Iberian chiffchaff, which has a shorter djup djup djup wheep wheep chittichittichiittichitta. However, mixed singers occur in the {{hybridisation}} zone and elsewhere, and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> to allocate to species.|$|E
5|$|A cheap, {{cost-effective}} {{and practical}} alternative in poorer countries is visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA). Instituting and sustaining cytology-based programs {{in these regions}} <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult,</b> due {{to the need for}} trained personnel, equipment and facilities and difficulties in follow-up. With VIA, results and treatment can be available on the same day. As a screening test, VIA is comparable to cervical cytology in accurately identifying precancerous lesions.|$|E
50|$|Currently, it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> legally <b>difficult</b> {{to have a}} {{transnational}} marriage. There {{are many}} barriers, for example in Indonesia it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> very <b>difficult</b> for the married couple if the husband is not Indonesian. As a result of increasing transnational marriage, policy makers in various countries are starting to consider whether they should discourage or encourage transnational marriage.|$|R

5|$|Birt–Hogg–Dubé <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> to {{diagnose}} from symptoms alone, because hereditary renal cancers, pneumothorax, and cutaneous tumors occur with other syndromes. Hereditary bilateral, multifocal kidney tumors {{similar to those}} seen in BHDcan occur with von Hippel–Lindau disease (clear cell renal cell carcinoma), hereditary papillary renal cancer (papillary renal cell carcinoma), and hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer syndrome. They are differentiated with examination of the tumors' histology.|$|E
5|$|Diagnosis of a {{pneumothorax}} {{by physical}} examination alone <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> (particularly in smaller pneumothoraces). A chest X-ray, computed tomography (CT) scan, or ultrasound is usually used to confirm its presence. Other conditions {{that can result}} in similar symptoms include a hemothorax (buildup {{of blood in the}} pleural space), pulmonary embolism, and heart attack. A large bullae may look similar on a chest X-ray.|$|E
5|$|Histologically, cholangiocarcinomas {{may vary}} from {{undifferentiated}} to well-differentiated. They are often {{surrounded by a}} brisk fibrotic or desmoplastic tissue response; {{in the presence of}} extensive fibrosis, it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> to distinguish well-differentiated cholangiocarcinoma from normal reactive epithelium. There is no entirely specific immunohistochemical stain that can distinguish malignant from benign biliary ductal tissue, although staining for cytokeratins, carcinoembryonic antigen, and mucins may aid in diagnosis. Most tumors (>90%) are adenocarcinomas.|$|E

5|$|In {{the matter}} of Alvarado's age, Breyer {{found that it was}} {{relevant}} to the custody analysis. Further, Breyer held that nothing in the law prevents a judge from including age in the custody analysis. Breyer called the discussion of experience with law enforcement misleading; while experience with law enforcement <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> to determine, Breyer noted that Alvarado's age was a known objective fact.|$|E
5|$|Millepora alcicornis has no {{commercial}} uses but {{is sometimes}} kept in reef aquaria. It requires high water movement and bright light to flourish and its health can {{be judged by}} its colour, a yellow hue showing health whereas a darker brown colour can indicate too little light. It <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> to control because it grows fast and spreads over other objects in the tank.|$|E
5|$|Palatography {{involves}} {{the painting of}} a colored substance onto the tongue which is then transferred onto the palate during articulation. A picture is then taken of the palate to record the location of contact and, if another palatogram is to be taken, the mouth is washed out and the tongue repainted. A particularly low cost method that is often used in fieldwork, it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> to collect large amounts of data.|$|E

5|$|Propagation is by seed, {{though these}} <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> to extract from the follicles. Seeds {{do not require}} any {{treatment}} before sowing, and take 12 to 48 days to germinate. Cultivars require propagation by cutting for progeny to grow true. Cuttings are slow to strike. Attempts to graft B.coccinea have met with little success.|$|E
5|$|Testing the {{validity}} of astrology <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult,</b> {{because there is no}} consensus amongst astrologers as to what astrology is or what it can predict. Most professional astrologers are paid to predict the future or describe a person's personality and life, but most horoscopes only make vague untestable statements that can apply to almost anyone.|$|E
5|$|The highest notes {{can have}} a shrill, {{piercing}} quality and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> to tune accurately.

5|$|Thelephora palmata is an ectomycorrhizal species, forming mutualistic {{associations}} with conifers. Fruit bodies grow singly, scattered, or in {{groups on the}} ground in both coniferous and mixed forest and grassy fields. A preference has been noted for moist ground, and locations along woodland paths. An uncommon species, fruit bodies <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> to see because they blend well into their surroundings.|$|E
5|$|A {{station model}} is a {{symbolic}} illustration showing the weather occurring at a given reporting station. Meteorologists created the station model to plot a number of weather elements in a small space on weather maps. Maps filled with dense station-model plots <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> to read, but they allow meteorologists, pilots, and mariners to see important weather patterns. A computer draws a station model for each observation location. The station model is primarily used on surface-weather maps, but {{can also be used}} to show the weather aloft. A completed station-model map allows users to analyze patterns in air pressure, temperature, wind, cloud cover, and precipitation.|$|E
5|$|Beagles are {{intelligent}} but, as {{a result}} of being bred for the long chase, are single-minded and determined, which can make them hard to train. They <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> to recall once they have picked up a scent, and are easily distracted by smells around them. They do not generally feature in obedience trials; while they are alert, respond well to food-reward training, and are eager to please, they are easily bored or distracted. They are ranked 72nd in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs, as Coren places them among the group with the lowest degree of working/obedience intelligence. Coren's scale, however, does not assess understanding, independence, or creativity.|$|E
