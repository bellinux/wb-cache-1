Direct Sequence Spread spectrum (DSSS) is the method whereby the data transmitted by the satellite and received by user is kept secure, low power and relatively noise-immune. The first step required in the GPS operation is to perform a lock on the incoming signal, both with respect to time synchronization and frequency resolution. Because {{of the need for}} reduced time to lock and also reduced hardware, algorithms based in the frequency domain have been developed. These algorithms take advantage of the time to frequency matrix operation known as the fast Fourier transform or FFT.

Those algorithms were then used together with time based positioning methods in order to see how timing errors affects the positioning precision. Timing and positioning accuracy were evaluated as functions of the signal-to-noise ratio and the length of the channel impulse response. Since a hardware implementation of the positioning system would include advanced analog circuitry, only simulations in MATLAB were done. he results show that the time estimation errors approaches the asymptotic performance limit already at negative SNR's, something that is of great importance since UWB radios transmits below the noise floor.

A simple and economic scheme for <b>coarse</b> code <b>acquisition</b> of Reverse Link for UMTS (FDD-WCDMA) application is presented. The {{emphasis is on the}} performance of a new scheme (using a Surface Acoustic Wave Matched Filter) as a term of probability of false detection (pf) in code division multiple access (CDMA) systems. Knowledge of initial code uncertainty phases help to reduce the overhead of preamble on the access channel and a very simple scheme for acquisition to be determined. In the reverse link this uncertainty is due to the cell radius only. Acquisition time required for a simple serial search scheme may therefore be unacceptably large. On the other hand, for parallel acquisition using parallel branches in accordance with the chip uncertainty time region leads to a lot of hardware complexity. Initially, the effect of multiple access interference and spreading sequence length are determined for models applicable to the reverse link of a mobile communications system. Then the acquisition performance is derived using a model of a cellular mobile communication channel, which includes the effects of multiple access interference, adjacent cell interference, frequency selective Rician channel, shadowing, power control error, and vehicle speed. It is shown that the most significant factors in determining the acquisition performance are the acquisition observation interval, the number of users, and the specular to diffuse power ratio.

40|$|In this {{research}} study, several new algorithms are developed to achieve spacecraft attitude determination from carrier phase information of GPS (Global Positioning System) signals. The first {{focus is on}} resolving integer ambiguity in carrier phase difference measurements. A newly developed algorithm based on Gram-Schmidt Orthonormalisation (GSO) is proposed for medium length baseline observations. Using this newly developed attitude algorithm from vector observations, an instantaneous estimated attitude solution is obtained, which we call 'coarse attitude', from only four phase measurements collected from only two baseline observations. Then a 'fine' attitude solution from all phase measurements is estimated, using a sophisticated Kalman filtering estimator, once integer ambiguity has been resolved. The second focus is on estimating the relative phase offset error (line bias) in carrier phase difference measurements. A newly developed block bias search is proposed which finds an initially plausible solution of line bias for each individual baseline. The line bias from all phase measurements collected from each individual baseline is then re-estimated using a developed recursive least squares (RLS) estimator. A newly developed parallel architecture GPS receiver is being flown on the UoSat- 12 minisatellite, with the capability for simultaneous measurements from 24 channels for attitude sensing.

40|$|The Triaxial Magnetic Moment Analysis {{software}} uses measured {{magnetic field}} test data to compute dipole and quadrupole moment {{information from a}} hardware element. It is used to support JPL projects needing magnetic control {{and an understanding of}} the spacecraft-generated magnetic fields. Evaluation of the magnetic moment of an object consists of three steps: acquisition, conditioning, and analysis. This version of existing software was extensively rewritten for easier data acquisition, data analysis, and report presentation, including immediate feedback to the test operator during data acquisition. While prior JPL computer codes provided the same data content, this program has a better graphic display including original data overlaid with reconstructed results to show goodness of fit accuracy and better appearance of the report graphic page. Data are acquired using three magnetometers and two rotations of the device under test. A clean acquisition user interface presents required numeric data and graphic summaries, and the analysis module yields the best fit (least squares) for the magnetic dipole and/or quadrupole moment of a device. The acquisition module allows the user to record multiple data sets, selecting the best data to analyze, and is repeated three times for each of the z-axial and y-axial rotations. In this update, the y-axial rotation starting position has been changed to an option, allowing either the x- or z-axis to point towards the magnetometer. The code has been rewritten to use three simultaneous axes of magnetic data (three probes), now using two "rotations" of the device under test rather than the previous three rotations, thus reducing handling activities on the device under test. The present version of the software gathers data in one-degree increments, which permits much better accuracy of the fit ted data than the <b>coarser</b> data <b>acquisition</b> of the prior software. The data-conditioning module provides a clean data set for the analysis module. For multiple measurements at a given degree, the first measurement is used. For omitted measurements, the missing field is estimated by linear interpolation between the two nearest measurements. The analysis module was rewritten for the dual rotation, triaxial probe measurement process and now has better moment estimation accuracy, based on the finer one degree of data acquisition resolution. The magnetic moments thus computed are used as an input to summarize the total spacecraft field...|$|R
40|$|Spread Spectrum (SS) communication, {{initially}} {{designed for}} military applications, {{is now the}} basis for many of today's advanced communications systems such as Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), Global Positioning System (GPS), Wireless Local Loop (WLL), etc. For effective communication {{to take place in}} systems using SS modulation, the Pseudo-random Noise (PN) code used at the receiver to despread the received signal must be identical and be synchronised with the PN code that was used to spread the signal at the transmitter. Synchronisation is done in two steps: <b>coarse</b> synchronisation or <b>acquisition,</b> and fine synchronisation or tracking. Acquisition involves obtaining a coarse estimate of the phase shift between the transmitted PN code and that at the receiver so that the received PN code will be aligned or synchronised with the locally generated PN code. After acquisition, tracldng is now done which involves maintaining the alignment of the two PN codes. This thesis presents results of the research calTied out on a proposed adaptive PN code acquisition circuit designed to improve the synchronisation process in Direct Sequence CDMA (DS-CDMA) systems. The acquisition circuit is implemented using a Matched Filter (MF) for the correlation operation and the threshold setting device is an adaptive processor known as the Cell Averaging Constant False Alarm Rate (CA-CFAR) processor. It is a double dwell acquisition circuit where the second dwell is implemented by Post Detection Integration (PDI). Depending on the application, PDI can be used to mitigate the effect of frequency offset in non-coherent detectors and/or in the implementation of multiple dwell acquisition systems. Equations relating the performance measures - the probability of false alarm (Pra), the probability of detection (P d) and the mean acquisition time (E {Tacq}) - of the circuit are deri ved. Monte Carlo simulation was used for the independent validation of the theoretical results obtained, and the strong agreement between these results shows the accuracy of the derived equations for the proposed circuit. Due to the combination of PDI and CA-CFAR processor in the implementation of the circuit, results obtained show that it can provide a good measure of robustness to frequency offset and noise power variations in mobile environment, consequently leading to improved acquisition time performance. The complete synchronisation circuit is realised by using this circuit in conjunction with a conventional code tracking circuit. Therefore, a study of a Non-coherent Delay-Locked Loop (NDLL) code tracking circuit is also calTied out. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
