60|$|The {{waitress}} {{brought him}} his {{glass of milk}} and a <b>cheese-cake.</b> He ate it in silence, while his piece of string lay idly {{beside him on the}} table. When he had finished he fumbled in his capacious pockets, and drew out the inevitable pocket-book.|$|E
6000|$|However, and however, it {{is seven}} o'clock, and the shops are {{beginning}} to shut. No more shop-gazing. Only one lovely place: raw ham, boiled ham, chickens in aspic, chicken vol-au-vents, sweet curds, curd-cheese, rustic <b>cheese-cake,</b> smoked sausages, beautiful fresh mortadella, huge Mediterranean red lobsters, and those lobsters without claws. [...] "So good! So good!" [...] We stand and cry it aloud.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Lambert whistled his {{favourite}} tune of [...] "Over {{the hills}} and far away," [...] with a drum accompaniment performed by {{his fingers on the}} window. [...] "I say, you mustn't whistle on Sunday, papa!" [...] cries the artless young gown-boy from Grey Friars; and then suggested that it was three hours from breakfast, and he should like to finish Theo's <b>cheese-cake.</b>|$|E
60|$|It was Easter week, and Mrs. Tulliver's <b>cheese-cakes</b> {{were even}} more light than usual, so that no season could have been better for a family party to consult Sister Glegg and Sister Pullet and Sister Deane about Tom's going to school.|$|R
60|$|Mill. I came up, madam, as we country-gentlewomen use, at an Easter-term, to the {{destruction}} of tarts and <b>cheese-cakes,</b> to see a new play, buy a new gown, take a turn in the park, and so down again to sleep with my fore-fathers.|$|R
60|$|Dire {{were the}} threats with which Hetty menaced Theo, in case her sister should betray her. As for the {{infantile}} Charley, his mind being altogether set on <b>cheese-cakes,</b> {{he had not}} remarked or been moved by Miss Hester's emotion; and {{the parents and the}} kind sister of course all promised not to reveal the little maid's secret.|$|R
60|$|With {{security}} {{from the}} storm, {{at least for}} the time being, everybody found himself hungry. A small fire of fir branches was started, and over this they made a pot of coffee and broiled a piece of the mutton brought along. They had some bread with them, and also some <b>cheese-cake,</b> and managed to make a square meal. They took their time eating, since there was nothing else to do.|$|E
60|$|The man in {{the corner}} looked quite cheerful that morning; he had had two glasses of milk and had even gone to the extravagance of an extra <b>cheese-cake.</b> Polly {{knew that he was}} itching to talk police and murders, for he cast furtive glances at her from time to time, {{produced}} a bit of string, tied and untied it into scores of complicated knots, and finally, bringing out his pocket-book, he placed two or three photographs before her.|$|E
60|$|Tea and a hissing kettle here {{made their}} appearance, {{and the family}} sate down to partake of their evening meal,--leaving, however, Miss Hetty, from her place, command of the window, which she begged her brother not to close. That young gentleman had been down amongst the crowd to inspect the armorial {{bearings}} of the Countess's and other sedans, no doubt, and also to invest sixpence in a <b>cheese-cake,</b> by mamma's order and his own desire, and he returned presently with this delicacy {{wrapped up in a}} paper.|$|E
5000|$|It was, at the Goncourt lunches, {{the most}} imaginable charming friend. He {{animated}} {{the table with}} his rapid and colorful stories. He loved to laugh broadly, but one could feel, behind his laughter, a harsh understanding of life. He wrote, in my opinion, two masterpieces: Champi-Tortu and Petit Dagrello. When I told him, he seemed surprised. His tales of hunter and fisherman have an extraordinary flavor. He was a gourmand, and repeatedly regaled us with <b>cheese-cakes</b> from Bélâbre. He knew and loved the peasant world. His death is a real mourning for the Letters and for his colleagues, whom he had pleasure in compelling. We, the [...] "Goncourt", will often think of him, his joyful entrance, his clairvoyant and sensitive eyes (Léon Daudet, L’Action française, 22 April 1937).|$|R
60|$|Everybody was mad with excitement. William {{was coming}} on Christmas Eve. Mrs. Morel {{surveyed}} her pantry. There {{was a big}} plum cake, and a rice cake, jam tarts, lemon tarts, and mince-pies--two enormous dishes. She was finishing cooking--Spanish tarts and <b>cheese-cakes.</b> Everywhere was decorated. The kissing bunch of berried holly hung with bright and glittering things, spun slowly over Mrs. Morel's head as she trimmed her little tarts in the kitchen. A great fire roared. There was a scent of cooked pastry. He was due at seven o'clock, but he would be late. The three children had gone to meet him. She was alone. But at a quarter to seven Morel came in again. Neither wife nor husband spoke. He sat in his armchair, quite awkward with excitement, and she quietly went on with her baking. Only by the careful way in which she did things could it be told how much moved she was. The clock ticked on.|$|R
6000|$|The {{three days}} were, {{as she had}} foretold, busy enough. I had thought all the rooms at Thornfield beautifully clean and well arranged; but it appears I was mistaken. Three women were got to help; and such scrubbing, such brushing, such washing of paint and beating of carpets, such taking down and putting up of pictures, such {{polishing}} of mirrors and lustres, such lighting of fires in bedrooms, such airing of sheets and feather-beds on hearths, I never beheld, either before or since. Adele ran quite wild {{in the midst of}} it: the preparations for company and the prospect of their arrival, seemed to throw her into ecstasies. She would have Sophie to look over all her [...] "toilettes," [...] as she called frocks; to furbish up any that were [...] "passees," [...] and to air and arrange the new. For herself, she did nothing but caper about in the front chambers, jump on and off the bedsteads, and lie on the mattresses and piled-up bolsters and pillows before the enormous fires roaring in the chimneys. From school duties she was exonerated: Mrs. Fairfax had pressed me into her service, and I was all day in the storeroom, helping (or hindering) her and the cook; learning to make custards and <b>cheese-cakes</b> and French pastry, to truss game and garnish desert-dishes.|$|R
60|$|Alleyne {{started off}} {{along the path}} indicated, and soon found the log-hut where the burner dwelt. He was away faggot-cutting in the forest, but his wife, a ruddy bustling dame, found the needful {{garments}} and tied them into a bundle. While she busied herself in finding and folding them, Alleyne Edricson stood by the open door looking in at her with much interest and some distrust, for {{he had never been}} so nigh to a woman before. She had round red arms, a dress of some sober woollen stuff, and a brass brooch the size of a <b>cheese-cake</b> stuck in the front of it.|$|E
6000|$|I come, kind gentlemen, strange news to tell ye; [...] I am {{the ghost}} of poor {{departed}} Nelly. [...] Sweet ladies, be not frighted; I'll be civil, [...] I'm what I was, a little harmless devil. [...] For, after death, we spirits have just such natures, [...] We had, for all the world, when human creatures; [...] And, therefore, I, that was an actress here, [...] Play all my tricks in hell, a goblin there. [...] Gallants, look to't, you say there are no sprites; [...] But I'll come dance about your beds at nights. [...] And faith you'll be in a sweet kind of taking, [...] When I surprise you between sleep and waking. [...] To tell you true, I walk, because I die [...] Out of my calling, in a tragedy. [...] O poet, damn'd dull poet, who could prove [...] So senseless, to make Nelly die for love! [...] Nay, what's yet worse, to kill me in the prime [...] Of Easter-term, in tart and <b>cheese-cake</b> time! [...] I'll fit the fop; for I'll not one word say, [...] To excuse his godly out-of-fashion play; [...] A play, which, if you dare but twice sit out, [...] You'll all be slandered, and be thought devout. [...] But, farewell, gentlemen, make haste to me, [...] I'm sure e'er long to have your company. [...] As for my epitaph when I am gone, [...] I'll trust no poet, but will write my own:-- [...] Here Nelly lies, who, though she lived a slattern, [...] Yet died a princess, acting in St Catharine.|$|E
60|$|Our young {{folks were}} up betimes on Sunday morning, and arrayed {{themselves}} in those smart new dresses which were to fascinate the Tunbridge folks, and, with the escort of brother Charley, paced the little town, and the quaint Pantiles, and the pretty common, long ere {{the company was}} at breakfast, or the bells had rung to church. It was Hester who found out where Harry Warrington's lodging must be, by remarking Mr. Gumbo in an undress, with his lovely hair in curl-papers, drawing a pair of red curtains aside, and opening a window-sash, whence he thrust his head and inhaled the sweet morning breeze. Mr. Gumbo did not happen to see the young people from Oakhurst, though they beheld him clearly enough. He leaned gracefully from the window; he waved a large feather brush, with which he condescended to dust the furniture of the apartment within; he affably engaged in conversation with a cherry-cheeked milkmaid, who was lingering under the casement, and kissed his lily hand to her. Gumbo's hand sparkled with rings, and his person was decorated with a profusion of jewellery--gifts, no doubt, of the fair who appreciated the young African. Once or twice more before breakfast-time the girls passed near that window. It remained opened, but the room behind it was blank. No face of Harry Warrington appeared there. Neither spoke to the other of the subject on which both were brooding. Hetty was a little provoked with Charley, who was clamorous about breakfast, {{and told him he}} was always thinking of eating. In reply to her sarcastic inquiry, he artlessly owned he should like another <b>cheese-cake,</b> and good-natured Theo, laughing, said she had a sixpence, and if the cake-shop were open of a Sunday morning Charley should have one. The cake-shop was open: and Theo took out her little purse, netted by her dearest friend at school, and containing her pocket-piece, her grandmother's guinea, her slender little store of shillings--nay, some copper money at one end; and she treated Charley to the meal which he loved.|$|E
5000|$|In 1967, Joe {{managed to}} {{establish}} himself {{as one of}} Malta's most popular pop singers. His 45 rpm entitled [...] " [...] Il- Kaċċatur", The Hunter, published on Maltadisk APL 1005 B, and recorded by Audiovision Productions, with their studios then located in Zachary Street, Valletta, and now at Mile End in Hamrun, started selling like pastizzi (<b>cheese-cakes)</b> in Malta. It also made a tremendous success in countries where the Maltese and the Gozitans had a diaspora, especially Australia. [...] "Il-Kaċċatur" [...] was composed by Mro. Joseph Ciappara with lyrics by Dr. George Zammit. Incidentally [...] "Il-Kaċċatur" [...] was designated as the [...] "B" [...] side of the record, with Carmen Schembri singing [...] "L-Għanja tal-Emigranti", The Emigrants' Song, being the [...] "A" [...] side. This success prompted Audiovision Productions to issue another follow-up record for Joe still as a [...] "B" [...] side entitled [...] "Il-Festa Taghna", (Our Feast). This was another composition by Mro. Joseph Ciappara with lyrics by J.B.Cassar.(Maltadisk APL 1006). Joe's first [...] "A" [...] side was entitled [...] "Ku Klu Ku Klu" [...] (Cock-a doodle-doo) with lyrics by Albert M. Cassola and music by F.X. Pisani.(Maltadisk APL 1007). In 1968 two other [...] "A" [...] sides were published : [...] "Il-Lejl Tal-Vitorja" [...] (8 September Night) (Maltadsik APL 1015) and [...] "Nhar San Girgor" [...] (St.Gregory's Day) (Maltadisk APL 1016). The lyrics of these two songs were written by Dr. George Zammit whilst Mro. Guzeppi Ciappara composed the music. In those days, in Malta it was a landmark for a Maltese singer to record four consecutive 45 rpm {{in less than two}} years. These records continued to increase the popularity of Joe Grech both in Malta and in the Maltese diaspora. In these four recordings Joe Grech was always accompanied by the orchestra of Mro. Spiro Zammit.|$|R
6000|$|Magdalen {{stopped his}} mouth by a summary process, to which even Frank {{submitted}} gratefully. At the same time, {{she did not}} forget to set down his discontent to the right side. [...] "How fond he is of me!" [...] she thought. [...] "A year's waiting is quite a hardship to him." [...] She returned to the house, secretly regretting {{that she had not}} heard more of Frank's complimentary complaints. Miss Garth's elaborate satire, addressed to her while she was in this frame of mind, was a purely gratuitous waste of Miss Garth's breath. What did Magdalen care for satire? What do Youth and Love ever care for except themselves? She never even said as much as [...] "Pooh!" [...] this time. She laid aside her hat in serene silence, and sauntered languidly into the morning-room to keep her mother company. She lunched on dire forebodings of a quarrel between Frank and his father, with accidental interruptions in the shape of cold chicken and <b>cheese-cakes.</b> She trifled away half an hour at the piano; and played, in that time, selections from the Songs of Mendelssohn, the Mazurkas of Chopin, the Operas of Verdi, and the Sonatas of Mozart--all of whom had combined together on this occasion and produced one immortal work, entitled [...] "Frank." [...] She closed the piano and went up to her room, to dream away the hours luxuriously in visions of her married future. The green shutters were closed, the easy-chair was pushed in front of the glass, the maid w as summoned as usual; and the comb assisted the mistress's reflections, through the medium of the mistress's hair, till heat and idleness asserted their narcotic influences together, and Magdalen fell asleep.|$|R
60|$|If you {{had heard}} the tone of mingled good-will, veneration, and condolence in which this {{greeting}} was uttered, even without seeing the face that completely harmonized with it, you would have no difficulty in inferring the ground-notes of Mr. Jerome's character. To a fine ear that tone said as plainly as possible--'Whatever recommends itself to me, Thomas Jerome, as piety and goodness, shall have my love and honour. Ah, friends, this pleasant world is a sad one, too, isn't it? Let us help one another, let us help one another.' And it was entirely owing to this basis of character, not at all from any clear and precise doctrinal discrimination, that Mr. Jerome had very early in life become a Dissenter. In his boyish days he had been thrown where Dissent {{seemed to have the}} balance of piety, purity, and good works on its side, and to become a Dissenter seemed to him identical with choosing God instead of mammon. That race of Dissenters is extinct in these days, when opinion has got far ahead of feeling, and every chapel-going youth can fill our ears with the advantages of the Voluntary system, the corruptions of a State Church, and the Scriptural evidence that the first Christians were Congregationalists. Mr. Jerome knew nothing of this theoretic basis for Dissent, and in the utmost extent of his polemical discussion he had not gone further than to question whether a Christian man was bound in conscience to distinguish Christmas and Easter by any peculiar observance beyond the eating of mince-pies and <b>cheese-cakes.</b> It seemed to him that all seasons were alike good for thanking God, departing from evil and doing well, whereas it might be desirable to restrict the period for indulging in unwholesome forms of pastry. Mr. Jerome's dissent being of this simple, non-polemical kind, it is easy to understand that the report he heard of Mr. Tryan as a good man and a powerful preacher, who was stirring the hearts of the people, had been enough to attract him to the Paddiford Church, and that having felt himself more edified there than he had of late been under Mr. Stickney's discourses at Salem, he had driven thither repeatedly in the Sunday afternoons, and had sought an opportunity of making Mr. Tryan's acquaintance. The evening lecture was a subject of warm interest with him, and the opposition Mr. Tryan met with gave that interest a strong tinge of partisanship; for there was a store of irascibility in Mr. Jerome's nature which must find a vent somewhere, and in so kindly and upright a man could only find it in indignation against those whom he held to be enemies of truth and goodness. Mr. Tryan had not hitherto been to the White House, but yesterday, meeting Mr. Jerome in the street, he had at once accepted the invitation to tea, saying there was something he wished to talk about. He appeared worn and fatigued now, and after shaking hands with Mrs. Jerome, threw himself into a chair and looked out on the pretty garden with an air of relief.|$|R
