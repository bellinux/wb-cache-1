To generate the simulation results, the hardware configurations were modeled using Creo and Rhinoceros 5, three-dimensional surface modeling computer-aided design (CAD) programs. The CAD model was imported into Rotorcraft Computational Fluid Dynamics (RotCFD), a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tool used for analyzing rotor flow fields. RotCFD simulation results were compared with the experimental results of three hardware configurations at two azimuth angles, two angles of attack, and with and without wind tunnel walls. The results help validate RotCFD as a tool for analyzing low-drag rotor hub designs for advanced high-speed rotorcraft concepts.

In {{order to reduce}} the energy consumption of double-gimbal <b>control</b> moment <b>gyros</b> and avoid the singularity state, an attitude maneuver path planning method is proposed by using the improved Fourier basis algorithm.

A static mass imbalance identification method without using the closed-loop transfer function is proposed in this paper. Then the null displacement control of the magnetically suspended rotor is realized by using the identified static mass imbalance. Because null vibration is the control target for the rotor of a magnetically suspended <b>control</b> moment <b>gyro</b> (MSCMG) with active-passive magnetic bearings, a null vibration control method depending on the displacement stiffness is introduced.
