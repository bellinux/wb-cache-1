5|$|The Sadducismus debellatus pamphlets, {{written by}} Lord Cullen, giving {{details about the}} demonic {{possession}} of Christian Shaw, the 11-year-old girl at {{the centre of the}} Paisley witches trials, were in circulation at the time. Patrick <b>Cowper,</b> the local minister who was intolerant of witches, had read the pamphlets to Morton just before his afflictions began. The villagers' suspicions were aroused that the Devil was implicated when no explanation could be given for Morton's condition; initially his seizures were described as unusual then as preternatural. <b>Cowper</b> continued to advise Morton about what happened in Paisley and encouraged him to name Laing as the person who had called upon the Devil to inflict his ailments. In May 1704 Morton named Laing as a witch and, with further prompting from <b>Cowper,</b> accused four local women of being her accomplices: Isobel Adam; Janet Cornfoot; Nicholas Lawson; and Lillie Wallace. Subsequent statements revealed that he identified another woman, Janet Horseburgh, as an accomplice.|$|E
40|$|Analyses of mutant mice with a {{deletion}} for the transforming {{growth factor}} beta 2 (Tgfβ 2) gene revealed cysts in the perineal/scrotal region of male mice. We present evidence from in situ, light and electron microscopy that the cysts observed in Tgfβ 2 +/− heterozygous mice males derive from <b>Cowper's</b> glandtissue. The <b>Cowper's</b> glands of Tgfβ 2 +/− heterozygous mutant mice display all steps of glandular hyperplasiaand cystic dilation. TGF-β isoforms and TGF-β receptor (TβR-II) were localized immunocytochemicallyin sections of <b>Cowper's</b> glands. TGF-ββ 2 and TGF-β 3 were located predominantly inmyoepithelial {{cells of the}} <b>Cowper's</b> gland whereas the TβRII {{was found in the}} plasma membrane of the acinar cells. TUNEL-assays revealed that apoptotic cell death is significantly reduced in <b>Cowper's</b> glands of Tgfβ 2 +/− heterozygous mutant mice. The fact that Tgfβ 2 +/− heterozygous mutant mice exhibit hyperplasia of <b>Cowper's</b> gland epithelium and <b>Cowper's</b> gland cysts suggests a disturbance of epithelial–stromal interaction mostlikely due to reduced TGF-β 2 level, accompanied by a significant decrease in apoptosis...|$|R

40|$|In the rat, {{mouse and}} hamster, {{but not in}} the guinea-pig, <b>Cowper's</b> {{secretion}} reacts in vitro with vesicular secretion to produce a coagulant (Hart & Green-stein, 1968). Unlike vesiculase, the pH optimum of this reaction is acidic. In the rat, the active agent secreted by <b>Cowper's</b> glands that is responsible for coagulation is heat stable and non-dialysable. Electrophoretically the active molecule migrates only slightly at a pH 8 =. and reacts chemically as a glyco-protein. The vesicular substrate in the rat which coagulates upon exposure to <b>Cowper's</b> secretion {{has been shown to be}} a protein, electrophoretically different from the substrate of vesiculase (Hart & Greenstein, 1968). Recent data suggest that vesiculase promotes vesicular coagulation by transamidase reactions(Notides & Williams-Ashman, 1967). This paper presents evidence which suggests that the mechanism by which <b>Cowper's</b> secretion coagulates vesicular substrate is non-enzymatic, involving, at least in part, an ionic interaction between <b>Cowper's</b> secretion and substrate. <b>Cowper's</b> secretion was obtained from mature male rats by milking th...|$|R

40|$|Cystic {{dilatation}} of <b>Cowper's</b> gland ducts (<b>Cowper's</b> syringocele) is {{uncommon in}} children and is frequently asymptomatic, but it may cause urinary infection, haematuria, dysuria, and obstructive voiding symptoms. Fifteen consecutive children with syringocele aged 15 days to 15 years old are reported here. Only four patients with obstructive syringocele were successfully treated surgically; all the others were successfully treated conservatively. The true clinical significance of <b>Cowper's</b> syringocele lies in its potential to cause urethral obstruction.

5|$|Cornfoot's {{murder was}} {{investigated}} {{by members of}} the aristocracy appointed by the Privy Council two weeks after the killing. Subsequently four men were held in custody and charges were to be brought against the burgh bailie. The release of the four accused men was authorised by Patrick <b>Cowper,</b> the local minister, who had been involved with the initial witchcraft allegations and the torture and confinement of the alleged witches. Despite instructions from the Privy Council that another committee should look into the events, no suspects were ever prosecuted for the murder.|$|E
5|$|Four locals {{had been}} {{identified}} by the committee as witnessing Cornfoot being killed and being involved in her mistreatment although the three main perpetrators, who had by then left the area, were an Orcadian, a man from Burntisland and a Sea captain's son. A schoolboy, two Englishmen and another person were also implicated but had absconded. The committee determined that Bailie Cook, whose residence the mob had seized Cornfoot from, should carry {{a significant amount of}} the blame. Four males suspected of being present at the murder were held in custody but were released by <b>Cowper</b> in defiance of the Privy Council's instruction for them to be taken to Edinburgh for trial.|$|E

5|$|Maiden Castle has {{provided}} inspiration for composer John Ireland and authors Thomas Hardy and John <b>Cowper</b> Powys. The study of hill forts was popularised in the 19th century by archaeologist Augustus Pitt Rivers. In the 1930s, archaeologist Mortimer Wheeler and Tessa Verney Wheeler undertook the first archaeological excavations at Maiden Castle, raising its profile among the public. Further excavations {{were carried out}} under Niall Sharples, which added {{to an understanding of}} the site and repaired damage caused in part by the large number of visitors. Today the site is protected as a Scheduled Ancient Monument and is maintained by English Heritage.|$|E
5|$|The castle was {{primarily}} built from bricks, with stone {{used for the}} detailing, such as doorways. The brickwork was decorated with patterns of darker bricks, called diapering, which was used to show symbols associated with Lord Hastings, as well as objects such as a jug and a ship. This style of decorative brickwork and stonework was popular across England at this time, but particularly so at Eton College, where John <b>Cowper,</b> the master mason on the project, had been an apprentice. Although the castle was not extensively decorated, the brickwork at Kirby Muxloe was skillfully executed, with the bricklayers cutting and shaping the kiln-fired bricks to produce spiral and domed vaulting.|$|E

40|$|We {{present an}} adult case of <b>Cowper's</b> syringocele. A 19 -year-old male {{presented}} with the chief complaint of persistent post-voiding dribbling 5 months after onset. Urethroscopy demonstrated a thin membrane with a small orifice on the ventral aspect distal to the external sphincter. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a restiform shadow {{on the left side}} of the corpus spongiosum. Retrograde urethrogram showed filling of diverticulum-like structure in the region of urethral bulb terminating in the urogenital diaphragm. Considering the results mentioned above, we diagnosed the patient with <b>Cowper's</b> syringocele. Transurethral unroofing of the <b>Cowper's</b> syringocele was performed with a cold knife, and the excessive tissue on the edge of syringocele was electroresected to avoid recurrence. His post-voiding dribbling resolved completely after the procedure and has not recurred in 13 months postoperatively. <b>Cowper's</b> syringocele is typically diagnosed presenting with hematuria, urinary tract infection, and disuria in male infants and children. Adult cases of <b>Cowper's</b> syringocele are rare, and only 32 cases including the present case have been reported.

5|$|In 1805, Messrs. Wood and Street, from Richmond, Va., {{found their}} way to Kentucky. Friendly {{considerations}} led me to patronize them. This was done through the solicitations of a young friend from Virginia. They commenced a paper, published in 1806, called the 'Western World.' Imbibing strong prejudices against slavery, perhaps from my mother's repeating, in my infancy, the nurse's songs composed by <b>Cowper,</b> designed to make such impressions. In June 1806, to the great astonishment of my friends, I left Kentucky, with all the flattering prospects a youth could have, and hastened to Ohio. Connecting circumstances, and from hints that fell from Wood and others, a deep impression had been made on my mind, that an eventful period was fast approaching.|$|E
5|$|The 1707 Acts of Union had merged the Kingdom of England and Kingdom of Scotland {{into one}} {{national}} entity, but they retained separate legal systems.

His work in Moncrieff v Moncrieff in 1734 established Murray as a brilliant young barrister praised for his performance by Lords <b>Cowper</b> and Parker. After Moncrieff, Murray was involved in almost every case in the House of Lords, whether it had been appealed from a Scottish court or not.|$|E
