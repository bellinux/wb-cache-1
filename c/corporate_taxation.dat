The main perspective {{is in the}} corporate income tax law, {{but because of the}} multidisciplinary subject of the <b>corporate</b> capital gains <b>taxation,</b> this study also has an economic perspective. Before analyzing the taxation itself, the basic concepts for the study are introduced such as the concept of capital, income and capital gain. Also the tax framework of this study is introduced by describing the most significant features and issues in <b>corporate</b> income <b>taxation</b> and in <b>corporate</b> capital gains <b>taxation.</b> <b>Corporate</b> capital gains <b>taxation</b> is discussed by starting with Nordic countries, continuing with European Union member states and finally ending up with Finland. A rough comparative summary is created {{at the end of each}} of these sections. Recent changes having taken place until January 2015 in the <b>corporate</b> capital gains <b>taxation</b> are also included in the study. Taxation is investigated based on the existing tax law literature, and the analysis is fulfilled with the help of the selected case law. After the international tax system analysis, the future options for <b>corporate</b> capital gains <b>taxation</b> are discussed as well as challenges related to the changes in the <b>corporate</b> income <b>taxation</b> such as correct level of harmonization so that individual countries still have their own fiscal policy. This study offers the value-added to the society in a couple of different ways. The study extensively analyzes the international <b>corporate</b> capital gains <b>taxation</b> models. In addition, the study not only discusses the corporate capital gains purely from the legal point of view but also has a strong focus on the underlying features behind the <b>corporate</b> capital gains <b>taxation</b> system: features of the good taxation system, economics and competitiveness, significance and role of the corporate capital gains in the economics. The conclusions of the study are made in a concrete way, because a proposal for the focus of future development of the <b>corporate</b> capital gains <b>taxation</b> at the EU level and the proposal for a future <b>corporate</b> capital gains <b>taxation</b> model in Finland as an individual Nordic country and EU member state is developed...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: While <b>corporate</b> income <b>taxation</b> is a {{major issue}} in the debate over {{international}} finance, economic theory has no clear stance on who bears its burden. On balance, economists seem still more prone to accept that taxing profits does not affect corporations’ outcomes. This paper makes three cases for nonneutrality. First, since <b>corporate</b> income <b>taxation</b> is asymmetric between profit and loss, the tax rate may change the ranking of alternative investments. Secondly, the imperfect observability of the use of internal resources makes pure economic profits very difficult to detect. Thirdly, when the pervasive role of entrepreneurship is fully taken into account, <b>corporate</b> income <b>taxation</b> appears clearly as a direct tax on market adjustments and successful speculation. 1...|$|R
25|$|The {{economic}} crisis in the 1990s has been widely cited in the Anglo-American press as a social democratic failure, {{but it is important}} to note not only did profit rates begin to fall worldwide after the 1960s, also this period saw neoliberal ascendance in Social Democratic ideology and policies as well as the rise of bourgeois coalition rule in place of the Social Democrats. 1980s Social Democratic neoliberal measures—such as depressing and deregulating the currency to prop up Swedish exports during the economic restructuring transition, dropping <b>corporate</b> <b>taxation</b> and taxation on high income-earners, and switching from anti-unemployment policies to anti-inflationary policies—were exacerbated by international recession, unchecked currency speculation, and a centre-right government led by Carl Bildt (1991–1994), creating the fiscal crisis of the early 1990s.|$|E

He questioned Sarkozy's proposals on Schengen and instead merely acknowledged that it was not functioning correctly, but concurred with him in exempting the acquisition of French nationality by foreigners at the age of 18 if previously convicted. Juppé also demanded transparency on the funding of places of worship, civic training for imams, and, unlike Sarkozy, favored allowing women to wear the Muslim headscarf at universities. On economic issues, he proposed to end the 35-hour workweek, abolish the wealth tax, reduce <b>corporate</b> <b>taxation,</b> and set the retirement age at 65.

2500|$|In {{recent times}} {{there have been}} two major tax reforms in Norway. The first, the tax reform of 1992, was a {{pervasive}} and principle based reform, inline with the international trend of broader tax base and lower rates. <b>Corporate</b> <b>taxation</b> was designed so that the taxable profit should correspond to the actual budget surplus. [...] This meant, among other things that different industries, forms of ownership, financing methods and investment were treated equally (neutrality) and that revenues and related expenditures were subject to the same tax rate. In the personal income tax, a clearer distinction between labour income and investment income was introduced (split - a dual income tax system). Ordinary income, income less standard deductions and deductible expenses, was taxes at a flat rate of 28%. On personal income, income from work and pensions, there were in addition levied social security contributions and surtax. To avoid that income that was taxed at the corporate level also were taxed at the individual level (double taxation), the imputation tax credit for dividends and treasury system gains was introduced.|$|E
