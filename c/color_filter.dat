25|$|A system sending {{all three}} signals {{at the same}} time at a {{conventional}} refresh rate would be greatly preferable. Transmitting such a signal could be accomplished by using three camera tubes, each with a <b>color</b> <b>filter</b> in front of them, using mirrors or prisms to aim at the same scene through a single lens. Each signal would then be separately broadcast using three conventional TV channels, and using the luminance concept, one of those could be received on a conventional black and white set. This would use a considerable amount of bandwidth, but this was a small cost in the era of only a few television channels.|$|E
25|$|Autochrome, {{the first}} commercially {{successful}} color process, {{was introduced by}} the Lumière brothers in 1907. Autochrome plates incorporated a mosaic <b>color</b> <b>filter</b> layer made of dyed grains of potato starch, which allowed the three color components to be recorded as adjacent microscopic image fragments. After an Autochrome plate was reversal processed to produce a positive transparency, the starch grains served to illuminate each fragment with the correct color and the tiny colored points blended together in the eye, synthesizing {{the color of the}} subject by the additive method. Autochrome plates were one of several varieties of additive color screen plates and films marketed between the 1890s and the 1950s.|$|E
40|$|Holographic <b>color</b> <b>filters</b> for LCDs are {{discussed}} in this thesis. Transmission and reflection holographic <b>color</b> <b>filters</b> have been experimentally fabricated and charac-terized. Because of their high efficiency (> 90 %) and excellent color purity, holo-graphic <b>color</b> <b>filters</b> demonstrate superior optical performance in comparison to currently utilized dyed <b>color</b> <b>filters</b> whose efficiencies are typically {{on the order of}} 25 percent. The holographic <b>color</b> <b>filters</b> were fabricated by the simple interference of two plane-wave beams from an argon-ion laser in holographic recording materials. Tri-color RGB reflection and transmission <b>color</b> <b>filters</b> were obtained by selectively varying the relative angle between the two write beams or by changing the wavelength of the laser beams. The holographic recording material used in all the experiments was a photopolymer by DuPont which does not require any post-exposure wet-developing thereby minimizing film shrinkage and expansion which can cause a color shift. In our experiments, transmission and reflection <b>color</b> <b>filters</b> were fabricated with extremely high efficiencies (98 % for transmission <b>color</b> <b>filters,</b> 94 % for reflection <b>color</b> <b>filters),</b> and excellent <b>color</b> purities (> 98 % for blue and red colors,> 82 % for green <b>color</b> <b>filters).</b> The viewing angles for these filters were about 1. 5 degrees and 15 degrees for transmission type and reflection type <b>color</b> <b>filters</b> respectively. A tech-nique of recording multiple gratings was utilized to increase the viewing angle. The center wavelengths of RGB three primary colors of the <b>color</b> <b>filters</b> were designed to match the response function of human eye and could be custom tailored {{for a wide variety of}} applications. The efficiency of the holographic <b>color</b> <b>filters</b> can be selected by changing the intensity ratio of the two write beams, exposure energy, or thickness of the holographic recording material. Experimental results indicate that holographic <b>color</b> <b>filters</b> can significantly improve the optical performance of the liquid crystal displays and this simple, versatile, and manufacturable technique is suitable for a wide variety of display requirements.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a comparison between}} primary (RGB) and complementary (CYMG) CCD <b>color</b> <b>filters</b> arrays, as applied to digital photography. Our analysis is based upon the measured spectral characteristics of the primary and complementary color versions of the Matsushita MN 3776 CCD. The important role of the color correction matrix {{on the quality of the}} image is considered both in terms of noise and color saturation. Our calculations show that there is a tradeoff between color saturation and ISO speed, when complementary filters are used. Complementary <b>color</b> <b>filters</b> only gain an ISO speed advantage when the color saturation is low. When the color correction matrix is chosen to make the ISO speeds of the two filter systems equivalent, the well capacity of the complementary CCD must be significantly higher because of the higher overall transmission of its <b>color</b> <b>filters.</b> Our comparison includes ISO speed calculations and plots of the color gamut for primary and complementary <b>color</b> <b>filters</b> with various <b>color</b> correction matrices.

Conventional <b>color</b> <b>filters</b> have usually only one fixed output color. However developing active <b>color</b> <b>filters</b> with controllable <b>color</b> output can lead to more compact and sophisticated color filter-based devices and applications. Recent progress in nano-technology and new knowledge of the interaction of light with metal nanostructures allow us to capture and control light better than ever. Here we use it to fabricate active <b>color</b> <b>filters,</b> based on arrays of metallic optical nanoantennas that are tailored to interact with light at visible frequencies via excitation of localized surface plasmons. This interaction maps the polarization state of incident white light to visible color. Similarly, it converts unpolarized white light to chromatically polarized light.

Metallic nanostructures provide an efficient way to design and engineer ultrathin <b>color</b> <b>filters.</b> These nanostructures have capability to split the white light into fundamental colors and enable <b>color</b> <b>filters</b> with ultrahigh resolution but their efficiency can be restricted due to high losses in metals especially at the visible wavelengths. In this work, we demonstrate all-dielectric <b>color</b> <b>filters</b> based on Si nanoantennas, which are sensitive to incident-wave polarization and, thus, tunable with the aid of polarization angle variation. Two different information can be encoded in two different polarization states in one nanostructure. The nanoantenna based pixels are highly efficient and can provide high quality of colors, in particular, due to low losses in Si at optical frequencies. We experimentally demonstrate that a variety of colors can be achieved by changing the physical size of the nonsymmetric cross-shaped nanoantennas. The proposed devices allow to cover an extended gamut of colors on CIE- 1931 chromaticity diagram owing to the existence of high-quality resonances in Si nanoantennas. Significant tunability of the suggested <b>color</b> <b>filters</b> can be achieved by varying polarization angle in both transmission and reflection mode.
