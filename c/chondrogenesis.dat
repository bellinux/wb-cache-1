5|$|In skeletally {{immature}} individuals, {{the blood}} supply to the epiphyseal bone is good, supporting both osteogenesis and <b>chondrogenesis.</b> With disruption of the epiphyseal plate vessels, varying degrees and depth of necrosis occur, resulting in a cessation of growth to both osteocytes and chondrocytes. In turn, this pattern leads to disordered ossification of cartilage, resulting in subchondral avascular necrosis and consequently OCD.|$|E
25|$|General gene {{knock out}} of the TGF-β {{resulted}} in death. Conditional inactivation of TGF-βr2 of osteochondroprogenitor cells in the cranial neural crest resulted in faster osteoprogenitor differentiation and disorganised <b>chondrogenesis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Sox9, L-Sox5 and Sox6 {{are needed}} for the osteochondroprogenitor to undergo chondrocytic differentiation. The {{transcription}} factor Sox9 {{can be found in}} multiple sites in the body (pancreas, central nervous system, intestines) and it is also found in all chondrocyte progenitor cells, suggesting that they are important in <b>chondrogenesis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Alexander Friedenstein and {{his colleagues}} first {{identified}} osteoprogenitor cells in multiple mammalian tissues, before any genetic or morphological criteria {{were put in place}} for bone marrow or connective tissues. Osteoprogenitor cells can be identified by their associations with existing bone or cartilage structures, or their placement in the embryo, as the sites for osteogenesis and <b>chondrogenesis</b> are now known.|$|E
25|$|TGF-β determines and regulates cell {{lineages}} during endochondral ossification through Sox9 and Runx2 signalling pathways. TGF-β {{will act}} as a stimulator of <b>chondrogenesis,</b> and an inhibitor of osteoblastic differentiation, by blocking the Runx2 factor through Smad3 activation. Sox9 stimulates differentiation into chondrocytes. Sox9 blocked osteochondroprogenitor cells were found to express osteoblast marker genes, reprogramming the cells into the osteoblastic lineage.|$|E
2500|$|Early {{in vitro}} studies have found the Notch {{signaling}} pathway functions as down-regulator in osteoclastogenesis and osteoblastogenesis. Notch1 is expressed in the mesenchymal condensation area and subsequently in the hypertrophic chondrocytes during <b>chondrogenesis.</b> [...] Overexpression of Notch signaling inhibits bone morphogenetic protein2-induced osteoblast differentiation. [...] Overall, Notch signaling has {{a major role in}} the commitment of mesenchymal cells to the osteoblastic lineage and provides a possible therapeutic approach to bone regeneration.|$|E
5000|$|Bone {{morphogenetic}} proteins are {{growth factors}} released during embryonic development to induce condensation and determination of cells, during <b>chondrogenesis.</b>  Noggin, a developmental protein, inhibits <b>chondrogenesis</b> by preventing condensation and differentiation of mesenchymal cells.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chondrogenesis</b> is {{the process}} by which {{cartilage}} is developed.|$|E
50|$|In another {{in-vitro}} study Dickhut et al. investigated {{whether a}} combination of a collagen membrane (Chondro-Gide) with fibrin glue supports in-vitro <b>chondrogenesis</b> of MSCs and allowed for local release of bioactive transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-β1). They could show, that the combination provided high biofunctionality with improved <b>chondrogenesis</b> and long term local supply of TGF-β1. TGF-β1 is a secreted protein that performs many cellular functions, including the control of cell growth, cell proliferation, cell differentiation and apoptosis. Additionally Dickhut et al. could demonstrate that the form stability of the forming repair tissue was enhanced when compared to collagen-membrane-free constructs.|$|E
50|$|Fluocinolone acetonide {{was also}} found to {{strongly}} potentiate TGF-β-associated <b>chondrogenesis</b> of bone marrow mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells, by increasing the levels of collagen type II by more than 100 fold compared to the widely used dexamethasone.|$|E
5000|$|Additional studies {{emphasized}} {{the role of}} Sulfs in <b>chondrogenesis.</b> The role of QSulf1 was determined in quail cartilage development and joint formation because of its association with chondrogenic growth factor signaling (Wnt and BMP). Sulf1 was expressed highly in condensing mesenchyme and, in cell culture, caused prechondrocytes to differentiate into chondrocytes, indicating QSulf1 is needed for early <b>chondrogenesis.</b> QSulf1 displayed perichondrial staining during early development but was downregulated during later stages of development. [...] In addition, QSulf1 shows transient expression in the early joint line followed by its rapid loss of expression in later stages of joint development, suggesting it would have an inhibitory effect in later joint development. [...] Because Sulfs were important in normal <b>chondrogenesis,</b> they were investigated in cartilage diseases. Expression patterns of Sulf1 and Sulf2 were determined in normal and osteoarthritic (AO) cartilage. Both Sulf1 and Sulf2 showed enhanced expression in OA and aging cartilage. Given several HSPGs (perlecan, syndecan 1/3, glypican) are upregulated and growth factor signaling through FGF-2, Wnt, BMP, and Noggin are modulated in OA, Sulfs and the modifications of HS may mediate an entirely new level of control over OA development.|$|E
50|$|In embryogenesis, the {{skeletal}} system {{is derived from}} the mesoderm germ layer.

50|$|GDF11 {{is closely}} related to myostatin, a {{negative}} regulator of muscle growth. Both myostatin and GDF11 are involved in the regulation of cardiomyocyte proliferation. GDF11 is also a negative regulator of neurogenesis, the production of islet progenitor cells, the regulation of kidney organogenesis, pancreatic development, the rostro-caudal patterning in the development of spinal cords, and is a negative regulator of <b>chondrogenesis.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The limb's {{skeletal}} {{elements are}} prefigured by tight aggregates known as cellular condensations of the pre-cartilage mesenchymal cells. [...] Mesenchymal condensation is mediated by extracellular matrix and cell adhesion molecules.

In the development of most vertebrate limbs (though not in some amphibians), the cartilage skeleton is replaced by bone later in development.|$|E
50|$|During {{mandible}} development, {{most of it}} {{is formed}} through intramembranous ossification, where endochondral ossification will occur in the proximal region.TGF-β is important for cell proliferation and differentiation during skeletogenesis. During this process, TGF-β can stimulate differentiation into either chondrocytes or osteoblasts via FGF, Msx1, and Ctgf signalling pathways. General gene knock out of the TGF-β resulted in death. Conditional inactivation of TGF-βr2 of osteochondroprogenitor cells in the cranial neural crest resulted in faster osteoprogenitor differentiation and disorganised <b>chondrogenesis.</b>|$|E
50|$|This gene encodes {{a member}} of the SOX (SRY-related HMG-box) family of {{transcription}} factors involved in the regulation of embryonic development and in the determination of the cell fate. The encoded protein may act as a transcriptional regulator after forming a protein complex with other proteins.

Multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been identified for this gene.|$|E
50|$|During organogenesis, {{molecular}} {{and cellular}} interactions between germ layers, {{combined with the}} cells' developmental potential, or competence to respond, prompt the further differentiation of organ-specific cell types. For example, in neurogenesis, a subpopulation of ectoderm cells is set aside to become the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves. Modern developmental biology is extensively probing the molecular basis for every type of organogenesis, including angiogenesis (formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing ones), <b>chondrogenesis</b> (cartilage), myogenesis (muscle), osteogenesis (bone), and many others.|$|E
50|$|Microfracture {{surgery was}} {{developed}} by Dr. Steadman in the late 80’s and early 90’s. It is a well documented cartilage repair technique and first line treatment option for small cartilage lesions. AMIC evolved with the aim to improve some of the shortfalls of microfracture surgery as for instance variable repair cartilage volume and functional deterioration over time. Additionally {{it was intended to}} provide a simple technique for securely retaining the fragile blood clot in larger defects and to possibly enhance the <b>chondrogenesis</b> of MSCs.|$|E
5000|$|Autologous Matrix-Induced <b>Chondrogenesis</b> (AMIC) is a {{biological}} treatment option which repairs articular cartilage damage.

It slows down cartilage degeneration with the intent to avoid or delay partial or total joint replacement (e.g. knee replacement) surgery.

50|$|The first {{in-vitro}} work {{demonstrating that}} a collagen membrane can retain cartilage building cells (e.g. MSCs) from bone marrow {{was published in}} 2006 by Kramer et al.. After perforation of the subchondral bone (microfracturing) the collagen membrane {{was added to the}} forming super-clot. Then MSCs were recovered from a tiny surplus of bone marrow soaked membrane. As a proof of their existence, MCSs were successfully differentiated into the adipogenic, osteogenic and most importantly chondrogenic lineage. Chondrification (also known as <b>chondrogenesis)</b> is the underlying process of cartilage formation from condensed mesenchyme tissue, which differentiates into chondrocytes and begins secreting the molecules that form the extracellular matrix, the cartilage repair tissue.|$|E
50|$|One {{study showed}} that HDAC7 {{suppresses}} proliferation and β-catenin activity in chondrocytes. This was shown by knocking out HDAC7 in mice, which then resulted in increased levels of the cell cycle regulator, cyclin D3; decreased levels of the tumor suppressor, p21; and increased levels of active beta-catenin. Since each of these contribute to regulating cell proliferation, deletion of HDAC7 increased chondrocyte proliferation. This study also showed that signaling via the insulin/Insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor led to increased levels of HDAC7 in the cytosol than the nucleus and increased levels of active β-catenin, indicating that HDAC7 associates with β-catenin. During <b>chondrogenesis,</b> HDAC7 is translocated to the cytosol to be degraded, indicating that generally HDAC7 represses β-catenin activity in chondrocytes.|$|E
5000|$|Maci or {{autologous}} cultured chondrocytes on porcine collagen membrane is a [...] {{treatment to}} correct cartilage defects in the knee. It {{is used to}} treat symptomatic, full-thickness cartilage defects of the knee with or without bone involvement. MACI is an autologous cellularized scaffold product. This treatment is approved by US the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It is only administered to adults. Healthy cartilage {{is removed from the}} person's own knees and a 'scaffold' is created on which the healthy tissue growths. This is an Autologous matrix-induced <b>chondrogenesis</b> procedure which prevents tissue rejection complications since the transplanted cartilage comes from the same person. A similar product approved for use in the UK is CaReS®-1S.|$|E
50|$|Chondroblasts, or perichondrial cells, is {{the name}} given to mesenchymal {{progenitor}} cells in situ which, from endochondral ossification, will form chondrocytes in the growing cartilage matrix. Another name for them is subchondral cortico-spongious progenitors. They have euchromatic nuclei and stain by basic dyes. These cells are extremely important in <b>Chondrogenesis</b> due to their role in forming both the Chondrocytes and cartilage matrix which will eventually form cartilage. Use of the term is technically inaccurate since mesenchymal progenitors can also technically differentiate into osteoblasts or fat. Chondroblasts are called Chondrocytes when they embed themselves in the cartilage matrix, consisting of proteoglycan and collagen fibers, until they lie in the matrix lacunae. Once they embed themselves into the cartilage matrix, they grow the cartilage matrix by growing more cartilage extracellular matrix rather than by dividing further.|$|E
50|$|A 2011 study reports histologically {{confirmed}} {{hyaline cartilage}} regrowth in a 5 patient case-series, 2 with grade IV bipolar or kissing lesions in the knee. The successful protocol involves arthroscopic microdrilling/ microfracture surgery followed by postoperative injections of autologous peripheral blood progenitor cells(PBPC's) and hyaluronic acid(HA). PBPC’s are a blood product containing mesenchymal stem cells and is obtained by mobilizing {{the stem cells}} into the peripheral blood. Dr. Khay Yong Saw and his team propose that the microdrilling surgery creates a blood clot scaffold on which injected PBPC’s can be recruited and enhance <b>chondrogenesis</b> {{at the site of}} the contained lesion. They explain that the significance of this cartilage regeneration protocol is that it is successful in patients with historically difficult-to-treat grade IV bipolar or bone-on-bone osteochondral lesions.|$|E
5000|$|In {{osteoblast}} progenitor cells, Osteoactivin {{works as}} a positive regulator of osteoblast differentiation during later stages of matrix maturation and mineralization [...] that is mediated {{at least in part}} by BMP-2 in a SMAD1 dependent manner to promote osteoblast differentiation. In addition, using a rat fracture model, Osteoactivin (OA) enhances the repairing process in bone fracture, demonstrated by its high expression during <b>chondrogenesis</b> (soft callus) and osteogenesis (hard callus) compared to the intact femurs [...] that is why Osteoactivin (OA) could be a novel therapeutic agent used to treat generalized osteoporosis or localized osteopenia during fracture repair by stimulating bone growth and regeneration. [...] Similarly, Osteoactivin expression increases during osteoclast differentiation and it is functionally implicated in this process, possibly by promoting the fusion of osteoclast progenitor cells.|$|E
