2500|$|Nubian Architecture {{is one of}} {{the most}} ancient in the world. The {{earliest}} style of Nubian Architecture include the speos, [...] structures carved out of solid rock, an A-Group(3700-3250 BCE) achievement. Egyptians made extensive use of the process at Speos Artemidos and Abu Simbel. A-Group eventually led to C-Group. C-Group began with light, supple materials, animal skins, and wattle and daub. Later larger more structures of mudbricks became the norm. C-Group culture was related to Kerma. Kerma was settled around 2400 BC. It was a walled city containing religious building, large circular dwelling, a palace, and well laid out roads. On the East side of the city, funerary temple and chapel were laid out. It supported a population of 2,000. One of its most enduring structures was the Deffufa, a mudbrick temple ceremonies were performed on top. Between 1500-1085 BC, Egyptian conquest and domination of Nubia was achieved. This conquest brought about the Napatan Phase of Nubian history, the birth of the Kingdom of Kush. Kush was immensely influenced by Egypt and eventually conquered Egypt. During this phase, we see the building of numerous pyramids and temples. Gebel Barkal in the town of Napata was a very significant site. Kushite pharaohs received legitimacy. Thirteen temples have been excavated and two palaces in Napata. Napata has yet to be fully excavated. [...] Nubian pyramids were constructed on three major sites El Kurru, Nuri, and Meroe. Sudan has more pyramids than Egypt. Sudan contains 223 pyramids. They were smaller than Egyptian Pyramids. Nubian pyramids were for Kings and Queens. The general construction of Nubian pyramids consisted of steep walls, a chapel facing East, stairway facing East, and a <b>chamber</b> <b>access</b> via the stairway. The Meroe site has the most Nubian pyramids and is considered the largest archaeological site in the world. Around AD 350 the area was invaded by the Ethiopian kingdom of Aksum and the kingdom collapsed.|$|E

5000|$|After the disbandment of the US Army {{cryptographic}} {{section of}} Military Intelligence, known as MI-8, in 1919, the United States government created The Cipher Bureau, {{also known as}} the Black Chamber. The Black Chamber was the United States' first peacetime cryptanalytic organization. Jointly funded by the Army and the State Department, the Cipher Bureau was disguised as a New York City commercial code company; it actually produced and sold such codes for business use. Its true mission, however, was to break the communications (chiefly diplomatic) of other nations. Its most notable known success was during the Washington Naval Conference during which it aided American negotiators considerably by providing them with the decrypted traffic of many of the Conference delegations, most notably the Japanese. The Black Chamber successfully persuaded Western Union, the largest U.S. telegram company at the time, as well as several other communications companies to illegally give the Black <b>Chamber</b> <b>access</b> to the cable traffic of foreign embassies and consulates. Eventually, these companies publically discontinued their collaboration.|$|E

40|$|We are {{interested}} in designing a reusable and robust activity monitoring platform. In this paper we propose three good properties that an activity monitoring platform should have to enable its reusability for different applications and to insure performance quality: 1) modularity and flexibility of the architecture, 2) separation between the algorithms and the a priori knowledge they use, and 3) automatic evaluation of algorithm results. We then propose a development methodology to fulfill the last two properties. The methodology consists in the interaction between end-users and developers during the whole development of a specific monitoring system for a new application. To validate our approach, first we present a platform that we use to generate activity monitoring systems dedicated to specific applications. Then we explain how we have managed to give concrete expression to these properties in the platform. Finally we describe in details the technical validation and the end-user assessment of an automatic metro monitoring system built with the platform. We give the corresponding validation results for two other systems built with the same platform: a bank agency monitoring system and a building lock <b>chamber</b> <b>access</b> control system...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{in vitro}} the sealing ability of three materials used as cervical barrier for internal dental bleaching. METHODS: Thirty-three canines were selected, and after biomechanical root canal preparation, the canals were filled by lateral condensation technique. After the filling material setting reaction, the teeth were randomly {{divided into three}} groups of ten teeth each, according to the following materials for constructing the cervical barrier: X Temp LC; Vitro Fil; Coltosol. The control group consisted of three teeth, without placement of the cervical cap. Sodium perborate /distilled water associated with 2 % Rhodamin B were used as bleaching substance. After placing the bleaching agent in the pulp <b>chamber,</b> <b>access</b> cavities were sealed with temporary cement IRM and samples were stored at 37 Â° for 7 days. After this period, the samples were cleaved longitudinally, and leakage was evaluated by the visual method. The data were submitted to Pearson test with a 5 % level of significance. RESULTS: No statistically {{significant difference was found}} between the study groups, however, the largest number of specimens with a lower degree of leakage were found in the Coltosol group.

40|$|With the {{development}} of transgenic and specialized mouse strains, there is an increased need for inhalation exposure systems designed for smaller exposure groups. An inhalation exposure chamber, designed specifically for the exposure of up to 40 mice, was characterized. The chamber was fabricated from 0. 32 -cm-thick ((1) /(8) -in) aluminum sheets with outside dimensions of 61 cm long by 32 cm high by 34 cm deep, resulting in an internal volume of 65 L. Two stainless-steel open-mesh cages, separated by an absorbent barrier, can be stacked within the central portion of the <b>chamber.</b> <b>Access</b> is provided through a gasketed door with a safety-glass face. Tests were performed to determine the chamber leakage rate, degree of mixing, and spatial variation of two aerosols within the chamber. Results indicated that the fractional leakage rate was 0. 0003 min(- 1), well below a reported criterion for an operating chamber. Chamber operation gave similar mixing performance with, or without, use of an interior fan. For aerosols with a mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) of 2. 56 micro m and 3. 14 micro m, the spatial variation of particulate matter concentration resulted in coefficients of variation (CVs) of 4. 8 % and 11. 0 %, respectively.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was the creation of a high precision volume measurement device using the Helmholtz resonator principle, the purpose of which was to measure, without interference, liquids, solids and particulate samples. A previous study by Nishizu et al. (2001) suggested they achieved an accuracy of about + 1 % of full scale, where full scale is 100 % fill of the resonator chamber. Theory suggested that with careful design and measurement accuracy of approximately + 0. 1 % should be achievable. A high precision resonator was designed using acoustic theory and drawn using SolidWorksTM computer aided design software. This was then built using a computerised numerical controlled milling machine. The resulting resonator was coupled to a 16 -bit high-speed data acquisition system driven by purpose-made LabVIEWTM software. Using a resonant hunting method, repeatability was within + 1 mL for a 3 L chamber and the accuracy was better than + 3 mL, which is + 0. 1 % of full scale for liquid and solid samples. Testing of particulate material gave results indicating complex behaviour occurring within the resonator. Accuracy of sub-millimetre granular samples was restricted to approximately + 1 %, and fill factors to about 50 %. This reduction in accuracy was caused by a combination of energy absorption and resonant peak broadening. Medium sized particles, between 1 mm and 15 mm allowed measurement accuracies of approximately + 0. 5 %. Larger samples, greater than 15 mm in diameter, gave results with comparable accuracy to water and solids tested. It was found that most materials required a post measurement curve fit to align predictive volume calculations. All samples were observed to have a predictive deviation curve with coefficients dependent on the material or general shape. This curve appeared to be a function of sample regularity and/or whether the sample has interstitial spaces. To achieve high measurement accuracy temperature compensation was required to negate drifts in sample measurement. Chamber mapping was conducted using a spherical solid moved to precise locations, then making a three-dimensional frequency map of the inside of a dual port resonator. This showed the length extension term for the moving mass of air in the port penetrates roughly three times further than theory suggests. However, the influence of this extra âtailâ was found to be negligible when calculating sample volumes. A new method of measuring volume was developed using Q profile shifting and ambient temperature information. Accuracies for this method were comparable to those found using the resonant hunting method. A significant advantage of the new method is a 2 - 3 second measurement time compared to approximately 40 seconds for the resonant hunting method. The Q profile shifting method allowed volume measurements on samples moving through a dual port resonator at speeds of up to 100 mm/s. Free fall measurements proved unsuccessful using existing methods, but variations in signal data for different sample sizes suggest the need for future investigation. Follow-up studies may provide new interpretation models and methods for high-speed acquisition and analysis required to solve freefall measurements. Precise temperature (speed of sound) and flange factor (responsible for port length extension) relationships were evaluated. The correction factor for the speed of sound with temperature was found to be marginally different to established theory using the Helmholtz equation due to temperature secondary effects in the port length extension factor. The flange factor, which determines port length extension, for the configurations used in {{this investigation}} was experimentally found to be approximately 5 % less than theoretical values. It was established that the sample to be measured must be within a certain region of the chamber for accurate volume measurements to be made. If the sample were larger than the bounded region the resonant frequency would no longer obey the Helmholtz relationship. This would thereby reduce the accuracy of the measurement. All samples irrespective of cross sectional area were found to alter the resonant frequency when they were over 85 % of the chamber height. An equalisation method termed environmental normalisation curve was developed to prevent environmental and loudspeaker deficiencies from colouring Q profiles used in Q profile shifting procedures. This was undertaken as Q profile shifting relies on consistency in the Q profile. The environmental normalisation curve was able to equalise external factors to within + 0. 4 dB. The environmental normalisation method could be used to post-process data or applied in real time to frequency generation. The controlled decent Q profile shifting technique was refined further to be used in continuous measurements in a single port resonator. Samples could theoretically be measured up to 15 % of full-scale fill before resonant peak predictability would compromise accuracy. Measurement times were from one to three seconds, depending on environmental temperature stability. An alternative Helmholtz resonator was developed and investigated using an inverted port. This variant has potential applications for a seal-less chamber and port with rapid non-interference <b>chamber</b> <b>access.</b> Q factors for the inverted port resonator were found to be significantly less than tradition [sic] Helmholtz resonators. It is believed this is due to a larger boundary layer acoustic resistance occurring in the inverted port. A variable chamber resonator was designed and built as a further development of the Helmholtz resonator volume measurement system, as the uncertainty of measurement is a function of resonant chamber size. Therefore, using the variable chamber resonator the chamber size could be customised to the sample size. In this way the uncertainty of measurement could be minimised. The variable chamber resonator was used with both the resonant hunting method and the Q profile shifting method. Volume measurements on produce and minerals using the variable chamber resonator yielded results of similar accuracy to measurements on calibration samples. Each sample type displayed characteristics that would make specific calibration necessary. Both techniques were able to detect hidden void spaces, larger than 2 % of the sample volume, and in punctured samples. Therefore, both methods may be viable for rapid sorting of produce and minerals...|$|E
