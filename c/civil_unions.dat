The Senate Democratic Leadership, Democrats opposed to <b>civil</b> <b>unions,</b> and Senate Republicans {{voted in favor of}} an amendment to the bill that added language reaffirming the distinction between <b>civil</b> <b>unions</b> and marriage and allowing same-sex and opposite-sex couples to enter <b>civil</b> <b>unions.</b> The amendment was adopted, which killed the bill, as a revised version required renewed approval by the Hawaii House of Representatives and the Legislature adjourned May 8, 2009. Senate President Hanabusa stated the issue would not be taken up again before 2010.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of his governorship, Romney opposed same-sex marriage and <b>civil</b> <b>unions,</b> but advocated tolerance and supported some domestic partnership benefits. A November 2003 Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court decision required the state to recognize same-sex marriages (Goodridge v. Department of Public Health). Romney reluctantly backed a state constitutional amendment in February 2004 that would have banned those marriages but still allowed <b>civil</b> <b>unions,</b> viewing it as the only feasible way to accomplish the former. In May 2004, in compliance with the court decision, the governor instructed town clerks to begin issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples. However, citing a 1913 law that barred out-of-state residents from getting married in Massachusetts if their union would be illegal in their home state, he said no marriage licenses were to be issued to those people not planning to move to Massachusetts. In June 2005, Romney abandoned his support for the compromise amendment, stating that it confused voters who opposed both same-sex marriage and <b>civil</b> <b>unions.</b> Instead, he endorsed a ballot initiative led by the Coalition for Marriage and Family (an alliance of socially conservative organizations) that would have banned same-sex marriage and made no provisions for <b>civil</b> <b>unions.</b> In 2004 and 2006, he urged the U.S. Senate to vote in favor of the Federal Marriage Amendment.|$|E

5|$|Following Baehr v. Lewin, a 1993 {{decision}} by the Supreme Court of Hawaii that found the state's refusal to grant same-sex couples marriage licenses discriminatory, voters in 1998 approved a constitutional amendment granting the Hawaii State Legislature the power to reserve marriage to opposite-sex couples, and the legislature passed a law banning same-sex marriage. <b>Civil</b> <b>unions</b> were not restricted.

40|$|LLM (Estate Law), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 In this {{research}} report the estate implications for a marriage or civil partnership, entered into {{in terms of}} the <b>Civil</b> <b>Union</b> Act, are identified by determining the impact thereof and whether or not there are any differences with regard to the estate implications of a traditional marriage. The <b>Civil</b> <b>Union</b> Act came into effect to give legality to the relationship between homosexual couples by providing the option to conclude a marriage or civil partnership. Both of these institutions thus have the same legal consequences. According to Section 13 of the <b>Civil</b> <b>Union</b> Act the implications of the Marriage Act also apply to the <b>Civil</b> <b>Union</b> Act. The feasibility of this principle is not taken into account regarding estate implications. Since a marriage and civil partnership {{in terms of the}} <b>Civil</b> <b>Union</b> Act differs from a traditional marriage, it leads to uncertainty with regard to the application of this principle. This uncertainty and estate implications are the topic of this study. The total effect of the <b>Civil</b> <b>Union</b> Act is not discussed in the <b>Civil</b> <b>Union</b> Act, but rather consists of references to other legislation. Consequently the specific estate implications for a marriage or civil partnership, entered into in terms of the <b>Civil</b> <b>Union</b> Act, are discussed with specific focus on marriage regimes, maintenance, purchasing of household necessities, donations and tax benefits. Both the position before and after the <b>Civil</b> <b>Union</b> Act are considered. Firstly marriage regimes are discussed since it {{is the first step in}} identifying estate implications for the marriage or civil partnership. Maintenance is considered a direct result of a marriage and is referred to in many laws. It is therefore necessary to discuss the content of the legislation and whether or not it is compatible with the <b>Civil</b> <b>Union</b> Act. The buying of household necessities, donations and tax benefits has a unique effect on a marriage and the focus in this study is on the effect it has on a marriage and civil partnership entered into in terms of the <b>Civil</b> <b>Union</b> Act. The conclusion is that {{this research}} report will provide clarity on what exactly the estate implications are for parties who have married or concluded a civil partnership in terms of the <b>Civil</b> <b>Union</b> Act.

Hooser argued for the bill using President Barack Obama's support of <b>civil</b> <b>unions</b> and the support of labor unions and the majority of Hawaii House representatives. The Honolulu Advertiser reported that Senate President Colleen Hanabusa privately told senators the bill could lead to a lawsuit to legalize same-sex marriage.
