The <b>chair</b> <b>is</b> now displayed in the Rutherford B. Hayes Presidential Center in Fremont, Ohio. He later gave a chair constructed of bearskin and other bear body parts to Hayes's vice-president William A. Wheeler.|$|E
5|$|The town council, {{which is}} the parish council, first convened on 1 April 2009, and its <b>chair</b> <b>is</b> the Mayor of Shrewsbury. For the interim period before the first elections, the {{existing}} county councillors who represented electoral divisions covering Shrewsbury were the town councillors. On 4 June 2009, the first election was held to the town council, with councillors elected from 17 single-member wards coterminous with Shropshire Council electoral divisions.|$|E
5|$|Each of the city's eight wards elects {{a single}} {{member of the}} council and {{residents}} elect four at-large members to represent the District as a whole. The council <b>chair</b> <b>is</b> also elected at-large. There are 37 Advisory Neighborhood Commissions (ANCs) elected by small neighborhood districts. ANCs can issue recommendations on all issues that affect residents; government agencies take their advice under careful consideration. The Attorney General of the District of Columbia, currently Karl Racine, is elected to a four-year term.|$|E
60|$|I {{have endured}} tortures of various sorts, but when I reflect upon {{them in the}} {{quietness}} of these my last days, I am confident that no other torture was quite the equal of that chair torture. By my body that stout <b>chair</b> <b>was</b> battered out of any semblance of a <b>chair.</b> Another <b>chair</b> <b>was</b> brought, and in time that <b>chair</b> <b>was</b> demolished. But more <b>chairs</b> <b>were</b> brought, and the eternal questioning about the dynamite went on.|$|R

Public <b>chairs</b> <b>were</b> licensed, and charged {{according}} to tariffs which would <b>be</b> prominently displayed. <b>Chair</b> stands <b>were</b> found at all hotels, wharves, and major crossroads. Their numbers peaked in about 1920.|$|R
5|$|Possessive pronouns {{exist in}} {{dependent}} and independent forms; the dependent form {{functions as a}} determiner specifying a noun (as in my chair), while the independent form can stand alone {{as if it were}} a noun (e.g. the <b>chair</b> <b>is</b> mine). The English system of grammatical person no longer has a distinction between formal and informal pronouns of address, and the forms for 2nd person plural and singular are identical except in the reflexive form. Some dialects have introduced innovative 2nd person plural pronouns such as y'all found in Southern American English and African American (Vernacular) English or youse and ye found in Irish English.|$|E
5|$|The Brooklyn Free School holds a weekly, {{mandatory}} Democratic Meeting on Wednesday mornings. The meeting {{runs the}} school, and {{students and teachers}} alike have equal votes. Students {{are not required to}} pay attention. Meeting topics range from disciplinary grievances to admissions to computer use. A meeting <b>chair</b> <b>is</b> chosen {{at the beginning of the}} meeting and the floor is opened for propositions. Anyone wishing to discuss a school issue can call schoolwide meetings.|$|E
5|$|The Emeco 1006 (pronounced ten-oh-six), {{also known}} as the Navy <b>chair,</b> <b>is</b> an {{aluminum}} chair manufactured by Emeco. The 1006 was originally built for Navy warships during World War II, but later became a designer chair used in high-end restaurants and by interior designers. In the 1990s, the company began creating designer versions of the 1006 chair, such as the stackable Hudson chair and the 111 Navy Chair made from recycled plastic. Emeco also makes stools, tables, and other furniture. As of 2012, more than one million Emeco 1006 chairs have been produced.|$|E

5|$|The IP address {{leads to}} another live feed similar in nature {{to the first}} one. However, the <b>chair</b> <b>is</b> empty this time. There is another number painted on the wall, which Black recognizes as a case file number from {{his time in the}} FBI—the case {{concerned}} Avatar, a serial killer who was able to evade all attempts at capture. Avatar sends Black a coded message twice, and places a woman in the chair on the feed, keeping her face hidden. Roedecker realizes that, through image differencing, the two messages contain additional information—a sound clip from The Mikado, known to be Avatar's favourite operetta.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{study has}} Bertin standing and leaning {{on a table}} in an almost Napoleonic pose. His hard, level stare is already established, but the focus seems to be on his groin rather than his face. It is obvious that Ingres struggled with the sketch; the head is on a square of attached paper which must have replaced an earlier cut-out version, and other areas have been rubbed over and heavily reworked. The next extant drawing shows Bertin seated, but the <b>chair</b> <b>is</b> missing. The last extant sketch is the closest to the eventual painting, with a chair, though his bulk has not yet been filled out.|$|E
5|$|The family disapproves of {{his first}} few inventions, {{including}} a make-up shotgun, electric hammer, alarm that never stops beeping, and reclining chair with a built-in toilet, making Homer more depressed. However, they like one particular invention, a chair with two hinged legs on the back, {{making it impossible to}} tip over backwards. Homer is encouraged until he notices his poster of Edison shows him sitting in the same type of chair. Bart points out that the <b>chair</b> <b>is</b> not featured on a list of Edison's inventions, meaning he never told anyone of this invention.|$|E

5|$|To {{the same}} generic type belongs the famous abbots’ chair of Glastonbury; such chairs might readily {{be taken to}} pieces when their owners travelled. The faldisterium in time {{acquired}} arms and a back, while retaining its folding shape. The most famous, {{as well as the}} most, ancient, English <b>chair</b> <b>is</b> that made {{at the end of the}} 13th century for Edward I, in which most subsequent monarchs have been crowned. It is of an architectural type and of oak, and was covered with gilded gesso which long since disappeared.|$|E
5|$|Although {{having the}} same floor plan, the House and Senate {{chambers}} are decorated very differently, with the former in terra cotta and teal colors and the latter in blue and gold. An oval cartouche in the carpet {{at the entrance to}} the House chamber features the state flower, the apple blossom. Presiding over the house is the speaker, whose <b>chair</b> <b>is</b> behind a desk in the center with a plaster and paint version of the state coat of arms. The Senate chamber is somewhat smaller than the House. The president of the Senate is the lieutenant governor, who presides over sessions from a walnut rostrum at the front of the chamber. Both the House and the Senate use computerized voting systems, including wall-mounted screens that allow visitors to follow the voting and both also contain glass tiled ceilings that allow natural light to shine through etched glass panels to better light the room. These ceiling tiles feature the coats-of-arms of each state in the United States.|$|E
5|$|PRSA is {{organized}} as a 501(c)(6) not-for-profit organization and {{governed by a}} set of bylaws. A <b>Chair</b> <b>is</b> nominated each year and elected based on a vote of the Leadership Assembly. The Leadership Assembly consists of one delegate for every 100 members, as well as anyone that holds an elected office. Elected positions within PRSA are held on a volunteer-basis. A Board of Directors can propose membership fee changes that must be approved by the assembly. The board has the authority to create or dissolve task forces and committees as well as revoke or reward membership status. PRSA's Board of Ethics and Professional Standards and the Universal Accreditation Board make recommendations on the code of conduct and accreditation programs respectively. PRSA has more than 100 chapters in ten districts, 300 student chapters and 14 interest groups.|$|E

50|$|At 5:40 pm on 11 June 1914, the <b>chair</b> <b>was</b> {{the object}} of a bomb attack thought to have been {{organised}} by the Suffragettes. A corner of the <b>chair</b> <b>was</b> broken off in the explosion. Although it was strong enough to shake the abbey walls and loud enough to be heard from inside the Houses of Parliament, none of the 70 people in the abbey at the time were injured, and the Coronation <b>Chair</b> <b>was</b> faithfully restored.|$|R
50|$|Originally the Regional <b>Chair</b> <b>was</b> {{selected}} by {{other members of}} regional council who were themselves posted to the council from the region's individual municipalities. From 1991 the position of regional <b>chair</b> <b>was</b> an elected position and as of 1994 regional councillors were elected. This position disappeared in 2001 when the Region and its municipalities were amalgamated into the city of Ottawa. The final Regional <b>Chair</b> <b>was</b> Bob Chiarelli who was subsequently elected Mayor of the amalgamated city.|$|R
5|$|The {{committee}} has had 54 different members. Thirteen {{people have been}} chair and six deputy chair. Ten women have sat on the committee, starting with Aase Lionæs in 1949. From 2009, four of the board's five members are women. Christian Lous Lange {{is the only person}} to have both sat on the committee and been its secretary, and the only peace laureate to have sat on the committee. Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson was, however, awarded the Nobel Literature Prize. The longest-serving members are Hans Jacob Horst and Aase Lionæs, who both served for 30 years. The longest-sitting <b>chair</b> <b>is</b> Gunnar Jahn, who sat for 26 years as chair and 29 years on the committee. The longest period without any changes to the committee was the 15 years from 1949 to 1963. The shortest-sitting member was Esther Kostøl, who sat for less than a year in 1997.|$|E
5|$|Although English {{furniture}} derives so extensively {{from foreign}} and especially French and Italian models, the earlier forms of English chairs owed but little to exotic influences. This was especially the case {{down to the}} end of the Tudor period, after which France began to set her mark upon the British chair. The squat variety, with heavy and sombre back, carved like a piece of panelling, gave place to a taller, more slender, and more elegant form, in which the framework only was carved, and attempts were made at ornament in new directions. The stretcher especially offered opportunities which were not lost upon the cabinet-makers of the Restoration. From a mere uncompromising cross-bar intended to strengthen the construction it blossomed, almost suddenly, into an elaborate scroll-work or an exceedingly graceful semicircular ornament connecting all four legs, with a vase-shaped knob in the centre. The arms and legs of chairs of this period were scrolled, the splats of the back often showing a rich arrangement of spirals and scrolls. This most decorative of all types appears to have been popularized in England by the cavaliers who had been in exile with Charles II, and had become familiar with it in the north-western parts of the European continent. During the reign of William III and Mary II these charming forms degenerated into something much stiffer and more rectangular, with a solid, more or less fiddle-shaped splat and a cabriole leg with pad feet. The more ornamental examples had cane seats and ill-proportioned cane backs. From these forms was gradually developed the Chippendale chair, with its elaborately interlaced back, its graceful arms and square or cabriole legs, the latter terminating in the claw and ball or the pad foot. George Hepplewhite, Thomas Sheraton and Robert Adam all aimed at lightening the chair, which, even in the master hands of Thomas Chippendale, remained comparatively heavy. The endeavour succeeded, and the modern <b>chair</b> <b>is</b> everywhere comparatively slight.|$|E
5|$|The plot of Strawberry Panic! {{revolves}} around {{the lives of the}} adolescents who attend one of three affiliated all-girl schools which share a campus and dormitories. The schools are: St. Miator's Girls' Academy, St. Spica's Girls' Institute, and St. Lulim's Girls' School. There are twelve characters the story {{revolves around}}, four at each school. The story's main character is Nagisa Aoi, a young girl entering her fourth year at St. Miator after being transferred from another school. On first entering the campus grounds, she is overcome with joy by the overall appearance of the surrounding area, but her joy is soon turned to sorrow as she accidentally stumbles down a hill, causing her to be lost and disoriented. While walking around the grounds trying to work out where she is, Nagisa comes across an older student named Shizuma Hanazono, who happens to be Astraea Hill's Etoile, a very important person who acts as a representative between the different schools and has specific duties that she must fulfill. Nagisa is instantly overcome by Shizuma's beauty, and after Shizuma kisses her on the forehead, Nagisa loses consciousness and awakens in the school's infirmary. In an adjacent <b>chair</b> <b>is</b> another girl of the same age, Tamao Suzumi, who informs her that they are to be roommates in the dormitory.|$|E

5|$|When {{the college}} {{was founded in}} 1571, the first charter {{installed}} David Lewis as Principal and named eight others as the first Fellows of the college. The statutes of 1622 allowed for 16 Fellows. There is now no limit {{on the number of}} Fellowships that the Governing Body can create. The college statutes provide for various categories of Fellows. Professorial Fellows are those Professors and Readers of the University who are allocated to the college by the University. One of these professorships is the Jesus Professor of Celtic, which is the only chair in Celtic Studies at an English university. Celtic scholars such as Sir John Rhys and Ellis Evans have held the position since its creation in 1877. The <b>chair</b> <b>is</b> currently vacant, having been held by Thomas Charles-Edwards until his retirement in 2011. The zoologists Charles Godfray and Paul Harvey are both Professorial Fellows. Official Fellows are those who hold tutorial or administrative appointments in the college. Past Official Fellows include the composer and musicologist John Caldwell, the historians Sir Goronwy Edwards and Niall Ferguson, the philosopher Galen Strawson and the political philosopher John Gray. There are also Senior and Junior Research Fellows. Principals and Fellows who retire can be elected as Emeritus Fellows.|$|E
