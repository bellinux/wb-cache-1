40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{identify}} a cutoff {{value based on}} the Percentage of Consonants Correct-Revised index that could indicate {{the likelihood of a}} child with a speech-sound disorder also having a (<b>central)</b> auditory <b>processing</b> disorder. METHODS: Language, audiological and (<b>central)</b> auditory <b>processing</b> evaluations were administered. The participants were 27 subjects with speech-sound disorders aged 7 to 10 years and 11 months who were divided into two different groups according to their (<b>central)</b> auditory <b>processing</b> evaluation results. RESULTS: When a (<b>central)</b> auditory <b>processing</b> disorder was present in association with a speech disorder, the children tended to have lower scores on phonological assessments. A greater severity of speech disorder was related to a greater probability of the child having a (<b>central)</b> auditory <b>processing</b> disorder. The use of a cutoff value for the Percentage of Consonants Correct-Revised index successfully distinguished between children with and without a (<b>central)</b> auditory <b>processing</b> disorder.

5|$|Because {{microcomputers}} in Japan {{were not}} powerful enough {{at the time}} to perform the complex tasks involved in designing and programming Space Invaders, Nishikado had to design his own custom hardware and development tools for the game.

The game uses an Intel 8080 <b>central</b> <b>processing</b> unit, features raster graphics on a CRT monitor and monaural sound hosted by a combination of analog circuitry and a Texas Instruments SN76477 sound chip. Despite the specially developed hardware, Nishikado was unable to program the game as he wanted—the Control Program board was not powerful enough to display the graphics in color or move the enemies faster—and he considered the development of the hardware {{the most difficult part of}} the whole process.

40|$|Sexual {{assault in}} the United States {{continues}} to be a major societal problem which often results in serious long-term consequences for the survivors, with perpetrators most commonly being men. Sexual assault prevention programs for college men often lack theories to guide the research and demonstrate mixed results. Previous research has demonstrated that more traditional male gender role identity is linked to sexual assault supportive attitudes and behaviors, suggesting that masculine ideology could be a contributing factor to college men?s reactions to a sexual assault prevention program. The {{purpose of this study was}} to test a model of how male gender role identity constructs influence college men?s reactions to a sexual assault prevention program through the Elaboration Likelihood Model. Participants were 97 college men, ages 18 to 22. They completed measures of adherence to masculine ideologies, then participated in an hour long sexual assault prevention program focused on bystander prevention, and finally completed measures of <b>central</b> route <b>processing</b> and outcome variables. Structural equation modeling was used to test a model of how masculine ideologies and <b>central</b> route <b>processing</b> contributed to outcome results. These results indicated that men who adhered to more traditional masculine ideologies were less likely to engage in <b>central</b> route <b>processing,</b> a thoughtful processing of the information provided in the prevention program. Additionally, less adherence to traditional masculinity predicted more behavioral intentions to change as a result of the program and less acceptance of rape myths. More engagement in <b>central</b> route <b>processing</b> also predicted more positive outcomes such as behavioral intentions to change and less rape myth acceptance. Results from hierarchical linear regression analysis indicated that <b>central</b> route <b>processing</b> was more influential on the outcome variables than masculine ideology.
