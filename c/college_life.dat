5|$|He knew {{he wanted}} to become a {{professional}} wrestler at the age of twelve and said he performed a wrestling routine in his high school's talent show, complete with fake blood. Hickenbottom was already an athlete; his career began at the age of six when he started playing football. He was a stand-out linebacker at Randolph High School on Randolph Air Force Base and eventually became captain of the football team. After graduating, Hickenbottom attended Southwest Texas State University in San Marcos, Texas, but soon realized that <b>college</b> <b>life</b> was not for him. He then began pursuing a career in professional wrestling.|$|E
5|$|Homer ignores {{his studies}} and instead focuses on his preconceived notions of <b>college</b> <b>life</b> through {{adolescent}} movies and TV shows, {{such as the}} fictional The School of Hard Knockers, which stereotype <b>college</b> <b>life</b> as pranks, partying and rigid deans. He also insults the college dean, Dean Peterson, believing {{him to be a}} crusty, conservative administrator. In reality, Peterson relates well with the students and is relatively young. Homer acts like a know-it-all in class and is asked to demonstrate how a proton accelerator operates; consequently, he causes a nuclear meltdown in class. Dean Peterson takes him aside and recommends hiring a tutor. The tutors turn out to be three computer nerds named Benjamin, Doug, and Gary. The trio try to help Homer understand the material from his physics course, but he refuses to cooperate. Instead, he is determined to help them gain a social life by pulling a prank on rival college Springfield A University. The prank involves kidnapping the other school's mascot, a pig named Sir Oinks-a-lot. However, Homer causes the pig to become very ill after feeding it malt liquor, and Benjamin, Doug, and Gary are blamed for the incident.|$|E
5|$|Brasenose lost 115 {{men in the}} First World War (including {{a quarter}} of the 1913 year), with its {{undergraduate}} numbers greatly reduced. Lord Curzon's post-War reforms were successfully instituted. The inter-war period was defined by William Stallybrass, who as fellow and eventual Principal (until 1948) dominated <b>college</b> <b>life.</b> Brasenose once again produced top sportsmen– cricketers, rowers, and others. This came at the cost of falling academic standards and poorly performing finances, which would see Stallybrass' authority challenged. He died in a railway accident before he could be forced out, however. After the war, sporting achievements waned (although there were notable exceptions) but academic success did not improve significantly, in what was now one of Oxford's largest colleges.|$|E

5|$|Hay {{enrolled}} at Brown in 1855.

Hay received his Master of Arts degree in 1858, and was, like his grandfather before him, Class Poet. He returned to Illinois. Milton Hay had moved his practice to Springfield, and John became a clerk in his firm, where he could study law.|$|E

5|$|One of {{its most}} {{successful}} periods followed during the Second World War when personnel of the Durham University Air Squadron were posted in the castle, doing short courses before joining the Royal Air Force. Those from the college who died during World War II were commemorated by the redevelopment of the Norman Gallery area of the Castle in the 1950s. This period also saw the launch of Castellum, an annual journal of the Castle Society, created to keep former students in touch with <b>college</b> <b>life.</b> In order to continue this expansion, the college purchased Lumley Castle in 1946 to house students, and by 1948 seventy five students were housed there. This section of the college developed a spirit of its own and is still remembered today through activities such as the Lumley Run.|$|E

5|$|The {{president}} of the University of Oregon in Eugene, William Beaty Boyd, had been a senior administrator at the University of California in Berkeley in 1966 when his campus was considered for a location of the film The Graduate. After he consulted with other senior administrative colleagues who advised him to turn it down {{due to the lack}} of artistic merit, the college campus scenes set at Berkeley were shot at USC in Los Angeles. The film went on to become a classic, and Boyd was determined not to make the same mistake twice when the producers inquired about filming at Oregon. After consulting with student government leaders and officers of the Pan Hellenic Council, the Director of University Relations advised the president that the script, although raunchy and often tasteless, was a very funny spoof of <b>college</b> <b>life.</b> Boyd even allowed the filmmakers to use his office as Dean Wormer's.|$|E
5|$|The {{scenes of}} the protagonist's <b>college</b> <b>life</b> were filmed at Keyes High school, near Secunderabad Junction railway station. A school wall was {{demolished}} and a gate was repaired for the film's opening scene. Raghuvaran was carried away during the shoot of few action sequences and slapped Brahmaji for nearly six times in a row. To avoid such issues {{in the case of}} murder scenes, Varma decided to complete few of them by using plain close-ups of the victims. Sudhakar's murder scene was filmed near Keesara in Ranga Reddy district. Gopala Reddy and Ellore placed a camera in a bag and ran behind him for a shaky effect. In the cycle-chain scene in which Siva uses a cycle chain to fight with J. D., the hand pulling the chain was Ellore's; in the next shot, Nagarjuna is shown holding the chain. The scene in which Naresh is killed near his home was filmed in the streets of Vengala Rao Nagar. The cycle chase scenes were filmed in Somajiguda and the slums behind Yashoda Hospitals. The bus chase scene was shot in Yusufguda. The film's climax was filmed at the Swapnalok complex in Secunderabad, and Bhavani's suicide was filmed on a set at Venus Studios in Chennai.|$|E
