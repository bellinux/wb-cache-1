50|$|The first <b>car-carrying</b> <b>wagon</b> explcitly {{designed}} by the Victorian Railways for this purpose was constructed in 1958. The wagon was built by recycling the underframe of a scrapped Swing Door type locomotive-hauled carriage, with skeletal truss sides supporting an upper level deck. The frame, constructed in 1902 as part of 1st class passenger carriage 4AA, was recoded 3A in the 1910 recoding then 144B in 1927, when better quality 1st class carriages had been made available. The new wagon had a capacity of three typical vehicles on each deck.|$|E
50|$|The {{range of}} {{vehicles}} {{was designed to}} be complementary to a model railway set, and for instance included a Rolls Royce Silver Cloud, a Humber Super Snipe, an AEC Routemaster bus, a Shell petrol tanker and a towtruck. The most remarkable vehicle was a Road-Railer, an articulated lorry with a pair of pivoting rear axles, one bearing road wheels and the other rail wheels. The semi-trailer could be remotely uncoupled and then collected by a bogie wagon on the Tri-ang railway system. These could in theory be chained together to compose a train. This vehicle suffered from being underpowered. Vehicles could also be driven aboard a <b>car-carrying</b> <b>wagon</b> in the Tri-ang railway system.|$|E
40|$|This study investigates how shape {{optimisation}} {{affects the}} ultimate fatigue {{strength of a}} mechanical part. The mechanical part chosen for this investigation is an axle guard of running gear elements of the Hccrrs 2 x 2 axle <b>car-carrying</b> <b>wagon.</b> The static and fatigue strength analysis procedure according to the UIC 517 standard and numerical methods have been applied. Material properties were determined experimentally and the necessary numerical calculations were performed by using the finite element method. The observed axle guard is exposed to low cycle fatigue. ε-N curves and material properties of the S 355 J 2 +N steel grade are obtained by combining theoretical formulae and a mathematical function. According to the obtained experimental and numerical results the number of cycles until failure for both shapes of axle guards is obtained...|$|E
50|$|The Tren Francés (also spelled El Francés or Especial), {{named after}} the country of origin of the coaches (France), donated by SNCF to FFCC in 2001, is the fastest long-distance service in Cuba. It has the most modern coaches and {{is divided into two}} classes named primera especial (1st) and primera (nominally 1st, idenfitiable as 2nd). There are no {{sleeping}} cars, couchettes or <b>car-carrying</b> <b>wagons.</b>|$|R
5000|$|VR {{operates}} sleeper services between Helsinki and Turku and Lapland, {{which also}} include <b>car-carrying</b> (motorail) <b>wagons.</b> Double-deck sleeping carriages (including rooms with en suite showers and toilets) were introduced on the Helsinki-Rovaniemi {{service in the}} 2000s. These wagons are painted in a red-and-white livery similar to the InterCity coaches. Other overnight services (Turku-Rovaniemi and Helsinki-Kolari) are operated by older [...] "blue" [...] sleeper carriages.|$|R
