40|$|Fluid bed coating {{has been}} shown to be a {{suitable}} manufacturing technique to formulate poorly soluble drugs in glass solutions. Layering inert carriers with a drug–polymer mixture enables these beads to be immediately filled into capsules, thus avoiding additional, potentially destabilizing, downstream processing. In this study, fluid bed coating is proposed for the production of controlled release dosage forms of glass solutions by applying a second, rate <b>controlling</b> <b>membrane</b> on top of the glass solution. Adding a second coating layer adds to the physical and chemical complexity of the drug delivery system, so a thorough understanding of the physical structure and phase behavior of the different coating layers is needed. This study aimed to investigate the surface and cross-sectional characteristics (employing scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS)) of an indomethacin–polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) glass solution, top-coated with a release rate <b>controlling</b> <b>membrane</b> consisting of either ethyl cellulose or Eudragit RL. The implications of the addition of a pore former (PVP) and the coating medium (ethanol or water) were also considered. In addition, polymer miscibility and the phase analysis of the underlying glass solution were investigated. Significant differences in surface and cross-sectional topography of the different rate <b>controlling</b> <b>membranes</b> or the way they are applied (solution vs dispersion) were observed. These observations can be linked to the polymer miscibility differences. The presence of PVP was observed in all rate <b>controlling</b> <b>membranes,</b> even if it is not part of the coating solution. This could be attributed to residual powder presence in the coating chamber. The distribution of PVP among the sample surfaces depends on the concentration and the rate controlling polymer used.

In recent studies, QS inhibitors have provided evidence of alternative route to <b>control</b> <b>membrane</b> biofouling. This study investigated the role of Piper betle extract (PBE) as an anti-QS agent to mitigate membrane biofouling. Results demonstrated the occurrence of the N-acyl-homoserine-lactone (AHL) autoinducers (AIs), correlate QS activity and membrane biofouling mitigation. The AIs production in bioreactor was confirmed using an indicator strain Agrobacterium tumefaciens (NTL 4) harboring plasmid pZLR 4. Moreover, three different AHLs were found in biocake using thin layer chromatographic analysis. An increase in extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and transmembrane pressure (TMP) was observed with AHL activity of the biocake during continuous MBR operation, which shows that membrane biofouling was in close relationship with QS activity. PBE was verified to mitigate membrane biofouling via inhibiting AIs production. SEM analysis further confirmed the effect of PBE on EPS and biofilm formation. These results exhibited that PBE could be a novel agent to target AIs for mitigation of membrane biofouling.

40|$|Because of the {{different}} challenges still faced in solid dispersion research today, an alternative manufacturing approach was investigated {{in the form of}} fluid bed coating, which enables efficient drying and the omission of additional processing steps which can destabilize solid dispersions. Also, alternative formulation approaches are exploited by incorporating controlled release polymers into solid dispersions, either as a rate <b>controlling</b> <b>membrane</b> or as (part of) the solid dispersion carrier. A first study describes the search for an mDSC sample preparation method for the analysis of INDO-PVP glass solutions coated onto inert sucrose beads using fluid bed coating. The spherical shape of these beads compromises the contact area with the bottom of a DSC sample pan. Grinding the coated beads and separating the resulting particles into different particle size ranges, resulted in a visible glass transition signal. This glass transition, however, shifted and broadened in particle samples with increasing size range. This phenomenon was confirmed in glass solutions prepared as isolated films by rotary evaporation, with different API’s and from different solvent systems. Resulting from TGA analysis, where a difference was made between sub-Tg and above-Tg residual solvent evaporation, it could be concluded that the observed Tg shift and broadening could be ascribed to the differences in residual solvent mass loss from the bulk of the particles and from the surface. Since particles with a smaller size range exhibit a higher surface to mass ratio, they possess more solvent poor surface, as compared to particles with a larger size range, which possess more solvent rich bulk. These findings were confirmed by a correlation between the deviation from the Gordon-Taylor derived Tg and solvent mass loss from the Tg on. In order to control the release of INDO from coated glass solutions, an additional rate controlling coating was applied on top of the glass solution. This can be done consecutively using fluid bed coating. The resulting multilayer coated beads require a combination of surface and bulk characterization to understand the phase behaviour. Different rate <b>controlling</b> <b>membranes</b> were applied on INDO-PVP glass solutions comprising two possible controlled release polymers, different amounts of pore former can be added and the rate <b>controlling</b> <b>membrane</b> can be applied from an ethanol solution or an aqueous dispersion. The investigation of these different formulations on the phase behaviour of the drug delivery system is described in a second investigation. Surface and cross-sectional topography was investigated by SEM. Chemical composition and distribution analysis of these surfaces and cross-sections was performed using ToF-SIMS. Polymer miscibility was assessed with mDSC and crystallinity with XRPD. Topography differences observed on the surface or in the cross-sections of the coated beads can be ascribed to polymer miscibility differences or coating from a solution or a dispersion. PVP presence at the surface of pure ERL or EC coatings {{is the result of a}} coating contamination. The distributional changes of PVP, when incorporated as a pore former can also be explained by polymer miscibility differences. Limited INDO and PVP migration into the rate <b>controlling</b> <b>membrane</b> can be evidenced from cross-sectional ToF-SIMS analysis. Lastly, XRPD analysis shows that INDO remains amorphous after application of a rate <b>controlling</b> <b>membrane,</b> even if it is coated from an aqueous dispersion. The influence of the above described formulation changes and rate <b>controlling</b> <b>membrane</b> thickness on the release of INDO was investigated. In addition to this, the role of a charge interaction between drug and controlled release polymer on the release of the former was investigated as well. Diffusion experiments showed a clear influence of the controlled release polymer used, pore former concentration and coating from a solution or suspension on the permeability of rate <b>controlling</b> <b>membranes.</b> These findings could be readily translated to their influence on drug release, pinpointing diffusion through the rate <b>controlling</b> <b>membrane</b> as the rate limiting step for drug release and showing the potential of these diffusion experiments for screening purposes of rate <b>controlling</b> <b>membranes.</b> A charge interaction between INDO and ERL was confirmed by ss-NMR but no clear influence of this interaction on the drug release was observed. The diffusion and release differences through ERL and EC coatings are mainly the result of the higher hydrophilicity of the former. Finally, the use of ERL as a solid dispersion carrier is investigated, either alone or in combination with the hydrophilic polymer PVP. The solid dispersions are produced by spray drying and analysed with respect to their phase behaviour and in vitro drug dissolution. After in vitro dissolution, precipitates are collected and analysed again with mDSC. ERL solid dispersions with INDO and NAP showed extended supersaturated drug concentrations, when compared to the hydrophilic polymer PVP. Combinations of PVP and ERL as a carrier combined this extended supersaturation with higher drug concentrations compared to ERL alone. Phase behaviour analysis showed that ERL can form glass solutions and, in the case of INDO, one phase systems are found after 24 h dissolution as well. Low drug loadings in combination with ERL as a carrier resulted in slow diffusion out of the carrier making this approach unfavourable. Oversaturated INDO and NAP solutions formed stable nanocrystals in presence of ERL. This formation can be explained by a dynamic interplay of dissolution, sorption and desorption. High sorption levels are necessary for this nanocrystal formation, and a charge interaction between INDO/NAP and ERL provide the necessary driving force for sorption. status: publishe...|$|R

Thus, membrane proteins represent attractive candidates as drug targets. Bacteriorhodopsin (bR), the most widely studied membrane protein, consists of seven transmembrane helical segments and functions which can work as a proton pump in Halobacterium Salinarium. In the present study, the reversible control of bR conformation with simple light illumination is examined, providing a protocol to probe membrane protein folding (a challenge {{even to this day}} due to the large, aggregation-prone hydrophobic regions of membrane proteins compared to soluble proteins). Two general methodologies are utilized to <b>control</b> <b>membrane</b> protein folding, including (1) saturation of the natural lipids with a photoresponsive surfactant resulting in partitioning of the protein into detergent-lipid mixed micelles in the unfolded state, and (2) the development of artificial bilayers through self-assembly of the photosurfactant into light-responsive vesicles to solubilize membrane proteins. The azobenzene-based photosurfactant undergoes a reversible photoisomerization upon illumination either visible (trans) or UV (cis) light. The trans isomer is relatively hydrophobic and, thus, readily forms detergent-lipid mixed micelles relative to the cis form, while the planar trans conformation also enhances the formation of artificial lamellar structures in vesicle bilayers relative to the bent cis form.

At re-entry peri-implant bone defect dimensions were measured and compared with values recorded at implant/GBR surgery. A biopsy was retrieved for qualitative and quantitative histological analyses. A comparison between the groups was conducted using non-parametric statistical tests. RESULTS: Soft tissue complications were observed in five test patients and two control patients. Except for soft tissue complications and incomplete regeneration, no procedure- or device-related adverse events were observed. The vertical bone defect component was, in mean, reduced by- 5. 1  mm (95 % CI - 6. 8, - 3. 3) in the test group and - 6. 9  mm (95 % CI - 8. 2, - 5. 5  mm) in the control group. The mean residual vertical defect height measured 1. 2  ±  2. 4  mm in the test group and 0. 3  ±  1. 1  mm in the control group meaning a mean defect resolution of 81 % in the test group and 96 % in the control group (P =  0. 161). The horizontal bone thickness at implant shoulder level decreased from a mean of 3. 2  mm to 1. 4  mm (- 56 %, mean - 1. 7  mm, 95 % CI - 2. 3, - 1. 1) in the test group and from 3. 3  mm to 2. 5  mm (- 24 %, mean - 0. 8  mm, 95 % CI - 1. 3, - 0. 3) in the control group (P =  0. 022).

Label incorporation in a 90 -kDa polypeptide was more intense (4 -fold) in membranes after aldosterone compared to control. For in vitro methylation, membranes were isolated, incubated with S-adenosyl-L-[methyl- 3 H]methionine, and analyzed for 3 H-methyl uptake. Label incorporation was low in <b>control</b> <b>membranes</b> but markedly stimulated (4 -fold) in membrane preparations from aldosterone-treated cells. Guanosine 5 ′-O-(3 -thiotriphosphate) increased in vitro methylation of a 90 -kDa polypeptide 5 -fold in <b>control</b> <b>membranes</b> but after aldosterone, where methylation was already stimulated, little change was observed. We conclude that aldosterone induces methylation of an apical membrane 90 -kDa polypeptide, possibly a subunit of the epithelial Na+ channel, in a GTP-dependent manner, {{and this may be}} one of the final steps in a cascade of reactions leading to the natriferic action of this hormone.

40|$|Alternating {{deposition}} of oppositely charged polyelectrolyte (PE) complexes (PECs) were recently reported to create stable solvent resistant nanofiltration (SRNF) membranes with high flux and selectivity. The new combination of poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA) {{with a weak}} polyacid (polyacrylic acid, PAA) was investigated in this report, since the charge density of these PEC based membranes can be affected by more factors than with strong polyacids, such as salt concentration and pH. Thus offers more possibilities to <b>control</b> <b>membrane</b> morphology and performance. Prepared membranes showed more than 90 % retention for Rose Bengal (RB) from different solvents, proving the good potential of these membranes in SRNF applications. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Throughout normal development, and in {{aberrant}} {{conditions such}} as cancer, cells divide by a process called cytokinesis. Most textbooks suggest that animal cells execute cytokinesis using an actomyosin-containing contractile ring, whereas plant cells generate a new cell wall by the assembly of a novel membrane compartment using vesicle- trafficking machinery in an apparently distinct manner. Recent {{studies have shown that}} cytokinesis in animal and plant cells may not be as distinct as these models imply - both have an absolute requirement for vesicle traffic. Moreover, some of the key molecular components of cytokinesis have been identified, many of which are proteins that function to <b>control</b> <b>membrane</b> traffic.

40|$|Optical tracers in {{conjunction}} with fluorescence microscopy have become widely used to follow the movement of synaptic vesicles in nerve terminals. The present review discusses {{the use of these}} optical methods to understand the regulation of exocytosis and endocytosis of synaptic vesicles. The maintenance of neurotransmission depends on the constant recycling of synaptic vesicles and important insights have been gained by visualization of vesicles with the vital dye FM 1 - 43. A number of questions related to the control of recycling of synaptic vesicles by prolonged stimulation and the role of calcium to <b>control</b> <b>membrane</b> internalization are now being addressed. It is expected that optical monitoring of presynaptic activity coupled to appropriate genetic models will contribute to the understanding of membrane traffic in synaptic terminals...|$|E

The concept is that of using electrostatic forces to tension a thin conducting membrane and to maintain it in a precision antenna shape. The ECMM is an adaptive structure which maintains surface quality despite errors in construction, irregularities of materials, solar heating, and onboard disturbances. The combination of high gain and low mass makes the ECMM ideally suited for space applications...|$|R
