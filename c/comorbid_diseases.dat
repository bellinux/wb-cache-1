50|$|The {{number of}} <b>comorbid</b> <b>diseases</b> {{increases}} with age. Comorbidity increases by 10% in ages up to 19 years, up to 80% in people of ages 80 and older. According to data by M. Fortin, {{based on the}} analysis of 980 case histories, taken from daily practice of a family doctor, the spread of comorbidity is from 69% in young patients, up to 93% among middle aged people and up to 98% patients of older age groups. At {{the same time the}} number of chronic diseases varies from 2.8 in young patients and 6.4 among older patients.|$|E
50|$|Even when caught early, {{aggressive}} treatment is required (Bobba). Antibiotics are proven to cure Emphysematous cystitis {{over time and}} {{reduce the amount of}} gas inside the bladder wall. Prognosis is poor if antibiotics are not used to treat the patient. Additional treatment consists of urinary drainage and good control of blood glucose. The treatment of underlying <b>comorbid</b> <b>diseases,</b> such as diabetes, is extremely important because they can intensify the infection (Gheonea, Bondari). Hyperbaric oxygen is an effective treatment, and has cured some cases in as little as 48 hours. Although it is unclear as to how gas formation occurs in emphysematous cystitis, it’s dependant on whether or not the patient has contributing diseases (Mccabe). Gas formation in diabetic patients diagnosed with Emphysematous cystitis has been determined to occur due to the production of carbon dioxide {{as a result of the}} fermentation of the high concentrations of glucose. Gas formation in nondiabetic patients is most likely due the breaking down of urinary lactulose and tissue proteins. Inflammation caused by infection increases pressure and decreases circulation, which provides the perfect environment for bacteria to produce gas (Sereno).|$|E
50|$|The age of {{the patient}} and {{caregiver}} can affect the psychological effect that cancer has on them. However, which age group of caregivers (young adult, middle age or elderly) are more distressed by caregiving is still unconfirmed. Some suggest that younger caregivers suffer from more psychological distress, but others suggest that elderly caregivers are more at risk for distress. This may {{be a function of}} the phase of the cancer trajectory that caregivers are undergoing: studies tend to find high distress amongst younger caregivers in the acute and chronic phases, and high distress amongst elderly caregivers in the resolution (specifically, bereavement) phase of caregiving. Elderly caregivers are also at greater risk for negative effects on their physical health than are younger caregivers. Older caregivers {{are more likely to have}} comorbid health conditions and decreased physical ability. In relation to their psychological health, older caregivers may be at higher risk because of a higher likelihood of social isolation than younger caregivers. However, older caregivers are usually more satisfied with their role than are younger caregivers. Among women, this may be explained by the finding that younger female caregivers tend to perceive demands on their time due to role strain more negatively. Role strain tends to be more severe for later middle age caregivers due to their many responsibilities with family and work. Caregivers in this age group may also be more prone to emotional distress, and ultimately, a decreased quality of life. This is because the caregivers are at higher risk of experiencing social isolation, career interruption, and a lack of time for themselves, their families and their friends. The {{age of the}} cancer patient can also affect the physical and psychological burden on caregivers. Given that the highest percentage of individuals with cancer are older adults, caregiving for older cancer patients can be complicated by other <b>comorbid</b> <b>diseases</b> such as dementia. The spouses of elderly cancer patients are likely to be elderly themselves, which may cause the caregiving to take an even more significant toll on their well being.|$|E
40|$|The {{treatment}} of Depressive Disorders {{in patients with}} chronic <b>comorbid</b> <b>disease</b> states warrants careful consideration of the risk-benefit ratio pertaining to the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the antidepressant being considered, against the physiological susceptibilities of the patient; potential drug-drug interactions and depressive symptoms. The primary {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the relationship between Depressive Disorders and the most frequently diagnosed chronic <b>comorbid</b> <b>disease</b> states in a depressed South African study population; and to comment on the appropriateness of antidepressants prescribed to these patients. This retrospective drug utilisation study consisted of two parts: the first part focused on the prevalence of the most frequently diagnosed chronic comorbidities in a depressed South African population (N = 21 171). The three most prevalent chronic <b>comorbid</b> <b>disease</b> states were Hypertension (52. 87 percent), Lipid Disorders (20. 40 percent) and Arthritis (16. 70 percent). The second part of the study included an assessment of the antidepressants prescribed to depressed patients in 2004 (N = 6 150). Emphasis was placed on the suitability of antidepressants selected for depressed adult patients (18 years of age and older) with comorbid Hypertension, Lipid Disorders or Arthritis. SSRIs were prescribed most frequently to the depressed patients during 2004 (59. 67 percent). SSRIs are the suggested first-line treatments for depressed patients with multiple chronic <b>comorbid</b> <b>disease</b> states. However, of the SSRIs, fluoxetine has the least favourable pharmacokinetic profile and was found to be the antidepressant prescribed most often. Amitriptyline, which was the TCA prescribed most frequently, produces the greatest degree of anticholinergic, sedative and hypotensive effects, relative to other agents in the same antidepressant class. Thus, it is not recommended as a first-line antidepressant, especially in depressed patients with comorbidities.

The interaction between <b>comorbid</b> <b>diseases</b> and breast cancer, however, has not been well-studied. Methods: From Danish nationwide medical registries, we identified all breast cancer patients between 45 and 85 years of age diagnosed from 1994 to 2008. Women without breast cancer were matched to the breast cancer patients on specific <b>comorbid</b> <b>diseases</b> included in the Charlson comorbidity Index (CCI).

Results: The study included 47, 904 breast cancer patients and 237, 938 matched comparison women. In the first year, the strongest interaction between comorbidity and breast cancer was observed in breast cancer patients with a CCI score of >= 4, which accounted for 29 deaths per 1000 person-years. Among individual comorbidities, dementia interacted strongly with breast cancer and accounted for 148 deaths per 1000 person-years within one year of follow-up. There was little interaction between comorbidity and breast cancer during one to five years of follow-up. Conclusions: There was substantial interaction between <b>comorbid</b> <b>diseases</b> and breast cancer, affecting mortality.

40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine {{clinical}} features and treatment modality approaches in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), particularly in those aged 80 years and older. Using databases available at Mito Kyodo General Hospital (Japan), the medical records of COPD patients between April 2009 and December 2011 were retrospectively reviewed. The patient population was divided into three age groups; less than 70 years (the < 70 age group), between 70 - 79 years (the 70 - 79 age group) and 80 years or older (the ≥ 80 age group). Demographic data, as well as the efficacy and safety of tiotropium, were compared between the three groups. Patients in the ≥ 80 age group comprised 35. 6 % of the study population with COPD (n= 174). The ≥ 80 and 70 - 79 age groups demonstrated a higher proportion of <b>comorbid</b> <b>disease</b> compared with the < 70 age group. A subjective improvement of dyspnea on effort as well as no additional adverse effects were observed in the ≥ 80 age group, similar to the other two age groups.

The prevalence of comorbidity described in patients with type 2 diabetes (T 2 D) shows a wide range depending on the population selected and the <b>comorbid</b> <b>diseases</b> studied. This exploratory study aimed to establish comorbidity rates in an unselected primary-care population of patients with T 2 D. Methods This was a cohort study of 714 adult patients with newly diagnosed T 2 D within the study period (1985 - 2007) in a practice-based research network in the Netherlands. The main outcome measures were prevalence and incidence density rates of chronic <b>comorbid</b> <b>diseases</b> and disease clusters. All chronic disease episodes registered in the practice-based research network were considered as comorbidities. We categorised comorbidity into 'concordant' (that is, shared aetiology, risk factors, and management plans with diabetes) and 'discordant' comorbidity. Prevalence and incidence density were assessed for both categories of comorbidity. Results The mean observation period was 17. 3 years. At the time of diabetes diagnosis, 84. 6 % of the patients had one or more chronic comorbid disease of 'any type', 70. 6 % had one or more discordant comorbid disease, and 48. 6 % and 27. 2 % had three or more chronic <b>comorbid</b> <b>diseases</b> of 'any type' or of 'discordant only', respectively. A quarter of those without any comorbid disease {{at the time of}} their diabetes diagnosis developed at least one comorbid disease in the first year afterwards.

40|$|Background. Laparoendoscopic {{rendezvous}} (LERV) {{technique is}} emerging as an attractive treatment option for concomitant cholecystocholedocholithiasis. In this paper, we report our experience in performing the LERV technique in patients with unusual presentations in terms of anatomical difficulty, pregnancy, multiple <b>comorbid</b> <b>diseases,</b> and postlaparotomy. We aim to highlight {{the effectiveness of the}} LERV technique in some clinical situations where conventional methods would fail or carry high risks in adequately managing concomitant cholecystocholedocholithiasis. Methods. Four patients diagnosed to have concomitant cholecystocholedocholithiasis with associated difficult presentation or <b>comorbid</b> <b>diseases</b> were treated using the LERV technique. One patient presented with difficult anatomy where ERCP failed at initial attempts. Another patient was pregnant (first trimester). A third patient had complex <b>comorbid</b> <b>diseases</b> (bronchial asthma, hypertension, congestive heart failure, and end-stage renal disease on regular hemodialysis). A fourth patient had previous laparotomy and sigmoidectomy for diverticular disease and had severe hospital phobia. Results. All patients tolerated the LERV technique very well; no intraoperative occurrence was reported. The mean operative time was 86. 3 ± 17. 2 minutes; mean time of the endoscopic part was 29. 4 ± 3. 57 minutes. The mean blood loss was 44. 3 ± 18. 2 [*]mL (range 20 – 85). Residual stone, postoperative complications, postoperative morbidity, and postoperative mortality were 0 (0 %). Postoperative short hospital stay was reported in all patients, average 3 days (range 2 – 4). Conclusion. LERV procedure is a safe and effective treatment option for the management of concomitant cholecystocholedocholithiasis, even in difficult situations where other methods would fail or carry high risks, or in patients presenting with severe <b>comorbid</b> <b>diseases</b> or pregnancy. This procedure may emerge as an attractive alternative option for high-risk patients. A patient’s wishes may also influence the selection of this procedure.

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to define the {{demographic}} and clinical characteristics of geriatric patients who referred to physical medicine and rehabilitation (PMR) outpatient clinics and to detect the differences between these characteristics in regard to age, sex and education level. Materials and Methods: 820 patients over 65 years old who attended 20 outpatient clinics were included in the study. In addition to demographic data, the complaints, <b>comorbid</b> <b>diseases,</b> pain levels, drugs being used, exercise and medical status of the patients were recorded. The effects of age, sex and education level on complaints, <b>comorbid</b> <b>diseases</b> and exercise habits were investigated. Results: The mean age of the patients was 71. 7 ± 5. 5 years. 16. 7 % were living alone, 61. 7 % were housewives. 86 % of the patients had one or more <b>comorbid</b> <b>diseases</b> - hypertension, gastric problems and heart disease were mostly encountered. The most common complaints were joint pain, fatigue and widespread body pain. The average number of pills taken per day was 4. 02 ± 0. 9 (median 4), and the VAS pain score was 5. 1 ± 1. 3 (median 5. 0). History of falling was present in 16. 5 % of patients. 30. 1 % were routinely walking and 15. 4 % were performing exercise at home. In patients over 75 years, vertebral pain and deformity, urinary incontinence, eye problem, difficulty in swallowing, decrease in hearing, as well as balance and teeth problems were significantly more frequent than in younger subjects. Conclusion: Aged population constitutes most of the PMR outpatient clinic patients. Considering <b>comorbid</b> <b>diseases,</b> high number of daily taken drugs and falls, PMR specialist should be cautious in prescribing drugs and planning rehabilitation programme. For independence in activities of daily living in this age group, besides the musculoskeletal system, all other systems should be evaluated and a comprehensive geriatric rehabilitation programme should be constructed.

40|$|Non-cardiac surgery {{has a low}} overall {{mortality}} but {{is associated}} with a large number of deaths because so many procedures are performed. Most deaths occur in a group of patients who are at high risk because of advanced age, <b>comorbid</b> <b>disease,</b> or major surgery (hospital mortality rate 12 %). More effective systems can improve quality of perioperative care and may improve survival while reducing healthcare costs. Further research is needed to identify the most effective approaches to perioperative medicine for high risk patients. Routine audit of outcomes after all non-cardiac surgery is urgently needed...|$|R
