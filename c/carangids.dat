25|$|The {{species is}} {{predominantly}} coastal, schooling in inshore waters {{to a depth}} of 80 m, often in large embayments with mangroves or over coral reefs. Like a number of <b>carangids,</b> juvenile yellowtail scad are known to congregate around floating objects, including jellyfish medusae, as well as manmade structures. In Kaneohe Bay, jellyfish medusae disappeared from the bay, causing the fish to switch from natural objects to manmade ones, causing concern for recruitment of the species in the future.|$|E
25|$|The bumpnose {{trevally}} {{is usually}} founds {{in small groups}} of two or more, swimming along beaches where they take prey which consists of shrimp, small crabs, and fish. Studies on the North West Shelf of Australia have found the species often aggregates with other <b>carangids,</b> particularly Carangoides humerosus, Ulua aurochs, and Selaroides leptolepis, and together these make up {{a large proportion of}} the resident fish fauna. Reproduction in the species is very poorly known, with young fish often showing up in South Africa during summer.|$|E

40|$|A recent {{examination}} of newly obtained specimens of philometrid nematodes (Philometridae) parasitising <b>carangid</b> and serranid fishes off New Caledonia, South Pacific, revealed {{the presence of}} several nematodes of the genus Philometra Costa, 1845, including three new species: P. austropacifica n. sp. (males and females) from the ovary of Alepes vari (Carangidae), P. piscaria n. sp. (males) from the ovary of Epinephelus coioides (Serranidae), and P. selaris n. sp. (males) probably from the abdominal cavity (found in washings) of Selar crumenophthalmus (Carangidae). The new species are characterised mainly by the length {{and structure of the}} spicules and gubernaculum, body size, their location in the host and the type of host. Philometra austropacifica n. sp. is the first known nominal gonad-infecting species of Philometra parasitising a <b>carangid</b> fish. In addition, the gravid female of P. fasciati Moravec & Justine, 2008 from the ovary of Epinephelus fasciatus (Serranidae) is described for the first time. <b>Carangid</b> host fish were identified by both morphology and DNA barcoding...|$|R
50|$|A single {{species has}} been {{identified}} the fossil record, Alectis simus (Stinton, 1979), from the Eocene period of England. It was found alongside a number of extinct and extant <b>carangid</b> genera including Caranx and Usacaranx (extinct).|$|R
25|$|Studies {{around these}} {{platforms}} has found blue runner feed with equal intensity during both day and night, with larger prey such as fish taken preferentially at night, with smaller crustaceans {{taken during the}} day. Blue runner are {{one of a number}} of <b>carangids</b> known to forage in small schools alongside actively feeding Spinner Dolphins (Stenella longirostris), taking advantage of any scraps of food left by the feeding mammals, or any organisms displaced while they forage. The species is also known to eat the dolphins excrement. As well as being important predators, they are also important prey to many larger species including fishes, birds and dolphins.|$|E
25|$|Juvenile and subadult bluefin {{trevally}} {{have been}} recorded in estuaries in several locations, and generally occupy large, open estuaries up to the middle reaches of the system. These estuaries are often lined by mudflats and mangroves, however the species rarely enters these shallow waters. Individuals of between 40 and 170mm {{have been recorded}} in South African estuaries, where they are the least tolerant carangid to the brackish and freshwater conditions of these systems. Bluefin trevally can tolerate salinities of between 6.0 and 35 ‰, and only occupy clear, low turbidity waters. There is evidence the species is only resident in these estuaries for short periods. The species is also absent from coastal lakes that many other <b>carangids</b> are known from.|$|E
25|$|The golden {{trevally}} is a diurnal foraging carnivore which, unlike other <b>carangids,</b> does not normally seek out individual prey items. The highly protractile mouth {{possessed by the}} species is used to form a tube to suck prey out of both reef- and algae-dominated habitats, as well as filtering organisms out of sandy substrates. In the latter case, both sand and any prey items are taken into the mouth and filtered through the gill rakers; sand is expelled, while small organisms are trapped and swallowed. The species takes a variety of prey including crustaceans such as shrimp, crabs, and amphipods, as well as molluscs and small fish. Golden trevally found inhabiting a mangrove swamp {{were found to have}} fed exclusively on fish (Mugil curema), suggesting the species also actively hunts down fleeing prey. A laboratory study using only four individuals being fed found that one fish will take the 'lead' position in this situation while another will attack the other fish in the school, apparently in competition for food.|$|E

Ichthyoplankton was collected during four expeditions from the Northeast Exclusive Economic Zone. Six species (Trachurus lathami, Decapterus punctatus, Chloroscombrus chrysurus, Selene setapinnis, Selene vomer and Elagatis bipinnulata) and Caranx- Carangoides complex were identified. D. punctatus was the species most abundant (52 % of the total), with higher abundance during the Period 3, while the Period 2 was the period of low abundance.

Geometric and biostratigraphic calibration with outcrop and borehole sections close to the Vrasenedok allows the concretion level to be positioned within the upper middle part of the Boom Clay Formation, respectively around septaria-level S 110 according to the dinoflagellate cyst correlation and around septaria-level S 150 according to geometric extrapolation. The discovery of this fish skull illustrates a specific step in the evolution of <b>carangid</b> fishes, allowing estimation of the nature and rate of their evolution during the last 50 million years...|$|R
25|$|The {{blue runner}} {{is a highly}} {{important}} species to commercial fisheries throughout parts of its range. Due to its abundance, it {{may be one of}} the primary species in a fishery. The availability of fisheries statistics for the species is variable throughout its range, with the Americas having separate statistics kept for the species, while in Africa and Europe it is lumped in with other <b>carangids</b> in statistics. In the Americas, recent catch data suggests an increased amount of the species is being taken (or reported), with the 2006 and 2007 catch averaging between 6000 and 7000 tonnes, while during the 1980s and 1990s, there was rarely an annual catch greater than 1000 tonnes. Research on the fisheries of local regions has shown how important the fish is to certain fisheries. Artisanal fisheries in Santa Catarina Island have shown blue runner to be third most important and abundant species, making up 5.6% of landings, or 4.38 tonnes. Even subsistence fisheries at the edge of its range in Brazil show a catch of 388kg in two years from beach seines. Throughout its range the blue runner is commercially taken by haul seines, lampara nets, purse seines, gill nets, and hook and line methods. The fish is sold at market either fresh, dried, smoked or as fishmeal, oil or bait.|$|E
25|$|The {{blue runner}} is {{moderately}} large in size, growing {{to a maximum}} confirmed length of 70cm and 5.05kg in mass, but is more common at lengths less than 35cm. The blue runner is morphologically similar {{to a number of}} other <b>carangids,</b> having an elongated, moderately compressed body with dorsal and ventral profiles of approximately equal ity and a slightly pointed snout. The posterior section of the eye is covered by a moderately well developed adipose eyelid, and the posterior extremity of the jaw is vertically under the center of the eye. The dorsal fin is in two parts, the first consisting of 8 spines and the second of 1 spine followed by 22 to 25 soft rays. The anal fin consists of 2 anteriorly detached spines followed by 1 spine and 19 to 21 soft rays. The pectoral fins become more falcate with age, having 21 to 23 rays, and are slightly longer than the head. The lateral line has a pronounced but short anterior arch, with the curved section intersecting the straight section below the spine of the second dorsal fin. The straight section contains 0 to 7 scales followed by 46 to 56 very strong scutes, with bilateral keels present on the caudal peduncle. There are a total of 86 to 98 scales and scutes over the entire lateral line. The chest is completely scaled. The upper jaw contains an irregular series of outer canines with an inner band of small, regularly spaced teeth, while the lower jaw contains a single band of small teeth. The species has 35 to 42 gill rakers in total; 10 to 14 on the upper limb and 25 to 28 on the lower limb, with this the only feature that differs between C. crysos and C. caballus. There are 25 vertebrae present.|$|E
25|$|The {{crevalle jack}} {{is one of}} the most {{abundant}} large <b>carangids</b> in the Atlantic Ocean, with at least two systematic studies placing it within the top five most abundant species of that region, namely lagoons in Nigeria and Chiapas, Mexico. Seasonal movements are known from both the American and African coastlines, with both juveniles and adults appearing to migrate. In North America, young individuals recruited to northern estuaries are known to move to warmer tropical waters at the onset of winter to escape possible hypothermia. At least one hypothermia-driven mass mortality of 200 crevalle jacks has been reported from the Slocum River in Massachusetts, indicating low-temperature mortality is a major concern for north-ranging groups of the species, with temperatures below 9.0°C apparently being lethal to the fish. This applies not only to river dwelling fish, but also to marine migrants which linger too long in the temperate regions during winter. In Nigeria, and presumably other parts of Africa, the species appears to migrate seasonally, possibly to take advantage of prey, with the fish arriving in Nigeria during September to November. The species is more active during the day than the night, with larger catches in fisheries taken during the day, also. The crevalle jack is a schooling species for most of its life, forming moderately large to very large, fast-moving schools. At larger sizes, the fish become more solitary and move to the deeper offshore reefs. Evidence from laboratory studies indicates crevalle jack are able to coordinate their feeding and spawning aggregations over coral reefs based on the release of dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) from the reef. DMSP is a naturally occurring chemical produced by marine algae and, to a lesser extent, corals and their symbiotic zooxanthellae. Field studies have also shown the species increases in abundance with increased levels of DMSP over coral reefs.|$|E
40|$|We {{present data}} on ichthyoplankton distribution, abundance, and {{seasonality}} and supporting environmental information for four species of coastal pelagics {{from the family}} Carangidae: blue runner Caranx crysos, Atlantic bumper Chloroscombrus chrysurus, round scad Decapterus punctatus, and rough scad Trachurus lathami. Data are from 1982 and 1983 cruises off Louisiana sponsored by the Southeastern Area Monitoring and Assessment Program (SEAMAP). Bioprofiles on reproductive biology, early life history, meristics, adult distribution, and fisheries characteristics are also presented for these species. Maximum abundances of larval blue runner, Atlantic bumper, and round scad were found in July inside the 4 O-m isobath, although {{during the rest of}} the cruises these species were rarely found together. Larval Atlantic bumper were captured in June and July only; blue runner in May, June, and July; and round scad in all seasons. Atlantic bumper larvae, concentrated mostly off western Louisiana, were by far the most abundant <b>carangid</b> in 1982 and 1983. Larval blue runner were the second most abundant summer-spawned <b>carangid</b> in 1982 and 1983, but their abundance and depth distribution varied considerably between years. Relative abundance of larval round scad off Louisiana was low, and they were captured only west of the Mississippi River delta, although they are reported to dominate <b>carangid</b> populations in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. Rough scad were primarily winter/spring and outer-shelf (40 - 182 m) spawners. They ranked third in overall abundance, but were the most abundant target <b>carangid</b> on the outer shelf. Ecological parameters such as surface salinity, temperature, and station depth are presented from capture sites for recently hatched larvae < 2. 5 mm notochord length, except round scad) as well as for all sizes of fish below 14 mm standard length.

25|$|Carangoides {{was created}} by Pieter Bleeker in 1851 to {{accommodate}} a species of <b>carangid</b> fish, although the species he created the genus for is unknown. To rectify this, Caranx praeustus was selected to be the type species of the genus. <b>Carangid</b> classification was initially very difficult, with many genera and species described, {{many of which were}} synonymous. Later reviews of the family eventually placed 21 species into Carangoides, leaving a number of genera synonymous with it. Carangoides takes priority over these other genera because its type species, Caranx praeustus, was described by an unknown author before the other species and genera were erected. The species of the genus are often referred to as jacks or trevallies, and sometimes more specifically as 'island jacks'. The name Carangoides is derived from the French carangue, meaning 'fish of the Caribbean'.|$|R
25|$|The {{torpedo scad}} is a {{moderately}} large fish, growing {{to a maximum}} recorded length of 80cm and a weight of 4 kg, however is more common between 30 and 40cm length. It is rare at lengths greater than 80cm. The species is often considered to have a rather unusual body form, having features superficially similar to tunas, mackerels and other <b>carangids.</b> The body is elongate and subcylindrical, becoming highly compressed toward the tail and caudal fin, with a marked median keel on the caudal peduncle. The dorsal and ventral profiles of the fish are nearly evenly , with the two profiles intersecting at the pointed snout. There are two separate dorsal fins; the first consisting of 8 moderately high spines and the second of a single spine followed by 18 to 20 soft rays. The anal fin consists of two anteriorally detached spines followed by a single spine attached to 16 or 17 soft rays. In both the dorsal and anal fins, the posterior 7-10 rays are detached and form a series of diagnostic finlets. The pectoral fin is strongly falcate (scythe shaped), and extends beyond {{the origin of the}} second dorsal fin. The lateral line is strongly arched over a short length anteriorly, with the intersection of the curved and straight sections vertically below the fourth or fifth spine of the first dorsal fin. The curved section of the lateral line has 21 to 29 scales, while the straight section has 51 to 59 very large scutes. The breast is devoid of scales in a triangular patch to about one-third the distance to the pectoral fin base. The eye has a well-developed adipose eyelid which nearly completely covers the eye. The upper jaw contains small villiform teeth, with some outer teeth moderately enlarged, while the lower jaw has a single row of small teeth. There are 26 to 32 gill rakers and 24 vertebrae.|$|E
25|$|The bluefin {{trevally}} is a schooling {{species as}} a juvenile, transitioning {{to a more}} solitary fish with well defined home ranges as an adult. Adults do school to form spawning aggregations or temporarily while hunting, with evidence from laboratory studies indicates bluefin trevally are able to coordinate these aggregations over coral reefs based on the release of dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) from the reef. DMSP is a naturally occurring chemical produced by marine algae {{and to a lesser}} extent corals and their symbiotic zooxanthellae. The number of fish present in an area is also influenced by tidal factors and possibly the abundance of prey and other environmental factors. Tracking studies in Hawaii have found bluefin trevally patrol back and forth along a home range of patch reef walls during the day, only stopping for variable periods where major depth changes or discontinuities in the reef were present. Several fish patrol the same reef patch, reversing direction where the others do. While most fish patrol the one reef, some have been observed to make excursions to nearby reefs, before returning to their home reef later. Night time movements are less extensive than daytime movements, with the trevally moving rapidly between several small reef sections, before slowing down and milling in one patch for around an hour. The fish living in a particular region congregate in one area at night, before returning to their individual daytime range during the day. The reason for this congregation is unclear, but may be important to the social structure of the species. Long term studies have found the fish may range up to 10.2km over several months, however is much less restricted in its movements than its relative, the giant trevally. A Hawaiian biomass study found the species to be one of the most abundant large predators in the islands, however it is less abundant in the heavily exploited Main Hawaiian Islands compared to the remote Northwest Hawaiian Islands. The main difference in these populations was the relative lack of large adult fish in the inhabited areas compared to the remote, unfished regions. A study on <b>carangids</b> caught during a fishing tournament in Hawaii found the bluefin trevally is the most common trevally species taken, accounting for over 80% of the carangid catch. The authors note that this may not only reflect its abundance, but also it vulnerability to specific fishing methods used in the tournament. Apart from the typical predator-prey relationship the species shows (described later), an individual of the species has been seen to rub itself against the skin of a Galapagos shark, apparently to rid itself of parasites. This behaviour is also observed in rainbow runner and is a rare example of a commensal cleaner relationship where the cleaner does not gain anything.|$|E
2500|$|Fish can be obligate or facultative shoalers. Obligate shoalers, such as tunas, {{herrings}} and anchovy, [...] {{spend all}} of their time shoaling or schooling, and become agitated if separated from the group.

25|$|The {{species was}} first scientifically {{described}} by the American ichthyologist Theodore Gill, who named the species Carangoides dorsalis based on the holotype taken from {{the west coast of}} Central America. This name and description was published in the Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, in which Gill one year previously described another <b>carangid,</b> Vomer dorsalis. The state of <b>carangid</b> taxonomy at the time was rather confusing, with many synonymous genera and species present in the literature, and Vomer dorsalis was soon moved to Caranx, as was Carangoides dorsalis, creating a taxonomic homonym. To address this problem, the American ichthyologists David Starr Jordan and Charles Henry Gilbert in 1883 created the name Caranx otrynter as a replacement for the species originally named Carangoides dorsalis, basing their description on a new holotype specimen taken from Mazatlán, Mexico.|$|R
