Galvez quickly reappointed former commander Francisco Cruzat, who arrived in St. Louis with ammunition, weapons and supplies to defend the town. In late 1780, Cruzat sent an expedition force from St. Louis to attack British forces at Fort St. Joseph, which successfully destroyed any future British plans to attack St. Louis or other Mississippi outposts.|$|E

The low fertility rate of cows and substantial lags and future feedback between fertility and consumption decisions cause the demographic structure of the herd to respond cyclically to exogenous shocks in demand and production costs. Known demographic parameters of cattle imply sharp numerical benchmarks for the resulting dynamic system and closely compare with independent econometric time-series estimates over the 1875 - 1990 period.

40|$|Economists have {{recently}} begun to consider the questions raised by the ecological concept of resilience – {{a measure of the}} degree to which a system can be perturbed before it switches from one stability domain to another. At a theoretical level, it has been argued that the loss of resilience in an ecological-economic system involves a change in its long-run productive potential, but no consideration has yet been given to the empirical investigation of this. This paper discusses an econometric approach to the problem, using the example of semi-arid rangelands. The long-run productive potential of the system is regarded as an unobserved state variable, change in which is irreversible or at least only slowly reversible. It is estimated by applying the extended (nonlinear) Kalman filter. The paper illustrates the approach using data from Botswana for the period 1965 – 1993. The maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters associated with the loss of resilience mechanism are non-zero. They indicate a small loss of resilience event at the end of the long drought in the 1980 s. However, these parameters are very imprecisely estimated and are therefore statistically insignificant. We find that the sensitivity of the system to exogenous shocks varies with fluctuations in both economic and non-economic parameters. Contrary to what is usually thought to be the case, the sensitivity of the system to exogenous shocks is only weakly affected by variations in offtake prices, but is very strongly affected by variations in the cost of herd maintenance. This suggests that offtake prices may be a weak tool for controlling the size of <b>cattle</b> <b>stocks</b> and preventing a loss of resilience. On the other hand, taxes on <b>cattle</b> <b>stocks</b> or grazing fees may be very effective. Copyright Kluwer Academic Publishers 2000 agroecosystems, resilience, technological change,...|$|R
40|$|Dairy cattle {{production}} {{is an important}} industry of the animal production sector and has an important position in Turkish economy with its employment rate and values of products. However, a decrease in total cattle population, number of cows, and milk production has been observed in recent years. During the period 1990 – 2003, <b>cattle</b> <b>stocks</b> in Turkey decreased from 12 173 000 to 10 400 000, which was a decrease by 14. 57 %. During the same period, the number of cows also decreased from 5 892 550 to 4 200 000. In spite of a 25. 17 % increase in milk pro-duction per cow, milk production decreased from 9 614 415 to 8 160 000 t/year due to the decrease in {{the total number of}} cows (FAO, 2003). Even though milk production per cow has in-creased in the last ten years, milk production per cow is still rather low compared to that of European Union (EU) countries. Milk production per cow is a quarter of the EU countries (Anonymous, 2001). The relatively low milk yield and the decrease in <b>cattle</b> <b>stocks</b> coupled with an increase in per capita income and population resulted in supply short-age in Turkey. This situation becomes more criti-cal with Turkey’s accession to EU because it seems that the Turkish dairy production sector is {{not in a position to}} compete with European counterparts.
