40|$|Few studies exist {{describing}} unicompartmental osteoarthritic knee kinematics. Moreover, {{the role}} of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in the determination of knee kinematics has not been fully described. The objective of the current study was to analyze the in vivo kinematics of knees with medial osteoarthritis (OA) and intact ACL during closed and open chained motion. Eight patients scheduled for UKA diagnosed with primary medial OA underwent knee CT-scans and video-fluoroscopy. Fluoroscopic analysis included stair <b>climbing,</b> <b>chair</b> rising and leg extension. Three-dimensional bone positions were obtained from each image by iterative procedures using a CAD-model-based shape-matching technique. Patterns of axial rotation and anterior-posterior (AP) motion of the medial and lateral femoral condyle were obtained with specific software. The femur reported an overall external rotation relative to the tibia from extension to flexion in all tasks. Average AP translation of the medial femoral condyle were smaller in open-chained tasks than in weight-bearing conditions. Average AP motion of the lateral femoral condyle reported an overall posterior translation with knee flexion. The absent natural "screw-home" mechanism and the lack of medial condyle posterior translation was explained by bone-cartilage defects and meniscal degeneration. Relevant findings were the kinematic pattern differences between weight-bearing and open chained activities, suggesting that in biphasic muscle contraction and unloaded conditions, the function of the cruciate ligaments was not physiological. The kinematics of knees with medial OA and intact ACL differed from healthy knees. Few studies exist describing unicompartmental osteoarthritic knee kinematics.

40|$|Purpose: Posterior stabilised (PS) total knee {{arthroplasty}} (TKA) {{design development}} {{that focused on}} restoring normal knee kinematics {{was followed by the}} introduction of reason-guided motion designs. Although all PS fixed-bearing knee designs were thought to have similar kinematics, reports show they have differing incidences and magnitudes of posterior femoral rollback and axial rotation. In this retrospective comparative study between two guided-motion total knee systems, we hypothesised that kinematic pattern has an influence on clinical and functional outcomes. Methods: This study represents the continuation of a previously reported clinical and kinematics analysis. We retrospectively reviewed 347 patients treated with two different TKA designs: Scorpio NRG (Stryker Orthopedics) and Journey Bi-Cruciate Stabilised (BCS) knee system (Smith & Nephew). Two hundred and eighty-one patients were assessed clinically. Patients were divided into groups according to implanted TKA. Clinical evaluation with the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) questionnaire was performed. Fifteen Scorpio NRG and 16 Journey BCS patients underwent video fluoroscopy during stair <b>climbing,</b> <b>chair</b> rising/sitting and step up/down at six months of follow-up. Results: At an average 29 months of clinical follow-up, patients with Journey BCS TKAs reported better clinical results. Stiffness was more frequently reported in the Journey group (5. 2 % vs 1. 2 %), whereas anterior knee pain was observed in the Scorpio NRG group (1. 9 %) only. Both prosthetic models reported different posterior translation of the medial and lateral contact points (CP) in all analysed motor tasks during knee flexion (BCS 10 - 18 mm; NRG Scorpio 2 - 3 mm). Both designs produced progressive external rotation of the femoral component relative to the tibia during flexion. Conclusions: Journey BCS showed statistically significant better KOOS results. The higher posterior femoral rollback observed in the kinematic assessment of this design, associated with a better patellofemoral design, may be the reason for better clinical outcome. The reported cases of stiffness and anterolateral joint pain could be attributed to excessive medial and lateral tibiofemoral posterior translation. The NRG group demonstrated good axial rotation, but this was not coupled with physiological kinematic patterns. Patellofemoral pain can be explained by a less friendly femoral-groove design. TKA clinical-functional outcome and complications were highly influenced by the bearing geometry and kinematic pattern of prosthetic designs. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|E

40|$|The commercially {{available}} wheel chairs for amputees donot have the functionality for climbing staircases. In our project, we have designed a manually operated wheelchair that can travel on both plane terrains {{and also in}} the staircases. In our project, instead of using normal wheels we have used penta wheel. The steel rod is penta shaped and each rod is equally inclined of 72 ° from each other. At the time of climbing, one wheel that is the idle wheel will be in contact with the ground and the another wheel will be in contact with the stair. The motion takes place only when we pull the wheel chair backwards towards the staircase.

40|$|Abstract Background: After total knee {{arthroplasty}} (TKA) only 75 - 89 % {{of patients}} are satisfied. Because patient satisfaction {{is a prime}} goal of all orthopaedic procedures, optimization of patient satisfaction is of major importance. Factors related to patient satisfaction after TKA have been explored, but no studies have included two potentially relevant factors, i. e. the functional capacity of daily activities and actual daily activity. This present prospective study examines whether functional capacity and actual daily activity (in addition to an extensive set of potential factors) contribute to patient satisfaction six months after TKA. Methods: A total of 44 patients were extensively examined preoperatively and six months post surgery. Functional capacity was measured with three capacity tests, focusing on walking, stair <b>climbing,</b> and <b>chair</b> rising. Actual daily activity was measured in the patient's home situation {{by means of a}} 48 -hour measurement with an Activity Monitor. To establish which factors were related to patient satisfaction six months post surgery, logistic regression analyses were used to calculate odds ratios. Results: Preoperative and postoperative functional capacity and actual daily activity had no relation with patient satisfaction. Preoperatively, only self-reported mental functioning was positively related to patient satisfaction. Postoperatively, based on multivariate analysis, only fulfilled expectations regarding pain and experienced pain six months post surgery were related to patient satisfaction. Conclusions: Functional capacity and actual daily activity do not contribute to patient satisfaction after TKA. Patients with a better preoperative self-reported mental functioning, and patients who experienced less pain and had fulfilled expectations regarding pain postoperatively, were more often satisfied...|$|R
