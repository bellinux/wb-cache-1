40|$|Rendering {{refractive}} <b>caustics</b> from transparent {{objects on}} opaque objects is computationally intensive. This paper presents a fast rendering technique for transparent objects and refractive <b>caustics</b> due to transparent objects on the opaque object. To calculate {{the intensities of}} <b>caustics,</b> we set virtual planes around the opaque object and store the intensities of <b>caustics</b> on the virtual planes as textures. <b>Caustics</b> are then rendered by using these textures. Our implementation, which additionally uses a GPU accelerator, enables us to render refractive <b>caustics</b> at interactive frame rates. We demonstrate this interactive rendering additionally for translation, rotation of both transparent objects and opaque objects, {{as well as for}} changing light and viewing directions...|$|R

40|$|<b>Caustics</b> {{are natural}} {{phenomena}} in which nature concentrates {{the energy of}} waves. Although, they are known mostly in optics, <b>caustics</b> are intrinsic to all wave phenomena. For example, studies show that fluctuations in the profile of an ocean floor can generate random <b>caustics</b> and focus the energy of tsunami waves. <b>Caustics</b> share many similarities to rogue waves, as they both exhibit heavy-tailed distribution, i. e. an overpopulation of large events. Linear Schrödinger-type equations are usually used to explain the wave dynamics of <b>caustics.</b> However, in that the wave amplitude increases dramatically in <b>caustics,</b> nonlinearity is inevitable in many systems. In this Letter, we investigate the effect of nonlinearity on the formation of optical <b>caustics.</b> We show experimentally that, in contrast to linear systems, even small phase fluctuations can generate strong <b>caustics</b> upon nonlinear propagation. We simulated our experiment based on the nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLSE) with Kerr-type nonlinearity, which describes the wave dynamics not only in optics, but also in some other physical systems such as oceans. Therefore, our results may also aid our understanding of ocean phenomena. Comment: 5 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{introduces}} analytical {{expressions of}} optical <b>caustics</b> r 1 and r 2 in micro-resonators (respectively called {{inner and outer}} <b>caustics</b> in micro-optics) in terms of radial and azimutal modal numbers n and l mutually. Such a theoretical study focuses on spherical micro-resonators and is carried out according to two complementary ways: Electromagnetic (E. M) approaches based respectively on an eigenvector problem resolution called modal field in integrated optics and an analogy with Quantum Mechanics (Q. M) using the notions of potential and geometric eikonal principle. Thus, using quantization and phase considerations, fundamental new formulation of <b>caustics,</b> that depend on the two previous quantum modal numbers simultaneously, have been shaped and confronted with numerical and graphical simulations. Both ways lead to results in good agreement (correlation coefficient superior to 0. 99) and allow us to specify the evolution of such <b>caustics</b> according to each modal number of the quantification; such an analytical <b>caustics</b> formulation involves a specific function f whose study is expanded for various values of n ranging from 1 to 500. Moreover a whole study of asymptotic behaviors of f-function and its inverse f- 1 on specific n and l values, {{directly related to the}} previous <b>caustics</b> expressions, is conducted, allowing the expansion of new analytical expressions of <b>caustics</b> in various limit cases and asymptotic behaviors. Then, the evolution of the positions of <b>caustics</b> in terms of modal numbers is interpreted, and the physical meanings of optical properties such as quasi-resonance, position and confinement of field with resonance, and associated electromagnetic fields are discussed...|$|R

5|$|White silver nitrate, AgNO3, is a {{versatile}} precursor {{to many other}} silver compounds, especially the halides, and is much less sensitive to light.

Silver nitrate is used in many ways in organic synthesis, e.g. for deprotection and oxidations.
