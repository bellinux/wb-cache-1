40|$|Abstract Background The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to investigate the effects of dietary plant-derived phytonutrients, carvacrol, cinnamaldehyde and <b>Capsicum</b> <b>oleoresin,</b> on the translational regulation of genes associated with immunology, physiology and metabolism using high-throughput microarray analysis and in vivo disease challenge model of avian coccidiosis. Methods In this study, we used nutrigenomics technology to investigate the molecular and genetic mechanisms of dietary modulation of host innate immunity and metabolism by three phytonutrients. To validate their immunomodulatory effects in a disease model, young broiler chickens fed a standard diet supplemented with three phytochemicals (carvacrol, cinnamaldehyde, and <b>Capsicum</b> <b>oleoresin)</b> from one day post-hatch were orally challenged with E. acervulina. The body weight gain and fecal oocyst production were used to evaluate coccidiosis disease parameters. Results Analysis of global gene expression profiles of intestinal tissues from phytonutrient-fed birds indicated that <b>Capsicum</b> <b>oleoresin</b> induced the most gene changes compared to the control group where many of these genes were associated with those of metabolism and immunity. The most reliable network induced by dietary cinnamaldehyde treatment was related with the functions of antigen presentation, humoral immune response, and inflammatory disease. Furthermore, dietary supplementation with these phytonutrients significantly protected broiler chickens against live coccidiosis challenge infection based on body weight and parasite fecundity. Conclusions The results of this study provide clear evidence to support the idea that plant-derived phytochemicals possess immune-enhancing properties in chickens and these new findings create a new possibility to develop effective drug-free alternative strategies for disease control for poultry infectious diseases. </p...|$|E

40|$|Aim: The {{effect of}} a {{specific}} combination (SC) of carvacrol, cinnamaldehyde, and <b>Capsicum</b> <b>oleoresin</b> was investigated on productive performance and immune response in broiler chickens. Materials and Methods: Six hundred one-day-old broiler chickens were randomly allocated into two groups for 5 weeks. The SC was supplemented at 100 ppm of ration (presence or absence). Results: Treatment of broiler chickens with the SC improved productive performance variables {{as compared with the}} blank control birds. It decreased total mortality, increased final body weight, weight gain, production number and decreased final feed conversion ratio (FCR) (P< 0. 05). The SC had a positive effect on carcass quality and enhanced HI titer against Newcastle disease (ND) virus vaccine, as compared to their untreated control group (P< 0. 05). The SC treated birds had higher values of intestinal diameter than the control ones.

40|$|Plant {{extracts}} (PE) are bioactive substances, {{extracted from}} some foods or traditional herbs. It {{has been known}} that PE possess antioxidant, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and perhaps immunoregulatory effects. The 3 studies below demonstrate the anti-inflammatory effects of PE in vitro {{and the effect of}} PE on immune function and disease resistance of pigs in vivo. The first study evaluated the effects of 7 PE (anethol, <b>capsicum</b> <b>oleoresin,</b> carvacrol, cinnamaldehyde, eugenol, garlic, and turmeric oleoresin) on cell viability and cytokine secretion of porcine alveolar macrophages (PAM) with or without lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. Without LPS stimulation, anethol (35 to 52 %) and <b>capsicum</b> <b>oleoresin</b> (39 to 59 %) increased cell viability of PAM, whereas other PE reduced (P < 0. 05) it. Anethol (12 to 34 %), <b>capsicum</b> <b>oleoresin</b> (53 to 92 %), or carvacrol (46 to 61 %) enhanced (P < 0. 05) the cell viability of LPS-treated PAM. Without LPS stimulation, anethol, <b>capsicum</b> <b>oleoresin,</b> cinnamaldehyde, or turmeric oleoresin stimulated TNF-?? secretion from PAM, whereas all PE except eugenol enhanced IL- 1 ?? secretion from PAM. However, all PE suppressed (P < 0. 05, 15 to 100 %) TNF-??, and carvacrol, cinnamaldehyde, eugenol, or garlic decreased (P < 0. 05, 31 to 95 %) IL- 1 ?? secretion from LPS-induced PAM. This study indicates all PE may have potent anti-inflammatory effects to varying degrees. Based on the in vitro study, three PE (<b>capsicum</b> <b>oleoresin</b> (CAP), garlic (GAR), and turmeric oleoresin (TUR)) showing diverse effects in vitro were selected to investigate their effects in vivo with two different disease models, Escherichia coli (E. coli) and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS). The second study evaluated the effects of 3 PE on diarrhea, immune response, intestina morphology, and growth performance of weaned pigs experimentally infected with a pathogenic F- 18 E. coli. The E. coli infection increased (P < 0. 05) white blood cells (WBC), tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -??, and hapotoglobin (Hp), and reduced overall ADG, G:F, and villi height (VH) of the small intestine as expected. In the challenged group, the supplementation of 10 mg of CAP, GAR, or TUR/kg diet reduced average diarrhea score from d 0 to 2 and d 6 to 11 and overall frequency of diarrhea, decreased (P < 0. 05) TNF-?? and Hp on d 5 and WBC and NEU on d 11, and increased (P < 0. 05) ileal VH on d 5, and tended (P = 0. 10) to increase jejunum VH and villi height:crypt depth compared with the control diet (CON). In the sham group, the PE treatments reduced (P < 0. 05) average DS from d 3 to 5, overall frequency of diarrhea, and Hp on d 5, compared with the CON. In addition, the 3 PE tested here showed different influences on the inflammatory mediators. In conclusion, the 3 PE tested reduced diarrhea, increased the VH of the small intestine, and affected total WBC, the populations of immune cells, and inflammatory mediators in E. coli-infected piglets, which may be beneficial to pig health. The third study was conducted {{to determine the effects of}} these 3 PE on growth efficiency and immune responses of pigs experimentally infected with PRRS virus (PRRSV). Infection of PRRSV reduced pig performance (P < 0. 01), but increased rectal temperature (RT), viral load (VL), and PRRSV specific antibody titer (AT), and serum inflammatory mediators (P < 0. 05). In addition, the PRRSV infection reduced (P < 0. 01) leukocytes on d 7, but increased (P < 0. 01) leukocytes on d 14. In the PRRSV challenged group, the PE treatments increased (P < 0. 05) growth efficiency, IL- 10, and Hp, but reduced (P < 0. 05) viral load, TNF-??, C-reactive protein, and RT on d 4 as compared to the CON. In the unchallenged group, all piglets were PRRSV negative during the overall period PI. The CAP increased (P < 0. 05) ADFI from d 0 to 7 and overall period PI, and final weight of piglets compared with the CON. Similar to the second study with E. coli infection, the 3 PE tested showed diverse effects on growth efficiency and inflammatory mediators of pigs infected with PRRSV, and TUR appeared to strengthen the immune responses and efficiency of pigs infected with PRRSV. In summary, PE are potent s in both in vitro and in vivo systems. Dietary supplementation of different PE for pigs may bring different influences to pigs infected with a bacterial or viral model. In the E. coli infection model, PE may bring the benefits by preventing over-stimulation of the immune system, while in the PRRSV infection model, PE may exhibit the benefits by boosting the host???s disease resistance in the early stage of disease and maintaining it in the later stage...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Some {{people in}} states of excited {{delirium}} die while in police custody. Emerging {{evidence suggests that}} physical restraint in certain positions may contribute to such deaths. In this study the authors determined the frequency of physical restraint among people {{in a state of}} excited delirium who died unexpectedly. METHODS: The authors reviewed the records of 21 cases of unexpected death in people with excited delirium, which were investigated by the Office of the Chief Coroner for Ontario between 1988 and 1995. Eyewitness testimony, findings during postmortem examinations, clinical history, toxicological data and other official documents describing the events surrounding the deaths were analyzed. Specific reference was made to documented eyewitness testimony of restraint method, body position and use of <b>capsicum</b> <b>oleoresin</b> (pepper) spray. Because cocaine was detected in the blood of some of these people during the postmortem examination, the role of cocaine in excited delirium was examined by comparing the cocaine levels in these cases with levels in 2 control groups: 19 people who died from acute cocaine intoxication and 21 people who had used cocaine shortly before they died but who had died from other causes. RESULTS: In all 21 cases of unexpected death associated with excited delirium, the deaths were associated with restraint (for violent agitation and hyperactivity), with the person either in a prone position (18 people [86 %]) or subjected to pressure on the neck (3 [14 %]). All of those who died had suddenly lapsed into tranquillity shortly after being restrained. The excited delirium was caused by a psychiatric disorder in 12 people (57 %) and by cocaine-induced psychosis in 8 (38 %). Eighteen people (86 %) were in police custody when they died. Four (19 %) had been sprayed with <b>capsicum</b> <b>oleoresin,</b> and heart disease was found in another 4 at autopsy. The blood level of cocaine in those whose excited delirium was cocaine induced was similar to levels found in recreational cocaine users and lower than levels found in people who died from cocaine intoxication. INTERPRETATION: Restraint may contribute to the death of people in states of excited delirium, and further studies to test this hypothesis are recommended. Meanwhile, law enforcement authorities and others should bear in mind the potential for the unexpected death of people in states of excited delirium who are restrained in the prone position or with a neck hold...|$|E

40|$|Objetivou-se avaliar o fornecimento de misturas de extratos vegetais nas dietas de frangos de corte. Utilizaram-se 1. 350 aves distribuídas em blocos casualizados, com seis repetições e cinco dietas, uma sem aditivos e outras quatro, cada uma contendo um dos aditivos: 10 ppm de avilamicina; 200 ppm de um produto contendo óleos essenciais de cravo, tomilho, canela e pimenta; 100 ppm de um produto {{comercial}} composto de óleos essenciais sintéticos de orégano e canela e óleo-resina de pimenta microencapsulados; 500 ppm de um produto comercial constituído de óleo de eucalipto, óleo essencial de canela-da-china, folhas de boldo-do-chile e sementes de feno-grego na fase inicial e 1. 200 ppm nas fases de crescimento e final. Aos 21 e 42 dias, foram avaliadas as variáveis de desempenho e aos 44 dias de idade, as características de carcaça. Dos 27 aos 30 dias de idade, foi realizado o ensaio de metabolismo pelo método de coleta total de excretas e determinadas a energia metabolizável e a digestibilidade da proteína bruta das dietas. As dietas com misturas de extratos vegetais não tiveram efeito significativo sobre o desempenho se comparadas à dieta sem aditivo e à dieta com antibiótico. A ausência de desafio na criação e a utilização de dietas com ingredientes de alta digestibilidade podem ter contribuído para que as aves expressassem todo o seu potencial, tornando indetectável a melhora ocasionada pela inclusão de qualquer dos aditivos. Dietas contendo misturas de extratos vegetais promovem desempenho semelhante ao obtido com dietas contendo antibiótico. The {{trial was}} carried out to evaluate different blends of plants extracts in broilers diets. It was used 1, 350 broilers distributed in a randomized block design with six replicates and five diets, one without additive and the four others, each containing {{one of the following}} additives: 10 ppm of avilamycin; 200 ppm of a product containing essential oils of carnation, thyme, cinnamon and microencapsulated capsicum; 100 ppm of a product containing essential oils of synthetic cinnamaldehyde and carvacrol and <b>capsicum</b> <b>oleoresin</b> microencapsulated; 500 ppm of a commercial product containing eucalypt oil, essential oil of Chinese cinnamon, leaves of Chilene boldo and seeds of fenu-Greek at the initial phase and 1200 ppm in the grower and finisher phases. Performance parameters were evaluated at 21 and 42 days of age and the carcass characteristics at 44 days of age. From 27 to 30 days of age, it {{was carried out}} the metabolism trial trough total excreta collection method and metabolizable energy and the crude protein digestibility of the diets were determined. The diets with plant extract blends had no significant effect on the performance when compared to diet without additives or diet with avilamycin. The lack of challenge in the experimental facilities and the use of diets with high digestibility ingredients might have contributed to broilers express all their potential making undetectable the improvement made by the inclusion of any of these additivies. Diets with plant extract blends promote performance similar to those obtained with diets containing avilamycin...|$|E
50|$|Additional {{weaponry}} {{includes the}} Bushmaster M4 Type Carbine and the Remington 870 12-gauge shotgun, {{which is currently}} being phased out for the Mossberg 500. All firearms are state property {{and may not be}} modified by the troopers to whom they are issued. Less-lethal weapons issued to troopers includes expandable batons, <b>oleoresin</b> <b>capsicum</b> spray, and Tasers.|$|R
50|$|As {{less than}} lethal options, the Border Patrol uses the FN 303 Launcher. The FN 303 fires plastic pellet balls {{containing}} OC (<b>Oleoresin</b> <b>Capsicum)</b> Pepper dust. The plastic pellet balls burst on impact spraying the suspect with OC Pepper dust and also {{act as an}} impact projectile. The Border Patrol also issues its agents OC Pepper spray canisters, tasers and a collapsible/telescopic (or telescoping) steel police baton.|$|R
50|$|Officers {{deployed}} <b>Oleoresin</b> <b>Capsicum</b> Spray and Chapman struck West in {{the thigh}} with a baton, {{but he seemed}} unfazed. Police were incapacitated by the spray and West escaped their grasp before they could handcuff him. Bernardez-Ruiz verbally stated {{to let him go}} when West attacked them a fourth time before fleeing in the direction of his sister's Mercedes, eventually tackled {{on the sidewalk in front}} of 1365 Kitmore Road.|$|R
50|$|U.S. SWAT teams {{often use}} paintball-like balls, {{also known as}} pepper balls, filled with <b>oleoresin</b> <b>capsicum,</b> the active {{ingredient}} of pepper spray, as a non-lethal incapacitation method. However, pepperballs are shot at a higher velocity than is safe for paintball (above 110 m/s) and the shells are not made from gelatin, but rather a frangible plastic to make shots more painful for faster incapacitation. Pepperballs can be shot out of almost any paintball marker.|$|R
