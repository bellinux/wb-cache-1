5|$|A total {{solar eclipse}} {{provides}} {{a rare opportunity}} to observe the <b>corona</b> (the outer layer of the Sun's atmosphere). Normally this is not visible because the photosphere is much brighter than the <b>corona.</b> According to the point reached in the solar cycle, the <b>corona</b> may appear small and symmetric, or large and fuzzy. It is very hard to predict this in advance.|$|E
5|$|The <b>corona</b> is {{the next}} layer of the Sun. The low <b>corona,</b> near {{the surface of the}} Sun, has a {{particle}} density around 1015m−3 to 1016m−3. The average temperature of the <b>corona</b> and solar wind is about 1,000,000–2,000,000 K; however, in the hottest regions it is 8,000,000–20,000,000 K. Although no complete theory yet exists to account for the temperature of the <b>corona,</b> at least some of its heat is known to be from magnetic reconnection.|$|E
5|$|Currently, it {{is unclear}} whether waves are an {{efficient}} heating mechanism. All waves except Alfvén waves have been found to dissipate or refract before reaching the <b>corona.</b> In addition, Alfvén waves do not easily dissipate in the <b>corona.</b> Current research focus has therefore shifted towards flare heating mechanisms.|$|E

40|$|The common {{defining}} {{factor of}} <b>coronae</b> {{is a distinct}} annulus of tectonic origin. Current <b>coronae</b> classification {{is based on an}} intensive study of <b>coronae</b> primarily with maximum widths in excess of 100 km. Topographically <b>coronae</b> with maximum widths in excess of 250 km tend to exhibit raised interiors with exterior rim and moat structures, {{which may or may not}} correspond to <b>coronae</b> annuli. These <b>coronae</b> are believed to be the result of gravitational relaxation of a diapir or hot-spot generated uplift. This mode of formation however, does not account for small <b>coronae,</b> <b>coronae</b> with diameters less than 200 km, that tend to exhibit depressed interiors with down-dropped or topographically level annuli.

40|$|<b>Coronae</b> are volcano-tectonic {{features}} on Venus {{which range from}} 60 km to 2600 km and are defined by their nearly circular patterns of fractures. Type 1 (regular) <b>coronae</b> are classified as having > 50 % complete fracture annuli. Previous work has examined the factors controlling the morphology, size, and fracture pattern of <b>coronae,</b> using lithospheric properties, loading signature and geologic characteristics. However, these studies have been limited to Type 2 (topographic) <b>coronae</b> (e. g. coronaes with < 50 % fracture annuli), and the factors controlling the formation of Type 1 <b>coronae</b> remain poorly understood. In this study, we apply the methodology of to survey the admittance signature for Type 1 <b>coronae</b> to determine the controlling parameters which govern Type 1 <b>coronae</b> formation...|$|R

The characteristics of the expanded population of Type 1 <b>coronae</b> {{are similar to those of}} the previously described population, but the Type 2 <b>coronae</b> are smaller, tend to have relatively flat interiors surrounded by a topographic rim, and are more likely to be found isolated from other features.

5|$|The <b>corona,</b> or paracorolla, is {{variously}} {{described as}} bell-shaped (funneliform, trumpet), bowl-shaped (cupular, crateriform, cup shaped) or disc-shaped with margins {{that are often}} frilled, and is free from the stamens. Rarely the <b>corona</b> is a simple callose (hardened, thickened) ring. The <b>corona</b> is formed during floral development as a tubular outgrowth from stamens which fuse into a tubular structure, the anthers becoming reduced. At its base the fragrances which attract pollinators are formed. All species produce nectar {{at the top of}} the ovary. Coronal morphology varies from the tiny pigmented disk of N. serotinus (see Table I) or the rudimentary structure in N. cavanillesii to the elongated trumpets of section Pseudonarcissus (trumpet daffodils, Table I).|$|E

5|$|During a total solar eclipse, the Moon's shadow covers {{only a small}} {{fraction}} of the Earth. The Earth continues to receive at least 92 percent of the amount of sunlight it receives without an eclipse–more if the penumbra of the Moon's shadow partly misses the Earth. Seen from the Moon, the Earth during a total solar eclipse is mostly brilliantly illuminated, with only a small dark patch showing the Moon's shadow. The brilliantly-lit Earth reflects a lot of light to the Moon. If the <b>corona</b> of the eclipsed Sun were not present, the Moon, illuminated by earthlight, would be easily visible from Earth. This would be essentially the same as the earthshine which can frequently be seen when the Moon's phase is a narrow crescent. In reality, the <b>corona,</b> though much less brilliant than the Sun's photosphere, is much brighter than the Moon illuminated by earthlight. Therefore, by contrast, the Moon during a total solar eclipse appears to be black, with the <b>corona</b> surrounding it.|$|E

40|$|Without {{extensive}} plate subduction {{to act as}} {{a recycling}} mechanism, a thick layer of buoyant, depleted mantle material may accumulate beneath the thermal lithosphere on Venus due to the pressure-release melting that occurs during crustal formation. Such a layer could be the key factor that allows <b>coronae</b> to form on Venus but not on Earth. <b>Coronae</b> are roughly circular volcano-tectonic features that are interpreted as a manifestation of small-scale upwelling and are unique to Venus. The topographic expression of <b>coronae</b> is highly variable, ranging from domes to plateaus, with or without moats or single or multiple outer rises. In addition to why <b>coronae</b> from on Venus but not on Earth, two outstanding questions in the study of <b>coronae</b> are how the full range of topographic profiles are produced and the relationship between topography and the annulus of fractures that characterize <b>coronae...</b>|$|R

5|$|It {{is thought}} that the energy {{necessary}} to heat the <b>corona</b> is provided by turbulent motion in the convection zone below the photosphere, and two main mechanisms have been proposed to explain coronal heating. The first is wave heating, in which sound, gravitational or magnetohydrodynamic waves are produced by turbulence in the convection zone. These waves travel upward and dissipate in the <b>corona,</b> depositing their energy in the ambient matter {{in the form of}} heat. The other is magnetic heating, in which magnetic energy is continuously built up by photospheric motion and released through magnetic reconnection in the form of large solar flares and myriad similar but smaller events—nanoflares.|$|E
50|$|<b>Coronae</b> are large, {{circular}} structures with concentric fractures {{around them}} {{that result from}} mantle upwelling followed by extensional collapse. Since many sequences of upwelling and collapse have been observed as structurally different <b>coronae</b> on Venus' surface, all <b>coronae</b> appear to share a sequence of heavy volcanism {{as a result of}} upwelling, topographic rise, tectonic deformation, subsidence due to gravitational collapse, and continued volcanism. <b>Coronae</b> on Venus differ in the location of topographic uplift, and have been characterized as such. Topographic uplift may occur in the depression, the rim, the outer rim, or a combination of these locations. A collapsing <b>coronae</b> coupled with extensional stressing may result in rifting, creating a chasmata region.|$|R

40|$|The {{majority}} of <b>coronae</b> (quasicircular volcano-tectonic features) are found along rifts or fracture belts, and the {{majority of}} rifts have <b>coronae</b> [e. g. 1, 2]. However, the relationship between <b>coronae</b> and rifts remains unclear [3 - 6]. There is evidence that <b>coronae</b> can form before, after, or synchronously with rifts [3, 4]. The extensional fractures in the rift zones have been proposed to be a result of broad scale upwelling and traction on the lower lithosphere [7]. However, not all rift systems have a significant positive geoid anomaly, as would be expected for an upwelling site [8]. This could be explained if the rifts lacking anomalies are no longer active. <b>Coronae</b> are generally accepted to be sites of local upwelling [e. g. 1], but the observed rifting is frequently not radial to the <b>coronae</b> and extends well beyond the <b>coronae</b> into the surrounding plains. Thus the question remains as to whether the rifts represent regional extension, perhaps driven by mantle tractions, or if the <b>coronae</b> themselves create local thinning and extension of the lithosphere. In the first case, a regional extension model should be consistent with the observed characteristics of the rifts. In the latter case, a model of lithospheric loading and fracturing would be more appropriate. A good analogy may be the propagation of oceanic intraplate volcanoes [9]...|$|R
