5|$|On September 16, Six Flags Great Adventure {{announced}} that it would open a Green Lantern-themed roller coaster in 2011. The specifications released for the new ride matched those of Chang. As part of the relocation, the ride would receive technical renovations and a new <b>coat</b> <b>of</b> <b>paint.</b>|$|E
5|$|The painted frieze {{above the}} astronomical clock shows five deities from {{classical}} antiquity, each representing both {{a day of}} the week and a planet in their order according to Ptolemaic cosmology. From left to right, they are: Saturn with sickle and club for Saturday, Jupiter with thunderbolts for Thursday, Mars with sword and shield for Tuesday, Venus with Cupid for Friday and Mercury with staff and bag for Wednesday. The painting of the entire clock area was refurbished in 1983. Only the matte areas on the clock face are from the earlier <b>coat</b> <b>of</b> <b>paint.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1974, {{the ride}} {{received}} a new <b>coat</b> <b>of</b> <b>paint</b> with Victorian-style architecture around the station. In the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, the Giant Dipper was almost completely untouched. The ride {{was closed for}} about a month to be inspected. The park held a benefit for victims of the earthquake. In 2002, the ride celebrated its 50 millionth rider. Ten years after the 50 millionth rider, the park celebrated the Giant Dipper's 60 millionth rider on July 27, 2012. The park gave out trivia coasters leading up to the event. The 24 riders that were on the train when it hit 60 million riders received a hoodie among other prizes.|$|E

5|$|Top Gun: The Jet Coaster soft {{opened to}} guests and media on March 16, 1999. Riders {{of the first}} cycle {{included}} NASCAR drivers Stanton Barrett, Tony Stewart, Jerry Nadeau, and Kenny Wallace. The ride officially {{opened to the public}} on March 20, 1999. On July 1, 2006, the Cedar Fair Entertainment Company announced their acquisition of all of the Paramount Parks, including Carowinds. The aforementioned Top Gun roller coasters at other parks were all renamed to Flight Deck by the 2008 season, with Carowinds' installation being renamed to Afterburn. For the 2014 season, the ride's 15th season, Afterburn received a new <b>coat</b> <b>of</b> <b>paint.</b>|$|E
5|$|Mr. Krabs {{is about}} to give SpongeBob and Patrick the job, but he hits his foot on a rock, {{dropping}} the paint and says all 13 swear words while complaining about his foot being injured. When SpongeBob and Patrick hear all the swear words, they run to Mama Krabs' house to tattle on him. When they all reach her house, they all explain what happened at once, saying the same swear words in the process. This makes her faint, but shortly after Mr. Krabs scolds SpongeBob and Patrick for saying all those bad words {{in front of her}} she regains consciousness. Mama Krabs states that all three of them should be ashamed for saying all those words. She then gives all three of them the task of painting her house with a fresh <b>coat</b> <b>of</b> <b>paint</b> as punishment. Later on, she leaves the three alarmed when she appears to be saying a 14th swear word after stubbing her toe on a rock; she claims that the sound came from Old Man Jenkins, who is driving by in his jalopy, which produces an identical sound and everyone laughs.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{freshman}} college season, McKee {{qualified for the}} 1972 U.S. Olympic team despite recovering from a bout of mononucleosis. At the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Germany, he represented the United States in three different events. Most memorably, McKee won a silver medal in the men's 400-meter individual medley in the closest swimming decision in Olympic history, losing {{by a margin of}} two one-thousandths (0.002) of a second to Sweden's Gunnar Larsson. Initially, the scoreboard showed that Larsson and McKee had tied with an official time of 4:31.98, but in a controversial decision, the event judges named Larsson the eventual gold medal-winner ten minutes after the race was over—Larsson's electronic clock time was 4:31.981, McKee's 4:31.983. The time difference was variously calculated as one-tenth of the time of a typical blink of a human eye, and the distance as the thickness of a <b>coat</b> <b>of</b> <b>paint,</b> a sheet of paper, or the minor imperfections in the individual lanes of the Olympic pool. As a result of the controversy, the international swimming federation, FINA, subsequently clarified the timing rules for competition swimming; international races are now required to be timed to the hundredth of a second, and timing to the thousandth of a second is prohibited for tie-breakers. It was the first and only Olympic swimming event ever decided on the basis of thousandths of a second. Afterward, McKee attributed his second-place finish to a tactical mistake: he looked over his shoulder to see where Larsson was in the final leg of the race.|$|E

25|$|There is {{very little}} pottery found during this phase, thus not {{providing}} much information. It is clear, however, that the bountiful decorations of the developed phase are no longer around.

25|$|For {{many years}} {{the house was}} painted gray. Recent {{analysis}} of the exterior paint layers on the original clapboard surviving in the corner at {{the short end of}} the building revealed that the house was originally white and then red.

25|$|John C. Demps {{was named}} {{principal}} in 1976. Drainage renovations were completed in 1980, improving swampy conditions on campus {{which had been}} prone to flooding. In 1986, BCHS received a $24,500 federal grant and implemented a campaign to restore the school's image and spirit. The buildings received a fresh <b>coat</b> <b>of</b> <b>paint,</b> and parents, students and staff re-discovered the words to the fight song thanks to Mary Ann Frey, a teacher who was a 1968 graduate. In January 1987, Barbara Paonessa {{became the first woman}} (and longest-serving) principal until May 2003. An Army Junior ROTC program was established in 1988.|$|E
25|$|While in Staten Island, Intrepid {{underwent}} {{the next}} phase of her refurbishment, and received an $8million interior renovation. Never-before-seen areas of the ship including the forecastle (fo'c'sle, commonly known as the anchor chain room), general berthing quarters and the ship's machine shop were opened to the public for the first time. The hangar deck features a new layout and design including new interactive exhibits. Around 1,200 tons of her original weight in steel were removed and 339 epoxy-coated steel pilings ranging in length from 60 to 183 feet were installed. Intrepid also received a new <b>coat</b> <b>of</b> <b>paint,</b> using almost 7,000 gallons to re-paint the interior, hull, towers, and decks. Total cost of the renovation was $120million — $55million for the ship and $65million for Pier86.|$|E

25|$|The {{boarding}} {{complex is}} undergoing renovation and {{was expected to}} be completed by the end of 2012. There will also be a new facade that blends in with the contemporary looks of Hullett block with new windows and new exterior <b>coat</b> <b>of</b> <b>paint.</b> The tiles along the common areas like the staircase and corridors will also be changed to new ones. There will also be new lifts installed at every block. The current games rooms in the four blocks will be shifted into the current reception lobby and in its place, the Buckley block will have a new mini-mart, Bayley a new gym cum dance studio (only for RIB boarders), Morrison and Moor will have new offices for ORA/RPA and the Internationalisation Office. All rooms would also be fully air-conditioned too.|$|E
25|$|The RAE first {{tested it}} in an “as delivered” configuration. The wing airfoil was {{designed}} to support laminar flow to 60% of chord. In the “as delivered” configuration, a profile drag was measured which was representative of the wing section with boundary layer transition {{at the leading edge}} (0% laminar flow). Reducing the surface roughness reduced the drag at low lift coefficients to a level representative of laminar flow to 35% of chord. Measurements were made of the surface waviness. This showed peak wave amplitudes, above the mean, of approximately 0.011 inches over a two-inch span. The standard waviness criteria shows the critical wave height to be 0.0053 inches for this application. To reduce the waviness, RAE personnel stripped the wing to bare metal. The wing was then sprayed with two coats of primer paint and a <b>coat</b> <b>of</b> <b>paint</b> type filler. After the paint was dry, it was sanded in a chordwise direction, using sanding blocks, whose curvature matched the local surface curvature. This was repeated several times. Surface waviness was then measured and found to be no more than 0.005 inches. In flight, this configuration was found to have a profile drag representative of boundary layer transition at 60% of chord. This gave researchers an idea of what level of wing surface quality was required to actually get the benefits of laminar flow airfoils.|$|E
500|$|The {{cause of}} the cracks was a rubber washer which had been {{installed}} on the first eight trains—rather than the conventional plastic cover—which was intended to protect the axles from ice and stones. Adtranz had delivered thousands of trains with the conventional method without cracks, but the washers trapped water and this caused them to corrode and crack. Adtranz had applied a <b>coat</b> <b>of</b> <b>paint</b> as the sole means to avoid corrosion to the axle. The DNV inspector had [...] "hardly believed his ears" [...] {{when he heard about}} it. In addition, the axles were undersized, and DNV stated that it was only under duress that they considered it safe to operate the trains at conventional speeds, and that all the axles would have to be replaced. On 30 August, NSB gave Adtranz two weeks to solve the axle issues unless the contract was to be revoked.|$|E

5000|$|The company {{adopted a}} {{strategy}} of building the highest quality motor cars with powerful engines. Henry J.

Low-end models were dressed in 15 to 18 <b>coats</b> <b>of</b> <b>paint,</b> each <b>coat</b> hand sanded and rubbed out. The limousine model had 27 or 28 <b>coats</b> <b>of</b> <b>paint,</b> similarly applied. After assembly, each car was driven on public roads for 150 mi to 400 mi, then the engine was disassembled, the cylinders re-honed, valves touched up, and then reassembled and road tested again.|$|R

His lyrics described the narrator's growing frustration over a crossed-wire phone connection with a female subject. On [...] "Human Being", an ode to self-respect and personal liberty, Thunders introduced his guitar playing with a roughly performed variation on Bill Doggett's 1956 song [...] "Honky Tonk". Johansen addressed critics of the band in the song, telling them if they found him objectionable they should instead find themselves [...] "a saint", [...] "a boy who's gonna be what I ain't", and a [...] "plastic doll with a fresh <b>coat</b> <b>of</b> <b>paint</b> who's gonna sit through the madness and always act so quaint".|$|E
500|$|England's next match pitted {{them against}} the United States—an {{opponent}} {{they were expected to}} easily overcome—at the Estádio Independência in Belo Horizonte, [...] inland. The selectors again picked Ramsey, but left star winger Stanley Matthews out on the grounds that England could beat the Americans without him, ignoring Winterbottom's protests. England dominated the first half. [...] "I'm not making excuses when I say that in the first 45 minutes we had a year's bad luck," [...] Ramsey wrote in 1952. [...] "Shots which appeared certain to score missed by the width of a <b>coat</b> <b>of</b> <b>paint.</b> The American goalkeeper, much to his astonishment, found himself stopping the ball with his body, and on occasions his face, without really knowing what it was all about." [...] The US grabbed a shock lead on 37 minutes when a long shot towards England's penalty area flew into the net off the head of American forward Joe Gaetjens.|$|E
500|$|Horsmonden {{station has}} been {{converted}} to a private garage trading as the [...] "Old Station Garage", with the old stationmaster's house in use as a private dwelling.

Goudhurst station, yard and level crossing have disappeared as a result of road-widening and residential development; a private house called [...] "Haltwhistle" [...] stands on part of the old goods yard. The old station lights have been re-used along the drive of the house. Cranbrook station was used for many years as a pottery, and its stationmaster's house is now a private dwelling, with part of the goods yard also having survived. The signal box has survived and the station building has been extended to meet with it; the trackbed is now part of the lawn. The site of Hawkhurst station is now occupied by Kent Woodware Co, a wood turnery business. The main station building was demolished in the 1960s but the engine and goods sheds, stationmaster's house and signal box are still extant.
