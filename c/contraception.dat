5|$|September 26 is World <b>Contraception</b> Day, {{devoted to}} raising {{awareness}} and improving education about sexual and reproductive health, {{with a vision}} of a world where every pregnancy is wanted. It is supported by a group of governments and international NGOs, including the Office of Population Affairs, the Asian Pacific Council on <b>Contraception,</b> Centro Latinamericano Salud y Mujer, the European Society of <b>Contraception</b> and Reproductive Health, the German Foundation for World Population, the International Federation of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology, International Planned Parenthood Federation, the Marie Stopes International, Population Services International, the Population Council, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), and Women Deliver.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability to}} {{determine}} if and when to become pregnant, is vital to a woman's autonomy and well being, and <b>contraception</b> can protect girls and young women from the risks of early pregnancy and older women from the increased risks of unintended pregnancy. Adequate access to <b>contraception</b> can limit multiple pregnancies, {{reduce the need for}} potentially unsafe abortion and reduce maternal and infant mortality and morbidity. Some barrier forms of <b>contraception</b> such as condoms, also reduce the risk of STIs and HIV infection. Access to <b>contraception</b> allows women to make informed choices about their reproductive and sexual health, increases empowerment, and enhances choices in education, careers and participation in public life. At the societal level, access to <b>contraception</b> is a key factor in controlling population growth, with resultant impact on the economy, the environment and regional development. Consequently, the United Nations considers access to <b>contraception</b> a human right that is central to gender equality and women's empowerment that saves lives and reduces poverty, and birth control has been considered amongst the 10 great public health achievements of the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|A major {{turning point}} for the {{movement}} came during World War I, when many U.S. servicemen were diagnosed with venereal diseases. The government's response included an anti-venereal disease campaign that framed sexual intercourse and <b>contraception</b> as issues {{of public health and}} legitimate topics of scientific research. This was the first time a U.S. government institution had engaged in a sustained, public discussion of sexual matters; as a consequence, <b>contraception</b> transformed from an issue of morals to an issue of public health.|$|E
5|$|Abortion is the {{intentional}} termination of pregnancy, {{as compared to}} spontaneous termination (miscarriage). Abortion is closely allied to <b>contraception</b> in terms of women's control and regulation of their reproduction, and is often subject to similar cultural, religious, legislative and economic constraints. Where access to <b>contraception</b> is limited, women turn to abortion. Consequently, abortion rates {{may be used to}} estimate unmet needs for <b>contraception.</b> However the available procedures have carried great risk for women throughout most of history, and still do in the developing world, or where legal restrictions force women to seek clandestine facilities. Access to safe legal abortion places undue burdens on lower socioeconomic groups and in jurisdictions that create significant barriers. These issues have frequently been the subject of political and feminist campaigns where differing viewpoints pit health against moral values.|$|E
5|$|In 1936 the U.S. {{court ruled}} in U.S. v. One Package that {{medically}} prescribing <b>contraception</b> {{to save a}} persons life or well being was not illegal under the Comstock Law; following this decision, the American Medical Association Committee on <b>Contraception</b> revoked its 1936 statement condemning birth control. A national survey in 1937 showed 71 percent {{of the adult population}} supported the use of <b>contraception.</b> By 1938 347 birth control clinics were running in the United States despite their advertisement still being illegal. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt publicly supported birth control and family planning. In 1966, President Lyndon B. Johnson started endorsing public funding for family planning services, and the Federal Government began subsidizing birth control services for low-income families. The Affordable Care Act, passed into law on March 23, 2010 under President Barack Obama, requires all plans in the Health Insurance Marketplace to cover contraceptive methods. These include barrier methods, hormonal methods, implanted devices, emergency contraceptives, and sterilization procedures.|$|E
5|$|In 1970, Congress finally removed {{references}} to <b>contraception</b> from federal anti-obscenity laws; and in 1973, the Roe v. Wade decision legalized abortion {{during the first}} trimester of pregnancy.|$|E
5|$|Marie Stopes, early {{promoter}} of sex education and <b>contraception,</b> {{was raised in}} a house on Cintra Park shortly after her birth in Edinburgh, in 1880.|$|E
5|$|On September 12, 2012, Cierpiot {{voted to}} {{overturn}} Governor Jay Nixon's veto of SB749. The bill allowed health insurance providers {{to refuse to}} provide coverage for <b>contraception</b> based on moral convictions.|$|E
5|$|After {{living in}} Crete, Dworkin {{returned}} to Bennington for two years, where {{she continued to}} study literature and participated in campaigns against the college's student conduct code, for <b>contraception</b> on campus, for the legalization of abortion, and against the Vietnam War. She graduated with a Bachelor's degree in literature in 1968.|$|E
5|$|Assisted {{suicide and}} abortion: Viewing all human life as sacred, the Assemblies of God opposes {{assisted}} suicide and abortion (unless it is medically {{confirmed that the}} mother's life is in imminent, physical danger). It believes scripture is silent {{on the use of}} <b>contraception</b> and therefore takes no position on this subject.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{medications}} {{may cause}} weight gain or changes in body composition; these include insulin, sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, atypical antipsychotics, antidepressants, steroids, certain anticonvulsants (phenytoin and valproate), pizotifen, and {{some forms of}} hormonal <b>contraception.</b>|$|E
5|$|In Burwell v. Hobby Lobby the Supreme Court {{exempted}} {{closely held}} corporations with religious convictions from the <b>contraception</b> rule. In Wheaton College vs Burwell the Court issued an injunction allowing the evangelical college and other religiously affiliated nonprofit groups to completely ignore the contraceptive mandate.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, the 1965 Supreme Court {{decision}} Griswold v. Connecticut overturned a {{state law}} prohibiting dissemination of <b>contraception</b> information based on {{a constitutional right to}} privacy for marital relationships. In 1971, Eisenstadt v. Baird extended this right to privacy to single people.|$|E
5|$|The {{movement}} to legalize birth control {{came to a}} gradual conclusion around the time Planned Parenthood was formed. In 1942, there were over 400 birth control organizations in America, <b>contraception</b> was fully embraced by the medical profession, and the anti-contraception Comstock laws (which still remained on the books) were rarely enforced.|$|E
5|$|The {{practice}} {{of birth control}} was common throughout the U.S. prior to 1914, when the movement to legalize <b>contraception</b> began. Longstanding techniques included the rhythm method, withdrawal, diaphragms, contraceptive sponges, condoms, prolonged breastfeeding, and spermicides. Use of contraceptives increased throughout the nineteenth century, contributing to a 50 percent drop in the fertility rate in the United States between 1800 and 1900, particularly in urban regions. The only known survey conducted {{during the nineteenth century}} of American women's contraceptive habits was performed by Clelia Mosher from 1892 to 1912. The survey was based on a small sample of upper-class women, and shows that most of the women used <b>contraception</b> (primarily douching, but also withdrawal, rhythm, condoms and pessaries) and that they viewed sex as a pleasurable act that could be undertaken without the goal of procreation.Engelman, pp. 11â€“12.|$|E
5|$|Artificial {{birth control}} predates Christianity; the Catholic Church has {{condemned}} these methods throughout its history. In {{response to the}} Church of England accepting the practice of artificial <b>contraception</b> in 1930, the Catholic Church issued the papal encyclical Casti connubii on 31 December 1930. The 1968 papal encyclical Humanae vitae is a reaffirmation of the Catholic Church's traditional view of marriage and marital relations, and a continued condemnation of artificial birth control.|$|E
5|$|Because of her {{position}} as Secretary of HHS, Burwell was the named party in multiple lawsuits {{related to the}} Affordable Care Act. One month into her tenure, the Supeme Court decided Burwell vs. Hobby Lobby, where the court struck down {{the implementation of the}} Affordable Care Act's <b>contraception</b> mandate as violating Hobby Lobby's religious freedom. The Supreme Court also decided King v. Burwell, a case in which the Court upheld the Affordable Care Act's subsidies for healthcare plans purchased on federal exchanges.|$|E
5|$|Birth control, {{also known}} as <b>contraception</b> and {{fertility}} control, is a method or device used to prevent pregnancy. Birth control has been used since ancient times, but effective and safe methods of birth control only became available in the 20th century. Planning, making available, and using birth control is called family planning. Some cultures limit or discourage access to birth control because they consider it to be morally, religiously, or politically undesirable.|$|E
5|$|In 2001 Mathews {{relocated}} to Seattle, Washington, {{to work for}} the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the largest philanthropic organization in the United States, as an executive vice president. The following year, she became chief operating officer of the Foundation. The Foundation reorganized in 2006, naming Mathews president of the Foundation's Global Development Program. Mathews was involved in awarding grants to improve health outcomes in the developing world, including stopping the spread of HIV and other diseases and making <b>contraception</b> more readily available.|$|E
5|$|In March 2012, the Roman Catholic Church, while {{supportive}} of ACA's objectives, voiced concern through the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops that {{aspects of the}} mandate covering <b>contraception</b> and sterilization and HHS's narrow definition of a religious organization violated the First Amendment right to {{free exercise of religion}} and conscience. Various lawsuits addressed these concerns.|$|E
5|$|Sanger's goal of {{challenging}} {{the law was}} fulfilled when she was indicted in August 1914, but the prosecutors focused their attention on articles Sanger had written on assassination and marriage, rather than <b>contraception.</b> Afraid {{that she might be}} sent to prison without an opportunity to argue for birth control in court, she fled to England to escape arrest.|$|E
5|$|Since {{at least}} the 1870s, American religious, medical, legislative, and legal {{commentators}} have debated <b>contraception</b> laws. Ana Garner and Angela Michel have found that in these discussions men often attach reproductive rights to moral and political matters, {{as part of an}} ongoing attempt to regulate human bodies. In press coverage between 1873â€“2013 they found a divide between institutional ideology and real-life experiences of women.|$|E
5|$|The military's anti-venereal disease {{campaign}} {{marked a}} major {{turning point for}} the movement: {{it was the first}} time a government institution had engaged in a sustained, public discussion of sexual matters. The government's public discourse changed sex from a secret topic into a legitimate topic of scientific research, and it transformed <b>contraception</b> from an issue of morals to an issue of public health.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{measures}} {{have not been}} confirmed to affect UTI frequency including: urinating immediately after intercourse, the type of underwear used, personal hygiene methods used after urinating or defecating, or whether a person typically bathes or showers. There is similarly a lack of evidence surrounding the effect of holding one's urine, tampon use, and douching. In those with frequent urinary tract infections who use spermicide or a diaphragm {{as a method of}} <b>contraception,</b> they are advised to use alternative methods. In those with benign prostatic hyperplasia urinating in a sitting position appears to improve bladder emptying which might decrease urinary tract infections in this group.|$|E
5|$|At {{the turn}} of the century, an {{energetic}} movement arose, centered in Greenwich Village, that sought to overturn bans on free speech.Kersch, Kenneth Ira, Freedom of Speech: Rights and Liberties under the Law, ABC-CLIO, 2003, pp. 109â€“110. Supported by radicals, feminists, anarchists, and atheists such as Ezra Heywood, Moses Harman, D. M. Bennett, and Emma Goldman, these activists regularly battled anti-obscenity laws and, later, the government's effort to suppress speech critical of involvement in World War I. Prior to 1914, the free speech movement focused on politics, and rarely addressed <b>contraception.</b>|$|E
5|$|During World War I, Mary Dennett focused {{her efforts}} on the peace movement, but she {{returned}} to the birth control movement in 1918. She continued to lead the NBCL, and collaborated with Sanger's NYWPC. In 1919, Dennett published a widely distributed educational pamphlet, The Sex Side of Life, which treated sex as a natural and enjoyable act. However, in the same year, frustrated with the NBCL's chronic lack of funding, Dennett broke away and formed the Voluntary Parenthood League (VPL). Both Dennett and Sanger proposed legislative changes that would legalize birth control, but they took different approaches: Sanger endorsed <b>contraception</b> but only under a physician's supervision; Dennett pushed for unrestricted access to contraception.Engelman, pp. 113â€“115. Sanger, a proponent of diaphragms, was concerned that unrestricted access would result in ill-fitting diaphragms and would lead to medical quackery.McCann (1994), pp. 71â€“72 gives examples that show Sanger's fears were justified. Dennett was concerned that requiring women to get prescriptions from physicians would prevent poor women from receiving <b>contraception,</b> and she was concerned about a shortage of physicians trained in birth control. Both legislative initiatives failed, partly because some legislators felt that fear of pregnancy {{was the only thing that}} kept women chaste. In the early 1920s, Sanger's leadership position in the movement solidified because she gave frequent public lectures, and because she took steps to exclude Dennett from meetings and events.|$|E
5|$|For most girls, {{childhood}} {{came to an}} {{end with}} the onset of puberty, which was followed shortly after by betrothal and marriage. Although marriage arranged by the family was the norm, romantic love was not unknown. Most women bore many children but few survived infancy, and grief for the loss of a loved one was an inalienable part of life. The main form of birth control was abstinence, and while there is evidence of <b>contraception</b> it seems to have been mainly used by prostitutes.|$|E
5|$|Globally, {{there were}} 87 million {{unwanted}} pregnancies in 2005, of those 46 million resorted to abortion, of which 18 million were considered unsafe, resulting in 68,000 deaths. The {{majority of these}} deaths occurred in the developing world. The United Nations considers these avoidable with access to safe abortion and post-abortion care. While abortion rates have fallen in developed countries, but not in developing countries. Between 2010â€“2014 there were 35 abortions per 1000 women aged 15â€“44, a total of 56 million abortions per year. The United nations has prepared recommendations for health care workers to provide more accessible and safe abortion and post-abortion care. An inherent part of post-abortion care involves provision of adequate <b>contraception.</b>|$|E
5|$|Herbert {{composed}} {{music for}} Le Tabou, a full two-act musical theatre piece, written by Kath Burlinson and performed by Youth Music Theatre at the Barbican Theatre, Plymouth in August 2013. She was the composer and sound designer for a play by Diane Samuels, Poppy + George, which was performed at Watford Palace Theatre in February 2016. In December 2016 and January 2017 she performed in, and was composer, lyricist and musical director for, a musical production at Bristol Old Vic of Hans Christian Andersen's story The Snow Queen, directed by Lee Lyford. Herbert is also collaborating with Diane Samuels on writing a new musical about <b>contraception,</b> The Rhythm Method, {{which is in}} development at Watford Palace Theatre.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Romney {{revealed}} {{a change of}} view regarding abortion, moving from the pro-choice positions expressed during his 1994 and 2002 campaigns to a pro-life one in opposition to Roe v. Wade. Romney attributed his conversion to an interaction with Harvard University biologist Douglas Melton, an expert on embryonic stem cell biology, although Melton vehemently disputed Romney's recollection of their conversation. Romney subsequently vetoed a bill on pro-life grounds that expanded access to emergency <b>contraception</b> in hospitals and pharmacies (the legislature overrode the veto). He also amended his position on {{embryonic stem cell research}} itself.|$|E
5|$|In {{the modern}} era, Cluj's {{population}} experienced two phases of rapid growth, {{the first in}} the late 19th century, when the city grew in importance and size, and the second during the Communist period, when a massive urbanisation campaign was launched and many people migrated from rural areas and from beyond the Carpathians to the county's capital. About two-thirds of the population growth during this era was based on net migration inflows; after 1966, the date of CeauÈ™escu's ban on abortion and <b>contraception,</b> natural increase was also significant, being responsible for the remaining third.|$|E
5|$|Lang became Archbishop of Canterbury in 1928. He {{presided over}} the 1930 Lambeth Conference, which gave limited church {{approval}} {{to the use of}} <b>contraception.</b> After denouncing the Italian invasion of Abyssinia in 1935 and strongly condemning European anti-semitism, Lang later supported the appeasement policies of the British government. In May 1937 he {{presided over the}} coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. On retirement in 1942 Lang was raised to the peerage as Baron Lang of Lambeth and continued to attend and speak in House of Lords debates until his death in 1945. Lang himself believed that he had not lived up to his own high standards. Others have praised his qualities of industry, his efficiency and his commitment to his calling.|$|E
5|$|Legal {{victories}} in the 1930s continued to weaken anti-contraception laws. The court victories motivated the American Medical Association in 1937 to adopt <b>contraception</b> as a core component of medical school curricula, but the medical community was slow to accept this new responsibility, and women continued to rely on unsafe and ineffective contraceptive advice from ill-informed sources. In 1942, the Planned Parenthood Federation of America was formed, creating a nationwide network of birth control clinics. After World War II, the movement to legalize birth control came to a gradual conclusion, as birth control was fully embraced by the medical profession, and the remaining anti-contraception laws were no longer enforced.|$|E
5|$|Sanger appealed her 1917 {{conviction}} {{and won a}} mixed victory in 1918 in a unanimous decision by the New York Court of Appeals written by Judge Frederick E. Crane. The court's opinion upheld her conviction, but indicated that the courts {{would be willing to}} permit <b>contraception</b> if prescribed by doctors.Engelman, pp. 101â€“103. This decision was only applicable within New York, where it opened the door for birth control clinics, under physician supervision, to be established. Sanger herself did not immediately take advantage of the opportunity, wrongly expecting that the medical profession would lead the way; instead she focused on writing and lecturing.|$|E
5|$|Stossel grew {{continuously}} more {{frustrated with}} having {{to follow the}} assignment editor's vision of what was news. Perhaps because of his stuttering, he had always avoided covering what others covered, feeling he could not succeed if {{he was forced to}} compete with other reporters by shouting out questions at news conferences. However, this led to the unexpected realization for Stossel that more important events were those that occurred slowly, such as the women's movement, the growth of computer technology, and advancements in <b>contraception,</b> rather than daily events like government pronouncements, elections, fires or crime. One day, Stossel bypassed the assignment editor to give Ed Joyce a list of story ideas the assignment editor had rejected. Joyce agreed that Stossel's ideas were better, and approved them.|$|E
