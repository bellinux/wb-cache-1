5000|$|The {{high point}} of the trip was a four-month sojourn in Burma, where her brother Louis Walinsky was serving as {{economic}} advisor to Prime Minister U Nu. While in Burma, Walinska instructed local craftsmen {{on the art of}} building an easel and stretching canvas. The Burmese artists took her out to paint en plein air, and she shared with them her knowledge of {{what was happening in the}} art world. U Hla Shein, <b>Minister</b> of the <b>Shan</b> <b>States</b> and an artist himself, wrote of her influence in The Guardian: [...] "The vast majority of artists in Burma follow the realistic approach. They have now for the first time seen and heard a modernist, who appears entirely different from the only brand they had known." [...] While in Burma, she painted the portrait of Prime Minister U Nu.Later, Walinska became a teaching artist in residence at the Riverside Museum, where she exhibited with sculptor Louise Nevelson, among others. [...] In 1971 the Riverside collection, including two of her paintings, moved to the Rose Art Museum at Brandeis University.|$|R
50|$|Back in Ava, Yaza guided Minkhaung who {{set out on}} {{acquiring}} the surrounding states in the following years. He personally led the 1404/05 embassy to Onbaung (Hsipaw) that resulted in Onbaung's submission. He got the neighboring Nyaungshwe and Mohnyin to submit in 1405/06 and 1406 respectively. (Ava also acquired Arakan in 1406 but the main chronicles do not explicitly mention Yaza or the court in the invasion decision.) Nonetheless, Yaza apparently was the power behind the throne: the king accepted his <b>chief</b> <b>minister's</b> recommendations for governorships at Kalay and Mohnyin. He advised Minkhaung to appoint Kye Taung Nyo, the eldest son of Minkhaung's predecessor Tarabya to the faraway <b>Shan</b> <b>state</b> of Kalay (by the Manipur border) while advising the appointment of Thado, a proven commander, to the crucial northern <b>Shan</b> <b>state</b> of Mohnyin.|$|R

He was the main adviser to three {{successive}} kings of Ava: Swa Saw Ke, Tarabya and Minkhaung I. Under his guidance, Ava made several attempts to restore the Pagan Empire, and methodically acquired its immediate surrounding <b>Shan</b> <b>states</b> between 1371 and 1406. By his death in 1421, he had advised his kings almost for the entire duration of the Forty Years' War (1385-1424) between Ava and Pegu.|$|R

25|$|Swa shared Thado Minbya's {{dream of}} {{restoring}} the erstwhile Pagan Empire.

The king came to rely on the advice of his court, led by <b>Chief</b> <b>Minister</b> Min Yaza, a commoner who joined his service in 1368. Despite the ambition, at his accession his real authority did not exceed outside the immediate core region of Central Burma. He decided to bide his time, and deal with his internal and external issues one at a time. At the top of his list was the <b>Shan</b> <b>state</b> of Maw (Mong Mao), which had been assiduously raiding Upper Burma since 1356.|$|R
50|$|His {{first act}} as king was to reappoint Nanda Pakyan as the <b>Chief</b> <b>Minister</b> and Commander-in-Chief {{with the title}} of Thubarit.

In Central Burma, he secured peace with Sagaing's cross-river rival Pinya by marrying Saw Pa Oh, daughter of King Uzana I of Pinya. (The peace between the two kingdoms was maintained even after Uzana I was pushed out by Kyawswa I between 1340 and 1344.) In the north, the <b>Shan</b> <b>states</b> were still fighting a war of independence against their Mongol overlords, and were not yet the threat they would become to Central Burmese states in the late 1350s.|$|R
