50|$|The {{operation}} of the hybrid plasmonic waveguides can be explained using the concept of mode coupling. The most commonly used hybrid plasmonic waveguide consists of a silicon nanowire placed very near a metal surface and separated by a low index region. The silicon waveguide supports dielectric waveguide mode, which is mostly confined in silicon. The metal surface supports surface plasmon, which is confined near the metal surface. When these two structures are brought close to each other, the dielectric waveguide mode supported by the silicon nanowire couples to the surface plasmon mode supported by the metal surface. As {{a result of this}} mode <b>coupling,</b> <b>light</b> becomes highly confined in the region between the metal and the high index region (silicon nanowire).|$|E

Introduction: Long period gratings (LPGs) consist of a large scale (hundred's of microns) periodic axial perturbation {{in the core of}} a single-mode optical fibre [1]. The effect of an LPG is to <b>couple</b> <b>light</b> of certain well-defined wavelengths from the core of the fibre to various cladding modes; the <b>coupled</b> <b>light</b> is then lost from the fibre, leading to a series of attenuation bands in the transmission spectrum of the device.

40|$|The burgeoning {{field of}} astrophotonics explores the {{interface}} between astronomy and photonics. Important applications include photonic OH suppression at near-infrared wavelengths, and integrated photonic spectroscopy. These new photonic mechanisms are not well matched to conventional multi-mode fibre bundles, and are best fed with single or few-mode fibres. We envisage the largest gains in astrophotonics will come from instruments that operate with single or few mode fibres in the diffraction limited or near diffraction limited regime. While astronomical instruments have largely solved the problem of <b>coupling</b> <b>light</b> into multi-mode fibres, this is largely unexplored territory for few-mode and single-mode fibres. Here we describe a project to explore this topic in detail, and present initial results on <b>coupling</b> <b>light</b> into single and few-mode fibres at the diffraction limit.
