In addition, Silaum fruits are elongated, divided and not flattened. [...] The mericarps (one carpel of umbelliferous fruit) have acute edges and five, rather low ridges. Plants in Silaus also have an oil tube in the fruit, called a vitta [...] - there is one vitta per every ridge of furrow (a vallecula), but are indistinct at maturity. The petals that surround the flowers are yellow.|$|E

The microstructures formed in culture and oxidase reactions of the cultures were compared with the microstructures present, the construction and type of decay of the <b>carpophores</b> from which they were made. Fhe type of interfertility of seven species was determined. Intercollection pairings of haploid mycelia derived from single basidiospores and the technique of dikaryotizing a large haploid mycelium growing in culture by pairing it with a small dikaryotic mycelium, were used to confirm the identity of different collections of eight different species. The literature on the classification, structure and anatomy of the <b>carpophores</b> and pure culture studies of Hymenomycetes. was reviewed. It {{was found that the}} 24 species were distributed among nine of the groups proposed by Nobles (1958) {{on the basis of their}} cultural characters.

50|$|A {{mericarp}} is {{a portion}} of the fruit that separates from the ovary to form a distinct locule unit which encloses the seed, usually-nut-like, as in Apiaceae in which the mericarps are joined by a stalk (<b>carpophore).</b> Thus a schizocarp of mericarps is a structure in which the carpels of a single ovary split to form mericarps. A schizocarp of nutlets is derived from a carpel that becomes lobed, and the lobes become nutlets that split apart. Examples include Boraginaceae and most Lamiaceae, where the styles are attached between the ovary lobes.|$|E

Introduced 23 strains of 8 species of Basidiomycetes. Methods. Gathered wild <b>carpophores</b> dried and crushed to a particle size of 0, 1 till 0, 01 mm and searching strains were cultured in Erlenmeyyers flasks by surface method on standard glucose-peptone culture medium. Determination of total content of polyphenolic compounds was carried out in ethanol extracts of mycological material by a modified method of Folin-Chokalteu. Completely dry biomass of <b>carpophores</b> and mycelium was determined gravimetrically. Results. There was identified the species of polyporal fungi Ganoderma applanatum, Ganoderma lucidum, Laetiporus sulphureus and Fomes fomentarius and types of agarical mushrooms Stropharia rugosoannulata, Agrocybe cylindracea, Tricholoma flavovirens, Flammulina velutipes, Pleurotus ostreatus and Fistulina hepatica high in polyphenolic compounds. It was determined the content of polyphenols ranging from more than 60 mg / g completely dry biomass. For introduced strains established dynamics of growth and accumulation of polyphenolic compounds in the mycelium and culture filtrate during fermentation on glucose-peptone medium. All cultures reach a maximum accumulation of biomass on the 12 th day of growth. Shizophyllum commune Sc- 1101 and 10 and F. velutipes F- 202 have been identified as the most productive strains. The lowest accumulation of absolutely dry biomass was recorded for strain P. ostreatus P- 192 and strain F. fomentarius Ff- 09. Cultures have investigated individual value growth such as biomass accumulation in the applied cultivation conditions, which probably reflects the suitability of the medium for their growth and genotypic characteristics. Strains are overwhelmingly able to accumulate polyphenolic compounds in both mycelium and culture fluid during the whole period of cultivation. Maximum content of polyphenols in the mycelium to 96 %, and in the culture fluid - for 91 % of strains coincided with the end of their term cultivation. Calculated correlation coefficient between the content of polyphenols in the mycelium and culture fluid showed that there is a very high positive correlation of 73. 2 %, a positive high at 17. 4 % and the average 4. 5 % of experiment data.

Statistical treatment was performed using the Statistica Program v. 6. Main results: The size of brûlés associated with Pinus was significantly smaller than that of brûlés associated with Quercus.

40|$|Samples of the edible {{mushroom}} Boletus edulis Bull. {{were studied}} {{to assess the}} risk for human health related to their content of the artificial radionuclide 137 Cs. Fresh B. edulis <b>carpophores</b> were collected in four undeveloped microhabitats of Lucca province (Tuscany, North-Central Italy). Dried non-cultivated samples coming from this same district and 11 other Italian provinces or European countries were instead purchased fromcommercial sources. Contents of 137 Cs, reported as Bq kg‒ 1 dry weight (dw), were measured by γ-spectrometry. The radionuclide concentration varied depending on the gathering site in fresh samples, with 41. 8 ± 5. 2 Bq kg‒ 1 dw at site 1 (Tosco-Emiliani Apennine) and four-fold less, 12. 8 ± 1. 3 Bq kg‒ 1 dw, at site 2 (Apuan Alps). Moreover, fresh or dried <b>carpophores</b> from Lucca province displayed among the lowest 137 Cs contents in Europe. Average 137 Cs levels in all analysed samples were substantially below the legal threshold for edible mushrooms, 600 Bq kg‒ 1 dw. Conclusively, we report that 137 Cs amounts in B. edulis depend on both {{the distance from the}} Chernobyl accident and multifactorial features of collection sites. We also show that the consumption of European B. edulis does not represent a major health risk with respect to 137 Cs radio contamination...|$|R

O.) {{found at}} Kjugekull in the parish of Kiaby, some 15 km from Kristianstad (Sweden), three <b>carpophores</b> (young and mature stages) of a {{characteristic}} species of Psathyrella, which, because of its overall brown colours and small spores (6. 5 — 7 x 4. 5 — 5 μm) belongs to section Hydrophilae (Kits van Waveren, 1985. 172).
