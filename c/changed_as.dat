40|$|This article {{presents}} a qualitative {{study of the}} Royal Dutch/Shell Group’s (further - Shell) corporate image building in relation to climate change and how this image is represented in the British financial press. The material of the study involves the official 2014 Shell’s annual report (further - AR) and online coverages of Shell’s climate change-related activities by the leading British financial newspapers, The Economist and The Financial Times (further – The FT). Shell’s image of climate change is investigated by means of identification of conceptual metaphors viewed through the lenses of the methodological apparatus of cognitive linguistics. Conceptual metaphors identified in the 2014 AR are subsequently juxtaposed with conceptual metaphors associated with Shell’s climate-change activities in The Economist and in The FT. The results reveal that Shell’s 2014 AR involves the following conceptual metaphors associated with climate change: ‘Climate <b>Change</b> <b>as</b> a Journey’, ‘Climate <b>Change</b> <b>as</b> a Battle’, ‘Shell as a Responsible Citizen’, ‘Shell as a Caring Corporation’, ‘Climate <b>Change</b> <b>as</b> Growth’, and ‘Climate <b>Change</b> <b>as</b> Money’. In contrast with these conceptual metaphors, The Economist represents Shell’s climate change activities in 2014 via ‘Shell as an Immoral Corporation’ and ‘Shell as a Sinner’. The FT frames Shell’s climate change agenda in 2014 by means of conceptual metaphors ‘Climate <b>Change</b> <b>as</b> Growth’, ‘Climate <b>Change</b> <b>as</b> a Journey’, and ‘Climate <b>Change</b> <b>as</b> Money’ respectively. The discrepancies between Shell’s self-image of climate change and its representations by The Economist and The FT are further presented and discussed in the article...|$|R

5|$|According to Kaneko, {{the reason}} for {{choosing}} the Judeo-Christian god, YHVH, as the game's antagonist, was that he saw YHVH as the base for all other gods around the world: Having observed common motives throughout different mythologies, such as the flood {{and the creation of}} the world, he reasoned that they all originated in one single mythology, which had been <b>changed</b> <b>as</b> people took it with them, leading to modern-day myths. He thought the original mythology would be the Old Testament, and therefore considered YHVH the folkloristic base of all gods. Despite casting YHVH as the antagonist, Kaneko noted that he did not intend for YHVH to be evil incarnate in Megami Tensei.|$|E

Before deciding that every Soul Reaper had swords, Kubo thought that they all should use guns, while only Rukia used a scythe. However, this was <b>changed</b> <b>as</b> he created the Soul Reaper kimono. Kubo also mentioned that Rukia did not seem like a lead character, so he created Ichigo Kurosaki to be the series protagonist.

Olivier later recalled an incident when her mood rapidly <b>changed</b> <b>as</b> she was preparing to go onstage.

She was able to perform without mishap, and by the following day she had returned to normal with no recollection of the event. It {{was the first time}} Olivier witnessed such behaviour from her. They began living together, as their respective spouses had each refused to grant either of them a divorce.

5|$|Initially the Order was a knightly brotherhood (Rittersbruderschaft), {{reflecting}} the overlapping religious and military aspects of medieval court life. Saint Hubert was {{the patron saint}} of hunters and knights. The founding of the Order of the Golden Fleece in the early 15th century started a trend in confraternal princely orders. The purpose of these, whether established by monarchs or princes, was to foster loyalty to a sovereign, replacing to the old Chivalric orders developed in the Crusades. Although some historians classify the Order of the Saint Hubert as a confraternal order, during its 600-year-life, its purpose <b>changed</b> <b>as</b> the fortunes and needs of the Dukes of Jülich and Berg and their successors changed.|$|E

The invasion was judged as illegal by the League of Nations, which expelled the Soviet Union on December 14. Following the Soviet attack, C.G.E.
