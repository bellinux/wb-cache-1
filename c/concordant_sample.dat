40|$|One of {{the core}} {{behavioral}} features associated with obsessive compulsive symptomatology is the inability to inhibit thoughts and/or behaviors. Neuroimaging studies have indicated abnormalities in frontostriatal and dorsolateral prefrontal - anterior cingulate circuits during inhibitory control in patients with obsessive compulsive disorder compared with controls. In the present study, task performance and brain activation during Stroop color-word and Flanker interference were compared within monozygotic twin pairs discordant for obsessive compulsive symptoms and between groups of pairs scoring very low or very high on obsessive compulsive symptoms, {{in order to examine}} the differential impact of non-shared environmental versus genetic risk factors for obsessive compulsive symptomatology on inhibitory control related functional brain activation. Although performance was intact, brain activation during inhibition of distracting information differed between obsessive compulsive symptom high-scoring compared to low-scoring subjects. Regions affected in the discordant group (e. g., temporal and anterior cingulate gyrus) were partly different from those observed to be affected in the concordant groups (e. g., parietal gyrus and thalamus). A robust increase in dorsolateral prefrontal activity during response interference was observed in both the high-scoring twins of the discordant sample and the high-scoring twins of the <b>concordant</b> <b>sample,</b> marking this structure as a possible key region for disturbances in inhibitory control in obsessive compulsive disorder. © The Authors 2012...|$|E

With improved HCV therapy, challenges regarding HCV diagnosis, such as seronegative window period, false positive readings, and differentiation between recent, chronic, and resolved infections, are of increasing importance. To address these challenges an innovative device—SMARTube HIV & HCV—was used. Blood samples were tested for anti-HCV antibodies before and after incubation in the SMARTube, which promotes the in vitro stimulation of in vivoHCV primed lymphocytes, thus enhancing levels of anti-HCV antibodies. Comparing antibody levels, in <b>concordant</b> <b>samples</b> before and after SMARTube, yielded the Stimulation Index (SI). Among 5888 fresh blood samples, from various populations and regions worldwide, 641 were seropositive using plasma, while SMARTube processing (yielding enriched plasma, termed SMARTplasma) enabled diagnosis of 10 additional carriers in high-risk cohorts, that is, earlier detection.

40|$|Most {{highland}} total rock samples {{define a}} single U-Pb isochron which {{corresponds to a}} metamorphism age of about 3. 9 aeons. This age is also obtained for internal U-Pb isochrons {{for some of these}} samples. The data on 18 rock <b>samples</b> range from <b>concordant</b> <b>samples</b> with U- 238 /Pb- 206 ratio of about 1. 2 to discordant ones with U- 238 /Pb- 206 ratio of about 0. 02. This feature, coupled with a correlated pattern of U- 238 /Pb- 204 ratios, indicates that Pb was extensively mobilized at about 3. 9 aeons. The observed Pb-U fractionation is essentially due to Pb volatilization during the metamorphic events. Volatile Pb transport is not accompanied by similar effects in Rb and must therefore be attributed to a specific process. Rb-Sr internal isochrons for the same rocks determine distinct metamorphic events in the interval 3. 85 to 4. 00 aeons. It is concluded that highland samples from widely separated areas bear the imprint of an event or series of events in a narrow time interval which can be identified with a cataclysmic impacting rate of the moon at about 3. 9 aeons, although diffrentiation by internal magma generation cannot be excluded...|$|R

The tests were first compared to the monoclonal antibody (MAb) EIA (Central Public Health Laboratory, London, United Kingdom). Samples that gave discordant results in the MAb EIA and in the three tests that performed best compared to the MAb EIA were tested by Western blotting (University of Washington, Seattle).

40|$|Objectives: To study human {{papillomavirus}} (HPV) anal infection in anal brushings from women attending a proctology clinic, and compare results with those obtained from paired cervical brushings. Methods: Women attending a university hospital proctology clinic for anal conditions or {{as part of}} a screening campaign, were enrolled consecutively, excluding those reporting previous HPV-related pathologies. HPV genotypes in anal and cervical brushings were determined by sequencing and, in most cases, type-specific viral loads were measured. Results: HPV DNA was detected in 28. 3 % of anal brushings, with 47. 4 % of HPV genotypes being high risk. Cervical HPV detection was at almost the same rate but HPV status was discordant in about half those women with at least one positive specimen. Abnormal cytological findings were more common in anal than in cervical samples, in particular in the proctology outpatients. Viral load measurements excluded the existence of a multiple infection with genotypes detected in discordant anal-and cervical-paired samples and showed a significant correlation between anal and cervical paired <b>concordant</b> <b>samples.</b> Conclusions: The high rate of HPV detection in anal brushings that is not usually related to HPV positivity in cervical brushings could provide support for offering HPV DNA tests to women attending proctology clinics.

A ~ 4 nA O – primary beam was used to sputter a 5 ~ 7 -µm-diameter crater and secondary positive ions were extracted for mass analysis using a Mattauch-Herzog geometry. The multi-collector system was modified to simultane-ously detect 140 Ce+, 204 Pb+, 206 Pb+, 238 U 16 O+, and 238 U 16 O 2 + ions. A mass resolution of 4100 at 1 % peak height was at-tained with a flat peak top, while the sensitivity of Pb was about 4 cps/nA/ppm. A monazite from North-Central Madagas-car with a U-Pb age of 524. 9 ± 3. 1 Ma (2 σ) obtained by thermal ionization mass spectrometry {{was used as a}} reference for Pb+/UO+- UO 2 +/UO+ calibration. Based on the positive correlation, we have determined the 206 Pb/ 238 U ratios of samples. 207 Pb/ 206 Pb ratios were measured by a magnet scanning with a single collector mode. Then 44 monazite grains extracted from a sedimentary rock in Taiwan were analyzed. Observed ages were compared with the U-Th-Pb chemical ages by electron microprobe. 238 U- 206 Pb ages agree well with those of the chemical ages except for some samples. The discrep-ancy may be due to an over-estimation of radiogenic Pb by the chemical method. 207 Pb- 206 Pb ages also agree with the chemical ages while there are a few discordant samples.

40|$|The {{possibility}} of performing genotypic tropism testing (GTT) with proviral DNA (pvDNA) even during suppressed viremia would facilitate {{the use of}} CCR 5 inhibitors as part of switching, simplification, or intensification strategies. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the tropism concordance between plasma RNA and pvDNA samples and to assess which factors could affect possible discrepancies between the two compartments. GTT was performed using both plasma RNA and pvDNA from 55 sample pairs from drug-experienced patients. Potential {{differences between the two}} compartments were evaluated by analyzing coreceptor usage and genetic variability. Paired samples were also stratified in three levels of viremia (500 copies/ml). Overall, Geno 2 Pheno comparisons of false-positive rates in the two compartments showed good correlation (r = 0. 72). A high level of concordance in tropism predictions for the two compartments was found (46 / 55 sample pairs [83. 6 %]). Among the 9 sample pairs with discordant tropisms, a larger proportion of pvDNA samples harboring CXCR 4 /dual-mixed-tropic viruses was found, in comparison with plasma RNA samples (88. 9 % versus 11. 1 %; P = 0. 0034). Discordant samples were characterized by greater genetic variability than were <b>concordant</b> <b>samples.</b> With stratification of the paired samples according to viremia levels, the prevalence of discordant samples decreased with increasing viremia (500 copies/ml, 6. 7 %; P = 0. 2).

In this study we assessed the reproducibility of digital PCR (dPCR) assays of circulating tumor DNA in a cohort of patients with advanced breast cancer and assessed delayed plasma processing using cell free DNA preservative tubes. We recruited a cohort of 96 paired samples from 71 women with advanced breast cancer who had paired blood samples processed either immediately or delayed in preservative tubes with processing 48 - 72 hours after collection. Plasma DNA was analysed with multiplex digital PCR (mdPCR) assays for hotspot mutations in PIK 3 CA, ESR 1 and ERBB 2, and for AKT 1 E 17 K. There was 94. 8 % (91 / 96) agreement in mutation calling between immediate and delayed processed tubes, kappa 0. 88 95 % CI 0. 77 - 0. 98). Discordance in mutation calling resulted from low allele frequency and likely stochastic effects. In <b>concordant</b> <b>samples</b> there was high correlation in mutant copies per ml plasma (r 2 = 0. 98; p< 0. 0001). There was elevation of total cell free plasma DNA concentrations in 10. 3 % of delayed processed tubes, although overall quantification of total cell free plasma DNA had similar prognostic effects in immediate (HR 3. 6) and delayed (HR 3. 0) tubes. There was moderate agreement in changes in allele fraction between sequential samples in quantitative mutation tracking (r = 0. 84, p = 0. 0002).

Kinetic studies resulting in a plot of paraoxon versus diazoxon hydrolysis rates may be used to accurately predict PON 1192 geno-type. In this study, paraoxonase and diazoxonase activities in plasma were measured spec-trophotometrically using plasma while PCR-based PON 1192 genotyping was performed us-ing polymerase chain reaction followed by restriction digestion. The two-substrate assay-derived genotypes were cross-referred with those determined by PCR-based genotyping. When results did not concur, sequencing of the 99 -bp region spanning codon 192 of PON 1 was performed to verify the genotype. <b>Concordant</b> <b>samples</b> with high or low activities were sequenced for comparison. In addition, the rare PON 1194 WX polymorphism was examined as a source of discordance. The frequency of the PON 1192 Q allele in a Malaysian population comprising three ethnic groups (Malays, Chinese and Indians) was estimated to be 0. 46, and that of the PON 1192 R allele, 0. 54. Discordance between the genotype and phenotype was ob-served for two samples. One of the two subjects genotyped as PON 1192 QR and phenotyped as PON 1192 QQ. The sample showed low paraoxonase and diazoxonase activities. Sequencing confirmed that the genotype was PON 1192 QR. The other subject was genotyped as PON 1192 RR but phenotyped as PON 1192 QR. Sequencing showed that the genotype was in fact PON 1192 RR, with the subject showing relative high activities.

40|$|Background: The {{detection}} of BRAFV 600 mutations {{in patients with}} metastatic melanoma is important because {{of the availability of}} BRAF inhibitor therapy. However, the clinical relevance of the frequency of BRAFV 600 mutant alleles is unclear. Patients and Methods: Allele frequencies of BRAFV 600 mutations were analyzed byultra-deepnext-generation sequencing in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded melanoma tissue (75 primary melanomas and 88 matched metastases). In a second study, pretreatment specimens from 76 patients who received BRAF inhibitors were retrospectively analyzed, and BRAFV 600 allele frequencies were correlated with therapeutic results. Results: Thirty-five patients had concordantly BRAF-positive and 36 (48 %) patients had concordantly BRAF-negative primary melanomas and matched metastases, and four patients had discordant samples with low allele frequencies (3. 4 – 5. 2 %). Twenty-six of 35 patients with <b>concordant</b> <b>samples</b> had BRAFV 600 E mutations, three of whom had additional mutations (V 600 K in two patients and V 600 R in one) and nine patients had exclusively non-V 600 E mutations (V 600 K in eight patients and V 600 E -c. 1799 _ 1800 TG > AA- in one patient). The frequency of mutated BRAFV 600 alleles was similar in the primary melanoma and matched metastasis in 27 / 35 patients, but differed by > 3 -fold in 8 / 35 of samples. BRAFV 600 E allele frequencies in pretreatment tumor specimens were not significantly correlated with treatment outcomes in 76 patients with metastatic melanoma who were treated with BRAF inhibitors. Conclusions: BRAFV 600 mutation status and allele frequency is consistent in the majority of primary melanomas and matched metastases. A small subgroup of patients has double mutations.

40|$|Copy number {{variations}} (CNVs) in the CYP 2 D 6 gene {{contribute to}} interindividual variation in drug metabolism. As {{the most common}} duplicated allele in Asian populations is the nonfunctional CYP 2 D 6 * 36 allele, {{the goal of this}} study was to identify CNV assays that can differentiate between multiple copies of the CYP 2 D 6 * 36 allele and multiple copies of other CYP 2 D 6 alleles. We determined CYP 2 D 6 gene copy numbers in 32 individuals with known CYP 2 D 6 CNVs from the Coriell Japanese-Chinese panel using four quantitative real-time PCR assays. These assays target different regions of the CYP 2 D 6 gene: 5 '-flanking region, intron 2, intron 6, and exon 9 (Ex 9). The specific target site of the Ex 9 assay was verified by sequencing the PCR amplicon. Three of the CYP 2 D 6 CNV assays (5 '-flanking region, intron 2, and intron 6) estimated CYP 2 D 6 copy numbers that were concordant for all 32 individuals. However, the Ex 9 assay was concordant in only 10 of 32 <b>samples.</b> The 10 <b>concordant</b> <b>samples</b> did not contain any CYP 2 D 6 * 36 alleles and the 22 discordant samples contained at least one CYP 2 D 6 * 36 allele. In addition, the Ex 9 assay accurately quantified all of the non-CYP 2 D 6 * 36 alleles in all samples. Ex 9 amplicon sequencing indicated that it targets a region of CYP 2 D 6 exon 9 that undergoes partial gene-conversion in the CYP 2 D 6 * 36 allele. In conclusion, CYP 2 D 6 Ex 9 CNV assay can be used to determine the copy number of non-CYP 2 D 6 * 36 alleles. Selective amplification of non-CYP 2 D 6 * 36 sequence by the Ex 9 assay should be useful in determining the number of functional copies of CYP 2 D 6 in Asian populations...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: INTRODUCTION: Before any new {{methodology}} can {{be introduced}} into the routine diagnostic setting it must be technically validated against the established standards. To this end, a ring study involving five international pathology laboratories was initiated to validate chromogenic in situ hybridisation (CISHTM) against fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) as a test for assessing human epidermal growth factor receptor- 2 (HER 2) status in breast cancer. METHODS: Each laboratory performed CISHTM, FISH and IHC on its own samples. Unstained sections from each case were also sent to another participating laboratory for blinded retesting by CISHTM ('outside CISHTM'). RESULTS: A total of 211 invasive breast carcinoma cases were tested. In 76 cases with high amplification (HER 2 /CEP 17 ratio > 4. 0) by FISH, 73 cases (96 %) scored positive (scores [greater than or equal to] 6) by 'outside CISHTM'. For FISH-negative cases (HER 2 /CEP 17 ratio < 2. 0), 94 of 100 cases (94 %) had CISHTM scores indicating no amplification (score GBP 5), and only three cases were positive by CISHTM; in the three remaining cases, no CISHTM result could be obtained. For cases with low-level amplification using FISH (HER 2 /CEP 17 ratio 2. 0 - 4. 0), 20 of 35 had CISHTM scores indicating gene amplification. Inter-laboratory concordance for was also very high: 95 % for normal HER 2 copy number (1 - 5 copies); and 92 % for cases with HER 2 copy numbers [greater than or equal to] 6. CISHTM intra-laboratory concordance with IHC was 92 % for IHC-negative cases (IHC 0 / 1 +) and 91 % for IHC 3 + cases. Among IHC 2 + cases, CISHTM was 100 % <b>concordant</b> with <b>samples</b> showing high amplification by FISH, and 94 % <b>concordant</b> with FISH-negative <b>samples.</b> CONCLUSION: These results show that CISHTM inter-and intra-laboratory concordance to FISH and IHC is very high, even in equivocal IHC 2 + cases. Therefore, we conclude that CISHTM is a methodology that is {{a viable alternative to}} FISH in the HER 2 testing algorith...|$|R

In particular, a short tandem repeat polymorphism [GGCGGG] in the promoter region of ALOX 5 has been implicated as an important marker for inflammatory diseases. We developed a pyrosequencing assay to genotype the ALOX 5 short tandem repeat polymorphism using pyrosequencing technology that will make assessing this important genetic marker in large, diverse populations more accessible than using current methods.

While the viral type shows a clear association with therapeutic success, there is currently no evidence to that effect for HCV subtype, whose value is thus confined to epidemiological studies. The Abbott RealTime HCV Genotype II assay, {{through the use of}} Minor Groove Binder probes (MGB) is able to distinguish genotypes 1 to 6 (target 5 ’-UTR region) and subtypes 1 a and 1 b (NS 5 B region). In four different Italian centers a comparison between the Abbott RealTime HCV Genotype II assay and the Versant HCV Genotype 2. 0 (LIPA) has been performed. A total of 143 non selected samples with the request of HCV genotyping have been analysed. 141 / 143 samples (98. 6 %) have provided reportable results with both tests (2 indeterminates with LIPA). Concordance at the type level was 96. 5 % (136 / 141). Considering the 136 <b>concordant</b> <b>samples,</b> the distribution was as follows: type 1 = 61 (44. 9 %), 2 = 36 (26. 5 %), 3 = 21 (15. 4 %), 4 = 17 (12. 5 %) 5 = 1 (0. 7 %). Both assays assigned subtype in 56 / 61 (91. 8 %) samples of genotype 1 (3 and 2 samples only provided the type for LIPA and Abbott, respectively) and 50 / 56 (89. 3 %) had concordant subtype. It is worth to note that 4 of the 5 samples with discordant subtype Abbott 1 a/LiPA 1 b came from the only center that used for LIPA the 5 -UTR amplicon, loosing the benefit of the core region which has been introduced in the version 2 of the test to improve the accuracy in distinguishing between 1 a and 1 b. There was only one discordant sample at type level (Abbott 4, LIPA 1 b) which after sequencing and phylogenetic analysis was resolved as type 4. Four mixed infections were detected, 3 with the Abbott test (two 1 a+ 4 and one 1 b+ 3) and 1 with the LIPA test (1 a+ 3). In all cases the comparison test showed a single genotype 1 infection.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The aim of {{the present}} study was to compare RNALater with the usual method of liquid {{nitrogen}} snap freezing as a surrogate mRNA preservation method for functional analysis of separated alleles in yeast (FASAY). METHODS: A total of 81 patients with transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder underwent fresh tissue biopsies directly transferred into RNALater and stored at room temperature or at 4 degrees C for increasing time intervals until RNA processing. From this cohort of patients, 53 paired snap-frozen and RNALater preservative-suspended tissues were obtained. Samples immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen were further stored at - 80 degrees C. RESULTS: Of the 81 RNALater samples, 14 were not processed for FASAY because of RNA degradation. Of the remaining 67 samples, 15 (22 %) were FASAY-positive. Identical FASAY results were found for 50 of 53 (94. 4 %) paired samples and the percentage of red yeast colonies was highly correlated (Cohen's kappa< 0. 82; p< 0. 00001). A single p 53 missense mutation was found in each of the three discordant positive FASAY and was identical in each <b>concordant</b> positive <b>sample</b> (10 / 53). Storing samples in RNALater at room temperature for 3 days and at 4 degrees C for less than 1 month provided high-quality mRNA suitable for FASAY.

40|$|One {{limitation}} of small amplicon melting is {{the inability to}} genotype certain nearest-neighbor symmetric variations without manipulating the sample. We have developed a method for these exceptions: a high-resolution melting single nucleotide extension assay. Single nucleotide extension was performed in a new instrument, the LightScanner 32 (LS 32), which uses capillary reaction tubes and is capable of real-time PCR and sequential high-resolution melting of 32 samples. Asymmetric PCR used Platinum Taq and LC Green Plus in the master mix for target amplification. Dideoxynucleotides and extension oligonucleotides were sequestered in the tube cap and added post-PCR, maintaining a closed system. One dideoxynucleotides was used per capillary tube. Samples were cycled five times to incorporate dideoxynucleotides into the extension products using ThermoSequenase, followed by high-resolution melting. Single nucleotide polymorphisms from the RET proto-oncogene (n = 7), hemochromatosis (HFE, n = 30), coagulation factor 2 (F 2, n = 29), coagulation factor 5 (F 5, n = 30), and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR, n = 60) genes were genotyped. The DNA melting profiles identified the target single nucleotide polymorphisms by the lowest melting temperature transition. All genotypes had a distinctive melting pattern. The method was 100 % <b>concordant</b> with <b>samples</b> previously genotyped at HFE, MTHFR, and F 2 and 90 % concordant with F 5. F 5 discordants were genotyped correctly by redesigning the assay.

Of 123 blood specimens collected from 24 renal transplant recipients, BT and HC 2 assays detected 35 and 39 positive samples, respectively. The overall concordance rate {{between the two}} assays was 90 %. Discordant results were observed at low levels of viremia, so that 8 samples were HC 2 positive but BT negative and another 4 were BT positive but HC 2 negative. There was good correlation (R 2 = 0. 766; P < 0. 01) between the levels of CMV DNA and pp 65 antigenemia in the 31 <b>concordant</b> positive <b>samples.</b> Correlation between results obtained with the two assays was confirmed by longitudinal studies for a patient who developed clinical CMV disease. HC 2 may be more sensitive at low viremia levels and allow earlier detection of impending CMV disease. The BT assay offered {{the advantage of a}} rapid (2 -h) turnaround time. We conclude that BT and HC 2 assays have similar sensitivity and efficacy in the diagnosis and monitoring of CMV infection and disease in renal transplant recipients.

Whether QF-PCR should be used alone in most of the samples and in which karyotyping should also be offered is currently a topic of debate. We evaluated and compared the results obtained from 7679 prenatal samples in which conventional karyotype and QF-PCR had been performed, including 1243 chorionic villi and 6436 amniotic fluid <b>samples.</b> <b>Concordant</b> QF-PCR and karyotype results were obtained in 98. 75 % of the samples. An abnormal karyotype associated with adverse clinical outcome undetected by QF-PCR was found in 0. 05 % of samples. Therefore, QF-PCR can be used alone in a large number of samples studied in a prenatal laboratory, thereby reducing both the workload in cytogenetic laboratories and parental anxiety when awaiting results...|$|R
40|$|In {{the context}} of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, {{adenovirus}} infections are associated with relevant mortality and morbidity. Detection of adenovirus DNA by quantitative PCR is the “gold standard” for these patients. A total of 150 samples, namely, 78 whole-blood, 22 cerebrospinal fluid, 24 digestive biopsy, and 26 stool samples, from 29 patients, including 24 hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients, were tested {{for the detection of}} adenovirus using an in-house real-time quantitative PCR assay (A. Heim, C. Ebnet, G. Harste, and P. Pring-Akerblom, J. Med. Virol. 70 : 228 - 239, 2003) and the commercially available Adenovirus R-Gene kit. Adenovirus DNA was automatically isolated from whole-blood samples (Magna Pure LC system; Roche) or was manually extracted from other specimens (QIAamp; Qiagen) using the appropriate kit. The intra- and interassay reproducibilities and sensitivities were evaluated with cell culture supernatant dilutions. Of the 150 samples tested, 86 were found to be positive and 55 were found to be negative using both techniques. Nine (6 %) discordant results were obtained. In most cases, discrepant results concerned samples with low viral loads. Quantitative results for all <b>concordant</b> positive <b>samples</b> were analyzed using the Spearman correlation test. A good correlation between the results of the in-house assay and those of the kit assay was obtained (r = 0. 95; P < 0. 001). Regarding the threshold cycle value for internal control spiked samples, none of the 150 samples tested contained a PCR inhibitor. In conclusion, a relevant correlation of results between the in-house assay and the kit assay, as well as the high-quality reproducibility and sensitivity of the kit assay, warranted its use for follow-up of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipients...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The gold {{standard}} for respiratory virus testing is a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab, which is collected by a healthcare worker. Midturbinate (MT) swabs are an alternative due to their ease of collection and possible self-collection by patients. The objective {{of this study was}} to compare the respiratory virus isolation of flocked MT swabs compared to flocked NP swabs. METHODS: Beginning in October 2008, healthy adults aged 18 to 69 years were recruited into a cohort and followed up for symptoms of influenza. They were asked to have NP and MT swabs taken as soon as possible after the onset of a fever or two or more respiratory symptoms with an acute onset. The swabs were tested for viral respiratory infections using Seeplex® RV 12 multiplex PCR detection kit. Seventy six pairs of simultaneous NP and MT swabs were collected from 38 symptomatic subjects. Twenty nine (38 %) of these pairs were positive by either NP or MT swabs or both. Sixty nine (91 %) of the pair results were <b>concordant.</b> Two <b>samples</b> (3 %) for hCV OC 43 /HKU 1 and 1 sample (1 %) for rhinovirus A/B were positive by NP but negative by MT. One sample each for hCV 229 E/NL 63, hCV OC 43 /HKU 1, respiratory syncytial virus A, and influenza B were positive by MT but negative by NP. CONCLUSIONS: Flocked MT swabs are sensitive for the diagnosis of multiple respiratory viruses. Given the ease of MT collection and similar results between the two swabs, it is likely that MT swabs should be the preferred method of respiratory cell collection for outpatient studies. In light of this data, larger studies should be performed to ensure that this still holds true and data should also be collected on the patient preference of collection methods...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{the optimal}} {{combination}} of three commercial glycoprotein G- 2 (gG- 2) -based {{herpes simplex virus}} type 2 (HSV- 2) type-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (Euroimmun anti-HSV- 2 immunoglobulin G [IgG] ELISA [Eu 2], Gull HSV- 2 -specific IgG ELISA [Gu 2], and Radim HSV- 2 IgG ELISA [Ra 2]) and one gG- 2 -based HSV- 2 -specific immunoblot (Euroimmun anti-HSV- 1 /HSV- 2 gG Western blot [EuW]) was determined with regard to diagnostic performance and cost efficiency. Two hundred fifty serum samples were included in this study, 194 of which were from female prostitutes. When a formal primary “gold standard” was defined based on majority agreement of the commercial tests, with EuW being decisive in stand-off situations, the sensitivity and specificity of the assays in the samples from prostitutes were as follows: Eu 2, 100 and 89. 22 %; Gu 2, 94. 44 and 96. 08 %; Ra 2, 61. 18 and 95. 10 %; and EuW, 98. 90 and 100 %. The most cost-effective confirmatory strategy in the samples from prostitutes was screening with Eu 2, retesting positive and equivocal samples with Gu 2, and resolving the remaining discordant results with EuW (estimated additional costs per sample, 79. 02 %; sensitivity, 100 %; positive predictive value, 96. 81 %). Applying a self-developed gG- 2 -independent assay to the discordant and <b>concordant</b> negative <b>samples</b> in the samples from prostitutes suggested that the primary gold standard may have missed six HSV- 2 -positive samples. In conclusion, confirmatory strategies based on commercial gG- 2 -dependent seroassays result {{in an increase in}} the specificity of HSV- 2 -specific serology. However, further improvement of the sensitivity of current HSV- 2 -specific serology may require the additional exploitation of the gG- 2 -independent type-specific antibody response...|$|R
40|$|The Anyplex II HPV 28 (H 28; Seegene) {{is a new}} semiquantitative {{real-time}} multiplex PCR assay {{for screening}} and genotyping 28 human papillomaviruses (HPV) in only 2 reaction wells. H 28 was compared to the PGMY-CHUV assay (PG) with 309 archival DNA samples from cervical smears collected over 8 years in our laboratory. H 28 and PG were fully concordant at the genotypic level on 228 (73. 8 %) out of 309 samples: 27 HPV negative and 201 HPV positive. The 201 fully <b>concordant</b> positive <b>samples</b> corresponded to single infections (n = 145) and to multiple infections (2 genotypes, n = 38; 3 to 5 genotypes, n = 18). The remaining 81 samples (26. 2 %) were either partially concordant (n = 64, 20. 7 %) or fully discordant (n = 17, 5. 5 %). While genotype-specific agreement was nearly perfect (κ = 0. 877), HPV 51 was significantly less well detected by H 28 and the converse was observed for HPV 40, - 42, - 54, and - 68. Sequencing of PG amplicons confirmed HPV 51 discordants and suggested the involvement of a possibly local HPV 51 subtype. Mismatches in the PGMY 09 primers to HPV 68 a explained most of the HPV 68 discordants, confirming the specificity of H 28 toward HPV 68. With PG as a reference, the sensitivity and specificity of H 28 were 93. 4 % and 99. 0 %, respectively. Considering H 28 as a reference, the sensitivity and specificity of PG were 83. 8 % and 99. 6 %, respectively. H 28 is a very sensitive and specific HPV genotyping assay suitable for research and clinical use {{as an adjunct to}} a clinically validated test.

40|$|The rapid {{diagnosis}} of an infectious cause {{in the course}} of fever of unknown origin plays a pivotal role in the correct management of neutropenic patients. In this study, blood samples from febrile oncohaematological patients were tested using a novel commercial real-time PCR assay (LightCycler SeptiFast; Roche Molecular Systems) and blood culture (BacT/Alert 3 D; bioMérieux). Twenty-one (20. 4 %) and 34 (33 %) of the 103 samples under study tested positive by blood culture and PCR, respectively. The analysis of concordance evidenced a low correlation between the two approaches (83 %), mainly due to samples that tested negative by culture but positive using the molecular approach. Among 14 discordant cases negative by culture but positive by PCR, 12 were observed in sequential samples of patients with initial <b>concordant</b> results on <b>samples</b> drawn before the administration of a specific antimicrobial therapy. Moreover, DNA of a fastidious organism, Aspergillus fumigatus, not easily detectable by the cultural approach was rapidly detected in the two remaining discordant cases.

40|$|Indirect {{immunofluorescence}} (IIF) {{on human}} epithelial (HEp- 2) cells is considered as {{the gold standard}} screening method {{for the detection of}} antinuclear autoantibodies (ANA). However, in terms of automation and standardization, it {{has not been able to}} keep pace with most other analytical techniques used in diagnostic laboratories. Although there are already some automation solutions for IIF incubation in the market, the automation of result evaluation is still in its infancy. Therefore, the EUROPattern Suite has been developed as a comprehensive automated processing and interpretation system for standardized and efficient ANA detection by HEp- 2 cell-based IIF. In this study, the automated pattern recognition was compared to conventional visual interpretation in a total of 351 sera. In the discrimination of positive from negative <b>samples,</b> <b>concordant</b> results between visual and automated evaluation were obtained for 349 sera (99. 4 %, kappa = 0. 984).

40|$|The genetic {{variation}} {{within and between}} wild apple samples (Malus sylvestris) and cultivated apple trees was investigated with amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP) and microsatellite markers to develop a conservation genetics programme for the endangered wild apple in Belgium. In total, 76 putative wild apples (originating from Belgium and Germany), six presumed hybrids and 39 cultivars were typed at 12 simple sequence repeats (SSR) and 139 amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) loci. Principal co-ordinate analysis and a model-based clustering method classified the apples into three major gene pools: wild Malus sylvestris genotypes, edible cultivars and ornamental cultivars. All presumed hybrids and two individuals (one Belgian, one German) sampled as M. sylvestris were assigned completely to the edible cultivar gene pool, revealing that cultivated genotypes {{are present in the}} wild. However, gene flow between wild and cultivated gene pools is shown to be almost absent, with only three genotypes that showed evidence of admixture between the wild and edible cultivar gene pools. Wild apples sampled in Belgium and Germany constitute gene pools that are clearly differentiated from cultivars and although some geographical pattern of genetic differentiation among wild apple populations exists, most variation is concentrated within <b>samples.</b> <b>Concordant</b> conclusions were obtained from AFLP and SSR markers, which showed highly significant correlations in both among-genotypes and among-samples genetic distance...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Differential co-expression {{analysis}} is an emerging strategy for characterizing disease related dysregulation of gene expression regulatory networks. Given pre-defined sets of biological samples, such analysis aims at identifying genes that are co-expressed in one, {{but not in}} the other set of samples. Results We developed a novel probabilistic framework for jointly uncovering contexts (i. e. groups of samples) with specific co-expression patterns, and groups of genes with different co-expression patterns across such contexts. In contrast to current clustering and bi-clustering procedures, the implicit similarity measure in this model used for grouping biological samples is based on the clustering structure of genes within each sample and not on traditional measures of gene expression level similarities. Within this framework, biological samples with widely discordant expression patterns can be placed in the same context as long as the co-clustering structure of genes is <b>concordant</b> within these <b>samples.</b> To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method to date for unsupervised differential co-expression analysis in this generality. When applied to the problem of identifying molecular subtypes of breast cancer, our method identified reproducible patterns of differential co-expression across several independent expression datasets. Sample groupings induced by these patterns were highly informative of the disease outcome. Expression patterns of differentially co-expressed genes provided new insights into the complex nature of the ER α regulatory network. Conclusions We demonstrated that the use of the co-clustering structure as the similarity measure in the unsupervised analysis of sample gene expression profiles provides valuable information about expression regulatory networks. </p...|$|R

The aim of the Swedish Twin study On Prediction and Prevention of Asthma (STOPPA) is to identify environmental (birth characteristics and early life) and genetic (including epigenetic) factors as determinants for asthmatic disease. Based on the Child and Adolescent Twin Study in Sweden (parental interview at 9 or 12 years, N~ 23, 900) and an asthma and/or wheezing algorithm, we identified a sample of monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) same-sexed twin pairs. The twin pairs were identified as asthma concordant (ACC), asthma discordant (ADC) and healthy <b>concordant</b> (HCC). A <b>sample</b> of 9 - to 14 -year-old twins and their parents {{were invited to participate}} in a clinical examination. Background characteristics were collected in questionnaires and obtained from the National Health Registers. A clinical examination was performed to test lung function and capacity (spirometry with reversibility test and exhaled nitric oxide) and collect blood (serology and DNA), urine (metabolites), feces (microbiota) and saliva (cortisol). In total, 376 twin pairs (752 individual twins) completed the study, response rate 52 %. All participating twins answered the questionnaire and > 90 % participated in lung function testing, blood and saliva sampling.

40|$|Background: Patients {{suffering}} from neuroblastic tumors {{are currently being}} classified into prognostic subsets based on different clinical and biologic features. In this study, a triple-color flow cytometric assay and a functional test were applied to neuroblastoma cell lines and patients with a neuroblastic tumor, {{and the value of}} P-glycoprotein expression and function as potential prognostic characteristics, was determined. Methods: Twenty-two single-cell suspensions prepared from tumors, and neuroblasts from four bone marrow samples were analyzed by triple-color flow cytometry. Neuroblasts were identified by NB 84 -positivity and absence of CD 45. P-glycoprotein expression was evaluated using 4 E 3 and MRK 16 antibodies. Eighteen samples were tested with a functional assay, based on accumulation and retention of rhodamine- 123 with and without the inhibitor verapamil. Six neuroblastoma cell lines were also evaluated. Results: P-glycoprotein expression was seen in 18 of 26 patient samples and in three of six cell lines. The highest expression levels were found in low stage neuroblastoma and well-differentiated tumors; whereas the highest activities were found in stage 4 neuroblastoma and the lowest in ganglioneuroblastoma and ganglioneuroma patients. In 10 of 17 <b>samples,</b> <b>concordant</b> results were found between the flow cytometric immunological test and immunocytochemistry. Conclusions: The described flow cytometric technique is a new, alternative approach to detect P-glycoprotein expression and function in neural crest tumors.

In particular, those patients with high P-glycoprotein activity might benefit from treatment regimens containing reversal agents. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
