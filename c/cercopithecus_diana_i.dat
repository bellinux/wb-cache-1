50|$|The <b>Diana</b> monkey (<b>Cercopithecus</b> <b>diana)</b> is an Old World monkey {{found in}} West Africa, from Sierra Leone to Côte d'Ivoire.|$|R
50|$|Primates in {{the park}} include the Colobus vellerosus (VU), Procolobus verus (LR/nt), <b>Cercopithecus</b> <b>diana</b> roloway (CR) and Loxodonta africana cyclotis (EN); the latter is found {{throughout}} the country.|$|R
40|$|A 16 -year-old <b>Diana</b> monkey (<b>Cercopithecus</b> <b>diana</b> diana) {{with chronic}} renal {{insufficiency}} was evaluated for progressive weight loss. The examination revealed a subcutaneous mass on the left carpus. Fluid was aspirated and disclosed numerous, shiny, nonbirefringent particles that stained bright red with bright red S. The mineral present was identified as apatite by high resolution X-ray crystallographic analysis. Later, similar masses developed near the left ischium and the right tarsus. The monkey was euthanatized and a necropsy performed. The histological studies revealed profuse amounts of hematoxyphilic material surrounded by fibrosis, histiocytes, and multinucleated giant cells. Transmission electron microscopy showed clumps of intracellular fine needle-shaped crystals typical for apatite. These apatite deposits were probably related to an increased serum calcium x phosphorus product secondary to the renal disease...|$|R
40|$|Some animal vocalizations {{have been}} {{described}} as referential, or semantic, because individuals respond to them as if they designate some object or event. Alternatively, subjects may simply attend to the acoustic features of calls rather than their meanings. Field playback experiments on <b>diana</b> monkeys (<b>Cercopithecus</b> <b>diana</b> diana) tested these hypotheses using the calls of leopards and eagles and the males' alarm calls to these predators. In the experiment, 2 calls were played in sequence, separated by 5 min of silence, such that they were either (a) similar in acoustic and semantic features, (b) similar in semantic features only, or (c) different in both acoustic and semantic features. Subjects readily transferred habituation across acoustic but not semantic features, suggesting that they attended to the calls' underlying meanings...|$|R

The main objective {{of this study was}} to provide baseline data on fecal parasites in the cercopithecid monkeys inhabiting Côte d’Ivoire’s Taï National Park. Seven of eight cercopithecid species present in the park were sampled: <b>Cercopithecus</b> <b>diana,</b> <b>Cercopithecus</b> campbelli, Cercopithecus petaurista, Procolobus badius, Procolobus verus, Colobus polykomos, and Cercocebus atys. We collected 3142 monkey stool samples between November 2009 and December 2010. Stool sam-ples were processed by direct wet mount examination, formalin-ethyl acetate concentration, and MIF (merthiolate, iodine, formalin) concentration methods.

40|$|International audienceCompared to humans, {{non-human}} primates {{have very}} little control over their vocal production. Nonetheless, some primates produce various call combinations, which may partially offset their lack of acoustic flexibility. A relevant example is male Campbell's monkeys (Cercopithecus campbelli), which give one call type ('Krak') to leopards, while the suffixed {{version of the same}} call stem ('Krak-oo') is given to unspecific danger. To test whether recipients attend to this suffixation pattern, we carried out a playback experiment in which we broadcast naturally and artificially modified suffixed and unsuffixed 'Krak' calls of male Campbell's monkeys to 42 wild groups of <b>Diana</b> monkeys (<b>Cercopithecus</b> <b>diana</b> diana). The two species form mixed-species groups and respond to each other's vocalizations. We analysed the vocal response of male and female Diana monkeys and overall found significantly stronger vocal responses to unsuffixed (leopard) than suffixed (unspecific danger) calls. Although the acoustic structure of the 'Krak' stem of the calls has some additional effects, subject responses were mainly determined by the presence or the absence of the suffix. This study indicates that suffixation is an evolved function in primate communication in contexts where adaptive responses are particularly important...|$|R
40|$|It is {{generally}} assumed that most primates live in monospecific or polyspecific groups because group living provides protection against predation, but hard evidence is scarce. We tested the antipredation hypothesis with observational and experimental data on mixed-species groups of red colobus (Procolobus badius) and <b>diana</b> monkeys (<b>Cercopithecus</b> <b>diana)</b> in the Taï National Park, Ivory Coast. Red colobus, but not diana monkeys, are frequently killed by cooperatively hunting chimpanzees. Association rates peaked during the chimpanzees' hunting season, {{as a result}} of changes in the behaviour of the red colobus. In addition, playbacks of recordings of chimpanzee sounds induced the formation of new associations and extended the duration of existing associations. No such effects were observed in reaction to control experiments and playbacks of leopard recordings...|$|R
30|$|Cowlishaw and Dunbar (2000) {{stated that}} even though most {{primates}} are vegetarians, most eat small amounts of animal matter, which is highly nutritious and contains vitamin B 12 which primates cannot synthesize or obtain from non-animal sources. Curtin (2002) {{found out that the}} <b>Cercopithecus</b> <b>diana</b> roloway spent more time on Piptadeniastrum africanum feeding primarily on small immobile insects in the terminal branches; since insect foraging sessions may last more than one hour, and on the same day monkeys may move from one Piptadeniastrum africanum to another throughout the day. Bourliere et al. (1970) concluded that though the staple food of Lowe’s monkeys is predominantly fruits or vegetables, insects constitute an important part of their diet, probably providing the monkeys with the amino acids essential for growth and reproduction.|$|R
40|$|Since {{more than}} a century the »Diana” has become such a well known Monkey that every child can show it you in every Zoological Garden. Therefore it may be called {{somewhat}} hazardously to move the supposition that — although it seems to be so familiar an animal to children — it has always been misunderstood by naturalists and scientific authors. In our collection there are 9 specimens (among them 2 from the Gold-coast and 4 from Liberia) all labeled <b>Cercopithecus</b> <b>diana.</b> Some weeks ago Mr. Oscar Neumann, the excellent German Africa-traveller, {{told me that he had}} observed some differences between our Liberia- and Gold-coast-specimens, differences sufficiently striking to regard upon them as two distinct species. I now have studied the thing and believe to be able to explain the question exactly...|$|R
40|$|Primate long-distance calls have {{typically}} been interpreted as communication signals between conspecific groups (the ‘resource defence hypothesis’), but their potential role as anti- predator alarm calls has received comparably little attention. Male <b>diana</b> monkeys, <b>Cercopithecus</b> <b>diana</b> diana, in the Taï forest of Côte d’Ivoire often utter long-distance calls, either spontaneously or {{in reaction to}} a variety of stimuli, including predators and non-predators. The present study focuses only on predation contexts and provides evidence for communication to both predators and conspecifics. Males called only in response to predators whose hunting success depends on unprepared prey, that is, leopards and crowned hawk eagles, but not in response to pursuit hunters, such as chimpanzees and humans, which can pursue the caller in the canopy. Calling was regularly combined with approaching the predator. Both observations suggest that male long-distance calls are used to signal detection to the predator (‘perception advertisement hypothesis’). Analysis of male long-distance calls given to leopards and eagles showed that they differed according to a number of acoustic parameters. The two call variants were played to different diana monkey groups; conspecifics responded to them as though the original predator were present. We conclude that, in addition to their function in perception advertisement, diana monkey long-distance calls function as within-group semantic signals that denote different types of predators...|$|R
40|$|Converging {{experimental}} and observational {{evidence suggests that}} some non-human primates are able to co-orient with shifts in visual attention, both of conspecifics and humans. However, the underlying cognitive mechanisms involved are unclear. To investigate attention-following in <b>Diana</b> monkeys (<b>Cercopithecus</b> <b>diana</b> diana), we used photographs of familiar conspecifics orienting towards one of two locations. A subject monkey was shown a photograph, and shortly afterwards a toy appeared at one location or the other. The toy’s position therefore either matched the location signalled by the head and body orientation of the photographed monkey (compatible), or was opposite to that location (incompatible). Overall, monkeys’ first inspections, total duration of looking, and number of looks {{were more likely to}} be directed to the compatible location, i. e. towards the direction of attention shown in the photograph. Furthermore, when a photograph of an adult monkey signalled attention to one location, but the toy appeared at the opposite (incompatible) location, subjects re-inspected the monkey photographs more often than when the toy appeared at the compatible location, suggesting a violation of expectancy. This effect was not the case if the photograph was of an immature animal. Our results show that attention-following was not limited to simple reflexive orienting by the monkeys, and that monkeys perceived a relationship existing between agent and object of attention. Postprin...|$|R
40|$|Some mammals {{distinguish}} between and respond appropriately to the alarm calls of other mammal and bird species. However, {{the ability of}} birds to {{distinguish between}} mammal alarm calls has not been investigated. <b>Diana</b> monkeys (<b>Cercopithecus</b> <b>diana)</b> produce different alarm calls to two predators: crowned eagles (Stephanoaetus coronatus) and leopards (Panthera pardus). Yellow– casqued hornbills (Ceratogymna elata) are vulnerable to predation by crowned eagles but are not preyed on by leopards and might therefore be expected {{to respond to the}} Diana monkey eagle alarm call but not to the leopard alarm call. We compared responses of hornbills to playback of eagle shrieks, leopard growls, Diana monkey eagle alarm calls and Diana monkey leopard alarm calls and found that they distinguished appropriately between the two predator vocalizations as well as between the two Diana monkey alarm calls. We discuss possible mechanisms leading to these responses...|$|R

40|$|In Taï National Park, Ivory Coast, humans {{with guns}} hunt monkeys for their meat. The poachers imitate animal calls to feign the {{presence}} of eagles or leopards, two predators to which monkeys react with high calling rates and approach. In {{the presence of}} humans, monkeys become silent and move off. A small area of the park is now avoided by poachers, due {{to the establishment of}} a field project on chimpanzees in 1979. This offered the opportunity to investigate whether sudden changes in predation pressure lead to a rapid alteration in prey behaviour. Playback experiments, using groups of <b>Diana</b> monkeys, <b>Cercopithecus</b> <b>diana,</b> as subjects, revealed that the poachers' strategy works well in the home range of the habituated chimpanzee group. However, monkeys which are frequently exposed to poachers are rarely fooled by the imitations. Adaptive discrimination abilities can thus be acquired or lost within the lifespan of individual monkeys...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{contrast}} to humans, non-human primates are famously {{unable to control}} their vocal behavior, learn new utterances, and combine existing ones in creative ways. However, {{recent studies have shown}} that, despite strong genetic control, acoustic plasticity exists in several primate calls. For example, many forest dwelling species rely strongly on vocal signals, with calls used to regulate social behavior showing considerable degrees of acoustic flexibility. Our ongoing research with free-ranging <b>Diana</b> monkeys (<b>Cercopithecus</b> <b>diana</b> diana) of Taï National Park, Ivory Coast, is designed to examine the influences of various social and environmental factors on the evolution of acoustic flexibility in these monkeys’ vocal repertoire. Diana monkeys are known for their ability to produce referential alarm calls but little is known about females’ close-range vocalizations. A first field study conducted in 2009 has revealed that adult females emit several acoustically and contextually distinct subtypes of contact calls. Social and environmental factors, such as group activity, proximity to neighbors, or general visibility, were significantly related to a structural classification based on acoustic parameters. We are currently investigating the potential function of the different subtypes. Data are collected at the individual level using focal sampling on adult females of two fully habituated free-ranging Diana monkey groups. We will examine a number of potential social and environmental functions (e. g. spatial cohesion, social bonding, habitat visibility) to investigate which ones have led to the evolution of acoustic flexibility and which ones have had no impact...|$|R

40|$|West African <b>Diana</b> monkeys (<b>Cercopithecus</b> <b>diana)</b> and Campbell's monkeys (Cercopithecus campbelli) {{frequently}} form mixed-species associations. Males of both species produce acoustically distinct alarm {{calls to}} crowned eagles (Stephanoaetus coronalus) and leopards (Panthera pardus), {{two of their}} main predators. Field playback experiments were conducted to investigate whether Diana monkeys respond to Campbell's alarm calls and whether they understand the calls' semantic content. Diana monkeys responded to playback of Campbell's leopard or eagle alarm calls as though the original predator were present. In a second experiment, Diana monkeys were primed with either Campbell's eagle or leopard alarm calls and then subsequently probed with the vocalizations of a crowned eagle or a leopard. Results showed that monkeys used the semantic information conveyed by the Campbell's alarm calls to predict {{the presence of a}} predator. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that non-human primates are able to use acoustic signals of diverse origin as labels for underlying mental representations...|$|R
40|$|Individually {{distinct}} vocalizations are widespread {{among social}} animals, presumably caused by variation in vocal tract anatomy. A less-explored source of individual variation {{is due to}} learned movement patterns of the vocal tract, {{which can lead to}} vocal convergence or divergence in social groups. We studied patterns of acoustic similarity in a social call produced by 14 female <b>Diana</b> monkeys (<b>Cercopithecus</b> <b>diana)</b> in two free-ranging groups. Calls showed variability in fundamental frequency contours owing to individual identity and external context. Vocal divergence increased significantly between females during poor visibility and tended to increase in the presence of neighbours. In contrast, vocal convergence increased significantly between females during vocal interactions, because females matched the frequency contour of their own call with another females preceding call. Our findings demonstrate that these primates have some control over the acoustic fine structure of their most important social vocalization. Vocal convergence and divergence are two opposing processes that enable callers to ensure spatial proximity and social cohesion with other group members...|$|R

40|$|Putty-nosed monkeys, Cercopithecus nictitans stampflii, {{occur at}} various sites in West Africa, {{particularly}} in the transition zone between rainforest and savannah. The species is sometimes seen in primary rainforest, although at a curiously low density {{compared with that of}} other monkey species. We conducted a 24 -month field study in the tropical rainforest of Taı ̈ National Park, Ivory Coast, and found that putty-nosed monkeys require an ecological niche almost identical to that of the <b>Diana</b> monkeys, <b>Cercopithecus</b> <b>diana</b> diana. Moreover, the niche breadth of putty-nosed monkeys was significantly decreased in the presence of Diana monkeys, suggesting that feeding competition with Diana monkeys kept putty-nosed monkeys from successfully colonizing a rainforest habitat. However, contrary to the interspecies competition hypothesis, groups of both species almost completely overlapped in home ranges and formed near-permanent mixed-species associations, rather than avoiding each other. We hypothesized that Diana monkeys tolerated immigrating putty-nosed monkeys and formed mixed-species groups with them, despite high levels of competition, because of their merit in predation defense. Direct observations and a series of field experiments confirmed that male putty-nosed monkeys {{play a vital role in}} defense against crowned eagles, suggesting that putty-nosed monkeys obtain access to feeding trees by offering antipredation benefits to Diana monkeys.

40|$|International audienceA general {{pattern in}} animal {{behavior}} is that group-living species tend to bias their sociopositive behavior toward genetic relatives. In nonhuman primates, kin-biased social bonds {{have been reported}} in large multimale, multifemale macaque and baboon groups, but little is known for other species. We addressed this with a comparative study on the genetic and social organization of two sympatric forest guenons, <b>Diana</b> (<b>Cercopithecus</b> <b>diana)</b> and Campbell’s monkeys (Cercopithecus campbelli). We conducted long-term observations of social interactions in two groups of each species in their natural West African forest habitat and collected fecal samples for subsequent microsatellite genetic analyses. We found that both formed female-bonded, egalitarian social organizations. We then compared patterns of genetic relatedness, spatial proximity, and key social behaviors and found that females consistently targeted individuals other than their closest relatives to form social bonds. The fact that females did not preferentially favor genetic relatives contributes to a growing literature showing that social bonds, or “friendships,” among unrelated individuals {{plays a key role in}} primate social organizations...|$|R

To assess the monkeys' level of causal understanding, I primed monkeys to the presence of either a leopard or a human, before exposing them to playbacks of guinea fowl alarm calls. There were significant differences in the way leopard-primed groups and human-primed groups responded to guinea fowl alarm calls, suggesting that the monkeys' response was not directly driven by the alarm calls themselves but by the calls' underlying cause, i. e. the predator most likely to have caused the calls. Results are discussed with respect to three possible cognitive mechanisms - associative learning, specialized learning programs, and causal reasoning - that could have led to causal knowledge in Diana monkeys...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{prominent}} behavioural features of many forest primates are the loud calls given by the adult males. Early observational studies repeatedly postulated that these calls function in intragroup spacing or intergroup avoidance. More recent field experiments with <b>Diana</b> monkeys (<b>Cercopithecus</b> <b>diana)</b> of Ta Forest, Ivory Coast, have clearly shown that loud male calls function as predator alarm calls because calls reliably (1) label different predator classes and (2) convey semantic information about the predator type present. Here, I test the alarm call hypothesis another primate, the Campbell’s monkey (C. campbelli). Like Diana monkeys, male Campbell’s monkeys produce conspicuous loud calls to crowned hawk eagles (Stephanoaetus coronatus) and leopards (Panthera pardus), two of their main predators. Playback experiments showed that monkeys responded to the predator category represented by the different playback stimuli, regardless of whether they consisted of (1) vocalisations of the actual predators (crowned hawk eagle shrieks or leopard growls), (2) alarm calls to crowned hawk eagles or leopards given by other male Campbell’s monkeys or (3) alarm calls to crowned hawk eagles or leopards given by sympatric male Diana monkeys.

40|$|Syntactic rules allow {{a speaker}} to combine signals with {{existing}} meanings {{to create an}} infinite number of new meanings. Even though combinatory rules have also been found in some animal communication systems, they have never been clearly linked to concurrent changes in meaning. The present field experiment indicates that wild <b>Diana</b> monkeys, <b>Cercopithecus</b> <b>diana,</b> may comprehend the semantic changes caused by a combinatory rule present in the natural communication of another primate, the Campbell's monkey, C. campbelli. Campbell's males give acoustically distinct alarm calls to leopards, Panthera pardus, and crowned-hawk eagles, Stephanoaetus coronatus, and Diana monkeys respond to these calls with their own corresponding alarm calls. However, in less dangerous situations, Campbell's males emit a pair of low, resounding 'boom' calls before their alarm calls. Playbacks of boom-introduced Campbell's alarm calls no longer elicited alarm calls in Diana monkeys, indicating that the booms have affected the semantic specificity of the subsequent alarm calls. When the booms preceded the alarm calls of Diana monkeys, however, they were no longer effective as semantic modifiers, indicating that they are meaningful only in conjunction with Campbell's alarm calls.

40|$|International audienceSocial {{complexity}} {{is often}} {{thought of as a}} driving force in the evolution of communication and cognition, but this is at odds with the fact that nonhuman primates generally display only very limited flexibility in vocal production. Some primates partially overcome their limited vocal flexibility by combining two or more acoustically inflexible calls into complex sequences. Equally relevant is that some primate calls consist of separable morphological elements whose combinations create different meanings. Here, we focus on the vocal system of wild female <b>Diana</b> monkeys, <b>Cercopithecus</b> <b>diana,</b> which produce three call units (R, L, A) either singly or merged as RA or LA call combinations. Previous work has shown that R and L convey information about external events, while A conveys information about caller identity. We tested this hypothesis experimentally, by broadcasting artificially combined utterances to eight adult females. To test the significance of the R and L ‘event’ units, we merged them with the A ‘identity’ unit of a group member. To test the significance of the ‘identity’ unit, we merged an R ‘event’ unit with an ‘identity’ unit from a group member or a neighbouring individual. Subjects responded in ways that suggested that both event and identity units were relevant, suggesting that Diana monkeys’ social calls possess morphosemantic features.
