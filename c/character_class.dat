5|$|Each unit is {{assigned}} a <b>character</b> <b>class,</b> while affects their assigned weapon, strengths and weaknesses, and range {{and speed of}} movement on the battlefield. These classes range from axemen and swordsmen to thieves, to mounted units and magic users such as healers. Some characters, such as main protagonist Leif, have unique classes. Classes also naturally evolve {{during the course of}} the story. Mounted units have the option of dismounting their steeds to fight on-foot. Weapons within a unit's selected <b>character</b> <b>class</b> can be freely swapped out for more powerful versions: when mounted units dismount, they swap spears for axes or swords. Weapon effectiveness is governed by the Weapons Triangle: swords are strong against axes, axes against spears, and spears against swords.|$|E
5|$|Battles are turn-based {{and take}} place on grid-based maps. Victory is {{achieved}} when an enemy base is captured or all enemies are defeated. Each character holds four weapons and four items, and each has an assigned <b>character</b> <b>class,</b> which affects their movement range, damage and what weapons can be used. Mounted units also {{have the option to}} dismount, which changes their abilities and stats while reducing movement range.|$|E
5|$|Dragon Quest VI is a traditional, turn-based {{role-playing}} {{video game}} (in an overhead perspective) which features random battles and a <b>character</b> <b>class</b> system that the Hero {{and his party}} members acquire new skills and spells. The Hero travels around the world gathering a party throughout his adventure. To progress in the story, the party must defeat specific boss monsters or trigger specific flags. In order to defeat the bosses, the player must spend time training the party by gaining experience points from battles to advance in character and class levels.|$|E
50|$|Novus {{contains}} 8 <b>Character</b> <b>Classes</b> {{to choose}} from. However, 2 of those <b>character</b> <b>classes</b> {{allow for the}} player to select one or more Schools of Magic for his character. This small amount of customization brings the actual total number of different possible <b>Character</b> <b>Classes</b> up to 27 in total.|$|R
50|$|There {{are also}} a variety of classes available. They are divided up into Men at Arms, Men of Magic, Clergy, and {{optional}} Occupational <b>Character</b> <b>Classes</b> (O.C.C.s), as well as Psychic <b>Character</b> <b>Classes</b> (P.C.C.s) for <b>characters</b> whose abilities are primarily psychic in nature). As with most Palladium games, the <b>character</b> <b>classes</b> determine which skills are available to the character, and several grant special powers, as well.|$|R
50|$|While {{the game}} books rapidly {{expanded}} {{the number of}} <b>character</b> <b>classes</b> to a large number, the original game book contained four overall character groups with approximately 4 to 5 <b>character</b> <b>classes</b> per group.|$|R
5|$|Final Fantasy IX {{deviates}} {{from the}} style of customisable characters featured {{in the last two}} titles by reviving the <b>character</b> <b>class</b> concept, which designates a character to a certain role in battle. For example, Vivi is designated as a black mage and is the only character who can use black magic, and Steiner is a knight and is the only character who can use sword skills.|$|E
5|$|Like several {{installments}} in the series, Final Fantasy Tactics {{features a}} <b>character</b> <b>class</b> system, which allows players to customize characters into various roles. The game makes {{extensive use of}} most of the original character classes seen in earlier Final Fantasy games, including Summoners, Wizards (Black Mages), Priests (White Mages), Monks, Lancers (Dragoons), and Thieves. New recruits start out as either a Squire or a Chemist, the base classes for warrior and magician jobs, respectively. The game features twenty jobs accessible by normal characters.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{distinctive}} features of Golden Sun is the collection and manipulation of creatures called Djinn. The Djinn are scattered in hiding throughout the game; once found, they can be allocated to each character. They {{form the basis of}} the game's statistic enhancement, as well as the system that dictates the character's Psynergy capabilities. Attaching different Djinn to different characters modifies that character's <b>character</b> <b>class,</b> subsequently modifying hit points, Psynergy points, and other statistics, as well as determining what Psynergy the character is able to perform.|$|E
50|$|Some players {{created their}} own <b>character</b> <b>classes,</b> such as Ultraheroes, Elf Wizards, and Spellwarriors. TSR also printed some {{official}} variant rules in the Strategic Review and Dragon magazine, giving extra cards and new <b>character</b> <b>classes.</b>|$|R
50|$|Torchlight {{features}} three <b>character</b> <b>classes.</b>|$|R

5|$|Before {{the game}} begins, each player creates their player {{character}} and records the details (described below) on a character sheet. First, a player determines their character's ability scores, which consist of Strength, Constitution, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Each {{edition of the}} game has offered differing methods of determining these statistics. The player then chooses a race (species) such as human or elf, a <b>character</b> <b>class</b> (occupation) such as fighter or wizard, an alignment (a moral and ethical outlook), and other features to round out the character's abilities and backstory, which have varied in nature through differing editions.|$|E
5|$|Combat {{happens in}} real-time, {{featuring}} a hack and slash style where the player character attacks enemies highlighted with the mouse. As the character gains experience levels through completing quests and killing enemies, they can access Mastery skill trees linked to different combat styles, {{similar to a}} <b>character</b> <b>class</b> system: players can {{have access to a}} primary and secondary skill tree, which grand either passive or active boons upon characters. Items and equipment, which include new armor and weapons alongside healing potions, are acquired from defeated enemies or purchased from merchants. Players of the original Titan Quest can import their current selected character into Immortal Throne, while new players must complete the main campaign before accessing Immortal Throne.|$|E
5|$|Each of {{the five}} band members has a unique <b>character</b> <b>class,</b> which vary from one another mainly by the special magical attacks, called Anar-chi, that they can use. Anar-chi attacks include Tommy Homicide's ability to summon acid-coated buzzsaws and The Rexecutioner's ability to summon and use a debris-spitting drum kit. Players are able to use new {{abilities}} by visiting an in-game tattoo parlor. Tattoos, and the special abilities that they unlock, are character-specific. Players can also unlock new abilities, including additional combination attacks, group attacks, {{and the ability to}} use two weapons at once, by leveling up.|$|E

5|$|Final Fantasy IV offers twelve playable characters, {{each with}} a unique, {{unchangeable}} <b>character</b> <b>class.</b> During the game, the player can have a total of five, or fewer, characters in the party at any given time. The main character, Cecil Harvey, is a dark knight and {{the captain of the}} Red Wings, an elite air force unit of the kingdom of Baron. He serves the king alongside his childhood friend Kain Highwind, the commander of the Dragoons. Rosa Farrell is a white mage and archer, as well as Cecil's love interest. The Red Wings' airships were constructed by Cecil's friend, the engineer Cid Pollendina.|$|E
5|$|Fire Emblem: New Mystery of the Emblem is a {{tactical}} role-playing game which puts {{players in the}} role of a customizable Avatar: their gender, appearance, <b>character</b> <b>class</b> and statistics can be tailored by the player. Missions are split between story-based chapters and optional side chapters: side chapters give access to new playable characters outside the main narrative. Players can save at any time during battles, with the game opening offering a save {{at the end of each}} chapter. Outside battles, the player can visit towns to buy supplies and items such as weapons. Characters recruited by the player can also engage in support conversations accessed through the battle menu: these raise a character's support rank and grant boons during battle. How characters connect through supports is documented using a relationship chart.|$|E
5|$|Shadow Dragon retells {{the events}} of Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light. Set on the {{continent}} of Archanea, the story follows Marth, prince {{of the kingdom of}} Altea, as he is forced into exile from his lands when the evil wizard Gharnef and resurrected Dark Dragon Medeus begin their conquest of the continent. Forming new alliances with neighboring kingdoms, Marth must form a new army to retrieve the mystical Falchion sword and Fire Emblem shield to defeat both Gharnef and Medeus. The gameplay follows the Fire Emblem standards of turn-based battles played out on grid-based maps. Returning features include a <b>character</b> <b>class</b> system which evolves based on character usage, and permanent death for units defeated in battle.|$|E

5000|$|Limits on {{starting}} <b>character</b> <b>classes</b> {{and races}} All new characters {{were required to}} start at 1st level. Originally only races and <b>character</b> <b>classes</b> found in the Players Handbook were allowed. This was later modified to include some new <b>character</b> <b>classes</b> such as favoured soul and hexblade. Occasionally access to new races was granted under particular circumstances. For example, if a player chose to play the first adventure of the [...] "Bright Sands" [...] story arc, centaur could be chosen as a race. In another instance, a special card issued by RPGA allowed the player holding the card to create a kobold character.|$|R
5|$|The game {{begins with}} {{character}} creation, where the player assigns attribute points (such as strength, intelligence, charisma) to The Nameless One. The Nameless One starts {{the game as}} a fighter, but the player may later change his <b>character</b> <b>class</b> to thief or wizard, with the option to also change back to fighter, after finding corresponding tutors. The player may recruit adventuring companions {{over the course of}} the game; there are seven potential party members, but a maximum of five may accompany the player at any one time. Conversation is frequent among party members, occurring both randomly and during conversations with other non-player characters.|$|E
5|$|Titan Quest: Immortal Throne is an {{expansion}} pack to the 2006 action role-playing hack and slash video game Titan Quest. Developed by Iron Lore Entertainment, {{it was originally}} published by THQ in 2007: it would be Iron Lore's last original project prior to their closure in 2008. Following directly on from the events of Titan Quest, Immortal Throne follows the player character as they are confronted by {{a new wave of}} monsters attacking the mortal realm from the Underworld. Gameplay is identical to that of Titan Quest, with navigation through locations around the Ancient world and action combat. For Immortal Throne, improvements were made to the inventory system and multiplayer, and a new <b>character</b> <b>class</b> was added.|$|E
5|$|Battles {{play out}} using a turn-based system where each unit {{on both sides}} is given their chance to move and act. Characters move and attack within the same turn, {{and in a few}} cases units can take two moves in a turn. A key part of combat is the Weapons Triangle, a new {{addition}} which governs the opposing strengths and weaknesses of weapon types based on a rock–paper–scissors system - lances are stronger than swords, swords are stronger than axes, and axes are stronger than lances. A secondary system governs the magic system, where Fire, Lightning, and Wind spells have varying strengths and weaknesses against each other. Each unit has a <b>character</b> <b>class</b> which determines their weapon, skill set, movement and attack range, how much effect they have on other units, which latent skills they possess, and whether they use passive or aggressive skills when in combat. Different weapon types also affect character movement and battle performance: for instance, a powerful sword deals damage while slowing a character's movement.|$|E

5|$|Each {{unit has}} their own <b>character</b> <b>class,</b> with that class {{determining}} a unit's range of movement, weapon, and strengths and weaknesses. Classes range from on-foot units like swordsmen and knights, mounted units such as the series' recurring Pegasus Knights, and magic-wielding units such as Mages. Each class also has its own battle animation. Upon performing an action in battle, characters are awarded by experience points (EXP). Upon gathering enough EXP, the character levels up, and its statistics such as defense and critical strike rate are raised randomly. Using special items, a unit's class can be evolved into an Advanced Class, changing their class and altering their statistics. A Support system exists where characters who remain {{next to each other}} for a number of turns talk to each other, gaining Support Points and earning stat boosts. A limit is placed on the number of Support Points that can be earned when completing a single map.|$|E
5|$|Each unit {{is governed}} by a <b>character</b> <b>class</b> system, with their class {{affecting}} what weapons they can use. After each action in battle gains experience points (EXP). Upon reaching 100 EXP, a unit levels up and its statistics such as attack power and defense are randomly raised, while weapon ranks increase naturally when using their respective weapons. Upon reaching Level 10, and using a special item, a unit's class can be upgraded to a more powerful version with access to new items and weapons. If a unit is defeated in battle, {{they are subject to}} permanent death, being removed from all future encounters and the overall storyline with a few exceptions for story-related characters. If characters crucial to the storyline like Lyn, Eliwood or Hector fall, the game ends and the player must restart the level.|$|E
5|$|Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light is a {{tactical}} role-playing game where players {{take on the}} role of Marth and his growing army during their campaign across the continent of Archanea. The game progresses in a linear fashion, with maps being unlocked and played as dictated by the storyline. Each playable character is assigned a unique character classes that have various functions in battle, such as being mounted or having access to magic. A unit's class affects their range of movement and strength on the battlefield; mounted or flying units have greater mobility, archers have a greater attack range, while heavily armored characters have more damage resistance. Each character has a set <b>character</b> <b>class,</b> and each time a unit raises its experience level, its various stats increase randomly. There are a total of 25 characters that can be recruited {{over the course of the}} game, and 21 available classes for the majority of characters, with the exception of main protagonist Marth.|$|E
