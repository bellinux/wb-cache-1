40|$|In Australia, {{dairy cattle}} account for ~ 12 % of the nation’s {{agricultural}} greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions. Genetic selection {{has had a}} positive impact, reducing GHG emissions from dairy systems mainly due to increased production per cow, {{which has led to}} (1) requiring fewer cows to produce the same amount of milk and (2) lowering emissions per unit of milk produced (emission intensity). The objective {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the consequences of previous and current genetic-selection practices on carbon emissions, using realised and predicted responses to selection for key traits that are included in the Australian national breeding objective. A farm model was used to predict the carbon dioxide equivalent (<b>CO₂-eq)</b> emissions per unit change of these traits, while holding all other traits constant. Estimates of the realised change in annual <b>CO₂-eq</b> emissions per cow over the past decade were made by multiplying predicted <b>CO₂-eq</b> emissions per unit change of each trait under selection by the realised rates of genetic gain in each of those traits. The total impact is estimated to be an increase of 55 kg CO₂-eq/cow. year after 10 years of selection. The same approach was applied to future <b>CO₂-eq</b> emissions, except predicted rates of genetic gain assumed to occur over the next decade through selection on the Balanced Performance Index (BPI) were used. For an increase of AU$ 100 in BPI (~ 10 years of genetic improvement), we predict that the increase of per cow emissions will be reduced to 37 kg CO₂-eq/cow. year. Since milk-production traits are a large part of the breeding goal, the GHG emitted per unit of milk produced will reduce as a result of improvements in efficiency and dilution of emissions per litre of milk produced at a rate estimated to be 35. 7 g CO₂-eq/kg milk solids per year in the past decade and is predicted to reduce to 29. 5 g CO₂-eq/kg milk solids per year after a conservative 10 -year improvement in BPI (AU$ 100). In fact, cow numbers have decreased over the past decade and production has increased; altogether, we estimate that the net impact has been a reduction of <b>CO₂-eq</b> emissions of ~ 1. 0 % in total emissions from the dairy industry per year. Using two future scenarios of either keeping the number of cows or amount of product static, we predict that net GHG emissions will reduce by ~ 0. 6 %/year of total dairy emissions if milk production remains static, compared with 0. 3 %/year, if cow numbers remain the same and there is genetic improvement in milk-production traits...|$|E

40|$|Continuous-flow {{hydrothermal}} and solvothermal syntheses offer substantial {{advantages over}} conventional processes, producing high quality materials {{from a wide}} range of precursors. In this study, we evaluate the “cradle-to-gate” life cycle environmental impacts of alternative titanium dioxide (TiO₂) nanoparticle production parameters, considering a range of operational conditions, precursors, material properties and production capacities. A detailed characterisation of the nano-TiO₂ products allows us, for the first time, to link key nanoparticle characteristics to production parameters and environmental impacts, providing a useful foundation for future studies evaluating nano-TiO₂ applications. Five different titanium precursors are considered, ranging from simple inorganic precursors, like titanium oxysulphate (TiOS), to complex organic precursors such as titanium bis(ammonium-lactato) dihydroxide (TiBALD). Synthesis at the laboratory scale is used to determine the yield, size distribution, crystallinity and phase of the nanoparticles. The specifications and operating experience of a full scale plant (> 1000 t per year) are used to estimate the mass and energy inputs of industrial scale production for the life cycle assessment. Overall, higher process temperatures are linked to larger, more crystalline nanoparticles and higher conversion rates. Precursor selection also influences nano-TiO₂ properties: production from TiOS results in the largest particle sizes, while TiBALD achieves the smallest particles and narrowest size distribution. Precursor selection is the main factor in determining cradle-to-gate environmental impacts (> 80 % in some cases), due to the production impact of complex organic precursors. Nano-TiO 2 production from TiOS shows the lowest global warming potential (GWP) (< 12 kg <b>CO₂-eq.</b> per kg TiO₂) and cumulative energy demand (CED) (< 149 MJ kg¯¹ TiO₂) due to the low environmental impact of the precursor, the use of water as a solvent and its high yield even at lower temperatures. Conversely, the TiBALD precursor shows the highest impact (86 kg <b>CO₂-eq.</b> per kg TiO₂ and 1952 MJ kg¯¹ TiO₂) due to the need for additional post-synthesis steps and complexity of precursor manufacturing. The main purpose of this study is not a direct comparison of the environmental impacts of TiO₂ nanoparticles manufactured utilizing various precursors under different conditions, but to provide an essential foundation for future work evaluating potential applications of nano-TiO₂ and their life cycle environmental impacts...|$|E

To quantify the relative greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from pasture litter, ground shoots of clover (Trifolium repens L.), ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) and maize (Zea mays L.) were incorporated into soil at 1. 5, 1. 0 and 0. 6 g nitrogen (N) (~ 12. 8 g carbon (C), on average) kg⁻¹ soil, respectively. A 42 d incubation at 20 °C and either 86 % (field capacity) or 54 % water-filled pore space (WFPS) was performed. During the first 2 d, 92 – 95 % of the N₂O was emitted. At 86 % WFPS, N₂O emissions were 2 – 3 % of the incorporated N with no litter species differences. At 54 % WFPS, N₂O emissions were 1. 7 % > 0. 7 % = 0. 5 % of herbage N applied, for clover, ryegrass and maize, respectively (P < 0. 001). At 86 % and 54 % WFPS, carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions averaged 32 % and 21 %, respectively, with no litter species differences after 38 d.

40|$|Currently, World {{is facing}} global warming, which threats {{especially}} winter tourism. Many glaciers started to melt significantly {{as well as}} winter seasons get warmer and shorter in many ski areas (Gilaberte-Búrdaloa, et al., 2014). It is a really important issue and challenge especially for ski resorts. However, in spite of ski resorts there are also millions of tourists visiting ski destinations every year. Due to that {{it should also be}} important to all those winter enthusiasts to know and reduce their own impacts on environment, if they still want to enjoy snow-based sports and natural beauty of a mountain environment. Due to that, this study chosen to focus on emissions from ski trips seeing form the perspective of the skier {{in one of the most}} famous ski region in Sweden. The carbon footprint concept was used to calculate and compare four trips to different ski destinations such as Åre, Vemdalen, Frösön and Storulvån. From each trip the following factors where considered: emissions from production of ski equipment, emissions from skier travel, from purchased electricity in the ski resort and from consumption of fuel by vehicles on the slopes. At least six transportation scenarios per destination were created to investigate possible modes of transportation and their impacts. The results showed that the total amount of carbon footprint per skier differed among the trips from 74. 01 kg to 2. 40 kg of <b>CO₂-eq.</b> per skier depends on the transportation scenario and destination. It was concluded that skier travel can be a huge source of emissions depending on the distance to chosen destination and type of the transport. However, it was found out that impact from skier travel as well as from ski equipment can be reduced by individual’s choices. Moreover, it was also concluded that the fuel consumed by vehicles on the slopes had a significant impact in all ski resorts and it should become the major issue for ski resorts to find new solutions and practices, which would reduce the amount of emissions [...] 2016 - 08 - 30 </p...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the biggest}} issues confronting {{humankind}} today is global warming due to the rapidly increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, namely CO₂, CH₄ and N₂O. The Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) has prepared an emission reduction strategy. So far, inland waters, including lakes and reservoirs, have not {{been included in the}} global carbon cycle. However, the contribution of inland waters to global CO₂ and CH₄ emissions has been identified to be important. Inland waters are also known to be a major sink for GHG emissions by attenuating carbon that would otherwise be transported from the terrestrial landscape to the ocean. Lakes are also very sensitive to climate change as well as to human impacts generally, and these effects will need to be considered in understanding the future role of lakes in the global carbon cycle. This study aimed to improve understanding of CO₂ and CH₄ emissions from lakes, and to quantify these emissions under changing climate and nutrient loading regimes in a regionally discrete group of lakes of volcanic origin in North Island of New Zealand. It included a comprehensive field study of one lake, application of process-based numerical modelling to the lake, and collation and critical analysis of existing datasets for the group of lakes. The primary study site was Okaro, a monomictic eutrophic lake where a major restoration program has been in place for more than one decade. The study also extended to 10 other lakes in order to give insights into effects of different nutrient and mixing regimes on carbon sources and sinks Based on observations over a one-period (September 2013 – October 2014), Lake Okaro accumulated CO₂ and CH₄ in the hypolimnion during summer stratification. These gases were entrained into surface waters as lake started to turnover just prior to complete mixing in winter. As recorded in many other eutrophic lakes, the net CO₂ flux was mostly from the atmosphere to the lake. However, CO₂, together with CH₄, escaped from the lake as a pulsed emission in winter. Using a simple annual mass balance model it was calculated that, ~ 31 % of CH₄ sourced from the sediment escaped to the atmosphere through diffusive flux. The remainder was likely to be oxidized in the water column. The model also showed that on an annual basis the net CO₂ emission is out of the lake. These findings suggest that eutrophic lakes may actually be net emitters of greenhouse gases and that pulsed emissions may be an important contributor to the direction of the flux. This study did not account for CH₄ ebullition, however, and therefore the magnitude of GHG emissions from this lake is likely to be lower than predicted. The effects on CO₂ and CH₄ emissions from Lake Okaro of a warming climate and changes in nutrient loads was simulated using a coupled hydrodynamic-ecological model (GLM-AED 2). Future possible changes were simulated by altering model forcing data, increasing air temperature by 2. 5 °C. Internal and external nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) loads were also either halved or increased by one half. Model simulations showed that annual CO₂ uptake by the lake was enhanced under a warmer climate, but emissions of CH₄ increased during lake overturn as a result of greater diffusive fluxes. Total GHG emissions, as CO₂ equivalent (kg <b>CO₂-eq</b> m⁻² y⁻¹), from the lake were predicted with model simulations to increase by 27 % under a warming climate, relative to present conditions. This increase would be reduced to 19 % if nutrient loading was halved. A first-order diagenesis model was used to estimate the carbon deposition in the 11 Te Arawa lakes. The most productive lakes, using chlorophyll a as a proxy, had higher rates of carbon deposition in the bottom sediments than the less productive lakes. However, burial efficiency (buried carbon: deposited carbon) was lower in productive lakes meaning that most of the deposited carbon in these lakes is remineralized back into the water column. This remineralization process can be associated with CO₂ and CH₄ emissions from the lake. The results of this study highlight that eutrophic lakes may contribute emit higher levels of GHGs to the atmosphere than has previously been estimated, primarily as a result of pulsed emissions associated with the onset of seasonal mixing, at least in monomictic lakes. Eutrophication and climate warming are likely to enhance GHG emissions from lakes. The findings from this study have important implications for global GHG fluxes and indicate that fluxes into or from lakes need to be included in inventories. Reducing nutrient loads to lakes could offset some of the predicted increases in emissions of GHGs that are likely to occur with climate warming...|$|E
