40|$|We {{present a}} new and {{alternative}} proposition for the traditional Asian timber column-and-beam connection, using the Kusabi-Nageshi (K-N) joint system. The mechanical behaviour is complex and relies on the embedment strength of the timber, pre-stress, friction, and elastic energy storage. Using a systematic comparative analysis, {{the advantages of the}} K-N joint over more traditional joints can be made clear. The comparison of the hysteresis from cyclic loaded <b>cross-joint</b> tests with varied pre-stress clarifies the enhanced mechanical behaviour of the K-N joint system. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|AbstractTension and shear {{tests are}} carried out on {{composite}} cross-joints, produced by resin transfer moulding (RTM), stitch-RTM and cobonding techniques separately, to investigate the influences of different production methods on their mechanical properties and their failure mechanism. It is concluded from test results that, in terms of mechanical properties, the RTM-made <b>cross-joint</b> holds superiority over other two, and both stitch-RTM and cobonding methods have significant adverse effects on mechanical properties. Experimental observation and finite element (FE) numerical simulation show that the delamination first {{takes place at the}} upper triangle-like resin-rich zone of joints, then propagates along the interface between the zone and the curved webs/flanges to the bottom plate, and grows along the horizontal bottom plate till failure of the joint accurs at last. Results demonstrate that there is a good agreement between the FE model and the tests...|$|E

Wii Remote（Nintendo, Japan）is the controller of Wii, and some sensors and interfaces are installed. 3 D acceleration sensor enables {{to work as a}} 3 D positional sensor. Our trial is to develop a 3 D medical graphic viewer using a game-input-device, Wii Remote. The 3 D acceleration sensor can recognize 3 D virtual space preciously and permit the intuitive operation. The programming language for a medical graphic viewer development was C#. We used the OpenSource Project, Wiimotelib 1. 7, for C++/C#. 3 D virtual place was created by XNA GameStudio 3. 1 （Microsoft）．Our development included the rotation, parallel displacement/shift/translation, scaling（expansion/reduction）of 3 D objects, and various light-source settings. As results, the 3 D object was rotated using three axes of the 3 D acceleration sensor and enlarged or reduced using Wii Remote’s Up and Down buttons. Also the 3 D object showed the parallel translation using the <b>cross-joint</b> button while a trigger button B pressed. A medical graphic viewer was developed using a game-input-device, Wii Remote. Various operations are demonstrated. Such intuitive operation shows potentials as a medical graphic viewer. [URL]...|$|E

40|$|This article {{proposes a}} {{structural}} dynamics method for foldable stairs based on transfer matrix. The stairs {{are made up}} of a number of identical scissor-like elements which are supposed to be Euler–Bernoulli beams. The dynamics of each segment beam between every two adjacent revolute joints can be precisely expressed by the transfer matrix of the segment with the variables of boundary conditions of the joints. Therefore, the structural dynamics of the whole stairs is built using the least number of variables compared with the traditional methods. In addition, this method avoids the problem of the traditional transfer-matrix method that the number of variables greatly increases when there are a huge number of <b>cross-joints</b> within a structure...|$|R
50|$|As one {{approaches}} the lode the granodiorite becomes mylonitized and is traversed by veinlets covered in pyromorphite. The lode {{itself is not}} wider than 60 centimeters and shows an asymmetric arrangement. The 25 centimeter wide contact zone on the south flank is composed of massive, nonmineralized quartz. Only some joints are covered in pyromorphite and crocoite. To the north follows a 10 centimeter wide band of white, powdery mylonite very rich in pyromorphite and crocoite. Next comes a 5 centimeter wide quartz band in boxwork facies, that is also very rich in the secondary minerals pyromorphite and crocoite. The crocoite appears skeletal and the pyromorphite acicular. The lode terminates on its north side with a 20 centimeter wide quartz band strongly mineralized in galena and sphalerite. <b>Cross-joints</b> show beautiful pyromorphite and crocoite, occasionally also cerussite.|$|R
30|$|Markedly poorer {{values on}} the Weber score were {{observed}} in the TSF group. The parameters for which data were collected at the follow-up examination do not show any clear differences between the three procedures, {{with the exception of}} the Weber UAJ/LAJ score. Surprisingly, the Weber score in the TSF group, with a mean of 9.8 points, was poorer than in the other group. In comparison, the mean scores were 6.7 in the IRF group. One possible reason for the limited mobility in the UAJ might be the <b>cross-joint</b> foot fixture used to prevent talipes and UAJ subluxation during the distraction phase. In contrast to the monolateral fixators, in which technically easy temporary arthrodesis is not possible in the fixator, this was done increasingly often with the Ilizarov ring fixator (n =  13 / 20 patients) and in almost all of the patients treated with lower-leg TSF (n =  27 / 30). Foot fixture is usually used to stabilize the UAJ in patients with fibular aplasia, those with hemimelia with an unstable UAJ, or when talipes is already present. As regular UAJ exercise with physiotherapy is not possible during temporary transfixation, restoration of the original UAJ mobility following the completion of fixator treatment is much slower, as is probably reflected in the below-average score particularly in this treatment group, which is chronologically the youngest. Most of the patients in the TSF group were children with the congenital conditions mentioned earlier. This problem was also taken into consideration at the time, and distraction at the UAJ following assembly was usually set to at least 1  cm in order to protect the cartilage during the transfixation months. This problem needs to be addressed in the future; whenever possible, surgical transfixing of the joints should be avoided through consistent physiotherapy and use of other aids—or if appropriate, early selective disassembly of the foot fixture after the end of distraction should be considered. The UAJ adjusting screws familiar from lengthening procedures using medullary nails might also play a role for fixator patients in the future (Belthur et al. 2008).|$|E
40|$|There are {{remarkable}} {{volumes of}} hydrocarbon resources in low-permeability naturally fractured rock masses (NFRs) characterized by naturally occurring discontinuities. Natural fractures {{are one of}} the most important factors controlling the hydraulic behavior of the rock masses and most low-permeability rocks are very strong, stiff, and fractured. Hydraulic fracturing in low-permeability hard NFRs has recently gained popularity both in the petroleum and mining industries, with different goals. A strong understanding of the behavior of natural fractures provides engineers with better insight into the hydraulic fracturing technology and development strategies. To gain this knowledge, different methodologies and mathematical codes have been introduced to numerically model jointed systems. The first step for every model would be generating geometries that realistically represent the naturally fractured rock mass. Consequently, generating fabrics with different geometric attributes and assessing fabric effects on fluid flow and deformation are points of interest in this research. In addition, stress fields play a prominent role in hydraulic and mechanical responses of natural fractures, and this forms another core direction of the current project. This research presents some attempts to simulate and emulate hydraulic fracturing in hard low-permeability naturally fractured rock masses. In a rock with a hard matrix, only pre-existing fractures may re-activate during the process of pressurization and no new fractures are created. Analysis may lead to a better physical and empirical explanation for how different fabric patterns and deviatoric stress conditions affect the hydro-mechanical behavior of NFRs during injection and after shut-in. A commercial software, Universal Distinct Element Code (UDECTM), is used to generate NFRs in the study. Various geometries have been generated in a two-dimensional framework and subjected to biaxial stresses. Among all generated fabrics, three of the primary contributors to the study include: Voronoi tessellation, <b>Cross-joints</b> and Cross-cuts. Given stipulated differences in in-situ stresses, pore pressure distribution during injection is monitored and shear and normal displacements of joints are investigated. Some important concepts such as size of the stimulated zone and induced shear events were studied in conjunction with this data collection. In order to calibrate numerical emulations with field data, two case studies of waste disposal were modeled. The first attempt was to find the closest geometry and subsequently match the bottom-hole pressure with the fluid pressure at the injection point. Some success in gaining a reasonable and good correspondence indicates that the studies can contribute to greater understanding of such complicated subjects and are of essential importance in qualitative and semi-quantitative evaluations...|$|R
40|$|Sulphide-bearing quartz veins {{occur within}} the Devonian sediments near Allihies, {{in the western}} part of the Beara peninsula, Co. Cork. A local facies change trends east-northeast, {{coincident}} in part with a major fault line. Folding and fracturing are different in the sandstone group to the north and the slate group in the south, since these processes are functions of lithology and the thickness of the beds comprising that lithology. The major fold trends west-south-west, hut smaller folds diverge from this trend, and may he conoidal in geometry. Three phases of jointing are proposed, hut emphasis is placed on the early-formed systematic joints which trend east- south-east. The <b>cross-joints</b> between these are occupied by quartz veins, so that Z-shaped bends occur. The main ore- shoots lie in these deflections. Isofracture maps show that these occur in low density areas within hands of high density fracturing. It is proposed that the major quartz veins were introduced before the folds were tightened up, so that deformation of the veins seen in the field and in thin section was the result of this folding phase. The mineralogy of the veins is discussed in length because of the recognition of molybdenite and mariposite. A number of parageneses is proposed, so that the conventional paragenetic sequence shows overlap in the order of deposition of most of the minerals, which include chalcopyrite, bornite, chalcocite, tetrahedrite, pyrite and specularite. Secondary minerals are also described. Exsolution lamellae of bornite in chalcopyrite and vice versa are seen. Propylitic and sericitic alteration haloes occur around most of the ore-hearing veins. Isopach maps are constructed of the thicknesses of these zones related to the thickness of the veins and lodes. Quantitative studies by X-ray diffractometry involved the preparation of standard calibration graphs for quartz, albite, muscovite, chlorite and dolomite, and results are presented. Similar coloured rocks to those adjacent to the lodes occur on a regional scale. Mineralogical comparisons are drawn between these and unmetamorphosed red beds elsewhere. Trace element analyses show a greater distinction between these beds. The origin of the ore bodies is discussed in the light of the evidence presented. If the quartz and metals come from an unseen deeper source, the source rocks must be acid igneous rocks to account for the molybdenite, unless the ore solutions only use the same channelways as the igneous rocks, and rise from the mantle. If they are derived by lateral secretion from the country rocks, movement of the appropriate solutions must have occurred in late diagenesis or early metamorphism when silica was released by the formation of chlorite from other clay minerals...|$|R
40|$|Natural {{fractures}} play {{an important}} role in the hydrocarbon production from tight reservoirs. The need for fracture network pathways by fraccing matters particularly for shale gas prospects, due to their nano to micro darcies matrix permeabilities. The study of natural fractures from outcrops helps to better understand network connectivity and possibility of reactivating pre-existing planes of weakness, induced by hydraulic stimulation. Microseismicity also show that natural fractures are reactivated during fraccing in tight gas reservoirs and influence the success of the stimulation. An accurate understanding of natural fracture networks can help in predicting the development of fracture networks. In this research we analyze an outcrop analogue, the Whitby Mustone Formation (WMF), in terms of its horizontal fracture network. The WMF is the time equivalent of the Posidonia Shale Formation (PSF), which on itself is the main shale gas prospect in the Dutch subsurface. The fracture network of the WMF is characterized by a system of steep dipping joints with two dominant directions with N-S and E-W strike. The network was digitized from bird-view imagery of the pavement with a spatial extent of ~ 100 m at sub-cm resolution. The imagery is interpreted in terms of orientation and length distributions, intensity and fractal dimensions. Samples from the field were analyzed for rock strength and sample mineralogy. The results indicate that the fracture networks differ per bed. Observed differences are for example; the geometry of the fracture network, its cumulative length distribution, the fracture intensity, the fracture length vs its orientation and the fractal dimension. All these parameters greatly influence fracture network connectivity, the probability that longer fractures exist within the pavement and whether the network is more prone to clustering or scattering. Apart from the differences, the networks display a fairly similar orthogonal arrangement with dominant large (> 5 - 10 m) N-S striking fractures and smaller E-W striking <b>cross-joints</b> (< 2 - 3 m). A nested network arrangement is indicated by some smaller-scale N-S fractures abutting against the E-W striking ones. Furthermore, abutment relations provide some constraints on relative time. Timing indications with respect to burial-exhumation are difficult to establish. Some joints are cemented and measurable from the high-resolution imagery. The vein measurements helped establishing a first order relation between the fracture aperture with respect to their length and confirm that longer fractures have a wider aperture. The above stated parameters and results all prove to be very valuable information which can help predict the geometries of the different fracture networks present within the PSF. It is important to understand the possible mechanisms which can cause these differences in fracture network characteristics. Bulk lithological variations between beds are minor, beds are mainly consisting of clay minerals. Furthermore, some quartz and pyrite is present in all samples and TOC is present in variable amounts. However, the occurrence of concretions up to 0. 5 m in size and differences in layer thickness correlates makes notable variations in distinct network arrangement. Therefore it appears that the presence of these concretions and variations in layer thickness alters the overall strength of the rock, hence the fracture network geometry...|$|R
