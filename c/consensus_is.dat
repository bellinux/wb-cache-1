40|$|Great {{differences}} in end-of-life practices in treating the critically ill {{around the world}} warrant agreement regarding the major ethical principles. This analysis determines the extent of worldwide consensus for end-of-life practices, delineates where there is and <b>is</b> not <b>consensus,</b> and analyzes reasons for lack of consensus. Critical care societies worldwide were invited to participate. Country coordinators were identified and draft statements were developed for major end-of-life issues and translated into six languages. Multidisciplinary responses using a web-based survey assessed agreement or disagreement with definitions and statements linked to anonymous demographic information. <b>Consensus</b> <b>was</b> prospectively defined as > 80 % agreement. Definitions and statements not obtaining <b>consensus</b> <b>were</b> revised based on comments of respondents, and then translated and redistributed. Of the initial 1, 283 responses from 32 countries, <b>consensus</b> <b>was</b> found for 66 (81 %) of the 81 definitions and statements; 26 (32 %) had > 90 % agreement. With 83 additional responses to the original questionnaire (1, 366 total) and 604 responses to the revised statements, <b>consensus</b> could <b>be</b> obtained for another 11 of the 15 statements. <b>Consensus</b> <b>was</b> obtained for informed consent, withholding and withdrawing life-sustaining treatment, legal requirements, intensive care unit therapies, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, shared decision making, medical and nursing consensus, brain death, and palliative care. <b>Consensus</b> <b>was</b> obtained for 77 of 81 (95 %) statements. Worldwide <b>consensus</b> could <b>be</b> developed {{for the majority of}} definitions and statements about end-of-life practices. Statements achieving consensus provide standards of practice for end-of-life care; statements without consensus identify important areas for future research...|$|R

5|$|Jesus was a Galilean Jew, born {{around the}} {{beginning}} of the 1st century, who died in 30 or 33 AD in Judea.

5|$|The {{historical}} <b>consensus</b> <b>is</b> {{that responsibility}} or guilt {{for the war}} was not attached to the article. Rather, the clause was a prerequisite to allow a legal basis to be laid out for the reparation payments that were to be made. Historians have also highlighted the unintended damage created by the clause, which caused anger and resentment amongst the German population.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanisms}} of CCD are still unknown, but many causes {{are currently being}} considered, such as pesticides, mites, fungi, beekeeping practices (such {{as the use of}} antibiotics or long-distance transportation of beehives), malnutrition, poor quality queens, starvation, other pathogens, and immunodeficiencies. The current scientific <b>consensus</b> <b>is</b> that no single factor is causing CCD, but that some of these factors in combination may lead to CCD either additively or synergistically.|$|E

5|$|As {{they share}} many {{cross-platform}} games and {{compete for the}} same audience as their predecessors, frequent comparisons are made between the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. The PS3 uses the Blu-ray format, while the Xbox 360 uses a standard DVD9. The Xbox 360 is less expensive to produce, and analysts expect that a mid-revision will allow Microsoft to break-even on manufacturing costs, while industry <b>consensus</b> <b>is</b> that the Xbox 360's conventional architecture is easier to develop for.|$|E
5|$|Based on the {{findings}} of these and other studies in the early 1970s, the current <b>consensus</b> <b>is</b> that the use of methoxyflurane should be restricted only to healthy individuals, in situations where it offers specific advantages and even then, only at dosages less than 2.5MAC hours. Partly because of these warnings, but also because of the development of newer volatile anesthetics such as enflurane, isoflurane, desflurane and sevoflurane, the clinical use of methoxyflurane as a general anesthetic in humans was largely abandoned in the mid-1970s.|$|E

5000|$|After the {{election}} the embarrassment for the VIP continued {{when the two}} elected candidates (Julian Fraser and Andrew Fahie) were unable to agree which of them should be appointed Leader of the Opposition (each candidate preferring themselves). [...] Governor John Duncan indicated that if no <b>consensus</b> <b>was</b> reached by 20 July 2015 then he would take appropriate advice and choose himself from the available candidates. No <b>consensus</b> <b>was</b> reached, and so the Governor appointed Fraser as opposition leader.|$|R
5|$|Between 1983 and 1989 the {{paintings}} underwent technical examination and were extensively restored and cleaned. Technical {{analysis of the}} Philadelphia painting established that the wood panel comes from the same tree as that of two paintings definitively attributed to van Eyck, and that the Italian panel has underdrawings of a quality that it is thought could only have come from him. After nearly 500 years, {{the paintings}} were reunited in 1998 in an exhibition at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Today the <b>consensus</b> <b>is</b> that both were painted by the same hand.|$|E
5|$|Less clearcut is the {{question}} of whether the regular auxilia recruited barbari (barbarians, as the Romans called people living outside the empire's borders). Although there is little evidence of it before the 3rd century, the <b>consensus</b> <b>is</b> that auxilia recruited barbarians throughout their history. In the 3rd century, a few auxilia units of clearly barbarian origin start to appear in the record e.g. Ala I Sarmatarum, cuneus Frisiorum and numerus Hnaufridi in Britain.|$|E
5|$|Modern historians {{generally}} dismiss {{these numbers}} as exaggerations. One approach {{to estimate the}} number of troops is to calculate the number of marines carried by 600 triremes. Herodotus tells us that each trireme in the second invasion of Greece carried 30 extra marines, in addition to a probable 14 standard marines. Thus, 600 triremes could easily have carried 18,000–26,000 infantry. Numbers proposed for the Persian infantry are in the range 18,000–100,000. However, the <b>consensus</b> <b>is</b> around 25,000.|$|E
40|$|Patients {{treated with}} low {{radiotherapy}} dose or treated at young age {{are at a}} risk of developing local relapse. Although data are preliminary, brachytherapy seems an attractive treatment option for recurrent prostate cancer after previous radiotherapy. Therefore, the UroGEC group of the GEC-ESTRO conducted a Delphi study, to explore expert opinion on the management of salvage prostate brachytherapy. For this study, a series of digital questionnaires were sent, which enabled data collection from an international group of experienced participants. <b>Consensus</b> <b>was</b> defined as 80 % agreement for each question. Eighteen experts completed all rounds of the Delphi study. After the final round <b>consensus</b> <b>was</b> reached on 17 out of 38 (45 %) questions. <b>Consensus</b> <b>was</b> reached in 52 % of questions about patient selection, in 50 % of the questions about diagnostic tests and in 22 % of the questions on performing salvage prostate brachytherapy. The group {{was able to find}} consensus on {{less than half of the}} questions. Most <b>consensus</b> <b>was</b> reached on topics involving patient selection and diagnostic tests, where participants could build on their experience of daily practice. However, the way to perform the salvage treatment is less established and results in more disagreement between participant...|$|R
40|$|Background and Purpose—Lower {{respiratory}} tract infections frequently complicate stroke and adversely affect outcome. There is currently no agreed terminology or gold-standard diagnostic {{criteria for the}} spectrum of lower {{respiratory tract}} infections complicating stroke, which has implications for clinical practice and research. The aim of this <b>consensus</b> <b>was</b> to propose standardized terminology and operational diagnostic criteria for lower respiratory tract infections complicating acute stroke. Methods—Systematic literature searches of multiple electronic databases were undertaken.

5|$|The abortion–breast cancer {{hypothesis}} {{has been}} the subject of extensive scientific inquiry, and the scientific community has concluded that abortion does not cause breast cancer and that breast cancer should not be a concern for women who are considering having an abortion. This <b>consensus</b> <b>is</b> supported by major medical bodies, including the World Health Organization, the U.S. National Cancer Institute, the American Cancer Society, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, the German Cancer Research Center, and the Canadian Cancer Society.|$|E
5|$|The more {{commonly}} spoken languages dominate the less commonly spoken languages, so the less commonly spoken languages eventually disappear from populations. The {{total number of}} languages {{in the world is}} not known. Estimates vary depending on many factors. The <b>consensus</b> <b>is</b> that there are between 6,000 and 7,000 languages spoken as of 2010, and that between 50–90% of those will have become extinct by the year 2100. The top 20 languages, those spoken by more than 50 million speakers each, are spoken by 50% of the world's population, whereas many of the other languages are spoken by small communities, most of them with less than 10,000 speakers.|$|E
5|$|The most {{successful}} Soviet spy was Klaus Fuchs, {{a member of}} the British Mission who played an important part at Los Alamos. The 1950 revelation of his espionage activities damaged the United States' nuclear cooperation with Britain and Canada. Subsequently, other instances of espionage were uncovered, leading to the arrest of Harry Gold, David Greenglass, and Ethel and Julius Rosenberg. Other spies like George Koval and Theodore Hall remained unknown for decades. The value of the espionage is difficult to quantify, as the principal constraint on the Soviet atomic bomb project was a shortage of uranium ore. The <b>consensus</b> <b>is</b> that espionage saved the Soviets one or two years of effort.|$|E
30|$|Secondly, <b>consensus</b> <b>was</b> {{developed}} {{among the}} panel of experts, by use of the modified Delphi technique, which is a formal method used for group <b>consensus.</b> This process <b>was</b> organised by a specialised team with extensive experience of the technique. The process started with an open questionnaire to be filled out by each expert. The aggregate ratings were then shared with the entire group at a face-to-face meeting. After discussion, the panellists re-rated each item. In subsequent rounds, {{the participants were asked}} to rate the relative importance of specific items. After subsequent rounds, <b>consensus</b> <b>was</b> finally developed.|$|R

The merger of IPEU and the lithographers' union was the first official recognition that this <b>consensus</b> <b>was</b> changing in the face of industry pressure, globalization and technological advances.|$|R
5|$|The red-winged fairywren {{was officially}} {{described}} by ornithologist John Gould in 1837, who derived the bird's specific name {{derived from the}} Latin term elegans 'elegant'. He gave its location as the East Coast, but realised his error after further collections by John Gilbert from Southwestern Australia. Amateur ornithologist Gregory Mathews described birds from the southern karri forests as subspecies warreni in 1916 {{on the basis of}} darker female plumage. However, others have not observed this subsequently and the <b>consensus</b> <b>is</b> that no separate subspecies are recognized. In fact there is little variation in size or colour within the species between populations or individuals.|$|E
5|$|The {{scientific}} <b>consensus</b> <b>is</b> {{that the}} asteroid impact at the K–Pg boundary left megatsunami deposits and sediments {{around the area}} of the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico, from the colossal waves created by the impact. These deposits have been identified in the La Popa basin in northeastern Mexico, platform carbonates in northeastern Brazil, in Atlantic deep-sea sediments, and {{in the form of the}} thickest-known layer of graded sand deposits, around 100m thick, in the Chicxulub crater itself, directly above the shocked granite ejecta.|$|E
5|$|The {{series was}} a {{commercial}} failure in Japan {{but has been}} successful in the United States. Critical <b>consensus</b> <b>is</b> that Zombiepowder. was a technically proficient manga, but one which lacked the originality necessary to bear intrinsic appeal to most readers, which accounted for its cancellation. Additionally, the series was heavily focused on battles even by the standards of action manga, though whether this was a positive or negative trait is a matter of contention. Due to these factors, combined with its abrupt and unsatisfactory ending, critics hold that Zombiepowder. is significant primarily as a chapter in the career of its author, and would otherwise be a footnote which found an audience only among fans of violent action.|$|E
