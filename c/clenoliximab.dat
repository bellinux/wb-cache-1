40|$|Keliximab and <b>clenoliximab</b> are monkey/human {{chimeric}} CD 4 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) of the IgG 1 and IgG 4 isotypes, respectively. The pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynam-ics (PD) {{of these}} mAbs were evaluated in transgenic mice bearing human CD 4 molecules on their T cells after a single i. v. administration at three dose levels (5 – 125 mg/kg). The PK of keliximab and <b>clenoliximab</b> were similar, dose-dependent, and adequately {{described by a}} two-compartment model with sat-urable elimination from both compartments. The enumeration of circulating CD 41 T cells and density of CD 4 on their surface were determined as the PD effects. An indirect response model was proposed to characterize the PD effects. With the increase in mAb dose, the maximum intensity (Rmax) of PD effects was increased, and the time to reach Rmax shifted to later times. A...|$|E
40|$|<b>Clenoliximab</b> and {{keliximab}} are monkey/human chimeric monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) of the immunoglobulin G 4 (IgG 4) and IgG 1 isotypes, respectively, that {{recognize the}} same epitope on human CD 4. The two mAbs possess identical idiotypes and exhibit equal affinities for CD 4. Upon administration of these mAbs to mice that express a human CD 4 transgene, but not mouse CD 4 (HuCD 4 /Tg mice), <b>clenoliximab</b> and keliximab exhibited similar kinetics of binding to CD 4, and induced {{the same degree}} of CD 4 modulation from the cell surface, although only keliximab mediated CD 4 + T-cell depletion. Epicutaneous sensitization and challenge of HuCD 4 /Tg mice with the hapten oxazolone resulted in a contact sensitivity response characterized by tissue swelling, and the presence of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and interleukin- 4 (IL- 4) in the local tissue. Administration of a single 2 -mg dose of either <b>clenoliximab</b> or keliximab to HuCD 4 /Tg mice prior to sensitization significantly reduced post-challenge tissue swelling, and levels of IFN-γ and IL- 4, indicating that CD 4 + T-cell depletion is not required for anti-CD 4 mAb-mediated inhibition of contact sensitivity. Administration of either mAb prior to challenge failed to inhibit the contact sensitivity response, indicating differential sensitivity of the afferent and efferent phases of the response to inhibition by CD 4 -specific mAbs. Collectively, these data indicate that CD 4 functions as a positive regulatory molecule in the contact sensitivity response...|$|E
