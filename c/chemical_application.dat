A vast hill-side lay basking in the sun, which illuminated on its rounded swells a hundred long stripes of grain in every stage of verdure, resembling so much delicate velvet that was thrown {{in a variety of}} accidental faces to the light, while the shadows ran away, to speak technically, from this foyer de lumière of the picture, in gradations of dusky russet and brown, until the colonne de vigueur was obtained in the deep black cast from the overhanging branches of a wood of larch in the depths of some ravine, into which the sight with difficulty penetrated. These were the beauties on which Adelheid most loved to dwell, for they are always the charms that soonest strike the true admirer of nature, when he finds himself raised above the lower and less purified strata of the atmosphere, into the regions of more radiant light and brightness. It is thus that the physical, no less than the moral, vision becomes elevated above the impurities that cling to this nether world, attaining a portion of that spotless and sublime perception as we ascend, by which we are nearly assimilated to the truths of creation; a poetical type of the greater and purer enjoyment we feel, as morally receding from earth we draw nearer to heaven.|$|E

50|$|The generic {{advantages}} of guidance include much reduced overlap between passes of machines, particularly of wide cultivators which may overlap by around 10%. Although planters and drills use physical markers {{to match up}} between one pass and the next, cumulative errors can be large and non-cropped tracks created by these machines (tramlines) for <b>chemical</b> <b>applications</b> can often have an overlap of 5%. The implications of this are significant because tramlines are used for all <b>chemical</b> <b>applications.</b> A 5% overlap wastes the equivalent in increasingly expensive materials and through overdosing, damages crops and could lead to extra run-off and diffuse pollution.|$|R

5000|$|Planting only {{resistant}} varieties of juniper {{is the most}} efficient method of preventing Phomopsis blight. [...] For information on resistant cultivars contact a local extension office. If blight is already established in a population, then the most effective management strategies include sanitation and <b>chemical</b> <b>application</b> to prevent further infection. The infectious spores are transported to new host tissue via wind, water, insects, human handling, and equipment. [...] Therefore, careful preventative measures, sanitation methods, and management strategies are required to restrict the movement of disease from host to host.|$|E
50|$|Chemical control can be {{effective}} if {{used in conjunction with}} other control methods. Glyphosate (Roundup) applied at 0.375 lbs/acre in the early spring before seeds are produced can provide good results. This timing will also limit the damage to nontarget species that develop later in the growing season. Research suggests that burning before <b>chemical</b> <b>application</b> is more effective than chemicals alone. In the late 1960s, a study was conducted that determined the effectiveness of paraquat on medusahead control in different areas of the United States. This study found that paraquat was effective in controlling medusahead in California, but did not suppress the grass in Reno, Nevada. This was significant because it determined that there was no effective herbicide for the simultaneous spraying and reseeding of medusahead infestations.|$|E

50|$|Ascochyta sorghi is {{controlled}} through host plant resistance, cultural practices, and <b>chemical</b> <b>application</b> when necessary. Varieties of sorghum are not generally susceptible to rough leaf spot, although exceptions do exist. Cultural practices include crop rotation, deep plowing, and avoiding field operations when leaf surfaces are wet. As Ascochyta sorghi survives in plant debris and pycnidia in the soil, crop rotation and deep plowing {{allow for the}} avoidance of potential inoculum sources. Other sanitation, such as using clean seed and removing alternate hosts, such as wild sorghum species, can reduce disease incidence. Spores are spread from water splash, and can also be transmitted through contact with field equipment, especially when leaves are wet, so delaying field operations until plants are dry can help prevent spread of the pathogen. If necessary, the application of fungicides can help limit disease severity.|$|E
50|$|A Field History Form {{should be}} {{completed}} before the planting season begins; farmers may not be available for a more thorough history prior to the season's start. This history {{is important because it}} acts as a reference when accurately diagnosing symptoms caused by pests, nutrient deficiencies and toxicities, <b>chemical</b> <b>application,</b> and unfavorable environmental conditions. This form should contain the following information: field location, farmer’s preferred field name or number, cropping history, including specific variety and seed manufacturer, planting date, planting rate (spacing), row width, tillage operations, crop yields, pesticide names, rates, application dates and who applied them, fertilizer and lime applications and rates, weather patterns, soil type, soil test records (N, P, K, percent organic matter, and pH), irrigation availability, major pest problems, and anything else that could make scouting more effective. This history is very important when assessing signs of crop injuries, because they are generally ambiguous since similar abnormalities can have unrelated causes.|$|E

As a consequence of their interlocked structure, catenanes and rotaxanes may present such a 3 D scaffold, and can be chiral by inclusion of a classical chiral element and/or {{as a consequence of the}} mechanical bond. This mini-review presents illustrative examples of chiral [2]catenanes and [2]rotaxanes, before discussing where these molecules have been used in <b>chemical</b> <b>applications</b> such as chiral host-guest recognition and asymmetric catalysis...|$|R
50|$|Organic food {{systems are}} {{characterized}} by a reduced dependence on chemical inputs and an increased concern for transparency and information. Organic produce is grown without the chemical pesticides and fertilizers of industrial food systems, and livestock is reared {{without the use of}} antibiotics or growth hormones. The reduced inputs of organic agriculture can also lead to a greater reliance on local knowledge, creating a stronger knowledge community amongst farmers. The transparency of food information is vital for organic food systems as a means through which consumers are able to identify organic food. As a result, a variety of certification bodies have emerged in organic food systems that set the standards for organic identification. Organic agriculture is promoted for the ecological benefits of reduced <b>chemical</b> <b>application,</b> the health benefits of lower chemical consumption, the economic benefits that accrue to farmers through a price premium, and the social benefits of increased transparency in the food system.|$|E
5000|$|A {{chemical}} may {{be directly}} {{applied to the}} skin followed by blood and urine measurements at set time points after application to assess the amount of chemical that entered the body. The concentration in the blood or urine at particular time points can be graphed to show and area under the curve and the extent and duration of absorption and distribution to provide a measure of systemic absorption. This {{can be done in}} animals or humans with a dry chemical powder or a chemical in solution. Rats are commonly used for these experiments. An area of skin is shaved before the chemical is applied. Often the area of <b>chemical</b> <b>application</b> is covered to prevents ingestion or rubbing off of the test material. Samples of blood and urine are taken at specific time intervals following application (0.5, 1, 2, 4, 10, and 24 hours) and in some protocols at the chosen end time the animal maybe necropsied and tissue samples may also be evaluated for the presence of the test chemical. [...] In some test protocols many animals may be tested and necropsies may occur at set intervals after exposure. Biomonitoring, such as taking urine samples at intervals, from workers exposed to chemicals may provide some information {{but it is difficult to}} distinguish dermal from inhalation exposure using this method.|$|E
50|$|Camp Grafton (South Unit) (CGS) {{consists}} of 10000 acre of a transitional grassland ecosystem. Transitional grasslands contain both tall grass prairies {{of the east}} and mixed grass prairies of the west. CGS {{is one of the}} largest contiguous areas of transitional grasslands North Dakota. Grazing has been the predominant use of the training area since 1920. Cattle grazing mimics the prehistoric grazing by herbivores (elk and bison). The rolling hills of transitional grasslands are a tremendous training area for open-area combat arms maneuvers necessary for our mechanized engineer and air defense artillery units. To maintain the transitional grassland ecosystem, grazing licenses are auctioned to local ranchers; providing income, which is, reinvested back into the training site. The transitional grassland ecosystem is seriously threatened by leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula), an introduced weed. The primary control in the past has been concentrated use of 2,4-D and picloram herbicides. In the past five years, the North Dakota Army National Guard, in partnership with the Range Science Department of North Dakota State University has implemented an integrated pest management plan to control leafy spurge using cultural and chemical controls. The cultural controls consist of grazing spurge tolerant sheep on heavily infested sites, and treating small concentrations through <b>chemical</b> <b>application.</b> The NDARNG is expected to reduce herbicide costs by 79% over the next six years, with a realization of increased grass production of 50%. The USDA in other trials throughout the United States is implementing this integrated plan of combined cultural and chemical treatment.|$|E
40|$|Room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) {{are useful}} in many <b>chemical</b> <b>applications.</b> Recent {{publications}} have attempted to determine the polarity of RTILs using empirical solvent polarity scales.

50|$|Sharma pioneered {{researches}} in cytogenetics and cytochemistry in India and {{is credited}} with developing new research techniques {{for the study of}} chromosome structure of plants. He propounded the concept of speciation in asexual organisms and the some of techniques he developed for the study of chromosomes with respect to their physical and chemical nature, such as repetitive DNA orcein banding, multiple DNA analysis and analysis of chemical nature of chromosomes, are being practiced globally. He introduced a new protocol for inducing division in adult nuclei through <b>chemical</b> <b>application</b> which assisted in cell rejuvenation. He redefined angiosperm taxonomy, proposed new concepts of the dynamic DNA and dynamic structure and behaviour of chromosomes and suggested the use of embryo irradiation and in-vitro cultures for the generation of variability, and tissue culture as a tool for conservation of endangered species and for maintaining genetic variability. His studies proved that organogenesis, differentiation and reproduction return variable chemical composition of chromosomes while maintaining the genetic skeleton. His researches have been documented by way of several books and over 500 articles; Chromosome Painting: Principles, Strategies and Scope, Chromosome Techniques: Theory and Practice, Chromosome Techniques — A Manual, Botanical Survey of India, Advances in Cell and Chromosome Research, Plant Genome: Biodiversity and Evolution (2 volumes), and Cytology of Different Species of Palms and Its Bearing on the Solution of the Problems of Phylogeny and Speciation are some of his notable works. He has also contributed chapters to reference manuals and texts such as the Botanical Review of Springer, International Review of Cytology of Elsevier, Encyclopaedia of Microscopy and Micro-technique of Van Nostrand and The Cell Nucleus and Tropical Botany of Academic Press and some of his books are prescribed texts for academic study.|$|E
