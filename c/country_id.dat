40|$|While {{studies on}} {{conflict}} still occupy {{most of the}} interest of the Colombian academia, the researchers’ discourse on post-conflict is becoming more notorious. Academically speaking, a consensus on whether Colombia is or is not in a post-conflict stage has not been reached. On the contrary, the position of the current Government is very clear on the matter and recognized, in 2011, the existence of an armed conflict in the country which represents a huge contrast with the government of Álvaro Uribe who during eight years exhorted several times the denial of the conflict in Colombia. On the other side, 88 % of the Colombian population still thinks that the country {{is in a state of}} conflict (CNC, slide 11) while only 11 % thinks it is instead post-conflict. Even more interesting is the discovery that the higher the income level is the higher the percentage of people who think that there is still an armed conflict in the <b>country</b> (<b>id.)</b> Furthermore, the work of some scholars on post-conflict (Rettberg; Guerra & Plata) suggests the need to promote a cultural transformation in order to provide for a better transition. Inspired by this idea both from an academic as much as from a personal perspective, this research attempts to shed light into to what extent has conflict impacted a small group of middle to high income Colombian adults between 27 and 34 years old. Taking into account that the country is currently undergoing a transitional justice (TJ) process this exploratory research is meant to open the floor to rethink post-conflict and the possibilities of reconciliation. Although TJ processes are often said to shape an umbrella covering not only the people who were directly involved in the conflict, but also all the civil society as an indirect beneficiary of this process, in cases where TJ is not the result of a political transition towards a democracy, this research argues that the general population is often left out as an spectator of the process or is given little attention, despite the fact that most of the success of a transitional justice process in terms of reconciliation depends on the general society (“Entrevista Alejandro Éder”). When revising the bibliography on transitional justice and particularly the material related to truth-seeking and historic memory, it is evident that little attention is given to the impact of conflict in the segment of the population that is not normally considered a victim. Also within the academic sphere there is little research regarding the impact of conflict in different segments of society other than the direct victims. However, long lasting conflicts bring about cultural changes in society which are translated in the adoption of attitudes, values and behaviours developed to survive. This is what some anthropologists have called culture of war or conflict. Aside from the discussion on whether conflict is embedded in culture or not (Sluka 24), it is true that cultural changes caused by spread long standing violence might shape the society in a way that would make it difficult for it to overcome conflict if sociocultural aspects are not tackled. In this sense if civil population is not addressed adequately, reconciliation can become difficult and the cycle of violence might continue. As suggested by Sluka “understanding the cultural context is essential to understanding any specific instance or example of social conflict” (25). Understanding conflict as the product of specific types of social relations (id. 24) and thus turning to the lower levels of social structure provides a bottom-up perspective towards the subject. This perspective allows to understand and identify in which places of social life conflict is located and reproduced. As noted by Nordstrom & Martin “violence is not a socioculturally fragmented phenomenon that occurs ‘outside’ the arena of everyday life for those affected. (…) if we are to understand peace and conflict it is to the people themselves, to the social dynamics and cultural phenomena that inform them, that we must turn” (13 - 14). Acknowledging the voice of those who are not involved or affected by conflict will open the door for learning about different perspectives that the population might have about it. This is particularly important in contexts where there is not sufficient information on one or more actors. The lack of this sort of information might create a gap in history, politics and the understanding of conflict and the role of its actors. It might also prevent from thinking about post-conflict from a different perspective. 	Furthermore, as mentioned by Margold “[t]error and fear, made cultural, saturate a social group’s vision and distort its capacities to act” (64). Although this might be a psychological repercussion resulting from conflict, it can also be a symptom of the penetration of conflict within the culture. It might apply to any level of the social structure of a society that has experienced conflict for several years disregarding the level of exposure to war. Notwithstanding, Guerra & Plata mention the need that the Colombian society has to carry out actions focused on promoting cultural changes towards a culture of peace (89). Within this frame, there is still another voice that should be listened to in Colombia: that of the population that does not fit under the definition of victim given under Law 1448 of 2011 (also known as Law of Victims). The consequences of three decades of conflict in Colombia are not just political or economic. They are also social and cultural and as outlined above conflict transforms the lives and culture within a society, undermines trust and breaks the social tissue. Evidence of this can be found in the narratives of direct victims of conflict in Sierra Leone, Liberia, Peru and Colombia (Beah; Rubio; Londoño et al; Theidon) to name only a few. When conflict is chronic, its effects expand to segments of society which commonly are not seen as direct victims of it. In fact, the title of this thesis evidences how close is the target of this research to the victims of the conflict and calls for stronger attention on the topic. In an attempt to bring to public light the impact of long lasting conflicts in the general population, and the importance of addressing another segment of the population, this exploratory research will address the issue through the examination of the Colombian case, which has recently experienced a process of Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration (DDR) of the Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia (AUC) and has developed an advanced legal framework focusing on the victims. This gap has been approached by Madariaga (2006) who in a research carried out in Urabá (northwest of Bogotá) explored the influence of the paramilitary on daily life practices, the response to paramilitary law by the local population, the impact of the paramilitary presence in emotions and the significant ethical changes in the population after a decade of paramilitary presence. This ethnography was carried out with women that despite living in an area considered as one of the most difficult of the country did not identify with the category of 'victim'. Among her conclusions, Madariaga writes: Language, affective relations, and moral judgements are probably the spheres where the impact of the conditions of violence and the type of authority ruling the context are more visible (93) To stimulate the thinking on this regard, this research proposes a similar perspective. It is instead focused in a completely opposite target to the one covered by Madariaga. ...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is concerned}} with selected issues and tendencies in the organisation of central banks {{and is based on}} a new dataset which was compiled {{from a variety of sources}} such as central bank annual reports. The dissertation seeks to close gaps in the current literature by assessing some issues of interest empirically, which are discussed in four chapters. Chapter 2 introduces the dataset and gives an overview of different areas in the organisation of central banks where important changes have occurred in recent years. These changes include among others the increased use of explicit inflation targets, the spread of currency unions, and a more active and expansive management of international reserves. The chapter shows that central banks are indeed subject to constant change in many fields. Chapter 3 explores how hierarchies and relations within central banks have evolved over time and seeks to identify possible drivers of change. To this end, more than 1, 200 historical organisational charts were analysed. A main finding is that central banks around the world have actively modified their organisational structures during the period 2004 - 2015. On average, they have increased the number of organisational elements, have become slightly less centralised, and employ fewer people. I show this by constructing different measures of organisational structures. Relating these measures to selected country-specific variables cannot confirm anecdotal evidence pointing to inter alia technological progress and budgetary pressure as important drivers of change. Chapter 4 {{is concerned with}} determinants of the currency composition of international reserves held by central banks. This chapter is based on panel data for the period 1996 - 2015 and 37 central banks. In particular, we identify currency pegs and trade patterns as primary driving forces. Further, we examine a possible break in euro-denominated asset holdings caused by the euro crisis. The euro crisis appears to have been a throwback for the euro (EUR), which temporarily seemed to challenge the US dollar (USD), but had an only partial impact on determinants of international reserve compositions. In a final exercise, we estimate currency compositions of international reserves of the three major non-disclosing <b>countries,</b> <b>id</b> est China, Japan, and Saudi Arabia. Chapter 5 discusses how financial market supervision is organised around the world. It examines over time how supervisory responsibilities for the three main financial protagonists, banks, securities markets, and insurance companies, are distributed. Analysing supervisory structures of 170 states for the period 1999 - 2015, I show a trend towards more integrated approaches of supervision. Formal statistical analyses further suggest that political factors influence the degree of supervisory consolidation and that supervisory designs are correlated with the general organisation of public activities in a country: Federalism, especially, is associated with lesser integration of supervisory responsibilities, while government effectiveness and democracy is associated with more integration of supervisory responsibilities...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{correction}} of serum ferritin (SF) concentrations for inflammation because of infectious or parasitic diseases was recently proposed, especially in developing countries, {{but in many}} countries, adiposity has become {{the main cause of}} inflammation Objective: We assessed, overall and by adiposity status, the bias in the estimation of iron deficiency (ID) on the basis of uncorrected SF. Design: A cross-sectional survey in 2010 in Rabat-Sale, Morocco, used a random sample of 811 women aged 20 - 49 y. Adiposity was assessed by body mass index (BMI) (in kg/m(2)) (normal: BMI = 25 to = 30), waist circumference, and body fat. Inflammation was indicated by a C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration > 2 mg/L. ID was indicated by an SF concentration 2 mg/L. The correction factor of SF was 0. 65. The prevalence of ID (37. 2 % compared with 45. 2 %; difference - 8. 0 %, P < 0. 0001) was underestimated by not correcting SF, and the difference increased with adiposity (- 2. 9 %, - 8. 5 %, and - 12. 4 % in normal, overweight, and obese subjects, respectively; P-interaction < 0. 0001). Analogous results were observed for other adiposity measures. Conclusion: In developing <b>countries</b> where <b>ID</b> remains prevalent but rates of obesity are already high, corrected SF should be used when assessing ID status, even if infectious or parasitic diseases are no longer widespread.

However, the effectiveness of ID vaccination needs to be assessed in different ethnic groups. Methods: From September 2006 to March 2008, 185 healthy anti-HBc-negative medical and nursing students at Zahedan University of Medical Sciences who had no history of vaccination against HBV, smoking or hepatitis were evaluated. They were randomly categorized into two groups. In group I (n= 91), low-dose (4 |mg) recombinant hepatitis B vaccine (Euvax B, Korea) was given by intradermal route. In group II (n= 94), the standard dose (20 mg) of the vaccine was administered intramuscularly at 0, 1, and 6 months. The groups were followed {{for a minimum of}} 7 months after the first vaccine dose and tested for anti-HBs titers by ELISA (Diasorin Bio Medica Kit, Saluugia, Italy). Results: Seroprotective anti-HBs titers (titer > 10 mIU/mL) were achieved in 79 (87 %) students in group I and in 90 (96 %) in group II (P= 0. 031). The difference was much pronounced when the two groups were compared for achieving an anti-HBs titer > 300 mIU/mL (P< 0. 0001). Conclusions: Although ID administration of 4 -mg recombinant hepatitis B vaccine is effective, this route is less effective with lower immune response than the IM vaccination...|$|R

40|$|Over 2 {{billion people}} in both {{developing}} {{as well as}} developed countries - over 30 % of the world's population - are anaemic. With the classical preconception that oral iron administration or the intake of foods rich in iron increase haemoglobin concentration and reduce the prevalence of anaemia, specific programs have been designed, but iron supplementations have been less effective than expected. Of note, this hazardous simplification on iron status neglects its distribution in the body. The correct balance of iron, defined iron homeostasis, involves a physiological ratio of iron between tissues/secretions and blood, thus avoiding its delocalization as iron accumulation in tissues/secretions and iron deficiency in blood. Changes in iron status can affect the inflammatory response in multiple ways, particularly {{in the context of}} infection, an idea that is worth remembering when considering the value of iron supplementation in areas of the world where infections are highly prevalent. The enhanced availability of free iron can increase susceptibility and severity of microbial and parasitic infections. The discovery of the hepcidin-ferroportin (Fpn) complex, which greatly clarified the enigmatic mechanism that supervises the iron homeostasis, should prompt to a critical review on iron supplementation, ineffective on the expression of the most important proteins of iron metabolism. Therefore, it is imperative to consider new safe and efficient therapeutic interventions to cure iron deficiency (ID) and ID anaemia (IDA) associated or not to the inflammation. In this respect, lactoferrin (Lf) is emerging as an important regulator of both iron and inflammatory homeostasis. Oral administration of Lf in subjects suffering of ID and IDA is safe and effective in significantly increasing haematological parameters and contemporary decreasing serum IL- 6 levels, thus restoring iron localization through the direct or indirect modulation of hepcidin and ferroportin synthesis. Of note, the nuclear localization of Lf suggests that this molecule may be involved in the transcriptional regulation of some genes of host inflammatory response. We recently also reported that combined administration of oral and intravaginal Lf on ID and IDA pregnant women with preterm delivery threat, significantly increased haematological parameters, reduced IL- 6 levels in both serum and cervicovaginal fluid, cervicovaginal prostaglandin PGF 2 alpha, and suppressed uterine contractility. Moreover, Lf combined administration blocked further the shortening of cervical length and the increase of foetal fibronectin, thus prolonging the length of pregnancy until the 37 th- 38 th week of gestation. These new Lf functions effective in curing ID and IDA through the restoring of iron and inflammatory homeostasis and in preventing preterm delivery, could have a great relevance in developing <b>countries,</b> where <b>ID</b> and IDA and inflammation-associated anaemia represent the major risk factors of preterm delivery and maternal and neonatal death...|$|R

Accordingly, since 2008, the government of Indonesia has initiated regulatory reforms to manage the Country code Top Level Domain Indonesia (ccTLD. id) There are two main concerns questioned in this research: First, what is the model of governance for ccTLD. id? Second, {{what are the implications of}} the governance model to improve the market of ccTLD. id? This research will use comparative method by analyzing secondary data to compare the similarities and differences between four national ccTLD regime models based on multi stakeholder system represented by four ccTLDs, which are. ch (Switzerland),. au (Australia),. mx (Mexico),. ca (Canada). The Analysis of four national ccTLD regime models focuses on model of governance and market orientation of each ccTLD. This capstone is intended to suggest the governance model to support globalized market of ccTLD. ID. Because of the low level of the Internet penetration and inequality of ICT infrastructures among regions in Indonesia, ccTLD. id market should not be limited at national market, and the Internet users should be allowed to have direct access to ccTLD. id. Moreover, this research will define what the implications of governance are, in order to improve the market of ccTLD. id...|$|R
40|$|In {{developing}} <b>countries,</b> {{iron deficiency}} (<b>ID)</b> {{and the related}} iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) affects about 50 % of children and woman and about 25 % of men. In total, an estimated two billion people is affected worldwide. In developing countries, a typical diet is based on cereals, legumes and vegetables and these contain many iron inhibitors like phytic acid and polyphenols. Iron fortification of maize meal, a staple food in South Africa {{is regarded as a}} cost effective, sustainable way to improve iron status in that country. The replacement of electrolytic iron with sodium iron (III) ethylenediaminetetraacetate (NaFeEDTA) (a more bioavailable source of iron) in the current multi-micronutrient fortificant premix added to maize meal as an iron fortificant compound has the potential to greatly enhance the efforts to improve the iron status of populations consuming high-phytate cereal-based diets. However, poor consumer acceptance, unacceptable taste and discolouration of iron fortified foods have been frequently listed as causes of unsuccessful iron fortification programmes. This study evaluated the effects of replacing electrolytic iron (35 mg iron/kg maize meal) in a multi-micronutrient fortificant premix with NaFeEDTA (at 15 and 30 mg iron/kg maize meal) added to special maize meal on the colour (L* a* b*) and sensory properties (appearance and flavour) of stiff porridges. The porridges were prepared using three different types of cooking vessels (stainless steel, cast iron and aluminium pots) and was evaluated fresh (within 30 minutes of preparation) and after 24 hour refrigerated storage (3 - 5 oC). The porridges were subjected to analytical sensory evaluation to test for difference or similarity and a consumer acceptance test (n = 80 consumers). Electrolytic iron significantly reduced L* and a* colour values in fortified maize meal when compared to maize meal fortified with the multi-micronutrient mix excluding iron. Elemental iron powders (e. g. electrolytic iron) being black or dark grey powders may have caused slight darkening of cereal flours. The spot iron test showed a uniform distribution of iron in maize meal with NaFeEDTA 15 (fortified with 15 mg iron/kg maize meal), NaFeEDTA 30 (fortified at 30 mg iron/kg maize meal) and electrolytic iron as well commercially fortified maize meals. Electrolytic iron or NaFeEDTA 15 and 30 maize meals resulted in stiff maize porridge prepared in aluminium, cast iron and stainless steel having lower L* values when compared to porridge prepared from maize meal fortified with the multi-micronutrient premix excluding iron. This could be attributed to interaction between polyphenols (ferulic and p-coumaric acid) found in maize meal and iron ions (Fe 2 +/Fe 3 +). This interaction has been suggested to induce structural changes and polymerisation in the polyphenols and thereby influencing their light absorption pattern and thus leading to darkening of maize porridges. Cast iron cookware showed significant differences (p < 0. 05) between iron treated porridges and control porridge (fortified with premix excluding iron) in both appearance and flavour while stainless steel showed significant differences (p < 0. 05) between iron treated porridges and control porridge only in flavour and aluminium cookware showed significant differences (p < 0. 05) between iron treated porridges and control porridge only in appearance. These differences could be attributed to the differences in thermal conductivity and heat transfer of the materials of the different cooking vessels and possible leaching of iron ions (Fe 3 +/Fe 2 +) from cast iron and stainless steel cookware and aluminium (Al 3 +) ions from aluminium cookware at different concentrations and/or rates during the cooking process. Appearance changes are probably due to the interaction between ion irons and polyphenols while flavour changes could be attributed to possible lipid oxidation of linoleic acid, a major polyunsaturated fatty acid found in maize meal. Iron ions (Fe 3 +/Fe 2 +) promotes lipid oxidation of linoleic acid leading to the development of hexanal, a major off-flavour compound in iron fortified maize meal porridge. Findings from this study indicate that a change from fortifying maize meal with electrolytic iron to NaFeEDTA will not lead to changes in appearance and flavour of maize porridge. However, an excess amount of NaFeEDTA (30 mg iron/kg maize meal) might lead to acceptability (taste) problems if porridge is prepared in cast iron cookware. Fortification of maize meal porridge with a more bioavailable source of iron (NaFeEDTA) may reduce the prevalence of iron deficiency in South Africa.
