5|$|The Mount Cayley {{field is}} one of the largest {{volcanic}} zones in the Garibaldi Belt. Smaller zones include the Garibaldi Lake volcanic field surrounding Garibaldi Lake and the Bridge River Cones on the northern flank of the upper Bridge River. These areas are adjacent to Canada's populated southwest <b>corner</b> <b>where</b> the population of British Columbia is the greatest.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{destruction}} of the majority of NY37B, the route was realigned west of Massena to follow a new riverside roadway to the hamlet of Louisville <b>Corner,</b> <b>where</b> it came to an end at NY37. The remainder of NY37B along the Massena–Louisville town line road and in Massena was unchanged. By 1960, a connector between NY37 in Louisville and NY37B and Massena utilizing NY37's former routing west of the village was designated as NY131. The alignments of NY37B and NY131 west of the Maple Street/ Town Line Road intersection were flipped , placing NY131 on the riverside and town line roads and NY37B on NY37's former routing into Massena.|$|E
5|$|In Kingsbury, US4 and NY149 {{head through}} an open area dotted with farms and ponds. The routes proceed southward to a {{junction}} known as Baldwin <b>Corner,</b> <b>where</b> US4 and NY149 split. While US4 heads to the southeast, NY149 continues due south, paralleling the Champlain Canal to an area known as Smith's Basin. Here, NY149 turns east and crosses both a railroad line and the canal—which NY149 had been following since joining US4 in downtown Fort Ann—to enter the town of Hartford. Here, the route winds its way eastward through a rural, mostly undeveloped area of Washington County as it intersects several county roads {{on its way to}} the hamlet of Hartford.|$|E

5|$|In March 2005, the {{construction}} process {{began with the}} sinking of the first caisson for the tower into the bedrock. In April, construction began on the foundation below the Chicago River. In July 2005, water from the river began seeping into the building site, through crevices in a <b>corner</b> <b>where</b> the foundation wall meets the Wabash Avenue Bridge. Divers discovered that the leak could not be sealed from the water side. After several other failed attempts to correct the problem, they drove a steel plate next to the gap and filled the space between with concrete after digging it out.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s the {{dovecote}} was inspected {{as part of}} {{an investigation}} into an outbreak of psittacosis (also known as parrot disease or parrot fever), a zoonotic infectious disease caused by the bacterium Chlamydophila psittaci, at the adjoining King's School. No cause was found for the infection. In 2010 restoration work was undertaken including repairs to the tops of the walls; these are exposed as the building no longer has a roof. Wall ties were used on the south west <b>corner</b> <b>where</b> the masonry was bulging. In addition, car parking and educational signage was provided. This was partially funded by South Somerset council, Bruton Town Council and the Heritage Lottery Fund to a total of £105,000.|$|E
5|$|NY195 {{began at}} an {{intersection}} with NY11B in the hamlet of Nicholville within {{the town of}} Lawrence. It headed north out {{of the community and}} into a series of cultivated fields. About quarter of the way between Nicholville and Lavery's Corner, the fields gave way to forested areas, which themselves ceded to more fields near an intersection with Cady Road. NY195 continued on to Lavery's <b>Corner,</b> <b>where</b> it intersected with a pair of county highways and turned east toward Lawrenceville. On its way to Lawrenceville, the highway met Ferris Road, the last through route along NY195's routing excluding the roadway at its northern terminus. East of Ferris Road, NY195 curved northeast to enter Lawrenceville, where it ended at US11.|$|E

5|$|Now in {{the town}} of Junius, the route follows an {{alignment}} parallel to that of the Thruway as it passes south of a large housing development and by a series of small lakes collectively known as Junius Ponds. NY318 continues on, passing through a mixture of forested areas and cultivated fields as it heads eastward through the town. Just past an intersection with Nine Foot Road (County Route108 or CR108), NY318 serves the Waterloo Premium Outlets, a large collection of outlet stores situated between NY318 and the Thruway. Past the outlet mall, the route continues through largely rural surroundings to the community of Stone Church <b>Corner,</b> <b>where</b> it briefly curves to the northeast before veering back to the east as it enters the town of Tyre.|$|E
5|$|Structure 4 {{is another}} pyramid-temple {{base on the}} west side of Plaza C. It has a low {{platform}} at its southeastern <b>corner,</b> <b>where</b> 48 severed heads were excavated immediately to the west. Schele and Mathews have speculated that these may be the heads of the K'iche' kings Tepupul and Itzayul together with other members of the K'iche' court who were captured by the Kaqchikels and decapitated. Most of the skulls were found with associated obsidian blades. Most of the skulls had been individually buried in pits cut into the floor of the plaza, although a few were grouped into small lots.|$|E
5|$|The {{narrative}} of the frieze begins at the southwest <b>corner</b> <b>where</b> the procession appears to divide into two separate files. The first third of the west frieze {{is not part of}} the procession, but instead, seems to be the preparatory stages for the participants. The first figure here is a marshal dressing, W30, followed by several men preparing the horses W28–23 until figure W22 who, it has been suggested, may be engaged in the dokimasia, the tryout or enrollment of the knights. W24 is an ambiguous figure who might be either the protesting owner of a rejected horse or a keryx (herald) whose hand held part of an otherwise lost salpinx (trumpet), but either way this point marks the beginning of the procession proper.|$|E

5|$|Villeneuve {{is still}} remembered at Grand Prix races, {{especially}} those in Italy. At the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari, the venue of the San Marino Grand Prix, a corner was named after him and a Canadian flag is painted on the third slot on the starting grid, from which he started his last race. There is also a bronze bust of him {{at the entrance to}} the Ferrari test track at Fiorano. At Zolder the <b>corner</b> <b>where</b> Villeneuve died has been turned into a chicane and named after him.|$|E
5|$|About 18 hours later, the {{depression}} was upgraded to {{a tropical storm}} and given the name Dan. The cyclone moved westward at , and convection continued to mature. Outflow was good across most of the system, except the northwestern <b>corner</b> <b>where</b> it was restricted by interaction with a nearby typhoon. Due to the cyclone's proximity to the Philippines, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration also monitored the storm, assigning it with the local name Saling. The JMA upgraded it to a tropical storm on October 9; both agencies recognized it as a typhoon the next day after an eye became visible and outflow improved in the northwestern quadrant. Dan made landfall on the southeastern coast of Luzon in the Philippines, and its center tracked {{just south of the}} Ninoy Aquino International Airport.|$|E
5|$|Following the Austrian Grand Prix on 16 July, {{the teams}} {{conducted}} testing sessions at three circuits from 18–21 July {{to prepare for}} the Grand Prix. McLaren, Benetton, Jordan, Jaguar, Sauber and BAR went to Silverstone over three days. Olivier Panis, McLaren's test driver, set the fastest time {{on the first day of}} testing. Jaguar test driver Luciano Burti crashed at Stowe <b>corner</b> <b>where</b> his car's suspension, front and rear wings, and sidepod were damaged. The resulting incident caused a brief halt to testing and Jaguar shipped a spare car for the next day's testing. Panis remained fastest on the second day. Trulli damaged his suspension and rear wing, resulting in repairs which limited his team's testing time. Burti suffered another incident when he lost his right rear wheel. Fisichella topped the third and final day's running. Ferrari test driver Luca Badoer spent four days at the Fiorano Circuit where he concentrated on testing engine and aerodynamic development whilst Michael Schumacher did practice starts and component testing on the fourth day.|$|E

5|$|Michael (Steve Carell), Pam (Jenna Fischer), and Ryan (B. J. Novak) are {{struggling}} {{to adjust to the}} work environment of the new Michael Scott Paper Company. The office space used to be a closet; water pipes run through the room, so they can hear the toilets flush from the Dunder Mifflin bathrooms above them. Ryan openly goofs off in front of Pam and Michael and insults both of them in their presence during phone conversations. Pam and Ryan bicker over who is responsible for making copies until Michael separates them into corners. Pam, who joined the company as a saleswoman, is given the <b>corner</b> <b>where</b> the photocopier sits. She is concerned that Michael will force her to be the receptionist, which is why she quit Dunder Mifflin in the first place. She goes upstairs and asks Charles Miner (Idris Elba) for her job back, but Charles has already given the job to a new employee, Kelly Hannon (Ellie Kemper), who ends up going by her middle name—Erin—to avoid confusion with Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling).|$|E
5|$|On land, {{the army}} at Madras was {{placed under the}} command of Colonel John Braithwaite. After {{assembling}} his forces at Wallyabad, Braithwaite marched on Pondicherry, occupying Villenore to the southwest and Arian Coupang to the south, cutting off the garrison from the supporting hinterland of the city. On 28 July, Braithwaite reached the city and established positions on the Red Hill overlooking Pondicherry, sending a demand to its commander Colonel Prosper de Clement that he surrender. The demand was refused, and Braithwaite ordered detachments from the 71st and 74th Regiments of Foot to occupy positions to the south of the city's walls on 30 July, a manoeuvre which prompted heavy fire from the bastions. This move was however a feint, Braithwaite planned to launch his main assault on the northeast <b>corner</b> <b>where</b> the defences were weaker and the ground drier.|$|E
5|$|The actual {{pay-per-view}} {{opened with}} the Legion of Doom (Hawk and Animal) taking on Money Inc. (Ted DiBiase and Irwin R. Schyster). The Legion of Doom used {{their size and}} power to wear down their opponents in the opening minutes of the match. Money Inc. gained the advantage when Hawk missed a flying clothesline. Hawk tried to tag in his partner but was unable for several minutes because Money Inc. kept {{him away from the}} <b>corner</b> <b>where</b> Animal was standing. Eventually, Hawk and Schyster hit each other at the same time. Hawk tagged Animal in, and the Legion of Doom attempted the Doomsday device, their signature move. Schyster stopped them, but Animal hit Schyster in retaliation, causing Schyster to run into DiBiase. Animal then powerslammed DiBiase and pinned him to get the victory.|$|E

5|$|The new wing has six dormers (three on a side), and six dormers {{were added}} to the old house in the 1913 {{renovation}} (four on the east side, two on the west). The windows {{on the first floor of}} the new wing matched the old windows, but the windows in the second story of the addition have twelve panes in the upper sash and eight in the lower. As part of the renovation work, four new windows were placed in the 1850s house: two just west of the new wing, and two on the east wall of the lower part of the L. A small porch was added in the <b>corner</b> <b>where</b> the west wall of the new wing meets the north wall of the old house, and all the old porches were restored. In the original house two chimneys were restored and two replaced, and new fireplaces were installed in the living room, library, and dining room. The house has a total of 28 rooms.|$|E
5|$|The {{route of}} the A1 in London runs from the {{northern}} end of St. Martin's Le Grand in the City to Borehamwood in Hertfordshire, then travels on the northern fringe of Greater London to Bignell's <b>Corner,</b> <b>where</b> it crosses the M25 and becomes a motorway, designated A1(M), which alternates with the dual carriageway A1 as it continues to Edinburgh. The London section of the road passes through part of the City of London and three London boroughs: Islington, Haringey and Barnet. The A1 is one of London's main northern routes, providing a link to the M1 motorway and the A1(M) motorway, and on to the Midlands, Northern England and Scotland. It connects a number of major areas within London, and sections of it serve as the High Street for many of the now-joined villages that make up north London. Even though it is one of London's major roads, less than 5% of its approximate 60,000 vehicles a day are through traffic – the bulk is local.|$|E
5|$|Sebastian Vettel slowly {{moved up}} the field, running {{eleventh}} on lap 18, only to spin a lap later at turn seven, falling back to 16th. He subsequently complained about a flat spot on his tyre, but continued without pitting. On lap 20, Sergio Pérez made a pit stop for new tyres and a front wing adjustment. Since the stop took longer than expected, he rejoined just before Sainz, Jr., who used the momentum to pass Pérez into turn one. Meanwhile, Räikkönen and Bottas were racing for sixth place. On lap 24, Bottas attacked around the outside into turn two, sticking to the inside line at the following <b>corner,</b> <b>where</b> Räikkönen did not back away {{and ran into the}} front-left of the Williams, breaking his own rear-right suspension and forcing him to retire on the spot, while Bottas was able to carry on. Rosberg came in for his scheduled pit stop on lap 27, while Hamilton waited two laps to follow suit, trying to get ahead. This proved unsuccessful, as he rejoined behind Rosberg after his stop on lap 29. On lap 35, Sergio Pérez attempted to overtake Carlos Sainz Jr. for ninth, who ran wide and kept his position. After his team radio informed him that he had done so by going off track, he handed the position to Pérez. Sebastian Vettel made a pit stop for a second time on lap 37 and rejoined in between the two Mercedes of Rosberg and Hamilton, albeit a lap down. He was told to let Hamilton go by as well some laps later.|$|E
50|$|In Canada, {{a double}} yellow {{line in the}} centre of the road means that it is unsafe for traffic {{travelling}} in either direction to pass (overtake). This is usually found on rolling hills or through <b>corners</b> <b>where</b> visibility is limited.|$|R
25|$|In {{the center}} of East Nassau, NY66 reaches a {{junction}} with the terminus of CR26 (Garfield Road).
