5|$|Severe Tropical Storm Wukong was a {{slow moving}} {{tropical}} cyclone which produced torrential rains over Japan. The tenth named storm of the 2006 Pacific typhoon season, Wukong developed out of a tropical depression over the open waters of the western Pacific Ocean. On August13, both the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) classified the depression as a tropical storm. The storm traveled along a <b>curving</b> <b>path</b> south of Japan, absorbing the remnants of Tropical Storm Sonamu on August15 before turning towards the west. Wukong made landfall at peak intensity late on August17 near Miyazaki City in southern Kyūshū. The cyclone remained over land for about 24hours before moving out over the Sea of Japan. The storm weakened to a tropical depression before dissipating on August21. Due to the slow movement of the storm, it produced heavy rains, peaking at 516mm (20.3in). Two people were killed due to rough seas produced by the storm and three others were injured.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the same}} time that Météo-France {{assessed}} Hondo to have peaked, the JTWC reported that the storm had attained winds of 230km/h (145mph 1-minute winds), equivalent to a strong Category 4 hurricane. Shortly after reaching peak intensity, the cloud tops around the eye began to warm, meaning that the storm was beginning to weaken. Hondo also turned towards the southwest and kept a steady pace as two subtropical highs began influencing its movement. The storm continued to weaken as cloud tops warmed but remained an intense tropical cyclone as its eye was still well-defined. Hondo briefly re-intensified later on February8 despite the structure of the storm deteriorating. The cyclone maintained intense tropical cyclone status through February10 due to the formation of a large eye which helped maintain the storms structure. Hondo gradually began to weaken due to a combination of decreasing sea surface temperatures and increasing forward motion. On February10, Hondo started a gradual <b>curving</b> <b>path</b> due to a trough located to the south and strengthening high pressure systems to the north. At 0600UTC, the storm was downgraded to a tropical cyclone as winds decreased to 155km/h (100mph).|$|E
500|$|A {{standard}} gauge railway tunnel, codenamed Ida, {{was to be}} built on a <b>curving</b> <b>path</b> that would connect it with both the east- and west-bound main line railway, allowing trains to run straight through the complex without needing to reverse or be turned around. This would serve as the main unloading station, where missiles and supplies would be offloaded onto trolleys that would transport them into the connecting galleries Mathilde and Hugo. Hugo connected in turn with Sophie, a dead-end railway tunnel branching from the main line into Ida. Each of the main tunnels {{had a number of}} unnamed side tunnels of the same dimensions as the main tunnels and up to [...] long. The central feature of the complex was a huge octagonal rocket-preparation chamber directly under the dome. It was never completed but would have been [...] in diameter and up to [...] high. A number of intermediate floors, possibly as many as ten, would have been built up the sides of the chamber.|$|E

500|$|K-143 {{begins at}} an {{interchange}} with Interstate 70 in the northernmost parts of Salina, Kansas. For the first [...] of the route, the highway travels due north through commercial and agricultural land within the Salina city limits. A short distance after this, K-143 transitions from a divided four-lane highway into a two-lane highway. It then crosses the Saline River and continues north through primarily agricultural land north of Salina. At , K-143 turns northwest and follows a gently <b>curving</b> <b>path</b> {{in that direction}} {{for the remainder of}} the route, ending at an interchange with US-81. The total length of the route is [...] K-143 has an AADT of 4,133 vehicles in the southernmost [...] of the route, with an AADT of 1,580–1,595 vehicles in the remainder of the route. The route is paved with a combination of full-design bituminous pavement, composite pavement, and partial-design bituminous pavement. K-143 is not a part of the National Highway System.|$|E
500|$|... where [...] is {{the mass}} of the object, [...] is the {{velocity}} of the object and [...] is the distance {{to the center of the}} circular path and [...] is the unit vector pointing in the radial direction outwards from the center. This means that the unbalanced centripetal force felt by any object is always directed toward the center of the <b>curving</b> <b>path.</b> Such forces act perpendicular to the velocity vector associated with the motion of an object, and therefore do not change the speed of the object (magnitude of the velocity), but only the direction of the velocity vector. The unbalanced force that accelerates an object can be resolved into a component that is perpendicular to the path, and one that is tangential to the path. This yields both the tangential force, which accelerates the object by either slowing it down or speeding it up, and the radial (centripetal) force, which changes its direction.|$|E
2500|$|Another famous work of Serra's is {{the mammoth}} {{sculpture}} Snake, {{a trio of}} sinuous steel sheets creating a <b>curving</b> <b>path,</b> permanently located in the largest gallery of the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao. In 2005, the museum mounted an exhibition of more of Serra's work, incorporating Snake into a collection entitled The Matter of Time. The whole work consists of eight sculptures measuring between 12 and 14 feet in height and weighing from 44 to 276 tons. Already in 1982-84, he had installed the permanent work La palmera in the Plaça de la Palmera in Barcelona. He has not always fared so well in Spain, however; also in 2005, the Centro de Arte Reina Sofía in Madrid announced that the 38-tonne sculpture Equal-Parallel/Guernica-Bengasi (1986) had been [...] "mislaid". In 2008, a duplicate copy {{was made by the}} artist and displayed in Madrid.|$|E

2500|$|Smith, {{the well}} known antiquarian, in 1895 {{describes}} the mound as being 22 paces in diameter, [...] {{high on the}} low side and [...] high on the high side. He states that it is well cared for and that a flight of steps, not clearly visible today, ran up from its base to the top. However significantly he makes no reference to any remains of the chapel itself. The 1897 25" [...] to the mile OS shows a path at the Chapelhill House side of the mound and a possibly a <b>curving</b> <b>path</b> or steps up. Smith also states that the mound was repaired some fifty years before, which fits in with the approximate dates for the likely construction of the Chapelton (old) house, by or for James McAlister who is given {{as the owner of}} Chapelton at around this time, and it is stated in 1874 that the chapel ruins were found some 40 years before, i.e. around 1834. The 1846 record states that they had been found recently however (Topo Dict Scot).|$|E
2500|$|The showpiece {{aesthetic}} {{stretch of}} the Reichsautobahn was the Irschenberg on the autobahn from Munich to the Austrian border, where instead of passing through the valley, the highway was routed in a <b>curving</b> <b>path</b> {{up the hill to}} the summit, from which there was a full view of the Alps to the south. A rest stop was located there. (The Irschenberg autobahn segment was one of those that limited the usefulness of the highways for freight transport, and with the increase in traffic after the war it became a notorious bottleneck and accident site. Many such segments have been straightened and in some cases the highway has been relocated.) In 1936 Otto Illauer's view of this stretch of highway won first prize in the photography contest Die schöne Straße in Bau und unter Verkehr (the beautiful road under construction and in use); the only criticism of the picture was that the contrast between the light-colored road and the landscape was too harsh, illustrating the strong desire for harmony between the highway and its surroundings. In fact this entire [...] segment epitomizes planning to maximize aesthetic appreciation of the landscape. Todt, who was credited with choosing the route, described it as an orchestrated experience culminating in the surprise view of the Chiemsee, where [...] "nyone who has a proper feel for this landscape... turns off the motor and silently glides down the three-kilometer-long slope to the southern shore of the lake, where a bathing beach, parking places, or the [...] invite you to stay and rest"; and according to Seifert, of the 13 possibilities for the continuation from the Chiemsee down to the Salzburg plain, the engineers had selected the only one that [...] " [...] the impossible possible" [...] by [...] "continu... on another level".|$|E

A second whizzed past Nigel's ear, as he tried to turn; but Aylward struck the great war-horse a sharp blow over the haunches, and it had galloped some hundreds of yards before its rider could pull it up. Aylward followed {{as hard as he could}} ride, bending low over his horse's neck, while arrows whizzed all around him.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Wheel-based {{motion is}} one of the most {{efficient}} and simple ways to move on smooth surfaces. Hence, wheeled mobile robots have attracted significant attention in the research field of mobile robots. Designing passive wheeled robots can provide more efficiency for the robot. However, generating predetermined <b>curved</b> <b>path</b> in passive mechanisms is a challenge. In this paper, a very simple wheeled passive robot capable of moving on a <b>curved</b> <b>path.</b> The robot moves on a simple ramp and its motion is driven by gravity force. The mechanism of robot allows predicting and determining its motion on 3 D <b>curved</b> <b>paths.</b> The motion of the robot is dependent to its configuration, thus the relationship between the configuration and the robot’s path is obtained. The performed analysis results are verified by simulations in ADAMS...|$|R
