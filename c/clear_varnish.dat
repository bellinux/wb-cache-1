This model was to supplement Solaris' offer on large buses, 18-metre buses for public transportation services. The first Solaris Urbino 18 bus unit went to PKA Gdynia in 1999, it was also the only new low-floor articulated bus bought in 1999 by transport companies in Poland. Initially, the 18-metre buses did not sell well because the transportation companies preferred smaller and cheaper 15-metre vehicles. The bus market expanded between 1996-2002, which resulted in the later increase in demand for 18-metre buses. In total, cities in Poland bought 12 units of the Solaris Urbino 18 First Generation. Articulated vehicles were mainly built for export, most Solaris Urbino 18 were bought by a company from Berlin and Riga. A characteristic feature of the bus are the painted railings instead of <b>clear</b> <b>varnish</b> yellow paint.|$|E

50|$|German {{aircraft}} {{left the}} factory {{in a standard}} finish, although this differed from one manufacturer to another. <b>Clear</b> <b>varnish</b> on fabric and wooden surfaces had changed by 1916 to various camouflage schemes. In the Jagdstaffeln this {{gave way to a}} riot of colour, as pilots repainted their machines as they pleased. In January 1917, when he took over Jasta 11, Richthofen celebrated by painting his Albatros red and the squadron followed suit, painting at least part of their machines red. Other Jagdstaffeln soon adopted the fashion until few fighters flew in the manufacturers' finish, their fuselages in particular at least sporting the pilot's monogram or perhaps his favourite colour(s), even if the wings (as was often the case) remained in camouflage. A squadron theme was sometimes followed, with machines decorated in similar colours or with similar motifs but generally personal preference seems to have been prevalent. More than one pilot (on both sides) recorded that the contrast with the plain khaki of RFC fighters was helpful in rapidly distinguishing friend from foe in the hurly-burly of a dogfight and might have aided the accreditation of air victories claimed by individual German pilots.|$|E
5000|$|Making a lacquer {{painting}} {{may take}} several months {{depending on the}} technique used {{and the number of}} layers of lacquer. In Vietnam's sơn mài lacquer painting first a black board is prepared. Then outlines in chalk are picked out in white with eggshell and <b>clear</b> <b>varnish,</b> then polished. Then the first layer of coloured lacquer is applied, usually followed by silver leaf and another layer of clear lacquer. Then several more layers of different coloured lacquers are painted by brush, with clear lacquer layers between them. In Vietnam an artist may apply up to ten layers or more of coloured and clear lacquer. In Ming China processes included up to a hundred layers. Each layer requires drying and polishing. When all layers are applied the artist polishes different parts of the painting until the preferred colours show. Fine sandpaper and a mix of charcoal powder and human hair is used to carefully reach the correct layer of each specific colour. Consequently, [...] "lacquer painting" [...] is in part a misnomer, since the bringing out of the colours is not done in the preparatory painting but in the burnishing of the lacquer layers to reveal the desired image beneath.|$|E

50|$|Exterior use of {{polyurethane}} varnish may {{be problematic}} {{due to its}} heightened susceptibility to deterioration through ultra-violet light exposure. All <b>clear</b> or translucent <b>varnishes,</b> and indeed all film-polymer coatings (e.g. paint, stain, epoxy, synthetic plastic, etc.) are susceptible to this damage in varying degrees. Pigments in paints and stains protect against UV damage. UV-absorbers are added to polyurethane and other varnishes (e.g. spar varnish) to work against UV damage but are decreasingly effective {{over the course of}} 2-4 years, depending on {{the quantity and quality of}} UV-absorbers added, as well as the severity and duration of sun exposure. Water exposure, humidity, temperature extremes, and other environmental factors affect all finishes. By contrast, wooden items retrieved from the Egyptian pyramids have a new and fresh appearance after 4000 years of storage. Even there, however, fungal colonies were present, and mildew and fungus are another category of entities which attack varnish. In other words, the only coat of varnish with near perfect durability is the one stored in a vacuum, in darkness, at a low and unvarying temperature. Otherwise, care and upkeep are required.|$|R

Convex shapes always provide the ideal geometry for highlights, areas of very strong reflectance, regardless of the orientation of the surface or position of the receiver. Despite highlights and glossy appearance being common in chemically defended insects, their potential signalling function is unknown. We tested the role of highlights in warning colouration of a chemically defended, alpine leaf beetle, Oreina cacaliae. We reduced the beetles’ glossiness, hence their highlights, by applying a <b>clear</b> matt finish <b>varnish</b> on their elytra. We used blue tits as predators to examine whether the manipulation affected their initial latency to attack, avoidance learning and generalization of warning colouration. The birds learned to avoid both dull and glossy beetles but they initially avoided glossy prey more than dull prey. Interestingly, avoidance learning was generalized asymmetrically: birds that initially learned to avoid dull beetles avoided glossy beetles equally strongly, but not vice versa. We conclude that specular reflectance and glossiness can amplify the warning signal of O. cacaliae, augmenting avoidance learning, even if it is not critical for it...|$|R

Method: Rectangular dentin blocks from root trunks of extracted permanent molars were cut into four blocks each. All blocks were coated with <b>clear</b> <b>varnish</b> except one flat surface of similar size. The 4 dentin blocks from the same tooth were allocated into four different groups randomly. Gp 1 - Artificial caries lesions (≈ 200 µm deep) created (BHI broth, multi-species cariogenic bacteria, 10 days) + SDF; Gp 2 -Artificial caries lesion created + SDF + KI; Gp 3 - immersed in sterilized BHI broth (10 days) + SDF; Gp 4 - immersed in sterilized BHI broth (10 days) + SDF + KI. Color of the dentin blocks was recorded using PANTONE color sheets and was coded into 1 -Light yellow (PANTONE code: 12 - 0704 -TPX/ 11 - 0907 -TPX); 2 -Yellow (1205 U/ 7401 U); 3 -Light brown/Greyish (4635 U/ 402 U); 4 -Dark brown/Black (4625 U/BlackU) for comparison. Result: All dentin blocks (each group n= 20) had similar color at baseline (coded 1). After intervention, all dentin blocks in Gp 1 and Gp 3 while no block in Gp 2 and Gp 4 were coded 4. A total number (proportion) of 5 (25 %), 13 (65 %), and 2 (10 %) of the blocks in Gp 2 was coded into 1, 2, and 3 respectively. The corresponding values for blocks in Gp 4 were 3 (15 %), 13 (65 %), and 4 (20 %) respectively. Pairwise comparison of Friedman’s two-way ANOVA showed that the rank of color coding of dentin blocks receiving SDF+KI was significantly lower than those receiving SDF alone regardless of the lesion/sound status of the dentin surfaces (Gp 2 vs. Gp 1 and Gp 4 vs. Gp 3, p< 0. 001). Conclusion: The blackening effect of topical application of SDF solution on dentin surfaces can be reduced by an immediate application of KI solution following it...|$|E

The sequence of procedures during the surgery includes {{exposure of the}} involved apex, root-end resection, root-end cavity preparation and placement of a root-end filling. The root-end filling is {{necessary in order to}} provide a hermetic seal, thereby preventing the egress of micro-organisms into the periradicular tissues from the root canal system. The purpose of this in-vitro study was to compare the microleakage of three calcium silicate cements and amalgam when used as retrograde filling materials. One hundred and twenty single rooted, single canal, human teeth with closed apices were collected and stored in Phosphate Buffered Saline after extraction. All root canals were instrumented using ProTaper rotary instruments and obturated by warm vertical condensation using gutta-percha with Topseal Root Canal Sealer. Access cavities were sealed with Fuji IX glass ionomer restorative material. The apical 3 mm of each root was resected perpendicular to the long axis of the root and root-end cavities were prepared to a depth of 3 mm using ProUltra surgical ultrasonic tips. The teeth were randomly divided into four groups (n= 30) : Group 1 - ProRoot MTA (Dentsply/Maillefer) Group 2 - MTA PlusTM (Prevest Denpro Limited) Group 3 – BiodentineTM (Septodont) Group 4 – Permite Amalgam (SDI) The materials were manipulated according to the manufacturer’s instructions and used to fill the root-end cavities. The specimens were then coated with two layers of <b>clear</b> <b>varnish,</b> except the resected apical surface. Teeth were stored in gauze, moistened with Phosphate Buffered Saline for 24 hours and thereafter submerged in Indian Ink dye for 48 hours. The excess dye was rinsed off the specimens under running water. Specimens were then sectioned horizontally in one millimetre increments from the apical end of the root. The extent of dye penetration was measured to the nearest millimetre using a stereomicroscope. Data for different groups was collected and summarised in terms of percentage for the outcome vector (no leak, 1 mm leak, 2 mm leak and 3 mm leak). Furthermore pairwise comparisons between each of the calcium silicate materials to amalgam were done at the 0. 017 level of significance, using Fisher’s exact test. Amalgam showed significantly more leakage than the calcium silicate materials (p< 0. 001). No significant differences were found among the calcium silicate materials, namely, BiodentineTM vs ProRoot (p= 0. 776), BiodentineTM vs MTA PlusTM (p= 0. 667) and ProRoot vs MTA PlusTM (p= 0. 350).

40|$|Fabulous Hats’ {{featured}} {{new work}} {{commissioned by the}} Royal Mail to celebrate the individual skills of four British milliners. International fashion photographer Nick Knight photographed each of the hats separately, modelled by Erin O'Connor, clearly identifiable in silhouette. This {{was the first time}} in history that the identity of a living person, other than HM the Queen, has been revealed on a stamp. The hat selected pioneered a series of pieces, which continued a five-year investigation into ideas and techniques employed to create innovative structures for the head-using feathers. Examining the qualities of transparency that could be achieved using white Turkey ‘broads’, the feathers were transformed with the application of <b>clear</b> lacquers and <b>varnishes</b> that both increased the transparency to different degrees and created an inflexible structure that could be cut and accept further surface applications. This surface technique, appropriated from Japanese lacquer work, was re-examined in relation to a composite form comprising numbers of feathers, whereby frequencies of repetition correlated with differing densities. Through experimentation, the span of the final structure could be defined. Accepting the resonance with the wings from which the feathers themselves are taken, and with reference to the biomorphic structures of Engineer Santiago Calatrava, the individual feather units pivot around a fulcrum and are secured to achieve the frequency, span and opacity required to mask the identity of the wearer. The silhouette of the construction is defined with the ‘clipping’ of the margins that the lacquer enables, and the further application of a stencilled motif with coloured lacquer acts as a further foil. The work was published as part of the Royal Mail Year Book and disseminated in The Times newspaper, South Wales Echo and Graphics International Magazine...|$|R
40|$|Think {{of perfume}} wrappings and {{chocolate}} boxes. For such high quality printing products, printing inks with special effect pigments are used more frequently {{due to the}} unique optical properties and visual appearance. The shifting color, the pearlescent gloss and the visible texture of printed special effect colors fascinate the observer. A {{lack of knowledge about}} the printing of special effect colors and about the description of the optical properties and visual appearance causes problems. First, special effect printing calls for knowledge about the influence of different printing parameters. Therefore, multiple samples varying in the special effect pigment, paper quality, varnishing state and background color were printed. In screen printing, 22 inks with pigments of BASF SE were applied on a white glossy and black uncoated paper. The combination of 22 pigments with two paper grades or background colors results in 44 application cases. In total, 224 application cases were realized in flexo printing with 28 pigments of MERCK KGaA, two paper qualities, two background colors and two varnishing states. A white glossy and matt coated paper was partially primed with a black light-absorbing ink and partly <b>varnished</b> with a <b>clear</b> gloss <b>varnish.</b> Furthermore, some knowledge about the bidirectional reflectance and texture distribution is required to specify the optical properties. A database was thus generated basing on spectral and imaging measurements in multiple geometric configurations. The determined reflectance spectra, color coordinates and texture parameters are filed in a hierarchical structure. Using the freely available bidirectional reflectance and texture data (www. idd. tu-darmstadt. de, office@idd. tudarmstadt. de), the influence of the varied printing parameters on perception-related parameters was investigated. A medium and very high hue difference sum is caused by interference effect and multi-color pigments, respectively. For the comparably large sparkle pigments, the sparkle parameters are particularly high. Perceptually, the lightness difference sum and the relative luminance difference do not satisfactorily represent the lightness shift and the contrast gloss or distinctness-of-image gloss. All considered parameters are significantly lower for the white paper than the black printed background. Finally, the essential visual appearance attributes should be known for the description of the visual appearance. Their number and nature was determined by means of visual experiments and statistical evaluations. In a color matching light both and a multi-angle test bench, 14 rolled screen and 20 planar flexo printing samples were presented, respectively. Visual differences and twelve attributes were rated in relative and absolute category scaling experiments, respectively. They were evaluated in classical multidimensional scaling, in two correlation analyses, a principal component analysis and in an exploratory factor analysis. According to the STRESS values, cumulated variances and the eigenvalues, at most six attributes are essential. Significantly positive correlation coefficients between the two and three tested gloss and texture attributes, respectively, suggest their joint consideration. The composition and factor loadings indicate that the six essential attributes are the four color attributes hue, chroma, lightness and hue shift as well as the two combined attributes for gloss and texture...|$|R
