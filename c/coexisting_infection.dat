40|$|Background: In the {{presence}} of several <b>coexisting</b> <b>infections,</b> superimposed tissue necrosis or tissue metaplasia, {{it may be difficult}} to recognize standard histologic morphology on hematoxylin-eosin slides. Tissue microdissection combined with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR-MD) offers the advantages of high specificity and relative speed. The objective of this study was to describe the use of PCR-MD in identifying potentiating viral co-infection in patients with HIV/AIDS with retinitis and choroiditis. Methods: Eyes from two patients with HIV/AIDS with several ocular infections were studied by a variety of techniques, including standard histologic examination, immunochemistry, electron microscopy and in situ hybridization. PCR-MD was used to identify <b>coexisting</b> viral <b>infections.</b> Results: Histologic examination showed cytomegalovirus retinitis in both cases. Use of PCR-MD allowed the identification of Epstein-Barr virus within a zone of fulminant varicella-zoster virus retinitis in one patient. PCR-MD confirmed {{the presence}} of human herpesvirus 8 in the second patient, who had ocular lymphoma. Interpretation: PCR-MD can be used to demonstrate <b>coexisting</b> viral <b>infection</b> in ocular specimens from patients with unusually fulminant courses.

40|$|Nasopharyngeal {{swabbing}} substantially underestimates carriage of Neisseria meningitidis. Real-time PCR assays {{were employed}} to examine {{the presence of a}} broad range of bacteria and of N. meningitidis groups B and C, respectively, in tonsils from 26 individuals from Oxford, England, and 72 individuals from Zurich, Switzerland. The detection limit of each PCR system was DNA from one bacterial cell per reaction mixture. Tonsillar DNA did not inhibit amplification of meningococcal gene sequences, and N. meningitidis was detected in tonsils exposed to the bacterium. Whereas in both sets of patients other bacteria were detected, N. meningitidis group B and group C were only found in tonsils from Oxford where the incidence of invasive meningococcal disease is much higher than in Zurich. These observations suggest that PCR-based methods could be used for the detection of meningococcal carriage and that difference in disease incidence could be explained by different transmission rates in the community rather than host genetics or <b>coexisting</b> <b>infections...</b>|$|R

40|$|Hyperimmunoglobulin E {{syndrome}} (HIES) or Job’s {{syndrome is}} a rare immunodeficiency disease with less than 200 cases reported worldwide, among which few cases are reported with lesions due to herpes simplex virus (HSV) or human papillomavirus (HPV). This case study presents a rare case of HIES with coinfection of HSV and HPV. A 12 -year-old boy, previously diagnosed with HIES, presented with a large conjunctival mass lesion. The presence of HPV in the lesion was confirmed by biopsy and by using the line-probe assay method to detect the HPV genome. However, the mass lesion {{did not respond to}} anti-HPV therapy with topical interferon-α 2 b (IFN-α 2 b) and oral cimetidine but improved promptly after intravenous (IV) acyclovir, which is often administered for cutaneous herpetic lesions. This suggested the presence of HSV in the conjunctival mass. Review of pathology and HSV immunohistochemical staining confirmed the presence of HSV as a coinfection. The likelihood that the mass arose from an abnormal host response to HSV and HPV due to HIES was considered, but <b>coexisting</b> <b>infection</b> with these two viruses and HIES has not been reported in the literature; therefore, such cases require further investigation...|$|E
40|$|Difloxacin {{is a new}} {{quinolone}} {{antimicrobial agent}} with in vitro activity against both Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis and a long (26 -h) half-life. A single oral dose of 200 mg of difloxacin was used to treat 30 men with uncomplicated urethral gonorrhea in an open trial. Of the isolates of N. gonorrhoeae, three produced penicillinase and two were resistant to tetracycline. N. gonorrhoeae was eradicated from all 29 evaluable patients. The geometric mean MIC of difloxacin for 30 pretreatment N. gonorrhoeae isolates was 0. 014 (range, {{less than or equal}} to 0. 0039 to 0. 03) microgram/ml. Four (13. 3 %) of the 30 subjects with gonococcal urethritis also had C. trachomatis recovered from their pretreatment cultures. Treatment with difloxacin was associated with the eradication of C. trachomatis from all four men. In addition, C. trachomatis was isolated from the posttreatment culture of only one man who had a negative culture before treatment. Nineteen patients (65. 5 %) reported adverse experiences, and 17 of them (58. 6 %) developed symptoms suggestive of central nervous system dysfunction.

40|$|Studies on {{the role}} of {{nutrition}} in amebiasis in humans and experimental animals are meager. Some reports suggest that malnutrition of the host increases the incidence of in-fection and potentiates the severity of the disease. Others suggest that malnutrition pro-tects the host against invasion. A few reports indicate that dietary regimens can alleviate symptoms and even eradicate the parasite. Others doubt a correlation between diet and rate of infection or disease manifestations. The problem is complex because the ameba is influenced by its own diet, which in turn depends on the host's diet, the bacterial flora of the gut, and <b>coexisting</b> <b>infections.</b> The host is variously altered by dietary depletions and supplementations, which affect susceptibility and resistance, and by the presence of other disease conditions. Carefully designed and executed studies of infections in humans and experimental animals, combined with studies in vitro of the nutritional re-quirements and physiology of the parasite, are needed for definition of the influence of host nutrition in amebiasis.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} as {{to whether}} <b>coexisting</b> <b>infection</b> is helpful to achieve the tumor regression, the inhibitory effect was experimentally assessed from the view point of survival, the degrees of reticuloendothelial activation (Congo-red clearance test) and immune response (Jerne' plaque forming cell test and macrophage migration inhibition test). A 3 × 107 to 2 × 108 of β-streptococcus inoculated in C 3 H mice of 6 week-old were prepared for producing a varying models of infection. As a control study, survival challenging for a 1 X 106 of Ehrlich tumor inoculation was surveyed. It averaged 16. 6 days, whereas it increased when added infection. The most longest survival was 24. 4 days when infection was provoked when a 3 × 107 β-streptococcus were inoculated subcutaneously 5 days prior to Ehrlich tumor cell implantation. Phagocytic activity in the recticuloendothelial system {{was found to be}} consequent of stimulation by the varying variety of infection. To assess the inhibitory effect of induced infection on tumor growth, a directly weighing method was applied for inoculated methylcholantrene tumor at interval of 5 days. It is proved that infection is more effective in depressing tumor growth. Furthermore, our experiment indicated that infection enabled the host to enhance the immune response to various antigen, which might be originated from the reticuloendothelial hyperactivity.

40|$|A new {{pathogen}} strain can penetrate {{an immune}} host population {{only if it}} can escape immunity generated against the original strain. This model is best understood with influenza viruses, in which genetic drift creates antigenically distinct strains that can spread through host populations {{despite the presence of}} immunity against previous strains. Whether this selection model for new strains applies to complex pathogens responsible for endemic persistent infections, such as anaplasmosis, relapsing fever, and sleeping sickness, remains untested. These complex pathogens undergo rapid within-host antigenic variation by using sets of chromosomally encoded variants. Consequently, immunity is developed against a large repertoire of variants, dramatically changing the scope of genetic change needed for a new strain to evade existing immunity and establish <b>coexisting</b> <b>infection,</b> termed strain superinfection. Here, we show that the diversity in the alleles encoding antigenic variants between strains of a highly antigenically variant pathogen was equal to the diversity within strains, reflecting equivalent selection for variants to overcome immunity at the host population level as within an individual host. This diversity among strains resulted in expression of nonoverlapping variants that allowed a new strain to evade immunity and establish superinfection. Furthermore, we demonstrated that a single distinct allele allows strain superinfection. These results indicate that there is strong selective pressure to increase the diversity of the variant repertoire beyond what is needed for persistence within an individual host and provide an explanation, competition at the host population level, for the large genomic commitment to variant gene families in persistent pathogens...|$|E
40|$|Infective {{complications}} {{are common}} after renal transplantation. Tuberculosis (TB) {{is one of}} the leading infections following renal transplantation. Reactivation is the most common mode of infection. The factors responsible for this reactivation are chronic liver disease, other <b>coexisting</b> <b>infections,</b> particularly deep mycoses, pneumocystis pneumonia, nocardia, and CMV infections. Cyclosporine use advances the onset of TB to an earlier date. The median onset following transplantation is estimated to be 26 months for those who receive azathioprine and prednisolone as immunosuppression and 11 months for those who receive cyclosporine along with other immunosuppressive agents. Lung is the major site of involvement. Pyrexia of unknown origin is another common presentation. Culture and sensitivity has to be done in all possible cases. Amongst the serological techniques, Interferon alpha production is emerging as the most important. Rifampicin has to be avoided in allograft recipients as it activates cytochrome-P 450 enzymes and thereby decreases the therapeutic levels of cyclosporine and prednisolone. The duration of treatment is usually extended for 18 months followed by secondary prophylaxis with isoniazid. Adverse effects of drugs are more often reported in organ recipients and have to be monitored for. Drug resistance is emerging as a problem and appropriate changes in the management have to be carried out...|$|R
40|$|Erysipelas is  an acute, erythematous, rapidly {{spreading}} skin infection, usually {{caused by}} beta-haemolytic group A Streptococcus bacteria. The disease is usually {{located on the}} legs and toes, less frequently on the face. One of the predisposing factors for the development of erysipelas are <b>coexisting</b> <b>infections.</b> The aim of the work was to attempt to determine whether there was any connection between the atypical course of erysipelas and Helicobacter pylori infection in a  47 -year-old female patient. The patient had a history of treatment for chronic otitis media with effusion and recurring abdominal pain. The current disease started abruptly with fever, erythematous skin lesion located on the right cheek and severe pain in the right ear. After a few days, the facial erythema got worse, oedema appeared {{on the right side}} of the face and redness, oedema and pain in the auricle could be observed. After examinations by an ENT specialist and a dermatologist, erysipelas of the face, auricle and external auditory meatus was diagnosed. The diagnosis was confirmed by bacteriological examination. As a result of antibiotic therapy skin lesions subsided and the patient’s general condition improved. As the dyspeptic symptoms exacerbated, a diagnostic test was performed and a coexisting Helicobacter pylori infection was diagnosed. The overall clinical picture and data obtained from medical literature suggest that the <b>coexisting</b> Helicobacter pylori <b>infection</b> could have contributed to both the chronic otitis media with effusion and atypical course of erysipelas. According to medical literature, in the case of patients with dyspeptic symptoms, Helicobacter pylori bacteria can be transferred from the lining of the stomach upwards to the oral cavity, middle ear and paranasal sinuses. Kariya et al. in their review of original work suggested that Helicobacter pylori may contribute to the exacerbation of an existing inflammation in the middle ear, which is a microaerophilic environment required for this bacteria to grow. In conclusion, it seems that constant stimulation of the immune system by Helicobacter pylori could have caused the system to become dysregulated and weakened, which probably accounted for the atypical course of erysipelas in the patient described...|$|R

We assessed the ability of airway leukocytes to produce nitric oxide (NO) in relation to differential inflammatory cell counts, levels of asthma severity, and <b>coexisting</b> airway mycotic <b>infections.</b> The study was carried out on leukocytes from the induced sputa (IS) of 14 patients with asthma complicated by mycotic airway infections undergoing prolonged glucocorticoid therapy (group FcA). Three groups of subjects without airway fungal infections were also studied: 18 glucocorticoid-treated asthmatics (group cA), 11 steroid-free asthmatics (group A), and 13 healthy control subjects (group H). In group FcA, both the level of spontaneous production of NO and the percentages of neutrophils in the IS were significantly higher than in all the remaining groups. Additionally, a significant positive correlation was noticed between the NO levels and both the percentages of neutrophils in the IS and the symptom intensity scores. The results suggest a possible predominant role of neutrophils in the overproduction of NO related to asthma severity and <b>coexisting</b> fungal <b>infections</b> in glucocorticoid-treated patients...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE—Evaluation of {{nutritional}} recovery, intestinal permeability, and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) response in malnourished children with persistent diarrhoea and {{their relation to}} concomitant systemic infection(s).  STUDY DESIGN—Open study of severely malnourished children (aged 6 - 36 months) with persistent diarrhoea (⩾ 14 days) admitted for nutritional rehabilitation with a standardised rice-lentil and yogurt diet. Successful recovery was defined prospectively as overall weight gain (> 5 g/kg/day) with a reduction in stool output by day 7 of treatment. Data on <b>coexisting</b> <b>infections</b> and serum C reactive protein (CRP) were collected at admission.  RESULTS—Of 63 children, 48 (group A) recovered within seven days of dietary treatment. These children had {{a significant increase in}} serum IGF-I (ΔIGF-I%) and, in contrast to serum prealbumin and retinol binding protein, ΔIGF-I% correlated with weight gain (r = 0. 41). There was no correlation between the IGF-I response and intestinal permeability as assessed by urinary lactulose/rhamnose excretion. Treatment failures (group B) included more children with clinical (relative risk, 4. 8; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 2 to 19. 7) and culture proven sepsis at admission and higher concentrations of serum CRP (median (range), 36 (0 − 182) v 10 (0 − 240) mg/l) at admission. There was a negative correlation between admission CRP concentration and ΔIGF-I% (r = − 0. 45).  CONCLUSIONS—In comparison with serum albumin, prealbumin, and retinol binding protein, serum IGF-I increment is a better marker {{of nutritional}} recovery in malnourished children with persistent diarrhoea. The possible association of systemic infections, serum IGF-I response, and mucosal recovery needs evaluation in future studies. ...|$|R

The aims of this study were to describe the epidemiology, clinical features and prognosis of Tuberculosis (TB) in kidney transplant recipients. Methods. Retrospective observational study conducted in 14 French transplant centres involving all cases of TB that occurred in kidney transplant recipients between 1986 and 2006. Results. Among the 16146 kidney transplantations per-formed during the study period, 74 (0. 45 %) developed TB. The country of birth was a highly endemic area for TB in 20 (40. 8 %) patients. Time from kidney transplanta-tion to TB was 10 months (4 – 27). Extrapulmonary and disseminated TB accounted for 33 (67. 4 %) cases. The most common symptoms were fever (71. 7 %), weight loss (41. 3 %) and asthenia (39. 1 %). <b>Coexisting</b> <b>infections</b> were diagnosed in 11 (22. 4 %) patients. Microbial sensitivity tests revealed no case of multidrug-resistant TB. Haemo-phagocytic syndrome associated with TB was diagnosed in 5 (10. 2 %) cases with 60 % of mortality (P 0. 0005). Me-dian length of antituberculous therapy was 12 (9. 5 – 12) months. Immunosuppressive therapy was reduced in 22 (44. 9 %) patients without adverse consequence on the graft. Overall, hospital mortality was 6. 1 % and 1 -year graft sur-vival was 97 %. Conclusions. Kidney transplantation increases the risk of TB, with a high rate of extrapulmonary disease. Symptoms of infection are often attenuated, leading to delayed diagnosis. Overall prognosis is good but haemophagocytic syndrome is associated with high mortality.

Methods: A prospective cross-sectional study conducted among children aged 6 months to 59 months with PEM seen at Usmanu Danfodiyo University Teaching Hospital, Sokoto between 1 st November, 2009 and 30 th April, 2010. The age, sex and weight of the subjects were documented. The CD 4 FNx 01 T-lymphocyte count was determined using Partec cytoflow machine and HIV infection was confirmed with ELISA for children > 1 - 8 months and DNA PCR for those aged < 18 months. Results: One-hundred children with PEM were recruited over a 6 month period. The mean age (# 177;SD) was 19. 8 # 177; 9. 2 months. Ninety-seven were aged < 3 years with M: F ratio of 1. 8 : 1. 0. HIV infection was detected in twenty-seven of these children and 48. 1 % of the HIV infected had marasmus. The mean CD 4 FNx 01 T-lymphocyte count in children with PEM without HIV infection was 1864. 8 # 177; 705. 3 cells/pL compared to significantly lower mean count of 747. 7 + 361. 7 cells/pL among those with PEM with <b>coexisting</b> HIV <b>infection</b> (t= - 7. 8, p= 0. 0001).

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The clinical files of 242 diabetics older than eighty years, treated between 1999 and 2002 were studied retrospectively. Demographic (sex, age, year of first contact), clinical (causes of admission, co-morbidities, duration of diabetes, previous hypoglycaemic treatment, duration of hospitalisation and evolution) and biochemical (glycaemia, HbA 1 c, lipaemia and C-peptide) data were recorded. RESULTS: A progressive rising in the number of aged patients was found during this period (seven in 1999 to 55 in 2002), with a large proportion of women (73 %). The more frequent causes of in-hospital treatment were hyperglycaemia (20. 6 %) and feet ulcers (septic or necrotic) (16. 5 %). In nearly 42 % of the cohort an acute infection was found. Diabetes was unknown in 13 % of cases and less than ten years of duration in 38 %. In this cohort most of the patients (77 %) were treated with oral hypoglycaemic drugs, mostly sulfonylureas.

Hence, a study was designed to find the frequency of B 19 infection and its transmission in multitransfused thalassemia patients. Materials and Methods: Ninety multitransfused beta-thalassemia major (thalassemia) patients, 32 controls (age, sex matched) without any history of transfusion were enrolled. Besides the donor units were tested in B 19 un-infected patients. B 19 specific IgG and IgM antibodies in the sera were analyzed by ELISA (in-house), using B 19 VPI and VP 2 recombinant and purified antigens; additionally HBsAg and anti-HIV and anti-HCV antibodies were tested for <b>coexisting</b> <b>infections.</b> Results: Seventy-three (81 &#x 0025;) thalassemia patients tested positive for anti-B 19 IgG antibodies as compared to seven (21 &#x 0025;) in the controls group (P < 0. 01), while anti-B 19 IgM antibodies were detected in 37 (41. 1 &#x 0025;) compared to two (6. 2 &#x 0025;) in the controls (P < 0. 01). Mean age of the thalassemia patient was eight years (range 2 - 18 years) and B 19 infection was highest in the six-to-ten year range. Seropositivity increased with the number of transfusions. Two of the four HBsAg positive and five of the seven anti-HCV IgM antibody-positive patients also had anti-B 19 IgM. After a six-month follow-up, four (25 &#x 0025;) of the 16 seronegative patients seroconverted and anti-B 19 IgM antibodies were detected in their donor units. Conclusions: Most of multitransfused thalassemics were B 19 seropositive or had anti-B 19 IgM; in the remaining uninfected group, B 19 got transmitted through infected / IgM-positive donor units...|$|R

Necrotizing fasciitis is a life-threatening soft tissue infection that results in rapid local tissue destruction. Type 1 necrotizing fasciitis is characterized by polymicrobial, synergistic infections that are caused by non-Group A streptococci, aerobic and anaerobic organisms. Type 2 necrotizing fasciitis involves Group A Streptococcus (GAS) {{with or without a}} <b>coexisting</b> staphylococcal <b>infection.</b> Here we provide the first report of necrotizing fasciitis jointly associated with the microbes Group B Streptococcus and Staphylococcus lugdunensis. S. lugdunensis is a commensal human skin bacterium known to cause often painful and prolonged skin and soft tissue infections. To our knowledge, however, this is the first case of Staph. lugdunensis-associated necrotizing fasciitis to be reported in the literature. 1...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND : Chronic Suppurative Otitis Media (CSOM) is {{a disease}} of {{multiple}} aetiology and well known for its persis tence and recurrence inspite of treatment and are the bearbug of otologist, paediatrician and general practitioner. One of the reason s for the refractoriness to treatment and chronicity is coexist ing fungal infection of the ear. OBJECTIVES: Are {{to find out the}} prevalence of fungal infections in chronic discharging ears and to identify and isolate the type of fungus prevalent in these ears. MATERIALS AND METHOD S: Tertiary care hospital level descrip tive study was conducted in 50 cases of CSOM with actively discharging ears for a period of one year starting from February 2013. For all the cases aural swabs were collected from the diseased ear and were used for direct microscopic examination in potassi um hydroxide wet mount. Ear swab was cultured on Sabouraud’s dextrose agar plate for fungal cultures. The patient characteristics were prospectively recorded and results were analysed. CONCLUSION : There is high prevalence of <b>coexisting</b> fungal <b>infection</b> in actively discharging ears of CSOM patient...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} a {{prospective}} study in the University Teaching Hospital, Lusaka, Zambia, {{on the impact of}} Human Immunodeficiency Virus on the incidence and prognosis of Fournier's gangrene is presented; Zambia has been in the grip of an HIV epidemic since the early 1980 s. A total of 10 patients with an average age of 32 years was observed during a 14 -month period (March 1992 -April 1993); eight patients had associated HIV infection. A contributory factor to the development of Fournier's gangrene was also present in seven patients, of which six involved the urinary tract. All patients were managed by early surgical débridement under antibiotic cover. Two patients died, only one of whom had associated HIV disease. This study has recorded a significant rise in the prevalence of Fournier's gangrene in Zambia since the advent of the HIV epidemic. It has also been documented that provided aggressive treatment along established lines is initiated without delay, the <b>coexisting</b> HIV <b>infection</b> does not adversely affect the prognosis of Fournier's gangrene...|$|R
40|$|Background: Treatment failure (TF) and adverse drug {{reactions}} (ADRs) are {{the main}} indications for antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen change. Identification of factors influencing regimen change and subsequent health outcomes of patients after regimen change is essential in providing a sustainable and effective antiretroviral roll-out campaign. Aim: To confirm {{the factors that influence}} antiretroviral regimen change and to evaluate patient outcomes post regimen change. Methods: A retrospective chart analysis of 269 HIV-infected non-pregnant patients (age > 18 years), who underwent an antiretroviral (ARV) regimen change and were followed up for approximately one year since initiation, was undertaken at a Provincial Hospital ARV Clinic in KwaZulu-Natal, from January 2008 to December 2012. Results: Of the 269 patients, there were 200 females (75 %). Most patients were between the ages 30 and 44 (57. 6 %). Only five patients had <b>coexisting</b> tuberculosis (TB) <b>infection</b> (2 %). The most common first-line ART regimen to be changed was stavudine (D 4 T) /lamivudine(3 TC) / efavirenz(EFV)   n = 111 (41 %). The most common regimen patients were changed to was tenofovir (TDF) / 3 TC/EFV  n = 89 (33 %). Stavudine was the most commonly substituted drug (35. 5 %). Lipodystrophy was the most common ADR (56. 8 %). ADR was the indication for ART regimen change in 175 patients (65 %), whilst TF accounted for ART regimen change in 94 patients (35 %). Immunological success (CD 4 counts) was shown after regimen change (374. 21 ± 243. 16 vs. 456. 09 ± 250. 07, CI: 0. 95,  p < 0. 001). Undetectable viral loads were measured in 172 / 205 (83. 9 %) patients post regimen change. Conclusion: ADRs were the main cause for antiretroviral regimen change. Stavudine was the most substituted drug with lipodystrophy being the most common side effect. <b>Coexisting</b> TB <b>infection</b> did not influence regimen change. Immunological and virological success was shown after regimen modification...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Patients {{with chronic}} obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) constitute a potentially susceptible group towards environmental exposures such as livestock farm emissions, given their compromised respiratory health status. The primary {{aim of this}} study was to examine the association between livestock exposure and comorbidities and <b>coexisting</b> symptoms and <b>infections</b> in COPD patients. Methods: Data were collected from 1828 COPD patients (without co-occurring asthma) registered in 23 general practices and living in a rural area with a high livestock density. Prevalence of comorbid diseases/disorders and coexisting symptoms/infections were based on electronic health records from the year 2012. Various indicators of individual exposure to livestock were estimated based on residential addresses, using a geographic information system. Results: At least one comorbid disorder was present in 69 % of the COPD patients (especially cardiac disorders and depression, while 49 % had at least one <b>coexisting</b> symptom and/or <b>infection</b> (especially upper respiratory tract infections, respiratory symptoms and pneumonia). Half of the COPD-patients resided less than 500 m of the nearest farm. Some positive as well as inverse associations were found between the examined outcomes and exposure estimates, although not consistent. Conclusions: Despite the high prevalence of coexisting chronic and acute conditions presented in primary care by in COPD patients, this investigation found no convincing evidence for an association with livestock exposure estimates. There is a need for a replication of the present findings in studies with a longitudinal design, on different groups of potentially susceptible patients. Future research should also elucidate the biological plausibility of possible protective effects of exposure. (aut. ref. ...|$|R
40|$|During 1984, 35 {{patients}} undergoing continuous {{peritoneal dialysis}} experienced 77 cases of peritonitis with 55 cases (71. 4 %) related to staphylococci. Coagulase-negative staphylococci were isolated in 41 cases, while Staphylococcus aureus {{was found in}} 14. A <b>coexisting</b> tunnel <b>infection</b> was more often associated with S. aureus (7 / 14) than with coagulase-negative staphylococci (2 / 41) (P less than 0. 01). Likewise, eradication of the infection necessitated catheter removal more frequently with S. aureus (5 / 14) than with coagulase-negative staphylococci (2 / 41) (P less than 0. 01). Of the 41 coagulase-negative staphylococci, 35 were characterized as to species, adherence, and production of two exopolysaccharides. Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most frequent coagulase-negative species (29 / 35). Peritonitis cases caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci that lacked adherence and exopolysaccharides were more frequently associated with complications (4 / 6) than were those organisms with either or both properties of adherence or exopolysaccharide production (5 / 29). There were no appreciable differences in antibiotic susceptibilities. Staphylococcal peritonitis remains a significant cause of morbidity in continuous peritoneal dialysis patients. The incidence of complications was not directly linked to staphylococcal properties of adherence or exopolysaccharide production...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{human body}} plays host {{to a wide}} variety of microbes, {{commensal}} and pathogenic. In addition to interacting with their host, different microbes, such as bacteria and viruses, interact with each other, sometimes in ways that exacerbate disease. In particular, gene expression of a number of viruses, including Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), is known to be regulated by epigenetic modifications induced by bacte-ria. These viruses establish latent infection in their host cells and can be reactivated by bacterial products. Viral reactivation has been suggested to contribute to periodontal disease and AIDS. In addition, bacterium-virus interactions may play a role in can-cers, such as Kaposi’s sarcoma, gastric cancer, and head and neck cancer. It is important to consider the effects of <b>coexisting</b> bac-terial <b>infections</b> when studying viral diseases in vivo. Epigenetics refers to biochemical modifications of chromatinthat do not change the sequence but regulate gene expression and may be inherited. Several different types of epigenetic modi-fications exist, such as DNA methylation, histone modification, and nucleosome positioning, and they can regulate a variety of processes, including transcription and protein binding to DNA. DNAmethylation occurs mostly in regions containing a high fre-quency of CpG dinucleotides, called CpG islands. In most cases...|$|R
40|$|In a {{controlled}} clinical trial, Tanzanian schoolchildren with urinary schistosomiasis, {{many of whom}} had <b>coexisting</b> hookworm <b>infection,</b> were randomly allocated to one of three groups that were treated with doses of 7. 5, 10. 0, and 12. 5 mg per kg of body weight, respectively, of metrifonate, orally, up to 3 times at 14 -day intervals. No serious side effects were observed during or after the administration of single or repeated doses. A few hours after medication, plasma cholinesterase was almost completely inhibited, regardless of the dose given, while erythrocyte cholinesterase was almost completely inhibited, regardless of the dose given, while erythrocyte cholinesterase was inhibited down to 40 - 60 % of the pretreatment level, depending on the dose. Plasma cholinesterase was inhibited {{to a greater extent than}} erythrocyte cholinesterase but showed a more rapid recovery of activity. A moderate accumulation of unreactivated erythrocyte cholinesterase occurred at all dose levels with this regime. Four weeks after the last dose of drug, plasma cholinesterase activity was nearly normal in all the treated children. Erythrocyte cholinesterase activity returned to normal 8 - 15 weeks after the last dose. The therapeutic results confirmed the efficacy of metrifonate against Schistosoma haematobium. There was an additional though less striking effect against hookworm...|$|R
40|$|Although the {{clinical}} correlates of the reference antifungal susceptibility test results in hematogenous and deep-seated Candida infection are still controversial, we evaluated {{the clinical}} correlates of this test in deep-seated Candida infections in non-AIDS patients. Thirty-two non-AIDS patients with hematogenous or deep-seated Candida infections {{were treated with}} intravenous fluconazole (400 mg a day), and the clinical outcomes were evaluated. <b>Coexisting</b> bacterial <b>infections</b> were treated with appropriate antibiotics, superinfection or reinfection was excluded, inadequate fluconazole therapy was avoided, and essential surgical intervention was performed. The MICs of fluconazole for these 32 Candida isolates were determined according to the M 27 -A procedure approved by the National Committee on Clinical Laboratory Standards. MICs were interpreted as susceptible (≤ 8 μg/ml), dose-dependent susceptible (16 to 32 μg/ml), and resistant (≥ 64 μg/ml) according to the criteria of the M 27 -A standard. The success rates were 79 % (19 of 24; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 59 to 93 %) in the susceptible category, 66 % (4 of 6; 95 % CI, 19 to 95 %) in the dose-dependent susceptible category, and 0 % (0 of 2; 95 % CI, 0 to 84 %) in the resistant category.

40|$|The great {{advances}} {{which have}} been made in recent years in the treatment of gonorrhea infections would appear to have provided the medical profession with adequate therapeutic agents for this disease. The numerous advantages of penicillin treatment have resulted in its replacing the sulfonamide drugs, except in selected cases (1). Even the disadvantages of parenteral injections of penicillin have been avoided by a number of workers who have administered the antibiotic by mouth (1). Indeed, Campbell, Dougherty and Curtis reported on the oral use of penicillin in the prophylaxis of gonorrhea at an earlier session of this Symposium (2). Despite the fact that penicillin has many attributes of an ideal drug for the treatment of gonorrhea, it has one distinct drawback, i. e., its suppressive effect on a <b>coexisting</b> syphilitic <b>infection.</b> This problem of the possible masking of syphilis by treating acute gonorrhea patients with-amounts of penicillin which are adequate for the bacterial infection but inadequate for the spirochetal infection is of tremendous importance (1, 3). Therefore, the search must continue for a drug with the activity of penicillin against the gonococcus but without its marked anti-spirochetal action. This report is a progress note which presents certain preliminary data suggesting that chloramphenicol, or Chloromycetin, 2 approaches penicillin in its efficacy in the treatment of acute gonorrheal urethritis in the male and that this new drug is distinctly less spirocheticidal than penicillin...|$|R
