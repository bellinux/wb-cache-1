40|$|Background and Objectives: Evaluation of {{the quality}} of {{services}} and provided cares through comparing them with existing standards in order to identify and prioritize problems and trying to fix them are important steps in the audit of clinical functions.  This study aimed {{to improve the quality of}} performance of medical records registrations about patients admitted to hospital Shahid Madani and deals with the audit of records listed them. Material and Methods: To perform this study, data were collected using researcher checklist.  Target data of 30  medical records were gathered.  We used software package of Mini Tab and SPSS to develop process statistical control charts and for statistical analysis of data, respectively. Results: By plotting control charts, we determined three specific reasons in the ADMISSION AND DISCHARGE SUMMARY SHEET, four specific reasons in the SUMMARY SHEET, and three specific reasons in CONSULTATION REQUEST SHEET.  The lack of the standard form (on-delivered copies of a summary form)  “with 90 %”, lack of the main form in patient's clinical record “with 83. 3 %”, lack of the patient's procedure “with 73. 3 %”are ranked as the most defects in SUMMARY SHEET.  In the CONSULTATION REQUEST SHEET, failure to comply with doctor's stamp and signature standard with “ 20 %” has highest percentage of defects. In the ADMISSION AND DISCHARGE SUMMARY SHEET nonconformity of standard records, patient's duration of stay “ 100 %”, coding of diseases based on ICD" 100 %", recording of patient number based on signs and symptoms " 93. 3 %", usingthe abbreviations to record the recognitions " 93. 3 %" have highest percentage of defects respectively. Conclusion: Based on the results of this study and noting that studied standards of process statistical control charts are in the range of control, the quality of standards and the documentations of  the records in the studied hospital and therefore <b>clinical</b> <b>documentations</b> of  the records for Shahid Madani hospital are relatively acceptable...|$|R
