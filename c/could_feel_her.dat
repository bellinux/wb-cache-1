You pass away from the moment into the infinite, where there are no moments and where there’s no time. Here in an embodied state, the body, like all physical things, participates in entropy and all the other artifacts of time. There’s a thin but nevertheless impermeable membrane between the chronological and the timeless that has become much more real to me since my lover died a year ago. Even though I feel her soul, the absence of her body feels like an enormous barrier. The absence of the spoken word, the absence of the sound of her voice, or the touch of her skin. All the things that only can be done by souls with bodies on them... But you know the only time that I feel in contact with her, really, is when her spirit temporarily borrows someone else’s body to dance. Like the moment that you and I were dancing up in your apartment a few months ago. And suddenly she was in you and I <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> there. You quit dancing the way you danced and started dancing the way she danced. And it was almost like a practical joke that she was playing in a way." ...|$|E
60|$|She came to him, and in {{his arms}} he <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> trembling.|$|E
6000|$|... “Well,” said Nettie with {{a little}} smile, though she <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> heart beating, “I feel more like a torpedo than ever just now.” ...|$|E
6000|$|He <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> through <b>her</b> veil the {{surprise}} {{with which she}} turned to him: [...] "You said, whenever we are in doubt, we must act unselfishly." ...|$|R
60|$|He was {{suddenly}} intensely moved. He {{was filled with}} the warmth of her. In the glow he <b>could</b> almost <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> as if she were present--her arms, her shoulders, her bosom, see them, feel them, almost contain them.|$|R
5000|$|In May 1876 she <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> that <b>her</b> {{health was}} slowly declining {{and that her}} end was near. She remarked to her confessor: [...] "Be it done the holy will of God". She died on 11 June 1876.|$|R
60|$|Already {{they were}} closing round him, and he <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> breath upon his cheek, when the charm broke, and he {{wrenched}} himself free.|$|E
60|$|She <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> last {{strength}} going, and {{the barrel}} resisted her. Hans hurried to her, and the barrel went {{out from under}} Michael Dennin.|$|E
60|$|And for {{a minute}} {{it was his turn}} to study her. And study her he did, till she <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> cheeks {{flushing}} under his gaze.|$|E
6000|$|Magdalen <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> secure that <b>her</b> {{old friend}} would be near kind people; and {{presently}} Mrs. Best, {{returning to the}} actual neighbourhood, observed - ...|$|R
60|$|It seemed she {{scarcely}} saw {{her class}} the next day. She <b>could</b> only <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> will, {{and what she}} would have of this class which she must grasp into subjection. It was no good, any more, to appeal, to play upon the better feelings of the class. Her swift-working soul realized this.|$|R
60|$|Then all the {{strength}} seemed {{to leave the}} girl. Moving shakily, with her hand on Eveline Annersly's arm, she turned towards the house, as the pearly greyness crept into the eastern sky. Eveline Annersly said nothing, for she <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> that <b>her</b> companion was trembling, and hear her catch her breath. Carrie stopped {{when they reached the}} homestead, and looked eastward with tear-dimmed eyes.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Charmond embraced Grace {{more and}} more tightly, and the younger woman <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> neighbor's breathings grow deeper and more spasmodic, as though {{uncontrollable}} feelings were germinating.|$|E
60|$|I did {{not look}} at her, but I <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> standing, {{watching}} me. If I had looked up, she would, I knew, have held out her arms to me....|$|E
6000|$|They {{crouched}} {{so close}} to each other that he <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> furs against him. Neither had spoken since they left the roadway till she said, with attempted unconcern: 'This is unfortunate.' ...|$|E
60|$|And all {{the while}} we sweltered in the terrible heat, for the sun pierced through the deck {{planking}} of the vessel, and I <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> by <b>her</b> lack of motion that we were becalmed and drifting. I stood up, and by resting my heels upon a rib {{of the ship and}} my back against her side, I found myself in a position whence I could see the feet of the passers-by on the deck above.|$|R
60|$|He {{turned back}} {{the way he had}} come, the rhythm of the engine {{pounding}} in his ears. He began to doubt the reality of what memory told him. He halted under a tree and allowed the rhythm to die away. He <b>could</b> not <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> near him in the darkness nor her voice touch his ear. He waited for some minutes listening. He could hear nothing: the night was perfectly silent. He listened again: perfectly silent. He felt that he was alone.|$|R
60|$|For a week Columbine rolled about, {{and then}} one morning faint blue lines ran across the sea to the north. Gasping and {{sweating}} with the effort, they hoisted sail and sent up the biggest topsail drenched with salt water. Sometimes it and the light balloon jib filled and although the lower canvas would not draw, Columbine began to move. One <b>could</b> not <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> progress, there was no strain on the helm, but silky ripples left her side and slowly trailed astern.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh yes!" [...] she said, and {{the little}} hand pressed his arm once more very eagerly, and the girl clung to him so that he <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> heart beating on his shoulder.|$|E
6000|$|... "The Ouled-Nail of Sisi Aissa," [...] {{came the}} answer. While she spoke Tarzan <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> working about his bonds. Occasionally the cold steel {{of a knife}} touched his flesh. A moment later he was free.|$|E
60|$|She <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> antagonist's arm {{within her}} grasp even now--the very {{flesh and bone}} of it, as it seemed. She looked on the floor whither she had whirled the spectre, {{but there was nothing}} to be seen.|$|E
6000|$|I can't say I {{felt sorry}} for Freya. She was {{not the sort of}} girl to take {{anything}} tragically. One <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> for <b>her</b> and sympathise with her difficulty, but she seemed equal to any situation. It was rather admiration she extorted by her competent serenity. It was only when Jasper and Heemskirk were together at the bungalow, as it happened now and then, that she felt the strain, and even then it was not for everybody to see. My eyes alone could detect a faint shadow on the radiance of her personality. Once I could not help saying to her appreciatively: ...|$|R
50|$|She is courted by Ignacio, {{a wealthy}} man in society with whom she is not in love. Her fellow socialites, who see {{marriage}} as a business arrangement, urge her to not let Ignacio get away. In reply, Camila bursts into tears as she describes her longing to marry for love and for a husband she <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> proud of. <b>Her</b> socialite friends are stunned.|$|R
60|$|The Carbonels <b>could</b> only <b>feel</b> that <b>her</b> {{remnant of}} {{life had been}} {{shortened}} by all she had undergone for their sakes, and Edmund and Sophy both stood as mourners at her grave, Sophy feeling that her life had been more of a deepening, realising lesson than anything that had gone before, making <b>her</b> <b>feel</b> more than had ever come yet into her experience, what this life is compared with eternal life.|$|R
60|$|I {{breathed a}} sigh of relief, and so did Victory. I <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> body quiver as she lay pressed close to me, our cheeks almost {{touching}} as we both peered through the same small opening in the foliage.|$|E
60|$|She {{took his}} arm; he <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> heart {{throbbing}} against it. Kindly silent, {{he led her}} back to the open space. Some garden chairs were placed here and there; he suggested that she should rest for a while.|$|E
6000|$|... "I love you!" [...] She {{was resting}} {{perfectly}} quiet against him, while her heart ceased gradually to beat so fast. He <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> cheek rubbing against his coat of Harris tweed. Suddenly she sniffed at it, and whispered: ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{wondered}} what my double {{there in the}} sail locker thought of this commotion. He was able to hear everything--and perhaps {{he was able to}} understand why, on my conscience, it had to be thus close--no less. My first order [...] "Hard alee!" [...] re-echoed ominously under the towering shadow of Koh-ring as if I had shouted in a mountain gorge. And then I watched the land intently. In that smooth water and light wind it was impossible to feel the ship coming-to. No! I <b>could</b> not <b>feel</b> <b>her.</b> And my second self was making now ready to ship out and lower himself overboard. Perhaps he was gone already...? ...|$|R
6000|$|Isabel's {{confidence}} in him, however, {{was greater than}} any he <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> in <b>her.</b> Not that he thought her capable of committing an atrocity; but, turn it over as he would, there was something ominous {{in the way she}} reserved her option. As she took his hand she felt a great respect for him; she knew how much he cared for her and she thought him magnanimous. They stood so for a moment, looking at each other, united by a hand-clasp which was not merely passive on her side. [...] "That's right," [...] she said very kindly, almost tenderly. [...] "You'll lose nothing by being a reasonable man." ...|$|R
50|$|Dam's {{performance}} {{in this film}} received a lukewarm response. The Times of India in its review:Paoli Dam doesn't disappoint one bit on the latter aspect, she is not bad {{in terms of her}} acting abilities either. She doesn't incite the pathos that one <b>could</b> fervently <b>feel</b> for <b>her</b> character's plight. But though her act is not accomplished, she manages to pull off her role quite well.|$|R
6000|$|He {{must have}} drifted into a dream--and an extravagant one--for he was master of Charleroi and Adèle was his wife. She {{was coming out}} to him now; {{he could hear her}} steps; he <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> hand upon his shoulder-- ...|$|E
60|$|Washington wriggled uneasily. Unable {{to endure}} the {{piercing}} stare of his mother, he had withdrawn to the window, and was looking out with his back turned. But even there he <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> eyes {{on the back of}} his neck.|$|E
6000|$|Then Mary <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> heart-blood curdle cold! [...] Again {{the rough}} wind hurried by,-- It blew off the hat of the one, and behold Even {{close to the}} feet of poor Mary it roll'd,-- [...] She felt, and {{expected}} to die.|$|E
6000|$|She uttered {{all this}} {{much as a}} man would have done, with steady voice and with bright eyes, but Lee Virginia <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> beneath <b>her</b> harsh inflections the deep emotion which vibrated there, and her heart went out toward the lonely woman in a new rush of tenderness. Now that she was {{released}} from the necessity of excusing her mother's faults--faults she could now ignore; now that she could look upon her as a loyal friend, she was moved to pity and to love, and, rising, she went to her and put her arm about her neck, and said: [...] "This won't make any difference. I am going to stay with you and help you just the same." ...|$|R
60|$|Meantime Rachel was {{constantly}} thrown with Mr. Clare, supplying Alick's place to him, {{and living in}} a round of duties that suited her well, details of parish work, walking with, writing for, and reading to Mr Clare, and reaping much benefit from intercourse with such a mind. Many of her errors had chiefly arisen from the want of some one whose superiority she <b>could</b> <b>feel,</b> and <b>her</b> old presumptions withered up to nothing when she measured her own powers with those of a highly educated man, while all the time he gave her thanks and credit for all she had effected, but such as taught her humility by very force of infection.|$|R
5|$|Too weak {{to stand}} or walk, Beauchamp was loaded onto a cart to be {{conveyed}} to the gallows. He begged to see Anna, but the guards {{told him she}} was not seriously injured. The guards finally allowed him to see Anna, and Beauchamp was angered that they had underplayed her critical condition. He stayed with her until he <b>could</b> no longer <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> pulse; then the guards took him to the gallows to be hanged before he died of his stab wounds.|$|R
