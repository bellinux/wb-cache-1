40|$|Abstract. A {{method is}} {{proposed}} for the long-term strength predictions for <b>chromium-nickel</b> austenitic <b>steels</b> based on short-term experimental tests. The experimental data consists {{of a series of}} creep diagrams for various applied stresses and temperatures, {{as well as of the}} tentative values of the failure time. The long-term strength and creep experiments are illustrated by the results for the steel 08 X 16 H 11 M 3. The metallographical studies of the samples tested in long-term strength and creep experiments are carried out. The microstructure of the deformed sample metal and the failure nature are analysed for various temperature regimes. Prevention of the creep failure for constructions exploited for a long time at extreme temperature and loading conditions is one of the actual problems of the fracture mechanics. Since carrying out the construc-tion lifetime creep experiments is expensive and almost impossible technically, then long-term strength predictions, based on short experimental tests, become especially important. The given method is based on the results of the paper [1], where general approaches to the long-term creep data analysis were developed using an entirely new description of the long-term strength diagram, lg lg lg,t D n r b...|$|R

Comparisons were made between the fatigue crack growth rate after each heat treatment regime, and a comparison between the fatigue crack growth rate in both types of steels was made. For individual heat treatment regimes, {{the possibility of the}} development of intergranular corrosion was also considered. Evaluations resulted in very favourable corrosion fatigue characteristics of the 316 L steel. After application of solution and stabilizing annealing at a comparable ∆K level, the fatigue crack growth rate was about one half compared to 304 L steel. After sensitization annealing of 316 L steel, compared to stabilizing annealing, the increase of crack growth rate during corrosion fatigue was slightly higher.

The primary purpose of the experiments was to demonstrate the thermal neutron absorbing capability of the materials at specific gadolinium and boron dopant levels. The Ni-Cr-Mo-Gd alloy is envisioned to be deployed for criticality control of highly enriched U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) -owned spent nuclear fuel (SNF). For these transmission experiments, test samples were fabricated with 0. 0, 1. 58 and 2. 1 wt% natural gadolinium dispersed in a Ni-Cr-Mo base alloy and 1. 16 wt% boron in stainless steel. The transmission experiments were successfully carried out at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE). Measured data from the neutron transmission experiments were compared to calculated results derived from a simple exponential transmission formula using total neutron cross sections. Excellent agreement between the measured and calculated results demonstrated the expected strong thermal absorption capability of the gadolinium and boron elements and in addition, verified the measured elemental composition of the Ni-Cr-Mo-Gd alloy and borated stainless steel test samples. The good agreement also indirectly confirmed that the size and distribution of the gadolinium in both the hot-top (as-cast) and Ni-Cr-Mo-Gd converted to plate was not a discriminator related to neutron absorption. Moreover, the Evaluated Nuclear Data File (ENDF VII) total neutron cross section data were accurate...|$|R

Two typical infrared thermograph systems, the AGA 782 short-wavelength system and the VARIOSCAN 3021 long-wavelength system, were employed to demonstrate the availability of the IRTIT measurement.

40|$|Purpose: The paper {{describes}} the phenomena {{connected with the}} sealing for water hydraulic systems. Design/methodology/approach: For the durability tests two types of sealings, made of three polymeric materials recommended for use in water hydraulics systems have been used. In all investigation arrangements the same guide elements have been used. The tests have been performed maintaining water pressure on the sealing {{at a level of}} p = 8 ± 1 MPa and the average speed of the piston rod of v ≈ 0. 35 m/sec. Water temperature during investigations was regulated within the range of Tmin = 291 K and Tmax = 305 K. The leakage was distributed to the measurement hoses with the internal diameter of 5 mm. For the investigations, the working piston rod with ø 45 f 7 with the following parameters has been used: Material: <b>chromium-nickel</b> <b>steel</b> AISI 431 (Cr= 16. 7 %, Ni= 2. 08 %) covered with hard chromium plating of ≥ 20 μm, micro-cracks number ≤ 5 000 /mm 2, Ra = 0. 07 μm. Findings: Weibull method, thanks to its multifunctionality, helps to select elements for certain applications (required long failure-free mileages → high characteristic durability – sealings series 30413). Equipment which works sporadically → low characteristic durability but e. g. lower weight and sizes of sealing element – sealing series 30412. Practical implications: Within the confines of the given research concerning an optimal choice of piston rod sealing for water hydraulic systems, large dependence of the sealing durability on the properly chosen guide elements of the piston rod has been found. In extreme cases the durability changed even a few times. Originality/value: The Weibull method has been applied for assessment of durability and reliability of mechanical parts. A computer program has been used to compare two types of piston rod seals used in water hydraulic power systems. Durability limits have been estimated even though discontinued measurement data were used...|$|E
40|$|Austenitic <b>chromium-nickel</b> <b>steel</b> EK- 164 is the {{promising}} material for manufacturing claddings of fuel pins of fast nuclear reactors. Physical and chemical compatibility with typical nuclear fuel compositions {{on the basis}} of uranium dioxide pellets is an important aspect of ensuring fuel cladding operability. Post-irradiation examination of irradiated combined fuel assembly with maximum burnup 9. 1 % FIMA and damaging dose of 77. 3 dpa equipped with fuel pins with claddings made of CHS- 68 and EK- 164 steels in cold-worked state was performed. Gamma-scanning, electric potential resistometry and optical metallography methods were applied in the examination. According to the gamma-scanning and resistometry data high-temperature sections of fuel pins are the potential centers of development of fuel pin cladding corrosion. Comparative analysis of internal corrosion of fuel pin claddings made of EK- 164 and CHS- 68 steels along the reactor core height was performed. In the section with maximum power density at operational temperatures below 540 °С depth of corrosion of CHS- 68 steel from the side of fuel did not exceed 15 µm. On similar sections of fuel pin cladding made of EK- 164 steel depth of internal corrosion amounted to 10 µm. Maximum of corrosion damage for both steel types was registered at temperatures in the range from 600 °С to 650 °С. In this case depth of corrosion damages in the form of intercrystalline and general corrosion did not exceed 20 µm. No significant differences in the corrosion mechanism between the steels were found. Local exacerbation of corrosion at the junctions between fuel pellets and in places of concentration of cesium fission fragments was detected. And contrariwise in place of narrowing residual gap between fuel and cladding, where cesium is not present, corrosion of EK- 164 steel is minimal. Maximum thinning of cladding of the investigated fuel pins with maximum burnup of 9 % FIMA amounted to not more than 5 % of the original thickness...|$|E

They are also important from the view of their economical handling. Beside that these properties serve as good and complex indicator in system of quality and reliability of cutting tools. Paper describes problems of tool wear and verification of tool lifespan. It is focused to testing of HSS grooving mills. At the beginning it brings theoretical knowledge from the field of HSS and describes advantages and disadvantages of long-term experiment. In practical part it describes the test that was used for HSS grooving cutters. Tests were realized as long-term experiments which are more accurate but more time demanding with higher consumption of material. During measuring of tool wear the cutting needs to be interrupted so we could cut in discrete intervals. Three types of HSS grooving mills were used with two jags and diameter of 6 mm. One type was coatless and two other types with coating AlTiN and AlTiSiN. As machined material there was steel STN 17 241, EN X 5 CRNi 18 - 10, that is austenitic <b>chromium-nickel</b> <b>steel</b> with very good corrosion resistance, cold plasticity and weldability. Experiment was realized on CNC machining center HAAS VF- 1 B, that is located in laboratory of Cracow Polytechnics. Published graphs show that after use of coatless HSS steels labeled as „A“ the lowest lifespan was reached, as the mills lasted in action for shortest time. After use of mills with coating AlTiN S labeled as „B“ the influence of coating was observed in achieving of double lifespan. Longest action and thus best lifespan, what can be seen on graph C, was reached after use of HSS mills with coating AlTiSiN labeled as „C“, with threefold time period in comparison to coatless „A“ mills.
