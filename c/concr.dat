First, the binding factors for sodium and {{potassium}} as determined by Taylor [Adv. Cem. Res. 1 (1987) 5 _ 16] and the corresponding distribution ratios as determined by Hong and Glasser [Cem. <b>Concr.</b> Res. 29 (1999) 1893 _ 1903; Cem. <b>Concr.</b> Res. in press] are related to each other. It follows that the sorption of sodium is practically identical, whereas for potassium Taylor [Adv. Cem. Res. 1 (1987) 5 _ 16] predicts a substantial lower degree of sorption. The concept of alkali release, pore solution decrease and sorption by formed C_S_H, is incorporated in the NIST hydration model (CEMHYD 3 D). Subsequently, the model is compared with OPC hydration experiments reported by Larbi et al. [Cem. <b>Concr.</b> Res. 20 (1990) 506 _ 516]. Good agreement is obtained when the distribution ratios of Hong and Glasser [Cem. <b>Concr.</b> Res. 29 (1999) 1893 _ 1903] are applied.

This paper, which reports on part of a 3 -year research project into wet-process sprayed mortars and concretes for repair, investigates the hardened performance of wet-process sprayed fine concretes. It follows on from an earlier paper by the authors on the performance of hardened wet-process sprayed mortars and some comparisons with these are made here (Austin SA, Robins PJ, Goodier CI (2000). Magz <b>Concr</b> Res 52 : 195 – 208). Work has also been completed by the authors on the pumping and rheology of the fine concrete mixes presented here (Austin SA, Goodier, CI, Robins PJ (2005). Mater Struc, RILEM 38 : 229 – 237). Nine laboratory-designed fine concretes were pumped and sprayed through a wet-process piston pump and one through a dry-process pump. The properties measured included compressive and flexural strength, tensile bond strength, hardened density, elastic modulus, sorptivity and drying and restrained shrinkage. In situ test specimens were extracted from 500 × 500 × 100 mm deep sprayed panels. Hardened property tests were also conducted on corresponding cast specimens and, where possible, on specimens that had been sprayed directly into a cube or beam mould. The compressive strengths of the cast cubes, although very similar, were usually slightly greater than the in␣situ cubes, the opposite of what was found for wet-sprayed mortars (Austin SA, Robins PJ, Goodier CI (2000). Magz <b>Concr</b> Res 52 : 195 – 208). Inconsistent results for compressive and flexural strengths obtained from spraying directly into a steel mould suggest that this method is not as reliable when using a piston pump as it is when using a low-output worm pump (Austin SA, Robins PJ, Goodier CI (2000). Magz <b>Concr</b> Res 52 : 195 – 208). The bond strength of all the mixes exceeded 2. 1 MPa at 7 days. The values for modulus of elasticity, when compared with the compressive strength, were similar to published data for this relationship. The sorptivity values showed only a slight relationship with the compressive strength. The mixes exhibited a wide range of drying shrinkage, but the data from the restrained specimens suggest an actual repair is influenced as much by ambient conditions as it is by the mix proportions...|$|E
30|$|An {{experimental}} study {{was carried out}} to evaluate fresh properties of a moderately high-strength (high-flowing) self-compacting concrete (SCC) and to investigate shear behavior and performance of deep beams made with SCC. Fresh and hardened properties of normal concrete (NC) and SCC were evaluated. The workability and compacting ability were observed based on casting time and number of surface cavities, respectively. Four-point loading tests on four deep beams (two made with SCC and two with NC) were then conducted to investigate their shear behavior and performance. Shear behavior and performance of beams having two different web reinforcements in shear were systematically investigated in terms of crack pattern, failure mode, and load–deflection response. It was found from the tests that the SCC specimen having a normal shear reinforcement condition exhibited a slightly higher load carrying capacity than the corresponding NC specimen, while the SCC specimen having congested shear reinforcement condition showed a similar load carrying capacity to the corresponding NC specimen. In addition, a comparative study between the present experimental results and theoretical results in accordance with ACI 318 (Building Code Requirements for Reinforced Concrete (ACI 318 - 89) and Commentary-ACI 318 R- 89, 1999), Hsu–Mau’s explicit method (Hsu, Cem <b>Concr</b> Compos 20 : 419 – 435, 1998; Mau and Hsu, Struct J Am <b>Concr</b> Inst 86 : 516 – 523, 1989) and strut-and-tie model suggested by Uribe and Alcocer (2002) based on ACI 318 Appendix A (2008) was carried out to assess {{the applicability of the}} aforementioned methods to predict the shear strength of SCC specimens.|$|E

Brouwers, The work of Powers and Brownyard revisited: Part 1, accepted for publication in Cem. <b>Concr.</b> Res. 34 (2004) 1697 – 1716 [2]]). Here, it will be demonstrated that their water retention data also enables the study of the molar reactions of the aluminate (C 3 A and C 4 AF) and sulphate phases. It follows that the C 4 AF most likely reacts with the C 3 S and/or C 2 S to form a Si containing hydrogarnet and portlandite. The remaining calcium silicates react to C–S–H (C 1. 7 SH 3. 2 when saturated) and CH, as proposed in Part I [H. J. H. Brouwers, The work of Powers and Brownyard revisited: Part 1, accepted for publication in Cem. <b>Concr.</b> Res. 34 (2004) 1697 – 1716 [2]]. The CS¯ seems to react exclusively with the C 3 A. In case of carbonation, both phases react to hemi-carbonate, mono-sulphate, ettringite and tetra calcium aluminate hydrate. The concept “degree of carbonation” is introduced to quantify the fraction of mono-sulphate that is carbonated. This enables the quantification of all four hydration products, which represents a principal innovation. Subsequently, using the molar reactions and known specific volumes of the crystalline hydration products, the specific volumes of non-evaporable water (νn) and gel water (νg) are determined.

40|$|When {{fracture}} {{occurs in}} a concrete dam, the crack mouth is typically exposed to water. Very often this phenomenon occurs at the dam-foundation joint and is driven also by the fluid pressure inside the crack. Since the joint is the weakest point in the structure, this evolutionary process determines the load bearing capacity of the dam. In this paper the cracked joint is analyzed through the cohesive model proposed by Cocchetti et al. [Cocchetti G, Maier G, Shen X.

Fly ash is also considered as a hazardous waste due to the probable leaching of potentially toxic substances into the surface water, ground water, and soil. The ash content of the Indian coal (30 % to 50 %) contributes to these large volumes of fly ash. This paper highlights about the behavior of concrete when fly ash and steel fiber are added in concrete. Fiber-reinforced concrete is a concrete containing fibrous material which increases its structural integrity. The addition of random fibers to concrete considerably improves its structural characteristics such as static flexural strength, impact strength, tensile strength, ductility, and flexural toughness (Qian and Stroeven, Cem. <b>Concr.</b> Res. 30 : 63 – 68, 2000).

A total of 12 notched concrete beams were tested under two different loading conditions: constant stroke control and constant crack mouth opening displacement (CMOD) control. Despite individual fracture energies {{obtained from the}} two different loading conditions showing some variation, the average fracture energy from both loading conditions was very similar. Furthermore, the results obtained {{support the idea that}} a far tail constant “A” could change the true fracture energy by up to 11  %, if it is calculated using CMOD instead of LVDT. The far tail constant “A” is determined using a least squares fit onto a straight line according to Elices et al. (Mater Struct 25 (148): 212 – 218, 1992) and RILEM report (2007). It was also observed that the selection of the end point can produce variations of the true fracture energy. The end point indicates the point in the experiment at which to stop.

40|$|Publicación en versión impresa: diciembre de 2008 This paper {{presents}} {{a model for}} the carbonation of cementitious matrixes (UR-CORE). The model is based on the principles of the “unreacted-core” systems, typical of chemical engineering processes, in which the reacted product remains in the solid as a layer of inert ash, adapted for the specific case of carbonation. Development of the model has been undertaken in three steps: 1) Establishment of the controlling step in the global carbonation rate, by using data of fractional conversion of different phases of the cementitious matrixes, obtained by the authors through neutron diffraction data experiments, and reported in [M. Castellote, C. Andrade, X. Turrillas, J. Campo, G. Cuello, Accelerated carbonation of cement pastes in situ monitored by neutron diffraction, Cem. <b>Concr.</b> Res. (2008), doi: 10. 1016 /j. cemconres. 2008. 07. 002]. 2) Then, the model has been adapted and applied to the cementitious materials using different concentrations of CO 2, with the introduction of the needed assumptions and factors. 3) Finally, the model has been validated with laboratory data at different concentrations (taken from literature) and for long term natural exposure of concretes. As a result, the model seems to be reliable enough to be applied to cementitious materials, being able to extrapolate the results from accelerated tests in any conditions to predict the rate of carbonation in natural exposure, being restricted, at present stage, to conditions with a constant relative humidity.

40|$|Experimental {{studies on}} Concrete Filled Steel Tube (CFST) columns at {{elevated}} temperatures {{have shown that}} there is signific ant slip between the steel tube and the concrete core during the heating phase. As a result, the steel and the concrete components cannot work in tandem to resist the applied axial load. These experiments are conducted on columns with no shear connectors. Most of the design codes for CFST columns require that shear connectors must be provided in the load transfer zone. This work studies {{the effects of the}} shear connectors provided in the load transfer zone on the fire resistance of CFST columns. Numerical s imulation using finite element technique is employed for modeling the column behavior. Sequentially coupled heat transfer and stress analyses of three - dimensional CFT column models were conducted in ABAQUS. The steel tube was modelled using four - node shell elements and the concrete infill was modelled using eight - node solid elements. Shear studs were modelled using truss element for heat transfer analysis and beam element for stress analysis. Relevant thermal properties of steel and concrete were taken from the Eurocode and ASCE code. The interface between steel and concrete is modeled to have zero thermal resistance for the heat transfer analysis and as a hard contact with zero bond strength for the stress analysis. The modeling approach presented in this paper was validated against the experimental data available in literature. Numerical simulation of fire behavior of square CFST columns with shear studs provided in the load transfer zone indicated that shear studs restrain the slip between steel and <b>concr</b> ete significantly and increase the fire resistance of the column...|$|E
40|$|International audienceMost failure {{models for}} strain {{softening}} materials involve non locality. Non locality finds its {{origin in the}} interaction between growing defects {{in the course of}} failure. Nearby the boundary of the solid, interactions between defects are expected to be different compared to those observed in the bulk material. On the boundary of a solid, the material response should be local according to [1]. Cracks should also modify the non local interactions and should induce some shielding effect: the interaction between two points located apart from a crack should not exist. This means also that non locality, to some extend, should depend on the state of damage in the material and, for instance, that the internal length entering in non local models should evolve in the course of failure. Capturing existing and evolving boundaries in non local model is a pending issue with various approaches. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to discuss how boundary, and emerging boundary effects can be folded into a new non local damage formulation based on integral models [2] that provides a consistent transition towards discrete cracking. The goals of the presented modified non local formulation are twofold: (1) at the boundary of the solid, non locality should vanish; (2) when a crack has formed - i. e. when a band of damage close to 1 has been created, the constitutive relations should again be local in this band. One dimensional examples illustrate the capabilities of the new model to describe progressive failure and also complete failure with a view to the estimate of crack opening [3].

40|$|Purpose -Utilization of {{industrial}} and agricultural waste products as cement replacement materials in concrete technology has been an interesting subject of research for economical. environmental, and technical reasons. Portland cement incorporating these cement replacement materials improves corrosion resistance of carbon steel. Sugar cane bagasse is considered as waste in sugar mills and dumped in open space or used as fuel for boilers. The main {{purpose of the study}} is to investigate corrosion performance of reinforcing carbon steel in bagasse ash (BA) blended cement con rete and compare it with control concrete. Design/methodology/approach -SA is prepared by burning boiler-fired ash at a controlled tempef"ture of 650 °C for 1 h and cooled. The ash is then ground to a fineness of 46,um as Pozzolanic material and blended in concrete in various cement replacement levels. The corrosion behaviour of carbon steel in BA blended concretes exposed to alternate dry-wet cycles in 3. 0 percent NaCI solution for 18 months was studied using gravimetric weight loss, linear polarization, and electrochemical impedance measurement techniques. The resistance to chloride ion penetration of SA blended <b>concr</b> tes aher 28 and 90 days and compressive strength of SA blended concrete cubes after 7, 14, 28, and 90 days curing also was evaluated. Findings -The experimental results indicated that the corrosion rate of reinforcing steel and chloride penetration were significantly reduced, and compressive strength was increased, with the incorporation of BA up to 20 percent replacement in concrete. It was observed also th t a relatively good correlation between linear polarization and impedance measurements with respect to corrosion current values on the reinforcing steel within BA blended concretes. Originality/value -SA may be considered as a better substitute than other mineral admixtures for durable concrete structures. The study fulfilled the objective of the investigation and contributes to research on corrosion protection of carbon steel in concrete...|$|E
40|$|The Oxford English Dictionary defines {{provenance}} as (i) {{the fact}} of coming from some particular source or quarter; origin, derivation. (ii) the history or pedigree {{of a work of}} art, manuscript, rare book, etc.; <b>concr.,</b> a record of the ultimate derivation and passage of an item through its various owners. In art, knowing the provenance of an artwork lends weight and authority to it while providing a context for curators and the public to understand and appreciate the work’s value. Without such a documented history, the work may be misunderstood, unappreciated, or undervalued. In computer systems, knowing the provenance of digital ob jects would provide them with greater weight, authority, and context just as it does for works of art. Specifically, if the prove- nance of digital ob jects could be determined, then users could understand how documents were produced, how simulation results were generated, and why decisions were made. Provenance is of particular importance in science, where experimental results are reused, reproduced, and verified. However, science is increasingly being done through large-scale collaborations that span multiple institutions, which makes the problem of determining the provenance of scientific results significantly harder. Current approaches to this problem are not designed specifically for multi-institutional scien- tific systems and their evolution towards greater dynamic and peer-to-peer topologies. Therefore, this thesis advocates a new approach, namely, that through the autonomous creation, scalable recording, and principled organisation of documentation of systems’ processes, the determina- tion of the provenance of results produced by complex multi-institutional scientific systems is enabled. The dissertation makes four contributions to the state of the art. First is the idea that provenance is a query performed over documentation of a system’s past process. Thus, the problem is one of how to collect and collate documentation from multiple distributed sources and organise it in a manner that enables the provenance of a digital ob ject to be determined. Second is an open, generic, shared, principled data model for documentation of processes, which enables its collation so that it provides high-quality evidence that a system’s processes occurred. Once documentation has been created, it is recorded into specialised repositories called provenance stores using a formally specified protocol, which ensures documentation has high- quality characteristics. Furthermore, patterns and techniques are given to permit the distributed deployment of provenance stores. The protocol and patterns are the third contribution. The fourth contribution is a characterisation of the use of documentation of process to answer questions related to the provenance of digital ob jects and the impact recording has on application performance. Specifically, {{in the context of a}} bioinformatics case study, it is shown that six different provenance use cases are answered given an overhead of 13 % on experiment run- time. Beyond the case study, the solution has been applied to other applications including fault tolerance in service-oriented systems, aerospace engineering, and organ transplant management.
