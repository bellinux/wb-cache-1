Milk's campaigning earned the support of the teamsters, firefighters, and construction unions. Castro Camera became the center of activity in the neighborhood. Milk would often pull people off the street to work his campaigns for him—many discovered later that they just happened to be the type of men Milk found attractive.|$|E

Glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) recruits the members to sell advertising space in the program book to raise money; when Kurt (Chris Colfer) asks his father Burt Hummel (Mike O'Malley) to purchase an ad, he instead gathers a group of businessmen to fund the musical. He then announces that he is running for congress against Sue.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the failure}} to deliver a winning season, Vanderlinden did oversee {{substantive}} improvement in the program. In 1998, the Terrapins {{were one of the}} most improved teams in defense, scoring defense, passing defense, and rushing. In 1999, Maryland allowed a conference low of 11 sacks compared with 56 in 1997. In that same period, Maryland also improved from last to first in the conference in rushing, {{due in large part to}} Heisman Trophy <b>candidate</b> <b>and</b> school career rushing leader LaMont Jordan. During Vanderlinden's tenure, Maryland also recruited several key players who were instrumental in the team's later success.|$|E
50|$|Hervé Moulin {{showed in}} 1988 that {{whenever}} {{there are at}} least 4 <b>candidates</b> <b>and</b> at least 25 voters, no resolute (single-valued) Condorcet consistent voting rule satisfies the participation criterion. However, when there are at most 3 candidates, the minimax method (with some fixed tie-breaking) satisfies both the Condorcet and the participation criterion. Similarly, when there are 4 <b>candidates</b> <b>and</b> at most 11 voters, there is a voting rule that satisfies both criteria, but no such rule exists for 4 <b>candidates</b> <b>and</b> 12 voters. Similar incompatibilities have also been proven for set-valued voting rules.|$|R

5|$|Douglas {{was up for}} {{re-election}} in 1858, and Lincoln hoped to defeat the powerful Illinois Democrat. With the former Democrat Trumbull now serving as a Republican Senator, many in the party felt that a former Whig should be nominated in 1858, and Lincoln's 1856 campaigning and willingness to support Trumbull in 1854 had earned him favor in the party. Some eastern Republicans favored the reelection of Douglas for the Senate in 1858, since he had led {{the opposition to the}} Lecompton Constitution, which would have admitted Kansas as a slave state. But many Illinois Republicans resented this eastern interference. For the first time, Illinois Republicans held a convention to agree upon a Senate <b>candidate,</b> <b>and</b> Lincoln won the party's Senate nomination with little opposition.|$|E

5|$|Following {{majority}} rule in early 1980, British Army trainers oversaw {{the integration of}} guerrilla fighters into a battalion structure overlaid on the existing Rhodesian armed forces.

This ensured a balance between the two movements in the command structure. From early 1981, this system was abandoned in favour of political appointments, and ZANLA and ZANU fighters consequently quickly formed the majority of battalion commanders in the ZNA.|$|E
