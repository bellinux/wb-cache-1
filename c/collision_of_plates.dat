This applies to the solid surface, the liquid surface (dynamic sea surface topography) and the Earth's atmosphere. For this reason, the study of the Earth's gravity field is called physical geodesy by some.|$|E

50|$|The Appalachian Mountains {{are very}} old. They started {{to form in}} the middle Ordovician period by the <b>{{collision}}</b> <b>of</b> <b>plates.</b> The collision which caused the uplift of the mountains began around 440 to 480 million years ago and ended around 230 million years ago. This range has an important role of forming the temperate rainforest in this area, because of the orographic effect. In the Last Ice Age, ice did not cover the south Appalachian Mountains. Uncovered area was a refuge for animals and plants which lived in northern area. After the ice receded, some species spread back to north, while some of them stayed in this area. This {{is one of the}} reasons why there is a high biodiversity in the temperate rainforest.|$|E
50|$|From these {{observations}} is derived {{the conclusion that}} the Earth has not been static and that great forces have been at work over long periods of time, further leading to the conclusions of the science <b>of</b> <b>plate</b> tectonics; that movement and <b>collisions</b> <b>of</b> large <b>plates</b> <b>of</b> the Earth's crust is the cause of folded strata.|$|R

5000|$|The {{legacy of}} tectonic events in East Tennessee created the mountainous physiographic {{province}} {{known as the}} Valley and Ridge (commonly known as the Great Valley of East Tennessee), within which Joppa, TN is situated. [...] The Valley and Ridge {{takes its name from}} its long ridges and valleys oriented in a northeast-southwest direction. This topography was shaped by folding and faulting that occurred during the middle Ordovician period of the Paleozoic Era by the <b>collision</b> <b>of</b> <b>plates.</b> Great force from the east, possibly from northern Africa colliding into eastern North America, rippled the landscape like a rug pushed against a wall from one side. The collision which caused the uplift of the mountains began around 440 to 480 million years ago and ended around 230 million years ago. Then erosion set in, shaping more resistant rock into ridges and cutting valleys into weaker ones. The area is dominated by dolomite and highly erodible limestone, making caves numerous. The region has great habitat diversity and supports an especially diverse fish fauna, including the Upper Clinch River, which holds one of the most diverse fish faunas in North America.|$|E
50|$|Geodesy, {{also called}} geodetics, {{deals with the}} {{measurement}} and representation of the planets of the Solar System, their gravitational fields and geodynamic phenomena (polar motion in three-dimensional, time-varying space. The science of geodesy has elements of both astrophysics and planetary sciences. The shape of the Earth is {{to a large extent}} the result of its rotation, which causes its equatorial bulge, and the competition of geologic processes such as the <b>collision</b> <b>of</b> <b>plates</b> and of vulcanism, resisted by the Earth's gravity field. These principles {{can be applied to the}} solid surface of Earth (orogeny; Few mountains are higher than 10 km, few deep sea trenches deeper than that because quite simply, a mountain as tall as, for example, 15 km, would develop so much pressure at its base, due to gravity, that the rock there would become plastic, and the mountain would slump back to a height of roughly 10 km in a geologically insignificant time. Some or all of these geologic principles can be applied to other planets besides Earth. For instance on Mars, whose surface gravity is much less, the largest volcano, Olympus Mons, is 27 km high at its peak, a height that could not be maintained on Earth. The Earth geoid is essentially the figure of the Earth abstracted from its topographic features. Therefore, the Mars geoid is essentially the figure of Mars abstracted from its topographic features. Surveying and mapping are two important fields of application of geodesy.|$|E
40|$|Orogenesis {{within the}} New England Appalachians has classically been {{regarded}} as occurring discontinuously even though the <b>collision</b> <b>of</b> <b>plates</b> driving it was essentially continuous for 200 million years from the Taconic through the Alleghanian orogenies. Structural, metamorphic, and age data obtained from the cores of porphyroblasts reveal a near continuous history of tectonism that is partitioned within and between outcrops as well as regionally. Very prolonged deformation and metamorphic histories predate the foliation parallel to bedding, and the oblique matrix foliations only reflect brief increments of the uplift path of these rocks back to the earth's surface. The matrix shows none of the structural effects of the path down into the crust. This deepening path is revealed by the sequences of foliations that developed about regionally consistent successions of foliation intersection axis trends preserved within porphyroblasts (FIAs). Indirect coupling between plates throughout the period of collision resulted in horizontal shortening accompanied by subvertical foliation development, followed by crustal instability, collapse, {{and the formation of}} subhorizontal foliation, repeated over and over until orogenesis ceased. These cycles repeat on time scales as short as 100, 000 to 500, 000 years, but because of partitioning of the deformation, only the weakest rocks preserve much of this history. Shifting directions of relative plate motion every 5 to 30 million years also results in easily deformed rocks being protected by more competent ones, with none of them seeing the total history. Furthermore, if the bulk composition is not suitable for porphyroblast growth, none of this history will be recorded. The recurring role of gravitational collapse and the variable scale of partitioning of this type of deformation is obscured by repeated reactivation of the bedding parallel foliation in multiply deformed rocks containing porphyroblasts in the New England Appalachians. It is also obscured by the lack of topographic relief relative to total crustal thickness...|$|E

40|$|An inaugural {{lecture on}} astrology in Zimbabwe. Plate {{tectonics}} has become established {{during the last}} thirty years as a coherent explanation for the major features of the Earth today. The formation of new crust at mid-ocean ridges, the movement of relatively rigid lithospheric plates over the softer underlying asthenosphere, and the <b>collision</b> <b>of</b> <b>plates</b> throwing up the Earth's major mountain ranges, are familiar concepts to many people. However, recent discoveries in the Earth sciences challenge us to a newer concept of the Earth’s evolution. These discoveries indicate that large meteorite impacts have had enormous effects on the Earth, perhaps most dramatically illustrated 65 million years ago, when an impact at Chicxulub in the Caribbean may have been responsible for mass extinctions (including the dinosaurs) on a global scale. The evidence for these catastrophic events is surprisingly enigmatic in the geological record, and {{has been the subject of}} intense scientific debate and disagreement. Some of the major types of direct evidence for meteorite impacts include the craters formed by impact, and the effects of impact on rocks, including melting, the formation of shatter cones, and a whole variety of small-scale features that are revealed under the microscope. Perhaps paradoxically, these microstructures are the most unambiguous evidence for meteorite impacts, because they formed under radically greater stresses, temperatures and strain rates than those of plate tectonic processes, and are therefore quite distinct from plate tectonic microstructures. These features of meteorite impacts on Earth are illustrated by examples from several known impact sites, including the Vredefort structure in South Africa and a possible impact structure at Highbury south of Mhangura in Zimbabwe. Large meteorite impacts on Earth have significantly augmented Earth’s mineral resources since the formation of the Earth, by creating diamonds in the ultra-high pressure conditions of impact, by providing structures that trap petroleum, and possibly by creating base metal deposits. The likely environmental consequences of impacts include a searing heat wave followed by global cooling, causing episodes of mass extinction that may occur in cycles. There is some controversial evidence for the theory that the first life on Earth itself may have been transported here on meteorites from Mars. The possibility of a major meteorite impact on Earth in the near future emphasizes the dramatic nature of these recent discoveries, which are having deep impacts in the Earth sciences, possibly even constituting a scientific revolution...|$|E
