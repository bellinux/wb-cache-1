Posidippus’ Lithikà also throws light on the debate on the first production of large cameos associated with the dynastic court, supporting arguments in favour of their dating back to the early Hellenistic period, in spite of experimental evidence...|$|R

All UCAN patients receive a written Asthma Action Plan to fortify their initial and continuous asthma education by both asthma physicians and our RTTs.

An accuracy of 65. 63 % is reported, outperforming a base- line system that uses the K-nearest neighbor classifier and has an ac- curacy of 56. 88 %. To verify the suitability of the exploited features, the same ensemble classification schema is applied on the feature set similar those employed in Audio/Visual Emotion Challenge 2011. In the latter case, an accuracy of 61. 25 % is achieved using a large set of 1582 features, as opposed to just 86 features in our case that lead to a relative improvement of 7. 15 % in accuracy...|$|R

We explore this idea {{in the context of}} bank lending to small firms, an activity that is typically thought of as relying heavily on soft information. We find that large banks are less willing than small banks to lend to informationally “difficult ” credits, such as firms that do not keep formal financial records. Moreover, controlling for the endogeneity of bank-firm matching, large banks lend at a greater distance, interact more impersonally with their borrowers, have shorter and less exclusive relationships, and do not alleviate credit constraints as effectively. All of this is consistent with small banks being better able to <b>collect</b> and <b>act</b> on soft information than large banks...|$|R

25|$|The Sugar Act of 1764 was {{the first}} tax in Grenville's program to raise a revenue in America, which was a {{modification}} of the Molasses Act of 1733. The Molasses Act had imposed a tax of 6 pence per gallon (equal to £ today) on foreign molasses imported into British colonies. The purpose of the Molasses Act was not actually to raise revenue, but instead to make foreign molasses so expensive that it effectively gave a monopoly to molasses imported from the British West Indies. It did not work; colonial merchants avoided the tax by smuggling or, more often, bribing customs officials. The Sugar Act reduced the tax to 3 pence per gallon (equal to £ today) {{in the hope that}} the lower rate would increase compliance and thus increase the amount of tax <b>collected.</b> The <b>Act</b> also taxed additional imports and included measures to make the customs service more effective.|$|R
