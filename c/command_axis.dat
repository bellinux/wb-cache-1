50|$|The Hitler Line was a German {{defensive}} line in central Italy during the Second World War. The strong {{points of the}} line were at Aquino and Piedimonte. In May 1944, the line was renamed the Senger Line, after General von Senger und Etterlin, one of the generals <b>commanding</b> <b>Axis</b> forces in the area. This was done at Hitler's insistence, in order to minimise any propaganda significance should the line be penetrated.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} we analyze {{attitude}} tracking of a quadrotor {{unmanned aerial vehicle}} by employing a recently developed feedback strategy based upon hybrid systems theory. The hybrid feedback control strategy employs a family of syn-ergistic potential functions on the special orthogonal group of order three, SO(3), that guarantees global asymptotic stability of a rigid bodies attitude to a given reference. The dynamics model employed in this paper neglects the affect of drag by exploiting the robustness properties of nominally well-posed hybrid systems. The quadrotor is modeled as a rigid body, and controls its attitude with speed of the four rotor blades. The <b>commanded</b> <b>axis</b> torques leave a degree of freedom available, and we exploit this freedom to employ a state feedback law to minimize the displacement of the airframe body in the inertial frame when determining rotor blade speed.

Hans-Jürgen von Arnim <b>commanded</b> the <b>Axis</b> forces defending Tunisia. By this time, his command was strengthened to become the 5th Panzer Army [...] Arnim chose to maintain the initiative gained when the Allies had been driven back the previous year by making spoiling attacks to keep his intentions hidden.|$|R

50|$|After the Operation Torch {{landings}} in the Vichy French {{territories of}} Morocco and Algeria (November 1942) British, American and French forces advanced east {{to engage the}} German-Italian forces in the Tunisia Campaign. By February, the Axis forces in Tunisia were joined by Rommel's forces, after their long withdrawal from El Alamein, which were re-designated the Italian First Army (under Giovanni Messe) when Rommel left to <b>command</b> the <b>Axis</b> forces to the north at the Battle of the Kasserine Pass. Despite the Axis success at Kasserine, the Allies were able to reorganise (with all forces under the unified direction of 18th Army Group commanded by General Sir Harold Alexander) and regain the initiative in April.

2500|$|Montgomery {{has been}} criticised {{for failing to}} trap the Axis armies {{and bring them to}} a decisive battle in Libya. His tactics have been seen as too {{cautious}} and slow, since he knew of the weakness of the Panzer Army and Rommel's intentions from intelligence sources and signals decrypts. It has been claimed that the defensive ability of the Afrika Korps in particular and British apprehensions of another defeat and retirement, would have been constraints on the freedom of action of any commander. Warfare in the desert {{has been described as a}} [...] "quarter-master's nightmare", given the conditions of desert warfare and the difficulties of supply. Montgomery emphasised balance, refrained from attacks until the army was ready; Eighth Army morale greatly improved under his <b>command.</b> The <b>Axis</b> forces retreated through Libya into Tunisia, eventually to be trapped, in the Tunisia Campaign, between the Anglo-American forces of the First Army to the west and the Eighth Army pursuing from the east.|$|R
25|$|During the Second World War (1939–1945), India was {{controlled}} by the United Kingdom, with the British holding territories in India including over five hundred autonomous Princely States; British India officially declared war on Nazi Germany in September 1939. The British Raj, {{as part of the}} Allied Nations, sent over two and a half million volunteer soldiers to fight under British <b>command</b> against the <b>Axis</b> powers. Additionally, several Indian Princely States provided large donations to support the Allied campaign during the War.

50|$|The {{division}} comprised both fictitious {{and real}} units. In 1941 Dudley Clarke had conducted Operation Abeam, {{to play on}} Italian fears of airborne assault, in which he created the 1st SAS Brigade. During 1941 and 1942 it formed part of Clarke's non-specific plans to deceive the <b>Axis</b> <b>command</b> as to the true size of Allied forces in the region. By the end of 1942 airborne units were training in the Middle East; one such unit, the 4th Parachute Brigade, was combined with 1st SAS to become the 4th Airborne Division.

It was erroneously believed that the offensive involved more than 100 tanks, and repeated requests were made to both the Luftwaffe and the Regia Aeronautica for {{a concerted effort to}} defeat it. Forces around Tobruk were redeployed east of the besieged city, to block any attempt at relief and to prevent the garrison from breaking out to meet the British advance. Lieutenant-Colonel Hans Cramer was sent to reinforce Kampfgruppe von Herff with a tank battalion from Panzer Regiment8 and a battery of [...] anti-aircraft guns, and additional reinforcements under General Hans-Karl Freiherr von Esebeck were despatched the following day.|$|R

The Feltre meeting had little use. Despite pleas by Ambrosio to present Italy's critical situation clearly and to ask for freedom of action to withdraw from the war, Mussolini was weak and indecisive and only asked for more German help in the defense of Italy, while Hitler made an exhausting speech in favor of fighting till the end. Moreover, Hitler gave an optimistic view of the situation and refused the sweeping Italian requests for more land and air support, mentioning technical and operative difficulties. But also, he did not heed the vehement requests of Jodl, Keitel, and Warlimont: to create an unified command in Italy under German control, to move the many Italian troops in northern Italy south (towards the regions attacked by the Allies), and to give <b>command</b> of the <b>Axis</b> forces in the theatre to General Wolfram von Richtofen.|$|R

Due to the partial blockade, Gladkov's troops had limited ammunition {{and had been}} on short rations for weeks. The attack opened at 0500hrs. on December 4, led by a Romanian cavalry and a mountain infantry division backed by German armor and aircraft. The mountain infantry gained ground in the south, {{and over the next}} two days rolled up the beachhead from this direction. On the night of December 6/7, Gladkov made the desperate decision to break out to the north towards Kerch. A group of more than 1,500 men broke clean through the enemy perimeter and began trekking north more than 17km. In the morning the beachhead was completely overrun and the Romanians took 2,294 prisoners, mostly from the 318th. Gladkov's group was too exhausted to break through to friendly lines, and gathered in a perimeter on the shoreline east of Mount Mithridat, hoping for rescue. They were soon penned in by the Romanian mountain troops and pounded by German artillery and aircraft over the next four days. Gladkov and some of his men escaped by sea, but the position was overrun on December 11, with another 820 men taken prisoner.|$|R

During this time, Løken first had his headquarters at Kroken in Salangsdalen in Troms, before it moved forward to Fossbakken in Lavangen. Løken personally <b>commanded</b> the central <b>axis</b> of the failed first Norwegian advance at Gratangen. During the attack the 6th Brigade greatly outnumbered the German defenders, with two infantry battalions with artillery support mounting a direct attack against the German positions on Lapphaugen, while another two battalions made a flank march {{to cut off the}} defenders. The frontal attack failed after Løken had hesitated in attacking and sent his units against strong German positions in a disorganized and uncoordinated manner. While the main attack failed, the flank march of the 1st Battalion, 12th Infantry Regiment was counter-attacked by the Germans, the Norwegians suffering heavy losses and being routed. After the failed initial offensive, Løken severely criticized the commander of the 1st Battalion, 12th Infantry Regiment, Major Nils Christoffer Bøckman, for having bypassed Løken's brigade command in order to receive permission to advance directly from the 6th Division, exposing his unit to counter-attack. Løken's orders to the battalion had been to under no circumstance move down into the Gratangen valley, but stay on defensible ground.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: {{to detect}} the {{occurrence}} of Horizontal Meridional Aniseikonia in patients operated of refractive surgery with LASIK. Methods and materials: a sample of 19 patients made emmetropic by LASIK intervention is compared t a sample of 20 naturally emmetropic patients in order to asses the effect that changes in corneal curvature have over the horizontal meridian of the retinal image {{taking into account that}} variations of the optical power of the eye alters the position of the Nodal Point which in turn alters the size of the retinal image. Pre-existing ametropia was not specified or taken into account. Merchan Monocular Test for Aniseikonia was used for this study (Merchán G. 2004). A computer generated vertically elongated ellipsoid increases, upon <b>command,</b> the horizontal <b>axis</b> gradually approaching a perfect circle. The patient activates the test and is asked to stop the moment he or she considers that the ellipsoid has turned into a perfect circle. At this point the software compares the horizontal to the vertical axis of the resulting figure. Any difference between the axes is shown in percentage. Ideally, the horizontal axis should be 100 % equal to the vertical axis which means that the figure is really a circle and is perceived as such by the patient, furthermore proving that no Horizontal Meridional Magnification is present in the eye under testing. The fellow eye is similarly tested and the results of the two eyes are compared. Differences above 3 % (Borish, 1975) is considered indicative of the presence of Horizontal Meridional Aniseikonia. Results: statistical analyses for both one-tail and two-tails for the Z value for difference in proportions of the two groups show that 36. 8 % in the first group (emétropes by surgery) is statiscally significant from 5 % in the second group (natural emmetropes), thus rejecting the null hypotheses. Conclusions:refractive surgery changes the corneal curvature and consequently the position of the Nodal Point all of which may cause a secondary asymptomatic low degree Horizontal Meridional Aniseikonia in approximately one third of the cases examined...|$|R
