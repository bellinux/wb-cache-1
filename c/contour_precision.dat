The {{proposed}} Axis-based Look-ahead NURBS Interpolator (ALANI) strictly confines {{the component}} acceleration and jerk at each axis during every interpolating period {{based on the}} mechanics of the machine tools, so that the acceleration and jerk at axes can not exceed the limit in order to avoid immoderate vibrations and shocks. <b>Contour</b> <b>precision</b> is also strictly guaranteed while interpolating. The interpolator can trace back and recalculate previous data if necessary after forwards calculation and verification. And the recalculation algorithm is able to choose optimized machining parameters to attain high efficiency. The introduction of ALANI and simulation experiment is present in this paper...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The contour {{accuracy}} of XY table directly driven by two linear motors {{was influenced by}} the complicated reel-time contour error model of free-form curves, uncertainty external disturbance and dynamic matching between X axis and Y axis. To establish XY table model that easily calculated and suitable for free-form curves, real-time contour error estimate method was adopted. In order to reduce uncertainty external disturbance and dynamic matching between X axis and Y axis, the iterative learning cross-coupled controller (ILCCC) was designed for current compensation on X axis and Y axis. Simulation results show that the control scheme can enhance the robustness of the system, and effectively improve the XY table of <b>contour</b> <b>precision...</b>|$|E
30|$|The define-measure-analyze-improve-control (DMAIC) {{constitutes}} a systematic procedure for achieving sustained {{improvements in the}} manufacturing process and ultimately in the end product. The DMAIC approach was employed for the quality improvement of the printed circuit boards, integrated circuit (IC) delamination, manufacturing and mechanical execution systems (Tong et al. 2004; Su et al. 2005; Hwang 2006; Gentili et al. 2006). The DMAIC approach was used for standardizing the process parameters involved {{in the manufacture of}} optical lens with good surface <b>contour</b> <b>precision</b> in the injection-molding process by Lo et al. (2009). DMAIC approach is followed in varied platforms such as for improving the process parameters and capability of solder printing process, to analyze the manufacturing lines of a brake lever at an automotive components manufacturing company, to improve the fracture resistance of TFT-LCDs and improve the process capability levels of connecting rod and crankshaft manufacturing cells and minimizing variations in food processing industry (Li et al. 2008; Chen et al. 2009; Sahay et al. 2011; Su et al. 2012; Sharma and Rao 2013, 2014; Desai et al. 2015).|$|E

40|$|Elementary {{geometrical}} shape (EGS) {{models are}} useful in radiostereometric analysis (RSA) on hip stems because tantalum markers attached to the stems can be omitted. In order to create an EGS model of a femoral stem, {{the center of the}} femoral head has to be identified. The contour of the femoral head is recommended to be used. However, the contour of the femoral head cannot be detected exclusively by computer if it is combined with a bipolar head or a metal cup. We therefore hypothesized that the contour of the outer head of bipolar hemiarthroplasty can be included in the EGS model as well as the femoral head contour. We calculated the time required for the detection of the <b>contour,</b> the <b>precision</b> of analysis and the stem micromotion at 2 years using the two different methods in the same picture set and compared the results. The detection of the bipolar head contour was 10 times faster than that of the femoral head <b>contour.</b> The <b>precision</b> for subsidence was 0. 16 mm in EGS RSA with the femoral head contour, and 0. 15 mm with the bipolar head contour (p= 0. 68). The precisions were comparable and clinically acceptable. There {{was no significant difference between}} the results of the 2 -year micromotion with the two different methods. We conclude that this new method is applicable to measure stem micromotion of hemi-arthoplasty with EGS RSA and the method facilitates the Radiostereometric analysis...|$|R
40|$|An {{algorithm}} {{to estimate}} camera motion from the progressive deformation of a tracked contour in the acquired video stream {{has been previously}} proposed. It relies {{on the fact that}} two views of a plane are related by an affinity, whose 6 parame-ters can be used to derive the 6 degrees-of-freedom of camera motion between the two views. In this paper we evaluate the accuracy of the algorithm. Monte Carlo simulations show that translations parallel to the image plane and rotations about the optical axis are better recovered than translations along this axis, which in turn are more accurate than rotations out of the plane. Concerning covariances, only the three less precise degrees-of-freedom appear to be correlated. In order to obtain means and covariances of 3 D motions quickly on a working robot system, we resort to the Unscented Transformation (UT) requiring only 13 samples per view, after validating its usage through the previous Monte Carlo simulations. Two sets of ex-periments have been performed: short-range motion recovery has been tested using a Staübli robot arm in a controlled lab setting, while the precision of the algorithm when facing long translations has been assessed by means of a vehicle-mounted camera in a factory floor. In the latter more unfavourable case, the obtained errors are around 3 %, which seems accurate enough for transferring operations.

The proof-of-concept hardware models are large in size so they will address the same basic problems associated with the design fabrication, assembly and test as the full-scale systems which were selected to be 100 meters {{at the beginning of the}} program. The hardware evaluation program consists of functional performance tests, design verification tests and analytical model verification tests. Functional testing consists of kinematic deployment, mesh management and verification of mechanical packaging efficiencies.

40|$|Abstract. As for the {{high-speed}} CNC grinding process for non-circular rotary parts {{with a large}} rate of lift change (such as camshaft of automotive engine), the acceleration of grinding wheel often has {{a direct impact on}} the <b>contour</b> grinding <b>precision</b> of the workpiece due to the large acceleration of movement between of the workpiece and the grinding wheel produced from CNC grinding interpolation. Researches show that solving this problem is an important way to improve the precision of high-speed CNC grinding for non-circular rotary parts. In this paper, a high-speed CNC grinding process control and optimization method is presented for non-circular rotary parts based on acceleration interpolation movement. The negative influence of the problem about high acceleration can be reduced effectively and the precision of high-speed CNC grinding for non-circular rotary parts can be improved greatly by the proposed method. Additionally, the simulation shows that the optimization of grinding parameters forgrinding process has a good performance. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we focus}} on {{improving}} <b>contour</b> tracking in <b>precision</b> motion control (PMC) applications {{through the use of}} Cross-Coupled Iterative Learning Control (CCILC). Initially, the relationship between individual axis errors and contour error is discussed, including insights into the different reasons for implementing CCILC versus individual axis ILC. A Norm Optimal (N. O.) framework is used to design optimal learning filters based on design objectives. The general N. O. framework is reformatted to include the contour error, as well as individual axis errors. General guidelines for tuning the different weighting matrices are presented. The weighting approach of this framework enables one to focus on individual axis or contour tracking independently. The performance benefits of N. O. CCILC versus ILC are illustrated through simulation and experimental testing on a multi-axis robotic testbed. I...|$|R
40|$|In {{practice}} of image <b>contour</b> recognition, the <b>precision</b> of shape <b>contour</b> extraction {{is affected by}} lots of factors, such as noise, shelter and parameters.

The main idea of the approach is to use complex network methodology to extract a feature vector for shape contour recognition under rotation, noise and shelter. An approximation method for Distance Threshold Determining (DTD) is presented to help modeling the complex networks. Experiments show that the proposed method and the DTD method have efficient power in shape recognition.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} contouring {{error analysis}} using various classical feedforward controllers. A circular motion {{is performed using}} an XY positioning stage with specified amplitude and velocities. This study applied single Static friction model, Generalized Maxwell Slip (GMS) model and combination of both models together with feedforward Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller. Contour error in term of quadrant glitch is measured by respective angle in each quadrant of circular motion. Due to stick slip motion during velocity reversal generate glitches near zero velocity. Root-mean-square error (RMSE) {{is calculated based on}} radial error of circular motion to show variance of errors towards average.
