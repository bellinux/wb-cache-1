5000|$|Hayakawa's second {{film for}} Famous Players-Lasky was The Cheat, {{directed}} by Cecil B. DeMille. The Cheat co-starring Fannie Ward, {{was a huge}} success, making Hayakawa a romantic idol to the female movie-going public. With his popularity, Hayakawa's salary reached to over $5,000 a week in 1915. In 1917, he built his residence, a castle-styled mansion, {{at the corner of}} Franklin Avenue and Argyle Street in Hollywood, which was a local landmark until it was demolished in 1956. Following The Cheat, Hayakawa became a top leading man for romantic dramas in the 1910s and early 1920s and then, switched to Westerns and Action films. After years of extensive typecasting at Famous Players, Hayakawa decided to form his own production company. He borrowed $1 million from William Joseph Connery, a former classmate at the University of Chicago, son of James Patrick Connery, who in turn was a former business partner of Will H. Hays of the Teapot Dome Scandal, and formed Haworth Pictures Corporation in 1918. Over the next three years, he produced 23 films and netted $2 million a year. Hayakawa <b>controlled</b> <b>content,</b> produced, starred in, directed, and contributed to the design, writing, and editing of the films which were highly influential in the American public's perception of Asians. During the height of his popularity, critics hailed Hayakawa's Zen-influenced acting style.

40|$|International audienceWe {{present a}} {{solution}} to the problem of content sharing in digital rights management (DRM) systems. Users in DRM systems purchase content from content providers and then wish to distribute it between their own devices or to other users. The goal is to allow the sharing of such content, with the control of the content provider, while ensuring that it complies with the content’s usage rules. While most of the previous studies on content sharing in DRM systems assume the existence of authorized domains, ours does not make that assumption. The solutions that we present here are based on Certified Sharing Requests which are used when devices request from the content provider authorization to share content with other devices. Our solutions enhance the usability of DRM, from both the users’ and content provider’s perspective, by supporting on-the-fly sharing, sharing and re-sharing of <b>controlled</b> <b>content,</b> and a pay-per-share business model...|$|E

This paper {{introduces}} {{and compares}} two innovative tools aimed at enhancing the collaborative {{work of the}} researchers and professionals from the West Balkan countries in the Semantic Web field. The first tool, the Alfresco system, is a version <b>controlled</b> <b>content</b> repository designed in REST architectural style and based {{on a set of}} document management and collaboration services. The Alfresco workflow engine enables organization and automation of the process activities. The second tool, the Semantic MediaWiki portal, is a semantic collaboration tool and knowledge management system that leverages the latest Semantic Web (SW) technologies and standards. By using semantic annotations, it enriches the Web contents with semantics and makes the knowledge explicit. Thus, it provides structured access to information and accurate and precise knowledge retrieval.

Single phase spinel structure with cubic symmetry, lattice parameters, crystallite size, magnetic and dielectric properties were substantiated with x-ray diffractometer, transmission electron microscope, {{vibrating sample magnetometer}} and impedance analysis, respectively. Due to interfacial polarization, dielectric behavior of all the compositions shows dispersion with increase in frequency. The dielectric data was investigated by comparing the tangent loss and electric modulus for assigning the type and mechanism of dielectric relaxation. Temperature dependent dielectric constant, tangent loss and AC conductivity increase due to thermal activation of charge carriers and drift mobility. Furthermore, room temperature weak ferromagnetic behavior is observed due to the incorporation of non-magnetic Mg ions. 8 page(s...|$|E
40|$|In {{information}} sharing networks, having a privacy pre-serving index (or PPI) {{is critically important}} for providing efficient search on access <b>controlled</b> <b>content</b> across dis-tributed providers while preserving privacy. An understud-ied problem for PPI techniques is how to provide control-lable privacy preservation, given the innate difference of privacy of the different content and providers. In this paper we present a configurable privacy preserving index, coined ǫ-PPI, which allows for quantitative privacy protection levels on fine-grained data units. We devise a new common-identity attack that breaks existing PPI’s and propose an identity-mixing protocol against the attack in ǫ-PPI. The proposed ǫ-PPI construction protocol is the first without any trusted third party and/or trust relationship between providers. We have implemented our ǫ-PPI construction protocol by using generic MPC techniques (secure multi-party computation) and optimized the performance to a practical level by minimizing the costly MPC computation part.

40|$|We {{introduce}} the novel concept of coprivacy or co-operative privacy to make privacy preservation attractive. A protocol is coprivate if {{the best option}} for a player to preserve her privacy is to help another player in preserving his privacy. Coprivacy makes an individual’s privacy preservation a goal that rationally interests other individuals: {{it is a matter}} of helping oneself by helping someone else. We formally define coprivacy in terms of Nash equilibria. We then extend the concept to: i) general coprivacy, where a helping player’s utility (i. e. interest) may include earning functionality and security in addition to privacy; ii) mixed coprivacy, where mixed strategies and mixed Nash equilibria are allowed with some restrictions; iii) correlated coprivacy, in which Nash equilibria are replaced by correlated equilibria. Coprivacy can be applied to any peer-to-peer (P 2 P) protocol. We illustrate coprivacy in P 2 P anonymous keyword search, in content privacy in social networks, in vehicular network communications and in <b>controlled</b> <b>content</b> distribution and digital oblivion enforcement...|$|E

30|$|The {{previous}} review shows that all currently available datasets consider mainly images, {{and the ones}} containing videos are not significant for video source identification; moreover, {{it is not possible}} to investigate relationships between images and videos acquired with the same sensor: this fact is a strong limitation, since 85 % of shared media are captured using smartphones, which use the same sensor to capture both images and videos. Finally, another limit in the state-of-the-art is represented by the lack of a collection of <b>controlled</b> <b>content</b> coming from social media platforms, like Facebook, YouTube, and WhatsApp; indeed, recent multimedia forensic applications would take advantage in having a large dataset containing such kind of contents: for instance, in [6], the authors address the performance of identifying the source of YouTube videos but limiting to a scenario with videos belonging to 8 webcams of the same model (Logitech Quickcam STX). Similarly, Bertini et al. [18] propose to extract the Sensor Pattern Noise from images to identify fake social media accounts, but the technique was tested on 5 mobile devices only, with 200 images each.|$|E

This paper explores how the kind of typographic differentiation used in a document influences readers’ impressions of documents. A preliminary study indicated that three patterns of typographic differentiation (high, moderate and low) might underlie participants’ impressions of magazine design. Subsequently, a set of nine magazine layouts with <b>controlled</b> <b>content</b> was purposefully developed to systematically {{examine the impact of}} high, moderate and low patterns of typographic differentiation on participants’ impressions of documents. These documents were used in a repertory grid procedure to investigate the kind of impressions readers articulate in relation to typographic presentation and whether readers are likely to formulate similar or differing impressions from high, moderate, and low patterns of typographic differentiation. The results suggest that typographic differentiation influences {{a range of}} rhetorical and experiential judgments. For example, participants described high differentiation documents as the most attention-grabbing and easy to skim-read, while they considered moderate and low differentiation documents to require deeper reading strategies. In addition, participants assumed high differentiation documents to be much more sensationalist than moderate or low differentiation documents, which they generally perceived as authoritative and credible...|$|E

The microstructure has been characterized with a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM). The phase compositions of the reaction products have been investigated with X-ray diffraction. By comparing the peak temperature of the first exothermic reaction in DSC and the phase transition temperatures in the respective binary systems, {{it has been found}} that for Al-Cu BMNP the melting of an alloy played a pivotal role for the early ignition reaction.
