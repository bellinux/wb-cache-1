According to {{the process}} feature of the <b>coke</b> <b>dry</b> <b>quenching</b> (CDQ), the factors of the {{destructive}} mechanism that influence the sequence function properties of the brick were analyzed.

40|$|We try to {{understand}} the role of technological change and diffusion of energy efficient technologies in order to explain the trend of energy intensity developments in the German steel industry. We selected six key energy efficient technologies and collected data to derive their diffusion since their introduction in Germany. Since all technologies have been applied in Germany for more than 30 years we would expect complete diffusion. We found complete diffusion only for basic oxygen furnaces and continuous casting. Newer technologies (i. e. basic oxygen furnace gas recovery, top pressure recovery turbine, <b>coke</b> <b>dry</b> <b>quenching</b> and pulverized coal injection) diffused quicker in the initial phase but then diffusion slowed down. Key improvements in energy efficiency are due to electric arc furnaces (24 %), basic oxygen furnaces (12 %), and continuous casting (6 %) between 1958 and 2012. The contribution of top pressure recovery turbines, pulverized coal injection and basic oxygen furnaces gas recovery accounts in total of about 3 %. If the selected technologies were diffused completely, the future energy consumption could be reduced by 4. 5 % compared to 2012.

30|$|For these reasons, lateral tensile {{deformation}} properties of water-swollen wood with <b>drying</b> and/or <b>quenching</b> histories were studied.

30|$|Focusing on the strength, {{the values}} of control samples were {{increased}} {{in the order of}} 0 °, 45 °, 90 °. The 45 ° angle sample with <b>drying</b> and/or <b>quenching</b> histories showed maximum strength. The strength in 90 ° angle sample was larger than that of 0 ° angle sample. In addition, between the samples with different histories, the difference of strength was not significant in the 0 ° and 90 ° angle samples. However, in the 45 ° angle sample, the strength of the samples with <b>drying</b> and/or <b>quenching</b> histories was larger than that of control. From previous studies, bending strength of water-swollen wood was decreased by giving quenching history [3]. Therefore, the results obtained in this study were differed from that of previous study. In the 45 ° angle sample with each history, the reason for the significant increase in strength was considered as follows. In 45 ° angle sample, gradient of stress–strain curve is steeper with increase in strain as shown in Fig.  3. In the deforming process, cells of early wood are especially shared like diamond shape. With increasing tensile strain, the angle between the ray tissue or the late wood layer which have higher elastic modulus than that of early wood and tensile direction is decreased. Then, these tissues become bearing larger tensile stress. Therefore, {{it can be said that}} strength was also increased because the tensile strain was increased by giving <b>drying</b> and/or <b>quenching</b> histories.|$|R

Before changing designs, or methods of operation {{we should try to}} foresee their effects and we should balance the risks to people against the risks to environment. Notwithstanding technological development, enforcement of ATEX Directives and safety management system application, explosions in the process sector still claim lives and severe economic losses. Experience shows that in the process industry high severity events frequently occur in auxiliary areas, such as transport and storage of raw materials and products. Even a consolidated process like <b>coke</b> <b>dry</b> distillation allows the opportunity of preventing environmental impact, reducing as well explosion risk connected to fugitive emissions. In this activity, two intervention lines were identified: the former deals with accident risk, i. e. the occurrence of hazardous factors that may cause the ignition of coke oven gas during work activities on pressurized gas pipelines. The latter concerns environmental risk reduction referred to the transport of raw material from the harbour temporary storage site to the final plant. Considering explosion risk in confined environment and possible evolving scenarios, a short-cut mathematical approach to the maximum allowed hazardous substance build-up is developed based on the intrinsic hazards of the released material. This framework from one side will help identifying and assessing small hazardous releases consequences in closed areas and set-up appropriate control measures. From the other side, it is adopted in connection with the design of an underground conveyor belt for coal, so as to limit fugitive emissions. In this context, the study involves an in-depth quantitative risk assessment and the planning of severe control and prevention measures suitable to mitigate explosion/fire risk, both reducing the probability and the severity of adverse consequences.

30|$|Coke is {{produced}} by heating finely crushed coal charge in air tight coke ovens. The coal charge mostly consists of blends of different coking coals {{and in some cases}} also partially briquetted charge coal. After carbonization, the coke is pushed from the ovens and quenched with water/inert gas (<b>dry</b> <b>quenching).</b> This hard and porous carbonaceous product acts mainly as a source of reductant for the reduction of iron ore, provides thermal energy and provides a permeable support for the burden materials in the blast furnace. Although coke is expensive, it is still indispensable for the production of liquid iron through Blast Furnace (BF) route. The Major functions of coke in BF are to provide heat for different endothermic reactions inside the BF and for melting of slag and metal, reducing gases required for the reduction of iron oxides, support and permeable bed during counter current flow of materials and gases in BF. Coke is the only solid material in the furnace that supports the iron bearing burden and provides a permeable bed necessary for slag and metal to pass down into the hearth and for hot gases to pass upwards in BF. Of the above mentioned three roles of BF coke, the first two can be substituted by oil, gas, plastics and non-coking coals. These are injected through tuyeres to generate heat and reducing gases. Such a substitution brings reduction in coke rates for the blast furnace (coke rate is the weight of coke required to produce one tonne of hot metal). However, there is no other satisfactory material available, which can replace, fully or partially, metallurgical coke as a permeable support of blast furnace charge materials (burden). Over the last few decades, coke quality requirements have become more stringent due to development of large capacity blast furnaces (>[*] 3500  m 3) and high pulverized coal injection (PCI)/coal dust injection (CDI) rates.|$|R

Additionally, bending elastic modulus which was decreased by giving some histories was increased with the passage of time. The reason of these results was considered as follows.

Most of rotary kilns consume energy intensively. Therefore it is desired to assess the thermal losses from the kiln surface {{and find a way}} to reduce the energy losses. This paper investigates the feasibility and potential of energy savings by painting the kiln outer surface with a low-emissivity paint. However, it must be careful to evaluate the insulation effect of the paint because good insulation will increase the metal shell temperature. Too much temperature increase could result in structural problems induced by differential thermal expansion between the shell metal and the refractory bricks. A detailed heat transfer analysis is conducted to help make a decision concerning paint selection and the potential consequence of painting the kiln surface. The results show that the thermal losses depend largely on the surface temperature. Every 25 ?C increase in the surface temperature will increase the thermal loss by approximately 17 % with the same surface emissivity at 0. 9. The paint emissivity has a significant effect on the kiln surface heat transfer. Lower emissivity paint decreases thermal losses but increases the kiln surface temperature.

Now it is principally possible to optimize the process in order to reach asymmetric hollow fibres with an open, porous inner structure and a closed thin skin, in order to combine good selectivity with high permeability...|$|R
40|$|The {{perturbation}} of fluorescence in both bovine {{and human}} serum albumin caused by chloride, iodide, acrylamide and N-bromosuccinimide was studied under various experimental conditions. Serum albumin fluorescence lifetime changes induced by pH and added solutes were also studied, both in acid solutions and in powders. In general, the two proteins behave similarly. During the N-F transitions, the fluorescence lifetimes and the fluorescences intensities {{decrease in the}} same qualitative manner. Chloride binding enhances the fluorescence intensity, but {{has little or no}} effect on the fluorescence lifetimes. Chloride enhances the human serum albumin fluorescence intensity much more than it enhances that of bovine serum albumin. Iodide and acrylamide quench both the fluorescence intensities and lifetimes. Acrylamide quenching is hardly affected by pH changes, but is sensitive to the protein concentration. In acrylamide quenching, acrylamide molecules are partitioned into the protein matrix, causing both dynamic and static quenching. Iodide quenching is sensitive to pH, with a maximum quenching at pH 4. 0. Iodide quenching decreases with increased ionic strength and with increased protein concentration. The Stern-Volmer plots obtained with iodide as the quencher are downward curving in both proteins. The downward curvature is a result of iodide binding, the main quenching mechanism. Both tryptophans in bovine serum albumin tryptophans and the single human serum albumin tryptophan are very close {{to the surface of the}} protein. The environments of the bovine serum albumin tryptophans are not very different from each other. The fluorescence lifetimes of serum albumin powders separated at pH 6. 0 are very sensitive to hydration, while the lifetimes of powders separated at pH 2. 0 are not. Acrylamide and iodide quench the fluorescence lifetimes of bovine serum albumin powders, even in the <b>driest</b> samples. <b>Quenching</b> is maximum at a hydration approximately equal to that required for monolayer coverage...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{possible}} process options {{for the production of}} advanced biofuels is the co-processing of upgraded pyrolysis oil in standard refineries. The applicability of hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) was studied as a pyrolysis oil upgrading step to allow FCC co-processing. Different HDO reaction end temperatures (230 – 340 °C) were evaluated in a 5 L autoclave, keeping the other process conditions constant (total 290 bar, 5 wt. % Ru/C catalyst), in order to find the required oil product properties necessary for successful FCC co-processing (miscibility with FCC feed and good yield structure: little gas/coke make and good boiling range liquid yields). After HDO, the upgraded pyrolysis oil underwent phase separation resulting in an aqueous phase, some gases (mainly CO 2 and CH 4), and an oil phase that was further processed in a Micro-Activity Test (MAT) reactor (simulated FCC reactor). Although the oil and aqueous phase yields remained approximately constant when the HDO reaction temperature was increased, a net transfer of organic components (probably hydrodeoxygenated sugars) from the aqueous phase to the oil phase was observed, increasing the carbon recovery in the oil product (up to 70 wt. % of the carbon in pyrolysis oil). The upgraded oils were subsequently tested in a lab scale catalytic cracking unit (MAT reactor), assessing the suitability of HDO oils to be used as FCC feed. In spite of the relatively high oxygen content (from 17 to 28 wt. %, on dry basis) and the different properties of the HDO oils, they all could be successfully dissolved in and co-processed (20 wt. %) with a Long Residue, yielding near normal FCC gasoline (44 – 46 wt. %) and Light Cycle Oil (23 – 25 wt. %) products without an excessive increase of undesired <b>coke</b> and <b>dry</b> gas, as compared to the base feed only. Near oxygenate-free bio-hydrocarbons were obtained, probably via hydrogen transfer from the Long Residue. In this way, we have demonstrated on a laboratory scale {{that it is possible to}} produce hydrocarbons from ligno-cellulosic biomass via a pyrolysis oil upgrading route. The much higher coke yields obtained from the catalytic cracking of undiluted HDO oil showed the importance of co-processing using a refinery feed as a diluent and hydrogen transfer source...|$|R
40|$|The {{article of}} record as {{published}} {{may be found}} at [URL] analysis is presented of the failed redevelopment of ex-Gaston during the 2010 PREDICT field campaign based on the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) analyses. We analyze the dynamics and kinematics of ex-Gaston to investigate the role of dry, environmental air in the failed redevelopment. The flow topology defined by the calculation of particle trajectories shows that ex-Gaston’s pouch was vulnerable to dry, environmental air on all days of observations. As early as 12 : 00 UTC 2 September 2010, a dry layer at and above 600 hPa results in {{a decrease in the}} vertical mass flux and vertical relative vorticity. These findings support the hypothesis that entrained, dry air near 600 hPa thwarted convective updraughts and vertical mass flux, which in turn led to a reduction in vorticity and a compromised pouch at these middle levels. A compromised pouch allows further intrusion of <b>dry</b> air and <b>quenching</b> of subsequent convection, therefore hindering vorticity amplification through vortex tube stretching. This study supports recent work investigating the role of dry air in moist convection during tropical cyclogenesis.
