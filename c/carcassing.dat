40|$|Abstract <b>Carcass</b> {{mass and}} <b>carcass</b> {{clothing}} are factors of potential high forensic importance. In casework, corpses differ in mass and kind or extent of clothing; hence, a question arises whether methods for post-mortem interval estimation should take these differences into account.

A total of 60 animals with <b>carcass</b> weight ranging between 4 and 8 kg were used. <b>Carcass</b> conformation, commercial joints, tissues measurements and proportions, <b>carcass</b> pH, meat colour and meat texture were evaluated. Sex had a significant effect on <b>carcass</b> composition and males had higher bone and less intermuscular fat and kidney knob and channel fat proportion than females. Males showed better <b>carcass</b> compactness {{as a result of a}} higher hot <b>carcass</b> weight (HCW) /carcass length (K) ratio. <b>Carcass</b> weight significantly affected <b>carcass</b> joint proportion. As the <b>carcass</b> weight increased there was an increase in <b>carcass</b> linear measurements, <b>carcass</b> compactness, chump and breast proportions, fat depots and tissues measurements and a decrease in leg, shoulder, fore ribs and bone proportion. Increasing <b>carcass</b> weight meat became less luminous with more vivid red colour as a result of a progressive brightness reduction and a redness increment. Consequently hue and chroma parameters went through a significant increase and decrease, respectively. A significant effect of <b>carcass</b> weight was found in longissimus dorsi muscle measurements, and muscle area increased as well the subcutaneous fat thickness. <b>Carcass</b> weight also had a significant effect on meat texture measured by Warner-Bratzler shear force, which reduced its value as <b>carcass</b> weight increased.

40|$|This thesis tests an {{approach}} to delivering affordable housing for rural Wales, through the design and development {{of a system of}} homegrown, re-engineered timber components for self build. Recent studies and policy have demonstrated an acute shortage of affordable housing in rural Wales. Consequently, the Welsh Assembly Government has committed to deliver an additional 6, 500 homes in the period 2007 - 11. However, there remains significant concern regarding the long term, sustainable delivery of affordable rural housing. This dissertation proposes a solution to this need, based on the readily available resource of homegrown softwood. Sitka Spruce has become the primary production crop of the Welsh woodlands. It is rarely used in the construction industry due to its propensity to distort and instead is utilised in low value industries, including low grade <b>carcassing</b> timber. It is proposed that through an innovative and radical approach, homegrown timber resources can offer a high quality, locally sourced and sustainable modern method of construction. In this study, a system of engineered homegrown timber components is designed, prototyped and tested as a self build construction solution for affordable housing in the diverse physical, social and economic context of rural Wales. Design led studies, including a ‘Pattern Book’ of house types, and realised prototypical constructions are used to inform and interrogate the proposed components and construction methodology. The primary objective of these investigations is to examine the applicability and appropriateness for self build construction. Finally, through the construction of a whole house prototype, a system of homegrown timber components and {{an approach}} to its assembly is proposed. Although limitations remain with this proposal, it has been possible to demonstrate that there is significant opportunity for an innovative, self build construction system using homegrown timber resources, to offer an efficient and sustainable solution for affordable housing in rural Wales...|$|E

Shot on the construction site of a new Bauhaus-themed gated community in China the piece chronicles part of a recent New Town development designed by Albert Speer Jr. Screened in reverse, Weimar Villa (Unreconstructed) depicts an endless cycle of construction and excavation. The initial documentary nature of the video soon gives way to more ambiguous readings where distinctions between the new and ancient are suspended. A series of sculptural works in concrete extend the archaeological motif of the video into the gallery. Leaning against the wall are a collection of individual flat panels of varying shapes and sizes. Their ambiguous forms, both hard-edged industrial and petrified organic, at once appear as both pre-cast construction components for some future, unspecified structure and archaeological relics of unknown origin. A further set of freestanding sculptures entitled Quasicrystal Compass consist of hollow crystalline shapes in concrete precariously supported by modernist Arne Jacobsen tubular chair legs. Rough cast from timber <b>carcassing,</b> their formal language is informed as much by late Modern ‘Brutalist’ architecture as the tradition of Chinese scholars’ rocks.

Methodology. In order to achieve research objectives, {{it is necessary to}} carry out analysis of existent rebar connection methods, determination of factors and parameter variation limits for each of the methods. Performing factor ranking by the expert evaluation method. Findings. The results of the questioning materials of 14 experts in the area of monolithic construction allowed setting the following: when choosing the rational re-bars connections, the most significant values are the factors that define the time parameters: possibility of <b>carcassing,</b> time of joining the re-bars, length of rebar cage, prior operation run time, operation time of main lifting equipment. Herewith the factors that define the rebar cage parameters have a direct relation to the work performance time, as they determine the amount of bar connections in the course of building erection over wide range. Economic factors – rebar connection cost and quality control cost – have the less value. It is obvious that in the conditions of considerable construction expenses it is advantageous for an investor to increase the rebar joining cost for the work growth rate. Structural and technological factors have the least value: origin of eccentric load transmission between re-bars, possibility of use of the thermally work-hardened re-bars of А 500 and higher grades, work category for implementation of works, necessity to use the scaffold and appurtenances for re-enforcement of constructions. The reason is analogical: a contractor is ready to go to complication of technology with the purpose of reduction of the facility erection terms. As the calculated Pearson’s matching criterion χ 2 = 47. 24 is higher than the tabular one (22. 36203), then the obtained concordance coefficient W= 0. 26 is not casual value, and that is why the obtained results make sense and can be used in further researches.

Por fim, é analisada a metodologia usual de construção de conjuntos habitacionais através de um estudo de caso e, observadas as condições de aplicação da técnica da Linha de Balanço, não exigindo mudificações muito profundas na atual ação gerencial neste tipo de obra. As conclusões esboçadas confirmam as vantagens da técnica da Linha de Balanço para estes empreendimentos e propõem a sua utilização na organização do trabalho nos canteiros repetitivos. This {{research}} work {{is dedicated to}} the presentation of a building construction programming and control technique called Line of Balance, specially suited to repetitive sites, as the ones that might be found on low-income housing. This technique is not yet known or documented in the portuguese speaking literature as to make it accessible to practioners and public authorities. This technique was originated in the manufacturing industry. The thesis discusses the rationalisation and organisation procedures needed on housing sites {{in order to make the}} application of this novel technique a succesful exercise. The thesis begins by putting forward evidence on housing demand and on houw the building industry organizes itself to produce houses in massive quantities. Available programming and control techniques such as bar charts, PERT/CPM and simulation are discussed in the light of their suitability to repetitive construction. The line of balance technique is throughly presented and discussed on its theoretical practical aspects in chapter 3 that constitutes the core of the thesis. At the end a case study where the line of balance programme of work might have been applied is discussed. The actual low-income housing site of some 800 dwellings was built using conventional bar chart, programmes of work; notwithstandingly, data gathered on the sequence of work throughout the site on the duration and precedence of activities, an the intensity and rythm of work from unit to unit leads one to conclude that line of balance would not conflict seriously with the way this site was tackled, at least for the underground and <b>carcassing</b> activities. In other words, this novel technique might be used without calling for deep modifications of the management procedures now in use on building sites of repetitive nature. The thesis concludes by pointing the advantages and disadvantages of the new programming and controlling technique as a background for further studies on its applicability on housing construction sites, since the case study demonstrated its feasibility as far as it does not go against the managerial concepts and uses of the existing programming and administrative procedures employed in this sort of sites...|$|E

40|$|<b>Carcass</b> {{classification}} is {{an essential}} part of efficient animal production, price fixing and meeting consumer demands. <b>Carcass</b> classification (or grading) is based on the description of <b>carcasses</b> by means of clearly defined characteristics that are of prime importance to the meat industry, retailers and consumers. Significant variation exists in <b>carcass</b> composition and quality due to the effects of species, age, maturity type, sex and interaction effects with animal production systems. A number of extrinsic and intrinsic factors affects <b>carcass</b> and meat quality and the purpose of <b>carcass</b> classification in South Africa is to classify <b>carcasses</b> to ensure more consistent meat quality, composition and consumer satisfaction. Although <b>carcass</b> inspection is compulsory in South Africa, <b>carcass</b> classification is not a requisite at all South African abattoirs. South Africa employed a <b>carcass</b> grading system from 1944 to 1992, which was replaced by a <b>carcass</b> classification system in 1992. <b>Carcass</b> classification differs fundamentally from <b>carcass</b> grading. In <b>carcass</b> classification there is a shift of emphasis to classifying <b>carcasses</b> in order to provide the meat industry and consumers with a choice of different types of <b>carcasses</b> in terms of <b>carcass</b> composition and physical attributes, while there is no indication of perceived quality as is provided in a grading system. In a <b>carcass</b> grading system, an indication is provided of standard, prime and superior <b>carcass</b> grades which relate to standard, prime and superior meat quality. The conceptual basis of the <b>carcass</b> classification system is therefore based on the principle that producers, retailers and consumers differ in terms of their perceptions and expectations of <b>carcass</b> and meat quality, and subsequent eating experience. More recently it has become apparent that the current classification system is being used as a grading system due to the use of preferred classes, which defeats the original purpose of a classification system. Furthermore, recent research suggests that the variation within <b>carcass</b> classification categories has increased considerably due to differences between livestock breeds and types, animal production systems and the use of modern feedstuffs and growth enhancing technologies. The purpose of this paper is to review the characteristics and goals of the current South African <b>carcass</b> classification system, grading systems in other countries and the implications for effective marketing, price fixing and consumer satisfaction based on the complex cycle from ‘farm to fork’.

In addition, considerable differences were present in pricing schedules of different pork packers suggesting that hog producers need to shop around when deciding to which packer they sell their hogs...|$|R
40|$|Processors are washing <b>carcasses</b> {{with one}} or more inside-outside bird washers (IOBW) to comply with the zero {{tolerance}} for visible feces regulation mandated by the USDA Food Safety Inspection Service. A study was conducted to determine the effect of an IOBW on total aerobic bacteria, E. coli, Campylobacter, and Salmonella recovered from uncontaminated (control), contaminated, and possibly cross contaminated broiler <b>carcasses</b> at two different IOBW water pressure settings. In each of three trials, 12 commercially processed <b>carcasses,</b> divided into two groups each containing two control <b>carcasses,</b> two <b>carcasses</b> contaminated with 0. 1 g cecal contents (inoculated with Campylobacter and Salmonella), and two <b>carcasses</b> uncontaminated and placed adjacent to contaminated birds during washing (to determine cross contamination) were prepared (n= 36). Whole <b>carcass</b> rinses were conducted on <b>carcasses</b> before contamination and washing, then again after washing. <b>Carcasses</b> were washed with an in-line commercial IOBW set at 140 birds per minute for a 5 sec dwell time and either 276 or 552 kPa (40 or 80 PSI) water pressure. Counts of total bacteria, E. coli, Campylobacter, or Salmonella were not significantly affected (P< 0. 05) by contamination with feces, by cross-contamination, or by IOBW pressure. The overall effect of washing was a slight but significant reduction in total aerobic bacteria (4. 9 to 4. 8) and E. coli (3. 2 to 3. 0) log cfu/ml rinsate. The IOBW decreased the incidence of Campylobacter from 22 / 36 positive <b>carcasses</b> (14 positive incoming <b>carcasses</b> plus 8 inoculated <b>carcasses)</b> to 1 / 36 positives, while Salmonella incidence decreased from 12 / 36 contaminated (inoculated) <b>carcasses</b> to 3 / 36 positive <b>carcasses</b> after washing. The IOBW removed <b>carcass</b> contamination to levels equivalent with uncontaminated controls without cross contaminating other <b>carcasses.</b> The incidence of Campylobacter was decreased, as was Salmonella to a lesser extent. Small reductions of bacterial numbers were noted for total bacteria and E. coli...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{material}} {{consisted of}} 112 <b>carcasses</b> of crossbred fatteners (złp x dur) and 16 purebred animals (złp). The following traits were analyzed in postslaughter evaluation: <b>carcass</b> weight (kg), mean backfat thickness (mm), {{height of the}} longissimus dorsi muscle (mm) and lean meat percentage in the <b>carcass</b> (%). Based on the determined <b>carcass</b> weight and measurements of <b>carcass</b> leanness the <b>carcasses</b> were classified in the SEUROP system. Results of postslaughter evaluation indicate relatively low <b>carcass</b> leanness. In only 10 % <b>carcasses</b> leanness exceeded 50 %, while 75 % <b>carcasses</b> fell within the range from R to O in the EUROP classification. The breed of the sire had a highly significant effect on meatiness of fatteners. Pigs sired by Duroc boars were characterized by a significantly higher meatiness, irrespectively of sex, piggery, supplier and year of birth. Backfat thickness was significantly higher {{in the group of}} crosses sired by Złotnicka Spotted boars...|$|R
40|$|The most {{accurate}} determination of beef <b>carcass</b> quality involves chemical analyses of cut or the entire <b>carcass.</b> This, however, is very costly and cumbersome. An indirect approach to <b>carcass</b> evaluation involves proxy traits. The {{objective of this}} study was to derive quantitative relationships between measured <b>carcass</b> chemical composition and indirect <b>carcass</b> traits. A meta-analysis was applied to 24 publications in cattle. The selected indirect traits were USDA yield grade, fat thickness and marbling. USDA yield grade was the best indicator of the variations of the <b>carcass</b> chemical composition. Similarly, fat thickness was also a good indicator of changes in <b>carcass</b> chemical composition. Marbling was strongly correlated with changes in protein proportion, but not with changes in fat and moisture proportions. These results show that changes in the chemical composition of the <b>carcass</b> due to dietary conditions for example can be estimated from changes in <b>carcass</b> traits...|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{based on}} males from 20 llama and 40 alpaca reared in Peru evaluated the <b>carcass</b> characteristics from animals slaughtered at 25 months of age, at a {{final body weight}} of 46. 1 kg for alpaca and 63. 2 kg for llama. Warm <b>carcass</b> weight was significantly higher in llama <b>carcasses</b> compared with alpaca, while dressing percentage was higher in alpacas. In the llama <b>carcasses,</b> leg, thorax and chops were heavier {{compared with the same}} cuts taken from the alpaca <b>carcasses</b> (P < 0. 05). In contrast, the shoulder and neck were proportionately heavier in the alpaca compared with the llama <b>carcasses.</b> Full digestive tract was the heaviest component found in the <b>carcasses.</b> In the llama <b>carcasses,</b> both full digestive tract and digestive content were significantly heavier than in the alpaca <b>carcasses.</b> Significant differences were observed in the proportion of muscle and bone in the shoulder and in the leg of the llama and alpaca <b>carcasses.</b> Llama and alpaca slaughtered at similar age showed different <b>carcass</b> characteristics; considering the results of this study, llama can be more easily bred as animal for meat production...|$|R
40|$|Composting {{livestock}} <b>carcasses</b> is {{a viable}} method for on-site treatment and disposal. Properly estimated <b>carcass</b> biodegradability is valuable for designing and controlling animal mortality composting systems. However, it is still difficult to assess the biodegradability inside composts. In this study, approximately 250 kg of swine <b>carcasses</b> were composted in each of nine 2 m X 2 m weighable composting test units using three different envelope materials: corn silage, ground cornstalks, and ground oat straw. Total weight of compost material was measured monthly to observe the <b>carcass</b> decomposition trend with composting time. The most significant weight loss occurred during the first 6 weeks of composting. Biodegradability of the swine <b>carcasses</b> was estimated by comparing the mass of <b>carcass</b> remains after 16 weeks composting with the total <b>carcass</b> weight placed in the pile {{during the time of}} construction. Based on these results the influence of envelope material type on the biodegradability of swine <b>carcasses</b> was evaluated. The <b>carcass</b> decomposition within silage test units was only 66 % of the initial <b>carcass</b> mass, while <b>carcasses</b> in cornstalk and oat straw test units decomposed 86 % and 79 % respectively...|$|R
