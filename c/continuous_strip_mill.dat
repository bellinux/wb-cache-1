50|$|At {{the end of}} the Second World War {{there was}} an {{increase}} in demand for steel products such as sheet, plate and strip due to improved living standards. As products became relatively cheap the demand grew for such items as refrigerators, canned foods and cars. SPT had a <b>Strip</b> <b>Mill,</b> which could satisfy some of this demand. It had been producing strip to a maximum width of 230mm since 1921, however the limitation in the maximum width and site restrictions prevented extension, enlargement or modernisation of the plant. A new mill was required which would cater for the increased demand, and to this end market research was carried out to determine the size and potential of the market. When the technical and commercial research was concluded, it was decided to build a <b>continuous</b> Hot <b>Strip</b> <b>Mill</b> rolling mild, carbon and special steels up to 457mm. This new mill filled the gap between the narrow and wide <b>strip</b> <b>mills</b> operating at that time.So in July 1955 it was announced that Brinsworth Hot <b>Strip</b> <b>Mill</b> would be built on Sheffield Road opposite Templeborough Melting Shop at a cost of £3.6 m. In less than two years it was built and the first slabs rolled on 10 June 1957, quite an achievement. Full capacity was expected to be 8000 tonnes per week and in 1956 there were new orders for two to three years. These orders were mainly for the motorcar, bicycle, tube and stamping industries and nearly all of them for the home market.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} new flying gauge change (FGC) scheme for a <b>continuous</b> cold <b>strip</b> <b>mill</b> to achieve {{thickness}} reduction in a specified section including a welding point. Because this section is often processed as scrap, thickness reduction is desired {{as a means}} of reducing scrap weight. However, this is not possible with conventional FGC, which considers only one thickness change point, because two thickness change points exist simultaneously in the mill due to the short length of the specified section. The proposed scheme utilizes the transition pattern of the position of the two thickness change points during FGC to calculate the set values of the roll gap and roll speed. Thickness reduction is achieved by applying these set values to the rolling mill according to the tracking signals of the two thickness change points. The validity of the proposed method was verified by simulation and experiments. Application of this technology has improved cold strip yield.

Using the {{characteristics}} of prediction model, rolling optimization and feedback correction, a AWC system based on explicit indirect predictive control was designed, and its control performance was simulated based on a hot <b>strip</b> <b>continuous</b> <b>mill.</b> The results show that explicit indirect predictive control achieves better control effects than the normal PID on response time and steady precision with matching model; when model mismatching is caused by inaccuracy of plastic coefficient and pure delay time, the normal PID is overshot or even oscillation, but the control performance of the explicit indirect predictive control is not influenced by model parameter variations[1]...|$|R

50|$|The <b>strip</b> <b>mill</b> {{was a major}} innovation, {{with the}} first being erected at Ashland, Kentucky in 1923.

40|$|Abstract — In this article, {{a robust}} hot <b>strip</b> <b>mill</b> {{steering}} control is proposed {{in order to}} guarantee the system stability and to improve its performances. The rolling process consists in crushing a metal strip between some rolls for obtaining a product with constant and desired thickness. The quality of the rolled products {{and the safety of}} the production process are linked to the lateral movement of the strip in the line. Then, the main task of the steering control consists in reducing this displacement. A hot <b>strip</b> <b>mill</b> treats products with very different characteristics. Then, the products are divided into several families, with reference to their physical characteristics, and the stabilisation problem is formulated as a convex problem. Finally, for each family, a different robust controller is designed.
