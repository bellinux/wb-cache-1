25|$|IRNSS is an {{independent}} regional navigation satellite system being developed by India. It {{is designed to provide}} accurate position information service to users in India as well as the region extending up to 1500km from its boundary, which is its primary service area. IRNSS will provide two types of services, namely, Standard Positioning Service (SPS) and Restricted Service (RS) and is expected to provide a position accuracy of better than 20m in the primary service area. It is an autonomous regional satellite navigation system being developed by Indian Space Research Organisation, which is under total control of Indian government. The requirement of such a navigation system is driven by the fact that access to Global Navigation Satellite Systems like GPS is not guaranteed in hostile situations. ISRO initially planned to launch the <b>constellation</b> <b>of</b> <b>satellites</b> between 2012 and 2014 but the project got delayed by nearly 2 years.|$|E

40|$|Small {{satellites}} {{organized as}} a constellation {{have the potential}} to offer mission capabilities comparable to traditional large satellites at a significant cost savings. In order to evaluate the viability <b>of</b> using a <b>constellation</b> <b>of</b> small <b>satellites</b> for any given mission, we investigate how system performance and cost relate to mission assurance. In this paper, we compare three satellite mission architectures to a global satellite communications reference mission. The three satellite mission architectures include (1) large <b>constellation</b> <b>of</b> low-cost small <b>satellites</b> (15 kg), (2) medium-sized <b>constellation</b> <b>of</b> medium-sized <b>satellites</b> (800 kg) and (3) small <b>constellation</b> <b>of</b> large <b>satellites</b> (3000 kg). Mission assurance is assessed for each architecture, with performance risk factors including individual satellite life expectancy, operating environment, and other external factors affecting mission performance. We also consider resiliency as it relates to a system’s ability to degrade gracefully. This aspect of resiliency is particularly relevant to a system consisting of a large number <b>of</b> small <b>satellites...</b>|$|R
