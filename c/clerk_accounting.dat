30|$|The Study 13 was {{conducted}} between 2012 and 2015 {{as part of}} a joint research project (Faist, Bilecen, Barglowski, & Sienkiewicz, 2015). The findings in this paper draw on the subsample of 17 Polish migrants in Germany residing in two medium sized cities in North-Rhine Westphalia, among whom 4 were joint interviews with heterosexual couples. Respondents were between 33 and 67  years old. They had between one and three children, mostly in either kindergarten- or primary school-age. Five of them had a university degree, and 12 had vocational training, which however was not always recognized in Germany. Those who had their degree recognized (5), worked in more skilled jobs, such as gardeners and <b>clerks,</b> <b>accounting</b> here for the lower-middle-classes. Seven who had their degrees unrecognized for various reasons, were mostly employed in precarious and low skilled occupations, such as cleaners or construction workers and are considered here as working-classes. People’s arrival times varied from recent period to more than 20  years ago.|$|R
30|$|Second, the {{application}} {{direction of the}} second factor, the nonagricultural occupation rate, {{is contrary to the}} expectation. The calculation result shows that the intermarriage rates of those ethnic groups with high proportions of nonagricultural occupations are rather low (− 0.985). For example, Koreans’ proportion of nonagricultural occupations reached 73.64 %, while the ethnic intermarriage rate was only 9.87 %. In the occupational structure of the population of Uighurs, Kazaks, Tibetans, and Koreans, the four ethnic groups with the lowest intermarriage rates, the categories of head of party institutions, professional technicians, and <b>clerks</b> <b>accounted</b> for 38.47, 43.19, 50.41, and 32.37 %, respectively, of the nonagricultural occupational population. For the Manchu, Mongolians, Yao, and Bai, the four ethnic groups with the highest intermarriages rates, the above personnel account for 31.62, 45.63, 24.63, and 30.12 %, respectively. In addition to the Yao, the rates of all the remaining ethnic groups are higher than the Han (24.81 %) (The Census Office of the State Council, and National Bureau of Statistics 2012).|$|R
5000|$|The erotic Fūryū Zashiki Hakkei {{version is}} of a cotton worker {{having sex with}} a clerk who has come to collect goods. The <b>clerk's</b> <b>account</b> book lies behind him to the right, and the print employs the same nurioke allusion to the {{mountains}} of River and Sky in Evening Snow. At the time this cotton work was understood as typically a front for women who also worked as prostitutes. Outside the shōji in the background appear the head and forelegs of a white dog whose arched posture suggest a female in mid-copulation. Harunobu employs a range of contrasts—white cloth on black nurioke, public work and private, male and female—from which Hayakawa surmises the unseen male dog must be black, stating that such calling forth of the imagination was one of the pleasures of mitate for contemporary viewers. Harunobu appears to have appropriated the positioning and gestures of the copulating figures from the ninth page of Sukenobu's [...] of 1722 for the Fūryū Zashiki Hakkei.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{looks at}} how some {{selected}} classical Pentecostal churches 50 in the Ashanti Region of Ghana could be proactive in managing their funds generated from their offerings above reproach 51. This {{has been done}} using both primary and secondary sources. With respect to the primary sources, the purposive sampling and the lottery system were used. Whiles the first method was used to sample the church leaders for interview, the other was used to sample a total of one hundred and seventy-one respondents from the congregations of churches 1, 2 and 3. Besides the researcher made several visits to these churches to observe most of their activities. It came to light that these churches have a lay down routine procedures that {{have been put in}} place to help their <b>accounts</b> <b>clerks</b> to prudently manage their funds. In spite of these routine procedures, the <b>accounts</b> <b>clerks</b> are not leaving above reproach and this is due to some challenges confronting these selected churches with respect to the management of their offerings. However, this issue can be minimized or perhaps over-come when the churches appoint qualified <b>accounts</b> <b>clerks</b> as full-time employees. The churches also need to go further by providing adequate office spaces equipped with the necessary machinery that would enable their <b>accounts</b> <b>clerks</b> to operate efficiently and effectively. 1...|$|R
