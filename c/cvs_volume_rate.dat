40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is compromised by involuntary motion (e. g. respiration, cardiac activity). The feasibility of processing ultrasound echo data to automatically estimate 3 D liver motion for real-time IMRT guidance was previously demonstrated, but performance was limited by an acquisition speed of 2 volumes per second due to hardware restrictions of a mechanical linear array probe. Utilizing a 2 D matrix array probe with parallel receive beamforming offered increased acquisition speeds {{and an opportunity}} to investigate the benefits of higher <b>volume</b> <b>rates.</b> In vivo livers of three volunteers were scanned with and without respiratory motion at <b>volume</b> <b>rates</b> of 24 and 48 Hz, respectively. Respiration was suspended via voluntary breath hold. Correlation-based, phase-sensitive 3 D speckle tracking was applied to consecutively acquired volumes of echo data. Volumes were omitted at fixed intervals and 3 D speckle tracking was re-applied to study the effect of lower scan rates. Results revealed periodic motion that corresponded with the heart rate or breathing cycle in the absence or presence of respiration, respectively. For cardiac-induced motion, <b>volume</b> <b>rates</b> for adequate tracking ranged from 8 to 12 Hz and was limited by frequency discrepancies between tracking estimates from higher and lower frequency scan rates. Thus, the scan <b>rate</b> of <b>volume</b> data acquired without respiration was limited by the need to sample the frequency induced by the beating heart. In respiratory-dominated motion, <b>volume</b> <b>rate</b> limits ranged from 4 to 12 Hz, interpretable from the root-mean-squared deviation (RMSD) from tracking estimates at 24 Hz.

The displacement strokes and profiles as a function of amplifier and frequency of electric field have been characterized. The <b>volume</b> stroke <b>rates</b> (<b>volume</b> <b>rate)</b> as function of electric field, driving frequency have been theoretically evaluated, too. The PAMPD exhibits high <b>volume</b> <b>rate.</b> It is easily tuned with varying of either amplitude or frequency of the applied electric field. In addition, the performance of the diaphragms were modeled and the agreement between the modeling results and experimental data confirms that the response of the diaphragms follow the design parameters.

The objective of {{the experiment}} is to make clear {{the relationships between the}} moisture buffering effect and, the ventilation and <b>volume</b> <b>rates</b> of the hygrothermal materials. In the experiment, a layer of gypsum board as hygrothermal materials is placed on the interior surface of the test chamber (4. 60 m 3). This chamber is located in the climate room which can control constant temperature and humidity level (20 oC and 50 %rh). For ventilation, a mechanical fan was installed on the chamber with inlet and outlet. Two series of experiments had been carried out. First series was an experiment of ventilation rate and three conditions (i. e. no ventilation, 1. 0 1 /h and 5. 0 1 /h) were adopted. Second series was an experiment of volume late and locations of the gypsum boards. Various sizes and locations of gypsum boards were placed on the interior walls.

Since {{there are}} many kind of syringe pump in the market which are used in hospitals and medical labs, most often the flow rate of dispensing is always tends to be in-accurate. Problems like start-up delays, occlusion, piston gaskets gets stuck has been widely being studied. Researches feel that different type of pump can use only a certain size of syringe to solve the problems. However, in this project, a <b>volume</b> <b>rate</b> syringe pump was designed, instead of flow rate. It is understood that the problems also largely is attribute to the mechanical assembly of the pump, whereby friction and complicated gears has been another root cause aside to syringe size. This project has dealt with a simple designed pump with simple mechanical movement, using a ball screw actuator which overcomes friction problem and a suitable stepper motor. In this project, focused was on a discontinuous pump, where volume is dispensed with respect to time and also position indication in length being measured. The calibration is done using time interval and control is done via a Micro-controller. The experiment was done by defining two kinds of <b>volume</b> <b>rate</b> which is a low <b>volume</b> <b>rate</b> (0. 4 mL/min) and a high <b>volume</b> <b>rate</b> (1 mL/min). Measurements of time reach for every minutes of liquid dispensed and also position reached by the syringe was taken down. The experiment is repeated again this time for a different small size of syringe. It is found that, there was no start up delay occurred for both high and <b>volume</b> <b>rate.</b> Furthermore both time and position accuracy was linear, except that for high volume dispensed the position had a slight deviation.

Experimental trials were carried out {{by means of an}} air assisted towed sprayer, equipped with “Albuz ATR” nozzles. To take into account the influence of the development of the trees, the field trials were replicated in two phenological stages with an interval of about one month: “Inflorescences fully developed” (stage 1) and “Beginning of berry touch” (stage 2). A full factorial experiment was carried out for each growth stage, with two airflow rates (3. 9 and 7. 5 m 3 /s), three <b>volume</b> <b>rates</b> (103, 216, and 276 L/ha in the first growth stage and 154, 330 and 432 L/ha in the second growth stage), and four replicates, arranged according to a randomised complete block design. Working pressure (1. 2 MPa) and forward speed (1. 4 m/s) were kept unchanged for all the trials. The foliar deposition was measured by means of a spectrophotometric technique. The leaves were sampled on two depth layers and two or three heights, according to the trees’ development. The results showed that <b>volume</b> <b>rate</b> did not significantly influence the mean foliar deposition in both the two growth stages, while the highest deposits were obtained with the lowest airflow rate. The airflow <b>rate</b> × <b>volume</b> <b>rate</b> interaction, though not statistically significant, showed that low <b>volume</b> <b>rates</b> together with high airflow rates, result in a noticeable reduction in foliar deposition (29 % with respect the grand mean), due to an increase of the spry drift, especially at the first growth stage, when the foliar development is little. These second tests, unlike those described in [2], did not show any positive influence of the airflow rate on the foliar deposition in the inner part of the canopy, so further investigations could be necessary to better understand the results. The whole results suggest to operate in field at low airflow rates (some 3. 9 m 3 /s) and low <b>volume</b> <b>rates</b> (some 25 L/ha per active nozzle), so to reduce the power requirements and increase the promptness of intervention...|$|R

Clinical outcome is highly variable and depends {{on the type of}} aneurysm, the flow diverting device and treatment strategies. The objective {{of this study was to}} analyze the effect of different flow diverting strategies together with parent artery curvature variations on altering intra-aneurysmal hemodynamics. Four ideal intracranial aneurysm models with different parent artery curvature were constructed. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of the hemodynamics before and after applying five types of flow diverting strategies (single FD, single FD with 5 % and 10 % packing density of coils, two FDs with 25 % and 50 % overlapping rate) were performed. Changes in pressure, wall shear stress (WSS), relative residence time (RRT), inflow velocity and inflow <b>volume</b> <b>rate</b> were calculated and compared. Each flow diverting strategy resulted in enhancement of RRT and reduction of normalized mean WSS, inflow <b>volume</b> <b>rate</b> and inflow velocity in various levels. Among them, 50 % overlapped FD induced most effective hemodynamic changes in RRT and inflow <b>volume</b> <b>rate.</b> The mean pressure only slightly decreased after treatment. Regardless of the kind of implantation of FD, the mean pressure, inflow <b>volume</b> <b>rate</b> and inflow velocity increased and the RRT decreased as the curvature of the parent artery increased.

Efficacy of PPP applications depends on many factors. Based on multiple data obtained over several years in real working conditions using different types of sprayers in vineyards, and by adding a complete data base about crop characteristics (structure, crop stage, leaf area, LAI, etc.), the objective of this work has been to develop an easy and useful tool, DOSAVIÑA, able to determine the optimal <b>volume</b> <b>rate</b> in spray applications in vineyards. DOSAVIÑA, based on a spreadsheet (Microsoft Excel), allows quantifying all the parameters involved in the application process (sprayer type, crop characteristics, working conditions, weather, etc.), and to determine the efficiency of the application. By selecting and choosing the different options for each parameter (crop, pesticide, working conditions, weather conditions, sprayer, and droplet characteristics) the program calculates the theoretical <b>volume</b> <b>rate</b> (L ha‐ 1) based on two different methods, the Optimal Coverage Method and the Tree‐Row‐Volume method.

30|$|Some {{observation}} {{data support}} our hypothesis. In a typical Strombolian explosion, a gas volume of 10 – 104  m 3 is emitted for 1 – 10  s (Del Bello et al. 2012). On the other hand, {{in the case}} of lava fountains, for example at Etna, a gas volume on the order of 108  m 3 can be emitted over ~[*] 100  min (Ulivieri et al. 2013). Based on these values, the gas <b>volume</b> flow <b>rates</b> are approximately 1 – 104  m 3 /s and 104  m 3 /s, respectively. The higher end of the <b>volume</b> <b>rate</b> range for Strombolian explosions is comparable to the <b>volume</b> <b>rate</b> of lava fountains. This result leads to the hypothesis that Strombolian explosions can produce a flow regime similar to that of lava fountains. In the case of Aso volcano, the <b>volume</b> flow <b>rate</b> is estimated to be 3 [*]×[*] 103 – 2 [*]×[*] 104 m 3 /s when D[*]=[*] 10  m (considering an effective diameter in the conduit), ε[*]=[*] 0.45, and Ug[*]=[*] 20 – 160  m/s. Although this rate is somewhat lower than that of the lava fountains at Etna, it is relatively large among the <b>volume</b> <b>rates</b> of Strombolian explosions. Moreover, we can explain the ejection pulses revealed by recent observations using high-speed cameras at Stromboli volcano (Taddeucci et al. 2012; Gaudin et al. 2014). One Strombolian explosion is composed of multiple short bursts (up to a hundred), not a single burst. As Taddeucci et al. (2012) proposed, these ejection pulses suggest that repeated and semicontinuous collapses of the liquid film surrounding long gas pockets could occur due to pressure fluctuations in the gas phase. This idea coincides with our hypothesis that a gas channel characterized as annular flow causes an explosion and subsequent gas emissions.|$|R
