50|$|Sphyraena argentea (also {{known as}} Pacific barracuda, <b>California</b> <b>barracuda,</b> and silver barracuda) is a predatory fish {{found in the}} {{northeast}} Pacific Ocean. They range from Cabo San Lucas, Baja California to Washington. However, they are not common north of Point Conception in Santa Barbara County, California. They can reach a length of about 1.2 m and a weight of about 6.8 kg. They are edible. However, they have somewhat of a strong flavor and taste best when smoked. <b>California</b> <b>barracuda</b> are very popular sport fish in Southern California.|$|E

40|$|This {{work was}} {{performed}} as Northern California Marine Sport Fish Survey, Dingell-Johnson Project F- 12 -R. The State of California {{is responsible for}} regulating, protecting, enhancing, and assessing the fish and game resources of California. Estimating the existing and potential take of marine resources {{is one of the}} tasks of the Marine Resources Operations unit of the Department of Fish and Game. Basic life history information on important species, total catch estimates by species, and enumeration of boats, angler effort, and facilities are compiled and published by this unit. Commercial catch records are gathered, compiled, and published for each year, and give data by month and port of landing. All commercial landings are recorded by species or major groupings at the time of sale to fish buyers. These landings are submitted monthly to the Terminal Island statistical unit. The sport catch, however, has not been assessed except for the partyboat catch which is recorded on logs. An ever-increasing demand placed on marine resources by expanding commercial and sport operations has necessitated a more complete evaluation of all segments of the sport fishery. Popular species such as king salmon,[1] striped bass, and lingcod were known to be important in central and northern California. Information on catch of all species was needed so research funds could be allocated more intelligently and recommendations could be made as to future marine sportfishing improvements projects. Upon completion of the Ocean Salmon Study (Dingell-Johnson project F- 12 -R) the project was amended to assess total sport catch and effort from Oregon to Point Arguello. Although a routine annual tabulation of catch and effort, as has been conducted on partyboat and commercial catches, could not be perpetuated, one "base" year's data were gathered. Thus, future surveys could reveal trends of effort and catch for any or all segments of the sport fishery. Short-cut methods could be adopted using basic data gathered during the base year survey. The objectives of this assessment survey, the Northern California Marine Sport Fish Survey, were: (1) To estimate the total average annual fishing effort, in angler days, for each fishing method (i. e. party boat, skiff, pier, skindiving, and shore fishing, including surf casting, rocky shore fishing, fishing from jetties, and surf netting). (2) To estimate the total catch by numbers and species for each fishing method. (3) To estimate the total catch by weight for certain fisheries. (This objective was added to the project in 1959.) (4) To compute catch-per-unit-of-effort values for each fishing method. (5) To record length composition of all species taken by partyboat fishermen, skiff fishermen, and skindivers. (6) To enumerate and describe all marine sportfishing facilities. (7) To develop sampling techniques and fish identification guides. All catch and effort data were grouped by monthly intervals at each port or fishing locality, and then summarized into yearly totals for each unit of area. Originally, the objectives included an economic survey of the sport fishery, including amount of money spent per trip, distance traveled, etc., such as was conducted in Florida (Ellis, Rosen, and Moffett, 1958). Also, a survey of San Pablo and San Francisco bays was included. The first 6 months of shore coverage, wherein all fishing methods were sampled, revealed the usual array of ensuing problems, and led to re-evaluation of objectives and methodology. The economic survey was discontinued because, though valuable, it was not essential in a biological approach to management. In addition to estimates of annual average effort and catch, biological information, usable in setting up research programs and as "base year" information, was needed. Since the total shoreline of the many bays of the study area was extensive, only skiff facilities, partyboat operations, and certain piers were included. Shore fishing, skindiving, and fishing from small piers were not surveyed in bays and estuaries. Night surf netting and night pier fishing were not included because the project was unable to provide coverage for night work. The need to collect several series of data per fishing method precluded simultaneous survey of all fishing methods. A complete study in 1 year covering all methods was highly desirable, but our limited budget would not permit such an approach. Thus, pier, shore (primarily surf casting), and surf net fishing were surveyed in 1958; skiff fishing in 1959; and partyboat, rocky shore fishing, and skindiving in 1960 – 61. Some series' of data were collected throughout the 3 years to make it possible to evalute yearly variations in catch and effort. No exceptional physical environmental changes, which may have materially altered biological relationships between species, occurred during the survey. The data from several consecutive years have been collated to represent average annual estimates for all parameters. Had this study been conducted during the 3 previous years (1955 – 1957), the sudden warming of ocean waters in 1957, and concurrent influx of southern forms, would have presented unique problems in treating the data in this way. From 1958 – 1961 there was gradual cooling and a return to a more normal physical environment, with consequent reduced occurrences of southern forms in central and northern <b>California,</b> such as <b>barracuda</b> which, in 1957, ranged as far north as Canada. Results of this survey have been summarized in three different ways: (i) as an administrative report, which included a complete set of typed raw data tables along with a narrative description of each fishery and methods used at each locality; (ii) as this report, which includes much of the original data, but in several cases annual summaries have been given in lieu of monthly summaries, and length frequency data are summarized; (iii) as four fishing maps covering 10 counties from Oregon to Santa Barbara County, Calif. These maps list all fishing facilities, public camping sites, and areas where shore fishing, skindiving, clamming, abalone picking, and surf netting are conducted. Also included are details as to the best times of year to fish, gear and bait to use, and notes on life history and behavior of certain fishes...|$|R

40|$|Although {{there are}} at least fifteen kinds of {{barracuda}} distributed in all the warm seas of the world, the <b>California</b> <b>barracuda</b> (Sphyraena argentea) is the only one which may be considered of sufficient commercial importance to constitute a distinct "fishery. " If one may judge by the available statistics, the barracuda of the west coast of Mexico and Central America, those of the Atlantic coast of North America, of the tropical Atlantic, of the coasts of southern Europe, of Africa, and of the seas of Asia, are to the countries which exploit them but little more than incidental additions to the usual landings of other species. It is not surprising, therefore, in the absence of economic necessity, that studies on the biology of any of these fishes have been neglected for those on more important species. Although from Aristotle down, a fairly voluminous literature exists on the nomenclature, the habitats, the voraciousness, and the food value of the various species, practically nothing {{has been written about the}} habits or the life histories. As for the <b>California</b> <b>barracuda,</b> a number of scattered notes on the distribution is all that has added to our knowledge of its biology since Girard first named the species in 1854. Notwithstanding the fact that within the range of California fishing activities, there are two species of barracuda, Sphyraena argentea and Sphyraena ensis, only the former has yet reached the California markets. Sphyraena ensis is known to occur from the Gulf of California to Panama Bay, but possibly because of the availability of Sphyraena argentea farther north, possibly because of the smaller size or the inferior quality of Sphyraena ensis, it has not been taken by our fishermen. Although Sphyraena argentea is distributed from Cape San Lucas, Lower California, north to Puget Sound, it is important commercially only south of Ventura County, California...|$|E
40|$|Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel (CPFV) logs were {{analyzed}} {{to determine the}} degree of sea lion interactions in the CPFV fishery. From 1994 to 1996, sea lions depredated over 152, 000 fish representing more than 40 different species. Although the depredation total seems high, it is still less than 10 % of the fish caught by anglers. In southern California, sea lions primarily depredated <b>California</b> <b>barracuda</b> and mackerels, while in central and northern California, they depredated salmonids. Depredations in central and northern California were seasonal with most occurring during March and April. Southern California depredations occurred year-round with a majority from May through September. Sea lions directly affect CPFV fishing by consuming bait and chum and depredating hooked fish that are being reeled in.

40|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20 th century, marine partyboat fishing in California was a wealthy man's sport, but 30 years later, the nucleus of the present day fleet of about 400 partyboats was forming. The development of the fleet from 1936 to 1967 is traced in brief, including mention of the influence of governmental agencies on safety, food handling, communications, employment, records of catch, and taxes. A study of fleet activities for one year, 1963, is presented and reveals some economic facts of partyboat life. During the 21 year period, 1947 – 1967, the statewide marine partyboat fleet reported a catch of over 71 million fish. Annual totals ranged from 2. 0 to 5. 4 million fish. Salmon, striped bass, rockfish, and lingcod have been the primary species sought and taken from Oregon to Point Arguello, whereas off southern California the <b>California</b> <b>barracuda,</b> kelp and sand bass, California yellowtail, Pacific bonito, and California halibut were the most important species.

40|$|Effort, catch, {{and catch}} rates for {{southern}} California sportfishing from private boats {{and from the}} shoreline were estimated for one-year periods. These categories represent two of four major types of marine sportfishing; the others are fishing from party boats and from piers and jetties. Probability sampling plans employing fisherman interviews were used in obtaining the basic data for the surveys. Shoreline surveys were supplemented by aerial progressive counts of fishing poles. Private boat sportfishing activities during 1964 were estimated at 2. 8 million man hours (mh) of fishing. The catch of almost 1 million fish was composed primarily of five species, Pacific bonito, California halibut, white croaker, sand bass, and kelp bass. A 12 -month survey, 1965 – 66, revealed that surf fishermen expended an estimated 1. 7 million mh of effort in taking 0. 5 million fish. More fishing effort was expended from the bay shoreline, 869, 557 mh, than from the open coast, 776, 732 mh. The catch in each area was markedly different. White croaker, queenfish, and smelt (jack and top) were the most significant species in inland bays, while for the open coast, barred surfperch, opaleye, and California corbina were most important. A synoptic picture of the annual sportfishing activities and harvest in southern California was constructed. The total effort from party boats, piers, jetties, private boats, and the shoreline {{was estimated to be}} 12. 3 million man hours of fishing. Three groups contributed well over half of the 7. 3 million fish captured: tunas, 1. 9 million; sea basses, 1. 4 million; and croakers, 1. 1 million.

40|$|Two {{sources of}} {{historical}} landing data from California's commercial passenger fishing vessel (CPFV) fleet were examined to: 1) assess status {{and content of}} each archival data source, 2) identify reporting differences, and 3) evaluate potential usefulness of the data for enhancing resource assessment. Current and historical CPFV logbook data collected by California Department of Fish and Game are described with respect to status, content, and approximate cost of recovering historical data (1936 - 78) to electronic format. CPFV landing data available from Los Angeles Times, archived in libraries since 1959, are similarly described. CPFV logbook data were compared with observer data from 1985 - 89 to evaluate accuracy of logbook records. Comparison of catch and effort for major species targeted by southern California CPFV anglers revealed significant relationships between reported and observed catch rates for six of ten species examined. Agreement of catch rate trends validates use of logbook data for measuring relative changes in catch and effort for these sport fish species. Direct comparisons of landings data from CPFV logs and Los Angeles Times fish reports were made for years in which Times data are already available in electronic database format, including 1959, 1967, 1975, 1983, 1991, and 1992. Comparisons of total landings by species among years revealed strong correlations between the two sources for those species (e. g., <b>California</b> <b>barracuda,</b> yellowtail, bonito) most heavily targeted over the entire period. Other species, such as California sheephead, spotted scorpionfish, and ocean whitefish, were underreported or not reported by the Times until recently. Comparison of port-wide total landings of all species (1983, 1991, 1992) revealed varied reports of total catch (all species) between sources among ports and years. Times-logbook landing report comparisons were highly correlated for Los Angeles area ports (r 2 = 0. 956), but were also most different in absolute number, with Times reports being an average of 48...|$|E
40|$|This {{bulletin}} is one {{of three}} large publications summarizing kelp investigations at the University of California's Institute of Marine Resources. The general objective of the bulletin is {{to assess the impact of}} man's past, present, and future activities on the kelp-bed environment. Possibilities for future improvement are examined in the opening chapters which describe the life history of the giant-kelp plant and show how this knowledge can be used for culturing and transplanting. Ecology of kelp-bed fishes is treated in detail as a background for evaluating influences of human activities. The distributions and ranges of physical parameters important to fishes are outlined with emphasis on temperature, wave action, visibility, and topography. Diets, behavior, preferred habitats, abundances, and life histories of kelp fishes are described, showing the ecological roles played by kelp as a food source, shelter, attractant, and vehicle for making phytoplankton productivity more available to associated fauna. It was found, however, that kelp was not a habitat requirement for most fishes, nor did it increase species diversity significantly. There was evidence that it may contribute to greater standing crops of fishes but bottom topography was considered a more important attractant. It was estimated that kelp harvesting removed an annual maximum of about 10 percent of the food supplies available for fishes. This was not considered serious because generally there appear to be ample food reserves in kelp beds. Statistical correlations were sought between harvest returns and sportfish catches and catches per unit of effort. Neither statewide totals nor selected situations representing southern, northern, and island environments yielded any relation. Analyses were broken down to the more important groups or species of sportfishes and the only relation observed was a negative correlation between <b>California</b> <b>barracuda</b> catches and harvest yields. Since barracuda are pelagic the relation was considered to be indirect, resulting from interactions with ocean temperature. Fishing was better in beds harvested more frequently. Fishing in deteriorating beds was analyzed. Generally emphasis shifted to new groups of sportfish when more conventional fisheries declined. Statistical treatment was extended to comparisons of adjacent kelp beds that had been subjected to quite different intensities of harvesting. Harvest yield was not affected by harvesting intensity for the 11 -year period examined. Kelp was sampled as it came aboard a harvesting vessel and about one third of the motile canopy fauna was removed from the habitat. The attached fauna, however, was entirely removed. Physiological studies indicated that cutting did not influence photosynthesis in adjacent kelp tissues of the cut frond. Growth of young fronds was, in some cases, retarded for periods up to a month but in other cases growth was stimulated. The complex interplay of environmental variables probably determined the character of any changes in growth rate. The interplay was described by a mathematical model and five cutting experiments were undertaken to test model predictions. Results were considered satisfactory. It was generally concluded that giant kelp encourages development of a rich associated fauna. No adverse influence of harvesting could be found among the statistics or field observations for the periods studied. The need for intelligent management is stressed to ensure that optimum utilization of the kelp resources will continue...|$|E
40|$|Our {{study focused}} {{on the status of}} the marine {{recreational}} fishery along the northern and central California coast, where surveys of recreational fishing effort and catch were conducted from 1958 – 61 and from 1981 – 86. Between the two surveys, annual recreational fishing effort rose from 1. 6 million fishing days to 2. 7 million fishing days. Nearly all the increase was due to increases in fishing from boats (commercial passenger fishing vessels and private/rental boats). Annual recreational catch rose from 3. 9 million fish weighing 2700 metric tons to 6. 5 million fish weighing 5400 metric tons. The average number of fish caught per day decreased for fishing from piers (1. 9 to 1. 6), other shore areas (1. 7 to 1. 1), and private/rental boats (2. 8 to 2. 4), and increased from commercial passenger fishing vessels (5. 4 to 6. 0). The variety of different fish species caught in a typical day of fishing from boats decreased, but variety from shore increased. Direct expenditures in the fishery from 1981 – 86 were about $ 160 million per year (1992 dollars). Rockfish (Sebastes spp.) dominated the catch from boats in both surveys. Between the two surveys, recreational catch of rockfish rose from 1. 3 million fish to 3. 4 million fish, while average weight per rockfish decreased from 0. 82 kg to 0. 71 kg. Average weight decreased in 12 of 16 major rockfish species. The 12 species were mainly shallow-water (m) species or species with wide depth ranges. The catch from boats shifted towards a higher proportion of deep-water (> 73 m) species. Signs of population stress were found in blue rockfish S. mystinus (decrease in catch), canary rockfish S. pinniger and yellowtail rockfish S. flavidus (decrease in mean length in recreational and trawl catches and high incidence of sexually immature fish in recreational catch), and brown rockfish S. auriculatus (decrease in mean length and high incidence of sexually immature fish in recreational catch). Abrupt declines in lengths of blue rockfish and yellowtail rockfish occurred in central California between 1983 and 1984. Declines reflect mortalities that may in part be attributed to effects of the 1982 – 83 El Niño event. Mean weight per rockfish decreased in a north-to-south cline from Del Norte/Humboldt (1. 13 kg) to San Luis Obispo (0. 48 kg) in 1980 – 86. The major species generally had smaller fish and fewer successful year-classes in central California than northern California. Catches of lingcod Ophiodon elongatus, a trophy species of importance to both boat and shore fishing, have been in slow oscillating decline since the early 1970 s. It is unclear whether the decline is due to overharvest and is a long-term trend that will continue, or if it is due to natural population fluctuations. Fishes of the surfperch family (Embiotocidae) dominated catch from shore in both surveys. of the fish groups we examined, the surfperch showed the greatest evidence of decline. Between the surveys, the weight of sport catch of surfperches declined by 54 % and the weight of commercial catch declined by 26 %. Barred surfperch Amphistichus argenteus and redtail surfperch A. rhodoterus (the two most important surfperches by number and weight landed), and also striped seaperch Embiotoca lateralis showed substantial decreases in recreational catch and average weight per fish. Commercial landings of redtail surfperch in the Eureka area declined by 54 % from 1953 through 1992, despite a rise in price per pound. Commercial landings of barred surfperch in the Santa Barbara area rose by 118 % from 1953 through 1992, perhaps due to a rise in price per pound. White seaperch Phanerodon furcatus stocks may have collapsed prior to the 1958 – 61 survey. Like rockfish, mean weight per surfperch decreased in a north-to-south cline from Del Norte/Humboldt (0. 33 kg) to San Luis Obispo (0. 22 kg) in 1980 – 86. Populations of lingcod and five of six rockfishes examined for interannual length-frequency trends were found to be subject to wide variation in recruitment from year to year. Strong year-classes often dominated a species' catch for several consecutive years. Strong year-classes were not found to be established in the 1957 – 58 and 1982 – 83 El Niño periods. Ten pelagic fish species (albacore Thunnus alalunga, bigeye tuna T. obesus, bluefin tuna T. thynnus, bullet mackerel Auxis rochei, Pacific mackerel Scomber japonicus, Pacific bonito Sarda chiliensis, skipjack Katsuwonus pelamis, yellowfin tuna T. albacares, dolphinfish Coryphaena hippurus, and <b>California</b> <b>barracuda</b> Sphyraena argentea) showed obvious northward shifts in the sampled recreational catch during the 1982 – 83 El Niño event. Eighteen other species showed less pronounced changes that may have been related to El Niño...|$|E
