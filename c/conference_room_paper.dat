Th e collaborative session {{took place in a}} 3 D AutoCAD class for a real world project. Th e 3 D models served as an interface for designer-user collaboration during the design process. Students not only learned how to use 3 D AutoCAD, but also experienced a collaborative session by designing a <b>conference</b> <b>room.</b> Th is <b>paper</b> also compares traditional space planning process and alternative space planning process, as well as student work and feedback from the collaborative session. Recommendations were made for future course improvements when a real world project is used in the curriculum. Th is paper also discusses changes in design process and the role of designers based on the collaborative session feedback...|$|R

40|$|Echo {{and sound}} {{resonance}} in a <b>conference</b> <b>room</b> cause obscure speech and make listeners tired. Thus, the acoustical properties of a <b>conference</b> <b>room</b> are vitally important. The <b>conference</b> <b>room</b> 412 at Sharif University Physics Department {{failed to meet}} basic acoustical standards. The aim {{of this research is}} to improve reverberation time (RT) of the <b>conference</b> <b>room</b> using Helmholtz resonators with defined dimensions, diffusers, and sound absorbers. Helmholtz resonators are widely used to absorb sound noise especially at low frequencies. They are particularly useful when noise has a narrow-frequency band. One of the advantages of using Helmholtz resonators is their capacity to be tuned on different frequencies. We enhanced acoustical properties of Helmholtz resonators using proper absorbers and diffusers. In order to decrease the RT, a large number of Helmholtz resonators have been made and installed in proper positions in the <b>conference</b> <b>room.</b> The RT was measured before and after installation. The measurements indicate that the acoustical characteristics of the <b>conference</b> <b>room</b> have been significantly improved...|$|R

50|$|A {{conference hall}} or <b>conference</b> <b>room</b> is a room {{provided}} for singular {{events such as}} business conferences and meetings. It is commonly found at large hotels and convention centers though many other establishments, including even hospitals, have one. Sometimes other rooms are modified for large conferences such as arenas or concert halls. Aircraft have been fitted out with <b>conference</b> <b>rooms.</b> <b>Conference</b> <b>rooms</b> can be windowless for security purposes.

40|$|Graduation date: 2009 This {{study focused}} on users' {{emotional}} responses to a sustainable and a non-sustainable interior environment. Emotional reactions toward interior environments were tested by having subjects complete a survey. The survey tested users' emotional reactions with a mixed methods approach by including both qualitative and quantitative questions. The scope of this thesis included surveys completed by subjects in the sustainable Kelley Engineering Center <b>conference</b> <b>room</b> number 1114 and in the non-sustainable Bates Hall <b>conference</b> <b>room</b> number 129, both located on the Oregon State University campus in Corvallis, Oregon. 	Survey questions utilized material from Mehrabian and Russell's (1974) "Semantic Differential Measures of Emotional State or Characteristic (Trait) Emotions" scale; Mehrabian and Russell's (1974) "Verbal Measures of Approach-Avoidance" scale; and Anderson's (2006) survey involving lighting, thermal comfort, and noise level satisfaction. There were also open- ended questions and a demographic section. Mehrabian and Russell's "Semantic Differential Measures of Emotional State or Characteristic (Trait) Emotions" scale included only questions based on pleasure and arousal, which were interpreted with Russell's (1980) circumplex model. In addition, pleasure, arousal, and dominance score results were tested with a two-sided paired t-test. The thermal comfort, lighting, and noise variables were tested using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. 	The findings of this research were mixed. The pleasure and arousal results were significant, indicating that participants rated the sustainable and non-sustainable interior environments differently. In addition {{to the results of}} the two-sided paired t-test, the differences in pleasure and arousal scoring for the two interior environments were also apparent in the circumplexes. The circumplex for the Kelley Engineering Center <b>conference</b> <b>room</b> showed that many participants rated the interior positively on the pleasure axis and on the arousal axis, indicating that users felt excited in the space. Regarding the Bates Hall <b>conference</b> <b>room,</b> scores on the circumplex were positive on the pleasure axis, but less so than in the other interior; and they were negative on the arousal axis. These results indicated that participants felt content in the Bates Hall <b>conference</b> <b>room.</b> The results for dominance were not significant. Thermal comfort and noise were also not found to be significant. The satisfaction with the lighting in the interior environments was significant, indicating that participants rated the lighting of the two <b>conference</b> <b>rooms</b> differently. Subjects rated the Kelley Engineering Center <b>conference</b> <b>room</b> lighting as more satisfying than the lighting in the Bates Hall <b>conference</b> <b>room.</b> Lastly, qualitative responses were different for the two spaces. Some participants stated preference for the interior of the Kelley Engineering Center <b>conference</b> <b>room</b> over the Bates Hall <b>conference</b> <b>room.</b> No subjects stated preference for the Bates Hall <b>conference</b> <b>room</b> over the Kelley Engineering Center <b>conference</b> <b>room...</b>|$|R
