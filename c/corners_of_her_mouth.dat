60|$|Her eyebrows were gently raised, the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> quivered, {{her eyes}} fell.|$|E
60|$|Eleanor {{said nothing}} further on the subject, but the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> rearranged themselves.|$|E
60|$|She {{gave him}} a quick look, and a smile quivered at the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b>|$|E
60|$|She shrugged her shoulders, whilst a {{slightly}} contemptuous curl {{appeared at the}} <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'That fiend!' Mr. Darling would cry, and Nana's bark was {{the echo}} of it, but Mrs. Darling never upbraided Peter; there was {{something}} in the right-hand <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> that wanted <b>her</b> not to call Peter names.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, will you?" [...] she said, {{taking away}} her hand. [...] "That would be delightful. But {{what would become}} of your folks?" [...] She caught a <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> with <b>her</b> teeth, as if the word had slipped out.|$|R
60|$|She sighed as {{she took}} it, and a wistful smile {{invested}} the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b>|$|E
60|$|Celia's rare tears had {{got into}} her eyes, and the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> were agitated.|$|E
60|$|Virginia did not deign {{a direct}} reply to this, save by the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Olivia Williams as Mrs. Mary Darling: The matriarch of the Darling {{family who}} is the loveliest lady in Bloomsbury. She {{is said to have}} a kiss that Wendy can never get and that is {{perfectly}} conspicuous on the right hand <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Madame Merle bent {{her head}} on one side a little, protestingly, and smiled at the left <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b> [...] "You've heard, yes. But you must {{remember}} that I've not, in Naples. I hoped to find him here {{and to be able}} to congratulate Pansy." ...|$|R
50|$|Daughter of Carr Benedict and Fiona, and Treize's fraternal twin sister, {{she is the}} {{official}} {{heir to the throne}} of Ikstova. Has a pushy and headstrong personality similar to Allison, which she shows even in front <b>of</b> <b>her</b> own parents. She has a sharp tooth at the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> that stands out when she talks.|$|R
60|$|Eva {{took it and}} smiled, {{though there}} was still a nervous twiching about the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b>|$|E
60|$|Mary cast {{down her}} eyes, and the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> twitched {{as if with}} a slight smile.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. McCaskey arose heavily, {{and went}} toward the dish closet, with the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> drawn down.|$|E
40|$|MARIANNE {{tossed the}} red curls from her eyes, intent on her work. She squirmed in her desk {{for a better}} position, her fingers {{tightening}} around the crayon. Her nose wrinkledâ€”rabbit fashion, and a pink tongue crept to the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b> She drew in her breath, then very slowly lettered. M [...] . A [...] . R [...] . I [...] . ...|$|R
5000|$|Mel Corkum: An unintelligent, obese, pig-ugly {{girl with}} a pug nose, no cheekbones, a double chin, straight, greasy hair, a zit near the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth,</b> and pale, pink-rimmed eyes set too close. Appears {{confident}} but secretly has low self-esteem; cheerful mom died in a snowstorm; does the heavy-duty jobs in the Shrikes; lives in Long Bight.|$|R
60|$|He liked Mrs. Saulisbury at once, though {{naturally}} prejudiced against her. She {{had evidently}} {{been a very}} handsome woman, but some concealed pain had made her face thin and drawn, and one <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> was set in a slight fold as if by a touch <b>of</b> paralysis. <b>Her</b> profile was still very beautiful, and her voice {{was that of a}} highly cultivated American.|$|R
60|$|She halted {{and half}} turned, and I thought I saw a slight droop at the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b>|$|E
60|$|He {{thrust his}} hand into his pocket, but Mrs. Foulton drew back. The <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> were drawn tightly together.|$|E
60|$|At this {{there was}} a quick flash in her eyes, and the first tremblings of a smile at the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b>|$|E
60|$|When {{the train}} {{pulled out of}} the station into the clearer light, she turned her face from him toward the forward window, and the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth,</b> which <b>her</b> half-averted profile gave him, had a kind of piteous droop which smote him to keener regret. Once it lifted in an upward curve, and a gay light came into the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> eye; then the mouth drooped again, and the light went out.|$|R
5000|$|Comics {{journalist}} Jonathan Miller described Jean DeWolff as [...] "a secondary {{character that}} could facilitate {{a sense of}} continuity Marvel Team-Up, someone who knew only the costumed side of Peter's personality, and yet had a genuine relationship with him. Hard-edged and no-nonsense, DeWolff usually made her entrance in her vintage roadster, cigarette dangling from the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth,</b> a modern, post-feminist take on the classic tough-guy heroes of Dashiell Hammett and Mickey Spillane." ...|$|R
60|$|Her eyes rested upon his, {{a little}} narrowed, curiously and pleasantly reflective. All {{the time the}} <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> {{sensitive}} <b>mouth</b> twitched a little.|$|R
6000|$|Lady Barbara {{could not}} keep the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> quite stiff, but she still said, [...] "You {{do not know what}} you are undertaking." ...|$|E
60|$|Marguerite, with dainty affection, had {{kissed her}} hand to the ladies, as they {{disappeared}} through the door, then a humorous smile began hovering round the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'How {{can you be}} so absurd, Anne?' {{answered}} Elizabeth, {{trying to}} look serious, but the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> relaxing, in spite of her attempts to control her risible muscles.|$|E
60|$|As {{he passed}} out through the breakfast-room, Lily was sitting by the window with her letter in her lap, and a happy smile on her lips. When he came back she {{happened}} to be seated in the same place; she still had a letter in her lap, but she was smiling no longer; her face was turned from him as he entered, and he imagined a wistful droop in that <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> which showed on her profile.|$|R
60|$|And at {{that the}} <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> own <b>mouth</b> {{broke into a}} smile, and she thought with a {{simultaneous}} pleasure of Gregory's absurdity and of his safety.|$|R
60|$|Valerie {{looked up}} into the {{beautiful}} ivory-white face, with its black eyes and singularly scarlet lips, and a wan smile raised the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> gentle <b>mouth.</b>|$|R
60|$|She faced me, when I {{asked for}} my instructions; and I saw the family frown {{gathering}} over her eyes, and the family temper twitching at the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b>|$|E
60|$|Lady Hardy {{sat for a}} moment, {{a picture}} of meek distress. Then, her {{delicate}} eyebrows raised, and the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> drooping, she touched the button of the silver table-bell.|$|E
60|$|Just then Ida {{took her}} hand from her face. There was a dewy look about her eyes, and the last ripples of a happy smile lingered round the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b>|$|E
6000|$|To {{his great}} consternation the girl {{approached}} tremblingly {{from the inner}} shadow. The faintest and saddest of smiles for a moment played around the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> drawn <b>mouth</b> and tear-dimmed eyes as {{she held out her}} hand and said:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps," [...] said Eve, with {{a little}} smile, in which the extreme <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> pretty <b>mouth</b> had the {{peculiar}} tendency to turn down instead of up--"perhaps {{it is because they}} are grateful. Indians are not altogether destitute of that feeling." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{new arrival}} {{stopped and looked}} out over the footlights, not in the pained manner of the man in the bowler hat, but with the sort of genial indulgence of one who has come to a {{juvenile}} party to amuse the children. She was a square, wholesome, good-humoured looking girl with a serious face, the gravity of which was contradicted by the faint smile that seemed to lurk about the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b> She was certainly not pretty, and Sally, watching her with keen interest, was surprised that Fillmore had had the sense to disregard surface homeliness and recognize her charm. Deep down in Fillmore, Sally decided, there must lurk an unsuspected vein of intelligence.|$|R
