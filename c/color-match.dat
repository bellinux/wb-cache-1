Gold solder is usually made {{in at least three}} melting-point ranges referred to as Easy, Medium and Hard. By using the hard, high-melting point solder first, followed by solders with progressively lower melting points, goldsmiths can assemble complex items with several separate soldered joints.

40|$|The {{process of}} color-matching any color product {{is a process}} that can be quite {{complicated}} and requires great skill from a color analyst. As the name suggests color-matching is the process in which the color of a standard is obtained from a sample through careful inspection and precision in order for the colors to match up. It {{is a process that}} can vary in length dependent of the amount of pigments used.  Foundations are a type of liquid emulsion cosmetic and consist of five main pigments; white (titanium dioxide), red, brown, yellow and black iron oxides. These five pigments can when mixed together result in hundreds of shades. One of the greatest challenges for cosmetics companies is to successfully manufacture these shades often from a benchmark, a desired shade, as well as maintaining this same shade when the batch is scaled up from lab production to factory.  Oriflame is a direct-selling cosmetics company in which the Marketing department and Color Cosmetic department work closely in order to produce new products and shades for each catalogue. Liquid foundation shades are decided by the Marketing department and given to the Color Cosmetic department to <b>color-match.</b>  Currently the process of color-matching is carried out through the visual assessment by the color analyst. In order to improve the efficiency and lead - time of the current method, Oriflame has drawn inspiration from other sectors dealing with color and taken the decision to <b>color-match</b> {{with the use of a}} spectrophotometer coupled with color-appropriate software. The method was divided into four separate processes; confirming a sample method presentation to the spectrophotometer, colorant file set-up & process, color-matching process with the color-appropriate software and color match comparison. The results showed that with an adequate sized colorant file a method for color-matching with a spectrophotometer was established. The lead-time could be decreased by, as much as 66. 6 % and providing strong evidence that this is a valuable tool for color analysts working at Oriflame...|$|E
40|$|Standard color-matching {{functions}} {{are designed to}} represent the mean color-matching response {{of the population of}} human observers with normal color vision. When using these functions, two questions arise. Are they an accurate representation of the population? And what is the uncertainty in <b>color-match</b> predictions? To address these questions in the dual context of human visual performance and cross-media reproduction, a color-matching experiment was undertaken in which twenty observers made matches between seven different colors presented in reflective and transmissive color reproduction media and a CRT display viewed through an optical apparatus that produced a simple split field stimulus. In addition, a single observer repeated the experiment 20 times to quantify intra-observer variability. The results are used to evaluate the accuracy of three sets of color-matching functions, to quantify the magnitude of observer variability, and to compare intra- and inter-observer variability in color matching. These results are compared with current CIE recommendations on observer metamerism. The magnitude of observer variability in this experiment also provides a quantitative estimate of the limit of cross-media color reproduction accuracy that need not be exceeded...|$|E

Which of the two tasks the participant had to perform was indicated by corresponding cues, either the word “Form ” or the word “Color ” (see figure). Two cues, separated by 8 trials, were presented within each block of 16 trials in two possible combinations: non-conflict (Cue 1 =Cue 2) or conflict (Cue 1 ≠Cue 2).

40|$|Estimation of {{individual}} spectral cone fundamentals from <b>color-matching</b> functions is a classical and longstanding problem in color science. In this {{paper we propose}} a novel method to carry out this estimation based on a linear optimization technique, employing an assumption of a priori knowledge of the retinal absorptance functions. The result is an estimation of the combined lenticular and macular filtration for an individual, along with the nine coefficients in the linear combination that relates their <b>color-matching</b> functions to their estimated spectral-cone fundamentals. We test the method on the individual Stiles and Burch <b>color-matching</b> functions and derive cone-fundamental estimations for different viewing fields and matching experiment repetition.

40|$|Abstract—We {{propose a}} method for color {{stabilization}} of shots of the same scene, taken under the same illumination, where one image is chosen as reference and one or several other images are modified so that their colors match those of the reference. We make use of two crucial but often overlooked observations: firstly, that {{the core of the}} color correction chain in a digital camera is simply a multiplication by a 3 x 3 matrix; secondly, that to <b>color-match</b> a source image to a reference image we don’t need to compute their two color correction matrices, it’s enough to compute the operation that transforms one matrix into the other. This operation is a 3 x 3 matrix as well, which we call H. Once we have H, we just multiply by it each pixel value of the source and obtain an image which matches in color the reference. To compute H we only require a set of pixel correspondences, we don’t need any information about the cameras used, neither models nor specifications or parameter values. We propose an implementation of our framework which is very simple and fast, and show how it can be successfully employed in a number of situations, comparing favourably with the state of the art. There is a wide range of applications of our technique, both for amateur and professional photography and video: color matching for multi-camera TV broadcasts, color matching for 3 D cinema, color stabilization for amateur video, etc. I...|$|E
40|$|Background and Aims: Dentists perform <b>color-match</b> process during {{indirect}} {{and direct}} restorations. Color {{research has shown}} that shade guides do not always match the color of natural teeth. Moreover, visual evaluation of dental colors {{has been found to be}} inconsistent and unreliable. In fact, it has always been important when using different shade guides. Our purpose in this study was to compare shade selection using two shade guide systems of Vitapan Classical and 3 D Master by dental students of Tabriz University of Medical Sciences. Materials and methods: In this analytical, cross-sectional descriptive study, 20 male and 20 female senior dental students with a little clinical experience in working with shade guides were selected. Each student used two shade guides (Vitapan Classical and 3 D Master) separately for shade matching. Shade selection was randomly repeated one week later by the same protocol. T-test was used to compare repeatability of color matching (α= 0. 05). Comparison of the repeatability percentage was done with t-test. Results: Comparison of repeatability percentages of shade matching irrespective of gender showed that percentage of repeatability of shade match in 3 D Master system was significantly high (P= 0. 00). In addition comparison of repeatability means of shade match with different shade guide systems on the basis of gender showed no significant differences (P= 0. 68). Conclusion: In general, the repeatability percentages of shade matching in 3 D Master system was high and shade matching in females with this system was not different than males.   Key words: Color vision; indirect restorations; dental student...|$|E
40|$|Young {{typically}} developing (TD) {{children have}} been observed to utilize word learning strategies such as the noun bias and shape bias; these improve their efficiency in acquiring and categorizing novel terms. Children using the shape bias extend object labels to new objects of the same shape; thus, the shape bias prompts the categorization of object words based on the global characteristic of shape over local, discrete details. Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) frequently attend to minor details of objects rather than their global structure. Therefore, children with ASD may not use shape bias to acquire new words. Previous research with children with ASD has provided evidence that they parallel TD children in showing a noun bias, but not a shape bias (Tek et al., 2008). However, this sample was small and individual and item differences were not investigated in depth. In an extension of Tek et al., (2008) with twice the sample size and a wider developmental timespan, we tested 32 children with ASD and 35 TD children in a longitudinal study across 20 months using the Intermodal Preferential Looking (IPL) paradigm. Children saw five triads of novel objects (target, shape-match, <b>color-match)</b> in both NoName and Name trials; those who looked longer at the shape match during the Name trials than the NoName trials demonstrated a shape bias. The TD group showed a significant shape bias at all visits, beginning at 20 months of age while the language-matched ASD group did not show a significant shape bias at any visit. Within the ASD group, though, some children did show a shape bias; these children had larger vocabularies concurrently and longitudinally. Degree of shape bias elicitation varied by item, but did not seem related to perceptual complexity. We conclude that shape {{does not appear to}} be an organizing factor for word learning by children with ASD...|$|E

40|$|Objectives. To assess {{visually}} <b>color-matching</b> and blending-effect (BE) of {{a universal}} shade bulk-fill-resin-composite placed in resin-composite-models with different shades and cavity sizes and in natural teeth (extracted and patients’ teeth). Materials and Methods. Resin-composite-discs (10 [*]mm × 1 [*]mm) were prepared of universal shade composite and resin-composite of shades: A 1, A 2, A 3, A 3. 5, and A 4. Spectrophotometric-color-measurement was performed to calculate color-difference (ΔE) between the universal shade and shaded-resin-composites discs and determine their translucency-parameter (TP). Visual assessment was performed by seven normal-color-vision-observers to determine the <b>color-matching</b> between the universal shade and each shade, under Illuminant D 65. <b>Color-matching</b> visual scoring (VS) values were expressed numerically (1 – 5) : 1 : mismatch/totally unacceptable, 2 : Poor-Match/hardly acceptable, 3 : Good-Match/acceptable, 4 : Close-Match/small-difference, and 5 : Exact-Match/no-color-difference. Occlusal cavities of different sizes were prepared in teeth-like resin-composite-models with shades A 1, A 2, A 3, A 3. 5, and A 4. The cavities were filled by the universal shade composite. The same scale was used to score <b>color-matching</b> between the fillings and composite-models. BE was calculated as difference in mean-visual-scores in models and that of discs. Extracted teeth with two different class I-cavity sizes as well as ten patients’ lower posterior molars with occlusal caries were prepared, filled by universal shade composite, and assessed similarly. Results. In models, the universal shade composite showed close matching in the different cavity sizes and surrounding shades (4 ≤VS< 5) (BE = 0. 6 – 2. 9 in small cavities and 0. 5 – 2. 8 in large cavities). In extracted teeth, there was good-to-close <b>color-matching</b> (VS = 3. 7 – 4. 4 in small cavities, BE = 2. 5 – 3. 2) (VS = 3 – 3. 5, BE = 1. 8 – 2. 3 in large cavities). In patients’ molars, the universal shade composite showed good-matching (VS = 3 – 3. 3, BE = − 0. 9 – 2. 1). Conclusions. <b>Color-matching</b> of universal shade resin-composite was satisfactory rather than perfect in patients’ teeth...|$|R

40|$|This {{document}} {{is a report}} on the research of a potentially superior method of color image transformation for producing rapid and accurate printed color output from a digitized color image. The primary objective is to reduce the complexities, inaccuracies, objectionable artifacts, and processing time common to current methods of color modeling. A new method of vector-corrected mathematical modeling combined with improved color space interpolation is studied. This achievement allows for rapid automatic closed-loop <b>color-match</b> calibration between image capture and output devices. Currently, digital image creation or manipulation systems rely on image proof printing which is slow and often of poor color fidelity or proprietary. The ideal system would provide optimum color reproduction fidelity and rapid proof printing at a low cost. Existing systems often rely on mathematical models for image con version for printing. These models are usually a bottleneck in the proofing process and are not accurate enough for many applica tions. Increasing their accuracy rapidly increases processing time to the point of impracticality well before graphic arts quality levels are achieved. A common solution to this problem in larger systems is a massive and tediously generated color look-up table based on actual measured print samples. This method is costly and does not readily accommodate printing process changes such as paper grade or ink color. Attempts {{to reduce the size of}} these look-up tables and the large quantity of required sample measurements have been disappointing. In this thesis, new methods will be reported which should allow practical small-system color proof printing with excellent color fidelity and rapid processing. By eliminating common problems associated with color space interpolation, these new methods make closed-loop control practical with a relatively small quantity of sample measurements which can be automatically printed, scanned, and incorporated into conversion processes...|$|E

40|$|The use of {{colorimetry}} within {{industry has}} grown {{extensively in the}} last few decades. Central to many of today 2 ̆ 7 s instruments is the CIE system, established in 1931. Many have questioned the validity of the assumptions made by Wright 1 and Guild, 2 some suggesting that the 1931 <b>color-matching</b> functions are not the best representation of the human visual system 2 ̆ 7 s cone responses. A computational analysis was performed using metameric data to evaluate the CIE 1931 <b>color-matching</b> functions as compared to with other responsivity functions. The underlying assumption was that an optimal set of responsivity functions would yield minimal color-difference error between pairs of visually matched metamers. The difference of average color differences found in the six chosen sets of responsivity functions was small. The CIE 1931 2 ° <b>color-matching</b> functions on average yielded the largest color difference, 4. 56 E. The best performance came from the CIE 1964 10 ° <b>color-matching</b> functions, which yielded an average color difference of 4. 02 E. An optimization was then performed to derive a new set of <b>color-matching</b> functions that were visually matched using metameric pairs of spectral data. If all pairs were to be optimized to globally minimize the average color difference, it is expected that this would produce an optimal set of responsivity functions. The optimum solution was to use a weighted combination of each set of responsivity functions. The optimized set, called the Shaw and Fairchild responsivity functions, was able to reduce the average color difference to 3. 92 E. In the final part of this study a computer-based simulation of the color differences between the sets of responsivity functions was built. This simulation allowed a user to load a spectral radiance or a spectral reflectance data file and display the tristimulus match predicted by each of the seven sets of responsivity functions...|$|R
