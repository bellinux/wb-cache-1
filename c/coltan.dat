5|$|Tantalum is {{considered}} a conflict resource. <b>Coltan,</b> the industrial name for a columbite–tantalite mineral from which columbium (i.e. niobium) and tantalum are extracted, {{can also be found}} in Central Africa, which is why tantalum is being linked to warfare in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (formerly Zaire). According to an October 23, 2003 United Nations report, the smuggling and exportation of <b>coltan</b> has helped fuel the war in the Congo, a crisis that has resulted in approximately 5.4 million deaths since 1998 – making it the world’s deadliest documented conflict since World War II. Ethical questions have been raised about responsible corporate behavior, human rights, and endangering wildlife, due to the exploitation of resources such as <b>coltan</b> in the armed conflict regions of the Congo Basin. However, although important for the local economy in Congo, the contribution of <b>coltan</b> mining in Congo to the world supply of tantalum is usually small. The United States Geological Survey reports in its yearbook that this region produced a little less than 1% of the world's tantalum output in 2002–2006, peaking at 10% in 2000 and 2008.|$|E
5|$|Tantalum, always {{together}} with the chemically similar niobium, occurs in the minerals tantalite, columbite and <b>coltan</b> (a mix of columbite and tantalite).|$|E
5|$|The {{industrial}} sector is small, contributing 14.8% of GDP in 2014. Products manufactured include cement, agricultural products, small-scale beverages, soap, furniture, shoes, plastic goods, textiles and cigarettes. Rwanda's mining industry {{is an important}} contributor, generating US$93million in 2008. Minerals mined include cassiterite, wolframite, gold, and <b>coltan,</b> which {{is used in the}} manufacture of electronic and communication devices such as mobile phones.|$|E
25|$|A {{significant}} {{reserve of}} <b>coltan</b> {{was discovered in}} 2009 in western Venezuela. In 2009 the Colombian government announced <b>coltan</b> reserves {{had been found in}} Colombia's eastern provinces.|$|E
25|$|Estimates of Congo's {{fraction}} of the world's <b>coltan</b> reserves range from 64% and up, but the higher estimates are difficult to trace to reliable data. Professional bodies like the British Geological Survey estimate 9% total for Central Africa. Tantalum, the primary mineral extracted from <b>coltan,</b> is also mined from other sources, and Congolese <b>coltan</b> has represented around 10% of world production in recent years.|$|E
25|$|Cassiterite {{production}} {{peaked at}} 1,000 tonnes in 1990, but was under 700 tonnes in 2000. Recorded <b>coltan</b> production has soared from 147 tonnes in 1999 to 1,300 tonnes in 2001, and <b>coltan</b> was the country's biggest single export earner in 2001. At {{least part of}} the increase in production is because of new mines opening up in Rwanda. However it is true, as has frequently been observed, that the increase is also because of the fraudulent re-export of Congolese <b>coltan.</b> In addition to the well-publicised involvement in this trade of the Rwandan Defence Force (RDF), another important factor in the <b>coltan</b> re-export is that international dealers are under pressure not to buy from the DRC, thus increasing the incentive for DRC <b>coltan</b> to be re-exported as Rwanda's. Rwanda is also alleged to be trading in fraudulently exported gold and diamonds from the DRC.|$|E
25|$|<b>Coltan</b> (short for columbitetantalite {{and known}} industrially as tantalite) is a dull black {{metallic}} ore {{from which the}} elements niobium and tantalum are extracted. The niobium-dominant mineral in <b>coltan</b> is columbite (after niobium's original American name, columbium), and the tantalum-dominant mineral is tantalite.|$|E
25|$|Much <b>coltan</b> {{from the}} DRC is {{exported}} to China for processing into electronic-grade tantalum powder and wires. <b>Coltan</b> imports from DRC to Europe are usually directed to Central/Eastern Europe and Russia. These cargoes mostly {{travel through the}} route Dar es Salaam (Tanzania), Piraeus (Greece), then the Balkans. Nova Dies, an offshore consortium based in British Virgin Islands, mostly controls the trans-Balkan transportation network. This network carries mostly unprocessed <b>coltan</b> mined in uncontrolled artisanal mines, and so it hinders the development of processing infrastructure in DRC. Therefore, this route is a long-term threat for DRC economy.|$|E
25|$|<b>Coltan</b> {{smuggling}} likely provided {{income for}} the military occupation of Congo, and the prolonged civil conflict afterwards. To many, this raises ethical questions akin to those of blood diamonds. Because {{it is difficult to}} distinguish legitimate from illegitimate mining operations, several processors such as Cabot Corp (USA) have decided to forgo central African <b>coltan</b> altogether, relying on other sources.|$|E
25|$|Conflicts, {{including}} the Rwandan occupation {{in the east}} of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), made it difficult for the DRC to exploit its <b>coltan</b> reserves. Mining of <b>coltan</b> is mainly artisanal and small-scale. A 2003 UN Security Council report stated that much of the ore is mined illegally and smuggled across Congo's eastern border by militias from neighbouring Uganda, Burundi and Rwanda.|$|E
25|$|In , <b>coltan</b> {{is needed}} by Skynet to create second {{generation}} Terminators with superior heat resistance.|$|E
25|$|All three {{countries}} {{named by the}} United Nations as <b>coltan</b> smugglers have denied being involved. Austrian journalist Klaus Werner has documented links between multi-national companies like Bayer and the illegal <b>coltan</b> traffic. A United Nations committee investigating the plunder of gems and minerals in Congo listed in its final report approximately 125 companies and individuals involved in business activities breaching international norms. Companies accused of irresponsible corporate behavior include Cabot Corporation, Eagle Wings Resources International Forrest Group and OM Group.|$|E
25|$|The zoo {{collects}} and recycles {{cell phones}} through {{a program called}} ECO-CELL. The objective of both the zoo and ECO-CELL is to reduce <b>coltan</b> mining. <b>Coltan</b> is a raw material used in the manufacturing process of cell phones and it is mined almost exclusively in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The mining results {{in a loss of}} habitat for gorillas, elephants, okapi and many others. For every cell phone recycled through ECO-CELL, the zoo receives a donation to its conservation fund. ECO-CELL has partnerships with over 110 zoos {{and is a member of}} the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA).|$|E
25|$|Rwanda's mining {{industry}} {{is an important}} contributor, generating US$93million in 2008. Minerals mined include cassiterite, wolframite, sapphires, gold, and <b>coltan,</b> which {{is used in the}} manufacture of electronic and communication devices such as mobile phones.|$|E
25|$|<b>Coltan</b> is used {{primarily}} {{for the production of}} tantalum capacitors, used in many electronic devices. Many sources mention coltan's importance in the production of mobile phones, but tantalum capacitors are used in almost every kind of electronic device.|$|E
25|$|The SEC is {{mandated}} to create rules that address potential conflict materials (e.g. <b>coltan,</b> tantalum, tin, tungsten, gold or their derivatives) {{and to assess}} whether materials originating {{in or near the}} Democratic Republic of the Congo are benefiting armed groups in the area.|$|E
25|$|In April 2001, a UN {{panel of}} experts {{investigated}} the illegal exploitation of diamonds, cobalt, <b>coltan,</b> gold and other lucrative resources in the Congo. The report accused Rwanda, Uganda and Zimbabwe of systematically exploiting Congolese resources and recommended the Security Council impose sanctions.|$|E
25|$|There {{has been}} a {{significant}} drop in the production and sale of <b>coltan</b> and niobium from African mines since the dramatic price spike in 2000, which was based on dot com speculation and multiple ordering. This is confirmed in part by figures from the United States Geological Survey.|$|E
25|$|For Congolese, mining is {{the easiest}} source of income, because the work is consistent, albeit for only 1 dollar per day. It is laborious, as miners walk for days in the forest to the ore, scratch it with hand tools and pan it. About 90% of young men in Congo do this. Research {{revealed}} that many Congolese leave farming because they need money quickly and cannot wait for crops to grow. Farming also presents obstacles. For example, a lack of roads makes it extremely difficult to transport produce to markets, and the harvest can be taken by militias or the Congolese army. Once their food is taken away or {{they can no longer}} grow food, people resort to mining to sustain themselves. Organized mines are usually run by corrupt groups like militias. Congolese have few tools to mine <b>coltan,</b> and no safety procedures or experience in mining. There is no government aid or intervention in many unethical and abusive circumstances. Miners consider <b>coltan</b> mining a way to provide for themselves in the face of widespread war and conflict and a government that has no concern for their welfare.|$|E
25|$|From 1995 to 2005, Africa's rate of {{economic}} growth increased, averaging 5% in 2005. Some countries experienced still higher growth rates, notably Angola, Sudan and Equatorial Guinea, all of which had recently begun extracting their petroleum reserves or had expanded their oil extraction capacity. The continent is believed to hold 90% of the world's cobalt, 90% of its platinum, 50% of its gold, 98% of its chromium, 70% of its tantalite, 64% of its manganese and one-third of its uranium. The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has 70% of the world's <b>coltan,</b> a mineral used {{in the production of}} tantalum capacitors for electronic devices such as cell phones. The DRC also has more than 30% of the world's diamond reserves. Guinea is the world's largest exporter of bauxite. As the growth in Africa has been driven mainly by services and not manufacturing or agriculture, it has been growth without jobs and without reduction in poverty levels. In fact, the food security crisis of 2008 which took place {{on the heels of the}} global financial crisis has pushed back 100 million people into food insecurity.|$|E
500|$|Niobium is {{estimated}} to be the 34th most common element in the Earth’s crust, with 20ppm. Some think that the abundance on Earth is much greater, and that the element's high density has concentrated it in the Earth’s core. The free element is not found in nature, but niobium occurs in combination with other elements in minerals. Minerals that contain niobium often also contain tantalum. [...] Examples include columbite ((Fe,Mn)(Nb,Ta)2O6) and columbite–tantalite (or <b>coltan,</b> (Fe,Mn)(Ta,Nb)2O6). Columbite–tantalite minerals are most usually found as accessory minerals in pegmatite intrusions, and in alkaline intrusive rocks. Less common are the niobates of calcium, uranium, thorium and the rare earth elements. [...] Examples of such niobates are pyrochlore ((Na,Ca)2Nb2O6(OH,F)) and euxenite ((Y,Ca,Ce,U,Th)(Nb,Ta,Ti)2O6). These large deposits of niobium have been found associated with carbonatites (carbonate-silicate igneous rocks) and as a constituent of pyrochlore.|$|E
500|$|Although Kagame's {{primary reason}} for the two wars in the Congo was Rwanda's security, he was alleged to gain {{economic}} benefit by exploiting the mineral wealth of the eastern Congo. The 2001 United Nations Report of the Panel of Experts on the Illegal Exploitation of Natural Resources and Other Forms of Wealth of the Democratic Republic of the Congo alleged that Kagame, along with Ugandan President Museveni, were [...] "on the verge of becoming the godfathers of the illegal exploitation {{of natural resources and}} the continuation of the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo". The report also claimed that the Rwandan Ministry of Defence contained a [...] "Congo Desk" [...] dedicated to collecting taxes from companies licensed to mine minerals around Kisangani, and that substantial quantities of <b>coltan</b> and diamonds passed through Kigali before being resold on the international market by staff on the Congo Desk. International NGO Global Witness also conducted field studies in early 2013. It concluded that minerals from North and South Kivu are exported illegally to Rwanda and then marketed as Rwandan. Kagame dismissed these allegations as unsubstantiated and politically motivated; in a 2002 interview with newsletter Africa Confidential, Kagame said that if solid evidence against Rwandan officers was presented, it would be dealt with very seriously. In 2010, the United Nations released a report accusing the Rwandan army of committing wide scale human rights violations and crimes against humanity in the Democratic Republic of the Congo during the First and Second Congo Wars, charges denied by the Rwandan government.|$|E

2500|$|Tantalum from <b>coltan</b> {{is used to}} {{manufacture}} tantalum capacitors, used in electronic products. [...] <b>Coltan</b> mining has been cited as helping to finance serious conflict, for example the Ituri conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Coltan</b> is {{made into}} a {{component}} for many digital products such as cell phones. The digital age has caused issues regarding power relations and violence between individuals from Congo {{and the rest of}} the world. An example of uneven power relations was in late 2000, when there was a great demand for the PlayStation 2. This demand caused the price of <b>coltan</b> to increase very quickly and after demand for the gaming system fell, so did the price of <b>coltan.</b> The price hike intensified violence in Eastern Congo, as the violence was being directed at everyday [...] "social production". Because there is a growing need for new technologies, the demand for <b>coltan</b> is growing substantially.|$|E
2500|$|Suspicious of a {{redirected}} {{shipment of}} refined <b>coltan,</b> Cameron, Sarah, and John discover another Terminator (Brian Bloom) hoarding the metal—an {{essential component of}} Terminator construction—in preparation for its use in the future war. [...] Dealing with this new threat focuses on John and Sarah's differing tactics; whereas Sarah {{is more concerned with}} John's safety and decides they should ignore this new development, John feels that despite the lack of any apparent threat to himself, they have a responsibility to deal with this new Terminator. [...] John ultimately defies his mother and follows the Terminator to a military bunker where it stores the <b>coltan,</b> seals itself (and John) in, and goes into a [...] "standby mode". [...] Sarah and Cameron successfully retrieve John and the <b>coltan,</b> sealing the Terminator inside. [...] After driving the truck with the <b>coltan</b> into the ocean, it's revealed that Cameron kept a bar of the metal without the others' knowledge.|$|E
2500|$|The Tantalum-Niobium International Study Centre in Belgium, {{the country}} that colonized Congo, has {{encouraged}} international buyers to avoid Congolese <b>coltan</b> on ethical grounds: ...|$|E
2500|$|Deposits of {{precious}} metals (gold, silver, <b>coltan)</b> and fossil fuels (oil and natural gas) occur underneath rainforests globally. [...] These resources {{are important to}} developing nations and their extraction is often given priority to encourage economic growth. [...] Mining and drilling can require large amounts of land development, directly causing deforestation. [...] In Ghana, a West African nation, deforestation from decades of mining activity left about 12% of the country's original rainforest intact.|$|E
2500|$|Countries rich in {{resources}} - such as Congo - {{have been}} affected by the phenomenon called [...] "resource curse". This is a phenomenon where countries that are rich in resources have worse economic development than countries that have fewer resources. This phenomenon does not allow for the Congolese to have a balanced and sustained development. It also indicates a clear relationship between the wealth of resources [...] "…and the likelihood of weak democratic development, corruption, and civil war". Such high levels of corruption lead to great political instability and issues because whoever controls the assets (mainly the political leaders, and the government in Congo) can use them to their own benefit. These resources generate wealth for these people which they use to stay in power [...] "…either through legal means, or coercive ones (e.g. funding militias)". The rise in the importance of <b>coltan</b> as a mineral crucial to technological products [...] "occurred as warlords and armies in the eastern Congo converted artisanal mining operations…into slave labour regimes to earn hard currency to finance their militias". When much of eastern Congo came under the control of Rwandan forces from the 1990s, Rwanda became a major exporter of <b>coltan,</b> benefiting from the weakness of the Congolese government.|$|E
2500|$|Coffee {{production}} of 14,578,560 tons in 2000 compares to a pre-civil war variation between 35,000 and 40,000 tons [...] By 2002 tea became Rwanda’s largest export, with export earnings from tea reaching US$18 million equating to 15,000 tons of dried tea. Rwanda's natural resources are limited. A small mineral industry provides about 5% {{of foreign exchange}} earnings. Concentrates exist of the heavy minerals cassiterite (a primary source of tin), and <b>coltan</b> (used to manufacture electronic capacitors, used in consumer electronics products such as cell phones, DVD players, video game systems and computers).|$|E
50|$|Three {{countries}} in Asia {{are involved with}} <b>coltan</b> mining: China, Thailand, and Malaysia. The Thai and Malaysian <b>coltan</b> industries are based on tin mining, of which <b>coltan</b> is a byproduct. While these countries do have <b>coltan</b> reserves, they remain essentially untapped.|$|E
50|$|The only North American {{country with}} a <b>coltan</b> mining {{industry}} is Canada. Canadian <b>coltan</b> mining has been a large operation in the past, in recent years, the Canadian <b>coltan</b> operations have been greatly reduced in scale; in 2009, Canada produced less than 4% of the world’s <b>coltan</b> supply. This is an economic issue, as Canadian regulations make <b>coltan</b> mining more expensive {{than it is in}} less stringent countries; this, coupled with the difficulty of the mining process makes Canadian <b>coltan</b> more expensive and lessens the demand for it. In recent years, Canada has become involved in the DRC’s <b>coltan</b> mining operation, with more than three hundred billion dollars’ worth of mining assets in that country in 2008.|$|E
5000|$|China is Asia’s largest <b>coltan</b> {{producer}} and the world’s largest <b>coltan</b> refiner, {{with at least}} a third of the world’s <b>coltan</b> being processed there. Many countries export their raw <b>coltan</b> to China for further processing. The UN reports that many tons of <b>coltan</b> from the DRC are processed through China and are often mixed with samples from conflict-free regions to produce tainted <b>coltan</b> that is more difficult to source. This practice undermines the efforts made by countries with legislation restricting conflict materials, such as the United States and Canada. As Western markets have been reducing their demand for conflict <b>coltan,</b> the Chinese market has embraced it with open arms as Chinese firms have begun to carve footholds in the global minerals industry. [...] As a result, the Chinese <b>coltan</b> refining industry has contributed to the perpetuation of human rights violations and environmental destruction in many of the world’s developing regions.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>coltan</b> mining {{operations}} in the Democratic Republic of Congo are the best-known human rights violators of all the global <b>coltan</b> industries. The main conflict {{is associated with the}} decisions made by technological companies using <b>coltan</b> and their impacts on human rights, which have dictated the health, economy, and social structure of the DRC. Conflict <b>coltan</b> mining got its start in the Congo and has garnered much international attention in recent years. Other African countries are involved in the DRC’s <b>coltan</b> crisis. In particular, Rwanda, Burundi, and Uganda have been accused of smuggling <b>coltan</b> over the borders for processing in China or claiming to the UN that DRC-sourced <b>coltan</b> is a product of their own companies; these companies have denied these claims. [...] Furthermore, child labor is a common phenomenon in the DRC, {{with tens of thousands of}} children employed as miners, and the <b>coltan</b> mines are no an exception with children officially as young as twelve accepted as workers in some mines.|$|E

50|$|Currently, few South and Latin American {{countries}} have <b>coltan</b> mining operations. Those that do {{are relatively small}} and largely unregulated operations. The main exception is Brazil, one of the world’s largest <b>coltan</b> producers and home to a large refining industry as well. Though combined Africa produces more, Brazil alone is the world’s largest single <b>coltan</b> producer, having produced 23% of the world’s <b>coltan</b> in 2011.|$|E
