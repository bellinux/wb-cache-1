40|$|In the {{philosophical}} theory of <b>communicative</b> action, <b>rationality</b> refers to interpersonal communication {{rather than to}} a knowing subject. Thus, a social view of rationality is suggested. The theory differentiates between two kinds of <b>rationality,</b> the emancipative <b>communicative</b> and the strategic or instrumental reasoning. Using experimental designs in an fMRI setting, recent studies explored similar questions of reasoning in the social world and linked them with a neural network including prefrontal and parietal brain regions. Here, we employed an fMRI approach to highlight brain areas associated with strategic and communicative reasoning according {{to the theory of}} communicative action. Participants were asked to assess different social scenarios with respect to <b>communicative</b> or strategic <b>rationality.</b> We found a network of brain areas including temporal pole, precuneus, and STS more activated when participants performed communicative reasoning compared with strategic thinking and a control condition. These brain regions have been previously linked to moral sensitivity. In contrast, strategic <b>rationality</b> compared with <b>communicative</b> reasoning and control was associated with less activation in areas known to be related to moral sensitivity, emotional processing, and language control. The results suggest that strategic reasoning is associated with reduced social and emotional cognitions and may use different language related networks. Thus, the results demonstrate experimental support for the assumptions of the theory of communicative action...|$|R
40|$|If a 'general {{theory of}} planning' is impossible, a {{contingent}} framework is proposed to integrate prevailing and emergent planning paradigms which present four {{different views of}} planning: deliberative <b>rationality,</b> <b>communicative</b> practice, coordinative planning, and frame setting.

Rationality is invoked in deliberative problem solving by individuals or quasi-individuals, whose interaction takes the form of communicative practice. Coordinative planning represents interaction between organizations, whereas the domain of planning as frame setting is the community. This contingent framework also subsumes descriptive and normative planning models, which are reviewed and illustrated. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the early}} post-Enlightenment period, {{informed}} by the history of Scottish and European thought, Thomas Carlyle (1795 - 1881) and Sir William Hamilton (1788 - 1856) alerted readers to a melancholy future emerging from mechanical theories of the mind. Opposing a Lockean strand in British and French philosophy, their concerns involved predictions about, among other things, a descent into pessimism/ nihilism {{and the end of}} metaphysics and moral philosophy. Arguably influenced by Carlyle and Hamilton, William James’s (1842 - 1910) much later Varieties of Religious Experience (1902) evinces a similar opposition to medical materialist psychology. Confronting a profound shift within Enlightenment thought, towards the increasing dominance of mechanical theories, Carlyle, Hamilton, and James were variously resisting the mechanization of the human condition and an agency-eradicating instrumentalism. Part of that resistance involved humour and certain indications of hope for humanity that, as Carlyle put it, ‘Mechanism is not always to be our hard taskmaster’. Once immensely influential, Carlyle, Hamilton, and James are presently marginalised figures. However, Jürgen Habermas’s distinction between <b>communicative</b> and instrumental <b>rationality</b> suggests that what was at stake for these thinkers is of continuing relevance. Their work deserves to be explored to recover nineteenth-century Scottish philosophy’s participation in a discourse of transnational status and significance...|$|R

50|$|Communicative rationality: In {{the same}} way that the {{critical}} communicative methodology states that everyone has the capacity for language and action, it also establishes that <b>communicative</b> <b>rationality</b> is the universal basis of these competencies and of egalitarian dialogue without coercion. While instrumental rationality leads us to use language as a medium to reach certain ends, <b>communicative</b> <b>rationality</b> uses language as an instrument for dialogue and understanding (Habermas, 1984/1981). <b>Communicative</b> <b>rationality</b> can be controversial among scientific, since it defends that there is no an important qualitative gap between those who research and those who are the object of research.

40|$|My thesis aims {{to situate}} Jürgen Habermas's theory of {{discourse}} ethics {{in the context}} of contemporary debates in English-speaking moral philosophy. To accomplish this, I treat in the first chapter Humean and Kantian conceptions of practical reason, and their contemporary defenders. In the second chapter, I move on to Habermas's own work. His ethics is built on the background of original theories of <b>communicative</b> action and <b>rationality.</b> Going through the theory I try to correct some of Habermas's terminological idiosyncrasies. The third chapter is devoted to the concept of identity in its different meanings. I situate Habermas's theory in the context built by Locke, Hegel, and Mead, and examine the normative conclusions he draws from his model. The fourth chapter is the crux of the work. It aims to present the theory of discourse ethics in as clear a form as possible. I make some new suggesstion on how to interpret it. The final chapter deals with the question of moral realism and objectivity. I argue against realist interpretations of discourse ethics {{on the grounds that the}} theory's distinctive character of second person justification would be lost in them. Endast sammandrag.

40|$|The study {{assesses the}} {{rationality}} of the mobility {{policy of the}} Dutch Ministry of Spatial Planning. The theoretical framework {{of the study is}} based in an overview of the different perspectives of rationality in planning theory. Based on insights from argumentation theory, four 'ideal' positions of rationality are distinguished. Each of these positions refers to a different way in which the rationality of a policy can and should be assessed. The study continues with a <b>communicative</b> perspective on <b>rationality.</b> According to this perspective an ultimate judgement of the rationality of a policy is not possible. The study therefore provides two criticial contributions to the ongoing debate about the rationality of the mobility policy of the Dutch Ministry of Spatial Planning. The first critical contribution focusses on the argumentation for the policy. It is concluded that the policy is based on a very narrow search for the right - and therefore rational - course of action. The Ministry of Spatial Planning claims a position as 'problem-owner' without questioning whether the ministry is the most suited actor to achieve a reduction in the growth of car-based travel. The second critical contribution consists of an empirical test of several assumptions underlying the mobility policy. The results of the test point out, first, that - contrary to the assumption held by the Ministry of Spatial Planning - the mobility problem in urban regions in The Netherlands is not caused by a decentralization of labour-intensive employment. Second, the results show that the location of labour-intensive employment near public tranportation nodes does not lead to a substantial improvement in the accessibility by sustainable modes of transport. The study concludes suggesting that the Ministry of Spatial Planning should re-evaluate its present policy to reduce car-based travel by using spatial instruments, and instead focus on influencing the decisions on transport infrastructure...|$|R
40|$|In autumn 2006, the Knowledge Promotion Reform (Kunnskapsløftet) was {{introduced}} in the 10 -year compulsory school and in upper secondary education and training in Norway. The transition to an information/knowledge-based society was the explicit basis for this reform, and schools were provided with newfound freedom in order to adapt the development of learning activities to local conditions. But this freedom was to be controlled. The objectives and competence aims were therefore defined and formulated on a national ministry level, but the responsibility for achieving targets were located locally on each school. This is a targetoriented management paradigm we know from the concept of New Public Management. But research on how the Knowledge Promotion Reform has been conducted has revealed that the bureaucratic system does not rely on teachers and local forces' ability and willingness to implement the reform as intended. They view a strictly instrumental implementation as the best way to ensure intended results, for example by nationally standardized tests. Yet, research also reveals that there are minor collegiate groups at each school who, by their own means, are doing development work initiated through the reform. The main research question discussed in this paper is: How can a communicative reform implementation contribute to school development and pupils' and teachers' learning opportunities as intended in the Knowledge Promotion Reform? The central theme is how school development can be introduced in the transition to an information/knowledge-based society, and how learning and school development can occur through communicative work of reforms in the school organization. The theme will be elaborated through both empirical analyses and theoretical discussions. The key theoretical perspective in this paper is Jürgen Habermas's theories on <b>communicative</b> and instrumental <b>rationality</b> and reason, and Gunnar Berg's “friromsmodell”(1999) for school development. This model shows how the school can develop in the gap between the legaland the legitimate framework. The most important findings provided in this paper are how communicative and collaborative implementation can contribute to a hermeneutic and more complete understanding of the reform. In addition it shows how deliberative procedures continually place the existing practice in a critical light, which again may contribute to school development...|$|R

40|$|The {{cumulative}} dissertation {{consists of}} the following three articles: (Article 1) Grobe, Christian 2009 : Wie billig ist Reden wirklich? Kommunikative vs. strategische Rationalität in einem experimentellen Diktatorspiel, in: Zeitschrift für Internationale Beziehungen, 16 : 2, 269 - 297. Since {{the onset of the}} "ZIB debate" the theory of communicative action has witnessed an in-teresting evolutionary process, with institutional explanations for argument-based changes in agent's behavior moving into focus. At the same time, behavioral game theorists – practically unnoticed by political scientists – have broadened the foundations of traditional rational choice theory. Equipped with findings from laboratory experiments, they found numerous ways to explain changes in agent's behavior as a result of strategic action. By leaving these rationalist explanations aside, the validity of commonly used counterfactual proofs of com-municative action, via the institutional context, is threatened. To avoid the resulting danger of bias, the article puts forth a new definition of the relation between <b>communicative</b> and strate-gic <b>rationality.</b> Subsequently, it builds on this definition in order to measure the relative ex-planatory power of the two approaches by means of a laboratory experiment. The article thus shows how the adopted experimental method can supplement empirical field research, and therefore deserves to {{become an integral part of}} the standard toolkit used by political scien-tists. (Article 2) Grobe, Christian 2010 : The Power of Words: Argumentative Persuasion in International Negotiations, in: European Journal of International Relations 16 : 1, 5 - 29. Throughout the last two decades international negotiations have been predominantly ana-lysed from the perspective of rationalist bargaining theory. But most recently, constructivists have pointed to a different mechanism that may facilitate agreement among multiple parties: processes of argumentation. Indeed, numerous empirical studies were successful in showing that words have the power to change the initial bargaining position of an actor and thereby impact on the outcome of multilateral negotiations. Rationalists have so far been unable to capture this important role of argumentative talk within their conceptual framework. There-fore, this article introduces a theory of rational persuasion, which I call functional persuasion theory. According to this theory argument- based changes in bargaining positions are entirely belief-driven and are not due to a reformulation of agents’ preferences, as constructivists hold. The explanatory power of functional persuasion theory is demonstrated in the empirical part of this article by testing it against the most prominent constructivist explanations of ar-gumentative persuasion. (Article 3) Grobe, Christian 2011 : Die Lücke, die der empiristische rational-choice-Ansatz lässt, in: Zeitschrift für Internationale Beziehungen, 18 : 1, 109 - 124. Building bridges between rationalist and constructivist theories of international relations has become a discipline-wide effort over the last years. This article offers a critical assessment of the latest approach in this intellectual tradition put forth by Johannes Marx. Drawing on work by experimental economists I show why it is not possible to reconstruct rational choice theory as universal hard core of IR. Since this step required theorizing an endogenous change of preferences, as Marx argues, it would overstretch the rationalist approach. In order to avoid this undesirable effect, I will introduce an alternative conception of rational action. This conception, its commitment to fixed preferences notwithstanding, offers an integrative perspective on the current debate between rationalist and constructivists with a specific focus on bar- gaining and arguing in inter...|$|R

50|$|German {{philosophers}} Jürgen Habermas and Karl-Otto Apel {{are considered}} the originators of modern discourse ethics. Habermas's discourse ethics is his attempt to explain the implications of <b>communicative</b> <b>rationality</b> {{in the sphere of}} moral insight and normative validity. It is a complex theoretical effort to reformulate the fundamental insights of Kantian deontological ethics in terms of the analysis of communicative structures. This means that it is an attempt to explain the universal and obligatory nature of morality by evoking the universal obligations of <b>communicative</b> <b>rationality.</b> It is also a cognitivist moral theory, which means it holds that justifying the validity of moral norms can be done in a manner analogous to the justification of facts.

50|$|Within sociology, Habermas's major {{contribution}} was {{the development of}} a comprehensive theory of societal evolution and modernization focusing on the difference between <b>communicative</b> <b>rationality</b> and rationalization on one hand and strategic / instrumental rationality and rationalization on the other.

50|$|In {{its essence}} {{the idea of}} <b>communicative</b> <b>rationality</b> draws upon the {{implicit}} validity claims that are inescapably bound to the everyday practices of individuals capable of speech and action. A mutual understanding can be achieved through communication only by fusing the perspectives of individuals, which requires they reach an agreement (even if it is only assumed) on {{the validity of the}} speech acts being shared. Moreover, the speech acts shared between individuals in communication are laden with three different types of validity claims, all of which quietly but insistently demand to be justified with good reasons. <b>Communicative</b> <b>rationality</b> appears in the intuitive competencies of communicative actors who would not feel that a mutual understanding had been achieved if the validity claims raised were unjustifiable. Thus, the simple process of reaching an understanding with others impels individuals to be accountable for what they say {{and to be able to}} justify the validity claims they raise concerning normative (WE), evaluative (I) and objective matters (IT).|$|E
