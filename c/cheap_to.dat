The game also features 3D cutscenes, which the future visual novel writer Kotaro Uchikoshi created 3D models for. While an American publisher did look into acquiring the rights to publish {{the game in the}} United States, it ended up being a Japan-exclusive game.|$|E
5|$|The {{pendulum}} clock {{remained the}} most accurate timekeeper until the 1930s, when quartz oscillators were invented, followed by atomic clocks after World War 2. Although initially limited to laboratories, the development of microelectronics in the 1960s made quartz clocks both compact and <b>cheap</b> <b>to</b> produce, and by the 1980s they became the world's dominant timekeeping technology in both clocks and wristwatches.|$|E
5|$|At the 1932 occasion, Tesla {{claimed he}} had invented a motor that would run on cosmic rays. In 1933, at age 77, Tesla told reporters that, after thirty-five years of work, {{he was on the}} verge of {{producing}} proof of a new form of energy. He claimed it was a theory of energy that was “violently opposed” to Einsteinian physics, and could be tapped with an apparatus that would be <b>cheap</b> <b>to</b> run and last 500 years. He also told reporters he was working on a way to transmit individualized private radio wavelengths, working on breakthroughs in metallurgy, and developing a way to photograph the retina to record thought.|$|E

5|$|During the British Civil Wars (mid-17th {{century in}} Great Britain), both the Parliamentarian and Royalist armies used various {{incendiary}} devices to attack enemies and destroy property {{that might be}} used for military purposes, according to historian Stephen Porter in Destruction in the English Civil Wars. The flaming arrow attack was used to set fire to buildings at a distance. An arrow with a flammable substance attached to the shaft, close to the tip, was shot from a bow or short-muzzled musket. Such arrows shot from a musket had their feathers removed, to fit inside the muzzle, and were called fire-darts. These devices were <b>cheap</b> <b>to</b> make and easy to prepare. Although used infrequently during the wars, the flaming arrows and darts proved to be destructive. The Royalists shot flaming arrows into the thatched homes {{in the suburbs of}} Chester causing extensive damage. Lyme Regis was partly razed using flaming arrows.|$|E
5|$|For {{symbolic}} memorials, numerous {{designs were}} possible, from simple monuments through to {{much more complex}} pieces of sculpture. Obelisks had been a popular memorial form in the 19th century and remained so in the inter-war years, including in Britain, France, Australia and Romania. One factor in this popularity was that obelisks were relatively <b>cheap</b> <b>to</b> build, while they also fitted well with the existing civic architecture in many towns. Memorial plaques were another popular memorial style around the world. Soldiers, either individually or in groups, were a popular sculptural feature in most countries, portrayed in various stances; typically these were allegorical, although in France {{the style of the}} soldier could also carry political meaning and reflect local political sympathies. Although the trend pre-dated the First World War, very few Western war memorials portrayed heroic commanding officers, as had been popular earlier in the 19th century; if soldiers were depicted, they were invariably ordinary soldiers, usually infantrymen. After the unveiling of the Cenotaph in London, it became a popular design in many other locations in Britain and Australia too.|$|E
5|$|The Battle for Middle-earth II {{introduces}} {{three new}} factions with unique units and heroes: Goblins, Dwarves, and Elves. Rohan and Gondor {{are combined into}} one faction called Men of the West. Along with Mordor and Isengard from , there are six playable factions. The troops of Gondor provide a solid offense and defense with standard infantry and archers, and the Rohirrim of Rohan act as elite cavalry. The Elven archers are effective at inflicting damage from a distance, and their support units, the Ents, can perform a combination of melee and siege attacks, they are often considered the strongest defensive faction due to their strong missile units and powerful 'silverthorn arrows'. Although slow and expensive, Dwarven infantry, pikemen, and axe-throwers are very powerful and well-armored allowing them to prevail in even the longest clashes with enemy troops. A collection of wild creatures and beasts of Middle-earth make up the Goblin faction, this includes goblins, trolls, spiders, and dragons, which are effective in large numbers. Their only advantage is that the goblin archer and soldier units are <b>cheap</b> <b>to</b> make at only 75 resources and build faster than other basic infantry. Isengard troops are highly trained Uruk-hai under Saruman's command. Berserkers are used by Isengard as one-man armies that move extremely fast and deal significant damage (particularly to enemy buildings and heroes). Additionally, Isengard is the only Evil faction that can build walls. Mordor forces are a mixture of Orcs, Men, Trolls, Mumakil, and Sauron's lieutenants. Mordor Orcs have tough armor, making them useful for absorbing enemy damage while stronger units attack enemies. Trolls contribute greatly to the Mordor offensives, having strong melee attacks {{and the ability to}} throw boulders or wield trees like swords.|$|E

These were relatively <b>cheap</b> <b>to</b> produce – having a one-piece die-cast metal body, a base plate and or windows on some, and plastic wheels. There was the added bonus of being able to compete in the small-scale toy car market which, at the time was dominated by Lesney's Matchbox (see Force 1988, p.47).|$|E

25|$|Perovskite {{solar cells}} are solar cells {{that include a}} perovskite-structured {{material}} as the active layer. Most commonly, this is a solution-processed hybrid organic-inorganic tin or lead halide based material. Efficiencies have increased from below 5% at their first usage in 2009 to over 20% in 2014, making them a very rapidly advancing technology and a hot topic in the solar cell field. Perovskite solar cells are also forecast to be extremely <b>cheap</b> <b>to</b> scale up, making them a very attractive option for commercialisation.|$|E
25|$|Automatic flush {{facilities}} can be retrofitted {{to existing}} systems. The handle-operated valves of a manual {{system can be}} replaced with a suitably designed self-contained electronic valve, often battery-powered to avoid the need to add cables. Older timed-flush installations may add a device that regulates the water flow to the cistern according to the overall activity detected in the room. This does not provide true per-fixture automatic flushing, but is simple and <b>cheap</b> <b>to</b> add because only one device {{is required for the}} whole system.|$|E
25|$|The Model T was {{introduced}} on October 1, 1908. It had {{the steering wheel}} on the left, which every other company soon copied. The entire engine and transmission were enclosed; the four cylinders were cast in a solid block; the suspension used two semi-elliptic springs. The car was very simple to drive, and easy and <b>cheap</b> <b>to</b> repair. It was so cheap at $825 in 1908 ($ today) (the price fell every year) that by the 1920s, a majority of American drivers had learned to drive on the Model T.|$|E

25|$|This simple {{design is}} {{effective}} and <b>cheap</b> <b>to</b> build, but it wastes some power continuously. Later models, especially Energy Star rated ones, use a relay to switch the entire degaussing circuit on and off, {{so that the}} degaussing circuit uses energy only when it is functionally active and needed. The relay design also enables degaussing on user demand through the unit's front panel controls, without switching the unit off and on again. This relay can often be heard clicking off {{at the end of}} the degaussing cycle a few seconds after the monitor is turned on, and on and off during a manually initiated degaussing cycle.|$|E
25|$|The Winchester Liberator is a 16-gauge, four-barrelled shotgun, {{similar to}} a scaled-up four-shot {{double-action}} derringer. It was an implementation of the Hillberg Insurgency Weapon design. Robert Hillberg, the designer, envisioned a weapon that was <b>cheap</b> <b>to</b> manufacture, easy to use, and provided a significant chance of being effective {{in the hands of}} someone who had never handled a firearm before. Pistols and submachine guns were eliminated from consideration due to the training required to use them effectively. The shotgun was chosen because it provided a high hit probability. Both Winchester and Colt built prototypes, although the Colt eight-shot design came late in the war and was adapted for the civilian law enforcement market. No known samples were ever produced for military use.|$|E
25|$|One {{recent study}} of neuroplasticity {{involves}} work done {{by a team of}} doctors and researchers at Emory University, specifically Dr. Donald Stein and Dr. David Wright. This is the first treatment in 40 years that has significant results in treating traumatic brain injuries while also incurring no known side effects and being <b>cheap</b> <b>to</b> administer. Dr. Stein noticed that female mice seemed to recover from brain injuries better than male mice, and that at certain points in the estrus cycle, females recovered even better. This difference may be attributed to different levels of progesterone, with higher levels of progesterone leading to the faster recovery from brain injury in mice. However, clinical trials showed progesterone offers no significant benefit for traumatic brain injury human patients.|$|E
