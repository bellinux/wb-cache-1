60|$|And as I grasped it did I {{think of}} {{what it meant to}} the human race of Pellucidar--did there flash through my mind the thought that <b>countless</b> generations <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own kind yet unborn would have reason to worship me for the thing that I had {{accomplished}} for them? I did not. I thought of a beautiful oval face, gazing out of limpid eyes, through a waving mass of jet-black hair. I thought of red, red lips, God-made for kissing. And of a sudden, apropos of nothing, standing there alone in the secret chamber of the Mahars of Pellucidar, I realized that I loved Dian the Beautiful.|$|R

"Sir Thomas, however," [...] he went on, [...] "was much {{opposed to}} our union, {{on the ground}} of some real or fancied social {{disparity}} in our positions; but I at last obtained his conditional consent, if only I could succeed in obtaining the Fellowship of the Royal Society, which might, he thought, be accepted as a passport into that fashionable circle {{of which he was}} a member. Spurred on by this ambition, and by the encouragement <b>of</b> <b>my</b> Amelia, I worked day and night at the perfectioning <b>of</b> <b>my</b> great discovery, which I was assured would bring not only honour and dignity to myself, but also the alleviation and assuagement <b>of</b> pain to <b>countless</b> thousands <b>of</b> <b>my</b> fellow-creatures. I concealed the nature <b>of</b> <b>my</b> experiments, however, lest any rival investigator should enter the field with me prematurely, and share the credit to which I alone was really entitled. For some months I was successful in my efforts at concealment; but in March of this year--I mistake; of the year 1781, I should say--an unfortunate circumstance caused me to take special and exceptional precautions against intrusion.|$|R
60|$|For <b>countless</b> {{thousands}} <b>of</b> years <b>my</b> ancestors {{have lived}} and died and drawn all their breaths in the open air. It is only recently that we have begun to live in houses. The change is a hardship, especially on the lungs. I've got only one pair of lungs, and I haven't the address of any repair-shop. Wherefore I stick by the open air as much as possible. For this reason my house will have large verandas, and, near to the kitchen, {{there will be a}} veranda dining-room. Also, there will be a veranda fireplace, where we can breathe fresh air and be comfortable when the evenings are touched with frost.|$|R
40|$|I {{would like}} to thank the native {{speakers}} of Croatian who assisted me with the many tests and examples I needed to formulate my analysis- my motherin-law, Ana Draksic, my husband, Thomas Draksic, and Professor Milena ic-Fuchs of the University of Zagreb. These three people devoted a great deal of time and energy to this project, and I am greatly indebted to them. I would also like to thank those who helped me with the question of accusative subjects: Yelena Belov (Russian), Ivan Mihalevic (Croatian), and Olga Tourtchina (Russian and Ukrainian). I am extremely grateful to my advisor, Robert Van Valin, Jr., for his guidance during my entire data collection and writing process.

40|$|I {{would first}} {{like to thank}} the members <b>of</b> <b>my</b> {{dissertation}} committee for their patient support and guidance throughout my graduate school career. I am deeply grateful to Sarah Burgard, my dissertation committee chair and my favorite cheerleader. She provided much needed encouragement to pursue the research questions that interested me most, and she helped me to refine and clarify those questions. Our regular meetings kept me on track. Sarah also modeled how to achieve academic success while maintaining poise under pressure. Arland Thornton provided mentorship by inviting me to co-author a research paper. In addition, he read <b>countless</b> drafts <b>of</b> <b>my</b> solo-authored papers and gave invaluable feedback that dramatically improved the final products. Rebecca Thornton was remarkable for her generosity and her willingness to collaborate across disciplinary boundaries. Her invitation to work on her Malawi project enabled me to gather data for this dissertation and gain valuable field research experience. Collaborating with her on research projects and papers has been both rewarding and fun. I look forward to more opportunities for collaboration in the years to come.
