5|$|Architecture {{during the}} Song period reached new heights of sophistication. Authors such as Yu Hao and Shen Kuo wrote books {{outlining}} {{the field of}} architectural layouts, craftsmanship, and structural engineering in the 10th and 11th centuries, respectively. Shen Kuo preserved the written dialogues of Yu Hao when describing technical issues such as slanting struts built into pagoda towers for diagonal wind bracing. Shen Kuo also preserved Yu's specified dimensions and units of measurement for various building types. The architect Li Jie (1065–1110), who published the Yingzao Fashi ('Treatise on Architectural Methods') in 1103, greatly expanded upon the works of Yu Hao and compiled the standard building codes used by the central government agencies and by craftsmen throughout the empire. He addressed the standard methods of construction, design, and applications of moats and fortifications, stonework, greater woodwork, lesser woodwork, wood-carving, turning and drilling, sawing, bamboo work, tiling, wall building, painting and decoration, brickwork, glazed tile making, and provided proportions for mortar formulas in masonry. In his book, Li provided detailed and vivid illustrations of architectural components and cross-sections of buildings. These illustrations displayed various applications of corbel brackets, cantilever arms, mortise and tenon work of tie beams and <b>cross</b> <b>beams,</b> and diagrams showing the various building types of halls in graded sizes. He also outlined the standard units of measurement and standard dimensional measurements of all building components described and illustrated in his book.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Recently in {{the field}} of bridges that are newly built or repaired, fast {{construction}} is required more than ever. For these reasons, precast prefabricated bridge that enables rapid construction is actively discussed and studied today. In South Korea, it is called modular bridge. <b>Cross</b> <b>beam</b> is an integral component of modular bridge. It functions for load distribution, reduction of bending moment, resistance of horizontal strength on lateral upper structure. In this study, the structural characteristics of domestic and foreign <b>cross</b> <b>beam</b> types were compared. Based on this, alternative <b>cross</b> <b>beam</b> connection types suitable for modular bridge were selected. And bulb-T girder specimens were fabricated with each type of connection. The behavior of each specimen was analyzed under static loading, and <b>cross</b> <b>beam</b> connection type which is expected to be best suited to modular bridge proposed. Keywords—Bulb-T girder, <b>Cross</b> <b>beam,</b> Modular bridge...|$|R

25|$|The {{superstructure}} {{appears to}} have been made with a main section amidships, a heavy building at the stern and a smaller one at the prow. Although nothing remains of the stern and prow buildings their existence is indicated by the shorter spacing of the decks supporting <b>cross</b> <b>beams</b> and distribution of ballast. The arrangement of the seconda nave superstructures is comparable to that of the shrines depicted on an Isian lamp held by the Museum of Ostia. If not coincidental, this is further evidence of Isis worship rather than Diana.|$|E

500|$|Architectural experts {{sometimes}} {{differ in}} their interpretations of Kahn's design. [...] Why, for example, are the <b>cross</b> <b>beams</b> at the clerestory windows above the atrium so massive? Carter Wiseman says, [...] "While they appear to be—and indeed are—structural, they are far deeper than necessary; their no-less-important role was to diffuse the sunlight {{coming in from the}} surrounding clerestory windows and reflect it down into the atrium." [...] Sarah Goldhagen thinks there is more to the story, asserting that [...] "the concrete X-shaped cross below the skylit ceiling at the Exeter Library is grossly exaggerated for dramatic effect." [...] Kathleen James-Chakraborty goes even further: [...] "Above, in the most sublime gesture of all, floats a concrete cross brace, illuminated by clerestory windows. [...] Its weight, which appears ready to come crashing down upon the onlooker, revives the sense of threat dissipated elsewhere by the reassuring familiarity of the brick skin and wood details." [...] Kahn similarly floated a massive concrete structure above the sanctuary of the First Unitarian Church of Rochester, which he designed a few years earlier.|$|E
2500|$|The Rosario {{class were}} {{designed}} in 1858 by Issac Watts, the Director of Naval Construction. [...] They were built of wood, were rated for 11 guns and were built {{with a full}} ship rig of sails (this {{was reduced to a}} barque rig by about 1869). [...] With a length overall of [...] and a beam of , they had a displacement of 913 tonnes. These were the last sloops constructed for the Royal Navy to retain all-wooden construction; their successors, the Amazon class, incorporated iron <b>cross</b> <b>beams.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The World Trade Center {{was built}} using {{prefabricated}} parts which were bolted or welded {{together at the}} site. [...] This process dramatically reduced construction time and costs. [...] Using this process, t-beams {{and other types of}} <b>cross</b> <b>beams</b> were created and used in each of the World Trade Center buildings. [...] When the Twin Towers collapsed, it sent debris down onto Six World Trade Center, and gutted the interior of that building; the intact cross beam later found in 6 World Trade Center's debris is believed to have come from the North Tower.|$|E
50|$|The ride {{comprised}} a 116-foot <b>cross</b> <b>beam,</b> {{each end}} carrying a 12-arm wheel, with a circular eight-passenger cabin suspended {{from each of}} the wheel arms. One end of the <b>cross</b> <b>beam</b> would rise approximately one hundred feet as its wheel spun in a clockwise motion. The cabins could also be spun in the horizontal plane using a central steering wheel, similar to a teacup ride. After being up in the air for several minutes, and after the second wheel was loaded, the first wheel was lowered to the ground and the second wheel raised in the air. When shut down, the <b>cross</b> <b>beam</b> would rest at , both wheels dangling 40-to-50 feet off the ground.|$|R

2500|$|The {{placement}} of a dome {{in front of}} the mihrab of a mosque probably began with the rebuilding of the Prophet's Mosque in Medina by Umayyad Caliph Al-Walid. This was likely to emphasize the place of the ruler, although domes would eventually become focal points of decoration and architectural composition or indicate the direction of prayer. Later developments of this feature would include additional domes oriented axially to the mihrab dome. Byzantine workmen built the Umayyad Mosque of Damascus and its hemispherical dome for al Walid in 705. The dome rests upon an octagonal base formed by squinches. The dome, called the [...] "Dome of the Eagle" [...] or [...] "Dome of the Gable", was originally made of wood but nothing remains of it. It is supposed to have rested upon large <b>cross</b> <b>beams.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Raising a {{totem pole}} is rarely done using modern methods, even for poles {{installed}} in modern settings. Most artists use a traditional method {{followed by a}} pole-raising ceremony. The traditional method calls for a deep trench to be dug. One end of the pole is placed {{at the bottom of}} the trench; the other end is supported at an upward angle by a wooden scaffold. Hundreds of strong men haul the pole upright into its footing, while others steady the pole from side ropes and brace it with <b>cross</b> <b>beams.</b> Once the pole is upright, the trench is filled with rocks and dirt. After the raising is completed, the carver, the carver's assistants, and others invited to attend the event perform a celebratory dance next to the pole. A community potlatch celebration typically follows the pole raising to commemorate the event.|$|E
2500|$|The era of Industrial Revolution weaving {{machinery}} {{gave rise}} to technological jargon {{in places such as}} Yorkshire with a strong local dialect. [...] The resultant inscrutability of linguistic terms has given rise to such jokes as the one from Monty Python's Trouble at Mill sketch: One on't <b>cross</b> <b>beams</b> gone owt askew on treadle. This nonsense may have been written so on the script as a joke, but what Graham Chapman could have said correctly in dialect is, [...] "One o't crossbeams 'as gone out o' skew on't treadle", meaning [...] "One of the crossbeams has gone askew on the treadle". The treadle was a rocking pedal, powered by the worker's foot. [...] The treadle in turn powered a reciprocating beam, and the power from that was transferred to the machinery. On a loom, these reciprocating beams were called lams, and were connected with the treadles by strings which were also connected with jacks to work the yelds. [...] In big factories, power could be transferred from one large drive wheel to another across a wide room via a reciprocating beam, called in that situation a crossbeam. Out of skew is a dialect expression meaning in incorrect position. Whether a foot-driven treadle could power a mighty crossbeam is a moot point, and may be a joke in itself, but the explanation of the above phrase and its humour is tightly connected with the mechanism of the weaving machinery described below.|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} {{articles}} is presented on a passive, optical, <b>cross</b> <b>beam</b> system. The passive, optical, <b>cross</b> <b>beam</b> system was evaluated as a remote sensor of atmospheric conditions. The system employed the light scattered from natural aerosols to sense atmospheric mean and turbulent motion. A space-time correlation of the output of two optical sensors {{was used to evaluate}} the mean convective wind speed. In approximately 20 % of the tests, signal-to-noise levels were sufficient to allow estimation of convective wind speeds. The feasibility of employing intersecting beams to evaluate the atmospheric turbulent motion was also investigated. The intersecting beams produced maximums in the space-time correlation curves for other than zero delay. The non-zero time delay maximums indicate the <b>cross</b> <b>beam</b> system was detecting aerosol layers in the atmosphere, rather than information from the common intersecting volume...|$|R
60|$|Two {{somewhat}} memorable {{circumstances in}} the annals of the Bell Rock attended the operations of this day: one was the removal of Mr. James Dove, the foreman smith, with his apparatus, from the rock to {{the upper part of the}} beacon, where the forge was now erected on a temporary platform, laid on the <b>cross</b> <b>beams</b> or upper framing. The other was the artificers having dined for the first time upon the rock, their dinner being cooked on board of the yacht, and sent to them by one of the boats. But what afforded the greatest happiness and relief was the removal of the large bellows, which had all along been a source of much trouble and perplexity, by their hampering and incommoding the boat which carried the smiths and their apparatus.|$|E

The rooms were very comfortable, with large <b>cross</b> <b>beams,</b> high wainscots, and small windows in deep embrasures. Mr. Spicer's furniture was there, and to be sold at a valuation, and Major Pendennis agreed on his nephew's behalf to take the available part of it, laughingly however declining (as, indeed, Pen did for his own part) six sporting prints, and four groups of opera-dancers with gauze draperies, which formed the late occupant's pictorial collection.|$|E
