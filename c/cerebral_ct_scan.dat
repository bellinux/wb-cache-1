40|$|Objective: to {{evaluate}} the frequency {{and the types of}} <b>cerebral</b> <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> alterations in patients with ocular lesions caused by congenital toxoplasmosis. Methods: the patients should fit one of the following criteria: reagent IgM serology for toxoplasmosis at birth and mother with positive serology for toxoplasmosis; age less than ten years, with bilateral funduscopic lesions compatible with toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis; or reagent IgG serology for toxoplasmosis and mother with positive serology for toxoplasmosis. All patients were submitted to noncontrast <b>cerebral</b> <b>CT</b> <b>scan.</b> Results: twenty-two patients participated in this study (44 eyes). Thirteen eyes presented macular lesions (29. 5 %), eight had peripheral lesions (18. 2 %) and 22 eyes had concomitant macular and peripheral lesions (50 %). Seventeen patients presented radiological alterations (77. 3 %). Among these, sixteen patients (94. 1 %) presented brain calcifications, two patients (11. 7 %) presented ventricular dilation, two patients (11. 7 %) had hydrocephalus, one had hydranencephaly (5. 9 %), one presented porencephalic cyst (cerebral hemiatrophy) (5. 9 %), one had arachnoid cyst (5. 9 %) and one had mild dilation of ventricles and subarachnoid cistern (5. 9 %). Conclusions: patients diagnosed with congenital toxoplasmosis and ocular lesions should be investigated for concomitant neuroradiologic alterations.

40|$|The first aim was {{to recruit}} and analyse a high quality dataset of <b>cerebral</b> FDG PET <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> in neurologically normal children. Using qualitative, semi-quantitative and {{statistical}} parametric mapping (SPM) techniques, {{the results showed that}} a pattern of FDG uptake similar to adults does not occur by one year of age as was previously believed, but the regional FDG uptake changes throughout childhood driven by differing age related regional rates of increasing FDG uptake. The second {{aim was to}} use this normal dataset in the clinical analysis of <b>cerebral</b> FDG PET <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> in children with epilepsy and Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF 1). The normal dataset was validated for single-subject-versus-group SPM analysis and was highly specific for identifying the epileptogenic focus likely to result in a good post-operative outcome in children with epilepsy.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the prevalence of}} anterior cerebral artery infarcts {{in the context of}} transfalcial herniation, 1100 <b>cerebral</b> <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> were reviewed. Three patients had acute intracranial hemorrhages resulting in transfalcial herniation and subsequent focal ipsi-lateral paracentral lobule or superior frontal gyrus infarcts. The infarcts are presumed to have resulted from compression and compromise of the terminal portions of the callosomarginal artery against the falx. Callosomarginal infarcts are reflective of severe, acute hemispheric insult. As such, they seem to portend a declining clinical condition, and thus may provide another CT indication of a poor clinical outcome. When large enough, intracranial space-occupying lesions cause the brain to herniate under the falx, over the free tentorial margin, through the tentorial hiatus, over the sphenoid wing, or through the foramen magnum. Such herniation may be accompanied by vascular compression and compromise of blood supply. The most commonly recognized vascular syndromes are those caused by transtentorial herniation of the medial temporal lobe. Brainstem hemorrhage results from defor...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{idiopathic}} {{intracranial hypertension}} (IIH) {{can lead to}} a fatal issue in presence of an Arnold-Chiari malformation (ACM). METHOD: We report the case of an obese pregnant woman presenting intracranial hypertension without <b>cerebral</b> <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> anomaly. The situation worsened in spite of acetazolamide use: alteration of the neurologic state and the ocular motility. RESULTS: A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows a type I ACM. The decompression of the cerebrospinal fluid by superior way is performed (pressure at 60 mmHg, normal composition) and followed by the neurosurgical cure of the Chiari.

30|$|Quantitative {{measurement}} of the regional cerebral blood flow [rCBF] is a fundamental physiological parameter for characterizing {{the status of the}} brain tissue. RCBF measurements have important clinical implications in defining tissue ischemia [1, 2], in diagnosing neurodegenerative diseases [3], and in locating and monitoring angiogenically active tumour tissues [4, 5]. Positron-emission tomography [PET] measurements using a freely diffusible tissue tracer, oxygen- 15 -labelled water [15 O-H 2 O], is {{regarded as one of the}} rCBF gold standards [6 – 8]. This cumbersome technique requires on-line tracer production from a cyclotron and continuous arterial blood sampling. It is expensive, technically demanding, and traumatic for the patient, and is rarely found outside specialized hospital units. An attractive alternative to PET would be dynamic contrast-enhanced computed tomography [CT] or perfusion CT. Perfusion CT methodology has improved profoundly in recent years. It is now a practical technique for the clinical environment due to the development and broad introduction of fast multidetector row CT systems, increasing computer power, new image acquisition protocols, and commercially available perfusion softwares [1]. It is also relatively cheap, easy, and rapid to perform. Furthermore, in many acute medical and surgical conditions, such as stroke, head injury, and subarachnoid haemorrhage, and in radiotherapy planning, <b>cerebral</b> <b>CT</b> <b>scanning</b> is often the primary imaging modality of choice. This makes perfusion CT particularly applicable for additional tissue characterization [9]. Another interesting application has arisen with the advent of hybrid imaging techniques such as PET/CT and single photon emission computed tomography/CT. In the same examination, and with only minor additional <b>scan</b> time, perfusion <b>CT</b> can be considered as an adjunct to further visualize the vascular physiology of relevant lesions. This complements and extends the physiological tissue information obtained by PET, e.g. the glucose metabolism using 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose [10] or hypoxia using 18 F-fluoromisonidazole [11].|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION. An {{unexpectedly}} {{high incidence}} of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis {{has been reported in}} intensive care unit (ICU) patients without underlying immunosuppression. Next to the respiratory tract, the brain is most often affected by invasive aspergillosis. However, little is known about brain involvement by Aspergillus in critically ill patients. OBJECTIVES. To study demographics, risk profile, diagnosis, treatment, and outcome of central nervous system aspergillosis in ICU patients. METHODS. Retrospective analysis of proven cases of invasive cerebral aspergillosis taken from a cohort of 563 adult patients in whom Aspergillus involvement was evidenced during their ICU stay. RESULTS. Ten patients with central nervous system aspergillosis were identified. All had one or more host factors predisposing for invasive aspergillosis. Clinical presentation was subtle and, apart from unexplained fever, mostly devoid from "classical" neurological manifestations. All but one patient had proven or probable/putative invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. On <b>cerebral</b> <b>CT</b> <b>scanning,</b> lesions appeared to be either solitary and hyperdense or were multiple and randomly distributed throughout the brain. One patient presented with sole meningeal infestation. Aspergillus infection was confirmed by brain biopsy in 3 subjects. Voriconazole was used as primary treatment in only half of the patients. Nine patients died, six of them receiving antifungal treatment for less than 2 weeks. CONCLUSIONS. Central nervous system aspergillosis was not frequently observed in adult ICU patients. Diagnosis should be considered in patients at risk presenting with proven or probable/putative invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in association with suggestive neuroradiological findings. The brain most likely was affected through haematogenous dissemination from the lungs. Current treatment recommendations were not always applied and outcome remains dismal. GRANT ACKNOWLEDGMENT.

40|$|AbstractPurpose: Preoperative {{cerebral}} imaging {{has been}} considered not to be cost-effective in carotid endarterectomy (CEA) for asymptomatic carotid stenosis. Yet, silent brain infarction (SBI) {{has been associated with}} the embolization potential of a severe carotid stenosis. Thus the presence of SBI may represent an additional indication for CEA in asymptomatic patients. We examined the predictive value of preoperatively detected silent cerebral lesions on early and late outcomes in patients undergoing CEA for asymptomatic carotid stenosis. Methods: Preoperative <b>cerebral</b> tomographic (<b>CT)</b> <b>scans</b> performed on 301 asymptomatic patients undergoing 346 CEAs from 1986 to 1995 were reviewed by a single neuroradiologist blinded to patients' records. Mean follow-up was 67. 3 months (range, 24 - 130 months). The degree of internal carotid lumen reduction was measured bilaterally in all patients (602 carotid arteries); carotid stenosis of 60 % or more was found in 399 carotid arteries. Results: Of the 103 (34 %) <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> positive for <b>cerebral</b> lesions, 58 % were lacunar. No significant association was observed between the side of the <b>cerebral</b> lesion on <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> and the severity of the corresponding carotid stenosis; 38 silent lesions were detected in the 203 hemispheres ipsilateral to carotid stenoses that were less than 60 % versus 95 SBIs in the 399 hemispheres ipsilateral to carotid stenoses that were 60 % or more (19 % vs 24 %; P =. 2). There {{were no significant differences in}} the perioperative stroke/death rate in patients with or without <b>cerebral</b> <b>CT</b> lesions (2 % vs 1 %; odds ratio, 1. 94; P =. 6). Mortality rate during follow-up was 22 % in patients with preoperative SBI and 15 % in patients without SBI (P =. 1). However, actuarial survival at 10 years was shorter (P =. 02) in patients with SBI. Late stroke occurred in 11 % of patients with preoperative SBI and in 3 % of patients without preoperative SBI (P =. 006). Cox regression analysis showed that both preoperative lacunar and nonlacunar infarctions were independent predictors of late stroke (hazard ratio, 3. 6; P =. 04; and hazard ratio, 7. 1; P =. 001; respectively). Conclusion: In our experience, preoperative SBI did not occur more frequently in the hemisphere ipsilateral to asymptomatic severe carotid stenosis. Although our study lacks a medically treated control group, our data show that SBI is predictive of poor neurologic outcome in asymptomatic patients undergoing CEA. We conclude that CT before CEA, selectively applied, provides information on long-term neurologic prognosis and that a less aggressive attitude towards CEA in asymptomatic patients with SBI may be justified.

40|$|SUMMARY: We {{describe}} the neuroradiologic findings in a 7 -year-old boy with anomalous intracranial venous drainage and <b>cerebral</b> calcification. <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> demonstrated that his scalp mass was a plexus of scalp veins filled through the emissary foramen, {{and there were}} cerebral calcifications. Angiography revealed bilateral sigmoid sinus atresia {{with most of the}} intracranial venous drainage via the prominent mastoid emissary veins into dilated scalp vein. The possible relationship between cerebral calcification and anomalous intracranial venous drainage is discussed. Normally, most of the cerebral venous drainage collectsultimately into the transverse and sigmoid sinuses of the skull base, and the pathway from the dural sinuses of the pos-terior fossa into the internal jugular veins is anatomically ob-vious through the jugular foramen and numerous connec-tions with the vertebral plexus. 1, 2 In this article, we present a very rare case of bilateral sig-moid sinus atresia with most of the cerebral venous drainage through the prominent mastoid emissary vein to a plexus of dilated scalp veins, presenting as a posterior auricular mas...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} an Italian male patient, deceased at 29 years of age, affected with a syndrome characterized by childhood-onset seizures, mental disorders, motor dysfunction and bilateral palatal myoclonus. Skeletal X-ray examination showed diffuse osteopenia of the tubular bones, and cyst-like lesions in the carpal, metacarpal and tarsal bones bilaterally {{and in the}} proximal end of the right femur. Skin biopsy showed subcutaneous and adipose tissue containing membranocystic structures. <b>Cerebral</b> MR and <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> showed fronto-temporal atrophy, altered signal of the white matter and mineralization of the caudate and dentate nuclei. These findings strongly recall polycystic lipomembranous osteodysplasia with sclerosing leukoencephalopathy, but in the present case, bone alterations were not prominent; moreover, palatal myoclonus has never previously been described in this syndrome...|$|R
