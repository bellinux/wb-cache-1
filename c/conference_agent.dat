40|$|Widespread {{use of the}} Internet {{is giving}} rise {{to the need for}} {{collaborative}} applications that link users at remote sites. Many toolkits support the development of collaboration-aware applications—those developed specifically for cooperative work by multiple users. Another approach is collaboration transparency—the collaborative use of applications originally developed for a single user. When the runtime environment supports collaboration transparency, an application programmer need not write new code to make an application collaborative. Thus, collaboration transparency leverages the existing base of singleuser applications by extending them to collaborative use. In this article, we review options for providing collaboration transparency. We also discuss how collaboration transparency can be incorporated into Sun Microsystems ’ Java, the most widely used vehicle for developing interactive World Wide Web applications. Our approach is to provide collaboration transparency through event broadcasting, in which a <b>conference</b> <b>agent</b> synchronizes independent instances of an application and broadcasts only user input events. This contrasts with the more commonly used method of display broadcasting, in which all users receive a graphical depiction of the shared application but not the application itself. However, display broadcasting violates the Java runtime model of client-side processing, while requiring the <b>conference</b> <b>agent</b> to distribute large amounts of graphics data to participants through the Internet. Event broadcasting, on the other hand, conforms to the Java runtime model and requires much less data to be distributed (because only user input events are broadcast). We believe event broadcasting is a promising solution to providing collaboration transparency in Java. Unfortunately, the native platform implementations of the Java Abstract Window Toolkit do not currently provide support needed for event broadcasting, such a...|$|E
40|$|The Semantic Web {{promises}} {{to change the}} way agents navigate, harvest and utilize information on the internet. By providing a structured, distributed representation for expressing concepts and relationships defined by multiple ontologies, it is now possible for agents to read and reason about published knowledge, without the need for scrapers, information agents, and centralized ontologies. Agents can utilize this knowledge to seek and invoke other agents and web services, thus supporting navigation across the Semantic Web. We demonstrate how agents support enhanced navigation on the Semantic Web within a conference-schedule domain, and present three agent-based services: the RETSINA Calendar Agent, which reasons about schedules marked up on the Semantic Web; the DMA 2 ICal markup tranaslation agent which provides translation services between schedules grounded in different ontologies, and a <b>Conference</b> <b>Agent,</b> that invokes the Calendar Agent...|$|E
40|$|KES-AMSTA 2017, 11 th KES International <b>Conference</b> <b>Agent</b> and Multi-Agent Systems: Technology and Applications, Vilamoura, PORTUGAL, 21 -/ 06 / 2017 - 23 / 06 / 2017 Dynamic {{transportation}} applications {{have long}} been a domain of choice for the multiagent paradigm. Indeed, the presence of distributed entities, the highly dynamic character of these applications and the often presence of human actors in the system makes it very suitable for a multiagent design. This paper advocates for the primary consideration of multiagent environment design when dealing with such dynamic transportation applications. Transportation applications can greatly benefit {{from the use of}} the multiagent environment since most of them consider a dynamic geographical positioning of the system components. Indeed, the simultaneous consideration of the time and space dimensions makes the environment, which is shared and accessed by all the agents of the system, a candidate of choice to capture the dynamics of the application. The environment design can be envisioned at several levels of the system construction. It {{can be used as a}} medium for interaction between distributed entities. It could be used as a coordination entity of the system components. It can finally be designed as a mental model for the agents that they can use in their reasoning. We illustrate the possible uses of the environment with two transportation applications dealing with traveler information...|$|E

40|$|Many conference {{mobile apps}} today lack the {{intelligent}} feature to automatically generates optimal schedules based on delegates 2 ̆ 7 preferences. This entails two major challenges: (a) identifying preferences of users; and (b) given the preferences, generating a schedule that optimizes his preferences. In this paper, we specifically focus on academic conferences, where users are prompted to input their preferred keywords. Our key contribution is an integrated <b>conference</b> scheduling <b>agent</b> that automatically recognizes user preferences based on keywords, provides {{a list of}} recommended talks and optimizes user schedule based on these preferences. To demonstrate the utility of our integrated <b>conference</b> scheduling <b>agent,</b> we first demonstrated the app in the International <b>Conference</b> on Autonomous <b>Agents</b> and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 2015) and conducted a survey to collect some data, which are used to verify the results presented in this paper.

40|$|Abstract—The cloud {{computing}} paradigm has been advocated in recent video conferencing system design, which exploits the rich on-demand resources spanning multiple geographic regions of a distributed cloud, for better conferencing experience. A typ-ical architectural design in cloud environment {{is to create}} video <b>conferencing</b> <b>agents,</b> i. e., virtual machines, in each cloud site, assign users to the agents, and enable inter-user communication through the agents. Given the diversity of devices and network connectivities of the users, the agents may also transcode the conferencing streams to the best formats and bitrates. In this architecture, two key issues exist on how to effectively assign users to agents and how to identify the best agent to perform a transcoding task, which are nontrivial due to the following: (1) the existing proximity-based assignment may not be optimal in terms of inter-user delay, which fails to consider the whereabout...|$|R
