40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} process for chase-forming, {{in particular the}} chasing, cylindrical flow-turning and projection flow-turning of workpieces and a device therefor, whereby a workpiece is clamped in a clamping device, rotated and shaped {{by at least one}} <b>chasing</b> <b>tool.</b> In particular, a laser beam device is provided, said device applying a laser beam to the workpiece which is thus heated up in order to lower the yield stress and improve shaping capability, and to perform a heat treatment...|$|E
2500|$|In 1924, de Creeft {{developed}} {{the process of}} chased lead, {{the first of several}} original techniques he employed. [...] After casting the large, rough forms, he hammered, carved and incised the lead with typical <b>chasing</b> <b>tools</b> used in foundries for finishing work. Examples of sculptures made with this technique included Portrait of César Vallejo and Orchidia. Both works, made in 1924, featured solid forms with open spaces. [...] At that time no other artists attempted to use this technique.|$|R
40|$|Chasing and repoussé is a metalsmithing {{technique}} that involves using punches and hammers to transform a flat {{piece of metal}} into a raised detailed relief. This workshop will focus on learning the techniques of chasing and repoussé, and how the metal will respond to different tools used during this process. Participants will partake in working on their own chasing and repoussé piece {{as well as a}} discussion on how types of <b>chasing</b> <b>tools</b> are made and used...|$|R

50|$|Gilles Demarteau used in 1756 goldsmith's <b>chasing</b> <b>tools</b> and marking-wheels {{to shade}} {{the lines in}} a series of Trophies {{designed}} by Antoine Watteau. Jean-Charles François who was a partner of Demarteau further developed the technique further and used it to engrave the whole plate. François engraved in 1757 three etchings directly on copper in crayon manner. He then used the technique to etch three plates using different-size needles bound together. Other people who contributed to this new engraving technique included Alexis Magny and Jean-Baptiste Delafosse. François and Demarteau separated ways in 1757 over conflicts relating to who was entitled to call himself the inventor of the new technique. In 1759 Demarteau was joined in his studio by Louis-Marin Bonnet, a former pupil and collaborator of François. Bonnet engraved in that same year his first plate for Demarteau.|$|R
5000|$|An etched stipple {{technique}} {{known as}} the crayon manner, suitable for producing imitations of chalk drawings, was pioneered in France.

40|$|We {{report the}} testing and {{demonstration}} of {{an updated version}} of the <b>CHASE</b> <b>tool</b> (the HELCOM/HARMONY Chemical Status Assessment Tool) in Danish marine waters leading to a classification of ‘chemical status’. The classification is based on non-normalized data from monitoring of hazardous substances under the Danish National Aquatic Monitoring and Assessment Program, i. e. the marine sub-program. Since the classifications are based on un-normalized data, the results should be considered provisional. The background for the work is a wish by the EMODnet Chemistry project to test a tool combining data with a known quality and to tentatively map ‘problem areas’ and ‘non-problem areas’ with respect to contaminants in the marine environment. Following up on this work, next steps would include normalization of data (for sediments with respect to the content of organic matter and for biota with respect to lipid content). In a long-term perspective, we have demonstrated ‘the power of combining data’ and hopefully paved the road for a wider use of multi-metric indicator-based assessment tools...|$|R
500|$|The {{process for}} {{creating}} the basse-taille enamel areas began by marking {{the outline of the}} design and the main internal outlines on the gold with a tool called a [...] "tracer". Then the interior area was worked with <b>chasing</b> <b>tools,</b> hammering and punching rather than cutting, to form a shallow recess to hold the enamel. The more important parts of the design were modelled by varying the depth of the surface to produce different intensities of colour when the translucent enamel was added; the gold under folds of drapery often rises near the surface to create a paler highlight. In many of the recessed areas decoration was added by either engraving or punching which would show through the translucent enamel, or to facet the background so the reflections change as the viewing angle changes slightly. In these last-mentioned areas cutting tools were used. Most of the background outside the enamelled areas was decorated in the same way. After the enamel was added and fired the surfaces were cleaned up, made good and polished, including removing by scraping any bumps showing through on the reverse of the metal.|$|R
40|$|The thermal {{analysis}} {{has been widely}} applied to {{the investigation of the}} structure and of the materials of artworks. Different kind of cultural heritage have been inspected, in particular, by means of the active thermography, a technique based on the analysis of the temperature distribution at the surface of an artifact, evolving as a consequence of a given thermal stimulation. Such a technique enables to detect the presence of sub-surface defects and inhomogeneities and offers several advantages, the main one being its non destructive character. In this work we present an application of the active thermography to the study of a bronze statue. In particular, we refer to a copy of a bronze statue which can be obtained from a single original model using the indirect casting process. The artist’s original model is hence preserved by this method and {{can be used as a}} reference during the surface finishing and refinement of the casting performed by means of a variety of filing, polishing, and <b>chasing</b> <b>tools.</b> The aim of the present research is in particular to investigate the processing of bronze surfaces, giving the possibility to reveal the cold working hidden under the final polishing...|$|R

5000|$|The {{process for}} {{creating}} basse-taille enamel began by marking {{the outline of}} the design and the main internal outlines on the gold with a tool called a [...] "tracer". Then the interior area was worked, either with <b>chasing</b> <b>tools,</b> hammering and punching rather than cutting, or with chisels, to form a shallow recess to hold the enamel. The more important parts of the design were modelled by varying the depth of the surface to produce different intensities of colour when the translucent enamel was added; for example in the Royal Gold Cup the gold under folds of drapery often rises near the surface to create a paler highlight. In the example illustrated with Luke's ox the lowest lobe shows tufts of grass formed by cutting deeper into the background. In many of the recessed areas further decoration was added by either engraving or punching which would show through the translucent enamel, or to facet the background so the reflections change as the viewing angle changes slightly. Most background areas to the enamelled scenes were decorated in the same way. Finally the surfaces were cleaned up, made good and polished, perhaps including scraping off any bumps showing through on the reverse of the metal.|$|R
6000|$|Those curious {{contradictions in}} his {{character}} which I have already mentioned, showed themselves more strangely than ever. The {{man who had}} found the courage (when his blood was up) to measure himself alone and unarmed against two robbers, was now unable to enter the room in which the struggle had taken place, without trembling from head to foot. He, who had laughed at me when I begged him not {{to sleep in the}} house by himself, now had two men (a gardener and an indoor servant) domiciled at Browndown to protect him--and felt no sense of security even in that. He was constantly dreaming that the ruffian with the [...] "life-preserver" [...] was attacking him again, or that he was lying bleeding on the floor and coaxing Jicks to venture within reach of his hand. If any of us hinted at his occupying himself once more with his favorite art, he stopped his ears, and entreated us not to renew his horrible associations with the past. He would not even look at his box of <b>chasing</b> <b>tools.</b> The doctor--summoned to say what was the matter with him--told us that his nervous system had been shaken, and frankly acknowledged that {{there was nothing to be}} done but to wait until time set it right again.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Inference control can {{guarantee}} confidentiality but is costly to implement. Access control {{can be implemented}} efficiently but cannot guarantee confidentiality. Hence, it is a natural question to ask when exactly inference control becomes necessary. We characterize {{the situation in which}} it becomes possible to infer secrets without any violation of a given access control policy. For this purpose, we establish the <b>Chase</b> as a <b>tool</b> that infers secrets from previous query answers by applying a class of equality- and tuple-generating data dependencies declared over the underlying schema. Our characterization aims to exploit new opportunities for maximizing the availability of data while confidentiality is preserved dynamically and efficiently. ...|$|R
50|$|Upon {{settling}} in the house, strange occurrences, such as doors closing {{on their own}} and Steve seeing things that aren’t there, begin. These become more prevalent as time goes by, including a nightmare where Brown kills Mary in a similar fashion to how he killed his wife. While exploring the aviary she discovered earlier, Jennifer is <b>chased</b> into a <b>tool</b> shed by a zombie, only to be beaten to death by another that was hiding in there. Brian is burnt to death in a freak accident caused by the fuel leaking from the generator. Mary, who suspects it to be the man in her dream who killed Jennifer, finds her corpse.|$|R
50|$|The Amos Chase House and Mill are a {{historic}} property on New Hampshire Route 114, {{just south of}} the Piscataquog River in Weare, New Hampshire. The house is a 2-1/2 Greek Revival two-family house built c. 1836. It has two similar five-bay facades (southeast and northeast) with central entries framed by pilasters and topped by architraves. The adjacent mill building is also a wood-frame structure, built c. 1849. Both buildings have seen only modest and superficial alteration since their construction. The mill is the only surviving 19th-century mill building in Weare, out of a cottage industry that once saw a dozen or more such buildings. This mill {{was the only one in}} the town to survive the New England Hurricane of 1938, although its waterwheel was washed away. The mill race providing water to the mill from the Piscataquog is still visible on the property, as is a dam built by Chase. <b>Chase</b> was a <b>tool</b> manufacturer; his son later used the mill in the manufacture of baskets.|$|R
