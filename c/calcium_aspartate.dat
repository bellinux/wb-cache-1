50|$|Aspartate and {{glutamate}} are excitatory neurotransmitters. At {{high doses}} (consumed either independently or {{in excess of}} other protein-containing foods), can potentially stimulate neurons {{to the point of}} injury or death. The most compelling evidence that glutamate and aspartate function as neurotransmitters came from the observation that at low concentrations they excite virtually every neuron in the central nervous system. Excitotoxicity has been identified in animal studies and found that aspartic acid loads on the same brain receptors as glutamic acid, causing brain lesions and neuroendocrine disorders, and to act in an additive fashion with glutamic acid.When considering aspartate sources individually, the levels of exposure estimated in this opinion amount up to 6 g/day for <b>calcium</b> <b>aspartate</b> (equivalent to 100 mg/kg bw/day for a 60 kg individual), 5.8 g/day for magnesium aspartate (equivalent to 97 mg/kg bw/day), 4 g/day for potassium aspartate (equivalent to 67 mg/kg bw/day), 0.05 g/day for zinc aspartate (0.8 mg/kg bw/day) and 0.008 g/day for copper aspartate (0.1 mg/kg bw/day). These values are all below those reported to induce amino acid imbalance in intervention trials (6.3 g aspartate/day) and they are, respectively, 7, 7.2, 10.5, 875 and 7000 times lower than the NOAEL for aspartate identified from a 90-day rat study. Based on these margins of safety, the Panel concludes that the use of zinc and copper aspartate, as sources of zinc and copper at the proposed use levels, are not of safety concern but that the use of calcium, magnesium and potassium aspartate could be of safety concern because the margins of safety are considered too low. The Panel notes that if all sources would be used simultaneously, combined exposure will be 16 g/day (equivalent to 267 mg/kg bw/day), which is above the reported amounts inducing amino acid imbalance in intervention trials (6.3 g/day). Furthermore, this value is only 3 times lower than the NOAEL from the rat study and due to the low margin of safety the Panel considers this of safety concern. The Panel estimates that the exposure to aspartate from these food supplements should be added to the aspartate exposure arising from the diet.Based on US data, estimates of the mean exposure to aspartic acid arising from the diet are 4.1 g/day (children 1-3 year old) to 9.3 g/day (males 19-30 year old) and at the 95th percentile 6.6 g/day (children 4-8 year old) to 12.9 g/day (males 19-50 year old). Under these conditions, estimates of maximum daily exposure to aspartate ions from the diet (13 g/day) and from calcium or magnesium aspartate supplements would be approximately 19 g/day6, and from potassium aspartate would be 17 g/day. Aspartate exposure estimates from zinc or copper supplementation would not significantly change aspartate exposure from the diet. Taken individually these levels of exposure are lower than those reported to induce amino acid imbalance in intervention trials, when aspartate exposure from the diet is also taken into consideration (19.3 g/day). However, when considering the potential total intake of aspartic ions arising from the diet and from a potential multi-mineral combination of all food supplements the exposure could add up to 29 g/day. In line with the SCF concerns, the Panel considers that the use of L-amino acids in food supplements should not give rise to a nutritional imbalance of the amino acids. Thus the Panel concludes that under these conditions aspartate ion exposure from a multi-mineral combination of this type could be of safety concern.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Single {{pressure}} {{injections of}} 1 - 2 mM <b>calcium</b> <b>aspartate</b> into the light-sensitive region of Limulus ventral photoreceptors {{resulted in a}} rapid, 20 - 40 -mV depolarization lasting- 2 s. The depolarization closely followed the rise in intracellular free calcium caused by the injection, as indicated by aequorin luminescence. The depolarization was followed by reversible desensitization (adaptation) of responses to both light and inositol 1, 4, 5 trisphosphate. Similar single injections of calcium into the light-insensitive region of the receptor were essentially without effect, even though aequorin luminescence indicated a large, rapid rise in intracellular free calcium. The depolarization caused by injection of calcium arose from the activation of an inward current with rectification characteristics and a reversal potential between + 10 and + 20 mV that {{were similar to those}} of the light-activated conductance, which suggests that the same channels were activated by light and by calcium. The reversal potentials of the light- and calcium-activated currents shifted similarly when three-fourths of the extracellular sodium was replaced by sucrose, but were not affected by a similar replacement of sodium by lithium. The current activated by calcium was abolished by prior injection ofa calcium buffer solution containing EGTA. The responses of the same cells to brief light flashes were slowed and diminished in amplitude, but were not abolished after the injection of calcium buffer. Light adaptation and prior injection of calcium diminished the calcium-activated current much less than they diminished the light-activated current...|$|E

This {{study was designed to}} investigate and compare the effects of LMWH (Bemiparin) and Heparin on hemodynamic parameters, liver and renal function tests and platelet indices of saltloaded uninephrectomized hypertensive rats. The experimental rats divided into two groups. The first group included 18 hypertensive rats. Hypertension induced by unilateral nephrectomy and high NaCl loading with 4 % NaCl in diet for 4 weeks. The rat models were subdivided into three groups, each subgroup consists of six rats. The first subgroup served as a positive control. The second subgroup received a daily intraperitoneal (I.

This study was carried out {{to determine the effects}} of daily consumption of probiotic yoghurt on serum calcium and iron levels and liver enzymes among Iranian healthy pregnant women. Methods: In this controlled clinical trial, 70 primigravida pregnant women carrying singleton pregnancy at their third trimester were participated. Participants were randomly divided into two groups of consuming 200 g/d of conventional (n = 33) or probiotic yogurts (n = 37) for 9 weeks. The probiotic yogurt contained Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium lactis with a total of min 1 × 10 7 CFU. To measure serum <b>calcium,</b> iron, <b>aspartate</b> aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, blood samples were drawn in a fasting state at baseline and after 9 weeks intervention. Results: Consumption of probiotic yogurt resulted in maintaining serum calcium levels compared with the conventional yogurt (P = 0. 01). Within-group differences in the conventional yogurt group revealed a significant reduction of serum calcium levels (− 1. 7 mg/dL, P < 0. 0001).

40|$|Objective: Several {{inflammatory}} markers {{have been}} studied as potential biomarkers in renal cell carcinoma (RCC), however few reports have analyzed their prognostic value in aggregate and in non-clear cell histologies. We hypothesize {{that a combination of}} specific inflammatory markers into an RCC Inflammatory Score (RISK) could serve as a rigorous prognostic indicator of overall survival (OS) in patients with clear cell and non-clear cell RCC. Methods: Combination of preoperative C-reactive protein (CRP), albumin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), corrected <b>calcium,</b> and <b>aspartate</b> transaminase to alanine transaminase (AST/ALT) ratio was used to develop RISK. RISK was developed using grid-search methodology, receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) analysis, and sensitivity-specificity trade-off analysis. Prognostic value of RISK was analyzed using the Kaplan–Meier method and Cox proportional regression models. Predictive accuracy was compared with RISK to Size, Size, Grade, and Necrosis (SSIGN) score, University of California-LOS Angeles (UCLA) Integrated Staging System (UISS), and Leibovich Prognosis Score (LPS). Results: Among 391 RCC patients treated with nephrectomy, area under the curve (AUC) for RISK was 0. 783, which was comparable to SSIGN (AUC 0. 776, p =  0. 82) and UISS (AUC 0. 809, p =  0. 317). Among patients with localized disease, AUC for RISK and LPS was 0. 742 and 0. 706, respectively (p =  0. 456). On multivariate analysis, we observed a step-wise statistically significant inverse relationship between increasing RISK group and OS (all p <  0. 001). Conclusion: RISK is an independent and significant predictor of OS for patients treated with nephrectomy for clear cell and non-clear cell RCC, with accuracy comparable to other histopathological prognostic tools...|$|R
40|$|Phospholipase A 2 catalyzes the {{specific}} hydrolysis of the sn- 2 acyl bond of various glycerophospholipids, producing fatty acids and lysophospholipids. Phospholipase A 2 s (PLA 2 s) constitute a large superfamily of enzymes whose products {{are important for}} a multitude of signal transduction processes, lipid mediator release, lipid metabolism, development, plant stress responses, and host defense. The crystal structure of rice (Oryza sativa) isoform 2 phospholipase A 2 has been determined to 2. 0 Å resolution using sulfur SAD phasing, and shows that the class XIb phospholipases have a unique structure compared with other secreted PLA 2 s. The N-terminal half of the chain contains mainly loop structure, including the conserved Ca 2 +-binding loop, but starts with a short 310 -helix and also includes two short anti-parallel β-strands. The C-terminal half is folded into three anti-parallel α-helices, of which the two first are also present in other secreted PLA 2 s and contain the conserved catalytic histidine and <b>calcium</b> liganding <b>aspartate</b> residues. The structure is stabilized by six disulfide bonds. The water structure around the calcium ion binding site suggests the involvement of a second water molecule in the mechanism for hydrolysis, the water-assisted calcium-coordinate oxyanion mechanism. The octanoate molecule in the complex structure is bound in a hydrophobic pocket, which extends to the likely membrane interface and is proposed to model the binding of the product fatty acid. Due to the differences in structure, the suggested surface for binding to the membrane has a different morphology in the rice PLA 2 compared with other phospholipases...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to assess northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) reproduction and adult health in relation to central Idaho habitat quality. Productivity was measured at 34 nests during 1998 and 1999. Mean productivity was 2. 1 fledglings per successful nest in 1998 and 2. 0 fledglings per successful nest in 1999. In both years 1. 5 young fledged per occupied nests. The nest failure rate in 1998 was 17 % and 21 % in 1999. Nestling growth, measured in days to reach 90 % of fledging mass, ranged from 16 to 35 days for 24 nestlings. The fastest mean growth at a nest was 16 days to reach 90 % while the slowest mean growth was 33 days to 90 % of fledging mass. I used mean levels of seven metabolic substances to describe metabolic health in the adult breeding goshawks. Levels of protein, cholesterol, <b>calcium,</b> uric acid, <b>aspartate</b> aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase were variable among the 29 adults sampled but comparable to data reported for other raptors. There {{were no significant differences between}} males and females in these substances. Corticosterone, the stress response hormone, was measured in two blood samples to index the stress response to capture and handling. Both increasing and decreasing levels of corticosterone were observed over a 30 -minute holding period. These variable results may be due to individual variation, complications involved in trapping breeding goshawks, or stress modulation during the breeding season. An alternative measure of stress was determined from differential white blood cell counts. The ratio of heterophils to lymphocytes has been used as a measure of chronic stress in birds and was calculated for 29 goshawks in this study. Heterophil/lymphocyte ratios were not correlated with corticosterone in the goshawk samples. Total white blood cell estimates provided a representation of immune system health and were within ranges reported for captive goshawks. Blood parasites were identified along with white blood cells and were common among the sampled goshawks. A body condition ratio was calculated using mass, wing length, tail length, and culmen. Body condition results indicated that only birds in average to good condition were breeding. I also assessed body condition on the basis of muscle mass and fault bars and found little significant variability. Of all the physiological measures only body condition was related to nestling growth. No adult health variables were related to productivity. Finally, all reproductive and adult health data were used to validate the results of a goshawk habitat potential model. The model was developed for the Intermountain West and scored habitat based on vegetation and landform features at the nest area and post- fledging area scales. The model also identified and scored suitable 1 ha nests sites. All occupied nest sites from this study were within the range of suitable sites identified by the model. Productivity results from 25 nests were not associated with habitat quality at either scale. Nestling growth rates at 12 nests were lower as habitat quality increased at both scales inverse to the expected relationship. Adult health measures showed variable associations at both scales. Male protein levels increased with increasing habitat quality, as expected, and female white blood cell estimates and heterophil/lymphocyte ratios decreased with increasing post-fledging area quality as would be expected. A study including home range quality assessment, more replicates, and additional years of data collection would improve the reliability of the model validation...|$|R
