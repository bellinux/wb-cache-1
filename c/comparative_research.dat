25|$|Several studies {{reveal that}} France seems to be, among the Western countries, {{the one where}} Muslims {{integrate}} the best and feel the most for their country.

On the other hand, a 2013 IPSOS survey published by the French daily Le Monde indicated that only 26% of French respondents believed that Islam was compatible with French society (compared to 89% identifying Catholicism as compatible and 75% identifying Judaism as compatible). A thorough survey by the Pew Research Center in Spring 2014 revealed that out of all Europeans, the French view Muslim minorities most favorably with 72% having a favourable opinion.|$|E

Șăineanu's studies also focused on a <b>comparative</b> <b>research</b> of building rituals as found in Balkan literature, and notably the Romanian Meșterul Manole myth (the book saw print in French, as the 1902 Les rites de la construction d'après la poésie populaire de l'Europe Orientale).

2500|$|Autessere's second book, Peaceland: Conflict Resolution and the Everyday Politics of International Intervention, was {{released}} by Cambridge University Press in 2014 and focuses on the everyday elements that influence peacebuilding interventions on the ground.

[...] The book suggests a new explanation for why international peace interventions so often fail to reach their full potential. It demonstrates that everyday elements – such as the expatriates’ social habits and common approaches to understanding their areas of operation – strongly influence peacebuilding effectiveness. Through this analysis of the interveners’ everyday life and work, Peaceland proposes innovative ways to better help host populations build a sustainable peace.|$|E

2500|$|As a {{consequence}} {{the position of}} the gods of beginning would not be the issue of a diachronic process of debasement undergone by a supreme uranic god, but rather a structural feature inherent to their theology. The fall of uranic primordial gods into the condition of deus otiosus is a well-known phenomenon in the history of religions. Mircea Eliade gave a positive evaluation of Dumezil's views and of the results in <b>comparative</b> <b>research</b> on Indoeuropean religions achieved in Tarpeia. even though he himself in many of his works observed and discussed the phenomenon of the fall of uranic deities in numerous societies of ethnologic interest. The figure of the IE initial god (Vâyu, Vayu, Mainyu, Janus) may open the sacrifice (Vâyu and Janus), preside over the start of the voyage of the soul after death (Iranian Vayu), [...] "stand {{at the opening of the}} drama of the moral history of the world" [...] (the Zoroastrian Mainyus).

2500|$|Since {{the second}} half of the 19th century, stećci are seen as a symbol of Bosnia and Herzegovina, being objects of South Slavic ideological ethno-national {{building}} myths and ownership, as well different opinions on their archaeological, artistic and historical interpretation. Although both Bosnian, Croatian and Serbian nationalism tried to annex them to their own culture, paradoxally, none of the three ethnic groups (Bosniaks, Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Croats) in Bosnia and Herzegovina originally remember them in their collective consciousness, leaving them to nature or human destruction (which at least halved the number), implying the annexation was based on constructions. Specifically, the thesis about the Bogomil origin of the stećci leaned along the theory of Bogomil origin of the Bosnian Muslims i.e. Bosniaks, which ideologisation and distortion of history was criticized by many scholars, and some like Wenzel stated that [...] "thus stećci were given as a gift to Muslims, emphasizing their inheritance rights to the land and implying that the later Christians, comparatively, were the 'newcomers'". The breakup of Yugoslavia and Bosnian War (1992–1995) caused a resurgence of Bogomil theory in public papers which sought historial-political legitimacy, ideologically aspired that Islamization was not only caused by Ottoman occupation yet it was an event dependent on Bogomils, and thus affirmed ethnical and confessional difference between Bogomil population and population of Catholic and Orthodox confession. However, it did not make a significant influence on scientific thinking and <b>comparative</b> <b>research.</b>|$|E

Both Kiser and Hechter employ models within Rational Choice Theory for their general causal principles. Historical researchers that oppose them (Skocpol, Summers, others) argue that Kiser and Hechter do not suggest many other plausible general theories, and thus it seems as though their advocacy for general theories is actually advocacy for their preferred general theory.
