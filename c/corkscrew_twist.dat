[...] Johnny would innocently inquire, winking at Janet, {{invariably}} running {{his hand through}} the wiry red hair that resumed its <b>corkscrew</b> <b>twist</b> {{as soon as he}} released it.

Sometimes, the wrestler will swing one leg around before they fall, gaining momentum for the <b>corkscrew</b> <b>twist,</b> first invented by Nature Boy Buddy Landel in 1984.|$|E

40|$|We {{discuss a}} new {{mechanism}} which {{could cause a}} rotation of polarization of electromagnetic waves due to magnetic fields on cosmological scales. The effect {{is due to the}} geometrical phase of Pancharatnam and Berry, and causes a <b>corkscrew</b> <b>twisting</b> of the plane of polarization. The new effect represents an additional tool that allows possible intergalactic and cosmological magnetic fields to be studied using radio propagation. Comment: 4 pages, ReVTeX, 1 GIF figure.

For example, a solid yellow bar indicates a shortcut and orange/yellow bars indicates an upcoming hazard. There are also various obstacles like speed-ups, <b>corkscrews,</b> loops, <b>twists,</b> and of course, jumps.|$|R
40|$|Electronic {{systems that}} offer elastic {{mechanical}} responses to high-strain deformations are of growing interest {{because of their}} ability to enable new biomedical devices and other applications whose requirements are impossible to satisfy with conventional wafer-based technologies or even with those that offer simple bendability. This article introduces materials and mechanical design strategies for classes of electronic circuits that offer extremely high stretchability, enabling them to accommodate even demanding configurations such as <b>corkscrew</b> <b>twists</b> with tight pitch (e. g., 90 ° in ≈ 1 cm) and linear stretching to “rubber-band” levels of strain (e. g., up to ≈ 140 %). The use of single crystalline silicon nanomaterials for the semiconductor provides performance in stretchable complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) integrated circuits approaching that of conventional devices with comparable feature sizes formed on silicon wafers. Comprehensive theoretical studies of the mechanics reveal {{the way in which the}} structural designs enable these extreme mechanical properties without fracturing the intrinsically brittle active materials or even inducing significant changes in their electrical properties. The results, as demonstrated through electrical measurements of arrays of transistors, CMOS inverters, ring oscillators, and differential amplifiers, suggest a valuable route to high-performance stretchable electronics...|$|R

5000|$|GameSpot's Alan Dunkin {{called it}} [...] "another fun {{management}} simulation from {{the mind of}} Chris Sawyer." [...] His praises included the custom naming of everything {{in the park and}} position-accurate, real-life sound effects. However, he disliked the limited speed of the game, reasoning that [...] "when you're trying to manage your newest amusement park, time is ticking by, perhaps faster than you'd like." [...] He also criticized the limited amount of scenarios and the player not being able to make their own. IGN's Jason Bates also called it a fun game. He wrote that making custom rides could take a very long time and be very frustrating at first, and players would have to pay too much cash to tasks such as changing land levels, re-positioning trees and build walkways, while they design their rollercoaster. However, once players mastered doing so, [...] "You'll get a lot of pride out of designing some crazy, <b>twisting</b> <b>corkscrew</b> that winds in and out of lakes and hot dog stands, painting it bright neon pink and orange, and giving it a name like the Vominator. And then when the kids start lining up for those $5 tickets, you'll be ready to start saving up for your next ridiculous extravaganza." [...] Game Revolution's Ben Silverman highlighted the game's graphical style: [...] "The nature of the game just doesn't call for fancy graphics, and thankfully things run smoothly. The detail level is very cool, from the green-faced nauseous guest to the marquee scrolling the name of the ride at the entrance." [...] He also praised the endless amount of possibilities in designing rollercoaster rides, as well as the huge amount of specific detail, such as the location of a food stall, the player should and can focus on of their park, with the only slight criticisms being the [...] "sloppy" [...] interface.|$|R
5000|$|La vida doble {{appeared}} in 2010, published by Tusquets in Spain and Argentina, {{and published in}} English by Yale University Press in 2013 in a translation by Megan McDowell. It is a novel {{based on a true}} story of a female guerilla captured by the secret police during the Pinochet era: she was savagely tortured and later converted into working as an agent for that intelligence service and for many years fought her ex comrades. More than a political novel, it plunges the psychological depths of treachery and resentment, commitment and motherhood. The main character tells her story to an unnamed, silent journalist who listens to her and hopes to report on the story. Carlos Fuentes wrote that this book “goes deeply into moral dilemmas and treachery…..nobody represents Chilean writing better today than Arturo Talavera Fontaine…and maybe nobody… better places the movement of the political and social reality of Chile within their own literary reality and the tensions, struggles, uncertainties loyalties and treacheries of a society in flux””. [...] In her review of the book, Fietta Jarque in the Spanish daily paper El País, wrote that: [...] It is a novel that never flags…Fontaine has fashioned, sentence by sentence, a story that doesn’t just end on the last page.Ignacio Echevarría points out that it deals, above everything else, with “the difficulty of assuming a past that has removed itself from every moral system and that, because of this, is revealed as largely unspeakable...in spite of all that Fontaine insists on doing it, by dint of conferring a moral value to the events by accepting them as thus”. Masilover Rodenas in the daily paper La Vanguardia from Barcelona commented that “we are playing here with a confusion of genres (historical and fictitious)….people with various identities, capable of possessing but very rarely of giving. Or ingenuous people who have believed themselves capable of dying for an ideal. Everything is unmasked by the words of Lorena or Irene….La vida doble confirms Arturo Fontaine as one of the writers who best incorporates into his work the recent current of actual realism. Fontaine has given life to various political conflicts so as to convert them into powerful moral dilemmas dealing with heroism, treachery and the surrendering of ideals to a world that has none”. In Ana Josefa Silva’s opinion, the novel “has managed to convey, like nothing before - neither in the cinema, nor literature nor even in the theatre - our complex and difficult recent history in a lucid, convincing and intimate way”. Pedro Gandolfo says that the novel maintains “a vigorous tension, because even though it is fiction, it underlines the possibilities of using fiction to tell the story of such horrendous events…..Fontaine’s technique is outstanding in describing violent and confused scenarios”. Marcos Aguinis wrote in the daily paper La Nación, Buenos Aires This novel deserves to last. Based on real events, like a <b>corkscrew</b> it <b>twists</b> its way into the depths of the human condition. It shocks, disturbs, reveals and maintains a tremendous suspense from beginning to end….a book that is different.|$|R
