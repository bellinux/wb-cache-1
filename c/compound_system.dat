The boiler pressure was , and the grate area [...] The chief features of the design had been patented (no. 16,967 of 1884) by W.H. Nesbit (or Nisbet), who was a cousin of Holmes. Although not entirely successful, it did somewhat better than the only two other British tandem compounds – Great Western Railway nos. 7 & 8, of 1886; although the tandem <b>compound</b> <b>system</b> was more widely used in the USA and Russia. No. 224 was rebuilt back into simple expansion form during 1887.|$|E

For comparison with the later de Glehn compounds, the 4-cylinder simple 4-4-2 locomotive no. 40 North Star was specially built. Although a number of items of French practice were adopted by the Great Western {{as a result of}} these trials, the de Glehn <b>compound</b> <b>system</b> was not one of them.

2500|$|A layout {{with more}} or less 120° crank setting (the final setting was to be empirically determined) with HP {{cylinder}} placed on the left-hand side was fully developed by the Argentinian engineer L.D. Porta [...] for new-built modern steam locomotives all of which would have used multiple expansion, some following this 3-cylinder <b>compound</b> <b>system.</b> These included locomotives of the 2-10-0 wheel arrangement, {{one of which was}} intended for fast freight work in the US, this being a high-pressure triple-expansion machine. Strange as this layout may seem, it had a number of advantages {{from the point of view}} of equalising piston thrusts and arrangement of steam passages. It was claimed that with proper maintenance and operating procedures, such locomotives could compete with modern forms of traction. Other projects were for small 2-cylinder compounds: notably a locomotive for sugar plantations in Cuba, burning bagasse.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{detailed}} {{understanding of}} complete fusion cross sections in heavyion collisions requires {{a consideration of}} the effects of the deformation of the projectile and target. Our aim here is to show that deformation and orientation of the colliding nuclei have a very significant effect on the fusion-barrier height and on the compactness of the touching configuration. To facilitate discussions of fusion configurations of deformed nuclei, we develop a classification scheme and introduce a notation convention for these configurations. We discuss particular deformations and orientations that lead to compact touching configurations and to fusion-barrier heights that correspond to fairly low excitation energies of the <b>compound</b> <b>systems.</b> Such configurations should be the most favorable for producing superheavy elements. We analyse a few projectile-target combinations whose deformations allow favorable entrance-channel configurations and whose proton and neutron numbers lead to <b>compound</b> <b>systems</b> in a part of the superheavy region where α half-lives are calculated to be observable, that is, longer than 1 µs. 1...|$|R
