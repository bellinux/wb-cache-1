5|$|In {{addition}} to its scientific results, Hubble has also {{made significant contributions to}} aerospace engineering, in particular the performance of systems in low Earth orbit. These insights result from Hubble's long lifetime on orbit, extensive instrumentation, and return of assemblies to the Earth where they can be studied in detail. In particular, Hubble has contributed to studies of the behavior of graphite <b>composite</b> <b>structures</b> in vacuum, optical contamination from residual gas and human servicing, radiation damage to electronics and sensors, and the long term behavior of multi-layer insulation. One lesson learned was that gyros assembled using pressurized oxygen to deliver suspension fluid were prone to failure due to electric wire corrosion.

Nevertheless, as with other regional groupings of Early Neolithic long barrows—like the Cotswold-Severn group in south-western Britain—there are also various idiosyncrasies in the different monuments, such as Coldrum's rectilinear shape, the Chestnut Long Barrow's facade, and the long, thin mounds at Addington and Kit's Coty. These variations might have been caused by the tombs being altered and adapted over the course of their use; in this scenario, the monuments would be <b>composite</b> <b>structures.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{simplest}} {{structure that}} can be implemented {{is a step in}} the characteristic impedance of the line, which introduces a discontinuity in the transmission characteristics. This is done in planar technologies by a change in the width of the transmission line. Figure 4(a) shows a step up in impedance (narrower lines have higher impedance). A step down in impedance would be the mirror image of figure 4(a). The discontinuity can be represented approximately as a series inductor, or more exactly, as a low-pass T circuit as shown in figure 4(a). Multiple discontinuities are often coupled together with impedance transformers to produce a filter of higher order. These impedance transformers can be just a short (often λ/4) length of transmission line. These <b>composite</b> <b>structures</b> can implement any of the filter families (Butterworth, Chebyshev, etc.) by approximating the rational transfer function of the corresponding lumped element filter. This correspondence is not exact since distributed element circuits cannot be rational and is the root reason for the divergence of lumped element and distributed element behaviour. Impedance transformers are also used in hybrid mixtures of lumped and distributed element filters (the so-called semi-lumped structures).|$|E

40|$|Abstract. An {{overall goal}} of the INCOSE MBSE {{initiative}} is to provide SysML with a formal semantics and to integrate reasoning services as part of system engineering. UML class diagrams have been encoded as Knowledge Bases (KB) within the Description Logic (DL), ALCQI. The encoding provides a formal semantics for class diagrams which accords with the informal semantics. The encoding applies to SysML which is a profile of UML. The SysML block definition and internal block diagrams {{are not covered by}} the class diagram encoding. These diagrams are essential for representing <b>composite</b> <b>structure</b> such as manufactured products and molecular structures. The class diagram encoding is extended to <b>composite</b> <b>structure</b> diagrams in the DL ALCQIbid. A <b>composite</b> <b>structure</b> diagram describes structures in terms of part decompositions and connections between objects. A SysML <b>composite</b> <b>structure</b> diagram can be encoded in the language of OWL 2, but is not an OWL 2 axiom set, as the diagrams contain property equations which violate the regularity ordering constraints for complex property inclusions. Conditions are given for an ALCQIbid KB which are sufficient to encode a SysML <b>composite</b> <b>structure</b> diagram. Further conditions are given for a KB, called a template, which ensure that within an interpretation all realizations of the <b>composite</b> <b>structure</b> have the same graph structure...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Crack {{is one of}} {{the major}} distresses in asphalt {{concrete}} pavements, which could significantly reduce the safety and amenity of driving, even the performance of the whole pavement structure. By means of diverse crack repairing manners, the durability and whole service life of the pavement can be improved and extended. After repairing, a <b>composite</b> <b>structure</b> of the repairing system is formed which consists of new crack filling materials and original asphalt concrete matrixes. In order to resist the external loads on the pavement, the <b>composite</b> <b>structure</b> mush work as an integrated structure and maintain sufficient adhesive strength. Therefore, the deformation compatibility of the <b>composite</b> <b>structure</b> is the vital performance for the stability and durability of the entire repairing system. In this study, a modeling analysis for the <b>composite</b> <b>structure</b> under various service conditions was carried out utilizing MIDAS software. The vertical and transverse deformation, transverse and longitudinal normal stress were analyzed by simulating the <b>composite</b> <b>structure</b> under several serving conditions.

This co-curing process is capable to co-cure a typical AGS <b>composite</b> <b>structure</b> with the manufacturer’s recommended cure cycle (MRCC).

The shape and size effects of AGS <b>composite</b> <b>structure</b> on the distribution of temperature and degree of cure are also investigated to provide insights for the optimization of soft-mold aided co-curing process...|$|R
