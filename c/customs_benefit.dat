40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is an {{analysis}} of foreign direct investment and their impact and scale in countries in transition, with special reference to Macedonia. The main aim {{of this article is to}} show the investment in Macedonia, in the period before and after the crisis of 2007 and to provide guidance for future activities that will help improve the economic situation in general. The results show that the Macedonian economy is especially supported by active government action on this issue. Government and its activities significantly improve the position of Macedonia in relation to neighboring countries, but there are still areas that need to act. Such domain infrastructure is an issue that would fulfill the image of Macedonian policy for attracting foreign investors. The conclusion is that despite all activities there are determinants that affect traditional markets. The most important of them is the level of gross domestic product. Macedonia has taken many measures to increase the level of GDP and in the level of attracting foreign capital has introduced tax <b>benefits,</b> <b>customs</b> <b>benefits</b> and other benefits with which is competitive with neighboring countries.

40|$|Unpublished {{technology}} proposalWe {{present a}} proposal for {{the development and implementation}} of a group of tools that will support the collection and sharing of georeferenced information. Locations such as rural Africa suffer from a technical problem hampering their participation in the global information community: infrastructures and terminals for Internet access are non-existent or of poor quality. We believe that cell-phone software can be leveraged as a way to bridge this. One important contribution that local communities can provide to the global community is local knowledge. By providing a cell-phone application, people living in low-tech areas can gain the ability to make available worldwide that knowledge, taking full advantage of georeferenced functionalities. This proposal envisages the use of a wiki backbone connected to a map server, allowing information to be added, consulted, edited, and searched, providing strong version management across several users. The georeferenced information can be useful for tackling specific development issues, such as drought problems, outbreaks of diseases, etc. - giving NGOs and governments a better framework upon which to act. By allowing local people to gather, organize and transfer data directly, organizations both local and worldwide can act on timely and accurate local information, as can farmers, local businesspeople, etc. Education is yet another area of application for such a system: teachers would be able to use it to provide a widespread audience for their students' tasks and engage students in collaborative tasks across regions. This ability to publish and retrieve local information can be used by students to share local history and local traditions, contributing to the awareness and preservation of ancient knowledge and <b>customs,</b> and <b>benefiting</b> from cooperation with similar projects in other towns, whether in their own countries or abroad...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{aimed to}} explore and {{describe}} {{the perceptions of the}} Vhavenda people regarding the significance of indigenous knowledge systems (IKS) rituals and customs in promoting Women’s Health. Indigenous knowledge should be given a platform to add {{to our understanding of the}} world and advance philosophies that inform research approaches and interventions that sustain and acknowledge the role played by IKS in promoting women’s health. The HIV epidemic, disproportionately affecting sub-Saharan African women and their families, has put an academic spotlight on African beliefs systems and IKS. Most of the academic studies are based on western approaches, which are built predominantly around individualistic western beliefs and cultures that perceives IKS as the ‘other’ form of knowledge that can pose a threat to African women’s health. A qualitative descriptive study was conducted. In depth interviews were held with key informants who were knowledgeable about Vhavenda cultures. The findings demonstrate that beliefs about polygamy, widow inheritance and initiation schools are more complicated as participants perceived these <b>customs</b> as having <b>benefits</b> and risks to women’s health.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this final dissertation is to present in a concrete form how the posthumanist view, developed by Donna Haraway 1, {{could be applied to}} the analysis of the sporting world. More specifically, I will investigate the relationship of the term cyborg with subject atheletes. ¿Do cybersports people exist? For this, I have carried out a short investigation about the cases of top athletes Caster Semenya and Oscar Pistorious. Through these two case studies i will analize the existing link between different locations and temporalities that the posthumanist theoretical framework raises, widely developed by Bruno Latour. I position myself from the idea of the cyborg, not as a new configuration that allows us to create a non-existent world within that of the imaginary technological world, but rather as a symbol of Western culture that far from improving social inequalities, drags itself with the same <b>customs</b> that <b>benefits</b> few and disadvantages the majority of the world population. I performed an analysis of discourses concerning the subject within the fields of the social sciences and various feminist theories. For this I presented an exhibition of historical and social context into which different analized discourses fit. In this final dissertation I go into the theory of articulation, which authors such as Bruno Latour, Chantal Mouffe, Stuart Hall, Ernesto Laclau and Donna Haraway have been developing. This theory, which I support for the analysis of the speeches that I have chosen for this final project, intends to follow the formation of practices and political subjects like the effect of certain "partial connections". To further my research I analyze the case of transexual and hermaphrodite athletes as subjects that present subjectivity within sports, that lead to rethink the limits in sports competitions. Similarly, so-called "cybersports people" show another example of how sport is a mirror of society where technology increasingly compels to redefine established categories and limits...|$|R

Much {{of the positive}} economic development in the Nordic countries {{is associated with the}} efficient integration of maritime transport and port operations. Normally, a maritime transport system consists of ports, logistics service operators and carriers, which connect export and import ports with regularly scheduled shipping lines.

The Nordic export industry ports {{play an important role in}} connecting remote areas to the world market. Álvarez-SanJaime et al.

Hence the security afforded by the biometric system mitigates its benefits.

40|$|Relying on a three-country {{model of}} {{economic}} geography (one Northern and two Southern countries), this paper analyzes {{the effects of}} South-South regional integration on the location of industry inside the area. A comparison between different trading arrangements shows that {{in the absence of}} cooperation, a developing country can promote industrialization and improve its welfare by unilateral trade liberalization. However, the benefits of unilateral liberalization seem to hold only in a context where the other developing country maintains unilateral protectionism. When instead there is cooperation among the Southern countries, the customs union seems to be the best option because a South-South liberalization coupled with protection vis-à-vis of the North improves the production structures and welfare levels without asymmetry among the integrating countries. However, while the formation of a <b>customs</b> union area <b>benefits</b> the integrating region as a whole according to the industry size, some member countries may be reluctant to apply a common tariff outside the area {{from the point of view}} of welfare. This result, the so-called prisoner? dilemma, displays difficulties in implementing a customs union. Finally, our paper highlights the costs resulting from no cooperation : by implementing trade protection against each other, the Southern countries would deteriorate their performance both in terms of industrialization and welfare, while accentuating their trade dependence vis-à-vis of the North.
