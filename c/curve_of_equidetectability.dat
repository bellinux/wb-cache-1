We prove that these families are irreducible. The proof of the irreducibility of the families <b>of</b> <b>curves</b> <b>of</b> degree d {{is based on the}} study of degeneration <b>of</b> a rational <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> degree d into a curve which decomposes into an irreducible rational <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> degree d− 1 and a projective line intersecting transversally at a point.

40|$|Statement of Problem: When {{reconstructing the}} occlusal curvatures dentists often use a 4 -inch radii arc as a rough {{standard}} based on Monson spherical theory. The {{use of an}} identical radius for the <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> Spee for all patients may not be appropriate because each patient is individually different. The validity of application of this theory in the Indian population and the present study has been undertaken. Aims and Objectives: This study {{is an attempt to}} evaluate the <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> Spee and <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> Wilson in young Indian population using three dimensional analysis. This study compared the radius and the depth of right and left, maxillary and mandibular <b>curves</b> <b>of</b> Spee and the radius of maxillary and mandibular <b>curves</b> <b>of</b> Wilson in males and females. Materials and Methods: The cusp tips of canines, buccal cusp tips of premolars and molars and palatal/lingual cusp tips of second molars of 60 maxillary and 60 mandibular casts were obtained. Three-dimensional (x, y, z) coordinates of the cusp tips of the molars, premolars, and canines of the right and left sides of the maxilla and mandible were obtained with three dimensional coordinate measuring machine. The radius and the depth of right and left, maxillary and mandibular <b>curves</b> <b>of</b> Spee and the radius of maxillary and mandibular <b>curves</b> <b>of</b> Wilson were measured by means of computer software Metrologic-XG. Pearson's correlation test and Independent t-test were used to test the statistical significance (α=. 05). Conclusion: The values <b>of</b> <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> Spee and <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> Wilson in Indian population obtained from this study were higher than the 4 inch (100 mm) radius proposed by Monson. These findings suggest ethnic differences in the radius <b>of</b> <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> Spee and <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> Wilson...|$|R
