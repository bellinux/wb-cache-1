40|$|Crushing {{along the}} fiber axis of undirectional E-glass fiber {{composites}} rods was examined {{to determine the}} effects of fiber volume fraction, fiber diameter, matrix compressive yield strength, <b>crush</b> <b>rate,</b> fiber surface treatment, and crush plate geometry. The volume specific energy absorption was found to increase with fiber content, fiber diameter, matrix yield strength, and <b>crush</b> <b>rate.</b> The crush load stability was found to be independent of fiber content and fiber diameter but not of matrix yield strengt. The crush load became less stable as the yield strength increased. The crush behavior of specimens containing clean fibers was about the same as with sized fibers, but specimens with a release agent on the fiber surface crushed with less energy absorption that decreased even as the fiber content increased, but the crush load was more stable than with sized or clean fibers. The volume specific energy absorption was greater when the rod specimens were crushed against concave surfaces than against a flat plate. A relatively simple model was able to account for the dependence of the energy absorption on fiber volume fraction and matrix yield strength...|$|E

40|$|Extraction {{of juice}} from {{shredded}} sugar cane is commonly performed using sets of counter-rotating rolls. Increases in <b>crushing</b> <b>rate</b> through factory mills {{have traditionally been}} achieved by increasing blanket thickness rather than roll surface speed due to concerns regarding loss of extraction efficiency at higher rolling speeds. Recent factory experience has shown that good extraction performance can be achieved at higher speeds than previously thought, provided that adequate drainage of expressed juice away from the rolls is provided. This study uses finite element methods to predict internal energy dissipation levels due to solid matrix deformation and liquid flow during rolling of prepared sugarcane, and to compare milling parameters for thick blanket, low speed rolling versus thin blanket, high speed rolling. The finite element results suggest that higher roll speeds and thinner blankets (than those currently used in industry practice) would maintain <b>crushing</b> <b>rates</b> and juice extraction levels while reducing roll load, torque, and power consumption, and decreasing frictional sliding between rolls and cane blanket. 1 Notation a,b,c coefficients in permeability relatio...|$|R

The study was conducted at New Halfa Sugar Factory, with a cane <b>crushing</b> <b>rate</b> of 5000 tons/day. A 150 hp tractor was used on 1 km hauling route as the most critical grade from the second main center up to the unloading platform. The route was divided into four sections with different grades. The grade of each section was measured with surveying equipment. The road combined resistance, that has to be overcome by the hauling unit, is the sum of the route grade and the coefficient of rolling resistance. As per literature, the coefficient of rolling resistance is assumed to be 0. 02 for all sections. The tractor was run on different gear meshes to determine its grade ability at different speeds. The total operation time, function of gear mesh and road combined resistance were determined and used to calculate hauling unit production <b>rate.</b> The factory <b>crushing</b> <b>rate</b> was divided by the hauling unit production rate to get the number of hauling units.

As a result, the required number of hauling units was 5 and 6 for treated and non-treated routes, respectively. Out of 36 gears in the tractor gear box, the number of gears actually used was 2 and 3 for treated and non - treated routes, respectively. This makes the use of tractor with standard gear box in cane hauling questionable; a simple gear box with three or four gear may suffice.

40|$|A {{discrete}} element {{method was}} used to study the evolution of particle crushing in a rockfill sample subjected to triaxial shear. A simple procedure was developed to generate clusters with arbitrary shapes, which resembled real rockfill particles. A theoretical method was developed to define the failure criterion for an individual particle subjected to an arbitrary set of contact forces. Then, a series of numerical tests of large-scale drained triaxial tests were conducted to simulate the behaviors of the rockfill sample. Finally, we examined the development of micro-characteristics such as particle crushing, contact characteristics, porosity, deformation, movement, and energy dissipation. The simulation results were partially compared with the laboratory experiments, and good agreement was achieved, demonstrating that the particle crushing model proposed {{can be used to}} simulate the drained triaxial test of rockfill materials. Based on a comparison of macro behaviors of the rockfill sample and micro structures of the particles, the microscopic mechanism of the rockfill materials subjected to triaxial shear was determined qualitatively.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{effect of}} fiber diameter, trigger {{geometry}} and section geometry on the crush response of pultruded glass {{fiber reinforced plastic}} tubes, made with either {{polyester or vinyl ester}} resin, was determined at <b>crush</b> <b>rates</b> from 2. 1 x 10 - 4 m/s to &mdash; 15 m/s. The rate dependence of the specific energy for the polyester resin tubes was positive, whereas that for the vinyl resin tubes could be either positive or negative, depending upon the par-ticular tube geometry. Increases in the specific energy absorption, previously observed in quasi-static loading, caused by changes in the crush trigger geometry, were found also for dynamic loading. Reductions in the fiber diameter by one half (nominal), for the same glass content, decreased the specific energy by up to &sim; 20 %. Differences in the resin affect the quasi-static crush resistance, the vinyl ester resin tubes having a significantly higher specific energy than that of the polyester resin tubes. These differences tend to diminish for dynamic crush. Fiber delamination occurs more profusely under dynamic loading con-ditions, and it is suggested that a crush mode change occurs on passing from quasi-static to dynamic loading. A tendency to crush in an unstable manner was found for some square sections under dynamic loading, possibly due to the accumulation of crush debris in the tube interior...|$|R

Rationing and queuing became a way of life, with ration cards (kartki) necessary to buy basic consumer staples. The ration cards were utilized by the government in order to avoid allowing market regulation of income and prices and thus risking social unrest. As Western institutions were no longer willing to extend credit policies to the de facto bankrupt Polish government, access to goods the Poles needed became even more restricted. Most of the available scarce resources of Western currency had to be used to pay the <b>crushing</b> <b>rates</b> on Poland's foreign debt, which reached US$27 billion by 1980 and increased to US$45 billion in 1989. The government, which controlled all official foreign trade, responded by continuing to maintain a highly artificial exchange rate with Western currencies. The exchange rate worsened distortions in the economy at all levels, resulting in a growing black market {{and the development of a}} shortage economy. The omnipresent and destructive underground economy was characterized by phenomena such as bribery, waiting lists, speculation, direct exchanges between enterprises and large percentages of personal incomes deriving from secondary activities. Societal degradation was accompanied by unprecedented deterioration in the areas of biological environment and physical and mental health, which included steadily increasing mortality rates. In the late 1980s, the PZPR feared another social explosion because of high inflation, depressed living standards and deepening public anger and frustration. The authorities themselves, facing an increasingly disorderly and unmanageable system, felt perplexed and powerless.|$|R

Temporary Beach Closures, comprized of a 50 x 25 m exclusion zone around a shorebird nest, represent a promising technique for altering human behaviour by reducing both disturbance to birds and inadvertent crushing of eggs by beach visitors. We assessed whether three commonly employed configurations of Temporary Beach Closures (sign, fence, and warden) were effective at: (1) achieving compliance among beach visitors, and (2) reducing egg-crushing rates. Overall, 93. 7 % of beach visitors complied with all Temporary Beach Closures, {{resulting in a}} reduction in egg-crushing rates within, as opposed to adjacent to, Temporary Beach Closures. Levels of compliance were high in all Temporary Beach Closure configurations (88. 0 - 99. 4 %), and similar levels of compliance were achieved within the three configurations. Human compliance was highest for females and when the density of beach-users was higher, while individuals aged 61 years {{were less likely to}} comply with Temporary Beach Closures. Despite an increased probability of compliance on high density beaches, this did not translate into a reduction in egg <b>crushing</b> <b>rates</b> on such beaches, because the overall number of noncompliant individuals remained higher. We conclude any Temporary Beach Closure configuration is meritorious, and that their use on high and low-use recreational beaches will benefit breeding shorebirds by reducing the rate of egg-crushing. Targeting demographics that display lower levels of compliance, such as men, young people (i. e. 60), may further improve the effectiveness of Temporary Beach Closures in enhancing the conservation of shorebirds...|$|R

[...] He also criticized the lyrics, called them [...] "bland" [...] and [...] "couldn't be interpreted as inspirational or romantic, depending on the listener." [...] Entertainment Weekly contributor Grady Smith called it [...] "a mismash, featuring a thumping club beat, soaring diva notes (some of which sound seemingly and unnecessarily Auto-Tuned), techno flourishes, and a bevvy of inspirational-slash-romantic lyrics. All of it leaves me a little confused - is she singing about her man, or The Man Upstairs?" [...] Scott Shetler of Pop <b>Crush</b> <b>rated</b> it {{two and a half}} stars out of five, saying, [...] "unfortunately, her first offering offers a rather bland dance-pop arrangement that doesn't flaunt her winning voice effectively." [...] Idolator writer Becky Bain gave the song a negative review, explaining that the track lacked originality, exemplifying the use of [...] "a techno breakdown thrown in for absolutely no reason other than to poorly follow the current trend. It also doesn't seem to know whether it's a love song or a self-empowerment anthem." [...] Since its release, [...] "Don't Fail Me Now" [...] reached a peak of number 21 on Billboards Hot Dance Club Songs component chart.|$|R
40|$|IN RECENT TIMES, Australian sugar {{factories}} {{have tried to}} maximise throughput. This trend has continued with factory rationalisation and a need to maximise utilisation of existing capital. The amount of maceration applied to the crushing mills has a great effect on reducing pol loss in final mill bagasse. It is generally recognised that other things being equal, the more maceration the better the extraction. However the down side is that evaporators {{have to be able}} to boil off the extra water. The capacity of the evaporators to boil off that water in turn limits crushing capacity. Other issues associated with higher maceration rates are the evaporators scale quicker and the amount of steam required to maintain crushing capacity increases. Traditional maceration rates have been determined by using a fixed percentage of water at a daily average fibre rate which is at least a 24 hours out of date. Near Infra Red (NIR) measurement was introduced to Mackay sugar mills in 2006 and can be used to determine the quantities of fibre, pol and ash contained in the incoming cane. NIR gives a real time measurement of cane parameters and has allowed fibre rates through the mills to be measured accurately. Those measurements have been combined with cane <b>crushing</b> <b>rates</b> to provide a control value for maceration addition. This accurate control of maceration rate gives the following advantages over the traditional method of controlling maceration flow: mills have a consistent maceration % fibre which means there is always sufficient water to get the required pol recovery regardless of the cane characteristics; mills are not using extra maceration – just the right amount to give the right balance between bagasse loss, evaporator capacity and steam availability; more stable ESJ (Evaporator Supply Juice) brix which produces more stable evaporator performance; consistent final bagasse moisture and quality...|$|R

The optimal control model takes the energy cost as the performance index to be minimized by accounting for the time-of-use (TOU) tariff. The control variables in the developed model are the belt conveyor feed flow <b>rate,</b> the VSI <b>crusher</b> rotor feed <b>rate</b> and the bi-flow or cascade flow rate. The effectiveness of the developed model is shown through the simulation results of the crushing process in a coal-fired power plant...|$|R
40|$|A large {{suite of}} {{tests of the}} Blade Runners concept for {{reducing}} ice-induced vibration of structures was conducted in NRC/OCRE 2 ̆ 019 s Large Cold Room facility using a set of differing ice crushing platens that had a variety of blade arrays on them. These Phase II tests were intended to investigate {{the factors that influence}} the performance of the technology and to identify the best performing Blade Runners crushing platens. In general two types of tests were conducted: (a) tests where crushing was from the vertical direction and where the platens were fixed from movement in the horizontal direction and (b) tests where the platens were moved horizontally during the crushing to investigate frictional aspects of the technology. For most cases high-speed imaging was used to observe the ice contact zone, by viewing through the platens that were made of acrylic, as it evolved during the tests. Blade shape, orientation and array spacing were investigated as well as platen material. Vertical <b>crushing</b> <b>rates</b> were in the range 10 2 ̆ 013 30 mm/s and the horizontal sliding rates were in the range 4. 14 2 ̆ 013 30 mm/s. All tests were conducted at - 10 oC. Three types of freshwater ice were used and 14 platens with open arrays of blades were tested. Results showed that blade shapes and array spacing was important factors and that square-column and square-pyramid blades performed well. The arithmetic average of the high- roughness profiles for the surfaces of the two best performing platens were 0. 075 mm (square pyramids) and 0. 375 mm (square columns). Load records from tests using flat bladeless crushing platens exhibited a high-amplitude sawtooth load pattern, resulting from fairly regular ice spalling events, that is typical of ice crushing in the brittle regime. This type of spalling behavior, and associated sawtooth load pattern, is responsible for ice-induced vibration of structures when ice sheets encroach on them. The high-performance Blade Runners platens significantly reduced the amplitude of the sawtooth load patterns. During tests {{there was no evidence of}} entrapment of crushed ice between blades nor was there any evidence of high frictional forces on the platens during tests involving horizontal sliding.
