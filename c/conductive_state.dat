5000|$|Threshold {{switching}} {{occurs when}} GeSbTe goes {{from a high}} resistive state to a <b>conductive</b> <b>state</b> at the threshold field of about 56 V/um. This {{can be seen from}} the current-voltage (IV) plot, where current is very low in the amorphous state at low voltage until threshold voltage is reached. Current increases rapidly after the voltage snapback. The material is now in the amorphous [...] "ON" [...] state, where the material is still amorphous, but in a pseudo- crystalline electric state. In crystalline state, the IV characteristics is ohmic. There had been debate on whether threshold switching was an electrical or thermal process. There were suggestions that the exponential increase in current at threshold voltage must have been due to generation of carriers that vary exponentially with voltage such as impact ionization or tunneling.|$|E
50|$|The rapid {{transition}} from a non-conducting to a <b>conductive</b> <b>state</b> produces a brief emission of light and a sharp crack or snapping sound. A spark is created when the applied electric field exceeds the dielectric breakdown strength of the intervening medium. For air, the breakdown strength is about 30 kV/cm at sea level. At the beginning stages, free electrons in the gap (from cosmic rays or background radiation) are accelerated by the electrical field. As they collide with air molecules, they create additional ions and newly freed electrons which are also accelerated. At some point, thermal energy will provide a much greater source of ions. The exponentially-increasing electrons and ions rapidly cause regions of {{the air in the}} gap to become electrically conductive in a process called dielectric breakdown. Once the gap breaks down, current flow is limited by the available charge (for an electrostatic discharge) or by the impedance of the external power supply. If the power supply continues to supply current, the spark will evolve into a continuous discharge called an electric arc. An electric spark can also occur within insulating liquids or solids, but the breakdown mechanisms are significantly different than for sparks in gases.|$|E
50|$|Electroporation is a {{multi-step}} {{process with}} several distinct phases. First, a short electrical pulse must be applied. Typical parameters would be 300-400 mV for < 1 ms across the membrane (note- the voltages used in cell experiments are typically much larger {{because they are}} being applied across large distances to the bulk solution so the resulting field across the actual membrane {{is only a small}} fraction of the applied bias). Upon application of this potential the membrane charges like a capacitor through the migration of ions from the surrounding solution. Once the critical field is achieved there is a rapid localized rearrangement in lipid morphology. The resulting structure is believed to be a “pre-pore” since it is not electrically conductive but leads rapidly to the creation of a conductive pore. Evidence for the existence of such pre-pores comes mostly from the “flickering” of pores, which suggests a transition between conductive and insulating states. It has been suggested that these pre-pores are small (~3 Å) hydrophobic defects. If this theory is correct, then the transition to a <b>conductive</b> <b>state</b> could be explained by a rearrangement at the pore edge, in which the lipid heads fold over to create a hydrophilic interface. Finally, these conductive pores can either heal, resealing the bilayer or expand, eventually rupturing it. The resultant fate depends on whether the critical defect size was exceeded which in turn depends on the applied field, local mechanical stress and bilayer edge energy.|$|E

40|$|In {{rotating}} Rayleigh Bénard convection, Coriolis force stabilizes the <b>conductive</b> <b>state,</b> and the convective onset {{increases as}} rotation increases.

This instability has been the subject of many theoretical and experimental works mainly because the primary bifurcation is a direct transition from the conductive regime to a chaotic state (spatio-temporal chaos). Rigid boundary conditions have a strong effect on patterns, both in perturbing solutions of the infinite system and in selecting particular solutions.

The measured impedance {{is expected to be}} ω dependent. Interestingly, the impedance information obtained during the off state was similar to that of on state. The bias sweeping showed a gradual decrease in impedance unlike the rapid changes in the current–voltage characteristics.

40|$|The {{bifurcation}} diagram for the Eckhaus instability is presented, {{based on}} the Ginzburg-Landau equation in a finite domain with either free-slip or periodic boundary conditions. The <b>conductive</b> <b>state</b> is shown to undergo a sequence of destabilizing bifurcations giving rise to branches of pure-mode states; all branches but the first are necessarily unstable at onset. Each pure-mode branch undergoes a sequence of secondary restabilizing bifurcations, the last of which is shown to correspond to the Eckhaus instability. The restabilizing bifurcations arise from mode interactions between the pure-mode branches, and can be related directly to the destabilizing bifurcations of the <b>conductive</b> <b>state.</b> The downwards shift of the Eckhaus parabola calculated by Krarner and Zimmerman for the case of finite geometry is stressed.
