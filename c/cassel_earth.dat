50|$|The 17th and 18th century saw the {{greatest}} use of brown. Caravaggio and Rembrandt Van Rijn used browns to create chiaroscuro effects, where the subject {{appeared out of}} the darkness. Rembrandt also added umber to the ground layers of his paintings because it promoted faster drying. Rembrandt also began to use new brown pigment, called <b>Cassel</b> <b>earth</b> or Cologne earth. This was a natural earth color composed of over ninety percent organic matter, such as soil and peat. It was used by Rubens and Anthony van Dyck, and later became commonly known as Van Dyck brown.|$|E

5000|$|Van Dyck brown, {{known in}} Europe as Cologne earth or <b>Cassel</b> <b>earth,</b> is another natural earth pigment, {{that was made}} up largely of decayed vegetal matter. It made a rich dark brown, and was widely used during the Renaissance to the 19th century It {{takes its name from}} the painter Anthony van Dyck, but it was used by many other artists before him. It was highly {{unstable}} and unreliable, so its use was abandoned by the 20th century, though the name continues to be used for modern synthetic pigments. The color of Van Dyck brown can be recreated by mixing ivory black with mauve or with Venetian red, or mixing cadmium red with cobalt blue.|$|E
30|$|Carbon-based {{pigments}} are a {{group of}} dark-colored materials that are classified according to the starting material and the manufacturing process. They are composed by some form of elemental carbon and four groups may be distinguished: graphite, flame carbons, chars, and cokes [1 – 3]. On the other hand, black earths containing amorphous carbonaceous materials, such as Vandyke brown and <b>Cassel</b> <b>earth</b> have also been used as pigments. These humic-earth materials are composed of complex mixtures of natural organic substances derived from animal and vegetable sources with varying proportions of mineral matter [4].|$|E
30|$|Van Dyck {{applied the}} underdrawing in two phases. With a {{carbon-based}} dry medium, he first drew freehand {{the outlines of}} the figures, the principal lines and hatched shadows of the drapery, and the composition of the background [30]. Details such as the figures’ physiognomy were not delineated in his underdrawings. This phase is in principle visible with IRR. Second, these fine outlines and hatched shadows were reinforced and reworked with a brush and translucent red brownish paint [29]. This is not visible in IRR. Literature indicated that the paint mixture employed by Van Dyck includes manganese and iron-containing pigments, i.e. umber or <b>Cassel</b> <b>earth,</b> and a little carbon-based black, especially for the shadow areas [17, 18]. Nevertheless, in some cases (6 of paintings out of 12) infrared research did not reveal traces of an initial dry medium sketch. Therefore, it is possible that Van Dyck also used a more direct approach by roughly sketching out the design on canvas with a brush and the aforementioned fluid paint [29, 33].|$|E
30|$|Raman {{spectroscopy}} is {{an ideal}} non-destructive technique for the characterization {{of a variety of}} carbonaceous materials because it is sensitive to crystalline and amorphous structures, allowing the study of highly disordered materials, such as carbon-based pigments [9, 10]. The Raman spectrum of crystalline graphite consists of a narrow band at 1, 580  cm− 1 known as G band (‘graphite’) while disordered or microcrystalline graphite presents an additional band around 1, 350  cm− 1 known as D band, often called the ‘disorder’ band. Raman spectra of amorphous carbons are characterized by broad bands around 1, 550 and 1, 350  cm− 1 and several spectral parameters of these bands such as their positions, relative intensities, and band widths provide structural information and have helped to discriminate between samples from different origins [9 – 11]. Recently, we have studied by Raman microscopy seven carbon-based pigments used in art and as references for archaeometric studies, together with a sample of commercial vegetable charcoal, in order to find relevant parameters to distinguish between the pigments [12]. These references had been selected from ten carbon-based pigments previously studied in detail by a combination of FTIR-ATR, SEM–EDS microscopy and XRD to determine their structures and compositions [13]. The selected pigments comprised graphite (crystalline carbon), lampblack and bistre (flame carbons), bitumen and ivory black (cokes), commercial wood charcoal (char), and Vandyke brown and <b>Cassel</b> <b>earth</b> (black earths). Reference carbon-based pigments from different sources showed similar Raman spectra with characteristic G and D bands in the range 1, 350 – 1, 600  cm− 1 that differed clearly in position, width and relative intensity. The combined analysis of the spectral parameters showed that Raman microscopy allowed the discrimination of most of the reference pigments as well as the identification of carbon-based black pigments in two South American colonial paintings dated from the early 18 th century [13].|$|E
