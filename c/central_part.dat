5|$|The entire Nescopeck Creek {{watershed}} has a {{high level}} of biodiversity, with the most diverse areas being Arbutus Peak, the Edgewood vernal pools, and the Nescopeck Creek valley. The creek's southeastern corner contains the highest density of amphibian species in its watershed. The highest density of snake species in the watershed is in the same area. The lowest density of snake species in the watershed is along the <b>central</b> <b>part</b> of Nescopeck Creek. The highest density of bird species in the watershed is in the southern and <b>central</b> <b>part</b> of the watershed. The highest density of mammal species in the watershed is at Nescopeck Creek's headwaters.|$|E

5|$|In {{comparison}} to the well-preserved rocks of the dry, <b>central</b> <b>part</b> of the Andes, the record that defines the southern sector is poorly preserved. Remnants of Miocene and Quaternary eruptions within the <b>central</b> <b>part</b> are clearly preserved in the rock record. Ash flow sheets constitute as much as 40percent of the area's total erupted material, suggesting that pyroclastic eruptions were rather important during this time. By examining the eruption rate of individual volcanoes, Hildreth et al. concluded that similar amounts of ash-flow volcanism {{took place in the}} southern sector as well. Their study established that in particular silicic ash was missing from the record, and concluded that erosion had probably disrupted deposition of volcaniclastic rock.|$|E

40|$|In both galaxy pairs Arp 166 and 3 C 278 {{the authors}} find {{radially}} increasing velocity dispersions indicating a perturbed, non-equilibrium {{state of the}} galaxies after the tidal interaction. In all galaxies, the increase is most pronounced in the regions which correspond to the centers of the outer isophotes. The authors suggest a scenario in which the galaxies are strongly decelerated on their orbits during the encounter. The deceleration depends on the radial position in the perturbed galaxy and vanishes {{in the center of}} the perturbed galaxy (Spitzer, 1958). In addition, the crossing time of the stars near the center is very short, implying that the tidal perturbations can be averaged over several orbital periods (e. g., Binney and Tremaine, 1987). In consequence, the <b>central</b> <b>parts</b> are not affected by the tidal interaction while the outer parts are strongly decelerated. This leads to a displacement of the <b>central</b> <b>parts</b> of the galaxies with respect to their envelopes in an anti-symmetrical way for the two components of each galaxy pair. The motions of the <b>central</b> <b>parts</b> subsequently are opposed by dynamical friction with the surrounding envelopes. Due to dynamical friction, the density of the stars increases in the wakes of the moving <b>central</b> <b>parts</b> (Mulder, 1983). The overdensity of stars in the wakes of the moving <b>central</b> <b>parts</b> efficiently decelerates the motions of the <b>central</b> <b>parts.</b> The reaction of the stars in the overdensity regions leads to an increase of the velocity dispersion mainly along the orbits of the moving <b>central</b> <b>parts.</b> The presented observations, especially the asymmetrical luminosity profiles and the radially increasing velocity dispersions support consistently the above scenario of tidal interaction between galaxies. Further spectroscopic observations are necessary in order to investigate the degree of anisotropy in the kinematically perturbed regions...|$|R

Hydrothermal alteration may be driven by the formation of a deep magma reservoir and resulting hydrothermal circulation in overlying rocks.|$|E
