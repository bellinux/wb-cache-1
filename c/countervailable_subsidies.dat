40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{operative}} {{performances of the}} banking institutions in China and India, {{taking into account the}} contentious issue of institutional differences in banking sectors in these two economies, reflected in the generation of non-performing loans. The study also examines the issue of the use of banks to provide <b>countervailable</b> <b>subsidies</b> to exporting organizations. Our results show that the efficiency differences between banks in these two countries can be directly related to their institutional differences.

40|$|In August 2001, the United States Department of Commerce (USDOC) {{issued a}} {{preliminary}} determination that Canadian schemes for allocating standing timber to private harvesters - "stumpage” programs - provided <b>countervailable</b> <b>subsidies</b> to Canadian softwood lumber producers. It also preliminarily determined that critical circumstances {{existed in the}} US softwood lumber industry, caused by Canadian imports. Provisional measures were imposed {{on the basis of}} a preliminary subsidy rate of 19. 31 percent, applicable to all producers/exporters, and applied to all entries of softwood lumber from Canad...|$|E
40|$|It {{has become}} common in {{literature}} to compare India and China two remarkably growing economies but these comparisons {{often do not}} take into account the institutional differences between two countries. We have in this paper done a comparative analysis of banking institutions in China and India taking into accounts the contentious issue of nonperforming loans along with the issue of use of banks to provide <b>countervailable</b> <b>subsidies</b> to exporting organizations. Our research shows that the efficiency differences between banks in these two countries can be directly related to institutional difference between two countries and any comparative study between two countries not taking into consideration these institutional differences may lead to misleading results. <br /...|$|E
40|$|On August 17, 1993, the United States Department of Commerce (USDOC) imposed {{definitive}} countervailing duties (CVDs) {{on carbon}} steel originating in Germany. The imposition of these duties {{was based on an}} investigation by USDOC in which it was determined that certain German producers had benefited from five <b>countervailable</b> <b>subsidy</b> programs at a total ad valorem rate of 0. 60 percen...|$|R
50|$|The Canadian {{government}} and lumber industry dispute this assertion, {{based on a}} number of factors, including that Canadian timber is provided to such a wide range of industries, and that lack of specificity makes it ineligible to be considered a subsidy under U.S. law. Under U.S. trade remedy law, a <b>countervailable</b> <b>subsidy</b> must be specific to a particular industry. This requirement precludes imposition of countervailing duties on government programs, such as roads, that are meant to benefit a broad array of interests. Since 1982, there have been four major iterations of the dispute.|$|R
40|$|In United States - Countervailing Measures Concerning Certain Products {{from the}} European Communities (WTO Doc. WT/DS 212 /QB/R, {{henceforth}} Certain Products), the Appellate Body (AB) of the World Trade Organization was {{called upon to}} revisit {{the issue of whether}} the United States can legally impose countervailing duties following the privatization of state-owned enterprises that had received non-recurring subsidies. In twelve cases, the United States Department of Commerce (USDOC) had applied either the "gamma method” or the "same-person method” in assessing the impact of a change of ownership on the continued existence of a benefit from a <b>countervailable</b> <b>subsidy.</b> The European Communities challenged the legality of these method...|$|R
40|$|Economists have {{increasingly}} {{become involved in}} trade remedy and litigation matters that call for economic interpretation or quantification. The literature {{on the use of}} econometric methods in response to legal requirements of trade policy is rather limited. This article contributes to filling this gap by demonstrating the efficacy of using a simple 2 ̆ 018 probabilistic 2 ̆ 019 model in analyzing the 2 ̆ 018 likelihood 2 ̆ 019 of injury to the local industry concerned, following a finding of continuation or recurrence of dumping (or <b>countervailable</b> <b>subsidies).</b> The legal concept of 2 ̆ 018 likelihood 2 ̆ 019 is not only particularly well-suited to illustrate the systemic need for trade lawyers and economists to cooperate. It is also of imminent practical relevance with a groundswell of 2 ̆ 018 sunset 2 ̆ 019 reviews looming on the horizon. We discuss the significance of economic analysis for trade remedy investigations by reviewing the literature, the applicable WTO rules and, in particular, the pertinent case law. The potential value of probabilistic simulations for 2 ̆ 018 likelihood 2 ̆ 019 determinations is exemplified using a real-world application. Using data from past United States International Trade Commission investigations, we find that a probabilistic model that takes account of the uncertainty surrounding economic parameters reduces the risk of misjudging the effect on the domestic industry of a termination of trade remedies...|$|E
40|$|Although {{the number}} of subsidy and countervailing duty cases, both at {{national}} and WTO level is declining, they still hold centre stage in the trade wars that are the hallmark of modern international economy. Suffice it to mention the “Foreign Sales Corporations” case, the “softwood lumber” cases and the ongoing “US-EC large civil aircraft” dispute. There are several reasons for this. On the one hand, the multilateral regulation of subsidies can strongly impinge on governmental autonomy {{in the management of}} the national economy. On the other, the boundaries of subsidisation are often quite uncertain as subsidies can overlap with quite distinct areas in the public management of the economy, such as taxation. Probably {{as a result of the}} foregoing factors, the multilateral discipline on subsidies was slow to develop and it is only with the Uruguay Round that a fully fledged, wide-ranging regime took shape, while the identification of <b>countervailable</b> <b>subsidies</b> and the conditions under which they can be countered have been left for long to domestic countervailing duty proceedings. The United States, for a long time the main user of CVD proceedings, developed a much more sophisticated and detailed regime than the GATTs. The competitive margin provided by US administrative practice has enabled it to impose its perspective on the shaping of the multilateral regime, firstly as a result of the Uruguay Round negotiations, and secondly because of the creative interpretation of the WTO rules, especially by the Appellate Body. On the other hand, in implementing the WTO regime the United States has often been able to withstand attempts to change its domestic regime, although some of its aspects are not necessarily consistent with the WTO rules. The success of the United States, however, has been far from complete as the US has not been able to impose its viewpoint on decisive aspects of the subsidy regulation in the GATT and in the WTO system.
