The spring is then placed in a press structure having first and second opposed planar support surfaces, with the machined spring end surface bearing against the first support surface, the unmachined spring end surface bearing against a planar first {{surface of a}} lateral force compensation member, and an opposite, generally spherically curved surface of the compensation member bearing against the second press structure support surface. The spring is then compressed generally to its loaded length, and a circumferentially spaced series of marks, lying in a plane parallel to the second press structure support surface, are formed on the spring coil on which the second spring end surface lies. The spring is then removed from the press structure, and the second spring end surface is machined to the mark plane.

Larger versions have a strong <b>compression</b> <b>coil</b> <b>spring</b> as part of the attachment mechanism that pulls the knife against the stationary edge as the knife is drawn down to cut the paper.

When the knife is pulled down to cut paper, the action resembles that of a pair of scissors, only instead of two knives moving against each other, one is stationary. The combination of a blade mounted to a steady base produces clean and straight cuts, the likes of which would have otherwise required a ruler and razor blade to achieve on a single page. Paper cutters are also used for cutting thin sheet metal, cardboard, and plastic. The blade on a paper cutter is made of steel which makes it almost impossible to break.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{develop a}} rapid imaging {{framework}} for balanced steady-state free precession (bSSFP) that jointly reconstructs undersampled data (by {{a factor of}} R) across multiple coils (D) and multiple acquisitions (N). To devise a multi-acquisition <b>coil</b> <b>compression</b> technique for improved computational efficiency. Methods: The bSSFP image for a given coil and acquisition is modeled to be modulated by a coil sensitivity and a bSSFP profile. The proposed reconstruction by calibration over tensors (ReCat) recovers missing data by tensor interpolation over the coil and acquisition dimensions. <b>Coil</b> <b>compression</b> is achieved using a new method based on multilinear singular value decomposition (MLCC). ReCat is compared with iterative self-consistent parallel imaging (SPIRiT) and profile encoding (PE-SSFP) reconstructions. Results: Compared to parallel imaging or profile-encoding methods, ReCat attains sensitive depiction of high-spatial-frequency information even at higher R. In the brain, ReCat improves peak SNR (PSNR) by 1. 1 ± 1. 0 dB over SPIRiT and by 0. 9 ± 0. 3 dB over PE-SSFP (mean±std across subjects; average for N= 2 - 8, R= 8 - 16). Furthermore, reconstructions based on MLCC achieve 0. 8 ± 0. 6 dB higher PSNR compared to those based on geometric <b>coil</b> <b>compression</b> (GCC) (average for N= 2 - 8, R= 4 - 16). Conclusion: ReCat is a promising acceleration framework for banding-artifact-free bSSFP imaging with high image quality; and MLCC offers improved computational efficiency for tensor-based reconstructions.

In this work, geometric-decomposition <b>coil</b> <b>compression</b> (GCC) is applied to radial sampling (both linear-angle and golden-angle patterns are discussed) for better compression.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} is to explore the effect of cryogenic treatment on the fatigue life of <b>compression</b> <b>springs.</b> Product manufacturers are constantly searching for ways to make their products last longer. This dissertation addresses three questions: (1) What {{is the effect of}} cryogenic treatment on the fatigue life of chrome silicon steel <b>compression</b> <b>springs?</b> Does the life increase, decrease, or remain the same? (2) What is the effect of cryogenic treatment on the Percent Load Loss (Stress Relaxation) of chrome silicon steel <b>compression</b> <b>springs?</b> (3) What are the possible changes in the material that cause these effects? The following tests were carried out; wire tensile test, hardness test, chemical analysis, residual stress, retained austenite, lattice parameter, force vs. deflection, percent load loss (stress relaxation), fatigue, microstructures, and eta carbides. This research produced a number of key findings: (1) The cryogenically treated springs had a longer cycle life and a higher endurance limit than the untreated springs. (2) The percent load loss (stress relaxation) of the cryogenically treated springs was similar to the untreated springs. (3) The cryogenically treated springs had a higher compressive residual stress at the surface than the untreated springs. The conclusions of this research are that the cryogenic treatment of chrome silicon steel <b>compression</b> <b>springs</b> led to an increase in compressive residual stress on the wire surface, which in turn led to an increase in fatigue life and a higher endurance limit. A recommended future study would be to compare cryogenically treated springs to shot peened springs...|$|R
