We {{consider}} {{a problem of}} computing the maximal value associated to the nodes of a network in the model of unknown symmetric radio network with availability of collision detection. We assume that the nodes have no initial knowledge about the network topology, number of nodes and even they have no identifiers. The network contains one distinguished node, <b>called</b> <b>initiator,</b> that starts the process of computing. We design a series of algorithms that result into an asymptotically optimal deterministic algorithm completing the task in Θ(ecc +logMax) rounds, where ecc is the eccentricity of the initiator and Maxis the maximal value among the integer values associated to the nodes.

This sustained perturbation has disrupted the intertidal community in several ways, but the mechanisms behind the observed shifts in local biodiversity remain poorly understood. Our main goal was to identify the species (lumped into trophic groups) belonging to the Chan˜aral intertidal community that, being directly affected by copper pollution, contributed primarily to the generation of the observed changes in community structure. These groups of species were <b>called</b> <b>initiators.</b> We applied a qualitative modelling approach based only on the sign and direction of effects among species, and present a formula for predicting changes in equilibrium abundances considering stress on multiple variables simultaneously. We then applied this technique retrospectively to identify the most likely set of initiators. Our analyses allowed identification of {{a unique set of}} four initiators in the studied intertidal system (a group of algae, sessile invertebrates, a group of herbivores and starfish), which were hypothesized to be the primary drivers of the observed changes in community structure. In addition, a hypothesis was derived about how the perturbation affected these initiators. The hypothesis is that pollution affected negatively the population growth rate of both algae and sessile invertebrates and suppressed the interaction between herbivores and starfish. Our analytic approach, focused on identifying initiators, constitutes an advance towards understanding the mechanisms underlying human-driven ecosystem disruption and permits identifying species that may serve as a focal point for community management and restoration.

40|$|Thirty years ago, Jacob, Cuzin, and Brenner {{proposed}} the replicon model of DNA replication {{to describe the}} regulation of Escherichia coli chromosomal duplication (Jacob et al. 1964).

The finding {{that a number of}} bacteriophage and eukaryotic viruses use a similar mechanism to replicate their genomes supports the generality of this model (Challberg and Kelly 1989; Stillman 1989).

To extend this level of analysis {{to the study of}} eukaryotic chromosomal replication, we have investigated the architecture of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae origin recognition complex (ORC) bound to yeast origins of replication. Determination of DNA residues important for ORC-origin association indicated that ORC interacts preferentially with one strand of the ARS 1 origin of replication. DNA binding assays using ORC complexes lacking one of the six subunits demonstrated that the DNA binding domain of ORC requires the coordinate action of five of the six ORC subunits. Protein-DNA cross-linking studies suggested that recognition of origin sequences is mediated primarily by two different groups of ORC subunits that make sequence-specific contacts with two distinct regions of the DNA. Implications of these findings for ORC function and the mechanism of initiation of eukaryotic DNA replication are discussed...|$|R

However, in these assays, the yeast TATA-binding protein, which previously was shown to function similarly to mammalian TFIID, could not efficiently substitute for the mammalian TFIID fraction.

It then calculates the expected broadcast time (EBT) for each tree, which is useful to estimate {{the time for the}} root node of a tree to broadcast a game state to all tree nodes. Finally, the tree with the smallest EBT is selected as the communication tree and its root is designated as the coordinator, which collects time stamped actions of each player, executes the game logic, and then broadcasts the new game state.

5000|$|The {{signals from}} the various sensors are fed into the Airbag control unit, which determines from them the angle of impact, the severity, or force of the crash, along with other variables. Depending on the result of these calculations, the ACU may also deploy various {{additional}} restraint devices, such as seat belt pre-tensioners, and/or airbags (including frontal bags for driver and front passenger, along with seat-mounted side bags, and [...] "curtain" [...] airbags which cover the side glass). Each restraint device is typically activated {{with one or more}} pyrotechnic devices, commonly <b>called</b> an <b>initiator</b> or electric match. The electric match, which consists of an electrical conductor wrapped in a combustible material, activates with a current pulse between 1 and 3 amperes in less than 2 milliseconds. When the conductor becomes hot enough, it ignites the combustible material, which initiates the gas generator. In a seat belt pre-tensioner, this hot gas is used to drive a piston that pulls the slack out of the seat belt. In an airbag, the initiator is used to ignite solid propellant inside the airbag inflator. The burning propellant generates inert gas which rapidly inflates the airbag in approximately 20 to 30 milliseconds. An airbag must inflate quickly in order to be fully inflated by the time the forward-traveling occupant reaches its outer surface. Typically, the decision to deploy an airbag in a frontal crash is made within 15 to 30 milliseconds after the onset of the crash, and both the driver and passenger airbags are fully inflated within approximately 60-80 milliseconds after the first moment of vehicle contact. If an airbag deploys too late or too slowly, the risk of occupant injury from contact with the inflating airbag may increase. Since more distance typically exists between the passenger and the instrument panel, the passenger airbag is larger and requires more gas to fill it.|$|R

40|$|Low {{molecular}} weight homopolymers of methylmethacrylate and tertbutylmethacrylate were polymerized by the controlled process of ATRP- Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization. The procedure for initiation of an ATRP reaction employs a molecule, either a small molecule, macromolecule, or a functionalized surface, {{with one or}} more transferable atoms or groups, most often a (pseudo) halide, that undergoes a one electron redox reaction with a transition metal catalyst forming the reactive species. In all of the published literature on ATRP this RBr molecule has been <b>called</b> the <b>initiator</b> even though in contrast to standard free radical polymerization the molecule is an inherently thermally stable entity and is incorporated in its entirety into the final polymer. This sequence can repeat itself, until the desired level of consumption of the monomer is reached, resulting in the synthesis of polymers with predetermined {{molecular weight}}s (DPn = ^[M]/[RBr] 0) and low polydispersities (Mw/Mn < 1. 5). The advantage of ATRP is that it provides great freedom for the choice of both initiator and catalyst complex. P(methylmethacrylate) was further used as a macroinitiator in the polymerization of tertbutylmethacrylate resulting in the copolymer P(methylmethacrylate) -b-P(tertbutyl methacrylate). P(tertbutylmethacrylate) was also used as macroinitiator in the polymerization of P(methylmethacrylate) resulting in the copolymer P(tertbutylmethacrylate-b-P(methylmethacrylate). N-Hydroxysuccinimidemethacrylate monomer was synthesized and successfully used in homopolymer. The initiating system was composed of a ligand, a copperhalogen and a initiator. N,N,N 1,N 11,N 111 -heksametyltrietylentetramin and N,N,NI,NII, NII-pentametyldietylentriamin were used as ligand, copper(I) bromide and copper(I) chloride were used as metalhalogen and ethyl 2 -bromoisobutyrate, trichloroethanol and para-toluensulfonylchloride as initiator. The main part of the reactions was carried out using N,N,N 1,N 11,N 111 -heksametyltrietylentetramin, copper(I) bromide and para-toluene sulfonylchloride. They were chosen because the initiator was easy to analyse and the ligand gave reproducable results. The complex ligand/copper structure is not readily fully understood.

40|$|A {{preliminary}} study demonstrated {{the existence of}} a fractal structure for perforator arterial vessels of the skin and proved to be a useful tool to compare vascular trees {{on the basis of their}} complexity. Fractal analysis of axial-perforator arteriovenous vascular trees was performed on the skin of mice after injection of the arterial network by india ink. Fractal analysis was performed by box counting. Fractal dimension D was determined for 35 venous and 31 arterial perforator vessels (D = 1. 302 and 1. 264, respectively) and 5 venous and 3 arterial axial vessels (D = 1. 374 and 1. 328, respectively) (r 2 ≥ 0. 985). All vascular networks show a fractal structure, characterized by a specific D. These values are relatively constant; D is a function of the anatomic and physiologic characteristics. There was no significant difference between venous and arterial networks, nor was there between axial and perforator networks (p < 0. 05); this demonstrates a similar efficacy in terms of perfusion of the skin. A computer simulation based on fractal theory has been developed to reproduce the two kinds of vascular networks. Fractals are the result of a construction procedure that is repeated and repeated so that the iteration of a very simple rule can produce seemingly complex shapes, such as vascular networks. The basic module that is repeated in the whole structure is Y-shaped and is termed the generator; this generator is applied to a basic structure, <b>called</b> the <b>initiator.</b> After a few iterations, a vascular network is obtained. The difference between axial and perforator vascular networks is the choice of the initiator, whereas the generator is identical. The growth of the two kinds of perfusions appears in the same tissue environment; there is no reason why, in the same tissue, for an identical physiologic function, there should be a difference in the growing pattern of these vessels. Only the origin of these blood vessels is different, and this is taken into account by the model in having different initiators; this explains the difference in macroscopic aspects. Finally, several variables of this mathematical model are discussed. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
