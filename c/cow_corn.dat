Sixteen multiparous Holstein cows were assigned to 1 of 8 dietary treatments as total mixed rations (TMR) containing [dry matter (DM) basis] 45 % corn silage, 5 % coarsely chopped wheat straw, and 50 % concentrate mixture. The 8 treatments were formulated to differ in dietary CP (14 and 16 %; DM basis) and {{in the balance of}} absorbable AA achieved by changing the main protein source (MPS) of the concentrate mixtures [replacing soybean meal (SBM) with corn byproducts (CBP), dried corn distillers grains (DDG), and some corn gluten meal], and by adding a mixture of rumen-protected Lys and Met (RPLM).

Our simulations indicate that a variation of ivNDFd by + 1. 0 % changes the NEl of corn silage to have an expected variation in milk yield of + 0. 15 kg/d. If the ivNDFd is also used to predict the corn silage DMI then a + 1. 0 % variation in ivNDFd of corn silage produces an overall + 0. 23 kg/d MY variation.

By measuring daily biogas production, the concentrations of CH 4 and CO 2 in the marsh gas, TC, the concentration of VFAs and pH value, The results show that under the mixture ratio of 2 ∶ 1, the hydrolysis rate constants, cumulative biogas yield and biodegradability CH 4 reach their high limits, which are 0. 043 7 d- 1 , 271. 93 mL/g and 71. 59 %, respectively. Moreover, it is found that the concentration of acetic acid is proportional to the amount of cow manure at the beginning (the first day) of mixed fermentation, and the concentration of propionicacid is proportional to the amount of corn straw in medium fermentation stage (the fifth day). In addition, rate-limiting step of biogas production is related to the ratio of <b>cow</b> manure and <b>corn</b> in fermentation material.

Two cuttings of oat-berseem clover hay were harvested during the summer before forage was allowed to stockpile for winter grazing. In 1995, a brown midrib sorghum x sudangrass hybrid was seeded into a field adjacent to a corn field. After corn grain harvest in 1994 and 1995, Charolais x Angus x Simmental cows in midgestation were allotted to replicated fields containing corn crop residues with no complementary forages at 2. 5 acres/cow, or corn crop residues and stockpiled berseem clover (2 : 1) at 2. 5 acres/cow to simultaneously graze, or to a drylot. In 1995, cows were allotted to fields containing corn crop residues and brown midrib sorghum x sudangrass (7 : 3) at 2. 5 acres/cow. Berseem clover had greater concentrations of digestible organic matter and crude protein than corn crop residues at the initiation of grazing, but had a more rapid decrease in digestible organic matter concentration than corn crop residues. Brown midrib sorghum x sudangrass forage also had a higher initial concentration of digestible organic matter, but an equal rate of decrease in digestible organic matter concentration to corn crop residues in ungrazed areas of the field. Cows grazing berseem clover with corn crop residues had greater body condition score increases {{during the first half}} of the grazing season than <b>cows</b> grazing <b>corn</b> crop residues without complementary forages. <b>Cows</b> grazing <b>corn</b> crop residues without complementary forages required 2, 786 and 1, 412 less lb hay per cow than cows maintained in a drylot in 1994 and 1995. In 1994, simultaneous grazing of berseem clover with corn crop residues did not reduce hay feeding more than feeding corn crop residues alone. However, in 1995, grazing berseem clover or brown midrib sorghum x sudangrass with corn crop residues reduced the amount of hay required to maintain cows by 358 and 376 lb hay per cow compared with grazing corn crop residues without complementary forage...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine if feeding carbohydrate supplements with faster degradation rates than <b>corn</b> to dairy <b>cows</b> grazing ryegrass would improve nitrogen capture, milk production, and components. Treatments were grain supplements based on: 1) corn (CORN), 2) barley and molasses (BM), or 3) citrus pulp and molasses (CM). For BM and CM, the diet composition was the same as that of CORN except that a portion of the corn was replaced with barley and molasses or citrus pulp and molasses, respectively, on a dry matter basis. Cows grazed ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) pasture. Yield of milk, 3. 5 % fat-corrected milk, energy-corrected milk, and milk fat, as well as milk fat percentage, were not different among treatments. True milk protein percentage was higher for CORN (2. 81 %) compared with CM (2. 70 %), but was not different for BM (2. 77 %). However, true milk protein yield was not different among treatments. Milk urea N was higher for BM(11. 43 mg/dL) compared with both CORN and CM (average: 9. 95 mg/dL). There were no differences among CORN, BM, and CM treatments for overall BUN (average: 10. 60 mg/dL). At 0400 h, however, <b>cows</b> on <b>CORN</b> had higher BUN than cows on CM(11. 43 vs. 9. 96 mg/dL), but there were no differences between CORN and BM (average: 11. 21 mg/dL) or BM and CM (average: 10. 48 mg/dL), and there were no differences among treatments at other time points. The CM diet might have shown more advantage if the pasture crude protein content was higher. Partial replacement of corn with citrus pulp for grazing cows should be further studied using pasture with higher crude protein content. Although cows receiving CM and BM did not produce more milk than <b>cows</b> on <b>CORN,</b> if barley or citrus pulp is less expensive than corn, they may be viable replacements for a portion of the corn supplement for grazing cows...|$|R
5000|$|There {{had been}} a long history of quarrelling between the abbots of Hartland Abbey and the Dinham family, founders of the abbey, mainly {{concerning}} patronage and occupation of the abbey during a vacancy. In 1397 Abbot Philip Tone claimed as abbot the lordship of the manor of Stoke St Nectan, near the parish church of St Nectan, Hartland, and claimed thereby view of frankpledge from the residents of that manor. In August that year Dinham was accused by the Abbot of Hartland of [...] "breaking into his houses, assaulting him and chasing him to his chamber and ill-treating his servants". Dinham with his armed supporters appeared at the abbey, [...] "and so ill-used him that his life was despaired of, took timber and goods to the value of £20, killed 22 sheep, carried off 2 <b>cows,</b> depastured <b>corn</b> and grass, imprisoned his servant, assaulted and ill-used his men, servants and bondsmen".|$|R

40|$|Nutritional {{recommendations}} {{concern the}} reduction of the consumption of certain saturated fatty acids (SFA), which are associated with the risk of cardio-vascular diseases, in favour of increased amounts of unsaturated fatty acids (UFA) in the human diet. In this context, adapting the FA profile of high-fat content dairy products such as cheeses is of considerable interest for industrials and consumers. The objectives of this study were i) to produce an experimental UFA-enriched milk by adapting the <b>cows</b> diet (<b>corn</b> silage + grass silage + rapeseed) and to collect control milk in a local dairy plant during winter season (corn silage based diet), ii) to evaluate the possibility of manufacturing mould-ripened soft cheeses, iii) to characterize the physico-chemical and sensory properties of the UFA-enriched and control cheeses. Camembert-type cheeses have been chosen since they are highly appreciated by French consumers and about 108. 000 tons are produced each year (CNIEL 2009). These experiments have been performed in the project “AGILAIT” (ANR 06 -PNRA- 012) ...|$|R
