In the paper we discuss some possible applications that <b>can</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> derived sub-schema similarities and we illustrate some experiments we have conducted for testing the validity of our approach. Finally, a comparison of the proposed approach with some related ones already presented in the literature, as well as a real example case aiming at better clarifying it, are presented. ...|$|E

Databases are kept and the existing applications can still work on them, but the user <b>can</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> the new ontological view of the data, and exploit powerful reasoning and information integration services, including: problem-solving, consistency checking, and consistent query answering. Importantly, powerful rule-based reasoning can be carried out in mass-memory allowing to deal also with data-intensive applications...|$|E

This task is approached by analytical computation of particle trajectory, by parts, considering the constant fields within each finite element.

Among the examples presented in this paper, an interesting alternative approach for positive ion extraction from cyclotrons is shown, using strip-foils. Other particle optics devices <b>can</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> a method such the one proposed in this paper, as beam bending devices, spectrometers, among others.

Knowledge {{discovery}} in databases or data mining is the semi-automated analysis of {{large volumes of}} data, looking for the relationships and knowledge that are implicit in large volumes of data and are ’inter-esting ’ {{in the sense of}} impacting an organization’s practice. Data mining and knowledge discovery on large amounts of data <b>can</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> the use of parallel computers both to improve performance and quality of data selection. This paper presents and discusses different forms of par-allelism that can be exploited in data mining techniques and algorithms. For the main data mining techniques, such as rule induction, clustering algorithms, decision trees, genetic algorithms, and neural networks, the possible ways to exploit parallelism are presented and discussed in detail. Finally, some promising research directions in the parallel data mining research area are outlined. ...|$|E
30|$|There is a {{limitation}} in main {{aim of the}} study because upon inclusion, patients had normal MCTt values and MCC times were at the upper limits of the normal range. Hence, no large improvements could be expected from a one to two week course of treatment. Considering these baseline values, the observed improvement in MCC can indeed be interpreted as clinically convincing. The greater success of the MD on the MCC times could depend on its hyper osmolarity. Hypertonic solutions are more helpful than isotonic solution since the drainage of the solutes into the inner “sol” layer <b>can</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> the dilution induced by the osmotic effect (Rashid et al. 1999). MCTt is expression of the equilibrium between both the inner “sol” layer and the outer “gel” layer and therefore, it needs prolonged or repeated treatments before a change could be appreciated.|$|E
30|$|Whilst {{it seems}} rather {{difficult}} {{to claim that}} APSK outperforms QAM in ideal conditions, the scenario can change when considering the impact of nonlinearities. In fact, in this case, APSK <b>can</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> its low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR): a modulation with low PAPR is more suitable for transmission when using power amplifiers with nonlinear characteristic, like traveling wave tube amplifiers (TWTAs), onboard of satellites, or solid state power amplifiers (SSPAs), on handheld devices for tactical applications. In particular, this feature allows operating with a smaller back-off, thus increasing the energy efficiency of the system[9]. Dually, once having fixed the working point on the amplifier characteristic, the low PAPR allows minimizing many effects of nonlinear distortion, like warping, clustering and spectral regrowing, which is caused by intermodulation products and is responsible for adjacent channel interference (ACI)[10].|$|E
