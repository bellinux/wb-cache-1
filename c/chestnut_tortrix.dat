50|$|Cydia splendana, the <b>chestnut</b> <b>tortrix,</b> is a moth of the Tortricidae family. It {{is found}} in Europe. It {{is also known as}} the acorn moth, but this can also refer to Blastobasis glandulella from North America, which belongs to the more {{primitive}} family Blastobasidae.|$|E
40|$|<b>Chestnut</b> <b>tortrix</b> Cydia splendana (Hbn) (Lepidoptera: Torticidae) and Chestnut weevil Curculio elephas (Gyllenhal) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) {{are known}} as the most {{important}} pests and yield losses due to these pests may reach 50 % in chestnut growing areas of our country. In this research, infestation ratios of 24 different chestnut cultivars and insect pests were determined by sampled according to harvest time in Yildirim, Karacabey and Inegol towns of Bursa province, Bandirma town in Balikesir province and Karamursel town in Kocaeli province in 2010. It was seen that C. splendana and C. elephas cause the infestation. In the early period the Chestnut leafroller Pammene fasciana (Linnaeus, 1761) (Lepidoptera: Torticidae) larvae were also found. The mean infestation ratio for different chestnut cultivars in Bursa province ranged 6. 8 – 40 % in Fidyekizik (Yildirim town), 25. 6 – 34. 5 % in Cumalikizik (Yildirim town), 18 – 32 % in Yenikoy (Karacabey town) and % 11. 7 - 18. 1 in Kestane alani village (Inegol town). These ratios in other provinces were found 12. 6 – 57. 8 % in Tepe village (Kocaeli–Karamürsel) and 7. 5 – 28 % in Cakil village (Balikesir-Bandirma). According to these results; at least infestation ratio 6. 8 % in Demirci cultivar (Fidyekizik) and the highest 57. 8 % in Firdola cultivar(Tepe village) were determined among the examined chestnut cultivars...|$|E
40|$|The INTERFRUTA {{project is}} {{financed by the}} European Commission Interreg III-B Programme and was {{developed}} for the islands of “Madeira”, “Tenerife” and “Terceira”, {{for the improvement of}} fruit and vineyard production in these three Atlantic regions. The project goal is a better knowledge of the phytossanitary problems that affect apples, bananas, chestnut and vineyards, applying methods that will contribute to solutions based on the survey of key pests, diseases and beneficial organisms. In the three fruit crops and vineyards analyzed, the methodology used was mainly direct observation of predefined parts of each plant (such as leaves and flowers) on which pests might be expected to occur. The key pest C. capitata was monitored as adults using sexual lures in a net of traps around the island of “Terceira” up to 200 meters altitude. The beneficial insect survey was conducted using the beating technique. For diseases, a direct sampling was carried out by the observation of 10 % of the plants in each orchard or vineyard plot looking for visible symptoms. In apples and vineyards, flowers and branches were collected and tested for microorganisms using serologic and molecular techniques (Elisa and PCR). In banana plantations, the most damaging pests were banana weevil, thrips and a fungi complex that causes symptoms similar to Fusarium wilt. In chestnut, the pest that causes the most severe damage, affecting around 40 % of the nuts produced, is the <b>Chestnut</b> <b>tortrix,</b> but there were some difficulties in identifying which of the three known species was present in the Azores islands. In vineyards, diseases that are most frequent and important include grapevine downy mildew, powdery mildew and Botrytis. Invertebrate pests included grape leafhoppers, thrips and eriophyid mites. The European vine moth was also surveyed but none were found and is still not present. In apple orchards the most important problems were thrips, mites, oriental fruit moth and codling moth. Anarsia lineatella Zeller, the peach twig borer, was not detected and new Eriophyid species have been recorded {{for the first time in}} the Azores as a result of the surveys. With the information collected it was possible to create a phytossanitary diagnostic database for the Macaronesian islands (PROFITOMAC) on the project internet pages (www. interfruta. uac. pt), to help users to identify problems that affect the studied cultures...|$|E
