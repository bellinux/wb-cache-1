500|$|... "Mass Effect 2: Lair of the Shadow Broker" [...] was {{developed}} by BioWare and published by Electronic Arts. During development of Mass Effect 2, Bioware stated that downloadable content was becoming a fundamental part of the company's overall philosophy. The pack was announced to be in development on July 22, 2010 {{with the release of}} three brand-new screenshots of the game. BioWare stated that the decisions players make in the pack would affect certain storylines in the then-upcoming Mass Effect 3. Animating the Shadow Broker's face was a challenge for the developers. According to BioWare, the game's default digital-acting system [...] "could not handle the stresses of the new face, so <b>custom</b> <b>work</b> had to be done to animate his multiple eyes and triangular mouth." [...] The pack was released on September 7, 2010 for Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360. Like Mass Effect 2s earlier downloadable content packs [...] "" [...] and [...] "", [...] "Lair of the Shadow Broker" [...] is freely included in the PlayStation 3 edition of the game, which was released on January 18, 2011. The soundtrack was composed by Christopher Lennertz, who previously penned the music for the [...] "Overlord" [...] downloadable content.|$|E
500|$|The fashion press {{tends to}} take special {{interest}} in First Ladies. The traditional role of a First Lady as the nation's hostess puts her personal appearance and style under scrutiny, and the attention to Pat was lively. Women's Wear Daily stated that Pat had a [...] "good figure and good posture", as well as [...] "the best-looking legs of any woman in public life today". Some fashion writers tended to have a lackluster opinion of her well tailored, but nondescript, American-made clothes. [...] "I consider it my duty to use American designers", she said, and favored them because, [...] "they are now using so many materials which are great for traveling because they're non crushable". She preferred to buy readymade garments rather than made-to-order outfits. [...] "I'm a size 10," [...] she told The New York Times. [...] "I can just walk in and buy. I've bought things in various stores in various cities. Only some of my clothes are by designers." [...] She did, however, wear the <b>custom</b> <b>work</b> of some well-known talents, notably Geoffrey Beene, {{at the suggestion of}} Clara Treyz, her personal shopper. Many fashion observers concluded that Pat Nixon did not greatly advance the cause of American fashion. Nixon's yellow-satin inaugural gown by Harvey Berin was criticized as [...] "a schoolteacher on her night out", but Treyz defended her wardrobe selections by saying, [...] "Mrs. Nixon must be ladylike." ...|$|E
60|$|It exhaled this {{breath in}} a sigh, faint and unheard; her tribute, while {{she stood there}} before speaking, to realities looming through the golden mist that {{had already begun to}} be scattered. The {{conditions}} facing her had yielded, for the time, to the golden mist--had considerably melted away; but there they were again, definite, and it was for the next quarter of an hour as if she could have counted them one by one on her fingers. Sharp to her above all was the renewed attestation of her father's comprehensive acceptances, which she had so long regarded as of the same quality with her own, but which, so distinctly now, she should have the complication of being obliged to deal with separately. They had not yet struck her as absolutely extraordinary--which had made for her lumping them with her own, since her view of her own had but so lately begun to change; though it instantly stood out for her that there was really no new judgment of them she should be able to show without attracting in some degree his attention, without perhaps exciting his surprise and making thereby, for the situation she shared with him, some difference. She was reminded and warned by the concrete image; and for a minute Charlotte's face, immediately presented to her, affected her as searching her own to see the reminder tell. She had not less promptly kissed her stepmother, and then had bent over her father, from behind, and laid her cheek upon him; little amenities tantamount heretofore to an easy change of guard--Charlotte's own frequent, though always cheerful, term of comparison for this process of transfer. Maggie figured thus as the relieving sentry, and so smoothly did use and <b>custom</b> <b>work</b> for them that her mate might even, on this occasion, after acceptance of the pass-word, have departed without irrelevant and, in strictness, unsoldierly gossip. This was not, none the less, what happened; inasmuch as if our young woman had been floated over her first impulse to break the existing charm at a stroke, it yet took her but an instant to sound, at any risk, the note she had been privately practising. If she had practised it the day before, at dinner, on Amerigo, she knew but the better how to begin for it with Mrs. Verver, and it immensely helped her, for that matter, to be able at once to speak of the Prince as having done more to quicken than to soothe her curiosity. Frankly and gaily she had come to ask--to ask what, in their unusually prolonged campaign, the two had achieved. She had got out of her husband, she admitted, what she could, but husbands were never the persons who answered such questions ideally. He had only made her more curious, and she had arrived early, this way, in order to miss as little as possible of Charlotte's story.|$|E
