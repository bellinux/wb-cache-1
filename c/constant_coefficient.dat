We study locally <b>constant</b> <b>coefficients.</b> We {{first study}} {{the theory of}} homotopy Kan extensions with locally <b>constant</b> <b>coefficients</b> in model categories, and explain how it characterizes the homotopy theory of small categories. We explain how to interpret {{this in terms of}} left Bousfield localization of categories of diagrams with values in a combinatorial model category. At last, we explain how the theory of homotopy Kan extensions in derivators can be used to understand locally constant functors. Contents 1.

25|$|Homogeneous linear {{differential}} equations are a subclass of linear {{differential equations}} {{for which the}} space of solutions is a linear subspace i.e. the sum of any set of solutions or multiples of solutions is also a solution. The coefficients of the unknown function and its derivatives in a linear differential equation are allowed to be (known) functions of the independent variable or variables; if these coefficients are constants then one speaks of a <b>constant</b> <b>coefficient</b> linear differential equation.|$|E
25|$|Friction. This {{is a force}} always {{opposing}} the forward motion, whereby the vector invariably acts in the negative direction s with an effect to reduce the speed. The friction at play in the balanced-flow models is the one exerted by the roughness of the Earth's surface on the air moving higher above. For simplicity, we here assume that the frictional force (per unit mass) adjusts to the parcel's speed proportionally through a <b>constant</b> <b>coefficient</b> of friction K. In more realistic conditions, the dependence of friction on the speed is non-linear except for slow laminar flows.|$|E

2500|$|In {{this section}} we {{consider}} {{various aspects of}} the phenomenon of stiffness.

[...] We shall also see several qualitative statements that can be (and mostly have been) made in an attempt to encapsulate the notion of stiffness, and state what is probably the most satisfactory of these as a 'definition' of stiffness.|$|E
