All intra-EU transfers in euro are treated as domestic transactions and bear the corresponding domestic transfer costs. This includes all member states of the EU, even those outside the eurozone providing the transactions are carried out in euro. Credit/debit card charging and ATM withdrawals within the eurozone are also treated as domestic transactions; however paper-based payment orders, like cheques, have not been standardised so these are still domestic-based. The ECB has also set up a <b>clearing</b> <b>system,</b> TARGET, for large euro transactions.|$|E

For this reason, interbank transfers of funds and other transactions need to be facilitated, both within and between countries. Interbank <b>clearing</b> <b>systems</b> enable this transfer, clearing and settlement of funds between banks. Clearing is an accounting process by which banks determine the total amount of funds which they owe other banks or which other banks owe them (based on interbank payments) and then pay each other the difference to `balance the books' (Tyree 1998). Settlement, by contrast, refers to the actual payment of the difference and/or the one of two ways in which the payment is done (General Government Division 1997; Tyree 1998) :. deferred net settlement, where settlement (or payment) occurs between the banks once a day (see Figure 1); or. real time gross settlement, where settlement occurs immediately when the payment is made between the customers of the two banks concerned (see Figure 2).
