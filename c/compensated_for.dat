5|$|Elemental bismuth is denser in {{the liquid}} phase than the solid, a {{characteristic}} it shares with germanium, silicon, gallium and water. Bismuth expands 3.32% on solidification; therefore, {{it was long}} a component of low-melting typesetting alloys, where it <b>compensated</b> <b>for</b> the contraction of the other alloying components, to form almost isostatic bismuth-lead eutectic alloys.|$|E
5|$|In 168 BC, {{the land}} tax rate was reduced from one-fifteenth of a farming household's crop yield to one-thirtieth, {{and later to}} a one-hundredth of a crop yield for the last decades of the dynasty. The {{consequent}} loss of government revenue was <b>compensated</b> <b>for</b> by increasing property taxes.|$|E
5|$|In June 1873, Lee left Dublin for London {{and never}} returned. A {{fortnight}} later, Bessie followed him; {{the two girls}} joined her. Shaw's explanation of why his mother followed Lee was that without the latter's financial contribution the joint household had to be broken up. Left in Dublin with his father, Shaw <b>compensated</b> <b>for</b> the absence of music in the house by teaching himself to play the piano.|$|E

A user can estimate the range to objects of known size, the size of objects at known distances, and even roughly <b>compensate</b> <b>for</b> both bullet drop and wind drifts at known ranges with a reticle-equipped scope.|$|R
5|$|The Hindu {{religion}} regards Hell {{not as a}} {{place of}} lasting permanence, but as an alternate domain from which an individual can return to the present world after crimes in the previous life have been <b>compensated</b> <b>for.</b> These crimes are eventually nullified through an equal punishment in the next life. The concept of Hell has provided many different opportunities for the Hindu religion including narrative, social and economic functions.|$|E
5|$|Troika used first-person {{perspective}} to immerse the {{player in the}} setting, interacting face-to-face with the characters and seeing their facial reactions to the player. It chose to follow a single-character to aid the immersion, creating the isolation of a vampire unable to trust any other character. This aided the story and <b>compensated</b> <b>for</b> the technical issues of allowing multiple player characters.|$|E
5|$|During Titus' {{second visit}} to the {{disaster}} area, a fire struck Rome which lasted for three days. Although {{the extent of the}} damage was not as disastrous as during the Great Fire of 64, crucially sparing the many districts of insulae, Cassius Dio records a long list of important public buildings that were destroyed, including Agrippa's Pantheon, the Temple of Jupiter, the Diribitorium, parts of Pompey's Theatre and the Saepta Julia among others. Once again, Titus personally <b>compensated</b> <b>for</b> the damaged regions. According to Suetonius, a plague similarly struck during the fire. The nature of the disease, however, or the death toll are unknown.|$|E

5|$|In the 20th century, Scotland {{played a}} major role in the British and allied effort in the two world wars and began to suffer a sharp {{industrial}} decline, going through periods of considerable political instability. The decline was particularly acute in the second half of the 20th century, but was <b>compensated</b> <b>for</b> to a degree by the development of an extensive oil industry, technological manufacturing and a growing service sector. This period also increasing debates about the place of Scotland within the United Kingdom, the rise of the Scottish National Party and after a referendum in 1999 the establishment of a devolved Scottish Parliament.|$|E
5|$|In the Peace of Westphalia, Frederick William was <b>compensated</b> <b>for</b> Western Pomerania {{with the}} secularized bishoprics of Halberstadt and Minden {{and the right}} of {{succession}} to the likewise secularized Archbishopric of Magdeburg. With Halberstadt, Brandenburg-Prussia also gained several smaller territories: the Lordship of Derenburg, the County of Regenstein, the Lordship of Klettenberg and the Lordship of Lohra. This was primarily due to French efforts to counterbalance the power of the Habsburg emperor by strengthening the Hohenzollern, and while Frederick William valued these territories lower than Western Pomerania, they became step-stones {{for the creation of a}} closed, dominant realm in Germany in the long run.|$|E

5|$|King {{stated that}} black Americans, {{as well as}} other {{disadvantaged}} Americans, should be <b>compensated</b> <b>for</b> historical wrongs. In an interview conducted for Playboy in 1965, he said that granting black Americans only equality could not realistically close the economic gap between them and whites. King said that he did not seek a full restitution of wages lost to slavery, which he believed impossible, but proposed a government compensatory program of $50billion over ten years to all disadvantaged groups.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is left of}} the old Ashford town centre, {{apart from}} a cluster of medieval half-timbered {{buildings}} in Middle Row and around the churchyard in the town centre. A number of old buildings were removed {{to make way for the}} controversial ring road around the centre, including four public houses. Further demolition was required to build Charter House, an eight-story office building for Charter Consolidated, that opened in 1975. Charter subsequently moved back to London in 1985, and the building is now being converted into flats, though progress stalled owing to the discovery of asbestos. Charter <b>compensated</b> <b>for</b> the demolition by funding a restoration scheme on North Street, preserving several historic buildings.|$|E
5|$|McCarthy's {{judicial}} career attracted {{some controversy}} {{because of the}} speed with which he dispatched many of his cases as he worked to clear the heavily backlogged docket he had inherited. Wisconsin had strict divorce laws, but when McCarthy heard divorce cases, he expedited them whenever possible, and he made the needs of children involved in contested divorces a priority. When it came to other cases argued before him, McCarthy <b>compensated</b> <b>for</b> his lack of experience as a jurist by demanding and relying heavily upon precise briefs from the contesting attorneys. The Wisconsin Supreme Court reversed a low percentage of the cases he heard, but he was also censured in 1941 for having lost evidence in a price fixing case.|$|E
40|$|Obligation to <b>compensate</b> <b>for</b> {{personal}} injury {{in connection with}} provision of health care This dissertation {{is focused on the}} obligation to <b>compensate</b> <b>for</b> {{personal injury}} in connection with the provision of health care. The aim of the dissertation is to analyse relevant general elements of the obligation to <b>compensate</b> <b>for</b> personal injury as well as relevant special elements of such obligation. The dissertation surveys the interpretation of conceptual changes related to the recodification of Czech private law in the area of tort law in connection with the provision of health care. Legal basis of the doctor-patient relationship will also be analysed because such analysis is crucial for determination which elements of the obligation to <b>compensate</b> <b>for</b> personal injury will regularly be applied in this field. Therefore, the first chapter is devoted to the legal nature of the doctor-patient relationship. The second chapter deals with the obligation to <b>compensate</b> <b>for</b> personal injury caused by the provision of health care, i. e. with the definition and analysis of relevant elements of such obligation in this field.

He <b>compensated</b> <b>for</b> his late start by taking six courses each term and {{was admitted to}} the undergraduate honor society Phi Beta Kappa. In his first year, he was admitted to graduate standing in physics on the basis of independent study, which meant he was not required to take the basic classes and could enroll instead in advanced ones. He was attracted to experimental physics by a course on thermodynamics that was taught by Percy Bridgman. He graduated summa cum laude in three years.|$|E

The effect of rural flight {{has not been}} spread evenly through South Dakota, however. Although most rural counties and small towns have lost population, the Sioux Falls area and the Black Hills have gained population. In fact, Lincoln County, near Sioux Falls, is the ninth fastest-growing county (by percentage) in the United States. The growth in these areas has <b>compensated</b> <b>for</b> losses {{in the rest of}} the state, and South Dakota's total population continues to increase steadily, albeit at a slower rate than the national average.|$|E

Although most rural {{counties}} and small towns have lost population, the Sioux Falls area, the larger counties along Interstate 29, the Black Hills, and many Indian reservations have all gained population. As the reservations have exercised more sovereignty, some Sioux have returned to them from urban areas. Lincoln County near Sioux Falls was the seventh fastest-growing county (by percentage) in the United States in 2010. The growth in these areas has <b>compensated</b> <b>for</b> losses {{in the rest of}} the state.

5|$|The {{principle}} transit circle was a 3-inch Combined Transit and Zenith telescope {{designed by}} Warner & Swasey especially for Illinois. The objective, by John Brashear, {{was held in}} place by a special cell that <b>compensated</b> <b>for</b> the different temperature conductivities of the brass and glass so that temperature had no effect on the location or separation of the lenses. Designated as model M-505, the transit included a handing level, micrometer and a built in reversing mechanism. This transit was located in the east-central transit room allowing direct access to the clock room through a small window. The instrument cost $1200 in 1896.|$|E

Although the upper basin projects are positive insofar as they will return land to the basin (and water to the river), the same cannot be said about increased urban runoff, the poor quality of which is well known.|$|E
5|$|Another {{element of}} the Commonwealth army {{consisted}} of various private armies fielded by the most powerful magnates. In time of peace these consisted of usually small regiments {{of a few hundred}} men, but at their extreme they could number up to 10,000, including cavalry and artillery. In some instances the magnate contribution could surpass that of the main Commonwealth army on the frontlines, although often the magnates preferred to save their troops, as they were not <b>compensated</b> <b>for</b> the state for their contributions. The troops were paid for and equipped by the richest of the noble families, such as the OpaliÅ„ski, Lubomirski, Potocki, OssoliÅ„ski, Zamoyski, Koniecpolski, Sieniawski, Å»Ã³Å‚kiewski, Sapieha, Chodkiewicz, Pac and RadziwiÅ‚Å‚ families.
