25|$|The high {{probability}} of particle–bubble contact, and subsequent short residence times (five to ten {{seconds in the}} downcomer, allows for a much more compact column design than conventional <b>column</b> <b>flotation</b> cells (see Figure 1). The fine nature of the bubbles (0.3 to 0.5mm in diameter) gives them enhanced carrying capabilities for fine mineral particles. Fine bubbles also improve the separation of minerals, as they intensify {{the difference in the}} flotation kinetics of the valuable minerals from the gangue minerals, thus allowing higher grade concentrates to be produced.|$|E

2500|$|... easily scaled up – the {{hydrodynamic}} {{conditions for}} particle collection inside the downcomer and separation {{in the tank}} are identical between the laboratory, pilot plant and industrial-scale Jameson Cell, meaning that there is direct scale-up. This makes predicting plant performance for small-scale tests straightforward. In contrast, factors have {{to be used to}} scale-up the design of mechanical and <b>column</b> <b>flotation</b> cells.|$|E
40|$|Since {{measurements}} of recovery and grade are often complex and inaccurate, <b>flotation</b> <b>columns</b> are controlled using secondary variables, such as froth depth, bias and gas hold-up. This paper describes {{the control of}} the froth depth and the bias of a pilot <b>flotation</b> <b>column</b> by manipulating the tails and the wash water flowrate setpoints. Using two virtual sensors, one for the froth depth and the other for the bias, a multivariable controller using a Global Predictive Control (GlobPC) structure is implemented. GlobPC is a predictive control algorithm using three different controllers for tracking, disturbance rejection and feedforward, thus leading to a perfect decoupling of all modes of control.

50|$|There are {{a number}} of cells able to be used for the {{flotation}} of minerals. these include <b>flotation</b> <b>columns</b> and mechanical <b>flotation</b> cells. The <b>flotation</b> <b>columns</b> are used for finer minerals and they typically have a higher grade and lower recovery of minerals than mechanical flotation cells.

2500|$|However, the {{selectivity}} of {{the collection}} mechanism is not perfect. Some unwanted ("gangue") minerals are also carried into the froth, largely by entrainment with the water rising with the bubbles. This is particularly the case for particles less than 10µm in size. Some of the gangue particles follow the water between the bubbles as it drains back to the underlying pulp. This process can be assisted by the application of sufficient [...] "wash water" [...] to the froth to displace the water entrained with the bubbles and the fine gangue particles brought with them. <b>Column</b> <b>flotation</b> cells, invented in Canada by Boutin and Tremblay in 1961, grew increasingly popular in the 1980s and 1990s {{as a way of}} reducing entrainment of fine gangue particles during [...] "cleaning" [...] of flotation concentrates.

2500|$|The Cell was {{initially}} {{developed as a}} lower-cost alternative to conventional <b>column</b> <b>flotation</b> cells for recovering fine particles, and was first used in the Mount Isa lead–zinc concentrator in 1988. Since then, use of the technology has spread to include coal flotation, base and precious metal flotation, potash flotation, oil sands flotation, molybdenum flotation, graphite flotation and cleaning solvent extraction liquors. Xstrata Technology, Glencore Xstrata's technology marketing arm, listed 328 Jameson Cell installations in May 2013. Cells have been installed by 94 companies in 27 countries. Today, the technology is the standard in the Australian Coal Industry where well over one hundred Cells have been installed to recover coal fines. It is mainly used in metals applications to solve final grade and capacity issues from conventional cell cleaner circuits. It has [...] found a niche in transforming traditional circuit designs where its inclusion allows cleaner circuits to be designed with fewer cells in a smaller footprint, while achieving cleaner and/or higher grade concentrates. It has also made possible the recovery of previously discarded fine materials, such as coal and phosphate fines, thereby increasing the efficiency and extending {{the life of the}} world's non-renewable natural resources.|$|E
