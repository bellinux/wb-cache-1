40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades, {{reliance}} on short-term contracted staff has increased in government institutions across the Western world. This tendency towards <b>contracted</b> <b>government</b> may be strengthened during periods of economic and financial stress. This article therefore poses the following questions: First, does <b>contracted</b> <b>government</b> lead to civil servants less loyal and attentive {{to the concerns of}} their government institutions? Secondly, and more generally, what factors shape the behavioural perceptions of <b>contracted</b> <b>government</b> staff? Benefiting from a new, full-scale survey among seconded national experts in the European Commission, this study shows that contracted Commission staff are largely integrated and committed to the Commission and its administrative sub-units. The general lesson learned is that when under contract, contracted personnel seem mainly loyal and attentive to the concerns of the government institution under which they formally serve. This finding dispels fears that <b>contracted</b> <b>government</b> officials may serve several masters. Theoretically, the behavioural perceptions of contracted Commission officials are explained with reference to their primary organisational affiliation towards the Commission and its sub-units, {{as well as by the}} internal organisational composition of the Commission services.

5000|$|The Diplomatic Conference on Maritime Security held in London in December 2002 adopted new {{provisions}} in the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974 and the ISPS Code (International Ship and Port Facility Security Code) to enhance maritime security.

40|$|When the International Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS) Code and {{amendments}} to the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), 1974 were adopted by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) in December 2002, {{one of the issues}} that remained to be resolved was the long-range identification and tracking (LRIT) of ships. Resolution 3 of the 2002 SOLAS conference called on the IMO to carry out, as a matter of urgency, an impact assessment of the proposals to implement the LRIT of ships and develop and adopt appropriate performance standards and guidelines for the LRIT system. The establishment of the LRIT system aims to complement and support the implementation of the ISPS Code by detecting security threats and taking preventive measures against security incidents affecting ships or port facilities used in international trade. This chapter provides analysis of the status of the LRIT system and legal, administrative, and practical implications of its implementation for states. It also discusses concerns with respect to the draft technical standards for the LRIT system and concludes by highlighting the measures that the IMO and its <b>contracting</b> <b>governments</b> would need to take to advance the implementation of the LRIT system...|$|E

40|$|The ISPS Code {{had come}} into effect on the 1 st of July 2004. The overall {{objectives}} of the Code are to establish an international framework involving co-operation between <b>contracting</b> <b>governments,</b> government agencies, local administrations and the shipping industry to detect maritime security threats and take pro-active measures against potential terrorist attacks against ships and/or port facilities which are the vital instruments of the international trade. The Code aims to reduce the vulnerability of port facilities and merchant ships to terrorist attacks and to increase the secur ity awareness of the industry. The ISPS Code, is the first ever internationally and widely agreed proactive regulatory framework to safeguard the maritime industry, seaborne trade, and the world economy from terrorism. In this study the success level of implementation of the ISPS Code already achieved by the ship managers is analysed through the port state control databases of the major regional maritime administrations and MOUs such as the Paris MOU, the Tokyo MOU, the Black Sea MOU and the United States Coast Guard (USCG). The monthly statistics of ISPS non-compliant ships have been compiled based on the variables such as the ships’ flag, type, gross tonnage (gt), {{and the nature of}} deficiencies between the 1 st July 2004, when the ISPS Code came into force, until the end those of months with available statistics currently released on the websites of the respective MOUs. Common awareness of errors and lapses, best practices, sharing of information, and industry-wide co-operation will play a vital role to develop a security culture in the shipping industry...|$|E
40|$|Following the 9 / 11 attacks, {{concerns}} about maritime terrorism prompted several international legal developments. These included {{amendments to the}} 1974 SOLAS Convention introducing the ISPS Code, and the Long Range Identification and Tracking of ships, with amendments to the 1958 Seafarers Identity Documents Convention also occurring. 2005 also saw the finalisation of amendments to the 1988 SUA treaties to better facilitate the interdiction of suspected terrorist vessels. Additionally, the US-led Proliferation Security Initiative has prompted critical re-thinks about the interdiction powers of States under the 1982 UN Law of the Sea Convention, and in exceptional cases, under Article 51 of the UN Charter. This Study examines {{the extent to which}} the above international agreements are likely to succeed in enabling the prevention of contemporary post- 9 / 11 forms of maritime terrorism. It formulates the Maritime Terrorism Threat Matrix to statistically analyse all the ways in which maritime terrorism incidents have occurred, and might occur in future. The study combines these findings with analyses of how the ISPS Code and LRIT measures have developed since their entry into force, and also examines the debate amongst international legal scholars about the legality of vessel interdictions in the post 9 / 11 maritime security context. Through considering how the above international agreements might apply in practice, the Study highlights the importance of continual and rigorous application of ISPS Code security measures both by <b>contracting</b> <b>governments</b> and at operational levels within maritime industries. Whilst it identifies scope for flexible interpretations of UNCLOS (and possibly Article 51 of the UN Charter) relating to the interdiction of suspected terrorist vessels, it argues for increased ratification of the 2005 SUA Convention to reduce the scope for uncertainty and conflict. Overall the Study demonstrates that the international legal framework for preventing maritime terrorism incidents has been improved since 9 / 11. Going forward, it argues that instead of further reforms or new instruments, the international community’s focus should be on continually refining the prospects for the existing instruments to succeed, and outlines recommendations for how this might be achieved...|$|E
40|$|Public {{managers}} {{and their political}} overseers can choose from several approaches as they decide how to structure the delivery {{of goods and services}} to citizens. The three most common service-delivery modes are: internal service delivery, in which the government produces the entire service; contracts with other governments, private firms, or nonprofit organizations; and joint service-delivery arrangements. Traditionally, governments’ decision to ‘make or buy’ has been framed statically: public {{managers and}} their political overseers select one delivery mode over alternatives and then remain committed to that delivery approach. Of course, in practice, service-delivery choices can be more fluid: internal service delivery can later change to contracts, and contracts can later be internalized. Changing service-delivery modes is a potentially costly undertaking. Governments that elect to switch typically make changes to existing production systems and management systems. Varying costs associated with the alteration of existing production and management systems make switching from some modes of service delivery easier than others, depending in part on how the service was initially delivered. In general, the costs of changing from direct service delivery to contract service delivery are likely to be high: managers have to dedicate significant time and effort to dismantling existing production and management systems and building new ones. On the other hand, the service-delivery decisions of <b>contracting</b> <b>governments</b> {{are likely to be more}} dynamic because they have typically already incurred the costs of changing at a previous date. Sometimes governments internalize services when they have been using joint or contracted service delivery, whereas at other times they remain in the market by switching vendor type. In this paper we examine how governments’ previous service-delivery choices structure their future choices. We analyze panel data from the 1992 and 1997 International City/County Manager Association’s Alternative Service Delivery surveys along with data from the US Census and other sources. Our results suggest that service-delivery choices exhibit strong inertia, although when change occurs the previous service-delivery mode influences the likelihood of changing to other service-delivery modes in important ways. In general, governments which have already internalized the upfront costs of changing modes of service delivery are more likely to approach service-delivery choices more dynamically in future decision making. ...|$|E
