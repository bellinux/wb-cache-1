40|$|The {{content of}} the {{potentially}} health-defensive and disease-preventive flavonoids quercetin, kaempferol, myricetin, apigenin and luteolin of 31 vegetables were determined by RP- HPLC with UV detection. Vegetables were purchased at the local markets in Budapest at a period of their most frequent consumption. Quercetin levels in the edible parts of most vegetables were generally below 10 mg kg- 1, except for onions (67 - 121. 5 mg kg- 1), lettuce (13. 5 - 35. 0 mg kg- 1), dill (74. 5 mg kg- 1), broccoli (15. 5 mg kg- 1) and spinach (272. 2 mg kg- 1). Kaempferol was below 30 mg kg- 1 except for parsnip (66. 4 mg kg- 1) and leek (45. 8 mg kg- 1). Myricetin could only be detected in lettuce, Swedish turnip, parsley and celery leaves, and dill. Detectable amount of luteolin was in radishes, some representatives of Brassica, sweet peppers, celery leaves and spinach while apigenin was only in Swedish <b>turnip,</b> <b>celery</b> <b>root</b> and <b>celery</b> leaves.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of Cr(VI) -induced toxicity in {{plants and animals}} has been assessed for mitochondrial bioenergetics and membrane damage in <b>turnip</b> <b>root</b> and rat liver mitochondria. By using succinate as the respiratory substrate, ADP/O and respiratory control ratio (RCR) were depressed {{as a function of}} Cr(VI) concentration. State 3 and uncoupled respiration were also depressed by Cr(VI). Rat mitochondria revealed a higher sensitivity to Cr(VI), as compared to turnip mitochondria. Rat mitochondrial state 4 respiration rate triplicated in contrast to negligible stimulation of turnip state 4 respiration. Chromium(VI) inhibited the activity of the NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) from rat liver mitochondria and succinate-dehydrogenases (complex II) from plant and animal mitochondria. In rat liver mitochondria, complex I was more sensitive to Cr(VI) than complex II. The activity of cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV) was not sensitive to Cr(VI). Unique for plant mitochondria, exogenous NADH uncoupled respiration was unaffected by Cr(VI), indicating that the NADH dehydrogenase of the outer leaflet of the plant inner membrane, in addition to complexes III and IV, were insensitive to Cr(VI). The ATPase activity (complex V) was stimulated in rat liver mitochondria, but inhibited in <b>turnip</b> <b>root</b> mitochondria. In both, turnip and rat mitochondria, Cr(VI) depressed mitochondrial succinate-dependent transmembrane potential (Deltapsi) and phosphorylation efficiency, but it neither affected mitochondrial membrane permeabilization to protons (H+) nor induced membrane lipid peroxidation. However, Cr(VI) induced mitochondrial membrane permeabilization to K+, an effect that was more pronounced in <b>turnip</b> <b>root</b> than in rat liver mitochondria. In conclusion, Cr(VI) -induced perturbations of mitochondrial bioenergetics compromises energy-dependent biochemical processes and, therefore, may contribute to the basal mechanism underlying its toxic effects in plant and animal cells. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

If these benefits are realized they can improve the sustainability of the system, as cycling, diversity, stability and capacity are enhanced. These changes bring the system to more closely resemble natural systems. Within three experimental years, hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth.), fall rye (Secale cereale L.), yellow sweet clover (Melilotus officinalis L.) and white clover (Trifolium repens L.) were grown as cover crops with cauliflower (Brassica oleracea L. var. botrytis), and compared to monoculture cauliflower.

40|$|Selenium (Se) is an {{essential}} trace element for humans. About 70 % of the regions in China, including most of the Tibetan Plateau, are faced with Se deficiency problems. Turnip is mainly distributed around the Tibetan Plateau {{and is one of}} the few local crops. In the present study, we compared the absorption and translocation differences of Se (IV) selenite and Se (VI) selenate in turnip. The results showed that Se treatment, either by soil addition (0. 2 – 2 mg Se kg− 1 dry soil) or by foliar spraying (50 – 200 mg L− 1 Se), could significantly increase the Se concentrations in turnips, and 0. 5 mg Se (IV) or Se (VI) kg− 1 dry matter in soils could improve the biomasses of turnips. Moreover, turnip absorbed significantly more Se (VI) than Se (IV) at the same concentration and also transferred much more Se (VI) from roots to leaves. Based on the Se concentrations, as well as the bioconcentration factors and translocation coefficients, we considered that turnip might be a potential Se indicator plant. Subsequently, we estimated the daily Se intake for adults based on the Se concentrations in <b>turnip</b> <b>roots.</b> The results indicated that Se (IV) should be more suitable as an artificial Se fertilizer for turnips, although the levels found in most samples in this study could cause selenosis to humans.
