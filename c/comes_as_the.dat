25|$|Martine's former suitor, Lorens, now {{a famous}} general {{married to a}} member of the Queen's court, <b>comes</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> guest of his aunt, the local lady of the manor {{and a member of the}} old pastor's congregation. He is unaware of the other guests' austere plans, and as a man of the world and former attaché in Paris, he is the only person at the table {{qualified}} to comment on the meal. He regales the guests with abundant information about the extraordinary food and drink, comparing it to a meal he enjoyed years earlier at the famous Café Anglais in Paris. Although the other celebrants refuse to comment on the earthly pleasures of their meal, Babette's gifts break down their distrust and superstitions, elevating them physically and spiritually. Old wrongs are forgotten, ancient loves are rekindled, and a mystical redemption of the human spirit settles over the table.|$|E
25|$|As well {{as being}} an {{everyday}} beverage, Turkish coffee is {{also a part of}} the traditional Turkish wedding custom. As a prologue to marriage, the bridegroom's parents (in the lack of his father, his mother and an elderly member of his family) must visit the young girl's family to ask the hand of the bride-to-be and the blessings of her parents upon the upcoming marriage. During this meeting, the bride-to-be must prepare and serve Turkish coffee to the guests. For the groom's coffee, the bride-to-be sometimes uses salt instead of sugar to gauge his character. If the bridegroom drinks his coffee without any sign of displeasure, the bride-to-be assumes that the groom is good-tempered and patient. As the groom already <b>comes</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> demanding party to the girl's house, in fact it is the boy who is passing an exam and etiquette requires him to receive with all smiles this particular present from the girl, although {{in some parts of the}} country this may be considered as a lack of desire on the part of the girl for marriage with that candidate.|$|E

25|$|Roberts and Davies held an {{unofficial}} contest {{to see how}} many references to Christie's works could be inserted. Titles that were noted were: The Murder of Roger Ackroyd; Why Didn't They Ask Evans; The Body in the Library; The Secret Adversary; N or M?; Nemesis; Cat Among the Pigeons; Dead Man's Folly; They Do It With Mirrors; Appointment with Death; Cards on the Table; Sparkling Cyanide; Endless Night; Crooked House; Death in the Clouds; The Moving Finger; Taken at the Flood; Death <b>Comes</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> End; Murder on the Orient Express and The Murder at the Vicarage. A deleted scene referred to The Man in the Brown Suit, referring to the Doctor's clothing. The narrative itself parallels several of Christie's novels: the jewel theft storyline parallels The Secret of Chimneys; Miss Chandrakala's death was influenced by And Then There Were None; and the Colonel's revelation that he was not disabled paralleled a key concept of The Pale Horse. In an email conversation with journalist Benjamin Cook, Davies admitted he had initially added a reference to the original title of And Then There Were None, Ten Little Niggers, but decided it was too risky.|$|E

He considers his vocal style to [...] " [...] from how I feel when I’m singing, when I'm in the zone of writing lyrics and recording which, a lot of times, <b>comes</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> same time.

500|$|On August 23, 1969, Presley was {{featured}} {{on the cover of}} Rolling Stone, with the album receiving the lead review. Peter Guralnick, the magazine's reviewer, described it as [...] "great...

It is his involvement after all which <b>comes</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> surprise." [...] Billboard also published a positive review, saying that Presley had [...] "never sounded better, and the choice of material is perfect". High Fidelity wrote, [...] "Elvis has been through a number of stages, and his latest is the best".|$|E

500|$|Cortana {{returns in}} the third {{installment}} in the Halo series, the 2007 Xbox 360 game Halo 3. During gameplay, Cortana appears to the player in broken transmissions, often reciting lines from Fall of Reach and earlier games. Cortana manages {{to send a message}} to the Master Chief on Earth through a [...] Flood-infected ship. In her message, she states that Gravemind is unaware of the portal opened by a Forerunner artifact on Earth. Cortana continues to appear to the Chief, who later recovers her from Flood-controlled High Charity. Surprised that the Chief has against all odds rescued her (as promised) Cortana produces the Index from Installation 04, which she has kept as a souvenir. With it, Cortana activates a new ringworld being constructed. While the Flood are destroyed as planned, the slipspace portal through which Master Chief, the Arbiter, and Cortana attempt to escape collapses, thus stranding the Chief and Cortana. Cortana activates a distress beacon, but she knows that years could pass before rescue <b>comes.</b> <b>As</b> <b>the</b> Master Chief prepares to go into cryonic sleep to await rescue, Cortana confides to him that she will miss him. He replies to wake him when she needs him.|$|E
2500|$|Maurice Willson Disher said in The Times Literary Supplement of 28 April 1945 that, [...] "When a {{specialist}} acquires unerring skill {{there is a}} temptation to find tasks that are exceptionally difficult. The scenes of Death <b>Comes</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> End are laid out in Ancient Egypt. They are painted delicately. The household of the priest, who is depicted not as a sacred personage, but as a humdrum landowner, makes an instant appeal because its members are human. But while the author's skill can cause a stir {{over the death of}} an old woman some thousands of years ago, that length of time lessens curiosity concerning why or how she (and others) died." ...|$|E
2500|$|Maurice Richardson, {{a self-proclaimed}} admirer of Christie, {{wrote in the}} 8 April 1945 issue of The Observer, [...] "One of the best weeks of the war for crime fiction. First, of course, the new Agatha Christie; Death <b>Comes</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> End. And it really is startlingly new, with its ancient Egyptian setting in the country {{household}} of a mortuary priest who overstrains his already tense family by bringing home an ultra-tough live in concubine from Memphis. Result: [...] a series of murders. With her special archaeological equipment, Mrs Christie makes you feel just as much {{at home on the}} Nile in 1945 B.C. as if she were bombarding you with false clues in a chintz-covered drawing room in Leamington Spa. But she has not merely changed scenes; her reconstruction is vivid and she works really hard at her characters. My already insensate admiration for her leaps even higher." ...|$|E

2500|$|In The A.B.C. Murders, {{the murderer}} has killed four {{innocent}} people {{and attempted to}} frame an unstable man for the crimes. Hercule Poirot, however, prevents this easy way out, ensuring a trial and hanging. In And Then There Were None, the killer's own death is intrinsic to the plot; the red herring is when and how the killer actually died. However, stage, film, and television productions {{of some of these}} mysteries were traditionally sanitized with the culprits not evading some form of justice, for a variety of reasons– e.g., censors, plot clarity, and Christie's own changing tastes. (When Christie adapted Witness for the Prosecution into a stage play, she lengthened the ending so that the murderer was also killed; this format was followed in screen versions, including the Billy Wilder film from 1957.) In Death <b>Comes</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> End, set in ancient Egypt, the culprit is killed by one of the few surviving characters before he can claim another victim [...]|$|E
2500|$|... 2070: President Booth {{starts the}} Atomic Wars on June 12, 2070 to mass public support; this <b>comes</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> senior judges are {{discussing}} whether to confront him. Despite Booth's promises, America's nuclear screens fail {{to keep out}} many of the retaliatory strikes. Most of the planet is devastated in a nuclear holocaust, and the world's Mega-Cities are among the few to survive relatively unscathed due to experimental laser defences. All Judges and the military are deployed to maintain order in the decaying society, with the Judges forced to constantly fight against soldiers for committing criminal acts. It is discovered that Booth rigged the election and killed a witness to conceal the crime. Shocked and betrayed, the citizens of America rise up against the government and call for the Judges {{to take over the}} country. Fargo, secretly reawoken from suspended animation, advises Goodman to take over as ruler of the United States in a coup. Booth is sentenced to 100 years in suspended animation, but has enough loyal followers and robotic Mek-troops to fight a civil war against the Judges until 2071.|$|E

60|$|Longfellow in his voluminous works {{seems to}} me not only to be eminent in the style and forms of poetical {{expression}} that mark the present age, (an idiosyncrasy, almost a sickness, of verbal melody,) but to bring what is always dearest as poetry to the general human heart and taste, and probably must be so {{in the nature of}} things. He is certainly the sort of bard and counteractant most needed for our materialistic, self-assertive, money-worshipping, Anglo-Saxon races, and especially for the present age in America--an age tyrannically regulated with reference to the manufacturer, the merchant, the financier, the politician and the day workman--for whom and among whom he <b>comes</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> poet of melody, courtesy, deference--poet of the mellow twilight of the past in Italy, Germany, Spain, and in Northern Europe--poet of all sympathetic gentleness--and universal poet of women and young people. I should have to think long if I were ask'd to name the man who has done more, and in more valuable directions, for America.|$|E
