5|$|The {{second game}} {{was held at}} Oriole Park at <b>Camden</b> <b>Yards</b> in Baltimore on May 3, 1999, in front of 47,940 fans. By May 3, the Orioles had a 7–17 win-loss record in the 1999 MLB season. The Cuban {{national}} team, meanwhile, was stronger than during the first game, as the 1998–99 Cuban National Series had concluded and players who were not available for {{the first game of}} the exhibition joined the Cuban team. A 300-person delegation accompanied the Cuban team, including members of the Cuban media, students, and retired players. MLB requested the Federal Aviation Administration clear the airspace above <b>Camden</b> <b>Yards</b> for the game, in response to an attempt by a Miami-based pilot and veteran of the Bay of Pigs invasion, to drop anti-Castro leaflets over Estadio Latinoamericano during the first game.|$|E
5|$|MD295 {{continues}} northeast on Russell Street, {{where it}} is unsigned {{for the remainder of}} the route, through a mix of industrial and commercial areas, heading to the northwest of the Baltimore Greyhound Terminal at Haines Street and the Horseshoe Casino Baltimore. Farther north, the street passes over CSX's Baltimore Terminal Subdivision railroad line before it heads to the west of M Bank Stadium, where the Baltimore Ravens of the National Football League play. Past here, the road features an interchange with Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, which becomes I-395 south of Russell Street. After this interchange, MD295 runs west of Oriole Park at <b>Camden</b> <b>Yards,</b> home to Major League Baseball's Baltimore Orioles, as a four-lane divided street. Immediately after <b>Camden</b> <b>Yards,</b> MD295 splits into a one-way pair at the intersection with Washington Boulevard with northbound traffic following Eislen Street northeast briefly before heading north on Paca Street and southbound traffic following Greene Street. Along the one-way pair, the route intersects many major streets in downtown Baltimore, including Pratt Street, Lombard Street, Baltimore Street, Fayette Street, and Saratoga Street.|$|E
5|$|The {{crowd in}} the stands, the {{opposing}} players and all four umpires gave Ripken a standing ovation lasting more than 22 minutes, {{one of the longest}} standing ovations for any athlete; ESPN did not go to a commercial break during the entire ovation. During the ovation, Ripken did a lap around the entire <b>Camden</b> <b>Yards</b> warning track to shake hands and give high-fives to the fans.|$|E
5|$|The Babe Ruth Birthplace Museum {{is located}} at 216 Emory Street, a Baltimore row house where Ruth was born, and three blocks west of Oriole Park at <b>Camden</b> <b>Yards,</b> where the AL's Baltimore Orioles play. The {{property}} was restored and {{opened to the public}} in 1973 by the non-profit Babe Ruth Birthplace Foundation, Inc. Ruth's widow, Claire, his two daughters, Dorothy and Julia, and his sister, Mamie, helped select and install exhibits for the museum.|$|E
5|$|The Modells' {{collaboration}} with U2 {{for the film}} was facilitated by their involvement with the band in researching LED display technology in 1997 for use at Ravens Stadium at <b>Camden</b> <b>Yards.</b> At the time, the only giant LED display in existence was being used by U2 on their PopMart Tour. To learn about the technology, David Modell toured with U2 on-and-off {{for a period of}} six months. During that time, he befriended Catherine Owens, who served as the group's art director since their 1992 Zoo TV Tour.|$|E
5|$|On June 30, 2014, Ramirez {{made his}} Orioles {{debut in the}} ninth inning against the Texas Rangers, {{relieving}} Ubaldo Jiménez after pitching 8 innings only allowing 1 run pass. This was not a save opportunity since the Orioles were winning 7-1 in Baltimore. He allowed one walk and had two strikeouts. He helped Jimenez get his first win at <b>Camden</b> <b>Yards</b> of the 2014 Major League Baseball season. Ramírez had never met the Orioles manager Buck Showalter before his debut with the Orioles which has never happened to Buck in his Career. He was designated for assignment on July 6, 2014.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} memorable City-Poly games {{occurred}} on Thanksgiving Day 1965, at Baltimore's Memorial Stadium, with some 25,000fans in attendance. City beat Poly 52–6, and completed a 10–0 season with the team finishing the season ranked eighth in the nation by a national sports poll. City's 52–6 victory over Poly in that game is the largest margin of victory {{in the history of the}} series. Former Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke was the quarterback and Maryland Delegate Curt Anderson was the captain. The game is no longer played on Thanksgiving or at Memorial Stadium, but is now located at the home of the Baltimore Ravens, M Bank Stadium, at <b>Camden</b> <b>Yards</b> in downtown Baltimore. City College won the 127th meeting in 2015 by routing Poly by a final score of 42–6, the school's fourth consecutive victory in the series. Poly now leads the series 62–59–6.|$|E
5|$|Davis's 50th {{home run}} of the season, which he hit on September 13, tied him with Brady Anderson for the Orioles record of most home runs in a single season. He also became only the third player in MLB history, after Babe Ruth (New York Yankees, 1921) and Albert Belle (Cleveland Indians, 1995), to hit 50 home runs and 40 doubles in a single season. He hit his 51st home run on September 17, setting a new Orioles single season record. This was also his 92nd extra-base hit of the season, again tying Anderson for a {{franchise}} record. He later surpassed that by hitting his first triple of the season against Alex Cobb on September 21 in a 51 loss to Tampa Bay. Davis broke another Orioles record on September 27 with his 28th home {{run of the}} season hit at his home park of <b>Camden</b> <b>Yards,</b> surpassing Frank Robinson's record of 27 home runs hit at Memorial Stadium in 1966.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Munch and Kellerman {{investigate}} a murder at Oriole Park at <b>Camden</b> <b>Yards</b> during a late-season baseball game, leaving 48,000 possible suspects. The Long Island man, presumably a Yankees fan, is found {{beaten to death}} on the stairs of the stadium, and the governor of Maryland pressures the police department to solve the murder before the game ends so that millions in tourism dollars and ticket revenues will not be jeopardized. After several fruitless interviews, Munch and Kellerman question Scott Russell (Brian Tarantina), a New Yorker who attended the game with the victim. Russell admits he killed the victim because he said the Baltimore Orioles were a better team than the Yankees. He agrees to confess to the murder if they let him watch {{the rest of the}} game. Back at the police department, Falsone continues questioning detectives about the Luther Mahoney shooting. Stivers expresses concern to Lewis that their covering for Kellerman's role in the shooting could bring both of them down if Falsone continues his questioning.|$|E
25|$|During {{the next}} two decades, {{due in part to}} the success of the Convention Center and the other attractions, Oriole Park at <b>Camden</b> <b>Yards,</b> Sports Legends Museum at <b>Camden</b> <b>Yards,</b> M Bank Stadium, Power Plant Live!, and the Reginald F. Lewis Museum of Maryland African-American History, have joined the area, {{creating}} a ten-block plus entertainment and cultural destination at Baltimore's Inner Harbor, further increasing tourist dollars flowing into the region.|$|E
25|$|When CSX {{established}} the B Railroad Museum {{as a separate}} entity from the corporation, some of the former B Mount Clare Shops in Baltimore, including the Mt. Clare roundhouse, were donated to the museum {{while the rest of}} the property was sold. The B Warehouse at the <b>Camden</b> <b>Yards</b> rail junction in Baltimore now dominates the view over the right-field wall at the Baltimore Orioles' current home, Oriole Park at <b>Camden</b> <b>Yards.</b>|$|E
25|$|Schaefer's legacy {{includes}} {{the construction of}} Oriole Park at <b>Camden</b> <b>Yards,</b> stricter measures taken against preventing and solving the Chesapeake Bay pollution problem, and higher standards for public schools.|$|E
25|$|Designed by Populous with Bruce Miller as {{principal}} lead, Target Field {{is a modern}} take on other Populous-designed stadiums such as Oriole Park at <b>Camden</b> <b>Yards</b> in Baltimore, PNC Park in Pittsburgh, and AT Park in San Francisco.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} B station {{building is}} no longer used for train passengers. In May, 2005, a new sports museum, the Sports Legends Museum at <b>Camden</b> <b>Yards,</b> opened in the original Camden Station structure. The following year, Geppi's Entertainment Museum opened above the Sports Legends museum.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the light}} rail's route is on a {{dedicated}} right-of-way, with occasional grade crossings equipped with crossing gates. However, on the downtown portion of the route that runs along Howard Street (between the University of Baltimore/Mt. Royal and <b>Camden</b> <b>Yards</b> stations), trains mix with automobile traffic and their movement is controlled by traffic signals. In 2007, a transit signal priority system was implemented on {{this portion of the}} route, resulting in time savings of 25%. From south of Falls Road to North Avenue, the light rail runs parallel to the Jones Falls Expressway, and from <b>Camden</b> <b>Yards</b> to north of Westport, it parallels Interstate 395. North of Falls Road and south of Westport, it follows its own path towards its respective termini.|$|E
25|$|At Dodger Stadium, AYCE ticket-holders {{enter and}} exit through a {{different}} gate than other ticket-holders and can access only the AYCE buffet {{and a set}} of restrooms. At other ballparks, ticket-holders wear colored wristbands to identify themselves as AYCE patrons. At <b>Camden</b> <b>Yards,</b> AYCE ticket-holders have their hand stamped.|$|E
25|$|On September 6 1998, the Hamburg Street station opened as an infill station {{between the}} {{existing}} Westport and <b>Camden</b> <b>Yards</b> stations. Adjacent to M Bank Stadium, it was initially only open during Ravens games {{and other major}} stadium events; however, on July 1 2005, it became a full-time stop.|$|E
25|$|These {{consumer-friendly}} policies {{helped to}} make Oriole Park at <b>Camden</b> <b>Yards</b> the fastest ballpark to welcome 50 million fans, just 17 years after it opened. During that time, Oriole Park trailed only Dodger Stadium and Yankee Stadium in attendance. In 2008, the Orioles welcomed their 100 millionth fan in franchise history.|$|E
25|$|In 1997, the 50th {{anniversary of}} Robinson's {{groundbreaking}} major league debut, Lacy received an honorary doctorate from Loyola University Maryland, and was {{honored by the}} Smithsonian Institution with a lecture series. Lacy also threw out the ceremonial first pitch prior to a Baltimore Orioles home game at <b>Camden</b> <b>Yards</b> that season.|$|E
25|$|Tourism {{is popular}} in Maryland, with {{tourists}} visiting the city attractions of Baltimore, the beach attractions of the Eastern Shore, {{and the nature}} attractions of western Maryland, {{as well as many}} passing through en route to Washington, D.C. Baltimore attractions include the Harborplace and the Baltimore Aquarium, as well as the popular <b>Camden</b> <b>Yards</b> baseball stadium.|$|E
25|$|The Colts' move {{prompted}} {{city and}} state officials to redouble efforts to retain Baltimore's remaining major-league team, the Orioles. Oriole Park at <b>Camden</b> <b>Yards,</b> a facility designed specifically for baseball, was constructed near the proposed Baltodome site and opened in 1992. Its retro-classic design was well-received and inspired the designs of new MLB stadiums for the next twenty years.|$|E
25|$|Graham {{said that}} his planned {{retirement}} was because of his failing health. In August 2005, Graham appeared at the groundbreaking for his library in Charlotte, North Carolina. Then 86, he used a walker during the ceremony. On July 9, 2006, he spoke at the Metro Maryland Franklin Graham Festival, held in Baltimore, Maryland, at Oriole Park at <b>Camden</b> <b>Yards.</b>|$|E
25|$|The line {{opened in}} stages over a 14-month period. The initial segment from Timonium to <b>Camden</b> <b>Yards</b> opened for limited service for Orioles games on April 2, 1992, and for full service on May 17. A three-station {{extension}} to Patapsco opened on August 20, 1992, {{followed by a}} 4-station extension to Linthicum on April 2, 1993, and an additional 2-station extension to Cromwell/Glen Burnie on May 20, 1993.|$|E
25|$|Some ballparks {{limit the}} amount of food an AYCE patron can take on each trip to the buffet. At Dodger Stadium, AYCE patrons are limited to four hot dogs per visit, but can take as many soft drinks and bottles of water as they wish. At <b>Camden</b> <b>Yards,</b> patrons may take up to two of each food item on each visit. The lines move quickly, as no cash {{transactions}} are involved.|$|E
25|$|Most Light Rail {{stations}} {{are served by}} several MTA bus routes and passengers can make platform-to-platform transfers with the MARC Camden Line at <b>Camden</b> <b>Yards</b> and with the MARC Penn Line at Penn Station. There are no cross-platform connections with the Metro Subway. The Lexington Market subway and light rail {{stations are}} a block apart and connected only via surface streets. There are plans to cover the sidewalk between the two stations.|$|E
25|$|Schaefer as {{governor}} also {{pushed for the}} light rail line of electric trains that run 30 miles from Hunt Valley in Baltimore County, through Baltimore, past Oriole Park at <b>Camden</b> <b>Yards,</b> to Cromwell Station/Glen Burnie in Anne Arundel County, near BWI Airport. The first 22.5 miles of the light rail line was opened in April 1992 {{at a cost of}} near $400 million. Three extensions totaling 7.5 miles opened in late 1997 at a cost of $106 million.|$|E
25|$|Mussina {{collected}} {{an overall}} 7–8 record and 3.40 ERA, with 142 strikeouts in 22 career postseason games. His finest posteason occurred in 1997 for the Baltimore Orioles when in 4 games he went 2–0 with a 1.24 ERA in 29 IP with 11 H, 4 ER, 7 BB and 41 K. Notably, he twice outdueled Seattle Mariners ace Randy Johnson in head-to-head matchups during the ALDS. A feature on The Washington Posts website ranked his performance the 6th-most memorable moment at <b>Camden</b> <b>Yards.</b>|$|E
25|$|Left-handed {{reliever}} Raúl Valdés {{was promoted}} from AAA Memphis on June 23. Valdes became the third lefty in the struggling bullpen, joining struggling southpaws Trever Miller and Brian Talletin the bullpen. Disabled players David Freese (3b) and Nick Punto (Inf.), both out {{for over a}} month, were activated on June 27, providing relief for the injury-riddled team. Freese last played on May 1, and Punto on May 17. Both players made instant impacts in their first game returning when they helped beat the Baltimore Orioles at <b>Camden</b> <b>Yards</b> in their first interleague game there.|$|E
25|$|At MASN, Angelos {{negotiated}} {{dozens of}} carriage agreements throughout the territory and oversaw carriage-related public affairs, government relations and supporting litigation at FCC and Appellate Court proceedings including the ongoing carriage dispute with Time Warner Cable. In addition to managing the day-to-day business {{operations of the}} network, he oversaw MASN’s transition to HD along with other programming and production enhancements including on-site pre and post-game shows live from Nationals Park and Oriole Park at <b>Camden</b> <b>Yards.</b> In 2010, Angelos was named {{as one of the}} top ten decision-makers on in-market MLB streaming by Sports Business Journal.|$|E
25|$|Steven Wright {{pitched a}} four-hit, two-run {{complete}} game in <b>Camden</b> <b>Yards</b> and received seven runs of support, {{including the first}} career-home run by Marco Hernández, a three-run shot in the eighth. That was Wright's third complete game of the season. Mookie Betts exploded {{in the second game}} of the series, with three home runs and he drove in five runs. That was presumably the first three-home run-game by a Red Sox leadoff hitter {{in the history of the}} franchise. Eduardo Rodríguez returned from the disabled list, went six innings and gave up two runs on six hits.|$|E
25|$|Under Angelos' leadership, the Orioles {{adopted a}} wide range of {{consumer-friendly}} policies at Oriole Park at <b>Camden</b> <b>Yards.</b> The franchise's Fan Cost Index metric consistently ranks among the best values in Major League Baseball for tickets, food, beverages and parking for a family of four. The franchise allows fans to bring food and beverages into the park to save on costs. In 2009, the team created a “Birdland Stimulus Package” with discounts and affordable entertainment options for families and the team's refund and exchange policy is one of the league's most liberal, allowing fans a great deal of scheduling flexibility. The club also received strong reviews for relaxing its refund policy during a bizarre rainout in 1999.|$|E
25|$|On May 8, in a 10–3 {{win over}} the Baltimore Orioles at <b>Camden</b> <b>Yards,</b> Hamilton {{registered}} multiple career highs; he had five hits in five at-bats, hitting four two-run home runs and a double {{for a total of}} eight runs batted in. Incidentally, the only runner on base each time was Elvis Andrus. In doing this, he not only became just the 16th player in MLB history to hit four home runs in one game and the first to do so since Carlos Delgado in , but also now holds the American League Record for most total bases in a single game with eighteen. He was one base shy of tying the Major League Record.|$|E
25|$|On September 1, Baldelli {{was called}} up to the major league squad {{to serve as a}} {{designated}} hitter, pinch hitter, and reserve outfielder. On September 5, in his first at-bat since returning to the Rays' roster, Baldelli hit an 8th inning pinch hit 2-run home run against the Baltimore Orioles in <b>Camden</b> <b>Yards</b> and finished the game in right field. Baldelli played occasionally throughout September, was included on the Rays' postseason roster, and started at DH for {{the first game of the}} 2010 playoffs against the Texas Rangers. However, he suffered muscle cramping during the game due to his mitochondrial disorder and had to be removed from the Rays' playoff roster, again putting his future playing career in doubt.|$|E
25|$|Playing at <b>Camden</b> <b>Yards,</b> the Yankees {{lost the}} first two games of the season due to poor {{performances}} by starters CC Sabathia and Chien-Ming Wang, though they rebounded to take the third game of the series as well as win the next two series they played against the Kansas City Royals and defending AL East Champions Tampa Bay Rays. On April 16, the Yankees played the first game in their new Yankee Stadium, but they lost the game because of a shaky bullpen. They won the next game to split their first series at the ballpark. The Yankees were swept later in the month by the rival Boston Red Sox in three games at Fenway Park.|$|E
25|$|The 2007 season remains notable in {{the minds}} of {{baseball}} fans for two inexplicable oddities. On August 19 at the Metrodome, the Minnesota Twins logged 19 strikeouts against the Rangers, one short of the Major League record. Three days later, the 22nd, in the first game of a doubleheader at Oriole Park at <b>Camden</b> <b>Yards,</b> the Rangers' bats came alive with a modern record for runs by one team, defeating the Baltimore Orioles 30–3. Their 27-run margin of victory is also a modern-day MLB record. Wes Littleton gained probably the easiest save in Major League history– entering the game {{in the bottom of the}} seventh, with his team already ahead 14–3, he pitched three innings finishing the game, and gave up just two hits and a walk.|$|E
25|$|Travelling to <b>Camden</b> <b>Yards</b> for {{the first}} time in 2015, Mark Buehrle won his 200th career game as Toronto {{defeated}} Baltimore 12–5. Toronto scored four runs in the top of the first inning and another five runs in the fourth inning. José Bautista got his first three hits of the season and left in the bottom of the sixth inning as the result of minor cramping in his calves. Aaron Sanchez, another of Toronto's top prospects, made his first career MLB start against Ubaldo Jiménez the following night, but would last just 3 innings and yield 3 earned runs. The Blue Jays would lose the game 7–1. Toronto would win the rubber match 10–7, with Kevin Pillar, Dalton Pompey, and José Bautista each hitting their first home runs of the season.|$|E
