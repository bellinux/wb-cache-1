He tried to conceal his {{political}} views from his classmates and spent long hours studying law and reading Greek literature. In 1813 Hogg reconciled with the Shelleys after they visited him in London. They remained in contact after the couple left on a journey to Wales and Ireland. In April 1814, Hogg went to Ireland in an attempt to <b>cheer</b> <b>up</b> Percy Shelley, who had complained of poor spirits in a letter.

5|$|Elsewhere, Bart is {{not ready}} for the {{upcoming}} Springfield Elementary science fair. He ends up working with Martin Prince and after Bart {{comes up with a}} general idea—cool robotics—Martin does all the work and constructs an adorable robotic baby seal. However, it is revealed that when the wiring is tampered with, they become violent attackers. The seal wins first prize at the Fair, to Lisa's disdain. When she goes to the Springfield Retirement Castle to whine about the injustice to Grampa, the seniors citizen see the seal visibly <b>cheer</b> <b>up</b> Jasper and the value of the invention becomes clear. All of the senior citizens then get their own seals, and they become happier and healthier, which angers a consortium of local businesses (led by the local funeral home) who want the oldsters to go back to being miserable and more rapidly dying. The group figures out the wiring secret and reworks the seals so their fury returns, even causing the death of Mrs. Glick. Chief Wiggum has all the robots impounded. Bart and Martin enlist the aid of Professor Frink who then gets a larger group of nerds to remotely hack into the robot software and make them nice again. They succeed and as a result, Chief Wiggum releases all the seals, who return to the nursing home.|$|E

25|$|In July 2012, {{the group}} headlined their largest U.S. tour. The tour held {{the same name}} as their debut album. The #1 Girl Tour held opening acts from artists Jacob Latimore, Lil Twist, and Kayla Brianna. While on tour, the group visited the Ronald McDonald House in Georgia to <b>cheer</b> <b>up</b> {{some of the young}} {{patients}} who were battling cancer. In 2013, the group embarked on their All Around The World Tour. Since joining Mindless Behavior, Princeton, along with former bandmates Roc Royal, Ray Ray and Prodigy, have released two albums, performed on tour, and sold over 327,000 album copies in the United States. Later within the year, many news sources announced {{that there would be a}} new member after the groups lead singer, Craig Crippen Jr., who known as Prodigy, had left the group. After lead singer Prodigy left the group, Mindless Behavior did not release any material. As seen in many interviews, there had only been Princeton, Roc Royal, and Ray Ray, which meant that there hadn’t been a lead singer introduced. For almost two years, Mindless Behavior participated in interviews, and even held shows for their fans, without a lead singer. However, many of these shows included nothing but the band performing dance routines, while Prodigy’s voice played in the background. Elijah Johnson replaced him as the lead singer in April 2014.|$|E

The full skirts of the war crinoline endured in the robe de style of the 1920s.|$|E

In the trial after the 1999 impeachment of Bill Clinton, Kennedy voted to acquit Clinton on both charges, saying [...] "Republicans in the House of Representatives, in their partisan vendetta against the President, have wielded the impeachment power in precisely the way the framers rejected, recklessly and without regard for the Constitution or {{the will of the}} American people." ...|$|E

However, throughout the 1950s Thorpe was leading a secret homosexual life, {{at a time when}} all such activity was illegal in the United Kingdom, and subject to heavy penalties; exposure would have ended his political prospects instantly. [...] This sexual preference, concealed from the wider public, was known and tolerated in North Devon, [...] and was at least suspected by many in the Liberal Party.|$|E

[...] The group would go to children's hospitals to <b>cheer</b> <b>up</b> sick children. [...] On November 27, 1983, the group attended their first Washington Redskins football game in full drag, but with the addition of pig snout masks, in reference to The Hogs, the nickname of the Redskins offensive line players.|$|E
