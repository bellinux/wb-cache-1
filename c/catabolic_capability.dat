These techniques were also used to determine catabolic diversity in sugarcane soil under long-term preharvest burning or under green cane harvesting with retention of a trash mulch (with or without annual fertilizer additions). Principal component analysis (PCA) of Biolog data revealed large differences in <b>catabolic</b> <b>capability</b> of soil microbial communities between burnt sugarcane, annually tilled (annual ryegrass and maize) and non-tilled grass (kikuyu pasture and native grassland) land uses. For SIR data, differences in <b>catabolic</b> <b>capability</b> existed between all land uses. PCA of Biolog data showed large differences in <b>catabolic</b> <b>capability</b> between sugarcane soil under trashing and preharvest burning {{but there was little}} effect of fertilizer applications. However, for SIR data, differences due to both trashing versus burning and fertilizer versus no fertilizer were evident. For Biolog data values for Shannon 2 ̆ 7 s diversity index followed the order: kikuyu pasture = native Grassland = ryearass pasture > maize = burnt sugarcane and trashed sugarcane had higher values than burnt sugarcane. For SIR data, substrate richness was similar between treatments and catabolic evenness followed the order: native Grassland > kikuyu pasture > ryegrass pasture > maize = burnt sugarcane and was greater for trashed than burnt sugarcane. It was concluded that the SIR method was more effective at separating treatments with broadly similar land uses and managements than the Biolog method. In general, land uses and managements that increased soil organic matter tended to increase catabolic diversity. (c) 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

For this reason, the effects of irrigation with dairy factory effluent (DFE) on soil chemical properties and its consequent effects on microbial properties of grazed pastoral soils were investigated in soils surrounding a dairy factory. Long-term DFE irrigation resulted {{in an increase in}} pH, electrical conductivity, exchangeable Na, K, exchangeable Na percentage and extractable P reflecting the use of phosphoric acid, NaOH and KOH as cleaning agents in the factory. Effluent P accumulated principally in the inorganic soil fraction and a P fractionation procedure revealed large increases in the NaHCO 3 -, NaOH(I) - and HCl-Pi fractions. Exchangeable Mg and aggregate stability, as measured by wet sieving, were both decreased by long-term DFE additions. Long-term DFE irrigation had no measureable effect on soil organic matter content (organic C, total N) but caused a decrease in the C/N ratio and substantial increases in microbial biomass C and N and basal respiration which were attributed to regular inputs of soluble organic C (e. g. lactose) present, as milk residues, in the effluent. There was no measureable increase in metabolic quotient caused by long-term DFE irrigation suggesting that it had not caused undue stress on the microbial community. Principal component analysis of soil properties from 11 fields surrounding the factory confirmed that DFE irrigation induced increases in pH, exchangeable Na and K, extractable P, EC, soluble N, microbial biomass C and N, and a narrowing of the C/N ratio. Effluent irrigation had no measureable effect on either <b>catabolic</b> <b>capability</b> of the soil microbial community, as measured using MicoResp™ or the structure and diversity of the bacterial community as measured by PCR-DGGE of 16 S rDNA amplicons. It is suggested that this was because locality, soil type and plant cover were similar for all samples and these are the major factors influencing microbial community structure. It was concluded that although DFE irrigation caused substantial changes in soil chemical properties and increases the size and activity of the microbial biomass, community structure and <b>catabolic</b> <b>capability</b> were resilient to change...|$|E

Initially, induction of catabolic ability within the compost was assessed after increasing compost-phenanthrene contact times. This was achieved by monitoring the evolution of (CO 2) -C- 14 from the mineralization of freshly added C- 14 - 9 -phenanthrene to aqueous compost slurries in respirometers. A subsequent experiment to assess {{the potential of the}} compost to bioremediate aged phenanthrene (300 d) from soil was then conducted in aerated microcosms.

Two experimental rotation systems were tested (i) Wheat-Beet-Faba Bean-Rape-Wheat (Leg+) and (ii) Wheat-Flax-Wheat-Beet-Wheat (Leg−). Soil samples were collected on tilled plots at 0 – 10 cm depth on July 2013 under wheat. Soil microbial biomass and soil enzymatic activities (β-glucosidase, cellulase, urease and arylamidase activities) were assessed. Soil microbial diversity was evaluated with two complementary approaches: Phospholipid fatty acid profiling (PLFA) and the metabolic capabilities of the microbial community (Biolog Ecoplates). Soil organic carbon and total nitrogen were significantly and respectively 1. 5 and 1. 3 times higher in faba bean's rotation compared to free faba bean rotation. Soil microbial biomass did not differ significantly between the two rotations. In general, Leg+ rotation resulted in the greatest carbon mineralization and β-glucosidase and arylamidase activities. The analysis of Biolog data and PLFA profiling indicated that the rotation including faba bean has modified microbial populations and induced differences in the <b>catabolic</b> <b>capability</b> of soil microbial communities. Our results suggested that changing rotation crop by introducing faba bean two years before wheat modifies the surrounding habitat of microbial communities by providing available carbon and nitrogen as well as suitable soil pH.

Abietane-degrading Sphingomonas spp provide additional evidence that the phylogeny of this genus is independent of the <b>catabolic</b> <b>capabilities</b> of its members.

40|$|A {{comparative}} study of organic and conventional commercial olive farming systems was conducted in a wide-area of Andalusia, southern Spain {{to determine the effect}} of management practices on chemical and biological soil properties. Soils from 41 accredited organic farms, 49 conventionally managed neighboring farms, and three sites containing wild or feral forms of olive were analyzed. A polyphasic approach was used combining traditional soil physicochemical analysis, culture-dependent microbiological analyses, sole-carbon-source utilization profiles using the Biolog EcoPlate assay and enzymatic activities using the API ZYM assay. Different multivariate statistical analyses clearly demonstrated that olive orchard soils could be differentiated by farm management system. Discriminant analysis differentiated among three well defined soil groups that correlated with the farm management system (conventional, organic or wild olives). Thus, enzymatic activities and sole-carbon-source utilization profiles correctly classified 75, 77 and 100 % of soil samples from orchards under organic and conventional management or wild olives, respectively. Overall, all diversity and functional indexes estimated from the Biolog EcoPlate and API ZYM assays were positively and significantly correlated with SOM, organic C and N content and the C:N ratio, and negatively and significantly correlated with clay content. In general olive orchards under organic management showed significantly higher SOM, organic C and N content, and C:N ratio, as well as higher microbial diversity as measured by <b>catabolic</b> <b>capability</b> and functional indexes of the Biolog EcoPlate and API ZYM assays as compared to conventionally managed orchards.

40|$|The green-peach aphid Myzus persicae (Hemiptera: Aphididae) is a pest of {{crop plants}} worldwide. Aphids are phloem-feeding insects, and they inflict damage through direct effects of feeding, and {{indirectly}} by transmission of plant viruses. Development of insecticide resistance in aphids has motivated {{the development of}} novel control strategies. New approaches to pest control may be informed by an enhanced understanding of the genes allowing aphids to subsist on the nutritionally unbalanced diet of phloem sap, and to detoxify chemical defenses presented by {{a wide range of}} hosts. Certain lineages of M. persicae have expanded their host range to include tobacco in agricultural settings, and an objective of this research is to characterize differences between adapted and non-adapted lineages in their ability to accept tobacco as a suitable host in the laboratory, and to tolerate tobacco-specific defenses. Tobacco-adapted aphids are highly resistant to nicotine, a potent neurotoxic plant defense, and may be stimulated to feed on nicotine-containing diets by associating nicotine as a characteristic of a suitable host plant. A platform for functional genomics studies of M. persicae has been established by sequencing expressed genes from a diversity of aphid tissues. Bioinformatic analysis of these sequences allowed for the development of an annotated microarray containing fragments of over 10, 000 aphid genes, which has been used to study gene expression changes in the heads of tobacco-adapted aphids in response to nicotine. Several induced genes are associated with aphid salivation and detoxification of plant defenses. The availability of the whole genome sequence for the closely related pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, has facilitated the annotation of M. persicae genes, and allowed for comparison of gene content in the two species.

40|$|Although {{the effects}} of land use on soil organic matter are well known, the effects on the size, {{activity}} and diversity of the soil microbial community are less well documented. In this study {{the effects of}} agricultural land use (maize (Zea mays), annual ryegrass (Lolium multiforum), permanent kikuyu grass pasture (Pennisetum clandestinum), gum (Eucalyptus grandis) and pine (Pinus patula) forest) on microbial biomass C, microbial and exocellular enzyme activity and heterotrophic functional diversity (by analysis of catabolic response profiles to 36 substrates) was investigated on a site where the long-term history of land management was known. In comparison with native grassland, permanent kikuyu pasture resulted in an increase in organic C, microbial biomass, arginine ammonification rate, flourescein diacetate hydrolysis rate and arylsulphatase activity. By contrast, under maize under both conventional tillage (CT) and zero tillage (ZT) and annual ryegrass there was a reduction in organic matter and microbial biomass content and in measurements of microbial and enzyme activity. However, in these three arable soils, basal respiration, arginine ammonification and fluorescein diacetate (FDA) hydrolysis rates, when expressed per unit of microbial biomass, were higher than under the other land uses, suggesting the presence of a small but highly metabolically active microfloral community. Soils below pine forest tended to have a higher organic C content than those below gum forest, yet microbial biomass C, basal respiration, arginine ammonification rate and arylsulphatase activity were lower under pine forest. This was attributed to the inhibitory effects if phenolic compounds in pine needles. Principal components analysis of catabolic response profiles demonstrated that there were large differences in the <b>catabolic</b> <b>capability</b> of the soil microbial communities inhabiting the various land use types. Values for Shannon 2 ̆ 7 s and Simpson 2 ̆ 7 s diversity indices followed the order: pine < gum < kikuyu pasture = annual ryegrass = maize (ZT) = maize (CT) < native grassland indicating that greatest catabolic diversity existed under native grassland and least diversity existed under exotic forest.

Previous attempts to transfer sucrose <b>catabolic</b> <b>capabilities</b> into non-sucrose-utilizing strains have met with limited success due to low growth rates on sucrose and phenotypic instability of the engineered strains. To address these problems, we developed a transferrable sucrose utilization cassette which confers efficient sucrose catabolism when integrated onto the E. coli chromosome. The cassette was based on the csc genes from E. coli W, a strain which grows very quickly on sucrose. Both plasmid-borne expression and chromosomal integration of a repressor-less sucrose utilizing cassette were investigated in E. coli strains K- 12, B and C. In contrast to previous studies, strains harboring chromosomal cassettes could grow {{at the same rate as}} they do on glucose. Interestingly, we also discovered that spontaneous chromosomal integration of the csc genes was required to allow efficient growth from plasmid-transformed strains. The ability to engineer industrial strains for efficient sucrose utilization will allow substitution of sucrose for glucose in industrial fermentations. This will encourage the use of sucrose as a carbon source and assist in transition of our petrochemical-based economy to a bio-based economy. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Soil ecology status contributes to agricultural system sustainability, and evaluations were made to determine the effect of different management practices on soil microbial biomass (SMB) (substrate-induced respiration (SIR) and chloroform fumigation incubation (CFI)) and micro-flora physiological and catabolic diversity (BIOLOGTM ecoplate well system). SMB-C (CFI, SIR) was significantly and respectively 1. 2 and 1. 3 times higher for residue retention (average 387 mg C kg 1 dry soil and 515 mg C kg 1 dry soil, respectively) compared to residue removal. SMB-C (CFI) was significantly higher for wheat (369 mg C kg 1 dry soil) compared to maize (319 mg C kg 1 dry soil). SMB-N (CFI) was significantly 1. 3 times higher for residue retention (average 28 mg N kg 1 dry soil) compared to residue removal. The average well color development (AWCD) obtained by the BIOLOGTM ecoplate essay indicated there were large differences in the <b>catabolic</b> <b>capability</b> of soil microbial communities after 15 years of contrasting management practices. While maize and wheat rotation under conventional tillage with residue retention showed a significantly higher overall AWCD value compared to the other treatments, AWCD ofmaize with zero tillage and residue removal was significantly lower than in the other treatments. AWCD was significantly higher for residue retention compared to residue removal and for wheat as compared to maize. For maize, the management practices were divided into two groups; zero tillage with residue removal was separate from all other treatments. For wheat, conventional tillage was separate from all zero tillage treatments. This study suggests that in the target area, a cropping system that includes zero tillage, crop rotation, and crop residue retention can increase overall biomass and micro-flora activity and diversity compared with common farming practices. In the long term, zero tillage combined with residue retention creates conditions favourable for the development of antagonists and predators, and fosters a new ecological stability.

Pyrosequencing-based analyses of 16 S rRNA genes revealed no significant effects of N fertilization on bacterial diversity, but significant effects on community composition at both sites; copiotrophic taxa (including members of the Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes phyla) typically increased in relative abundance in the high N plots, with oligotrophic taxa (mainly Acidobacteria) exhibiting the opposite pattern. Consistent with the phylogenetic shifts under N fertilization, shotgun metagenomic sequencing revealed increases in the relative abundances of genes associated with DNA/RNA replication, electron transport and protein metabolism, increases that could be resolved even with the shallow shotgun metagenomic sequencing conducted here (average of 75 [*] 000 reads per sample).

Acinetobacter ADP 1 displays many features of other aerobic soil bacteria with metabolism oriented toward the degradation of organic compounds found in their natural habitat. A distinguishing feature of this genome is the absence of a gene corresponding to pyruvate kinase, the enzyme that generally catalyzes the terminal step in conversion of carbohydrates to pyruvate for respiration by the citric acid cycle. This finding supports the view that the cycle itself is centrally geared to the <b>catabolic</b> <b>capabilities</b> of this exceptionally versatile organism...|$|R
40|$|In soil, aquatic {{and marine}} environments, {{bacterial}} degradation of organic pollutants {{has been well}} studied. However, via deposition or volatile absorption, these pollutants can also accumulate on plant leaves, where they become accessible for degradation by bacteria that colonise the leaf surface, or phyllosphere. The phyllosphere is an environment that evokes high levels of bacterial stress due to rapid changes in humidity, temperature and solar radiation. In this project, we investigated how bacteria cope with phyllosphere stress {{in relation to their}} catabolic activity towards pollutants. For this, we used two different approaches. Firstly, we tested the phyllosphere performance of several model strains with different <b>catabolic</b> <b>capabilities.</b> Of these, only 4 -chlorophenol degrading strain Arthrobacter chlorophenolicus A 6 exhibited a phyllosphere fitness that was comparable to our control bacterium, leaf coloniser Erwinia herbicola 299 R. Secondly, we isolated pollutant-degrading bacteria from two phyllosphere environments: an apple orchard that was treated with the foliar pesticide triadimenol, and a vegetated shoulder along a major Dutch highway. Enrichment cultures were checked for growth on 4 -chlorophenol, a degradation product of triadimenol, and toluene, a common traffic-related pollutant. Several 4 -chlorophenol degrading strains were recovered from the apple orchard phyllosphere and were all confirmed to belong to the genus Arthrobacter. Toluene degrading phyllosphere bacteria from near the highway were identified as Rhodococcus sp. Phyllosphere fitness and stress resistance were variable between isolates. One of the Arthrobacter strains was an excellent leaf coloniser, superior to A 6 and 299 R. Ongoing studies are exploiting the available genomic resources for A. chlorophenolicus A 6 to obtain a transcriptional profile of this strain under phyllosphere conditions and expose any hardwiring between genes involved in stress resistance and pollutant degradation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{bioremediation}} of soils {{impacted by}} diesel fuels is very often {{limited by the}} lack of indigenous microflora with the required broad substrate specificity. In such cases, the soil inoculation with cultures with the desired <b>catabolic</b> <b>capabilities</b> (bioaugmentation) is an essential option. The use of consortia of microorganisms obtained from rich sources of microbes (e. g., sludges, composts, manure) via enrichment (i. e., serial growth transfers) on the polluting hydrocarbons would provide bioremediation enhancements more robust and reproducible than those achieved with specialized pure cultures or tailored combinations (co-cultures) of them, together with none or minor risks of soil loading with unrelated or pathogenic allocthonous microorganisms. Results In this work, two microbial consortia, i. e., ENZ-G 1 and ENZ-G 2, were enriched from ENZYVEBA (a complex commercial source of microorganisms) on Diesel (G 1) and HiQ Diesel (G 2), respectively, and characterized in terms of microbial composition and hydrocarbon biodegradation capability and specificity. ENZ-G 1 and ENZ-G 2 exhibited a comparable and remarkable biodegradation capability and specificity towards n-C 10 to n-C 24 linear paraffins by removing about 90 % of 1 g l - 1 of diesel fuel applied after 10 days of aerobic shaken flask batch culture incubation at 30 °C. Cultivation dependent and independent approaches evidenced that both consortia consist of bacteria belonging to the genera Chryseobacterium, Acinetobacter, Psudomonas, Stenotrophomonas, Alcaligenes and Gordonia along with the fungus Trametes gibbosa. However, only the fungus was found to grow and remarkably biodegrade G 1 and G 2 hydrocarbons under the same conditions. The biodegradation activity and specificity and the microbial composition of ENZ-G 1 and ENZ-G 2 did not significantly change after cryopreservation and storage at - 20 °C for several months. Conclusions ENZ-G 1 and ENZ-G 2 are very similar highly enriched consortia of bacteria and a fungus capable of extensively degrading a broad range of the hydrocarbons mainly composing diesel fuels. Given their remarkable biodegradation potential, stability and resistance to cryopreservation, both consortia appear very interesting candidates for bioaugmentation operations on Diesel fuel impacted soils and sites. </p...|$|R
40|$|Metabolism {{of living}} cells {{converts}} substrates into metabolic energy, redox potential and metabolic end {{products that are}} essential to maintain cellular function. The flux distribution among the various biochemical pathways {{is determined by the}} kinetic properties of enzymes which are subject to strict regulatory control. Simulation of metabolic behavior therefore requires the complete knowledge of biochemical pathways, enzyme kinetics as well as their regulation. Unfortunately, complete kinetic and regulatory information is not available for microbial cells, thus preventing accurate dynamic simulation of their metabolic behavior. However, it is possible to define wider limits on metabolic behavior based solely on flux balances of biochemical pathways. We present here comprehensive information about the catabolic pathways of the bacterium Escherichia coli. Using this biochemical database, we formulate a stoichiometric model of the bacterial network of fueling reactions. After logical structural reduction, the network consists of 53 metabolic fluxes and 30 metabolites. The solution space of this under-determined system of equations presents the bounds of metabolic flux distribution that the bacterial cell can achieve. We use specific objective functions and linear optimization to investigate the capability of E. coli catabolism to maximally produce the 12 biosynthetic precursors and three key cofactors within this solution space. For the three cofactors, the maximum yields are calculated to be 18 [middle dot] 67 ATP, 11 [middle dot] 6 NADH and 11 NADPH per glucose molecule, respectively. The yields of NADH and NADPH are less than 12 owing to the energy costs of importing glucose. These constraints are made explicit by the interpretation of shadow prices. The optimal yields of the 12 biosynthetic precursors are computed. Four of the 12 precursors (3 -phosphoglycerate, phosphoenolpyruvate, pyruvate and oxaloacetate) can be made by E. coli with complete carbon conversion. Conversely, none of the sugar monophosphates can be made with 100 % carbon conversion and analysis of the shadow prices reveals that this conversion is constrained by the energy cost of importing glucose. Three of the 12 precursors (acetyl-coA, [alpha]-ketoglutarate, and succinyl-coA) cannot be made with full carbon conversion owing to stoichiometric constraints; there is no route to these compounds without carrying out a decarboxylation reaction. Metabolite flux balances and linear optimization have thus been used to determine the <b>catabolic</b> <b>capabilities</b> of E. coli...|$|R

40|$|The {{complete}} {{sequence of}} the 7. 07 Mb genome of the biological control agent Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf- 5 is now available, providing a new opportunity to advance knowledge of biological control through genomics. P. fluorescens Pf- 5 is a rhizosphere bacterium that suppresses seedling emergence diseases and produces a spectrum of antibiotics toxic to plant-pathogenic fungi and oomycetes. In addition to six known secondary metabolites produced by Pf- 5, three novel secondary metabolite biosynthesis gene clusters identified in the genome could also contribute to biological control. The genomic sequence provides numerous clues as to mechanisms used by the bacterium {{to survive in the}} spermosphere and rhizosphere. These features include broad <b>catabolic</b> and transport <b>capabilities</b> for utilizing seed and root exudates, an expanded collection of efflux systems for defense against environmental stress and microbial competition, and the presence of 45 outer membrane receptors that should allow for the uptake of iron from a wide array of siderophores produced by soil microorganisms. As expected for a bacterium with a large genome that lives in a rapidly changing environment, Pf- 5 has an extensive collection of regulatory genes, only some of which have been characterized for their roles in regulation of secondary metabolite production or biological control. Consistent with its commensal lifestyle, Pf- 5 appears to lack a number of virulence and pathogenicity factors found in plant pathogen...|$|R
40|$|Soilborne plant {{pathogens}} {{are among}} the most important limiting factors for the productivity of agro-ecosystems. Identifying reliable and effective control methods is crucial for efficient biological control. Soil fungistasis is the capability of soils to inhibit the germination and growth of soil-borne fungi in presence of optimal abiotic conditions. The first aim of this PhD thesis was to clarify the relationships between soil amendments with plant residues spanning a wide range of biochemical quality with soil fungistasis. Microcosms experiments were performed with 42 different plant residues and the effect on soil fungistasis was assessed by using four different fungi (Aspergillus niger, Botrytis cinerea, Pyrenochaeta lycoperici and Trichoderma harzianum). We measured soil respiration and soil enzymatic activity and compared classic litter proximate chemical analysis with 13 C-CPMAS NMR spectroscopy to define plant residues biochemistry. Results showed that the quality of organic amendments is a major controlling factor of soil fungistasis. The dramatic relief of soil fungistasis when soil was amended with lignin poor, but labile carbon rich, substrates gives strong support to the competition-based hypothesis. The positive correlation between soil respiration and fungal growth further supports the competition hypothesis. Finally, 13 C-CPMAS NMR results showed clear-cut relationships between soil fungistasis and the biochemical quality of plant residues, and provided a quantitative assessment of the time required for fungistasis restoration after organic materials application. The second aim of this work was to assess the effects of different soil amendment histories, in terms of amendment types and amounts, on fungistasis. The few studies concerning the history of soil amendment pointed out its effect on basic soil functions such as respiration, enzymatic activities, carbon and nitrogen mineralization. Previous studies demonstrated that soils with a long-term (i. e. months to years) application history of organic amendments, compared with unamended soils, have a higher and more active microbial biomass and enhanced enzymatic activities. It is not know however, {{because of the lack of}} experimental evidences, whether and how a story of organic amendments affects fungistasis. The aforementioned considerations about basic soil processes and soil amendment history drove the hypothesis to us that training a soil with organic carbon, by stimulating the activity of the resident microbial community can positively affect soil fungistasis. With this background, aim of this study was to assess the effects of different soil amendment histories on fungistasis in terms of amendment types and amounts. For this purpose microcosm experiments were performed by training a soil with different amounts and types of organic sources covering a wide range of biochemical qualities (glucose, alfalfa and wheat straw). Thereafter, the fungistasis response was assessed by using four different fungi (Aspergillus niger, Botrytis cinerea, Pyrenochaeta lycoperici and Trichoderma harzianum). Trained soils were characterized for microbial activity (respiration) and functional diversity by the BIOLOG EcoPlates™ method. Results showed that, irrespectively of fungal species and amendment types, frequent supplies of organic C reduce fungistasis relief (i. e. increase fungistasis resistance to organic matter pulse) as well as the time required for fungistasis restoration (i. e. increase fungistasis resilience). Moreover, the frequent addition of organic carbon as a result of the continuous supply of easily decomposable organic compounds enhance soil respiration and its specific <b>catabolic</b> <b>capabilities.</b> In conclusion, organic amendment applications create a soil functionally distinct from its not amended counterpart, with greatly enhanced fungistasis resistance and resilience. Finally, the third aim of this work was to provide the first monitor of soil fungistasis in the Campania Region. Soil quality, especially in the presence of reduced organic inputs, degrades in a few years with the following negative effects: the increased incidence of soil-borne pathogens, the traditional chemical methods loses its effectiveness for the development of strains resistant to fungicides, the efficiency of the fertilizer use is lowered, and the soil food webs become simplified. In order to mitigate these effects is necessary to test innovative farming techniques. In both biological and conventional agriculture, to the recovery of the quality of the soils, it has been proposed to use organic amendments. In this context, the aim of this work was to assess the level of fungistasis in different soils sampled in the Campania Region, from both agro-ecosystems and natural ecosystems. In general, we wanted to assess the combined effect of soil type and a different management on fungistasis. To this end, the analysis included a wide spectrum of types of soils to better understand the relationships between physico - chemical-microbiological characteristics of soils and their fungistatic activity. Since the quality of the soil depends on multiple factors, and the same fungistasis is dependent on several processes and properties of the soil system, in order to evaluate the power fungistatic of soils sampled and to differentiate them according to their ability to induce or less fungistasis and thus inhibit or slow the development of soil-borne fungi, it is necessary to measure a variety of parameters, chemical, physical, biological and microbiological processes. In this multidisciplinary study were compared 12 different soils from different ecosystems and collected in different geographical areas of the Campania Region. Each soil has been subjected to chemical, physical, microbiological, enzymatic analysis, fungistasis assessment with three fungi (Aspergillus niger, Botrytis cinerea and Trichoderma harzianum). The hypothesis to be tested was that soils with higher organic matter content and higher microbial activity showed higher levels of fungistasis. Contrary to the initial hypothesis there was no evidence correlation between microbial biomass and fungistasis, but for the metabolic profile of the telluric microorganisms. The monitoring showed that there are significant differences in the fungistatic power of the different soils, it allows us to classify soils on the basis of their ability to inhibit or slow the development of soil-borne fungi...|$|R

Bioinformatic {{analysis of the}} draft genome sequence of strain NCPPB 3335, which encodes 5232 predicted coding genes on a total length of 5856 998 bp and a 57. 12 % G + C, revealed a large degree of conservation with Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola 1448 A and P. syringae pv. tabaci 11528. However, NCPPB 3335 contains twelve variable genomic regions, which are absent in all previously sequenced P. syringae strains. Various features that could contribute {{to the ability of}} this strain to survive in a woody host were identified, including broad <b>catabolic</b> and transport <b>capabilities</b> for degrading plant-derived aromatic compounds, the duplication of sequences related to the biosynthesis of the phytohormone indoleacetic acid (iaaM, iaaH) and its amino acid conjugate indoleacetic acid-lysine (iaaL gene), and the repertoire of strain-specific putative type III secretion system effectors. Access to this seventh genome sequence belonging to the 'P. syringae complex' allowed us to identify 73 predicted coding genes that are NCPPB 3335 -specific. Results shown here provide the basis for detailed functional analysis of a tumour-inducing pathogen of woody hosts and for the study of specific adaptations of a P. savastanoi pathovar. © 2010 Society for Applied Microbiology and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.
