40|$|The {{ability to}} amplify or reduce subtle image {{changes over time}} is useful in {{contexts}} such as video editing, medical video analysis, product quality control and sports. In these contexts there is often large motion present which severely distorts <b>current</b> video <b>amplification</b> methods that magnify change linearly. In this work we propose a method to cope with large motions while still magnifying small changes. We make the following two observations: i) large motions are linear on the temporal scale of the small changes; ii) small changes deviate from this linearity. We ignore linear motion and propose to magnify acceleration. Our method is pure Eulerian and does not require any optical flow, temporal alignment or region annotations. We link temporal second-order derivative filtering to spatial acceleration magnification. We apply our method to moving objects where we show motion magnification and color magnification.

In {{the present study}} we investigated the ratio dependence of receptor-mediated activation and deactivation {{and the influence of}} new members of the RGS protein family on GIRK currents by coexpressing the recombinant protein subunits in Xenopus oocytes and further analysis of the whole cell currents. The {{activation of}} GIRK channels by the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M 2 (M 2 mAChR) is strongly dependent on the ratio of receptor to channel in Xenopus oocytes. The increase and on-rate of the amplified current is affected by this ratio. An excess of receptor over channel is necessary for <b>current</b> <b>amplification,</b> while the reverse excess of channel over receptor abolishes the effect. The speed of receptor-mediated activation of GIRK currents is accelerated for a high ratio of receptor to channel, while the time of deactivation is independent of this ratio.
