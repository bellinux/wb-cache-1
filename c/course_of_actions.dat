2500|$|Once {{under the}} {{jurisdiction}} of Azad Hind, the islands formed the government's first claims to territory. The islands themselves were renamed [...] "Shaheed" [...] and [...] "Swaraj", meaning [...] "martyr" [...] and [...] "self-rule" [...] respectively. Bose placed the islands under the governorship of Lt Col A. D Loganathan, and had limited involvement with the official governorship of the territory, instead involving himself in plans to expand the Indian National Army, ensure adequate men and materiel, and formulate its <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>actions</b> and the administrations and relations of the Indian population in south east Asia and determining Japanese designs in India and his provisional government. In theory the government itself had the power to levy taxes on the local populace, and to make and enforce laws: in practice they were enforced by the police force under Japanese control. Indians were willing to pay these taxes at first, but became less inclined to do so {{towards the end of the}} war when the Provisional Government enacted legislation for higher war-time taxes to fund the INA. During his interrogation after the war Loganathan admitted that he had only had full control over the islands' vestigial education department, as the Japanese had retained full control over the police force, and in protest he had refused to accept responsibility for any other areas of Government. He was powerless to prevent the Homfreyganj massacre of 30 January 1944, where forty-four Indian civilians were shot by the Japanese on suspicion of spying. Many of them were members of the Indian Independence League, whose leader in Port Blair, Dr. Diwan Singh, had already been tortured to death in the Cellular Jail after doing his best to protect the islanders from Japanese atrocities during the first two years of the occupation.|$|E
2500|$|In Season Eight, Twilight {{appears in}} the premiere issue, written by Whedon; his shoes are seen {{floating}} {{in the air as}} he surveys Buffy. At the end of the arc, the military general who coordinated a large-scale attack on Buffy is revealed to be a follower of [...] "Twilight"; later issues show that many of the anti-Slayer forces serve under the leadership of a masked person known as Twilight. Buffy herself finally confronts Twilight in [...] "A Beautiful Sunset", along with the Slayer Satsu, but Twilight's superior strength and ability to fly ensures his easy victory. In Jane Espenson's story arc [...] "Retreat", Twilight locates Buffy's allies through their use of magic, forcing them to converge and retreat. In Tibet, Slayers and witches suppress their magic, which ultimately leads to a mutually destructive military conflict between the Slayers and Twilight's forces. In its aftermath, however, Buffy mysteriously acquires abilities conspicuously similar to Twilight's. In the penultimate arc, written by Brad Meltzer, the newly empowered Buffy faces up to her masked enemy again. Twilight reveals himself to be Angel, and claims to have been distracting the various groups that would seek to destroy Buffy while pushing her towards some other end. Buffy and Angel [...] destiny's agents in discarding the old reality and ushering in a new one [...] are overcome with desire for one another. They kiss, have sex and fly through space, eventually ascending to a dimension called Twilight. Meanwhile, Giles exposits a prophecy pertaining {{to the creation of a}} new universe, brought about by a Slayer falling in love with a vampire. The two come to their senses and return to Earth to fight off the hordes of demons unleashed by their ascension. Espenson's Riley one-shot flashes back to an uneasy Angel, early in his Twilight masquerade, convinced by Whistler (Angel's mentor in flashbacks from Buffy season two) that this <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>actions</b> leads to the only possible future in which Buffy survives. The final arc, [...] "Last Gleaming", depicts Angel's first encounter with the higher power which bestowed Twilight's superheroic abilities on him. Spike explains the next step in the prophecy, which concerns the new universe springing from the mystical Seed of Wonder, a source for all the magic in the universe, buried beneath Sunnydale. Although he tries to stop more of the damage caused by the Twilight dimension's coming, the Twilight dimension (the aforementioned higher power) possesses Angel. To protect the seed, a possessed Angel then tries to kill Buffy and Spike, and goes so far as to snap Giles' neck. This prompts Buffy to destroy the Seed. This stops the Twilight dimension from destroying the existing world, and Angel is dispossessed, but the universe is also stripped of all magic.|$|E

40|$|It {{is common}} to talk about options, where an option is a <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> an agent can take. A <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>action,</b> in turn, is that which can be the object of intention. It has not often been noticed in the literature, though, {{that there are two}} ways to {{understand}} what makes something an option: first, an option just is some <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> physically open (or, to be maximally liberal, logically open) to an agent; second, an option just is some <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> that the agent either in fact deliberates about taking or is psychologically capable of deliberating about taking. At any given time, there are far more <b>courses</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> open to an agent than the agent can or does deliberate about taking. What determines which <b>courses</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> an agent deliberates about as an option, and why do so many other <b>courses</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> remain out <b>of</b> deliberative view? I argue that while values, ends, the demands of both means-end coherence and consistency of beliefs contribute to the determination <b>of</b> which <b>courses</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> an agent sees as options, they cannot be the whole story. I argue that another mechanism, which I call the practical imagination, is primarily responsible for which <b>courses</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> an agent sees as options. Drawing upon both recent work in developmental and social psychology and a strain of philosophical argument that has attempted to show how human beings have a practical understanding of themselves that is mediated by what we can call a narrative identity, I argue that the norms governing the construction of a narrative identity are among the most important, albeit not the only, norms governing the practical imagination and that, just as we should look to the norms of practical reason to explain and critically reflect on practical deliberation, we should look to the norms of practical imagination to explain and critically reflect on the process by which an agent comes to see some <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> as an option...|$|R
40|$|The {{author has}} the {{intention}} to propose to the Brazilian health care management and sanitary reform managers an examination and positioning on the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> {{in the implementation of}} SUS (Brazilian National Health System). The findings underscore two non-convergent set of policies that have affected the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> in the implementation of the SUS in the 1990 s: the first and 'main' <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> derives from policies created in 1988 in the so-called Citizen Constitution, of which the SUS is the most important achievement. The second and "additional" <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> derives from the prevailing macro-economic model and its related policies, implemented since the 1990 s, besides advocating a social inclusion measure while leaving out all the related improvements of SUS such as Universality, Integrity and Equity. In addition, the second <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> is in opposition to the model based on social protection, besides raising the importance of market-based individualistic values and actions in general, it carries them into the health care system.
