60|$|I {{begin with}} present mercy and present justice. That which I <b>call</b> <b>present</b> mercy, is that faith, light, knowledge, and {{taste of the}} good word of God, that a man may have, and perish. This is called in scripture, Believing for a while, during for a while, and rejoicing in the light for a season (Heb 6:4,5; 2 Peter 2:20; Matt 13:22; Luke 8:13). Now I call this mercy, both because none, as men, can deserve it, and also because the proper end thereof is to do good to those that have it. But I call it present mercy, because those that are only blessed with that, may sin it away, and perish; as {{did some of the}} Galatians, Hebrews, Alexandrians, with the Asians, and others (Gal 5:4; Heb 12:15,16; 1 Tim 1:20; 2 Tim 2:18, 1:15; Heb 12:15). But yet observe again, I do not call this present mercy, because God hath {{determined}} it shall last but a while absolutely; but because it is possible for man to lose it, yea determined he shall, conditionally (John 5:35; 1 Cor 12:7).|$|E
50|$|The Professional College of Engineers and Land Surveyors of Puerto Rico —Colegio de Ingenieros y Agrimensores de Puerto Rico (CIAPR)— is the {{professional}} association mandated by law that groups all engineers and land surveyors that <b>call,</b> <b>present,</b> or represent themselves as 'engineers' or 'land surveyors' in Puerto Rico. As {{with many other}} countries, the profession of engineering and land surveying is both regulated and licensed in Puerto Rico; while another entity, namely the Puerto Rico Examining Board of Engineers and Land Surveyors, regulates the profession and emits its corresponding licenses, the Puerto Rico Annotated Codes and Act 173 of 1988 requires that all licensed engineers and land surveyors in Puerto Rico must be members of the College. The quasi-public nonprofit corporation was established on May 15, 1938, through Act 319 of 1938 {{in order to bring}} together professionals with the right to practice engineering, architecture and surveying in Puerto Rico.|$|E
50|$|The {{origins of}} Clan MacNeacail are mysterious. The {{traditional}} account (as relayed, for example, by the Rev. John Morison of Bragar in Lewis in about 1680) holds {{them to have}} been the ancient proprietors of Lewis, but they lost much of their power and prestige when the Macleods succeeded to the island by marriage to a MacNicol heiress. Hebridean tradition claims that this was a forced marriage, with the bride seized and the warriors of the Clan MacNicol attacked, with their vessels sunk by the MacLeods off the coast of the island. By 1450, however, the MacNicols were firmly established in the Trotternish peninsula in Skye, serving as members of the Council of the Lordship of the Isles. By {{the end of the eighteenth}} century, the clan would become distinguished by the large number of clergymen within its roll <b>call,</b> <b>present</b> in parishes across the Western Isles and northern Scotland, and the ecclesiastical tradition appears to have been laid down by their Medieval ancestors. The MacNicols were the principal benefactors of the Cathedral Church of St. Columba at Snizort on Skye, where tradition holds that one hundred leading men of the clan received burial.|$|E

50|$|Sometimes {{the past}} {{imperfect}} subjunctive {{is used to}} replace the present conditional.

40|$|In this study, {{a formal}} model for {{specification}} of Access Control Policies (ACP) is represented. This model {{is capable of}} expressing several ACPs and combining them in a unified framework. We <b>call</b> <b>present</b> model Constrained Policy Graph (CPG), which {{is an extension of}} Take-Grant (TG) protection model. Although TG can be used to specify the ACPs but it represents the policies without any constraint (e. g., time, location, or any other restriction parameters). Furthermore, it hasn`t ever been used for combining the policies and nested expression of them. In present proposed model, not only the policies can be constrained according to system requirements but also, it can be used for combining ACPs as well as their nested specification. Furthermore, ACPs can be verified conflicts or contradictions using this model. One of the main applications of the proposed model is specifying and combining the ACPs of web services and verifying their composed policies in web service composition...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} a {{transport}} layer handover mechanism for Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) in 802. 11 b using the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) is proposed. The multi-homing feature of SCTP {{is used to}} allow connections to several 802. 11 b Access Points (AP’s). Probing packets that model VoIP encoded data at various transmission rates are used to obtain quality metrics {{from each of the}} available networks. Handover decisions are made based on the Mean Opinion Score (MOS) calculated from the ITU-T E-Model for voice quality assessment using the obtained measurements. The handover mechanism is shown to operate in 802. 11 b networks with heterogeneous transmission rates using multiple VoIP codecs. The results show a high correlation between the MOS predicted by the proposed mechanism and the MOS experienced by a VoIP <b>call</b> <b>present</b> in the network. Results verify the accurate operation of the scheme using multiple VoIP codecs at various transmission rates. A simulation showing an SCTP endpoint handover between heterogeneous transmission rate AP’s is presented. I...|$|E
