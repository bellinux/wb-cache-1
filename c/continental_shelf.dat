5|$|Archeological {{data from}} the Late Pleistocene in South Asia is vital for our {{understanding}} of the evolution of modern human behavior and how early humans spread through the Old World. In prehistoric times, the movement of human and faunal populations from the Indian mainland to Sri Lanka and back took place over the <b>continental</b> <b>shelf</b> shared between the two countries, which from around 7000 BP has been submerged below the Palk Strait and Adam's Bridge. Being only around 70 m deep, significant reductions in sea level due to climate change, in at least the past 500,000 years, periodically caused the <b>continental</b> <b>shelf</b> to be exposed, forming a land bridge approximately 100km wide and 50km long.|$|E
5|$|Compressive forces {{built up}} along {{the entire length of}} the broad <b>continental</b> <b>shelf.</b> The Sierran Arc, also called the Cordilleran Mesozoic magmatic arc, started to form from heat and {{pressure}} generated from the subduction. Compressive forces caused thrust faults to develop and granitic blobs of magma called plutons to rise in the Death Valley region and beyond, most notably creating the Sierra Nevada Batholith to the west. Thrust faulting was so severe that the <b>continental</b> <b>shelf</b> was shortened and some parts of older formations were moved on top of younger rock units.|$|E
5|$|Marine {{habitats}} can {{be divided}} horizontally into coastal and open ocean habitats. Coastal habitats extend from the shoreline {{to the edge of}} the <b>continental</b> <b>shelf.</b> Most marine life is found in coastal habitats, even though the shelf area occupies only 7 percent of the total ocean area. Open ocean habitats are found in the deep ocean beyond the edge of the <b>continental</b> <b>shelf.</b> Alternatively, marine habitats {{can be divided}} vertically into pelagic (open water), demersal (just above the seabed), and benthic (sea bottom) habitats. A third division is by latitude: from tropical to temperate to polar waters.|$|E
30|$|<b>Continental</b> <b>shelves</b> are {{the main}} {{transport}} pathway of sediments from land to sea, playing {{an important role in}} the earth’s surface system. The sedimentary environment of low-latitude mixed siliciclastic–carbonate <b>continental</b> <b>shelves</b> is strongly influenced by sea-level change and fluvial processes (Dunbar and Dickens 2003; Schlager et al. 1994; Webster et al. 2012). Detailed research on sedimentary environments of <b>continental</b> <b>shelves</b> improves our understanding of monsoonal intensity and sea-level variability (Bourget et al. 2012; Yokoyama et al. 2000).|$|R

In 2002, both Malaysia and Indonesia submitted to arbitration by the ICJ on a territorial {{dispute over the}} Ligitan and Sipadan islands which were later won by Malaysia. There are also several other disputes yet to be settled with Indonesia over the overlapping claims on the Ambalat <b>continental</b> <b>shelf</b> in the Celebes Sea and land border dispute between Sabah and North Kalimantan. Malaysia's claim over {{a portion of the}} Spratly Islands is also based on sharing a <b>continental</b> <b>shelf</b> with Sabah.|$|E
5|$|Decline in age, size during sexual {{maturity}} in {{great northern tilefish}} population is occurring throughout the <b>continental</b> <b>shelf.</b> In the mid-Atlantic Bight, smaller sizes and younger ages at maturity were observed in 2008, compared to the survey data from the 1980s where recorded measurements showed a larger population. The recent estimates of age and size at maturity in the southern U.S. waters were smaller than those previously reported in the late 1980s. There were also very few juvenile tilefish seen in tilefish population surveys in the southern U.S. waters in both the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico. Declines in population could negatively affect other organisms in their surrounding environment {{due to the fact}} that without tilefish, the burrows underneath the <b>continental</b> <b>shelf</b> will disappear, therefore putting an end to the symbiotic relationship with other organisms that use the tunnels as shelter.|$|E
5|$|There are {{substantial}} fossil records of jawed fishes across the K–Pg boundary, which provide good evidence of extinction patterns of these classes of marine vertebrates. While {{the deep sea}} realm was able to remain seemingly unaffected, there was an equal loss between the open marine apex predators and the durophagous demersal feeders on the <b>continental</b> <b>shelf.</b>|$|E

It was believed that she had sunk {{off the edge of}} the <b>continental</b> <b>shelf,</b> to a depth at which the Royal Australian Navy did not have the capability to search for a vessel of Centaurs size. Some parties also believed that Rippon's calculated point of sinking was inaccurate, either intentionally or through error.|$|E

5|$|A severe {{regression}} {{would have}} greatly reduced the <b>continental</b> <b>shelf</b> area, {{which is the}} most species-rich part of the sea, and therefore could have been enough to cause a marine mass extinction, however, research concludes that this change would have been insufficient to cause the observed level of ammonite extinction. The regression would also have caused climate changes, partly by disrupting winds and ocean currents and partly by reducing the Earth's albedo and therefore, increasing global temperatures.|$|E

The Mississippian and Pennsylvanian sediments in the north; Permian sediments in the west; and Cretaceous sediments in the east, along the Gulf coast and {{out on the}} Texas <b>continental</b> <b>shelf</b> contain oil. Oligocene volcanic rocks are found in far west Texas in the Big Bend area. A blanket of Miocene sediments known as the Ogallala formation in the western high plains region is an important aquifer.

5|$|The Lesser Sunda Islands {{is a small}} {{archipelago}} which, {{from west}} to east, consists of Bali, Lombok, Sumbawa, Flores, Sumba and the Timor islands; all are located {{at the edge of}} the Australian <b>continental</b> <b>shelf.</b> Volcanoes in the area are formed because of oceanic crusts and the movement of the shelf itself. Some volcanoes completely form an island, for instance, the Sangeang Api island. Mount Tambora, on Sumbawa island, erupted on 5 April 1815, with a scale 7 on the VEI and is considered the most violent eruption in recorded history.|$|E

5|$|The Willamette River basin {{was created}} {{primarily}} by plate tectonics and volcanism and was altered by erosion and sedimentation, including some related to enormous glacial floods as recent as 13,000years ago. The initial trough-like configuration was created about 35million {{years ago as}} a forearc basin while the Pacific Plate subducted beneath the North American Plate. Marine deposits on top of older volcanics underlie the valley, which was initially part of the <b>continental</b> <b>shelf,</b> rather than a separate inland sea. About 20 to 16million years ago, uplift formed the Coast Range and separated the basin from the Pacific Ocean.|$|E
5|$|The {{range of}} the finless sleeper ray extends from the eastern Andaman Sea, near {{southern}} border between Thailand and Myanmar, through the Strait of Malacca to Singapore, and northward to Vietnam. Its exact distribution off Thailand is uncertain. There is a single record of this species from Sarawak in Borneo. This bottom-dwelling species inhabits fine sediment habitat over the <b>continental</b> <b>shelf</b> in both inshore and offshore waters. In the 19th century, it was reportedly abundant year-round in the Straits of Malacca. It is locally common in some areas.|$|E
5|$|The sand {{devil is}} found in the northwestern Atlantic Ocean from Massachusetts to the Florida Keys, where it is fairly common. It also occurs in the {{northern}} Gulf of Mexico, and there are additional unconfirmed records from Cuba, Jamaica, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. The southern extent of its range is uncertain due to confusion with the disparate angelshark (S. heteroptera) and Mexican angelshark (S. mexicana). This bottom-dwelling shark is found over sandy or muddy bottoms on the <b>continental</b> <b>shelf</b> and slope.|$|E
50|$|A 2006 {{study by}} Canadian {{scientists}} has found five species of deep-sea fish - blue hake, spiny eel - {{to be on}} the verge of extinction due to the shift of commercial fishing from <b>continental</b> <b>shelves</b> to the slopes of the <b>continental</b> <b>shelves,</b> down to depths of 1600 meters. The slow reproduction of these fish - they reach sexual maturity at about the same age as human beings - is one of the main reasons that they cannot recover from the excessive fishing.|$|R
50|$|In hydrology, an oceanic basin may be {{anywhere}} on Earth that {{is covered by}} seawater, but geologically ocean basins are large geologic basins that are below sea level. Geologically, there are other undersea geomorphological features such as the <b>continental</b> <b>shelves,</b> the deep ocean trenches, and the undersea mountain ranges (for example, the mid-Atlantic ridge and the Emperor Seamounts) which are {{not considered to be}} part of the ocean basins; while hydrologically, oceanic basins include the flanking <b>continental</b> <b>shelves</b> and shallow, epeiric seas.|$|R

5|$|Sperm {{whales are}} not the easiest of whales to watch, due to their long dive times and ability to travel long {{distances}} underwater. However, due to the distinctive look and large size of the whale, watching is increasingly popular. Sperm whale watchers often use hydrophones {{to listen to the}} clicks of the whales and locate them before they surface. Popular locations for sperm whale watching include the town of Kaikoura on New Zealand's South Island, Andenes and Tromsø in Arctic Norway; as well as the Azores, where the <b>continental</b> <b>shelf</b> is so narrow that whales can be observed from the shore, and Dominica where a long-term scientific research program, The Dominica Sperm Whale Project, has been in operation since 2005.|$|E
5|$|The favored {{temperature}} {{range of the}} roughtail stingray is , {{which is the most}} important factor determining its distribution. It conducts seasonal migrations off the eastern United States: from December to May, this ray is found over the middle and outer parts of the <b>continental</b> <b>shelf</b> from Cape Hatteras in North Carolina to Florida, with larger rays occurring further south than smaller ones. In the spring, the population moves north of the Cape and towards the coast into bays, inlets, and saltier estuaries, though preserving the north-south gradient of body sizes. A similar migration, from shallow coastal waters in summer to deeper offshore waters in winter, apparently occurs in the Mediterranean. Pregnant females tend to be found apart from other individuals.|$|E
5|$|On 21 December 1979, the Director of National Mapping of Malaysia {{published}} a map entitled Territorial Waters and <b>Continental</b> <b>Shelf</b> Boundaries of Malaysia showing Pedra Branca {{to be within}} its territorial waters. Singapore rejected this claim in a diplomatic note of 14 February 1980 and asked for the map to be corrected. The dispute was not resolved by an exchange of correspondence and intergovernmental talks in 1993 and 1994. In {{the first round of}} talks in February 1993 the issue of sovereignty over Middle Rocks and South Ledge was also raised. Malaysia and Singapore therefore agreed to submit the dispute to the International Court of Justice (ICJ), signing a Special Agreement for this purpose in February 2003 and notifying the Court of it in July 2003. The case was heard at the Peace Palace in The Hague between 6 and 23 November 2007.|$|E
