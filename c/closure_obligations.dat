The incidence of acid mine drainage and the high number of ownerless and abandoned mines in South Africa have brought the consequences of insufficient mine <b>closure</b> <b>obligations</b> in the mining sector into the spotlight. Aim: The aim {{of this study is to}} establish the extent to which platinum mines listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) comply with a recommended disclosure framework. Setting: South Africa is the largest producer of platinum in the world. The study covers all platinum mines listed on the JSE. Methods: Using a framework, a census of the annual financial statements, integrated annual reports and sustainability reports or websites was conducted to determine the level of compliance of disclosure relating to mine <b>closure</b> <b>obligations</b> to the recommended disclosure framework. Results: The results show disclosure relating to mine <b>closure</b> <b>obligations</b> of platinum mines listed on the JSE is inconsistent and not sufficient for stakeholders to understand the scope, key assumptions, parameters or reliability of the assessment and calculation of mine <b>closure</b> <b>obligations.</b> Conclusion: The assumptions used to determine mine <b>closure</b> <b>obligations</b> are specialised and multi-disciplinary. The accuracy and reliability of mine <b>closure</b> <b>obligations</b> will improve dramatically through greater transparency and access to information. It is recommended that the JSE listings for mining companies should require a competent person’s report to provide disclosure on assumptions, key values and processes applied to determine the mine <b>closure</b> <b>obligations.</b> Furthermore, it is recommended that the Department of Mineral Resources implements a mechanism of independent assessment of mine <b>closure</b> <b>obligations</b> by experts on an ongoing basis.

40|$|The {{responsible}} {{management of}} the rehabilitation and decommissioning of mine sites and the affected environs requires an effective regulatory, policy, and financial securities framework in place. While mining jurisdictions may {{have confidence in the}} adequacy of their policy and regulatory systems, financial security mechanisms (posted by mining companies in the form of unconditional performance bonds) are often also used to minimise negative mining-related outcomes. In theory, such mining securities ensure sufficient funds are available to a government to rehabilitate mine sites in the event operators fail to meet their mine rehabilitation and <b>closure</b> <b>obligations.</b> However, four major challenges are often encountered with these mechanisms: 1) They are commonly insufficient to cover appropriate mine closure activities and environmental remediation {{in the case of a}} default; 2) Bonds are tied to individual tenements and not damages outside of the designated zone; 3) Mining companies bear significant administrative costs associated with the creation and posting of bonds, and; 4) They do not solve the problem of historical abandoned mine sites. Conventional environmental bond mechanisms also create disincentives to mining company investment (particularly small companies) and little financial benefit for governments (benefits are largely captured by the banking sector). While Western Australia has long been considered as a sophisticated and advanced mining intensive jurisdiction, as of 2011 the state environmental bond system was estimated to cover less than 25 % of the total obligation of mine site rehabilitation costs that may be required. These concerns led to the creation of an innovative policy approach: the Mining Rehabilitation Fund Act 2012. This paper discusses the background to the significant inefficiencies in the previous arrangements (which remain typical across the developed world), how they expose governments and mining companies to significant environmental obligations and financial challenges, and how they disincentivise mining activity. The paper also summarises how the Mining Rehabilitation Fund (MRF) anticipates and underwrites the full closure costs for mine rehabilitation, how it is a cost-neutral source of funds for governments to remediate existing abandoned mines, and how it ‘frees up’ mining company capital. It is estimated that after only ten years the MRF will cover the full clean-up cost of even the largest mine in Western Australia should any complete default occur as a worst case scenario. The interest earned by the government on the principal MRF funds will also be available for rehabilitation and remediation of previously abandoned mines, additional environmental monitoring, and impact assessment and remediation research and development. The paper concludes with how such a system may be adaptable to the African context...|$|E

5000|$|Solar Century Ltd {{claimed the}} SS {{breached}} legitimate expectations, misused power, and acted unfairly by stopping the ‘renewables obligation’ for larger projects. Solar Century Ltd installed large solar photovoltaic systems (solar farms). It {{benefited from the}} renewables obligation scheme that started in 2002. In 2011, the renewables obligation was replaced with a ‘contracts for difference’ scheme. The government capped spending for energy and climate change. The Energy Act 2013, inserting Electricity Act 1989 ss 32LA-LB, gave the Secretary of State power to close the renewables obligation to new capacity. This was initially proposed for 31 March 2017 for solar PV capacity over 5MW. A government statement {{said it would be}} ‘maintaining support levels for ... existing investments’. The SS then decided to close it on 1 April 2015, with the Renewables <b>Obligation</b> <b>Closure</b> (Amendment) Order 2015, saying takeup was higher than expected and its cap would be exceeded. It had a grace period to protect people who could demonstrate a significant financial commitment to projects at the consultation date. Solar Century argued they had a legitimate expectation from clear representations by government that the scheme would be open until 2017, the 2015 Order was ultra vires the Electricity Act 1989 ss 32LA-LB, and it was unfair to specify a date in the past as one for identifying a significant financial commitment.|$|R
5000|$|Republic Services owns or {{operates}} 193 active landfills. They {{also have}} responsibility for 126 closed landfills, {{for which they}} have associated <b>closure</b> and post-closure <b>obligations.</b> Republic Services owns and operates the largest landfill in the United States at 2,200 acres (890 ha) located in Apex, Nevada. In 2008, {{at the time that}} Republic Services bought Allied Waste, it acquired two closed St. Louis, Missouri landfills, West Lake and Bridgeton. An underground event (more accurately referred to as a “smoldering event”) [...] was detected in the closed Bridgeton Landfill. Due to the odors emitted from the landfill and its proximity to the adjacent West Lake—an EPA-managed Super Fund site which contains low-level radioactive waste dumped there illegally over forty years ago—environmental groups got involved. Republic operates the Bridgeton Landfill near St. Louis, Missouri. The landfill is the site of an underground event of concern to residents and the EPA. Since 2013, when Republic Services installed equipment to flare off gasses and treat contaminated liquid, the levels of contaminants released into the air have mostly fallen below regulatory acceptable levels. In 2013 the company said it would build a barrier to separate the two landfills, but because the EPA was uncertain where the radioactive contamination was located, progress on the barrier was delayed for more than a year.|$|R
