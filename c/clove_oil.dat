25|$|Most horses do {{not object}} to mane pulling, and willingly stand for the process.

It is also recommended that pulling is performed right after exercise, when it is thought that the mane comes out more easily because the pores are open.

500|$|There {{are many}} causes of {{toothache}} and its diagnosis is a specialist topic, meaning that attendance at a dentist is usually required. Since {{many cases of}} toothache are inflammatory in nature, over the counter non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may help (unless contraindicated, such as [...] with a peptic ulcer). [...] Generally, NSAIDs are as effective as aspirin alone or in combination with codeine. However, simple analgesics may have little effect on some causes of toothache, and the severe pain can drive individuals to exceed the maximum dose. For example, when acetaminophen (paracetamol) is taken for toothache, an accidental overdose {{is more likely to}} occur when compared to people who are taking acetaminophen for other reasons. Another risk in persons with toothache is a painful chemical burn of the oral mucosa caused by holding a caustic substance such as aspirin tablets and toothache remedies containing eugenol (such as <b>clove</b> <b>oil)</b> against the gum. Although the logic of placing a tablet against the painful tooth is understandable, an aspirin tablet needs to be swallowed to have any pain-killing effect. Caustic toothache remedies require careful application to the tooth only, without coming into excessive contact with the soft tissues of the mouth.|$|E

Administration of ginger oil to diabetic rats resulted in mild increases of the levels of blood glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, total protein, urea, uric acid and aspartate aminotransferase, while the value of HDL-cholesterol was significantly decreased. Moreover, the treatment with ginger oil noticeably restored the values of blood creatinine and alanine aminotransferase activity to the control levels. Supplementation of tested oils significantly decreased the haematobiochemical changes in STZ-diabetic rats. In comparison with control, administration of ginger oil or ginger plus <b>clove</b> <b>oils</b> significantly reduced the levels of blood glucose in non-diabetic rats.
